 ISRAEL: Resignation of Finance Minister
 Finance Minister Aridor's resignation yesterday casts doubt on
 Prime Minister Shamir's ability to carry out additional controversial
 economic measures.
 Aridor resigned during a Cabinet meeting that was called after his
 plan to make the US dollar legal tender in Israel was reported in the
 Israeli press. Opposition in the Cabinet centered on the greater
 economic dependence on the US that such a plan would entail. The
 opposition Labor Party has called for a no-confidence vote next week
 on the government's handling of the economy.
 Comment: Most Israelis hold Aridor responsible for Israel's
 current economic disorder, and many in the government will welcome
 his departure. Aridor's replacement, however, will be faced with the
 same problems-triple-digit inflation and rising real wages-th
 Aridor tried to address, but with much less room for maneuver.
 The Cabinet's decision to turn down the dollar linkage
 recommended by Aridor-and almost certainly approved by
 Shamir-will raise questions about the new Prime Minister's ability to
 control his coalition. It also will reinforce the widely held view that
 Shamir has no coherent strategy for dealing with economic problems.
 The disarray in the new government increases the chance of an early
 election next year.
 Although Aridor's plan is now dead, demand for the US dollar will
 remain strong as Israelis react to the uncertain economic climate by
 continuing to exchange their shekels. The government will have little
 choice but to let the value of the shekel fall farther, which-with the
 price hikes announced on Tuesday-will result in a record inflation

 SOUTH KOREA: Continued Policy of Restraint
 Seoul is still weighing the consequences of the bombing last

 requires a calm and firm response.
 In a separate meeting, however, Defense Minister Yoon told
 Weinberger that the South Korean public has come to a "breaking
 point." He added that he and his military chiefs are tr in to r    in

 Chun, however, has to take into account the views of his military

 will try to exploit public frustration over the bombing and the recent
 airliner shootdown. After the initial shock of the bombing fades, they
 will also seek to refocus public attention on the political difficulties the
 that could affect President Reagan's planned visit next month.
 South Korean leader almost certainly does not want to do anything
 As long as Chun and the military leadership can retain support
 within the ranks for his policy of restraint, Seoul will be able to resist
 calls for an armed response. Nonetheless, the President will need

 WEST GERMANY: Major Protests Against INF
 The peace movement's announced "Action Week" of nationwide
 protests beginning tomorrow will culminate in a demonstration in Bonn
 that could involve several hundred thousand people, but the
 government is confident it can handle the situation.
 The opposition Social Democrats and the West German Trade
 Union Federation have endorsed participation in "Action Week"
 activities so long as they remain legal and peaceful. Both groups'
 leaders nonetheless would prefer to keep some distance between
 themselves and the peace movement.
 The two groups almost certainly recognize that strong anti-INF
 sentiment would lead many members to participate anyway. Party
 and union chiefs are seeking compromises to preclude further
 divisions over INF.
 The government is confident it can control the demonstrations.
 Some officials publicly have threatened tough penalties and swift
 reactions, but authorities are more likely to try to avoid violence, as
 they did at Mutlangen early last month.
 The demonstrations are unlikely to weaken Bonn's commitment
 to INF deployments. Chancellor Kohl believes that his election victory
 in March gave him a mandate to deploy, and he has said publicly he
 will not be swayed by the protests.

 LEBANON: Preparatory Committee Meets
 The national reconciliation preparatory committee yesterday
 agreed on a general agenda for the conference scheduled for next
 week, but cease-fire violations are again increasing as the separate
 committee on security matters suffered a setback.
 Most of Lebanon's factional leaders sent representatives to the
 committee meeting in Beirut, but former President Franjiyah and
 former Prime Minister Karami-both members of the Syrian-backed
 National Salvation Front-did not participate. There is still no
 agreement on a site for the reconciliation conference, now scheduled
 to start next Thursday.
 The security committee convened yesterday, but both Amal Shia
 and Druze spokesmen later said their groups would stop participating
 in it, alleging violations of the cease-fire arrangements.
 Lebanese Army positions at Suq al Gharb were shelled yesterday
 for the second consecutive day. One Lebanese soldier has been killed
 and five others wounded during the recent shelling.
 US Marine positions near the Beirut airport came under small
 arms fire yesterday. In addition, a US Marine was wounded when a
 hand grenade exploded near the US Embassy.
 According to press reports, PLO chief Arafat yesterday used his
 forces to separate warring militias battling in the port of Tripoli. The
 clashes between the anti-Syrian Islamic Unification Movement and
 pro-Syrian Communist Party militias have left more than 60 people
 dead.
 Comment: President Gemayel apparently set an opening date for
 the reconciliation conference even without an agreement on a venue
 in hopes of forcing Druze leader Walid Junblatt to dro  his        s
 to a meeting at the presidential palace near Beirut.
 The Amal Shia and Druze statements appeared not to foreclose
 further participation in the security committee's talks. Their stance
 probably reflects a bid to increase the pressure on Gemavel for
 concessions at the reconciliation conference.
 The fighting in Tripoli does not affect the security situation in
 Beirut. Those clashes could escalate, however, into a confrontation
 between Syrian surrogates and loyalist PLO forces there.

 CYPRUS: Turkish Cypriots Move Toward Independence
 Top Secret
 There are growing indications that the Turkish Cypriots are
 seriously considering declaring independence, a move that almost
 certainly would kill any hope of a negotiated settlement.
 This week a bill proposing a separate flag for northern Cyprus
 was introduced in the Turkish Cypriot "Assembly." The "Assembly"
 is set to consider another bill, introduced in July, that would enable it
 to declare independence following a referendum. That bill also would
 provide for independence without a referendum if Turkish Cypriot
 leaders were to conclude a delay would be harmful to community
 The Turkish Cypriots and the Turkish Government early this
 month rejected UN Secretary General Perez de Cuellar's latest
 initiative aimed at bringing the two Cypriot communities closer to a
 settlement. Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash since then has
 threatened publicly to declare independence unless President
 Kyprianou agrees to a summit meeting and unless the Greek Cypriots
 resume negotiations under a UN plan of 1981. Denktash also has
 insisted that the provisional Greek Cypriot representatives at the
 Council of Europe relinquish their seats
 Comment: Denktash has often threatened to establish an
 independent state, but he has been especially outspoken on the issue
 recently. Although Ankara has restrained him in the past, there are
 signs that it may be reevaluating its policy. Turkey's rejection of Perez
 de Cuellar's recent proposals, for example, came as a surprise to UN
 officials, who had expected Ankara to agree.
 In addition, the Turks have been telling US officials ove
 several months that they are "losing control" of Denktash.
 The Greeks and Greek Cypriots would consider a Turkish Cypriot
 declaration of independence an extreme provocation. They almost
 certainly would believe that the US had acquiesced in the decision.
 Such a belief could jeopardize the US-Greek base accord now before
 the parliament and could lead the Cypriots to .revoke permission for
 the US to use facilities on Cyprus for resupplying the Multinational

 PAKISTAN-US: Threat to US Installations
 A source of the US Consulate General in Karachi says there is
 increased discussion within the opposition movement about action
 against US diplomatic posts in Pakistan. The Consulate General also
 reports that US flags were burned in many of the antigovernment
 demonstrations in Sind and Baluchistan Provinces this week.

 CHINA: Party Plenum Sets Purge Agenda
 The session of the party Central Committee that adjourned on
 Wednesday set guidelines for a party purge that will improve the
 political base of General Secretary Hu Yaobang. The meeting
 endorsed criteria for dismissals and recruitment for a drive scheduled
 to begin this winter, and it named a high-level commission chaired by
 Hu to oversee the effort. The criteria prohibit the physical or
 psychological abuses that characterized similar party campaigns
 under Mao Zedong. They stress ideological indoctrination and
 leniency for confessed misconduct.
 Comment: The plenum marks the beginning of a three-year
 campaign to dismiss foes of Deng Xiaoping's policies and of his
 personnel appointments. Some 2-4 million members are to be
 removed from the party rolls. The elimination of politically unreliable,
 corrupt, and incompetent officials will increase party support for Hu
 Yaobang and his reformist policies. It will be less successful in
 improving the part 's sagging reputation among the people.

 GREECE-WESTERN EUROPE: Socialist Conference
 Prime Minister Papandreou will host a conference of European
 Socialist leaders in Athens this weekend. The Prime Ministers of Italy,
 France, Spain, and Portugal are scheduled to attend. The semiofficial
 Athens News Agency reports that the topics of discussions will
 include disarmament, East-West relations, the world economy, and
 the dialogue with Third World countries.
 Comment: The scheduling of the conference two days before the
 second anniversary of the Socialists' election victory in Greece almost
 certainly is an attempt by Papandreou to demonstrate European
 Socialist support for his regime. The Prime Minister's guests,
 however, probably will want to avoid controversial statements, and no
 official communique will be released.

 operations along the western border crossed into Botswana early this
 month to attack antigovernment dissidents, according to press
 reports. The unit reportedly has returned to Zimbabwe.
 Comment: The Zimbabwean Army, which had been frustrated by
 its inability to conduct cross-border operations, believes it can
 eliminate the insurgent threat by denying the dissidents sanctuary in
 Botswana. Whether the Zimbabwean cabinet approved the incursion
 is not known. Botswana in the past has assured Harare that it would
 cooperate by preventing the use of its territory by Zimbabwean
 dissidents, but its Army is too small and poorly equipped to be
 effective. The Botswana Government probably will protest the
 incursion through diplomatic channels but may come under pressure
 from Harare to allow Zimbabwean troops a role in policing the

 USSR: Grain Harvest Hit by Storm
 Izvestiya reported on Wednesday that a snowstorm was seriously
 hampering the late stages of the Soviet grain harvest in central and
 western Siberia and that some of the crop already had been lost. The
 snowstorm reportedly hit the agricultural regions, where about
 2.5 million hectares of grain-2 percent of the total grain area of the
 USSR-remain to be cut. The affected area produces only about
 2-3 million tons of grain. Soviet weather data indicate that snow
 accumulations were light and that temperatures during the past few
 days reached nearly 50 degrees Fahrenheit across the region.
 Comment: The snow probably melted quickly, keeping losses to
 a minimum. Even if bad weather returns and farmers are unable to
 complete the harvest, the impact on total Soviet grain production
 estimated at 210 million tons, would be negligible.

 'Special Analysis
 LEBANON: Prospects for Reconciliation
 The Daily today prints the key judgments of a recent oecial
 National Intelligence Estimate, "Prospects for Lebanon."
 The prospects for a lasting political reconciliation among
 Lebanon's confessional factions are extremely bleak. Domestic
 stability in Lebanon depends upon reaching a new balance-of-power
 arrangement in which the interests of the country's majority Muslim
 population are more equitably accommodated and the security of the
 Christian community is assured. Progress on these political issues is
 essential if the cease-fire is to endure.
 Maronite Christians-particularly the Phalange Party and
 Lebanese Forces militia leaders-will resist changes that significantly
 reduce their influence in the government. Syria will urge the Muslims
 and the Druze to press for their maximum demands. Whenever a
 national reconciliation conference is held, it is most likely to stalemate
 and eventually break down, resulting in heightened confessional
 intransigence, renewed factional fighting, and a prolonged partition of
 Meaningful national reconciliation depends primarily on the
 Lebanese, and for the present they seem unwilling to make the
 concessions and compromises necessary for a lasting
 accommodation. As a consequence, the prospects of achieving a
 sovereign and politically stable state free from foreign occupation are
 virtually nonexistent.
 Instead, we can expect a weak central government which
 probably can maintain control over greater Beirut but which has to
 contend with autonomous Maronite and Druze heartlands and
 prolonged Syrian and Israeli occupation. The legal facade of the
 central government's sovereignty will continue however, since no
 party favors formal partition.
 In essence, a de facto confederal or cantonal system might
 emerge within which many of the essential interests of most internal
 and external participants would be met. The weaker the authority of
 the central government the greater is the likelihood of its acceptability
 to most parties.
 This situation, while far from ideal, may well endure for an
 extended period. Even with continued US military support, the
 Gemayel government may at best gain a breathing space from

 fighting in which to begin political negotiations and arrange cosmetic
 deals with some Muslims. Failure to achieve real progress, however,
 probably will lead sooner or later to renewed fighting.
 The introduction of US military power into Lebanon-symbolized
 by naval gunfire and substantial logistic support for the Lebanese
 Army defense of greater Beirut in September-has at least
 temporarily altered the military equation in the country. The threat of
 greater US, French, and possibly Israeli involvement, the credible
 performance of the Lebanese Army, the exhaustion of Druze forces,
 and the fact that Syria had obtained many of its political goals
 induced Damascus to shift the conflict from the military to the political
 The Gemayel government and Christian hardliners will look to the
 US for support to counter Muslim and Syrian pressure for radical
 political change. The US will be blamed for brokering any settlement
 that is not responsive to Druze, Muslim, and Syrian interests.
 If the Christians agree to greater Muslim influence in the political
 system, however, the likely result over the long term will be a more
 pro-Arab Lebanon that will improve its relations with Damascus and
 be less accommodating toward Israel. The 17 May Israeli-Lebanese
 Accords will be in greater jeopardy, but we believe any Lebanees
 government will hold the agreement in abeyance in any case.
 The Gemayel government is now perceived within Lebanon and
 throughout the Arab world as representing narrow Christian
 Phalangist interests. US military support for Christian interests
 against Muslim and Druze actions will make it very difficult for the
 Egyptian and Jordanian Governments to lend further diplomatic and
 military support for US policies in Lebanon. Should the US become
 involved in a direct military confrontation with Syria, Saudi Arabia
 would be forced to support President Assad publicly-leaving US
 policy in Lebanon without Arab support.
 External Factors
 Syria's key goals in Lebanon are to establish a government
 responsive to its interests and to minimize Israeli influence in the
 country. Damascus will continue to support its allies and surrogates in
 Lebanon to weaken the government of President Gemayel and force
 Gemayel or his successor to reach an accommodation with Syria.
 Assad can use either indirect military pressure or political
 negotiations to keep the Army and the Lebanese Forces on the
 defensive.

 Regardless of the outcome of talks on Lebanon's internal political
 configuration, Assad will not accept a Lebanese government that
 maintains overt ties to Israel. Damascus will continue to press
 Gemayel or a suc               abrogate the 17 May Lebanese-
 Israeli agreement.
 Consistent with the USSR's primary aim of increasing its influence
 in the region, Moscow supports Syria's policies. Damascus, not.
 Moscow, determines Syrian policy in Lebanon, but Soviet support
 reinforces Assad's confidence. Like Damascus, Moscow does not
 want a Beirut government that is aligned with Israel, or any solution to
 the Lebanese problem that has been brokered by the US. In addition,
 Moscow has a strong interest in having the US military presence in
 Lebanon removed or be seen as ineffective. It is also interested in
 frustrating broader US peace initiatives in the region that do not
 include Moscow, damaging the US image and undermining its
 credibility in the Arab world and elsewhere, and hinderin

 ability to use its military might in other parts of the world.

 While Soviet advisers and air defense personnel already in Syria
 could become involved in the event of major escalation, we do not
 envision direct Soviet military support to Syrian forces in Lebanon.
 Moscow has long made it clear to Assad that Soviet support to Syria
 does not obligate it to protect the Syrian presence in Lebanon. The
 Kremlin would prefer that the level of conflict in Lebanon remain low
 so that a Syrian-US or Syrian-Israeli confrontation is avoided.
 Moscow, however, cannot                 ns that could lead to
 escalation of the fighting.
 Israel's key goals in Lebanon are to guarantee the security of its
 northern border and to prevent the PLO and Syrians from
 establishing a presence in the south. The Israelis hope to avoid
 renewed military involvement north of the Awwali River, but they
 would respond to specific Syrian or Palestinian provocations with
 airstrikes or artillery and would not tolerate a Palestinian presence in
 the Shuf below the Damur River or a Syrian drive to Beirut. Israel
 would first try to intimidate Damascus, perhaps by threatening to
 move against Syrian forces in Lebanon, but ultimateiv      be
 prepared to move physically into the Shuf

 If the Gemayel government crumbles, Israel will look to the US to save
 it and will be extremely reluctant to intervene on its own. Nonetheless,
 a Syrian-inspired move against the Maronite heartland north of Beirut
 designed to cripple the Phalange would prompt Israeli intervention.

 Nonetheless, very real risks emerge from our involvement in
 Lebanon. For the Phalange and much of the Maronite community, the
 US is the latest in a series of foreign power patrons to be exploited in
 an effort to preserve Maronite hegemony. Deepening the American
 commitment to the Gemayel government may shore up central
 authority, but there is always the risk that it also will take the pressure
 off the Phalange for further concessions.
 Moreover, US involvement will continue to offer enormous
 opportunities for anti-American groups of every variety. Pro-Iranian
 Shias, Lebanese leftists, radical Sunnis, and Palestinians will have a
 ready target against which to vent their frustrations and carry out
 their antigovernment activities.
