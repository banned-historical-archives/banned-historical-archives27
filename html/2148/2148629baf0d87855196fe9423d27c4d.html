 COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY AND OUR PRACTICE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 17, 1 Sep 82 pp 2-8
 [Article by RED FLAG editorial department]
 [Text]  The 12th CPC National Congress has successfully opened.   This con-
 gress will hold higher the banner of communism, analyze and answer major
 problems cropping up in the new stage of socialist construction with com-
 munist ideology and further point the way forward for the communist move-
 ment during the period of socialism.  This is a congress of great historical
 and immediate significance.   In order to study, propagate and implement all
 the documents and decisions of the congress in, a satisfactory way, it is
 necessary, first of all, for us communists to study communist theory,
 enhance communist political consciousness, arouse our communist spirit and
 educate and unite the people: with this theory.
 What is communism?  Communist theory and practice have told us that com-
 munism is a twofold thing:  one is the communist social system and the other
 is the movement to realize communism.  As the ultimate goal of our party,
 communism refers to the communist social system.  Furthermore, to attain
 and realize the communist social system, it is necessary to pass through
 and depend on the communist movement.  Why is our party called the Com-
 munist Party?  This is because the goal of our struggle is a communist
 social system and our revolutionary practice is the communist movement.
 The Communist Party and communism are indivisible.   Without the Communist
 Party, there would be no communist movement and the realization of a com-
 munist system would be out of the question; moreover, the Communist Party
 would not be worthy of its name if it did not struggle for a communist
 social system and carry out the communist movement.  This is a most basic
 fact and also the most elementary knowledge.
 ,What kind of system is the communist social system?  Why does the Communist
 Party take it as its ultimate goal of struggle?  This is because the com-
 munist social system is the most progressive, rational and fine social
 system in human history.  In a communist society, classes and class differ-
 ences will be completely eliminated, all major social distinctions and
 inequalities will be abolished, the whole people will have highly advanced

 communist political consciousness and moral values, the social productive
 forces will be highly developed, social products will be extremely abundant,
 the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to
 his work" will be implemented, labor will become a pleasurable undertaking
 and everybody will really become a person who enjoys freedom and develops
 in an overall way.  It goes without saying that this is the happiest social
 system which has ever been seen in human history.  The oppressed and
 exploited proletariat and other working people yearn for this social system
 day and night and warmly cherish the ideal of it.  The Communist Party which
 takes the realization of the. communist social system as its ultimate goal
 entirely reflects and represents the fundamental interests and wishes of the
 proletariat and other working people.  This is an extremely great and lofty
 historical mission.
 Some people say that the communist social system is a "daydream" and a
 "utopia."  There have been people saying so ever. since Marx and Engels put
 forth the scientific communist doctrine.  Now there are still people saying
 so.  This is not in the least strange.  Among the people who say so are both
 bad and innocent people.  We must strike a resolute counterblow at the
 enemy who slander and abuse communism; with regard to those who are unaware
 of the truth or the well-intentioned skeptics, we must conduct painstaking
 persuasion and explanation work among them.  This is also extremely clear,
 definite and unequivocal.
 Communism has appeared in the form of a "daydream" or "utopia" in history.
 For example, the socialism and communism of Robert Owen, Claude Henri de
 Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier in the early 19th century were in such a
 category.  Owen and others criticized, censured and flung abuse at capitalist
 society and fancied that a better system would replace it.   However, they
 failed to indicate the real way out.  They not only failed to expound the
 nature of the capitalist system of wage slaves and bring to light the laws
 governing the development of capitalism but also failed to find out the
 social force to create a new society.  The proletariat was, in their eyes,
 only a class which was subject to suffering and hardship.  Therefore, their
 socialism and communism could be nothing but a "daydream."
 The emergence of utopian socialism and communism not only indicated the
 protest of the proletariat against capitalist oppression and exploitation
 but also reflected the immaturity of the proletariat, that is, the prole-
 tariat had not entered the historical stage as an independent political
 force at that time.  Engels pointed out:  "Immature theory is suited to the
 situation of immature capitalist production and of an immature class.  The
 solutions to social problems remain in the underdeveloped economic rela-
 tionships and thus they have to'come out of the brains.  What the society
 reflects is only drawbacks, and the elimination of these drawbacks is the
 task of thought.   This necessitates the invention of a new and more perfect
 social system and its imposition on society from outside through propaganda
 and typical demonstration if possible.  This new social system is doomed
 from the outset to become a daydream.  The more meticulously it is designed,
 the more it will degenerate into a sheer daydream."  ("Selected Works of
 Marx and Engels," Vol 3, p 299)

 In order to turn socialism and communism into a science, Marx and Engels put
 it on the basis of reality.  In accordance with historical materialism and
 the theory of surplus value which they founded, Marx and Engels regarded
 socialism and communism as the result of the development of the socioeconomic
 movement of modern capitalist society and as the inevitable outcome of the
 struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie rather than as the
 fortuitous discovery of some' geniuses.  The task of scientific socialism
 and communism is to study the economic course of the history which inevitably
 gave rise to these two classes and the struggle between the two, and to pro-
 ceed from the resulting economic and political circumstances to find the
 means to solve contradictions and conflicts rather than conjuring up a
 possibly perfect social system.  The communist social system emerges as the
 opposite of the capitalist social system.  It is the result of the function
 .of the social force brought about by capitalism.  Therefore, the basic
 characteristics of the communist social system can be logically brought to
 light from the inherent contradictions of the capitalist social system.  Of
 course, these characteristics can only be the general orientation and a
 rough.sketch and are not, and cannot, possibly be well conceived and
 detailed con,crete stipulations.
 Marx and Engels were absolutely loyal to their own scientific communist
 doctrine.  They always determined what could be determined in the light of
 actual conditions.  Just as Lenin said:  "There is no trace of an attempt.
 on Marx' part to make up a utopia or to indulge in idle guesswork about
 what cannot be known.  Marx treated the question of communism in the same
 way as a naturalist would treat the question of the development of, say,
 a new biological species, once he knew that it had originated in such-and-
 such a way and changed in such-and-such a definite direction."  ("Selected
 Works of Lenin," Vol 3, p 243)   It can thus be seen that the communist
 social system put forth by Marx and Engels is based on a host of absolutely
 true facts.   It has nothing whatsoever to do with a "daydream" or an
 "illusion."   If those who regard the communist social system as a "day-
 dream" or a "utopia" are not muddleheaded, they must have ulterior motives.
 Those who are muddleheaded will become politically awakened so long as they
 are willing to earnestly study the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin.
 We communists have never concealed our own political propositions.  Our
 ultimate goal is to be determined to make China advance to a communist
 society.   This is already fixed and admits of no doubt whatsoever. The
 name of our party and our Marxist world outlook already clearly point out
 this future, boundlessly bright and splendidly supreme ideal.  At present,
 we are unswervingly marching toward this goal.  No difficulties and
 obstructions can deter us.
 Communism is an undertaking throughout ages. The realization of a com-
 munist social system in any country cannot be accomplished in one move.
 It will always go through a long process of practice.  Without the
 unswerving disciplined hard work and heroic sacrifices of many generations,
 it is impossible for communism to make the transition from ideal to reality.

 it is precisely in this sense that communism is not only a social system
 but also a movement and above all a movement.  Marx and Engels pointed out
 long ago: "We call communism the real ["real" in boldface as published]
 movement which abolishes the present state of affairs."  ("Selected Works
 of Marx and Engels," Vol 1, p 40)
 The communist movement began the very day the Communist Party was founded.
 Internationally, the founding of the Communist League and the publication
 of the "Communist Manifesto" indicated the beginning of the communist
 movement.  The first remark of the "Communist Manifesto" which clarifies
 the purpose and main theme from the very beginning is that "a specter is
 haunting Europe--the specter of communism.  All the power of. old Europe
 has entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter:  pope and czar,
 Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police."  ("Selected
 Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 1, p 250)  The "specter" making all reac-
 tionary forces in Europe extremely frightened which Marx and Engels stated
 here means the communist movement.  With the spread of communist ideas in
 the 1870's there emerged the Paris Commune in France; at the beginning of
 this century, the October Revolution took place in Russia.  Neither of
 them practiced a communist social system but they undoubtedly all consti-
 tuted the great communist movement which was of far-reaching significance.
 The communist movement in China already has more than 60 years of history.
 From the day the CPC was founded, the CPC led the proletariat and the
 revolutionary people in embarking on the communist movement in the land of
 China in an organized and programmatic way.  During the 28 years before
 the founding of the PRC, although the struggle we carried out was the new
 democratic revolution with the spearhead of struggle being directed at
 imperialism,  feudalism and bureaucrat capitalism, it was an indispensable
 step in realizing communism in China and an important stage which we had to
 pass through.  Therefore, during this stage, we smashed the warlords,
 struggled against the landlords and shared out the land, fought a bloody
 battle against the Japanese imperialists and overthrew the reactionary
 and decadent Chiang [Kai-shek] dynasty.  All this constituted the communist
 movement.  Party members and the broad masses of the revolutionary people'
 carried'out a persistent and heroic struggle for the cause of communism and
 thousands upon thousands of revolutionary martyrs gave their lives for it,
 shouting the slogan of "Long live communism."  The struggle which we party
 members and party cadres carried out and the work which we did at our own
 posts constituted, in fact, a part of the great communist movement.  Our
 enemy was also perfectly clear about this matter.  At that time, they
 called our base areas the "communist-controlled areas."  It was justifiable
 for them to say so because our base areas were where we started the com-
 munist movement.  They called our army the "Communist Army."  That was also
 justifiable because our army was exactly an armed group which was engaged
 in the communist movement.
 However, some of our comrades find it hard to understand this matter.
 Regarding the new democratic revolution as a communist movement, as they
 see it, seems not to tally with Marxism.  Actually, they precisely forget
 Marxism.  Marx and Engels said:  "The communists struggle for the immediate

 goal and interests of the working class but concurrently represent the
 future of the movement."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 1,
 p 284)  They also pointed out:  "At the various stages of development
 traversed by the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the
 communists represent all along the interests of the whole movement."
 ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 1, p 264)  The historical facts
 are exactly like this.  The new democratic revolution led by our party was
 not only for the sake of the immediate goal and interests of the working
 class and other working people but more important, was also for the sake of
 the ultimate realization of communism in China.  Concerning this matter,
 our party's program has made quite clear statements.  Comrade Mao Zedong
 said:   "The Communist Party has an immediate and a future program, a mini-
 mum and a maximum program, with regard to the social system it advocates.
 For the present period, new democracy, and for the future, socialism; they
 are two parts of an organic whole, guided by one and the same communist
 ideology."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 2, p 647)  For this rea-
 son, winning victory in the new democratic revolution is only our minimum
 program and realizing communism is our maximum program.  Did we party mem-
 bers not all make a solemn vow to dedicate our whole lives to the realiza-
 tion of communism when we joined the party?   Is there not a phrase the
 "Internationale is bound to be realized" in the "Internationale" which we
 often sing with spirit?  That is to say, our ultimate goal is to realize
 communism.   In the course of the new democratic revolution, our party has
 educated thousands and tens of thousands of party members and advanced
 elements with this communist ideology to devote themselves to the noble
 cause of communism.  If it had not been for communist ideology that guided
 us in our struggle, we would not have been able to win complete victory in
 the new democratic revolution, let alone to realize the transition from new
 democracy to socialism.
 Since the founding of the PRC, the communist movement has been developing
 more vigorously in China.   Following the complete victory of the new demo-
 cratic revolution, our party led the people in completing the task of the
 socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of produc-
 tion, putting an end to the history of the exploiting classes and exploita-
 tive system which had existed for several thousand years in China and
 establishing brand-new socialist political and economic systems.   Then,
 our party again led the people in carrying out large-scale socialist con-
 struction.  Although in the course of construction we traversed a tortuous
 path, no one can obliterate the achievements scored in construction.  We
 have now entered a new historical stage.  The party is leading the whole
 party and the people of all nationalities throughout the country in carry-
 ing out the socialist modernization program in all spheres to build our
 country into a country with highly advanced material and spiritual civiliza-
 tion.  This is a grand-scale and far-reaching communist movement that has
 never been exceeded since the founding of our party.  The full-scale
 development and full maturity of this movement under socialism will bring
 us nearer and nearer to the ultimate goal of communism.   To fulfill this
 great task, we must hold high the banner of.communism, carry forward the
 communist spirit, and persist in carrying out the revolutionary struggle
 in all spheres until the supreme communist ideal is fully realized.  The

 "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the
 Founding of the PRC" adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
 Central Committee pointed out:  "This is a great revolution, unprecedented
 in human history.  Our present endeavor to build a modern socialist China
 constitutes but one stage of this great revolution."  This is the glorious
 task which history has entrusted to us.  All of us party members and party
 cadres must devote ourselves to doing-our bit for this great revolution.
 Differing from the communist movement during the period of the new demo-
 cratic revolution and also from that during the period of the transition
 from new democracy to socialism, the communist movement in which we are
 now engaged has its own characteristics.  With the establishment of a
 socialist social system, it has become a communist movement during the
 stage of socialist society.  At present, the conditions, whether objective
 or subjective, for us to struggle for the cause of communism are better
 than in any preceding period.  First, through several decades of the
 party's efforts to conduct propaganda and education, communist ideas have
 increasingly taken root in the hearts of the people, with more and more
 people believing in communism and fewer and fewer people doubting and even
 opposing communism.  Next, in the socialist society in which we live, there
 exist many communist factors.  With the continuous development of socialist
 society and the reinforcement of. education in communist ideas, there will
 surely emerge more communist new people and things.  Again, through the
 60-odd years, and particularly the last 30-odd years, of the communist
 movement since the founding of the PRC, our party has accumulated rich
 historical experiences, both positive and negative, and formulated entirely
 correct line, principles and policies which are suited to the state of
 things at the present stage.  In sum, as the primitive phase of communist
 society, the basic content of socialist society is to prepare both material
 and spiritual conditions for moving on to communist society.  This deter-
 mines the nature, orientation and tasks of the communist movement under
 socialism.
 The communist movement has more than 60 years of history in China.  That is
 to say, the communist ideolpgy founded by Marx and Engels has for more than
 60 years been tested by practice in China and has been proved, and will
 continue to be proved, to be an incomparably correct scientific truth.
 .However, when discussing the question that practice is the only criterion
 for testing truth in 1978, some comrades unexpectedly put forth the follow-
 ing argument:   Communism is a truth but it has not been tested in practice.
 It can therefore be seen that truth should not necessarily be tested by
 practice and practice is thus not the only criterion for testing truth.
 This is out-and-out nonsense.   The history of the practice of the communist
 movement in which our party has been engaged since its founding, as stated
 above, essentially refutes.this erroneous view.   Are all struggles which we
 carried out during the period of the new democratic revolution actually not
 the great practice of the communist movement?  Are the socialist revolution
 and socialist construction in which we have been engaged since the founding
 of the PRC not precisely the great practice of the communist movement?  If
 we say that communism has not been tested in practice, then what is the
 purpose of our holding meetings to sum up experience?  What is the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 fundamental nature of this experience?  By summing up experience, we mean
 summing up our experiences in practicing communism at the different stages
 of development, that is, the experiences in developing the communist move-
 ment.                 The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party"
 adopted by the enlarged 7th Plenary Session of the 6th CPC Central Com-
 mittee was the summarization of the practical experiences in developing the
 communist. movement during the 24 years after the founding of the CPC; and
 the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the
 Founding of the PRC" adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
 Central Committee was the summarization of the practical experiences in
 developing the communist movement during the 32 years since the founding
 of the PRC.  This shows that communism, this great truth, has for years
 experienced the test of historical practice in China.  Practice has proved
 it to such an extent that to this day every one of us can feel it in real
 life.   With regard to the future communist social system, we have not yet
 practiced it.  Marx and Engels made general assumptions on the communist
 social system.  The correctness of these assumptions, and in particular,
 whether or not they can be realized according to the ways and patterns
 which they assumed, needs of course to be tested in practice.  The comrades
 who put forth the above-mentioned erroneous argument do not refer to this
 point alone.   They fundamentally negate that communism is a process of
 practice.  In this way, they do away with the indispensable relationship
 between corm unism and practice.  Furthermore, doing away with this relation-
 ship will lead nowhere other than to an erroneous conclusion, that is,
 negating that all the revolutionary struggles we carried out in the past,
 and are carrying out at present, have the nature of putting.communism into
 practice, and as a result, negating that communism is a scientific truth
 and regarding it merely as a hollow and abstract belief.
 The communist movement,  from the outset, has been directed by communist
 ideology.  Without the communist ideological system founded by Marx and
 Engels, there would be no communist movement for us to speak of.  The com-
 munist movement, from a "specter" haunting Europe, has become, after the
 experience of 100-odd years, a great mass movement which is sweeping the
 world with tremendous momentum.  This is wholly due to the guidance of com-
 munist ideology.  The victory of the international communist movement is
 the victory of communist ideology and the victory of the Chinese communist
 movement is also the victory of communist ideology.
 It is no accident that communist ideology has unparalleled might.   Lenin
 pointed out:   "Communist theory--the science of communism created mainly
 by Marx, this doctrine of Marxism--has ceased to be the work of a single
 19th century socialist, even though he was a genius, and it has become the
 doctrine of millions and tens of millions of proletarians all over the
 world, who are applying it in their struggle against capitalism."   "That
 was because Marx based his work on the firm foundation of human knowledge
 acquired under capitalism.  After making a study of the laws governing the
 development of human society, Marx realized the inevitability of capitalism
 developing toward communism.  What is most important is that he proved this

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 on the sole basis of a most precise, detailed and profound study of this
 capitalist society by fully assimilating all that earlier science had
 produced."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 4, p 347)  He went on to say:
 "The Marxist doctrine is omnipotent because it is true.  It is comprehen-
 sive and harmonious, and provides men with an integral world outlook
 irreconcilable with any form of superstition, reaction, or defense of
 bourgeois oppression."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 2, p 441)  Communist
 ideology not only guides the communist movement but at the same time is
 also tested by the communist movement.  It advances with the development
 of the communist movement.  The more than half a century of the party's
 revolutionary practice has further developed Marxism-Leninism and enriched
 the contents of communist ideology which can thus more powerfully guide
 the communist movement.
 The communist movement led by our party has undergone many historical
 stages.  As we have mentioned above, what we are now engaged in has become
 the communist movement during the period of socialist society--the primi-
 tive phase of communism--rather than the communist movement in the general
 sense.  In accordance with historical experience, the strengthening of the
 guidance of communist ideology is even more necessary during the period of
 socialist society..  Just as without the Communist Party, socialism cannot
 be built, without communist ideology, it is impossible to build socialism.
 However, some people even go so far as to say that spreading communism and
 strengthening propaganda and education in communist ideas and ethics in
 the period of socialism is "transcending historical stages" and "contradic-
 tory to the policy of distribution according to work," and so on.  These
 viewpoints and arguments are utterly wrong.
 First, during the period of the new democratic revolution, we were already
 adhering to guiding all our work with communist ideology, standardizing the
 words and deeds of the party members and advanced elements, and spreading
 the communist spirit, such as serving the people wholeheartedly, "being
 selfless" and "utter devotion to others without any thought of self."  We
 have now entered the stage of socialist society--the primitive phase of
 communism--so why can we now not do so?  This cannot be explained away.
 Second, in socialist society, we resolutely uphold the implementation of
 the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to
 his work," continuously perfect it as a matter of policy and strive to
 overcome egalitarian drawbacks.  However, implementing this principle pre-
 cisely needs, rather than excludes, the encouragement of a communist atti-
 tude toward labor among the masses of people.   Party members and party
 cadres in particular must energetically engage in work without fixed quotas,
 regardless of remuneration and self, of their own accord and in the spirit
 of discharging their responsibilities for society to the best of their
 ability rather than confining themselves to the principle of "distribution
 according to work."  In fact., inside and outside the party there are people
 who are engaged in this noble labor in all matters.   Just imagine, can the
 advanced deeds of those who sacrifice themselves to save others, and par-
 ticularly the thoughts and actions of those who sacrifice their own happi-
 ness and even give their lives for the sake of safeguarding the motherland

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 and the lives and property of the people be explained by the principle of
 "distribution according to work"?  Upholding the principle of "distribution
 according to work" and encouraging the communist attitude toward labor are
 mutually complementary rather than being contradictory.  Encouraging a
 communist attitude toward labor and advocating handling various social
 relationships with communist ethics are the required conditions for ensur-
 ing the correct implementation of the principle of "distribution according
 to work" rather than obstacles to the implementation of the principle.
 Innumerable facts have shown that wherever education in communism is
 strengthened, the principle of "distribution according to work" is satis-
 factorily implemented, the enthusiasm of the people for labor is high, the
 people tackle difficulties themselves and make things easy for others, they
 work with one heart and one mind and help one another in unity; and wherever
 the education in communist ideas is discarded or weakened, there emerges
 the trend of "doing everything for the sake of money," the principle of
 "distribution according to work" turns into "working according to remunera-
 tion," with everyone haggling over every ounce and even "not working despite
 receiving remuneration," discipline becomes lax, dereliction of duty occurs
 and out-and-out egoism and anarchy run rampant.  These phenomena call for
 deep thought.
 Third, in socialist society, class struggle will continue to exist within
 certain limits for a long time to come and the corrosive influence and
 attacks of capitalist ideology are still very serious.  "Distribution
 according to work" is a socialist principle and is antagonistic to the
 capitalist principle of distribution.  However, facts have indicated that
 it is impossible to resist the corrosive influence and attacks of capital-
 ist ideology by relying on the principle of "distribution according to
 work" alone.   To effectively resist the corrosive influence and attacks of
 capitalist ideology, it is imperative to rely mainly on communist ideas.
 Some veteran party members and veteran cadres were not conquered by the
 enemy's force of arms during war years and were not compelled to submit by
 the despotic power of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary
 cliques during the 10 years of internal disorder.   They are worthy of the
 title of hero and fighter.   But they were defeated and became captives in
 the face of the corrosive influence and attacks of capitalist ideology.
 Where does the reason lie?   It is mainly because they have discarded
 communist ethics, lost the purity of communism, and forgotten and aban-
 doned their original intention of vowing to struggle for communism.   This
 lesson is quite profound.
 Theory and practice as well as history and reality tell us that in the
 socialist society, we must propagate communism boldly and forcefully.
 First we must teach all the party members and party cadres to preserve
 their own purity of communism, to standardize their words and deeds with
 communist ethics and observe and handle all matters with communist ideology.
 Then we should influence and'unite the broad masses of people through the
 model and vanguard role of all the party members and party cadres and,
 together with the masses of people, develop socialist spiritual. civiliza-
 tion with communist ideas as'its core and train the Chinese people into men
 with revolutionary ideas, revolutionary morality, revolutionary discipline

 and culture.  Only in this way, can the orientation of socialism be upheld
 and the modernization progran} be victorious.
 Of course, by adhering to guiding our actions and work with communist
 ideology during the period of socialism, by no means do we need to carry
 out immediately the policy of realizing top-level communism.  In the wake
 of the October Revolution, in the process of leading the socialist revolu-
 tion and construction, Lenin time and again stressed that the work of
 spreading communist ideas on the most extensive scale should be propagated,
 and he highly praised and warmly supported the communist factors and buds
 (such as "weekend voluntary labor") which emerged at that time.  At the
 same time, he again pointed out that the communist system should not be
 prematurely carried out, and held that it was harmful and dangerous to do
 so before the material basis was ensured for carrying out the communist
 system.  While leading the new democratic revolution in China, Comrade Mao
 Zedong also said:  "Beyond all doubt, now is the time to spread communist
 ideas more widely and put more energy into the study of Marxism-Leninism,
 otherwise we shall not only be unable to lead the Chinese revolution for-
 ward to the future stage of socialism, but shall also be unable to guide
 the present democratic revolution to victory.  However, we must keep the
 spreading of communist ideas and propaganda about the communist social
 system distinct from the practical application of the new democratic pro-
 gram of action; we must also keep the communist theory and method of
 investigating problems, undertaking research, handling work and training
 cadres distinct from the new democratic line for national culture as a
 whole.  It is undoubtedly inappropriate to mix the two up."  ("Selected
 Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 2, p 666)  We must firmly bear in mind and
 follow the principles concerning the relationship between communist
 ideology and existing policies, which were expounded by Comrades Lenin and
 Mao Zedong.  We are now in a stage of socialism.  As the primitive phase of
 communism, there are many communist factors in socialism and moreover it is
 advancing and developing toward its higher phase--communism--but there is,
 after all, a distinction between socialism and its higher phase--communism.
 In the past we paid a high price for mixing up and obliterating the demarca-
 tion line between the primitive and advanced phases of communism and being
 overanxious to overstep the primitive phase.   It goes without saying that
 this should not be repeated.  Therefore, during the period of socialism,
 we.must adhere to the guidance of communist ideology and strengthen the
 education in communist ideas and must not be vague and waver in the slight-
 est degree on this matter; at the same time, we must determine our poli-
 cies under the guidance of communist ideology and in light of current
 actual conditions and resolutely carry them out.   The argument and practice
 of mixing up the two different stages of development, socialist and com-
 munist, in the conditions of the present policies is wrong.   The argument
 and practice of approaching problems in an isolated and one-sided way,
 denying the nature of our socialist system as being the primitive phase of
 communism, and thus proceeding to deny the guidance of communist ideology
 and deny the practice of the communist movement guided by this ideology, is
 also wrong.  That is to say, we must conduct the struggle between two lines
 both in theory and practice.  On the one hand, we must not isolate socialism
 from communism and set the former against the latter in theory and practice

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 and negate the necessity of taking communist ideology as the guiding
 ideology in socialist society and on the other hand, we must also not mix
 up and equate socialism with communism in terms of the stage of develop-
 ments and must not carry out the policies of its higher phase--communism--
 in the period of socialism.  Only when this extremely important Marxist
 principle is effectively grasped and implemented, can it be ensured that
 our communist movement will consistently and healthily develop along a
 correct course.
 We should have the whole world in view and look forward to the future.
 With a rosy future, we are full of pride and enthusiasm.  Under the direc-
 tion of the line of the 12th national congress of the CPC, let us hold high
 the banner of communism and continuously push the communist movement during
 the period of socialist society forward to the long-range goal of communism
 in a down-to-earth and highly effective way.

 FURTHER PROMOTE THE SUCCESSION OF OLD CADRES BY NEW ONES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 17, 1 Sep 82 pp 9-11, 26
 [Commentator's article]
 [Text]  The succession of old cadres by new ones has been going on steadily
 and healthily since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,
 thanks to the exemplary role of the proletarian revolutionaries of the old
 generation in vigorously, patiently and carefully pushing forward the work
 in this respect.  This year, the CPC Central Committee has regarded stream-
 lining of the administrative structure.as a major task for the whole year,
 thereby greatly accelerating the progress of the succession of old cadres
 by new ones and making it possible for this succession to progress smoothly
 among the leading cadres of the central organs of the party and state.  Our
 current task is to further promote the succession of old cadres by new ones
 from the top downward and in an overall manner and to make this an important
 matter, a matter of strategic significance to our party's communist cause,
 to produce the desired results.
 The succession of old cadres by new ones means to build powerful, energetic
 leadership organizations fully capable of accomplishing socialist moderniza-
 tion and to set up leading groups which are more revolutionary, younger in
 average age, better educated and more professionally competent in all lead-
 ing organs of the party and state.   Specifically, this means that in the
 leading groups of the party and state at various levels, a number of old
 cadres will retire and at the same time a number of middle-aged and young
 cadres who have both ability and political integrity will be promoted to
 the leading posts.
 Because of historical reasons and other reasons arising from work, our ranks
 of cadres are faced with the question of the succession of old cadres by new
 ones.  At present, the leading organs of the party and state at various
 levels are vexed with the questions of "senility" and "inadequate knowledge."
 These questions are very serious in some localities.   In some leading organs
 of the party and state, there is an acute contradiction between these ques-
 tions and the demands put on leadership work during the new historical
 period.  This situation can be thoroughly changed by starting from the top
 down to promote the succession of old cadres by new ones.  Therefore, the
 succession of old cadres by new ones is not just a task for a few central

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 organs of the party and state but is a common task confronting the leading
 organs of the party and state at all levels.  Negligence of this question
 of succession will seriously impede the establishment of a leading group
 which is more revolutionary, younger in average age, better educated and
 mote professionally competent.  Now much headway has been made in the
 replacement work in the central party and state.  The replacement work will
 start soon in all leading organs of the party and state at the provincial,
 municipal, autonomous regional, prefectural and county levels.  Only when
 the replacement work has been accomplished by all leading organs ranging
 from the central to the grassroots levels in accordance with the plans and
 principles drawn up by the CPC Central Committee can we establish a power-
 ful, energetic leading body suited to the needs of the four modernizations.
 This is the only way to convince the cadres and the masses to minimize the
 obstacles of all kinds hindering replacement work and, subsequently, to
 accelerate progress in this work.
 The key to carrying out replacement work lies in the promotion of thousands
 of outstanding middle-aged and young cadres.   That is to say, it is impera-
 tive to promote hundreds of thousands and even millions of these cadres and
 absolutely not just a few or a few dozen of them.   For a long time in the
 past, in handling the question of promoting revolutionary successors, we
 held the wrong viewpoint that only a few people should be promoted.  We
 consciously or unconsciously linked the future development and the destiny
 of the proletarian revolution with only a few people and neglected the role
 of the vast number of cadres and the broad masses of people.  This method of
 thinking and work was incompatible with the principle of the proletariat.
 Our mistake taught us many lessons.  During the last few years of his life,
 Lenin did some hard thinking about a series of questions regarding the
 training of successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat.  Many
 of his valuable opinions still provoke our deep thoughts and serve as our
 guide today.   In a letter dictated by him to the congress in 1922, he first
 proposed increasing the number of Central Committee members.  As we see it
 today, the essence of this proposal was to train and cultivate large groups
 of successors to the revolution.  He held that this increase is good in that
 it might serve "a double or even a treble purpose."  He said:  "Such a
 reform would considerably increase the stability of our party" and "the
 stability of our party would gain a thousandfold."   ("Collected Works of
 Lenin," Vol 36, pp 615-616)  During the period of China's socialist con-
 struction, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out more clearly:   "In order to
 guarantee that our party and country do not change their political color,
 we must not only have a correct line and correct policies but must train
 and bring up millions of successors who will carry on the cause of prole-
 tarian revolution."   (Quoted from 14 July 1964 RENNIN RIBAO)  Undoubtedly,
 these opinions are very correct and we can learn from them the great
 importance of training and bringing up millions of successors to the revo-
 lution.   Today; our party has put forth that it is necessary to promote
 hundreds of thousands and even millions of middle-aged and young cadres.
 This is not only a summing-up of our party's experiences and lessons. on the
 question of succession but also a summing-up of the experiences and lessons
 on this question acquired in the international communist movement.   Our
 party is now leading the socialist modernization in a big country with a

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 population of 1 billion.  The socialist modernization is an extremely impor-
 tant stage of development in our entire historical course of achieving the
 great ideal of communism.  Whether for the purpose of guaranteeing the con-
 tinuity and stability of our party's line and policies, or for the purpose
 of preserving our party's purity of communism, or even for the purpose of
 accomplishing the various historical tasks at the present stage, it is
 necessary for us to promote middle-aged and young. cadres as an important
 task which should be carried out in a planned way.  The party's organiza-
 tional departments and the party and government organs at all levels should
 jointly carry out this task.  Any crude and careless styles of work and rash
 and arbitrary actions may lead to a new disaster.
 The most important point in promoting millions of middle-aged and young
 cadres is to consider their political qualities.  We must be vigilant
 against "three kinds of people."  That is to say, we must never promote
 those who rose to prominence by rebellion, those who displayed strong
 factionalism and those who indulged in beating, smashing and looting.  None
 of them should be promoted.  Those among them who have been promoted must be
 resolutely dismissed.  These "three kinds of people" are political dangers.
 Once leadership power is in their hands and the political climate is good
 for them, they will make trouble and again play the tricks of the "gang of
 four."  For this reason, before the middle-aged and young cadres are pro-
 moted, their behavior during the "Great Cultural Revolution" must be
 seriously considered.  At the same time, their political record after the
 downfall of the "gang of four" and in particular after the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee must be considered. Those who
 politically, ideologically and organizationally oppose the four basic
 principles, those who stubbornly resist the party's Marxist line, prin-
 ciples and policies and those who have committed serious political, economic
 and organization crimes must not be admitted into the leading groups.  Those
 who grovel at the feet of the capitalists and those who are interested in
 the capitalist tricks and hanker after the bourgeois way of life are degen-
 erates inside our ranks.  They will play an enormous role in eroding our
 party organizations and our revolutionary ranks.   Their serious danger
 should not be underestimated.  Those who are seriously imbued with selfish
 ideas, whose political qualities have always been undesirable and whose
 work is not motivated by principle must not be allowed to sneak into the
 leading groups.  We must specially emphasize that a party cadre, no matter
 how high his position and how important his work, must be a "servant of the
 people," treat others as equals and appear among the masses as an ordinary
 member of the working people.  He must remain humble and prudent, honest,
 open and aboveboard, energetic in work and must never exploit his office
 .to seek private gain and to profit at the expense of the masses and the
 state.   In his actions he must observe the revolutionary discipline,
 faithfully carry out the party's policies and keep in line with the CPC
 Central Committee.   He must not hesitate to sacrifice his all and to fight
 his whole life for the communist cause.  In short, our purpose of promoting
 middle-aged and young cadres is to make sure that there are successors to
 the cause of proletarian revolution and that the communist movement may be
 carried on generation after generation.  For this reason, the middle-aged
 and young cadres who are to be promoted must, first, have the political

 qualities of being loyal to the people and holding themselves responsible
 to the people and, second, are capable of serving the people.  That is to
 say, they must be both Red and expert and have both ability and political
 integrity. It is extremely wrong to promote a. cadre by seeing only that he
 is young and capable and without considering his political performance and
 quality.
 In promoting middle-aged and young cadres, special attention should be paid
 to promoting and using those who are intellectuals.  After the founding of
 the PRC and before the "Great Cultural Revolution," about 5 million intel-
 lectuals graduated from colleges and universities or attained equal educa-
 tional level'through private study.  They have already become the backbones
 in our country's socialist modernization.   Close attention should be paid
 to bringing their role into full play.  Facts have shown that in an enter-
 prise, department or locality, our work in all fields will develop if there
 is a group of "people in the know" who have special knowledge and are
 active in work and capable of maintaining ties with the masses.  We must
 understand that qualified personnel can be trained only by being boldly
 used and that experience can be accumulated only through practice.  The
 intellectuals' shortcomings should not be indiscriminately dealt with.   For
 example, arrogance certainly is a shortcoming which should be overcome.
 However, one who does not have a bit of confidence can achieve nothing.
 Moreover, some of the shortcomings of the intellectuals are caused by their
 being divorced from reality.  They can be corrected if the intellectuals
 are helped to maintain ties with the masses even though they may be holding
 some leading posts.  There are qualified personnel around.  They are before
 your eyes once you widen your field of vision.  Once the guidelines put
 forth by the CPC Central Committee are implemented, it is definitely possi-
 ble to discover and promote large groups of qualified or outstanding middle-
 aged and young successors.
 In short, to further promote the succession of old cadres by new ones, it
 is necessary to implement the CPC Central Committee's policy on the suc-
 cession of old cadres by new ones at all levels without exception, to pro-
 mote hundreds of thousands and even millions of middle-aged and young
 cadres and to closely consider the political qualities and performances of
 the middle-aged and young cadres to be promoted.  In this way, we can
 gradually, steadily and comprehensively accomplish the succession of old
 cadres by new ones and establish a leadership system suited to the tasks
 of socialist modernization.  This is a demand imposed on us by socialist
 modernization.  We must not even slightly slacken our efforts, hesitate and
 fall short of this demand.  Otherwise, our ardent wish and strategic plan
 for attaining our great goal at the end of this century will come to nothing
 because we have a weak leading group.
 The exemplary role, of the old comrades is of utmost importance in further
 promoting the succession of old cadres by new ones.  The old comrades are a
 valuable treasure of our party and state.   In the struggle to found and
 develop our state, they showed no fear of self-sacrifice and fought bravely,
 making tremendous contributions.  Now they will retire from their work posts,
 painstakingly select successors from among the middle-aged and young cadres,

 thus ensuring that the. ranks of cadres are more revolutionary, younger in
 average age, better educated and more professionally competent and that
 there are successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.   This is
 yet another historic contribution they make to the party.   It will be
 remembered forever by the future generations.  The realization of our great
 communist cause needs the arduous struggle and the continuous course of suc-
 cession of the old by the new throughout many, not just a few, generations.
 At all times and under all circumstances, a proletarian revolutionary
 fighter must never slacken his efforts but must struggle ceaselessly.  The
 old comrades understand that although they have now retired, their revolu-
 tionary spirit must never recede and they must still  carry out the work
 of passing on experience, giving help and setting examples in training the
 middle-aged and young cadres.  Only by doing this work well will they have
 contributed their last ounce- *of strength to the party and the revolutionary
 cause.  They also see this point very clearly:  They are old and weak.  They
 must live a few more years in order to contribute more to the party.  In
 order to live a few more years, they should do less work.  In this sense,
 doing less work means having more time for doing the work; doing more work
 means having less time for doing the work.
 All our comrades, the old ones in particular, must have a high sense of
 responsibility for the work of promoting the succession of old cadres by
 new ones and must be aware of the urgency with which this work should be
 done.  In fact, it is now time for solving without fail the problem of
 promoting middle-aged and young cadres, who have both ability and political
 integrity, to the leading posts at all levels and in various fields.  Mean-
 while, there are conditions for solving this problem.  In particular, prole-
 tarian revolutionaries of the older generation are still around, a large
 number of old comrades are consciously displaying their revolutionary
 spirit and playing an exemplary role, and a large number of middle-aged and
 young cadres have both ability and political integrity and are capable of
 shouldering the responsibility of inheriting the past and ushering in the
 future.   Our middle-aged and young cadres do not have so much revolutionary
 experience as the old cadres do.  However, generally speaking, they have
 been trained after the founding of the PRC and are better educated.  They
 also have acquired a great deal of experience in revolutionary work, thanks
 to their training in practical work for many years.  Judging by those who
 have been promoted to the leading posts, almost all of the middle-aged and
 young cadres are full of vigor and highly enthusiastic in their work and,
 with the help of the old comrades, can do their work competently..  There-
 fore, if we choose the right ones among them and if the old comrades do
 well their work of passing on experience, giving help and setting examples
 in training the new ones, the middle-aged and young cadres who have both
 ability and political integrity and who have been promoted can gradually
 assume the leadership work of the party and state at all levels.    We should
 have full confidence in them.
 From now on, the succession of old cadres by new ones should be gradually
 institutionalized.  That is to say, it is necessary to establish the cadres'
 retirement system and to abolish the de facto lifelong tenure of office of
 the leading cadres.  The establishment and application of this system are

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 of great significance to the building of our party and the development of
 the cause of proletarian revolution.  Facts tell us that the existence of
 the lifelong tenure of office of the leading cadres dampens the enthusiasm
 of the middle-aged and young cadres, causes, the gradual "senility" of the
 leading groups and leads to the "senile cycle."  Under these circumstances,
 our leading groups can hardly maintain their exuberant vitality and subse-
 quently our socialist modernization cannot be smoothly carried out, our
 state can hardly cope with the sudden changes in the international field
 and will have to face sudden social upheavals caused by the question of
 successors.  Precisely for this reason, after careful consideration, our
 party has determined to reform the present cadre system.  Of course, due
 to the present conditions in our cadre ranks, some transitional methods
 have to be adopted to gradually enforce the cadres' retirement system and
 to finally and completely abolish the de facto lifelong tenure of office
 of the leading cadres.
 The succession of old cadres by new ones has always been a major problem in
 our party.   Serious lessons on this problem have been learned. in the inter-
 national communist movement and in our party.  Now our party actively,
 systematically and methodically carries out replacement work within the
 cadre ranks.  This shows that the CPC has taken a step forward in becoming
 a mature, great party.  Under the leadership of this mature, great party,
 the succession of our old cadres by new ones can surely and triumphantly,
 be accomplished and our communist cause will definitely prosper and be
 carried on from one generation to the next generation.   There is no doubt
 whatsoever about this.

 THE DEEPLY RESPECTED COMRADE CAI CHANG
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 17, 1 Sep 82 pp 12-16, 32
 [Article by Ou Mengjue [0575 1125 6030]]
 [Text]  Comrade Cai Chang is a proletarian revolutionary of the elder gen-
 eration, an outstanding leader of the women's movement of our country, and
 a noted activist in the international progressive women's movement.  She is
 deeply beloved and respected by the people.  As early as in early 1926 I had
 the privilege of making her acquaintance.  Since then, for more than 50
 years, I have worked alongside her on various occasions.  She has greatly
 impressed me with her affectionate concern and patient teaching.  She was
 and is my good teacher.  When I heard and read the message of greeting
 extended to her by the 7th Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Com-
 mittee, I was greatly excited.  Each and every word of the message brought
 to me a reminiscence of the past.
 Comrade Cai Chang always stood at the forefront of the struggle in the vari-
 ous historical stages of the country's revolution.   In this way, she has
 made an immortal contribution to the revolutionary course of the proletariat.
 Truly, she was the most outstanding feminine revolutionary of our party.
 Comrade Cai's native place is Yongfeng village of Xiangxiang County (now
 known as Shuangfeng County), Hunan Province.  Quite a number of relatives
 of her family are known to have sacrificed their lives for the sake of the
 revolution.  Her mother, Ge Jianhao, was a revered old lady who was always
 keen for advancement, progressive in thinking, and imbued with a determined
 fighting spirit..  Her elder brother Cai Hesen was one of the leaders of our
 party in its initial stages and was an outstanding proletarian revolutionary
 and theorist.  He was killed in 1931 by the Kuomintang reactionaries.  Her
 sister-in-law Xiang Jingyu was also one of the leaders of our party during
 its early stages.  She was an outstanding leader of the feminist movement.
 She was killed in 1928 by the KMT reactionaries.   She had another brother,
 Cai Luxian, a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy and a member of the
 Communist Party.  During the big Guangzhou-Hong Kong strike he acted as the
 commander of the Workers!_Picket Corps.  He was killed in the course of the
 struggles.  Comrade Cai Chang was brought up in a family environment of this
 nature.

 In her early youth, under the influence of Mao Zedong, Cai Hesen and Xiang
 Jingyu, Comrade Cai Chang took part in various progressive campaigns such
 as the May 4th movement, and in this way received new ideas and new culture.
 Before and after the May 4th movement, Mao Zedong, Cai Hesen and others
 started a movement to organize young Hunanese to study in France as students
 under the part.-work and part-study system.  Xiang Jingyu and Comrade Cai
 Chang jointly organized an association of Hunanese girl students for the
 same purpose.  From 1920 to 1924, Comrade Cai Chang was in France studying
 in such a capacity.   She was able to mingle well with Chinese workers and
 French workers.  She studied diligently the French language and various
 Marxist-Leninist publications such as the "Communist Manifesto."  She was
 an active participant in such movements as the "28 February" movement under
 the leadership of Comrade Cai Hesen and the "Reject Indemnity" and "Occupy
 the Sino-French University of Lyons" movements led by Comrades Cai Hesen,
 Zhou Enlai, Zhao Shiyan, and others.  In 1920, she became a member of such
 progressive bodies as the New People's Study Society, and the Workers'
 World Study Society.   In 1922, she joined the China Socialist Youth League
 (European Branch).  The following year, through the introduction of Comrade
 Zhao Shiyan.and Liu Bojian, she became a regular member of the Communist
 Party of China (European Branch).   In 1924, she was sent to the Soviet Union
 by the party organ to study at the Eastern University in Moscow.
 There she made a more intensive study of Marxism-Leninism and the experi-
 ences of the Soviet Union's socialist revolution.
 While Comrade Cai Chang was studying in the Soviet Union, a new revolu-
 tionary high tide was surging in China.  To meet urgent needs, the party
 organization transferred her back to China.  In August 1925, she arrived at
 Guangzhou and took part in the Northern Expedition.  She served as assistant
 secretary and then secretary of the Women's Committee of the Guangdong-
 Guangxi CPC Committee.  That period was the first period of KMT-CPC coopera-
 tion.  The party sent her to serve as a cadre in the Central Women's
 Department of the Kuomintang and concurrently as the dean of the Research
 Institute of the Central Women's Movement, helping He Xiangning, head of
 the department, to promote the women's movement.  As a result of efforts
 rendered by He Xiangning, Deng Yingchao, and herself, the women's movement
 in Guangdong enjoyed rapid development.   Following the start of the Northern
 Expedition, Comrade Li Fuchun became the party representative of the 2d Army.
 She likewise followed the troops northward to Nanchang and took part in
 political work in the army as well as in the women's movement of Jiangxi
 Province.  Soon afterwards, she arrived in Wuhan and became the head of the
 Women's Department of the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee.  In April 1927,
 she attended the fifth party congress.
 The failure of the great revolution caused the death of thousands of Com-
 munist Party members.  Comrade Cai Chang then proceeded to Shanghai, the
 city of White terror, to engage in underground work.  She led the strikes
 of the women workers in the Huxi Cotton Mill and the Zhabei Silk Factory.
 In June 1928, she attended the sixth party congress in Moscow and also
 attended the sixth congress of the Communist International.  Afterwards,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 she traveled back and forth between Hong Kong, Shanghai and other places to
 continue to engage in the party's underground work.
 At the end of 1931, Comrade Cai Chang proceeded from Shanghai to the central
 revolutionary base.  At first she worked at the Political Department of the
 Ruijin Red Army Academy.  She personally lectured on the history of social
 development to army cadres.  The cadres who attended her lectures can still
 recollect that Comrade Cai Chang's lessons and lectures were impressive and
 moving, made people increasingly interested and enabled them to learn many
 of the truths of Marxism.  Afterwards, she journeyed to places such as
 Xingguo and Ningdu and became the head of the Organizational Department of
 the Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee, concurrently head of the women's
 department, chairwoman of the supervisory committee for industry and agri-
 culture of Jiangxi Province, and so on.  Subsequently, she took part in
 the world-famous 25,000-li Long March.
 At the end of the Long March, Comrade Cai Chang at first worked in the
 Shaanxi and Gansu provincial CPC committees.  She served as the head of the
 united front department, head of the organization department and secretary
 of the Zhongxin County party committee. Afterwards when in 1941 the party
 Central Committee reorganized the Central Women's Committee, she succeeded
 Wang Ming and served as acting secretary of the Central Women's Committee.
 She was generally responsible for promoting women's participation in the
 anti-Japanese struggle.  In April 1945, she attended the seventh party
 congress and was elected a member of the Central Committee.  In the same
 year, she was elected head of the Women's Union of China's Liberated Areas.
 Following the triumphant conclusion of the anti-Japanese war, Comrade Cai
 Chang left Yanan and arrived'at the northeast China liberated zone.   She
 continued in her capacity as secretary of the CPC Central Women's Committee
 and concurrently served as the secretary of the Northeast China Bureau
 Women's Committee.  She organized the vast masses of women to take part in
 the war of liberation.   Following the peaceful liberation of Beijing, she
 organized and took charge of the convening of the First All-China Women's
 Congress.  She was elected chairwoman of the All-China Democratic Women's
 Union.
 After liberation, Comrade Cai Chang, in her capacity as chief representa-
 tive of the All-China Women's Union, took part in.the first session of the
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.   She was elected a
 member of the central people's government.  She served as first secretary
 of the Women's Committee of the CPC Central Committee and continued to act
 as the chairwoman of the All-China Women's Union.  Furthermore, she was
 successively a member of the 8th to 11th CPC Central Committees and was
 also the vice chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the 4th and 5th
 National People's Congresses.   She thus worked wholeheartedly and dili-
 gently for the party and the people.
 In the course of our party's various struggles against erroneous thinking,
 Comrade Cai Chang was unwavering in her stand.   She spontaneously supported
 the correct line held by Comrade Mao Zedong and other comrades. During the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 period of the first KMT-CPC cooperation, Chiang Kai-shek singlehandedly
 engineered the "Zhongshan gunboat incident" and brought forth the "party
 reform program" in an endeavor to attack the Communist Party and break the
 KMT-CPC cooperation.  Comrade Cai Chang maintained the same stand as Mao
 Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Chen Yannian and other comrades and was firmly deter-
 mined to strike back at Chiang Kai-shek.  Both before and after the
 "April 12th" and "July 15th" counterrevolutionary incidents, as well as
 at both the fifth and sixth party congresses, she was firmly opposed to
 the errors of Chen Duxiu's rightist capitulationism toward the Kuomintang's
 rightist elements.  During the anti-Japanese war, she continued her deter-
 mined opposition to Wang Ming's "leftist" and rightist errors.  All this
 fully demonstrates her allegiance to the basic principles of proletarianism.
 During her several decades of revolutionary struggles, Comrade Cai Chang
 insisted on learning and researching on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong
 Thought.   She was extremely loyal to the party and to the revolutionary
 cause.  Toward the elder revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai,
 Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De and others., she harbored deep proletarian feelings.
 Over several decades, she offered her entire energy to the party.  For this
 reason, she won high respect from the entire Chinese people and even people
 of the entire world.  Just as Miss Ning Mo Wei Er Si [1337 6206 7279 1422
 2448] wrote in her book "Recollections of the Westward Journey (Continued)":.
 Cai Chang is "China's leading female communist member," "the most active
 female revolutionary," and a "superior female revolutionary."
 From the time of the Northern Expedition to after the liberation of the
 whole country, Comrade Cai Chang devoted herself to the women's movement
 under the leadership of our party.  In fact, she has persevered for over
 half a century in the struggle for the complete liberation of Chinese women
 and the development of the progressive women's movement of the world and
 has made enormous contributions thereto.
 First, she has faithfully followed and carried out the party's line for the
 women's movement and firmly insisted on the direction of the women's move-
 ment of the proletariat.  As early as in the Northern Expedition, Comrade
 Cai Chang led the Guangdong Provincial Federation for Women's Liberation to
 struggle against the women's organizations of the rightist elements of the
 Kuomintang.  She clearly pointed out that the "liberation of women must
 join forces with the national revolution and with the liberation of the
 working class," and in this way put the women's movement on the right track.
 In her article "The Russian Revolution and Women," she introduced the
 experiences of the women's movement in Russia.   She pointed out:   "The
 laboring women's movement is part and parcel of the entire proletarian
 movement."  The women's movement must be linked with the liberation cause
 of the proletariat to become a "new contingent" of the proletariat.  Only
 in thoroughly overthrowing the exploitation system and establishing the
 proletariat's own political control and domination can we talk about a real
 women's movement.  She sounded the call:  "If the Chinese women want a
 thoroughgoing liberation, the only way is to unite themselves and actively

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 take part in the revolutionary movement."  It may be said that from the
 beginning, our party's women's movement, under the leadership of comrades
 such as Xiang Jingyu, Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao and others, has followed the
 correct track of the proletariat.  During the anti-Japanese war, the
 women's work of the party was under the leadership of Wang Ming who called
 in vain slogans such as "economic independence," "freedom of marriage,"
 "opposition to the fourfold oppression," and so forth, but failed to
 organize women to take part in actual production and in revolutionary
 struggle.  In this way, the women's movement segregated itself from the
 populace, fell into formalism, and took the wrong direction.  Endeavoring
 to rectify Wang Ming's errors, Comrade Mao Zedong issued the call to
 organize women to take part in production and to render aid to the front.
 In 1943, based on this spirit, Comrade Cai Chang drafted for the Central
 Committee a "resolution on the guideline for women's work in the various
 anti-Japanese base areas."  Comrade Mao Zedong carefully edited each and
 every word of the draft resolution.  This was subsequently known as the
 "1943 Resolution."  The resolution pointed out that for women to take part
 in economic work constituted the "most suitable work for women" and the
 "central link in protecting women's own interests," and would be equivalent
 to the same "glorious task" as the warriors fighting on the front line.
 The resolution clearly pointed out that this should be the "new direction of
 women's work in the various anti-Japanese base areas."  In addition, Comrade
 Cai Chang personally wrote an important article entitled "Greetings to the
 New Direction in Women's Work."  The article propagandized and explained in
 detail the "1943 Resolution."  She thus devoted her utmost efforts to the
 thoroughgoing adoption and execution of this resolution.  After that, Wang
 Ming's erroneous guideline was discredited and the "1943 Resolution" has
 guided the women's movement of our country ever since.  Comrade Cai Chang
 was truly a glorious standard-bearer of the women's movement in China.
 Second, she organized and led the vast women's masses to participate in the
 revolution and production.  During the period of the Northern Expedition, I
 worked beside her and saw with my own eyes how she led the work of the
 Women's Liberation Federation of Guangdong Province, how she organized the
 formation of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Joint Association of Women Workers on
 Strike, and how she efficiently handled the convening of a large-scale
 Guangzhou-Hong Kong Congress of Women Workers.   At her recommendation, and
 with the approval of Minister He Xiangning, the women workers on strike in
 these two localities successively organized factories to produce reed
 sandals, sewing plant and knitwear plants.  Women were also mobilized to
 solicit contributions to help solve the financial difficulties of workers
 on strike.   Thus valuable support was given to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong
 strike and the way was cleared for mobilization and preparation for the
 Northern Expedition.   In the central revolutionary base areas, for the sake
 of mobilizing women to take part in production and to support the war, she
 took the lead in going out to the field and broke the feudal superstition
 that "women who dare plow the fields will be struck dead by a thunderbolt."
 She thus succeeded in organizing the womenfolk into a huge army of workers.
 During the anti-Japanese war` and the war of liberation, under the party's
 leadership, the women's movement particularly prospered and grew, and much
 of this was due to Comrade Cai Chang's immortal contributions.  At that

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 time, it was found that in the liberated areas the vast masses of women were
 busily occupied in one or anqther of the following pursuits:  Taking part
 in production to support the war; or going directly to the frontline to
 slaughter the enemy; or bidding farewell to husband or son who were joining
 the armed forces; or serving as stretcher bearers or nurses attending to the
 wounded; or, behind the enemy lines, engaging in guerrilla warfare,
 strengthening the defenses and clearing the fields and working together
 with the civilian armed forces to resist and break the enemy's "mopping-up"
 campaigns; or taking part in suppressing bandits, resisting unruly elements,
 engaging in land reform and staging struggles against reactionary land-
 lords, and so on.  After liberation, the women of our country continued to
 display the traditions of the war years.  On the socialist revolutionary
 and construction fronts, their activities literally covered "half the sky."
 This, in effect, was indivisible from the efforts made by Comrade Cai Chang.
 Third, she trained up many women cadres and promoted the development of
 nursery enterprises. In Comrade Cai Chang's understanding, the development
 of the women's movement in our country required the existence of a large
 force of women cadres who were both virtuous and talented.  As early as in
 1926 during the Northern Expedition, she already paid great attention to
 the training of women cadres.   She took charge of the setting up of train-
 ing schools for the women's movement.   She trained a number of women cadres
 who were subsequently sent to various parts of the country and became the
 backbone force of the revolution.  Wherever she went, she showed intimate
 concern for the interests of women and gave her support to struggles such
 as those against feudal oppression, fighting for freedom of marriage and
 claiming equality between the sexes.  She actively encouraged women to
 leave their homes in order to take part in revolutionary work.  She
 fervently helped them to acquire culture and learning and to raise their
 political consciousness and thus to create conditions for their participa-
 tion in the revolution.  Many cadres have subsequently become the party's
 leading cadres thanks to her, concern and encouragement.   Even today many
 comrades can be found who have benefited from her teaching and who would
 fondly point her out as the first teacher ever to guide them to take part
 in the revolution.   In the actual revolutionary struggle, Comrade Cai Chang
 managed to summarize a set of experiences in cadre training.  She said:  We
 must systematically train up party and nonparty women cadres.  Women cadres
 must be discovered and trained up amid struggle.  While we must pay great
 attention to giving vital training to comrades from families of industrial
 workers or peasants, we should not confine ourselves to the theory of the
 unique importance of class origin.  We must boldly select people who are
 "upright, good in labor, can unite the populace, and dare to struggle" and
 people who are both virtuous and capable.  We must pay attention to train-
 ing up women cadres who belong to the intelligentsia while, for those women
 .cadres who already possess a known degree of intelligence and technology,
 we should guide them to do more intensive study and research so as to become
 specialists.  As to the method of training,.we can set up cadre schools, or
 short-term'training classes, or let the elder or more experienced people
 teach the new.  These experiences summarized by Comrade Cai Chang are still
 very valuable today.  In May 1949, Comrade Cai Chang gave her vigorous
 support to the establishment of an All-China Training School for Women
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 Cadres.  This school exists even now (although classes were interrupted for
 a brief period) and has trained up for the various localities a large num-
 ber of women cadres.  At the eighth party congress, she delivered a speech
 on "Actively Training and Promoting More and Better Women Cadres."  In the
 speech, she specially dwelt on the importance of selecting, training and
 promoting women cadres and on the method of training these cadres.
 Concurrently with actively tVainjng up women cadres, Comrade Cai Chang's
 attention was also directed at children's welfare.  She was particularly
 concerned with the orphans of martyrs and took a special interest in foster-
 ing successors to the revolution.  During the Yanan period, through Comrade
 Cai Chang's efforts, Yanan's first nursery school was established.  It pro-
 vided care and education to many of the martyrs' children and cadres'
 children.  Following the martyrdom of Comrades Zhang Tailei, Guo Liang,
 Cai Hesen and Xiang Ying, she was extremely concerned with the well-being
 of their children and with their subsequent education and growth.   When she
 was convalescing in Moscow, she paid frequent visits to the international
 nursery to see the Chinese children entrusted to its care.  The children
 themselves were very fond of her and affectionately called her "Mother Cai."
 In audition, she set up nursery classes to train up cadres for children's
 welfare and devoted much effort to bringing up the revolution's younger
 generation.
 Fourth, she committed herself to the international democratic women's move-
 ment, extended the influence of the Chinese revolution to the international
 front, and rendered aid to the struggle for liberation of the world's women
 workers.  At the end of World War II, on 1 December 1945, the International
 Democratic Women's Union was established with the purpose of establishing
 everlasting peace and strengthening the friendship and unity of women all
 over the world.  At the end of that year, the Women's Union of China's
 Liberated Areas became a member of the International Women's Union.   In
 1946, Comrade Cai Chang was elected a director of the International Demo-
 cratic Women's Union and in the following year was elected vice president.
 In November 1948, when the Second International Women's Congress was con-
 vened in Budapest, Hungary, Comrade Cai Chang led a delegation of China's
 women representatives to take part in the congress.  This writer happened
 to be a member of the delegation to Hungary.  Comrade Cai Chang delivered a
 speech at the congress.  She analytically explained the relationship
 between the proletarian revolution and women's liberation and systematically
 told the congress the state of development, role and experience of China's
 revolutionary women's movement.  In great anger, she unveiled and con-
 demned the atrocities of the American soldiers and the Kuomintang reac-
 tionaries in exploiting, oppressing and inhumanly trampling on the rights
 of womenfolk in the KMT-dominated areas.  Her speech won deep sympathy and
 support for the Chinese women from the delegate-s in attendance.  In the
 early period of the formation of the PRC, our country was entrusted by the
 International Democratic Women's Union to handle the preparatory measures

 revolution, in this way expanding the influence of the Chinese revolution,
 strengthening China's international status, and winning honor and glory
 for Chinese women.  At the same time, the development of the international
 progressive women's movement-was fostered.
 The whole people and people of the entire country loved and respected Com-
 rade Cai Chang because of her determined and firm party "character,"
 elegant personal integrity and high moral character.  Truly, she is a
 superior representative of the proletariat.  Her many virtues constitute
 indeed a valuable spirit and wealth for eternally. educating the millions
 of party members and people.  Our Chinese women take great pride in having
 amidst them such an outstanding proletarian woman revolutionary.
 Comrade Cai Chang has a deep faith in communism.   Imbued with this faith,
 she has worked relentlessly for the revolution and never paused for a moment
 in the endeavor.  Over several decades of struggle, she has from beginning
 to end demonstrated an unyielding, indomitable, resolute and determined
 revolutionary spirit.  In her family alone, several members have already
 fallen victim to the reactionaries' ruthless slaughter, but she was never
 frightened.  What she did was to bury the dead, take over their baton and
 flag and continue determinedly with the struggle.  While engaging in
 underground work in the White-terror stricken cities like Shanghai,
 Guangzhou and Hong Kong, she was always in danger of being caught or killed
 but she was never mindful of her own safety.   In the Long March, she scaled
 snowy mountain tops or crossed the grassland and all the time insisted on
 doing propaganda and promotion work and on toiling along with the populace.
 Sometimes when the comrades were fatigued, she would loudly sing the
 "Internationale" or the "Marseillaise" thus imparting faith and strength
 to the populace and fully demonstrating the steel-like aspirations of
 Communist Party members.  In the 10 years of internal disorder, Comrade Li
 Fuchun suffered humiliations of various sorts and was branded as "going
 against the current," or being a "black ringleader."  She herself was
 implicated.  But even in such circumstances, she and Comrade Li Fuchun
 never forgot to study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  They would talk
 about the party's history with other comrades to augment their faith in the
 party.  Mao Zedong said:   Comrade Cai Chang is an honest person.  This gave
 her much encouragement.
 In 1973, a tea party was held in the Great Hall of the People in celebra-
 tion of the 8 March International Women's Festival.   Comrade Zhou Enlai
 specially invited her to be present and warmly praised her in the course of
 the party.  On her 80th birthday, Deng Xiaoping, Deng Yingchao, Kang Keqing,
 Zhuo Lin and other comrades went to her residence to offer their congratu-
 lations.  Comrade Nie Rongzhen additionally brought her a gift, a Chinese
 potted landscape adorned with a miniature evergreen tree.  All of them con-
 veyed the party's warm feelings and concern, in the hope that she would
 live comfortably in her last years.

 When Comrade Cai Chang was still young, she saw with her own eyes such
 scenes as communist intellectual elements like Mao Zedong, Cai Hesen and
 others, with only an umbrella and a pair of sandals but not a cent in
 their pocket going about everywhere, penetrating deep into the peasant
 villages to do investigation work and fraternizing with the workers and
 peasants.  This deeply impressed on her that in revolution if you do not
 go deep among the masses and'if you segregate yourself from the realities
 of China, then the revolution can hardly succeed.  Since taking part in the
 revolution, she has taken such people as Mao Zedong, Cai Hesen and others as
 a model, gone deep into the worker and peasant masses and engaged in
 research and investigation work.  In Guangzhou, at the time of the Northern
 Expedition, she frequently visited factories, rural villages and schools to
 do investigation and publicity work, encouraging the workers in the work.
 When doing underground work in Shanghai, she went deep among the worker
 masses.  As a result, the attempts of the reactionaries to arrest her were
 foiled more than once.  In.the central revolutionary bases, she was entirely
 one of the masses.  She would labor like the masses and intimately coached
 them in culture and learning.  She penetrated deep into the families of the
 masses to learn the real situation and to do ideological work.  In 1941
 when she took up the post of acting secretary of the Central Women's Com-
 mittee, she at once dispatched investigation and research teams to the
 counties and municipalities in the Shaan-Gan-Ning [Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia]
 border area.  Comrade Mao Zedong's article "On Investigation in Rural
 Villages," was based on talks with the investigation teams at that time.
 This was Comrade Cai Chang's way of insisting on penetrating deep into a
 subject and learning the facts from all sides and then proceeding to shape
 the guideline for work in accordance with the actual conditions.  This
 completely rectified Wang Ming's vulgar work style of formalism, objec-
 tivism, and doctrinairism.  In 1942 a special issue of the Yanan JIEFANG
 RIBAO carried a reprint of Mao Zedong's caligraphy which urged "going deep
 among the masses and avoiding empty talk."  These Chinese characters
 represented warm coaching to the women's work under the leadership of
 Comrade Cai Chang.  They vividly described just what she was doing.
 Comrade Cai Chang is a friendly and amiable person.  Before her comrades
 and her subordinates she is untiring in her persuasion and has the utmost
 patience in doing educational work.   She stands on principle and makes
 rigid demands.  At the same time, she is friendly and always endeavors to
 unite comrades together.  In my recollection, she would always meet people
 with a smiling face.  I never had any occasion to see her angry.  She has
 the tender heart of an affectionate mother.  She treats comrades sincerely,
 warmly and straightforwardly, and is always glad to help others.  To
 brothers and sisters of other classes, she is full of affectionate senti-
 ments.   I remember that on one occasion in Guangzhou, a peasant girl by
 the name of Cheng Furu left her home to escape from a mercenary marriage.
 Comrade Cai Chang gave the girl refuge in her own home.  She helped her to
 solve her living problems.  'Following patient educational work, this girl
 was finally converted to the path of revolution and eventually joined the
 Communist Party of China.   In Yanan, many leading cadres lived near her
 cave.  Whenever there was a family dispute, she was invited to mediate.
 Everybody treated her as an intimate acquaintance.  Just because of her

 possession of such qualities, within our party she has won everybody's
 respect.  The entire party all fervently called her "Big Sister Cai."
 Comrade Cai lives strictly within her means and lives very frugally.  This
 has always been her style, be it in war years or in peacetime.  When doing
 underground work in Shanghai, she worked very hard every day.  Besides, she
 suffered then from a stomach ailment and occasional headaches.  She did not
 have the heart to spend her money and preferred to economize on food and
 clothing. She put aside Comrade Fuchun's meager salary and eventually
 contributed the money to the party's coffers to serve as party expenses.
 After liberation, she and Comrade Fuchun continued to live frugally.  Even
 now she wears clothes from the 1950's.   The savings from her and Comrade
 Fuchun's salaries were not accumulated or reserved for their children on
 their younger generation.  Rather, the whole of the savings was contributed
 to the party.   Following the death of Comrade Fuchun, she contributed a sum
 of 100,000 yuan under her name and Comrade Fuchun's name to the party as
 "party fees."   In fact, several years earlier, she had already contributed
 30,000 yuan for the same. purpose.  She has always felt that the party had
 given her much but she had contributed little in return and that therefore
 she must devote her entire efforts to the service of socialist construc-
 tion.
 Comrade Cai Chang has never been proud or arrogant.  Rather, she has always
 been modest and cautious.   She herself-is a superior woman revolutionary
 while her brother Cai Hesen, sister-in-law Xiang Jingyu and her husband Li
 Fuchun were all noted leaders in the party.  However, she has never publi-
 cized herself or her family members.  On one occasion, a correspondent of
 ZHONGGUO FUNU [CHINESE WOMEN] magazine visited her and asked for informa-
 tion about her past history and family background.   She courteously rejected
 the request.   In her estimation, revolution is the people's undertaking.
 We should propagandize the party and the people and should not heap the
 achievements on any one individual'q account.  This is indeed a lofty virtue
 of a Communist Party member.  Although for a long time she has occupied a
 leadership position in the party and in the government, she and Comrade
 Fuchun never once utilized their power and position for private gain.  Nor
 did they allow their relatives, friends or children to do so.  She has
 always maintained the "color" or lifestyle of a public servant of the
 people.   She has a strict organizational concept, has always spontaneously
 taken part in organizational life., paid the party fees on due time, and
 rigidly observed the party's security protection system and various kinds
 of disciplinary codes.  What she wants for her children is especially stern
 and demanding.   She sent her only daughter to study agricultural technology
 in the Soviet Union so as to devote her life to the reorganization of
 China's backward agriculture.   One of her grandchildren was staying with
 her, but she made him take his meals in the public canteen for staff and
 workers.  She also made him take part in the labor and in production.  She
 always taught him to learn from the workers and peasants and to make
 friends with the latter's children.

 In recent years, she wholeheartedly responded to the party's call to
 abolish the lifelong tenure system for leadership cadres.   She wrote on
 various occasions to the party and the state to offer her resignation from
 her party and government posts, in order to better train up her successors.
 In 1978, she relinquished the post of president of the All-China Women's
 Union.   In September 1980, she was no longer the vice chairwoman of the
 National People's Congress.  This year, she no longer took part in the
 party's 12th national congress and resigned from all her party posts.  Her
 action fully demonstrated an old Communist Party member's breadth of vision
 and earned her even greater respect from the whole party and whole people.

 THE 3D PLENARY SESSION OF THE 11TH CPC CENTRAL COMMITTEE CREATES A NEW PATH
 FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN OUR COUNTRY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 17, 1 Sep 82 pp 17-21
 [Article by Zhan Wu [6124 2970] and Liu Wenpu [0491 2429 3877]]
 [Text] Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, a
 profound change has taken place in the features of the countryside and an
 excellent situation of unprecedented vitality has appeared.   This is mani-
 fested by an all-round development in agriculture, forestry, animal hus-
 bandry, sideline production and fishery, and a big and extensive increase
 in production.  Between 1979 and 1981, the average annual growth of 5.6.
 percent in gross agricultural output value surpassed the average annual
 growth rate of 4.4 percent between 1950 and 1981.  There was a pronounced
 improvement in the living standard of the peasants.  The net income of
 peasant households showed an unprecedented average growth rate of 18 per-
 cent between 1979 and 1981.  The proportion of affluent production brigades
 with an average per capita income of more than 150 yuan from collective
 distribution rose from 3.8 percent in 1978 to 15.6 percent in 1981.  A
 large number of communes and production brigades began to shake off the
 condition of economic backwardness, straitened circumstances and lack of
 initiative among commune members, and the number of poor counties with an
 average per capita income of less than 50 yuan from collective distribu-
 tion dropped from 381 in 1978 to 211 in 1981.
 The main reason why the rural economic situation has been able to quickly
 take a turn for the better is because, since the 3d Plenary Session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee, we have more thoroughly corrected the long-
 standing "leftist" mistakes in agriculture and adopted a series of impor-
 tant policies and measures such as raising the prices of some agricultural
 sideline products, reducing or exempting taxes by taking circumstances into
 consideration, improving credit and agricultural sideline products purchas-
 ing work, encouraging and backing the commune members to make a success of
 their private plots and family sideline production, restoring country fair
 trade, popularizing various forms of responsibility system, respecting the
 ownership rights and decisionmaking power of the collective economy, suit-
 ing measures to local conditions and supporting the collectives and indi-
 viduals to  develop a diversified economy.   This has enabled the agricul-
 tural economy to embark on a new path in keeping with the conditions in
 our country within a few short years.

 The Important Thing Is To Arouse the Enthusiasm of the Peasants
 The "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Certain Questions Concerning
 the Acceleration of Agricultural Development" adopted by the 4th Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee pointed out:  "The first point of
 departure in affirming agricultural policy and rural economic policy is to
 give full play to the superiority of the socialist system and to the enthusi-
 asm of the 800 million peasants in our country.  We must ideologically
 strengthen socialist education over the peasants, and at the same time,
 economically show full concern for their material interests and politically
 safeguard their democratic rights.  Divorced from given material interests
 and political rights, the enthusiasm of any class cannot spontaneously
 emerge."  This has grasped the crux of our agricultural problem.  In the 20
 or more years since cooperativization, we have wasted a great deal of
 energy on rural work.  However, prior to the 3d Plenary Session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee, about one-third of the production teams still
 had an average per capita:.income of less than 60 yuan and lived in the
 straitened circumstances of "relying on resold grain for food, relying on
 loans for production and relying,on relief for existence."  Although the
 grain output of some of the economic units of advanced collectives rose,
 the economic effect was not ideal.  That was because. they did not grasp
 this crux of solving the material interests and political rights of the
 peasants and did not touch on the basic defects in the agricultural policy
 and the management system.  They suppressed the enthusiasm of the masses
 and caused agricultural economic development to lack any kind of intrinsic
 motivation.  These defects were mainly manifested in:
 First, one-sided emphasis was given to the development of heavy industry,
 and the economic interests of the peasants were ignored and infringed upon.
 High indexes, high purchasing quotas, blind commands and inappropriate
 restrictions on the peasants to prevent them from developing avenues for
 making money resulted in the fact that production, could not be properly
 developed and the livelihood of the peasants could not be properly improved
 in many areas.
 Second, the peasants lacked decisionmaking power.  Many production policies
 did not come from the peasants themselves but from the upper levels.  The
 policymakers were also far away from the scene of production and did not
 have to assume any responsibility for mistakes in commanding production.
 This was the basic reason for blind commands.  Blind commands inflicted a
 heavy economic burden on the peasants.
 Third, egalitarianism was practiced in the internal distribution of the
 collective economy, everybody ate out of a "big pot" and the economic
 interests of the individual were not linked with the fruits of labor.  The
 peasants had no economic incentive, consequently their production initia-
 tive and labor enthusiasm were dampened.
 In the light of the above defects, the agricultural policy decisions since
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee have used. carrying
 out the production responsibility system as the turning point supplemented

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 by various comprehensive countermeasures to firmly grasp this basic prob-
 lem of arousing the enthusiasm of the peasants.  Therefore we have been
 able to sweep away the depressing atmosphere in the countryside within a
 few short years and witness the appearance of a dynamic and vigorous
 situation.
 From the tortuous path of development taken by our collective economy, we
 can obtain the following revelations:
 First, in socialist construction, we must adopt an extremely cautious atti-
 tude in coordinating the economic interests of the state and the peasants.
 The state must accumulate funds and carry out industrialization, and the
 peasants should make contributions.  At the same time, we must carry out
 work in accordance with the capability of the peasants and must not try to
 achieve high rates of industrial growth at the expense of the peasants'
 rightful economic interests.  Otherwise, we will dampen their enthusiasm
 and damage agriculture, and in the end, the whole national economy will also
 suffer.   One of the important policy decisions made after the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was to readjust the proportion
 between agriculture, light industry and heavy industry and provide enormous
 material benefits to the peasants by raising the purchasing prices for agri-
 cultural sideline products and reducing taxes.  This has played a very
 important role in arousing the enthusiasm of the peasants.  Naturally, the
 material benefits given by the state to the peasants cannot exceed the
 extent the state can afford. If this extent is exceeded, the balance of
 financial revenue and expenditure as well as price stability will also be
 affected.  This would be disadvantageous to the state, and ultimately, to
 the peasants.
 Second, rural economic policy must be based on showing concern for the
 material interests of individual peasants and correctly handle the economic
 interests of the state, the collective and the individual peasant.  The
 reason why the production responsibility system can produce such obvious
 results is because it has closely integrated the personal. interests of the
 peasant with those of the state and the collective.   Because of this, the
 peasants will 'profoundly feel that they are the masters of the collective
 economy and will wholeheartedly throw themselves into socialist construc-
 tion.
 Third, respect the decisionmaking power of the peasants.  The "Decision of
 the CPC Central Committee on Certain Questions Concerning the Acceleration
 of Agricultural Development" stipulated:  "Under the premise of upholding
 the socialist orientation, implementing the policies, laws and decrees of
 the state and accepting the planned guidance of the state, all basic
 accounting units of the people's communes have the right to carry out
 planting in line with local-conditions, the right to determine measures for
 increasing production, the right to determine methods of management and
 administration, the right to distribute their own products and cash and
 the right to resist the blind commands of any leading organ or member."
 This has played a very good role in arousing the enthusiasm of the peasants.
 The?production contracts signed between the peasants and the production teams

 and the supply and marketing contracts signed between the peasants and the
 state commercial departments which appeared everywhere have more clearly
 defined the rights, responsibilities and interests of the peasant, the
 collective and the state.  They not only safeguard the decisionmaking power
 and rightful interests of the peasants, but also safeguard the implementa-
 tion of the plans of the state and the collective.
 Rural Economic Development Must Take a Chinese-Style Path of Modernization
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, leading
 comrades of the Central Committee have successively proposed that our agri-
 cultural development must take a Chinese-style path of modernization.  This
 includes transforming agriculture from solely grasping grain to all-round
 development and from purely carrying out farmland water. conservancy con-
 struction to properly grasping the planting of trees and afforestation and
 improving the plant cover at the same time.  Our policy is, we absolutely
 cannot slacken up on grain production and the active development of a
 divetsified.economy.  Our agriculture must take the path of garden-style
 cultivation and horticulturalization [zou yuan lin hua yuan yi hua de dao lu
 6382 0954 2651 0553 0954 5669 0553 4104 6670 6424], the path of all-round  .
 development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production
 and fishery and the path of comprehensive operation of agriculture, industry,
 commerce and transportation.  After several years of practice under the
 guidance of these guiding principles, we have initially developed a path
 for agricultural development that is in keeping with our national condi-
 tions and tangible results have already been achieved.
 What are the distinguishing features of the so-called Chinese-style path of
 agricultural modernization, and what is its objective inevitability?
 1.   In the utilization of cultivated land, it is necessary to carry out
 garden-style cultivation and horticulturalization.  China has a huge popu-
 lation and little land, and the population will continue to grow in the
 future.  Therefore, our policy can only be to keep on raising the utiliza-
 tion rate of the land and take the path of intensive operations, garden-
 style cultivation and horticulturalization.
 In the process of readjusting the production structure and developing
 diversified economy, the most conspicuous contradiction is the struggle
 between grain and cash crops for land.  This is mainly because the degree'
 of intensive management of agricultural production in our country is not
 high and extensive management has been carried out on a very large part of
 the cultivated land.   To solve this contradiction, we can only find a way
 out from garden-style cultivation and horticulturalization.  Regardless of
 whether in grain or in cash crops, we must keep on raising the level of
 intensive cultivation and greatly increase the yield per unit area.  Here,
 we must also properly handle the question of long-term and immediate rela-
 tions.   Taking the long-term view, we must continue to readjust the produc-
 tion, structure of agriculture.  A considerable part of the cultivated land
 will gradually shift to various areas of the diversified economy in order to
 greatly increase the ratio of diversified income in agricultural income.

 Otherwise, it will be difficult to quickly develop the rural economy and
 also difficult to more speedily bring general affluence to the peasants.
 However, readjusting the production structure is, in the final analysis,
 conditioned by the level of productive forces and the level of the supply
 of commodities and grain in particular.  Under the present condition of the
 level of our agricultural productive forces being very low and the grain
 problem still rather tense, the steps of readjusting the production struc-
 ture cannot be too quick.  Under the condition that there is no evident
 improvement in unit grain yield, the area of grain field should be
 stabilized at a certain level and can no longer be reduced.  All areas
 suitable for the planting of grain must develop grain crops.  Areas which
 are not only suitable for the planting of grain but are also suitable for
 the development of cash crops should give priority to the planting of
 grain.  A small number of sandy land, alkaline land and sloped land areas
 not suitable for the planting of grain but suitable for the development of
 cash crops or forestry and livestock production naturally must not have
 grain planted on it.  The extent of readjusting the production structure
 must be determined in accordance with the margin of increase in the unit
 yield of grain and cash crops.  An important aspect at present is to trans-
 form-the medium- and low-yield fields which accounted for two-thirds of the
 existing cultivated land in our country.   If effective measures can be
 taken to raise the unit yield of this portion of cultivated land, the con-
 tradiction in the struggle between grain and cash crops for land can be
 greatly mitigated.
 2.  Rural economy must implement the all-round development of agriculture,
 forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery as well as the
 comprehensive management of agriculture, industry, commerce and transpor-
 tation.  For a long time, one of the serious defects in the development of
 agriculture was focusing attention only on the 1 billion and more mu of
 cultivated land and neglecting the use of the vast mountain areas, grass-
 lands and water areas.  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
 Central Committee, we have broadened our field of vision.  We understand
 that people can make use of the abundant resources of these places to
 produce ligneous oil, ligneous grain, dry and fresh fruit products, aquatic
 products and livestock products.  All of these are excellent foods.  They
 not only can satisfy the various livelihood needs of the people but can also
 reduce the pressure on grain.  We understand that grain production is the
 basis for the development of-forestry, animal husbandry, sideline produc-
 tion, fishery and diversified economy, that forestry also provides excel-
 lent ecological environment for the development of agriculture and animal
 husbandry, and that forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production,
 fishery and diversified economy supply fertilizer and funds to the planting
 industry.  As a result of the implementation, an .excellent situation has
 appeared of the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal
 husbandry, sideline production and fishery promoting each other.
 China has a population of 1 billion people, of which 800 million live in
 the countryside.  China has a labor force of 400 million people, of which
 300 million are engaged in agriculture.  Since 1957, our agricultural labor
 force has increased by about 50 percent and our agricultural machines and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 power for agricultural use have increased 10 times, scores of times and even
 hundreds of times, but the cultivated land worked by the agricultural labor
 force has, been reduced by half and there is a great surplus of agricultural
 labor.  Since the institution of the production responsibility system, this
 ptoblem has become even more pronounced.  Where can we assign this surplus
 agricultural labor?  Our national economy is backward, and the ability of
 urban industries,' commerce and service trades to absorb surplus rural labor
 is limited.  Moreover, the increase of the population in cities and towns
 is also conditioned by the situation of commodities and grain supply, and
 there will be no basic change., in this situation for a relatively long time
 to come.   Therefore, we must keep most of the surplus agricultural labor
 in the countryside and find a place for them there.  This is advantageous
 to the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,
 sideline production and fishery.  At the same time, we must develop rural
 industries, commerce, transportation and service trades in a planned manner,
 promote the development of rural towns, bring about the development of rural
 culture, education, social welfare and public undertakings and progressively
 diminish the gap between towns and villages.
 3.  Agricultural production must develop along the direction of making con-
 centrated use of labor and knowledge.  We must give play to this superiority
 held by the rich agricultural labor resources of our country.  Automation
 and mechanization of agriculture can only be selectively carried out in key
 points, and we cannot blindly run after wholesale mechanization and automa-
 tion under existing conditions in China.  For the sake of satisfying the
 constantly growing material and cultural needs of our society, we must not
 only pay attention to improving labor productivity, but we must also pay
 attention to improving the productivity of the land.  To do so, merely
 relying on increasing capital and means of production is not enough.  We
 must raise the level of intensive cultivation and put in more work and know-
 how.  Our agriculture has a fine and longstanding tradition of intensive
 cultivation.  We must continue to give play to this distinguishing feature
 and integrate it with modern science and technology.  For this reason, we
 must attach great importance to the promotion of rural intellectual develop-
 ment.  Without a large number of peasants with a good grasp of science and
 technology, there will not be a Chinese-type modernization in agriculture.
 Rural intellectual development must begin with an improving rural education,
 the setting up and perfecting of a sparetime cultural and technical educa-
 tion system and a setup for popularizing rural technology to the peasants
 is a path for raising the technical level of rural areas that requires
 little investment and produces faster and better results.
 Under the Premise of Public Ownership of the Means of Production, Manage-
 ment of Collective Economy Must Be Flexible and Diversified
 For a long time, people have developed this kind of understanding:  After
 the cooperative transformation of agriculture, collective management,
 centralized labor and unified distribution should be practiced.  This tradi-
 tional concept has been smashed by' the practice of the peasant masses since
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.

 At present, the two forms of the responsibility system practiced by most of
 the communes and production brigades are "production contracted to each
 household" and "responsibility for the task assigned to each household."
 Some changes have taken place in the unified management and unified distri-
 bution system of the production teams, and what they practice is decen-
 tralized management with the family as a unit, or the collective economy
 has adopted the form of household management.  This reform in management
 reflects a change in rural relations of production.  It cannot be denied
 that various districts have a number of well-run production teams.  Their
 economic level, management level and the income level of their commune
 members are higher.   They have accumulated more public property and a very
 great change has taken place in the features of their production and liveli-
 hood.  This kind of production team can, and also should, continue to prac-
 tice the form of unified management and unified distribution with the pro-
 duction team as a basis.  However, such production teams are actually very
 few in number.  As for the communes and production brigades in many dis-
 tricts, household management has become the principal management form of
 the collective economy.
 Why is it that socialist collective agriculture can adopt the form of house-
 hold management, and will not this form of household management change the
 socialist character of the collective economy?  Outwardly, the form of
 household management adopted by the collective economy at present bears a
 certain resemblance to the individual economy.  However, the character of a
 mode of production should not be judged on the basis of its form.  We
 should go beyond the form to'analyze its internal economic relations.  The
 distinguishing features of management by separate household are:   1) It is
 carried out on publicly owned land.  The ownership by the collective over
 the land is protected by law and the land cannot be leased or sold.  There
 are also stipulations regarding the use of the land, and if necessary, it
 can be readjusted or taken back.   Therefore the economic position of the
 contracting peasant households is entirely different from that of indi-
 vidual peasants.   They have no means to freely amass land, and polarization
 is also inevitably restricted.   2) As the contract-awarding unit, the
 collective economy can supervise and direct the activities of peasant house-
 hold management in accordance with the terms of the contract.   It also
 possesses essential material means such as large and medium-size farm
 machines and implements as well as water conservancy facilities able to
 influence the production of the subcontracting households and bring them
 into line with the plans of the state and the collective.  3) In addition
 to administrative methods, the state also has at its disposal to orient
 production all essential economic means, including large-scale industries,
 commerce, credit, subsidies and taxation.  These conditions will shift
 decentralized household management from the socialist course and place it
 in the service of socialist, interests.  Therefore, it is an integral part
 of the collective economic structure of socialist agriculture and a form
 embodying the socialist mode of production.
 For a new mode of production to adopt the shell of the old mode of produc-
 tion at the initial period of its establishment, because productive forces
 are not strong enough, is not a unique phenomenon in history.  At the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 initial period of its establishment, the capitalist mode of production
 had extensively adopted the form of household industries, and judging from
 the appearance in connection with such characteristics as the employment
 of household labor, the use of the home as a factory and the independent
 household management, there was almost no distinction between these house-
 hold industries and the former household handicraft industries of capital-
 ism.  However, because they had established contract relations with large
 capitalist factories, Marx correctly pointed out that with the exception
 of a similarity in name these household industries were completely differ-
 ent in essence from the household industries of the past.  They were the
 external sections of capitalist factories and their workers also increas-
 ingly became wage workers.  For the same reason, separate household
 management under the publicly owned economy is only using the form of the
 small peasant economy, but its essence has basically been changed.
 However, we should see that household management also has its limitations.
 Most have not broken away from the state of natural economy, and manage-
 ment items are small and complete.  This situation is in contradiction to
 the demand for the further development of production.  This is most sharply
 manifested in:  It is detrimental to the specialization of production tech-
 niques, and people with specialized technique also cannot easily bring
 their skill into full play. Contracting everybody to work in large fields
 is detrimental to changing the state of the unitary production structure.
 Separate management has made it difficult to centralize for production the
 surplus funds and labor scattered around the countryside.  It affects the
 rational utilization of large and medium-size agricultural machines and
 water conservancy facilities as well as the popularization of advanced
 science and technology.  Moreover, it can also be easily divorced from the
 plans of the state and the collective.   It is detrimental to developing the
 commodity economy and raising the marketability of commodities.  Therefore,
 our socialist agriculture must certainly develop along the direction of
 specialization and socialization.  Such household management on the basis
 of public ownership will also gradually head toward specialization and
 socialization along the three paths listed below.
 1.  Specialization of contract management and household sideline production.
 The specialized households and key households that have emerged everywhere
 at present are an embryonic form of specialization and socialization.   They
 are a transitional form of development from natural economy to modernized
 agriculture.  In terms of the whole country, their number is still very
 small.  As they require little investment but produce better economic
 results and more commodities with high marketability, they have already
 shown great vitality.  They have a common tendency, which is that they
 have gradually broken away from the small and complete natural economy.
 They have first of all separated the planting industry from the livestock
 and poultry-raising industry.  Since then, specialized division of labor
 has also appeared within the planting industry and the livestock and
 poultry-raising industry and they have also set up all kinds of socialized
 technical service companies and organizations.

 2. Strengthen the ties and joint operations of the socialist-owned
 economy. After carrying out separate household management, some of the
 better-run production teams have, on the principle of unifying what should
 be unified and separating what should be separated, strengthened unified
 control and.xuse of large and:, medium-size agricultural machines and water
 conservancy facilities, and some of the sideline industries not suitable
 for decentralized management have been placed under the unified management
 of production teams or production brigades.  Based on the demands of the
 state plan and the needs of the collective economy, they have worked out a
 unified production plan and have also properly organized contract work to
 guarantee their implementation.  They have drawn necessary funds, including
 accumulated funds, from the reserves kept by the collective to give play
 to the material base of unified management and expanded production.  In
 this way, they have strengthened the economic ties and leadership to the
 collective economy over various peasant households, with notable results.
 Along with the raising of the degree of specialization and socialization
 of various peasant households (especially specialized households and key
 households), the ties between the management activities of the peasant
 households and the commercial, transportation, agricultural product
 processing and technical service departments of the state and the collective
 have steadily strengthened, and some of them have also set up joint opera-
 tions with the above-mentioned organizations.  The higher the degree of
 specialization and socialization, the greater the reliance of the manage-
 ment activities of peasant households on the socialist publicly owned
 economy and specialized service departments and the more they are condi-
 tioned by socialist planned economy.
 3.   Organization of new economic cooperation and alliances.   In areas
 carrying out the "production contracted to each household" and "responsi-
 bility for the task assigned to each household" systems, economic coopera-
 tion and alliance between the contracting households have experienced vary-
 ing degrees of development in recent years.  On the whole, they can be
 divided into:   1) Temporary production cooperation.   The distinguishing
 features are:   voluntary production cooperation, with separation and inte-
 gration or alliance but no integration of a seasonal nature, for the sake
 of solving the contradiction between the dissemination of advanced tech-
 nology over a large area and decentralized management.  The nature of labor
 cooperation among the peasant households takes such forms as labor exchange,
 mutual help and joint soaking and raising of seedlings.   Some have used
 their hardcore technical forces, to contract with peasant households for
 certain technical and production tasks, such as the prevention and control
 of plant diseases and elimination of pests.   Certain peasant households
 have set up unified planning and technical service organizations.   2) Estab-
 lishment of an independent economic alliance.   Generally speaking, this is
 led and organized by people who have.a good grasp of technology with those
 taking part putting in investment and buying a share.  Some have mainly
 taken advantage of their natural resources, some have joined forces to
 raise money for running sideline production.
 There are still many problems facing agriculture, and we cannot treat them
 lightly or be unrealistically optimistic.  However, the course has been

 charted and the way clearly pointed out.  It has only been a short time
 since the implementation of the policies affirmed by the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, but the changes taking place
 in the countryside have already manifested the powerful vitality of these
 policies. We are positive that they will continue to promote the develop-
 ment of our agricultural and rural situation in a favorable direction.

 A MAJOR PROBLEM IN IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY TOWARD INTELLECTUALS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 17, 1 Sep 82 pp 22-26
 [Article by RED FLAG commentator]
 [Text]  Earnest and overall implementation of the party's policy toward
 intellectuals, in particular toward middle-aged intellectuals, is an impor-
 tant question affecting the overall situation in the socialist moderniza-
 tion of our country.
 Since the smashing of the "gang of four," especially since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the party Central Committee has
 attached great importance to the question of intellectuals.  It has done
 much theoretical work in straightening things out in this respect and has
 adopted a series of measures', to implement the policy toward intellectuals.
 For example:  Those who were unjustly, falsely and wrongly charged before
 and during the "Great Cultural Revolution" have basically been redressed
 and most of them have been offered appropriate posts; a large number of
 old intellectuals have been restored to leading posts and a large number of
 outstanding middle-aged and young intellectuals have been elected to lead-
 ing groups at various levels to strengthen them; a large number of out-
 standing intellectuals have been admitted into the party; assistants have
 been assigned to some old specialists; the situation that some intellectuals
 cannot make use of what they,have learned or cannot make use of their strong
 points has been changed as a result of the readjustments made, and the
 question of ensuring intellectuals to use what they learn is being grad-
 ually resolved; in many departments and units, many cadres engaged in
 professional work have been examined and given higher technical titles;
 the problems of couples living separately in different localities or
 couples without a child living with them to take care of them have been
 solved for many people; and-the work and living conditions of intellectuals
 have been preliminarily improved.  These measures show that the party and
 the people are concerned with intellectuals and have aroused their enthusi-
 asm in dedicating themselves to socialist modernization.  However, for
 various reasons, many problems remain unsolved in implementing the policy
 toward intellectuals.   Therefore, it is imperative to earnestly check the
 work in implementing the policy toward intellectuals in accordance with the
 party Central Committee's instructions.

 At present, the results of checking the work in implementing the policy
 toward the intellectuals throughout the country show that, comparatively
 speaking, the work in implementing the policy toward old intellectuals is
 better; whereas the work in implementing the policy toward middle-aged
 intellectuals, that is, raising their political status, giving full play
 to their role and improving their work and living conditions, is not yet
 satisfactory.  However, implementing the policy toward the middle-aged
 intellectuals is the key to implementing the policy toward all intellec-
 tuals.  This question has already drawn the attention of the whole party,
 the people of the whole country and the people in all walks of life.
 The middle-aged intellectuals are basically those who were directly
 nurtured by the party and matured after the founding of new China.  Most
 of them suffered from hardships inflicted on the nation and the classes
 to which they belong and their world outlook was fostered in the early
 1950's-1960's when our party's work style and the general mood of the
 society were the very best ever.  Therefore, their political consciousness
 is relatively high and they have a deep love for the party.  They have
 unswerving faith in socialism, great enthusiasm toward the revolutionary
 cause and the spirit of dedicating themselves to it.  Although many comrades
 among them have been unjustly treated or have,suffered hardships in some
 political movements, in particular during the "Great Cultural Revolution,"
 they have all along loved the party and socialism and have great faith in
 the victory, destiny and future of our party and motherland.  Moreover, the
 intellectuals of this generation have received relatively more systematic
 education and training in specialized fields and their knowledge of science
 and culture is relatively better.  Even during the adverse conditions during
 the 10 years of internal disorder, many comrades continued to diligently
 study and closely followed the development of modern science and technology.
 Therefore, $lthough changes `occur every day in all fields of knowledge at
 present, they are still able to keep pace with new situations, acquire new
 knowledge and make new achievements in science and technology.  All this
 shows that the various fine qualities and special skills of our country's
 intellectuals can be collectively found in the middle-aged intellectuals.
 They are a very valuable treasure of the party and the people.
 Intellectuals of the older generation in our country have made important
 contributions to socialist modernization in various fields and they have
 been highly commended by the party and the people.  At present, most of
 them are over or well over 60 years old.  Although they have lofty aspira-
 tions and are still working their hearts out for the socialist cause, they
 find their ability unequal to their ambition.  There are quite a few young
 and capable intellectuals but they are still growing to maturity and they
 still have to make further improvements and advanced studies in politics
 and their work.   Under these circumstances, the position and role of the
 middle-aged intellectuals, who are in the prime of their lives and consti-
 tute the main body of our country's intellectuals, have become very
 prominent.  For example, of the 179 scientific and technological workers
 who were prize-winners 96 times in scientific research achievements of the
 first and second grades in the Beijing area of the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences in 1978-79, 158 are 36-50 years old, accounting for 88 percent of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 the total.  Again, of the 100 scientific research items in the Jiangsu
 Agricultural Research Institute, 71 are in charge of middle-aged scientific
 and technological workers. The situation on the education front is more or
 less the same.  The middle-aged teachers of the ship dynamics department of
 the Shanghai Jiaotong University account for 65 percent of the teachers of
 the whole department; of the 50 courses offered in this department in one
 year, 48 are taught by middle-aged teachers, accounting for 96 percent; of
 the 6 major items of scientific research achievements made by this depart-
 ment and awarded by Shanghai municipality or the state, 5 were organized and
 directed by middle-aged teachers.  These facts clearly show that the middle-
 aged intellectuals are the mainstays and backbones of the entire ranks of
 intellectuals.  They are shouldering the historical mission of inheriting
 the past and ushering in the future in making our country's science, educa-
 tion and culture prosper.  Whether or not we can give play to their role
 involves the inheritance and development of our country's science, education
 and culture, the orientation and level of development of material civiliza-
 tion and socialist spiritual civilization and the success or failure of our
 country's socialist modernization.
 It is not enough just to understand the position and role of the middle-
 aged intellectuals in our country's socialist modernization.  We must also
 understand their initiative toward this undertaking.   The line, principles
 and policies formulated by the party Central Committee since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee have further aroused their tre-
 mendous enthusiasm.  They are proud of the historical mission they have
 shouldered.  This is the spiritual motive force that makes them work self-
 lessly in their posts on the scientific, technological, educational, cul-
 tural and other fronts, and attain tremendous achievements.  We must be
 fully aware of the latent initiative and creativeness of the middle-aged
 intellectuals.  We are not telling the truth if we say that the mental
 state of the middle-aged intellectuals is gloomy and pessimistic. The
 broad masses of middle-aged intellectuals will not agree to this either.
 The selfless spirit of the broad masses of middle-aged intellectuals dedi-
 cating themselves to the struggle for the cause of socialism is worth
 respecting and commending.  Besides, the party and the state are fully
 aware of their difficulties.   In order to give full play to their initia-
 tive and creativeness, we must provide favorable conditions for them so
 that they will be able to concentrate and energetically display their
 talents in the socialist modernization drive.  At present, the party Central
 Committee regards solving problems for the middle-aged intellectuals as the
 main task in implementing the policy toward intellectuals.   This is an
 important decision with far-reaching significance.   The implementation of
 this decision will undoubtedly speed up the progress of our country's
 socialist modernization.  We must consciously and resolutely implement this
 decision of the party Central Committee and must never adopt a passive
 attitude in this respect.
 In implementing the policy toward the middle-aged intellectuals, we must
 give full play to their special skills so that they can make the best use
 of what they have learned.  What distresses many middle-aged intellectuals

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 most is that they cannot rationally use their knowledge in specialized
 .Fields which they acquired during the years when they were educated by the
 party.  This is the most urgent demand of the middle-aged intellectuals at
 present. Party committees at all levels must pay great attention to this
 problem and earnestly solve it.  We must truly understand them, trust theta
 and provide conditions for them to display their wisdom and talents.  We
 must elect outstanding middle-aged intellectuals with moral integrity,
 capability and ability to do organizational work in leading posts at vari-
 ous levels and see that their authority commensurates with their posts and
 duties.  This is also an urgent task in making the cadres in leading groups
 become more revolutionary, younger in average age, better educated and more
 professionally competent.  We must admit into the party in good time, just
 as we treat advanced elements among the workers and peasants who want to be
 admitted into the party, all advanced elements among the middle-aged intel-
 lectuals who have satisfied the requirements for becoming a party member
 and must not discriminate against them or treat them with prejudice.   In
 addition, in accordance with the situation of uneven distribution and
 actual needs of professional people in various departments and localities,
 we should encourage a rational directional flow of these people and estab-
 lish rational management systems for the distribution, use, examination,
 flow and advanced studies of these people,  The fundamental question in
 arousing the enthusiasm-of the middle-aged intellectuals at present is to
 use them rationally and appropriately.  If we do a good job in this respect,
 their ideals and enthusiasm for participating in socialist modernization
 will find sustenance and there will be a basis for solving other problems
 for them.
 An important question which is closely linked with the questions of having
 full faith in them and letting them have a free hand in their work is that
 we must be determined to gradually improve the work and living conditions
 of the middle-aged intellectuals.  We must resolve actual difficulties in
 their work and daily life and provide necessary material guarantee in order
 to give full play to their role.   For example, we must gradually increase
 their wages, improve their housing conditions, reduce their household
 chores, give them necessary books, material, apparatus and equipment for
 their work and so on.  All this is very necessary to protect their energy
 and health and to raise their efficiency.  If we have not done a good job
 in this respect, we cannot say that we have truly implemented the policy
 toward intellectuals.
 In order to earnestly implement the party's policy toward intellectuals,
 in particular toward middle-aged intellectuals, we must also solve some
 ideological problems.   First, we must make clear that improving the working
 and living conditions of the middle-aged intellectuals and giving full play
 to their role are in keeping with the interests of the broad masses of the
 people.  In deciding to solve the problems of the middle-aged intellectuals,
 the party.Central Committee proceeded from the interests of the working
 class, the people and the nation.  Whether or not we can build a highly
 developed material civilization and a highly developed socialist spiritual
 civilization and attain the goal of our 20-year struggle depends on the
 foundation we lay in the 1980's.  If we can do a solid job in the coming

 I        G
 10 years, we will bring about bright prospects in endowing our economy with
 vitality in the future and will create conditions for a highly developed
 socialist spiritual civilization.  In order to lay a good foundation in
 this respect, we should, of course, carry out structural reforms and make
 material preparations but the most important preparation is to train the
 necessary capable persons.  The experience of many economically developed
 countries has proved that economic prosperity depends to a very great
 extent on science, technology and education and the training of capable
 persons.  Without intellectuals, it will be impossible to develop our
 country's science and education or to speed up the development of our
 country's productive forces by means of science and technology.  Without
 intellectuals, it will also be impossible to raise the scientific and
 cultural level of the whole nation or to make our next generation become
 new people with good education, lofty ideals, moral integrity and cultural
 knowledge and people who will observe discipline.  We must, with the broad-
 mindedness and far-sightedness of the proletarian, carefully handle and
 earnestly resolve the important question of the intellectuals, which
 involves the overall situation.  Otherwise, we are prone to be "short-
 sighted."
 We should realize that many people are suffering from "short-sightedness."
 The longstanding "leftist" ideas of belittling science, culture and the
 intellectuals and the pernicious fallacies about the intellectuals spread
 by the "gang of four" are still affecting the minds of some comrades.  Much
 effort is needed to eliminate this influence.   Today, this influence is
 manifested in:  1) Ideologically and theoretically, some people have not
 yet truly realized that the great majority of the intellectuals are compo-
 nents of the working class who have mastered relatively more knowledge in
 science and culture.  2) Some people do not really understand that the
 further we go on with the modernization, the more we need the intellectuals.
 They even think that "without the intellectuals, production will be carried
 on and houses will be built just the same" and so on.  It is high time this
 kind of prejudice and narrow--mindedness was gotten rid of.   If we do not
 realize that the intellectuals are components of the working class, we will
 not adopt an equal and comradely attitude toward them.   If we do not under-
 stand the role played by the intellectuals, we will not look squarely at
 their difficulties and demands.  Our leaders at all levels must remain
 sober-minded and use Marxist views to theoretically clarify the position
 and role of science, technology, education and culture in the socialist
 modernization and the position and role of the intellectuals and educate
 the cadres and the masses in this respect.  We must make everybody under-
 stand that in modern large-scale production, we cannot stick to the old ways
 or be complacent and conservative.  Without the prosperity of science,
 technology, education and culture, we will lag behind and be vulnerable to
 attack.   Stalin said that theoretical mistakes never brought benefit, nor
 would they ever bring us any,.   It is not easy to eliminate the influence of
 the "leftist" ideas if we do not theoretically and thoroughly clarify all
 questions of concern; nor will it be possible to increase our consciousness
 and to reduce our blindness in implementing the policy for the intellectuals.

 Second, we must overcome the idea of looking down upon mental labor.  It is
 undoubtedly a correct attitude of historical materialism to criticize the
 erroneous idea of regarding "everything inferior to study," give an appro-
 priate place to physical labor and respect physical laborers.  However, we
 should not play down mental labor or show contempt for knowledge and the
 intellectuals.  The separation` between mental labor and physical labor is
 the product of social development at a certain stage.  Its emergence was of
 progressive significance and promoted the development of science and cul-
 ture.            In a class society, this separation is based on class antagonism.
 In a socialist society, the nature of class antagonism between mental and
 physical labor no longer exists.  However, protracted efforts are needed to
 eliminate the differences between them, and the elimination of these dif-
 ferences is precisely the important revolutionary task to be implemented
 during the whole historical period of socialism.  Under the conditions of
 socialism, both mental workers and physical workers are laborers.  They are
 only assigned different jobs` and have no basic conflict of interests.  The
 relationship between them is a comradely relationship of mutual cooperation
 among comrades.  Only in a communist society will the differences between
 mental and physical labor finally disappear when these two kinds of labor
 merge together.  The process of this merging is inevitably realized by
 increasing mental labor and reducing physical labor and not otherwise.
 Therefore, the idea of despising mental labor is entirely wrong.
 Mental labor has its own characteristics.  These characteristics are usually
 manifested in its creativeness, continuity and complexity.  Creativeness
 means that it continuously makes new achievements for the spiritual life
 of human beings and for the transformation and regeneration in production
 and promotes the development of spiritual and material civilizations.  Con-
 tinuity means that mental labor is work which often takes longer time to
 complete and requires-greater efforts before achievements can be made and
 which cannot be interrupted at will or even interfered with in any way.
 Complexity means that mental labor is to mainly probe into the inherent laws
 of things.  It often comes across in new questions and therefore needs a
 rich accumulation of knowledge which continues to develop in depth through
 practice.  Generally speaking, mental labor is complicated work which only
 people who have received special training can do.  Marx said:  Labor power
 which can do complicated labor "is trained at higher educational costs and
 for a longer period of time than ordinary labor power.  Consequently, it
 has a higher value.  Since this kind of labor force has a higher value, it
 is engaged in high-level labor and turns out more value within the same
 period of time."  ("Complete Works of Marx and: Engels," Vol 23, p 223)
 It is precisely because the labor of the intellectuals has the above
 characteristics, that their' treatment, work conditions and living condi-
 tions. should be suited to these characteristics.  For example, since the
 value created by their labor is greater, they should have higher remunera-
 tion.            We must change the irrational phenomenon of middle-aged intellectuals
 earning lower wages than skilled workers of the same age group so that the
 mental and physical energy consumed in the labor of the former can be duly
 compensated.  We must pay attention to solving their housing problem and
 their problem of having to do heavy household chores so that they can have

 a quiet environment and an undisturbed mind, and so on.  All these must be
 solved step by step in the course of implementing the policy toward the
 intellectuals.
 Third, we must overcome the idea of egalitarianism.  Egalitarianism reflects
 narrow-sightedness of petty producers and is the product of the handicraft
 industry and small-scale peasant economy.   The old China was under the
 feudal system for a long period of time.  There were countless petty pro-
 ducers and the influence of egalitarianism was great.  The implementation
 of the principle of to each according to his work in a socialist society
 is a way to negate egalitarianism.  However, due to the prolonged influence
 of "leftist" ideas, egalitarianist ideas often spread extensively.   This
 was particularly so during the 10 years of internal disorder.  Its manifes-
 tation in actual life is inappropriate control of distribution according to
 work, including inappropriately evening remuneration for mental and physical
 labor and for complicated labor and simple labor and making the remuneration
 for mental labor less than that for physical labor.  Therefore, in imple-
 menting'the policy toward the middle-aged intellectuals, we must oppose
 egalitarianism, foster a general social mood of respecting mental labor
 and treasuring capable persons and create good conditions for them in terms
 of public opinion and material benefits.
 Of course, in improving the working and living conditions of the middle-
 aged intellectuals, we must do our work step by step according to the
 development of the country`s economy, and it is impossible to solve all
 problems at one go.  But there are things which can be done under the
 present situations without spending much money.  We must do these things
 without delay or hesitation.  Party committees at all levels must put the
 issue of solving problems of the middle-aged intellectuals on the list of
 important work of the day and administrative departments of various units
 must be sincerely concerned with the life of the intellectuals and try
 their best to help them overcome their difficulties.  Besides, we must also
 stress that leading comrades at all levels must earnestly make friends with
 the intellectuals and must understand them and know their demands well.
 Many intellectuals eagerly hope that leading cadres will frequently go
 among them, be concerned with them, talk with them and listen to their
 views.   If leading cadres act in this way, even if some problems in their
 work and life are not solved for the time being, the intellectuals will
 still be heartwarming.   This is extremely helpful in implementing the
 policy toward the intellectuals and in giving play to the socialist
 enthusiasm of the broad masses of intellectuals.
 That the party and the state show concern and attach importance to the
 middle-aged intellectuals shows that the party and the state trust them and
 place their hopes on them.  It also means that the middle-aged intellectuals
 are shouldering heavy responsibilities.  The broad masses of middle-aged
 intellectuals must be modest and prudent and learn modestly from the work-
 ers, peasants, intellectuals of the older generation, young comrades and
 more advanced comrades.   Only if they continuously remold their own
 subjective world while transforming the objective world will they be able

 to shoulder the historical mission.  We hope that the broad masses of
 intellectuals, in particular the middle-aged intellectuals, will further
 arouse themselves, continuously increase their capability in practice and
 together with the broad masses of people make even greater contributions
 to building our country into a modern powerful socialist country.

 CORRECTLY APPRAISE THE NEW GENERATION OF THE CHINESE WORKING CLASS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 17, 1 Sep 82 pp 27-32
 [Article by Yu Yannan [2456 3601 0589]]
 [Text]   The replacement of old workers by young workers in Chinese working
 class has increased dramatically since the 1970's.  From 1949 to 1969, the
 number of workers increased on average by more. than 2 million annually
 while between 1970 and 1981, the number increased by an annual average of
 4 million.  The number of old workers who began their work prior to libera-
 tion and in the early days of the founding of new China has drastically
 decreased, while the proportion of young workers has grown bigger and
 bigger.  According to close of 1981 statistics, the number of young workers
 under the age of 35 who began to work in 1966 was more than 60 million
 nationally, making up about 60 percent of all workers.   The young workers
 have become the main body of the Chinese working class and this is an
 important fact.  A very important question is that of how to appraise the
 more than 60 million young workers.  There are different views among many
 comrades as to how to appraise this young generation of the Chinese working
 class.   Through study and investigation, our basic view is that, taken as
 a whole, the general outlook and nature of the young workers are good and
 that their weak points and shortcomings can no doubt be overcome through
 education and help.  They represent a hopeful new generation of the Chinese
 working class.  This basic appraisal accords with objective reality and
 with the basic principle of the theory of dialectic materialism and the
 theory of historical materialism.
 In order to correctly appraise the-new generation of the Chinese working
 class, we must first of all understand the basic fact that the majority of
 these 60 million young workers are active in the front line of production.
 and have become the main force and backbone of production in various trades.
 For example, the mechanical workers in the Shanghai No 7 Cotton Mill under
 the age of 35 make up more than 90 percent.  The crew of the Guangzhou
 Ocean Shipping Company under the age of 35 make up 88 percent of the total.
 The statistics of the maintenance service section and workers' service sec-
 tion of the Zhengzhou Railway Subbureau and the Zhengzhou north railway
 station show that young workers under the age of 35 who are working in the
 front line of transportation make up 66 percent of the total.  In the Daqing
 oilfield, of the 1,222 production team leaders, 68 percent began their work

 in 1966 or later.  The proportion of young workers in the trades with a
 higher labor circulation rate (such as building construction) is still
 bigger.  In short, extensive investigation shows that the new generation
 of the working class has historically begun to shoulder the heavy task of
 realizing the national modernization program and have begun, in particulat,
 to shoulder the task of modernizing our industry.  Since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, there have been tremendous
 achievements in economic and'other construction, and in the various causes
 of the working class there have also been tremendous developments.  If we
 consider that the basic condition of the young workers who make up 60 per-
 cent of the total workers in our country is one of disorder, it is obvious
 that this view runs counter to the logic of life.
 In order to correctly appraise the new generation of the working class in
 our country, it is necessary to analyze in an overall way the basic features
 of the young workers and the reasons for the appearance of these features.
 The new generation of our working class differs very much from the older
 generation in such aspects as social experience, cultural level,.class
 consciousness, mental outlook and mode of life, for the older generation
 was subject to political oppression and economic exploitation in the old
 society, was emancipated following the victory of the revolution and has
 made tremendous contributions to socialist construction.  In effect, what
 are the features of the new.generation of the Chinese working class, and how
 should we understand and treat these features?  The following are our views,
 based on extensive reference from investigation.
 1.  Most of the new generation of workers are from urban workers' families,
 while their predecessors were mainly from bankrupt peasants' families.  The
 majority of veteran workers who began to work before liberation are from
 poor peasant families or handicraft workers' families in rural areas.   Most
 of the new workers who began to work soon after liberation also came from
 the rural areas.  But the situation now is different.  The majority of the
 new generation of workers are from cities.   Statistics show that in 1957,
 there were 7 million new industrial workers, of whom about 30 percent were
 from worker families.   Reference materials from recent investigations show
 that 80 percent of the new workers who have worked in factories since 1966
 are from worker families (the proportion of new workers from peasant fami-
 lies who are working in such enterprises as coal mines .and oilfields is
 bigger).  Generally speaking, the young workers who are from worker families,
 including urban cadre and intellectual families, have grown up in a peaceful
 environment.  They have spent happy childhoods and they have beautiful
 memories because their families, thanks to the party and socialist system,
 spent their days in happiness.  They themselves experienced a good social
 atmosphere and received a regular education in their early days.   Following
 the downfall of the "gang of four" and particularly since the convening of
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the political
 situation and living standards of these young workers and their families
 have, thanks to the implementation of the party's various policies, develop-
 ment of production and expansion of employment, improved considerably.
 Recent investigations show that the majority of young workers support the
 party's line, principles and policies.  A number of typical investigations

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 show that most young workers have affection for the party and for socialism.
 But, because they did not experience the oppression and exploitation of the
 old society to compare the new society with the old one, generally speaking,
 their feelings are therefore not as strong and profound as those of their
 predecessors.   These young workers are also less conscious than their prede-
 cessors regarding a sense of responsibility as the masters of their own
 state, in overcoming hardships and in abiding by organizational discipline.
 2.   The cultural level of the young workers is higher than that of the old
 workers.  Following the liberation and particularly since the mid-1960's,
 junior secondary school education has been popularized in the cities, while
 since the 1970's, senior secondary school education has also been popu-
 larized in the cities.   But most of the young workers, who are mainly from
 the cities, are junior and senior secondary school graduates ands conse-
 quently, their cultural leveir is higher than that of their predecessors.
 Statistics researched by the departments concerned show that in 1957, the
 cultural level of workers across the country was at that time, less than 20
 percent below secondary school, 64 percent primary school level and 15 per-
 cent illiterate.  But now, more than 90 percent of young workers are junior
 or senior secondary school graduates and only a few are illiterate.  Of
 course, because of the delay and influence caused by the "Great Cultural
 Revolution," regular education received by many young workers did not cor-
 respond with the level of their education.   The actual cultural level of a
 number of young workers is lower than their education level and this situa-
 tion has been termed as the "level" lower than "diploma."  But in modern
 life in the cities there are many ways for people to acquire knowledge.  For
 example, many young workers have acquired scientific and cultural knowledge
 through.TV programs, broadcasts and exhibitions, and such knowledge cannot
 be acquired in schools.   Investigations show that apart from an education
 level that does not accord with actual cultural level, the actual cultural
 level of young workers now is higher than that of their predecessors.
 Still, if the cultural level of the young workers is compared with the
 objective needs of modern construction, it is still far from meeting such
 needs.  Therefore, it is necessary to constantly raise the cultural and
 scientific level of the young workers through cultural education for
 workers.
 Investigations show that when young workers have a higher cultural level,
 they are quick to learn new technology.   Many young workers are able to
 master. in 2 to 3 months and 2 to 3 years the production skills and experi-
 ence that the old workers needed many years to accumulate in their practice
 in production.   The past few years have been characterized by the replace-
 ment of many old workers by young workers and, apart from the situation in
 which the young workers are yet to be trained to master certain tech-
 nologies, this replacement does not, in general, affect production.  And
 this situation is largely related to the fact that young workers have a
 higher cultural level and are good at learning technology.  Many production
 departments have enormously absorbed educated and physically sound young
 workers to renew the production force and, consequently, have promoted
 production.  Last year, 140,000 young workers in Shanghai completed produc-
 tion tasks 2 months ahead of schedule.  As the young workers have a higher

 cultural level, consequently they have a wider scope of vision, are more
 active ideologically with less conservative thinking, are able to learn
 political theory with better results and to understand more complicated
 social political problems quicker, and have a strong impetus in transform-
 ing some irrational situations.  All these are favorable to young workers
 in the understanding and acceptance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought
 and the party's principles and policies.
 3.  The young workers experienced a complicated life during the 10 turbulent
 years.  The young workers under 35 should have enjoyed this precious time in
 receiving socialist education in regular schools, but instead, they experi-
 enced 10 turbulent years during the "Great Cultural Revolution."  Therefore,
 their experience during this period has been termed as "to have been born
 under the red flag and have grown up in turmoil."  At that time, "classes
 were stopped for carrying out revolution."  The majority of these young
 workers joined the "Red Guards" because they trusted Comrade Mao Zedong and
 the party and because of their revolutionary zeal.  Because of their
 ignorance and under the instigation of some ultraleftist slogans, quite a
 number of these young people went too far and consequently caused, against
 their own will, considerable damage.  These young people were lacking in
 political experience and, consequently, their souls were hurt and their
 ideology was in a chaotic situation.  Later, they were sent to rural areas
 to settle down and then they returned to the cities, waiting for jobs.  Thus
 having traversed a tortuous path, these young workers have a more complicated
 ideology, world outlook and outlook on life.  Now, a few young workers are
 fed up with politics.  However, they are seeking "material benefit," they
 have no revolutionary idealism and they have the serious ideology of a wage
 laborer.  They do not even have confidence in the prospects of socialism and
 in the party's leadership.  All these shortcomings cannot be separated from
 the fact that during the 10 turbulent years, a large number of cadres,
 intellectuals and model workers were subject to slander, that the achieve-
 ments of the revolution and construction made in decades were denied and
 the relations between us and the enemy were topsy-turvy.  Neither can all
 these be separated from the sufferings of their families during this period.
 A few young people have violated labor discipline, taken away state property
 or engaged in fighting, and all these are a result of the anarchism and
 ultra-individualism which were rampant during the 10 turbulent years.  With
 regard to individual young workers who violated laws, were degenerate and
 even committed crimes in robbing and raping, in the final analysis, all
 these to a great extent are also the grave consequences of the 10 turbulent
 years.
 In short, the family background and individual experiences of these young
 workers differ very much, not only from those of their predecessors who
 began to work prior to liberation, but also from those middle-aged workers
 who were already grown up in the 1950's and 1960's.  Now some of our com-
 rades have not concretely understood and analyzed the features of these
 young workers, their history and their situation.   Instead, they have just
 seen that some aspects of these young workers are lagging behind the old
 workers and that some of these young workers are passive.   Consequently,
 these comrades consider that this generation of the working class. has a

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 much lower political standard.  They even hold that this generation of work-
 ers has lost the class nature of the working class and, finally, they have
 lost confidence in these young workers.   Through comprehensive analyses of
 extensive reference materials from investigations, we hold that these views
 do not correspond with reality and, therefore, they are incorrect.
 In order
 to
 correctly appraise the new generation of the Chinese working
 class, it
 is
 imperative that the ideological situation and reality of the
 ranks of
 the
 young workers be classified and studied and that quantitative
 analysis
 be
 made.   Analysis and study of extensive reference materials from
 investigations show that young workers can be divided into the following
 five categories:
 1.  Those who belong to this category have great aspirations and have done
 a good job in their positions.  They have constituted a political backbone
 and they are a shock force in production.  They are good at learning and
 eager to make progress, conscientious in their studies and consciously
 abide by labor discipline.   They make up about 20 percent of the total of
 young workers.
 2.   The young workers who belong to this category are able to give promi-
 nence to their work, which they carry out in a down-to-earth way.   They pay
 attention to safety in production.  They have a desire to become advanced
 workers, are hard working and live a simple life and dislike flighty and
 undisciplined behavior.  They make up about 50 percent.
 3.   Those who belong to this category are able to fulfill their production
 tasks.   But they do not have aspirations and do not care about politics.
 They pay particular attention to "material benefit," regard "everything
 from the point of money" and think that "to become workers means making
 money and earning their living."  These young workers make up about 25
 percent.
 4.  People in this category have empty minds, work halfheartedly and do not
 observe discipline.   They seek only temporary material comforts, and while
 they do not make any big errors, they continue to make small ones.  They
 account for.about 5 percent of the young workers..
 5.  Those who belong to this category have violated laws and committed
 crimes.  They have been sent to receive labor education or have been legally
 punished.  Their number is less than 5 in every 1,000 young workers.
 These proportions may be.different in different regions, trades and indus-
 trial and mining enterprises because of their different situations.   But
 investigations made in some regions and enterprises showed that the
 majority of young workers are good.
 Some of the young workers are called "graduates in 3 years" and merit our
 special attention.   They are junior and senior secondary school graduates
 from the 3 years 1966, 1967 and 1968.  These young workers experienced
 social chaos in the early days of the ''Great Cultural Revolution" and were

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 also sent to settle in rural areas.  Consequently, they have traversed a
 tortuous path. But most have received education directly from workers and
 peasants, have experienced production practice and have been trained to
 overcome difficulties.  We must also understand that prior to the turbulent
 10 years, they had generally already received regular school education,
 family education and social education for 7 to 12 years.  They have a com-
 paratively solid cultural foundation and a better world outlook and moral
 training.  In addition, they joined the ranks of the working class earlier
 and have been trained in the environment of socialized mass production for
 about a decade.  Eventually, a number of these young workers have succeeded
 to the fine morality and good tradition of the working class and have grad-
 ually become a backbone in both political work and production and construc-
 tion of enterprises.  According to statistics from some enterprises, about
 one-half of production team leaders are these young workers.  The roles of
 such young workers include advanced furnace team leaders, workshop leaders,
 fine branch secretaries of the CYL and party branch secretaries.  Although
 they traversed a tortuous path during the 10 turbulent years, many still
 maintain their confidence in the revolution and revolutionary zeal.   In
 addition, through repeated comparisons in practice and serious study, their
 feelings for and understanding of the party and socialism have become deeper
 and deeper.   They have great influence and prestige with the young people
 around them.  Consequently, they are able through their own experiences, to
 grasp the ideological features of these young people, help raise their
 understanding and solve various ideological problems and, consequently,
 these young worker leaders have become an important force for the party in
 carrying. out political and ideological work.  In strengthening work among
 young workers, the party and CYL organizations at grassroot level must rely
 on these young workers so that they will be able to fully display their
 roles.
 In order to correctly appraise the new generation of the Chinese working
 class, it is necessary to grasp the Marxist scientific analytical method
 and be good at grasping, from their manifestation, the nature of things.
 In his book "The Condition of the Working Class in England," Engels
 specifically described and analyzed the condition of the British working
 class in the first half of the 19th century on the basis of his own
 investigations and reliable reference materials.  It was true that there
 existed various negative phenomena in the ranks of the working class at
 that time, but Engels did not consequently deny the historical status and
 historical role of this class.   On the contrary, he profoundly expounded
 that it was none other than this class which had shouldered the heavy
 historical task as "gravediggers for capitalism."  Today, in analyzing the
 young workers in our own country, we must also resort to this basic stand
 and method of historical materialism.  Young people, and particularly the
 young workers who are related with the socialist social and socialized mass
 production and who have a higher cultural level, are the most active and
 vigorous force in our society.  Some comrades have failed to appraise
 correctly the main aspects and unessential aspects of the young workers.
 They have paid more attention to the negative features of these young work-
 ers and less attention to their positive factors.   Consequently, their
 appraisals of the new generation of our working class do not accord with

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 reality. This is primarily because these comrades often simply just
 appraise the young workers today with the criteria for appraising the old
 workers and middle-aged workers.  They neglect the changes in our social
 and historical conditions, fail to understand that the young workers and
 old workers have different ways of thinking, different modes of life
 because of the different living conditions of their families, different
 cultural levels and different social experiences.  In spite of making
 concrete analyses, these comrades analyze the condition of the young work-
 ers of the 1980's.with the criteria used in the 1950's.  They also fail to
 carry out political and ideological works according to the features of the
 young workers.  For example, our old and middle-aged workers suffered in the
 old society.   Through the education of recalling the past miseries and com-
 paring them with the present happiness, they will be helped to profoundly
 feel that they are liberated.  This method of education helps inspire their
 innate class feelings for the party and socialism.  But the young workers do
 not have such experiences.   So, generally speaking, the traditional
 ideological and political work of "recalling personal. sufferings" and
 "recalling family sufferings" are not of much help to them.  Also, some
 comrades often regard the situation as one in which the young workers are
 refusing such education.  Another example:   Unlike their predecessors, the
 young workers like playing, joking and beauty and like to raise questions
 and put forth their opinions.  But in spite of encouraging these features
 in the young workers, the comrades link these features with some bourgeois
 decadent thinking and style of work.  All this has hindered us in correctly
 appraising the young workers.  We must understand that although these young
 workers are not as good as their predecessors in overcoming difficulties,
 they have a higher cultural level, are quick in mastering technology, rela-
 tively sharp in ideology, do not easily believe in everything and are
 quicker in understanding and correcting their shortcomings and mistakes.
 Some comrades do not really understand the features of these young workers,
 which are very much in the interest of our socialist modernization program,
 and therefore do not work hard to develop these features.  In fact, some
 of our comrades were previously old workers themselves or have had experi-
 ences that are similar to those of the old workers.   This situation has also
 become a reason why these cadres demand that the young workers have the
 standards of the old workers.
 It is undeniable that the young workers have various shortcomings and prob-
 lems.   We have to understand that the emergence of these shortcomings and
 problems not only has its own reason but is also mainly because of the fact
 that during the 10 turbulent years and over the past few years we slackened
 the education of the young workers (some places even discarded such educa-
 tion).   Some young workers lack revolutionary aspirations and a sense of
 responsibility as the master's of their own country and this situation has
 been greatly related with the fact that in the past, these young workers
 did not receive systematic education in political theory and historical
 knowledge and education in the fine tradition and morality of the Chinese
 working class.   Because of this lack of education, the young workers are
 strangers to. those things with which the old workers are familiar.  They
 are also very far from really understanding their motherland, the CPC,
 Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, the socialist system, the happy and

 beautiful tomorrow of socialism, the historical tasks, the glorious revolu-
 tionary tradition and the fine morality and nature of the working class.
 Thus, without this knowledge, how can they foster revolutionary ideals and
 a sense of responsibility as the masters of their own country?  This situa-
 tion has also been caused by the mistakes we made in our work.                  It is
 improper and unfair to blame this situation on the young workers.  Recently,
 the Tianjin Soda Factory, Yangzhou Cotton Mill and many other industrial
 enterprises have strengthened this aspect of education.  As a result, the
 class consciousness of the broad masses of the young workers has been
 greatly raised and their revolutionary initiative has risen.  Facts prove
 that as long as we are able to correctly appraise the young workers and
 step up and improve their education, the shortcomings of these young work-
 ers will no doubt be overcome.
 The majority of the young workers are good, but we can in no way neglect
 the problems of a few young workers who are lagging behind.   These backward
 young workers are only a small proportion of the whole working class, but
 we must take active measures to reform them through education.   We must
 understand that taken as a whole, the fact that some young workers are
 backward or degenerate is a phenomenon under particular historical condi-
 tions.  If the whole society is concerned for the growth of this part of
 the young workers and the management departments concerned are able to suc-
 ceed and develop the rich experience and fine tradition of the party in
 educating and reforming as well as mobilizing the masses to help these young
 workers patiently and meticulously, the majority of these young workers will
 be turned, through education, into an active strength and will even, with
 the exception of a few who are incorrigible, become advanced elements.
 This has been proven in practice by many factories and enterprises.
 Although for the time being, these few young workers are backward or even
 degenerate, they have grown up in our socialist motherland.  We must under-
 stand that these young workers can by nature be reformed.  We can in no way
 put them in the same place as young people in capitalist societies who have
 become the "collapsing generation" as they turn decadent and degenerate
 because of the defects of the whole society and because they have no future.
 Of course, we must be fully aware that it is a very difficult task to reform
 these young workers.   It needs time and effort before we are able to heal
 the wounds suffered by them during the 10 turbulent years.  Externally, we
 have now implemented the correct open-door policy and internally we have
 implemented an economically activating policy.   The old ideology and con-
 cepts of the old exploiting classes, the influence and corrosion of the
 decadent bourgeois ideology inside and outside socialist society cannot but
 have a negative effect on the part of the young workers.  Therefore, the
 education of these young workers has become even more complicated.  But we,
 the working class, constitute the most advanced class in the history of our
 country and our party is the advanced vanguard of the working class which
 has mastered the most advanced science in the world--Marxism-Leninism-Mao
 Zedong Thought.  History has proved that our party and working class are
 able not only to educate and reform themselves but also to guide the whole.
 nation and to educate and reform it.   Therefore, we must be fully confident
 that by resorting to powerful ideological and political work and systematic
 education, we will be able to constantly overcome the influences and

 corrosion of the various forms of the ideology of the exploiting class and
 educate and reform these backward young workers so that they will be turned
 into qualified members of the new generation of the Chinese working class.
 The history of the development of the working class both at home and abroad
 shows that this class is in a position to educate, reform and digest various
 idle class elements and people with various forms of nonproletarian ideology
 (such as the lumpen proletariat) so as to expand its own ranks.  Modern and
 socialized big industry is a big furnace that is coupled with the injection
 of the ideology of the advanced working class, rich experience in revolu-
 tionary struggles, tradition in revolutionary struggles and education in
 modern science and culture.  Therefore, this furnace can melt various non-
 proletarian elements into true members of the working class.   Today, the
 working class in our country is the leading class of the country while our
 party is leading the national political power on behalf of the working class.
 In addition, we have conditions for resorting to all means outside and
 inside factories in our efforts to bring up the new generation of our work-
 ing class.  Marx said:   "The most advanced workers are fully aware that the
 future of their class and, consequently, the future of mankind totally
 depend on the education of the growing new generation of workers."
 ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 11, p 217)  These words have been
 proved by facts.  We must put the education of the young workers into an
 important position and pay much attention to it.  We have restored order
 today.  It is imperative for our party, which is the vanguard of the working
 class, to make more efforts in strengthening the work of the young workers
 so as to train them into a new generation of the working class who are
 imbued with communist ideology and morality, who have modern scientific
 knowledge and production skills, who are united and cooperating and who
 have strict discipline, and to enable them to help unite and influence
 young people in society.
 At the present stage in our country, workers, peasants and intellectuals are
 the forces on which our party relies.  Of course, we must rely on the work-
 ing class, but because of the present great changes in the organizational
 structure of our working class, the target of the party's key work within
 the working class must also be shifted  from the old workers who began to
 work in factories after the founding of new China as the main target, to the
 young workers as the main target (of course, we cannot neglect the backbone
 role of the middle-aged workers).  This work is demanded by history and by
 objective reality.  In order to effectively build the ranks of our working
 class both ideologically and organizationally and in carrying out all work
 concerning the working class, we must pay full attention to this change in
 the target of education.

 A LETTER TO A READER
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 17, 1 Sep 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Xiong Fu [3574 1788], editor in chief of RED FLAG]
 [Text]  Editor's note:  Comrade Chen Baozhu, a young
 cadre of Jilin Province, wrote a letter to Comrade
 Xiong Fu, editor in chief of RED FLAG, saying that he
 was going to write an article about the building of
 the party in the new historical period.  Comrade Chen
 Baozhu hoped that Comrade Xiong Fu would correct his
 article.  The following is Comrade Xiong Fu's reply.
 How are you!
 I have received your letter dated the evening of 10 May.  Let me first say
 that we are equal members of the party's contingent, only we have different
 direct responsibilities and types of work.  Comparatively speaking, I am
 older than you, and naturally have more experience than you.  While you are
 working at the basic level, you have more practical knowledge than I do.  Is
 this not right?
 It is good that you are going to write an article about the building of the
 party in the new historical period.  It can doubtless be said that you
 would not write such an article as a pastime or to seek the limelight, but
 to share the party's and the country's cares and burdens.  You fully know
 the situation in basic-level organizations, and have a party member's sense
 of responsibility, particularly that which a worker of .the party should
 have toward the party's work.  You ask me to help you write this article
 well.  I will naturally help you, because it is my duty, as well as my
 responsibility.
 I have read the enclosed contents of your letter to the party Central Com-
 mittee.   If you write according to those contents, the article may possibly
 cover too large a subject, and it will not be easy to write.  A good sub-
 ject must be chosen when writing an article.   If the range of the subject
 is small, it is comparatively easier to begin.  If the range of the subject

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100390001-5
 is too large, the theme and elaboration will be full of empty words.  Fur-
 thermore, we must proceed from actual conditions, centralize the problems
 that emerge in actual life, explain how we look at the problems (that is,
 our viewpoints) and expound (that is, state our reasons).  Theory is not at
 all mysterious.  Comrade Mao Zedong said that theory meant drawing some-
 thing from objective reality (drawing is abstract, meaning summing up) and
 .obtaining something that has been proved in objective reality.  In addition,
 when expounding, we must have factual arguments as well as points of view.
 These two must be combined to form a certain logic.  This means fully
 stating reasons.  Minor principles should be subordinated to major ones.
 Principles and ways of saying things must be in conformity with each other.
 They should not contradict each other.   That is to say they should not be,.
 as the saying goes, speaking incoherently.  According to the general
 requirements of writing articles, and according to your feeling that the
 party's good policies cannot be thoroughly implemented in basic-level units,
 you may narrow the range of the subject of your article to the analysis of
 the ideological and political conditions of party members at the basic level
 and to how to strengthen their education.   In this way, you can help them
 raise their level of implementing policies.  I do not have a good knowledge
 of the situation at the basic level.  But I am afraid that the main thing is
 not "effectiveness," but the varying levels of understanding policies.  Many
 comrades do not really understand the party's policies.  My suggestion is
 only for your reference.
 In addition, you have mentioned that you do not agree with "relaxing" our
 policies.  You are worried that if our policies are changed too often, we
 cannot win the confidence of the people.  You regard "changing too often"
 and "relaxing" as an organic whole, and you misunderstand these two con-
 cepts.  Have our policies changed?  Compared with the "leftist" mistakes
 made during and before the "Cultural Revolution," our policies have of
 course changed, and they have changed in a fundamental sense.  But viewed
 from the angle of the consistency and continuity of policies since the 3d
 Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and from the orbit of
 the guiding thinking for formulating policies, that is, Mao Zedong Thought,
 we cannot say that our policies have changed in a variety of ways, because
 our party's policies are suited to the present actual conditions of our
 country and have been proved correct.   As to "relaxing" our policies, there
 are three main aspects in the rural areas.  1) The method of "abolishing"
 the individual economy too early has been changed.   2) The method of con-
 trolling the collective economy too tightly has been changed.  3) The
 method of "eating from the same pot," adopted in the past in allocating the
 results of labor, has been changed.   With regard to these three aspects, our
 party's present policies are as follows:  The policy of assisting the indi-
 vidual economy is adopted under the condition that the socialist public
 ownership system occupies the dominant position.   The policy of appro-
 priately enlarging the autonomy of the collective economy is adopted under
 the prerequisite that the collective ownership system is consolidated.  The
 principle of to each according to his work and more pay for more work is
 implemented in allocating the results of labor.   This is bringing order out
 of chaos, insofar as past "leftist".mistakes are concerned.   This is what

 we mean by "relaxing" our policies.  Such "relaxation" of policies is
 necessary, and has absolutely nothing to do with "changing in a variety
 of ways."
 That's all for now.
 Wishing you success in your work!
 Yours,
 Xiong Fu
