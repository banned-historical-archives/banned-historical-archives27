 Paul Nitze, Assistantecretary of Defense
 for International AgE rs, in a television in-

 summed up the situation.  He wasn't try-

 in fact, was endeavoring to defend it.  But
 he unwittingly stated the case against the
 administration's policy of silence when he
 said:
 "I think the grounds for concern are, first
 of all, that this assistance the Soviets are
 giving Castro makes it more difficult for the
 Cuban people ever to restore their freedom
 and, secondly, this helps Castro consolidate
 his position in Cuba and thereby might in-
 crease the possibility that Cuba could be
 used as a base for Communist infiltration
 into the rest of the hemisphere."
 Yet nothing has been said officially for
 the last several months to the Soviet Govern-
 ment in protest about all this.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. FRANK W. BOYKIN
 OF ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, September 13, 1962
 Mr. BOYKIN.                                                Mr. Speaker, under
 unanimous consent, I include in the REC-
 ORD another timely and wonderful article
 by our great U.S. Secretary of Commerce,
 the Honorable Luther H. Hodges. I had
 the pleasure of putting another one of
 his great articles in the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD, which goes to every part of our
 beloved Nation, and have had so many
 wonderful letters from every end of the
 country congratulating us on what Sec-
 retary Hodges had to say in his article.
 It seems to me that this article is even
 greater than the last one, and I believe
 all of us appreciate the great work that
 Secretary Hodges has done, is doing and
 will continue to do in the Cabinet of
 President Kennedy. Secretary Hodges is
 just a genius in so many ways.  He has
 brains and ability and such an under-
 standing heart, and you will always find
 him, in my judgment, doing the things
 that will help all mankind. This article
 was a timely warning and we know new,
 since the Labor Day has passed and we
 have the record, that it was the most
 dangerous weekend of the year.
 God bless Luther Hodges and give him
 strength to carry on the great work he
 is doing for this, great Nation as Sec-
 retary of Commerce.
 The article follows:

 authorities can ask us for his record and act
 accordingly.
 We're sure these new programs will help.
 But in the last analysis, safety, _is still your
 job.  You and your fellow motorists are the
 only ones, who can reduce the number of
 Americans killed and injured next weekend-
 now predicted at 60,000.
 To help you help yourself, we have selected
 the following 10 watchwords for safety from
 the research findings of the Bureau of Public
 Roads.  These are the most important things
 to do.  Read them; check yourself against
 them.   Then use them on  the  road this
 weekend.
 Before you start:
 1. Safety-check  your car. At the very
 least, make sure your tires, brakes, and lights
 are fully serviceable.  I've put eafety belts in
 my own car, and advise everyone to do so.
 2. Plan your trip.   Get good maps and in-
 formation; lay out your trip  thoughtfully.
 Estimate realistically how far you can go
 each day by staying within the: speed limits.
 Plan to drive not more than 8 hours a day;
 If that is impossible, include plenty'of rest
 stops.
 3. Safety-check yourself.  Too often driv-
 ers take better care of the car-than. them-
 selves.  They'll run themselves ragged try-
 ing to clear everything up at the office and
 at home, staying up much too late the night
 before leaving.
 While en route:
 4. Stay alert.  Some tips: eat lightly so
 you don't "become drowsy.  Abstain com-
 pletely from alcohol at least until you've
 stopped driving for the day.  Stop periodf--
 cally to stretch your legs.
 6. Obey the speed laws, Serious accidents
 innprease drastically at speeds above 65 miles
 p~'r hour.  High speeds liay Off poorly for
 the risk involved.  On the New Jersey Turn-
 pike, for example, you can observe the legal
 limit of (10 and travel its length in 118 min-
 utes.  If you gamble and go 70 the most
 you'll save is just 17 minutes.
 '~`'6. Use judgment. The ]aw sits limits, but
 within those limits you have tcuse common-
 sense.  On a good, dry, 60-mile-per-hour
 8. Exercise self-control.  We all know the
 "big George" type of driver who weaves in
 and out of line, cussing everyone else on the
 road,  Remember you're traveling for en-
 joyment. Relax.
 9. Communicate. We must cooperate with
 other drivers to stay alive.  Let the fellow
 behind know what you're going to do.  Use
 all four kinds of signals-not just left turn
 or right turn, but "slow down" and "pass me,"
 If your car breaks down, warn other drivers
 by tying a handkerchief on the traffic side
 of the car or, at night, keeping dome and
 tail lights on.
 10. Be imaginative.  Imagine yourself in
 that other car in the next lane, for example.
 Think what you would do if you were its
 driver, and guide your own car accordingly.
 Of course, you can't anticipate everything;
 expect the unsuspected and be ready to act
 promptly.
 - Every driver can and should add items to
 this list.  But I guarantee that if each of us
 concentrate on these 10, we'll soon make a
 change in the present intolerable situation,
 where it's al least 50 percent more dangerous
 to drive a car than to ride an airliner, where
 almost 5 million  people are injured each
 year-equal to the combined population of
 Los Angeles and Philadelphia.
 Labor Day is a time to work for safety.
 Let's put these 10 watchwords into practice
 then-and ,very other day too.

 tivity in Red China Through Aid and
 Assistance of High School Classmate,
 Samuel L. Cutler, of Springfield, Mass.
 EXT! NSION OF REMARKS
 HON. EDWARD P. BOLAND
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE f:OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, September 13, 1962
 Mr. BOLAND.  Mr. Speaker, my col-
 leagues are fully aware of the profound
 gratification that comes to a Member of
 Congress upon the successful resolution
 of casework, particularly those cases we
 handle involving human beings.  I had
 such an -experience recently when a na-
 tive American of Chinese ancestry, Mr.
 Edward E. Ting, who grew up in my
 home city of Springfield, Mass., managed
 to flee from his Communist Chinese
 captors after living for 13 years in main-
 land China under Red oppression.  I
 had worked for several years on this
 case with Mr. Ting's high school class-
 mate, Mr. Samuel L. Cutler, of Spring-
 field, in an effort to establish Mr. Ting's
 American citizenship and the fact that
 lie had been issued an American passport
 to travel to China in 1928.  Mr. Cutler is
 to be commended for his dedication and
 persistence in trying to help out his old
 boyhood friend, and his devotion to this
 flight to freedom from Red China by 1'I r.
 Ting:
 TECH  HIGH  GRAD  Is  HOME  AD3'ER  FLEEING
 RED   CHINA-EDWARD  E.      TING   REUNITED
 WITH BOYHOOD PAL WHO HELPED FREE HIM
 FROM TYRANNY
 (By Foster L. Spencer)
 "I learned in my college days that he who
 holds your money, holds your freedom; and
 whoever holds your food, holds your life.
 Well, my money and food were held for more
 than a decade by the rulers of that Red
 hell."
 So said Edward E. Ting, a former Spring-
 field resident and Technical High School
 graduate, who arrived in this city just re-
 cently after 35 years in China, the past 13of
 those years in what he aptly calls a "Red
 hell."  Mr. Ting arrived safely in the United
 States from Hong Kong, after a harrowing
 and dramatic escape from the Communist-
 held land behind the Bamboo Curtain.
 AT CUTLER HOME
 Now again in the land of the free, this
 Chinese-American is staying at the home of
 Mr. and Mrs. Samuel L. Cutler, 79 Eckington
 Street.  Mr. Cutler, a teacher at Technical
 High School and a close friend of Mr. Ting
 during their high school days here, is the
 man most responsible for Ting's return to
 the United States.  Ever since the Commu-
 nist takeover in China, Mr. Cutler has made
 continuous efforts, to get his high school
 chum out of China.   And his unflinching
 perseverance was duly rewarded when Mr,
 Ting arrived in Springfield via bus on Au-
 gust 9.
 Mr. Ting's story is one of resolute deter-
 mination and bravery in the face of depriva-
 tion, starvation, tyranny and death.  But
 today, at age 61, Mr. Ting actually is living
 a dream which taunted him for many years
 when he worked 16 hours a day at forced
 labor in Red China.
 AGAIN IN PARADISE
 "I'm once again in paradise," was Mr.
 Ting's comment on his safe arrival in the
 United States after enduring incomparable
 hardships at the hands of the militant, ruth-
 less Red tyranny.
 But let Mr. Ting tell his story-a story
 which needs to be told to freedom-loving
 people everywhere.   It's  a  dramatic  and
 heart-rending story-but more important-
 it Is a firsthand report by an American citi-
 zen about a land where Americans have been
 forbidden.
 ESCAPE FROM RED CHINA
 "Repeatedly since the Communists con-
 solidated their position in China, I made ap-
 plication to leave the country for Hong Kong
 or Macao,  I first applied for permission to
 leave when I was a civil engineer with the
 Canton and Hankow railroad, stationed at
 Hung Yang in 1950.   My application was
 denied and so were succeeding applications,
 until r was finally notified by the Red bu-
 reaucracy that a"person must-be at a port
 city in order to emigrate."
 Grew old
 "When I learned that I must go to a seaport
 to apply for emigration, I knew that I
 wouldn't be permitted to leave Hung Yang
 without some excuse.
 "It was then I decided to 'grow old.'  I
 grew a long beard, wore a long, drab, black
 habit, carried a cane and crept around while
 at work.  I luckily developed arthritis in one
 hand as time went on.  After I had let my-
 self appear sufficiently old and useless to the
 Communist bosses, I asked permission to
 leave for the seaport of Canton, where I said
 I knew a doctor who could help cure me.
 This was over 2 years ago-in 1960.
 "The authorities eventually  allowed my
 request, and I left for Canton, where I im-
 mediately petitioned to leave the country.
 I was told that I must establish residence in

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 maintain t4eace7  Second, can we
 op   ncommuni?
 . now    today we are going to talk
 AT . about the third great issue or challenge-
 Can we maintain this country economi-
 cally healthy? Or, in other words, can
 we maintain a sound economic system?
 Of course, we 'cannot 11 do that if war
 should come, nor would we be able to do
 it if we were "taken over by the Com-
 munists,  So we have got to make sure
 that we win the two previous issues.
 Now the third one is most important,
 and calls for, the best thinking of all
 Americans,
 The cold war still continues.  The de-
 mands on us `to make our contribution
 to contain war from erupting in other
 places, plus the tremendous cost of be-
 ing adequately prepared, required up-
 ward of $50 billion or' more.                    Now, as
 someone has said, "that's not peanuts."
 Then, beside that item we , have the in-
 terest on our national debt, our veterans
 pensions, the "oversead cost of Govern-
 ment, and so forth, and so we get up to
 a total close to a yearly need of $100
 billion.
 Of course, we are a nation of 186 mil-
 lion people. We have within our borders
 half of the market of the world,` but we
 also are faced with tremendous chal-
 lenges that we did not have a few years
 ago.  I mean foreign competition.  With
 our Marshall plan, and other aids, we
 have built up the manufacturing plants
 of other nations where-labor . is cheaper.
 We have now got to see that the markets
 of America are not flooded with these
 foreign goods.  At the same time, we
 have got to maintain our trade, wh h provides quite export-import
 emort
 Then, of course, the farm-program is
 with us. During the war we said to the
 farmers, "Produce, so we can feed the
 world."  And they did.  Now, we have
 surpluses in practically everything that
 the farmer produces.    How to handle
 that problem has not yet been solved.
 We cannot ignore the fact, either, in
 considering our economic welfare, the
 turbulence in the new nations, where
 the people are just coming out of their
 sleep. fact that We just off our shore      the
 is Cuba,'
 which is a Communist satellite, and
 China, with its more than half a billion
 searching, seeking human beings which
 Mao Tse-tung may cause to erupt at any
 time.
 Now, let us' discuss the meaning of a
 sound  economic  system-bearing  in
 mind we must keep, the free enterprise
 Besides protecting, our economic phi-
 losophy, we have our political system to
 preserve.. I mean the great freedoms
 that we are trustees of. 'heCommunists
 have no appreciation of these jewels of
 great price.  Yet, in some of the Com-
 munist countries the yeast is in ferment.
 The goal of maintaining a sound eco-
 ncnh C,, system is, as, a goal; something
 none of us w" ` argue about. we know
 that a sound economic system is ab-
 solutely indispensable to the welfare of
 our own people and the peace of the
 world. But there are, in my opinion, two
 aspects of this subject that will merit
 some discussion:
 First. A brief consideration of what
 constitutes a sound economic system;
 and
 Second. Some guidelines as to what
 we, as a nation, must do to assure that
 we  will continue to have a sound
 economy.
 We can start by recognizing that the
 main function of any economic system
 is to permit the optimum satisfaction
 of man's physical and, yes, his spiritual
 needs as well.  With this criterion, we
 must agree that our American economy
 has over the years performed with re-
 markable effectiveness.  When we con-
 sider the fantastically involved complex
 that our economy has grown into, and
 how it usually performs its myriad func-
 tions with minimal friction, we may
 rightfully have great pride and faith in
 it.
 We hear a great deal about the grow-
 ing intervention of the Government into
 the affairs of businessmen and the de-
 cline of individual freedom.  I do not
 deny some element of truth in this
 charge.  But let us also remember that
 the overwhelming day-to-day economic
 decisions are those made freely and with-
 out governmental coercion by all of us
 as producers and consumers of the goods
 and services needed by over 186 million
 Americans.  In no other land does the
 economic system function with as much
 freedom of choice as in America.  De-
 spite the growing powers of government,
 of big business, and of organized labor, it
 is still the consumers of America who in
 their freedom of basic choices play a
 pivotal role in the economic process.
 I, of course, do not mean to suggest
 that we should complacently accept our
 economic system as it is, even though it
 is basically superior for us to all alterna-
 tive systems.  Each of you will have no
 difficulty in pointing to areas where
 change, change for the better, is urgent.
 And to strive for such improvements,
 promptly and with vigor, is necessary if
 we are to preserve that freedom of choice
 and the freedom of action in our econ-
 omy as we know it.
 When we talk about a sound economic
 system, we clearly mean to reject any
 thought that such a system can be static
 or rigidly fixed.  We must focus our ' at-
 tention on an economy that grows as the
 needs of the Nation and its people grow.
 I do not intend to get into the idly specu-
 lative game of percentages of economic
 growth and whether we should or should
 not have a rate of growth greater than
 that of Britain or Germany or Russia.
 There are so many ways of measuring
 economic growth, and the rate of growth
 is so dependent on the base period from
 which the rate of growth is measured,
 that any single percentage figure, such as
 a growth rate of 3 percent a year, is
 rather meaningless.
 Furthermore, there is no merit in
 growth just for the sake of growth, any
 more than sound reason to keep onin-
 flating a balloon higher and higher.  We
 want not just economic growth, but that
 particular kind of economic growth that
 is needed to cope with our growing
 18265
 population, our technological advances,
 our expanding needs.  We want the
 right kind of economic growth because
 we know that our Nation will be stunted
 and stifled if we permit our human re-
 sources to lie idle and fail to harness
 the talents and imagination of our people
 to the goals we cherish.
 Thus, perhaps the paramount eco-
 nomic need of the Nation today is to
 take steps to solve the nagging problem
 of excessive unemployment in today's
 labor force.  As Senators know, in the
 past 8 years, the rate of unemployment,
 even at the peak of the business cycle,
 has been creeping up.  Today, after a
 steady improvement in most economic
 indicators over the past 16 months,
 unemployment-seasonally adjusted-is
 still, as of June 1962, 5.5 percent of the
 civilian labor force.  It went down to
 a low of 4.9 percent in February 1960
 and even further to a low of 3.9 percent
 in March and April of 1957.
 There are, of course, many reasons
 which have been -given to explain this
 disturbing trend.  Many believe that the
 rapid advances in automation and other
 technological developments have cut so
 sharply into the employment of major
 industries as to more than offset increas-
 ing employment in other, newer indus-
 tries.  The relative satiation of con-
 sumer demand for many durable goods
 that were in exceedingly short supply
 at the end of World War II, coupled with
 a slacking of investment in production
 facilities for such items, is also con-
 sidered a major factor.  In some indus-
 tries, such as coal and iron ore, deple-
 tion of resources combined with high la-
 bor costs, has caused serious unemploy-
 ment.  In certain industries rising im-
 ports have been a factor.
 Thus, it is obvious that there can be
 no single, and no simple, solution to the
 exasperatingly persistent unemployment
 phenomenon that confronts us today.
 But there are certain basic approaches
 that may help us in thinking about the
 problem. First, we can stand on the
 basic premise that the primary respon-
 sibility for the employment of America's
 potential 'workers rests with the busi-
 nessmen of this country.  The American
 businessman has throughout our history
 shown great resourcefulness in provid-
 ing consumers, directly and indirectly,
 with the goods and services they call for,
 and, as we know, through the many
 media of advertising has done much to
 stimulate and magnify such demand.
 They have, as a result, been the moti-
 vating force behind the employment of
 American workers and will continue to
 be so.
 But it is clear that there must be a
 reasonable prospect of profitable opera-
 tions before an enterprising business-
 man will invest in plant, buy materials,
 and hire labor for expanding production.
 And it is precisely in this area that the
 Government shares responsibility with
 private enterprise.  It has always been
 the function of Government, now as
 much as ever, to assure business of a so-
 called economic climate in which the
 profit motive has a fair chance of oper-
 ation.  Thus the entire fiscal program
