AFTERNOON SESSION 2:30 p.m. 
(Present: Senators Fuibrighto Carlson and Lausche) 
The Chairman. The Committee will come to order. 
Mr. Secretary e there are one or two statements in 
your own statement I would like to have developed a bitp 
for clarification. 
On page I2e at the bottom of the page of the mimeographed 
statement you say as follows: 
"Proponents within the Communist bloc of an aggressive course 
must not be encouraged by signs of weakness on our part. 
Proponents of a Peaceful course should be encouraged by 
our readiness to get on with outstanding international 
business in a sober and rational manner." 
Into which of these groups do you include Mr. 
Khrushchev? 
STATEMENT OF HONORABLE CHRISTIAN A. HERTER 
SECRETARY OF STATE (RESUMED) 
Secretary Herter, That I think would be very difficult 
to answer categorically. 
(At this points Senators Gore and Hickenlooper 
entered the hearing room.) 
There have been a good many estimates made as to whether 
or not he really means some of the things that he has 
said with regard to peaceful coexistence? with regard 
to disarmament and other matters. There is another group 
that feels that this is a front for the same power line

that Stalin used to take.

s-take 13-2 
mtadk I dont think it is possible yet to answer that 
categorically. 
I think that events are likely to show which of those 
groups he belongs to. 
The Chairman. Who did you have in mind when you wrote 
that? Maybe you cant cagegorically for all time designate 
him, but what has been your view and the view of the Department 
as to which group he belongs in. I think that is rather 
important as to how we treat him. Is it in our interest 
to discourage him? If he was a member of the aggressive 
course, I suppose it would be. If he is a member of those 
who are proponents of the peaceful course, then it would be 
(:) to our advantage to encourage or be cooperative within 
limits. I wondered why you put that in there if you didn?t 
have some idea of who does belong to these groups or how 
It is constituted. 
(At this point, Senator Mansfield entered the hearing 
room.) 
Secretary Herter, What I was trying to describe here 
was in effect a middle course. Insofar as Mr. Khrulhehev 
Is concerned, I think those who have dealt with him directly 
are convinced that he is ganulnely in favor of a disarmament 
program, that he genuinely wants, for the sake of developing 
the economy of Russia, a reduction both in expense from a 
monetary point of view and from a human point of view, of

the great burden of armaments. 
(At this points Senator Lausbhe entered the hearing 
POO .) 
Secretary Herter. Certainly there I would put him In 
the second category. His more recent behaviors however, has 
shaken my belief that this Is entirely genuine, and, as I say, 
I think that only the events of the next few months and 
possibly even of the next few years can give a final answer 
to what you lhave asked. 
The Chairman. Can you identify any other members 
or any people you had in mind in these groups? 
Secretary Herter. No. I would rather have those who are 
real Russian experts do that Wind of identification, those 
who are familiar with the individuals, more familiar than 
I am. 
There is no question but what there are still 
The Chairman. Would you care to have Mr. Bohlen 
comment on this question? 
Secretary Herter. I would be very glad to have himsif 
you wish to. 
The Chairman. It would be very good to have him comment. 
11. 
(:) He is recognized, is he not, as one of our best Russian 
nd unstad experts?

Would you care to comment on this; Mr. Bohlen? 
.Mx. Bohlen. Mr. Chairman my ,experience has been it is 
not always possible to identify trend in the Soviet Union 
with individuals. As the Secretary said earlier we 
literally know nothing of what goes on in the 
hierarchy. My impression of the statement the Secretary 
made is that it is possible to detect trends. You cannot 
identify people with them. my experience with the Soviet 
officials is that they follow whatever the agreed line isa 
whether it is hard or whether it is softa with great 
consistency? and they just do not reveal sufficiently to 
any foreigner what their inner thoughts are to identify one 
individual with one trend or another. But I think the indi-
cations are that both trends exist. 
The Chairman. Well? don't you think we know more 
about Mr. Khrushchev than any other one. More of us have 
seen him. He has been about more than any other. Don't 
you have any view as to which of these groups Mr. Khrushchev 
would be identified with? 
Mr. Bohlen. Well? my acquaintanceship with Mr. 
Khrushchev was when I was in there as Ambassador when he 
was not quite as prominent as he is now. I would merely 
say that he, along with them are excellent actors? 
and are able to maintain whatever the 
common line is in their dealings with foreigners. I think

Paris showed :4W14t there have 7bPPP qPX:4P Vlig0 p. emphasis 
inside the Soviet Unison which were manifested in part by 
what they .did in Paris, 
_(4t this pointe Senators Williams and Wiley entered 
the hearing room. 
Therefore: it is conceivable that Mrathrushchev would 
have been entirely serious in the line he was pursuing prior 
to Pariss and be equally serious in pursuing one diametrically 
opposite to it. 
The Chairman. If I may interpolate: do you mean that 
prior to the U-2 incident that Mr. Khrushehev may have been 
identified with the second group, that is proponents of a 
peaceful course. 
Mr. Bohlen. I would not segregate out the U-2 incident 
alone: Mr. Chairman. I think as put in the Secretary?s 
statement there seemed to us to be three elements involved 
in this matter and I think it is difficult to assess the value 
of each. But certainly I would say his doubt as to the 
success from his point of view of the summit conference, the 
fact that I feel a logical deduction that some of the views 
voiced by the Chinese Communists had supporters within the 
Soviet hierarchy and the U-2 incident brought about this 
change.

The Chairman. _I didn.?t. wish to make. you review all that 
was .said was merely trying to find the inner meaning 
of this particular statement. I thought that I could elicit 
some clarification since many of us don't know about these 
proponents of these courses or any groups of people. 
Mr.' Bohlen. The answers Mr. Chairman, is that I think 
we don?t know. That you cannot tell whether X0 V.? or Z in 
the Soviet hierarchy, what particular line he advocates 
because he never takes any differences even a shade of 
difference publicly, with what is the agreed line. It is 
quite impossible. I believe for anybody to tell who, within 
the leading group stands for one trend or the other. YOU 
can only detect from external evidence that there appear 
to be certain divergent trends and the individuals may not 
remain the same. 
The Chairman. Thank you very much. One other statemente 
MI. Secretary, on page 50 point 2: The decision not to 
suspend this program of flightse as the summit meeting 
approached? was a sound decision." 
Can you tell us who made that decision and when and 
of the circumstances? 
Secretary Herter. That is a decision that I think has been 
a decision that has carried over the whole four year period. 
Here, sir0 we get into certain technical aspects of 
when these flights would properly be conducted and could 
not be conducted? but I think for technical reasons 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
122 
had better be kept in executive session. 
The finding of a good time of a flight of this kind in 
relation to current events is almost impossible if you 
(:) know in advance that it is going to fail. 
The real issue was how urgent was the information 
and is there any one time that is more favorable than another? 
From a technical point of view it was our time was more 
favorable at that time than another. From a diplomatic 
point of view, it seemed to me that with the President 
scheduled to go to Russia later, with the fact he had the same 
difficulty e when you had Khrushchev here you had the same 
difficulties, in effect you would run into one time after 
(:) another where diplomatically it would have been a bad 
time. 
The Chairman. I donut think I make myself clear0 
understood from your previous statement and others that the 
program was agreed upon, and it was running along without 
being suspended. But this statement seems to leave the impli-
cation that a specific decision was taken not to suspend 
them in view of the conference approaching. 
Was such a decision taken? 
Secretary Herter. That I caret tell you0 I was not 
a party to that. 
The Chairman? Well, this says "The decision not to 
suspend this program of flights, as the Summit meeting 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
123 
approached:, wasa sound decision." 
Was there any decision taken"not tg susPend it? 
Secretary Herten. I know that when the matter came 
before mer which was some time previous from the point of 
view of the continuation of the program? when conditions 
were appropriate: I did not interpose any objection 
to it because of any diplomatic event that was coming 
up. 
The Chairman. Is it fair to say then no specific 
decision not to suspend them was taken? It was allowed 
to go? along without any decision being taken to suspend them. 
Secretary Herter. I think that is correct. 
The Chairman. Therefore? the other way around is 
that no positive decision was taken not to suspend theme 
is that correct? 
Secretary Herter. That is right. 
The Chairman.: : That statement: I think, needs 
clarification. I think to mee it means that at some point 
prior to May 1.4 a specific decision was taken not to 
suspend them in view of the summit. Isn't that a legitimate 
interpretation of that sentence? 
Secretary Herter. I think that is correct. May I read 
what the President said on that subject: He said As to 
the timing4 the question was really whether to halt the program 
and thus forego the gathering of Important 
information that was essential and that was likely to be

unavailable at a later date. The program went forward."

125 
14 The Chairman, Then that decision was made by the 
;or 
President, 
Secretary Herter. Oh, he was certainly consulted with 
(:) regard to the continuation of the program. 
The Chairman. Do you know when that was made? 
Secretary Herter. No. 
The Chairman. Was it prior to May let? 
Secretary Herter. I couldngt tell you. 
The Chairman, Mr. Secretary, do you know whether there 
was a moritorium on these flights during the meeting at Camp 
David? 
Secretary Herter. No. As far as I know, that question 
never arose. 
The Chairman. So that there was not, as far as you 
know? 
Secretary Herter. As far as I know, there was not. 
The Chairman. I believe that with regard to this 
matter about Mr. Lincoln White did not know that Powers might 
be alive, that would be with regard to the last question 
before we recessed. Did Mr. Hagerty know whether or not he 
was at that point? 
Secretary Herter. That I will have to ask Mr. Dillon to 
answer. I have no direct information. 
Mr. Dillon. I have no way of knowing whether Mr. Hagerty 
knew or not. In the ordinary course of business, a telegram

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
126 
such as the one which informed us of this rumor its only 
AOC. 
a rumor that we had received through other diplomats in 
Moscow -- such a telegram would have been transmitted for 
information to the White House staff. 
Whether Mr. Hagerty knew about it or not, I donft 
know. 
The Chairman, Mr. Secretary, was any effort made on 
the part of our Ambassadors or anyone from the Department 
after the incident, to pursue Mr. Khrushchev's feelings? 
Was anyone instructed to approach him and express any 
regret or in any way to reconcile him, to forgive or overlook 
this incident? 
(At this point in the proceedings, Senator Morse enters 
the hearing room.) 
Secretary Herter. No, I don't know of any such thing. 
The Chairman. No approach was made? 
Secretary Herter. No. 
The Chairman, Mr. Secretary: what were the considerations 
which led to the decision: not only to assume responsibility 
for the flight, but to imply that the flights would continue 
in the future? 
Secretary Herter. I have to take responsibility for the 
statement that was interpreted and If I may, I would like to 
read you exactly what was said on that score. 
This is a statement that was interpreted that we were 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3

p. 
going to continue the flights: 
"The Government of the United States would be derelict 
ri to its responsibilities, not only to the American people, but 
wit 
to free people everywhere if it did not, in the absence of 
Soviet cooperation, take such measures as are possible uni-
laterally to lessen and to overcome this danger of surprise 
attack. 
"In fact, the United States has not and does not shirk 
this responsibility." 
That is the statement that was interpreted that we were 
going to continue the flights, and it seems to me it was a 
pretty far-fetched interpretation. 
The Chairman. Then do you mean that that statement, that 
you did not intend to convey the view or the possibility that 
the flights would be continued, is that correct? 
Secretary Herter. No, what I was saying there was just 
what I have testified to today; that from the point of view of 
our own interests and that of the whole free world, it is 
essential for us to do whatever we properly can in order to 
acquire information to avoid surprise attack or to be prepared 
for it.

tor- The Chairman. But in view of that statement, do you think 
e I4-A 
that Mr. Khrushchev could accept it and continue the 
conference? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, I certainly do if he had 
wanted to. 
The Chairman. Do you think our President would accept 
such a statement from any other power? 
Secretary Herter. If he wanted to go to a conference? 
Certainly. 
The Chairman. My time is up. 
Senakw Wiley? 
Senator Wiley. Now in relation to that last question, 
the President suggested time and time again open skies 
arrangements hasntt he? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, 
Senator Wiley. That means that planes would be flying 
over our country and over every other country where it is 
necessary. Again, I go to the subject that I think Is most 
Important, because some quoted and I quoted on the floor of 
the Senate the other day the biblical verse that a little 
child shall lead them. I had a group of children from Oshkosh, 
Wisconsin, that I was talking to. After I talked to them, 
I opened myself to questions. One of these girls said, 
"Senators if we stop taking these flights, how are we going 
to get the information that is going on back of the Iron

Curtain?" 
Well, I think all America is asking that question, 
and I am satisfied that if we realists, as I think we are 
becoming more and more, that we are not soing to go up 
lot of blind alleys about this and that , and about lea- was 
or what wasnIt said/ we are going to face the situatiun head 
on and simply say we want to be adequate and alert and we 
want the Kremlin to know the facts as they have now for, 
I think about, three and a-half years as I think the facts 
are that we have been putting these planes over. Khrushchev 
knew it at the time that he was up at Camp David, and certainly 
knowing could have interferred with him holding the meeting 
if he wanted to, having the knowledge then. Do you think my 
conclusions are correct in that respect? 
Secretary Herter. I do. 
Senator Wiley. I didn7t get the import of the questions 
when I came in that apparently referred to some different 
groups. What is the name of the young man that defected the 
other day? I guess that is what you call it. He testified 
on one of the --
Senator Lausche. Meet the Press. 
Senator Wiley. Meet the Press. It Is a long Russian 
name. I put what he said into the record today. But one 
of the important things he brought out, and. I would like 
to get the former Ambassadors attention on this, as that 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26 : CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
130 
there is a group of young people growing up in Russia 
that have different Ideas, and he was about to go into detail 
on it when time ran out. But among other things, he Is the 
one that said, and this Is important, he said some two years 
ago that he didntt think -- well, the time I haventt gots 
but some months ago he said that Khrushchev and the powers 
in being would not permit the President to come to Russia. 
They would find some excuse. 
Now, that is all in what he said over the wire here 
a couple of weeks ago. That confirms, I presumesyour own 
idea that when Khrushchev came to Paris, it was already 
decided that he was going to throw the bombshell, and he 
would refuse the invitation and so forth, is that right? 
Secretary Herter. That is right. 
Senator Wiley. So this is something that didnrt result 
from the shooting down or the downing of the plane. 
I want to ask you a question. Have you any definite 
information as to whether or not this young Powers is alive? 
Secretary Herter. No, sir. We have no Information other 
than that which the Russians have furnished to us. 
Senator Wiley. If that plane had been shot down, do you 
think the instruments that he had with him would have remained 
intact? 
Secretary Herter. There, sir, I am not skilled enough 
In the technique of shotting down planes. But I should think

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
131 
it is very doubtful if he was hit by a rocket whether either 
he or the plane would have come down intact. 
Senator Wiley. Is there any thought that perhaps they 
have the plane? They claim they have the Instruments 
ard they have shown something which wasnit the plane. Do you 
think they havethat intact? 
Secretary Herter.. They have shown a laterphotograph 
of a .plane which those who built the plane feel is the 
Plane itself. They have also shown pieces of the plane 
in. Gorky Park in oscow when they invited all the d5p7,:cmats 
to come and look at i, and I think our people ,7ee1 that that 
is a geniune part of theytane. 
Senator Wiley. I want to ask the ;:e-vmer Ambassador --
es it true that the youth in Russ1A, the new class of youth 
is gv.ewing-ep like this fellow eaid, that someone said if 
he were privileged to carry on that answer he would have 
said they are not satisfied with their standard of living 
they are not satisfied with the little opportunity they have 
to express themselves in the political life of Russia? Do 
you know whethe2 Oat would be true or not? 
My. Bohlen, I Odnk it is a fair assumption, Senator. 
3f courtier as you know, the possibilities for contacts in 
there dung the period I was there were considerably less than 
they are now. The country is still totally controlled by 
the mechanism of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3

132 
They control all modes of expression by press, meetings, or 
anything else, so it is very difficult to get any overt 
signs of the feelings of the youth or any other section of 
the population. 
But there are certain indications that the youth are 
looking forward at some time in the future to considerably 
different circumstances. They hope for better material conditions 
and also undoubtedly hope for a period when they will have 
more freedom of expression and more ability to participate 
in the political life of their country. 
But this is very hard to document because people .do 
not talk openly and freely_ in the Soviet Union.

,.$enator Wiley. _Well, you know that .the ferment generally 
is all ever this world. You know that the, President of 
Turkey has been kicked put. You saw that today0. and you 
know what is happening elsewhere. Is there any reason why 
that yeast or ferment should not be operating in Russia 
among the youngsters?' 
Mr. Bohlen. There is no reason why it should not be 
and it is a logical assumption it is. But I should also say 
that the controls in a society like the Soviet Union are 
very tight indeed and I have seen no sign that those 
controls axe breaking down or weakening to the point 
where the party is not in complete control of the situation. 
They are able to stifle? if you will, or hold in check 
this ferment due to the nature of their system. 
Senator Wiley. Out of the two hundred million Russians 
how many of them do you think belong to the Communist 
Party? 
Mr. Bohlen. I think the latest figure is somewhere 
in the neighborhood of 8 million. 
Senator Wiley. Thank you. That is all. 
The Chairman, The Senator from Montana? 
Senator Mansfielo Mr. Secretaryo it has been reported 
that at the House hearingso you said there were indications 
that even before May 6 the Russians planned to scuttle 
the conference.

Nowe it seems to me if we are going to estimate the 
importance of the incident in the conaPse of the summit: 
we need to fix the date when these indications in any 
(:) significant fashion began to appear. I would appreciate 
then in the interest of saving time, yes or no answers 
to certain questions which I am about to ask unless 
there is a need of an elaboration. 
The first question: .Are you aware whether any member 
of the Cabinet or the President had any reason to believe 
on May 15 when Ithrushchev made his demands for an apology 
and so forthe that he would come to Paris and leave as he 
did. 
Secretary Herter. No, 
Senator Mansfield. Were there any indications that 
Khrushchev planned to scuttle the conference before the U-2 
plane was shot down on May 1? 
Secretary Herter. No. 
Senator Mansfield. Did Khrushchevas Baku speech 
precede or follow Mr. Dillon's speech to the AFL-CIO 
Convention? 
Secretary Herter. It followed it. 
Senator Mansfield. Would you classify Mr. Dillon's 
speech as very much in the spirit of Camp David or would 
you say it was an excellent0 forthright and anti-Communist 
statement somewhat Oblivious to the spirit of Camp

David: the kind of speech which any official of the State 
Department might have made before that historic meeting? 
Secretary Herter. That I can"c qualify with a yes or no 
answer, Senator. 
Senator Mansfield. You can to into detail there. 
Secretary Herter. I would say this/ that Mr. Dillon's 
speech was almost a requirement as an answer to the 
allegations that had been made by Mr. Khrushchev against 
Adenauer and the Germans and his continued repetition 
which I have given the chronology of: of the fact that they 
were going to take this unilateral position sooner or later with-
out its being an absolute ultimatumon the subject of Berlin, 
Germany. 
Senat)r Mansfield. In other words/ Mr. Secretary/ 
speeches which you and Mr Dillon made were a counteraction 
to the gradual hardening of Mr. Khrushchev's speeches 
in the period preceding that? 
Secretary Herter. Entirely. 
Senator Mansfield. Did Secretary Dillon propose that 
a U-2 flight be undertaken prior to the summit conference? 
Mr. Dillon. No. 
Semtox Mansfield. . Mr. Dillon/ as acting Under Secretary/ 
were you aware beforehand of the scheduling of the U-2 
flight over the Soviet Union on May 1? 
Mr. Dillon. No0 I was not aware of it.

knowledge? 
Mr. Aillon. Yes. 
Senator Mansfield. Mr. Herter happening to be out of 
the country at the tine was, I assume- unaware of any specific 
flight but perhaps had general knowledge that these flights 
were being undertaken and had been over a period of years. 
Secretary Herter. The first knowledge I received was 
when I was in Ankara I didn't know there was a flight 
under way. All I heard was this same report that a plane 
was down. 
Senator Mansfield. Now both of you have had general 
knowledge of this: Would it be a fair assumption to 
? 
says despite the fact that the President undertook: in a 
certain sense: personal responsibility for this particular 
flights that he: too: likewise, had only general knowledge 
but that because of his position as the Chief of State: 
he would be held responsible under any circumstances 
because of his position of responsibility?

bilities of flights but not this particular flight as such. 
Senator Mansfield. That would apply to the Department 
of State and the President. 
Secretary Herter. That is correct. 
Senator Mansfield. From what legislation or executive 
orders or both, was the authority for these flights of 
deep penetration derived? 
Secretary Herter. Well, presumably from the act that I 
have here before me I am told that this applied to two 
specific acts. The one that I am particularly familiar 
with, that I had a moment ago is the one creating the 
Central Intelligence Agency. The other is the National 
Security Act. 
Senator Mansfield. Would it be possible to have 
copies for the record at this point?

Senator Mansfield. Now the question to rePeats by what 
authority have these flights now been suspended? 
Secretary Herter. By direction of the President. 
Senator Mansfield. By a presidential directive. 
Could we have a copy of that for the record? 
Secretary Herter. Yes I assume so, I don't know 
whether it was given in writing or whether it was done by 
word of mouth. 
Senator Mansfield. Well will you look into it 
and see what you can do to comply with the request? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, 
Senator Mansfield. Will this order suspending the 
flights automatically remain in force after President 
Eisenhower leaves office and until it is superseded by 
another order of some future President? 
Secretary Herter. It could be. The Presidents 
responsibility as Commander in Chief which gives him 
the right to give an order of this kind would, of course 
expire with him. It would only be through some treaty 
obligation that there would be a binding commitment on the

Senator Mansfield, Do I understand you correctly then, 
to state e that this order would automatically die ulth the 
leaving of office by President Eisenhower s and become 
effective again would have to be once again initiated by 
the next President? 
Secretary Herter. I think so. I believe another 
President would be free to do as he sees fit. 
(At this point: Senator Humphrey entered the 
hearing room.) 
Senator Mansfield. Have Russian experts in the executive 
branch suggested the possibility that Khrushchev's position 
at home may have become seriously undermined? 
Secretary Herter. Yes. 
Senator Mansfield. Do you believe that the U-2 may have 
been a contributing factor to this undermining? 
Secretary Herter. It may have been. May I elaborate 
on that? 
It may have been in the sense that it must have been 
a great shock to both the military and to the civilian leaders 
in Russia to find that they had been as open as they were 
for such a long period of time. 
Senator Mansfield. And to him as well.

Secretary Herter. That si y cannot answer categorically. 
I think that thatis a pure mattes of guesswork. 
Senator Mansfield. All right., 
Whate in the view of our Russian experts is the most 
probable coalition of influential forces in the Soviet union 
andjh world Communism that could bring about Khrushchev's 
downfall? 
Secretary Herter. There? sire I am afraid of my own know-
ledge I could not answer that. If you would like for 
Mr. Bohlen to answer that, he is as good an authority as we 
have on the subject. 
Senator Mansfield. If you wille Mr. Bohlen, but before 
you doe I would like to throw out indications that perhaps 
the militarye the Chinese Communists and forces of that 
kind might be considered. 
Mr. Bohlen. Senator, / honestly in all sincerity 
it is not possible to answer that question. I think in 
(:) events dealing with the Soviet Union in view of the secrecy 
and general secrecy prevailing in the Communist Bloc it is 
only after the events that you can hope to trace them 
beck and see what particular influences have seemed to

way in which kfcreilner. can ascertain what.the varying 
degrees of, influence 0 all factoXs whliqh go Ant!) the, 
making of any particular event. If I, might I will give. 
you one illustration of secrecy. I was not there but in 
June 1957 for ten days the Presidium of the Central Committee 
and the Central Commitee itself met in a violent inner 
row which resulted in the expulsion from both of those bodies 
of Molotov e Kaganovicho Malenkov and several others. 
This went on for ten days in Moscow and no foreigner 
in the Capital and mighty few Russians knew anything about 
IL. 
We had trained observers there. There was an extremely 
alert U.S. press corps and not one of them got any inkling 
of this major development. This / merely cite to show the 
degree of secrecy and if you are trying to get these 
things you are in truth looking into a crystal ball and 
a very cloudy one at that. 
Senator Mansfield. What you have said Mr. Bohlene 
is a reinforcement of thoughts you have previously 
stated in response to questions propounded to you by the 
Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. Bohlen. 
- That's right, sir. 
Senator Mansfield. And once again that secrecy is so great 
there that it is impossible for a Westerner to find out

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
142 
what goes on in many instances until after the fact is 
accomplished. 
Senator Mansfield. Ip it the view of the experts in 
the Department) the Russian experts that Khrushchev, even if 
he remain P in power will now take a bardex line a reversion 
to cold war type tactics in dealing with the Western 
nations. 
mr. Bohlen. The indications at present are, and 
am speaking at present, that this not necessarily will be 
SO. 
I think we can expect a propaganda campaign. The 
indication frcm his own statements and from such information as 
we have received from Moscow is that there seems to be 
no determined policy to return to the 
depths of the cold war at this time.

143 
Senator Mansfield. Would you say that if that reversion 
does take place, taking the opposite tack from what you have 
just said, and is pushed by the Kremlin or Khrushchev or his 
successor, that it will make more difficult the maintenance of 
peace? 
Mr. Bohlen. It would if it returns to a line that we 
would call the lowest phase of the cold war, it most certainly 
would, Senator. However, there are degrees in this thing of 
return to the cold war situation which are impossible to assess 
and which might not materially increase the danger of war. But 
if it went all out, sealed off the Soviet Union and the 
Communist bloc from contact with the outside world, attempted 
to exert pressures wherever they thought they could do so, I 
think undouratedly a much more dangerous world situation would 
be created. 
Senator Mansfield. Mr. Chairman, I have other questions 
but I donut want to take too much time. 
The Chairman. Senator Hickenlooper? 
Senator Hickenlooper. I donut have any questions at 
this time.

Senator wants to go, it is all right.

T-16 Senator Humphrey. If the question I ask, Mr. Secretary, 
s-2 
has already been asked, just brush it aside. I dont want to 
take any of your time on that. 
Did anyone ask as to whether or not you had any personal 
knowledge of the U-2 flight? 
Secretary Herter. Of the program? 
Senator Humphrey. No, of the particular flight. 
Secretary Herter. It was included, I said it was included 
I am sure it was included in a group of flights that I had been 
asked whether I had any obje ctions to them. 
Senator Humphrey. If you wanted to, could you have 
effectively vetoed such a policy? 
Secretary Herter, No, I could only have given my advice 
to the President. 
Senator Humphrey. Would the Vice President be aware of 
these decisions? 
Secretary Herter. I think that in the matter of the 
National Security Council, he was aware of the program in the 
larger sense. I doubt if he was familiar with any of the 
individual flights as such, but he may have been. 
Senator Humphrey. The reason I asked that question was 
.chat the Vice President intimated on a television program, I 
believe the day before the President announced in Paris) that 
the flights should continue, and the next day the President 
announced that he had already cancelled them.

145 
The Vice President said they would continue, and the next 
day the President announced that they had been suspended. 
What I am asking is, would the Vice President, as a member 
of the Security Council, have any opportunity of knowing the 
decision that had been made by the President? 
Secretary Herter. There, the days followed so quickly 
one on another that I just couldn2t answer that, whether that 
opportunity would have been offered or not. 
Senator Humphrey. Let me see if I can -- what I am trying 
to get at is the policy making machinery. 
We have a Subcommittee, as you know, that is studying the 
policy making machinery of the government, the Jackson Sub-
committee.. 
am a member of that Subcommittee.- We had, recently 
before the Subcommittee, Mr. Kendall. We have had many of the 
prominent officials of government and former officials of 
government. 
The program of the flights, the reconnaisance flights, 
was an established program, apparently was agreed upon by the 
Security Council, is that correct? 
Secretary Herter. The Security Council was aware of it, 
yes. 
Senator Humphrey. The Vice President is a member of the 
Security Council? 
Secretary Herter. Yes.

T-18 Senator Humphrey. If the Vice President states on a 
s-4 
television program that he understood that the.. flights would 
continue, yet the President announced the next day in Paris, 
that as of the previous Thursday they had already been suspended, 
do you think there was any lack of communication between the 
responsibile officials of this government? 
Secretary Herter. There, sir, I am trying to think of the 
dates. 
The Thursday on which the President gave that order was 
the day that I went to Paris. I went to Paris that night. 
The President followed two nights later and whether or 
not in that two day interval anything had been distributed with 
(:) regard to that order, I just donut know. 
Senator Humphrey. Do you have any changed views, Mr. 
Secretary, as to the value of the so-called Summitry diplomacy as 
a result of this recent meeting? 
Secretary Herter. I think as a method of carrying out 
negotiations it has taken a hard knock. 
Senator Humphrey. Have you any idea as to how we are 
going to proceed in the months ahead? I heard the Presidents 
address. It was a good address. He gave a good accounting. 
He talked about the necessity of maintaining our -- I believe 
the word was business like relationships, or at least normal 
relationships insofar as we can -- with the Soviet Union. 
Is there any projected plan as to how we will proceed with

For example, we have the Cbneva Conference still in 
session on the nuclear testing. I suppose the Disarmament 
Conference is still a reality. 
Is there to be any adjustment in these conferences, any 
changes? Are they to proceed according to the past? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, the President, I think made that 
very clear in his statement. 
Senator Humphrey. Are there any plans for any type of 
a high level Foreign Ministers9 Conference of Sub-Cabinet 
officers? 
Secretary Herter. As of now, there is not. I may add 
this with regard to the Summit; that the four nations that were 
involved in the Summit were the four nations who, as a result 
of the decisions and agreements reached after the war, were the 
four nations that have the responsibility for Berlin and for 
the final settlement of the whole German question and that is 
the reason for those four, essentially getting together. 
It is possible that again they will have to get together. 
Wbether normal diplomatic changes would make progress or Foreign 
Ministers meetings in advance would make program so that it 
would be worthwhile for them to come together, I just cant 
tell you. That is always a possibility. But almost any other 
subject, there are many other nations that are involved beside 
those four, and it is a great question in my mind whether or not

148 
that method of coming together for the resolution of problems 
would be fruitful in the future. 
Senator Humphrey. In other words, what you are indicating 
is that a Summit Conference ought to merely be the ratification, 
essentially the ratification of decisions that have been 
tentatively arrived at at the normal diplomatic levels. 
Secretary Herter. In my opinion, that is the most 
desirable thing. 
Senator Humphrey. I agree. How do you explain, or is 
there any explanation for what appears to be a contradictory 
bit of evidence ofGromyko7s blustering up at the United Nations 
on the Soviet Resolution and yet, the Soviets apparently 
conciliatory behavior in recent days with respect to the quick 
release of our plane and flyers who strayed into East Germany 
and the recent broadening of Soviet-American exchange projects? 
Secretary Herter. There again, you have got one of those 
contradictions. As I was saying earlier, the fact that the 
attitude of the people in Moscow and even the officials with 
whom our Embassy officials have to deal, have been entirely 
normal since this incident. 
It is very hard to reconcile with the very harsh words 
that both Khrushchev and Gromyko have uttered.

3antor-take Senator Humphrey. Do you lay any credence to the doctrine, 
I6-A 
or at least an observation that has been made, that while 
the Soviet tactics may change for awhile, that insofar 
as their general over-all strategy is concerned, that It will 
remain pretty much the same as it has? 
Secretary Herter. Certainly as far as their objectives 
are concerned. I think It was quite clear from some of this 
documentation that will be put into the record, that is 
the speeches that were made by Mr. Rhrushchev, that he had 
laid greater and greater emphasis on the eventual trimph 
of Communism over the world, and that he put particular 
emphasis on that in recent months before the Summit. 
(:) (At this point, Senator Case, of New Jersey, entered 
the hearing room.) 
Senator Humphrey. I have a letter from a tentleman 
who is a professor emeritus of a university up at Bennington 
College, who has had an uncanny record in my' years of 
acquaintanceship with him in understanding what goes on In 
the Soviet Union. His name is Dr. Bernard Tauev. He is a 
former social Democrat of some 35 years ago from Austria, 
a professor of politcal economy, now retired, He mi5nitors 
(:) Soviet broadcasts, studies Soviet literature, particularly 
photographs and what-have-you. Just to Give you a little 
background, he predicted to me some three weeks, I guess it 
was before it happened/ the removal of Beria. I have a letter

2 here from him right before me, and it is a letter telling 
how Mr. Khrushchev was going to scuttle the Summit Conference, 
written on April 25th, this letter is. And I also have a 
letter from him here which indicates that this -- he says, 
"The Soviet leader will now do everything possible to prove 
that Eisenhower is a war-mongerer and an imperalist aggressor 
and not a man of peace, in action not merely in words. We 
must, therefore, prepare ourselves for all kinds of provocations 
all around the world." 
His thesis is that Khrushchev had been selling the Soviet 
people upon the idea that President Eisenhower was a man of 
peace and man with whom he could deal. I dontt mean deal 
in the sense of the crudeness of that word, but one with 
whom he could conduct reasonably good negotiations, and that 
when the President accepted the responsibility for the flights 
and didntt accept the opportunity, at least what some people 
say was an opportunity of removing himself fromthat responsibility 
that Mr. Khrushchev took this as a very personal matter, 
since he had staked his reputation in the Kremlin and in 
the consuls of the Communist Party upon the fact that he 
could work with Eisenhower, and that Eisenhower had in a sense 
not merely upset the diplomatic applecart by referring to 
this is Mr. Khrushchev, the explanation that is given to me 
here that Mr. Khrushchev felt that Eisenhower had not only 
upset the diplomatic applecart. But, more importantly, from a

subjective point of view of Khrushchev put Khrushchev 
in a very difficult position with Communist Chinese, 
with the Right Wing Stalinists in the Soviet Union, so. that 
Khrushchev is now making a personal crusade out of attacking 
the President. 
What is your view of this? I am going to give you this 
letter. I have a thole series of these, and this Is a very 
remarkable man, may I say. 
At this point, Senator Aiken entered the hearing 
room.) 
Senator Humphrey. For example, I have a letter from him 
two weeks bePore the recent shake-up in the Soviet Union 
which was not too fundamental, but indicating some of the 
changes that were going to be made, by a very careful analyst 
of broadcasts and meetings and literature. I had this man 
down to see the late Senator Walter George some of you may 
recall, and he was very helpful at one time. What is your 
view of Mr. Khrushchevts reactions lately to the Presidents 
the personal venom that he seems to exhibit? 
Secretary Herter. I am particularly interested in two 
things, Senator, in the letter that you have just read; one, 
the fact that it was written before the U-2 incident. 
Senator Humphrey. Yes. 
Secretary Herter. In which this authority cites the 
fact that Mr. Khrushchev was going to scuttle the conference.

Senator Humphrey. I think that substantiates essentially 
what you were sayinis this morning, your own observations 
on this. 
Secretary Herter. Yes. The second has to do with the fact 
thc't the President dldnit accept the way out which Mr. Khrushchev 
appeared to offer him. My own feeling with regard to that 
second matter is that it was very much of a trgp. That what 
Mr. Khrushchev thought might happen is that the President 
would disclaim personal responsibility and that then 
Mr. Khrushchev would say. "The situation is even more dangerous 
tun I thought, because this means that that same little frantic 
group in the Pentagon" -- and that is the phrase that he used 
in his press conference-"is running the government of the 
United States without the President knowing about it, and 
that makes our situation even worse" and he would have 
inveighed in exactly the same terms and asked the President 
for exactly the same apologies and punishments which he 
asked for later. 
I think that the element of personal pique certainly 
played a part in the whole show.

Senator Aiken. I won!t take long. 
Speaking of the reaction of the rest Urthe world, have 
you made any analysis of the reaction of the other countries 
of the world relative to the collapse of the Summit meeting? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, I think we have. It isntt, of 
course: complete. This will mean a study from a great many 
nations and bring this altogether in one place. 
I think that: perhaps, the best indication has been 
the attitude among the representative?s at the United Nations 
where you have got a cross-section from the rest of the world. 
From the very outset of the Russian complaint there it was 
very obvious they weren$t going to be able to get any votes 
from their calling this an aggression, except Soviet bloc 
votes. 
Some of the smaller countries, two of them, abstained 
in the final vote for reasons that were of a rather different 
nature. 
But,by and large, we have heard no sympathy from the 
point of view of what you might call the uncommitted nations 
or the free nations of the world for the attitude that 
Mr. Khrushchev took.

2 Senator Aiken. Are you satisfied we have not lost 
the prestige throughout the world, as a result of or lost 
more than Russia has. 
Secretary Herter. May I say, sir, that in my opinion 
our alliances are firmer than they have ever been. 
Senaor Aiken. What was the significance of the shake-up 
in the Russian government prior to the U-2 incident, I believe, 
last April, was it not, when Mr. Kozlov was promoted, and 
coupled with that question, why don't we hear anything 
about Mr. Mikoyan any more? Has -he been isolated or jut 
got out of thenews, or what has happened with him? 
Secretary Herter. Mr. Bohlen, who is our expert, 
is also the tenstrof the document,; 80 I am afra.1.d he has 
gone out of the room at the moment. 
With regard to the disappearance of Mr. Mikoyan, 
we have been told this is just a normal vacation he has 
taken down to the Black Sea. It is true in years gone by 
he had taken rather extended vacations there, and whether 
this is true or not we cantt say. 
With respect to the shake-up, I think the only significance 
that it had were that two of the strengest members of 
the Central Committee were sent to other responsibilities 
and this may haVecbeen a personal strengthening of 
Mr. Khrushchevts power within the Committee itself. But 
154 
it was not considered very highly significant.

Senator Aiken. That is Mr. Kozlovfs promOtion, is 
not significant? 
Secretary Herter9 I donft thSnk so. I didnft know that 
he as such had been promoted. 
Secretary Herter. Well, a long time ago, I think vhen 
Mr. Averill Harriman was visiting in Russia. 
Senator Aiken. Yes 
Secretary Herter. He reported that Mr. Kozlov 
had been pointed out to him by Mr. Khrushchev as his 
successor, saying that he and Mikoyan were too old to carry 
on and that Kozlov was the number two man. But there w.a.s no 
telling whether he was saying ,;'hat seriously or whether he 
was being flattering about it because Mr. Kozlov was 
thre at the time. 
Senator Aiken. I thought he made the best impression 
of any of our Russian visitors last summer. At least when 
he came before this Committee/ I thought he did.

I have no further questions. 
The Chairman. The Senator from Oregon. 
Senator Morse. Mr. Secretary, I think it would be hlepful 
for this record If you made a statement in regard to the 
functions of NASA, and the part that NASA played in connection 
with the U-2 flight. 
I,dopt. think the record is very clear what the 
functions of NASA, and what juriSdiction, if any, the State 
Department has over NASA and what the relationship between 
NASA and the Security Council is, and the State Department, 
Secretary Herter. NASA, as you know, is an agency devoted 
entirely to the peaceful development of satellites and outer 
space vehicles of one kind or another. 
Its operations have now been separate out from what 
were called purely military operations, althoughlt is 
always inevitable in the development of boosters that there 
should be an Interrelationship between the two, because 
the military vehicle and the peaceful vehicle have tot 
the same problems of propulsion to get up into the air. 
The witnesses of NASA, of course, will be before the 
Committee. 
most of the U-Vs 
are used by NASA In connection with pure4 scientific work,

meteorological work. Actually, the Japanese Government 
found them tremendously valuable in tracing the course of 
tornadoes last year, and I think that NASA put out at least 
three publications on their findings from the U-2 weather 
observations. 
With respect to the actual development of events 
in relation to NASA s I am sorry to say that I can,t give you 
arst-hand information. 
Perhaps Mr. Dillon can supplement that as it occurred 
while I was overseas and when Mr. Dillon was in charge. 
Mr. Dillon. All I can say is as far as I know the 
State Department didn,t have any direct relationships with 
NASA on this matter, and the relationships that there were, 
were handled by the Central Intelligence Agency 
so either Mr. Dulles or the NASA witnesses 
themselves will be able to inform you on that.

Senatr Morse. Why would NASA make a statement in regard 
to this plane if it was under the jurisdiction of CIA. 
,Mr. Dillon. On the cover story it was ip the,open, 
it was .under the jurisdiction of, NASAJ the plane Was. , 
Actually, or this oPera'cion it ,was under the jurisdiction of 
CIA 
Senator More. Thereforeo NSA a in your opinion? 
was acting within the proprieties when it issued the statement 
that it issued. 
Mr. Dillon, r think so, yes. 
Senator Morse. You think it had cleared that statement 
with CIA or had authority from CIA to issue it. 
Secretary Herter. I think so. 
Mr. Dillon. They should have, as I understood the 
matter, these guidelines to answer questions were prepared by 
CIA. They were gone over with State Department people a day 
or two before. We had thought that NASA was going to 
handle this in the way of answering questions, which we knew 
they would get, because this was a NASA plane, and 
they apparently chose instead to forestall the questions 
just by putting it all out in the formof a statement. 
Senator Morse. I raise the question because I want to

do what I.could in order to clarify, the record in regard 
to the allegation made that there is not the best of 
coordination between the State Departments CIA: Pentagon 
Builiang and now NASA, and that there may be a need for a 
centralization in the State Department of the authority 
to authorize any statement by any of these agencies in regard 
to a situation such as this, because of some possible 
reason to believe that if this had been centzalizedmore 
we would not have been having different statements coming 
from different agencies. 
Mr. Dillon. We were not aware, actually of the 
fact that NASA was going to mlke as formal a statement as 
this, and it was somewhat of a surprise. 
The Chairman. I could not hear that answer. 
VW. Dillon. I say we were not aware of the fact that 
NASA was going to make such a formal statement as this, 
and I am not sure that the Central Intelligence Agency 
was either. 
Al/ the relationships -- as I said in my original 
statement, there was coordinations there was a decision that 
the statements were going to be made by the State 
Department. 
That decision was taken and made known to the other 
agencies concerned, which were the Department of Defenses 
and the Central Intelligence Agency then on the morning 
of May 5th. 
The Central Intelligence Agency had the relationships

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
160 
with NASA and undertook to pass that on which we had no 
relationships so far as NASA. was concerned. They didn't 
know we were in this things and somehow, this statement 
was put out by NASA somewhat more complete than we expected 
but it was along the lines of the material that they had 
been furnished. 
Senator Morse. Turning to a question that Senator 
Humphrey asked and may I assure you that I am quite non-
political in raising thate I am only seeking to find cut 
who had knowledge of what in regard to the mattero I refer 
to the May 27 issue of the WashingtonPosto in this article 
by Mr. Roberts in the course of which he said "Nowhere 
in the three and a half hour television program did 
Nixon refer to any presidential direction inthe U-2 
crisis other than his approval ofthe flights some years 
earlier. Nor was there any reference to his own part in 
the affair. Nixono of course? sits in the National 
Security Council. Nixon did say that he was privy to 
the U-2 reconnaissance policy, and I do endorse ite and 
he also said el knew about this flight.'" 
Nowe my interpretation, Mr. Secretarye of your testimony 
is that neither you nor the President knew of this specific 
flight going to be taken at the time that it was takene but 
that you did know that there was a general program for such 
flights and that this flight could be considered as a part

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
161 
of that program. 
Now I ask you do you have any reason to believe that 
Nixon knew anything that you and the President did not 
know and that maybe just an unfortunate use of language when 
he says nI knew about this flight", and that he probably 
means that he knew about the general program of reconnais-
sance. 
Secretary Herter. I would assume it was about the general 
program rather than tout the particular flight. 
Senator Morse. But as :Ear as you know the National 
Security Council did not brief its mnbers in regard to 
any particular flights without also notifying the President 
in regard to specific flights. 
Secretary Herter, No I think the National Security 
Council was only aware of the general program. 
Senator Morse. Are you a member of the National 
Security Council? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, I am. 
Senator Morse. One final question at this round, Mr. 
Secretary: As you know 10 along with everyone else, I 
think, who has the interest of peace at heart, am very much 
concerned about long continuation of this nuclear armament 
race. 
Do you think that the United States and the Western 
Powers on the one hand, and Russia, on the other, can

continue this nuclear armament race with its constant 
increase and Acceleration for another ten years, and not create 
the great probability of war. 
Secretary aerter. I don't know about the great 
prambility of ware Senator but I would say certainly 
increase the chances of war. 
Senator Morse. I know we are of one mind but I want the 
record to show it, this particular one mind: Do you agree 
with me that our generation simply has the responsibility 
in history to find some honorable way to end this nuclear 
armament race? 
secretary Herter. I agree with you completely on that. 
Senator Morse. Do you think that we ought to do every-
thing that we can to try to get the United Na ions to 
exercise greater jurisdictional authority in connection 
with this whole matter of armament race than We have 
been able to get it to do so far? 
Secretary Herter, Senator? some time ago, I made a 
speech in connection with disarmament in which I stated my 
views as to the great necessity in the following years to find-
ing some answer to thise and at the same time finding an answer 
within the framework of the United Nations of an authority 
which could maintain the peace with law and I still feel that 
just as strongly as I did at the time / made that speech.

on the cases it has handled and the cases that we have

Senator Carlson. Mr. Secretary, recently one of our 
Nations financial writers, writing on the conditions of Russia, 
wrote that Mr. Khrushchev was proposing a devaluation of the 
currency as of January 1st, and he stated that no nation tampers 
with its currency unless they are in financial difficulty. 
What do we know about. the financial and economic condition 
of Russia that would lead us to believe or do we know that he 
is planning on devaluating the currency? 
Secretary Herter. This, I hadnyt heard at all. I hadn3t 
seen that particular statement and I hale seen no where in 
any report any indications that they were planning to devalue 
their currency. 
There is no question but what their foreign exchange rate, 
their official rate, dont correspond with reality. They have 
got two rates: one an official rate and one a tourist rate. They 
are very far apart. One is four rubles to the dollar and one 
is ten rubles to the dollar. But from the point of view of their 
internal financial situation, I have heard no reports they were 
planning to devalue the ruble. 
Senator Carlson. We have had evidence that there is social 
unrest among the people, thinking that they are entitled to better 
living conditions, better homes and housing. 
Do we have any evidence of that? 
Secretary Herter, Yes, I think there is. But this is 
a matter that Mr. Bohlen testified to a few moments ago. 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3

165 
Senator Carlson. That there is? 
Secretary Herter. There is evidence of that. As Mr. 
Bohler said, it is impossible to get documentary evidence as 
such, because of the secrecy and the discipline in their 
society, but I think that every visitor to Russia who has 
had a chance to talk with the workmen or the students at the 
university and so on, have come back with that feeling. 
After all, Mr. Khrushchev has made a good many statements 
about the necessity of increasing the standard of living of 
their people. 
In their incentives that they offer from the point of 
view of their workers, better living conditions in these 
housing projects is one of the principal incentives that they 
have been offering in the past, giving people priority if their 
particular sections of a plant do particularly well from the 
point of view of production, they will be advanced to better 
living quarters. 
think that the urge for better living quarters and a 
better standard of living, more consumer goods, is a very real 
one. 
Senator Carlson. Does the State Department have any evi-
dence of a labor shortage in Russia based on a statement that 
was recently made that Mr. Khrushchev reduced his military 
strength because it was necessary to get some of the people 
back into the labor market?

166 
Secretary Herter, Yes. Very recently there has been 
a study that I think will be made available to you, made on 
the whole question of the labor problem in Russia. 
It is an extremely interesting one from the point of view 
of the present situation and the relationship of women at work 
compared with men and the very large excess number of women 
over men that exists in Russia today. 
There is certainly every reason to believe that Mr. 
Khrushchev9s announced reduction of the Armed Forces was an 
effort to increase the male labor force by taking the extra 
men out of the Armed Services when he said he was planning to 
reduce from some three million, six hundred thousand down to 
two million, four hundred thousand; that the principal purpose 
of that was to get a larger working force. 
Senator Carlson. Is it not reasonable to assume then: 
that Mr. Khrushchev does have some problems, internal problems, 
and that that may have some effect on his actions and his 
decision at Paris? 
Secretary Herter. That undoubtedly is true. He has had 
some other internal difficulty that you undoubtedly know about, 
Senator, in connection with the new land that was planted: an 
area that has not been too successful and this was something on 
which he had backed very heavily to increase the food supply of 
Russia and I think he had been rather heavily criticized 
because it hadn9t worked out as planned.

The Chairman, Senator Gore? 
Senator Gore. Returning, Mr. Secretary, to the examina-

administrative procedure, I would like to inquire when you 
personally first learned of the President os order that the U-2 
flights would be discontinued? 
Secretary Herter. At the time that he gave it. 
Senator Gore. When did he give it? 
Secretary Herter. My recollection is that it was 
immediately after a meeting at the White House on Thursday 
morning at about noon. 
(:) Senator Gore. Did he give the order to you? 
Secretary Herter. No, he did not give the order to me, 
think it was through General Goodpaster, but I am not quite 
certain. 
Senator Gore. How did you know that it was given? 
Secretary Herter. I heard him. 
Senator Gore. You heard him give the order? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, 
Senator Gore. And this was on Thursday? 
Secretary Herter. This was on 'Thursday.

Allen Dulles was not present and I have forgotten -- I think 
Gates was present after a Cabinet meeting it was. 
Senator Gore. I didnit understand. 
Secretary Herter. After the Cabinet meetin 
Senator Gore. After the Cabinet meeting? 
Secretary Herter. Right, 
Senator Gore. That settles that. You heard the order 
issued, and I will have no further question as to where it was 
issued and to whom. If you heard it issued to Secretary 
Gates, that settles one question specifically. 
But you do not know whether the Vice President was in-

Senator Gore. On this question of coordination or lack 
thereof, in addition to NASA and the State Department, to 
which Senator Morse referred, there is the State Department, 
NASA/ Mr. Hagerty and officials within the Department and 
perhaps others. 
Did Mr. Hagerty operate in this field strictly as Press 
Secretary or did he undertake some Executive function? 
Secretary Herter, I know of no Executive function that 
he assumed. 
Senator Gore. I would like to ask Mr. Dillon when -- well, 
will ask you. 
Was Mr. Hagerty present when the President issued the 
(:) order that the flights would stop? 
Secretary Herter, No. 
Senator Gore. Do you know if he knew about it? 
Secretary Herter I cant tell you. 
Senator Gore. Are you aware of the fact that the New;

had been issued? 
Secretary Herter. No, Ididnit even know that, I left

T-18 6,-Alator Gore. Mr. Dillon, on May 5th Mr. Hagerty told a 
s8 
press conference that the State Department and NASA would issue 
statements. Were you aware of this? 
(:) Mr. Dillon. I have very recently learned that he indicated 
that NASA would issue a statement as such. 
It was decided that the State Department would issue a 
statement. I hadnIt been aware that he had said we were. 
But it had been decided and he knew it had been decided that we 
were going to do it. 
Senator Gore. You say you very recently learned this. 
How recently? 
Mr. Dillon. I think a day ago or i;oo days ago that 
someone from the press said that he had told the press when 
they were there that NASA would issuP a statement, so that 
they could get their information from NASA. 
Senator Gore, Did Mr. Hagert suggest to you that the 
State Department issue a statement? 
Mr. Dillon. No, it was decided when we first heard of 
this, this news, as I said earlier ni.11 morning, at this 
National Security Council meeting or right after it that was 
held outside of Washington, that the State Department would 
handle the publicity on this, and that we would make any 
statement that would be made, and it was known at that time that 
we would make a statement. 
Now, Mr. Hagerty was not at the Security Council meeting, 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3

but he was at that area out there where this exercise was 
taking place and so he was aware of the fact that the State 
Department would be making a statement at noon that day at our 
regular press conference time. 
Actually, the statement was delayed forty-five minutes. 
It was made at 12:45 when our regular daily press conference 
took place. 
Senator Gore. Was it decided there that NASA would make 
a statement also? 
Mr. Dillon. It was not to my knowledge, .no. It was not 
decided there that NASA would make a ,Statement. 
Senator Gore. Who made that decision? 
Mr. Dillon.. I think that you have to ask NASA. I donut 
know, who made any such decision. 
The fact is, as I have said earlier, I thought that NASA 
would answer questions. 
I didnIt know they were going to make a statement until 
I saw it. 
Senator Gore. You donut know whether NASA or whether 
Mr. Hagerty made that decision? 
Mr. Dillon. I have no idea, no. I would assume NASA 
made it because we did know that NASA would have to answer 
questions because this was a NASA plane that was lost and the 
reporters were going to find out how high the plane flew, what 
kind of a plane it was, anything they knew about it and we had

given them -- the Intelligence Agency had given them good 
answers on how to answer such questions. 
Senator Gore. You say you assume this. You did not 
know it? 
Mr. Dillon. I knew they had given them that material. 
I knew that as a fact: but we did not know that they were 
going to use that and put it into the form of a statement as 
it actually came out. 
Senator Gore, But Mr. Hagerty did know that a statement 
by NASA would be made? 
Mr. Dillon, I dongt know that what he said meant that 
he knew they were going to make a formal statement or whether 
he was just tains that as a phrase, indicating that they would 
answer questions. 
He may have thought they were going to make a statement. 
I just dont know that. He may have called them up and asked 
them, I dont know, 
Senator Gore. Did: in fact: both the State Eepartment and 
NASA make statements subject to Mr. Hagertygs notice to the 
press that they would do so? 
Mr. Dillon, The State Department made its statement and 
NASA made one about three quarters of an hour later: yes.

Secretary Herter. That was in September as I recall 
it. 
Senator Lausche. Did Khrushchev since May lst, make 
any statements indicating that the Soviet had knowledge 
of American reconnaissance planes over their territory? 
Secretary Herter. None. 
Senator Lausche. Based upon his statements and upon 
the knowledge which he claims the Soviet possess at day 
was it that he understood the first American plane flew over 
theSoviet? 
Secretary Herter. I can't identify that. My recollection 
is that when he was in Paris he made the statement tha: he 
knew about these overflights at the time thathe was at Camp 
David and that he thought there was something fishy about

Senator Lausche. Well,, then at Camp David he did state 
that at that time he knew that our planes were flying over 
the Soviet. 
Secretary Herter. That is at he said later when he 
got to Paris. 
Senator Lausche. When he, got to Paris? 
SeoretarY Herter. When hP gPt to PeriP. He never 
mentioned it at Camp David or at any time between Camp 
David and Paris. 
Senator Lausche. Well, if he knew at Camp David 
that our reconnaissance planes were flying over the 
Soviets and he said nothing about its can you give 
any reason for him remaining silent on the subject? 
Secretary Herter. He was asked that question in a press 
conference in Paris? 
(At this point? Senator Hickenlooper left the 
hearing room.) 
I haven't got here the exact words of response but I 
think we could dig them out for yous and tell you just what he 
said in answer to that himselfs but as I recollects he said 
he felt that this was an inappnpriate moment to bring 
it up but that he did think there was something fishy 
about the President at that time. 
Senator Lausche. Then at Camp Davide when he knew that 
our planes were flying over his land e he was discussing what

was to be the summit conference/ is that correct? 
Secretary Herter. What he hoped would be the summit 
conference. 
Senator Lausche. And if we take him at his word at 
that time he hoped to have a summit conference although he knew 
then that we were supposedly committing a flagrant transgression 
against his rights. 
Secretary Herter. That is correct, from his own later 
testimony. 
Senator Lausche. Can you reconcile those two positions 
as both being trues one that he honestly intended 
to attend a summit conference and, twos that he knew our planes 
were flying over his land. 
Secretary Herter. HO, it would be very difficult 
to reconcile the two. It ia very difficult particularly 
to reconcile the tremendous issue that he made of 
it later when he knew about it all the time/ ,according 
to his own statement. 
Senator Aiken. Will the Senator yield? You will find 
it on page 16 of Khrushchev's statement that Twinings then 
Chief of Staff sent a plane over Russia the day after he 
left/ went into Kiev or whatever it is0 it is the third 
paragraph on page 18. 
Senator Lausche. Yes.

Secretary Herter. May 15 he came to Paris. 
Senator Lausche. He came to Parise he said nothing about 
this knowledge that he had supposed to have had while he 
was at Camp David. 
Secretary Herter. That is my recollection. I would 
want to check on that. It is possible that he may have 
said something at the Presidium meeting before he left 
Moscow. My expert here tells me he did note and 
that wasmy recollection that he had never mentioned it 
until he got to Paris. 
Senator Lausche. Can one rationalize the furor of 
his resentment in May of 1960 compared to his admitted silence at 
Camp David about simi/ar flights? 
Secretary Herter No one cannot. 
Senator Lausche. Mow then r last January 18, Dulles 
appeared, Allen Dulles appeared before our committee, and 
at that time he merely on the surface scratched what I 
thought was a very vital question: The comparative ease 
with which the Soviet gets information in the United States 
and the impregnable wall that bars us from getting us in 
the Soviet.

ask you the question Mr. Herter, to give your 
understanding of the facilitY with wh1Ch we get the, infor-
mation out of the Soviet, and that whidhthey get out of the 
United States. 
Secretary Herter. Senator, as you know, we have what 
we call an open society. We are very proud of it in which 
we have complete freedom of the pree's0 in which except for 
matters of highest security, very freely talked dbout, and 
a great deal is published. 
Our technical magazines publish a great deal from the 
point of view of vital military information. Our 
installations in this country, while no direct overflights 
are permitted, can be photographed with comparative ease from an 
angle of one side. 
Generally speaking we have had no restrictions at 
all on travel in the United States except for a few 
very small circumscribed areas, like the Atomic Energy 
Agency plants, and we have had restrictions on Soviet 
citizens traveling in this country which have been taken 
entirely as a retaliatory measure because of the 
limitations put on the travel of Americans in Russia. 
Senator Lausche. Right. 
Secretary Herter. The Soviet Society, as you know, 
is a closed society, where one moves and goes only where they 
tell you you can go or when they tell you you can go.

Senator Lausche. TAis morning in answer to a question 
assuming that a Soviet plane as over. gthe United Statesa 
what We would do about it, You ee44 tbat there is no need 
of them sending planes for reconnaissance PurPoses because 
they can get that information without going through 
that effort. 
(Senator Williams left the hearing room.) 
Secretary Herter. That is quite so. 
Senator Lausche. That is they can go to Cape Canaveral 
and pretty simply see what is going on there. 
Secretary H rter. Well, sire there are newspaper 
men down at Cape Canaveral all the time and a good 
many visitors, 
Senator Lausche. Now the fact is that The Soviets 
still consider that secrecy and the security of:" 
everything relating to their military operations is one 
of their great assets a and they have no intention whatever 
of changing that Those are the words of Dulles'. 
"Moreover they have no intention of letting us into areas 
of military importance." 
That is there is a difference between the Soviet getting 
information here and our getting it in the Soviet. 
Secretary Herter. Oh a a very great difference. It is 
the whole difference between an open and a closed society. 
Senator Lausche. You had been asking for this Congress

to pas a a bill that would give the State Department some 
limited control over Communists going to the Soviet Govern-
ntent Is, that corre !t? 
Secretary Herter. That is correct., 
Senator Lausche. And why have you asked that2 
Secretary Herter. Because we felt that we ought to 
have some control -- these are American citizens traveling 
abroad -- that we ought to have SOMG contral over those 
who may be going to various parts of the world 
in interest inimical to those of the United States. 
Senator Lausche. And you asked that because you have 
in mind the grave dangers that lie in the ability of a 
Communist to distribute information in the Soviet when 
he makes the visit, if he so desires. 
Secretary Herter. Yes s sir. 
Senator Lausche. That bill has not been acted upon, 
is that correct? 
Secretary Herter. That is correct. 
Senator Lausche. Is there any Wpe of legislation 
that you feel that we ought to pass with respect to the 
curtailment of theduties of the powers of the Central 
Intelligence Agency or the expansion of them. If you have 
given that subject no thought you can state it.

that 1 was told whenI was in Paris that anaccount of over-

3 The Chairman. This, again, raises this point that 
puzzles me very much. The evidence is quite clear that 
Mr. Khrushchev, if he didntt know positively, he certainly 
(:) suspected that it was our planes that were going across his 
territory, didntt he? 
Secretary Hertez!. That is what I assume. 
The Chairman. And it comes back to this point that 
he hadntt raised such a terrible fuss about it until this one, 
that is the May 1st flight which he shot down. .And, pin, it 
occurs to me that you said you couldWt-reconcile his 
difference in his attitude toward the prior flights to 
the attitude toward the May 1st flight. But isntt the 
reconcIliation, if it is explainable at all --E:am just asking 
you if there Is one -- doesfit not lie in the fact that our 
Government did take the position regarding the May 1st flight 
and this program, that this is a deliberate program which we, 
the President, takes responsibility for, and which we 
intend to continue? 
Secretary Herter. Not which we intend to continue. That 
has never been said. 
The Chairman. He interpreted it as such. Mr. Khrushchev 
C.) in his statement, which I have a copy of here -- this is his 
language. He says -- this is a quote from part of our documents 
arich says: "At his press conference, Herter made an 
outrageous statement. Far from feel guilty and ashamed of 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
187 
4 aggressive actions, he justfies them and says that he will 
continue in the future. Only countries which are in a state 
of war can act in this way. Herterts statement has made us 
doubt the correctness of our earlier conclusions that the 
President and the American Government did not know about the 
flights. Herterts statement says that this intelligence plan 
was encored by the Government." 
At least that is the way he Interpreted it, and, as we 
said bre --
Senator Lausche. Who is he? Who interpreted it? 
The Chairman. This is a quote from Mr. KhrushchevTs 
statement. He is interpreting what Mr. Herter said as 
speaking for the Government. But is this not at /east a 
possible reconciliation of the difference in attitude between 
the prior flights and the May let flight? 
Secretary Herter. It might be if one wanted to interpret 
the words that I spoke that way. There was no need of his 
interpreting those words that way. Certainly from what I said, 
that is a very far-fetched interpretation. I think he was 
interpreting it for his own purpose that way. I think that 
the one reconcilable feature between those two things is 
that in one case he had specific evidence and in the other 
case he did not. 
The Chairman. Then it is your position that neither 
your statement or the Presidents press conference can 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26 : CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
188 
5 legitimately be interpreted as an endorsement and justification 
of the flights and a policy of pursuing them In the future? 
Secretary Herter. Certainly not the policies of pursuing/ 
them in the future. The Presidentis statement that was made 
in Paris said it was perfectly clear from what I had said 
and from what he had said that there was nothing that allowed 
that inference. 
The Chairman. Did you in your background nem conference 
in Paris on Sunday; May the 15th -- I repeat the same statement 
that you had made prior thereto In Washington. 
Secretary Herter. I was asked at that background press 
conference whether or not I had made a statement that we 
would continue doing this. I repeated the very words that I had 
teed In my statement. I said I stood on those. That did not 
Imply that we would continue. 
The Chairman. Prior to that second statement; Mr. Khrushchev 
had so interpreted it. Were you aware that he had so 
Interpreted it in his statement to the Presidium? 
Secretary Herter. I think I may have been; but if one 
took cognizance of every interpretation of his of everything 
that happens in this country one would be spending all ?nets 
time trying to correct his statements. 
The Chairman. You believe that it is an unreasonable 
and far-fetched interpretation of your statement or the 
Pres1dent9s in his press conference that these would be

continued, is that correct? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, I do. 
The Chairman. Is it or is it not a fact that the press 
in this country interpvted it in that same fashion? 
Secretary HerteroI am told that some did and some did 
not. 
The Chairman. It might have been wise for us to clarify 
at that time so that we both interpreted it properly, dontt 
you think? 
Secretary Herter, That, as I think I have indicated 
earlier, referred to the cessation of the flights and not 
resuming the flights. The President had reserved to state in 
Paris in conjunction with the fact that he was going to offer 
at the United nations his plan for aerial supervision of all 
nations that would be willing to submit to it. 
The Chairman. Do you believe that any head of State 
of any important nation at least could proceed with 
negotiations at a conference under the situation at least as 
he interpreted it, that is that we intended to continue 
such flights? 
Secretary Herter. After all, Mr. Ithrushchev arrived 
in Paris and made an arrival statement there the Saturday 
before the conference saying that he expected to proceed and 
have fruitful results. 
The Chairman. For the record, In order that It is clear

7 what is involved here, I would like to read one sentences 
the one which I think you clarified that is referred to 
by Mr. KhruShchev, and I quote from the statement that was 
maie by the Department of State on. May the 7th. 
"The necessity for such activities as measures for legitimate 
national defense is enhanced by the excessive secrecies 
practiced by the Soviet Union in contrast to the free world." 
I think that is the statement that led to the interpre-
tation, do you not? 
Secretary. Herter. I am sorry, sir, I have got before me 
now the stement of May 7. Which were those words? 
The Chairman. It occurs on page 12 of the background 
documents prepared by the staff, the first paragraph at 
the top of page 12. 
Secretary Herter. .That does not in any way intimate 
that they would go on. 
The Chairman. You do not believe that that could 
reasonably be interpreted as meaning that they will continue? 
Sec:Jetary Herter. No, 
The Chairman. My time is up. 
Senator Wiley? 
(At this point, Senator Gore withdrew from the hearing 
room.) 
Senator Wiley. Mr, Secretary,. I have listened to 
this examination, and as you brought outs Mr. Chairman, I think

8 that what we had better do 2. get down to what I think is 
the basic issues not what was said or particularly done, 
but let ts see what Khrushchev did. 
On April 28th, al what has been called the speech 
at Baku, an examination of that speech shows clearly that 
the Soviet Government had come to the conclusion that It would 
get nowhere at the Summit Conference. Now, listen to this: 
"Overnight all the government-controlled radio stations" 
and get the date, May 25th -- "all the controlled radio 
stations and newspapers in the Soviet Union began to prepare 
the people for a summit failure, and flatly blamed the west. 
The same bitter tones which Khruahchev used in Paris is 
to be noted in what he said at Baku." 
And Baku was days before. 
"In a violent attack in Baku on Secretary Herter 
and under Secretary Dillon, on that same day, the Soviet 
Premier intimated that he planned to use military power to 
enforce the pronpactive seizure In the West." 
I am quoting him. 
"If the Western Powers refuse to sign a peace treaty 
with the German Democratic Republics they will not retain 
the rights and preservation on which they are insisting. 
They naturally will forfeit the right of access to West 
Berlin by land, water aid air." 
In another portion of his speech, theSoviet Premi:e 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
192 
practically admitted that he had no hope of reaching any 
agreemnt at the Summit Conference. 
He said: 
"The nearer the day, May 16th, the heads 
of Government are to meet, the more one-sided is the approach 
of certain statesmen of the Western powers of problems before 
the conference." 
Then he goes ahead and gives examples attacking 
Herter and Dillon. 
(At this point, Senator Carlson withdrew from the 
hearing room.) 
Senator Wiley, Now, I want to quote this. This 
morning I called your attention to this young Russian that 
stepped out from the inelligence department of the Russian 
Government, that was heard .He said, and I quote, "The Soviet 
Communist regime is In no way interested In allowing 
so popular a man as the American President to come to the 
Soviet Union. They are definitely afraid of the impact such 
a visit can make on the people." 
Now, If the issue is what caused Khrushchev to shoot 
his wad, so to speak, I think it is very clear that when 
he found out, one, that he couldntt make and impress upon 
his associates that were to be at the conference, two, that 
Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese were ready and Mao Tse-tung 
laced him up and down before this conference, as the record 
shows, when he found out that they adnIt want it; and, three,

10 that he was having trouble with his own gang in Russia; and, 
four: that the youth of Russia were simply getting all fed 
up: he decided before he went to Paris that he was going 
to let the balloon go up. 
(At this point, Senator Gore entered the hearing room.) 
Senator Wiley. It wasntt the question of U-2. That may 
have given them the ostensible opportunity to blow his top, 
but, as a matter of fact, he was already to go days 
before. Now, if that is the fact, and I think it is sustIned 
by the people who weigh the evidence, then there is no need 
of our inquiring into what some folks feel. They may be a 
little remiss hither and yon in our own public service. They 
were laboring under deep pressure. When you put yourself 
In the Presidents boots and go over there and see what he 
took you have got to say, HGod bless him. He held his temper 
and he handled himself so that he made all America and all 
the world proud,' arid the result was as suggested, that the 
record now shows. Look at the UN, look at Britain, what they 
say about it. And the answer is that I think we should just 
out stop our investigation and not try to ball up further 
the issue.

The p44i4man. For the record I will pay that the President 
on yesterday morning, hp heartily endorsed this inquiry. 
Senator Wiley. That what? 
The Chairman. ,The President himself said in my 
presence that he heartily endorsed this inquiry, and if the 
Senator wishes to take issue with the Presidents why I suggest 
he talk to him about it. 
Senator Wiley. Oh,no. I heard him say that. I am 
not disputing his saying it. I am just simply saying that 
where do we go from here now? 
Are we going further, are we going to try to ball 
up themency that gets the information, that has 
done such a tremendous job that three and a half years 
has given us the information. 
The Chairman. I think the Senator misunderstands the 
purpose of this meeting. It is not to. ballup anything. 
It is to try. to clarify a situation fox the benefit of 
the committee and the Senate and the country. And I 
know of no one who has the slightest purpose:In balling 
up anything.-
Has the Senator completed his questions? 
Senator Wiley. Yes, but I am sorry that I probably used 
that expression. What I meant was confuse, and if there 
is going to be further evidence would you mind telling

The Chairman. There will be no other witnesses this 
afternoon. 
Senator Wiley. Well do you expect to call some later 
on? 
The Chairman. Yes Mr. Dulles is coming on Tuesday. 
Senator Mansfield -- is the Senator through? 
Senator Wiley. Noe that is the point I am making0 
want to state in all sincerity ? gentlemen? it is your respon-
sibility if you want to call this man who has created this 
agency under the mandate of the Congress ? that we have 
appropriated money fox, and have not tied his hands 
and he is the one who brought about this. let us be frank. 
(Discussion off the record.) 
The Chairman. The Senator is misinformed if he thinks 
that is going to go in the public record. There was no inten-
tion at any time of putting this in the public record. 
Senator Wiley. Did you hear yesterday when the 
distinguished Senator from Ohio very plainly and bluntly 
said that the leaks? and I belong to a committee where 
have seen them go right from the committee room right out in 
front of the fellows who have got the mechanisms for retaining

time I have blown my top but I am simply telling you in 
the interests of my country? I think you should not call in this

other agency. I think that these gentlemen have told what 
the public know now, it is all public c but to bring 
in this other agency, I think would ba a mistake. 
The Chairman. Does the Senator saya that he knows Senators 
who have gone out of executive sessions before the microphone 
and repeated what has been said here? 
Senator Wiley. I am not putting my finger on any 
Senators0 If you want to know what is going on what have they 
got the television out there for and you are quoted every day 
as appearing before it. 
LWE, be frank and this is not the only committee 
where they spill over the beans. But / am talking about 
the Central Intelligence Agency, gentlemen, I happen 
to know something about it, and I know what it means, 
ane people over in the House know what it means, and 
sincerely hope that you will not bring Dulles before youa 
that is all I have to say. 
The Chairman. Senator Mansfield. 
Senator Mansfield. Mr. Secretary, in an attempt to 
clarify 30Me of the confusion which exists in some of 
our minds I would like to ask some questions: 
What is your present official interpretation of interna-
tional law as regards the extension of national sovereignty 
skyward. 
Secretary Herter. What? 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
197 
Senator Mansfield. What is our present official 
interpretation of international law as regards the extension 
of national sovereignty skyward? 
(:) Secretary Herter. I donut think we have any. 
C 
Senator Mansfield. We have no international law in 
that field as yet 
Secretary Herter. That I know of. There is no definition 
as to what is considered the atmosphere above the air. 
There is no accepted interpretation or verbiage when 
they are talking about the atmosphere. 
Senator Mansfield. Would you think it advisable to 
have an international conference or conferences to decide 
the question of Sovereignty in the air over a country 
and also the possibility of regulating the seas in 
a more orderly fashion. 
Secretary Herter. Wella as you knowa we have tried 
for over a year to get the United Mations to get 
the outer space committee organized and under way. 
Senatr Mansfield. At our suggestion. 
Secretary Herter. At our urging. We have been urging 
that this be done. We have been pressing it. We have not 
been able to make any headway because it was refused 
continually by the Russians who refused to go alonga 
first of all on the principles of the thing. There have 
been further discussions of the thing but we have been unable

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
198 
to agree on who should carry it out. I think we are making 
progress but it is still one,, of. those things, where 
there is a constant dispute as to what shguld be. done. 
(:) VQt only that IPA we.hoPe to ge.t it adjuated :n time 
so that this. year. there can be, a great international scientific 
Congress because youtedealing with now matters 
that the scientists are expert in that the layman is 
not, and they were unable to even allow the calling of 
that Congress. 
Senator Mansfield. Noe in other wordse as yet there 
is no clarification of this particular matter. 
Getting back to my statement concerning regulation of the 
seas, we, of course, operate under the doctrine of 
freedom of the seas. But what I have in mind is the 
fact that it is my understanding that the Soviet Union 
can launch missiles anywhere it wants to up within, 
say2 three miles of our coastline if it is in our vicinity, 
and we have the same right under international law to 
fire missiles up to three miles, say, of Valdivostoke is 
that correct? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, and it deperds again on what 
one takes as the territorial waters. Three miles have been 
the generally accepted territorial limit. The Soviet 
Government has claimed 12 miles and, as you know, the recent 
Geneva Conference failed in reaching agreement among the

nations as to what should constitute the territorial water 
of different nations. 
Some nations have gone much garthe4 than that& 
particularly with regard tckfishing rights. . 
Senator Mansgield. That's ght: Wt_whak= / TWF0 
mind is_that times have changed considerablya even in our 
generation. 
Mr. Chairman maY we have order in the committee? 
The Chairman. It is difficult to have order. 
Senator Mansfield. In view of the fact we have these 
satellites going skyward hundreds of miles and we 
have these missiles going thousands of miles into the ocean, 
9a000 miles wasthe limita it was because of these new factors 
that I offered the suggestion that it might be well to have 
international conferences to take heed of changed 
conditions in this modern day. 
We have also advocated as you are aware of peaceful 
uses of outer space and we have made no headway.

Senator Gore. Mr. Chairman, the first question I wish to 
pursue leads to a question of Mr. Bohlen, since others have 
asked him questions and I wonder if I might ask if he return. 
Mr. Secretary, Secretary Dillon testified this morning 
that he did not know of this particular flight, and to the best 
of my memory you said you were away at a time and did not 
know of this particular flight. 
Secretary Herter. I knew of theprogram, I made that 
clear in which the flight was included but not that 
particular flight. 
Senator Gore. I was specifying this particular 
flight. Did I correctly understand both of you? 
Mr. Dillon. Yes, Senator. I had heard that there 
was a series of flights about that would be undertaken about 
six weeks earlier is when / heard of it, and I had not 
heard anythingsince that time but it wasnot in my regular 
order of business. 
Senator Gore. Would you repeat what you said, I didn't 
quite catch it. 
Mr. Dillon. I said I was informed about six weeks 
before the date of this flight, I say, that there was a program 
of particular flights of which this one could have been a 
parte and I did

"As to tie timing: the question was really whether to 
halt the program and thus forego the gathering of important 
information that was essential and that was likely to 
be unavailable at a later date. The decision was that the 
program should not be halted." 
Now) as I understood your reply to the Chairman 
of the Committee, you did not participate in the making of 
a decision to halt or not to halt this particular 
flight. 
Secretary Herter, I had approved of it. 
Senator Gore. On this particular program. 
Secretary Herter. And approved of it as part of the 
program. The question of the halting of it was rot in 
issue at that time although know that the Summit 
Conference was coming. 
Senator Gore. Well my specific question is this: 
Did you participate in a conference or were you aware of 
a decision) did you make a decisive What is the full 
extent of your knowledge of a decision that the flight would 
not be discontinued.

Senator Gore. Mr. Chairman? 
The ala.irman. The Senator from Tennessee. 
Senator Gore. Dealing with the CIA is not a new experience 
for me. I happen to have handled in the House of Representatives 
the appropriation Bill for the Atomic Energy Commission, for 
five years before I was elected to the United States Senate. 
I was party to the appropriation for the Atomic Energy 
Program when the Atomic Energy bomb was being built in my State. 
No one ever heard those secrets from my lips and every year for 
the past fourteen, every year I have listened to the testimony 
of the CIA from one to two or three or more times. I dont 
think that it is necessary that we violate the security of 
this country in order to hear Mr. Allen Dulles testimony. 
The Chairman. Will the Senator yield? Mr. Dulles said 
to this Committee when he was asked if he would appear, that 
he would be very pleased to appear. He thought it would serve 
a useful purpose. He had no objection. 
Senator Gore. I will not continue this diaglog. I didn?t 
want any implication to rest that because I was pursuing some 
of the very important questions that reflect upon the effect-
iveness of our country and the prestige of our country, that 
there was something unpatriotic or partisan in the purpose. 
I thought this was the purpose of the hearing, to develop 
the facts, and so far as they could be revealed to the public, 
to do so.

Senator Gore, 
To return to the question, insofar as either of you know 
or any official of the Department, no actual decision to proceed 
with the flight or not to proceed with the flight was made. 
If such a decision was made, it was beyond your knowledge. 
Is that a correct statement? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, I think that I ought to say this. 
When the matter came before me, I had an opportunity of dis-
approving it and did not do so. Not it, but the program. 
Senator Gore. But this particular flight did not come 
before you?

Senator Gore. From whom did you receive it? 
Secretary Herter. It was handed to me from a slip of 
paper that Mr. Livingston Merchant had. He was sitting behind 
me at a NATO meeting and he handed me a slip of paper, "word 
has come that 
a plane is missing. 
I donut think he said in Russia. I didrilt know which one 
of the flights it was. 
Senator Gore. Is it your presumption that this was 
communication within the Department? 
Secretary Herter. Oh, yes. I assume it was either in the 
Department or from CIA sources with whom we are constantly in 
touch overseas. 
Senator Gore. I believe my time is up. I will return to 
this.

The Chairman, You had one question of Mr. Bohlen. He 
was called back at your request. 
Senator Gore. Yes. If I may digress a moment, I have 
been told several times, Mr. Bohlen, that in your press 
briefing at Paris, I believe on this 16th? that you expressed 
the view that except for the U-2 plane, there would have been 
a Summit Conference. 
Will you relate to us what you said at this briefing in 
this regard? 
Mr. Bohlen. I dont recall, Senator, honestly that I 
(:) made that statement --
/ 
- Senator W.:Ley. A little louder, please. 
Mr. Bohlen, I donut recall that I made that statement. 
The press briefing that I held on the 16th was an open press

conference on the record, and I d o not recall any statement 
of that kind because my view then as now is that the U-2 was 
one of the factors that may have led to the particular Soviet 
behavior at Paris. 
I really do not recall any such statement of that kind. 
Its all on the record. This was an open press conference. 
Senator Gore. You did not hold an off the record back-
ground briefing? 
Mr. Bohlen, I held a background later in which I outlined 
at that conference the three factors that I believed and still 
do entered into the formulation of the Sbviet position. 
Senator Gore. Was a transcript made of that background 
briefing? 
Mr. Bohlen, I would have to check on that, sir. I think 
there probably was. 
Senator Gore. Would you supply it to the Committee if 
there was? 
Mr. Bohlen. If there is one, I would have no views on it. 
Secretary Herter. I would have no objection. 
Mr. Bohlen. If there is a transcript of it, but I recall 
the circumstances very well in this, in that three factors that 
I mentioned earlier, the Soviet pessimism as regards the outcome 
of the Summit from their point of view; the possible opposition 
or questioning of its conduct and the U-2 matters were the 
three factors that appeared to me to have entered into Soviet

I might add: Senator, for clarification on this, we have 
used the words "scuttle the conference" quite often 
There are various ways of scuttling a conference. You 
can scuttle a conference before it begins or you can sabotage 
it from within, 
Senator Gore. Off the record. 
(Discussion off the record.) 
The Chairman. Does the Senator from Ohio have any 
further questions? 
Senator Lausche. Mr. Herter, I have in my hand the 
National Security Act of 1947, ,and I have read from page 5 that 
part of the material which deals with the duties of the Central 
Intelligence Agency. 
Are the duties enumerated in this section complete? 
Secretary Herter, Yes, I think those are enumerated 
in that section. 
Senator Lausche. This section did-it place any directions 
on how intelligence is to be obtained. 
Secretary Herter. No.

firs-take 23 Senator Lausche. Based upon the questions that have 
been asked here today, one set Implied that the President 
should not have told the truth. The next set implied that 
one of the men lied. And the third set Implied that there 
was an inability to coordinate the views. 
Now, my vestion is -- off the record. 
The Chairman. Take it off the record. 
We make a special dispensation. Whatever the 
Senator wishes: does he wish it on or off? 
Senator Lausche. Let it on. Has anyone given any 
thought about the peculiar position that the Preident 
of the United States is placed in in connection with the 
paradoxical situation that he is supposed to be a man of truth, 
and moral charactersand yet requested to Ile about these 
matters, if they are within his knowledge? 
Secretary Herter. I am not sure whether that is a 
rhetorical question or whether you are asking me that question. 
Senator Lausche. Well, take it both ways. 
(Laughter.) 
Senator Gore. Rhetorical or oratorical. 
(Laughter.) 
Senator Lausche. Well, letts assume that you were the 
President, Mr. Herter, and you were faced with the dilemma 
of telling a lie about what happened or telling the truth, 
In either event you are hooked. What course would you follow?

Secretary Herter. I can answer that one so far as 
myelf am concerned. 
The Chairman. He followed both. 
Senator Lausche. I dont know. I am beginning to wonder 
what the Central Intelligence Agency is doing ought 
not to be a matter left with them and without the knowledge 
of the President. 
hamano other questions. 
The Chairman, Mr. Secretary, I just want to make a 
comment. The Senator from Ohio has put his finger on the very 
po.tnt that galhaps I didntt make clear to him earlier in 
my Inquiry. This is in my opinion a central important 
(:) question about this whole matter. Is the wisdom of the policy 
of Involving the President in this kind of business, that 
is espionage, which traditionally involve lying and cheating 
and murdering and violating the sovereignty of countries 
wi.411 which you are not at war and all of this, and what 
the SenatiJr has said -- is perhaps, I didntt make it 
clear, but this is exactly the point that I was seeking to 
raise and to elucidate in the first line of questions that 
I asked. And I agree with him this presents a very difficult 
dilemma, and the question is the wisdom of departing from the 
traditional historical practice of not involving the head 
of the state in any espionage responsibilities, that he is 
above and apart from. We follow that in the Congress, as

219 
you have just stated. 
We treat it differently, and I was 
suwesting and raising the question of whether it is wise 
to depart from the traditional practice that all important 
states throughout history, without exception in accordance 
with the Secretary's testimony have followed, and this Is the 
very point. I dontt think the Senator understood what my 
point was. 
Senator Lausche. I knew if I were President 
Senator Wiley. You would tell the truth. 
Senator Lausche. I would tell the truth. 
Senator Wiley. So did he. 
The Chairman. He did and this is the answer. 
Senator Lausche. And could you not expect him to do 
anything else? 
Senator Wiley. That is right. 
Senator Lausche. An the only way you could enable 
him to perform his duty to his country was not by having 
him know what was done and if he didn't know the questions 
would be pursued why didntt he know. 
Senator Wiley. He taught the world a lesson in 1960, 
new diplomacy, by telling the truth, pad I think that it will 
echo down through the years.

matter.

principal echo but all of the misdeeds of the Soviet 
are looked upon as inconsequential.

In that statement. He draws conclusions that are not justified 
by the record or any statement that I have heard before the 
Committee.

here. But could somebody on the staff find it right away 
so that I could read It just as it is? 
The Chairman. Well, Mr. Secretary, while they Ere looking 
for its is it or Is it not the policy of the Department of 
State that its employees clear public statements with regard 
to delicate international relations before they make them?

222 
The Chairman. It Is the policy? 
Secretary Herter. It is. Any statement dealing with 
fbreign affairs should be cleared with the State Department. 
The Chairman. Then when they are made in this fashion 
without clearance, it is not in accord with your policy, is 
that correct? 
Secrobary Herter, Well. as I say, this had not been 
cleared with us. 
The Chairman. He is an employee --
Secretary Herter. I think it is very possible that 
a prepared statement had been cleared, but not an answer to 
a question. There is no warofelaaring that, until one knows 
what question is asked. 
The Chairman. What I asked this for is because later 
on it seems to me one of the important things that might 
come out of this Committee hearing is a tightening of the policy 
which gives the Department of State and the Secretary of 
State a much closer control over public statements by other 
agencies, and it strikes me that we would get in much less 
trouble if all these people would clear with you or with 
whoever is secretary of state or the department, we will 
say. Dont you think that would minimize the chances of 
inconsistent statements being made by members of the Government? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, that is so. But I think that 
anything that he may have said in a prepared statement on that

7 TV program at that time had been cleared. Insofar as 
answers to questions are concerned, there Isno way of clearing 
them without knowing the answer and in that way he was on his 
own. 
The Chairman. It Is his responsibility, then, when he 
goes beyond anything that had been cleared? 
Secretary Herter. Yes. 
Senator Mansfield. Mr. Chairman, on page 35 of the back-
ground document on the Summit Conferences about 7 or 8 
lines up from the bottom of the page/ Mr. Allen, in response 
to a question from Miss Dodd states the following: "There 
are a lot of different definitions of tspying t and I dont 
want to ilry to quibble, but I do think I ought to point 
this out and that more people ought to recall it: When he went 
down he told exactly what his mission was and exactly what 
he was expected to do, and he was under instruction to do 
that." 
Now, the Secretaryfs anowel, to the question, I just 
thought it ought to be in the record, beause there was some 
Jonfusion about this statement in view of information 'which 
had been given to a group previously in the Capitol. Again, 
I want to says Mr. Chairman, that I am through with my 
questions of Mr. Herter, but I want to express my thanks 
to Secretary Herter, to Secretary Dillon and to Ambassador 
Bohlen for their candor and frankness today and to assure them

8 that I, for one, appreciate what they had to say, and I think 
they have made a real contribution to clearing up a 
confused situation which confronted the Committee as a whole. 
Secretary Herter. We are very grateful for that, 
Senator. 
Senator Wiley, Of course, on this side of the aisle, 
I have vaisedyour statement in the beginning and I will 
praise your conduct in the conclusion. You all did very

to this particular flight I am perturbed that you say 
it would not be 'within the province of the Department of 
State to make the decision to discontinue these flights; 
that this would be the decision, a decision for Mr. Dulles 
to make. 
Secretary Herter. No:, I nevercaid that at all. 
Senator Gore. I beg ywr pardon? 
Secretary Herter, I never said that at alL I said he 
was the operational man who had to plan things, and then submit 
them for approval. 
Senator Gore. Well, who would make who would be the 
proper agency to consider whether these flights should or 
should not be discontinued? 
Secretary Herter, If the questron of discontinuance had 
come up, if that was a decision to be made, we would have 
been asked advice on it. We were not asked for advice on 
it. We gave approval to carry on with the routine planning 
that had been done from the point of view of flight. 
Senator Gore. Some weeks plor? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, and had given that approval, 
Senator Gore. Did that approval --

Senator Gore. Did you give no consideration to dis-
continuance at a time prior to the Summit meeting or during 
the Summit conference? 
Secretary Herter. Senator: I answered that question 
before when I said that there is no good time for a failure, 
that if the Summit conference had debarred carrying out these 
flights the Presidents visit to Russia may have been the 
next thing that might have debarred them. 
It may have been debarred when Khrushchev was at Camp 
David; it may have been debarred when Mr. Khrushchev was 
visiting in France. 
There may have been any number of diplomatic reasons_ why 
they shouldn7t be conducted at a given period of time. 
In my opinion: the value of the information and the 
necessity of carrying out these flights under given conditions 
warranted their going ahead. 
Senator Gore. I am trying to be specific in my questions, 
and I am trying to elicit from you whether at the time you gave 
your approval for the general program some weeks prior to this 
particular flight, you gave specific consideration to the 
question of continuance or discontinuance during or near the 
time of the Summit conference. 
Secretary Herter, Certainly. The Summit conference was 
very much on my mind as it was on everybodys mind, at that time.

any decision was made not to continue, to use the words, you

you not? 
The President says: 
"We had no occasion or thought that basic Soviet policy 
had turned about." 
You say from what I have just read, you list one, two, 
three, four occasions that the Soviet policy had, in fact, 
changed. 
Do you wish to comment? 
Secretary Herter. Yes, I would be very glad to comment. 
1 dont think that there is any essential disagreement 
(:) in the two points of view. 
am talking primarily in my statement in regard to 
Berlin and Germany. 
The President was talking about a series of things in 
which he spoke of disarmament, mutual inspection, atomic 
control: and then he added Germany and Berlin. 
As I testified earlier in the day, I think we all had 
hopes that there might be a possibility of making some progress, 
even though not in the German-Berlin situation, but in the 
disarmament field, and as a correlary possibly in the nuclear 
testing field where it was not a Summit problem, but it would 
have been a three power problem that could have been discussed 
in Paris.

s7 For instance, so long as there was any hope of making 
any progress, the President was willing to go. 
Senator Gore. I didn7t question the President being 
willing to go so long as there was any hope of progress. 
What I was asking you to comment on was what appears to 
me to be a contrast between the Presidents statement that there 
is no indication that basic Soviet policy had turned about, 
and you give almost a full page, indicating that they had 
turned about. But you have finished your comment on that. 
Secretary Herter. Yes, there was some talk here about 
basic policy and tactics in connection with the Summit. I 
dont think the President felt it necessarily that basic policy 
had changed. 
I think as he said after Camp David, he hoped that there was 
a mutuality of interest, particularly in the disarmament field, 
which would allow the great powers getting together in order 
to make progress in disarmament. 
That had always been the area in which he hoped, because 
of the mutuality of interest, that we might make progress. 
I dont think that there is anything fundamentally opposed 
in these two statements. 
Senator Gore. Now, I want to ask a few questions which 
relate.,;() the first of the three questions which I wish to 
examine you opinion; that is whether the diplomatic failure 
in Paris represented a failure in policy.

You recall that I submitted certain questions to you here 
on March 22nd. At that time I asked you: 
"Do you think it would have been more prudent to have 
had an understanding about the subjects to be considered at 
a Summit conference before agreeing to have one, or do you 
think this is the proper way to keep the store? 
"Secretary Herter. It is a gamble. I dongt know. 
"Senator Gore. You are gambling with high stakes, and 
it seems to me in a wreckless manner. I am disturbed to have 
the Secretary of State make the statements that you have made 
today about the Summit conference; that there is no plan, no 
purpose, no understanding as to what will be discussed and 
what we hope to attain there. 
"Secretary Herter. Mr. Senator, I v iew this as essentially 
a matter of exploration. We have the situation where an 
individual, Mr. Khrushchev? is the man who makes the decisions 
so far as we know, for the Russians." 
Later on, I asked you: 
"Is there any reason why the Russian dictator could not 
delegate the same power to his Foreign Minister as President 
Eisenhower should or does delegate to you? 
"Secretary Herter. None. 
"Senator Gore. Then isngt that a fallacious argument? 
"Secretary Herter. Not necessarily, because you are 
dealing with an individual personality who many believe wants

to be the negotiator." 
Now, I read those things because one of the principal, 
if not the principal justification for going to the Summit and for 
tie exchange of visits was that Mr. Khrushchev and he alone 
spoke for the Russian people, but today you tell us on page 7: 
"1 might digress here to observe that it had been our 
experience at previous conferences with the Soviets, at least 
since the death of Stalin, that the Soviet representative, no 
matter how highly placed he may be, was bound by the collective 
decisions and basic policiy Inatters made prior to his departure 
from Mowcow. 
"Any substantive changes in those positions apparently 
required reference back to Moscow before they could be under-
taken," and then on page 80 you say: 
"This meeting completely confirm:4 our conclusion of the 
flight before that Mr. Khrushchev was operating within the 
fixed limits of a policy set before his departure from Mowcow."

Secretary Herter. There appears ts be an inconsistency in 
those two statements. 
When I was testifying here before, the visits of Mx. 
Khrushchev in which sometimes he had an important person 
with him and sometimes hedid not --
Senator Gore. In which, what: sir? 
Secretary Herter. Sometimes in which he had an important 
personwith him and sometimes he did not: indicated that 
his situation at home was such that he had a great deal more lee-
way than had previously been the case. 
Wher he went to Pan is and I think this has been 
brought out he had with him Gromyko and Malinovsky, 
General Malinovsky: Marshal Malinovsky: who never left 
him for one moment at any time. This was a departure from 
previous occasions? This is why we said they had gone back 
to their stahdard policy of taking directions from 
home? 
Prior to that time I had be/ieved he had greater 
leeway than was clearly indicated here in Paris. 
Senator Gore? So the assumption proved to be erroneous. 
Secretary Herter. It is? 
Senator Gore. I believe you testified before the House: 
according to press reports yesterday that summitry as a 
diplomatic method had had some hard knocks. 
Secretary Herter. Yes: I did.

In answer, to a question from Senator Humphrey, I 
repeated the same thing today. 
Senator Gore. And in recommending, which I 
certainly endorse, continuing businesslike negotiation with 
the Soviets, you have in mind the more usual processes 
and procedures of diplomacy. 
Secretary Herter. That is correct. 
Senator Gore, Negotiations. 
Secretary Herter. The one thing that / did point out, 
however, is that with regard to the Berlin situation 
there that is Great Britain, France, the United States 
and Russia. This is the carry-over from the war. 
Senator Gore. Yes, 
Secretary Herter. And that there, there must be 
agreement. This is a thing we have been fighting all the 
time, that unilateral action by the Russians cannot take 
away those rights and obligations which they as well as our-
selves had acquired as a result of the war. 
That it must be done by the consent of the four. 
So that whether or not in thefuture the discussions to 
bring the four together should take place through diplomatic 
channels, through Ambassadorial level, through foreign minis-
ter or not, I would not say which would be the level, but 
I think that it is much better to see if we can not, as we did 
in the foreign ministers' conference: and failed, try to 
come together prior to the meeting of a summit

conference so that there might be one, or two_small unresolved 
issues that could be resolved there rather, than trying to 
negotiate when you know that you are very far apart at a summit 
conference. 
Senator Cora. Well: I hope thatyou will persist: and 
that the President will persist in the businesslike under-
takings. / will not ask you to say that summitry apart 
from diplomacy failed. I am content with your statement in 
that regard. I am sorry that I think it did fail. 
Secretary Herter. I would differ with you, sir, on the 
question of personal diplomacy as against summitry. I 
think that visits: are, on the whole useful things. 
I wouldn't say that that was something that should be 
discarded completely. I think it is particularly true 
that visits of ministers of foreign affairs, and 
visits of heads of state fromtime to time can accomplish a great 
deal of good,, But I believe very strongly that insofar as 
heads of state are concerned that is not the place to 
begin negotiations. It is the place perhaps where there 
should be the culmination of negotiations. 
Senator Core. I will agree with you in that statement. 
The exchange of visits offers opportunities. But for the 
fbrmalization of-a head of state conference, where severe 
international tensions are involved, without precise planning, 
without assurance that at least limited agreements can 
be reached, is: in my view, a dangerous process, and a

policy upon which we should never have embarked. 
Of aurse/ it is easier t say that now than it was 
before. 
Hindsight of coursee we learned a longtime ago o is 
better than foresight. 
The Chairman. Would the Senator yield for a moment? 
I have one or two questions and then he may come back to 
it. 
Senator Gore, Good, 
The Chairman. These I think have been covered but for 
clarificationo I might ask them again. Was there ever a 
time when the President authorized each flight in this 
program e that3s never been the practice. 
Eecretary Herter It has never come up to the President. 
The Chairman. Nor of the National Security Council. 
Secretary Vertex, No. 
The Chairman. It has always been under a blanket 
authority understood? 
Secretary Herter. That is my impression. 
The Chairman. Ir this blanket authorization under 
review; either -onstant review or periodic review? 
becretary Herter. In my experience the CIA has planned 
a number of alternate flights at a time.

The CLairman. When the Department brought 
Mr. Bohlen back from Manila, and he was well known as an 
expert on Soviet behaviors and this mass I thought s in 
anticipation of these summit meetings which had been dis-
cussed a long times did he or any other of our Russian 
experts advise you or the President to wait and see what 
Mr. Khrushehey knew about the n-2 flight before making the 
NASA statement 
Mr. Dillon. The people in the Departmet:who were 
familiar with Soviet policy took part in discussions with 
the CIA which led to the coordination and the agreement 
on the guide lines which mere given to rAsk and those 
included the people who were familiar with all aspects 
of our policy. 
However, as we said before; we did not know that there 
was going to be a full statement by NASA. 
The Chairman. Mx. Bohlen was not consulted about 
the MASA statement. 
Mx. Dillon. Nobody in the State Department was consulted 
about the statement as a statement. 
The Chairman. Nobody. 
What puzzles me about this is why.was there such 
compulsion, if there was, to make such an immediate reaction? 
I have wondered why there was any necessity for immediately

reacting to the first Khrushchev statempnt. 
It would seem to me much more normal to wait a while and 
see what developed. 
Was there anything that was compelling you to answer 
almost immediately? 
Mr. Dillon. Yes: I would say so. /t was such an unusual 
andremarkable statement when Mr. Khrushchev 
said that American plane had been shot down over the Soviet 
Union, that we were not in the position to not make any 
comment whatsoever. 
As a result we had to make some comment, and we 
made the very bland statement which was put out onthe 
5th. 
The Chairman. I didn't mean that. You misunderstood 
me. I accept the necessity for the cover story, the 
statement. 
M. Dillon. Yes. 
The Chairman. It is the second one that went into 
such detail. It would seem to me that order, it would be 
common sense not to follow up too quickly in the 
matter of typing. What was the reason for that? 
Mr. Dillon. The State Department's second statement was 
innocuous too. It didn't go into any detail, any more 
detail than the original cover story did. There was great 
-- if any detail, that was the statement that was put out 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3

by NASA. 
The chairman. Is it not true that the NASA statement 
itself is what put you in a position of having to make a 
further statement? 
Is that true? 
N. Dillon. The further stateMentz I think ,was the 
next statement in this Series, was the one that was Put out 
on, Saturday which was made only at the time when we knew 
that the Soviets probably had he pilots which was new 
information: and then the Soviet o had already said they had 
him, and had said where he was shot down; and we knew they 
had certain the probability was that they had certain 
parts of the airplane because the picture which they had 
first put out turned vat to be a fraudulent picture. 
The Chairman.' porhaps donut understand the timing 
of it. 
It seems to me: if I do understand it that 
you could have stood upon the cover story for some time 
before the necessity of any further statement? await 
developments. 
Mr. Dillon. You mean, your question is why we made 
the statement on Saturday May 70 which was the first time 
we departed from the cover story. 
The Chairman. Yes, sir. 
Secretary Herter. That: as I think I have testified 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
244 
before c was a decision that was made in the light of 
the very full revelation of Mr., Khrushchev in giving out, 
both as to the pilots testimony as to the parts 
and equipment that had been recovered,. That was when 
we had to make the decision were we going to 
.1=t, 
keep on lying about this or were we going to tell the truth? 
The Chairman. Why wasrOt there a third alternative is 
Oat I am trying to get at? 
Why didn?t you just be quiet and say nothing? You 
don't have just the alternatives of either continuing to 
lie or tell the truth? 
You could have said nothing. I was just curious, was 
this ever considered that you didn?t have to react? 
Secretary Herter. A good many statements were already 
being made in Congress, a good many statements were already 
being made or required of us almost. 
The press was hounding everubody, "What do you say 
now after what Mx. Khrushchev had said" c it was a very diffi-
cult time in our society, our form of society to have said 
nothing. 
The Chairman. I believe that was the statement in which 
you said "It has been established that insofar as the 
authorities were concerned in Washington there was no 
authorization for such flights", is that correct? 
Secretary Herter. That is right.

that point; was there? 
Secretary Herter Jo, this was still partly cover. 
The Chairman. Still partly cover? 
Secretary Herter. Still partly cover. It was not 
until Monday, after the briefing had taken place before 
the Congressional leadership here on the hill that the full 
statement was made. 
The Chairman. It was after that statement that the full 
statement was made. 
Secretary Herter. That is correct. 
The Chairman. Was that full statement if I understood 
it, I think you have testified, was only after complete 
and thorough consultation with everyone concerned, 
and had the unanimous support of state and the President, 
is that correct? 
Secretary Herter. It is, yes. 
The Chairman. Senator Gore, go ahead. 
Senator Gore. Well, when you made the final statement 
that the President did approve, he was responsible, I am 
not undertaking to quote you exactly, you also made it 
plain that he did not approve specific flights?

Ake 26 
Now, I wish to make my own feelings explicit. I have 
not intended to suggest, nor do I believe the Chairman or 
anyone else has intended to suggest, that the President or 
any other official of the United States Government tell a 
falsehood. I dont know of any requirement in Anglosaxon 
Jurisprudence or any other jurisprudence stemming from Roman 
law that a citizen is required to incriminate himself. I know 
of no requirement that a. nation is required to incriminate 
or denigrate or defame Itself. I do not claim any sense 
of morals or sensitivity to moral standards greater than 
the average Americaa,but I want the record to show that 
I was humiliated with official falsification, and I think 
millions of Americans were humiliated. I can agree with you 
that our alli4nce stood firm. I am happy that it did, but 
I think we would be deluding ourselves if we did notrealize 
that this unfortunx4e incident has dealt a severe blow to 
the moral position of the United States. I think we should 
begin to mend it. The way to mend it is to ferret out our 
errors and our mistakes, correct them, and thereby demonstrate 
to the world our w113. and our capacity to survive this kind 
of blow, and I hope be stronger thereafter. 
The Chairman. Mr. Secretary, there was one point 
that I overlooked. I had heard that Chairman Khrushchev 
had directly or indirectly made some inquiry about the 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3 
248 
2 possibility of meeting Mr. Eisenhower before the Summit 
meeting. Do you know whether or not that is so? ? 
Secretary Herter. No. I know of no such effort. 
The Chairman. No,effort? 
Secretary Herter. Actually Mr. Khrushchev, when he came 
to Paris, or just before. he came to Paris, sent a note 
to the British and to the French, I think, largely on 
a procedural matter, no such note to us. When the President 
arrived in Paris, there was just as much opportunity for 
Mr. Khrushchev to seek a meeting with him as with Macmillan 
or de Gaulle, and no such effort was made from any Russian 
source. 
The Chairman. Mr. Secretary, have you drawn any 
Inferences from tille9 whole event relative to the Military 
preparedness of the Soviet Union? 
.Secretary Herter. Of course my jul,lment would not be 
as good as that of experts. And here, again/ I wouldn't want 
to give my judgment as a considered judgment from the point 
of view of the recoA. There Is no question but what the 
Russians are V.ery active in certain directions, and that 
the intelligence that has been gained with regard to that 
activity has been of very great value to us. And I think 
that is as far as I should go. 
The Chairman. Any further questions? 
Senator Wiley. Is the cold war still on or is it over? 
Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/09/26: CIA-RDP91-00965R000601290003-3

3 Secretary Herter. It remains to be seen. 
Senator Wiley. Then we had better give primary attention 
to the main issue, instead of qUarreling about who is who 
and what Is what in relation tihandling situations. It was 
your judgment, It isn't my judgment. It int the business 
of every little one in the Senate to tell you what you should 
do. It is your business, sir.

questions?

time. I think obviously we should be giving serious 
consideration to the very best method of the handling of 
anything of this kind that might happen in the future, and 
I think from that point of view, as the President said, we 
welcome this inquiry. We welcome a full disclosure as far 
as we could, from the point of view of responsIbilities 
and coordination. I thank you for your patience here 
today. 
The Chairman. I want to thank you for your patience 
and your frankness and candor. I think you and your associates, 
Secretary Dillon and Mr. BohlenOlave been most cooperative 
In this whole hearing. I like to think that out of this 
one, as you know, rather pet project of mine is that the 
State Department itself be given greater prestige and 
authority in controlling and coordinating all matters relating 
to our foreign relations. 
As I have tried in the case, for example, one recent 
example was the control of the black market in Turkey. I think 
your Department, the Department of State, ought to have more 
authority than we have in the past accorded it. I am sure 
that some of our troubles do not relate to any fault on dour 
part, but to the sort of Institutional practices that have 
grown up and people assuming authority to make statements 
without you or without consulting you and the Department. 
I feel at this stage of the proceedings that this may be one

of the good things that will come out of these hearings, 
that the prestige and authority of the State Department 
will be ,enhanced.

The Chairman. Thank you very much. 
Senator Gore. Could I join you in commending the 
Secretary and his assistants for their candor and their 
patience and their diligence here today. 
Secretary Herter. Thank you. 
Senator Wiley. May I also join you the third time 
by saying 41 my humble opinion the evidence and the statement 
yulariade and the statement that Dillon made and the Presidents 
wech shows conclusively that the break-up of the Summit 
Conference was due to Khrushchev and no other cause. 
The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
