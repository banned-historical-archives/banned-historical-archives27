 Peoples Republic of China:
 Caracas and After
 Examination of China's performance at Caracas and after
 reveals that the assessment of Peking's overall views on LOS and
 its positions on individual LOS issues set forth in the PRC LOS
 Country Study (BGI 74-14) remains valid.  Peking continues to see
 the whole affair as a contest between the developed countries,
 primarily the USSR and the United States, and the developing
 countries.  The former are trying to maintain the status quo,
 while the developing countries seek to remove all man's activities
 in the marine environment from what they see as a laissez-faire
 regime and to place them under a regime of precise rules con-
 trolled by individual states, regional groups of states, and an
 international authority.
 A new oceans treaty will add relatively little area and few
 resources to China's jurisdiction.  The country already has a
 wealth of mineral and petroleum reserves on land, and new petroleu7
 reserves are being proven in its continental shelf, well within
 China's domain under existing international law.  China's coastal
 fisheries are amply stocked for the country's needs. The only
 foreign fishing fleets in what can reasonably be called Chinese
 waters are there with Peking's consent through bilateral agree-
 ments.

 Cartographic Research to support the NSC Interagency Task Force
 on the Law of the Sea. The supplement updates, but is not a_re-
 placement for, BGI LOS 74-14. Comments and questions may be

 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 China will find a 200-mile coastal state resource zone of
 limited value.  The country's eastern seas are too narrow and the
 geography of the South China Sea is too complex for simple applica-
 tion of a 200-mile rule.  To delimit its outer sea boundaries,
 China will have to reach agreement with its neighbors -- a practice
 already recommended by conventional international law.  China has
 no bordering straits that will be affected by broadened territorial
 seas, and, although the Chinese Navy may in the future begin
 showing the flag internationally, it will not require greater
 freedom of navigation than the United States and the USSR are able
 to extract at the conference.
 For China, then, the LOS conference is merely an opportunity
 to curb the power and influence of the developed countries and to
 gain for itself some measure of influence and leadership in the
 Third World.  The Chinese made their big move at Geneva in 1973
 and at Caracas appeared content to bide their time and said little
 that was new.  Peking can afford to play the waiting game and may
 try to persuade the developing countries to do the same until
 their demands are met.  To avoid being isolated, however, Peking
 will join any move by a majority of developing countries to reach
 accommodations that will produce a treaty.

 THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC)
 Part I - Law of the Sea Analysis
 A. SUMMARY
 China does not have a strong need for a Law of
 the Sea (LOS) conference. Nature has favored China
 with a natural resource security that few nations
 can match. International law provides adequate
 protection for China's current merchant, fishing,
 and naval pursuits; protection from such possibly
 harmful activities as pollution and foreign
 encroachment of fishing grounds; and an equitable
 share of the adjacent seabed.
 China's participation in the LOS negotiations, its most active
 involvement in UN affairs since attaining membership in 1971, has been
 prompted primarily by Pekin 's desire to achieve leadership of the
 lesser developed countries (LDC's) in an effort to wrest an "equitable"
 share of the world's wealth from what it sees as a near developed-
 country (DC) monopoly. The Chinese will to to Caracas with the idea
 that the issues are too many and too complex to be resolved at one
 conference. For this reason they have not researched their own country's
 LOS interests thoroughly, but have, instead, drawn largely from the
 positions expressed by the LDC's in formulating their present LOS policy.
 In the main, China seeks to insure that all activities in the sea,
 with the exception of navigation and overflight in the area beyond the
 territorial sea,* are strictly controlled. To this end, China will
 support measures that are compatible with: 1) complete coastal state
 sovereignty and the regime of innocent passage in the territorial sea,
 including, at least initially, international straits that lie within
 the territorial sea; 2) coastal state ownership and management of the
 coastal state economic zone, with perhaps some sharing of management
 and benefits with adjacent landlocked and shelf-locked states; and
 3) maximum international control of the areas beyond coastal state
 jurisdiction through an international regime, in which all nations
 have an equal voice and through which revenues derived from the
 exploitation of the seabed will be shared equally by all nations.
 *Peking supports freedom of navigation and overflight in the areas
 beyond the territorial sea.

 B. FACTORS INFLUENCING LOS POLICY
 Special Geographic Features
 China's entire 8,250-mile* coastline lies on three semienclosed seas.
 Two of the seas, the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, measure less
 than 400 miles between China and the states opposite. The breadth of
 the South China Sea between China and the island of Borneo approaches
 1,200 miles. All of the Yellow Sea is less than 200-meters deep;
 whereas, the distance between the China coast and the 200-meter isobath
 in the East and South China Seas varies from 70 to over 300 miles.
 Peking makes no specific claims in the Yellow and East China Seas
 beyond its 12-mile territorial sea except for the Senkaku Islands,
 which are also claimed by Taipei and Tokyo. Since 1970 when Peking made
 sweeping claims regarding its adjacent shelf to counter the claims of
 Japan and South Korea, the government has moderated its stand, at least
 on the Yellow and East China Seas, by stating that the jurisdiction of
 the sea between "China and her neighbors has not yet been delimited" --
 an admission, perhaps, of the existence of the legitimate claims of the
 other countries. Peking does, however, claim numerous islands in the
 South China Sea, which has placed China in dispute with other states
 that border that sea over ownership of the Paracel Islands, Pratas
 Island, and the Spratly Islands. The PRC, along with the ROC, also
 claims the Macclesfield Bank, a submerged atoll 75 miles east of the
 Paracels.  Lying as little as nine meters below the surface, the bank
 covers some 225 square miles. A major shipping lane lies between
 Macclesfield and the Paracels, and the Soviets use the bank as an
 anchorage. Long dormant, these disputes are coming to the fore as the
 petroleum-bearing potential of the underlying seabed is increasingly
 discussed.
 Uses of the Sea
 Mineral Resources -- There is evidence that the continental shelf
 adjacent to China is geologically suited for the formation and accumu-
 lation of petroleum. The Chinese have, in fact, brought in several wells
 in the shallow (less than 40 meters depth), near-shore areas of Po Hai;
 and farther south on the same continental shelf, Gulf Oil has a producing
 exploratory well 100 miles west of the Senkakus in a Republic of China
 (ROC) concession, and the North Vietnamese reportedly have hit oil just
 off Haiphong in the Gulf of Tonkin. Although the PRC's petroleum require-
 ments are met from its land reserves, Peking may plan to pursue its
 offshore prospects for use as foreign exchange. China has limited
 indigenous offshore capability, and has ordered offshore drill rigs
 from Japan and Romania. There are reports of Chinese inqueries into the
 purchase of American and Western European offshore exploration and
 drilling equipment.
 *Distances and areas throughout this paper are in nautical miles unless
 specified otherwise.

 SECRET
 Living Resources -- China's coastal fisheries (China claims a 12-
 mile exclusive fishing zone) provide at least 90% of the country's
 total marine fish catch. The country's small deep-sea fishing fleet,
 limited in capability due to a paucity of modern equipment, regularly
 travels no farther from the mainland than to the Paracel Islands, 150
 miles southeast of Hainan Island in the South China Sea; and there is
 little need for it to do so. The seas adjacent to the East Asian main-
 land contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the world.
 A vast expanse of shallow shelf water, the occurrance of both warm and
 cold currents, and an abundant supply of nutrients washed from the
 mainland combine to bring huge stocks of a wide variety of fish species
 within easy reach of China's coastal fishing fleets. The bulk of China's
 marine catch is consumed in the Chinese coastal area; the remainder
 provides a steady but unspectacular foreign exchange item.
 Peking has entered into fishing agreements with Moscow, P'yongyang,
 Tokyo, and Hanoi. The China-Japan agreement deals only with fishing
 grounds on the Chinese side of a hypothetical median line in the Yellow
 and East China Seas, emphasizing the Chinese predilection for coastal
 fisheries, beyond which fishermen rarely venture.
 Marine Transportation -- The bulk of China's foreign seaborne trade
 is carried by foreign vessels; many of Peking's ships fly U.K., Somali,
 Liberian, and Panamanian flags. The ships are controlled by Peking,
 though Polish, Albanian, and Tanzanian capital is involved. China is
 purchasing ships through Hong-Kong-based companies to increase its own
 international flag-ship fleet.
 The threat posed by ROC naval forces in the Formosa Strait has caused
 the PRC to split its merchant fleet largely into northern and southern
 components. The northern component operates on routes to North Korea,
 Japan, and Canada; the southern component, to North Vietnam, Southern
 Asia, Africa, and Europe. Occasionally, PRC flag ships operate on
 routes between Europe and Shanghai, traveling east of Taiwan and through
 the Ryukyu Islands; the latter contain several passages that are wider
 than 24 miles. China's leading partners in foreign seaborne trade are
 Japan, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Malaysia, West Germany, Belgium,
 and Italy.
 Naval and Air Transportation Considerations -- The PRC has the
 largest and fastest growing naval force in non-Soviet East Asia. The
 size of its submarine force is third only to those of the U.S.S.R. and
 the United States, and its air arm has over 700 aircraft. Despite its
 size, the PRC Navy is still primarily a coastal defense force. The
 Chinese are, however, developing a submarine launched ballistic
 missile system, an indication that they have plans for more extensive
 naval operations. It is estimated that the Chinese will be "showing
 the flag" internationally by the 1980's.

 China operates only one over-water civil air route--between Peking
 and P'yongyang--but is planning service to Tokyo later this year.
 For China, the LOS negotiations are another episode in the con-
 tinuing struggle between the "victims of imperialist and colonialist
 oppression" and the developed countries (DC's), particularly the
 "superpowers"--a struggle between the "plundered" and the "plunderers."
 Peking fancys itself the leader of the LDC's, and, by acclaiming and
 championing their LOS views, hopes to gain recognition as such in its
 effort to minimize what it sees as almost total DC-control of the seas.
 Peking looks on the LOS Conference as an opportunity for the LDC's to
 get theirs, hopefully at the expense of the DC's.
 In its early involvement in LOS affairs, China gave unreserved
 support to LDC stands, particularly the right of a state to make
 unilateral, unlimited claims to the adjacent sea, to set standards,
 and to exercise enforcement. Later, however, Peking began to modify its
 stand. Although still an ardent supporter of maximum coastal state
 control of the coastal zone, Peking has spoken of limits on coastal
 state control, negotiation, reaching concensus, and regional rather
 than individual standards. This shift may represent a maturation of
 the Chinese view of the world, perhaps a result of its participation
 in the U.N. It may also reflect Peking's realization of the limits on
 its own options imposed by its semienclosed sea situation. While terri-
 torial disputes in the South China Sea may delay implementation of any
 international LOS standards there, the very breadth of the seas north
 of Taiwan will preclude establishment of 200-mile or greater coastal
 economic zones. Peking now must be aware that accommodation with its
 immediate neighbors is necessary for the peaceful and orderly use of
 its bordering seas, and has, perhaps, begun to project this idea to
 the international scene with the realization that certain international
 standards also are necessary.
 China will probably support the 12-mile territorial sea. Despite
 Peking's repeated official statements that the individual state has the
 right to delimit its own territorial sea and voiced opposition to having
 a 3- or 12-mile limit imposed on the world by the "superpowers," the
 Chinese will, to avoid alienation of the LDC's and in the interest of
 world order, agree to an international limit of 12 miles for the terri-
 torial seas. Peking may make its support for 12 miles contingent upon
 the adoption of a 200-mile exclusive coastal economic zone. Peking has
 indicated that the innocent-passage regime, as now defined, would pre-
 vail in the territorial sea.

 Although Peking claims a 12-mile national territorial sea, it has
 yet to commit itself publicly to a specific figure for the maximum
 breadth of the international territorial sea. Its early LOS statements
 used "territorial sea" and "exclusive economic or resource zone"
 interchangeably and defended the right of the individual state to
 "reasonably" delimit its own in accordance with the state's geographic
 and economic circumstances and with due consideration to the claims of
 adjacent and opposite states. However, in March 1973 in private
 conversation with U.S. officials, PRC Seabed Committee delegate Shen
 Wei-liang said that the territorial sea would be much narrower than
 the economic zone. Later, although still defending the right of the
 state to delimit its own sea boundaries, Shen said that an inter-
 national maximum breadth for the territorial sea should be "settled
 by all states through consultations."
 Straits
 The PRC has thus far opposed an unimpeded transit regime in straits
 that are overlapped by the territorial sea. Peking considers such
 straits integral parts of the strait state's sovereign territory and,
 therefore, under the more restrictive innocent passage regime. Peking's
 1973 draft articles (see Annex) stipulate that foreign nonmilitary
 ships would enjoy innocent passage in such straits and that aircraft
 would have to comply with the laws of the strait state. The articles
 further specify that the strait state "may" require foreign military
 ships either to tender prior notification or seek prior approval from
 the strait state--leaving approval or disapproval of military transit
 completely to the discrimination of the strait state. PRC officials
 have expressed particular fear of submarines operating submerged off
 their coast. At the August 1972 Seabed Committee meetings, however, PRC
 delegate Hsia P'u privately indicated to U.S. and U.S.S.R. delegates
 that unimpeded passage was negotiable. This, together with what is known
 of China's developing naval capabilities and plans, hint that it may not,
 in fact, be as wed to the innocent passage rule as it professes. A strict
 innocent passage regime in straits that are overlapped by extended
 territorial seas would restrict Chinese naval operations, as well as
 those of the United States and the U.S.S.R. But the Chinese will probably
 not actively push for a regime that is less restrictive than innocent
 passage, being content to conduct naval operations under whatever
 provisions the United States and the U.S.S.R. are able to negotiate.
 A 12-mile territorial sea would change the status of only one Chinese
 strait, the relatively unimportant 10-mile-wide Hainan Strait. The
 Chinese, however, already view the strait as internal waters, having
 included Hainan in the mainland's straight baseline system in their
 1958 territorial sea declaration. This same declaration implys that
 Peking considered the Formosa Strait to be high seas.

 Islands
 The PRC's 1973 draft articles state that the "breadth and limits of
 the territorial sea as defined by a coastal state are, in principle,
 applicable to the islands belonging to that state." In practice, the
 PRC has used islands fringing its mainland as basepoints in the main-
 land's straight baseline system. Islands that are some distance off
 shore have separate territorial seas.
 Archipelagos
 China's 1973 draft articles define an archipelago as a group of
 islands "rather close to each other" and allow that the outermost
 islands may be used as bas epoi nts for a straight baseline system.
 Presumably, the waters enclosed by the baselines would be classified
 as internal. China can be expected to support the stand of the archi-
 pelago states, whatever it may be at conference time, primarily
 because these states are LDC's.
 China claims three groups of islands that could be technically
 termed archipelagos--the Senkakus, the Paracels, and the Spratlys.
 The Paracels and the Spratlys if enclosed with straight baselines
 would encompass 6,000 and 100,000 square miles, respectively; the
 Senkakus are spread over a much smaller area. None of the three groups
 can support sizable permanent habitation, and none contains sea routes.
 The Paracels and the Spratlys, in fact, contain many hazards to navi-
 gation and are systematically avoided. The primary importance of the
 three groups is economic--each lies on a potentially petroleum-rich
 seabed.
 Delimitation and Demarcation
 The guides for drawing baselines contained in Peking's 1973 draft
 articles closely follow those set forth in the convention on the
 Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone--low-water lines, low-tide
 elevations, deeply indented coasts, fringing islands, etc. In drawing
 its own baselines, China used a reasonable mix of low-water lines
 along its smooth, regular coasts, and the outermost points on the
 headlands and fringing islands for its deeply indented and irregular
 coasts. Article 8 of China's draft articles stipulates that the base-
 line used to close a bay should not exceed twice the breadth of the
 territorial sea. When China's 12-mile territorial sea is used as the
 standard, the length of the Article 8 closing line is identical to
 that stipulated in Article 7 of the Territorial Sea Convention--24
 miles.

 Semienclosed Seas
 Although China has not addressed semienclosed seas as such, it has
 stated a preference for regional rather than international standards.
 Paragraph 10 of the continental shelf section of its 16 July 1973
 working paper on the sea area within the limits of national juris-
 diction (see Annex) urges regional agreements and cooperation among
 states that share the same continental shelf.
 In regard to its own semienclosed sea situation, Peking has expressed
 the need for reaching accord with its neighbors. The Yellow and East
 China Seas are suited to a special semienclosed sea regime settlement
 considering their narrow dimensions, which preclude other than mutually
 agreeable or median line boundaries, and the fact that the bordering
 states are culturally related and have growing economic ties.
 Continental Shelf
 In its 16 July 1973 working paper on the sea area within the coastal
 state jurisdiction, Peking supports the right of the coastal state to
 delimit and claim a reasonable portion of the adjacent continental
 shelf. The paper further states that the maximum limit should be
 determined by consultation among states--one of the first hints of
 PRC consideration of an international limit, although regional limits
 are certainly not excluded. China has not committed itself to a specific
 maximum limit, but it does oppose the Soviet 500-meter proposal. State
 Department Telegram Hong Kong 7506, 25 July 1973, indicated that the
 Chinese might favor the 200-meter limit.
 Peking has said that the resources of the shelf appertain to the
 coastal state. However, Peking places the shelf's superjacent waters
 into two categories--those within the coastal state economic zone
 (Peking favors a 200-mile economic zone) and those beyond. The waters
 within the zone and their resources would belong to the coastal state;
 the waters beyond, even though less than 200-meters deep, and their
 resources would be placed under the jurisdiction of an international
 regime.
 Peking says that the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf,
 as well as the other three Geneva conventions,* is out of date, that the
 convention does not truly reflect the "reasonable demands of the numerous
 developing countries," having been drafted before many of these countries
 were independent. Peking has, however, cited the convention's 200-meter
 limit to support its claim to the Senkakus, and the Chinese 1973 draft
 proposal and working papers are similar to the convention's in style,
 language, and substance.

 on the High Seas,.Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living

 Coastal State Jurisdiction Beyond the Territorial Sea
 Peking supports the right of the coastal state to reasonably define
 its own exclusive economic zone out to a distance of 200 miles from the
 territorial sea baselines. In Peking's proposal, the coastal state
 would own all resources and control all activities other than navi-
 gation and overflight within the zone. China also proposes that the
 coastal state share with adjacent landlocked and shelf-locked states
 a "certain proportion of the rights of ownership and jurisdiction" in
 the zone.
 China will support no measures that tend to erode complete coastal
 state control of fisheries within the coastal state exclusive economic
 zone. China has repeatedly castigated distant-water fishing states for
 "plundering" the resources of other states. The Chinese do, however,
 approve of bilateral fishing agreements and have themselves entered
 into several. Only the agreement with North Vietnam is known to contain
 provisions that allow the PRC to fish in the coastal waters of another
 state (the PRC has access to two areas in the Gulf of Tonkin).
 China's coastal fisheries appear to fill the country's needs,
 and the Chinese show no desire to develop a distant-water fishing
 capability. Thus, they have opposed distant-water fishering interests
 in the LOS negotiations. In their working paper of 2 August 1973 (see
 Annex), the PRC stated that fishing in the international area beyond
 the coastal state economic zone should be regulated by an inter-
 national fishing organization and, pending the establishment of such
 an organization, that states bordering a given sea area may set up a
 regional committee to regulate fishing and conserve the resources in
 the given international area.
 High Seas
 The Chinese have not used the term "high seas," per se, but their
 2 August 1973 working paper on the international sea area applies all
 of the freedoms except fishing cited in the Convention on the High Seas--
 freedom of navigation and overflight and freedom to lay submarine cables
 and pipelines--to the seas beyond the areas of coastal state juris-
 diction. Fishing in the international area, as explained under Fisheries,
 would be regulated by an international organization.
 Deep Seabed
 The Chinese want the seabed beyond coastal state jurisdiction to be
 governed by a strong international regime. In their view, the inter-
 national regime should be empowered to manage and engage in the

 SECRET
 exploration and exploitation of the international seabed, register
 claims, issue licenses, and collect fees from other operating agencies
 (state, private enterprises). The Chinese also propose that the inter-
 national regime control scientific research in and set pollution
 standards for the international sea area. To combat its fear of
 superpower monopoly, Peking wants all nations and all regions equally
 represented on the regime's council on a rotational basis. Peking
 opposes the weighted formulas of the United States (industrial nations)
 and the U.S.S.R. (Eastern European nations) and has specifically stated
 that the superpowers must not be allowed to dominate the council or
 have a privileged position on it.
 According to its 27 March 1973 press release, China wants revenues
 derived from exploitation of the deep seabed "shared fairly and
 equitably by all states on an equal footing irrespective of their
 size, taking into particular consideration the needs of the developing
 countries"--a nebulous and idealistic desire, which implies all states
 are equal, but that the LDC's are more equal than the DC's. The PRC
 wants all commercial exploitation halted until an LOS treaty that
 contains authority for an international regime is ratified. The Chinese
 oppose the U.S. proposal for a provisional application of the LOS
 Convention during the interim between its signing and ratification.
 .China has proposed that landlocked states be afforded free access
 to the international sea area through the land territories, territorial
 seas, and coastal economic zones of bordering coastal states and, further,
 that coastal states afford bordering landlocked states a share in the
 resources and jurisdiction of the coastal state economic zone.
 Marine Pollution
 China's statements indicate support for international pollution
 control standards, but also support the right of coastal states to
 impose and enforce additional regional and individual standards in areas
 under coastal state jurisdiction. China did not attend the IMCO Marine
 Pollution Conference in London in 1973, but, as an IMCO member, it may
 sign the protocol.
 At the regular IMCO meeting in 1973 the Chinese criticized the
 composition of IMCO's Council of Maritime Safety on the grounds that
 it did not reflect IMCO's membership--largely LDC's.

 Scientific Research
 China's 19 July 1973 working paper on marine scientific research
 (see Annex) calls for: 1) the acquisition of prior consent of the
 coastal state before carrying out scientific research in the zone
 under its jurisdiction, 2) the participation of the coastal state in
 the research activity, and 3) the consent of the coastal state before
 the results of the research activity are published. The paper also
 requires that scientific research in the international sea area be
 governed by the international regime.
 Regional Arrangements
 The PRC has proposed regional arrangements and standards as solutions
 to several LOS issues, i.e., pollution control, resource management and
 exploitation, and jurisdiction delimitation.
 Settlement of Disputes
 At the spring 1973 Seabed Committee meetings both Shen Wei-liang and
 Hsia P'u made statements relative to dispute settlement. Shen, in private
 conversation indicated that disputes should be settled directly between
 the countries involved. He refused to comment on the use of a third
 party. Hsia, while presenting the PRC's views on the powers of the
 international regime during general debate on the international deep
 seabed issue, stated that the regime should not have "sovereignty or
 jurisdictional powers comparable to those of a State"--a possible
 implication that Peking does not want the regime empowered to settle
 disputes.
 Peaceful Uses of the Sea
 The Chinese include the "Peaceful Uses of the Sea" theme often in
 their LOS pronouncements and discussions. Two demands appear repeatedly--
 the prohibition of nuclear submarines and the requirement that all marine
 scientific research be for peaceful. purposes. The Chinese also oppose the
 implantation of nuclear weapons on the seabed. Peking signed the Indian
 Ocean as a Zone of Peace Resolution.

 D. KEY POLICY MAKERS, LOS NEGOTIATORS AND ADVISERS
 Interest in LOS matters has been exhibited at the highest levels in
 Peking. Chou En-lai at state meetings has voiced support for the right
 of individual countries to make unilateral claims, and Chinese diplomats
 around the world have done likewise.
 Chinese delegates have taken an active part in all Seabed Committee
 meetings since China's entry into the United Nations in November 1971.
 Peking's delegation to Caracas will have full authority to negotiate
 China's demands and will undoubtedly be equipped with fall-back
 positions on the issues. The delegation would have to query Peking
 before making major changes and in any unsuspected developments. Shen
 Wei-liana and Hsia Pu have been the most quoted of the Chinese delegates.

 is a specified area of sea adjacent to its coast or internal waters, including the
 airspace over the territorial sea, and its bed and subsoil thereof, over which it
 exercises sovereignty.
 (2)  A coastal State is entitled to reasonably define the breadth and limits of its
 territorial sea according to its geographical features and its needs of economic
 development and national
 security and having due regard to the legitimate interests of
 and the convenience of international navigation, and shall
 its neighbouring countries
 give publicity thereto.
 (3)  Coastal States in the
 same region may, through consultations on an equal
 footing, define a unified breadth or a limit for the territorial sea in the region.
 (4)  Coastal States adjacent or opposite to each other shall define the boundaries
 between their territorial seas on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
 territorial integrity, equality and reciprocity.
 (5)  The breadth and limits of the territorial sea as defined by a,
 are, in principle, applicable to the islands belonging to that State.
 (6)  An archipelago or an island chain consisting of islands close to each other
 may be taken as an integral whole in defining the limits of the territorial sea around

 THE BASELINE
 A COASTAL STATE MAY ADOPT ITS OWN METHOD OF DRAWING THE BASELINE ACCORD-
 ING TO THE TOPOGRAPHICAL FEATURES OF ITS COAST.
 1.  IN LOCALITIES WHERE THE COASTLINE IS REGULAR OR THE COAST IS LOW AND
 FLAT, THE METHOD OF NATURAL BASELINES, I.E., TAKING THE LOW-TIDE LINES AS
 THE BASELINES, MAY BE EMPLOYED FOR MEASURING THE BREADTH OF THE TERRITORIAL
 SEA.
 2.  IN LOCALITIES WHERE THE COASTLINE IS INDENTED THE METHOD OF A SERIES
 OF STRAIGHT BASELINES, :.E., TAKING THE LINES CONNECTING APPROPRIATE
 PROTRUDING POINTS ON THE COAST AS THE BASELINES, MAY BE EMPLOYED FOR
 MEASURING THE BREADTH OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA.  THE DIRECTION OF SUCH A

 EMPLOY THE METHOD OF MIXED BASELINES, I.E. DRAWING BASELINES IN TURN BY
 THE METHODS PROVIDED FOR IN PARAGRAPHS 1 AND 2 TO SUIT DIFFERENT CONDITIONS.
 1.  IF THERE ARE ISLANDS ALONG THE COAST, STRAIGHT LINES CONNECTING THE
 BASEPOINTS OF THE OUTERMOST ISLANDS MAY SERVE AS BASELINES.
 2.  IF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BASEPOINTS AT THE ENTRANCE OF A BAY
 DOES NOT EXCEED TWICE THE BREADTH OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA, THE STRAIGHT
 LINE LINKING THE TWO POINTS MAY SERVE AS THE BASELINE.
 3.  IF A RIVER MOUTH JOINS THE SEA DIRECTLY AND THERE IS NO ISLAND OFF
 IT, THE STRAIGHT LINE CONNECTING THE TWO PROTRUDING POINTS ON THE LOW-
 TIDE LINE ON EITHER BANK OF THE RIVER MOUTH MAY SERVE AS THE BASELINE.
 4.  IF REEFS AND BARS ABOVE WATER AT LOW TIDE ARE SITUATED WHOLLY OR
 PARTLY AT A DISTANCE NOT EXCEEDING THE BREADTH OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA
 FROM THE MAINLAND OR AN ISLAND, THE LOW-T3DE LINES ON THOSE REEFS AND
 BARS MAY BE USED AS BASELINES FOR MEASURING THE BREADTH OF THE TERRITORIAL
 SEA.
