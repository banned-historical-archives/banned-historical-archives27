Abstract 
Sailluill.114811M111.1.1111?11 
Since 1950 the Chinese Comnnnists have expended considerable effort 
and resources to promote the interchange of visits of their private citizens 
and semiofficial representatives with those of other nations. Peiping has 
encouraged these visits in order to develop "closer ties between nations, 
more friendly contacts, more economic and cultural intercourse." They 
began on a modest scale during the IlOrean hostilities and have since been 
rapidly accelerated, particularly during the past three years, when they 
were supplemented by numerous reciprocal state visits involving prime 
ministers, foreign ministers, and other official dignitaries. They have 
increasingly involved non-Commulist and anti-Communist personages. In 1956, 
Peiping claims, there were a total of over 5,400 individual visits by 
Chinese Communists to 49 countries, while over 5,200 foreigners, repre-
senting 75 countries, visited Communist China. 
These visitors have travelled individually or collectively as 
scientists, eduoators? technicians, or as members of theatrical ensembles, 
athletic teams, trade promotional groups, social groups, or as representa-
tives of a wide variety of semi-official organizations. Although their 
alleged purpose has been cultural and technical exchange, they have been 
used to advance Pelpingls international obectives? both in countries of 
the Corn:mist bloc and in nonwConraunist countries, particularly those with 
which it has no diplomatic relations. Communist Chines campaign of 
"peopleis diplomacy" has been effective, particularly in Asian countries, 
in advertising the domestic "attainments" of the regime, in creating the 
Nom./ impression of Peipingis "peaceful" purpose and "reasonable" conduct, and in 
reducing the Chinese Communist regineis international isolation.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A. Objectives and D......aeve1aamL5.1.2=12111122,111ur 
The exchange of unofficial delegations between Communist China and. 
other countries of' the?Communist and_nen.Communist world,. referred to,ta_____ 
this paper as "peoples diplomacy," has been an portant adjunct to 
Chinese Comiunist.diplomacy.since.1950. It has been used by Peiping in an 
effort to ereate.a.spirit_of "socialist solidarity" between Communist China 
and other Conununist.bloc countries and. a .corresponding feeling of anti- . 
Western:.!!tolidarity" among Asian and, more recently??African peoples.- It 
has:been.used in the attempt to create credence for Communist propaganda 
charges and claims, most .notably the bacteriological warfare charges of 
tbe-Kerean.w.and present claims in-connectionwith Communist Chinats 
five.yearjaans. It has been used in the effort to break Communist Chinats 
.international isolation by expanding. contacts with non-Communist countries, 
particularly those that do not maintain.diplomatio,relations with Peiping, 
and to:create channels of subversive influence, particularly in Asia.: It. 
has been, used to and facilitate the acquisition of scientific 
And. technicalinformaticn from both the bloc.and-the rest, and to impress. 
the people of Cpmmunist-China with. the alleged advantages of' membership 
in the Communist bloa. 
, The most remarkable use of "peaplets diplomacy" to further Chinese 
Commuaist objectives was during the Korean war, when the Chinese Communists 
succeeded in creating acceptance in some circles for charges that the US 
had engaged in biological warfare in Korea and in widespread espionage and 
sabotage in China. These charges were illustrated by elaborate displays of 
equipment allegedly used by US forces in these activities and by photographs 
of materials allegedly dropped including "infected" flies and other insects. 
Selected groups of lawyers, scientists, and other "experts" were invited 
from many countries to view and investigate this evidence. 
Peipingts success in persuading susceptible foreigners, including 
non-Communists, of the truth of its propaganda encouraged the regime to 
extend "people's diplomacy" after the Korean hostilities to include in. 
creasing contacts non-Communists who for one reason or another were 
judged tobe -susceptible to Communist propaganda. Gradually the Chinese 
-- 
c 
Communist authorities o.Le to realize that often even confirmed anti-
CoMmunista.could be exploited through the tactic'of."peoplets diplomacy," 
either because these individuals restrained their criticism while enjoying 
Peipingte lavish hospitality or because they were persons whose very 
presence contributed to breaking Peipingts international isolation. 
_ 
"People ?s diplomacy" has become increasingly important to the 
Chinese Communists as an avsAe of contact with non-Communist states as

Peiping failed to gain the general diplomatic acceptance that it undoubted-17 
had anticipated. Communist China it present has been recognized by an1y 
30 statea, of which 25 are members of the UN. (The other five are 
Switzerland and the Communist regimes' in Outer Mongolia, North Korea; --
North Vietnam, and East Germany. In addition, Peiping enjoys the support . 
of twd UN members the Byeaorussian and Ukrainian Ss us which do not 
maintain independent diplomatic 'contacts but Share in the Soviet recognii. 
tion of Cohmunist China.) Of the states recognizing Peiping, 26 had 
accorded recognition before the CommEnist invasion of the Republic of Korea; 
only four have taken such action since the and of the Korean hostilities. 
In contrast to this record of limited diplomatic acceptance of the 
Peiping regime, the Chinese Communists have entered into direct contact ? -

B. Nature of Delegations 
The delegations, travelling collectively or individually in a 
continual flow to and from Communist China, vary both as to activities in 
which they engage and us to the training, background, and competence of 
the individual members. For example, missions may consist exclusively of 
medical personnel or of lawyers or of educators, or they may be hetero-
geneous grotpings, composed of persons of widely different skills and 
experience. An example of the heterogeneous group is a so-called "cultural 
mission," sent by the Chinese Communists to Italy, France, and Switzerland 
in May and June 1956. This delegation was headed by a chemist and eon. 
slated, in addition, of an economist, a civil engineer, two writers, two 
painters: and a vocalist. 
The types of delegations sent most frequently to any one country 
depended to a considerable extent on the nature of relations between 
Communist China and the specific country cone ;d Thus; althongh 
"peace" missions and woment's and youth delegations were freely exchanged 
between mainland China and most other countries, emphasis was placed on 
technical missions in exchanges within the bloc and on types of delegations 
which might accomplish most in "selling" Communist China or inviting 
further contact in dealing with countries outside the bloc. In dealing 
with Burma, for example, Chinese Communist delegations were most frequently 
either Buddhist or "friendship" 6roups; in dealing with previously uric On.. 
tacted countries such as those in South America, Africa, and the Middle 
East, theatrical missions Were most common, in the case of most Western 
European states, attempts were made to present more sophisticated dele-
gations gauged to appeal to the individual countries concerned. 
The Chinese Communists classified the delegations involved in 
"people's diplomacy" in 1955 according to 10 broad categories. These, 
together with the number of people involved and the number of delegations 
into Olich they were grouped (delegations in brackets), were as follows:

A comparable breakdoun for 1956 is not available. In generale however, 
the nature af the delegations has continued along the pattern established 
in-1955. - 
. 1. Cultural and Art. One of the main points of emphasis continues 
to bp the eSaailee Zredeatrical and art groups. One cultural team spant 
eight months abroad, touring nine countries. Lost significant of these 
developments were perhaes the visits of Chinese Communist theatrical groups 
in the spring of 1956 to South America, Ethiopia, and several Arab states --
areae in which the Chinese Communists had previously had little or no 
contact. The group visiting Ethiopia and the Arab states was made up 
largely of Chinese and Turki Moslem groups, featuring folk danoers from 
Sinkiang. Other representative functions included a visit to Norway of 
Chinese Communist actors to participate in the 50th anniversary of the death 
of Henrik Ibsen and the first showing of Chinese Communist films in Thailand 
(march 1956) and in Australia (August 1955). 
. Meanwhile, in Peiping the Chinese Mozart Committee staged a Mozart 
festival (June 19, 1956) to which were invited Austrian and other foreign 
delegations-. Peiping continued its annual festivities to commemorate the 
"worldes cultural ciente at which Val b Uhitman (for his "Leaves of Grass") 
was honored in 1956 and to which foreign cultural eel egeations were invited, 
Japanese Kabuki players gave several performances in Communist China; 
Indonesian (December 31 1955) aad Pakistani (May 16, 1956) movies were 
introduced fer the first time; and, among others, German and Prenoh authors 
and playwrights and Japanese and Italian painters and sculptors exhibited 
their skills and exchanged experiences with Chinese artiste; and an 
Argentinian composer and pianist conducted a concert tour of China. 
2 Scientific  "lemeational and Public Health Sclentific exchanges 
ranged frZ;i7rare .11,,ome energreMrb3.ffirping (Hay 1955) to a 
meeting of the Sino-Albanian Joint Committee for cooperation in TechnoledY 
and Technical Science. Other scientific exchanges included a parade of 
Soviet zooloeists, botanists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, and 
peogrephers. Similar teens, theueh fewer in number, came from other coun-
tries, particularly from the Soviet bloc. 
Numerous Chinese scientists travelled abroad; one delegation 
participated in, the Indian Science Congress held in Barodae Bombay,

teacherfQ institutes visited USSR educational institutions to study the 
Soviet system. Other smaller groups or individuals with similar general 
or more specific interests visited other countries while foreign educators 
historians, scientists, and others -- went to China to assist the Chinese 
or for purposes of study. 
3. Workers liontnz,..and Youth. Generally the widest exchanges were 
those con'tdi.Weala,n-WsooTerarid-upescen categories. In some cases 
the rbilippines (students), Geld Coast (women), Senegal, and Madagascar. 
(youth and women), the only delegations to visit Communist China fell 
in these categories 
Delegations in this category were for the most part, official 
representatives at a congress of youth, students, or women, some sponsored 
by Communist China, others sponsored by other countries to which Communist 
China sent representatives. 
4. Peace and Friendshipp "Peace" conferences, sponsored and composed 
of CommunilrgYilipatlilzeFS, Offered the Chinese Communists opportunity to 
meet left-wingers from many eountries with which they had otherwise no 
contact. After the Helsinki "peace" conference, Peiping issued a general 
invitation for delegates to visit Communist China. As a result visitors 
from many countries such as Iceland, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, with 
which Peiping had had little or no contact, made detours to China with no 
anal, 00ea.an4"tae purpose than to propagate "peace." 
Frie4ship associations, patterned after the Sino-Soviet Friendship 
Association04 have been established in previous years with most bloc 
countries, During the period covered by this report, greatest emphasis 
was placed on the establishment or expansion of friendship associations 
with Asian-African states. Although the Sino-Indian Friendship 
Association has existed for many years, the Indonesia-China Friendship 
Association is relatively young. Friendship associations with Pakistan 
were formed first in June 1956 and with Egypt (ravember 18, 1956) only 
after the call was issued for Chinese volunteers for Egypt in the Suez 
crises. Greatest effort over the past year appears to have been expended

in opening new units of the Indonesia?China Friendship Association in 
various cities of Indonesia and secondary emphasis on increasing the number 
of units of the Japan-China Friendship Association in Japan. The Peiping 
regime gave North Korea 5,000 trees which were planted in pyongyang, and 
named the Korea-China friendship forest. 
50 Social (Public)prganization. Precisely what delegations the 
Chinese C-oriM.X64113FlitTe?finTirs?c-itegory is not clear, although it may 
cover such groups as that representing the "Japanese Council for Restoration 
Of biplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union" which toured 
Communist China or the delegations representing Chinese cooperatives sent 
to study conditions in Norway and Sweden. 
6, Economic and Trade. The Peiping regime participated widely in 
trade failTaiiirgrrlairenaries and expended considerable resources to 
make its exhibit conspicuous even if its wares were inferior to those of - 
competing countries. Peiping S's exhibits at the Poznan International Fair 
in Poland, the Paris International Fair in France, and the Reykjavik Fair 
in Iceland, drew much attention and generally provoked highly favorable 
comments. The Chinese also sponsored fairs and exhibits in Communist 
China, at which wares and goods of one or more countries were exhibited. 
Chinese missions energetically sought to increase trade with the 
nong.Zommunist bloc; they were particularly active in countries which had 
not recognized the Peiping regime, such as Japan and the Arab states; and 
trade missions may well have served as the opening wedge in Egypt and 
Syria both ot whioh fe,eedlly recognized Communist China shortly after 
trade missions appeared in each state. 
'?Economic delegations varied from highly technical mechanical and 
industrial missions to trade union delegations and experts on Mize culti. 
vation. Among such groups going to mainland China were a Hungarian textile 
mission and a mineral experts mission that provided technical aid in those 
fields, Indian railway workers who observed the operations of Chinese 
railways, and Czech farm specialists who helped install equipment given 
by Czechoslovakia to a Czech Friendship State Farm. Chinese Communist 
building workers union members went to New Zealand cities and Chinese 
agronomists went to Indonesia to study the cultivation of tropical amps. 
?7, ' Religious. In the field of religion the Chinese Communists have 
attempted -to peeJn,e)e ...famed the illusion that freedom of religion exists 
in Communist China and have attempted to exploit religious institutions 
abroad for Communist purposes, lath ambitions to attain leadership of the 
Asian-African states, it has become particularly important for the Chinese 
to.foster the idea that Moslems in China are permitted freedom of religious 
exercise even though Communist ideology does not condone religion. To this 
end Islamic delegations were invited to China to observe Islamic communi. 
ties in China, to lecture at the Institute of Islamic Theology, and tn

was interested in Observing the status of Protestant congregations in 
mainland China and in doing what it could to further international peace 
and understanding. The delegation, upon its return, issued a report that 
was on balance highly favorable to the regime. Members of the delegation, 
lectured widely in the UK, US, Canada, and Switzerland. 
8. Press and Broadcasting. As in the case of 'peace" delegates,

Peiping is e-rarrffiffition to participants in the conference of 
journalists in Helsinki in June 1956 to visit Communist China. As a 
result of this invitation delegates from manY nations including Brazil, 
Chile Iran, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay visited Ooramunist China. The 
Peruvian delegate was the only one from that country to visit Communist 
China during the period of this report, Communist China has recognized 
the value of friendly journalists in promoting Peipingts cause abroad and 
has encouraged even American pressmen to visit China. 
9. Ph sical Culture. Although Peiping withdrew at the last moment 
from the 4M51155*-65 the pretext of not wanting to compete in the same 
arena with representatives of Nationalist China, the Peiping regime has 
given much emphasis to physical culture and to competition with athletic 
teams of Other countries in a wide variety of sports. Chinese Communist' 
teams have been sent abroad or vied with foreign teams in mainland China

China, of visiting delegations' transportation, hotel accommbdational and 
allowances for miscellaneous expenses, :and 'souvenirs. The latter range in 
some cases-?rom.the equivalent of US $44 to $160 per trip, and have 
enabled some visitors to leave China, with more money than they had when 
they entered* In some cases Peiping alsolpays for transportation from the 
country of origin to C4ina, In cases of delegations travelling via the USSR, 
Peiping apparently bears the expenses at least from the time of entry into 
Soviet or bloc territory.

The Peiping regime. almost. invariably bears the entire cost for 
Chinese Communist delegations to non-Communist countries (for delegations 
to bloc countries, reciprocity presumably applies). Proceeds from the sale 
of admissions during theatrical tours are usually donated to local 
charities, and goods exhibited at trade fairs on occasion have been given 
to influential local personages* 
The precise monetary costs of "people's diplomacy" cannot be calcu-
lated but some roughapproximations are possible. 
During the period January 1955 through June 1956 terminal dates are 
known of 2,793 visitors who spent 17,480 weeks (or an average of 6.3 weeks 
per person) in Communist China and for 1,982 Chinese who spent 7,318 weeks 
(an average of 3.7 weeks per person) abroad. Professor E4 S. Kirby of the 
University of Hong Kong, who led a delegation to Communist China in 1955: 
reported that it cest the Peiping regime $194 per person per week during a 
'visit in China. This figure probably represents the upper level of CommniSt expenditure on visitors to China as representatives from bloc countries 
probably are treated with less ostentation. Of the 4,760 visitors to 
Communist China in 1955, 1,811 were from the Soviet bloc. Using $194 as 
the weekly per...person cost for non-bloc visitors and an arbitrary $160 for 
bloc visitors, a 1955 cost figure of $4,700,000 is derived. Projected 
over the first six months of 1956 when roughly 2,600 persons visited Comma. 
mist China, this would result in approximately $2,600,000 or a total of 
$7,300,000 for the period January 1955 through June 30, 1956.1 
CV-nese Communist visitors averaged 3.7 weeks abroad and in 1955 
totaled 5,833 of wham 3,941 went to Soviet bloc countries, which may have 
met their local costs. The living costs in foreign exchange to Communist 
China for the remaining 1,892 may be estimated at $1,000,0000 based on 
reports from Chile and Ethiopia indicating that it costs $140 per person 
per week for the Chinese Communist opera troupes visiting those countries. 
An estimate of the travel costs for all Chinese Communist visitors abroad 
is at best even more tenuous since all official visits to foreign countries 
are presumably included though the same delegation in some instances 
visited more than one country. The magnitude in 1955, however, might have 
been $2,9001000 assuming an average round trip of 10,000 miles at a cost of 
$0.05 per mile. Again projecting these figures for roughly 2,700 Chinese 
abroad during the first six months of 1956 yields a figure of $1,800,0000

The Cost of Chinese travelling abroad on "people's diplomacy" missions may 
thus be tentatively estimated at $5,700,000 during the 18.mnnth period.1 
The sui of these rough calculations,$13,000,000, suggests that the 
program cost the Peiping regime at least $0,000,000 during this period 
and possibly as much as $20,000,000. 
In additicn to the monfatiry outlay, the program of "people's 
diplomacy" has added to the burden of Communist China's heavily.taxed trans-
potation system, as many delegations have been granted the use of special 
railway coaches, buses and airplanes. The program has also added signifi. 
cantly to the burden pieced on Communist China's key officials, ranging 
from Nac Tse-tung, Liu Shao-chti, and Chou En.lai down to countless 
technical and ,managerial personnel, who have taken time out for visiting 
delegations. Virtually all important delegations are received at least by 
Liu Shao.achli or Chou Enalai and often by Mao Tsewtung himself; Delegations 
have been particularly impressed by the amount of time top ranking officials 
have devoted to them often exceeding the period officially scheduled* 
Some of Communist China's key officials have developed great skills ip 
tailoring these interviews to the susceptibilities of particular delegations, 
reflecting considerable effort in preliminary planning and briefing.

"People's diplomacy" in its early days was limited almost exclusively 
to the exchange of delegations of trusted Communists and collaborators from 
Commmnist China and selected fellow-travellers and sympathizers from non-
ComMunist,areas. The Communists soon learned that susceptible persons not 
subject to strict Gommunist discipline could be made to accept and propagate 
the most implausible Communist propaganda, and gradually they began to ' 
exploit visits of selected persons who were basically impartial or even. 
anti-Commmunidt. any such visitors. =combed to standard techniques of 
guided tours, emphasizing Communist China's material achievements (i.e. in 
the constructien or reconatruction of industrial plants). Few of the ' 
non-TellOw travelling visitors spoke Chinese and some of them were 
sufficiently unfamiliar with China to accept pre.Communist installations 
as CommUntst "achievements" (e.g. Japanese factories in Manchuria). With 
the further development of the post.Stalin "peace and coexistence" cam- ' 
peign, Peiping came to recognize that even critical visitors served its 
purposes by demonstrating the 'freedom' that existed in Communist China* 
Even the most highly critical visitors tended to overshadow their criticism

with admissions of Cellmilnist material progress, and often the criticism 
itaelf vas exploited by Peiping as proof of the feasibility of "coexistence." 
For example, one highly respected British economist, Nicholas Kaldor, was 
permitted in Peiping to address a large student gathering on the fallacies 
of Marxist economies as "evidence? of academic freedom in Communist China. 
Peiping's techniques for limiting the critical reporting of anti-
Communist visitors are varied. The technique of the guided tour is well 
known? loherever possible visitors are shown ?model? plants, farms, 
villages, and sorIWAes even prisons? The recent trend has been to permit 
delegations somewhat more leoway in selecting areas to be visited, but 
even where delegations are given a relatively free hand, time limitations, 
language barriers, and difficulties in transportation are exploited by the 
Communists to maintain the inaccessibility of sensitive areas. Often the 
visiter_to Cemmunist China is so overwhelmed with a schedule of interviews 
with important dignitaries and tours of undeniably worthwhile sights that 
he has little time to exercise whatever freedom Peiping ostensibly may 
grant 111214 
Cenoomittant with the increasing latitude in issuing invitations 
to Communist China has been a tendency to permit travel abroad of Chinese 
whose support of the regime is quelfied in some way. The regime appears 
now to 'be su=ciently confident of its support to permit relatively 
independent-minded intellectuals to join delegations. The most noteworthy 
example of this trend was the permission granted the Dalai Lama to visit 
India, after the regime had repeatedly invented reasons why he could not 
leave Tibet to accept invitations to iminortant Buddhist celebrations out-
side of China,, In such instances, Peiping presumably calculates that the 
individual has sufficient personal ties at home to make him hesitate to 
express excessive criticism of the regime and to prevent him from defecting. 
Missions inoluding "untrustworthy? delegates are, in addition, =WAY 
supervised by reliable fellow travellers or Communists. 
E. Success of the  Program 
Although Peiping is recognized by only 30 states, through these 
informal channels contacts, tenuous or well established, have been formed 
with peoples or governments of some 70 nations. These contacts played a 
significant role in breaking down resistance in Egy,q, and Syria to recog. 
nition of Communist China and are being employed toward the same end in 
Sudan, Ethiopia Japan, most of the Arab states, and elsewhere. Before 
the visit to Ethiopia of a 75-man Chinese Communist theatrical group, a 
US Embassr.USIS report states, the only thing Ethiopians knew of the 
Chinese Communists was that they had been killing Ethiopians in Korea. 
After the visit, however, references to the Chinese Communists would 
hardly evoke the same hostile reaction as before.

APeoplets diplomacy," supplementing the state visits of Chou En-lai 
:and other Peiping leaders and of foreign official dignitaries to Peiping, 
has done much to dispel fear of Chinese Communist militancy and aggres. 
sisanaas and has achievedc 
considerable success in creating, particularly in 
the Mind's of certain leaders Of Asian-African states, the impression of the 
"reasonable" and "peace-eeeking" characteristics of Chinese Communist leaders 
and of their policies. 
Through "peoplets diplodacy," Peipingts leaders have also made 
prOgress in fostering the concept that unlimited trade with Communist China 
would develop if only Western trade controls were eliminated, and that this 
trade would solve many local economic ills. Japan, in particular, haa 
been vulnerable to this approach. Chinese Communist trade overtures have 
not, however, been limited to the Far East, but have also been extended to 
South America, Europe, the Eiddle Fast, and Africa. Peiping has discovered 
that, the offer of trade opens avenues of contact that can lead to the 
achievement of other goals. Thus in Japan the issue of Sino-Japanese trade 
provides the Communists with leveraae for attacking US policy and to attempt 
to undermine the US in Japan. Trade offers have also opened the way for 
Chinese Communist penetration in 'the hiddle East. The Bandung Conference 
appears to have paved the way' for the sending of trade missions to Egypt and 
Syrie, which did much to weaken the Chinese Nationalist position in the 
?addle East and to clear the way for ultimate recognition of Communist China, 
fit by Egypt, then by Syria and Yemen. In Japan, moreover "people's 
diploMaoy" supported by a flood of Japanese-language Chinese Communist 
propaganda has contributed to a climate in Japanese public opinion strongly 
favoring a rapprochement with Peiping. Over half of the members of the 
Japanese Diet have visited Communist China. 
, In general the Chinese Coanunists have succeeded in establishing 
contacts with peoples in many countries where they have been denied official 
contact because of their limited diplomatic relations. Through these 
informal channels they have been able to remold attitudes toward Communist 
China and to achieve some of their international objectives. In some 
cases dpeoplets diplomacy" has paved the way to formal diplomatic relations 
and Peiping, no doubt, has reat faith that its further development will 
play a significant role in ultimately bringing about Communist China's 
general acceptance as a world power.
