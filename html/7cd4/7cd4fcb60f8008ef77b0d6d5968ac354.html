 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS OPENS IN PEIPING
 Chou's Speech
 Chou En-iai, in his 30,000-
 word address to the opening
 session of the twice-delayed
 National People's Congress on
 26 June, reaffirmed established
 positions on questions of f or-
 eign and domestic policy.   Chou
 spoke before 1,062 deputies,
 foreign guests and Mao Tse-tung
 and Liu Shao-chi, who presided
 over the opening session.
 Chou, according to the of-
 ficial Chinese Communist sum-
 mary of his speech, declared
 that during the past year the
 international situation has
 been developing along lines
 ."beneficial to peace" despite
 constant threats posed by Ameri-
 can "imperialist policy."  As
 major factors in this develop-
 ment,            he cited "reasonable"
 Soviet proposals for arms limi-
 tation, the growing importance
 of the Asian-African countries,
 the increasing Japanese demands
 for "independence," and the
 Taiwan riots.
 In line with Peiping's
 continuing emphasis on Sino-
 Soviet bloc unity, Chou asserted
 that solidarity had grown, not
 weakened, following the Hun-
 garian rebellion.  Facts, he
 said,  prove that unity based on
 "proletarian internationalism
 and equality" cannot be destroyed
 by provocations. He praised
 Soviet economic assistance for
 Communist China, declaring that
 Peiping's achievements were
 "inseparable" from Soviet help
 and "expert guidance."  He ex-
 pressed "heartfelt thanks" for
 Russian aid and promised that
 Communist China would continue
 Soviet Union and all other So-
 cialist countries.
 On the economic side, Chou
 revealed that overspending in
 1956 and a poor agricultural
 showing, which he blamed on
 the "worst weather in several
 decades," had resulted in  a
 budget deficit of $750,000,000
 at the end of that year.   Sur-
 pluses left over from previous
 years covered only a part  of
 the deficit, forcing the   re-
 gime to borrow  and issue cur-
 rency to cover the remainder.
 This is the first year since
 1950 that the regime has ad-
 mitted the need of a currency
 issue to cover a deficit.  Chou
 said that the Chinese Communists
 plan to achieve a balance in
 the 1957 budget by increasing
 revenues and reducing expendi-
 tures, including a cut of 20
 percent for investment in fixed
 assets.
 On domestic political mat-
 ters, Chou admitted that the
 Communists had executed about
 one in six "counterrevolution-
 aries" arrested before 1952.
 Communist statements at the
 time indicated a much higher
 ratio than this and a total
 greater than  the 800,000 execu-
 tions reported in  unofficial
 versions of Mao's "secret"
 speech.   Chou defended the "few
 cases" which had been mishandled
 by claiming that Communist
 achievements were "fundamental,"
 while errors were "individual."
 Chou repeated last year's
 promise of a government decen-
 tralization program which would
 encourage local initiative
 "under central leadership."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 June 1957
 "democratic" party leaders who
 had been accused of overstepping
 the bounds of legitimate criti-
 cism, Chou reaffirmed the funda-
 mental principle that the United
 Front is led by the Chinese Com-
 munist Party and based on a
 foundation of "socialism."  He
 warned that departure from this
 principle would lead to the ex-
 pulsion of "democratic" parties
 from the front.
 Later sessions of the con-
 gress may decide the fate of
 these non-Communist leaders,
 several of whom are cabinet min-
 isters.   It seems likely that
 they will not receive severe
 punishment in view of Mao's
 policy of resolving "contradic-
 tions" through persuasion and
 education.  However, they may
 be replaced by less outspoken
 non-Communist officials.
 Invitation to Criticism
 Early in May, the Chinese
 Communist Party had invited the
 "democratic" or puppet parties to
 participate in the regime's ef-
 forts to improve its work
 through criticism and self-
 criticism.   Top "democratic"
 leaders such as  Lo Lung-chi,
 the minister of timber industry,
 Chang Po-chun, the minister of
 communications, Chang Nai-chi,
 the minister of food, Lung Yun,
 a vice chairman of the National
 Defense Council, and others,
 responded almost immediately.
 Their criticism attacked the
 regime at its core;  that is,
 they challenged the leadership
 of the Communist Party and the
 need for "socialism" in China.
 able question concerning their
 motivation.   One strong pos-
 sibility is that they received
 initial encouragement from the
 Communists, but went too far,
 either because they misjudged
 the limits laid down by Peiping
 or were carried away by a genuine
 sense of frustration with the
 regime.
 Another, and perhaps more
 likely, possibility is that
 they are being sacrificed by the
 Communists in order to discourage
 others from following them.
 This reasoning is supported by
 editorials calling for the separa-
 tion of "antisocialist" criti-
 cism from constructive criti-
 cism.
 In the past several weeks
 there has been a rash of edito-
 rials in the official People's
 Daily branding these critics as
 "rightists" and calling for
 strong countercriticism of their
 "antisocialist" views.   The pup-
 pet parties have responded by
 violently attacking their own
 leaders, and one party at least
 has called for the expulsion of
 two of its top leaders.
 The publication on 18 June
 of the edited version of Mao's
 secret speech should have removed
 any doubts among intellectuals
 about the extent of approved
 criticism.   His six standards
 for distinguishing right and
 wrong narrowly limit criticism
 to that which is directed toward
 strengthening the people's demo-
 cratic dictatorship, the unity
 of the party and people, and
 "socialism."
 Since the most outspoken
 of these critics are among the
 top leaders of their respective
 parties--men who during many
 years of co-operation with the
 Communists have presumably
 learned about Communism and its
 restrictions--there is consider-

 Congress session may provide the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 REACTION TO PLAN FOR KOREAN ARMS MODERNIZATION
 The Communist bloc, and
 Peiping in particular, has
 sharply condemned the American
 decision to give UN forces in
 South Korea modern weapons.   In
 general, reactions have  ex-
 pressed grave concern over al-
 leged American attempts to ab-
 rogate the Korean armistice
 unilaterally "in preparation
 for war."
 The first and most out-
 spoken Chinese Communist com-
 ment came on 21 June.   It as-
 serted that "this American ac-
 tion has destroyed the Korean
 truce agreement as a whole,
 seriously threatened. the state
 of the Korean truce and the
 peace in the Far East."  By 23
 June, Peiping had somewhat modi-
 fied its stand, and rather than
 stating that the truce agree-
 ment had been destroyed, limited
 its observations to "this Ameri-
 can action has seriously threat-
 ened the armistice agreement."
 At the same time, the Chi-
 nese Communists pledged that
 the "Korean-Chinese side would
 fight to defend the armistice
 agreement," a pronouncement
 probably aimed at South Korean
 leaders who have called for the
 nullification of the entire
 truce agreement.
 milder than those made in Pei-'
 ping; Pyongyang, however, may
 well have been waiting for the
 line to set before taking a
 strong stand.   Stressing the
 familiar theme of unification,
 Premier Kim Il-sung on 21 June
 called for the withdrawal of
 all foreign troops and the con-
 vocation of an international
 conference of those states con-
 cerned in the settlement of the
 Korean question.   By 24 June,
 protests had become more bel-
 ligerent, with North Korean
 generals asserting to mass
 gatherings to commemorate the
 seventh anniversary of the
 Korean war their ability to
 "smash the military adventures
 of the United States."
 On 26 June the North Ko-
 reans called a meeting of the
 Joint Military Armistice Com-
 mission to reject the American
 decision and formally present
 Kim Il-sung's demands as  made
 in his 21 June speech.   The
 Communist objections were propa-
 gandistic in nature and did not
 resemble an ultimatum.   At the
 opening session of the National
 People's Congress on 26 June,
 Premier Chou En-lai emphasized
 that China would give its full
 support to North Korean proposals
 for reunification.
 The Soviet Union has also
 assailed the American decision,
 although the intensity of Mos-
 cow's reaction falls short of
 Peiping's.   Moscow has charged
 that American attempts to justi-
 fy new arms for South Korea
 are linked to a general Ameri-
 can campaign to block an agree-
 ment on disarmament.
 The first objections raised
 by the regime most directly
 concerned, North Korea, were
 Pyongyang's propaganda cam-
 paign depicting the moderniza-
 tion as illegal and picturing
 North Korea as the faithful de-
 fender of international treaties

 ent high pitch for some time.

 has been sparse to date, al-
 though factual and moderate in
 tone has generally approved the
 American action.  The British,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 press all mentioned the need to
 redress the Korean balance of
 power and considered the de-
 cision justified.   Both the
 London Times and Manchester
 Guardian reported the necessity
 of the decision but viewed it
 as regrettable at a time when
 East and West were talking of
 reducing their armed strength.
 The French press  reported
 Paris' official support.
 Indian prime minister
 Nehru, when queried for his
 opinion, foresaw "trouble, dis-
 cord and violence" resulting
 from such weapons being "spread
 out in all kinds of countries."
 In Japan, Mainichi Shimbun
 printed a factual e3itbrrial
 and cautioned that the UN ac-
 tion could touch off a dangerous
 armament race in Korea which
 would have an adverse effect on
 the London disarmament talks.
 Taipei and Seoul hailed
 the decision as long overdue.
 President Rhee called the "move
 indispensable but far from
 enough."  Seoul press reaction
 was equally approving, only
 lamenting that the whole armi-
 stice agreement had not been
 abrogated, a long-standing de-
 sire of President Rhee.   South
 Korea's initial elation was
 subsequently deflated by re-
 ports that its military forces     25X1
 would not receive e
 nuclear capability.
 MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTHEAST CHINA
 Chinese Communist artil-
 lery on 24 June fired 9,000
 rounds on the Quemoy Islands,
 the heaviest artillery barrage
 against the Nationalist-held
 islands to date.   There is no
 information indicat-
 ing a Communist in-
 tention for an early
 invasion of the Que-
 moys.
 The heavy Com-
 munist shelling on
 24 June probably
 stems from one or
 more of the follow-
 ing factors:   re-
 taliation against in-
 creased Chinese Na-
 tionalist fire and
 aggressive National-
 ist naval activity
 in the area; a Pei-
 ping decision to con-
 test Nationalist as-

 officials in Hong Kong
 There are about 89,000
 Chinese Communist troops in
 the Amoy area and 84,000 Chi-
 nese Nationalists on the Que-
 moy Islands.   The Communists
 would probably not launch an
 all-out offensive against the
 islands without building up
 their troop strength to at
 least a three-to-one numerical
 advantage, although they do
 have the capability to attack
 the lightly defended islands of

 are reported to have advised
 shipping companies against
 sailing to Amoy.  Chinese Com-
 munist shore batteries can be
 expected to provide covering
 fire for any vessel attempting
 to enter the port, and this
 may result in future shooting
 incidents.
 Syria
 Syrian president Quwatly's
 decision to forego his trip to
 Europe at this time appears to
 have reduced prospects of a po-
 litical power play by the left-
 ist military group which is ex-
 ercising de facto control.
 Syrian leftists, following King
 Hussain's successes in Jordan
 during April, apparently feared
 they might be the next target
 of Western-backed moves.   These
 misgivings were accentuated by
 internal developments during
 late May and early June which
 threatened to alter the balance
 of power.  These included the
 abortive scheme of moderate
 legislators to resign and pre-
 cipitate a cabinet crisis,
 President Quwatly's "illness"
 and plans to leave the country,
 and reports that dispirited
 Prime Minister Asali wanted to
 resign.
 Since none of these moves
 has materialized, the leftists
 at this time appear to be with-
 out an opportunity to make a
 bid for full, open control.
 The absence of any effective
 pro-Western military leader in
 command of a major unit in the
 Damascus area, however, empha-
 sizes the weakness of the op-
 position.
 Tension has increased on
 the Syrian-Israeli frontier,
 and Israel has sent a warning
 to Syria through the Israeli-
 Syrian Mixed Armistice Commis-
 sion against a repetition of
 recent killings.
 Increasing attacks on King
 Saud in the Syrian press have
 provoked Saud to the point where
 he has threatened to close his
 embassy in Syria unless the at-
 tacks stop.   Saud's ambassador
 has already left Syria.
 Israeli Reactions
 Israel has expressed "seri-
 ous concern" that the emergence
 of a relatively pro-Western
 Arab group under King Saud might
 result in diminished Western
 support for Israel, and. "fore-
 tells a difficult political
 struggle for Israel."  Foreign
 Minister Meir has said she fears
 that each bloc in the divided
 Arab world "would attempt to
 prove itself the leading protag-
 onist  of hatred and war against
 Israel."  She also expressed
 concern that the emphasis which
 Saud placed on the religious

 of Arab-Israeli tension.   Mrs.
 Meir stated that if this situa-
 tion continued, Saud could in
 the long run prove more danger-
 ous to Israel than Nasr.
 Nasr's Reaction
 Nasr's reaction to the
 recent decline in his prestige
 has been to attack his Arab
 rivals by accusing them of
 softness toward Israel and sub-
 servience to the West.   Mount-
 ing Egyptian press accusations
 against alleged United States
 political intrigue in the Middle
 East reflect his belief that
 the United States is responsible
 for his troubles and is "out to
 get him."  Egyptian and Syrian
 propaganda has sought to link
 Saudi Arabia,  Jordan,  Iraq and
 Lebanon in alleged negotiations
 with Israel to settle the Arab
 refugee problem on Israel's
 terms--all under American pres-
 sure.
 Jordan's Prime Minister
 Rifai is represented as having
 conducted recent negotiations
 for a peace treaty with Israeli
 premier Ben-Gurion.   Egypt has
 also attempted to discredit the
 candidacy in Lebanon of George
 Malik, long-time friend of the
 United States, by publicizing
 a forged letter allegedly ex-
 changed by him with Israel's
 ambassador in Washington.   A
 composite photograph is reported
 to have been prepared portraying
 Jordan's King Hussain in "rock
 and roll" antics.
 The Egyptian press has al-
 so moved to enhance Nasr's pres-
 tige by reporting plans to iffake
 his long-deferred visit to the
 Soviet Union in August.   Other

 in the past primarily as a

 In Lebanon,  the third

 dates now have won 40 out of
 52 seats contested thus far.
 The final balloting, for 14
 seats in north Lebanon, will be

 good showing by opposition
 candidates in the 23 June elec-

 the result would be overwhelming
 approval of its policies. r
 As a result, it has had
 to resort to an arbitrary use
 of constitutional provisions,
 backed when necessary by intim-
 idation and suppression.
 The constitution of Egypt,
 adopted in 1956 after being
 tailor-made by the revolution-
 ary clique, does not provide for
 conventional political parties.
 In place of the parties, there
 is a National Union, for the
 purpose of nominating all'can-
 ?didates from among whom the
 representatives are elected by
 popular vote.   The actual ap-
 proval of applicants for candi-
 dacy is done by the National
 Union's executive committee,
 which is appointed by Egypt's
 president.   Its decisions are
 not subject to appeal, and, in
 the hands of the regime, it has
 proved to be an effective weapon
 for eliminating individuals
 whose election is not desired.
 The stated criterion for judg-
 ing an applicant's qualifica.-
 tions is whether or not he may
 be counted on  to "carry for-
 ward the aims of the revolu-
 tion."
 The executive committee an-
 nounced completion of screening
 of applicants on 17 June.   Out
 of more than 2,500 applicants,
 approximately 1,300 candidates
 were accepted.  Of these, over
 60 will be unopposed in their
 campaigns--including 16 members
 of the Nasr cabinet.
 With regard to Communist
 opposition,  the election prepar-
 tions have hastened an overt
 settlement of their status.
 Nasr reportedly had been con-
 fident that no significant Com-
 munist effort would be made in
 the elections and was accord-
 ingly alarmed when informed in
 early May that nearly 150 mem-
 bers of the party were submit-
 ting applications.  The result
 was his decree of 10 May dis-
 qualifying as candidate any
 individual ever subjected to the
 regime's "administrative cus-
 tody."  The broad interpretation
 given this decree eliminated any-
 one who had been arrested, con-
 fined to residence, or even
 held under police surveillance.
 The Communists have de-
 cided to back leftists and
 fellow travelers, and it is un-
 likely that the regime has been
 able to weed out such elements
 entirely, or to tag all the
 lesser-known Communists not
 affected by the decree.
 A long-time enemy,  the
 extreme rightist Moslem Brother-
 hood, has renewed its terrorist
 activities, exploiting the grow-
 ing discontent of the Egyptian
 public with Nasr's highhanded
 tactics.  However, aside from
 its nuisance value, the Brother-
 hood is not. likely to give the
 regime any serious difficulty.
 Its methods and history are now
 distasteful to too many Egypt-
 ians for it to regain much pop-
 ular support.
 The only other organized
 opposition in Egypt today is
 the remnant of the once dominant
 Wafdist party.   The regime has
 done an effective jot over the
 years of destroying the party
 by both propaganda and more
 stringent techniques, including
 arrests early this year.   Many
 leaders of this former grass-
 roots party have been discred-
 ited as enemies of the revolu-
 tion and therefore of the people.
 A victory at the polls thus
 seems assured for the regime,

 but its prestige has been harmed
 by the manner in which all op-
 position has been suppressed.
 On the other hand,  the election
 has brought many enemies into
 the open where the regime can
 deal with them, perhaps per-
 manently, and the security
 gained by the elimination of
 these sources of danger may
 outweigh and outlast the loss
 of prestige.
 A number of public state-
 ments by Soviet authorities
 concerning earth satellites
 suggest that the USSR intends
 to launch an earth satellite
 soon, possibly in the early
 phases of the  International
 Geophysical Year (IGY) which
 begins on 1 July.   This program,
 though it is of major propor-
 tions, probably will not inter-
 fere seriously with the long-
 range ballistic missile effort.
 A. N. Nesmeyanov, presi-
 dent of the Soviet Academy of
 Sciences, reported in Komsomol
 Pravda on 9 June that the USSR
 wouldrlaunch its first earth
 satellite "within the next few
 months."  He was reported in the
 Soviet press a week earlier to
 have stated that the USSR now
 has the "necessary instruments
 and equipment to aid in solving
 the problem."  However, official
 Soviet announcements at the
 Brussels conference (15-20 June)
 regarding IGY rocket and earth
 satellite plans revealed nothing
 new.
 In September 1955, Khru-
 shchev openly boasted that the
 USSR was ahead of the United
 States in preparations for space
 satellites.   Soviet scientists,
 on the other hand, have char-
 acteristically been cautious
 about giving information or mak-
 ing official claims of leader-
 ship in the race to produce the
 first successful satellite.
 Knowing that the probabili-
 ty of failure of a particular
 launching is approximately 50
 percent, it is possible that
 the USSR will announce a launch-
 ing only after it has taken
 place.   Timing of the announce-
 ment may be influenced by a de-
 sire not to reveal prematurely
 any information from which de-
 ductions might be made regarding
 military missile capabilities..
 Since the USSR has committed
 itself publicly to launching an
 earth satellite within the next
 few months and is well aware
 of the psychological and politi-
 cal advantages of a "first" in
 this field, a major effort on
 its part toward this end is ex-
 The USSR probably has the
 capability of orbiting an earth
 satellite in 1957.   It would
 be desirable though not manda-
 tory to orbit a satellite with-
 in a week before or after the
 solstice period,  about 21 June
 or 21 December, to enable bet-
 ter observation of th   atel-
 lite at dawn and dusk.

 the modern units were transferred

 sequently will not be suffi-
 cient to make up for the 1956
 failures and provide the addi-
 tions to new capacity origi-

 Even if the 1957 construction

 28 percent of the additions to
 crude steel capacity scheduled
 in the five-year plan will be

 first two years of the plan.
 For pig iron and rolled metal,
 only 18 and 16 percent will
 be completed, respectively.
 This slowdown in expand-

 Five-Year Plan over-all indus-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 8 June when he declared at an
 activists' meeting that the
 party reorganization was being
 hampered by intrigues and per-
 sonal strife in many places.
 Obviously responding to com-
 plaints from party members who
 fear implementation of a harsher
 line, Marosan denied that a
 "neo-Stalinist putsch" was
 under way within the party.   He
 admitted, however, that some
 functionaries who were high
 officials in the prerevolution-
 ary party and government were
 not satisfied with their present
 positions, but he denied that
 their dissatisfaction involved
 any ideological differences.
 Further warnings against
 "personal quarrels" were voiced
 in a 23 June article by old-
 line Communist Karoly Kiss,
 politburo member and party sec-
 retary.   Kiss, who may represent
 the neo-Stalinist wing of the
 party at the politburo level,
 revealed that unjustified accu-
 sations by minor functionaries
 against "honest and devoted
 comrades" are causing concern
 among party leaders.
 A major dispute appears to
 be raging over the treatment
 of intellectuals.   Marosan,
 modifying his earlier attitude
 toward writers and journalists,
 on 8 June denied that the party
 was anti-intellectual but admit-
 ted that "on a few occasions we
 have dealt rather summarily
 with intellectuals."  This ap-
 parent change of position--
 reportedly the result of the
 urging of a visiting French
 Communist delegation--has earned-
 for Marosan the enmity of hard-
 line party members who rebutted
 his position on intellectuals
 in a parliamentary address and
 lampooned his change of heart
 in a cartoon in the party daily
 on 11 June.
 In any case, on the eve
 of the national conference, the
 hard line toward intellectuals
 was in the ascendant.   The party
 organization in Hungary's
 leading law faculty was dis-
 solved on 14 June and a purge
 appears to be under way in the
 country's educational system.
 Regime spokesmen, however, are
 still making gestures toward
 the so-called technical intel-
 ligentsia, on whom the regime
 depends for the implementation
 of its economic program.
 The party may also be in-
 volved in a dispute over the
 proper way to handle Nagyists
 and minority party figures who
 were active during the revolu-
 tion.
 The regime in late
 May arrested Zoltan Tildy,
 former Smallholders Party leader
 and a Nagy cohort, but now re-
 portedly has released him; on
 the other hand, it recently
 arrested another revolutionary,
 Peasant Party leader Istvan
 Bibo, who apparently is to be
 brought to trial.   The final
 decision concerning such trials,
 however, will undoubtedly come
 from the Kremlin.
 Kadar appears to have
 little control over the provin-
 cial organization of the party
 in which old-line Communists
 who disappeared during the
 revolution are re-emerging as
 local party officials.   In
 addition, other Rakosi regime
 Communists have recently been
 appointed to parliamentary
 committees and presumably have
 high hopes of regaining top-
 level party jobs.
 Kadar is increasingly
 forced to rely on the neo-Stalin-
 ists--despite their threat to
 his continued retention of power
 --because he cannot afford to
 risk co-operation with remain-
 ing "revisionists," whose more
 liberalistic tendencies threaten
 his basic policies.  The Kremlin
 probably is sympathetic to in-
 creased participation of the
 neo-Stalinists in the ruling
 circle.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 GOMULKA'S VIEWS DOMINATE POLISH-EAST GERMAN COMMUNIQUES
 The views of Polish party
 leader Gomulka on proper rela-
 tions between Communist states
 dominated the         communiques
 issued in East Berlin on 21 June
 at the conclusion of Gomulka's
 visit to East Germany.   Although
 an East German-Polish inodus
 vivendi was reached in which
 the Germans recognize many Pol-
 ish ideas on relations within
 the "commonwealth" of Communist
 nations,  basic differences be-
 tween Gomulka's party and the
 East German leaders remain un-
 resolved.
 The party communique de-
 clared that party relations must
 be based on equal rights and
 mutual respect of sovereignty,
 and the East German Socialist
 Unity Party (SED) endorsed the
 effective efforts of the Polish
 United Workers' Party (PZPR) in
 Poland's program since October.
 Although adherence to  basic
 principles of Communism was
 pledged, the two parties recog-
 nized that historic conditions
 and national characteristics
 may determine various forms and
 methods of approach in different
 countries.
 Going even further, the
 East German leaders agreed to
 the equality of the Soviet Com-
 munist Party, the Communist
 Party of China--"whose signifi-
 cance goes far beyond the con-
 tinent of Asia"--and all Com-
 munist and workers' parties
 in constituting a common pool
 of thought and experience for
 the working class movement.
 Although somewhat more
 restrained in tone than the
 party pronouncement,  the gov-
 ernment communique was more
 typical of Satellite documents,
 agreeing to major points of
 Soviet foreign policy, and
 particularly emphasizing mat-
 ters of primary interest to East
 Germany and Poland, such as the
 Oder-Neisse line and nuclear
 armaments in West Germany.
 The agreement supported
 the creation of a zone of re-
 duced armament in Europe to in-
 clude both Germanies and the
 territory of several of their
 neighbors.   It favored the es-
 tablishment of an understanding
 with the Baltic states for a
 "Baltic sea of peace," declared
 a readiness to strengthen the
 Warsaw pact,  and announced that
 consular and customs agreements
 would be concluded.   A reference
 to Poland's desire for better
 relations with West Germany was
 also included.
 Gomulka,  in his first trip
 to any Satellite, and the Polish
 delegation received a distinctly
 cool reception in East Germany.
 No mass greeting committee was
 organized, and none of the top
 East German leaders accompanied
 the Polish leaders in their ex-
 cursions to the countryside.
 The controlled East German press
 distorted much of the content
 of the meetings by eliminating
 Polish references to the desire
 for friendship with the West
 Germans and to the equality of
 China with the USSR.
 East German workers, how-
 ever, proved more friendly than
 those in Czechoslovakia,  accord-
 ing to a reported comment of
 Polish premier Cyrankiewicz,  a
 fact which he privately ascribed
 to the unpopularity of Ulbricht's
 regime rather than genuine friend-
 liness toward Poland.

 The Communist regime in
 Czechoslovakia, in a resolution
 at the 13-14 June central com-
 mittee meeting on ideological
 problems, reaffirmed  Czecho-
 slovakia's conservative posi-
 tion on Communist interrela-
 tionships and internal politi-
 cal questions.
 The Czech regime used this
 occasion to make its first of-
 ficial party statement on the
 Mao "many flowers'- thesis.
 The Czech resolution stated
 that while the Chinese theory
 was valid for the Chinese situ-
 ation and the anti-imperialist
 struggles in Africa and Asia,
 the strategy was inapplicable
 to Czechoslovakia,where the
 regime is engaged in combating
 full-scale imperialist espion-
 age and subversion.   Subse-
 quently the authorized version
 of Mao's February speech treat-
 ing in detail the "many flowers"
 thesis was published in the
 official Czech press on 21 June,
 the first such appearance in
 any European Satellite news-
 paper.   The Czechs have issued
 no new internal comment on the
 meaning of the speech for
 Czechoslovakia.
 Perhaps the most signifi-
 cant part of the Czech resolu-
 tion was a call for "multipar-
 tite discussion of important
 political and ideological ques
 tions" and for a new interna-
 tional Communist theoretical
 and political journal.   The re-
 establishment of a Cominform-
 type journal has often been
 rumored,and the American em-
 bassy believes it may be an-
 nounced during Khrushchev's
 visit to Prague, reportedly
 scheduled for early July.   The
 resolution did not specify
 what organization might sponsor
 the journal, but the Czechs
 may contemplate sponsorship
 through international Communist
 Party conferences, as they have
 suggested, rather than by a for-
 mal Cominform-type organization.
 In discussing internal
 ideological and party problems,
 the resolution admitted that
 some revisionist tendencies
 existed and recommended that
 ideological weaknesses among
 workers, students, and literary
 elements be corrected.   Party

 major policy speech at the cen-
 tral committee meeting noted
 that important strata among the
 Czech intelligentsia and even
 workers are susceptible to
 Western-sponsored subversive
 concepts, notably revisionism,
 "national Communism" and "peo-
 ple's capitalism."  Revisionism,
 hitherto underestimated, was
 singled out as the main danger
 to the international Communist
 movement.
 In its references to the
 repressive measures to be taken
 against the intelligentsia, the
 regime revealed the difficulty
 it had experienced in attempt-
 ing to enforce ideological con-
 formity.   Henceforth, "Socialist
 realism" is to be unquestioned,
 erroneous ideas are to be curbed,
 and speeches or articles which
 advocate an opposing policy to
 that of the regime are to be
 forbidden.
 This restatement of Prague's
 ideological position probably
 was motivated by a desire to
 publicize this "model Satel-
 lite's" rigidly orthodox posi-
 tion prior to Khrushchev's forth-
 coming visit.   Since it was just
 a year ago that the Czech "hard"
 line was first detailed, the
 regime may have felt that a re-
 statement of its intention to
 hold the line at the present

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY .SUMMARY
 27 June 1957
 POLES REVISE FIVE-YEAR PLAN
 A revised five-year plan
 for 1956-60 was presented to
 the Polish parliament on 18
 June.   Circumstances under
 which the revisions were made
 suggest that the new plan is
 intended mainly to preserve
 the appearance of bloc unanim-
 ity rather than provide a firm
 framework for Poland's economic
 future.  Although more realis-
 tic than the original plan,
 its lack of detail shows clear-
 ly that it is not sacrosanct
 and may be revised or ignored
 when expedient.
 The major tenets of the
 new five-year plan are a real
 improvement in the standard of
 living and a restoration of the
 balance between the branches
 of the economy.   To accomplish
 these aims, industrial produc-
 tion now is scheduled to rise
 49 percent over 1955 instead
 of the 53-57 percent originally
 planned.   Investments are be-
 ing further cut back and lesser
 sums are allocated to capital
 goods, the production of which
 is to increase 50 percent.
 Consumer goods output is to
 rise 47 percent, not including
 the output of small and pri-
 vate producers which has re-
 cently been given a renewed
 impetus.   The original plan
 did not state the goals for an
 increase in consumer goods pro-
 duction.
 The new plan promises much
 less improvement in living con-
 ditions than the Polish people
 are demanding.   The projected
 30-percent rise in living
 standards over the five-year
 period is a modest goal,
 although even this will prob-
 ably be very difficult to real-
 ize.                                                       A 27-percent rise in
 workers' wages during 1956 has
 been negated in large part by
 inflation.   Increased imports
 and production of consumer goods
 are not likely to bring about
 appreciable improvement soon.
 The provisions in the
 draft five-year plan presented
 at the seventh party plenum
 following the Poznan riots were
 so little related to Polish
 economic capabilities and the
 real needs of the Polish people
 that, after Gomulka came to
 power, the plan was withdrawn
 and abandonment of the five-
 year plan system was considered.
 The official party paper ex-
 plained in mid-November that
 the plan had been prepared un-
 der conditions of "undue opti-
 mism" and contained a number of
 provisions which were not suited
 to the Gomulka program; it added
 that a five-year plan for 1956-
 60 was of "dubious importance"
 anyway.
 Adoption of a new five-
 year plan at this time despite
 these reservations preserves
 Poland's conformity with stand-
 ard practice among bloc coun-
 tries.   Its tentative nature,
 however, is readily admitted
 by the regime:   "In our present
 situation... the five-year plan
 bill has a schematic, character.
 In current production and in
 investments, it is of a transi-
 tory nature and adaptable to
 +he current       mic program."

 to dissolve the Chamber of De-
 puties and call national elec-
 tions, probably for October.
 Developments over the past
 few weeks have indicated that
 no parliamentary majority ex-
 ists for Zoli's program as a
 whole.   Although he was origi-
 nally confirmed with the votes
 of rightist parties seeking to
 end their political isolation,
 these parties are unlikely to
 vote for the proposed laws to
 regulate farm contracts and to
 set up regional assemblies.
 Moreover, the attempt last week
 by Christian Democratic Party
 secretary Fanfani to reconsti-
 tute the old coalition failed
 because the small center par-
 ties balked at his repetition
 of Zoli's program.
 Zoli probably will not en-
 counter much opposition to a
 measure for provisional exten-
 sion of government appropria-
 tions which would otherwise ex-
 pire on 30 June.  A majority
 also seems to exist for ratifi-
 cation of the Common Market and
 EURATOM treaties.   The first
 controversial legislative pro-
 posal to come up, however, is
 likely to lead to a new impasse.
 President Gronchi reportedly is
 still reluctant to use his power
 to dissolve the Chamber of Depu-
 ties before the expiration of
 its legal term next spring, but
 he would probably give in to
 strong pressure for October
 elections from the Christian
 Democratic Party if parliamen-
 tary developments seemed to

 The French National Assem-

 ures it had earlier refused
 former premier Mollet.makes it
 possible for Premier Bourges-
 Maunoury to seek ratification
 of the EURATOM and Common Mar-
 ket treaties before the summer
 recess.   Since major financial
 difficulties are still ahead
 and division is growing in
 France over Algerian policy,
 there is no assurance that his
 government will long survive.
 Bourges-Maunoury still
 has to deal with France's
 chronic balance-of-trade defi-
 cit and depleted gold and for-
 eign exchange holdings.  On 17
 June, the government reimposed
 quantitative restrictions on
 imports to counter the trade
 imbalance and will probably
 have to tap the Bank of France's
 gold reserves next month.   An-
 ticipated further steps include
 requests for loans from the
 International Monetary Fund, the
 West German government and the
 United States, as well as re-
 newed efforts to hold down the
 cost of living.
 Growing domestic opposi-
 tion to the Lacoste pacifica-
 tion program in Algeria may be-
 come a major problem for the
 cabinet.   Bourges-Maunoury has
 promised to speed legislation
 establishing a new Algerian
 political framework and prob-
 ably hopes by such an approach
 to mollify opponents of pacifi-
 cation without incurring the
 wrath of die-hard French na-
 tionalists.  All French politi-
 cal parties, save the Communists
 and Poujadists, are divided in
 some measure on Algerian policy,
 but as yet most French politi-
 cal leaders still fear to op-
 pose openly the Lacoste thesis
 that Algeria can be held mainly
 by military means.

 The press is becoming more
 critical, however, and the
 Socialist Party's national
 congress which opened on 27 June
 may reveal increasing pressure
 for a federal relationship be-

 reports that the Algerian nation-

 two leaders only recently sub-
 merged their differences to
 unite in favoring a firm policy
 toward the Pathet Lao, and there
 have already been several in-
 dications that their rapproche-

 Bong's chances of winning
 the necessary two-third's assem-

 though he can be expected to
 make a persuasive appeal for a
 neutralist foreign policy and
 an immediate settlement with
 the Pathet Lao.   While Bong
 will presumably be supported
 by the small National Union and
 Democrat Parties, he is unlike-

 Parties, either of which has
 sufficient representation in

 appears probable, the crown
 prince may designate either
 Katay, Phoui or outgoing prime
 minister Souvanna Phouma as
 cabinet formateur.  The latter's
 prospects have materially im-
 proved with the defeat of
 Katay last week, and the presi-
 dent of the National Assembly
 has indicated that the assembly
 would be disposed to accept a
 Souvanna Phouma government with
 Katay and Phoui as principal
 lieutenants.   Such a government
 would probably suffer from
 serious internal stresses be-
 cause of the dissimilarity of
 views of its leaders on the
 Pathet Lao issue.
 Municipal elections in
 Djakarta on 22 June   revealed
 a substantial growth of Commun-
 ist strength.   Although the
 anti-Communist Masjumi won a
 plurality as it did in the na-
 tional elections of 1955, it ran
 only 19,000 votes ahead of the
 Communists, who in 1955 had run
 a poor fourth.  The National
 Party and the Nahdlatul Ulama
 (NU) fell from second and third
 places, respectively, in 1955
 to third and fourth.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 June 1957
 Elections throughout the
 remainder of Java are scheduled
 for the near future.   The Com-
 munists polled a strong second
 place in both East and Central
 Java in 1955 and probably will
 do'at least as well again this
 year.   Provincial leaders of
 the National Party and the NU
 have voiced more concern over
 the Communist threat than their
 national leaders in Djakarta,
 but there is little indication
 they have undertaken effective
 action to counter the vigorous
 and well-financed campaigning
 of the Communists.
 President Sukarno has an-
 nounced that his national ad-
 visory council will be installed
 as soon as all 45 seats are
 filled.  A certain amount of
 reshuffling is under way, since
 several individuals have re-
 jected their appointments, sev-
 eral have accepted condition-
 ally, and some have been with-
 drawn by sponsoring organiza-
 tions.   Such changes will, if
 anything, strengthen the coun-
 cil's leftist orientation.
 In an effort to remedy the
 central government's deteriorat-
 ing economic situation, the
 prime minister on 20 June an-
 nounced adjustments in import-
 export regulations which permit
 the sale of foreign exchange ac-
 cording to prevailing market
 rates rather than at an official
 fixed rate.   The regulations
 amount to a devaluation of the
 rupiah and will chiefly benefit
 exporters.   Many Indonesians in
 non-Javanese areas have avoided
 paying government revenues by
 setting up an advantageous bar-
 ter trade, and the new regula-
 tions will probably offer little
 inducement for them to re ume
 official trade channels.
 The field of candidates
 for the November Philippine
 presidential election is nar-
 rowing as both major parties
 prepare to hold nominating con-
 ventions in July.   Several
 ranking aspirants in the ruling
 Nacionalista Party have an-
 nounced their intentions to
 withdraw from the race and back
 the re-election of President
 Garcia.  The failure of all con-
 tenders to withdraw, however,
 has left open the possibility
 that such pledges may not be
 honored at the party's conven-
 tion, now scheduled for 27-28
 July.
 A move to abandon Garcia
 could develop if Manila's Mayor

 hopeful, carries out a threat
 to present on the convention
 floor a documented "expose" of
 President Garcia's involvement
 in corruption.
 Nacionalista Party presi-
 dent Rodriguez' comment that
 Lacson's charges would have
 little effect on Garcia's pros-
 pects suggests that Garcia may
 have agreed to concessions to
 gain the support of party lead-
 ers.   Currently, there are pros-
 pects that a Garcia-Laurel Jr.
 slate may be presented to the
 convention as the considered
 choice of the party leadership.
 The Nacionalistas, however,
 have not only failed to resolve
 fully the internal conflicts
 among rival presidential and
 vice-presidential nominees, but
 remain divided over selection
 of candidates for the Senate
 and the House of Representatives.
 Furthermore, the continued in-
 dependent presidential candidacy
 of Senator Claro Recto offers
 a threat to the Nacionalistas,
 as it provides a haven for those
 who lose out in the nominating
 procedure.   In this connection,
 both Lacson and "sugar bloc"
 politician Senator Fernando
 Lopez--as a result of Garcia's
 last-minute veto of legislation
 favorable to export interests--
 are reported making gestures
 of support to Recto.
 The opposition Liberal Par-
 ty continues to express optimism
 over the election prospects of
 its probable presidential and
 vice-presidential candidates,
 prewar Speaker of the House
 Jose Yulo and Congressman
 Diosdado Macapagal.  The Liber-
 als are concerned, however, over
 the congressional race, since
 they hold at present no seats
 in the Senate and only 35 of the
 104 seats in the House.
 The party is reluctant to
 run several of its ranking mem-
 bers, who are popularly identi-
 fied with the corruption of the
 former Quirino administration,
 and hopes to include on its
 senatorial slate members of the
 new Progressive Party, formed
 by politicians close to the late
 president Magsaysay.  The Liber-
 als' convention, originally
 planned for June, has been post-
 poned to mid-July so that nego-
 tiations with the Progressives
 might continue.
 The Progressives have lost
 considerable bargaining power
 by the failure of their most
 likely presidential candidate,
 Manual Manahan, to attract popu-
 lar support.   Furthermore, sev-
 eral officials close to Magsaysay
 have remained loyal to President
 Garcia and the Nacionalista
 Party.   Indications are that
 the Progressive Party will be
 unable to arrange a favorable
 coalition and may gradually fade
 out of the political picture.
 Some prominent Progressives are
 reportedly already prepared to
 abandon the new party and af-
 filiate individually with the
 Liberals.

 spread violence in Ceylon is

 descent to achieve Ceylonese
 citizenship and recognition of
 their Tamil tongue as a Ceylon-
 ese national language, has ad-
 vanced four demands which it
 says must be met if the civil
 disobedience program is to be
 canceled.  These are a federal
 autonomous state in northern
 Ceylon, citizenship rights for
 all residents of Indian descent,
 parity of Tamil with Sinhalese
 as a national language, and a
 promise that the Tamil area will
 not be colonized by Sinhalese.
 Prime Minister Bandaranaike
 is seriously perturbed over the
 possibility of violence created
 by the Tamils, who comprise 2,-
 000,000 of the island's 8,500,-
 000 population.   He plans to
 mobilize all police and active
 reserve units of the armed forces
 by early August.   He has also
 considered formation of a volun-
 teer force of 100,000 members
 of his Sri Lanka Freedom Party
 to help keep the peace, but this
 idea has met violent opposition
 from all sides.   In addition,
 the government has banned the
 sale of firearms and forbidden
 foreign travel, without special
 clearance.
 On the other hand, Bandara-
 naike has attempted to pacify
 the Tamils by offering them con-
 cessions, including the right
 of Tamil children to be educated
 in their mother tongue, estab-
 lishment of a reasonable period
 for Tamil-speaking public serv-
 Ceylonese Basic Linguistic Divisions
 ants to learn Sinhalese,
 and the right of local
 administrations to
 conduct business in the
 Tamil language if they
 wish.
 The Tamils remain
 unsatisfied.   In early
 June, Federal Party
 demonstrators stoned
 government ministers
 touring northern Ceylon
 in an effort to explain
 the government's posi-
 tion.   On 13 June,
 Federal Party members
 walked out of the open-
 ing meeting of parlia-
 ment when the governor
 general began an ad-
 dress in Sinhalese.

 Simultaneously,
 Buddhist extremist
 elements have indulged
 in violence in protest
 against Bandaranaike's

 of Tamil in Ceylon.

 most effective pro-Communist
 leaders in Pakistan,  an alliance
 of leftist parties is taking
 shape which could emerge as a
 distinct threat to Pakistan's
 present leadership during the
 national elections scheduled
 for next spring.   The Communist-
 dominated Pakistan National
 Party (PNP),  in the forefront
 of this movement,  has been fast
 developing as a mass organiza-,
 tion in sections of West Paki-
 stan.   Recent political develop-
 ments in East Pakistan indicate
 the PNP soon may emerge as the
 instrument for unifying pro-
 Communist groups in both prov-
 inces into a single opposition.
 The Communist Party of
 Pakistan, small in numbers and
 weakened by chronic factional-
 ism, has been outlawed since
 July 1954 and operates primarily
 through front parties and
 through infiltration of estab-
 lished political organizations.
 The most effective service in
 the Communist cause has long
 been performed by pro-Communist
 Mian Iftikhar-ud-Din, wealthy
 publisher of the Pakistan Times
 papers which regularly follow
 the Communist line.   Late in
 1956,  Iftikhar-ud-Din's Commu-
 nist-front Azad Pakistan Party,
 never a real force in Pakistani
 politics, merged with five
 other small provincially ori-
 ented parties in West Pakistan
 to form the PNP.
 During the past five months,
 the new party reportedly has
 been gaining strength rapidly
 in the Northwest Frontier area.
 The success of its program de-
 rives largely from the popular
 appeal of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,
 widely known for his pro-Push-
 toonistan activities, who has
 assumed nominal leadership of
 the Frontier PNP.   The main
 themes stressed by the PNP in
 West Pakistan are abolition of
 the one-unit system,  the arrange-
 ment under which West Pakistan's
 six provinces were merged in
 1955 into a single administrative
 unit,  and "the new American im-
 perialism."

 the nucleus of a leftist mass

 present leadership.   Talks be-
 tween Bhashani and Iftikhar-
 ud-Din in Dacca on 15-17 June
 resulted in an announcement that
 an all-party convention would
 meet on 25 July to  consider
 mutual problems and the possible
 formation of a new national
 leftist party,
 The PNP in West Pakistan
 and Communist-front elements in
 East Pakistan agree on the prime
 issues of regional autonomy and
 anti-Western foreign policy.
 An election campaign sparked by
 Ghaffar Khan and Bhashani,two
 of the most effective mass lead-
 ers in Pakistan,  would be like-
 ly to attract considerable sup-
 port from the electorate if
 leftist politicians in both
 provinces submerge their dif-
 ferences and personal rivalries
 and agree on a national program.
 Pro-Communist Mayor Kame-
 jiro Senaga of Naha, Okinawa,
 has begun a vigorous campaign
 on behalf of leftist candidates
 for the city assembly which is
 designed to forestall his ul-
 timate removal from office.
 His conservative opponents must
 win at least 20 of the 30 seats
 in the election scheduled for
 4 August to assure a second no-
 confidence vote against the
 mayor by the new assembly.
 Senaga dissolved the city
 assembly on 18 June and opened
 his campaign the next day in a
 speech to a captive audience
 of city workers in which he
 threatened strong action against
 any employee supporting the
 conservative opposition.   In
 addition to using the city or-
 ganization in the campaign,  the
 mayor can be expected to ex-
 ploit appointments to lucrative
 posts in city-operated busies
 nesses.
 Senaga will pose as the
 champion of Okinawan grievances
 against the United States, em-
 phasizing such popular issues
 as reversion to Japan and op-
 position to the acquisition of
 land by American forces.   To
 cover his vulnerability on the
 present inactivity in city con-
 struction, caused by refusal
 of banks to loan money to the
 pro-Communist administration,
 he is seeking funds to resume
 the building of a port terminal
 building.
 The initial elation of the
 anti-Senaga forces over their
 success in passing a no-confi-
 dence motion on 17 June is fad-
 ing.                                                       Their campaign is being

 The biennial congress of
 the Socialist Internationals-_meeting at Vienna on 1-5 July,
 is expected to pass strong reso-
 lutions condemning Soviet actions
 in Hungary  and nuclear weapon's
 testing; it will face internal
 differences on colonialism and
 various other international
 questions.  The congress, whose
 constituent parties represent
 a substantial proportion of the
 Western European electorate,
 will also be attended by Japa-
 nese and other Asian delegations.
 Conference Issues
 The International has re-
 peatedly gone on record as re-
 buffing Communist overtures
 for unity of action
 on either the inter-
 national or local
 level, and the fifth
 congress is expected
 to reaffirm this
 stand.   Virtual un-
 animity is antici-
 pated on a resolution
 condemning Soviet ac-
 tions in Hungary.

 special attention to this ques-
 tion in recent months, particu-
 larly since Dr. Schweitzer's
 appeal for a ban on testing. A
 number of them, such as the
 powerful West German and Brit-
 ish parties, have used the sub-
 ject in one way or another as
 a domestic political issue.
 The congress may also be further
 influenced by the Japanese par-
 ty, which reportedly is sending
 an unusually large delegation.
 It is expected that the
 congress will pass a strong
 .,-further nuclear weapons tests
 and institution of strict con-
 trols over nuclear armament.
 There may also be a tendency to
 give added emphasis to the is-
 sue as providing an area of
 agreement between parties split
 on other issues and as a bridge
 between European and Asian
 opinion.
 Divisions are likely on
 the question of Western Europe's
 relations with other parts of
 the world.   Asian socialists
 will seek recognition of colonial
 problems and will try to obtain
 the International's support for
 ultimate liberation of the re-
 maining colonies.   On the other

 to make a major address on Ger-
 man unification, reiterating
 his standard attack on Bonn's
 military alliance with the West
 and proposing his own plan for
 a collective European security
 system to include all of Ger-
 many, along with its neighbors
 to the East and West, under
 a mutual nonaggression pact.
 There will be considerable
 sentiment at the congress for
 such a plan as well as for
 establishing a central European
 neutral area.  Hugh Gaitskell,
 leader of the British Labor
 Party, will probably reiterate
 his recent proposal for such a
 belt.
 The establishment of party
 relations with Poland and Yugo-
 slavia will reportedly be rec-
 commended by the Norwegian,
 Labor Party.   Feelers from War-
 saw to a Dutch Socialist leader
 were reported last fall and
 the question of ties with Tito's
 party has been raised on various
 occasions.  A number of Social-
 ist party delegations have
 visited Yugoslavia since the
 1955 congress and the consensus
 appears to oppose establishing
 permanent relations.
 The importance of the con-
 gress lies largely in the in-
 fluence its discussions will
 have on the views, held by the
 member parties and, through
 them, on European public opinion
 generally.   Most of the European
 parties are either present mem-
 bers of coalition governments
 or,  like the British and West
 German parties,  strong con-
 tenders for power.
 The International has no
 mandatory powers over the na-
 tional parties; its purpose is
 officially defined as merely
 "to strengthen relations between
 the affiliated parties and to
 co-ordinate their political at-
 titudes by consent."  It does,
 nevertheless, have considerable
 prestige in socialist circles.
 Considering itself a lineal
 descendent of the Second Inter-
 national of 1889, it received
 its present organizational form
 at a July 1951 congress in Frank-
 furt when the Western European
 socialists finally gave up
 their hope that it might prove
 possible to co-operate with the
 Communist and Socialist parties
 of the Eastern European states.
 It has given general guidance
 to the development of postwar
 democratic socialism, particu-
 larly to the weaker parties,
 and has focused international
 attention on the achievements
 of individual parties.
 Within limits, moreover,
 the International can exercise
 a direct influence on socialists
 in a particular country through
 its power of deciding which of
 two rival parties it will admit
 to membership.   In the past
 decade this leverage has been
 used to smooth over rivalries
 between factions in several
 countries, and within the past
 year the International has made
 various efforts toward bridging
 the long-standing gap between its
 Italian member party,  the Demo-
 cratic Socialists, and the
 Nenni Socialists.   A commission
 of the International is to re-
 port on this question at the
 congress, but no definitive ac-
 tion is expected--in part be-
 cause of strong reservations
 within the International re-
 garding the Nenni party's rela-
 tions with the Communists and
 to an even greater extent be-
 cause of recent developments in
 Italy.
 Some thought may also be
 given to reconciling the two
 factions within the Finnish
 Social Democratic Party, whose
 rivalry forced the party's with-
 drawal from the government in
 mid-May.   The split could lead
 to the Finnish Communists' ob-
 taining some support from dis-
 gruntled radical Social Democrats.

 tion with the various socialist

 organizations of Western Europe,
 the International also has ties
 with similarly minded bodies in
 the rest of the world.   It
 maintains close liaison with
 the Asian Socialist Conference.
 The Social Democratic Party of
 Japan and Israel's labor party,
 the Mapai, are full members of
 the International as well as
 of the Asian Socialist Confer-
 ence.   The Praja Socialists of
 India and the Pan-Malayan Labor
 Party have permanent observer
 status at the International, and
 a number of other Asian parties
 are scheduled to send observers
 to the Vienna congress.
 Arab world are also quite limited.
 Despite such efforts to
 promote democratic socialism
 in non-European areas, however,
 the International's effective
 influence on national policies
 remains largely confined to
 Western Europe.   Its contacts.
 with Eastern Europe are limited
 largely to recognition of.the
 Eastern European Socialist
 parties in exile.   With Africa,
 it maintains only an indirect
 link through the French So-

 the African Socialist Movement,

 The Afghan government is
 dissatisfied with the high
 prices the USSR is charging for
 economic development work under
 the $100,000,000 Soviet credit.
 Afghan leaders, while reluctant
 to abandon their hopes for
 rapid economic development
 through the use of Soviet aid,
 apparently are exploring alter-
 native sources of funds.   This
 development comes at a time when
 West Germany,  Pakistan, and the
 United States are moving to ex-
 pand their roles in Afghanistan.
 Afghan leaders may delay in-
 definitely construction work on
 some Soviet projects.   Kabul
 might even turn over to other
 countries some of the projects,
 or portions thereof,  previously
 alloted to the USSR, just as it
 earlier turned over to the Rus-
 sians responsibility for certain
 projects previously surveyed by
 West Germans.
 When the USSR opened its
 economic offensive in Afghanistan
 in 1954, it undertook some proj-
 ects which would have an im-
 mediate,  dramatic impact, as
 well as some which had long-
 range economic value.   A bakery-
 silo complex, petroleum storage
 tanks, and street-paving in
 Kabul all were built on terms
 generally satisfactory to Afghan-
 istan.   Therefore, when Bulganin
 and Khrushchev during their
 December 1955 visit offered a
 $100,000,000 loan at only 2-per-
 cent interest and with deferred
 payment terms, the Afghans pre-
 sumably thought they were obtain-
 ing another advantageous arrange-
 ment.
 Both countries quickly
 reached agreement in principle
 on 19 major projects the USSR
 was to construct under the new
 loan.   The USSR Gent technicians
 and equipment to survey most of
 the projects in the summer of
 1956,   Although in a few cases
 there is still no information
 that surveys have been either
 started or completed, in most
 instances, both preliminary

 engineering and cost surveys
 were finished by last fall or

 was accomplished during the
 winter months because of roads
 blocked by snow or mud.
 'High Costs :and Delays in .Work
 Despite Afghan requests
 that.the USSR proceed on .,the--
 basis of-previous West German
 surveys of some Hof the projects,
 the Russians insisted on doing
 new surveys before they would
 undertake any work.   The Afghans
 reportedly are dismayed by the
 prices charged by the Soviet
 Union for survey and construc-
 tion work,  Soviet prices being
 much higher than those charged
 by the Germans.   In one ex-
 treme case, that of the Pul-i-
 khumri hydroelectric project,
 the USSR reportedly charged
 $135,000 for a survey done
 earlier by the Germans for $8,-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The Afghans are concerned
 that most of the $8,000,000 or
 more expended by the end of 1956
 has gone for surveys and serv-
 ices rather than for construc-
 tion.   They have been especial-
 ly concerned over the $6,200,-
 000 price tag originally placed
 on the reconstruction of the
 Kabul airport.  After long ne-
 gotiations, the USSR agreed to
 reduce the price to $5,700,000,
 still almost twice the price
 asked earlier by the Germans
 for nearly the same work.
 The Afghan Ministry of
 Public Works now has been
 ordered to obtain separate esti-
 mates from the USSR for  each
 component of the  project, and
 to undertake those parts which
 the ministry itself is competent
 to handle.   The ministry re-
 portedly plans to award the
 USSR a contract to build the
 runway and to stall on the re-
 mainder of the project in the
 hope that later it can get a
 different contractor to do the
 buildings.
 In addition,  following
 receipt of Soviet cost surveys,
 the Afghans are said to have
 decided to build the Jalalabad-
 Torkham road without Soviet aid
 and to reject the Kabul fertili-
 zer plant as too large for Af-
 ghan needs.
 Afghan Reaction
 Since the Afghans pride
 themselves on their bargaining
 skill,   the gradual realization
 that they are not receiving
 the better part of the bargain
 is apparently  galling them.
 They are reacting by seeking
 alternative sources of funds
 and technical aid from such
 countries as the United States
 and West Germany.
 Recent Afghan requests for
 American aid have included one
 for US petroleum companies to
 build storage facilities and to
 retail oil supplies in Afghan-
 istan.   There has also been in-
 tensified pressure on the United
 States to begin a program of
 railroad construction in the
 country.
 West German Offers
 Siemens has had extensive ex-
 perience there and recently com-
 pleted the first portion of the
 Sarobi hydroelectric project,
 which has more than doubled
 Afghanistan's generating capacity.
 Credit terms for future contracts
 between Afghanistan and Siemens
 reportedly were discussed.dur-.
 ing the visit of a West German
 economic delegation to Kabul in
 May.   These terms provide for
 Siemens to extend credit for an
 eight-year period for 75 percent
 of the cost of any project it
 undertakes.
 The West German delegation
 had been sent by a government
 committee newly organized in
 Bonn to aid semideveloped areas.
 The committee reportedly has
 about $12,000,000 available for
 technical assistance to Asian
 nations, of which about $1,200,-
 000 is earmarked for Afghanistan
 if a satisfactory arrangement
 can be achieved.   Bonn is pre-
 pared to establish an economic
 advisory committee in Kabul and
 supply teachers and equipment
 for a West German technical
 school as well as technicians in
 a number of specific fields.
 Although no definite agreement
 has been signed, the Afghan
 cabinet reportedly has approved

 acceptance of the program in
 principle.
 In addition, a West German
 economic commission reportedly
 is to visit Kabul this summer
 to offer a loan of approximately
 $14,000,000.  Although the loan
 is ostensibly to be from private
 German firms, 70 percent of it
 is to be backed by the Bonn
 government.   No  definite terms
 have been decided on, but pre-
 liminary information is that
 it will be an eight-year credit
 with the possibility of a five-
 year extension.
 Alternative Attractions
 .Afghanistan originally ac-
 cepted the Soviet $100,000,000
 loan shortly after experiencing
 an economic blockade by Pakistan
 and at a time when there ap-
 peared to be no other source
 than the USSR for large-scale
 economic assistance to build up
 Afghanistan rapidly and make it
 economically independent of
 Pakistan.   At present, Daud
 would be reluctant to admit that
 his policy of relying so heavily
 on the USSR was mistaken.  He
 would be equally reluctant, how-
 ever, to pay inflated prices
 SECRET
 for Soviet development projects
 if  he had West German or other
 Western offers from which to
 choose as well.   Negotiations
 now under way with West Germany,
 the United States, and Pakistan
 raise the possibility that in
 the near future Daud may have
 alternative attractions to use
 in bargaining with Moscow.
 Daud presumably would hesi-
 tate to antagonize the USSR,
 which is still his sole source
 for the arms he feels are neces-
 sary for modernizing Afghani-
 stan's armed forces.   If the
 USSR continues to charge such
 high prices, however, Daud might
 seriously consider delaying
 construction work on Soviet
 projects until he had thoroughly
 explored other possibilities.
 This he could do, since Kabul
 has signed few actual contracts
 with the USSR and therefore has
 not obligated the majority of
 the $100,000,000 loan funds.
 If other more attractive offers
 are made, Daud might turn cer-
 tain projects hitherto reserved
 for the U  R over     other
 on-
 tractors.
