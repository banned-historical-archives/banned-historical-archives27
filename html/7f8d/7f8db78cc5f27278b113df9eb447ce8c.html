 28 JUNE 1972
 INDOCHINA
 In addition to the continuing daily protests over U.S. air strikes
 from the spokesman of the DRV Foreign Ministry, a more authoritative
 foreign ministry statement on 26 June--the second such high-level
 protest this month--assailed strikes at Hanoi and Haiphong.  The
 statement and a flurry of press comment singled out alleged strikes
 at the dike system and irrigation works for special condemnation.
 At the same time, Hanoi's continuing concern with transportation
 problems was reflected in an article on the 26th which discussed
 problems in connection with the incorporation of "now forces" into
 the regular transportation and communications branch.  .
 Moscow has continued to press the line that its detente policy is
 not inconsistent with its support .'or Vietnam.  And Brezhnev,
 speaking at a 27 June banquet for Castro, was unusually forceful
 in promising support to the Vietnamese until "victory" and in
 condemning the U.S. "blockade" of DRV ports--an issue which had
 been avoided in the Soviet-U.S. joint communique on the President's
 visit.  Soviet propaganctlsts have continued to assail the United
 States for refusing to return to the Paris talks, insisting that
 peace can be achieved only at the conference table.
 The PRC and the DRV on 28 June signed another supplementary aid
 agreement, providing for the supply of "ordinary materlals" and a
 grant of "military equipment and material" to the Vietnamese.  There
 are indications, however, that `Le Chinese offered the aid less
 enthusiastically than on a comparable occasion at the time of the
 Lam Son 719 operation last year.  Also on the 28th, a PEOPLE'S DAILY
 Commentator article reaffirmed Chinese support for the war effort in
 seconding a series of foreign minis~ry statements by its Vietnamese
 allies.
 U,S, 25, 26 JUNE STRIKES PROMPT DRV 70REIGN MINISTRY PROTEST
 Following the 10 June DRV Foreign Ministry protest over U.S. air
 striker, Hanoi had reverted to the daily lower-level protests by
 the ministry spokesuan.  But on 26 June another foreign ministry
 statement protested action against Hanoi on that day and against
 Haiphong, among other targets, on the 25th.  The statement again
 underlined Hanoi's determ!.nation to continue the struggle, hat it
 differed from other high-level statements since the early-April
 escalation of the air war in its failure to mention support and

 assistance from the socialist countries.  Where the earlier
 protests had expressed gratitude and appealed to the socialist
 and other countries to continue efforts to stay the hand of
 the U.S. "aggressors,"* the current statement said:  "Despite
 the strong protest of the public opinion in the world and the
 United Sc,,tes, the Nixon Administration obdurately continues its
 frenzied and adventurous war escalation against the DRV.  This
 is an extremely gross encroachment upon the sovereignty and
 security of the DRV and an insolent challenge to the whole of
 progressive mankind."  By contrast, the foreign ministry protest
 of 10 June had expressed "sincere and deep gratitude" for the
 socialist countries' condemnation of the U.S. escalation and
 appealed to "brother;. and friends" to etr:'ggle evon more
 vigorously to stay the U.S. hand and continue to support and
 assist the Vietnamese.
 It is unclear whether the foreign ministry statement's failure
 to mention socialist support and assistance was calculated to
 suggest dissatisfaction with Moscow's and Peking's current stands.
 Despite the absence of any reference `o the socialist countries
 in the statement, condemnations of air sl:rikec by. Soviet and
 Chinese spokesmen continue to be cited in other current DRV1 comment.
 A PRG Foreign Ministry statement of 24 June protesting the air
 strikes in both North and South Vietnam echoed earlier high-level
 DRV statements in expressing thanks for support "from brothers
 and friends" and in asserting 'confidence that the peoples and
 governmet-ts of various countries "will take active and timely
 measures to stay the bloody hands of the Nixon Administration."
 DOWNING OF PLANES     Propaganda fanfare celebrating the claimed
 downing of the 3,700th U.S. aircraft on
 27 June underscored Hanoi's determination to "direct staggering
 counterblows at the U.S.'air pirates and properly punish them
 for all their criminal war escalation steps."  Hanoi radio
 claimed on the 27th that a total of 10 U.S. jets, "including the
 3,700th U.S. aircraft downed over the North," had fallen victim
 to DRV antiaircraft'and air force units that day, and it put the
 total of U.S. planes downed at 3,704.  Identifying a captured
 pilot for the first time since the April escalation, VNA reported
 on 20 June that a plane piloted by Richard Logan Francis "was among
 the five U.S. aircraft shot down by the Hanoi aimed forces yesterday."
 The VNA account said Francis' wounds were bandaged before his
 captors took him to prison.

 28 JUNE 1972
 On 26 June the VPA High Command sent commendations to the Hanoi
 people and armed forces and the Vietnam people's air forces
 "for their brilliant feat of shooting down 10 U.S. jet planes
 within a few hours yesterday."*  Exhorting the armed forces
 in Hanoi and the people's air force to "steel their determination
 to fight and win," the commendation noted that the 39700th plane
 was downed during the action and that "a number" of U.S. pilots
 had been "wiped out or captured."  A NHAN DAN editorial on the
 28th portrayed the downing of the 3,700th u.S. aircraft as having
 "the force of a triumphal song praising the glorious journey
 North Vietnam has made in the past eight years, bath:Lng in fire
 but fighting unflinchingly and gaining strength all the time."
 CHARGES OF STRIKES     The foreign ministry statement on the 26th
 AT DIKE SYSTEM        highlighted alleged U.S. bombing of dikes,
 claiming that "violent strikes on the dike
 system and irrigation works" expose "the utterly brutal aggressive
 nature of the U.S. imperialists and the fallacy of their propaganda
 about peace and goodwill."  The statement said that dike segments
 were among the many areas bombed in Hanoi, Haiphong, Viet Tri, and
 "many other populous areas."
 A statement issued by the DRV Watar Conservancy Ministry on 16 June
 had scored alleged strikes at the dike system from 10 April to
 10 .June,** and propaganda has since been giving the issue increasing
 Tattention.  .1 23 June NHAN DAN editorial, for example, attacked
 "the Nixou clique" for "moving further :-long the criminal path"
 and sending "aircraft and vessels to bomb and shell many important
 dikes on large river networks and many water conservancy projects."
 It asserted that "the Nixon clique" hopes to break the dikes and
 thereby cause floods and droughts.  A NHL,-,' DAN article on the same
 day claimed that recent U.S. attacks on coastal dikes and dike
 sections neat the river mouths were timed just "before the flash
 flood season with the aim of weakening the bodies and bases of
 the dikes so that when the water level rises the dikes can easily
 be damaged."
 *  The VPA High Command has sent several messages of commendation
 since the escalatirn of the air war in early April.  For example,
 on 11 May the armed forces and people of Hanoi and Haiphong were
 commended for downing numerous plane3.

 28 JUNE 1972
 A NHAN DAN article on the 26th also warned of futu,'e flooding
 when it charged that President Nixon "has ordered" air and
 naval attacks on many dikes and sluices along the major rivers--
 the Red, Thai, Binh, Day, Ma, and tam--as well as the Nam Dinh
 canal and many sea dikes in Thai Binh, Nam Ha, and Ninh Binh
 provinces.  The paper charged that the strikes at this time of
 year had considerably weakened the dikes and "destroyed the
 structure of the soil in the embankments."  Observing that
 the recent attacks have not caused immediate floods, the article
 said that breaks in the dikes would be "unavoidable" if bombing
 were stepped up during the flood season.  An editorial in the
 party paper on the same day urged that careful. preparations be
 made to cope with floods when they occur, saying that each
 family is expected to be prepared to move provisions and domestic
 animals "to high and dry places" during the forthcoming rainy
 season.  The 28 June NHAN DAN editorial laudi'g the claimed
 downing of the 3,700th plane the day before charged the President
 with genocide, claiming that he "is launching attacks in a most
 provocative manner on dike systems with the intent to carry out
 mass murders through floods and famine."
 A 27 June LPA commentary denouncing U.S. bombing in North and
 South Vietnam focused on recent strikes at portions of dikes
 and irrigation works along the Ma river and cited an article
 published in THE GUARDIAN on 22 June for the claim that the
 United Stbtes has resorted to ",.rti#icial rains" as a means of
 causing "widespread floods."
 FOREIGN MINISTRY       In addition to the 26 Jude foreign ministry
 SPOKESMAN PROTESTS     statement, daily foreign ministry spokesman
 protests ir. the past week have included the
 following specific charges :
 +  The 21 June statement alleged that on the previous day "U.S.
 aircraft indiscriminately poured bombs and shells on many urban
 wards, schools, hospitals, and factcries" within Nam Dinh
 municipality.  It also charged that on the same day B-52's hit
 "many populous areas" in Ha Bac, Quang Ninh, Nat, Ha, Thanh Hoa,
 Nghe Pn, Ha Ti:', .and Quang Binh provinces and Vinh Linh.
 +  The statement on 22 June charged that "in addition to continuing
 the dropping of mines to seal off various; ports of the DRV," U.S.
 aircraft had bombed and shelled the outskirts of Haiphong city and
 several other populated areas in Bac Thai., Quang Ninh, Hai Hung,
 Thc.i Binh, Nun Ha, Ninh Binh, Nghe An, and Ha Tinh provinces.  The
 statement also claima4 that B-;,2's had struck a number of villages
 and hamlets in Quang, Binh Province and the Vinh Linh area.

 28 JUNE 1972
 +  "Sternly" protesting the "killing and woundit.g of many
 civilians," the statement on the 23d claimed "continued
 barbarous strikes" withir. Lang Son, Ha Bac, Ha Tay, Quang
 Ninh, Thai Binh, Ninh Binh, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh,
 and Quang Binh provinces and Vinh Linh as well as at several
 villages "on the outskirts of Hanoi."
 +  Air strikes on 23 June were condemned in the statement on
 the 24th, which charged that rockets fell "in the center of
 Hanoi and on its outskirts," destroying the Nam Dan dam and a
 portion of the sea dike in Nhan Ly hamlet.  Ridiculing U.S.
 denials that "it is not U.S. policy to bomb dikes," the
 statement asserted that "U.S. imperialism cannot cover up
 the obvious fact that for more than two months, U.S. aircraft
 and warships have relentlessly struck at DRV dikes and
 hydraulic works and even at the people who have been engaging
 in repairing the damaged sections."  The protest also claimed
 that many populous areas in Yen Bai, Lang Son, Quang Binh,
 Ha Tay, Nam Ha, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Binh
 provinces had been hit.
 Additional details concerning the effects of the.-rockets
 directed at Hanoi on the 23d were provided in an article
 broadcast by Hanoi radio on the 24th.  Citing several examples
 of civilian deaths caused by the raids, the broadcast claimed
 tnat the attacks had served culy to spur the Hanoi populace to
 "exert greater efforts to Ft 3p up production and to satisfactorily
 carry out antiaircraft and ewscuation tasks."
 + The 25 June statement condemned air strikes at populous areas
 in Vinh Phu, Bac Thai, Hoa Binh, Quang Ninh, Thai Binh, Ninh
 Binh, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Binh provinces and
 Vinh Linh.  Echoing the statement of the 24th, the protest
 specifically denounced the Nixon Administration for "continuously
 attacking the DRV's dikes and water conservancy projects."
 +  Strikes against Hanoi on 26 and 27 June, as well as continuing
 bombing a.id shelling of "many municipalities, townships, and
 villages in other provinces," drew a foreign ministry spokesman's
 statement on the 27th protesting the "mad bombing and shelling"
 of the capital which "killed and wounded many innocent people and

 claim that the Vietnamese people "ire determined to, smash to
 pieces all the U.S. mad steps o` war escalation to protect
 their fatherland."  In further contrast with the previous
 protests issued during the past week, the statement of the
 27th called upon the United States to "enter into serious
 negotiations at the Paris conference on Vietnam and positively
 respond to the seven-point solutian of the PRGRSV, the two key
 problems of which were recently further clarified."
 DRV STRESSES IMPORTMICE OF TRANSPORTATION. USE OF "NEW FORCES"
 Hanoi's continuing concern with transportation problems was und.r
 scored in a 26 June broadcast of an article by Communications and
 Transportation Minister Phan Trong Tue pegged to awards recently
 given to outstanding units and individuals in communications and
 transportation work.*  The article echoed earlier Hanoi comment
 when it said that the Central Committee "regards communications
 and transportation as the key and central task of all the party,
 people, and armed forces" and that the maintenance of communications
 and transportation is "one of the decisive conditions" in obtaining
 victory.  While devoted mainly to outlining actions to be taken in
 the present situ'tion, the article also reflected current problems.
 In observing that the communications and transportation combatants
 have met "innumerable difficulties and hardships," it said, for
 example, that "if food supplies are not brought in time the
 combatants eat jungle plants so that they have sufficient energy
 to continue working."  Urging transportation forces to preserve
 their cargoee; and vehicles, the article also noted the importance
 of being careful with fuel--"considering gas as one's blood."
 The strain of transportation tasks on manpower resources was
 pointed up by the article's injunction to conserve manpower and
 its acknowledgment that transportation work requires mobilization
 of a "great number" of the masses and "the organization of people
 along communications lines" to carry out such tasks as road repair,
 the camouflage of supplies, and loading and unloading.  Problems
 in organizing the mast:, involvement in transportation tasks seemed
 reflected in instructions the article offered for dealing with
 "new forces" now supplementing the regular transportation forces.
 "Cadres, workers, and assault youths in the communications and
 transportation branch" were told to "provide utmost assistance for

 and closely cooperate with these new forces."  The article
 called for the "rapid readjustment and arrangement of the forces
 in the branch and the new supplementary forces," and it seemed
 to indicate the formula for such reorganization when it noted a
 need to set up "many assault teams" to carry out such tasks as
 the repair of roads and bridges and air defense.
 BRED1NEV PLEDGES CONTINUED AID TO VIETNAM, ASSAILS "BLOCKADE"
 In the wake of the Soviet-U.S. summit, Moscow has continued to
 stress the constancy of its assistance and support for the
 Vietnamese and to score the Chinese "splittist" stand on
 Indochina.  Brezhnev's 27 June remarks or. Vietnam, at a banquet
 for the visiting Castro, were more forceful than most recent
 Moscow comment.  Brezhnev's assertion that Soviet "support and
 all-round aid to the Vietnamese people will continue until the
 victory of its just cause" goes beyond his 5 June speech during
 Tito's visit as well as the 19 June Soviet-DRV announcement on
 Podgorny3y's visit to Hanoi.  Brezhnev had pledged cn 5 June that
 Soviet support and assistance is "immutable," and the statement
 on the Podgornyy visit merely promised "necessary assistance and
 su,pport."
 Brezhnev's criticism of U.S. actions in the DRV was also stronger
 than that in recent authoritative Soviet comment,  Thus, he said
 "we resolutely condemn the measures undertaken lately by the
 United States to blockade DRV ports and to intensify bombings of
 economic objectives, Transport routes, and populated localities."
 In the Joint communique on President Nixon's visit, Moscow had
 demanded an end to the bombing but had notably failed to mention
 the mining.  The Soviet version of the announcement on the
 Podgornyy visit reported that the two sides demanded an end to
 the mining, while the Hanoi version additionally imputed to the
 two sides a description of the mining as a "blockade."  In his
 speech on the 27th, Brezhnev also routinely called for a withdrawal
 of U.S. and allied troops and repeated the view that "a basis for
 constructive talks and for attaining a political settlement" is
 provided by the DRV and PRG proposals and the proposals of the
 FUNK and the NLHS.
 Moscow's defense of its Vietnam stand included a 21 June domestic
 service commentary which said the passage on Vietnam in the joint
 communique ;n President Nixon's visit was couched "in the clearest
 possible terms and gives absolutely no justification for any
 speculation regarding the position of the Soviet Union."  A Radio

 Peace and Progress commentary in Mandarin on the 24th said that the
 PRG's message responding to Soviet congratulations on the 6 June
 anniversary of the PRG's establishment again proved the USSR's
 "genuine internationalist policy" when it expressed gratitude for
 "very valuable" support and "huge and effecs.ive" aid.  The broadcast
 went on to score Peking's failure to join in united action and its
 attempts "to sow discord between the Vietnamese and Soviet peoples"
 with talk of "two superpowers."  The commentary also charged Peking
 with obstructing the transport of Soviet aid to Vietnam but left
 it unclear whether the reference wao to current or past obstruction.
 Moscow has not specifically complained of Chinese aid obstruction
 since the mining, but a 17 June article by Varnai in the Hungarian
 party organ NEPSZABADSAG alluded to the Chinese refusal to allow
 Soviet ships to use Chinese ports when it charged that China
 "rejected joint action in helping Vietnam even after the announcement
 of the U.S. blockade."*
 A 25 June !ASS report of Kissinger's press conference upon his
 return from Peking noted that he acknowledged that Vietnam had
 been discussed in detail.  TASS, of course, did not acknowledge
 his speculation on a "policy review" that may now be going on in
 Hanoi, or the exchanges with reporters on Moscow's and Peking's
 attitudes toward a settlement and on Peking's reported refusal
 to let Soviet ships unload cargoes destined for Vietnam at Chinese
 ports.
 TASS noted Kissinger's remarks regarding U.S. support for direct
 negotiations with the DRV, but it observed that he "refused" to
 say when the United States would return to the Paris conference.
 A brief report attributed to TASS in the 26 June PRAVDA on
 Secretary Rogers' press conference before his departure on his
 foreign tour noted without comment his assertion that the United
 States continues to give preference to the Paris conference as
 a forum for settling the Vietnam conflict and is hopeful that
 "the other side is interested in talks."  Moscow comment
 criticizing the U.S. refusal to resume the Paris talks has
 included a 21 June RED STAR article by Leontyev and Gavrilov
 which said that "the Vietnam question cannot be resolved by
 the force of weapons.  It must and can be resolved only through
 talks on the basis of respect for the national rights and
 expectations of the Vietnamese people."  The article praised the
 PRG proposal as "a sensible and constructive basis" for restoring
 peace in Vietnam and recalled that the 10 June DRV Foreign Ministry
 statement again called upon the United States to hold "serious
 talks" in Paris and give a "positive reply" to the PRG's seven-
 point proposal.

 AIR STRIKES     Moscow has been duly reporting Hanoi's continuing
 official protests over U.S. bombing, but there
 has been minimal Soviet comment.      For example, a Serbin dispatch
 from Hanoi, published in PRAVDA on 16 June, cited a worker as
 referring to difficulties because so many of the men were in the
 amy or working on road construction and transport and as saying
 that the rice harvest will be a "frontline" harvest because of
 the bombing.
 According to VNA on the 25th, condemnation of alleged U.S. attacks
 on DRV dikes and other hydraulic works had been voiced by the
 Chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet Council of Unions,
 A. P. Shitikov, when he received a visiting DRV war crimes
 commission delegation on the 22d.  A Soviet report of the meeting,
 broadcast by Moscow radio on the 22d and published in IZVESTIYA
 on the 24th, reported only that Shitikov condemned U.S. "aggressive
 actions" against the DRV.  VNA also cited him as promising greater
 economic and military assistance, but Moscow said he recalled
 that Podgornyy's visit reaffirmed Soviet "solidarity" with the
 Vietnamese people.  The alleged U.S. bombing of dikes and dams
 was brought up in a Moscow domestic service broadcast on the
 27th which cast doubt on White House Spokesman Ziegler's denial
 of such bombing. The broadcast pointedly recalled that General
 Lavelle had gone beyond his authority in bombing North Vietnamese
 targets.  Another broadcast on the same day described U S.
 actions in both North and South Vietnam as genocide.
 EAST EUROPEAN    Following the appearance of the 17 June Varnai
 CONWf:NTARIES   article in the Hungarian party daily NEPSZABADSAG,
 which had sought to reconcile the Soviet-U.S.
 summit with Moscow's loyalty to its Vietnamese ally, other
 members at the Soviet bloc have chimed in with defenses of
 Soviet policy and attacks on Peking in terms more outspoken
 than Moscow itself has used.  A 21 June article in the Polish
 Government daily ZYCIE WARSZAWY took issue with U.S.
 "Kremlinologists" who see differences between Hanoi and Moscow
 and who claim that the Soviet Union criticized the Vietnamese
 leaders, urging them to adopt a more conciliatory position
 toward American peace proposals.  The article said the
 communique on Podgornyy's visit to Hanoi shows that such
 speculations are inaccurate.  It went on to assert that the
 Vietnamese need help from all the socialist countries and
 have succeeded in the difficult task of maintaining friendly
 relations with both the Soviet Union and China despite the
 anti-Soviet overtones of Peking's policy, "with whir:h Hanoi
 cannot, of course, be in solidarity."  Casting doubt on Peking's

 motives, the article observed pointedly that China must be
 concerned with the bombings, "especially those near her borders,"
 but still is not ready to coordinate aid with the other
 socialist countries.  Rather, the article speculated, Vietnam
 would probably be a topic of discussion during Kissinger's visit
 to Peking..
 A 21 June article in the Czechoslovak party daily RUDE PRAVO
 emphasized the firmness of the USSR's Vietnam stand, pointing to
 the Soviet Union's "powerful military, economic, and political
 assistance" to the Vietnamese and recalling that during President
 Nixon's visit the Soviet leaders "clearly and uncompromisingly
 repeated" the point that a U.S. withdrawal and acceptance of the
 Vietnamese peace proposals constituted the "only" road to a
 political solution.  The article emphasized that Vietnam is the
 question on which the Soviet Union and other socialist countries
 "know of no compromise and cannot compromise."
 Also on 21 June, an article in Hungary's NEPSZABADSAG stressed
 the determination of the Vietnamese to hold out until final
 victory despite U.S. "genocide" and Washington's apparent
 effort to impose a "peas-- of the graveyard" in Vietnam.  The
 article asserted that "never before have the Vietnamese people
 been in greater need of a consolidation of international
 solidarity," which is needed all the more because  he Chinese
 refusal to cooperate with the USSR "seriousl; harms those
 struggling for their just cause."

 PEKING SIGNS NEW SUPPLE'M'ENTARY AID AGREEMENT WITH DRV
 Peking has reaffirmed its backing for the Vietnamese war effort
 by signing another supplementary aid agreement with the DRV and
 issuing a PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article on 28 June ia support
 of a series of statements by its Vietnamese allies condemning U.S.
 military actions.  NCNA announced that an agreement was signed in
 Peking on the 28th providing Chinese "supplementary economic and
 military material aid" to the Vietnamese for 1972.  The agreement,
 which consists of a protocol on the supply of "ordinary materials"
 and another one on the "gracIitous supply of military equipment
 and material," is the product of the protracted stay of DRV Vice
 Foreign Trade Minister Ly Ban, who arrived in Peking on 3 May with
 the announced purpose of discussing aid.
 A protocol on supplementary military aid to Vietnam for 1972 had
 been signed in Peking on 22 January, and a similar supplementary
 protocol for 1971 was signed last July.  A more comparable
 occasion was the "agreement" on "supplementary economic and
 military aid" signed in Peking on 15 February 1971 during the
 Lam Son 719 operation in southern Laos.   However, on that occasion
 the NCNA announcement was prefaced by a statement of purpose
 saying the agreement was concluded in order "to completely defeat
 the U.S, aggressors and all their running dogs in Indochina."
 There was no such statement in the current announcement.
 Chou En-tai and PLA Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng attended the
 signing ceremony in February 1971.  This time the ranking Chinese
 officials present were Yeh Chien-ying, who has been performing
 functions formerly carried out by the purged Huang, and Vice
 Premier Li Hsien-nien.
 There may have been a hint of Sino-Vietnamese strain in NCNA's
 statement that Yeh and Li had "a cordial and friendly talk" with
 the Vietnamese comrades. Peking's standard formulation for
 relations with its close allies is "very cordial and friendly"--
 the formulation used to characterize Chou'? tal'. with Ly Ban
 three days after his arrival as well as the meetings between the
 DRV delegation and the Chinese in February 1971.
 CHINESE COMMENT     The 28 June PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator
 article, pegged to foreign ministry statements
 issued by the PRG and the DRV on 24, 25, and 26 June, criticized
 the U.S. mining of DRV ports and intensified bombing as well as
 the redeployment of American forces from Vietnam to Thailand.
 Commentator declared that no matter "how desperately" the United
 States escalates the war, the Chinese "will, as always, resolutely
 support" their Vietnamese and other Indochinese allies.

 28 JUNE 1972
 The Commentator article represented Pekiteg'a first reaffirmation
 of support for the Vietnamese since the 12 June PRC Foreign
 Ministry statement protesting air strikes near the Chinese
 border.  Unlike the 12 June statement, however, Commentator made
 no reference to Chinese security interests or provocations
 against the PRC.  Like the foreign ministry protest, Commentator
 avoided mentioning the Nixon Administration or raising issues
 concerning a political settlement in Vietnam--elements present
 in the PRG and DRV statements.
 Peking's choice on this occasion of a Commentator article--
 rather thsn an official statement as ii: the cage of the protest
 injecting Chinese security interests--reflects its carefully
 calibrated expression of involvement in Vietnamese developments.
 The Chinese may have felt constrained to reaffirm their support
 for the Vietnamese after Kissinger's latest visit to Peking and
 in view of the successive PRG and DRV statements, particularly
 the one protesting air strikes on Hanoi proper.*  Commentator
 somewhat softened the 12 June statement's assurances to the
 Vietnamese, making no reference to an "unshirkable inter-
 nationalist duty" and saying that the Chinese and Vietnamese
 people are "closely related like the lips and the teeth" without
 noting also that they are neighbors.  Similarly, where the
 foreign ministry statement warned that the Vietnamese "are by no
 means alone" in their struggle, Commentator less emphatically
 pointed out that the Vietnamese "are not alone" in the struggle.
 The U.S. mining and bombing measures in Vietnam were also
 condemned in the customary 25 June PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial
 marking the anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean war.  There
 was no mention of Chinese security interests or support for the
 war effort in Vietnam, the editorial simply claiming that a U.S.
 defeat was a certainty.  In a reflection of Peking's guarded
 assessment of the communist offensive in Vietnam, the editorial
 did not repeat last year's obser??,tion that the "raging flames"
 of Vietnamese resistance were leaping "higher and higher,"
 forcing Washington into an "unprecedented dilessnn," and that the
 United States had been defeated in Vietnam on a scale not
 duplicated since the Korean war.  More generally, the editorial
 reflected the change over the past year in the Sino-U.S.
 *  There has been no regular pattern in recent weeks in Peking's
 response to official DRV statements.  On occasion Peking has
 seconded these statements on the same official level, at times
 it has made use of an editorial or Commentator article, and at
 other times it has offered no supporting comment at all.

 relationship by significantly muting the harsh attack in the 1971
 editorial on the United States as the "most ferocious enemy of
 the people of Asia" and as threatening "a new war of aggression
 in Asia."
 The day after the Korean war anniversary, NCNA announced the
 arrival in Peking of U.S. Congressional leaders Boggs and Ford.
 NCNA reported that they were feted at a banquet on the 26th
 attended by NPC Vice Chairman Kuo. Mo-jo after having a "friendly"
 talk with Kuo and other Chinese officials--marking the first time
 Peking has offered an explicitly favorable characterization of a
 meeting with U.S. officials.  The Kissinger delegation, which had
 arrived in Peking one day after the stopover of DRV negotiator
 Le Duc Tho on his way home, had held "extensive, earnest, and
 frank" discussions with Chou En-lai and other officials during
 the previous week.  The delegation was given a banquet on the
 20th attended by Chou, Yeh Chien-ying, Foreign Minister Chi
 Peng-fei, and PRC ambassador to Paris Huang Chen.
 PRC COVERAGE OF     The evolving Sino-U.S. relationship has been
 FOF.EIGN COMMENT    reflected in PRC media's selective coverage
 of foreign comment on Vietnamese developments.
 Thus, NCwA's account of the 24 June PRG statement on U.S. air
 strikes deleted vitriolic references to President Nixon and an
 attack on the Administration's 'deceitful" diplomatic efforts.
 Similarly, NCNA omitted an attack on the U.S. "allegations about
 peace and good will" contained in a DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's
 statement of the 21st.  Peking's cautious approach to the
 Vietnamese communist offensive has also been reflected in accounts
 of a North Korean pronouncement and a PRG-Mauritanian communique
 that deleted references to "brilliant victories" won in the
 offensive.
 N"NA's account of the 24 June PRG statement deleted a passage
 attacking the "perfidious maneuver" of the United States to
 "weaken the united front" of world support for the Vietnamese--
 a passage suggestive of delicate issues involving outside powers
 and U.S. political moves.  However, an NCNA report on a 22 June
 Albanian editorial retained a passage accusing the "Moscow
 social imperialists" of coping to the assistance of the United
 States in Vietnam in an effort to strengthen the "holy Soviet-
 U.S. alliance" and undermine the Indochinese struggle.
 NCNA also carried harsh attacks on the -United States and the
 Soviet Union in covering Prince Sihanouk's trip to Albania, but
 this was in conformity with Peking's practice of putting its

 Speaking at a banquet in Tirana on 23 June, ;.'ihanouk described
 President Nixon as "more perfidious, more cruel, and more
 obstinate" than his predecessor and denounced the "deceitful
 peace maneuvers of the Machiavellian Richard Nixon."  On the
 same occasion the Albanian president excoriated the "modern
 revisionists" as "sham friends" of the Indochinese people and
 denounced Moscow's stand on the U.S. mining as well as its
 failure to recognize Sihanouk's government as a policy of "anti-
 imperialism in words but pro-imperialism in deeds."

 HANOI ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS FOR ARID FORCES PARTY COMMITTEES
 On 20 June Hanoi radio and the army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN began
 publicizing in installments a "document" issued by the VPA General
 Political Department which amounts to a lengthy handbook of
 instructions on the functioning of party committees in the army.
 The five-part document spells out in meticulous detail 1) the
 organization and position of army party committees; 2) rules on
 the makeup and ta6ks of the committees,  including the specific
 responsibilities of standing committees, party secretaries,
 committee members, and control committees; 3) principles of
 the committees' leadership and relations with other elements;
 4) work methods, including rules on the convening of meetings
 and implementation of resolutions; and 5) basic guidelines for
 building the committees' leadership.
 The release of these instructions at this time may have been
 prompted, at least in part., by the need to strengthen party
 organization in order to deal with strains created by the new
 military demands and personnel losses resulting from this
 spring's offensive in South Vietnam.  However, the detailed,
 basic nature of the document suggests that it is aimed at the
 long-range, ongoing tac'.: of guiding and strengthening the party
 organization in the VPA.  similarly, with this apparent purpose,
 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN from 24 to 26 February had published a lengthy
 set of instructions for party chapters in agencies (co quan)
 which it said was an excerpt from a book on the subject "edited
 by the VPA Department of Organization under the direction of
 the General Political Department as a document of study and
 guidance in building the party in various army agencies."  The
 March issue of the army's QUAN DOI NHAN DAN journal carried an
 article attributed to Le Tat Thang which discussed the same
 problem.
 The document currently being publicized was anticipated in
 another article by Thang in the April issue of the army journal
 which pointed out the importance of strong, well-run party
 committees in combat.  Thang maintained that party committees
 play "a more important role in large-scale battles and in combat
 with coordination of various armed services."  The author may
 have been alluding to the current offensive in a passage in
 which he declared that "in view of the requirements of the present
 combat task," the "strengthening of the leadership of party
 committees becomes more important  'nd urgent."

 The importance of the role of the party committee in the army
 was also noted in a 20 June QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial, on
 building the army and in an editorial in the army paper on the
 25th which discussed the duties of political commissars.  The
 latter editorial argued that "the strengthening of the party's
 leadership in every field and under all circumstances, especially
 in the present violent struggle, is a decisive factor for
 victory."

 KOREA
 KOREAN W,^R ANNIVERSARY RECEIVES MUTED TREATMENT
 The 22d anniversar:' of the outbreak of the Korean War (25 June)
 and the attendant "solidarity month" have been marked in a
 lower key by Pyongyang as well as by Pelting and Moscow than
 has been customary in past years.  Pyongyang's treatment of the
 anniversary has been bland and more notable for its
 omis:rions than for any new developments in issues discussed.
 The downplaying of the anniversary, traditionally an occasion
 for vituperative attacks on the alleged aggressive intent
 of the United States and its South Korean "puppet," is
 consistent with the DPRK's evolving line of moderation and
 flexibility in dealing with the ROK and the United States.
 This line was first manifested last summer and reflects
 the changing relationships in Asia stemming from the Siro-
 U.S. rapprochement.*
 Pyongyang rarked the anniversary with the customary rally
 in thn capital, a joint statement by public organizations,
 and editorial comment.  This year's rally, however, was
 given somewhat less prominence than has been customary even
 for nondecennial anniversaries.**  The ranking official
 present was KPA Chief of General Staff 0 Chin-u and the
 address was made by the trade unions chief.  Normally, the
 nondecennial rallies have been attended by First Vice
 Premier Kim I1, and last year's was addressed by Second
 Vice Premier Pak Song-chol, a higher-level official than
 usual.  This year's rally was reportedly attended by some
 20,000 people; last year's was said to have been attended
 by 100,000 and previous nondecennial rallies reportedly
 drew 200,000.
 *  The "preliminary" talks between the North and South Korean
 Red Cross organizations, begun last August to discuss the
 fate of families separated by the Korean War, arrived at an
 agenda for the "fuV.i-dress" talks on 16 June after some
 20 meetings and a number of "working-level" sessions.  Since
 the beginning of the year, Kim Il-song has elaborated on various
 proposals for the reduction of North-South tensions in a series
 of interviews with foreign newsmen, most recently in a
 21 June interview with Selig Harrison of the Washington POST.
 **  The major 20th anniversary in 1970 was attended by Kim Il-song
 and special foreign delegations and was addressed by Kim I1.

 "Japanese militarism" in stock terms, but otherwise few
 issues were raised.  The unification issue was not developed
 beyond expressions of support for the eight-point program for
 peaceful unification adopted at the DPRK Supreme People's
 Assembly in April 1970 and for Kim I1-song's 10 January
 YOMIURI interview and hie 26 May interview with the New York
 TIMES in which he elaborated proposals for a North-South
 peace agreement and political contacts.  Standard demands
 for U.S. withdrawal from South Korea and the dissolution of
 UNCURK were repeated, and the public organizations' joint
 statement added that the U1:!tdd Nations should no longer be
 "abused" by the United States as a tool for aggression and
 "must annul all the previous illegal 'resolutions' on Korea."
 The joint statement alluded to President Nixon's detente
 diplomacy to the course of calling upon the United States to
 withdraw its troops from the South.  Recalling that in the
 past the United States argued that it had to retain its
 military bases in South Korea to prevent communist expansion,
 the statement said that now that the Americans "are going to
 have good relations with big socialist countries there will
 be no ground for them to keep their military bases in South
 Korea."
 Pyongyang used the occasion to call upon the ROK rulers to
 discard their "reliance upon outside forces" and to accept
 the DPRK's "fair and aboveboard proposals" on unification
 through North-South negotiations.  The "appeal to the South
 Korean peoples" adopted at the rally was notable for its
 failure to F,ttack Pak Chong-hui or to call for the overthrow
 of his "clique" as was standard in previous years.  Although
 Pak was si4bjected to scathing criticism in a low-level KCNA
 commentary on his own speech on the anniversary, even this
 commentary did not demand his ouster, merely calling upon
 his "clique" to "atone for its crimes" and heed the DPRK's
 proposals on peaceful negotiations.
 The theme of Asian unity and the emphasis on Sino-Korean
 solidarity, which dominated the proceedings last year, '7ere
 all but absent this year.  There was no particular effurt
 to link Chinese and Korean security interests, and Asian
 unity received only a passing reference in the rally speech.
 The speaker called upon "all revolutionary peoples of the
 world" to unite and deal joint blows against U.S. imperialism,
 appealing for such unity "particularly" among the "revolutionary
 peoples of Asia."

 PEKING     The effect of Sino-U. S. developments in the part
 year was also evident in Peking's muted treatmer-t
 of the anniversary.  Where last year the occasion was marked
 by a Peking rally addressed by NPC Vice Chairman Kuo Mo-jo
 as well as the customary PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial, this year
 the rally was omitted and the editorldl pulled its punches
 against U.S. Asian policy.  The 1971 editorial, depicting a
 U.S. "policy of aggression and war in Asia," called the DPRK
 "an impregnable fortress standing rock-firm at the anti-U.S.-
 imperialist front in East Asia."  This year's editorial more
 blandly Described the DPRK as "a powerful socialist state
 standing firm at the eastern outpost of the anti-imperialist
 struggle."  It did not repeat last year's references to the
 Pueblo, the downing of U.S. planes, or alleged provocations
 against North Korea.  The editorial referred to the "blood-
 sealed friendship and unity" of the Chinese and Koreans as
 "a reliable guarantee" for defeating common enemies, but it
 did not invoke the possibility of a new war with the
 United States and did not repeat last year's characteriza-
 tion of the two allies as being as close as "lips and teeth."
 The editorial demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops from
 South Korea and the peaceful unification of the country,
 endorsing the eight-point program and the "major proposals"
 advanced by Kim I1-song in his press interviews on a peace
 agreement between North and South, political negotiations,
 and the establishment of a confederation.  It reiterated that
 "U.S. troops under the signboard of the 'UN forces"' should
 pull out from South Korea and that UNCURK be dissolved.  The
 editorial's passages on other subjects, such as Taiwan,
 "Japanese militarism," and Vietnam are largely pro forma and
 devoid of harsh attacks on the United States.
 MOSCOW     Moscow gave the anniversary minimal attention this
 year, with routine press and radio comment and
 brief reports of greetings messages from Soviet public organiza-
 tions on the occasion of the "month of solidarity."  The
 customary Moscow rally was addressed by a Soviet friendship
 society official and the DPRK Ambassador.  In the usual
 manner, Moscow comment stressed the peaceful unification issue,
 expressing appr:val of the DPRK's proposals on contacts with
 South Korea and calling for withdrawal of U.S. troops, and
 emphasized the DPRK's peaceful economic development--with
 Soviet assistance.  A RED STAR article mentioned the Soviet-
 DPRK treaty on friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance
 in the usual manner on this occasion, asserting that it

 aerves the cause of "peace and security in the Par East" but
 avoiding a depiction of U.S. aggressiveness in this connection.
 This year's treatment of the United States in general was
 even milder than usual.  An IZVESTIYA article merely noted
 that the presence of U.S. troops in South Korea is "a source
 of tension is the Korean peninsula."  A RED W:t article
 denounced the South Korean "puppet regime" for transforming
 the country into "a military-strategic bridgehead for the
 Pentagon," but it did not further attack  he United States in
 this context.  Last year Moscow had pointed out that "one
 of the biggest contingents of U.S. troops in Asia" was
 stationed in South Korea, had elaborated on U.S. military
 assistance to "eoul, and had charged that the United States
 was trying to involve Japan in aggressive plans.  A PRAVDA
 article had gone so far as to link U.S. modernization of ROK
 forces and the moving of "fresh U.S. troops into the South"
 with a planned "march on the North" to "do away with" the
 DPRK.

 U.S. -SOV I ET RELATIONS
 MOSCOW AGAIN DEFENDS SUMMIT. AFFIRMS IDEOLOGICAL PURL TV
 Moscow has sustained its effort to Justify the results of the
 summit to domestic and foreign communist audiences.  Authoritative
 comment extolling the summit, more measured and less euphoric than
 earlier assessments, is balanced by more pointed  affirmations of
 the continuation of the class struggle in the international arena
 and the undiminished need for Soviet ideological vigilance and
 military preparedness.  Concurrently, Soviet media are devoting
 increasing attention to the evolving arms debate in the United
 States, with particular reference to Secretary Laird's requests
 for new strategic weapons.
 In keeping with this more militant stance, Brezhnev, in his
 27 June speech at a dinner honoring Fidel Castro, applauded the
 "successes" achieved at the summit but cautioned that they "in
 no way signify a possibility of weakening the ideological
 struggle."  He even allowed for an "intensification" of the
 latter and the possibility of its becoming "an increasingly
 acute" form of struggle in the future.  As if to affirm his
 ideological credentials before his Soviet and Cuban audience,
 Brezhnev declared:  "Marxist-Leninists have no illusions about
 the antipopular essence of imperialism and its aggressive
 intentions."*
 An article by USA Institute Director Arbatov in IZVESTIYA on
 21 June, largely devoted to hailing the strategic arms limitation
 agreements, expressed concern over the possibility that "right
 extremist circles" in the United States might try to "emasculate"
 the new arms accords by attempting to "compensate" for their
 restrictions by calling for a new arms race in areas not covered
 in the agreements.  While TASS had ignored Secretary Laird's
 testimony before the congressional appropriations committees
 on 5 and 6 June, a prompt TASS report on his appearance before
 the Senate Armed Services Committee on the 21st asserted that
 his emphasis on "poe tions of strength" contradicted the Basic
 Principles document signed by Brezhnev and the President in
 Moscow.  And an article on SALT in PRAVDA on the 22d, signed by
 * The formula disclaiming "illusions" about "imperialism" has
 been used by other members of the leadership--for example, by
 Andropov at a Murmansk awards ceremony last December and by
 Suslov in a 20 June Moscow speech to propagandists.

 0. Grinev and V. Pavlov, conveyed assurances that the USSR
 "has taken and will take all necessary measures to safeguard
 its own security and that of its allies."  While summaries
 of the Arbatov article were broadcast mainly to audiences
 outside the Soviet bloc, including North America, the Grinev-
 Pavlov article was publicized chiefly in broadcasts to
 Moscow's East European allies.  Both articles were summarized
 in Mandarin, and neither was carried in Radio Moscow's
 domestic service.
 ARBAfOV IN    Entitled "The Power of a Realistic Policy," the
 IZVESTIYA     Arbatov article, while playing the stock theme
 that the United States was forced to alter its
 "cold war" policy under the pressure of "new realities,"
 credited the United States with having taken "a positive
 and realistic stand on many of the questions discussed" at
 the summit.   After hailing the SALT agreements, along familiar
 lines, Arbatov notably took to task those unnamed "skeptics"
 who say that the new accords do not yet signify disarmament.
 In rebuttal he emphasized that not long ago such negotiations
 "concerning the very essence of national security" would have
 seemed "inconceivable."  Granting that the new accor.:s are
 only a first step, he added they s& a "an extremely important
 first step."  What the summit amounted to, he insisted, "is a
 considerable achievement in limiting arms, normalizing Soviet-
 U.S. relations, and strengthening peace and international
 security."
 At the same time, Arbatov's positive appraisal was tempered
 by reminders that the class struggla would continue and that
 current world tensions could adversely affect U.S.-Soviet
 relations.  In a passage apparently designed mainly for
 domestic consumption, Arbatov said that the USSR and the
 United States "are going to -be involved in a principled
 ideological struggle" and warned the Soviet people to beware
 of "subversive propaganda, ideological subversion, and
 psychological warfare"--"forme not compatible with peaceful
 coexistence, which the United Statec has used as part of its
 armory for a long time now."
 Shifting to a broader perspective, Arbatov commented ou t'ie
 different forms in which the class struggle could evolve,  "Will
 it be the form of armed clashes,, the arms race, acute and
 dangerous political crisis?  Or will it be in the form of
 peaceful coexistence in which ideological differences between

 the two systems and their rivalry in various spheres are
 combined with joint efforts in the sphere of peace and
 security?"  This difference in form, he emphasized, "can
 mean the difference between war and peace."
 In passages outlining how the "positive changes" in Soviet-
 U.S. relations could be altered by events, Arbatov registered
 concern about conflicting pressures in the United States that
 could "emasculate" the essence of the SALT agreements.  Noting
 that "right extremist groupings" have launched a campaign
 against the SALT agreements, he said that although they have
 failed to prevent the new accords, the debate over the U.S.
 military budget "demonstrates the path which could be explored--
 the path of 'compensating' for the restrictions imposed by the
 treaties by urging on the arms race in other spheres without
 actually expressing direct opposition to the treaties and
 agreements."  (On 25 June, a participant in Radio Moscow's
 weekly commentators' roundtable program pointed out that the
 debate on strategic arms is developing "essentially over
 whether ratification of the agreements should be accompanied
 by the adoption of new armament programs in certain fields.")
 Pointing to other issues that could affect U.S.-Soviet relations,
 Arbatov cited continuing tensions in the Middle East and
 Southeast Asia.  He declared in summation:  "In brief, the
 struggle to improve the international situation, including to
 normalize Soviet-U.S. relations, is by no means at an end;
 it will continue, demanding a great deal of effort, persistence,
 and vigilance."
 GRINEV, PAVLOV   The Grinev-Pavlov article is the second since
 IN PRAVDA        the summit to appear under an apparent
 pseudonym.*  While Pavlov's identity is
 not known, "0. Grinev" was identified in 1966 as the apparent
 pen-name of Foreign Ministry disarmament expert Grinevskiy.
 Among other articles signed by Grinev in 1966 was one in
 IZVESTIYA in August of that year commemorating the third
 anniversary of the signing of the nuclear test-ban treaty.
 Clearly designed to reassure the Soviet defense establishment
 as well the USSR's communist allies that the strategic arms
 limitation accords will not compromise Soviet military strength,

 the Grinev-Pavlov article developed a lengthy defense of the
 agreements along the lines of the 29 May PRAVDA editorial that
 offered Moscow's first authoritative appraisal of the summit
 results:  "The SALT agreements will undoubtedly go down in
 history as a major achievement along the path to curbing the
 arms race and reducing the threat of nuclear war, and as an
 important measure facilitating progress toward general and
 complete disarmament."  The commentators went on to discuss
 the ABM treaty and the interim agreement in standard fashion,
 still suppressing the details of the protocol which outlined
 the allotment of ballistic missiles for each side.  The article
 was notable, however, for a more pointed reassurance that the
 Soviet Union will continue to take unspecified measures to
 insure its security:
 Of course, the limitation of strategic weapons does not
 yet eliminate the danger of nuclear war, although it does
 move in this direction.  Until such time as this danger
 is liquidated, the Soviet Union has taken and will take
 all necessary measures to safeguard its own security and
 that of its allies.  This circumstance is taken into
 consideration by the Moscow agreements.  They in no way
 weaken the defense capability of the Soviet Union and
 its allies.
 TASS ON U.S.    In the same issue of PkAVDA that carried the
 STATEMENTS      Grinev-Pavlov article, a Washington-datelined
 TASS dispatch cited Secretary Laird's ~:& timony
 on 21 June before the Senate Armed Services Committee in which
 Laird linked his support for the new accords with congressional
 approval of funding for new weapons systems.  Quoting the
 Secretary as stating that the United States should negotiate
 with the Soviet Union "from a position of strength," the
 dispatch added:  "This contradicts the Basic Principles of
 relations between the USSR and the United States that was
 signed in Moscow--a document that proceeds from a recognition
 of the security interests of the sides based on the principle
 of equality and renunciation of the use of force or the
 threat to use it."
 TASS' account of President Nixon's 23 June press conference
 was markedly more cautious.  It played up the President's call
 for congressional approval of the SALT accords but obscured his
 remarks on the need for a continuing offensive nuclear weapons
 program.  TASS said the President "strongly urged" Congress
 to approve the accords "on their merits."  Noting that

 reporters drew the President's attention to Secretary Laird's
 linkage of the SALT accords to the financing of new strategic
 arms, the Soviet news agency cited the President's comment to
 the effect that they are "different matters."    It added:
 "but referring to the fact that the programs were recommended
 by the government prior to the signing of the arms limitation
 agreements, the President went on record for solving the
 question of their financing after the congress completes
 discussing the ARM treaty and the interim agreement."  'rASS
 did not mention the President's statement that Secretary
 Laird's position is "a sound one," or his remark that
 "without a continuing offensive program, we can be sure that
 the security interests of the United States would be
 jeopardized and the chances for a permanent offensive
 agreement will be totally destroyed."
 Soviet media likewise obscured Secretary Rogers' support
 foe funding of new strategic weapons.  A PRAVDA account of
 his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 on the 19th merely noted his support for the Moscow
 agreements and his request for early ratification.  The
 report ignored the Secretary's assertions that the new
 arms programs would strengthen U.S. security and provide
 "bargaining chips" for the next round of arms talks.

 DIMITROV ANNIVERSARY
 INTERNATIONAL MEETING IN SOFIA STRESSES SOVIET LEADING ROLE
 The 90th anniversary of the birth of Georgi Dimitrov on 18 June
 was used by the USSR and its hardcore East European allies to
 hold up the Bulgarian communist and Comintern leader as the
 prototype of a leader correctly blending national patriotism
 and socialist internationalism with awareness of the CPSU's
 key role in the world communist movement.  The event was played
 up in a sizeable three percent of Radio Moscow's commentary
 output in the week ending on the 18th.  The occasion was
 observed at commemorative meetings in Moscow, Prague., and
 Leipzig, addressed by Pelehe, Bilak, and Verner, respectively,
 and at a 13-17 June international conference in Sofia attended
 by 48 ruling and nonruling communist party delegates--including
 CPSU Secretary Ponomarev--and representatives of some 66 -1ther
 parties and organizations.
 The Sofia conference heard a letter of greeting to the Bulgarian
 party Central Committee from Tito, who had just returned from
 the USSR and was preparing to leave for Warsaw.  Conference
 speakers from the Yugoslav League of Communists and from such
 other independently oriented parties as the Romanian and Italian
 CP's focused selectively on such aspects as Dimitrov's "creative"
 approach and his promotion of the united front strategy of class
 struggle.
 The Chinese took minimal notice of the Dimitrov anniversary and
 ignored the Sofia ceremonies, which afforded a platform for
 direct and indirect attacks on the Peking leadership by Soviet
 bloc speakers.  NCNA reported on 17 June that an exhibition of
 books and photographs marking the anniversary was opened in
 Peking that day under the sponsorship of Chinese friendship
 societies.  The day before, NCNA reported that the Bulgarian
 ambassador had given a film show on the 16th to mark the
 occasion, with a vice foreign minister leading the Chinese
 officials in attendance.  Reflecting Peking's sensitivity
 regarding the Comintern as symbolizing Moscow's hegemony in
 the international communist movement, NCNA referred to "the
 Bulgarian people's leader Georgi Dimitrov" and made no mention
 of his Comintern association.

 28 JUNE 1972
 PONOMAREV'S SPE(fCH     In his speech to the Sofia conclave
 as reported in the Bulgarian party daily
 RABOTNICHESKO DELO on 14 Jura, Ponomarev characterized Dimitrov
 as "a great internationalist and great patriot, profoundly aware
 of the tremendous significance of the correct combination of
 international and national aspects" in the activity of both
 ruling and nonruling communist parties.  Underscoring Dimitrov's
 devotion to the unity of the international working class and
 the united front strategy, Ponomarev noted the late leader's
 striving for "the alinement and rallying of all progressive
 revolutionary forces:  the international workers class, the
 Soviet Union, the people's democracies, the peoples of
 colonial and independent countries, and the antifascist
 democratic movements throughout the world."  He observed that
 Moscow's strategy of a unified anti-imperialist struggle,
 spelled out at the 1969 Moscow international party conference
 and at the 24th CPSU Congress, had borne fruit in, among other
 things, President Nixon's visit to the USSR.
 Ponomarev repeatedly held up Dimitrov's irreconcilability toward
 ideological "deviations" as a model for communist parties today
 in opposing "all kinds of rightist and 'leftist' opportunism
 and revisionism and all manifestations of nationalism and
 national restrictiveness."  He denounced the Chinesa by name
 in a historical context:  Recalling that Dimitrov and the
 Comintern had contributed to the creation of "a united national
 anti-Japanese front in China" in the 1930's, Ponomarev added
 that "even at that time he declared himself against the
 erroneous trends which, as became clear later on, expressed
 the nationalistic positions of Mao Tse-tung's group."
 VELCHEV                  The keynote address by Bulgarian
 Politburo member and Secretary Velchev,
 which preceded Ponomarev's relatively moderate speech on the
 13th, prefaced a strong denunciation of the Chinese with the
 assertion that "anti-Sovietism is the poisonous bait with
 which imperialist propaganda strives to tempt some circles of
 the communist, socialist, trade union, and national liberation
 movements."  Such anti-Sovietism, Velchev said, "is particularly
 obviously manifested by the policy of the present Chinese
 leadership, which has taken the road of dissidence, setting
 the CCP in opposition to the CPSU" and the world communist
 movement and the PRC at odds with the socialist community.
 He added that this line is "used by international imperialism
 to weaken the positions of socialism and peace."

 28 JUNE 1972
 Scoring nationalism, Velchev stressed that the Bulgarian party
 and state "sacredly observe Dimitrov's behest:  always and in
 everything to combine patriotism with internationalism."
 Avowals of loyalty to the CPSU and the Soviet Union pervaded
 the speech.  "Dimttrov's stipulations on the Soviet Union as
 the mainstay 3f the working people all over the world,"
 Velchev declared, "have acquired renewed strength today."
 He also underscored the present-day validity of "Dimitrov's
 conclusion on the attitude toward the USSR and the CPSU as
 the 'touchstone' for proletarian internationalism,"
 OTHER EAST EUROPE    Speakers representing the parties of
 PARTY SPOKESMEN      Moscow's other orthodox East European
 allies generally emulated Ponomarev's
 moderate tone and refrained from combining their protestations
 of loyalty to the USSR with direct attacks on Peking.  Dimitrov's
 correct combining of patriotism and internationalism was
 stressed by Czechoslovakia's Svestka and Poland's Lukaszewicz,
 though not in so many words by Hungary's Nemes.  The latter,
 however, quoted Dimitrov to the effect that "any deviation"
 from the principle of alliance with the Soviet Union "is
 intolerable and harmful."  Similarly, the GDR's Norden declared
 that fulfillment of Dimitrov's legacy demands "irreconcilably
 struggling against bourgeois ideology, anticommunism, and anti-
 Sovietism in all its forms."
 ROMANIA'S RAUTU      Romanian Communist Party Executive
 Committee member Rautu avoided any mention
 of the Soviet Union, judging by the lengthy report of his
 conference speech in RABOTNICHESKO DELO on the 15th.  Focusing
 instead on Dimitrov's contribution to good relations between
 Bulgaria and Romania, he called relations between Sofia and
 Bucharest "a valuable model of permanent comradely and
 fraternal relations between two socialist countries."  In
 this context, Rautu reiterated the standard Bucharest line
 on observar.ce of "fully equal rights, sovereignty, and the
 principle of comradely mutual assistance" in :socialist inter-
 state relations.  He explicitly recalled Dimi.trov's call
 for a united front at the Seventh Comintern Congress of
 1935, but stuck to generalities in the present-day context.
 Thus he observe? that the communist parties "have a reliable
 guiding star in Marxism-Leninism" and--alluding to the May
 1972 Moscow summit--noted that "the recent developments are
 evidence of growing positive processes and realistic trends
 in international life toward detente."

 TITO'S LETTER     The letter from Tito to the Bulgarian Ceatral
 Committee on the occasion of the Dimitrov
 conference, like the conference speeches of the Yugoslav and
 Romanian delegates, did not mention the USSR.        As carried by
 TANJUG on the 14th, the letter dwelt on Dimitrov's promotion
 of friendship between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.       Tito praised
 Dimitrov's "breadth of political understanding of the complex
 international trends and concrete conditions in different
 countries."  He also recalled the late leader's "affirmation
 of people's national identity and self-determination," as
 well as his opposition to "all forms of nationalism and
 chauvinism.
 Tito recalled "with great pleasure" his meeting with Dimitrov
 at the Seventh Comintern Congress in 1935 and "the last meetings
 in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in 1947"--the year before iselgrade's
 break with the Cominform.  In 1'49, the year of Dimitrov's death
 in Moscow, Bulgarian Politburo member Kostov was purged and
 executed for, among other sins, "Titoism."  He was posthumously
 rehabilitated at the Bulgarian plenum of April 1956, and the
 Sofia dailies of 17 June 1972 carried commemorative articles
 on his 75th birth anniversary.

 ness," the Warsaw document added "full mutual understanding '1
 trust" where the 10 June Moscow communique added only "mutual
 respect and equality."  And where the Moscow document failed to
 record any overall meeting of minds, the Warsaw communique said
 the two sides "noted with satisfaction the identity or similarity
 of their views" on topical international questions,and on
 relations between the communist parties and "progressive and
 liberation movements."  The Warsaw communique also reported the
 signing of a bilateral supplementary trade agreement for 1971-75,
 while the document on Tito's Moscow visit merely referred to
 previously agreed measures for long-term economic cooperation.
 Tito's visit to Warsaw broke new ground in bilateral relations.
 The last Polish-Yugoslav summit meeting had taken place when
 Tito visited Warsaw in 1964, while Tito's recent Moscow talks
 amounted to a followup of Brezhnev's visit to Belgrade last
 September.
 The latest Warsaw communique, like the 10 Jr-e communique on
 Tito's talks  n Moscow, recorded an "exchang, of views" and
 "mutual informing" by the two leaders from still disparate
 ideological vantage points.  Thus in asserting that ;ielgrade-
 Warsaw relations "are becoming more and more comprehensive,
 stable, and long-term," it noted that the two leaders do not
 consider "the differences in the ways of building socialism in
 the two countries" to be an obstacle to successful development
 of -elations.  Accompanying comment in Warsaw media was franker
 than Moscow's had been on the basic difference between Poland
 as a Warsaw Pact member and Yugoslavia as a nonalined country.
 Like the Moscow communique, the Warsaw communique recorded both
 sides' renunciation of "the use or threat of force" in solving
 international disputes.  It also noted the "significance" of
 President Nixon's visits to Moscow and Warsaw and of Tito's
 visit to the USSR.

 FOLLOWUP CONNIENT     Warmer interstate relations with residual
 differences on the party level were
 reflected in comment in the party daily TRYBUNA LUDU and in a
 more enthusiastic appraisal on the visit in the government daily
 ZYCIE WARSZAWY.  The party paper observed on the 25th that the
 results of the talks "should be assessed as a positive contribu-
 tion of our two countries to the cause of security, peace, and
 socialist progress." It focused heavily on the improvement of
 economic relations between the two states, highlighting the
 supplemental trade agreement signed during Tito's visit.  ZYCIE
 WARSZAWY commented more effusively on the same day that "never
 before have the two countries been so close to one another as
 at present, and never did cooperation between our governments,
 our parties, and our nations have such optimistic prospects for
 development."  It added that "the final communique leaves no
 doubts that convergence or identity of views encompasses today
 more domains than ever before."  Predicting that bilateral
 cooperation "will now become still more dynamic," the government
 paper observed that "for us, it is very important that-the circle
 of our friends and allies in our common struggle is gettirg
 stronger and wider."
 Comment in Yugoslav media has been more restrained.  A Belgrade
 domestic service commentator remarked on the 24th that "no
 exceptional efforts" in Warsaw were required "to find a common
 language on all problems of common interest and to leave aside
 the differences which exist and are natural."  Noting that "some
 circles, West as well as East," are speculating "whether
 Yugoslavia is crossing over to the East," the commentator
 emphasized that "nonalined socialist Yugoslavia goes along its
 well-known internal and international paths."
 The Belgrade radio's program in Russian to the USSR on the 23d,
 in positively appraising the Tito-Gierek talks, noted at ..ac
 same time that "there were some subtle differences in their
 views."  The broadcast snidely remarked that "it is obviously
 not as clear to Poland as it is to Yugoslavia that the situation
 in the Mediterranean region has an effect on the state of
 relations in Europe," based on the Yugoslav view of the
 "indivisibility of peace."
 MOSCOW COVERAGE     TASS on the 23d carried a terse account of
 the Tito-Gierek communique, touching on its
 main points and citing its praise for President Nixon's Moscow
 and Warsaw visits while omitting all the passages indicating the
 degree of agreement reached in the Polish-Yugoslav talks.

 from Belgr'de on Yugoslavia's relations with CEMA--a subject

 "TANJUG on Yugoslavia's Cooperation with the CEMA countries,"
 the dispatch quoted the Yugoslav news agency on Belgrade's
 "interest" in intensifying its relations with the Soviet bloc
 economic organization "in accordance with its national  nd
 economic interests, sociopolitical system, and nonalinement

 Moscow on 29 June.

 MIDDLE EAST
 BREZFNEV ASKS ISRAELI WITFORAWAL; USSkk bCURES RAIDS ON LEBANON
 Brezhnev touched on the "couplex end dangerous" Middle East
 situation in a scant three sentences in his 27 June speech at
 the dinner for Fidel Castro.  The problem, he said, "can and
 must be" dealt with on the basis of Arab demands for withdrawal
 of the "aggressor's troops"--he did not specify withdrawal frog.
 "all" occupied territory--and fulfillment of Security Council
 Resolution 242.  Brezhnev made ao mention of the Jarring mission,
 supported in the Soviet-American communique on the Moscow summit.
 Nor did he offer the customary assurance of Moscow's "invariable
 assistance and support" to the Arabs, as he had done in his
 5 June dinner speech during Tito's visit.  .He routinely accused
 Israel of persisting in its "policy of conquest" but did not
 refer to the Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon beginning on
 the 21st.
 Soviet propaganda has denounced Israel's military operations,
 charging Tel Aviv with trying to sow discord between the Lebanese
 and the Palestinian fedayeen and with seeking to thwart any
 efforts leading toward a peaceful solution.  Noting reports of
 future U.S. military deliveries to Israel, Moscow claimed that
 Israel marks new arms deliveries by "increasing its anti-Arab
 action."  Speaking in the Security Council debate, Soviet
 representative Malik, according to TASS on the 24th, complained
 of Israel's new "acts of aggression at a time when in '?'ie
 international situation as a whole, positive phenomena" conducive
 to relaxation of international tensions have begun to appear.
 Malik added that this atmosphere might contribute to resumption
 of the Jarring mission aimed at a peaceful political settlement
 of the Middle East dispute.  Explaining the Soviet vote on the
 Security Council resolution adopted on the 26th, Malik said the
 USSR would have liked a "tougher" resolution but voted for the
 draft "despite its shortcomings" in view of the urgency of the
 question.
 PEKING'S POSITION     NCNA on 28 June reported PRC representative
 Huang Hua's explanation in the Security
 Council of Chinese reservations regarding "unsatisfactory"
 phrases in the resolution adopted on the 26th, as well an his
 assertion that Israel's "premeditated act of aggression" should
 "logically" be condemned whereas "it is perfectly just" for the

 resolution was adopted with two abstentions, by the United
 States and Panama, NCNA observed that U.S. delegate Bush had
 tabled a draft resolution which was "seemingly fair" but in fact
 favored Israel.  TABS described the U.S. draft as reflecting a
 fish, "if not to exonerate Israel," at least to equate the
 aggressor with its victims.

 CUBA-PERU
 CUBA WELCOMES PERUVIAN MOVE TO RESTORE RELATIONS
 An official statement declaring that the Cuban Government is
 "most gratified and receptive to the noble and worthy initiative
 of the Peruvian Government and its president, General Velasco
 Alvarado," keynoted Havana's prompt and enthusiastic welcome of
 President Velasco's 20 June announcement that Peru "will soon
 initiate direct negotiations with the Cuban Government leading
 to the prompt reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the
 two countries."  The Peruvian initiative came in the wake of the
 adverse vote on 8 June in the Organization of American States (OAS)
 on Peru's proposal to repeal the 1964 anti-Cuban OAS resolution
 and allow each member nation to establish the kind of relationship
 it desires with Cuba.  Both Cuba and Peru have interpreted the
 U.S. failure to obtain a two-thirds vote against the Peruvian
 resolution as an indication that the 1964 resolution--which
 required a two-thirds vote for adoption--no longer has sufficient
 support within the OAS to be sustained.
 GOVERNMENT STATEMENT     Following initial publicity for Velasco's
 20 June announcement, frontpaged in the
 party organ GRANMA and further publicized in reports of Latin
 American reaction, Havana radio on the 23d broadcast the text
 of the government statement praising the Peruvian decision and
 emphasizing that Cuban receptivity to the resumption of diplomatic
 relations with Peru was fully in keeping with the stated Cuban
 position on "normalization" of relations with individual hemisphere
 governments.  Castro has repeatedly declared that the nature of
 Cuba's relationships with other Latin American governments is a
 function of their demonstration of independence from the United
 States.  Accordingly, the Cuban Government statement expressed
 Cuba's "deservedly high esteem" of the Peruvian initiative,
 "particularly inasmuch as it is in keeping with that country's
 sovereignty and thus constitutes a conduct of total national
 independence, removed from any foreign pressure."  The statement
 went on to recall Peruvian actions aimed at asserting control
 over the country's natural resources and at achieving economic
 independence; it singled out for special praise Velasco's
 contention that "the struggle for sovereignty is equivalent to
 the struggle against foreign economic domination."

 While noting that Cuba's support for measures designed to enhance
 Peru's national independence 'has not been conditioned by the
 existence of formal diplomatic relations," the Cuban statement
 asserted that "the development of fraternal relations of
 solidarity" among the Latin American people and nations never-
 theless "can take place more closely and fully within the
 framework of official diplomatic relations."  It declared that
 "we shall respect Peru's position as Peru has respected ours"
 and that "the Cuban people extend their hand to shake Peru's
 extended fraternal hand."
 In a restatement of Cuban policy that can be construed as an
 invita..ion to other "revolutionary" and "independent" Latin
 American governments to follow Peru's lead, the statement
 affirmed that Cuba will "be consistent with our policy of
 absolute respect for those Latin American governments that
 have maintained toward Cuba a position of mutual respect for
 the development of the Cuban revolution without complicity with
 the policy of imperialism."  GRANMA on 12 June, in an editorial
 on the OAS vote on the Peruvian resolution, had recalled the
 Cuban Government's "clearcut policy" of readiness "to establish
 relations with those governments which are independent and
 ready to express and demonstrate their conduct in accordance
 with authentic expressions of national sovereignty and independence."
 For 'dell over a year, Cuban spokesmen have pictured the Peruvian
 Government as one in which positive revolutionary processes were
 occurring.  In his 10th Bay of Pigs anniversary speech on 19 April
 1971, Castro cited specific nationalistic actions of the Peruvian
 Government and declared that "a real change in that country's
 structures" was taking place; although "one cannot speak about a
 Marxist-Leninist revolution in Peru," he said, "from the viewpoint
 of revolutionary theory one can speak objectively about a
 revolutionary process in Peru."  He characterized the Peruvian
 process in virtually identical terms in his 26 July 1971 speech
 marking the 18th anniversary of the assault on the Moncada barracks,
 adding that "the Peruvian revolutionary movement is in full swing."
 And at a press conference on 4 December during his brief stopover
 in Lima on his return trip from Chile, Castro asserted--as reported
 by Lima's EXPRESO--that "we esteem our relations with Peru, because
 we realize that it has a truly sovereign, independent government."
 On the question of formal relations, he said "we shall await the
 time when the Peruvian Government deems it feasible and useful to
 the interests of the nation to establish relations with Cuba."

 28 JUNE 1972
 OAS VOTE     Reacting to the 8 June OAS vote on the Peruvian
 resolution to allow member states to reestablish
 relations with Cuba at the level they desire, Havana's reportage
 and comment combined continued denunciations of the "U.S.-
 controlled" OAS and further disclaimers of Cuban interest in
 rejoining the organization with applause for the "independence"
 shown by the seven nations which voted for the resolution.
 Cuban media interpreted the 7-13-3 vote as a victory for the
 pro-Cuban forces, constituting in affect a renunciation of the
 1964 resolution applying sanctions to Cuba.  Thus a 12 June
 GRANMA editorial noted that "from a judicial point of view . . .
 it is proper to point out that the stability of the two-thirds
 of the votes--essentially required in order to ratify the
 sanctions adopted against Cuba in 1964--has ceased to exist
 in the OAS, because 23 governments now constitute its membership."
 While denouncing the OAS, the editorial declared that the Cuban
 Government "nevertheless respects the initiative of the Peruvian
 Government because it finds this to be an act of good faith,
 taken independently"; it added that "the same thing can be said"
 of the other governments voting for the Peruvian proposal.
 The same interpretation of the OAS vote was suggested in PRENSA
 LATINA's reports of reaction to the ballotting.  Quoting the
 Communist Party of Argentina's organ NUESTRA PALABRA, PRENSA
 LATINA on the 13th reported that the vote "did not result in
 the ratification of the diplomatic and commercial isolation
 of Cuba ordered by the inter-American organization in 1964
 under U.S. pressure."  And a PRENSA LATINA disratch from
 Caracas on the same day cited the Venezuelan Communist Party
 organ TRIBUNA POPULAR for the conclusion that as a result of
 the vote "any country that wishes to maintain full ties with
 the socialist island may do so," since "currently the OAS does
 not have a two-thirds majority--16 votes--to sustain the
 diplomatic boycott applied against Cuba in 1964."
 In a similar vein, domestic service commentator Guido Garcia
 Inclan declared on the 13th that the United States "did not
 realize that as a result of that vote, the most honorable
 nations would be free to do as they please with their
 independence."  He added:  "All this means that our sister
 nations will begin to reestablish relations with Cuba .    .
 of their own free will."

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 GOSPLAN OFFICIAL URGES REORGANIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL ORGANS
 In the June issue of PLANNED ECONOMY, Gosplan first deputy chair-
 man for agriculture T.Z. Sokolov criticizes the agriculture
 ministry as incapable of leading farms and proposes a reorganiza-
 tion based on specialized associations, a national system of
 sovkhozes, and kolkhoz councils equipped with administrative
 powers.  Though somewhat vague, Sokolov's proposals are the most
 explicit indication of current official thinking on agriculture,
 and they are notably in accord with PRAVDA's 5 June editorial
 praise of sovkhoz ministries, kolkhoz councils, and specialized
 trusts and associations.
 Sokolov's proposals are in many respects reminiscent of Khrushchev's
 controversial initiatives.  They appear to threaten the powers of
 the agriculture ministry which were reduced by Khrushchev and
 partially restored after his fall.  Although Sokolov points out
 that the agriculture ministry is currently incapable of effective
 leadership, his solution is not to strengthen the ministry but to
 further reduce its power by transferring all sovkhozes to a national
 system of sovkhozes.  He also favors granting kolkhoz councils
 some of the executive powers currently exercized by the agriculture
 ministry and once envisaged for the abortive kolkhoz unions
 advocti~.ed by Khrushchev and his proteges.
 Sokolov was appointed first deputy chairman of Gosplan in the
 spring of 1970 when Brezhnev was pressing for increased allocations
 to agriculture.  He entered his new job with a notable warning
 against attempts to divert money from agriculture (PLANNED ECONOMY,
 September 1970).  Since his appointment, as his current article
 indicates, Gosplan has altered its planning procedures to improve
 rural construction and give preference to manufanture of agricul-
 tural equipment and fertilizer.
 CENSURE OF MINISTRY     Sokolov states that "it is quite difficult
 for the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and
 its local organs in their present form to concretely lead the
 complicated, multibranch kolkhoz-sovkhoz production and the huge
 network of various kinds of organizations, establishments and
 enterprises."  While calling the rayon agriculture administration
 the "main link in agricultural leadership," Sokolov criticizes its
 handling of the planning and organization of production, use of

 new equipment, material-technical supply, and financing.  And
 he goes on to assert that the oblas. agriculture administration
 as well "does not have the necessary rights and opportunities
 for proper leadership of production activities of sovkhozes and
 kolkhozes."
 As one remedy Sokolov proposes the establishment of a national
 system of sovkhozes.  Noting that sovkhozes are administered by
 republic sovkhoz ministries in five republics, Sokolov writes
 that "apparently, one should attentively study their experience
 in order to more correctly decide the question of administering
 sovkhoz production from bottom to top."  Sokolov's proposal
 reinforces earlier indications of effo-ts to weaken the agricul-
 ture ministry through the creation of union-republic ministries
 of sovkhozes.  In August 1970 an Azerbaydzhan Ministry of
 Sovkhozes was established, and Azerbaydzhan First Secretary
 G.A. Aliyev said that it would be "subordinated to the Azerbaydzhan
 Council of Ministers and USSR Ministry of Agriculture" (BAKINSKIY
 RABOCHIY, 13 August 1970).  However, on 23 December 1970 the
 ministry was changed to a union-republic ministry (BAKINSKIY
 RABOCHIY, 25 December 1970), suggesting that .t would eventually
 be subordinated to a similar USSR ministry rather than to the
 USSR Ministry of Agriculture.  Similar union-republic sovkhoz
 ministries were subsequently established in Georgia in December
 1970, Uzbekistan in January 1971, and the RSFSR in February 1972.
 A 17 February 1972 Moscow radio broadcast revealed that the 9,700
 sovkhozes in the RSFSR, then mostly under the jurisdiction of the
 agriculture ministry and its local organs, would be transferred
 to the new sovkhoz ministry.
 KOLKHOZ COUNCILS     As another remedy Sokolov favors empowering
 the kolkhoz councils formed in 1969 with
 administrative powers similar to those envisaged by advocates of
 the abortive kolkhoz unions.  He notes that the kolkhoz councils
 now have only a "consultative character and do not possess the
 rights of administration" and observes that "competent kolkhoz
 organs could more efficiently plan production, dispose of material-
 technical and financial resources, ensure observance of the
 Kolkhoz Charter, and decide all questions of organization of
 production."  Although Sokolov has never publicly endorsed
 kolkhoz unions, he was a member of the USSR Council on Kolkhoz
 Affairs, which administered kolkhozes independently of the
 agriculture ministry from 1946 until Stalin's death.

 USSR Minister of Agriculture V.V. Matekevich "as o-ienly opposed
 the creation of kolkhoz unions with administrative powers--a
 move that would weaken the power, of his ministry.  His opposition
 prevailed during the debates of the 1950's and 1960'a, and when a
 system of kolkhoz councils was eventually established in 1969, it
 was stipulated that the new organs would have no administrative
 or even coordinating powers.  Moreover, Matekevich was made
 chairman of the All-Union Council of Kolkhozes and the councils
 were placed under the control of the agriculture ministry and
 its local organs.
 Since the formation of the kolkhoz councils, grass-roots complaints
 about their limited powers have appeared from time to time--by
 I. Vinnichenko in LITERARY RUSSIA, 10 July and 18 September 1970;
 M. Kovalenko in KOMMUNIST, March 1971; kolk!:oz chairmen in
 IZVESTIYA, 23 January 1971; aid Yu. I. Krasnopoyas in the ECONOMIC
 SERIES OF THE USSR ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, No. 1, 1971.  On the other
 hand, the councils have been criticized by officials in the agri-
 culture ministry for "issuing orders to kolkhozes"--by V. Filimonov
 in AGRICULTURE OF RUSSIA, March 1971, and L. Zaytsev and A. Ivanov
 in ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE, June 1971.  The agriculture ministry
 tightened its control over the council in March 1971 by the
 adoption of a new statute even more specifically defining the
 consultative functions of the councils (ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE,
 June 1971).
 SPECIALIZED      Sokolov has high praise for "specialized adminis-
 ASSOCIATIONS                              tration of agricultural enterprises" and in this
 connection cites the work of the USSR Main
 Administration for the Poultry Industry (Ptitseprom), the RSFSR
 Main Administration for Meat Sovkhozes and Livestock Production
 (Skotoprom), and intersovkhoz and interkolkhoz production associa-
 tions.  He states that the experience of such associations should
 be studied with an eye toward "a transition in the future to
 administration through specialized organs operating on principles
 of cost accounting."  The 5 June PRAVDA editorial on "New Forms
 of Agricultural Administration" also praised sovkhoz ministries,
 kolkhoz councils, and specialized trusts and singled out Ptitseprom
 in particular.  The status of the latter may have been enhanced by
 the recent appointment of RSFSR deputy agriculture minister
 I.A. Bakhtin to head it (identified in the 16 June PRAVDA).
 This proposal, like the others, represents a revival of a
 Khrushchev initiative.  Khrushchev's last proposed reform
 involved the reorganization of agriculture into specialized

 nationill administrations.  Despite objections that this would
 split agriculture up into narrow incoordinated branches,
 Khrushchev publicly stated that his proposal would be discussed
 at a plenum in November 1964 (PRAVDA, 10 August 1964).  Ptitseprom,
 which now is winning high praise, is the only specialized associa-
 tion Khrushchev managed to create before his overthrow.  Skotoprom
 is the creation of former RSFSR Premier Voronov, who established
 it in late 1969 to administer his meat cattle program.
 PRAVDA ARTICLE JUSTIFIES UNEQUAL INVESTMENTS IN REPUBLICS
 An unusually defensive article on nationality policy in PRAVDA on 22
 June arg:ces that union republics must not insist on obtaining
 equal shape;: of investment funds and must allow Moscow to develop
 some areas Aister than others, thus implying that there have been
 complaints of this matter.  The author of the article, E. Bagramov,
 explains that while "all republics possess equal rights," some
 have varying natural resources and opportunities and produce
 unequal national income, and that "such differences are unavoidable."
 Under present conditions, Bagramov writes, no republic can use the
 "advantages of its geographical position or more significant
 economic potential" for itself; by means of central planning and
 the all-union budget, the national income is distributed to ensure
 development in the interests of "the entire Soviet people."
 "This feature of nationality policy," Bagramov points out, is
 reflected in the 1972 budget, which returns to Uzbekistan,
 Lithuania, Tadzhikistan, Armenia, and Turkmenia almost the full
 share of tax revenue produced by their repubics, while Kazakhstan
 is the most favored, receiving its entire tax revenue plus an
 additional 456-millicn-ruble subsidy from the national government.
 Eagramov does not mention the more advanced republics which
 presumably are less favored by the budget.  At the same time,
 however, he declares that allocation of investments is no longer
 determined by the need to "overcome the economic backwardness of
 particular republics or regions because this problem is already
 resolved" and that state interests may dictate preferential
 investment in the formerly backward nationality areas or other
 regions.
 The most notable recent complaint about regional investment
 distribution came from the Ukrainian leaders in 1971.  At the
 24th Congress, then Ukrainian First Secretary Shelest complained
 that the Donets Basin coal industry was being developed at

 "extremely low rates," with only two new mines opened in the
 last five years; he also attacked those who had reduced coal
 industry development in favor of gas and oil (PRAVDA, I April
 1971).  Donetsk First Secretary V.I. Degtyarev eagerly backed
 Shalest's demand for accelerated development (PRAVDA, 6 April
 1971).  Subsequc tly, the CPSU Central Committee and USSR
 Council of Minis, ru adopted a decree "On Measures to Further
 Develop the Coal Industry of the Donets Basin" providing for
 doubling of investments in order to rebuild present mines and
 open new mines (Degtyarev in the 18 April 1972 PRAVDA UKRAINY
 and Ukrainian Coal Minister M.M. Khudosovtsev in the 18 September

 PRC AND ENVIRONMENT
 PEKING ELABORATES VIEWS ON ENVIRONMENT AT LIV CONFERENCE
 Peking used the occasion of the first UN Conference on the Human
 Environment in Stockholm on 5-16 June to make its most com?re-
 hensive. statement on world environment problems.  As elaborated
 by chief PRC delegate Tang Ke in a major address on 10 June,
 Peking's approach demonstrated an intention to tailor its
 environment policy to meet its political needs as a leading
 spokesman of the third world and its pressing economic needs as
 an underdeveloped nation for relatively unrestricted industrial
 development.  At the same time Peking sought to place the onus
 for damage to the world environment on the developed nations,
 particularly adapting this line to its campaign against tie two
 ouperpowers.  The Stockholm conference also served as a forum
 for Peking to defend its nuclear weapons program in an attempt
 to neutralize criticism of China's continued atmospheric tests.
 ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES     The PRC delegation at Stockholm placed
 the major responsibility for the
 "increasingly serious pollution and damage of the human environ-
 ment" on the superpowers while defending the interests of
 underdeveloped countries in rapid industrial development.  Stating
 that countries damaged by big-power policies of "plunder,
 aggression, and war" have the right to apply sanctions and demand
 compensation, Tang cited in particular the "barbarous atrocities"
 .ommitted by the United States in Indochina, including its
 bombing, the alleged use of "toxic chemicals and poisonous gas,"
 the mining of DRV ports, and the alleged bombing of Red River
 dikes "to make a man-made flood catastrophe."
 Moving to the broader question of how international environmental
 safeguards should be formulated, the Chinese delegate made a
 pitch to the large third-world group at the conference by defending
 the right of all developing nations--including China--to relatively
 unrestricted industrial and economic development and by opposing
 any international environmental restraints that would limit these
 states' national sovereignty.  Thus, emphasizing that "only by
 building an independent national industry" can a country become
 strong and prosperous, he acknowledged that a certain amount of
 environmental damage will result but that the problem can be
 solved as stays advance in wealth and technology.  Attacking
 what he called the pessimistic view of the world environment
 situation, Tang stated that developing nations must not refrain

 from developing industry for fear of ecological damage; so long
 as states are independent of the interference of "imperialism,
 colonialism, and neocolonialism" and their governments
 "genuinely service the people," he asserted, problems arising
 from industrial development can be solved because mankind's
 ability to transform the environment will "grow continuously"
 as nations progress.
 Tang strongly warned against any efforts by the superpowers to
 subject other countries to their control under the guise of
 protecting the environment.  While not ruling out all inter-
 national restrictions, he emphasized that world environment
 measures should "respect the sovereignty and economic interests"
 of all countries, adling that each country has the right to
 determine its own standards in light of its own conditions.
 Turning to China's population problem, Tang attempted to justify
 the rapid growth since the communist takeover while explaining
 Peking's present approach to this vexing question.  Citing the
 improvement in Chinese living standards over the past two decades
 as proof for the Marxist thesis that mankind will create "ever
 greater quantities of wealth" to meet its needs, Tang also struck
 a pragmatic note by cautioning that the Chinese by no means
 approve of unch.:e_,'ad population growth but have advocated and
 implemented family planning measures that have produced "some
 effects."
 NUCLEAR WEAPONS     The consensus among participating nations
 in favor of a halt to nuclear testing posed
 the major problem for the Chinese at the conference.  The Chinese
 defensively and at length reaffirmed Peking's line on the need
 to develop nuclear weapons to counter the "nuclear blackmail"
 of the two superpowers.  Repeating Peking's call for a world
 summit conference to discuss the complete prohibition of nuclear
 weapons and, as a first step, "to reach agreement on the nonuse
 of nuclear weapons," Tang stressed Peking's pledge never to be
 the first to use nuclear weapons and called attention to the
 superpowers' refusal to undertake such a commitment.  Showing
 irritation over criticism of PRC atmospheric tests, he expressed
 regret that "some people" oppose all nuclear tests while
 ignoring the fact that the superpowers have stockpiled large
 quantities of nuclear weapons and "threaten the small and
 medium countries."
 NCNA reported on 14 June that the conference on that day adopted
 a resolution on the prohibition and condemnation of nuclear
 tests but that the PRC voted against the resolution.  A Chinese

 delegate reiterated Peking's line at the meeting that day.  Chief
 delegate Tang returned to the subject yet again on 16 June in
 connection with the discussion of the "declaration on the human
 environment."  Tang deplored the fact that the Chinese proposal
 on a complete prohibition of nuclear weapons was not written into
 the declaration "owing to the stubborn opposition and obstruction
 on the part of the superpowers and their extremely few followers."
 He singled out Japan and New Zealand for harboring "ulterior
 motives" in directing "the spearhead against China under the pre-
 text of preventing nuclear pollution," thereby "confusing public
 opinion and shielding the superpowers."  The PRC delegation
 announced that it would not take part in the voting on the
 declaration.
 In addition to parrying criticism of Chinese nuclear testing, the
 approach taken by the PRC at the conference had the effect of
 updating Peking's refusal to participate in the Soviet-proposed
 world disarmament conference or five-power nuclear conference as
 well as the Geneva disa'-iament talks.  The Chinese speakers
 made no reference to the agreements on limiting strategic arms
 reached at the Soviet-U.S. summit, a subject which Peking has
 mentioned directly only in a factual NCNA report on 2 June
 covering President Nixon's trip.  In rejecting calls for an end
 to nuclear tests and demanding a non-first-use agreement, Peking
 has sought to justify its continuing nuclear development program
 as well as its refusal to accede to partial disarmament measures
 which in its view leave the superpowers' nuclear strength intact
 vis-a-vis the PRC.*
 *  Peking's attitude toward the Moscow summit seems reflected
 in a recent article in RED FLAG (No. 6), the third of a series
 of articles discussing world history as a means of understanding
 the current international situation.  The article discussed
 efforts to limit the British-German naval arms race earlier
 this century and drew the conclusion that a temporary detent:z
 today will bring about an even greater rivalry tomorrow.

 CHINA
 RED FLAG STRESSES ATTENTION TO AGRICULTURE. LIGHT INDUSTRY
 An article in RED FLAG No. 6, broadcast by Radio Peking on
 22 June, firmly and unequivocally criticizes the view that
 most economic efforts and resources should be fed into heavy
 industry.  With reference perhaps to the views of the purged
 military leadership, the article gets in a dig at the military-
 industrial complex in criticiving "imperialist and social
 imperialist" countries where "industry, especially military
 industry, has developed abnormally" while agriculture has
 lagged behind.
 Carrying forward a line formulated by Mao in his "Contradictions"
 speech in 1957 but only recently revived in the wake of the
 purge of Lin Piao, the article stresses the interdependence of
 the three economic sectors of agriculture, light and heavy
 industry:  each supplies essential outputs to the others and
 one should not be developed at the expense of the others.  In an
 at.ampt to explain current policy to cadres who "view this situa-
 tion from a certain isolated case" and feel that more efforts
 to develop agriculture and light industry would adversely affect
 heavy industry, the article notes that in the short term in a
 particular instance the diversion of "manpower, funds, equipment,
 and materials" may cause apparent slowdowns in heavy industry but
 argues that in fact "this is not the case."  The article claims
 that once agriculture and light industry have developed, heavy
 industry can "develop better and at a quicker pace."
 That problems are being encountered in getting full compliance
 with the new line is evident in a warning to local industries
 that "funds, steel products, and other materials, which are to
 be used on agriculture according to plans, must be guaranteed
 and must not be misused or reduced."  The article states that
 "contrary to one's subjective wishes," shifting funds to heavy
 industry will not cause it to develop more quickly.  On the
 contrary, according to the article, "the development of agricul-
 ture and light industry will slow down, which in turn will
 result in a slower development of heavy industry."  Thus the
 slogan "give  first priority to developing heavy industry" is
 now interpreted as giving "adequate" attention to agriculture
 and light industry.

 The f3undation role of agriculture is repeatedly stressed, to
 the extc^t that the article states that "only after agriculture
 develops in a comprehensive way can industry, especially light
 industry, develop in a comprehensive way."   Calling the labor
 force the "most important productive `nrce," the article
 justifies a continuation of the movement of sending people
 to the countryside, arguing that production will be affected
 "if the increase in the industrial labor force and among the
 urban population has surpassed the limit permissible for the
 development of agriculture."  Therefore, population distribution
 planning must "consider first the needs of agricultural develop-
 ment, and then the needs of industrial development."
 The future path apparently envisaged by the article calls for
 increasing industrial development primarily through enhancing
 the quality, not quantity, of labor and equipment, thereby
 "supplying more industrial products to the state while not
 increasing investments or increasing investments to a lesser
 extent and not increasing the burden on agriculture."  The
 article concedes that in the long run production cannot be
 expanded without capital construction, and it seems to admit
 that some of the "contradictions" of resource allocation are
 real.  It states that "for a certain period, the scale of
 capital construction cannot . . . go beyond the permissible
 level of the development of agricultural production because
 of certain limits on manpower, materials, and funds."
 Criticizing "some comrades" who "invariably go after bigger
 projects," the article indicates that big projects which do
 not bear quick rewards must be discouraged, for they "inevitably
 consume manpower, funds, equipment, and materials" which are
 needed for developing agriculture.  This injunction may well
 not apply, however, to large state projects but onl:,,7 to local
 endeavors.
 In support of the theory that heavy industry-must not be
 allowed to crowd out agriculture and light industry, a SZECHW..N
 DAILY Commintator's article broadcast on 18 June revealed some
 details of the province's industrial development.  Criticizing
 the view of "some comrades" that "if heavy industry is not done
 well, then the whole situation will be affected," the article
 advocates more attention to light industry, which "not only
 meets the ,;:.;" irements of the people's daily life, but also
 ?            provides more accumulation more quickly."  According to the
 broadcast, past policies have resulted in light industrial

 development lagging "considerably behind" that of heavy industry
 even though funds accumulated by light industry over the past
 20 years have been 550 percent of the state investment in light
 industry and the surplus has supported heavy industry.
 The article also provides a further rationale for Szechwan to
 produce its own light industrial products in noting that since
 +echwan's population is great it has a "vast consumption."
 Sup~lying consumer products from otheb provinces places a burden
 not only on them but on the transportation system, "affecting
 the transport and supply of materials for heavy industrial con-
 struction and materials for agricultural production."  In addition,
 the article points out, long distance transport causes losses in
 quality and increases in cost.  And for any further doubters the
 article notes that self-sufficiency is an integral part of obeying
 Mao's dictum to "be prepared against war and famine."
