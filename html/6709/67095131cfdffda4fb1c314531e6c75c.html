 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE
 Extract of MEMCON dated May 5, 1971
 Ambassador Hilaly called today asking that the following information
 be passed to the President;
 The message which Dr. Kissinger gave him on April 28 was trans-
 mitted directly to President ?Yahya that same evening. President
 Yahya has cabled Hilaly confirming that Yahya personally conveyed
 the message to the Ambassador of Communist China on Saturday
 morning, May 1.  It most probably reached Chou-en-lai the same
 day or the following day.
 Ambassador Hilaly said that what he had told President Yahya on behalf
 of President Nixon on the basis of Dr. Kissinger's talk with him was as
 follows
 The President asked that the following message be passed to President
 Yahya:
 My warm thanks for the helpful role you have played.  I
 particularly appreciate the delicacy and tact with which you
 have handled these important exchanges.  Please thank
 Chou-en-lai for his message which I think is positive,
 constructive and forthcoming.  I will soon be replying to it
 in the same spirit.
 Ambassador Hilaly noted. further that Dr. Kissinger asked him to convey
 the following to Chou-en-lai stated as President Yahya's personal views:
 I feel that President Nixon is very anxious to handle these negotiations
 entirely by himself and not to let any politician come into the picture
 until a government-to-government channel is established.  My
 Ambassador in Washington thinks this is because President Nixon
 will find it more difficult to move quickly in the matter if American
 politicians come into it.  Therefore, it would be best until President
 Nixon's reply is received and an American envoy is designated for
 these discussions if the Chinese government would not discuss the
 matter with any American politician.  This does not mean that there
 is any objection to continuation of the People-to--People program.
 In fact, Ambassador Hilaly thinks that President Nixon would be
 very happy if every other kind of American visitor is encouraged
 to visit China- - students, reporters, scholars, etc. - - so this is a
 temporary thing until the official link is established..
 Ambassador Hilaly said that he received a telegram from President Yahya
 saying that the above was conveyed as suggested.

 President Nixon has carefully studied the message of April Z1,
 1971, from Premier Chou En-Lai conveyed through the courtesy of
 President Yahya Khan.  President Nixon agrees that direct high-level
 negotiations are necessary to resolve the issues dividing the United
 States of America and the People's Republic of China.  Because of the
 importance he attaches to normalizing relations between our two countries,
 President Nixon is prepared to accept the suggestion of Premier
 Chou En-Lai that he visit Peking for direct conversations with the
 leaders of the People's Republic of China.  At such a meeting each side
 would be free to raise the issue of principal concern to it.
 In order to prepare the visit by President Nixon and to establish
 reliable contact with the leaders of the Chinese People's Republic, President
 Nixon proposes a preliminary secret meeting between his Assistant for
 National Security Affairs, Dr. Kissinger and Premier Chou En-Lai
 or another appropriate high-level Chinese official.  Dr. Kissinger would be
 prepared to attend such a meeting on Chinese soil preferably at some
 location within convenient flying distance from Pakistan to be suggested
 by the People's Republic of China.  Dr. Kissinger would be authorized to
 discuss the circumstances which would make a visit by President Nixon
 most useful, the agenda of such a meeting, the time of such a visit and to
 begin a preliminary exchange of views on all subjects.of mutual interest.
 If it should be thought desirable that a special emissary come to Peking
 publically between the secret visit to the People's Republic of China of

 Dr. Kissinger and the arrival of President Nixon, Dr. Kissinger will
 be authorized to arrange it.  It is anticipated that the -visit of President
 Nixon to Peking could be announced within a short time of the secret
 meeting between Dr. Kissinger and Premier Chou En-Lai.  Dr. Kissinger
 will be prepared to come from June 15 onward.
 It is proposed that the precise details of Dr. Kissinger's trip
 including location, duration of stay, communication and similar matters
 be discussed through the good offices of President Yahya Khan.  For
 secrecy, it is essential that no other channel be used.  It is also under-
 stood that this first meeting between Dr. Kissinger and high officials of
 the People's Republic of China be strictly secret.

 MESSAGE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
 PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 In case the People's Republic of China has not been apprised,
 the United States Government wishes to inform it of the following state-
 ment made by the President of the United States on May 20, 1971:
 The Governments of the United States and the Soviet
 Union, after reviewing the course of their talks on the lim-
 itation of strategic armaments, have agreed to concentrate
 this year on working out an agreement for the limitation of
 the deployment.of anti-ballistic missile systems (ABM's).
 They have also agreed that, together with concluding an
 agreement to limit ABM's, they will agree on certain
 measures with respect to the limitation of offensive strategic
 weapons.
 '!The two sides are taking this course in the conviction
 that it will create more favorable conditions for further nego-
 tiations to limit all strategic arms.  These negotiations will

 'Premier Chou En Lai sincerely thanks His Excellency President
 Yahya Khan for most rapidly transmitting the three messages from President
 Nixon.
 "Premier Chou En Lai has seriously studied President Nixon's
 messages of April 29, May 17th and May 22nd 1971, and has reported with
 much pleasure to Chairman Mao Tse Tung that President Nixon is prepared
 to accept his suggestion to visit Peking for direct conversations with the
 leaders of the Peoples Republic of China.  Chairman Mao Tse Tung has
 indicated that he welcomes President Nixon's visit and looks forward to
 that occasion when he may have direct conversations with His Excellency
 the President, in which each side would be free to raise the principal issue
 of concern to it.  It goes without saying that the first question to be settled
 is the crucial issue between China and the United States which is the question
 of the concrete way of the withdrawal of all the U. S. Armed Forces from
 Taiwan and Taiwan Straits area.
 "Premier Chou En Lai welcomes Dr. Kissinger to China as the
 U. S. representative who will come in advance for a preliminary secret
 meeting with high level Chinese officials to prepare and make necessary
 arrangements for President Nixon's visit to Peking.
 'Premier Chou En Lai suggests that it would be preferable for
 Dr. Kissinger to set a date between June 15 and 20th for his arrival in

 China, and that he may fly direct from Islamabad to a Chinese airport not
 open to the public.  As for the flight, he may take a Pakistan Boeing aircraft
 or a Chinese special plane can be sent to fly him to and from China, if
 needed.  The talks plus the flights on both ways will probably take three or
 four days. If there is the desire to use his own telecommunication equipment
 on a temporary basis during his stay in China he may do so.
 "As it is difficult to keep Dr. Kissinger's trip strictly secret, he
 may well consider coming for the meeting in an open capacity.  If secrecy
 is still desired the Government of the Peoples Republic of China will on its
 part guarantee the strict maintenance of secrecy.  When the talks have
 yielded results, the two sides may agree to a public announcement to be made
 after the meeting, if it is so desired.
 "As for other details, they may be discussed and arranged through
 "Premier Chou En Lai warmly looks forward to the meeting with
 Dr. Kissinger in China in the near future. 11

 President Nixon has carefully reviewed the May 29, 1971,
 message from Premier Chou en-Lai which President Yahya Khan so
 kindly conveyed.  President Nixon looks forward with great pleasure
 to the opportunity of a personal meeting and discussions with the
 leaders of the People's Republic of China.
 The President appreciates the warm welcome extended by
 Premier Chou en-Lai to his personal representative, Dr. Kissinger.
 Because of the shortness of time available and the need to arrange a
 suitable pretext for his travel, Dr. Kissinger now finds it impossible
 to leave Washington before the first week of July.  Accordingly,
 President Nixon proposes that Dr. Kissinger arrive in China on July 9
 and leave on July 11, flying in a Pakistani Boeing aircraft from
 Islamabad to Peking.
 Dr. Kissinger will be authorized to discuss all issues of
 'concern to both countries preliminary to President Nixon's visit to
 China, and to make all arrangements for the President's visit.
 Dr. Kissinger will not require his own telecoxximunication equipment.
 lt'is envisaged that four members of his personal staff will accompany
 President Nixon appreciates the fact that the Government
 of the People's Republic of China will maintain strict secrecy

 with respect to Dr. Kissinger's visit and considers this essential.
 Dr. Kissinger will be authorized to settle on a possible communique
 .to be issued sometime after his return to the United States if this is
 mutually desired.
 Dr. Kissinger warmly looks forward to his visit to China and
 to his meeting with Premier Chou en-Lai.  President Nixon considers
 this trip a very positive first step in improving relations between the
 United States and the People's Republic of China.

 I was sumrnoncd to the Nkli ite I-louse by Mr Kissinger
 this morning at 11 a. m.  I?Ie told me. that in reply to the inessnge
 sent by Pre?iicr Chou en.-Lai through our President which I
 conveyed to him on the. 9th D cccrnber, President Nixon would like
 to send a fresh message to President Yahya for passing it on to
 the Chinese Prime Minister. (he presumed this ?wo.lld be through
 the Chinese Ambassador in Pakistan).  He then gave me an unsigned
 note in an envelope.  When I asked. him what it contained he said
 that in response to Chou en Laps suggestion that a special
 representative of President Nixon would be welcome in Peking
 to discuss the question of Taiwan, President Nixon wished to
 inform Premier, Chou en Lai that the U. S. Government was prepared
 to attend a preliminary meeting at an early date in a location
 convenient to bo?1i sides to discuss what 4*!r- arrangements could
 or should be made for sending a U. S. delegation to Faking for
 high level discussions.  In reply to questions from me, Mr
 Kissinger said that the preliminary meeting could take place in
 Rawalpindi if General Yahya's government would not be embarrassed
 in any way by it.  From the U. S. side the representatives could
 be, Ambassador Murphy or Mr Dewey or Ambassador David Bruce.
 Or it could also be himself.  (He could arrange to pay a visit to
 Vietnam and under that cove, arrange a halt in Pakistan for
 the purpose of meeting; the a-;nese representative. It would
 depend on what kind of official the Chinese would send to Pakistan
 for this purpose).

 FROM:                              ALEXANDER M. HAIG
 SUBJECT:                           China
 Pakistani Ambassador Hilaly visited today, in Henry's absence,
 and asked that the following information be passed to you:
 "The message which Dr. Kissinger gave him on April 28
 was transmitted directly to President Yahya that same
 evening.  President Yahya has cabled Hilaly confirming
 that Yahya personally conveyed the message to the
 Ambassador of Communist China on Saturday morning,
 May 1.  It most probably reached Chou-en-lai the same
 day or the following day. "
 Hilaly stated he wanted this message conveyed because of the
 criticism from Peking against your Administration, reported in
 this morning's press.  He stated that in his view, while Peking had
 received your message of April 28th, they were already reacting to
 two things :
 The State Department  spokesman's statement that
 the two Chinas could negotiate their problems with each other, and
 Secretary Rogers' statement in London.
 79 ?.6.9'
 Ambassador Hilaly said that he had sent a telegram to President
 Yahya Friday morning after the press conference, saying that your
 statement of Thursday evening appeared to be an effort to correct
 the damage done by Secretary Rogers.  Ambassador Hilaly recom-
 mended that Yahya pass on this interpretion to the Chinese Ambassador.
 Hilaly also confirmed that a message had been conveyed to the Chinese
 to the effect that your hands would be tied if other American politicians

 are brought into the matter of U. S. -Peking relations.  Therefore,
 it would be best if the Chinese Government would not discuss the
 matter with any other American politician until a solid government-to-

 there is any objection from here to the continuation of the people-to-
 people program and we would welcome invitations to other kinds of
 American visitors - students, reporters, scholars, etc.

 Meeting with Ambassador Farland,
 May 7, 1971
 On Friday, May 7, I met for three hours with Ambassador Farland
 in Palm Springs.  At that time, I outlined the exchange of messages
 between the U. S. and China that has taken place through the Pakistanis,;
 I read portions of the most recent message delivered by Ambassador
 Hilaly on April Z1 and told Ambassador Farland that you intended to
 respond by proposing that I meet with Chou en-Lai, or a suitable
 Chinese representative, either in Pakistan or at a location in southern
 China easily accessible from Pakistan.  We considered a number of
 details associated with the trip And reached some tentative deci io as.
 ~w After reviewing several alternative communication channels,
 we agreed to place a special Navy communicator in Karachi to provide
 a communications channel similar to the one I have set up with 13a.hr
 and Rush.  This should be operational this week.
 -- I discussed with Ambassador Farland my proposed trip
 itinerary which would provide for an arrival in Islamabad on a Friday,
 at which point he or Yahya could arrange to host me for the weekend.
 This would provide the cover for my meeting with the Chinese, and on
 Monday I would continue on to Tehran.  I indicated that I would probably
 require about 24 hours with the Chinese and would plan on meeting in
 three separate sessions.
 -- Ambassador Farland felt that it would be better to be taped
 by the Chinese than the Pakistanis, and for this reason the meeting should
 be conducted in southern China rather than Pakistan.
 - ; We discussed the relative merits of my traveling to China by
 Pakistani, Chinese or U. S. aircraft and tentatively decided that the
 optimum arrangement would be to pre-position a smaller White House

 permit the larger aircraft in which I arrive to remain parked at
 Rawalpindi over the weekend in public view.
 --  I instructed Ambassador Farland to discuss our meeting
 and my proposed trip with Yahya and made him responsible for all the
 technical details of the trip.  He will submit for my review several
 possible scenarios for the China meeting as soon as the special communi-
 cations channel is activated.
 Ambassador Farland made several more general points:
 He was sharply critical of Ambassador Keating who, in his
 view, is attempting to make a partisan issue of the Pakistani situation
 and discredit the Administration in the process.  Ambassador Keating
 apparently called in a New York Times correspondent and divulged the
 contents of the Blood cables, and Ambassador Farland feels that
 Ambassador Keating will use his trip back to Washington to lobby
 against your Pakistan policies.
 -- Ambassador Farland stressed his conviction that it will take
 a substantial (i. e., $250 million) loan to sustain Pakistan for another
 six months and he requested support in obtaining a commitment from
 the World Bank or IMF.  As a related matter, Ambassador Farland
 asked that Hannah be told inta forceful way that you want him to adopt
 a positive attitude toward Pakistan for at least the next six months.
 -- Ambassador Farland also felt that Germany, Great Britain
 -and possibly also Japan should be apprised of our determination to save
 Pakistan and asked to adjust their policies to support our position.
 A full record of the meeting is attached at Tab A.

 (Home of Mr. Theodore Cummings)
 Participants:
 Farland replied that although he thought it would be possible, there
 are some real problems to contend with:
 Joseph S. Farland, U. S. Ambassador to Pakistan
 Henry A. Kissinger, Assistant to the President
 for National Security Affairs
 David R. Halperin (notetaker)
 After an exchange of pleasantries, Ambassador Farland stated that
 the State Department had accepted his cover story without question.
 Mr. Kissinger expressed appreciation for the cables sent by
 Ambassador Farland, and for .his loyalty over the past weeks.
 Mr. Kissinger then stated that McNamara was preparing to submit a
 devastating report concludiig that it would take $250 million to give
 Pakistan breatingroom; he then asked' Ambassador Farland whether
 it is, in fact, possible to provide breating room, and whether $Z50
 million is a realistic estimate of the support required.! Ambassador
 ?.?    Ambassador Keating seems to have gone berserk; he has
 violated security and appears deterrninedto break Pakistan.  For
 example, he recently called in a New York Times reporter and,
 although he did not release the text, he did tell him the essence of
 Blood's report.  Ambassador Farland is convinced that Keating is
 determined to make a political issue out of the Pakistani situation,
 and is attempting to discredit the Administation in the process.
 Another problem is the quality of political reporting in
 Dacca.  The reporters there are missionaries without significant
 practical experience.  They have never before seen war and are grossly
 exaggerating the amount of killing and bloodshed there.

 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/NODIS
 Moving to the primary item of business, Mr. Kissinger explained to
 Ambassador Farland that for some time, we have been passing
 messages to the Chinese through the Pakistanis.  Because of the
 communications problem, it had not been possible to inform Ambassador
 Farland of this previously, and messages have been conveyed directly
 to Yahya by the President, or through Ambassador Hilaly.  Mr. Kissinger
 then outlined the exchange of messages that has occurred to date:
 The channel was established in August, 1969. At that
 time, while visiting Pakistan, the President indicated to President
 Yahya (and Mr. Kissinger told the former Air Force Chief of Staff)
 that the United States desired to normalize relations with China.
 w   President Yahya then called in the Chinese Ambassador
 who thanked him for his interest and indicated that China would be'
 interested in hearing something positive..
 Mr. Kissinger then told Hilaly that we would remove two
 destroyers from the Taiwan Straits as a gesture of good will.  (In
 point of fact, this had already been decided for budgetary reasons. )
 The Chinese responded by releasing two American
 Two days or a week later, the Chinese told Yahya that
 they were willing to resume talks in Warsaw.  They also expressed
 concern about the Japanese.
 In a subsequent message delivered by Yahya, it was said
 that a war between China and the U. S. is seen now as a very remote
 .passibility.
 For a while, the Rumanian channel was used; then,  when
 Yahya came to the U. S. in October, the President suggested to him
 that the Chinese could begin talking to us in secure channels.
 On December 9, 1970, the Chinese replied as follows :
 (Dr. Kissinger stressed that this must be treated with the greatest
 sensitivity) :

 "This (meaning the reply) is not from me
 alone but from Chairman Mao and Vice
 Chairman Lin Piao as well.  China has always
 been willing and has always tried to negotiate

 by peaceful means..  A special envoy of
 President Nixon's will be most welcome
 in Peking.  We have had messages from the
 United States from different sources in the
 past, but this is the first time that the
 proposal has come from a Head, through a
 Head, to a Head. "
 contact -- the subsequent one to be with the,President himself.
 ..~    We replied in early January:  "In the light of the remarks
 of Premier Chou En-Lai to President Yahya, as well as the continuing
 United States interest in U. S. -China discussions at a higher level, the
 United States Government believes it would be useful to begin discussions
 with a view of bringing about a higher level meeting in Peking.  The
 meeting in Peking would not be limited to the Taiwan question but would
 encompass other steps designed to improve relations and reduce tensions.
 The United States therefore proposed that representatives of the two
 Governments meet at an early convenient moment in a location con-
 venient to both sides to discuss the modalities of the higher-level
 meeting.  These modalities would include the size of the delegations,
 the duration of the meeting, the agenda and a clear understanding on
 the status and amenities which the U. S. delegation would enjoy while
 in the People's Republic of China. "  Orally, we suggested that the
 preliminary meeting be in Pakistan.
 ...~    Last week, we received from Ambassador Hilaly a
 message probably written by the Chinese:  "The Chinese Government
 reaffirms its willingness to receive publically in Peking a Special Envoy
 of the President of the U. S. (for instance, Mr. Kissinger) or the U. S.
 Secretary of State or even the President of the U. S. himself for a direct
 meeting and discussions.  Of course, if the U. S. President considers
 that the time is not yet ripe, the matter may be deferred to a later date.
 As for the modalities, procedure and other details of the high-level
 meeting and discussions in Peking, as they are of no substantive signifi-
 cance, it is believed that it is entirely possible for proper arrangements
 to be made through the good offices of President Yahya Khan. "
 Mr. Kissinger stressed that these developments could be of great
 diplomatic significance, both with respect to Vietnam and the Soviet
 Union.  Because (outside of the President), Mr. Kissinger is the only
 person who can talk to the Chinese understanding all of the inter-related
 aspects of the negotiations, it is desired that Mr. Kissinger be the first

 -~    Mr. Kissinger stated that we intend to reply that the
 U.S. -is prepared to talk on all outstanding issues and cannot confine
 the meeting to one topic.  Each side will be free to raise whatever
 issues are of concern to them.  The President is prepared to go to
 Peking, but there should be a preliminary secret meeting between
 Mr. Kissinger and Chou En-Lai at which time Mr. Kissinger will be
 empowered to select a time and the general circumstances of a
 Presidential visit    possibly next year.
 Mr. Kissinger then indicated to Ambassador Farland that the President
 will not go to Peking unless Vietnam is concluded.  Mr. Kissinger will
 propose to meet with Chou En-Lai or his representative either in
 Pakistan or a location in Southern China which is easily accessible
 from Pakistan.
 TECHNICAL DETAILS OF MEETING
 Mr. Kissinger and Ambassador Farland proceeded to discuss a number
 of technical details related to the meeting between Mr. Kissinger and
 the Chinese.
 Mr. Kissinger stated that Ambassador Farland would receive a copy
 of everything given to Yahya.

 25X1
 Mr.  Ussinger asked 'Ambassador
 Farland if he thought Hilaly would permit our messages to be ready by
 the foreign office.  Ambassador Farland thought there was no danger
 of this since, in his view, Hilaly does not trust either his staff or the
 foreign office.
 Mr. Kissinger next raised the question of whether our next message
 should be delivered to Yahya through Hilaly or through Ambassador
 East-West crisis.
 Mr. Kissinger asked Ambassador Farland whether it would be possible
 to get to Pakistan without attracting attention.  The Ambassador felt
 that a visit by Mr. Kissinger could be easily explained in terms of the
 Mr. Kissinger next questioned whether it would be better to meet in
 Pakistan where the Pakistanis would tape the meeting -.. or in China

 where the Chinese would do the taping.  Ambassador Farland felt
 the litter would be preferable, and Mr. Kissinger agreed.
 Mr. Kissinger outlined a proposed itinerary in which he would go to
 Vietnam on an inspection trip, stop in Bangkok, New Delhi, Islamibad
 on Friday, have Ambassador Farland take him off for the weekend --
 and then go to Southern China for roughly 24 hours.  Mr. Kissinger
 stated he would then go on to Tehran on Monday.  He will probably
 travel in one of the large Presidential aircraft -- possibly Air Force 2.
 Mr. Kissinger asked if there were an American Press Corps in
 Rawalpindi; Ambassador Farland said there was one fellow named
 Zeiber.
 Mr. Kissinger suggested that he could say he was going to the Khyber
 Pass or to the hill station, and Ambassador Farland could cover for
 him.  Ambassador Farland stated that Yahya has a summer house
 which could be used; it would be best if President Yahya invited
 Mr. Kissinger there for the weekend.  Ambassador Farland stated
 that the Chinese have an airfield just the other side of the mountains
 which could be used for the meeting.
 COMMUNICATIONS
 IL
 Mr. Kissinger stated there were several possible channels which he
 could use in communicating with Ambassador Farland:,f
 -    Navy Channel ending in Karachi (a commercial plane
 .would have to be used to get the message up to Rawalpindi, however).
 25X1 X1
 Ambassador Farland could be shown how to use one-time
 pads (however, encryption and de-cryption each take about four hours).
 The Ambassador felt the Navy channel would probably
 be best; in his own office only his (non-State Department) secretary 25X1

 would handle the messages.  Ambassador Farland felt it would be
 best to have the special Navy communicator in Karachi where the
 Attache is stationed.                                                     25:25X1
 could probably be used occasionally, and that he would have the
 Navy Channel set up by next week (Monday, if possible), after Admiral
 Moorer clears the Attache (named Dros).
 TRANSPORTATION ARRANGEMENTS
 Mr. Kissinger stated that he presently thought he would leave
 Rawalpindi Saturday morning and return Sunday evening -- with a stay
 in China of about 24 hours to permit three separate sessions.
 Ambassador Farland pointed out that he would be expected to have a
 large reception for Mr. Kissinger who agreed that everything required
 by protocol must be done to avoid arousing suspicion.
 Mr. Kissinger raised the question of whether the country director at
 State should be permitted to send a representative along on the trip
 which would pose real pro' 1enis in Faki6tan.  Ambassador Farland
 suggested that the Vietnam country director be permitted to send his
 representative on that portion of the trip only.
 PAKISTAN'S ECONOMIC SITUATION  .
 Mr. Kissinger stated that he would talk to McNamara on Monday,
 May 10, and tell him' that Yahya must be kept afloat for six more
 months; one problem will be that McNamara is emotionally against
 Yahya -- as is the entire liberal. community.  Ambassador Farland
 pointed out that matters won't be helped by the fact that Keating is
 now on his way back to conduct a series of conferences, including
 some with his old Senate confreres.  Mr. Kissinger stated that he
 would tell McNamara that this is the only channel we have, and he
 must give Yahya at least three months.  Ambassador Farland stated
 that six months should be the goal.
 to make a new presentation to the consortium.  Ahmad is coming to
 the United States next week, and Ambassador Farland has stressed
 this to him.  The Ambassador stated that one inherent problem is that
 the lower echelon in the Pakistani bureaucracy feels they have a com-
 mitment from China to support operations in East Pakistan.  Although
 Ambassador Farland stated that he had urged Yahya to tell his staff

 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/NODIS
 Japan is negative in their position, Ambassador Farland felt that
 Germany will not let Pakistan go down the drain and the British
 will probably help as well.  Mr. Kissinger asked whether the $250
 million will be applied entirely to debt re-scheduling -- and whether
 Yahya could propose a plan applicable to West-Pakistan.  Ambassador
 Farland thought some of the $250 million would be a new loan, and
 that a consortium proposal would be geared to East Pakistan with the
 West receiving/ administering the funds.
 Mr. Kissinger next asked what he could do bureaucratically to help.
 Ambassador Farland said that the most important contribution would
 be to get McNamara to head up the consortium..  Mr. Kissinger replied
 that he did not think McNamara would agree to this because it would
 antagonize his liberal friends.  Ambassador Farland then pointed out
 that the IMF was another possibility that should not be overlooked.
 Assali had previously requested a standby laon from the IMF which
 was turned down; however, the loan request could be reactivated.
 Mr. Kissinger indicated that he would take this issue up with Peterson
 or Shultz, and that he would report on his meeting with McNamara
 POLITICAL SITUATION

 the Benghalis realized for the first time that they were part of the world.

 Mr. Kissinger asked how it was that the election results were so
 unexpected.  Ambassador Farland said that everyone has missed in
 their predictions.  In East Pakistan, Rahman had been able to capitalize
 on the cyclone.   When the western nations began to pour in assistance,
 retain substantial support.
 ,successfully, a new post could be offered.  Mr.. Kissinger replied non-

 Pakistan and expressed the hope that if the China meeting came off

 Mr. Kissinger asked if there is any way West Pakistan can hold on to
 East Pakistan.  Ambassador Farland said no, not in the long run.
 Mr. Kissinger then said that all we need is six months.  East Benghal
 is bound to become an economic disaster; Chinese influence will grow
 there, and it will not be possible to win any permanent friends there.
 Ambassador Farland agreed and pointed out the difficulty of making a
 financial commitment to the Benghalis.
 Ambassador Farland asked if Mr. Kissinger could have Hanna pass
 the word down through regular channels that we are going to work
 things out and support the government.  Mr. Kissinger said he would
 insure this gets done.  Ambassador Farland then said that our interest
 in trying to save Pakistan be conveyed to the heads of government in
 Britain, Germany -_ and.possibly also Japan.  Mr. Kissinger replied
 that he might be going to Britain on other business and would speak to
 Heath about this.  Ambassador Farland pointed out that at this point,
 the other members of the consortium do not know our position.
 Mr. Kissinger indicated, by way of summary, that he would:
 (1)  Have Hanna told that we want a positive attitude and six
 months time;
 (2) Talk t9 McNamara along the lines above-,
 (3)  Look into the IMF Loan;
 (4) Personally talk to Heath,,
 (5) Have Rush talk to Brandt in two weeks time
 before the end of the month; and
 or, in any
 .(6) Possibly get the State Department to get to Japan if there
 is a convenient way to do this.
 Mr. Kissinger then asked Ambassador Farland to check back with him
 if at any point he received instructions from the Department which were

 DELIVERY OF U. S. MESSAGE
 With regard to the means of delivering the message to Yahya, Ambassador
 Farland felt that he should give it to Yahya (rather than Hilaly) since
 he could use this to build up credence with Yahya.  Ambassador Farland
 also suggested that this could be used as a lever to get some things done
 which he has been pressing for in East Pakistan.    Mr. Kissinger pointed
 out that the two were separate, and must be kept that way.  Mr. Kissinger
 stated that in any event the message would be shown to Hilaly and
 Ambassador Farland would get a copy to discuss with Yahya.  All techni-
 cal coordination will be done through Ambassador Farland .--who should
 discuss with Yahya Mr. Kissinger's around-the-world trip, his intention
 to stop in Pakistan for the weekend and then go on (presumably) to
 Tehran after leaving Pakistan.  A one-day official program in Pakistan
 would probably have to be planned.  Ambassador Farland should discuss
 with Yahya the fact that he met with Mr. Kissinger and also discuss the
 technical arrangements of the visit.
 Ambassador Farland asked that the Navy attache contact him as soon as
 the channel is open, and Mr. Kissinger assured hint this would be done
 probably by Monday.
 A number of details were then discussed without any definite decisions
 being made:
 conspicuously at Rawalpindi.
 Whether to fly to China using a Pakistani, Chinese or U. S.
 Whether to employ a second U. S. plane (possibly a Jetstar)
 for the flight into China in order to leave the larger aircraft parked
 -w    Whether or not Ambassador Farland should accompany
 Mr. Kissinger into China.
 Rawalpindi. Mr. Kissinger might initially land there on the pretext of
 -?    Whether to fly into China from Rawalpindi or Sargoda.
 Ambassador Farland pointed out that Mr. Kissinger would be least
 likely to be observed in Sargoda, a military base 45 minutes south of

 visiting the surrounding countryside.  After his large plane had left
 for Rawalpindi to refuel, he could transfer to a smaller plane which
 would take his party to China and return him to Rawalpindi the following
 day.  The problem with this plan would be that Mr. Kissinger could not
 normally visit a defense installation like Sargoda without arousing
 suspicion.
 The final determination with regard to technical details was left in the
 hands of Ambassador Farland who indicated he would submit several
 well-developed alternatives to Mr. Kissinger for review.
 After a few parting remarks, the meeting was concluded at 5:45 p. m.

 President Nixon has carefully studied the message of April 21,
 1971, from Premier Chou En-Lai conveyed through the courtesy of
 President Yahya Khan.  President Nixon agrees that direct high-level
 negotiations are necessary to resolve the issues dividing the United
 States of America and the People's Republic of China.  Because of the
 importance he attaches to normalizing relations between our two countries,
 President Nixon is prepared to accept the suggestion of Premier
 Chou En-Lai that he visit Peking for direct conversations with the
 leaders of the People's Republic of China.  At such a meeting each side
 would be free to raise the issue of principal concern to it.
 In order to prepare the visit by President Nixon and to establish
 reliable contact with the leaders of the Chinese People's Republic, President
 Nixon proposes a preliminary secret meeting between his Assistant for
 National Security Affairs, Dr. Kissinger and Premier Chou En--Lai
 or another appropriate high-level Chinese official.  Dr.'?Kissinger would be
 prepared to attend such a meeting on Chinese soil preferably at some
 location within convenient flying distance from Pakistan to be suggested
 by the People's Republic of China.  Dr. Kissinger would be authorized to
 discuss the circumstances which would make a visit by President Nixon
 most useful, the agenda of such a meeting, the time of such a visit and to
 begin a preliminary exchange of views on all subjects.of mutual interest.
 If it should be thought desirable that a special emissary come to Peking

 Dr. Kissinger and the arrival of President Nixon, Dr. Kissinger will
 be authorized to arrange it.  It is anticipated that the -visit of President
 Nixon to Peking could be announced within a short time of the secret
 meeting between Dr. Kissinger and Premier Chou En-Lai.  Dr. Kissinger
 will be prepared to come from June 15 onward.
 It is proposed that the precise details of Dr. Kissinger's trip
 including location, duration of stay, communication and similar matters
 be discussed through the good offices of President Yahya Khan.  For
 secrecy, it is essential that no other channel be used.  It is also under-
 stood that this first meeting between Dr. Kissinger and high officials of
 the People's-Re ublic of China be strictly secret.
