 DEAR SESATOE: We thank you for your no
 vote on the Vietnam situation.
 The little, endless wars the: Pentagon must
 have to Justify its being here are not in
 accord with our religion or fOur patriotism.
 When we hold in our hands the power to
 blow up the world, then we must really be
 careful.
 Doing what Is right, we know, does not
 need human praise, but still we want you
 to know we are with you.

 It would seen, to its that this is a viola-

 much gratitude for your courage in opposing
 this hasty action. Many people I have talked
 to about tIts, wonder whose chestauts we
 are pulling out of the fire in that area and
 why this matter' has not been turned over
 to the United Nations long ago.
 I believe as time passes, the citizens will

 DEAR SENAt'OR: The stand you are taking
 In the Curren; controversy over the southeast
 Asia affair is to be commended.
 You and ilenator ERNEST GRUEFIINU' are
 fighting a losing tattle in the stand you are
 taking but at least you will go down ha his-
 tory as being among the few Who are fighting
 to save our co entry from taking the same sul-
 cidal steps that Franco had taken a decade
 ago.
 I also feel as you do that we have no
 business in the southeast Asia area but since
 the maJority always prevails, so be it,
 There are many who feel as you do but do
 not take time out to write.
 Respectfully yours,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I Was glad to see you
 question some of the reasons for endorsing
 the President's action ordering retaliation
 against North Vietnam. Some form of inter-
 national examination of the case to deter-
 mine  responsibility  for  "aggression"  is
 needed, and I hope you will support efforts
 to involve the U.N. in this way.
 Sincerely,

 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I think it Is unfor-
 tunate that  you ordered  the  retaliation
 against North. Vietnam before the question
 could be excmined by the U.N. Security
 Council.   Our  position would be  much
 stronger if we had given. the opportunity for
 an international body to determine the fact
 of aggression.  So far as can be determined
 from the news reports, we could have afforded
 to have acted with more restraint and waited
 for an international consideration of the
 North Vietnamese attacks on U.S. destroyers.
 According to '..he news reports in the Wash-
 ington Post, many countries seem to be
 skeptical about our version of events.  Had
 we referred the case of the U.N. first, this
 skepticism might have been lessened.
 In any event, I hope that you will now
 authorize Ambassador Stevenson to invite a
 full U.N. investigation of the incidents in
 the Gulf of Tcnkin with a view to establish-
 ing responsibility for those incidents.  I also
 hope that your discussions today with Sec-
 retary General U Thant will lead to the
 proposal of appropriate U.N. action through
 some form of supervision or peacekeeping
 operation which could discourage outside
 intervention Jr. Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Thank you and Sen-
 ator GREENING for your wise and courageous
 vote on the Vietnam resolution.  You save
 us, who agree with you, that U.S. policy In
 that area Is a tragic and criminal blunder
 from utter despair.
 I wonder whether you have had time with
 your hectic routine to read "The Deputy,"
 which, of course, portrays the tragic lack of
 courage and conviction on the part of Pope
 Plus XII that allowed the Nazis to go ahead
 unchecked in their slaughter of the Jews.
 This great play Is an indictment of all (not
 only Catholics) who profess noble principles
 and fail to act-in accordance with them.  I
 feel that your part in our Government is
 similar to, though In a different way, that
 of the heroic priest in the play who died
 wJ.th the Jews. You stand in deed for peace

 And Mrs. Richard tells me in your talk on

 you said, if the Senators had stood by their
 convictions they had expressed to you earlier,
 when they came together to cast their votes
 you would not have been alone.  This poem

 MORSE BLASTS U.S. ATTACK; WON'T BACK WAR
 DECLARATION
 WASHINGTON.-SenaUlr   WAYNE   MORSE,
 Democrat, of Oregon, yesterday assailed the
 United States as a "provocateur" in South
 Vietnam and said he will not support a
 "predated declaration of war" In Asia.
 MORSE, a consistent critic of U.S. mainte-
 nance of troops in South Vietnam, voiced
 his opposition as the Senate's leadership
 mapped plans to push through a resolution
 today backing President Johnson in what-
 ever steps are necessary to preserve peace
 and freedom in southeast Asia.
 He charged, in a Senate speech, that the
 incidents wh.ch inspired the resolution-on
 which the  Senate  foreign  relations  and
 armed services committees will meet at 9 a.m.
 today-"is as much the doing of the United
 States as it is the doing of North Vietnam."
 The resolution, expected to have over-
 whelming bipartisan backing, grew out of
 two attacks by PT boats on U.S. destroyers
 In the Gulf of Tonkin.  It was introduced in
 the Senate yesterday afternoon.
 MORSE charged that a forerunner to the
 attacks on the U.S. destroyers was a known
 bombardment by South Vietnamese naval
 vessels of "two North Vietnamese islands
 within 3 to 6 or 6 miles of the main coast
 of North Vietnam."
 He said the "clear implication" of that
 incident Is that the U.S. Navy stood guard
 while vessels of South Vietnam shelled North
 Vietnam.
 MORSE declared that the United States has
 much to lose and little to gain by continuing
 Its "unilateral military action in southeast
 Asia, unsanctioned by the United Nations,
 and unaccompanied by allies" and should
 "strike a blow for peace" at the conference
 table,
 "I shall not support any substitute which
 takes the form of a predated declaration of
 war," he deals red.  "I shall not support any
 delegation of the duty of Congress-of Con-
 gress-not the President-to' determine an
 issue of war or peace.
 "I shall not support any substitute which
 takes the form of military action to expand
 the war or that encourages our puppets in
 Saigon to expand the war."                .

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: The only complaint
 that I have about your comments, attitudes,
 and votes in the Senate concerning Vietnam
 is that you are not from the State of New
 Jersey. Thus, we do not have the opportun-
 ity to vote for you, or, for that matter Sena-
 tor GRVENNING.  (Perhaps Senators CASE and
 WILLIAMS would be Interested in the above.)
 My wife and I salute and congratulate
 you on your Vietnam stand, particularly in
 regard to your most recent vote in the Senate
 on the matter. Please persevere, so that oth-
 er Americans may become aware of our un-
 holy, illegal and Immoral southeast Asian
 war,  You do the United States proud, and
 make us non-Oregonians a bit envious.

 DEAR SENATOR: This is to let you know that
 I fully support your stand as against the
 administration's recent moves toward esca-
 lating the war in Vietnam.
 I have agreed with you all along that we
 had no business In southeast Asia In the first
 place and should have got out of there long
 ago.  This latest hare-brained escapade in
 the Gulf of Tonkin is certainly the height of
 folly and can well lead to nuclear war.
 Yours sincerely.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Congratulations on
 your stand against U.S. militarism in Viet-
 nam,  It is most unfortunate that we don't
 have more Senators (and more people 1n
 general) aware of the stupidity of our war in
 southeast Asia and the vital importance of
 either taking this to the U.N. or reconvening
 the 1962 Geneva Conference, but it is good to
 see the strong stand you have taken and
 your valiant last-ditch fight.
 From one grateful citizen with best wishes
 for better success In the future.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Never have I ad-
 mired a man Be much as I have -you in the
 last few years, but especially the last few
 months,  I have listened to you on the
 "Today" show and last night I heard you come
 out against our actions in Vietnam.  Most
 of us lack the courage to say what we
 actually believe, it is so much easier to go
 along with the crowd, but in recent years I
 have found out I cannot do this and have
 peace of mind.
 I do not believe the way the John Birch
 Society does, GOLDWATER and so many others
 that hate everything and have no answer
 except to say that we are the true Ameri-
 cans, and this scares me.  They are only
 afraid for themselves.  No matter how many
 people get killed in other countries, Just so
 they don't get near us.  .
 What the answer is is hard to say, but
 when you say this should have been taken
 to the U.N. long ago. I have to agree that is
 right.  We don't get the truth in the news-
 papers or television and this worries me.
 How am I to find out who is right and who
 is wrong, but until I do I am going to make
 no quick decisions.  Again let me say you
 will no doubt stand alone on this issue and
 many others, and this I have to admire, and
 I have heard so many others say the same
 thing.  We not like mobs, and follow like
 sheep, just like  the  German  people, did
 Hitler. You are the only link to the other
 side of the truth that we can hear. Keep up
 the good work,

 was eloquent and pertinent.

 And I appreciate your willingness to stand

 Any help you can give me will be highly

 Senator WAYNE MORSE.
 DEAR SENATOR:  May I offer my whole-
 hearted support to a man who has the
 courage to stand alone and speak truth and
 facts.
 I am simply nauseated by the deception
 pulled on the "American" people-by the
 childish and Cowardly actions by which many
 Congressmen simply  kow  tow  and utter
 only words they have overheard-"unpro-
 voked attack"-we know "our vital inter-
 ests"-money?  Commerce? et cetera.
 Why do we feed communism on one end
 and fight it on the other?
 If a destroyer came to the shores of my
 country, I would certainly consider it an
 intruder.  Would we let one sit (with plans)
 in the area of the Gulf of Mexico?
 Adlal Stevenson advanced such Cheap ex-
 cuses-self-righteously telling of the burn-
 ing of a school In South Vietnam at cetera-
 when in his own country people are burning
 churches and killing children-murdering
 each other-maybe we should clean our own
 house.
 President Johnson is constantly telling the
 American people What they think, as though
 they were nincompoops who could not think
 for themselves.  The eye of the television
 camera. reveals all evasiveness and deceit-
 and cowardice.

 tary-is only causing much of this trouble
 and that the whole Issue should be handled
 by the United Nations.  In the long run the
 people of Asia will throw off the white man's
 influence and domination and Our meddling
 in the affairs of Asia will backfire against
 the people of the United States and history
 will record us in a most unfavorable light
 with all the peoples of Asia.
 Sincerely,

 was on a ticket for President.  As it is the
 people are only getting a chance to vote on
 bad or worse.
 Sincerely,
 Can you help me find the answers to these
 questions:
 1. Are the essential facts available on the
 Tonkin Incident?  I remember with regret
 that Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin was
 unable to get  (in time)  the facts about
 United States-Japanese trade in the summer
 and fall of 1941.
 2. Can you work with U.N. Delegate C. M.
 0. Adebo and others toward moving the
 world toward peace?  His remarks on TV
 the morning of August 6 were very eloquent
 also.
 S. Your reference to a policy of "beating
 swords into ploughshares" was pertinent.
 Can this Incident be used to help move the
 world and, especially our own beloved coun-
 try, toward peace?  Disarmament seems to
 me one of the basics If the human race
 is to last long on this planet.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I want to express my
 admiration, gratitude, and thanks for your
 courageous statement with regard to the sit-
 uation in Vietnam.  It seemed the one clear
 note of sa:rity and 'Wisdom midst the dis-
 cordant and confused sounds emanating from
 Washington yesterday over television and
 radio.
 The incident which 1s supposed to have
 "klckedof" all the sabre rattling certainly
 doesn't seem to warrant all this sound and
 fury.  I don't Bee how' any native of Vietnam
 Will benefit by a conflict; it would only serve
 to massacre- people for as well as against us
 as well as destroy their country.  Haven't
 those poor people suffered enough? Also, I
 can't understand how any group o1' people
 who are citizens of Vietnam can be accused
 of "aggress on"--it's their country isn't it?
 By the sane to can, could we not say that
 the North was the aggressor in the South
 during the Clvit War in our own history?
 It would selm logical to assume that an ag-
 gressor cones from outside Vietnam-such
 as the United States.
 One wonders If the situation has been
 mushroomed into a brink-of-war Icicle in
 order to shew the Goldwater forces that the
 administrat on is Just Be ready for it fight as
 they are.  ::t would seem greater political
 wisdom to JD calm, reasonable. and just In
 this kind of situation in order to demon-
 strate that the Democratic Party is not the
 "war" party that the opposition brands it.
 The adminiotration should present a strong,
 sane,  willing-to'negotlate attitude,  rather
 than that of a fiance, immature, trigger-
 happy, men+ally retarded Slant.  We are too
 important, too great a Nation for such child-

 If our country and the world are to sur-

 accept their responsibility to judge critically
 the  course  that our  disastrous  Vietnam
 policy is leading us. It is in this respect that
 I commend you for what could be called your
 appeal  to sanity.   Hopefully the United

 admit its share of the blame for the Injus-

 South Vietnam can lead only to these types
 of actions.  Moreover, If the New York Times
 of August 4 accurately reported the Navy's
 chronology of the Maddox's first encounter
 with the North Vietnamese boats, it is quite
 apparent that the Maddox was the first to
 fire. Therefore what this means is that It was
 we, not they, who were the aggressors.

 All the more reason that you should con-

 might well begin to doubt Our own sanity.
 These are difficult and trying times in our

 Your political courage in speaking your

 I am '.'at from certain that world opinion
 sanctions our position in Vietnam. The peo-.

 both us and the Vietcong to leave therm

 I have no use for any form of communism

 lieve the United States is constantly creating
 for Itself a load reputation throughout the
 world.
 This country has its greatest opportunity
 to prove to the world that it honestly is in
 favor of peace.  Perhaps a, conference on
 southeast Asia world do no good, but could
 It possibly do any harm?  I had rather be
 at a conference table trying to negotiate a
 peaceful settlement than be accused by the
 world of bombing a tiny nation which was
 reacting as any nation might react when
 threatened w.th the superior might of the
 most powerful nation on earth.  TT his is not
 meant tc imply that I approve of the North
 Vietnamese PT boats attacking our ships.
 I believe we did the right thing by firing
 back, bu; I think before gong any farther
 we shoutl have taken It to the United Na-

 act, we IT fight have been justified In bombing
 North Vietnam supply bases.
 I realhe yours is a minority stand, but I
 do want you to know that most "thinking"
 Americans support your view.. It ,es not easy
 to take a stand which the warmongers and
 Goldwaterites oppose, but I can assure you
 that Such a stand is admired and appreciated
 by all people of the world who realize that
 this great Nation ce.n no longer maintain its
 "holier it an thou" attitude.
 I don't think any nation doubts that we
 have the force to destroy the entire world,
 but if force alone is all we have then we are
 in had at ape.  I doubt that force alone can
 win real friends or command true respect.

 and Integrity It required for you to state

 position.
 It is time: the people of America made their
 feelings cleat It Is time to let the militarists
 know that we cannot afford to ignore the
 United Nations and Geneva Agreement, and
 still continue these aggressive policies in
 southeast Asia.  We certainly must not risk
 war at this; or any time.

 will not get much publicity-who are very
 grateful that there was one man in the
 Senate with the wisdom to oppose this reso-
 lution and the courage to do so against
 such a majority.  I would wish to congratu-
 late you on that courage, and to express a
 hope that the day will come when it will be
 more widely recognized.
 Were there more men like you, the proY-
 pects of peace would be brighter than they
 are, and the image of the United States of
 America in the eyes of the world a more
 favorable one,
 Yours sincerely,
 D. MARTIN DARIN.

 DEAR SIR:  We thank you for being man,
 and American enough to fight those two
 idiotic and unholy things-foreign aid and
 our troops in Vietnam.  God bless you.
 We in California wish that we had a man
 as good as you In the Senate.

 one who is their leader and friend.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  Your courageous
 stand on the war in Vietnam truly reflects
 the wishes of most Americans.  Keep up the
 good fight.
 Devotedly yours,

 Mr. and Mrs. CARL D. LAUSCHE,

 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: We are writing to
 commend you on your previous and recent
 stand in regards to United States policy in
 southeast Asta.' You have taken the most
 courageous and logical step to help remove
 not only the United States but the whole
 world from an area fraught with danger.
 Unfortunately the majority of Congressmen
 and Senators have not yet had the courage
 to speak out as you have, but we feel it is
 a must if we are going to survive in this
 world of ours.
 We have been aware of the futility of this
 undeclared war and the tragic consequences
 of escalation.  Therefore, we have made our
 views known through our local press, the
 Port Angeles Evening News, and the Wash-
 ington-Oregon Shingle Weavers paper.
 We are sure you would be happy to know
 that there are people who support you In
 (1) Why, in such a large group of Congress-
 men, is it possible for only, two to stand for
 a given position (it defies the law of sta-
 tistics)?, and (2) Why Senator MANSFIELD, in
 view of his past utterances on South Viet-
 nam, can possibly not have voted against
 the resolution?
 Sincerely yours,
 Mrs. PRISCILLA SILBER.

 Hon. Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 The White House, Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I would like to GOES-
 mend you on your stand of withholding sup-
 port of the President's resolution pertaining
 to Vietnam.  It was unfortunate that your
 voice was in the minority for a position of
 greater caution in the U.S. involvement of
 the Vietnam war.  Certainly the ramifica-
 tions of enlarging our support to South Viet-
 nam to more advanced proportions require
 most serious consideration, and in the face
 of waging a full-scale war, with possibly
 China's participation, we cannot be too care-
 ful in making a final decision,  The risk of
 initiating what might result in a nuclear
 conflict is too treacherous to take lightly,
 and I fear this grave responsibility is not
 assumed by enough of our representatives in
 government with the essential reservations
 necessary that such a decision requires.
 We must be thankful to Senators such as
 yourself for reminding the hastier ones that
 our foreign commitments must be made on
 the basis of extreme caution in critical times
 such as these, when a move in one direction
 might prove sadly disastrous for humanity
 the world over.
 Thank you for your wise and outspoken
 thoughts on urgent problems, and we hope
 we can continue to count on your kind of
 directions for our Country's role in the world.
 '      Respectfully yours,
 Mrs. ANNE ADATO.

 DEAR SIR: We wish to express the greatest

 position you have taken in regard to our role
 in Vietnam.
 Though you might seem to be the lone
 voice of sanity in Washington, you have a
 great deal of support from the American
 people.
 We know that there is very little likelihood
 of a limited war today, and most important
 of all we feel that this problem must be
 negotiated through the United Nations.  If
 we are really interested In maintaining peace
 and freedom in the world, we are surely
 doing exactly the opposite in Vietnam.
 We wish you every success in your efforts
 for reason to prevail In Washington and
 Vietnam.

 Hon, WAY" MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.!
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have never before
 written a letter to a Congressman.  Perhaps
 this is because I have never been moved to
 do so by my own representative's    words or
 deeds.
 But your speeches on Vietnam, and your
 position on our "brinkmanship" policy there
 makes me wish I were a resident of Oregon
 so I would have the honor of being repre-
 sented in Congress by the only honest man in
 the entire hall of mirrors.
 Thank goodness there are still men with
 the ability to see things as they really are.
 And with the courage to speak the truth-
 painful as that truth may be.
 I assure you your voice is being heard, and
 your counsel respected by a growing number
 of Americans who don't like what is hap-
 pening in Asia, and who desperately fear that
 a provocative and irresponsible foreign policy
 can plunge us into a nightmare from which

 Re Vietnam.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE.
 DEAR SENATOR: Because of your interpreta-
 tions of events I have written you several
 times to express encouragement, although I
 am aware that one who has arrived at the
 status you have disregards praise or blame
 and is only concerned with the issue at
 hand.  However, perhaps at this juncture,
 the enthusiastic appreciation of those who
 read the real accounts of Vietnam will not
 come amiss.
 Therefore, thank you deeply, from our
 hearts for the position you have taken and
 we hope that you will be able to continue
 with many others impelled by your clear and
 reasonable -statements to follow in your
 train.
 Finally to say, we are terrifically troubled
 at our adminstration's movements and we
 fear another great war.
 Sincerely,
 RUTH COLBORN GRUMBINE.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish that I had the
 privilege of writing to you as a constituent.
 I have admired your dissent from U.S. Policy
 in southeast Asia.  Certainly your lone op-
 position to our latest action there, and the
 obfuscation  and false  righteousness  sur-
 rounding it, is historic.                                                                                                                  It is difficult to see
 how we can demand peaceful settlements
 from other nations when we use power so
 nakedly ourselves.  That at least one Senator
 has spoken out, salvages something from
 what some day-given a some day-will be
 our shame.
 Very truly yours,
 CHICAGO, ILL.,

 DEAR SENATOR: Thank God for Senators
 WAYNE MORSE and ERNEST CRUSHING, who
 are willing to fight for the right even though
 they stand alone.  As I have so many letters
 to write, will you please hand him this letter
 when you are through with it.

 North Vietnam claims that several towns
 and two islands were bombed by us, giving
 the dates and hour.  We claim we did not do
 it.  Then who did?
 Our Assistant Secretary of State, William
 Bundy, indicates that South Vietnam gun-
 boats may have shelled the Islands.  This is
 just what Premier Khanh has been saying
 he would do-take the war up into North
 Vietnam, whether we liked it or not.
 It was proper for us to try to destroy any
 attacking ships.  But before visiting such
 terrible devastation on North Vietnam itself,
 wouldn't It have been better to Investigate
 just why a little, weak, impotent nation
 would attack the mighty U.S. Navy?  What's
 behind it all?  North Vietnam claims there

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I live in a different
 State from you, but cannot forbear saying
 how much I appreciate and admire your
 standing all alone in this terrible business of
 the bombing of North Vietnam.  I cannot
 understand  Mr.  Johnson's eagerness;  the
 crisis was pest; the ships had gone on their
 way; nobody had been killed; Investigation
 should precede action;  one wonders what
 was the role GL44aJA44.lrhe matter.    The
 U$. Senate is supposed. to be the greatest de-
 liberative body in the world; on civil rights or
 education it deliberates endlessly, but agree-

 declared war requires no deliberation.
 And hence my admiration.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: A day last week I
 watched, listened, deeply moved while you
 were let speak, and wished other and younger
 Senators were  standing  beside you,  and
 missed Senator GREENING. True, Ibsen said,
 "A man is strongest when he stands most
 alone."  You spoke with such wisdom and
 courage and you spoke for the many of us
 who think as you do but speak only among
 ourselves and are without authority.  I be-
 lieve that should the question be added to
 our ballot in this coming election: "Should
 our Armed Forces be in Vietnam?" the ma-
 jority of the Voters of this country would
 check "No" a:ad those who would mark "Yes"
 would for the most part mark it thinking
 "As all but the one of your Senators are vot-
 ing for it, they must know somethiryg they
 think it unwise to tell us."
 A friend just returned from a couple of
 months' travel In Europe to tell me that
 everywhere the people are deeply concerned,
 anxious over our seeming indifference to the
 likely results to them, and to the whole
 world from our war-risking policy In Asia.
 I was gratified to read In yesterday's New
 York Times's letters a long letter by a judge
 who thinks as you do and quotes you and
 Senator Gov ENINC.  We see all too little
 mention of your views and his and that little
 likely to be in derision. This man Is so right
 in saying that we cannot predict the reac-
 tions of other nations,  The best and the
 worst of life is its surprises, plan how we may.
 We are not young, but many who stand to
 suffer from any bombing done are young, and
 they have their right not to be robbed of

 old, at least not robbed by us, from our side

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Your courageous
 stand against the Pentagon's decision to
 make a brutal attack against a defenseless
 small country like South Vietnam is mighty
 gratifying.
 We in the United States need more honest
 acting minds like you to get us out of this
 morass of decadence, of violent, arrogant
 brutality against humanity.  The peoples of
 the world condemn the U.B. Government's
 murderous action.
 Anyone with religious  convictions and
 mainly with a bit of political knowledge
 knows that France couldn't hold on to its
 $500 million plundering adventure in Indo-
 china and now the American monopolists
 want to grab it.
 The people of southeast Asia will defeat
 us just as the French Imperialists were de-
 feated.
 Let us not sacrifice more young American
 lives and innocent Vietnamese people.
 Our hearts go to you, Senator MORSE, to
 encourage you in your battle against decep-

 not  survive  long  enough  to  finish  this

 Because of this popularity, French journal-

 ,journalists of other countries and are the
 best informed reporters in the world about
 the situation there.  The reports they are
 publishing in such responsible non-Com-

 France-Soir are completely different from
 those which appear in the U.S. newspapers.
 The reports all indicate that Mendes-France's

 benefit both the United States and the un-

 A report from one of these reporters was
 published In the June 27, London Economist.
 The reporter made the following observa-

 "Probably a truly free vote would show that
 the great majority of the  (South)  Viet-
 namese want two things-peace and Inde-

 North Vietnam.  But even then it would not
 be possible to ignore the problem posed by
 the Vietcong, with its roots stretching every-

 and energetic in the country, and above all
 Its formidable army.  The only question is
 whether it can be crushed-as the Americans

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish to commend
 you on your opposition to our involvement
 in southeast Asia and specifically in South
 Vietnam.
 Though not one of your constituents, in
 a sense you represent all of us Americans
 who deplore our men being killed, but not in
 defense of our country, and in turn serving
 to kill even greater numbers of Asians in
 what is essentially a civil war.
 I hope year being in a tiny minority in
 the Senate will not discourage you in main-
 taining your position.  The men we expend
 and the treasure we spend in this so-called
 "police action" in defense of what we call
 "freedom" could be better used at home.

 only sane voice coming over the TV out of
 Washington this last week.
 We completely support your  stand on
 Vietnam and on the special Senate vote to
 give the Chief Executive a blank Check on
 such an important area of foreign policy.
 This country and the world would be a
 much safer and much better one to live in

 for you for President and say Martin L.

 Very sincerely,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Thank you so much
 for your strong and clear statement on the
 real issues involved in the ,Vietnam crisis.
 Rather than blindly following the rallying
 cell'. for swift "counter-aggression to preserve
 peace," you emphasized the basic issues of
 woad peace and morality. Also, you brought
 to the attention of the American people the
 fact that quite possibly we helped to provoke
 the whole recent incident by stationing our
 Navy's boats as a cover for South Vietnamese
 naval raids on the North Vietnamese coast.
 This thought puts the while situation in a
 very different perspective.
 Americans everywhere should be grateful
 for your courage in revea:ing the truth to
 the world and bringing out the necessity for
 peace and negotiation instead of simply go.

 DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON: As best as I have
 been able to piece together a picture of
 events in Vietnam from various American
 end European news media, I have come to
 the conclusion that the South Vietnam gov-
 ernment is not being threatened primarily
 by external aggression, but rather by internal
 civil war which is being carried out by people
 who have legitimate political grievances and
 who have social, economic, and political aims
 which could lie (though which would not
 necessarily be, beneficial to the people of
 Vietnam as a whole.
 I strongly support the minority (at pres-

 itself from Vietnam as soon as possible.

 DEAR SENATOR: Fifty years ago this month
 the arrogant, power-drunk rulers of Europe
 plunged the world Into war.  The untold
 destruction, death, misery and the reper-
 cussions are yet with us.
 Revolutions swept the world, old dynasties
 disappeared, social, political, moral collapse.
 It was a terrible thing they did in August
 1914.
 They were the extremists of their time, the
 jingoists.  The people wanted peace.  They,
 the rulers, spoke of national pride and posi-
 tion etc., just as now.
 We must tell the people the whole truth,
 Senator.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I would like to ex-
 press my sympathy and complete agreement
 with your stand on the recent Vietnamese
 crisis.  It is a pleasure to see one voice In
 the Senate symbolizing the courage and con-
 viction necessary to express an objective view
 should be controlled by the discretion of
 what is the state of apprehension they may
 cause, the tensions of any given area and
 what their appearance might cause.  I be-
 lieve that if 3 to 12 miles is the limit of
 commercial boats, then perhaps we should
 have 300 to 400 miles for the modern ships-
 of-war with missiles, etc.
 2. Just exactly where were those ships
 when attacked? I would like to see on a true
 scale map just exactly where they were so
 that it overcomes these rough drawings that
 show a ship that is 60 miles long sitting inno-
 cently in the center of a bay only 140 miles
 wide.
 3. How and why did we arrive at a deci-
 sion to send those ships in that area? Did it
 have anything to do with Khanh's agitation
 to invade the North? It has always appeared
 to me that Syngman Rhee agitated the North
 into an attack on the South especially after
 he had received Dulles' unqualified sup-

 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIR: It seems safe to assume that you
 are receiving quite a few outraged letters
 from indignant "patriots"; therefore I feel
 that those who admire your lonely and cour-
 ageous stand should not be silent.
 I suppose the world will not change until
 a sufficient number of people attain to a level
 of consciousness where they can see and not
 feel threatened by an opponent's point of
 view and where they can discard self-right-
 eous rationalizations of their own motives.
 It would be truly inspiring to see our own
 country lead the way toward that new ma-
 turity.
 In the meantime we owe a debt of grati-
 tude to lonely voices like yours for opposing
 a resolution to give one man the power to
 dispose over 190 million lives.
 May you long keep your role as a Senate
 gadfly, ready to puncture self-righteousness,
 smugness, complacency and that national
 pride which has been the cause of all wars
 throughout history.
 Very truly yours,
 GERTRUDE ROEERTS.

 DEAR SIR: My husband and I. a U.S. citizen

 DEAD SENATOR MORSE: I am 21, a senior in
 political science, and campaign coordinator
 of the San Fernando Valley State College
 Young Democrats Club.
 Please be reassured that you have the un-
 daunted support and respect of this unin-
 timidated writer.  I still refuse to believe
 that the presence of our military in southeast
 Asia will do anything but perpetuate an un-
 popular and worthless war which we have no
 business participating in.
 Our politicians have proposed everything
 except ending our part in this war.  Many
 others herewith join me In imploring you to

 P.S.-I had really planned to get involved
 in politics this year because I feel that GOLD-
 WATEa has alerted me to how far we have
 drifted, so that now, oven the John Birch
 Society has become acceptable.  But John-
 son's excessive action has really confused me.
 If this Is the kind of action I wanted, I would
 vote for GOLDWATER.  Please don't let the
 Democrats be a "me too-but better'" propo-
 sition. Stand for the di sect opposite of GOLD-
 WATER and give the Able rican people a chance
 to  vote  on  something.  Johnson's action
 causes me to fear the worst: Perhaps GOLD-
 WATER has a better grasp of the American
 voters mind, fears, and prejudice than I do.
 Maybe I am just a crank or a nonconformist
 or Just a fuzzyheaded idealist or maybe a
 part of all these things, but I do hope I have
 the chance to vote on the inward feelings
 I have about civil rights and fairplay at home
 and abroad. I pray that the Democrats might
 provide that this year.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Although we are not
 residents of your home State of Oregon my
 wife and I would like to extend to you our
 very deep appreciation for your courage in
 speaking out so forthrightly in the present
 crisis concerning southeast Asia.  Your voice
 has been among the few that have been
 raised against our highly dangerous policy
 that appears to be leading towards full scale
 war.  Especially dreadful In the situation is
 the administration's 'tendency to cope with
 the Goldwater problem by giving in to just
 a little bit of Goldwaterism in foreign policy.
 President Johnson, even if he would wish to,
 is not likely, to win a contest with the Re-
 publican candidate as to who can adopt a
 more belligerent stance.  The shame of it is
 that there is good reason to believe that our
 unilateral commitments In Vietnam are dis-
 tinctly unpopular and that the country really
 would lister. to an approach geared to find-
 ing a peaceful solution to the conflict.  In
 any event It Is most encouraging to know
 that some Members of the Senate are exert-
 Ing leadership In leading us to deal with this
 problem in rational, constructive terms.
 I would very appreciate your having sent
 on to us available copies Of some of your
 recent Senate statements dealing with the
 Vietnam problem.
 With many thanks for your brave efforts
 for peace.
 Sincerely yours,
 HERBERT SHAPIRO.
