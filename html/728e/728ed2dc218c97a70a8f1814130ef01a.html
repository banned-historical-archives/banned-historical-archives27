 China's Current Approach Toward Japan
 After two decades of Communist rule, Peking is no closer than ever to realizing
 its princips,l foreign policy objectives in Japan. Indeed, owing to repeated failures and
 the violent disruptions of the Cultural Revolution, Peking is attempting to revive its
 policy toward Japan. The most recent impetus for the revival-aside from an end to
 Cultural Revolution excesses-came from the signing last November of the Nixon-
 Sato communique on the reversion of Okinawa. Peking has always been apprehensive
 over Japan's expanding influence in Asia, particularly in Taiwan, and has taken the
 view that the Nixon-Sato communique signaled a more assertive and direct role for
 the Japanese in the area. Peking's reaction has been marked by indignation and by an
 unsettling conviction that as the US disengages From Asia, Japan will fill the void both
 economically and militarily and will assume the lead role in countering China. Peking
 still sees Japan's policies toward Taiwan and the US as the major stumbling blocks to
 any improvement in bilateral relations, and for the foreseeable future probably
 believes there is no real chance to force major concessions from Tokyo on these
 issues. Adding to Peking's dilemma is the awareness that its political assets and
 leverage in Japan have markedly dwindled and its image has been blackened by the
 Cultural Revolution. Fur ther, the Sato government-toward which it is irreconcilably
 hncti!e-won a solid victory last fall.
 in view of its limitations-and past failures-Peking seems to have decided to
 continue on a course of limited meddling in Japan's internal affairs while cautiously
 conducting a program of rebuilding. Peking has also launched an intensive propa-
 ganda campaign in the meantime, raising the specter of a remilitarized, new "im-
 perialistic" Japan, a foreign policy ploy designed to fan traditional Asian fears and to
 undercut Japanese influence. Moreover, the Chinese are attempting to build a case
 against US-USSR-Japanese "collusion," which is also intended to strengthen Peking's
 hand in its competition for influence in Asia. So far, this approach has been
 particularly successful in helping to improve China's relations with North Korea, but
 it does not appear as yet to have had a serious effect on Peking's non-Communist
 neighbors. Furthermore, the campaign has not been allowed to affect materially
 China's burgeoning trade with Japan, which is expected to reach record levels again
 this year.

 A I/istol.)' of l,Wili! '
 Japan's record in Asia since its successful
 war against China in 1895 predisposes the Chinese
 Communist regime, like previous governments on
 the mainland, to look upon Tokyo as a con-
 tinuing threat to China's security, as well as its
 main competitor for influence in Asia. China
 views Japan's rapid postwar recovery and its close
 ties with the US, moreover, in terms of an in-
 creasing challenge.  In the past two decades,
 Peking's main foreign policy objectives with re-
 gard to Japan have been to counter the potential
 menace of Japanese "expansionism" and to rid
 Japan of the US "presence." China has generally
 pursued these ends, however, using unimaginative
 political  tactics governed  by rigid ideological
 orthodoxy-and as a result it seems little closer to
 realizing its objectives in Japan than it was 20
 years ago.
 Essentially Peking has been unable to use its
 huge population and extensive geographical area
 either as a club to over awe the Japanese people
 and government or as a magnet to draw Japan
 irresistibly into the Chinese orbit. China as a club
 was the image projected-without appreciable suc-
 cess-during the Korean War and its immediate
 aftermath; China as a magnet was the tactic em-
 ployed during the so-called Bandung (or peacefc,l
 coexistence) phase of Chinese foreign policy with
 initial promise of some success. Peking was able
 to generate a growing popular sentiment among
 Japanese for an improvement in relations with
 China, while at the same time it steadily at-
 tempted to exploit differences in Japan over is-
 sues relating to trade, rearmament, US bases, and
 the status of Okinawa. There were, however,
 built-in limits to this policy of "people's diplo-
 macy" that sharply decreased its ultimate ef-
 ficacy. Peking's demand that Japan withdraw its
 recognition of the Chinese Nationalist Govern-
 ment in Taiwan and sever its ties with the US as
 preconditions for the establishment of closer bi-
 lateral relations with the mainland, for example,
 has been consistently rejected by the Japanese
 Government-a clear sign that the Chinese were
 Special Report
 unable  to  build  enough  support  among the
 Japanese populace to force Tokyo to change its
 position on major policy issues affecting Chinese
 interests.
 Peking's frustrations over the failure of its
 Japan policies began to surface in the late 1950s,
 These frustrations, combined with a wide-ranging
 unhappiness over other phases of its foreign
 policy,  rapidly  led  to  abandonment  of the
 Bandung policy and reversion to a tougher policy
 toward Japan. Peking officially banned all trade
 with Japan for several years and leveled a series of
 harsh propaganda attacks against the Japanese
 Government. The signing of the US-Japan Secu-
 rity Treaty in 1960 further intensified Peking's
 vitriol and helped stiffen its truculent attitude.
 On  this  occasion, moreover, China's growing
 quarrel with the Soviet Union tended further to
 complicate the picture. The Japanese Communist
 Party  (JCP),  China's  principal  instrument  in
 Japan, was caught in the middle with regard to
 both Peking's emerging hard-line approach and
 the dispute with Moscow. After years of internal
 bickering, the JCP eventually refused to side with
 either the Chinese or the Soviets in their dif-
 ferences and insisted that it was free to follcw its
 own course of "parliamentary struggle" in Japan.
 Peking's final break with the JCP in late 1965 was
 a result both of the JCP's refusal to shift its
 tactics  toward greater  militancy  in domestic
 politics and of its nonaligned stance in the Sino-
 Soviet quarrel. Other political assets in Japan have
 not proved more viable from the Chinese point of
 view.  The Chii use-oriented  left wing  of the
 Japanese Socialr,- tarty appears to be a weaker
 reed than the JCP, and militant "Maoist" student
 groups in Japan have alienated both the Japanese
 populace and the traditional leftist parties.
 The break with the JCP, a spectacular il-
 lustration of the steri!ity of Chinese policy to-
 ward  Japan,  was capped,  however,  by  the
 consequences of the Cultural Revolution in the
 Japanese political environment. The mounting
 turmoil on the China mainland in the late '.960s
 disabused many Japanese of their idealized vision

 Japanese suspicion and resentment of Peking's

 Trade relations, which had been resumed in 1962
 and had grown steadily since, again began to
 decline as a result of the upheavals of the Cultural
 Revolution. Chinese assets and leverage in Japan
 dwindled to their lowest point in a decade and a

 turned inward to deal with its internal problems.

 Peking NCNA, 27 February 1970
 The aim of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique
 in stepping tip its collusion with the Japanese
 reactionaries is to encourage the Japanese mili-
 tarists to embark on the criminal road ofaggres-
 sion on, aad enslavement of, the Asian people
 and to incite them to gang np with the Soviet

 Revolution and was apparently jarred by the sign-
 ing of the Nixon-Sato communique on the rever-
 sion of Okinawa to Japan. The Chinese blasted
 the communique in largely predictable terms, but
 a greater sense of urgency in their public state-
 ments suggested that they interpreted the docu-
 inent as signaling a more active and assertive role
 for Japan in Asia. Peking's public and private
 statements began to reflect genuine concern that
 Japan would ultimately assume the lead role of
 countering China in Asia as a kind of "shock
 force" or "gendarme'' for the US after it with-
 drew from the area. The Chinese accused Japan
 not merely of being a "pawn" of the US, but
 focused on the dangers in Asia from Japan it-
 self-economic domination, military expansion,
 and new designs for a "greater East Asia co-
 prosperity sphere."
 A statement in the Nixon-Sato communique,
 moreover, that Taiwan's security came under the
 "interest" of Japan has sharply reinforced Pe-
 king's concern that Japan will eventually replace
 the US both militarily and economically in Tai-
 wan, as well as in the rest of Asia. The Chinese
 apparently believe that this will solidify Japanese
 influence in the island, a process that would be
 facilitated by the lingering sympathy many native
 Taiwanese retain for Japan since the days when
 Tokyo exercised sovereignty there. Thus far, how-
 ever, Peking has been unable to do much in the
 way of countering Tokyo's expanding economic
 role in Taiwan. Chou En-lai's recent dictum that
 China would not trade with Japanese firms deal-
 ing with Taiwan has proved to be a feeble attempt
 to scare off the Japanese, who have not reacted
 with  much  concern-indicative  of just  how
 limited Peking's leverage on this issue really is.
 The outcome of the Japanese elections held
 shortly after the Nixon-Sato communique also
 had a sobering effect on the Chinese. The con-
 vincing victory of Sato's Liberal Democratic Party
 (LDP) no doubt impressed on Peking the relative
 popularity of Japan's ruling goternment and, by
 extension, of the terms of the Okinawa reversion
 agreement. Moreover, the sharp electoral setback

 pro-Peking left wing must have added to China's
 loss of confidence in its policy of support for
 what have proved to be inconsequential "progres-
 sive" Japanese political elements.
 Finally, the Chinese are undoubtedly con-
 cerned over the possibility of growing amicability
 in relations between Japan and the Soviet Union.
 Both economic and to a lesser extent political ties
 between the two countries have been increasing
 for some years, but Moscow's attempt last year to
 float the idea of an "Asian collective security
 agreement,"  clearly  if not explicitly directed
 against China, may have driven home the dangers
 of a rapprochement between China's northern
 and eastern neighbors. Jap,n.ese plans to lend
 money to the USSR for economic development
 schemes in Siberia have almost certainly rein-
 forced Peking's uneasiness on this score.
 These developments have unquestionably in-
 creased Peking's apprehensions, and, taken with
 Peking's past failures, have apparently led the
 Chinese to rethink their policies toward Japan.
 The first fruits of this reassessment, however, do
 not seem markedly different from policies in the
 immediate past. In fact, China continues to face
 something of a dilemma in shaping its approach
 to Japan:  Peking's  leverage remains relatively
 slight, and its room for maneuver is circumscribed
 by Maoist ideological considerations. In these
 circumstances Peking appears to be pursuing three
 separate policy "tracks" with respect to Japan:
 one relates to Japanese internal affairs-a  long-
 haul effort that presently appears to be little
 more than a waiting game to c,oate a favorable
 pro-Chinese climate  in the islands; a second,
 aimed at countering Japan diplomatically in Asia,
 seems geared to flaunting the Japanese "bogey"
 before other Asian states; and a third, concerned
 with strictly bilateral matters between the two
 states, relates almost exclusively to the important
 issue of trade between Japan and China.
 In the first instance Peking probably sees no
 chance of coming to terms with the Sato gov-
 Special Report
 ernment, and, for the moment at least, has ap-
 parently given up any hope of ousting the ruling
 Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) by supporting
 opposition leftists in Japan's elections. Instead,
 the Chinese have set their sights on gradually
 building opposition to Sato's China policy within
 the LDP by giving political ammunition to the
 "pro-China" factions in the party. The signing of
 this year's Memorandum Trade  (MT)  agree-
 ment-the only semiofficial link between Peking
 and Tokyo-was the occasion for a harsh denunci-
 ation of Japanese policies under Sato. It caused
 some embarrassment for the government, par-
 ticularly inasmuch as members of the ruling LDP
 endorsed the attack.
 Peking's reading of the domestic political
 situation iii Japan, however, probably suggests to
 the Chinese that this approach has its limits and is
 unlikely  to  force  the  Sato government into
 making significant concessions on major outstand-
 ing issues between the two states. Perhaps for the
 same reason, Peking is not taking full advantage
 of what could be its principal point of leverage in
 Japan's domestic politics, that is, widespread
 popular sentiment among Japanese who favor
 closer relations. For reasons of culture! heritage
 and prospects of increased trade with the main-
 land, Japanese public opinion supporting a more
 forward looking China policy has traditionally
 been pervasive. Al Epolitical parties in Japan are
 aware of this feeling, and the LDP is always alert
 to display a "reasonable" attitude toward the
 Chinese, largely as a political expedient to mollify
 Japanese public opinion.
 Although much of the pressing sentiment
 among Japanese to establish closer relations with
 China has cooled over the past few years, Peking
 could try to rekindle their interest and make use
 of it to apply more pressure on the Sato govern-
 ment. For example, Peking could promise greater
 access to the "China market." In addition, ges-
 tures of good will from Peking, such as the release
 of Japanese detained in China, freer cultural ex-
 changes, or the easing of travel restrictions, would
 bring additional pressure on the government to
 improve relations.

 Pcking does not appear ready, however, to
 exploit this sentiment for its full political ad-
 vantage. The Chinese no doubt are sharply aware
 that their political assets within Japan have di-
 minished markedly in the past few years, and that
 there are limits to how far this approach would
 take them. In addition to the election losses of
 the pro-Peking faction of Japan's Socialist Party
 last fall, for example, internal factional fighting
 among other pro-Peking organizations in Japan
 has virtually paralyzed their effectiveness. Nor
 have the  bitter  ideological  disputes  between
 China's Communist  Party and the JCP been
 bridged  despite the JCP's  recent  interest in
 muting public polemics with the Chinese. The
 closing down of pro-Peking newspapers and the
 bankruptcy of other Communist Chinese - sup-
 ported publications in Tokyo have further re-
 duced Peking's voice in Jdpan.
 In looking to the future, nevertheless, Peking
 probably hopes to re-establish some of the "con-
 tacts" with Japan that were interrupted during
 the period of the Cultural Revolution. Peking has
 been impressed, for example, by the Komeito
 Party's gains in last year's Japanese elections, and
 apparently now is interested in exploring contacts
 with  it if its influence continues to increase.
 Komeito-the second largest opposition party in
 Japan-favors immediate recognition of Commu-
 nist China and an expansion of Sino-Japanese
 con.mercial and cultural relations, but its position
 on the issue of Taiwan-wh'ch is of course of vital
 irnpor' Ice to Peking-hrs remained ambiguous.
 First Things First
 In sum, then, the Chinese have apparently
 decided that a "low posture" with regard to
 Japan's internal affairs is in order for the time
 being. Standard propaganda attacks on the Sato
 government  apparently are just that,  Indeed,
 Peking appears to be focusing its major efforts
 outside of Japan as the best current approach to
 counter Japanese policies and influence. This ap-
 proach serves other ends as well. It fits into Pe-
 :king's  over-all  Asian  strategy of refurbishing
 Special Report
 China's poJJtion throughout the region, especially
 among  its Communist neighbors, and under-
 cutting Soviet, US, and Japanese influence. In
 pursuit of these goals, Peking is relying heavily on
 the specter of a menacing, new "imperialistic"
 Japan as its instrument to fan traditional fears in
 Asia and frighten those nations into joining more
 closely with Peking to repel Japanese expansion.
 This line has been used with particular suc-
 cess in North Korea. The relationship between the
 two states apparently has been rebuilt in part by
 stressing common concern over the "growing
 threat" of Japan. In recent months, for example,
 Pyongyang and Peking have issued parallel propa-
 ganda statements strongly critical of Japanese
 "expansion"  in  Asia.  During  Chou  En-lai's
 three-day state visit to Pyongyang last April, he
 and Premier Kim II-song devoted considerable
 time  in  their public statements to attacking
 Japanese "militarism" and stressing the need for
 "solidarity" to counter Japan's expanding role in
 Asia. On the occasion of the twentieth anni-
 versary celebrations of the Korean War this June,
 Chinese and North Korean official statements
 were heavy with similar references to the com-
 mon threat to both states, and indeed to all of
 Asia, posed by Japanese "remilitarization." Both

 parties  constantly re-emphasized the need to
 stand firm  against  Japanese  expansion, par-
 ticularly in South Korea and Taiwan.
 The Chinese are also attempting to build a
 case along these lines against USSR-Japan "col-
 lusion," again to improve their position through-
 out Asia at the expense of Moscow and Tokyo.
 This could help explain Peking's silence on the
 Northern Territories' irredentist dispute between
 the Soviet Union and Japan; the Chinese do not
 want to undercut their "collusion" claims by
 focusing attention on differences between the
 two states. On his visit to North Korea, Chou
 En-lai also attempted to gain some points with
 Pyo,igyang at Moscow's expense by publicly al-
 luding to Soviet-Japanese perfidy. Chou reminded
 the North Koreans, for example, that "one's"
 (i.e., the Soviets') attitude toward Japan was an
 important criterion for clist'nguishing between
 "genuine and  sham  socialism"  and  between
 "genuine and sham Marxism-Leninism." During
 the  Korean War anniversary celebrations, the
 Chinese also focused attention on this theme,
 charging the Soviets with "collaborating" with
 the US and "fraternizing" with Japan at a time
 when    the  people of  Asian  countries were
 "strengthening their unity" in a fierce struggle
 against them.
 Peking's public treatment of the Japanese
 "threat" is  also designed to help strengthen
 China's hand in its competition for influence in
 Southeast Asia. Peking has loudly warned against
 Japanese "infiltration and expansion" in the area,
 and has attempted to evoke a regional protest
 against Japan's so-called claim that its "lifeline"
 extends from South Korea, Taiwan, and Indo-
 china all the way to the Strait of Malacca. It has
 also recently called attention to Japan's "expand-
 ing role" in Indochina, including its part in the
 Indonesian conference on Cambodia, and has
 characterized Japan as the "general manager of
 the stooges of US imperialism in Asia." At the
 same time,  Peking has strongly criticized the
 "broader" implications of the renewal of the US-
 Japan Security Treaty. According to the Chinese,
 Special Report
 SECRET
 the pact has become "more aggressive in char-
 acter" !nd has been broadened to include Korea,
 Taiwan, and even Indochina in its "scope of ag-
 gression." To some extent these charges reflect
 actual Chinese fears-the renewal of the pact and
 the Nixon-Sato communique that preceded it
 were unquestionably disturbing to Peking-but
 these seem to be fears for the future, rather than
 a realistic appraisal of the state of affairs at
 present. Such charges seem primarily designed to
 play on residual dislike for the Japanese among
 non-Communist Asians.  This  dislike  is  real
 enough, but the Chinese campaign does not ap-
 pear to have had much impact to date.
 Peking's alarmist statements are belied by
 the fact that since 1965 Japan has been China's
 principal trading partner. In practice this area of
 bilateral relations has been insulated from the
 purely  political  implications of Peking's con-
 tinuing hostility to the Sato government. The
 Chinese are aware that they are open to charges
 that their words and deeds do not coincide in this
 important   area,  and  they  gave general'y at-
 tempted to obfuscate the extent of their financial
 dealings, by emphasizing the political aspects of
 their trade relations with Japan. For example, the
 promulgation of Chou En-lai's "four principles"

 SECRI 7:'
 governing future trade with Japan-which banned
 dealings with companies also trading with Taiwan
 and South Korea-was almost certainly motivated
 by political considerations designed primarily to
 complement Peking's hard-line propaganda treat-
 ment of Japanese "expansionism" in Asia. As
 noted above, Peking also used the occasion of the
 renewal of this year's Memorandum Trade agree-
 merit to emphasize its hardened political attitude
 toward  the  Sato  government.  ;similarly,  the
 Chinese have been able to gain maximum political
 play in their dealings with the so-called "friendly
 trade firms" in Japan, who operate almost ex-
 clusively outside the Memorandum Trade chan-
 nel, by having them endorse some of Peking's
 most virulent anti-Sato propaganda attacks.
 Behind the public smokescreen, nevertheless,
 there are no signs that Peking will allow political
 considerations to override the economic im-
 portance of its trade with Japan, particularly with
 regard to such vital imports as steel and chemi-
 cals-above all, fertilizers. Japanese businessmen,
 who  so far have reacted calmly to Peking's
 bombast, are certain that trade this year will
 exceed the all-time high of $625 million reached
 in 1969. Indeed, trade for the first half of 1970
 has already exceeded $400 million and will un-
 doubtedly reach a new peak of $700 million or
 more. All this suggests that Peking still regards the
 Japanese "threat" as potential rather than im-
 mediate, and that it is content to play a waiting
 game with respect to its principal Asian rival.
 Although trade between China and Japan
 will continue to increase, political relations be-
 tween the two states are likely to remain on dead
 center for the forese'able future. The principal
 zJumbling blocks to any improvement in bilateral
 relations will continue to be Japan's policies to-
 ward Taiwan and the US. Peking is committed to
 a policy of helping to eliminate the US presence
 from 311 of Asia, and probably believes that US
 power is declin:ng in the region. Tokyo's future
 role, particularly with regard to Taiwan, is an-
 other matter. Peking is clearly troubled over
 Tokyo's growing stakes in Taiwan, and probably
 Special Report
 considers this the major obstacle in the way of
 Sino-Japi,n relations.
 Peking's future policies toward Japan will
 probably continue to depend on its existing
 priorities in Asia. as well as on opportunism when
 chances   for  forcing  major concessions  from
 Tokyo on the big issues present themselves. For
 the present, Peking seems intent on restoring its
 influence with Communist states in this area, and
 part of the reason for its relative success-at least
 so far as North Korea is concerned--clearly lies in
 its  intense  campaign  against  the  Japanese
 "bogey."
 Chi.ia's current thinking on how to approach
 the prnblem of Japan directly does not yet appear
 to have changed significantly, however. Peking,
 obviously hoping to exact maximum support in
 Japan for its position against the government, is
 conducting a cautious and long-term buildup of
 new assets to enhance its political leverage. Over-
 all interest among many Japanese toward estab-
 lishing closer relations with the Chinese may
 already be increasing with signs over the past year
 that Peking has abandoned its Cultural Revolu-
 tion  excesses  and  has  adopted  a  relatively
 orthodox approach in the conduct of foreign af-
 fairs. Any hint of movement toward an improve-
 ment in relations between the US and China,
 moreover,  will be watched closely  by  the
 Japanese Government, which for domestic po-
 litical reasons does not want to be left "holding
 the bag" by any US ii:itiatives. Furthermore,
 should Prime Minister Sato step down, his suc-
 cessor might be more eager to show independence
 from the US on this popular political issue.
 Until Peking is able to strengthen its leverage
 within Japan, however, the Chinese will probably
 continue to feel that there is little to be gained in
 becoming conspicuously involved in Japan's inter-
 nal affairs. Consequently, the Chinese will almost
 certainly continue to take their shots at the
 Japanese Government from long range, will con-
 tinue their attempts to cause it maximum embar-
 rassment, and, if possible, to isolate it at home
