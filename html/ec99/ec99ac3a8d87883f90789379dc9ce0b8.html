 THIS IS THE THIRD AND FINAL OAK REPORT ON MISSION 4036
 AND PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE HIGHEST PRIORITY COMMITTEE
 ON OVERHEAD RECONNAISSANCE (COLOR) TARGETS OBSERVED ON THE
 PHOTOGRAPHY,,   THE REMAINDER OF.THE COMOR TARGETS COVERED ON
 THIS PHOTOGRAPHY WILL BE REPORTED IN A SERIES OF OAK SUPPLEMENTS.
 TARGETS ARE ARRANGED IN THE OAK BY SUBJECT AND WITHIN EACH
 SUBJECT BY C:OMOR TARGET NUMBER.   TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY
 OBSERVED DURING THE OAK REPORTING PERIOD ARE LISTED
 NUMERICALLY UNDER THE APPROPRIATE SUBJECT AFTER THE LISTING
 OF COMOR TARGETS.   LOCATIONS OF TARGETS IN THIS REPORT
 ARE INDICATED BY THE COUNTRY CODE PRECEDING THE COORDINATES.
 COUNTRY CODE: ABBREVATIONS ARE PRINTED ON THE INSIDE OF.-THE
 BACK COVER PAGE.
 SELECTED PHOTOGRAPHIC-REFERENCES FOR EACH TARGET OBSERVED
 AND REPORTED FOLLOW THE DESCRIPTION OF .THE TARGET.   PASS
 NUMBERS,  SUFFIXED WITH A FOR ASCENDING AND D FOR DESCENDING,
 ARE LISTED FIRST, FOLLOWED BY FRAMES WHICH ARE INDICATED BY
 THE FRAME NUMBER WITH AN INDEX NUMBER RUNNING CONSECUTIVELY
 FROM THE BEGINNING OF EACH PASS -- 4/8 FOR EXAMPLE, MEANS FRAME 4,
 INDEX 8.   UNIVERSAL REFERENCE GRID COORDINATES FOR NEW TARGETS
 ARE GIVEN IN PARENTHESIS AFTER THE INDEX NUMBER TO WHICH THEY
 APPLY.   THIS GRID IS IDENTIFIED AS UNIVERSAL GRID NO 1, FEB
 64.   SYMBOLS INDICATING CONDITIONS WHICH AFFECT=THE APPEARANCE
 OF THE TARGET ON THE PHOTOGRAPHY ARE -- C (CLEAR), SC
 (SCATTERED CLOUD COVER), HC (HEAVY CLOUD COVER), H (HAZE-),
 CS (CLOUD SHADOW), S  (SNOW), 0 (OBLIQUITY),. SD (SEMIDARKNESS),
 D (DARKNESS), GC (GROUND COVER),.CF  (CAMOUFLAGE),  AND GR
 (GROUND RESOLUTION).   ANY COLOR COVERAGE IS DESIGNATED BY THE
 LETTER C IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING FRAME NUMBERS.
 INTERPRETABILITY OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY IS CATEGORIZED AS G
 (GOOD), F (FAIR), OR P (POOR).   THE EXTENT OF: PHOTOGRAPHIC
 COVERAGE  IS DENOTED BY THE SYMBOLS T (TOTAL) OR PT (PARTIAL).
 THE MODE OF COVERAGE IS INDICATED BY ST (STEREO), PS (PARTIAL
 STEREO), OR NS (NON-STEREO).
 THE INITIAL SCAN OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY:IS ACCOMPLISHED IN A
 SHORT TIME AND PRIOR TO FINAL REFINEMENT OF EPHEMERIS DATA.
 CONSEQUENTLY, FUTURE DETAILED ANALYSIS MAY RESULT IN MINOR

 HIGHLIGHTS
 NOTE -- COMMENCING WITH THIS MISSION,  ICBM LAUNCH SITES WITHIN
 A COMPLETED,. SINGLE-SILO LAUNCH GROUP. WILL BE REPORTED COLLECTIVELY
 UNDER THEIR RESPECTIVE COMPLEX.
 1.   AT THE TYURATAM MISSILE TEST CENTER,.USSR, THE LAUNCH POSITIONS
 BEING CONSTRUCTED FORWARD OF'G1 AND G2 ARE DESIGNATED G1-A AND G2-A,
 TO DIFFERENTIATE THEM FROM THE ORIGINAL LAUNCH PADS.   THE
 GANTRY.IS POSITIONED ON THE PAD AT G3 AND CONTAINS A PROBABLE
 MISSILE/COMPONENTS.   A NEWLY.FENCED AREA OF CONSTRUCTION IN THE
 COMPLEX G SUPPORT FACILITY NOW CONTAINS 6 BUILDINGS AND FOOTINGS FOR
 7 CONSIDERABLY LARGER BUILDINGS.
 2.   COVERAGE: OF THE SSM FACILITIES AT-THE KAPUSTIN YAR/VLADIMIROVKA
 MISSILE TEST CENTER, . USSR,IS HIGHLIGHTED WITH THE FOLLOWING
 OBSERVATIONS
 PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED LAUNCH AREA 6C,  FIRST. IDENTIFIED ON MISSION
 .IS CONFIRMED AS A HARDENED FACILITY UNDER CONSTRUCTION  25X1
 CONSISTING OF 2, AND: POSSIBLY 3, SINGLE SILOS.   CONSTRUCTION
 ACTIVITY IS OBSERVED AT PREVIOUSLY: ABANDONED LAUNCH SITE 5C-2.
 AN SS-4:MISSILE EXERCISE IS UNDERWAY.IN THE SSM BIVOUAC AREA AND
 SS-5 MISSILES/EQUIPMENT ARE OBSERVED AT BOTH LAUNCH AREA 4C-2 AND
 5C-1.
 AT:LAUNCH AREA 3D, 2 PROBABLE AERODYNAMIC VEHICLES ARE OBSERVED.
 AT LAUNCH COMPLEX H, A 40-FOOT LONG SUSPECT MISSILE ON A POSSIBLE
 LAUNCHER IS OBSERVED.ON THE NORTHERN PAD.
 3.   AT THE PLESETSK MISSILE AND SPACE CENTER, USSR, SITE 11  IS
 CONFIRMED AS A TWO-PAD SOFT LAUNCH SITE AND 2 TYPE IIID SINGLE SILOS
 HAVE BEEN NEWLY IDENTIFIED, ONE PROBABLE, THE OTHER POSSIBLE.   THE
 TYPE IIID SITES AT THIS COMPLEX PRESENT AN ANOMALY WHEN COMPARED TO
 OTHER SITES OF THIS TYPE IN THE USSR.   A SMALL RECTANGULAR
 BUILDING IS BEING CONSTRUCTED IN THE SILO EXCAVATION ADJACENT
 TO THE HEADWORKS.
 4.   AT THE UZHUR ICBM'COMPLEX, USSR, 4 TYPE IIIC:SITES HAVE BEEN
 NEWLY.IDENTIFIED IN LAUNCH GROUP E.   THE AREA WHERE THESE SITES ARE
 LOCATED HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE NOVEMBER 1965 AND THE SILO
 HEADWORKS ARE NEARLY COMPLETE.   THE PROGRESS ON THESE SITES
 AND THE PRESENCE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF MATERIALS IN THE
 COMPLEX SUPPORT FACILITY..SUGGEST THAT..CONSTRUCTION OF :A SIXTH LAUNCH
 GROUP MAY START IN THE NEAR FUTURE'  IF IT HAS NOT ALREADY STARTED.

 G1-G2 -?- CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES ON LAUNCH AREA G1-G2.
 TWO BUILDINGS ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN THE CENTRAL
 PART OF:THE AREA,  SLIGHTLY FORWARD OF A LINE BETWEEN
 THE 2 READY BUILDINGS.   FIRST-EVIDENCE OFjHIS
 CONSTRUCTION WAS OBSERVED ON
 THE STRUCTURES PREVIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED IN EXCAVATIONS
 FORWARD.OF PADS G1 AND G2 ARE NOWCONSIDERED TO BE
 RAIL-SERVED LAUNCH POINTS,  AND ARE DESIGNATED G1-A AND
 G2-A.   LAUNCH POSITION G1-A, THE MORE ADVANCED IN STAGE
 OF CONST:RUCTION,APPEARS TO BE APPROXIMATELY 80 FT
 SQUARE WITH A CIRCULAR STRUCTURE LOCATED AT ITS CENTER.
 IT CANN13T YET BE ASCERTAINED WHETHER THIS IS A LAUNCH
 PAD OR :A SILO.   IN GENERAL APPEARANCE, HOWEVER,IT IS
 QUITE REMINISCENT OF PAD A2 AT LAUNCH COMPLEX A.
 LAUNCH .POSITION G2-A APPEARS TO BE AN IDENTICAL LAUNCH
 POSITION IN AN EARLIER STAGE OF CONSTRUCTION.
 ON THE RAIL NEXT TO THE G1 GANTRY IS A
 MISSILE/COMPONENT,  THE DIMENSIONS OF:WHICH
 ARE THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE ONE FREQUENTLY SEEN
 THIS VICINITY.   THE TAPERING OF THE NARROW= END,
 HOWEVER, APPEARS TO DIFFER SOMEWHAT FROM THAT
 PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED.   THE MISSILE/COMPONENT FREQUENTLY
 SEEN FORWARD OFTHE G2 READY BUILDING IS NOT PRESENT
 BUT A CYLINDER APPROXIMATELY                IS LOCATED OFF
 THE RAILS NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE LAUNCH AREA.   IN
 ADDITION, A SIMILAR CYLINDER,              , AND 2
 CYLINDERS OF SMALLER DIAMETER,          LONG WHICH FLARE
 TO A DIAMETER OF        AT ONE END, . ARE. LOCATED NEAR THE
 GANTRY, NOT FAR FROM THE ENTRANCE TO LAUNCH AREA G5-G6.
 IFTHE LARGER CYLINDER AND ONE OFTHE SMALLER CYLINDERS
 WERE MATED,  THEY WOULD CONFORM CLOSELY IN SIZE AND
 APPEARANCE TO THE MISSILE/COMPONENT LOCATED NEAR THE G1
 GANTRY.
 G3-G4 -- THE GANTRY IS POSITIONED ON PAD G3 AND
 CONTAINS A PROBABLE MISSILE OR MISSILE COMPONENTS.

 MEANINGFUL DETERMINATION OF ITS HEIGHT.   A STRING OF
 RAIL CARS,  INCLUDING AN EMPTY MISSILE TRANSPORTER,  IS
 LOCATED ON THE TRACKS TO THE REAR OF ;.THE PAD.   ONE HALF
 OF.THE SUMP FORWARD.OF THE LAUNCH AREA APPEARS TO

 CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES ON THE G4 SIDE OF THE LAUNCH
 AREA.   FENCING UNDER CONSTRUCTION ON EITHER SIDE OF THE
 LAUNCH AREA SUGGESTS THAT THE AREAS AROUND THE LAUNCH
 FACILITIES ARE BEING ISOLATED FROM THE BUILDINGS. IN THE
 CENTRAL PORTION OF.THE LAUNCH AREA.   UNIDENTIFIED
 CONSTRUCTION CONSISTING OF EXCAVATIONS, AND EARTH
 MOUNDS IS LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF .THE ACCESS ROAD,
 JUST NORTH OF THE L-SHAPED ELECTRONIC FACILITY.
 ARE ALONG THE NORTH FENCE LINE.   THE GANTRY IS IN ITS
 USUAL POSITION AT THE APEX OF THE TRACKS.   A CYLINDER
 G5-G6 -- A FOUR-LEGGED APPARATUS IS LOCATED ON EACH
 LAUNCH PAD.   AT LEAST 21 VEHICLES/PIECES OF EQUIPMENT
 ARE LOCATED AT VARIOUS POINTS IN AND ABOUT THE LAUNCH
 AREA.   THERE ARE 39 CYLINDERS ALONG THE EAST:FENCE LINE
 AND 2 VEHICLES/PIECES OF EQUIPMENT, POSSIBLY CYLINDERS,
 FT AND 2 CYLINDERS OF SMALLER DIAMETER,                      25X1

 SMALLER CYLINDERS WERE MATED, THEY.WOULD CONFORM
 CLOSELY IN SIZE AND APPEARANCE TO THE MISSILE/COMPONENT
 OBSERVED-IN LAUNCH AREA G1-G2.
 COMPLEX SUPPORT FACILITY -- THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED
 AREA OF UNIDENTIFIED CONSTRUCTION JUST WEST OF..THE
 ADMINISTRATION/HOUSING AND TECHNICAL. SUPPORT AREA HAS
 BEEN-SECURED BY NEW FENCING.   THE AREA NOW CONTAINS 6
 BUILDINGS,  FOOTINGS FOR AT LEAST 7 CONSIDERABLY. LARGER
