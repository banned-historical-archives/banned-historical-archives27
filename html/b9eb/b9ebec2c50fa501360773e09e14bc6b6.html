 1.    USSR.  Soviet note warns Turkey against Atlantic Pact:  The Soviet Union
 has warned Turkey that it "cannot remain indifferent" to Turkey's plans
 to join the Atlantic Pact, and "awaits an explanation from the Turkish
 Government."  The note, announced by TASS in the Moscow press, was de-
 livered in Ankara by the Soviet Ambassador, who flew from the USSR.
 The note, according to TASS, drew Turkey's attention "to the responsi-
 bility it has assumed by joining the aggressive Atlantic bloc and allow-
 ing Turkish territory to be used for the establishment of foreign mili-
 tary bases on Soviet frontiers."  Major stress was laid on the air and
 naval bases allegedly being established by the US near the Soviet
 frontier.  (U NY Times Reuters, 4 Nov 51)
 Comments  The Soviet Union's current campaign against the Atlantic
 Pact and Western defense measures has included the delivery of notes
 to such NATO countries as France, Italy and Norway.  The Soviet demarche
 to Turkey fits into this pattern and is similar to Moscow's protests
 to Norway at the time of its entrance into the North Atlantic Pact in
 1949.  It may well be followed by a similar note to Greece or a Soviet
 offer to renew the Soviet-Turkish non-aggression treaty, denounced by
 the USSR in March 1945.  Such an offer was made to Norway following the
 Soviet note in 1949.
 2.    AUSTRIA.  Austrian employees discharged at Soviet military installa-
 tions:  On 1 September 1951 all Soviet military installations in Vienna
 were directed to discharge all Austrian employees.  The process of dis-
 missal, which is expected to take about two months, is determined by
 the trade union representative of each installation, with non-communists
 and " uestionable" communists leaving first.
 Comments  The report is in accordance with earlier reports of dis-
 missals at Soviet installations in Austria.  (.See OCI Daily 10 Oct 51)
 While the move is probably a security measure similar to that taken in
 East Germany, it also may be an indication of the permanent nature of
 Soviet occupation, as contrasted with the alleged Soviet interest in
 concluding an Austrian peace treaty.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1. NEAR L   .  Ex-Mufti of Jerusalem urges Arab attacks against Westerners:
 The ex-Mufti of Jerusalem has reportedly sent word to his followers in all
 the Arab countries uring }hem to attack all British, American and French
 nationals and to sabotage their property.                          no

 CQmm    s                                       The followers of the ex-Mufti are not as numerous as those
 of the fanatic Moslem Brotherhood, but they have sufficient support as
 a result of the Palestine issue to promote disturbances in the area
 and to increase Arab bitterness  toward the Western powers.
 2.   EGYPT. M 1~ i ary train' g -orogr.   j_3a the US for Ebyti .i a , to b       ended:
 The Department of State has informed the Embassy in Cairo that
 "present conditions" make it advisable to suspend the training program
 in the US for Egyptian army and air force personnel.  Egyptian personnel
 now attending US service schools, however, will be permitted t6 complete
 their training.  The Department states its further belief that it "does
 not  consider this action punitive," and it voices the hope that "con-
 ditions will soon permit a resumption of the training program."
 The Department suggests that, since formal notification to Egypt
 concerning this decision to suspend the training program  "would
 probably cause considerabl-  resentment, particularly in the
 Egyptian Army and the A. Force," the Embassy should merely delay acting
 on Egyptian applications dui' military training and explain, when asked,
 that the delay is "only administrative."  (S to Cairo 683, 2 Nov 51)
 3.   AFGHANISTAN.  Czech Legation in Kabul a possible source of Communist
 propaganda:  The  Czech Legation`in Kabul'is thought to be disseminating
 Communist propaganda written in English.  Several pieces of this material,
 of the fellow-traveller variety clearly designed to appeal to Afghan
 intelligentsia, have recently some into the possession of the US
 Embassy in Kabul.  (C Kabul, Joint Weeka 18, 1 Nov 51)
 Comment:  Relatively little is know of Communist activity in afghanistan.
 It was reported in July that l~ussian language  propaganda materials
 were being disseminated by the Soviet Trade Agency in Kabul (see Daly
 Dies ,'23 Jul 51), but the Czechs have not previously been reported
 as involved in propaganda activities.  Following Dr. Kratochvil's defection
 as Czech Ambassador to India, in early 1951, it was rumored that the
 Cominform had shifted its South Asian  base of activities from India

 4.
 PAKISTAN.  Trad  agreement with Ceylon:  On 14 September, Pakistan signed
 an agreement with Ceylon designed to facilitate trade between the two coun-
 tries.  Under the terms of the agreement, Pakistan will encourage exports
 including 150,000 tons of rice, some wheat flour, and gram to Ceylon, while
 Ceylon will export natural rubber, graphite, cocoanut oil, tea and spices.
 (U Karachi Desp. 349, 20 Sep 51)
 Comment:  West Pakistan's normal rice surplus is from 200,000 to 300,000
 tons, most of which ordinarily is sent to the deficit area of East Pakistan.
 The dispatch of 150,000 tons of rice to Ceylon would force East Pakistanis,
 who prefer rice, to consume more wheat, of which there is a greater surplus
 in West Pakistan.  India, which has imported Pakistani rice, may also suffer
 as'a result of the new agreement.  Pakistan utilizes very little natural
 rubber and graphite and may intend to re-export these commodities.
 5.   BURMA.  Burmese Coznffiunists and Karen insurgents reportedly sign agree_nt:
 The US Charge in Rangoon was told by the British Ambassador that the Karen
 insurgents in the Irrawaddy Delta have just signed an agreement to cooperate
 with the Burmese Communist Party.  (S Rangoon 441, 3 Nov 51)
 Comment:  If this report is correct, Communist capabilities in Burma
 will have been greatly increased at a critical moment.  Coordinated action
 by the numerous Karen rebels in the rice-rich delta area of southern Burma
 would facilitate the achievement of the Burmese Communists' current objec-
 tive -- control of northern Burma, including territory adjacent to Communist
 China.
 The British Foreign Office regards the situation in Burma with con-
 siderable concern and has recently suggested a joint American-British effort
 to assist the Burmese Government in reaching a settlement with the Karens.
 The American and British Embassies in Rangoon, however,, believe such an
 approach unwise, citing extreme Burmese sensitivity to the Karen insurgency
 as reflected in Premier Thakin Nu's 29 October statement that Burma would
 not accept mediation.
 6.  IND OCHINA0  Renewed Viet Minh terrorism foreseen:  The French authorities
 fear that the assassination of Commissioner de Raymond in Cambodia is the
 signal for a renewed and increased effort on the part of the Viet Minh to
 establish a reign of terror.  :After being spared any grenade throwings for
 four or five months, Saigon has recently suffered three such incidents.

 Army in Sumatra to such an extent that a number of troops
 25X1                               had to be moved to Java because of their subversive
 25X1 A   behavior.
 25X1         Commen s  If I                    true, Col. Simbolon, military commander
 of North and Central Sumatra and one of the most competent officers in the
 Indonesian army, was probably responsible for shifting unreliable troops to
 another part of Indonesia.
 It has been estimated that five percent of Indonesian Army troops are
 Communist and 40 percent are "unreliable."
 25X1 C
 S.                Re-entry hermits denied. Oyer seas Chinese now in China:  A
 I                         Ireports that after the departure for Communist China
 in August of an-overseas Chinese observation party, it was discovered that
 the Indonesian Immigration Department had not included re-entry permits in
 the passports and travel documents.  Members of the party born in Indonesia
 will be permitted to return.  However, those born outside Indonesia probably
 will not be permitted to re-enter the country on completion of the tour.
 25X1A    A prominent Chinese in Sumatra has made several visits to the Immigra-
 tion Office in Medan in an effort to secure re-entry permits for the entire
 Sumatra contingent of the part    To date he has been unsuccessful.
 F                  2_1
 Comment:  During the weeks preceding the departure of the group, the
 Indonesian Government had become increasingly irritated by policies of the
 Chinese Communist Embassy in Djakarta and increasingly aware of Chinese
 Communist subversive activity.  Additionally influenced by the discovery
 of an "underground movement which had foreign support," Indonesian officials
 may persist in denying re-entry to those Chinese not Indonesian-born.
 Labor front is Quiets  The labor front in Indonesia is generally
 quiet. Left-wing labor unions are not making excessive demands or threaten-
 ing crippling strikes.
 25X1                                                           SCBSI, the Communist-led
 labor  ederaion, has probably passed instructions down to local unions
 not to create disturbances in order either to:give the impression that the
 government's security sweep was not necessary or to iul1. the government
 and the public into thinking the security measures have been effective.
 25X1                             this is only a tactic, and that the left-wing labor
 movement is prep
 25X1 A   sive activities.

 Comments  The government's security arrests included a number of SOBSI
 and left-wing labor officials and several suspected Communists in the Labor
 Ministry,
 25X1                        probably correct in estimating the current lack of labor
 disturbances as a tactic,  However, an additional and more immediate reason

 for such quiescence is the fact that renewed activity at the moment would
 undoubtedly bring renewed arrests,

 2 5X1X   lutionary Governments  A             has obtained a copy of a Philippine
 Politbureau resolution, dated March 1951, which sets forth the aim of.es-
 tablishing a "Provisional Revolutionary Government" which would be in-.
 tended to serve as a "rallying center" for the allegiance of the masses
 and give them a "permanent revolutionary outlook,"  In areas of strong Huk
 influence, town councils would be elected by a "show of hands,"  The coun-
 cils would designate and supervise peasant committees for partitioning and
 apportioning the land, and where factories exist  workers' committees would
 prepare for the seizure of industries. E:           7 While it is recog-
 nized that there is a big difference between outlining and actually imple-
 menting this plan, in areas friendly to the Huks "town councils" might be
 used to gain further'mass support, although it is doubtful they could ac-
 complish actual government functions since the Philippine. Communists lack
 a "liberated area,"  (C Manila 1611, 2 Nov 51)

 12.  CHINA:  Chou ED-101 r=r s on state of the nation:  Chinese Communist
 Premier and Foreign Minister Chou En-lai's long political report to the
 People's Consultative Conference on 23 October has been released by Peiping
 radio.  Chou made the following principal points:
 (1) an "unprecedented unity" of the Chinese people has resulted
 from the three-point program of aiding Koreas advancing land
 reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries;
 (2) although Chinese Communist forces in Korea have inflicted on
 the US "colossal" losses, US intransigence in negotiations
 has shown that the Chinese must be prepared if necessary for
 a "long-term struggle";
 (3) land reform now extends to 310 million peoples with 90 million
 to go, and will be largely completed by the end of 1952;
 (4) although "great nation-wide successes" have been achieved in
 suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the movement has been
 "uneven," and the struggle "must continue on a nation-wide
 scale" ;
 (5) government organs at all levels are working well but need to
 be streamlined, to improve their cadres, and to learn to dis-
 tinguish between Peiping's area of responsibility and their
 own;
 (6) the national minorities are being brought under Communist con-
 trol while concessions are being made to local customs; and
 (7) united front activities are effectively lining up the populace
 to support Peiping?s policies, with even the intelligentsia,
 businessmen and religionists learning to admire the Communists
 and despise the West.  (R FBID flimsy, 3 Nov 51)
 Comment:  Most of these points were made in the speeches of Mao Tse-tung
 and other Chinese Communist leaders before the Conference, which discharged
 its function of endorsing the regime's program in toto.  The "unprecedented
 unity" and wide popular "support" are clearly the products of compulsion;

 the imprisonment or (in most cases) expulsion of those remaining, as

 priests and 3,0009000 Chinese Catholics.
 14.           Tibetan wooer sales hammered by US contra s&  According to an
 important Indian trader in Tibetan wool, US controls may force the
 Tibetans to sell their wool to the Chinese, who urgently need it'for
 making blankets.  Because of US Treasury restrictions, dealers do not
 know whether the US will buy Tibetan wool.  The Consul General in Cal-
 cutta advises a relaxation of these restrictions in order to encourage
 Tibetans to bring their wool to the Kalimpong market.  Otherwise  they
 will sell to the Chinese Communists.  (C Calcutta 221, 27 Oct 51)
 Comment:  US Foreign Assets Control Regulations forbid payments for
 merchandise in which Chinese Communist nationals have had any interest
 since 17 December 1950, unless permission is obtained from the Secretary
 of the Treasury.  Under the regulations, US dealers cannot pay for wool
 now owned by Tibetans (who are presumably nationals of Communist China).
 15.         Chinese Communists are still relatively unaffected bar Western
 economic sanctions:  Western economic sanctions have had no especially
 adverse effect on China's economy, according to the US Consul General
 in Hong Kong.  Although the Communists have had to defer some of their
 plans for industrial expansion, reports from travelers indicate that the
 efficiency of many utilities--some of which depend on imported machinery--
 has actually increased.
 The Consul General believes that stockpiles of strategic items
 already accumulated may have acted thus far as a buffer against the
 effect of Western sanctions, but shortages are beginning to develop in
 certain items, e.g., trucks and electronic supplies.  He is of the
 opinion that the next six months will demonstrate the full effects of
 Western economic sanctionsa.  (S Hong Kong 1612, 1 Nov 51)
 ent:  Sanctions have been in effect for too short a time to
 permit firm conclusions regarding their effect on China's economy.  The
 Chinese claim that increased shipments from the USSR and Eastern Europe

 are countering the effectiveness of Western export controls.  Never-
 theless, unconfirmed reports that the Chinese are dissatisfied mi th the
 quality of Soviet  deliveries and costly efforts to develop sources of
 supply in the non-Orbit areas (e.g., Macao and India) indicate that
 Western sanctions are beginning to handicap China's economy.
 16.  KOREA.  "Aerial no-man's land" reLortec ovgr northwes ern Korggl  The
 inability of UN medium bombers to venture north of the Chongchon River
 in northwestern Korea in daylight hours is cited by the Far East Command
 as demonstrating the loss of UN air superiority in this area.
 The Far East Command states,.. however, that the "relative freedom
 of action" enjoyed by high-performance UN jet aircraft over northwestern
 Korea has in turn prevented the Communists from achieving effective air
 superiority, in effect establishing an "aerial no-man's land."  (S CINCFE
 Telecon 5331, 5 Nov 51)
 Comment:  Loss of air superiority north of the Chongchon River has
 caused the UN to resort to night medium bomber and fighter-bomber missions
 in an attempt to continue the neutralization of the airfields at Taechon,
 Namsi and Saamchan.  The Communists are continuing to augment their anti-
 aircraft defenses at these fields, and considerable construction work con-
 tinues in the repair and extension of runways.
 17.           Communists adamant on possession of KagsoDg:  A Peiping broadcast,
 reporting the 4 November sub-committe meeting of the cease-fire talks,
 states that no progress was made.  The broadcast adds that the Communists
 are "determined in their opposition to the absurd American demand that
 they yield Kaesong" and that they will equally oppose "the fantastic
 demand that Kaesong be placed under American control and moved into a
 so-called demilitarized area."  .
 The broadcast concludes with the warning that if "the American side
 stubbornly persists in their demands ... then the responsibility for
 stalling the armistice negotiations will rest entirely with the American
 side."  (R FBID Ticker Peiping, 4 Nov 51)
 Commen :  Reasons for the Communists' currently intransigent stand
 on the disposition of Kaesong are obscure.  It may be speculated, how-
 ever, that the prestige value of holding this ancient Korean capital
 city, located in South Korean territory, is of equal weight with its
 military value.

 1$,           Chinese Communis s make coordinated tank-infantry attack in
 wester sector;  In the late afternoon of 4 November, an unidentified
 Chinese Communist unit, estimated at division strength, launched an
 attack supported by ar estimated reinforced battalion of tanks and self-
 propelled guns.                      The at-Gack, directed against elements of the 1st
 Commonwealth Division west of Yonchon in the western sector, was sus-
 tained for nine hours but made pnly slight gains.  UN air action knocked
 out six of the twenty-two attacking tanks and one of the three self-
 propelled guns.  (S CINCFE Telecon 5331, 5 Nov 51)
 Comment: This engagement, the heaviest reported during the past
 two months, is significant in that it is the second occasion that
 Chinese elements have received armored support in the attack.  The armor
 utilized during this action were probably elements of the Chinese Commu-
 nist 1st Armored Division located in this general area.
 19.            North Korean Premier thanks Chinese "Volunteers" fQr having
 "achieved" their mission:  In a 4 November Peiping broadcast, the text
 of a message from Yo-4h Korea's Premier Kim 11 Sung to the "Chinese
 People's Political Consultative Conference" was released.  Kim tendered
 his "warmest thanks" for the encouragement received from China, and in
 speaking of the feats of the Chinese "Volunteers" in the Korean war he
 noted that "they have victoriously achieved the glorious mission assigned
 by the Chinese people."
 He added, however, that "with the militant aid of the Chinese
 People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army will assuredly defend the
 unification and independence of their own country....  (R FBID Ticker
 Peiping, 4 Nov 51)
 Commen    While this broadcast is of particular interest in that
 Kim uses the past tense in referring to the mission of the Chinese
 "Volunteers" in Korea, the obscure statement that they would continue
 tc "defend the unification" sheds no further light on ultimate Chinese
 intentions in Korea,  Chou En-lai has recently stated that the Chinese
 must be prepared if necessary for a "long-term struggle" in Korea.

 Korean Labor Party.  One of the few Koreans rumored to have free access
 to the Soviet Embassy in Pyongyang, Ho's political star appears to be in
 the ascendancy.
 21. JAPAN.  Korean-Japanese talks reach impasse:  The US Political Adviser
 reports that the Korean-Japanese taJils have reached an impasse over the
 Korean request that special privileges be accorded to Korean residents in
 Japan after' they attain alien status.  The Japanese Foreign Cffice has
 indicatedthat it will be difficult to continue the --Elks if the Koreans
 insist on a status which the Japanese consider extra-.territoriality.
 (C Tokyo 932, 3 Nov 51)
 CioRlment:    In a letter to Ambassador Dulles on 26 October, the head
 of the Korean delegation complained that Japan was deliberately delaying
 consideration of outstanding problems until Japan achieves full sovereign-
 ty.                           The Koreans, mistrustful of Japanese intentions and mindful of their
 former status as "second-class" citizens, apparently are seeking guaran-
 tees of special treatment which the Japanese are determined not to give.
 The Koreans probably also fear a wholesale deportation Of indigents and
 other undesirables, despite Japanese assurances that deportation would
 be applied only to "leftist troublemakers."  A breakdown of the current
 talks will be an unfortunate beginning for Korean-Japanese independent
 25X1       relations, which are certain to be tenuous for several years.

 SECTION 3  (WESTERN)
 1.   GERMANY.  USSR apparently seeking four-power discussion of Berlin trade
 problems: East German trade officials have told their West German counter-
 parts that they are now forbidden by the Soviet authorities to discuss
 restrictions on West Berlin trade.  The East Germans admit that this marks
 a definite change in the Soviet position.from the time the interzonal
 trade agreement was signed on 20 September.  They declare. that the re-
 strictions-can-now be. discussed only on a four power level.
 The Western Allies are prepared. to open trade discussion with the
 Soviet authorities, but only after suspension of the interzonal trade
 agreement, a step on which Chancellor Adenauerts views are awaited.
 West Berlin officials, claiming that economic difficulties are begin-
 ning to be evident in Berlin, believe that immediate steps should be
 taken to increase the airlift of exports.  Meanwhile, confirmation has
 been received that the Rothensee canal lock in East Germany has been
 opened, removing one of the obstacles to barge traffic from Berlin.
 (S Bonn 308, 2 Nov 51; R Berlin 672, 3 Nov 51)
 Comment:  At the signing of the interzonal trade agreement, the
 East Germans made an oral pledge that certain devices to harass Berlin
 trade would be abandoned.  Prior to this time, they honored this-promise
 only to the. extent of reducing the tax on truck traffic to Berlin.  If
 the Soviet authorities have now denied the East Germans any jurisdiction
 over trade. restrictions, the purpose might be to give the USSR a free
 hand to use the restrictions as one of several levers to impede progress
 toward the integration of Germany into the West, and particularly to
 force four-power negotiations on this issue.
 The Rothensee canal lock, now open for. the first time since last
 January, will not be of much immediate use to the West, as the canal
 is normally closed because of ice by mid-December.
 2.  FRANCE.  French succeed in having German EDF. contribution reduced:  At
 Me i stigation of the French and with German.. approval, the European
 Defense Forces Conference has agreed to reduce from 18 to 12. the number
 of German units (groupements) to be contributed to the EDF by 1954.  The
 French argued that the total cost of 18 groupements with appropriate
 supporting forces amounting, according to NATO estimates, to about 16
 billion dollars, would be so great as to create fears that the EDF would
 not be built at all.
 The SHAPE observer at the conference stated that his organization
 could not modify its estimate of military requirements, but that it

 would have to accept the conference's decision on national financial.
 capabilities.
 The French are influenced in part by the serious balance of pay-
 ments crisis, which they are convinced will compel them to curtail their
 own defense program even more than they had thought a short time ago.
 (T5 Paris 2585, 1 Nov 51)
 Comment:  The European Defense Forces plan was intended by the
 French as a means of preventing a return of German military ascendancy
 in Europe.  The French are looking for ways to insure that, aside from
 contributing.a number of units equal to their own, the Germans make an
 additional financial contribution to Western defense which would com-
 pensate for France's naval and overseas commitments benefiting this
 cause.
 FRENCH MOROCCO.  Public disorders attend 1 November election:  Disorders
 a'ccompanied strenuous French efforts to get out -he few Moroccans eligi-
 ble to vote in the l November election.  Eight persons were reported
 killed by police and 500 arrested.  Further disorders are said to be
 planned for 6 November, the date of the opening session of the UN General
 Assembly.  (C Casablanca 26, 2 Nov 51)
 Comment:  The nationalists had asked the few enfranchised natives
 to boycott this election of 21 delegates to the advisory, 151 member
 Council of Government, but probably did not propose any demonstrations
 or disorders.  Although disturbances may occur on 6 November, or the
 national holiday on 18 November, the nationalists probably would not
 jeopardize their case before the UN by inciting disorders.
 Expulsion of Bourghiba from Tangier may increase
 nationalist agitation:    On 2 November the international police in
 Tangier expelled Habib Bourghiba, Tunisian nationalist leader, who had
 arrived the day before on a private visit.  The US Legation in Tangier
 considers the expulsion a hasty and ill-advised action because it may
 furnish grounds for renewed political agitation.  (C Tangier 168 and
 169, 2, 3 Nov 51)
 Comment... Although theoretically an international administration,
 the International Zone of Morocco -Tangier- is dominated by France,
 which in fact controls the police.  The Moroccan nationalists have re-
 ceived further grist for their propaganda mill,.and the Arab League
 nations will probably use the expulsion in presenting the Moroccan case
 to the UN General Assembly.

 industrial commodities like steel and coal.

 11.          Government refuses to permit neo-fascist national congress:      The
 Italian Interior Ministry has refused the request of the neo-fascist Italian
 Social Movement for revocation of a year-old ban against the party's hold-
 ing a national congress.
 US representatives in Rome comment that the refusal of the Christian
 Democratic government to weaken its stand against this group is motivated
 by opposition on principle to neo-fascism and perhaps by fear that the vote
 for the Italian Social movement may grow, particularly in southern Italy.
 (S Rome Joint Weeka h4, 2 Nov 51)
 Comment:    The Sicilian elections in the spring of 1951 gave the neo-
 fascis s the balance of power between the Christian Democrats and the Com-
 munists.  Partly because of the gains by the two political extremes, the
 Italian Government recently postponed elections in southern Italy from the
 fall of 1951 to an uncertain date, now planned for the spring of 1952.
 12.           Communists try new tactic to force cooperation from anti-Communist
 labor unions*  The leadership of the Communist-dominated General Labor Con-
 federation  CGIL) has stated that if the government lowers prices 15 percent
 within one month, the Confederation will forego its recently announced de-
 mand for a general 15 percent wage increase to offset the rise in the cost
 of living. The US Embassy in Rome comments that the CGIL's change of policy
 is a clever tactical move in an effort to force the anti Communist unions to
 join the drive for higher wages.  (S Rome Joint Weeka 44, 2 Nov 51)
 Comment:  The anti-Communist unions had opposed the CGIL's previous
 'demand for higher wages and advocated instead a reduction in the cost of
 living through lowered prices.  In addition to this switch in the CGIL's
 position, a development that will exert even greater influence in promoting
 unity of action among all the unions is the stringent anti-strike bill re-
 cently approved by the Cabinet and due for parliamentary consideration dur-
 ing November.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1.   CHINA.   Communist Chinats vulnerability to stricter economic controls
 estimated:   The US Consul General in Hong Kong declares that the Chinese
 Communists would be squeezed much harder than they are today if US-type con-
 trols were adopted and strictly enforced by all UN member nations outside
 the Soviet bloc.  Such controls, he states, would not have an early effect
 on the ability of the Chinese to wage war in Korea on the present scale,
 since the USSR would undoubtedly make a strong effort to make up for the
 loss of non-Orbit supplies.  Nevertheless, the Chinese urban economy would
 be strained, and there would be increased dissatisfaction with the Korean war
 and with Peiping's "lean-to-one-side" policy.  (TS S/S Hong Kong 1634, 3 Nov
 51)
 Comment:  The Consul General has previously estimated that current
 Western controls have as yet had no especially adverse effect on the Chinese
 economy as a whole.  The US-typo controls he envisages would meax. a cessation
 of all shipments to Communist China -- not merely a. UN-type embargo limited
 to strategic items.  In addition, they would include a ban on merchant ship
 sailings to Chinese Communist ports.  Britain and other Western European
 countries have indicated their unwillingness to bar their merchant ships from
 the China trade; nor are they willing to ban the export to China of so-called
 non-strategic items.
 SECTION 3 (WESTERN)
 2.    ITALY.   Government delays-compliance with certain provisions of peace treaty:
 The US Ambassador in Rome has stressed to the State Departnre nt that the
 Italians by delays and inaction are failing to comply with Articles 78 and
 83 of the peace treaty, relating respectively to UN property in Italy and to,
 the settlement of disputes between a UN member and Italy by a Conciliation
 Commission,  The Ambassador believes that as soon as agreement is reached on
 the Italian note requesting revision of the peace treaty, the Italian
 Government should be told "in the strongest terms" to expedite the processing
 of claims and to agree on the appointment of a third member to the
 Conciliation Commission.   (S S/S Rome 1977, 2 Nov 51)
 Comment:  Italy has also stalled on the matter of reparations to certain
 UN members.  It has taken no steps to initiate payments to Yugoslavia,
 Ethiopia, or Albania.
