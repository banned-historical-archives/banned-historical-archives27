 China-Vietnam:   The Islands Dispute
 Peking's sensitivity over the security of its
 southeast flank, as well as its increasing impatience
 with Hanoi, was vividly illustrated late last month
 in a sharp People's Daily attack on "foreign aggres-
 sors" in the South China Sea.
 The question of sovereignty over two major is-
 land groupings in the area--the Spratlys and the
 Paracels--has been a major annoyance in Sino-Viet-
 namese relations since the Chinese took the Paracels
 from the former Saigon government in January 1974.
 Both Peking and Hanoi have periodically reiterated
 their claims to both island groups, but neither side
 had openly pushed the issue in public.   The Chinese
 even declined to respond to Hanoi's announcement
 last May that North Vietnamese forces had captured
 several of the Spratlys--500 miles south of the
 Paracels--from the former South Vietnam government.
 In September, the Chinese turned up the heat
 on the islands issue just prior to North Vietnam
 party chief Le Duan's visit to Peking; they publicly
 reiterated their claims to the disputed islands and
 recalled for the first time in months the 1974 take-
 over in the Paracels.   Chinese diplomats abroad were
 also instructed in September to acknowledge the dis-
 pute with Hanoi over the islands and to vigorously
 defend Peking's claims.   Moreover, Hong Kong and
 South China cadre were told that relations with Hanoi
 were bad and to be prepared for the adoption of a
 new slogan demanding the return of all the Spratlys
 to China.
 Last month's broadside was by far the toughest
 Chinese statement on the dispute since early 1974.
 It amounts to the first direct challenge of Hanoi's
 claims to the islands and emphasizes the serious-
 ness of Peking's determination to regain all con-
 tested islands.   The article asserted. that China's

 claims date back 2,000 years and cited archeological
 and other evidence to support the claims.   Chinese
 sovereignty over all the islands was described as
 both "sacred" and "inalienable."  Peking's demand
 that all the disputed islands must be returned to
 Chinese control was juxtaposed with its long-held
 pledge to "liberate" Taiwan, a clear indication not
 only of the importance the Chinese attach to their
 claims, but also a sign that Peking may be prepared
 to wait some time for a final solution of the issue
 --as it is in the case of Taiwan.
 In an apparent attempt to avoid any confusion
 about the primary target of Peking's blast, the ar-
 ticle employed language that played down the signifi-
 cance of claims other parties have to the Spratly
 Islands.   The Nationalist Chinese claim all of the
 islands and maintain a military garrison on one, but
 the People's Daily reference to the fact that many
 of the islands are still not "in Chinese hands"
 rules out the possibility that Peking was referring
 to the Nationalist presence there.   Peking is doubt-
 lessly confident that Nationalist claims will be re-
 solved when the much larger Taiwan question is
 settled.
 The Philippines also claim some of the islands
 in the Spratly group.   Peking has never made an is-
 sue of Manila's claims, however, and, when diplomatic
 relations between the two countries were established
 earlier this year, both sides agreed to settle all
 bilateral disputes without resort to force.   Peking
 seems prepared to put aside the disagreement with
 Manila.
 Although People's Daily left no doubt that Hanoi
 was the major object of its wrath, its attack on Hanoi
 was implicit:   references to Moscow in the blast were
 explicit and vituperative, leaving no question that
 Peking believes the Vietnamese are abetting the So-
 viets in an attempt to expand Russian influence into

 the region.   Significantly the article was published
 only two days after Le Duan returned to Hanoi from
 Moscow--where he received a much warmer welcome than
 he had in Peking, gained a Soviet agreement to pro-
 vide substantial economic aid to North Vietnam, and
 seconded Moscow's views on detente and on interna-
 tional peace and security.   Peking insists that both
 detente and the recent Helsinki security pact are
 Soviet "tricks" designed to facilitate what the Chi-
 nese see as Soviet "expansionism."   Le Duan's en-
 dorsement of detente puts Hanoi squarely in Moscow's
 camp on an issue of major importance to the Chinese
 and was almost certainly read in Peking as a deliberate
 provocation.
 In fact, the treatment Le Duan received in Peking
 last September contrasts sharply with the rousing
 welcome he got in Moscow.   There was no joint commu-
 nique to mark his China visit, and the Hanoi leader
 failed to tender the normal farewell banquet prior
 to his departure for home.  Moreover, Le Duan went
 to Peking with the hope of signing several economic
 aid agreements, including a five-year pact, and there
 is ample evidence that the Chinese gave less than
 Hanoi requested.   The last working-level Vietnamese
 negotiator left China in mid-November after three
 months of talks--without any indication of further
 progress.   His departure virtually rules out the pos-
 sibility of any additional economic agreements between
 the two parties, at least for the time being.
 The Chinese clearly see a correlation between
 Hanoi's increasing tilt toward Moscow and the long-
 range possibilities for Soviet "meddling" through
 Vietnam in the South China Sea, as well as Southeast
 Asia generally.   It also is apparent that the Chinese
 consider control of islands in the area vitally im-
 portant to their security.   The People's Daily ar-
 ticle,  in fact, refers to the region as  "an important
 gate of China" and to the islands as located on major
 shipping lanes.

 For their part, the Soviets have been sharply
 critical of the Chinese seizure of the Paracels.
 Since early 1974, Moscow has routinely attacked
 China's claims to all of the islands and its use of
 force in the Paracels.   The Soviets, however, have
 stopped short of providing outright support to Hanoi's
 counterclaims.   Soviet maps still show the islands
 as belonging to China, although recent press comments
 have implied that they were Vietnamese.   A Soviet
 official recently said Moscow considers the status
 of both island groups as "undetermined."  Peking
 ignored these attacks until last week.    Then, the
 People's Daily article asserted that the Soviet
 Union, throwing aside earlier support for China's
 claims, mounted a "venomous" assault on Peking
 after the Paracels incident.
 Peking's long-term concerns almost certainly
 hinge on its view of Soviet intentions and activities.
 Chinese leaders also seem persuaded, however, that
 in the shorter run Hanoi could unilaterally disrupt
 their hopes of developing a bloc of friendly countries
 along China's southern border.   The Chinese and Viet-
 namese share very few common perceptions of Southeast
 Asia.   They are clearly on opposite sides in the cur-
 rent dispute between Thailand and Laos.   Hanoi has
 vigorously defended the Lao side and has launched
 frequent attacks on Thai "aggression."  Peking, on
 the other hand, has remained relatively quiet on the
 subject, privately lobbying for a peaceful solution
 to the disagreement and encouraging improved relations
 between the two countries.   The Chinese have been by
 far the largest contributors to Cambodian reconstruc-
 tion since the communists took over there last spring.
 Peking has also made it clear that it was on Cambodia's
 side in the border dispute with North Vietnam and ap-
 parently encouraged the Cambodian Communists to open
 diplomatic relations with Thailand.
 On the Sino-Vietnamese border itself, there

 cadre are being advised to stand firm in the face
 of alleged Vietnamese attempts to "occupy" Chinese
 territory.  Although these putative border incidents
 have not been confirmed and there is very little
 likelihood that a serious border dispute will develop,
 the fact that the Chinese continue to talk about
 such incidents suggests that Peking is determined to
 maintain a degree of anti-Vietnamese feeling along
 the border.

 The Tachai Campaign:   Provincial
 Returns Come In
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping reportedly described
 the September-October "learn-from-Tachai" conference
 as the most important meeting held in China since
 the communist take-over.  While Teng was obviously en-
 gaging in hyperbole, his remark underlines the im-
 portance that has been accorded to the Tachai campaign
 in the last few months.  Tachai now overshadows this
 year's two other major campaigns--strengthening pro-
 letarian dictatorship and criticizing the classical
 novel "Water Margin."  Reporting on virtually every
 organization in China is now in terms of learning
 from Tachai.
 this mass campaign
 will be further broadened with   a convening of a
 series of national meetings on other economic sectors
 and on culture.  A national coal conference has al-
 ready been held.
 Most provinces have held a series of mass ral-
 lies and other meetings to publicize the major ad-
 dresses at the conference by vice premiers Teng
 Hsiao-ping and Hua Kuo-feng, and to send off youths
 and cadres to rural areas.   The New China News Agency
 reported on November 25 that over one million cadres
 from 12 provinces had already gone to communes to
 engage in manual labor and to direct production.
 Most of these cadres appear to be from the hsien
 (county)  level, although a number of provincial and
 prefectural leaders have also gone to the country-
 side.   The function of the latter cadres seems to be
 to ensure that local cadres perform their duties with
 the necessary zeal.  Morale among local cadres has
 been badly shaken by a series of purges and campaigns
 dating from the Cultural Revolution and their reputa-
 tion has been tarnished by publicity accorded to ex-
 amples of corruption, sexual indiscretions, and a

 lack of initiative.   Domestic propaganda has made it
 clear that the hsien, and especially the hsien-level
 party committee, is the key level in administering
 the campaign.   Indeed, cadre rectification at the
 hsien level and below is one of the           emes of
 the campaign.                               rural
 cadres are alr   y appre ensive over the potential
 threat implied by "rectification," and the moderate
 leadership in Peking and in the provinces will have
 to monitor the campaign carefully lest criticism of
 cadres leads to a rekindling of factional animosities
 and the frustration of campaign goals.
 On the whole, however, significant progress
 has been made in curbing factionalism and increas-
 ing production this year.   Hong Kong leftists were
 told that Teng said that the key to success in agri-
 cultural work was reliance on old cadres.   Recent
 provincial rotations and new appointments seem to
 confirm that Peking holds this view.   Veteran cadres
 such as Fukien First Secretary Liao Chih-kao are re-
 portedly cracking down hard on factionalism and have
 transferred a number of noncompliant cadres. other hand,
 while v~urxers are  ina  y back-in the factories
 in Kunming and minority unrest has abated, new First
 Secretary Chia Chi-kun has not succeeded in getting
 the workers to increase production.
 The Tachai campaign already seems to be the
 most clearly defined and well-orchestrated campaign
 since the Cultural Revolution.   Given its scope, am-
 bitious goals, and rising volume of rhetoric, there
 is at least some danger that things could get out of
 hand.   But if current moderate leaders remain healthy
 and in agreement and can successfully manage the cam-
 paign with other efforts to correct trouble spots in
 the economy, fairly impressive gains may well be in

 Two top leaders have recently reappeared after
 significant absences.   Chiang Ching was present on
 December 1 at the meeting and picture taking session
 between President Ford and Chinese head of state Chu
 Te.   Her last appearance was on October 15 at the
 closing session of the national Tachai conference in
 Peking.  Chiang's political power has been sharply
 diminished this year, and her appearances now seem to
 be under the control of regime moderates and designed
 to promote an image of unity.   In the past, Madame
 Mao tended to punctuate periods of nonappearances
 with public activities that were designed to raise
 rather than lower political tensions.   Her association
 with the Tachai meeting was obviously meant to present
 a united front for this major undertaking-
 the circulation of a central
 political left for Sino-US relations.
 The other reappearance was Defense Minister Yeh
 Chien-ying, who headed the Chinese representation at
 the Peking celebrations of Albanian national day on
 November 29.  Yeh had not appeared since October 25
 and is widely rumored to be ill.   Surprisingly, Yeh
 did not see President Ford even though he played an
 important role in past meetings with ranking US of-
 ample of Chiang and Teng Hsiao-ping who took time off
 from the meetings to engage in manual labor.   Her
 presence at the meeting with President Ford is de-
 signed to convey the same message--the support of the
 document on the Tac ai movement that hails the ex-
 ficials.   Yeh's place seems to have been taken by
 another Chou En-lai stalwart, Vice Premier and lead-
 ing economic specialist Li Hsien-nien.

 France:  No Plums for Sauvagnargues
 French Foreign Minister Sauvagnargues'  five-
 day visit to China last month was apparently less
 than a total success from the French point of view.
 Exploratory talks
 during Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping's visit to Paris
 last spring had apparently progressed to the point
 where French officials felt that Sauvagnargues would
 be able to wrap up negotiations on at least some
 sales so that formal signing ceremonies could take
 place during President Valery Giscard d'Estaing's
 scheduled trip to Peking early next year.
 The Chinese, however, were apparently not in
 a buying mood.  The French foreign minister told
 reporters that he had been unsuccessful in his ef-
 forts at reopening talks on the Concorde.   Chinese
 claims that French prices were "not competitive"
 indicate that discussions on other sales were equally
 unproductive.   Officials in Sauvagnargues' party ad-

 relations--indicating that if President Giscard

 on Korea--which the Chinese held was not an urgent
 problem--were also glossed over.
 Both sides placed far more emphasis on congruent
 views on such matters as the need for European mili-
 tary and economic cooperation.   Peking used the occa-
 sion of Sauvagnargues' visit--coming as it did soon
 after the Rambouillet summit and before the Paris
 Conference on International Economic Cooperation--to
 voice support for European efforts at easing economic
 confrontation with the Third World.  Peking has long
 believed that further hardening of the confrontation
 would work to Moscow's advantage and sees Paris--
 with its strong residual ties to former colonial
 clients--as having a special role to play in promoting
 compromise between developed and developing nations.
 A People's Daily editorial published a week before
 Sauvagnargues' arrival in Peking stands as the most
 explicit Chinese endorsement yet of the establish-

 The Modernization of Bureaucracy in the PLA
 The Chinese are concerned about overstaffing
 in the PLA bureaucratic structure, but this may
 apply more to the lower levels than the upper reaches.
 Central Directive 18, which was issued in the summer
 and calls for modernization of the military, makes
 pejorative reference to an excessive number of offi-
 cers in the PLA.   Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping has
 also chastised the army for having too many staff
 positions and reportedly cited Mao as saying that
 all PLA staff organizations below the division level
 should beabolished.   Such criticism may be related
 to talk in Fukien about a new military regulation
 specifying that each unit should have only one com-
 mander and one deputy commander.   There is some evi-
 dence that an excessive number of officers in field
 units has often resulted in contradictory orders.
 In light of renewed emphasis on professionalism
 in the PLA, those cut loose may be working in a non-
 combat role.   Indeed, a broadcast from Kansu in late
 September praised a regiment which reduced the staff
 of its political department.   The cadres were sent
 down to work at the company level and engage in pro-
 ductive labor.
 The "Learn from Tachai" campaign also seems to
 be draining off quite a few officers.   Hunan Military
 District recently "transferred" 30 percent of its
 cadres to Tachai-related work.   In addition, 40 per-
 cent of the cadres in the military subdistrict and
 garrisons and 50 percent of the cadres in the people's
 armed forces departments were sent off to the country-
 side.                    It is unclear at this point whether these per-
 sonnel are on a short-term rotational assignment or
 for a longer term.   The Tachai campaign, however,
 probably has a certain amount of appeal to the mili-
 tary districts as a means of satisfying Peking's
 pressure for a reduction of staff slots.

 While the lower levels of the army may be
 trimming their bureaucratic fat, the military struc-
 ture at the higher echelons may be expanding.   Most
 striking is the increase in the number of deputy
 chiefs of staff and deputy directors of the General
 Political Department/General Logistics Department.

 A significant number of these appointments have
 been made since Central Directive 18 was issued in
 July, which suggests that the document's concern about
 overstaffing is not applicable at this level.   It is
 also quite possible that this staffing process has
 not yet concluded.   Furthermore, the unusually heavy
 turnout at national day of personnel from the Na-
 tional Defense Scientific and Technological Commis-
 sion and the military academies indicates Peking's in-
 creasing interest in enlarging the staffs concerned
 with the technical aspects of warfare.
 In addition to an increase of personnel, there
 is also limited evidence pointing to the formation
 of some new staffs.
 "advisory groups" have been attached to important
 units in the central military structure.   The groups

 are reportedly authorized to make inspections and
 offer suggestions, but are not empowered to issue
 orders.   Lo Jui-ching is said to have been appointed
 chief of the advisory group appended to the General
 Staff Department, and Chen Tsai-tao has been brought
 to Peking to serve on this group.   Presumably these
 groups are concerned with purely military affairs.
 This report seems to jibe with the grouping of Lo and
 Chen together in the National Day name list.   Their
 placement on the list seemed to put them in a category
 by themsleves, not clearly identified with any par-
 ticular military body or responsibility.   In the area
 of strategic planning,  a new directorate may have
 been established recently to plot strategic and de-
 velopment plans for the future.
 Lo Jui-ching heads this unit.
 These tenuous indicators of a new staffing pat-
 tern gives some indication of how Central Directive
 18 is being implemented.   It seems likely that a
 major effort to upgrade the professional quality of
 the PLA would call forth more and larger staffs at
 the higher planning levels of the military establish-
 ment.   Professionalization tends to demand special-
 ization.   This process in time will probably have
 implications for the PLA's role.   As modernization
 moves forward and the army's command structure con-
 tinues to expand, pressure from within this structure
 may well be generated to reduce the PLA's involvement
 in activities which do not contribute to military
 proficiency.

 Afternoon Chats in Hong Kong
 Fei I-min, publisher of the PRC owned Ta Kung
 Pao, recently engaged in a tour d'horizon of the
 Chinese leadership over lunch with US diplomats in
 Hong Kong.        Fei sometimes tailors his remarks to
 suit his audience and is not a totally reliable
 source; nonetheless, he does have access to a good
 bit of information concerning the relationships of
 regime leaders.
 Fei began by noting that the health of the long
 hospitalized Premier Chou En-lai had improved and
 that he was seeing his private secretary and "making
 decisions."   Fei is a strong Chou supporter, and his
 remarks must be taken with a grain of salt.  While
 Chou might have improved a little, he is not likely
 to resume an active day-to-day administrative role.
 More interesting and possibly more accurate
 were Fei's remarks concerning Politburo member Wei
 Kuo-ching, who was recently transferred from the
 top party post in Kwangsi to the same post in Kwang-
 tung.   Wei was alleged to have had a long and inti-
 mate relationship with ranking Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping, and the Hong Kong publisher implied that
 Teng was behind the transfer (see following article).
 Wei is now the second Politburo member to be sta-
 tioned in Canton--Hsu Shih-yu was moved there in
 the rotation of regional commanders in late 1973.
 If Wei, who is the first political commissar of the
 Canton Military Region, is close to Teng, his transfer
 implies that the relationship between Teng and Hsu
 may leave something to be desired.  Wei could become
 the most potent political figure                ina.

 tain considerable influence there.

 Also of note were Fei's reservations about
 Vice Premier Chang Chun-chiao.   Despite the fact
 that Chang is 63, Fei considered him too young and
 inexperienced, but admitted that Chang is exercising
 a great deal of responsibility.  While Fei was ob-
 viously expressing his personal views, his feelings
 may be shared by some Chou supporters in Peking.
 Fei added that Chang had a close relationship with
 Hsu Shih-yu, whose former command bordered Shanghai,
 but this assertion seems to be at variance with the
 animosity between the two during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.  Fei went on to note that Chang had military
 and administrative ties to the late foreign minister
 Chen I, who like Teng was a Szechuanese--a state-
 ment that seemed designed to imply a linkage between
 Chang and Teng Hsiao-ping.
 After standard remarks about several other top
 leaders, Fei dropped one last bit of inside informa-
 tion.   Politburo member Chi Teng-kuei, whose politi-
 cal fortunes have been rising slowly but steadily in
 the last few years, was alleged to have been chief of
 the party office responsible for coordination between
 the party and the government in 1973.   Pei added that
 this amounted to liaison between Mao and Chou.   If
 true, such service would obviously have been of bene-
 fit to Chi and may help explain his rising power.
 However, Fei did not remark on any links between Chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping, which would seem to be the po-
 tentially most rewarding personal political tie to
 have at the present.

 The Kwangsi Connection
 Ta Kung Pao publisher Fei I-min's assertion
 that Party Vice Chairman Teng Hsiao-ping and new
 Kwangtung First Secretary Wei Kuo-ching have had a
 long and intimate relationship adds weight to a
 large body of circumstantial evidence pointing in
 the same direction.   That Wei and Teng have long
 known each other seems indisputable; in 1930 the
 two helped to organize the 7th Chinese Peasants'
 Red Army in Kwangsi.  They were survivors of the
 force that eventually joined Mao in the Kiangsi
 soviet in 1931.   Both took part in the Long March
 (1934-35)  but joined different units; Teng went
 with Liu Po-cheng while Wei joined Chen I's forces.
 Following the Communist victory in 1949, Wei
 became mayor of Fuchou, while Teng assumed more sub-
 stantial national and regional posts.  The two may
 have had an opportunity to work together  riefly
 in 1950.                                  Teng was
 the first secretary of the East China Bureau in the
 first six months of 1950 before going to the newly
 formed Southwest Bureau headquartered in Chungking.
 Wei remained a relatively obscure official until
 1954 when Teng, by then a vice premier, became sec-
 retary general of the party.   In that year Teng ap-
 parently played a major role in the purge of Polit-
 buro member Kao Kang and Organization Department
 Director Jac, Shu-shih, alleged co-conspirators in
 an anti-party plot.  Wei, who was identified between
 early 1953 and late 1954 only as a commander of
 public security forces, may have assisted Teng in
 the investigation of the conspiracy.   Wei's election
 to governor of Kwangsi in 1955, just before the plot
 was announced, may in part have been linked to that
 event.   Teng, who has a reputation for bringing
 friends up on his own coattails, may have been a
 major sponsor of Wei for his first important provin-
 cial assignment.

 In 1957, following two years of crop failures,
 Wei survived the dismissal of three top Kwangsi of-
 ficials accused of mishandling relief grain.  The
 defense that Wei was out of the province during the
 period cannot be refuted but seems flimsy; his sur-
 vival suggests high-level support in the party, per-
 haps from Teng.  As his survival of the Cultural Rev-
 olution attests, Wei undoubtedly has had well-placed
 backers other than Teng, but Teng's influence seems
 paramount.   Teng moreover, has championed minority
 causes, and Wei is from the Chuang minority.   In
 his report on the 1953 Electoral Law and the 1957
 Report on the Rectification Campaign, Teng made major
 allowances for minorities.   In the 1957 speech he
 advocated a moderate approach to settling minority
 problems--a stance criticized during the Cultural
 Revolution.
 Teng's support of Wei may have been returned in
 kind.    Wei, who joined the Politburo in August 1973,
 four months before Teng was reinstated, has been in
 a position to support an old ally's resurgence to
 power while simultaneously advancing his own career.

 Setbacks on the Arabian Peninsula

 licly, Peking undoubtedly views recent Soviet mili-
 tary dealings on the Arabian Peninsula as blows to

 The Chinese will regard any Russian arms sale to

 from its own dealings with the Kuwaitis that they are
 not interested in what Moscow is selling ideologically.
 Kuwait--with its massive oil revenues--can fill its
 military shopping list without having to accept any
 political strings from Moscow.   Still, the symbolic
 stakes are such that Peking would unquestionably be
 pleased if the current Soviet-Kuwaiti negotiations
 fall through.
 If the sales do materialize, Peking's propa-

 Soviet efforts to fuel the regional arms race in
 general and the border dispute between Kuwait and
 Iraq in particular.   Peking has been working hard

 recipient of Soviet military assistance--and Russian
 sales to Kuwait would clearly facilitate such Chinese
 Chinese leaders probably take a much darker
 view of the movement toward closer Soviet military
 ties with the two Yemens.   The Chinese have them-
 selves paid more attention to the two mutually an-
 tagonistic regimes since the reopening of the Suez
 Canal earlier this year:   Aden and Sana share control
 over the Arabian side of the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait
 through which all shipping between the Canal and the
 Indian Ocean must pass.   Coupled with recent French
 moves toward granting independence to the faction-
 ridden French Territory of the Afars and Issas--
 occupying the opposite side of the Bab-el-Mandeb
 Strait--and the steadily increasing Soviet naval
 presence in neighboring Somalia, Moscow's maneuvering
 in the Yemens can only have heightened Chinese paranoia
 over Soviet designs for military dominance in the area
 and broader Soviet intentions in the Indian Ocean.
 Peking has clearly been banking on closer re-
 gional economic, political, and military cooperation
 by moderate forces in the area--such as Saudi Arabia
 and Iran--to dilute Soviet influence with the Yemenis.
 Saudi policy toward North Yemen, how-
 ever, was a prime factor in President Hamdi's deci-
 sion to seek more military aid from Moscow, and a
 Chinese official in Sana recently made no secret of
 his government's consternation over this counter-
 productive Saudi role.   The official made a direct
 linkage between the Soviet arms deal and President
 Hamdi's displeasure over the abortive Saudi effort
 last month to mediate between Sana and conservative
 North Yemeni tribal leaders.   The Chinese official
 blamed the US for not warning Riyadh of the "probable
 effects" of such Saudi "intervention in internal"
 Yemeni affairs.

 There may also be more subtle. considerations
 behind the Chinese bitterness.   Peking was clearly
 encouraged by the brief thaw in relations between
 Sana and Riyadh this summer and may have been look-
 ing to the day when President Hamdi could have been
 used as an intermediary to gain Peking an opening
 with the new Saudi leadership.  China is well aware
 that escalated oil prices have given Saudi Arabia
 increased economic and political clout, and Peking
 has been seeking some means of breaking ground with
 the staunchly anti-communist Saudis.  Any Chinese
 hopes of working through Sana have been dashed by
 the renewed freeze in Saudi - North Yemeni relations.
 The Chinese almost certainly view the renewed
 Soviet military deliveries to the maverick regime
 in South Yemen as a reversal of what Peking has re-
 garded heretofore as a favorable trend of events.
 The recent improvement in relations between South
 Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the visit to Aden this spring
 by World Bank President MacNamara--which the Chinese
 read as a sign of more moderate US views toward
 South Yemen--and the winding down of the Aden-sup-
 ported Dhofar rebellion in neighboring Oman, all
 fit well with China's own quiet efforts to promote
 reconciliation and cooperation among the region's
 moderates and radicals.  While the recent Soviet
 military assistance to Aden probably does not portend
 any resurgence of activity by the Dhofar rebels, it
 does carry the risk of a wider conflict between South
 Yemeni and Omani units along the border.  Moreover,
 Aden's increased willingness to deal with Moscow may
 prove to be an obstacle to any further moves toward
 rapprochement with Saudi Arabia.
 While all of this cuts the wrong way from Pe-
 king's outlook, Chinese options for countering the
 Soviet initiatives in South Yemen--or in Sana--are

 equipment--unable to compete in the field of mili-

 amounts of economic assistance to both countries
 and may increase such aid somewhat to sharpen the
 impact of its anti-Soviet blandishments.   In large
 part, however, the Chinese will have to continue to
 depend on less radical Arab states to prevent further
 Soviet entrenchment on the peninsula, a prospect that
 is probably unsettlina to Peking in light of the re-
 cent events there.
