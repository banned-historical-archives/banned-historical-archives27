 MEMO for                     STATINTL
 It would help me a  great deal in preparing
 the 27 June briefing                       to
 know the following:
 a)    How big will the audience be?
 b)    Roughly how big a room is it?
 c)    Are there standard Vu-graph fac6lities?
 d)    What will prior briefings have covered?
 (i.e., if the Pentagon has already
 briefed them on the course of the war
 in Vietnam, or the Soviet and Chinese
 military posture, that will amount to
 significant chunks I don't have to
 cover---on the other hand,  I can readily
 include these topics if they are not
 being briefed on them by somebody eI'se.)
 Many thanks,

 I.I. An Indonostan-Malaysian agreement was reachod
 Bangkok on 1 June but so far it has not been
 made public.  The agreement provides for the
 immediate resumption of,diplomatic relations,
 the cessation of hostilities, and a reaffirma-

 and Sarawak--as to their desire to remain in
 Malaysia; this last phase is to be carried out
 by general elections "as soon as practicable."

 2.  There is some question as to how far the

 Should the triumvirs assess prospects
 as poor, they probably would postpone

 political temperature on Cyrpus up again.
 Makarios twice this month has blockaded Turkish sector
 of Nicosia, citing bombing incidents in Greek sector. Actually
 part and parcel of his strategy to erode position of Turk Cypsxal
 and their confidence in their leadership both on island and
 in Turkey.   Turks didn't help by making what amounted to
 ultimatum and then taking no action.   Athens has very
 limited means of restraining Makarios.   If nothing else,
 such actions remind Greek and Turkish negotiators that
 Makarios will have w t?Matx virtually final say on any
 agreements over future of the island.
 Turkish Cypriots aim for de facto partition,  and they
 took a step in this direction, without running counter to
 aims of Makarios,  when they withdrew their judges from
 Nicosia courts--one of few remains of official cooperation
 between the two communities.
 Still possibility Turks may in fact react in desperation,
 but there has been no return to the likelihood of such action
 that existed in June of 1964,  altho th Turks would be better
 prepared for it now.
 Cyppus has created difficulties in US rels with both
 Greece and Turkey--especially Turks
 Greeks wants enosis---union with Greece--have Gen. Grivas
 and strong Greek troop oncitngent on Cyprus to see if this
 cant be brought about.   So far,  Makarios remains outside
 their control, acting independently.   Greek govt too shaky
 to take strong action,  too shaky to put across the concessions
 which would have to be made for any agreement with Turkey.

 New countries hour of Africa has little stability.
 Leadership is awfully thin,  and elements of power very
 shallow.   A few determined and armed men can take over
 a country, as in Zanzibar.   Add to this Sino-Soviet
 competition, directed both against each other and against
 Western world----the scars of colonial admin,  the vast
 expectations of the Africans,  --and you have a volatile
 situation which is surprising only in that there has been
 much stabi ity jas existed over the past few years.

 more disruptive than constructive, and in field of economy
 doesn't understand facts of life.  For instance has decreed
 Congolese goods after June 30 cant move over Angola,
 whichw will hit Katangan exports hard.
 Rebels still in bush, far from stamped out and could
 become active again if Mobutu, as threatens in his
 present nationalist mood, dismisses mercenaries.

 LATIN AME RICA
 Could have mentioned counter-insurgency in connection
 with any area, but Latin America offers some of best
 examples of problems and cures.         (MAP, SOUTH VIETNAM 1959)
 Here's SVN five years after Dien Bien Phu,  when Hanoi
 ordered stay-behind guerrilla assets to begin operations.
 Note six red spots,  and how they grew in succeeding   years.

 Here's another map with six red splotches---Colombia,
 showing the areas which have been referred to as Communist
 enclaves.
 Colombia plagued by bandits who made countryside unsafe
 as far back as Spanish vice-regency of 16h century.   Not
 until 1930s that banditry took on political overtones.
 When Liberal Party electiob victory ended 30 years of
 Conservative Party rule, an outbreak of vicious partisan
 killings swept country.   There was a religious fervor to
 party affiliations---and in fact, Church-State controversy
 entered into it.    1946, power changed x hands again.
 Liberals rallied around Gaitan.   Assassination in Bogota
 in 1948 :led to Bogotazo, army take-over by Rojas Pinilla.
 Opposition to him finally ended the political z gang warfare
 in hinterland as his opponents united to get rid of him,
 but meanwhile 1948 to 1964, by conservative  estimate
 150,000 killed---some estimates double that.
 Psychotic,  senseless terror continues,  and Commies

 We're in band-aid stage of CI,  civic action,   patching
 up vulnerabilities so Commies can't exploit,  rather than
 eliminating them. Takes patience. Colombia good start, maybe
