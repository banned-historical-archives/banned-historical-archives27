 ARAB-ISRAELI                   ISSUE
 TASS STATEMENT SAYS ISRAELI RAIDS ON LEBANON JEOPARDIZE PEACE
 In the first such gesture since May 1970; Moscow on 22 June
 issued a TASS statement denouncing the Israeli strikes against
 Palestinian targets in Lebanon that began on the 3,8th.*  TASS
 accused Israel of escalating tension in the Middle East at a
 time when possibilities for attaining agreement on peace were
 "better than ever."  The statement reflects Moscow's continuing
 effort to build up its image of solidarity with the Arabs,
 particularly in light of Cairo reports on the 21st that President
 as-Cadat had appealed to President Nixon to restrain Israel from
 further raids on Lebanon.
 The TASS statement placed "total responsibility" on the Israeli
 leadership and government for the "deliberate". buildup of tension,
 which it said jeopardized the peace and security of all nations
 in the region.  There was no repetition of the vague warning in
 the May 1970 TASS statement that Israel's."adventurist" policies
 were fraught with dangerous consequences for Israel itself.  Nor
 did the current statement make even an indirect reference to the
 United States, as the 1970 statement had done in mentioning
 Israel's "support from external imperialist circles."  But Soviet
 comment and reportage on the recent raids employed the device of
 citing Arab sources to link the United States with Tel Aviv's
 actions.  For example, a TASS dispatch from Beirut on the 22d
 and a Rassadin foreign-language commentary the following day
 noted that Beirut circles were drawing attention to the fact that
 Israel's "new aggression" followed shortly after President Nixon's
 Mideast tour, and TASS on the 23d reported a Lebanese parliamentarian's
 charge that Israel, "with U.S. connivance," was.bombing Lebanon's
 cities and villages.  Moscow's Arabic-language serv.ce on the 24th
 carried a recorded statement by Palestinu Liberation Organization
 chairman Yasir 'Arafat, who called the raids "an American-Israeli
 imperialist aggression."  'Arafat added that "it was approved .vid
 encouraged, as the U.S.-Israeli joint statement reveals, during tiro,
 visit of U.S. President Nixon to Palestine"--a remark that Moscow
 deleted during a subsequent Arabic rebroadcast of his statement later
 the same day.
 *  Moscow in September 1972 atypically issued a Soviet Government
 statement in response to Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Syria.  Other
 ~h.an a government statement of March 1968 pegged to an attack on Jordan,
 the usual Soviet vehicle for response bas been a TASS statement, five
 of which were issued between November 1968 and May 1970 in connection
 with Israeli attacks on Arab countries,

 Moscow has given low-keyed attention to Israeli. Defense Minister
 Peres' current military aid talks in Washington, but an Arabic-
 language commentary on the 25th professed to see a connection
 between his visit and Israel's announced intention of pursuing
 its actions against the Palestinians.  The commentary called
 attention to reports in Western media of Israel's "nuclear
 ambitions"  and its efforts to obtain, a large volume of U.S.
 military aid, and observed that Tel Aviv should not need all this
 if the Middle East were really proceeding toward, peace rather
 than. war. TASS on the 215th reported that Secretary Schlesinger.
 "tried to justify" the "very impressive" military aid program
 by arguing that Israel's partial withdrawal under the di.sengagen;sn.t
 agreements "allegedly deprives Israel of its earlier territorial
 buffer."
 PALESTINIAN ATTACKS      As is typical of Soviet comment on Israeli
 counteractions,. the TAUS statement portrayed
 the victims as peaceful Lebanese and Palestinian civilians and re-
 jected as "totally absurd" Israeli attempts to justify these "villainous
 actions" as retaliation for "the actions of the Palestinians."  Moscow
 virtually ignored the 13 June fedayeen attack on Kibbutz Shamir
 which preceded the most recent Israeli counterraids.  The only reference
 to that incident came in a statement by Israeli Communist Party
 Secretary General Vilner who, according to a Radio Peace and Progress
 broadcast in Arabic on the 24th, rejected the "traditional justification"
 of retaliation for extremist actions resulting in the deaths of
 civilians in Qiryat Shemona, Ma'alot, and Shamir.
 Comment and reportage on the 15 May attack in Ma'alot blamed the
 Israelis for the tragic outcome but conveyed Soviet disapproval of
 international terrorism in general, along with some cautious
 criticism of the fedayeen's seizure of children as hostages.*.  A
 Radio Peace and Progress broadcast in Arabic on 25 May, for example,
 asserted that the holding of pupils as hostages. "aroused condemnation
 among Arab public opinion," and cited a PLO official spokesman as
 calling the action "a sad affair."
 *  Moscow's treatment of the Ma'alot incident and subsequent ..Israeli
 attacks on Lebanon is discussed in the TRENDS of :12 May 1974, pages
 8-9.'

 EUROPE
 USSR DISPARAGES NATO DECLARATION AS CONTRIVED, CONTRADICTORY
 In comment on the semiannual meeting of NATO foreign ministers held
 18-19 June in Ottawa, Moscow has portrayed the adopted declaration
 on Atlantic relations as a display of artificial unity designed to
 conceal persistent political differences among the various NATO
 countries.  Moscow has also emphasized that the document as a whole
 is internally inconsistent in that it mixes appreciation of changes
 under detente with outdated appeals for increased NATO military
 utrength.  Expressed principally in generalities and stock
 denunciations of NATO as a "militaristic anachronisth," Soviet comment
 for the most part has avoided any precise discussion of details in
 the 14-point declaration.  To reinforce its charges that the document
 is contrived and contradictory, Moscow han stressed its controversial
 history and has highlighted various passages out of context, in
 particular the statement in point five that "the essential elements
 in the situation which gave rise to the [NATO] treaty have not
 changed."
 U.S.-EUROPEAN     In recounting the evolution of the new declaration,
 RELATIONS         Soviet cc:ament has pressed the theme that the NATO
 countries have found it increasingly difficult under
 present-day conditions to reconcile their national differences.  Much
 of the comment has asserted that the contentious question of arranging
 appropriate consultations between the United States and its European
 allies epitomizes these difficulties.  Speaking on Moscow radio's
 weekly international observers roundtable on 23 June, for instance,
 IZVESTIYA's deputy chief editor Nikolay Polyanov.characterized the
 issue of consultations and relative independence in decision-making
 as "the heart of the entire problem" for mutual relations within NATO.
 Polyanov concluded; as have most other Soviet commentators, that the
 new declaration reflects an attempt, necessLtated by the impact of
 changed world conditions in recent years, to provide the Atlantic
 alliance with an appearance of unity and NATO with a rationale for
 existing.
 NATO AND     As is typical in Soviet media treatment of NATO affairs,
 DETENTE     Moscow has charged that the military alliance represents
 a narrow-based, outdated approach to European security
 that is inconsistent with the goals of detente and the ideals of
 broader all-European cooperation embodied in such approaches as the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).  In this

 regard, Soviet comment has alleged that favorable references to
 detente and CSCE  in the new NATO declaration are canceled out
 by the document's more predominant and pervasive emphasis on a
 military-oriented approach to European relations.  PRAVDA Commen-
 tator. T. Kolesnichenko.,. in his Moscow radio. review-of the'-week's
 events broadcast to North America on 24 June, for example, was
 particularly explicit in claiming that the declaration "stresses
 a more active NATO war machine."  Kolesnichenko added that "in
 spite of all the talk" recently that NATO would be reoriented
 toward political problems, NATO's actual goal is "to revive the
 cold war and the military confrontation between countries with
 differing social systems."
 BRUSSELS SUMMIT     Moacow has reacted in low-keyed fashion to the
 Brussels meeting of President Nixon and other
 NATO heads of state which included the ceremonial signing of the
 NATO declaration on 26 June.  While Soviet media had noted in
 advance only the fact and purpose of the gathering, TASS on the
 26th, reporting that the NATO leaders had aigneJ the declaration,
 asserted that the document basically repeated the "'well-known
 principles" of the North Atlantic bloc.  TASS added that the
 declaration was "a compromise" between the U.S. desire for the
 dominant role in NATO and the West Europeans' efforts to increase
 their say in world affairs.

 ILICHEV RETURNS TO PEKING; MOSCOW REITERATES BORDER STANCE
 TASS announced on 25 June that the chief Soviet negotiator at the
 stalled Peking border talks, Deputy Foreign Minister Ilichev, had
 returned to Peking that day after an unprecedented 11-month
 absence.  At the same time Moscow seemed to be signaling that no
 immediate developments should be expected at the talks by its
 extensive publicity for a lengthy Polish discussion of the history
 of the Sino-Soviet border talks first carried in the Polish govern-
 ment paper ZYCIE WARSZAWY.  TASS reporting on 23, 24 and 25 June
 and PRAVDA accounts on the 26th in effect reiterated Moscow's
 oft-repeated belief that Peking "is not interested in practical
 and real agreements" with Moscow on concrete border questions and
 that the next move must still come from Peking.
 The ZYCIE WARSZAWY assessment of the talks by Adam Wysocki, co-editor
 of the paper and a member of the presidium of the Association of
 Polish Journalists, came on the heels of a 22 June TASS report of
 a new Soviet Foreign Ministry statement protesting Peking's
 continued detention of a Soviet helicopter crew.  The statement,
 though it was the fourth since the helicopter's capture on 14 March,
 was moderate in tone and devoid of threats of retaliatory action.
 This most recent representation to Peking on the helicopter incident
 and the return of Ilicheev together could be interpreted as evidence
 of Moscow's intention to continue a persuasive approach in its
 attempts to obtain release of the crew.
 The timing of Ilichev's return may also have been influenced by
 President Nixon's imminent visit to Moscow.  Last year Ilichhev
 arrived in Peking in May after returning to Moscow for the April 1973
 plenum--which set the stage for Brezhnev's visits to Bonn and
 Washington--and subsequently, in the shadow of the Washington summit,
 presented the Chinese with a proposed nonaggression pact.  Moscow's
 sensitivity to the implications the U.S.-Soviet summit may have for
 its relations with Peking was registered in a 20 June article by
 PRAVDA observer Viktor Mayevskiy, who accused Peking of trying to
 interfere with the Nixon visit.

 "blocking" the talks by advancing unacceptable preconditions for
 opening specific technical discussions.  In this respect as well
 as others, Wysocki's analysis closely paralleled the most recent
 comprehensive account in Soviet media; presented by Oleg Borisov
 in the 16 May IZVESTIYA.  It also pointed to the continuity of
 Moscow's posture adopted in the wake of Ilichev'a departure from
 Peking in July 1973.*
 TASS reported that Soviet Ambassador to Peking Tolstikov and the
 head of the Chinese delegation to the border talks Yu Chan were
 among those present at the airport to welcome Ilichev.  Moscow
 has regularly reported Ilichev's return to the Peking talks from
 Moscow, but has not recently reported the presence of any Chinese
 officials to welcome him.  Peking, as is its usual custom, did not
 publicize Ilichev's arrival.
 *  Developments in the wake of Ilichev's departure are discussed in
 the TRENDS of 25 July 1973, pages 13-14, and 29 August 1973, pages 4-6.

 CEMA MEETING
 SOFIA SESSION RECORDS "UNANIMITY., " ACCOMMODATES INDEPENDENTS
 The communique on the 28th CEMA session, held in Sofia 18-21 June,
 indicated greater agreement than at last year's'meeting in record-
 ing an atmosphere of "complete unanimity," as well as friendship
 and fraternal cooperation.  By contrast, last year's final communique
 on the 27th CEMA session, held in Prague 5-8 June 1973, reported
 only "complete mutual understanding"--a formulation allowing for
 unresolved divergent positions--as well as friendship.  The meeting
 in Sofia., which also commemorated CEMA's 25th anniversary, was
 attended by the USSR's Kosygin and the premiers of the East
 European member countries and Mongolia, Cuban Deputy Premier
 Rodriguez, Yugoslav Premier Bijedic, and the North Vietnamese
 and North Korean ambassadors to Sofia as "observers."  The last
 time bloc party first secretaries also attended a CEMA session
 was the session held in Bucharest in July 1971, which adopted
 the long-range CEMA economic integration program.
 While the final communique hewed largely to such practical
 matters as implementation of the 1971 integration program,
 coordination of national economic plans, and fuel and power,
 a separate statement issued by the conferees to commemorate the
 25th anniversary of CEMA, as well as the speeches by Kosygin
 and CEMA Secretary Faddeyev, generalized on CEMA's role in
 terms acceptable to the independently minded Romanians and
 Yugoslavs.*  Thus, the anniversary "decision" read at the open-
 ing session on the 18th by host Bulgarian Premier :ndorov and
 Faddeyev's speech underscored the "sovereignty" and "equality"
 of the CEMA member countries and the development of,economic
 relations with "all" socialist countries which are not members
 of CEMA.

 and Ceausescu on that occasion was characterized merely as "comradely."
 Kosygin's "exchange of views" with Yugoslav Premier Bijedic in Sofia
 was reported briefly by Moscow radio on the 20th, with no indication
 of the atmosphere.

 contrast to the "manifestations of rivalry" said to exist in
 relations between capitalist states. Kosygin's heavy stress,
 at the same time, on the rule of CEMA in strengthening the
 cohesion and unity of the socialist countries was in tune with
 the message sent to the meeting by Brezhnev, broadcast by Moscow
 radio on the 18th.  Brezhnev's message, while underscoring the
 "equality" of the CEMA member states, did not allude to their
 sovereignty.  Predictably, both the speech by Romanian Premier
 Manescu at the Sofia meeting on the 18th and the message to the
 session from Ceausescu stressed the "full" equality, sovereignty,
 and independence of the CEMA member states, as well as economic
 cooperation with "all" the socialist states.
 While the main pronouncements at the Sofia session, like last
 year's Prague communique, avoided any direct call for relations
 between CEMA and the EC, Faddeyev did note-on the 18th that detente
 had "led to the expansion of mutually beneficial economic ties
 between the CEMA countries and West European and other economically
 developed capitalist countries."  He also Hated the agreement
 signed in May between CEMA and Finland, CEMA's cooperation with
 the United Nations and other international organizations, and
 the "interest in cooperation with CEMi" shown by Mexico, Iraq,
 South Yemen, Argentina "and other countries."  Similarly, the
 anniverr.ary decision hailed CEMA's agreement with Finland, its
 relations with "more than 20" international bodies, and the
 military and economic aid given by CEMA countries to North Vietnam.
 YUGOSLAV ROLE     Belgrade's concern to maintain a flexible
 stance vis-a-vis CEMA appeared reflected in the
 fact that this year, as at the 1972 CEMA session in Moscow, it
 was represented by Premier Bijedic, while it had lowered its
 representation to the 6eputy premier level at the 1.973 meeting
 in Prague.  While not a member of the body, Yugoslavia "participates"
 in the work of certain CEMA commissions on the basis of a September
 1964 agreement.  In his speech on the 18th Bijedic underscored the
 Yugoslavs' "growing interest" in stepping up bilateral and multi-
 lateral economic agreements with CEMA member states.  Pointedly,
 he also noted that such principles as sovereignty, equality,
 independence, and noninterference were "incorporated" in the 1971
 CEMA integration program.  This year's 21 June final communique
 went a step further than last year's in stating that Yugoslavia
 "will take part in the multilateral integration'.', measures of
 CEMA; the 8 June 1973 communique said merely that multilateral
 "cooperation" between the CEMA countries and Yugoslavia would
 be expanded.

 ?           At the conclusion of the Sofia session a Kicovic commentary
 carried in the Belgrade domestic service on the 22d implicitly
 defended Belgrade's independence in the realm of foreign trade,
 noting that such CEMA members as the USSR, Poland, and Hungary
 carry on "nearly half" of their foreign trade with.non-CEMA
 countries.  At the same time the talk praised Yugoslavia's
 10-year participation in CEMA activities, adding that its
 participation would grow with "the solui:ion of certain unresolved
 problems, for which a mutual readiness was demonstrated at
 Sofia."  BTA on the 21st reported that Bijedic had been awarded
 a CEMA anniversary medal, to be given to Tito for the Yugoslav
 leader's contribution to Belgrade-CEMA cooperation.
 PEKING ATTACK     NCNA on the 23th noted CEMA's 25th anniversary
 with a new attack on the organization as an
 instrument used by the Soviet leaders to plunder, exploit, and
 "practice neocolonialism in" the CEMA member countries.  In
 documenting these allegations, the commentary pointed to Moscow's
 relations with the orthodox CEMA members--Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
 East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Mongolia--without mentioning
 the maverick member, Romania.  Five years ago, a 5 February 1969
 NCNA commentary in the wake of a 21-23 January Moscow meeting
 commemorating CEMA's 20th anniversary leveled Peking's usual
 charges against the organization but did not mention the anniversary.
 This year NCNA on 25 June carried a commentary devoted entirely
 to the Romanians and CEMA, reviewing articles in. the Bucharest
 biweekly ERA SOCIALISTA and the daily SCINTEIA,both published
 prior to the Sofia meeting, criticizing "supranational economic
 integration" as an infringement of sovereignty.

 USSR
 FOREIGN POLICY OFFICIALS GAIN SUPREME SOVIET STATUS
 The list of newly elected Supreme Soviet deputies published
 in the 19 June PRAVDA reveals that several key figures in the
 foreign policy establishment have for the first time become
 members of the Soviet legislature.  The most prominent new
 additions are USA Institute Director G.A. Arbatov, Institute
 of World Economy and International Relations Director N.N.
 Inozemtsev, and Brezhnev's personal foreign policy assistant,
 A.M. Aleksandrov-Agentov.  P.A. Abrasimov, head of an unidentified
 Central Committee section in the field of foreign affairs, was
 reelected to the Supreme Soviet after a lapse of many years.
 Other new additions include Institute of Marxism-Leninism Director
 A.G. Yegorov and KGB Deputy Chairman V.M. Chebrikov, while those
 dropped from the Supreme Soviet include retired senior statesman
 A.I. Mikoyan, Culture Mini&iter Ye. A. Furtseva, and longtime
 Central Committee section head N.N. Orgauov.
 The addition of Arbatov and Inozemtsev to the Supreme Soviet
 clearly reflects the rise in the status of their institutes,
 since few institute directors have been accorded this honor in
 the past.  The election of Brezhnev's foreign policy assistants
 A.M. Aleksandrov-Agentov and K.V. Rusakov also reflects the
 increased importance of foreign affairs.  Rusakov had been elected
 to the Supreme Soviet in 1970, at a time when he headed the
 Central Committee's bloc relations section.  The two officials
 join G.E. Tsukanov, who until this year was the only Brezhnev
 assistant to hold Supreme Soviet status.  Aside from the administrator
 of affairs of the USSR Council of Ministers, M.S. Smirtyukov, who
 was also a Supreme Soviet deputy in 1966 and 1970, no other
 assistant of Kosygin nor any of Podgornyy's was elected this
 year.
 Abrasimov had been replaced in April 1973 as ambassador to France
 and became head of a Central Cc  sittee section.  Although the
 section has never been publicly identified, Abrasimov has dealt
 exclusively with foreign affairs--bloc countries, France and
 the Arab countries--and has lectured at important conferences of
 Soviet foreign affairs and foreign trade officials in July and
 December 1973.

 KGB })eputy Chairman V.M. Chebrikov, a former party official
 from erezhnev's home oblast of Dnepropetrovsk, was elected-to
 the Supreme Soviet for the first time this year, joining KGB
 Chairman Andrnpov and First Deputy Chairman S.K. T5vigun, an
 old Brezhnev crony, both of whom had also been elected in 1970.
 Mikoyan was presumably not reelected to the Supreme Soviet
 this year because of age; he is 79.  Furtseva's fall from favor
 was telegraphed by the dissemination of reports linking her to
 a scandal connected with the construction of an extravagantly
 expensive personal dacha.  The 73-year old Organov, who headed
 an unidentified section of the Central Committee since early
 1967, when he was relieved as ambassador to Bulgaria, presumably
 lost his Central Committee post by late 1973.  While PRAVDA on
 3 March 1973 had identified him as first deputy chairman of the
 Soviet-Bulgarian Friendship Society and as head of a Central
 Committee section, on 13 November that same.paper identified him
 only in the former post.  Organov's section apparently handled
 foreign affairs, since virtually all his public activitieq con-
 cerned bloc countries and he belonged to the Supreme Soviet
 Council of Nationalities' foreign affairs commission.

 HANOI. PRG SCORE UPS, POLICIESi SUSPEND JMC TALKS MAIN
 The Vi&4':namese communists have taken steps to focus attention
 on the impasse tr.-,t exists in their relations with Washington
 and Saigon, perhapa in an effort to demonstrate persuasively
 on the eve of President Nixon's Moscow visit their dissatisfaction
 with the implementation of the peace agreement.  The Soviet
 public stance on Vietnam has moved closer to that of its Vietnamese
 allies since the last U.S.-Soviet summit during Brezhnev's visit
 to the United States in Jane 1973, when r'oscow was carefully
 avoiding any official criticism of U.S. actions in Vietnam.
 Last fall Soviet leaders began to openly accuse the United States
 of supporting Saigon "violations" of the peace accord, and this
 March Moscow Zor the first time authoritatively endorsed. the
 PRG's six-point program for a political settlement,, after virtually
 ignoring similar proposals for almost a year.
 Hanoi to,)k note of the President's departure for Moscow in a
 26 June report, and had reflected its attitude toward such summit
 diplomacy in an article in the June issue of the army journal,
 TAP CHI QUAN POI NHAN DAN, broadcast on 24 June.  The army journal
 assailed Nixon's "so-called policy of detente and the strategy
 of achieving a balance among the big powers, resorting to insidious
 and crafty political, diplomatic, and economic tricks in the hope
 of alienating our people from the forces of peace, national
 independence, democracy, and socialism in the world."
 The PRG sought international attention for its complaints against
 the United States in a 15 June memorandum, publicized on 18 June
 and sent to the Soviet Union, China, and other participants in
 the 1973 Paris International Conference on Vietnam.*  Hanoi did
 not follow the PRG's lead with a memorandum of its own, but its
 propaganda attacks on U.S. policies included a 24 June article by
 "Commentator" in the North Vietnamese party -paper NHAN DAN, which
 responded to an 18 June statement released by the U.S. Embassy
 in Saigon with a caustic attack on Ambassador Graham Martin.  And,
 in a repeat performance of the early May communist walkout from
 negotiating sessions with the GVN and the United States, the PRG
 and DRV on 22 and 23 June, respectively, issued foreign ministry
 statements an:Aouncing indefinite suspension of their participation

 in the two-party and four-party Joint Military Commission (JMC)
 talks--ostensibly because of Saigot.'e "refusal" to discuss "full
 implementation" of the privileges and immunities for the communist
 Joint Military Teams in the South.
 NHAN DAN ON           While Ambassador Martin has been the subject
 MARTIN, KISSINGER     of numerous Hanoi attacks in the pardt, the
 24 June Commentator article lent new authority
 to such criticism and raised the level of verbal abuse directed
 at the ambassador.  The article characterized him as heving his
 hands "stained with blood frem the crimes committed dail?,- in the
 southern part of our country" and ter-nsd his "slanders and dis-
 tortional' to be "indescribably ignominious."  According to
 Commentator, Martin bas been "poking his nose into every matter
 with increasing brazenness;" he "curses" those who have "exposed
 part of the truth" about U.S. "military involvement" in South
 Vietnam, and "aggressive but foolish, he labels" those opposed to
 such "involvement" as Hanoi's "agent and tool."  Continuing the
 diatrib,4 against the ambassador, the article scorufuily referred
 to hi,m as a "plenipotentiary governor-general from the United
 States who is leading the Saigon administration in continuing the
 war and sabotaging the Paris agreement on Vietnam."
 During the war, Commentator articles were a traditional vehicle
 for commenting on the views of high-ranking U.S. policymakers
 such as the President and Secretary of State, but since the peace
 agreement only three such articles had been published under the
 byline, the most recent. only two weeks before the current, fourth
 one.*  The latest Commentator article strives to present Ambassador
 Martin's views as an extension of those of Secretary Kissinger--thus,
 by implication, making the Secretary the unspoken target of the
 article's attack.  1?or example, Commentator rejected th,... notion of
 "U.S. press circles" that there seemed to be "some discordance"
 between Martin and the State Department and the opinion that Martin
 "or_ly repeated parrot-like and in a slightly gross and outmoded
 fashion Nixon's old policy."  Instead, Commentator argued that
 Kissinger's recent testimony before Congress on military and economic
 aid for the GVN was not a denial of Martin's statements but rather
 confirmed them.

 A mole direct attack on Secretary Kissinger appeared in the same
 irsue of NHAN DAN along with the Commentator article, but judging
 by the account broadcast by Hanoi radio, it was a less authoritative,
 unsigned commentary.  The article, entitled "Mr. Vissinger's
 Morality;" in effect blamed the Secretary for alleged actions
 creating the current situation in which "peace is in danger of
 slipping from oir gre.sp."  In this connection the erticle cited
 charges in the Wentarn press that Kissinger ht.d "prepared" the
 December 1972 bomb-410g of Hanoi, "urged Thlau to work out land-
 grabbing plans after Ni'on was elected," and provi'ed Thieu with
 weapons during the month before the peace agreement was signed

 time of sinking.  The statements also demanded the release of

 Characterizing the action "a very serious act of war and a brazen
 p~.ovocation," the DRV statement blandly warned that Saigon must
 bear "full responsibility for the consequences."  The PRG statement
 predictably devoted somewhat more space to the territorial. issue--
 taking exception to Saigon's "arrogance" in claiming sovereignty
 over the waters south of the 17th parallel and demanding "respect"
 for ?fU "territorial waters."  A Hanoi radio report of the 25th
 noted that the DRV utatement had bird forwarded to the foreign

 PRC.FORE I G11 RELATIONS
 PEKING SEES INDIAN.ITIONS IMPEDING IMPROVED RELATIONS
 Evidence of revived Peking interest in better relations with
 India, following the April implementation of UN resolutions on
 the Indo-Pakistani war, has been tempered by recent signals of
 Chinese opposition to Indian domiuance in South Asia.  While
 Peking has not directly commented on the 18 May Indian nuclear
 test, PRC medi& replays of Pakistani reaction to the test as an
 impediment to improved ties indicate that it is a major factor
 behind the new hesitance.
 On 22 Jung NCNA quoted Prime Minister Bhutto '.s observation that
 India's conducting the test near the Pakistani border showed
 that New Delhi was using its new power to "threaten" Pakistan.
 NCNA cited Bhutto's statement that the test had undermined India's
 international credibility and had "hampered" recent efforts to
 improve bilateral relations.  On 20 June NCNA quoted Defense
 Minister Aziz Ahmed's stronger statement that the blast "has
 caused a serious setback in the process of normalization" and
 that Pakistan would have to "take stock of the new situation
 that has arisen" before further diplomatic progress would be
 possible.  In view of the close coordination of PRC and Pakistan
 policy toward India in recent years, NCNA's citation of these
 remarks can be viewed as indicating serious Chinese reservations
 about improving t'ieir own relations with New Delhi at this time.
 Peking had first revived interest in better relations with India
 following consultRtions during Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto's
 11-14 May visit to China.  Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, in a
 speech on 12 May, went beyond usual formulas to note China's
 desire for better relations with countries of the subcontinent,
 a line repeated by China's representative at the 10 June Security
 Council session considering Bangladesh's admission to the United
 Nations.  Additionally, Peking media gave noticeably improved
 treatment to ,a visiting Indian friendship delegation earlier
 this month, in contrast to the restrained welcome a similar
 delegation received last year.*

 Peking at the same time has continued its traditional support
 for Pakistan and has given increased attention to evidence of
 opposition to Indian dominance elsewhere on the subcontinent.
 Teng Hsiao-ping on 12 May carefully balanced his initiative
 toward New Delhi with a reaffirmation of support for Pakistan's
 position on Kashmiri sslf-determination.  More recently, a
 23 June NCNA article sharply condemned India's alleged effort
 to manipulate the Sikkim assembly so as to "annex" the country,
 hailing popular demonstrations and decisions by the king to
 oppose New Delhi's moves.  Peking gave heavy play to China's
 decision to,send a representative ttj the coronation of the.
 Bhutan king on 2 June, lauding the king's statements in support
 of friendly ties with China and hailing his determination to
 preserve sovereignty and to promote self-reliance.  NCNA has
 also recently played up Nepal-India frictions over the presence
 in India of Nepalese dissidents who conduct raids across the
 border, and has even endeavored to encourage Bangladesh opposition
 to New De ;..i by highlighting Dacca's opposition to India's recent
 decision to curtail the flow of the Ganges into Bangladesh.
 PRC EDITORIAL AVOIDS ISSUE OF FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN TAIWAN
 Peking's low-key treatment of the Taiwan issue in this year's
 25 June PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial marking the 24th,anni.versary
 of the start of the Korean war and the U.S. "occupation" of
 Taiwaui has reflected a significant relaxation of China's revived
 concern--earlier this year--over persisting foreign involvement
 in Taiwan.  The editorial made no reference to foreign interference
 in routinely pledging to fulfill the Chinese "sacred duty" of
 liberating the island.  By contrast, last year's editorial had
 duly noted t'zht Pek. ng's goal "brooks no interference from any
 foreign courLc-,,-y" and cited determination to "eliminate foreign
 interference."
 Though Peking had gradually displayed less public concern over
 foreign influence in Taiwan following the signing of the Sino-U.S.
 and Sino-Japanese communiques in 1972, comment earlier this year
 had pointedly revived concern that "foreign diehards" were per-
 sisting with efforts to blo-k eventual PRC control of the island.
 Keynote speeches at a major Taiwan anniversary celebration in
 February had warned against foreign enemies who "are still vainly
 attempting to dip thei-; finger in the pie of Taiwan" and advised
 firmly that the Chinese PLA stands ready to rebuff their advances.*

 CORE A
 DERK WAR ANNIVERSARY RHETORIC MAINTAINS CURRENT HARD LINE
 Pyongyang utilized the 25 June anniversary of the outbreak of
 the Korean War to reiterate its harsh line toward the United
 States and its current hard line toward'South Korea, while
 continuing to emphasize its own proposals as the basis for
 negotiations and progress on the questions of North-South
 cooperation and eventual reunification.  The usual extensive
 coverage of the event included a NODONG SINMUN editorial, the
 customary yearly "appeal" to the South, and a mass rally of
 200,000 people addressed by Colonel General Yi Yong-mu.
 As in last year's speech given by KPA Chief of Generel Staff
 0 Chin-u, the negotiations between North and South, based on
 Kim 11-song's various proposals for reunification, were a
 central theme.  Unlike last year, however, when 0 Chin-u care-
 fully referred to the Pak government as the "South Korean
 authorities," t%is y6ar Y.i employed harsh characterizations of
 the South Korean leadership, in lLne with increasingly severe
 attacks on Pak:'.in the North's media.  Yi assailed the "Pak
 Chong-hui puppet clique" as not oi-t_y'U.S. and Japanese "stooges"
 but also "dirty traitors, diabolic: fascist hangmen, and bellicose
 elements . . . ."
 This year's "appeal" to the South did not go as far as urging the
 overthrow of the Fak government--a call laat made - ' 'n a 1971
 appeal--but it ca.,e close, saying that leaving the Pak government
 "intact" made reunification "impossible."  The appeal urged the
 South Korean people to "smash the brigandish 'revitalized'
 dictatorship."
 Yi's treatment of the United States was standard for the anniver-
 sary.  Accusing the United States of pursuing a "two Koreas"
 strategy in order to permanently divide Korea and "seize at least
 South Korea alone" as a military base and commodity market, Yi
 called the U.S. presence in South Korea the basic cause of
 tension on the peninsula and the primary obstacle to reunification.
 He charged that the United States "instigated" Pak to rupture the
 North-South dialog, and that the United States is actively backing
 o, reinvasion of Korea by Japanese militarists.  Yi also raised the
 North Korean peace proposal of March 1974, making the observation,
 common in any North Korean discussion of the proposal, that the
 United States has mane no "affirmative"' response.

 PEKING.. MOSCOW               Chinese treatment of the anniversary was
 highlighted as usual by a 24 June PEOPLE'S
 DAILY editorial.  In line with Peking's public approach to the
 Korean issue over the past year, the Chinese, as in the 1973
 editorial, muted cr:.ticism of the United States and completely
 omitted any reference to Japan, one of the North's prime
 targets.  The editorial noted the North's negotiating positions,
 including the proposal for a direct peace agreement with the
 United States.  While it called for U.S. troop withdrawal, it
 did not follow the. North in insisting that such withdrawal take
 place "immediately," though it did call for immediate cessation
 of U.S. military aid to the South.  Unlike last year, the
 editorial included a barb at the Soviet Union in the form of a
 comment on "power politics and hegemorlism."
 Like last year, Moscow's treatment thus fAr has been extremely
 low-key.  Moscow comment has melLtioned the presence of "foreign
 troops" in South Korea, and one broadcast briefly noted the
 presence of the "Pentagon's" forces, but Moscow has maintained its
 cautious stare r-ngarding anti-U.S. references.  The question of
 U.S. troop withdrawal was raised only indirectly--by a 25 June.
 broadcast -which reported a telegram sent to the DPRK-USSR
 friendship group from their Soviet counterparts.  The broadcast
 made a passing reference to the Soliet month of solidarity in
 support of the "struggle for ousting foreign troops from South
 Korea."  The telegram hailed the North's "cor.c ruct:ve proposals"
 for unification, and a radio commentary on the same day called the
 South's negative stand counter to the "current trend of detente."

 NOTES
 CSCE TIMING:  Recent remarks by leading Soviet commentators have
 finally, albeit indirectly, acknowledged that MOSCb ,has failed
 in its push to wind up the Conference on Security and Cooperation
 in Europe (CSCE) at a summit-level meeting this summer in Helsinki.
 Instead, the Soviet public stance is now being expressed in terms
 of holding the concluding summit "within" the current year.  With
 this acknowledgment, coming on the eve of President Nixon's
 arrival in the USSR, Moscow has made clear its desire for r. break-
 through aYrangement at the Nixon-Brezhnev talks which would, enable
 CSCE to be concluded with a possible autumn summit meetira.  A
 TASS dispatch in PRAVDA on the 18th and PRAVDA politic~f. observer
 Mayevskiy on the Moscow radio observers roundtable program on the
 23d both favorably cited a recent statement by FRG Chancellor
 Schmidt that it was possible to complete the conference "this year."
 Additionally, PRAVDA's senior political observer Yuriy Zhukov, in
 an interview with a correspondent of the Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN
 published in that paper on the 22d, declared that the USSR was
 "optimistic" regarding the outcome of the conference and "believes
 that the third stage--the summit talks--will be accomplished
 successfully within this year."  Soviet media, meanwhile, have
 sought to counter Western press speculation that the third stage
 of the conference should be delayed or indefinitely postponed,
 with comment generally citing Brezhnev as asking rhetorically, in
 his 14 June election speech, what "alternative" to a successful
 CSCE conclusion can be suggested by those advocativ- a delay.
 PRC LEADERSHIP:  Following lass week's unofficial poster attacks on
 Politburo member Hua Kuo-feng and on the Peking revolutionary
 committee headed by Politburo member Wu Te, Peking has clearly
 signaled that such attacks do not signify a fall from power by
 reporting public appearances on 24 June by both men.  Each leader
 was :making his first public appearance since 1 June. Hua
 received an Albanian friendship delegation, and Wu joined Yao
 Wen-yuan at a performance by an Albanian folk song and dance
 performance.  For the first time this year NCNA identified Wu in
 his post as head of the cultural group under the State Council.
