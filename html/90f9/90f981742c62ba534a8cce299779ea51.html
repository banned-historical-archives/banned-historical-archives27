 VIETNAM
 Communist military activity remained at a relatively
 low level throughout South Vietnam during the past
 week.   Meanwhile, in its first test of strength with
 the National Assembly, the Thieu government failed
 to get full approval of its partial mobilization
 decree.

 The Communists have launched their annual dry-season
 offensive, and there are tenuous signs that a more

 TENTATIVE STEPS TOWARD REBUILDING CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY
 Moderate leaders appear to be cautiously pushing meas-
 ures to restore the battered party apparatus, but the
 attempts are being opposed by Red Guards and their

 FAR EAST
 Communist military activity in South Vietnam
 remained at a relatively low level but there was
 further evidence of plans for a major Communist of-
 fensive in the heavily populated coastal area of
 central South Vietnam.  The National Liberation
 Front's seventh anniversary was the occasion for
 renewed assurances of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
 resolve to continue fighting until "final victory."
 Premier Chou En-lai publicly promised "more effective"
 Chinese support but confined himself to the standard
 description of China's role as a "dependable rear"
 for the Vietnamese people's struggle.
 Communist forces in Laos have launched their
 annual dry-season offensive, with some signs of a
 more sustained and wide-ranging campaign this year.
 Unconfirmed reports tell of North Vietnamese troops
 moving into northern Laos.   In reaction to an at-
 tack by Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese forces on
 a government base in southern Laos, Premier Souvanna
 Phouma again denounced the presence of the North
 Vietnamese as a flagrant violation of the Geneva
 accords.
 In China, there were further indications of
 the success of militant Maoists in frustrating ef-
 forts by the moderates to restore order and begin
 rebuilding the shattered party apparatus.  Measures
 announced last fall to reopen schools, which had
 been closed since June 1966, have largely broken
 down.   There seems to be little prospect that clashes
 between rival student factions can be ended as
 long as the conflict within the top leadership re-
 mains unresolved.
 Australian leaders have given public and private
 assurances that Prime Minister Holt's death will not
 affect the government's commitment in Vietnam.   With
 no clear "heir apparent," however, the present com-
 petition for the premiership will not be settled
 until a Liberal Party caucus chooses a new leader
 on 9 January.                                                  25XI

 VIETNAM
 Communist-initiated military
 activity remained at a relatively
 low level throughout South Viet-
 nam during the past week.   The
 few significant encounters in re-
 cent days resulted mainly from US
 and South Vietnamese sweep opera-
 tions,  some of which penetrated
 deep into sensitive Communist base
 areas and caused a considerable
 number of enemy casualties.
 Despite the low level of ac-
 tivity, there are new indications
 that the Communists are planning
 to intensify their military ef-
 forts in various sections of the
 country.   Extensive repositioning
 and maneuvering of enemy combat
 units point to a renewal of
 offensive activity in the near
 future.
 be focal points of impending at-
 tacks.
 Political Developments
 in South Vietnam
 In its first test of strength
 with the National Assembly,  the
 Thieu government failed to get
 approval of its partial mobili-
 zation decree.   On 18 December,
 Defense Minister Nguyen Van Vy
 went before each house of the
 assembly to defend the decree.
 Although Vy's presentation was
 well received, according to sev-
 eral senators,  the Upper House
 the following day resoundingly
 rebuffed the government,  largely
 on the basis of allegations that
 the decree is unconstitutional.
 The Lower House also may not
 approve Vy's defense of the mobil-
 ization decree.   Because of the
 generally progovernment Democratic
 Bloc, however, the government has
 more leverage in the Lower House
 and could stave off a rejection.
 Documents recently captured
 in Quang Nam Province outlined a
 plan in which one regiment of the
 North Vietnamese 2nd Division
 would conduct a diversionary at-
 tack near Que Son to draw allied
 reaction forces into the area from
 nearby strongpoints.   This regi-
 ment would then withdraw and join
 forces with the division's other
 two subordinate regiments to at-
 tack the remaining allied forces
 to the south.   Because of the
 heavy casualties suffered by the
 2nd Division in recent months,
 however,  there is some doubt this
 plan can be put into effect.

 On 19 December, the govern-
 ment brought to trial in a mili-
 tary court 26 persons involved in
 the 1966 Buddhist "struggle" move-

 a former area commander, Colonel
 Dam Quang Yeu.   Conviction and
 heavy sentences may bring about
 another confrontation between the
 government and the militant. Bud-
 dhists.   There are also indications
 that the Viet Cong are formulating
 plans to exploit the issue by at-
 tempting to stimulate mass protests.
 President Thieu has indicated
 that if the "strugglers" are con-
 victed, he may exercise clemency..
 Sentiment against the trial is
 running high in the National As-
 sembly, however, and both houses
 have formed committees to look
 into the matter of amnesty for po-
 litical prisoners.
 Bui Quang San,  a member of
 the Lower House from Quang Nam
 Province, was assassinated by two
 unknown persons on 117 December.
 Government spokesmen have claimed
 that the Viet Cong were responsible
 for San's death, but there is
 some possibility that he was killed
 as the result of his involvement
 in a political squabble within the
 Vietnamese Nationalist Party
 (VNQDD).
 NFLSV Anniversary Celebrated
 The Liberation Front's pre-
 tension of being the sole repre-
 sentative of the South Vietnamese
 people received strong endorse-
 ment from its Communist allies
 this week in propaganda accompany-
 ing the celebration of the Front"s
 seventh anniversary on 20 Decem-
 ber.   The North Vietnamese
 stressed their own and the Front"s
 resolve to struggle until "final
 victory," pointing to the success
 already achieved in the current
 winter-spring campaign as evi-
 dence that the Communists have
 the military initiative.
 In their propaganda on the
 anniversary, Moscow and Peking
 stressed the significance of the
 Front's new political program
 but, in doing so also pointed up
 their differing views on the con-
 flict.   Soviet statements took
 Moscow's usual line that the
 program will be particularly im-
 portant in solving the Vietnam-
 ese problem.   The Chinese, on
 the other hand, only rarely refer
 to the program and this time
 chose to emphasize that portion
 having a militant and uncompro-
 mising tone.      In its over-all
 treatment of the anniversary, Pe-
 king repeated. its strong but
 carefully worded offers of en-
 couragement and support to the
 Vietnamese as long as they con-

 COMMUNISTS STEP UP MILITARY ACTIVITY IN LAOS
 25X1
 25X1
 The Communists have launched
 their annual dry-season offensive
 in Laos, and there are tenuous
 signs that a more wide-ranging
 effort may be made this year.
 The most significant Com-
 munist activity has occurred near
 the northern edge of the Bolovens
 Plateau in southern Laos.   On
 11 December, two battalions of
 Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese
 troops overran a government base
 camp at Lao Ngam,  inflicting
 heavy casualties on the camp's
 defenders.   The following day,
 an important government guerrilla
 outpost a few miles to the north
 was captured by the enemy.   Al-
 though Lao Ngam was subsequently
 reoccupied,  the attack represents
 an important setback   to the
 government's long-range security
 and development programs in this
 rich, rice-growing area.
 The Communists are now
 threatening the provincial capi-
 tal of Saravane,
 Saravane
 is only lightly defended by gov-
 ernment troops, and its tactical
 importance is minimal, but its
 loss would be a severe psychologi-
 cal blow to the government.
 The recent enemy actions
 appear to be a resumption of
 the campaign launched in late
 July to counter the government's
 increased presence around the rim
 of the Bolovens.   The Communists
 are almost certainly aware that
 stepped-up intelligence and harass-
 ment operations are being mounted
 from some of these advanced bases,
 and their attacks are designed to
 thwart government encroachment
 into the infiltration corridor.
 The Communists also want to push
 government troops from the Bolovens,
 but it is unlikely they are willing
 to sustain the losses such an
 undertaking would entail.
 At any rate, the region's
 military commander will probably
 try to use the Communist threat
 to the plateau to persuade the
 general staff in Vientiane that
 the recent deployment of southern-
 based troops to northern Laos has
 left the south in a precarious
 military position.
 In the north, the Communists
 are continuing their campaign
 against government-supported
 guerrilla outposts south and west
 of Samneua.   They may be planning
 to isolate Phou Pha Thi, an impor-
 tant staging base for government
 guerrilla and air operations in
 the area.   Such bases have fre-
 quently changed hands during
 past offensives, and it is un-
 likely that the Communists can
 hold any of them for long in the
 face of air support for govern-
 ment troops.
 This season,  the Communists
 will probably also attempt to
 counter recent government gains

 TENTATIVE STEPS TOWARD REBUILDING CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY
 Moderate leaders in Peking
 appear to be cautiously pushing
 measures to restore the battered
 party apparatus, but the rising
 level of political tension through-
 nut China suggests that these at-
 tempts are being hotly opposed by
 Red Guards and their radical back-
 ers in Peking.
 Recent speeches by moderate
 party leaders have stated that a
 party congress will be held next
 summer to reconstitute the central
 committee.   If held,  this would be
 a major step toward stabilizing
 the political structure.   Broad-
 c-asts from Peking and several
 provincial radios have been stress-
 ing the need to rebuild and stream-
 line the party along lines sug-
 gested by Mao Tse-tung.                         Several
 broadcasts have urged militant
 "revolutionaries"  to minimize at-
 tacks on party cadres, presumably
 to facilitate the rebuilding proc-
 ess.
 This program, however, may
 be more an expression of the hopes
 of the moderate members of the re-
 gime than a blueprint for action.
 Peking faces enormous problems
 in re-establishing the party or-
 ganization, which has been all
 but dismantled during the Cultural
 Revolution.   In many provinces
 there is evidence that political
 factions are clashing over the
 question of who is to exercise
 authority.   Red Guard newspapers
 indicate that. militants are still
 suspicious of. former party offi-
 cials and will try to block any ef-
 fort to reinstate a majority in
 positions of authority. Despite the
 facade of unity displayed by leaders
 in   Peking since September,  it is
 likely that they are deeply split
 over the same! issue.
 Until the leaders in Peking
 can resolve their own disagree-
 ments,  it is unlikely that much
 progress will.. be made toward re-
 storing order and stability any-
 where.   Since. September, a variety
 of moderate programs have been
 pushed but all have run into
 trouble. For example,   the re-
 gime's efforts last fall to re-
 open schools--closed since June
 1966--have largely broken down.
 Outside of the schools, the
 civil disorders created by the
 Cultural Revolution remain at a
 high level almost everywhere and
 are growing worse in several prov-

 EUROPE
 A reorganization of the USSR's cultural and
 propaganda apparatus appears likely to erode
 further the second-level support of politburo mem-
 ber Alexander Shelepin.   It was rumored in Moscow
 that the positions of a number of high-level of-
 ficials may ultimately be affected.
 Meanwhile, the Soviet security and intelli-
 gence organization, the KGB, celebrated its 50th
 anniversary with a meeting in Moscow of top security
 officials from all of the Communist countries ex-
 cept China and Albania.   The anniversary articles
 and speeches have been heavily weighted on the domes-
 tic security side of the KGB's function.
 The Soviets and their East European allies fol-
 lowed up their recent series of bilateral meetings
 with a gathering of foreign ministers or their
 deputies in Warsaw this week.

 The East European regimes' differences on
 the scope and purposes of an. international Communist
 conference have become evident in the past week.   In
 clarifying their positions before the consultative
 meeting to be held in Budapest in February, Hungarian
 and Czechoslovak party papers have suggested that
 each party should have the right to decide for it-
 self whether conference decisions would be adopted
 as national policies.  The East Germans, on the other
 hand, contend that decisions taken at an international
 conference must be binding on all participants.

 USSR REVAMPS CULTURAL ADMINISTRATION
 A reorganization of govern-
 mental committees concerned with
 culture and propaganda is appar-
 ently under way in Moscow.   Rumors
 suggest that the positions of a
 number of high-level  officials
 may ultimately be affected, and
 associates of politburo member
 Shelepin appear to be the prime
 targets.
 The committee for cultural
 relations with foreign countries,
 headed by Romanovsky,  is being
 abolished and its functions dis-
 tributed among the ministries of
 culture, higher education, and
 foreign affairs.   Soviet officials
 claim that this reorganization is
 the cause of the current delay in
 the negotiations for an extension
 of the exchange program with the
 US and that a formal announcement
 on the committee's abolition is
 expected shortly.   At least three
 other committees--those for pub-
 lishing, radio-television,  and
 cinematography--may also be dis-
 solved.   According to one report,
 however, the radio-television com-
 mittee is to be split rather than
 abolished.
 According to Soviet officials,
 the proposed changes are intended
 to enhance efficiency and reduce
 costs.   An at least equally im-
 portant motive, however, appears
 to be the determination of the
 politburo majority to break up the
 group of second-level officials
 linked with Shelepin.   Romanovsky
 and. Mesyatsev, head of the radio-
 television committee, as well as
 Mikhailov, chief of the publishing
 committee, were all at one time
 closely associated with Shelepin
 in the Komsomol  (youth:  organiza-
 tion.
 There have also been hints
 that the shake-up in the cultural
 and. ideological field will reach
 the top ranks of the party.   One
 report cites unspecified Soviet
 sources to the effect that Demi-
 chev,  a former Khrushchev protege,
 may lose his post on the secretar-
 iat where he is responsible for
 party supervision of propaganda,
 education, and the arts.   Accord-
 ing to these sources, he will be
 named to head the expanded Min-
 istry of Culture--a significant
 step down.   Demichev is a candi-
 date member of the politburo and
 has been cited by Soviet sources
 as a Shelepin supporter.
 The removal of these support-
 ers of Shelepin, who has generally
 been though to favor a hard line
 on cultural matters, does not seem
 to mean any easing of policy in
 this area.   In fact, two groups of
 young intellectuals in Moscow and
 Leningrad reportedly have been or
 will soon be brought to trial.

 RUMANIAN-SOVIET DIFFERENCES REMAIN UNRESOLVED
 Little if any progress
 toward lessening Rumanian-Soviet
 frictions flowed from the offi-
 cial visit of Rumania's party
 boss and chief of state Nicolae
 Ceausescu, to Moscow on 14 and 15
 December.
 The Rumanians' refusal to
 commit themselves wholly to sup-
 port the Soviet positions on Viet-
 nam and West Germany was apparent
 from the communique.   It omitted
 mention of other issues on which
 Bucharest and Moscow differ, such
 as the Middle East situation and
 the Communist parties' consulta-
 tive meeting scheduled for next
 February in Budapest.
 In accepting the Soviet in-
 vitation to visit Moscow, Ceau-
 sescu presumably sought to gain
 acceptance for Rumania's position
 on the implementation of bilateral
 economic agreements, one of the
 major issues believed to be di-
 viding Bucharest and Moscow.
 The communique noted, however,
 that each side merely "exchanged
 opinions" on this matter, an in-
 dication that no agreement was
 reached.
 Bucharest and Moscow could
 only agree on one point:   to send
 a Soviet: party and government
 delegation on an official visit
 to Rumania in 1968.   Although the
 timing of the visit was not spec-
 ified, it may come about soon
 inasmuch as February is the dead-
 line for negotiating a new So-
 viet-Rumanian friendship treaty
 unless the present one is auto-
 matically renewed.   It is also
 the month of the Budapest con-
 sultative meeting, which the Ru-
 manians have not yet decided
 whether or not to attend.
 Ceausescu went to the USSR
 with the Rumanian party's full
 endorsement for his independent
 policies.  A few days earlier,
 he had had himself named chief
 of state.  Other elements in the
 pre-Moscow build-up of Ceausescu
 included important party and
 parliamentary sessions and a meet-
 ing with chiefs of Rumanian dip-
 lomatic missions.  At all of
 these gatherings, Ceausescu set
 forth the basic principles of
 Rumania's foreign policy, which
 he was later to act upon with the
 Russians.
 The party and parliamentary
 meetings approved internal reforms
 designed to improve the operation
 of the Rumanian economy and hence
 strengthen its independent posi-
 tion in the Communist world.   The
 regime also approved a realignment
 of territorial administrations,
 which it claims is designed to
 enhance efficiency.   It will, in
 addition, strengthen Ceausescu's
 25X1
 hold over middle and lower party
 and state echelons.

 TURKS HINDER SOVIET BLACK SEA FLEET
 Soviet naval ships have re-
 cently been testing Ankara's re-
 solve to enforce the regulations
 governing passage through the
 Turkish straits. Moscow--or any
 of the other signatories--can
 denounce the 1936 Montreux Con-
 vention governing the passage of
 warships through the Bosporus
 and Dardanelles if it believes
 Ankara is not properly carrying
 out its duties.   Turkey has been
 very careful in its administra-
 tion of the straits and has over-
 looked some recent Soviet in-
 fringements.
 Soviet naval operations in
 the Mediterranean are being
 hindered by stricter Turkish en-
 forcement of the provisions of
 the convention.   The prospect of
 having to force the straits in
 time of war in order to get the
 Black Sea Fleet into the Mediter-
 ranean has led Soviet planners
 to base most of their first-line
 units,  such as ballistic missile
 and nuclear submarines,  in the
 Northern Fleet,  from where they
 can move unimpeded to operating
 areas.
 The Soviet Navy has been
 able to deploy 20 to 30 warships
 to the Mediterranean during the
 past seven months by drawing sub-
 marines and a large number of war-
 ships from the Northern and Bal-
 tic fleets.   Black Sea - based
 auxillary vessels, however, pro-
 vide oil, provisions, and re-
 pairs to the Soviet Mediterranean
 squadron.
 The USSR and other maritime
 nations considered revising some
 of the more limiting provisions
 of the convention just after
 World War II.   Moscow sought
 joint Soviet-Turkish defense of
 the straits;  the Western powers
 wanted a guarantee that there
 would be no suspension of inno-
 cent passage for ships of any
 flag.   In the end, however, An-
 kara's NATO allies decided to
 maintain the status quo, which,
 while restricting their own na-
 val operations, also severely
 limits the passage of Soviet
 Black Sea Fleet warships through
 the straits.
 Three provisions in the
 Montreux Convention are most
 troublesome to the Soviet Navy.
 Article 12 sharply limits the
 transit of Soviet submarines.
 Units built or purchased outside
 the Black Sea may enter only
 "for the purpose of rejoining
 their base."   Black Sea - based
 submarines cannot exit unless
 they are going to a shipyard in
 another area for repairs.   Under
 Article 13, Ankara must be given
 at least eight days notice before
 a warship enters the straits.
 Finally, all submarines must
 transit during daylight,  and all
 other warships must start their
 transit before dark.
 The Soviets have adhered
 in principle to these restric-
 tions.   The few Black Sea -
 based submarines that have operated
 in the Mediterranean subsequently

 entered the Baltic--ostensibly
 for repairs--and then made a
 second short deployment in the
 Mediterranean before re-entering
 the Black Sea.
 Moscow recently tested An-
 ka.ra's resolve by attempting to
 send two submarines through the
 straits at night.   The Turks per-
 mitted the first unit to pass
 but threatened to halt the second
 at Istanbul.
 Prior to this time,  several So-
 viet warships that have made il-
 legal night transits were not
 challenged by the Turks.
 Moscow continues to whittle
 away at the restriction on prior
 notification.   On several occas-
 sions, Ankara has apparently re-
 ceived information through diplo-
 matic channels only a couple of
 days before the date of transit.
 Turkey could call the Soviets on
 this violation at any time, re-
 fusing transit to the Soviet
 ship until the stipulated eight-
 day period has elapsed, but it
 has not yet done so.   Moscow has
 used the ploy--at least during
 the Middle East crisis last sum-
 mer--of every week or so declar-
 ing its intention to send out a
 cruiser and two destroyers; the
 ships were not sent, but could
 have been if the USSR had needed
 to augment the Mediterranean
 s uadron on short notice.
 STRIFE-TORN CZECHOSLOVAK PARTY MEETS

 liberals and conservatives in the

 No reliable reports are

 of this meeting which was report-

 Brezhnev's sudden visit to Prague

 affecting even party boss Novotny.

 DENMARK FACES NEW ELECTIONS
 Prime Minister Krag's politi-
 cal future and the fortunes of his
 Social Democratic Party are at
 stake in special elections set for
 23 January.   The government was
 brought down last week when it
 lost a vote on a measure to freeze
 wages following Denmark's recent
 devaluation.
 The Social Democrats,  a mi-
 nority in Parliament, had depended
 on the support of the leftist So-
 cialist People's Party                         (SPP)  on
 domestic issues.   SPP chairman Ak-
 sel Larsen,  a staunch advocate of
 cooperation with the Social Demo-
 crats,  lost control of an extreme
 left-wing group in his party's
 parliamentary delegation and these
 negative votes were responsible for
 toppling the government.
 for votes in the center and the
 right.
 Public opinion polls taken
 before the government fell indicate
 that the non-Socialist parties
 stand a good chance to gain a ma-
 jority of the 179 seats in Parlia-
 ment.                                                                           They will have difficulty,
 however, in agreeing among them-
 selves on a government program.
 The new government will have
 to deal with Denmark's increasing
 economic difficulties in the wake
 of devaluation.   Inflationary pres-
 sures have intensified,  further
 threatening Denmark's competitive
 position in world markets.   At
 the same time,  export demand in
 Denmark's major markets is stag-
 nant, a problem over which Denmark
 has no control.
 After a special party congress
 on 16 and 17 December, the six SPP
 rebels broke away and formed a new
 party--the Leftist Socialist--which
 will compete in the forthcoming
 election if it can secure the
 16,000 signatures necessary to get
 on the ballot.   With the small Com-
 munist Party also in the race,  the
 vote on the left will be split
 among four parties, while five non-
 Socialist parties will be competing
 In view of the difficulties
 facing the country, there is
 likely to be considerable senti-
 ment among the Social Democrats
 in favor of going into opposition
 in order to allow the party a res-
 pite  from the responsibility of
 governing.   In this event, Krag
 might relinquish the party leader-  25X1
 ship to parliamentary spokesman
 Per Haekkerup, a leader of the So-
 cial Democratic right wing.

 FRANCE BLOCKS EUROPEAN COMMUNITY NEGOTIATIONS WITH BRITISH
 At this week's Council of
 Ministers meeting, French Foreign
 Minister Couve de Murville killed
 prospects for early Community
 negotiations with Britain on its
 bid for full membership.   In
 doing do, he outraged not only
 the Five, but European public
 opinion generally.   Whether or
 not such. sentiment will be trans-
 lated into effective pressure
 on Paris depends in large part
 on the outcome of domestic de-
 bates within each of the Five.
 Basically, they must choose be-
 tween going forward with Com-
 munity programs or sacrificing
 such progress for the sake of
 dramatizing the larger questions
 at stake for Europe's future in
 accepting the French veto.
 The seven-point communique
 issued after the Council session
 puts the Five on record as favor-
 ing immediate negotiations with
 Britain; the French held that
 enlargement "would deeply modify
 the nature and methods of opera-
 tion of the Communities" and that
 the UK's economic recovery "must
 be completed in order for the
 British application to be con-
 sidered."   The agreement to
 disagree, however, explicitly
 leaves the membership requests
 of the UK, Denmark, Ireland, and
 Norway on the Council's agenda--
 thus permitting Britain to con-
 tinue to press the Community as
 opportunities arise.
 As if to underline this
 point, Foreign Secretary Brown
 proposed in Parliament on 20
 December that Britain now "enter
 consultations with the five
 Community members who support the
 Commission's view that negotia-
 tions should be started at an
 early stage."  He said that the
 links between Britain and these
 countries should be forged "as
 strongly as possible."  London
 apparently intends to capitalize
 on the Five's resentment of
 what Brown termed Paris'  "false
 views of the future of our con-
 tinent of Europe."  London may
 try to undertake with each or
 several of the Five various
 "integrating" technological proj-
 ects.                                                            At the same time, how-
 ever, the British will have to
 guard themselves against allega-
 tions that such stop-gap proposals
 run counter to the spirit of the
 Community treaties.   Domestically,
 the British Government's problem
 is to prevent a sense.of frus-
 tration from undercutting its
 tactic of maintaining the of-
 fensive.
 Commission president Rey
 has deplored the present situa-
 tion, and during the Council
 session on 19 December he warned
 of the possibility of a stand-
 still in Community activity,
 with each member blocking pro-
 posals it did not like.   Following
 the Council meeting, the agri-
 cultural ministers of the
 Netherlands and Luxembourg--in
 reprisal for the French stand
 on the UK question--called for
 a suspension of an agricultural

 meeting that had been running con-
 currently.   Subsequently, Belgian
 and Dutch representatives announced
 they would attend a meeting of
 social affairs ministers only as
 "silent partners."
 The French are taking the
 line that the stagnation in com-
 munity affairs resulting from
 such tactics will only be tem-
 porary.  Nevertheless, it is the
 kind of situation that could
 still develop into a serious
 SECRET
 split.   Foreign Minister Luns has
 told the Dutch Parliament that
 the Five,  "individually and.
 jointly," would begin consulta-
 tions with Britain.   Whether this
 implies a specific commitment
 from others of the Five--in par-
 ticular, Bonn--is not yet known.
 In the present atmosphere, how--
 ever, Bonn might be subjected to
 considerable pressures from its
 partners to at least avoid ap-
 pearing too eager to smooth
 things over with De Gaulle.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Coups, countercoups, and rumors of impending
 coups dominated the area this week.
 King Constantine of Greece remains in Rome
 where he fled after the failure of his countercoup.
 His recent statement to the press leaves the quest-
 tion of his return to Athens up in the air, although
 the junta has left open the possibility of an even-

 Rumors of an officer-inspired coup in Sudan
 are cropping up.   It is too early at this stage to
 predict its success or even its eventuality.
 In Algeria,  forces loyal to Boumediene have

 Boumediene's success in crushing the revolt may en-

 other disgruntled elements.
 In Dahomey, the eight-man military regime that
 replaced President Soglo on 17 December is weak and
 unstable.   It faces continuing labor unrest and a
 serious financial crisis.
 Political instability still troubles several
 of India's states.   In West Bengal, the ousted united
 front coalition is winding up a week-long civil dis-
 obedience campaign that has failed to arouse mass
 support.   The non-Congress coalitions of Bihar and
 Uttar Pradesh moved ever closer to the brink of
 collapse.

 FUTURE OF GREEK MONARCHY IN DOUBT
 Continuing efforts to bring
 about, some agreement that would
 allow King Constantine to return
 to his throne had failed as of
 21 December.
 Ever since the King arrived
 in Rome late last week, following
 his abortive attempt to oust the
 military junta, emissaries have
 shuttled between the parties.
 The -junta, apparently mindful of
 the adverse foreign reaction and
 the need for an aura of legiti-
 macy,,  says the throne is still
 Constantine's if he wants to re-
 turn.,   Constantine's statement on
 20 December set forth only one
 cond:Ltion--a firm timetable for
 re-establishment of parliamentary
 democracy--and may be acceptable
 to junta moderates.   His reference
 to "deviations" by the junta fol-
 lowing the coup on 21 April, how-
 ever, will not sit well in Athens,
 especially with junta extremists
 who reportedly would be pleased
 if he stayed in exile..
 In Athens, the circumstances
 surrounding the failure of the
 King's coup attempt appear to
 have left the populace in a state
 of confusion and bewilderment.
 It is probable, however, that the
 people are fully aware of the
 extent of the junta's control
 and are resigned to a long period
 of rule by the colonels.
 The junta, meanwhile, has
 reaffirmed its intention to carry
 out its revolution,  to continue
 its alliance with the West, to
 move toward resumption of con-
 stitutional government, and to
 preserve the institution of the
 monarchy.   It has seized upon
 the King's withdrawal to extend
 its control of government opera-
 tions.   The regime has also re-
 moved or retired government of-
 ficials and military officers it
 believed were in sympathy with
 the King, and additional purges
 may continue after completion of
 the "investigation" of those in-
 volved with the King.  Apparently
 confident of their positions, coup
 leaders Papadopoulos, Pattakos,
 and Makarezos also have resigned
 their military commissions to
 become civilian ministers.
 Events in Greece have so far
 had no noticeable effect on the
 Cyprus situation.   The withdrawal
 of the Greek troops apparently is
 continuing, and there has been no
 reaction from Ankara that would in-
 dicate it expected any substantive
 change in its agreement with Athens
 over the removal of the troops.   The
 Turkish Air Force has nearly re-
 turned to its pre-crisis status,
 but there have been no indications
 of any significant standdown in
 the ground forces.  Debate in the
 UN Security Council over the
 proposed extension  of  the UN peace
 force mandate has been postponed
 twice since its originally sched-
 uled date of 15 December.   Some
 action will be necessary by 26 De-
 cember, however, when the current
 mandate expires.

 ALGERIAN COUP ATTEMPT FAILS
 Boumediene's swift crushing
 of an attempted revolt, followed
 by widespread pledges of support
 for his regime,  seem likely to
 prop him up for the time being,
 but prevailing dissatisfaction
 with his rule could spawn new
 coup attempts.
 On 14 December, Chief of
 Staff Tahar Z'Biri attempted to
 lead several armored units toward
 the capital from a base about
 150 miles southwest of Algiers.
 Police and gendarmerie reportedly
 bore the brunt of responsibility
 for stopping the advance, but
 armored cars, and possibly some
 tanks, were strafed by the Al-
 gerian Air Force, with a sub-
 stantial. number of military and
 civilian casualties.   Some para-
 troops may also have been engaged.
 Press reports that 4,000 dissi-
 dents were involved are not sub-
 stantiated.   Z'Biri and his sub-
 ordinate commanders--all rela-
 tives--are said to have withdrawn
 to the snow-bound mountains south
 of Algiers.
 Z'Biri, whose main follow-
 ing was believed to be centered
 in eastern Algeria, apparently
 counted on the support of Major
 Said Abid, commander of the First
 Military Region,  in whose juris-
 diction he launched his attempt
 and whose headquarters separated
 the armored column from its ob-
 jective.   Abid shared many of
 Z'Biri's parochial views and his
 loyalty to Boumediene was question-
 able, but he had reportedly been
 attempting to negotiate the dif-
 ferences between Boumediene and
 Z'Biri.   Abid, however, is credited
 by the.regime with tipping off
 Boumediene that Z'Biri had launched
 a revolt.   Abid's death at his
 headquarters on 15 December--of-
 ficially labeled a suicide by the
 regime--leaves his true role in
 doubt.
 Although Z'Biri had been dis-
 gruntled over his declining in-
 fluence, his revolt attempt prob-
 ably was sparked by Boumediene's
 action earlier this month in dis-
 missing the five-member secretar-
 iat controlling the country's only
 party, the National Liberation
 Front  (FLN)--at least two of the
 five were Z'Biri's cronies.   Bou-
 mediene chose Ahmed Kaid, the
 energetic minister of finance and
 one of his closest supporters, to
 revamp completely the stagnating
 FLN.
 When addressing party cadre
 oh 12 December, Boumediene had
 indicated that the thorough house-
 cleaning of the party was the es-
 sential base for an extensive
 reorganization throughout all gov-
 ernmental levels,  implying that
 this could also include the general
 staff.   This was a direct threat to
 the position of Z'Biri and those
 who shared his suspicion of the
 French-trained officers and the
 educated elite who have become
 prominent within the administration.
 rying out his 1965 coup.
 In abandoning the principle

 Z'Biri's chief complaint--and in
 moving ruthlessly to quash Z'Biri
 and his supporters, Boumediene is
 resorting to the tactics employed
 by Ben Bella, tactics that were

 NEW DAHOMEY MILITARY REGIME TO FACE EARLY TESTS
 Dahomey's new government,
 formed by young officers who
 ousted the two-year-old regime
 of General Soglo,  is :likely to be
 weak and unstable.   Its first
 tests will come soon, as con-
 tinuing labor problems and a des-
 perate financial crisis demand
 solution.
 Key army elements, ordered
 into Cotonou last week because a
 paralyzing strike was in progress,
 placed Soglo and other senior
 officers under house arrest on
 17 December,  just as the labor
 troubles appeared to be easing.
 A hastily created Revolutionary
 Military Committee, dominated by
 little-known junior officers,
 named a. new government and prom-
 ised. a new constitution and a
 return to civilian rule within
 six months.   Major Maurice Kouan-
 dete, a general staff officer who
 emerged as a central figure in
 the coup, has been named head of
 government and minister of de-
 fense,  foreign affairs, and in-
 formation.
 None of the eight young of-
 ficers in the new government has
 had previous political experience
 or a particularly distinguished
 military career.   The refusal of
 the widely respected. Emile Zinsou
 to continue as foreign minister
 handed the new regime its first
 setback and left the cabinet with
 only one, rather undistinguished,
 civilian member.   In addition, re-
 gional differences that lie be-
 25X1
 neath the surface seem bound to
 cause tension within the new gov-
 ernment.
 Among the serious problems
 facing the new regime is continu-
 ing labor dissatisfaction.  A
 threatened strike, evidently backed
 by leftist elements, has been at
 least temporarily averted by the
 institution of study commissions
 to examine ways to meet labor de-
 mands.   The government will be
 hard pressed to find alternate
 sources of revenue, however, if
 the workers'  demand for the re-
 scinding of the 25-percent tax. on
 wages is met.
 The regime already faces an
 early financial crisis.   The treas-
 ury is depleted, and unless France
 remits funds promised to Soglo
 during his state visit to Paris
 last month, the government will
 soon be in dire financial straits.
 France was clearly displeased by
 the ouster of Soglo at this time
 and is withholding recognition of
 the new regime.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Political and economic activity has slowed to
 a virtual halt in most Latin American capitals as
 the holiday season approaches.
 The council of the OAS, in a closed meeting in
 mid-December, decided to wait until 12 February to
 hold the fifth ballot in the deadlocked election
 for a new secretary general.  A preliminary meeting
 is scheduled for the end of January, when the coun-
 cil presumably will attempt to determine whether any
 of the three contenders can muster a 12-vote major-
 ity.   If not, it will consider alternative solutions
 to break the protracted impasse.   The election maneu-
 vering, plus four recent incidents of questionable
 conduct on the part of staff members, has lowered
 the prestige of the OAS.
 Political waters in the Dominican Republic and
 Haiti continued to be roiled last week.  The chief of
 the Dominican armed forces is once again threatening
 to resign because of the efforts of inveterate in-
 triguer Colonel Neit Nivar Seijas to extend his per-
 sonal influence.   In Santo Domingo, an attempted
 march on the presidental palace by disgruntled city
 employees was broken up by police, but not before
 sporadic shooting broke out.   In neighboring Haiti,
 the attempted assassination of a high-level regime
 official on 7 December is expected to provoke harsh
 retaliation against those whom President Duvalier
 considers responsible--or has chosen as scapegoats.
 In Panama City on 16 December, Arnulfo Arias
 accepted the nomination of the opposition National
 Union (NU)  coalition as its presidential candidate
 next May.   In his acceptance speech, the twice-de-
 posed former president made it clear that, if
 elected, he will try to put his personal stamp on
 a canal settlement.
 The Salvadoran-Honduran border dispute moved
 to center stage on the diplomatic front this week.
 A prisoner exchange before the Christmas holiday
 would mark the first substantial progress toward
 solution of this long-standing border dispute.

 CHILEAN SENATORIAL BY-ELECTION STILL UNDECIDED
 A recount will be necessary
 to determine the result of the
 senatorial by-election held on
 17 December in a south-central
 agricultural district of Chile.
 The closeness of the election,
 however, indicates a protest vote
 against the Frei government in a
 district: that suffers from high
 unemployment and low agricultural
 prices.
 The preliminary count showed
 Christian Democratic  (PDC)  candi-
 date Jorge Lavandero a winner by
 11 votes.  A later count, how-
 ever, gave the Communist-supported
 Alberto Baltra 58,225 votes to
 Lavandero's 58.,205; Huerta, the
 candidate of the conservative
 National Party  (PN), received
 36,102.   The votes will be re-
 counted, and the electoral tri-
 bunal will determine whether more
 than 2,000 votes should have been
 declared invalid.   Final certi-
 fied results may not be available
 until February.
 The PN made a surprisingly
 strong showing, increasing its
 total by nearly 40 percent over
 the municipal elections last
 April.   The PN's success brings
 into question the assumption by
 many politicians that the Chilean
 electorate is moving inexorably
 to the left.   Small businessmen
 and independent farmers, disen-
 chanted with the government but
 leary of the leftist Baltra, ap-
 pear to have voted heavily in
 favor of the PN.
 Baltra is a member of the
 Radical Party, which last summer
 came under the control of a left-
 ist group committed to coopera-
 tion with the Communists and
 Socialists.   The Communists played
 a very important role in Baltra's
 campaign, and his strong showing
 will encourage closer cooperation
 between the two parties.   The
 Socialists, much less enthusias-
 tic about the Radicals, appar-
 ently were successful in getting
 their members to abstain.
 The PDC ran an unenthusi-
 astic and disorganized campaign.
 The leftist leadership of the
 party may, in fact, have hoped
 for a large Baltra victory to
 strengthen their position in
 pushing President Frei to in-
 crease state intervention in
 the economy.   Frei himself, pre-
 occupied with his legislative
 program, may have thought that
 a mid-term by-election simply
 25X1
 did not warrant extensive in-
 volvement on his part.

 NEW REGIME IN URUGUAY
 Newly installed President
 Jorge Pacheco Areco is exercis-
 ing firm and active leadership.
 He has already announced his
 intention to continue his
 predecessor's austere economic
 policies, and he has moved
 forcefully to curtail the
 disruptive activities of the
 extreme left.
 His way is being made less
 difficult by the active support
 of Jorge Batlle, the leader of
 the largest faction of the
 divided, ruling Colorado Party.
 Batlle and Pacheco generally
 share the same political out-
 look.   Batlle is a firm advo-
 cate of economic reform and
 has been closely coordinating
 his ideas with the International
 Monetary Fund  (IMF)  representa-
 tives who are in Uruguay to
 negotiate a standby agreement.
 He can be expected to support
 Pacheco as the President strug-
 gles to implement the kind of
 belt-tightening measures the
 IMF will require.
 Batlle's support, although
 dictated in part by conviction,
 may also be designed to further
 his own presidential ambitions.
 Pacheco cannot legally succeed
 himself, but an endorsement
 from him in 1971 might improve
 Batlle's prospects.
 Even with Batlle's support,
 the Colorado Party's legisla-
 tive majority is slim.   If other
 restive factions defect, Pacheco
 will have to look for votes among
 members of the opposition Blanco
 Party.   Uruguayan legislators
 have frequently crossed party
 lines in past votes, however, and
 this pattern is likely
 con-
 tinue.

 ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SPARKS RUMORS IN HAITI
 Relative political calm pre-
 vails in Haiti despite the at-
 tempted assassination of a high-
 level government official.
 Elois Maitre, second in
 command of President: Duvalier's
 notorious Ton Ton Macoutes, was
 tommygunned by unknown assail-
 ants on the evening on 7 Decem-
 ber while awaiting an incoming
 flight at the airport.   Follow-
 ing the attack,  speculation has
 been rife in Port-au-Prince,
 with most Haitians viewing the
 shooting as a result of a con-
 flict between elements within
 the Duvalier regime and perhaps
 indicative of a potential anti-
 government plot,.
 The shooting, which also
 could have resulted from a
 grudge by some of maitre's many
 enemies,  is the first in several
 years involving a trusted Duval-
 ier associate and is the first
 public incident of consequence
 since late September when peas-
 ants in northern Haiti took part
 in antigovernment demonstrations.
 In view of Maitre's prom-
 inence, Duvalier is expected
 to move soon against those whom
 he considers responsible--or
 has chosen as scapegoats.   His
 uncharacteristic silence since
 the attack has led some Haitians
 to believe the report that
 "palace insiders" may have been
 involved.
 Rumor-conscious Haitians
 are always quick to construe
 any incident as signaling_the
 imminent demise of the Duvalier
 regime.   Available information
 suggests, however, that Duvalier
 is as firmly in co:ztrol as ever.
