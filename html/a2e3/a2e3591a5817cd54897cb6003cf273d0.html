ADMINISTRATIVE IN NtUSE ONLY 
1.0 Purpose 
1.1 The purpose of this study is to determine the 
feasibility and practicality of the Office of Logistics 
Printing and Photography Division (OL/P&PD) assuming 
the responsibility for printing the Foreign Broadcast 
Information Service, Joint Publications Research 
Service (FBIS/JPRS) publications. 
1.2 The motivation for the study at this time was the 
extensive technological changes which have taken place 
in both FBIS and P&PD since the previous study of this 
subject as well as the changes still to come as both 
organizations achieve comprehensive technical 
improvements. These changes hold the promise of 
significant production efficiencies and product quality 
enhancements. 
2.0 Statement of the Problem 
2.1 Current Agency planning calls for JPRS to move to the 
new Headquarters Building in the 1986-1987 timeframe 
and with that relocation it is anticipated that P&PD 
could provide the necessary printing support for JPRS 
publications. That fact, along with the impact of FBIS 
modernization program on JPRS publications and the 
overall printing capabilities and efficiencies provided 
by P&PD, led to the undertaking of this study. 
3.0 Facts Bearing on the Problem 
3.1 JPRS currently has personnel, equipment, floor space 
and a budget to support their printing operations. 
3.2 JPRS has ad hoc printing requirements such as 
specialized reports, reprints, reference aids, 
newsletters, glossaries, handbooks and supplements, and 
biographic cards for the Office of Central Reference, 
DDI, which must be met. 
3.3 Both FBIS and P&PD are embarked on modernization 
programs which will result in improved efficiencies and 
capabilities in the operations of both organizations. 
Close coordination and interface between the two 
components is essential so that the two modernization 
efforts yield maximum benefit to the Agency. 
3.4 P&PD currently prints the FBIS Daily Report and the 
FBIS weekly Trends in Communist Media report. The JPRS 
reports are the only FBIS published product which is 
not printed by P&PD.

3.5 In order for the JPRS printing operations to remain in 
their current location, renovations will be necessary 
to meet safety requirements. 
3.6 The JPRS printing requirement consists of a large daily 
volume of work which must be completed in a timely 
manner with the highest possible quality. 
3.7 JPRS has a requirement for storing copies of their 
publications and servicing requests for the same. 
4.0 Assumptions 
4.1 P&PD has the equipment capacity/capability (with some 
limited augmentation) to assume the responsibility for 
printing support to JPRS publications. 
4.2 P&PD's assumption of JPRS printing responsibilities 
will result in production efficiencies and/or product 
quality gains. 
4.3 P&PD will support future JPRS initiatives in automation 
and/or quality enhancements of their publications. 
4.4 If P&PD was to support the JPRS printing requirement, 
JPRS printing personnel, equipment, and FY 1984 and FY 
1985 budget would be transferred to P&PD. 
5.0 Background 
5.1 The JPRS printing operation which is located at 1000 
Glebe Road, Arlington, Va., has been in existence for 
the past twenty-five years. The facility operates one 
shift five-days-a-week, employs 14 people, occupies 
3735 square feet of floor space, and had an FY-82 
operating .budget of $558,000. The printing 
requirements consists of support to 55 publications for 
an average FY 1982 volume of 13.4 reports per day,. 
containing an average of 1,244 original pages, 11.7 
photographs from which there were a daily average of 
202,329 pages/impressions printed. Attachment A 
contains an outline of a JPRS printing profile. 
5.2 P&PD on the other hand has been providing centralized 
printing support to the Agency for the past twenty-
seven years. Prior to 1956, P&PD was part of the 
Government Printing Office which provided support to 
the Agency. P&PD has its own separate building located 
on the Agency's Headquarters compound. P&PD's Main 
Printing Plan (MPP) operates three shifts, 365 days a 
year, employs 234 people, occupies 60,223 square feet 
of floor space, and had an FY 1982 operating budget of 
13.1 million dollars. P&PD printing operation supports 
all Agency components and provides ad hoc support to

the Intelligence Community and other government 
agencies. In FY-82, P&PD printing requirements 
consisted of a daily average of 37 jobs for multiple 
publications. Using an average of eight pages per 
impression, P&PD printed 1,648,408 pages per day in 
FY-82. Additionally, the Division provides 
photographic support consisting of microfilming, black 
and white and color photography, and motion picture and 
television support. It also provides publications 
design and presentation graphics support as well as 
centralized Agency Headquarters Copier support. 
Overall, the Division supports over 3300 jobs per month 
for various component requirements. 
5.3 The feasibility of P&PD assuming responsibility for 
JPRS printing support has been addressed previously, 
most recently in 1975. In those previous studies, the 
recommendations were always the same; the operations 
should remain separate and no changes should be made. 
The rationale for these decisions was the fact that 
there were little or no benefits to be derived by 
P&PD's assumption of the JPRS printing responsi-
bilities. There was little that P&PD, at that time, 
could do in any automation of the printing of the JPRS 
product. An assumption by P&PD of the JPRS printing 
responsibility would have meant just simply relocating 
the operation from JPRS to P&PD. The JPRS operation 
being primarily a duplicating function was of little or 
no interest to P&PD because the Division was interested 
in higher quality offset printing operations. During 
the past eight years, P&PD has automated many of their 
printing operations and plan for further automation. 
This automation effort leads to the feasibility of 
deriving some efficiency and quality improvements in 
the overall printing support of the JPRS publications. 
Additionally, management and management philosphy has 
changed; that is, the Division now wants to support as 
many Agency printing applications as possible 
regardless of whether the application is duplicating, 
copying, or offset printing. These factors, along with 
the relocation of JPRS and the FBIS/JPRS automation 
initiatives, make this an appropriate time to 
reevaluate the feasibility of P&PD assuming the JPRS 
printing responsibilities. 
6.0 Discussion 
6.1 JPRS Printing Production Requirements 
6.1.1 Attachment B contains an overview of JPRS printing 
production requirements along with a statistical 
history of those requirements. JPRS currently 
prints 55 publications which range in copy 
requirements from under 100 to over 300 copies. As

previously stated, they print an average of 13.4 
reports per day containing an average total of 
1.244 pages and 11.7 photographs printed daily. 
The number of original pages generated by JPRS has 
increased 47.36 percent between 1975 and 1982 while 
the number of pages printed between those same 
years has increased by 105.21 percent. The amount 
of photographs in the JPRS product has fluctuated 
over the past eight years. The number of 
photographs increased from 1975 to 1979, decreased 
in 1980 and 1981, with a slight increase in 1982 
and a projected decrease in 1983. Less'than five 
percent of the JPRS publications contain - 
.,photographs. Attachment C outlines the JPRS 
photographic requirements and shows some recent 
examples of photographs used in JPRS publications. 
6.1.2 There are few, if any, peaks and valleys in the 
JPRS printing production requirements. The 
daily/monthly volume is fairly consistant with an 
overall upward volume trend. The throughput 
requirements for JPRS publications are not 
flexible. The material is dated before it is 
received by the Printshop and must be printed in 
chronological order. In conversations between P&PD 
and JPRS personnel, it was agreed that a realistic 
throughput time for JPRS publications was 48 hours 
from the time they are received by the print shop. 
6.2 JPRS Printing Production Process 
6.2.1 JPRS currently has approximately 1000 contractors 
who contribute translation/writing to their 55 
publications. These contractors complete their 
work on typewriters and/or word processors and 
submit it to JPRS for publication. These 
articles/books then go through an editing process 
where they are corrected/formated and put together 
in a camera ready copy format (typewritten pages 
with photos attached) ready for printing. ,A cover 
master is created, a work sheet/requisition 
(Attachment D) is attached, and the job is sent to 
the print shop. 
6.2.2 When the JPRS print shop receives the job, it is 
printed (with the exception of priorities) on a 
first in first out basis. The first step in 
processing the job through the print shop is the 
creation of a master (paper plate) for the printing 
press (duplicators). The job is then run on the 
press. Once the press run is complete, the job is 
collated off line and then stapled together. If 
the job contains photographs, they are sized, 
screened, merged with the text, and run through the

listing of the currently used JPRS printing 
equipment. 
6.3.3 The JPRS FY-1983 projected printing budget is 
$363,500. The principle items contained in the 
budget are $264,400 for supplies, $27,500 for 
maintenance, and $45,000 for equipment replacement. 
Attachment G contains specific budget line items. 
6.3.4 The JPRS Printshop occupies 3735 square feet of 
,Agency rented floor space at 1000 Glebe Road, 
Arlington, VA. The annual rental cost of this 
floor space is $37,987.00. If the operation is 
expected to remain at this site, $62,500.00 worth 
of renovations will be necessary to meet GSA safety 
recommendations, local code requirements, and 
minimum comfort standards for ventilating and air 
conditioning. A detailed estimate for the required 
renovations is contained in Attachment H. 
6.3.5 In addition to the printing functions, the JPRS 
printshop maintains/stores back issue copies of 
their publications. This function occupies 250/300 
square feet of floor space. The JPRS printshop 
personnel services government-wide requests for 
these publications. 
6.4 P&PD Printing Operations 
6.4.1 P&PD provides centralized printing and photographic 
support for the Agency servicing all directorates 
and components. Its Main Printing Plant operates 
three shifts a day, seven days a week and 365 days 
a year. Attachment I contains a current P&PD 
printing plant profile. 
6.4.2 Over the past several years, P&PD has automated and 
modernized its printing plant and equipment in :an 
effort to provide the Agency with the highest 
quality product with a rapid job turnaround time in 
the most cost-effective manner. P&PD currently 
uses its Electronic Text Editing and Composition 
System (ETECS) for text editing, composition, and 
some limited page makeup. It currently has in-
house a black and white photographic scanner for 
digitizing, screening, sizing, and manipulating 
half tone photographics and graphics. There is a 
color scanner currently on order and scheduled for 
delivery in August. P&PD is also utilizing a laser 
platemaker to create plates direct from hard copy 
camera ready documents. This device eliminates the 
offset photography/camera layout function entirely. 
P&PD currently has a Request for Proposal (RFP) out 
to various vendors for the acquisition of an

duplicator a second time. All JPRS production is 
in a cut sheet (8 1/2 x 11 inch page) format. Once 
the job is completed, it is then boxed, bundled, 
and/or enveloped per predetermined distribution 
list. It is then mailed via the Agency courier 
system. Some 35 percent of the JPRS publications 
carry a For Official Use Only control. The 
remainder are uncontrolled. 
6.3 JPRS Printshop Support (Personnel, Equipment, Budget, 
and Floorspace) 
6.3.1 The fourteen positions needed to support the JPRS 
printing requirements include one Reproduction 
Manager/Chief, one Foreman, one Offset 
Photographer, six Offset Press Duplicator 
Operators, four Bindery Operators, and one 
Platemaker Equipment Operator. As previously 
stated, the JPRS printshop operates one shift five 
days a week. If there is a work backlog or a large 
priority job that needs to be printed, overtime is 
used,po remedy the situation. In the first four 
months of 1983, the JPRS Printshop used an average 
of 4 hours per day or 84 hours per month in 
overtime. Nine of the thirteen employees working 
for the JPRS are Agency staff employees. Four are 
contract employees not Agency cleared. There is a 
vacant Offset Duplicator Press Operator position. 
Attachment E outlines the personnel resources, and 
contains an organization chart of the JPRS 
Printshop and a listing of the current personnel 
assigned. Also attached is a chart showing 
overtime usage over the past four years. 
6.3.2 JPRS printing equipment consists of four tandem 
(two sided) two single duplicators, one Xerox 9200, 
two Bruning Platemakers, three collators, four 
stitchers, a paper cutter, a vaccumn frame and a 
light table. The majority of the printing is done 
on the tandem duplicators, which print both sides 
of the paper at one time. The Xerox 9200 is used 
to print 5x8 biographic cards for the Office of 
Central Reference, DDI. These cards contain 
biographic information that has been prepared by 
JPRS. The 9200 is also used to print JPRS 
administrative documents and extra copies of 
previously printed JPRS reports. This copier is 
presently funded by the P&PD Copier Management 
Program. The condition of the ,various pieces of 
equipment varies from excellent to fair. Equipment 
maintenance is performed by an outside contractor. 
Annual equipment maintenance costs are 
approximately $27,500. Attachment F contains a

automated page makeup system. This system will 
allow the Division to merge text from the ETEC 
system, graphics from the black and white or color 
scanner, and create fully made up pages and output 
them initially to a typesetter and in the future to 
a laser platemaker. This system will become part 
of an Agency-wide automated publishing network (see 
Attachment J). 
6.4.3 In addition to the automation in the prepress area, 
P&PD has acquired new printing and binding 
equipment over the past few years. P&PD's printing 
operation primarily uses the offset lithographic 
printing process. Both sheet-feed and web (roll) 
presses are used to satisfy P&PD production 
requirements. On these presses, jobs are printed 
in multiples of eight, sixteen, thirty-two, or 
forty-eight pages. After printing, these multiple 
page signatures are folded or cut into 8 1/2 x 11 
inch pages and then collated or bound into 
books/documents. Additionally, P&PD has the 
capability to produce large size (up to 50 inch) 
maps and graphics. These productions can be 
produced in either black and white or color. The 
P&PD bindery operation has the capability to staple 
(side or saddle stitch), perfect bind (glue), or 
spiral bind documents. The Bindery Branch also has 
a computerized system which is used for maintaining 
and updating disemination lists and labeling 
envelopes. 
6.4.4 P&PD also has offset duplicating equipment and high 
speed copiers that are used to provide quick 
turnaround service on low volume jobs. 
Additionally, P&PD provides a photographic support 
service for micrographics, black and white and 
color photo finishing, motion picture and 
television (videotaping) production, and design and 
presentation (briefing aids) support. P&PD has its 
own inhouse maintenance staff which provides the 
majority of maintenance support for most of the 
production equipment. 
6.4.5 Overall, when compared to capacity, P&PD equipment 
utilization is low (25-35%). this equipment 
capacity is necessary in order to meet time 
critical requirements for current intelligence 
projects. While the Division has equipment 
capacity, it is limited in personnel resources with 
the current workload and around-the-clock coverage 
requirement there is little, if any, excess 
personnel resource capacity in P&PD.

411 6.5 P&PD/JPRS Printing Operations Comparison 
? 
6.5.1 When comparing P&PD and JPRS printing operations, 
the first thing that comes to mind is the 
capabilities and capacities of the two operations. 
P&PD is structured to support medium to high volume 
printing requirements with high quality output. 
P&PD is also structured to meet several different 
types of requirements from various components in 
the Agency. JPRS on the other hand is structured 
to meet only a low to medium volume requirement for 
its own orginization. JPRS cannot handle any color 
requirments. During the current fiscal year, JPRS 
has had to use considerable overtime due to 
increased requirements and understaffing. JPRS is 
a cut*sheet operation using single 8 1/2 x 11,inch 
sheets of paper to print to whereas P&PD uses 
either large sheets or roll paper to print multiple 
pages at one time. JPRS uses paper plates/master 
to produce its product whereas P&PD uses metal 
plates. The paper plates are less expensive, the 
metal plates produce a higher quality product. 
JPRS is a one shift five-day-week operation with 
limited equipment/personnel resources whereas P&PD 
has a large amount of equipment capacity with 
personnel that can be used to respond to priority 
requirements. JPRS is operating at almost full 
capacity and has limited expansion capability. Its 
current floor space does not allow for anything but 
minimum expansion and hinders the 
acquisition/implementation of automated equipment. 
6.5.2 Attachment K outlines a P&PD/JPRS material cost and 
work hour analysis of producing the JPRS 
publications. The analysis is based on JPRS FY 
1982 production statistics. The analysis is also 
based on producing all the JPRS jobs in P&PD via 
the laser platemaker and the web press. The 
analysis shows that if all jobs are produced in 
this manner there would be an additional daily 
printing cost of $77.98 ($19,572.98 annually). All 
the jobs however, would not be' printed in this 
manner. The job profiles contained in Attachment 1 
indicate that 32 (58 percent) of the 55 JPRS 
publications lend themselves to the laser 
platemaker web press operation. The other 23 
publications (42 percent) would best be suited for 
production on the sheetfed presses offset 
duplicators or high speed copiers. Overall, as 
P&PD gains experience with planning and producing 
the JPRS on the proper equipment, there will be a 
cost savings instead of an increase in daily cost.

6.5.3 Printing costs alone aren't the only factors in 
considering a possible P&PD takeover. There are 
also floor space, equipment and maintenance costs 
that must be given consideration. When taking into 
consideration the annual increased $19,572 printing 
costs and subtracting from that the annual $37,987 
JPRS floor space rental and $27,500 annual 
maintenance there is a minmum overall Agency annual 
cost savings/avoidance of $45,915 if P&PD were to 
assume the JPRS printing responsibilities. There 
are also intangible cost savings that would be 
associated with a P&PD takeover of this function. 
These intangible savings are associated with less 
administrative (overhead) costs to manage a 
consolidated function versus a decentralized one. 
There would also be less vendor supply and 
maintenance contracts that would have to be managed 
and combining supply purchases would, in all 
probability, reduce overall cost. Additionally, 
the $37,987 floor space rental is an annual cost 
avoidance because, in all probability, the space 
vacated by the Printshop will be used for new JPRS 
requirements. 
6.5.4 In addition to cost, another criteria that should be 
considered in deciding whether or not a P&PD 
takeover is feasible and/or practical is the 
overall quality of JPRS publications. The P&PD 
facility offers an opportunity for an overall 
improvement in quality with little or no additional 
costs. Also, the FBIS/JPRS modernization plan 
calls for automating the textual input of the JPRS 
publications. If in fact the textual data is 
automated/digitized, it would allow the data to be 
typeset which would reduce the overall original 
page volume by 30 percent (typesetting allows for 
word/data compaction) and greatly improves quality. 
With the original page volume reduced, 30 percent 
of the printed page volume 'would be reduced a like 
amount. The digital data would also provide the 
capability to alter the publication format which 
could be used to improve the overall appearance of 
the product. Attachment L contains some samples of 
typeset JPRS material compared to the currently 
produced product. 
6.5.5 With automation, JPRS could be linked to Agency 
automated publishing network and P&PD's Digital 
Prepress System. These actions will improve the 
,overall quality of the product, reduce job 
throughput time, and reduce the overall cost of the 
publication.

6.6 P&PD Printing Production Career Path 
6.6.1 JPRS printing production employees are currently 
limited in career/pay advancement possibilities. 
Currently, the highest paid non supervisor employee 
in the JPRS printshop is paid at $12.47 per hour. 
The highest paid non supervisor employee in P&PD is 
paid at $17.53 per hour. Additionally, there are 
trade uprates and work leader P&PD positions that 
pay in excess of $18.00 per hour. These pay rates 
do not include a second or third shift night 
differential that may be acquired by some of the 
personnel. In addition to pay, the employees can 
be trained in more than one printing trade, which 
will provide an opportunity for advancement, job 
satisfaction, and/or job enrichment. See 
Attachment M for the current P&PD printing position 
pay schedule. 
6.7 P&PD JPRS Support 
6.7.1 If P&PD were to assume responsibility for JPRS 
printing support, there are many procedural 
questions that would have to be answered by an 
implementation task team made up of JPRS and P&PD 
personnel. There are however, certain issues that 
have been raised by JPRS personnel that can be 
addressed at this time. These issues are as 
follows: 
6.7.1.a Placement of JPRS Printshop Personnel  
In order to support JPRS requirements, 13 
positions listed in Attachment E must be 
transferred to the OL. The majority of the 
personnel would be assigned to P&PD's Press or 
Bindery Branch and placed in the Division 
apprenticeship program at a percentage rate 
comparable to their existing salary. From there 
they would receive training and would progress 
through the apprenticeship program and reach 
Journeyman status. Contract personnel not 
cleared would have to receive an Agency clearance 
from the Office of Security prior to coming to 
P&PD. Initially, the personnel would be used 
primarily to support JPRS requirements. They 
would however, be trained to provide overall 
support to P&PD requirements. 
6.7.1.b JPRS Printing Equipment 
All JPRS printing equipment as listed in 
Attachment F would be transferred to P&PD. In 
the case of the Xerox 9200 (which is funded by

ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL USE ONLY 
P&PD), a medium volume copier would be provided 
as a replacement to meet JPRS administrative 
printing requirements. If P&PD assumes the JPRS 
printing responsibility, JPRS would have no in-
house printing capability. 
6.7.1.c JPRS Budget  
If P&PD were to assume responsibility for JPRS 
printing requirements, it will be necessary to 
transfer all FY 1984 and FY 1985 operational 
funds to P&PD that are allocated to JPRS for 
printing support. These funds will be necessary 
for supplies and/or any additional equipment that, 
will be necessary to meet the requirement. P&PD 
will assume budget responsibility in FY-86. 
6.7.1.d The Printing of JPRS Copyright and FOU0 Material,  
Including Photos  
P&PD currently prints similar material for FBIS 
and prints all classifications of material for 
the Agency. P&PD would support this requirement 
for JPRS. 
6.7.1.e The Storage and Servicing Request of JPRS Reports 
that have been Previously Printed  
This support would have to continue to be 
provided by JPRS or have the requestors go to 
other Agency sources. P&PD does not have the 
space or the personnel to provide this service 
However, as with other FBIS reports, P&PD will 
continue to reprint and supply current reports 
that FBIS/LRB requires. 
6.7.1.f JPRS Automation Support 
P&PD will support JPRS automation efforts in 
terms of electronically receiving data and 
typesetting and printing it within the Division. 
P&PD will support pilot tests in the near term 
and provide overall support in the future. 
6.7.1.g JPRS Report Format/Appearance  
No changes in format or appearance of JPRS 
issuances will be effected without prior approval 
of JPRS. 
6.7.1.h JPRS Distribution  
P&PD would assume responsibility for distribution 
of all JPRS products. The successful transfer of

printing operations is contingent upon developing 
a compatible distribution-change system between 
FBIS and P&PD. P&PD will insure that 
distribution changes are effected on a weekly 
basis. 
6.7.1.i Printing Support for JPRS AD Hoc  
Requirements  
P&PD would assume responsibility for JPRS' 
printing and disseminating ad hoc issuances such 
as specialized reports, reprints, reference aids, 
newsletters, glossaries, handbooks and 
supplements, and biographic cards for OCR. 
6.7.1.j Photo and Graphics Requirements  
for JPRS  
P&PD would assume responsibility for all photo 
and graphics requirements for JPRS reports and 
any additional photographic support performed by 
the JPRS photographer. 
7.0 Conclusions  
7.1 Based on the analysis and the information gathered 
for and contained in this study, it is both feasible 
and practical for P&PD to assume the printing 
production responsibility for the JPRS publications. 
This conclusion is based on the following facts: 
a. P&PD has the capability and versatility to 
provide JPRS with a higher quality product in 
quicker production throughput time. 
b. Although initially the actual printing cost 
will be higher, there are overall annual dollar 
savings in excess of $45,000 to the Agency if 
P&PD were to assume the JPRS printing function. 
c. The P&PD's assumption of JPRS's printing 
responsibilty will provide a better opportunity 
for developing and implementing an automated 
JPRS publishing system whereby the quality and 
format of the publication can be improved and 
further cost savings can be obtained. 
d. P&PD assumption of this responsibility provides 
the Agency with better overall management and 
support of Agency printing requirements 
including better equipment, space, personnel 
utilization, and cost savings by consolidating 
supply purchases and obtaining bulk rate

? 
discounts, consolidating budgets, and 
administrative support. 
e. JPRS printing personnel are provided a better 
career path with more opportunities for 
advancment by learning a variety of job skills 
which will provide greater job satisfaction. 
8.0 Recommendations  
8.1 It is recommended that P&PD assume the responsibility 
for supporting all JPRS printing production 
requirements as soon as possible. It is also 
recommended that JPRS transfer to P&PD all personnel, 
equipment, and funding that is currently used or that 
is programmed for support of their printing production 
requirements. 
8.2 In order to implement the recommendation outlined 
above, it is further recommended that a P&PD/JPRS Task 
Team be assigned to develop and document both a 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the two involved 
components, and an overall implementation 
plan/schedule. This task team will also determine the 
actual personnel equipment and FY-84 funds to be 
transferred to P&PD. The MOU and implementation plan 
should be developed on or before 30 September 1983 with 
the overall implementation of the recommendation 
occuring in phases between September and December 1983.

During a recent conference with Mr. Donald F. Sinsel, GSA 
Accident & Fire Prevention Safety Officer, and with 
from your office, certain modifications were discussed 
regarding the basement area of the subject building in order to 
comply with GSA safety recommendations, local code requirements, 
and minimum comfort standards for ventilating and air condition-
ing the existing basement printing plant. 
The following basic modifications should be implemented: 
1) Provide a sprinkler system for the printing plant, basement 
corridors and storage rooms. 
?CCCCC HONE 
I301) 942-7980 
2) Provide a separate HVAC system designed for the printing area. 
3) Provide fire-rated partitions and doors at the basement corridor 
in lieu of the demountable vinyl covered non-rated partitions. 
The preliminary construction Costs are as follows: 
New basement sprinkler system $ 15,000 
Printing Plant NVAC incl areaway for exhaust 24,000 
Elec power mod for NVAC 3,000 
Ceiling alteration and repair 1,000 
Fire-rated corridor walls, doors & painting 7,000  
Total estimated construction cost $ 50,000. 
A/E design time would be four weeks including specifications. 
NOTE:- Total renovation cost Will be 
$62,500.00, which includes a 
25 percent markup for GSA 
management of the contract.

ARTICLE STRESSES EDUCATION ON COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY 
Nanjing XINHUA RIBAO in Chinese 16 Nov 82 p 4 
[Article by Gong Mian [7895 0517]: "Fertile Soil for the Continuous 
Growth of Communist Ideology"] 
[Text] At the present time when education in communist ideology is 
stressed, some comrades ask: "As our society is presently 
a socialist one, is it not going beyond the stage of its development if we 
emphasize education in communist ideology?" Is this happening? This 
question must indeed be clarified. 
The ideological system of communism was created early in the era of 
capitalism, as a product of the struggle between the proletariat and the 
bourgeoisie. Engels made a concise and penetrating statement on this point 
in his article "The Development of Socialism from Utopia to Science," where 
he said: "Socialism is no longer regarded as a chance invention from the 
mind of some genius, but rather as the natural product of the struggle 
between the two historically engendered classes, the proletariat and the 
bourgeoisie. Its task is no more to theorize on some perfect social order, 
but rather to study the process of historical economics which of necessity 
brought these two classes into being and the struggle between them, and 
furthermore, to seek out from the economic conditions created by the 
struggle such measures will resolve the conflict." This explains how the 
struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie provided the rich 
practical experiences for the formation of the ideological system experiences 
for the formation of the ideological system of communism, and the birth of 
the ideological system of communism raised the struggle of the proletariat 
from the stage of a spontaneous struggle to one of conscious struggle and 
brought the communist movement to a state of flourishing development on a 
worldwide scale. One further point must also be explained in this context, 
namely that the struggle of the proletariat in a capitalist .society was not 
the only precondition for the birth of the ideological system of 
communism, but that there were also the excellent achievements of the minds 
of mankind in the 19th century that created the conditions enabling the 
ideological system of communism to be born. Germany's philosophy, England's 
political science and economics and the utopian socialism of France are the 
three sources of Marxism. Without these splendid achievements, the creation 
of the ideological system of communism would have been impossible.

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP12-00036R000100220004-3 
These explanations show that the ideological system of communism had.the 
conditions for its birth prepared by the capitalist society, was therefore 
also born in the capitalist society and guided the struggle of the 
proletariat in that, society. In his article "State and Revolution" Lenin 
said: "Communism was born in capitalism, historically it developed out 
of capitalism and was the result of social forces born in capitalism 
exerting their effects.". This realization is very important because it 
can make us understand why the proletariat during its struggle in the 
capitalist society could not do without the guidance of the ideological 
system of communism. Why cannot the socialist society in the same way 
relinquish the guidance of the ideological system of communism? Since the 
new democratic revolution in our country won its victory under the guidance 
of the ideological system of communism, the socialist society should all the 
more engage in its construction guided by the Ideological system of 
communism. This also answers the question of whether there is any excess 
in doing so or going beyond present conditions. 
The socialist society is the initial stage of the communist society, but its 
policies must not be mixed up with the policies of the communist society. If 
the two are mixed up, it will inevitably lead to the ruin of the entire 
socialist construction. The communist tendencies of 1958, when policies of a 
communist stage of society were applied to a socialist society, resulted in 
enormous losses to the entire national economy. This was a profound 
lesson. However, at the socialist stage of society it is necessary 
continuously to raise the people's communist consciousness, not only as a 
requirement of the socialist construction, but also to provide conditions 
for the future transition to a communist society. It is even more important 
to prepare the socialist society to be the fertile soil for the propagation 
of communist ideology. In the capitalist, semicolonial and semifeudal 
society of China, it was the existence of a proletariat and the guidance 
of the communist party that enabled communist ideology to nurture hundreds 
of millions of people and inspire tham consciously to struggle for the 
liberation of mankind. Then is it not absurd to talk of exceeding our social 
stage when we engage in education in communist ideology in a socialist 
society with a system of public ownership of the means of production? The 
new party statute gives a clear answer to this question in its general 
principles, it says: "Fundamentally speaking, the socialist system has 
eliminated the contradictions inherent in capitalism per se, which capitalism 
was unable to overcome, and is possessed of an excellence that is incomparably 
higher than capitalism. Socialism has enabled the people truly'to become 
masters Of the country, increasingly to break away from the old customs 
formed under the exploitative systems or under the system of private owner-
ship of the means of production, increasingly to raise the communist 
consciousness, and form common ideals, a common morality and a common sense 
of discipline." As the socialist society creates these excellent conditions 
for the propagation of the communist ideology, can we possibly forget the 
responsibilities duly shouldered by communists and abandon the communist 
education of the broad masses of the people? 
Why do some comrades believe that education in communist ideology at the 
present time is beyond the present stage of our society. One important

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP12-00036R000100220004-3 
reason is that they do not differentiate between education in communist' 
ideology and the implementation of socialist policies at the present 
stage. Every time that propaganda of communist ideology is mentioned, 
they believe that a change is to be made in our socialist policies. This 
is a misunderstanding. We must, on the one hand, engage justly and 
forcefully'in propaganda of the communist ideology and continuously raise the 
people's communist consciousness, but, on the other hand, also strictly 
implement our socialist policies; both activities must not be confused and 
mixed up. However, we must also not forget that the socialist policies are 
guided by communist ideology and the ultimate goal is the realization of 
a communist society. If we would forget this point, we would not be able 
to truly understand the socialist policies. Those comrades who believe that 
education in communist ideology exceeds the present stage of our society are 
not clearly aware of the relationship of these two things to each other. 
The documents from the 12th CPC National Congress clearly point to the 
necessity to engage in education in communist ideology, integrating 
theory and practice, and a conscientious study of these documents will 
correctly enlighten us on this point.

Expressions of Good Will 
Nanjing XINHUA RIBAO in Chinese 29 Nov 82 p 2 
[Article by XINHUA DAILY commentator: "Wishes for a Prosperous Development 
in the Work of Our Law Society"] 
[Text] The Jiangsu Provincial Law Society has been formally inaugurated; 
this is an important event on the political science and law front and of 
significance for the legal circles of our province. We hope that all 
comrades of the legal circles throughout our province will adhere to the 
guiding principles of the 12th CPC National Congress, achieve new successes 
in the building up of our legal system and will increase the prosperous and 
flourishing developments in all research undertakings in the field of 
jurisprudence. 
Socialist jurisprudence is a new, presently developing science, which is 
playing an important role in strengthening the socialist legal system, 
in consolidating the country's system of people's democratic dictatorship, 
in promoting the socialist economy as well as ideological and cultural 
developments. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Congress, 
the construction of our legal system has made important progress and is 
being gradually completed and perfected. This is the major condition for 
achieving a long period of good government and peace for our country. 
Inspired by the spirit of the 12th CPC National Congress, the people of the 
whole country are now making a concerted effort to initiate in a compre-
hensive way a new situation in our socialist modernizations, to build up our 
country into a highly cultured, high democratic socialist state. Comrade 
Hu Yaobang pointed out: "The buildup of material and spiritual civilization 
must in every way rely on the continued development of socialist democracy for 
its guarantee and support." "The buildup of socialist democracy must be 
closely integrated with the buildup of the socialist legal system so as to 
institutionalize and legalize the socialist democracy." This not only raises 
new and higher demands on legal research, but opens up broad prospects for 
people in the legal progession to display fully their intelligence and 
ability. In the building of our socialist material and spiritual civiliza-
tion, which we are not vigorously promoting, there is ample scope for 
effective legal research. 
Fundamentally speaking, law is the expression of the will of that class 
which has gained victory and seized political power in the state. Our 
jurisprudence has socialist law as the target of its research. Its 
ultimate goal is to promote the continuous perfection of the socialist 
system and the continuous progress in all undertakings of socialist 
construction, consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, 
upholding the leadership of the Communist Party and upholding Marxism-
Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The work of legal research must uphold 
the four fundamental principles, otherwise it would lose its progressive 
ideals and goals, would be without any motivating spirit and would certainly 
lead to erroneous conclusions. We must use the Marxist viewpoint of the 
state and of law in our studies of the important topics of legal theory and 
64

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/08/26 : CIA-RDP12-00036R000100220004-3 
practice that urgently require solutions, and must continuously broaden the 
road of our legal research. At present, our legal research must focus on 
the various new problems that have arisen in the field of judicial 
administration and legislation during the progress of our four moderniza-
tions. In the ideological field and in our actual work, we must serve the 
buildup of a highly developed material and spiritual civilization with a 
heightened consciousness and greater clarity. We must bring the authority 
of the law fully into play as we struggle to realize the fundamental turn 
for the better in the financial and economic conditions of our country, in 
the general mood of society and in the work stkle of the party, as our 
jurisprudence must also make new contributions in its legal research. 
The Fifth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress is just now in 
progress. The formulation and adoption of our new Constitution initiates a 
new phase in the development of our socialist democracy and in the construc-
tion of our legal system. This sets new and higher demands for our legal 
research. The inauguration of the Jiangsu Law Society will provide more 
favorable conditions for a mobilization and organization of all forces of 
the legal circles throughout our province. We are confident that it will be 
able to create a new situation for legal research in our province. We hope 
all comrades in the field of jurisprudence throughout our province will, 
through their actual practice, make efforts to explore things that show a 
regular lawlike nature in the field of jurisprudence, raise them to the 
state of theories, use them in turn to direct and guide practice and thus 
reap a rich harvest in the field of legal research.

Expressions of Good Will 
? 
Nanjing XINHUA RIBAO in Chinese 29 Nov 82 p 2 
(Article by XINHUA DAILY commentator: "Wishes for a Prosperous Development in the 
Work of Our Law Society') 
(Text) The Jiangsu Provincial Law Society has been formally inaugurated; this is an important 
event on the political science and law front and of significance for the legal circles of our province. We 
hope that all comrades of the legal circles throughout our province will adhere to the guiding principles 
of the 12th CPC National Congress, achieve new successes in the building up of our legal system and 
will increase the prosperous and flourishing developments in all research undertakings in the field of 
jurisprudence. 
Socialist jurisprudence is a new, presently developing science, which is playing an important 
role in strengthing the socialist legal system, in consolidating the country's system of people's 
democratic dictatorship, in promoting the socialist economy as well as ideological and cultural 
developments. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Congress, the construction of our le-
gal system has made important progress and is being gradually completed and perfected. This is the 
major condition for achieving a long period of good government and peace for our country. Inspired by 
the spirit of the 12th CPC National Congress, the people of the whole country are now making a con-
certed effort to initiate in a comprehensive way a new situation in our socialist modernizations, to build 
up our country into a highly cultured, high democratic socialist state. Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed 
out: "The buildup of material and spiritual civilization must in every way rely on the continued devel-
opment of socialist democracy for its guarantee and support." "The buildup of socialist democracy 
must be closely integrated with the buildup of the socialist democracy." This not only raises new and 
higher demands on legal research, but opens up broad prospects for people in the legal progession to 
display fully their intelligence and ability. In the building of our socialist material and spiritual 
civilization, which we are not vigorously promoting, there is ample scope for effective legal research. 
Fundamentally speaking, law is the expression of the will of that class which has gained victory 
and seized political power in the state. Our jurisprudence has socialist law as the target of its research. 
Its ultimate goal is to promote the continuous perfection of the socialist system and the continuous pro-
gress in all undertakings of socialist construction, consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, 
upholding the leadership of the Communist Party and upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong 
Thought. The wOrk of legal research must uphold the four fundamental principles, otherwise it would 
lose its progressive ideals and goals, would be without any motivating spirit and would certainly lead to 
erroneous conclusions. We must use the Marxist viewpoint of the state and of law in our studies of the 
important topics of legal theory and practice that urgently require solutions, and must continuously 
broaden the road of our legal research. At present, our legal research must focus on the various new 
problems that have arisen in the field of judicial administration and legislation during the progress of 
our four modernizations. In the ideological field and in our actual work, we must serve the buildup of a 
highly developed material and spiritual civilization with a hightened consciousness and greater clarity. 
We must bring the authority of the law fully into play as we struggle to realize the fundamental turn 
for the better in the financial and economic conditions of our country, in the general mood of society 
and in the work style of the party, as our jurisprudence must also make new contributions in its legal 
research. 
The Fifth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress is just now in progress. The 
formulation and adoption of our new Constitution initiates a new phase in the development of our so-
cialist democracy and in the construction of our legal system. This sets new and higher demands for 
our legal research. The inauguration of the Jiangsu Law Society will provide rmiie favorable conditions 
for mobilization and organization of all forces of the legal circles throughout our province. We are con-
fident that it will be able to create a new situation for legal research in our province. We hope all com-
rades in the field of jurisprudence throughout our province will, through their actual practice, make ef-
forts to explore things that show a regular lawlike nature in the field of jurisprudence, raise them to the 
state of theories, use them in turn to direct and guide practice and thus reap a rich harvest in the field 
of legal research.
