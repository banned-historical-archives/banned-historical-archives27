 ANGOLA: NEW TURN
 The recent arrival of substantial amounts of
 new Soviet and Cuban military aid for the leftist
 Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola is
 beginning to have an impact on the fighting. After
 suffering military reverses at the hands of its allied
 foes for the past month, the Movement began this
 week to battle back.
 In the area north of Luanda around
 Quifangando, where the fighting had been
 stalemated for some time, the Zairian-supported
 National Front for the Liberation of Angola
 appears to be coming under growing pressure
 from the Popular Movement. Front forces may
 have been forced to give ground. There has also
 been bitter seesaw fighting some 60 miles from
 the Front stronghold of Carmona.
 In the central sector, the situation is confused
 with heavy fighting reported between the Popular
 Movement and the joint forces of the National
 Front and the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola operating near Malanje,
 Dondo, and Quibala. The Popular Movement
 appears to be at least holding its own in the sec-
 tor; it still controls the vital Cambambe dam near
 Dondo that supplies Luanda's electric power. Ac-
 cording to press reports, National Front - National
 Union troops spearheaded by South African ad-
 visers and white mercenaries, which had been
 sweeping toward Luanda from the south, have
 been stalled.
 On the political scene, the joint regime
 proclaimed by National Front and National Union
 leaders on  November 11  in  opposition  to
 Agostinho Neto's Luanda-based government
 finally unveiled a leadership slate of 16 officials
 this week. The post of prime minister in the coali-
 tion regime, which is based in Nova Lisboa, is to
 be rotated monthly between Johnny Eduardo Pin-
 nock of the National Front and jose N'Dele of the
 National Union, the ranking representatives of
 their respective groups in the Angolan tran-
 sitional government that collapsed last summer
 under military pressure from the Popular Front.
 Neither National Front leader Holden Rober-
 to nor the National Union's Jonas Savimbi took
 positions in their regime, which clearly remains a
 fragile structure. It has not been recognized by
 any foreign country. Neto's regime, on the other
 hand, has now been formally accepted by  27
 states.

 Nigeria this week became the eleventh
 African country to recognize the Popular Move-
 ment, citing growing public attention to South
 Africa's involvement with the Movement's op-
 ponents as the main reason for its action. Lagos'
 example  may  sway other  nonradical African
 governments to follow suit despite the concern
 many of them share over Soviet and Cuban sup-
 port for the Popular Movement.
 Meanwhile, the Africans' dilemma over the
 Angolan crisis may lead to an emergency summit
 meeting of thi Organization of African Unity.
 Support for holding such a conference spurted
 this week and now seems likely to attain eventual-
 ly the required approval of two thirds of the 46
 member states. Backers of the Popular
 Movement-led by Somalia, Guinea, Congo, and
 Mozambique-'lave led the drive, clearly hoping
 to use the meeting to change OAU policy from
 neutrality in the Angolan conflict to endorsement
 of Neto's group as the country's sole legitimate
 government. If a summit is held, it will probably
 result in open quarreling among the Africans
 rather than progress toward a settlement in
 Angola.

 LEBANON: TALKS SUSPENDED
 Negotiations among Lebanon's bitterly an-
 major political groups broke down this
 tagonistic
 week in the wake o` renewed fighting between
 the Christian militias and Muslim leftists. The                             f
 national dialogue committee, crca.ed to devise a
 compromise to end the protracted internal crisis,
 has not met since November 24 when it adjourn-
 after an acrimonious debate over which group
 ed
 was responsible for the collapse late last week of
 the three-week-old cease-fire. The refusal of the
 Christian leaders to discuss reforms that would
 give the Muslims a greater share of political
 power continues to be the principal stumbling
 block to a solution.
 Christian Interior Minister Shamun, who is
 head of the National Liberal Party and the most
 powerful Christian in the cabinet, boycotted the
 meeting of the committee on November 24 in a
 show of anger over what Christians consider ef-
 forts by the leftists to intensify the fighting. Prime
 Minister Karami responded sharply in a speech
 the next day in parliament in which he denounc-
 ed the Christian leaders for their refusal to allow               Interior Minister Shamun

 made to possible partition of Lebanon. Karami       Renewed antagonism between Karami and

 might offer the Muslims a 50-50 split in parlia-
 ment. The continued fighting and inability of
 government bodies to function effectively appear
 to have reinforced the determination of Christian
 leaders to stay in office and resist making con-
 cessions.
 The Soviets have come out publicly in sup-
 port of efforts to end the fighting in Lebanon.
 Although Moscow clearly would prefer to see a
 more leftist Lebanon emerge from the current
 crisis, it fears this cannot be accomplished without
 taking the lid off the Arab-Israeli powderkeg.
 ?  turmoil in Lebanon might trigger
 Syrian and I, a aeli intervention.
 ?  civil war and foreign intervention
 could force the fedayeen to disperse to
 other Arab countries, diluting Moscow's
 already limited influence with the
 Palestinians.
 ?  the Lebanese situation is distracting
 the fedayeen and Syrians from objectives
 more important to the Soviets, specifically
 undercutting US influence in the Middle
 East and isolating Egypt.
 The conflict between Soviet interest in sup-
 porting the left and avoiding an intensification of
 the fighting has led the Soviets to employ mixed
 tactics.
 They have praised the Palestinian Liberation
 Organization for staying out of the fighting.
 Privately, Moscow has even warned the PLO of
 the dangers of Israeli intervention and advised it
 to support the efforts of the Lebanese govern-
 ment to assert control. At the same time, the
 Soviets have made it clear that they will support
 the PLO if its freedom to operate in Lebanon is
 threatened.
 The Soviets have also commended Syrian
 attempts to mediate the crisis and evidently told
 Asad last month in Moscow that they supported
 his efforts to reduce tensions.
 The Soviets, however, have not forgotten
 their friends on the left. Moscow has consist-ntly
 championed Lebanese "progressive forces." The
 Soviets hope the crisis will increase leftist in-
 fluence in Lebanese political life and strengthen
 the position of the relatively small, pro-Soviet
 Lebanese Communist Party (LCP).
 The USSR acquiesced in th,: decision of the
 LCP to enhance the party's standing with the
 Lebanese left by participating in the fighting, and,
 particularly in the early stages of the fighting, the
 Communists were prominent behind the
 barricades.
 But the Soviets have apparently not given the
 party all the help it wanted and may not be able to
 control younger party militants. In September,
 Lebanese party leaders complained about the lack
 of stronger, more direct Soviet backing.
 There is no indication that Moscow has rush-
 ed guns to the leftist combatants, but neither is
 there any sign that the USSR has sought to halt the
 flow of Soviet-made arms from Arab countries
 and the PLO to them. Furthermore, Kamal
 Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party has con-
 tinued buying arms directly from East European
 countries, while the sources of East European -
 made arms for the Phalangists have dried up.
 Moscow undoubtedly thinks that as fang as
 the Phalangists are heavily armed, the Lebanese
 left must have the wherewithal to protect its in-
 terests and forestall a right-wing threat to the
 Palestinians. In any event, the Soviets recognize
 they cannot close Syrian, PLO, Libyan, and Iraqi
 arsenals to the left.
 Moscow apparently hopes that the Lebanese
 crisis can be ended through political and social
 changes that will improve the position of the
 Muslim left, but which will not jeopardize
 Lebanon's territorial integrity or stability. The
 Soviets seem pessimistic, however, that the latter
 will happen and recognize that their ability to in-
 fluence events is marginal.

 BANGLADESH-INDIA: TENSIONS RISING
 Tensions between the two countries
 mounted over the past week, increasing the
 possibility of eventual Indian military intervention
 in Bangladesh. Growing signs of anti-Indian senti-
 ment in Dacca were highlighted by the wounding
 of the Indian high commissioner on November 26
 by unknown assailants. Even before the shooting,
 Bengalee concern about Indian intentions had
 been fueled by indications in New Delhi that
 Prime Minister Gandhi's government had been
 taking an increasingly critical view of
 developments in Bangladesh.
 New Delhi may have been reacting in part to
 recent implied criticism of the Indian government
 by two of Bangladesh's deputy martial law ad-
 ministrators, General Zia arid Commodore Khan.
 In calling on their countrymen for discipline and
 support, both leaders emphasized that external
 forces-a clear reference to India-were behind
 some of Bangladesh's problems. Zia and Khan
 may have played up the Indian angle in an effort
 to unify the population and the mutiny-wracked
 army, both reservoirs of anti-Indian sentiment.
 Anti-Indian wall posters and graffiti have also
 appeared recently in several Bangladesh cities.
 Prior to the attack on the Indian diplomat, a
 number of Bengalee officials in both Dacca and
 New Delhi were voicing concern about India to
 US embassy officers. The Bengalees alleged that
 India has increased its forces on the borde: and is
 attempting to subvert the Dacca government.
 They saw as particularly ominous the more
 emotional and pessimistic tone that has been
 adopted by the censored Indian press in its recent
 coverage of events in their country. The press has
 emphasized  the continuing  instability  in
 Bangladesh and New Delhi's concern for its of-
 ficial personnel and other nationals there. This
 week, two Calcutta papers, for the first time, ac-
 cused the Dacca government of conducting an
 "anti-Indian .:ampaign."
 New Delhi's attitude is also reflected in com-
 ments by an Indian official to a US embassy officer
 this week that small groups of refugees from
 Bangladesh's minority Hindu community have
 begun crossing the border into India. Although
 the Indian official said that the departure "had
 not yet reached the proportion of an exodus," he
 complained that some Hindus have been harass-
 ed and that the community, in general, is uneasy.
 Bangladesh's Hindus, who total about ten
 million, are surely worried about what may be
 coming, and some may be leaving the country. A
 few Hindus reportedly were roughed up in Dacca
 shortly after a wave of mutinies within the armed
 forces began over two weeks ago. The assass;na-
 tion attempt will heighten the Hindus' concern.
 Indian spokesmen have frequently warned that a
 flight of Hindu refugees to India like that in 1971
 would force New Delhi to intervene militarily.
 A high-level Bengalee official, in a conversa-
 tion with a US embassy officer, subsequently
 claimed that no unusual movement of Hindus
 into India has occurred and insisted his govern-

 There have also been reports that Bengalee
 military units have clashed near the Indian border
 with a guerrilla group led by Qader Siddiqui, a
 diehard supporter of former president Mujib. Sid-

 frustrated by Siddiqui's ability to elude a con-
 certed government effort to capture him follow-
 ing his successful ambush of an army unit last
 month.

 Meanwhile, conditions have remained
 relatively calm over the past week at the Dacca
 base and other military posts where mutinies
 flared earlier this month. It is unlikely, however,
 that the long-standing economic and other
 grievances of the enlisted men that precipitated
 the mutinies have been resolved, and tensions
 between officers and troops are probably just
 below the surface. Many officers, keenly aware of
 the killing of several of their colleagues during
 the mutinies, may be reluctant to test their
 authority, and overall morale within the armed
 services will probably remain low for some time.
 SPANISH SAHARA: ALGIERS REACTS
 Algeria's sharp denunciation at the UN last
 week of the recent Spanish-Moroccan-Maurita-
 nian accord on the future of Spanish Sahara was
 the opening salvo of a campaign for a full-scale
 General \ssembly debate on the issue. Algiers
 wants the assembly to reject the agreement,
 which provides for a phased turnover of the
 territory's  administration  to  Rabat  and
 Nouakchott, and call for a referendum on
 self-determination.     Madrid,  Rabat, and
 Nouakchott, on the other hand, want UN ap-
 proval to limit promised consultations with
 Saharans to hand-picked tribal leaders. The issue
 is currently joined in the trusteeship committee.
 In a formal note circulated at the UN last
 week, Algeria declared the tripartite accord null
 and void and denounced Spain for agreeing to it.
 Algiers contended that Spain could transfer ad-
 ministrative responsibilities only to the Saharan
 people or to the UN itself. A;geria further argued
 that Morocco and Mauritania did not have any
 right to exercise authority in the territory unless
 the General Assembly officially accords their
 claims precedence over the principle of
 self-determination. The Algerians want the
 assembly to reaffirm earlier resolutions and en-
 dorse a referendum in the territory.
 Madrid has defended its action by main-
 taining that, under the accord, it would only be
 turning over administration of its Saharan
 territory to the other two countries and that
 sovereignty is a separate issue to be decided by
 the UN. In the trusteeship committee, Spain's
 representatives are arguing that the tripartite ac-
 cord resulted from their government's com-
 pliance with resolutions adopted by the Security
 Council to avoid a conflict. Spain insists,
 moreover, the view of the Saharan people will be
 "respected" through the territorial general
 assembly, a group of Saharan leaders expected to
 be responsive to the new joint administration.
 Morocco and Mauritania have buttressed their
 case with statements by Saharan spokesmen that
 support the accord.
 Algeria's demand for a referendum under
 UN auspices is being supported in the committee
 by the  Polisario Front, a  pro-independence
 Saharan political group supported by Algiers. Last
 week, a spokesman for the Front threatened that
 his group will use force to achieve its goal. His
 remarks, coupled with recent Algerian press
 statements, provide fresh indications that the
 Boumediene regime may be preparing to bark
 the Front in a sustained guerrilla effort.
 Within the disputed territory, Polisario
 guerrillas are quietly establishing a foothold in the
 vacuum created by Spain's recent withdrawal
 from two thirds of the territory. They have oc-
 cupied a town :n the south and have established
 themselves  along  the  Mauritanian-Saharan
 border. They are also active in the northeast,
 where they have clashed with Moroccan forces
 who moved into this border area as Spanish
 troops withdrew.
 Meanwhile, Moroccan and Mauritanian of-
 ficials have arrived in the territorial capital of El
 Aaiun to serve as assistant governors in the
 provisional administration headed by the Spanish
 governor general. The provisional administration
 will govern the territory until the Spanish
 withdrawal next February. The Moroccan is one
 of King Hassan's most trusted advisers, attesting to
 the importance the King attaches to his regime's
 role  in  the  new  joint  administration.

 OMAN: DENOUEMENT IN DHOFAR
 Leftist insurgents who for a decade have been
 waging guerrilla war in Oman's Dhofar Province
 appear to be giving up the struggle and leaving
 the country in the face of strong pressure from
 the forces of Sultan Qabus supported by Iranian
 troops. The radical regime in neighboring South
 Yemen, which has long'nourished the rebellion
 with material aid, seems disposed at present not
 to contest the rebels' ouster. As the fighting has
 moved closer to the disputed border between the
 two countries, Aden has been strengthening its
 defenses with a new assist from the USSR.
 An Omani-Iranian offensive that began last
 h=nnth has moved to within a few miles of the
 border, cut rebel supply routes from South
 Yemen, and, according to the Iranians, capt'aret;
 the main rebel supply complex in Dhofar.
 Resistance to the drive has been light
 The Ornanis and their allies are pushing hard
 to inflict a decisive military defeat on the rebels,
 with little regard for what the Aden regime might
 do. Air attacks have been carried out across the
 border against South Yemeni artillery positions
 that have been supporting the rebels, and artillery
 exchanges have occurred almost daily since
 mid-October.

 Although Aden does not seem to be girding
 for an early major military intervention on behalf
 of the rebels, its buildup does carry some risk of
 provoking a wider conflict. Sultan Qabus has in-
 dicated he would consider a military buildup by
 the Yemenis provocative, and he may be tempted
 to carry t.'? fight to them.
 Several other Arab governments in the Ara-
 bian Peninsula, concerned about the growing
 danger of a clash between Oman and South
 Yemen, have intensified their mediation efforts.
 In the resulting discussions, the South Yemenis
 have argued for an early withdrawal from Oman
 of the Iranian forces that have played a key role in
 defeating, for now at least, the rebels' attempt to
 capture control of Dhofar Province.
 ZAIRE: ECONOMIC STABILIZATION
 President Mobutu has endorsed an economic
 stabilization plan approved earlier by the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund. Zaire is now eligible for
 a loan of as much as $100 million to ease a
 balance-of-payments deficit this year that could
 reach $400 million.
 The plan, drawn up by a Zairian government
 committee, calls for a hard-hitting program in-
 cluding a drastic cutback in government spen-
 ding, a rescheduling of foreign debt, a rise in
 agricultural prices, and a return of foreign in-
 vestors in both the private and state-run sectors.
 The government will keep its majority holdings in
 key areas ich as oil and copper mining. Mobutu
 has set up a commission to enforce the program.
 Zaire's grave economic situation has been
 caused by the sharp drop in the international
 price of copper this year, the concurrent rise in
 import costs, the government's excessive
 budgetary expenditures, and the reduction in
 output resulting from a widespread nationaliza-
 tion of foreign companies and retail outlets.
 Zaire may also have to devalue its currency, a
 move that is anathema to Mobutu. Devaluation
 would bring the state-owned company responsi-
 ble for almost all Zaire's copper output back into
 the black. As it stands, the company will be un-
 able to pay government taxes next year, leaving
 Zaire without a viable budget.
 If the stabilization program is fully im-
 plemented, the worker and consumer will suffer.
 Sharp cutbacks in government spending could in-
 volve either wage reductions-as in the 1967
 retrenchment-or more layoffs. In any case, the
 program will give Mobutu trouble in maintaining
 the support of his civil service, the official party,
 and the military.

 PORTUGAL: CLIPPING THE LEFT WING
 Anti-Communists in the Portuguese military
 appear to be in a stronger position following an
 unsuccessful rebellion on November 25 by leftist
 paratroopers.   Order will  return  to  Portugal,
 however, only if anti-Communist officers follow
 up and install loyal officers in the key military un-
 its that have long been dominated by leftists.
 By midday on November 26, the government
 had retaken the three air bases and the Lisbon air
 region headquarters that had been occupied by
 the rebels. Commandos loyal to the government
 later forced the surrender of radical military
 police and the leftist-dominated light artillery
 regiments in Lisbon that had sided with the
 paratroopers. Radio and television stations taken
 over by radical troops shortly after the rebellion
 started were later cut off the air by the govern-
 ment, which substituted programs beamed from
 Porto.
 Backed by several members of the
 Revolutionary  Council-including  a  subdued
 Otelo de Carvalho-Pfesident Costa Gomes im-
 posed a state of siege on the Lisbon military
 region on the evening of November 25. He
 ordered a midnight-to-five curfew, restricted
 freedom of assembly, and banned the publication
 of area newspapers for November 26. Although
 the curfew was not strictly enforced, the capital
 was quiet and activity was normal the next day.
 The paratroopers' rebellion was apparently
 planned in advance, but was not widely coor-
 dinated with other leftist military or civilian
 groups. The rebels focused on demanding the
 removal of anti-Communists in the air force high
 command-including chief of staff Morais da
 Silva-who were held responsible for disbanding
 the dissident paratrooper unit at Tancos, about 70
 miles northeast of Lisbon, last weekend.
 Efforts by a few leftist soldiers to attract ad-
 ditional backing by calling for opposition to the
 Revolutionary Council's decision to replace the
 left-leaning Carvalho as head of the Lisbon
 military region with an anti-Communist officer
 received only scant support. There were in-
 dications that Carvalho also lost his position as
 head of the internal security forces and that the
 internal security command itself had been
 abolished.
 The pleas by leftists for the people to take to
 the streets in support of the paratroopers went
 largely unanswered. The only significant par-
 ticipation by civilians occurred at Monte Real,
 some 75 miles north of Lisbon, where pro-govern-
 ment civilians reportedly assisted in recapturing
 the local base from the rebels. The Communist
 Party alerted its militants, but took no action.
 The Communists' failure to join in the
 rebellion has prompted Labor Minister Tomas

 Rosa to speculate that the party may have en-
 couraged the feeble effort in the hope it would
 spark a countercoup from the right. The Com-
 munists may have reasoned that the rightists
 would meet swift resistance and the Communists
 would be able to reclaim some popular support.
 The events of midweek represent a reversal for
 the Communists, but the party still has most of its
 political assets intact-particularly in labor.
 Anti-Communists in the military, as well as
 the non-Communist political parties, are in a
 strong position to exploit the rebellion, just as the
 left exploited the abortive rightist coup last March
 11. The campaign to restore discipline in the
 military by purging radical leftist officers will be
 given a strong boost if the anti-Communists are
 prepared to follow through on their success.
 President Costa Gomes appears to have read the
 trend in time to join the winning side, but he
 prefers a balance of forces and may try to rein in
 any group that seeks to capitalize on the situation.
 The threat remains that rightists may make a
 move that would confuse the situation, but con-
 servative exile groups apparently were not ready
 to act during the tense hours on November 25.
 Similarly, there was no effort by separatists in the
 Azores to take advantage of Lisbon's preoccupa-
 tion with the rebel paratroopers. Either group,
 however, still retains a potential for disruption
 that  could  ultimately  aid  the  Ieft.
 SPAIN: JUAN CARLOS TAKES OVER
 The death of Generalissimo Franco on
 November 20 and the investiture of King Juan
 Carlos ! last weekend have set the stage in Spain
 for a struggle between the ultra right, which will
 fiercely resist any moves toward liberalization,
 and those within the establishment who hope to
 bring about a gradual opening of Spain's political
 system.
 The spotlight is now on Juan Carlos. The new
 King does not have Franco's absolute power-he
 cannot, for example, issue decree laws without
 reference to the cabinet, Council of the Realm, or
 parliament. Nevertheless, he will be in a position
 to play a strong role, especially during these
 crucial early days of his reign.
 Juan Carlos' most pressing problem will be to
 convince the moderates that he supports
 liberalization without completely alienating the
 far right. In his first address to the nation after be-
 ing proclaimed  King, Juan Carlos spoke in
 carefully guarded terms of evolutionary change.
 Speaking to the conservative parliament, the King
 was constrained to avoid words like
 "democracy," bu? he did project the need for a
 pluralistic society  and, by implication, for
 evolutionary change. Significantly, he made no
 mention of the National Movement-Spain's only
 legal political party. The speech was well receiv-
 ed, and Juan Carlos astutely avoided offending
 any but the most extreme elements of the right
 and left.
 During the next two weeks the King will have
 to make decisions on two crucial appointments:
 the prime minister and the president of the parlia-
 ment. Prime Minister Arias is expected to submit
 his resignation as soon as the dust settles. Though
 identified with the Franco regime, Arias has not
 alienated those seeking a more open society, and
 it would be difficult to find a viable replacement
 at this time. Arias may be kept on at least until the
 parliamentary election scheduled for next spring.
 The cabinet, on the other hand, is likely to be
 reshuffled with some portfolios going to the more
 liberal-minded members of the establishment.
 Juan Carlos has 10 days in which to select a
 new president of the parliament, a position which
 fell vacant on November 26. The office is impor-
 tant  because  the  incumbent automatically
 becomes president of the 17-man Council of the
 Realm, which is instrumental in the choice of a
 prime  minister.  The  outgoing  president,
 Rodriguez de Valcarcel, is marshaling regime
 forces to pressure the King into reappointing him
 for another six-year term, but Juan Carlos is
 believed to be looking for : less conservative in-
 dividual for this position.

 Juan Carlos (r) and Prime Minister Arias attend a cabinet meeting
 Political horse-trading could result in Arias
 being appointed to the presidency of the parlia-
 ment. If Rodriguez de Valcarcel is retained, it will
 be interpreted by the Spanish left as Francoism
 without Franco. If someone else is chosen, his
 political credentials will be carefully examined for
 clues to the direction in which Juan Carlos plans
 to take Spain.
 Juan  Carlos  is  under considerable
 pressure-mostly from the left, but also from
 some in the establishment-to open up the
 political process. The two most immediate issues
 facing the King are calls for amnesty for political
 prisoners and legalization of political parties. The
 King made a good-will gesture on November 26
 by issuing a royal amnesty decree reducing prison
 sentences for both political and common
 prisoners-except for crimes  involving
 terrorism-and commuting the death sentence
 for crimes committed prior 'o his investiture on
 November 22. Many opposition leaders welcom-
 ed the decree as a "positive step," but spokesmen
 for the major socialist party denounced it, saying
 it fell far short of the complete pardon for all
 political prisoners demanded by the left.
 There are deep disagreements among es-
 tablishment leaders over the question of legaliz-
 ing political parties and whether the Communists
 should be included. At this point, Juan Carlos
 seems likely to draw the line at the Communists in
 order to retain the support of the center-right.
 The Communists would almost certainly react to
 such exclusion by stepping up their opposition
 activities, perhaps by calling a general strike.
 The left remains fragmented, however, and
 initially, at least, it is the hard-line regime sup-
 porters and violence-prone groups of the far right
 that pose the greatest obstacle to evolutionary
 change. Although still a minority in the govern-
 ment, over the past year the ultra right has had
 sufficient clout to play a major role in scuttling
 Arias' limited moves toward political pluralism.
 Since the death of Franco, leaders of the Falangist
 faction of the National Movement have publicly
 condemned the idea of allowing political parties.
 Juan Carlos would, on the other hand, have
 considerable suppor  for a I-irogram of gradual
 liberali-'ation-from t-:e vast Spanish middle class,
 from I'te Church, from many members of the es-
 tablishment, from many oppositionist Christian
 Democrats and Socialists, and, at least tacitly, from
 the military. The new King is off to a good start,
 but the main tes?s lie ahead. If he can gradually
 liberalize the political process while still main-
 taining order, he will gain stature and support,
 but the task is a formidable one, and it is far from
 certain that he has the ability to succeed.

 TURKEY
 Under increasing pressure from the military
 to show some early progress on a wide range of
 problems, Turkish politicians and government
 leaders may finally be turning away somewhat
 from the intramural squabbles that have largely
 immobilized the government since early fall.
 In early November, Chief of the Turkish
 General Staff Sancar-representing the heads of
 the armed services-reportedly handed Demirel a
 formal note outlining the General Staff's dis-
 pleasure with the government's failure to deal
 effectively with the Cyprus problem,
 Turkish-Greek tensions, student violence, and the
 re-emergence of an active radical left. The note
 was delivered at about the same time Sancar had
 delivered two public speeches on the same
 theme.
 Demirel was reportedly visibly shaken by the
 note, no doubt recalling the 1971 military "note"
 that drove him from office. Although the latest
 message apparently made no specific threats,
 Demirel reportedly considered it a warning that
 the military would intervene in some manner if
 solutions to the various problems were not found
 soon.
 A move to break the impasse in parliament
 may also be under way. There are indications that
 leaders on both sides of the aisle in the National
 Assembly have tacitly agreed to support an in-
 dependent rather than a deputy affiliated with a
 particular party for the post of assembly President.
 The post is a largely honorific one, traditionally
 falling to the numerically strongest party in the
 assembly. This year, however, partisanship has
 deadlocked the voting, preventing any other
 business from  being considered since the
 legislative session began on November 1.
 The government has also initiated its first
 serious effort to deal with the current wave of
 violence on Turkey's university campuses. Securi-
 ty forces in Ankara and Istanbul carried out
 large-scale searches of student hangouts in an ap-
 parent effort to locate any arms caches and
 hopefully to capture some of the leaders of the
 extremist groups on the left and right which have
 been  responsible for most of the violence.
 Ankara still plans to reduce its dependence
 on the US as a source of arms despite the partial
 lifting of the arms embargo. The Turks are es-
 pecially interested in obtaining West European
 combat aircraft through either direct purchase or
 a license arrangement for assembly and produc-
 tion of the aircraft in Turkey. Ankara would prefer
 the partial production of some aircraft in Turkey
 as a first step in the development of an indigenous
 aircraft industry.
 Although domestic production of combat
 aircraft has been a topic of continuing but
 fruitless discussion for many years, the arms em-
 bargo has provided a major new impetus. Even
 many normally pro-US Turkish officers now feel
 that Ankara must never again be so heavily
 dependent on the US for aircraft and parts.
 The Turks are considering the Franco-British
 Jaguar, the Franco-German Alpha Jet, and the
 French Mirage. They are also hoping to purchase
 44 more Italian-built F-104s, but, since this aircraft
 is built under US license, it is unlikely that Ankara
 will choose it for production in Turkey.
 A major hurdle in the purchase or produc-
 tion of non-US aircraft is the problem of finan-
 cing. To meet higher costs, the defense budget
 has been increased substantially, and some public

 EC: THE NINE GO TO ROME
 The EC heads of government will consider
 their meeting in Rome on December 1 and 2 a
 success if Britain can be persuaded to give up its
 demand for a separate seat and accept EC
 representation at the mid-December Conference
 on  International  Economic Cooperation. The
 conference will bring together a number of
 nations representing producers and consumers of
 oil and other raw materials. Continued UK in-
 sistence on a separate seat in Paris, will pro-
 voke acrimonious discussion on the worth of Lon-
 don's commitment to the EC, especially because
 it comes at a time when the small EC members are
 still smarting over their exclusion from the meet-
 ing at Rambouillet last week of the "Big Six"
 industrial countries. The issue of Britain's role
 in the EC and its attitude toward community action
 could overshadow the entire meeting in Rome.
 Both  Prime Minister Wilson and Foreign
 Secretary Callaghan have steadfastly maintained
 that the UK would not give ip its demand for a
 separate seat. They hold that the UK potential as
 an oil producer differentiates British interests
 from those of other EC members and precludes
 representation of British interests by an EC
 delegate. If the UK's position has been designed
 to win concessions from Britain's partners on a
 minimum support price for North  Sea oil, the
 meeting in Rome provides the last reasonable oc-
 casion for working out details of the bargain.
 If, on the other hand, British opposition to
 representation in a single EC seat is in fact non-
 negotiable,  Wilson and Callaghan will be the
 focus of considerable animosity. London has
 recently held out against joint EC decisions on an-
 ti-pollution measures and transport policy and
 evidently intends soon to seek community ap-
 proval for selected import controls. To mute
 criticism that London is always a drag on com-
 munity initiatives, Wilson and Callaghan would be
 under considerable pressure to go along now
 with moves toward early direct elections to the
 European Parliament.
 Foreign Secretary Callaghan
 The European Parliament Issue
 France, West Germany, Italy, the Benelux
 countries, and Ireland all favor a proposed 1978
 date for substituting direct elections to the Euro-
 pean Parliament for the present system of ap-
 pointment from the national legislatures. Only
 Denmark supports Britain in seeking delay.
 Remaining problems include the number of
 members of parliament to be allotted each coun-
 try, the date and procedures for the election,
 and whether members should be elected to both
 national and European parliaments.
 Supporters of direct elections, including
 West German critics of other aspects of the EC,
 believe that an elected parliament will demand a
 stronger role and that closer working relations
 between fraternal parties will foster gradUal Euro-
 pe o unification.

 Other Institutional Topics
 Belgian Prime Minister Tindemans, who was
 charged at the Paris summit last December with
 drawing up a report on attitudes within the com-
 munity toward European union, plans his final
 report for year's end and will give only an oral
 progress report at Rome. He has found that
 almost all political, business, and labor leaders are
 interested in discussing Europe's prospects but
 that most European leaders have little inclination
 to subordinate immediate national aims to ad-
 vance European integration. He himself believes
 it would be worth considering reform of the EC
 Council of Ministers to provide consistent
 leadership and eliminate the semi-annual rotation
 of the presidency among C member states.
 The heads-of-government meeting in Rome
 is the last major event in Italy's six-month EC
 presidency, a period marked more by drift than
 by leadership in EC affairs, as Italian ministers
 have shown nearly exclusive preoccupation with
 domestic politics. Italy's record and the prospect
 of Luxembourg's presidency in the first half of
 1976 may stimulate  serious consideration  o~
 Tindemans'  suggestion.  Luxembourg     Prime
 Minister and Foreign Minister Thorn, who will be
 the key figure in the Luxembourg presidency, is
 simultaneously General Assembly president at the
 UN and is already under attack for absenteeism
 there.
 Ideas for reform of the EC Commission may
 also be aired at Rome. Chancellor Schmidt, for
 example, is arguing that the commission presi-
 dent should be a first-rank political figure and
 should influence the selection of other commis-
 sion membe,?s. Schmidt has also suggested a
 stronger commissioner for finance and budget, a
 suggestion reflecting the West German emphasis
 on improving management of EC financing. A
 possible decision on the form of a proposed com-
 mon EC passport, which may be issued in 1978,
 may be announced as a symbolic gesture toward
 European union.

 consideration of some political cooperation issues
 is likely. Discussion of the Euro-Arab dialogue in
 the light of the working level discussions of
 November 22-27 in Abu Dhabi may entail further
 movement toward recognition of the Palestine
 Liberation Organization. Also in prospect is an ex-
 change of views on developments in Portugal and
 Spain  and on possible ways to encourage
 UK: HOME RULE ISSUE
 The growing "English backlash" to the idea of
 home rule for Scotland and Wales has forced the
 Labor government to renege on its pledge to
 enact  devolution legislation during the
 parliamentary session that began  last week.
 Although  a  white paper outlining  the
 government's proposals was published on
 November 27, the complex implementing legisla-
 tion will not be introduced for several months.
 ?rime Minister Wilson has declared that he will
 not i:7.: st on its passage during the current ses-
 sion. This         the timetable has led angry
 Scottish and Welsh nationalists to threaten to
 bring down the government.
 Wilson claims that he is still committed to a
 measure of self-government for regionally
 elected assemblies in Scotland and Wales, but he
 wants to ensure that such a momentous con-
 stitutional change will not be enacted without a
 public debate on its implications. Actually, the
 Frime Minister has probably sensed the hostile
 mood of Parliament.
 Wilson, a master of political compromise, is
 trying to accommodate conflicting concerns:
 those who fear that devolution will only whet
 Scottish appetites and lead to the ultimate dis-
 solution of the United Kindgom, and those who

 fear that without devolution separatism will only
 grow and lead to the splitting off of Scotland.
 There are divisions in the Labor cabinet as
 well as on the government backbenches over
 COMMUNIST CONFERENCE LURCHES ON
 Another snag has been hit in the
 preparations for the already much-delayed
 European Communist conference. The
 meeting in East Berlin on November 17-19 that
 was supposed to have completed work on the
 concluding conference document and set a
 date for the conference postponed these
 decisions until January.
 The current impasse was reached over two
 key points in the document: the nature of the
 relationship between communist and socialist
 parties and the nature of the relationship
 between the countries of Western Europe,
 Eastern Europe, and the United States. This
 revival of bickering surprised many of the
 delegations at the Berlin meeting, and the
 Italians, for their part, ascribed it to a feeling
 among the Soviets and loyal East Europeans
 that too many concessions had been made and
 that perhaps the conference project may be
 getting out of control.
 As things stand now, an editorial working
 group will convene in East Berlin in
 mid-December to continue work on the final
 document. Such meetings have been held with
 less publicity than those of the full editorial
 committee and have been the forum for sharp
 conflicts in the past. For this reason the target
 date of mid-January for wrapping up the detail=
 appears overly optimistic. Even with smooth
 sailing in the preparations over the next two
 months, the Soviets will be hard pressed to
 meet their target of convening the conference
 before their party congress  in February.
 how much power should he devolved. Despite
 this internal opposition, Wilson cannot abandon
 the party's pledge entirely because such a move
 would risk antagonizing those Scottish and Welsh
 voters upon whom Labor depends so heavily.
 Slippage in support for home rule has been
 even greater among the Conservatives, who
 usually do not run well in Scottish and Welsh dis-
 tricts and thus have less to lose by alienating
 nationalists in those areas. The Tories have been
 pledged to home rule since 1968, but opinion in
 the party has shifted considerably since then. Par-
 ty leader Thatcher is known to be lukewarm
 toward devolution and looking for ways to water
 down the government's bill.
 While the delay may be welcome to English
 members of Parliament, the Scots and the Welsh
 see Wilson's move as a sign that Westminster does
 not want to cede genuine home rule powers. The
 government's action clearly increases the
 possibility that nationalist members of Parliament
 may join with the Tories to defeat the government
 and force an early election. Given the almost uni-
 formly negative reaction in Scotland to the
 delay, the Scottish Nationalist Party would almost
 certainly increase its standing at Westminster
 should an election be held soon.
 The pivotal unknown is the Conservative at-
 titude toward an early election. The Tories have
 not yet fully recovered from two straight election
 defeats and a party leadership battle. Tory leader
 Margaret Thatcher has recently strengthened her
 position, but the party is in bad financial condi-
 tion and there are many weak performers in the
 shadow cabinet. In addition, the Conservatives
 are only beginning to develop a program that will
 offer an attractive alternative to those indepen-
 dent voters whose support is necessary for a Tory
 election victory.
 While there are few signs that the Tories are
 willing to go to the polls soon, the opposition par-
 ties could effectively obstruct the government's
 legislative program through nuisance tactics dur-
 ing the all important committee stage of the
 parliamentary  process.

 USSR: CENTRAL COMMITTEE TO MEET
 General Secretary Brezhnev
 With less than three months to go before the
 Soviet party congress in February, the Central
 Committee meeting next Monday will probably
 shed some light on politics in Moscow. No agen-
 da has been announced, but the one-day plenum
 will divide its time between current business and
 preparations for the congress.
 The Central Committee members will hear a
 report on leadership activity since the last plenum
 in April and discuss next year's economic plan
 and budget-subjects to be taken up at the ses-
 sion of the Supreme Soviet that opens on
 December 2. The leadership report may be rather
 somber on both foreign and domestic affairs. In
 foreign affairs, the Soviets have suffered setbacks
 in the Middle East and they have apparently been
 put off by the aggressive response in the West to
 CSCE. Prospects for a new SALT agreement and a
 Washington summit before the party congress are
 significantly diminished, and the difficulties en-
 countered in trying to convene a conference of
 European  communist  parties are probably a
 source of embarrassment.
 The poor performance of Soviet agriculture
 this year and indications that the spring harvest
 may already be in trouble will have a dispiriting
 effect at the plenum. The shortfalls in agriculture
 will spotlight the failure to meet the overall goals
 of the consumer program. The discussion of the
 economic plan and budget may give some indica-

 tion of how the leadership intends to handle
 problems in these areas over the next year. It
 should also suggest some priorities for the next
 five-year plan.
 Most attention, however, will focus on
 preparations for the party congress. The Central
 Committee is expected to announce the agenda
 and speakers for the February conclave, thus
 providing some meaningful evidence on the sub-
 ject of leadership change. In addition, the plenum
 may take action to fill some slots, such as party
 secretary for culture, that have been vacant for
 some time.
 The relative stability of the Central Com-
 mittee since the last congress argues for continui-
 ty at the top. No patterns have emerged in per-
 sonnel changes that either strongly favor or
 detract from one or another leader. The local and
 regional party elections that precede the congress
 are moving along on schedule.
 Despite policy difficulties and the advanced
 age of several senior leaders, the plenum is likely
 to be content with leaving the basic features of
 foreign and domestic policies and their executors
 intact.
 USSR: MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT
 We now expect the Soviet hard-currency
 trade deficit in 1975 to be close to $5 billion. A
 weak gold market this fall has forced Moscow to
 borrow heavily in Western money markets, and
 the Soviets are already lining up credits for 1976. If
 Soviet exports continue to be sluggish, Moscow
 may be forced to trim imports at some point next
 year.
 The USSR has continued to increase imports
 at a time when growth in its exports has been
 limited by recession in the West. Total imports for
 1975 are estimated at $12.8 billion. In the first nine
 months of 1975, imports from its six major
 Western trading partners were running 58 per-
 cent above last year. Imports of machinery and
 equipment are up about 70 percent over last
 year's $2.3 billion, and may reach $4 billion in
 1975.  Imports of grain  will  be about $1
 billion-roughly double the 1974 figure. Steel
 purchases may also reach record levels.
 Soviet hard currency exports will probably
 rise by no more than 5 percent, to an estimated
 $8.1  billion.  Exports to its six major Western
 trading partners in the first eight months of this
 year were down 6 percent from the same period
 last year. We expect a considerable rise in the
 final four months because of reduced Soviet
 prices on diamonds, platinum, and palladium,
 among others; stepped-up exports of Soviet oil;
 and the gradual revival in economic activity in the
 West.
 The USSR will finance its 1975 deficit through
 a combination of Western credits, gold sales,
 revenues from shipping and tourism, and a
 probable reduction in foreign exchange holdings.
 Arms sales should provide substantial earnings
 this year-perhaps $300 million in hard currency.
 The USSR may earn about $1 billion from
 gold sales in 1975. Confirmed and rumored sales
 through July totaled 125 tons, valued at roughly
 $675 million. We believe that Moscow continued
 to sell gold in August-perhaps 20 tons worth
 $100 million. Sales were probably small in
 September as gold prices plunged. The USSR may
 have re-entered the market in October when
 prices partially recovered and appeared to
 stabilize at approximately $145 per troy ounce.
 Sales of 20 tons per month in the last quarter, a
 reasonable  prospect,  would yield Moscow
 another $275 million.
 Borrowing from the West
 From $2.5 billion to $3 billion of the hard-
 currency deficit will probably be financed by a
 combination of Soviet borrowing in the West and
 a reduction in foreign exchange holdings. The
 USSR appears to have secured adequate financing
 to meet this year's obligations.
 ?  By June, the USSR had drawn down
 $360 million of the $1.3 billion deposited in
 London as of January 1.

 ?  Medium- and long-term credits ex-
 tended in earlier years are covering a major
 share of Soviet imports of Western capital
 goods and large diameter pipe. Drawings
 should exceed $2.5 billion in 1975, yielding
 more than $1.66 billion in net credits.
 ?  Early in 1975, Moscow arranged for
 three five-year loans from Western banking
 consortiums, totaling $400 million.
 ?  The Soviets have arranged for ad-
 ditional bank-to-bank credits in Europe and
 Soviet efforts to raise loans in Europe and in
 the US have shown a marked upswing since
 midyear. These efforts are probably geared
 toward meeting  next  year's  anticipated
 obligations.  Grain  imports, judging from
 purchases already consummated or anticipated,
 will amount to between $3 and $4 billion in 1976.
 Increasing Exports
 The size of the 1976 deficit will depend large-
 ly upon the ability of the Soviet Union to
 stimulate hard-currency exports to the West. Re-
 cent discussions presage an increase in Soviet oil
 exports in 1976, and signed contracts call for a
 sizable increase in Soviet natural gas deliveries to
 Western Europe. Moscow can also be expected to
 intensify current efforts to boost export earnings
 by shaving  prices and pressuring Western
 governments to correct current trade imbalances.
 Use of Eurocurrency borrowing for grain
 purchases may reduce Soviet access to the
 Eurocurrency market to finance capital goods
 purchases. Moscow may be forced to pay higher
 rates for Eurocurrency loans and to be more
 selective in its Eurodollar borrowing for this pur-
 pose. As a result, Moscow may push for even
 larger commitments from Western governments
 for subsidized credit lines to cover Soviet
 purchases in 1976-80.
 Soviet medium- and long-term debt will
 grow substantially during 1975-76 as a result of the
 Soviet timber for export
 massive borrowing-perhaps to more than $7
 billion by the end of 1975 and to nearly $10 billion
 by the end of 1976. If exports prove weak and the
 USSR incurs another large trade deficit in 1976,
 the leadership will face unpleasant alternatives
 such as a possible cutback of imports, a delay in
 delivery schedules for equipment already
 ordered and not covered by long-term credit, and
 a cutback in capital goods orders re uirin    h
 payment.

 CUBA-US: HAVANA LOSES INTEREST
 Havana's interest in improving relations with
 Washington   seems   to   have   diminished
 somewhat, but Castro reportedly still believes that
 reconciliation would bring important benefits to
 Cuba.
 Since late 1974 there have been various signs
 of Cuba's wanting to begin the process of nor-
 malizing relations with the US. Several factors,
 however, suggest there are unlikely to be any
 major moves in that direction from Havana in the
 next several months.

 tions on trade with Cuba has reduced to
 some extent  i1he economic pressure for
 reconciliation.

 the Popular Movement for the Liberation of
 Angola despite an expected negative US
 reaction.
 ?  Pressure from Moscow for better
 relations between Cuba and the US appears
 to have lessened.
 ?  The Cuban Communist Party' first
 conference next month is likely to include
 heightened anti-US rhetoric.
 ?  Panamanian President Torrijos, dur-
 ing his visit to Havana in January, will almost
 certainly be given vocal Cuban support on
 the canal issue.
 ?  The Cubans have reacted defensive-
 ly to strong US statements on the Puerto
 Rican issue.
 the  Havana conterence on  Puerto Rican  in-
 dependence in early September derailed, at least

 PANAMA: SLOW GOING IN CANAL TALKS
 The session that opened in Panama last week
 received none of the fanfare that preceded US
 Ambassador Bunker's arrival for the September
 session, reflecting a clear expectation by Panama-
 nian officialdom that this round will yield little.
 25X1
 Official indications that Bunker's visit would
 receive only routine public notice have been
 borne out by the restrained press coverage and
 the absence of statements by government
 spokesmen. The one exception was a negotiation
 adviser's charge in Mexico last week that the US
 has deliberately jammed the negotiations and is
 seeking Torrijos' overthrow. This was privately
 disclaimed by Panamanian chief negotiator Juan
 Tack, who told US officials the adviser had
 departed from established guidance.
 25X1     25X1
 The advance publicity given Bunker's
 September visit generated unfulfilled expec-
 tations of a breakthrough in the negotiations. By
 contrast, the press this month has virtually ig-
 nored several changes announced in US Canal
 Zone practices that might have been portrayed as
 indicating a more forthcoming US position. The
 changes include reducing the number of security
 positions and thereby opening more jobs to
 Panamanians,  integrating  the  Latin  American
 schools in the zone into the American system, and
 providing for equal competition for housing
 without regard to nationality.
 Panamanian spokesmen and the controlled
 press have been increasingly blunt in making the
 point that they expect little progress until after
 the US elections in 1976, believing that political
 considerations will prevent US compromise on
 sensitive treaty issues. The Panamanians may well
 see the current round not as a time for com-
 promise but for hammering away at their major
 points-whose central aim is an end to the US
 presence by the end of the century.

 GUATEMALA-BELIZE: THE UN VOTE
 Guatemalan officials are taking the UN vote
 on Belize in stride. Soon after the UK-Caribbean
 sponsored resolution passed overwhelmingly in
 the UN committee on trusteeships last Friday, the
 government announced that it will simply refuse
 to heed it. Officials said the resolution, which call-
 ed for Belizean independence, self-determina-
 tion, and territorial integrity, was no more than a
 "recommendation" and had no legal force. Until
 recent weeks, Guatemala had been threatening to
 use military force against Belize if the UN ap-
 proved a "humiliating" resolution.
 The Guatemalans have not yet responded to
 the British offer to resume negotiations early next
 year. Negotiations will be difficult for them so
 soon after the defeat in the UN. Guatemala may
 next try to get the Organization of American
 States or the International Court of justice to con-
 sider the matter.
 The press in Guatemala, meanwhile, has
 begun a search for scapegoats. Its targets are
 Foreign Minister Molina and his colleagues. They
 are being criticized for not anticipating that Mex-
 ico would reassert its long-dormant claim to the
 top part of Belize and for inadequately presenting
 Guatemala's  argument  in  the  UN.

 AUSTRALIA: CAMPAIGN ISSUES
 The latest polls show public opinion about
 equally divided between the two major parties.
 The outcome of the national elections on
 December 13 will probably be determined by the
 reactions of swing voters to two leading issues:
 the state of the economy and the controversy
 over the constitutional powers of the Senate and
 the Governor General. Foreign policy questions
 are receiving relatively little attention, and it is
 unlikely that there will be any significant
 short-term effects on Australia's relations with the
 US. The somewhat more independent posture in
 world affairs that emerged over the list three
 years under the W:iitlam government would
 probably be retwied by a new Liberal-Country
 administration.
 The differences over domestic policies and
 the administrative capacities of the rival parties
 are probably not as important as the long-term
 effects of the manner in which the election was
 forced-the Governor General's unprecedented
 dismissal of Prime Minister Whitlam. Labor Party
 leaders and the rank and file have been deeply
 embittered by what they regard as the improper
 tactics of the Liberal-Country coalition and the
 Governor General.
 It was Whitlam's avowed aim to make the
 constitutional issue of his ouster from office "the
 great issue, almost the sole issue" of the cam-
 paign. He and his supporters have been placing
 heavy emphasis on the alleged threat to political
 stability  from the recent maneuvers of
 Liberal-Country party leaders as well as on the
 constitutional impropriety of the present
 Liberal-Country government.
 Right now, these themes seem to be having
 considerable impact among the swing voters. The
 impact is wearing off, however, and, as the
 Liberal-Country candidates aim their fire at
 Labor's mismanagement of the economy,
 Laborites are concluding that they cannot avoid
 addressing the economic issues.
 The state of the economy is Labor's greatest
 liability and gives the Liberal-Country coalition its
 strongest argument that a change  s needed.
 When Labor first took over in December 1972, the
 Australian  economy was  riding  high. Now
 Australia is suffering from a very serious inflation,
 the highest unemployment since the depression
 of the 1930s, and a record budget deficit.
 The main question is whether the swing
 voters will hold the Laborites responsible for the
 economic decline. Caretaker Prime Minister
 Fraser and his allies are blaming the Whitlam
 cabinet for driving off new foreign capital,
 destroying business confidence, and generally
 mishandling the administration of the economy.
 Fraser, using government figures to back his
 claims, is charging that under a new Labor
 government the national deficit, inflation, and
 unemployment will become far worse than
 anyone had forecast.
 Labor is responding that the economy was in-
 evitably the victim of international pressures that
 have damaged many other economies as well,
 that Labor had been coping effectively, and that
 recovery was well on the way at the time of
 Whitlam's ouster. The most recent budget
 presented by the last Labor cabinet is regarded by
 economists as sound and not providing an easy
 target. Major changes in fiscal polic;; by a
 Liberal-Country government are unlikely, and the
 main justification for a change to Liberal-Country
 management of the economy would not be a
 greatly different budget but possibly a better
 team of managers implementing the budget.
 While both contenders attempt to steer
 debate to the most favorable issues, neither can
 be sure of voter attitudes in the wake of the tur-
 bulent political scene of the past several weeks.
 Labor has taken heart, however, from the latest
 public opinion polls placing it about even with

 the Liberal-Country coalition, a dramatic recovery
 from the 30 percent lead accorded the coalition
 last July.
 A Labor defeat in the elections will generate a
 strong reaction in the labor movement that
 could:
 ?  prompt  widespread  strikes and
 violence;
 ?  weaken the authority of moderate
 party leaders and enhance the strength of
 the leftists within the labor movement; and
 ?  deepen class divisions within
 Australian society and in labor-management
 relations.
 Regardless of the outcome, the way the elec-
 tions were forced will leave a long-term legacy of
 vindictiveness and hostility that will inevitably
 affect the atmosphere of Australian politics and
 confront the next government with greater dif-
 ficulties in overcoming intractable economic
 problems.
 LAOS-THAILAND: BORDER CLASH
 A border clash along the Mekong has added
 to the already strained relations between
 Bangkok and Vientiane.
 Pathet Lao forces badly damaged a Thai
 patrol boat, killed a Thai sailor, and wounded
 several others during the clash which began on
 November 17. Thai troops, tanks, and artillery
 were sent to the scene, and Thai aircraft provided
 cover during nine hours of skirmishing as Thai
 forces attempted to recover the body and patrol
 craft. The Lao also moved reinforcements, in-
 cluding tanks, to the area.
 Clashes along the Mekong began in late 1972
 when the first communist troops reached the
 banks of the river. Incidents have increased in
 number and intensity since the collapse of the Lao
 coalition government last string. Over 40 clashes
 have been reported since last April, but no
 casualties occurred until October 9 when five Lao
 were killed.
 Several factors besides mutual antagonism
 contribute to the trouble:
 ?  Pathet Lao troops are cocky and
 belligerent, ready for any real or imagined
 intrusion into their territory.
 ?  A series of old Franco-Thai
 agreements gives the navigable channel in
 most areas to the Lao, but Thai commercial
 and naval craft have always used these
 waters fairly freely.
 ?  Thai troops have for years been
 engaged in smuggling in some areas, and
 discipline has long been a problem.
 In the past, the Thai government has tried to
 play down the significance of the skirmishing
 along the Mekong, but this time Bangkok
 ordered its ambassador to Laos home "for con-
 sultations" and has closed the border opposite
 the Vientiane area to all travel and transit of
 goods. If the border is closed long, it would have
 considerable impact. Vientiane depends on tran-
 sit across Thailand for its fuel and much of its
 food. Bangkok has also renewed calls for
 high-level talks to resolve border problems.
 The Lao have rejected all Thai calls for
 negotiations on the Mekong problem and in
 numerous propaganda blasts have blamed the
 Thai for all incidents. On November 26, however,
 the Lao moved to ease tensions by announcing a
 willingness to allow the Thai to retrieve a patrol
 boat which had been beached on a small island
 following the skirmishes of November 17-18. The
 Lao probably expect that the Thai will reciprocate
 by reopening the border.

 CHINA.
 The visit of Burma's President Ne Win to Pek-
 ing last week brings into focus China's new
 emphasis on improving economic relations and
 enhancing its political position with its Asian
 neighbors. The Burmese President, on his first
 visit to China in five years, reportedly negotiated
 new Chinese support for Burma's hard pressed
 economy. Over the past two years, Peking has
 concluded initial economic agreements with
 Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand and is
 providing continuing support tr, Cambodia and
 Laos.
 The bulk of the Chinese aid program,
 however, is directed toward Africa. From 1970 to
 1975, China pledged two thirds of its $2.7-billion
 aid total to African countries. A $400-million
 credit for the Tan-Zam railroad gave Tanzania and
 Zambia first and second rank among Chinese
 clients after 1969. South Asia, principally through
 pledges to Pakistan, has claimed an additional 20
 percent of Chinese comni'tments, trailed by the
 Near East, with 10 percent. China began a small
 effort in Latin America in 15'71, but has done little
 to implement the agreemer ts.
 In 1970, Peking abandoned its ideological
 criteria fo: support, i.e., that the rec'pients must
 be leftist oriented, and began seeking a broader
 economic role among Third-World countries. In
 that year, Peking pledged more than $700 million
 in new aid, a record commitment almost ten times
 larger than average annual aid in previous years.
 Despite its modest size, Chinese economic
 assistance has carved a niche for Peking in the
 global aid scheme of things. Although deliveries
 under the program have averaged only about

 $165 million arnually over the past five years,
 comparable to the efforts of Belgium and the
 Netherlands, China's aid has been highly visible
 and has had considerable impact. The image of
 China's support to Africa is one that few major
 powers are effectively challenging. China has
 gained stature among developing countries by
 focusing on countries where China's skills and
 technology are applicable, by offering a carefully
 supported aid package, and by providing low
 cost, quick return projects on easy payment
 terms.
 China's development  assistance  provides
 easily perceived benefits in a short time. Profiting
 from its own postwar experiences, China has
 emphasized  labor-intensive agricultural,
 transportation, and light-industry projects that
 require minimum skills for construction and
 operation. Plants, such as textile, plywood, paper,
 and food-processing facilities are built at low cost
 and put into production rapidly.
 China compensates for shortages of loca!
 funds and skills as part of its assistance package.
 Peking provides commodities to finance local
 construction costs and administrators, skilled per-
 sonnel, and large numbers of unskilled laborers
 to carry out construction.
 Peking's aid terms are far more attractive than
 those of other Communist donors, approaching
 those offered by the West. Grants account for
 about 15 percent of the total, compared with less
 than 2 percent in other Communist programs.
 China also has provided the equivalent of $1
 billion in free technical services to development
 projects.
 China's aid program has been quite
 successful. African countries are quick to praise
 the economic contributions of Chinese projects,
 which provide employment for large numbers of
 local workers and whose output often consists of
 products formerly imported for hard currency.
 For China, international political gains have loom-
 ed large in proportion to actual expenditures for
 aid. China's economic importance among poorer  25X1
 countries will continue to grow as it carries out
 projects under the $2.4 billion of :iid still in the
 pipeline.
 In a reversal of his position during the
 Cultural Revolution of the mid 1960s, Chairman
 Mao has apparently endorsed changes in the
 educational system that would raise the level of
 academic training in China's universities. The
 educational policies of the Cultural Revolution,
 which were staunchly defended by the party's left
 wing, put primary emphasis on politics rather
 than scholastic achievement and rendered the
 universities virtually ineffective. Mao's turnabout
 on educational policy is the latest and most startl-
 ing confirmation that he has backed off from
 some of his earlier visionary ideas and that the
 party's left wing is currently in eclipse.
 According to a document circulating in
 China, in June Mao called for more study of basic

 scientific theory and warner students, who have
 frequently disrupted classroom activity with
 political diatribes, to listen to their teachers rather
 than waste time stating their own opinions. The
 Chairman reportedly asked China's intellectuals,
 who have long been cowed by attacks from party
 leftists, to help improve the university curriculum.
 This renewed concern for academic quality ' in
 line with China's drive to modernize the
 economy by the end of the century.
 Possibly emboldened by Mao's show of sup-
 port for the new educational policies, the minister
 of education made a speech in September strong-
 ly criticizing the educational policies of the
 Cultural Revolution. The minister echoed Mao's
 call for more study of scientific theory and claim-
 ed that university students, who ideally should be
 both "red" (thoroughly familiar with communist
 doctrine) and "expert," currently are neither. He
 specifically criticized Peking University, which
 allegedly had been above reproach because it was
 a favorite of Madame Mao, for failing to educate
 its students properly.
 As a result of the minister's speech, Peking
 and Tsinghua universities, two of China's best, an-
 nounced  that current curriculums will  be
 revamped, that science and research will be
 emphasized, and that entering students will be
 required to take examinations. Entrance ex-
 aminations have been a particularly contentious
 issue since 1973, when a coalition of party leftists
 and some military men opposed their use and
 forced Peking to put less emphasis on them.
 China's intellectuals reportedly have been
 reluctant to help the universities raise their stan-
 dards for fear that educational policy will suffer
 yet another reversal. Perhaps in response to this
 hesitation, propagandz from Shanghai, which has
 often been in the forefront in promoting new
 policies, has emphasized that there is nothing
 politically wrong with concentrating on academic
 training.
 Although Premier Chou En-lai complained as
 early as last January that the current educational
 system is inadequate for China's economic needs,
 apparently no progress was made until Mao's ap-
 proval for changes became known. The Chair-
 man's recent statements on education, his first
 since the Cultural Revolution, have been the mis-
 sing ingredient in the long-standing efforts of
 people like Chou En-lai and Teng Hsiao-ping to
 improve the educational system as the first step
 technology.
 MALAYSIA: POWER PLAY
 The arrest this week of Prime Minister
 Razak's chief political rival, Datuk Harun Idris, on
 corruption charges could disrupt the normally
 tranquil political scene in Malaysia. Harun forced
 the government's hand by rejecting political exile
 as Malaysia's UN representative, and he hay
 privately threatened to expose corrupt practices
 by Razak and his cabinet colleagues.
 Free on bail until the case is brought to court
 on January 12, Harun says he welcomes a public
 airing of the charges against him. As head of the
 youth movement of the ruling United Malays
 National Organization and chief minister of pop-
 ulous Selangor State that surrounds Kuala Lum-
 pur,                                                             Harun  has an  important independent
 political base from which to defy Razak. Harun
 has also built a popular following by championing
 narrow Malay interests and relaying on an-
 ti-Chinese feeling within the Malay community.
 He has for years complicated Razak's efforts to
 keep Malaysia's communal problems in balance.
 Harun, a hero to many less sophisticated Malays,
 is suspected of having played a role in fomenting
 the destructive anti-Chinese communal riots in
 1969.
 The government feels it has solid evidence of
 Harun's misappropriation of party funds and that
 this will erode his support within the party
 organization. Even if the government eventual'y
 wins its case, however, Harun's expected
 countercharges may cause serious strains within
 the government hierarchy.
 Militant Malays from the party's youth wing
 are reportedly planning demonstrations in sup-
 port of Harun, and some 400 of Harun's hard-core
 supporters are believed to have already entered
 Kuala Lumpur. Street disorders by these Malay
 militants could bring ever-present Malay-Chinese
 tensions to a flashpoint, and Razak has put inter-
 nal security forces on alert.
