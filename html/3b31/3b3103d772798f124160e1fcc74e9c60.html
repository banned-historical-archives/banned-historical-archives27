 KEY JUDGMENTS
 Taiwan enters the 1980s with favorable odds for maintaining a
 high degree of continuity with the past. The prospects for political
 stability and economic prosperity three to five years from now depend
 on how Taipei moves to solve the interlocking problems of:
 - Sustaining economic growth despite increasing protectionism,
 competition, and rising energy costs.
 - Maintaining military defenses against China.
 - Arranging a smooth succession to 70-year-old President Chiang
 Ching-kuo.
 - Meeting increasing pressure from native Taiwanese for a greater
 share in effective political power.
 - Maintaining domestic and investor confidence in the future of
 Taiwan.
 - Shaping the nature of Taiwan's relationship with China and the
 United States.
 Normalization of Sino-US relations has altered the framework
 within which these problems will be faced. Relations with the United
 States are likely to remain central to Taiwan's foreign policy. In the
 midterm period of three to five years, the United States will remain the
 major source of modern arms and military equipment, nuclear power
 equipment, technology, and enriched fuel, and it will be the island's
 leading economic partner. Still, Taiwan will attempt to reduce its
 dependence on the United States in these areas by expanding its mar-
 kets, seeking arms and nuclear imports elsewhere and striving for self-
 sufficiency.
 Taipei's satisfaction with the continuation of extensive, substantive
 relations with the United States coexists uneasily with a view that US
 power in international affairs has declined and with reduced confidence
 that, in the long run, the United States will remain cognizant of Tai-
 wan's interests. As a result, there is an increasing feeling in Taipei that
 more than ever Taiwan is on its own.
 Note: This Interagency Intelligence Memorandum was produced under the auspices of the National
 Intelligence Officer for East Asia. It was drafted by               the East Asia-Pacific Division of the
 Office of Political Analysis, National Foreign Assessment Center, Central Intelligence Agency. The Memo-
 randum was coordinated with the intelligence components of the Departments of State and Defense and
 within the National Foreign Assessment Center. Information available through January 1981 was used.

 This concern is unlikely, however, to lead to a major opening to-
 ward the USSR in the midterm, despite Taiwan's efforts to broaden
 economic contacts with Eastern Europe. Chiang Ching-kuo opposes
 turning toward Moscow-a move which might damage relations with
 Washington, outrage Beijing, and alarm Taiwan's neighbors in South-
 east Asia and the Western Pacific.
 Increased stress on self-reliance is likely to have a mixed effect on
 Taiwan's largely inactive nuclear weapons development program. Some
 military and civilian officials hope eventually to reactivate the program,
 but concern over the adverse effect this would have on Taiwan-US
 relations will continue to act as a powerful deterrent.
 The leadership in Taipei also appears to be reexamining the is-
 land's future vis-a-vis China. In the past year or two Taiwan has
 adopted more flexible, pragmatic policies, for example, permitting a
 dramatic increase in indirect trade with China. But there has been no
 softening in Taipei's refusal to engage in negotiations with China.
 Movement toward some kind of accommodation with Beijing may
 be possible in the midterm. Governments in Taipei and Beijing share
 certain interests: both assert Taiwan is part of China, thus precluding an
 independent Taiwan; both promote the island's economic prosperity,
 desire political stability, and indicate wariness over Taiwanese demands
 for a greater share of political power; and neither wants Soviet med-
 dling in the "Taiwan question."
 Beijing has outlined a position on reunification that offers substan-
 tial autonomy for Taiwan under Chinese sovereignty, but not under
 Chinese administration.
 Beijing is unlikely in the midterm to abandon a policy of peaceful
 reunification, but there is a growing sense of urgency over the need to
 make some progress. China fears that the death of Chiang Ching-kuo
 could leave a successor Kuomintang (KMT) regime that might fragment
 or that might have a limited popular base. A weakened, insecure succes-
 sor might feel unable or unwilling to bargain with Beijing.
 President Chiang has not groomed a successor, relying instead on
 institutional arrangements. So far the locus of political power in the
 post-Chiang period appears uncertain and may shift, becoming frag-
 mented among institutions and individuals. There are signs, however,
 that maneuvering for position among potential successors has begun.
 Deterioration in relations between China and the United States
 might result in a tougher Chinese stance toward Taiwan, particularly if

 Washington unilaterally abrogated agreements on Taiwan reached in
 late 1978 or if Taiwan became a contentious issue in Chinese politics.
 Developments that reinforce the KMT view that moves toward
 accommodation with the mainland are not required could also result in
 a hardened Chinese position on reunification as well as serious Sino-US
 bilateral problems.
 A KMT move toward political association with China could easily
 provoke an uprising among Taiwanese. When combined with Tai-
 wanese pressure for political reform, their perception that the KMT was
 preserving its political future by selling out to Beijing could be politi-
 cally explosive.
 Although Taiwan's economic future appears relatively secure in
 the midterm, problems of inflation due to soaring energy costs, increas-
 ing protectionism in foreign markets, increasing competition, and un-
 certainty in traditional export markets could further slow the economic
 growth that has been so important in limiting political unrest.
 The most likely goal, because it would be the least destabilizing,
 probably would be maintenance by the KMT of the status quo along
 with cosmetic changes to meet Taiwanese pressure for political reform
 and with a glacially slow increase in contacts with the mainland. Taipei
 would do its utmost to maintain its identity as a de facto independent
 entity, but could tacitly acknowledge a special relationship with the
 mainland. This might avoid provoking a militant reaction on Taiwan,
 receive acquiescence from middle class people and businessmen of the
 island-who seek economic security and political stability-and isolate
 the more militant advocates of Taiwan independence.

 DISCUSSION
 Surviving Normalization
 1. Nearly two years after the reestablishment of
 Sino-US relations, Taiwan has survived with its eco-
 nomic prosperity intact and the island's political stabil-
 ity and security unshaken. The long-awaited shock
 wore off quickly, causing only minor and temporary
 economic perturbations and no widespread popular
 loss of confidence in the island's future as an interna-
 tional entity. There has been no unusual population or
 capital exodus from Taiwan. The island has retained
 its appeal for foreign investment, which was as strong
 as ever in 1979-the first full year after normalization
 in Sino-US relations.
 2. Contributing to public confidence on the island
 were the Taipei government's handling of the crisis,
 the prospect of continued substantive ties to the
 United States, and the absence of military tension with
 China. The early passage of the US-Taiwan Relations
 Act-although no substitute in Taipei's eyes for full
 diplomatic relations-was reassuring by providing un-
 official continuation of relations, by indicating contin-
 ued US interest in the island's security and a peaceful
 resolution of Taiwan's relationship with Beijing, and
 by providing continued access to US military equip-
 ment. The resumption of new sales of defensive weap-
 ons in January 1980 and the later announcement that
 the United States will consider sales of the FX fighter
 further reassured Taiwan's leadership.
 3. The successful transition to a new relationship
 with Washington was accompanied, however, by evi-
 dence that Taiwan will be more on its own than be-
 fore. Many on Taiwan are skeptical about the durabil-
 ity of Washington's interest in preserving Taiwan's
 international status. There is concern on Taiwan that
 the US interest in improving relations with China to
 counter Soviet expansionism will make Washington
 susceptible to Chinese suggestions that the United
 States press Taipei into negotiations with Beijing.
 4. Taipei appears to be attempting to steer a course
 that will:
 - Preserve what remains of Taiwan's diplomatic
 relations with other governments.
 - Maintain foreign interest and presence in Taiwan
 by developing substantive, unofficial relations-
 particularly economic-with those nations that
 have no diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
 - Expand Taiwan's foreign trade markets to main-
 tain rapid economic growth by spreading trade
 and investment opportunities and risks.
 - Maintain major economic ties with the United
 States and Japan but limit as much as possible the
 effects on Taiwan of the economic troubles of
 either partner.
 - Continue Taiwan's access to up-to-date US mili-
 tary equipment, while working to limit depend-
 ence on the United States by developing Tai-
 wan's defense industries and seeking other
 sources of military equipment and technology.
 - Maintain access to US nuclear power technology,
 equipment, and fuel while again attempting to
 reduce the political-economic risk by seeking
 other suppliers.
 - Re-examine Taiwan's future relationship with
 China to preserve both Taiwan's sense of identity
 and its ability to deal with a possible evolution
 toward an accommodation with China from as
 strong a position as possible.
 Relations With the United States
 5. In the midterm, relations with Washington are
 likely to remain the keystone of Taiwan's foreign
 policy. New markets and new sources of military and
 nuclear equipment and fuel are unlikely to limit the
 crucial role of the United States in these areas. Exten-
 sive substantive ties with the United States play a
 major role in maintaining the government's self-
 confidence and popular confidence in the govern-
 ment. The KMT government will exploit the relation-
 ship to the utmost, using longstanding relations in the
 US Congress and the Executive Branch to buttress
 other activities. Conversely, it is unlikely that many in
 Taipei envisage any future US administration revert-
 ing to the prenormalization framework of US-Taiwan

 unlikely event that a government on Taiwan turns to-
 ward the USSR, Japan probably would have a mutual
 interest with China and the United States in forestall-
 ing or reversing such a development. In any case,
 Japanese leverage over Taiwan is limited. While US
 investment usually takes the form of capital invest-
 ment, Japanese money usually finances trade, or is
 aimed at earning a quick return, thus limiting risk and
 leverage.
 10. If Japan is likely to be satisfied with the status
 quo on Taiwan and with Taiwan's current position vis-
 a-vis China and the United States, Tokyo also rec-
 ognizes that friction could grow in Tokyo's relations
 with Taipei. A major source of friction would be the
 conflicting claims of Taiwan, China, and Japan to the
 Senkaku Islands. In the midterm, however, all three
 parties may find it more useful to concentrate their
 search for oil in other places, rather than complicate
 their relations by raising this contentious issue.
 A More Flexible Foreign Policy
 11. The continued cultivation of a special relation-
 ship with the United States is aimed at maintaining
 Taiwan's economic development and enhancing its
 economic strength and military self-sufficiency. The
 experience of the past decade has taught Taipei the
 importance of substance in foreign relations over the
 embellishments of diplomatic form. Only 21 govern-
 ments-most of them in Central America and the
 Caribbean-now have diplomatic relations with Tai-
 pei, and a further reduction of diplomatic ties in the
 1980s is likely. The Taiwan authorities hope to pre-
 serve what diplomatic ties they can, substituting sub-
 stantive economic relations where they must.
 12. This emphasis on economic contacts helps Tai-
 wan keep its identity as an international entity and
 retain the prosperity that helps dampen potential
 domestic political problems. Diplomatic relations with
 Saudi Arabia remain important because Saudi Arabia,
 along with Kuwait, provides a major share of resource-
 poor Taiwan's imported petroleum. The authorities in
 Taipei cultivate the Saudis by sending high-level dele-
 gations, assisting the Saudi armed forces
 Relations with South Arica center
 on shared interests in the development of military
 production and technology and of their respective nu-
 clear power industries, as well as a mutual interest in
 6

 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP84B00049R000701970017-5
 relations. Even so, the leaders in Taipei probably will
 continue to invest US-Taiwan relations with as much
 tangible content and degree of 11 officiality" as Wash-
 ington will allow.
 6. A reversal in current US willingness to supply
 Taiwan with selected, defensive armaments would not
 only affect prospects for maintaining a credible deter-
 rent, but would be taken by many on Taiwan as a sign
 that the United States was no longer interested in the
 island's long-range security against China. To those on
 Taiwan, the corollary would be that the United States
 favored the island's reunification with the mainland.
 (For an evaluation of the military balance between
 Taiwan and China, see annex C.)
 The Other Partner-Japan
 7. Although Japan is Taiwan's second largest trade
 partner, largest exporter, and an important source of
 capital, Tokyo currently cannot occupy the key po-
 sition held by the United States in Taiwan's foreign
 affairs. Continued extensive economic ties between
 Taiwan and Japan do not extend into the military and
 security spheres as do relations with the United States.
 Japan does not supply defensive arms to Taiwan. Al-
 though undoubtedly interested in Taiwan's future as it
 might apply to the security of Japan, officials in Tokyo
 have not expressed their views publicly.
 8. From Taiwan's point of view, political ties with
 Japan have been diminishing since normalization of
 Sino-Japanese relations in 1972. Taipei's ability to in-
 fluence Japanese official points of view has steadily
 diminished as its supporters in Japan grow old or come
 to place greater importance on Sino-Japanese relations.
 9. Aside from taking diplomatic or economic action
 to preserve its economic interests in Taiwan, it is un-
 likely that Japan in the midterm wishes to or is in a
 position to decisively influence the island's future,
 particularly from a security point of view. It is un-
 likely that Japan would encourage Taiwan's independ-
 ence or jeopardize Sino-Japanese relations by support-
 ing Taiwan's resistance to reunification with the
 mainland. On the other hand, China's use of force to
 effect reunification would harm Sino-Japanese bi-
 lateral relations, as Tokyo evaluated the effect on re-
 gional stability and the impact on US-Japanese se-
 curity relations. Should Taiwan become politically
 unstable, Japan might attempt to use what economic
 leverage it has to facilitate a return to stability. In the

 avoiding international political isolation. Earlier this
 year Taiwan added to earlier procurement a six-year
 purchase, starting in 1984, of 4,000 tons of natural ura-
 nium. Taiwan has also indicated interest in South Af-
 rica as a potential source of enriched uranium fuel for
 Taiwan's nuclear power program. Despite Taiwan's
 prodding, however, the South Africans apparently
 have not shared nuclear technology with Taiwan.
 The
 natural uranium purchases are important to Taiwan's
 plans to ease its heavy dependence on foreign oil by
 eventually deriving 40 percent of its electric power
 from nuclear sources. South Africa has only limited
 enrichment capacity, however, so that in any event
 Taipei will continue to. depend on the United States or
 Europe for this service.
 13. Whereas Taiwan's deepening relationship with
 the Saudis and South Africans represents an inten-
 sification of prenormalization trends, its increased
 trade and expanding unofficial relations with Western
 Europe are new. Since normalization, total trade with
 Western Europe has increased from $4 billion in 1979
 to a predicted $5 billion in 1980, with Taiwan enjoy-
 ing a projected $1 billion surplus. Unofficial rep-
 resentation on Taiwan from West European nations
 has been increasing. Most European nations either
 have unofficial representation in Taipei or are actively
 interested in obtaining it. Five West European banks
 representing three countries also have offices there.
 14. Western Europe is attractive to Taiwan as an
 additional export market and as a source of technol-
 ogy, such as transport aircraft (the airbus from
 France), nuclear power equipment, and modern mili-
 tary weapons and technology. There are built-in lim-
 its, however, to rapid growth in trade and to Western
 Europe's usefulness as a source of sensitive industrial
 and military equipment and technology. Taiwan's
 large trade surplus and world economic conditions
 may prompt West European nations to raise protec-
 tionist barriers, and most West European governments
 have been cautious about selling Taiwan nuclear or
 military equipment and technology. Efforts by Tai-
 wan to purchase such items have been only partially
 successful, although Taipei is inviting two West Eu-
 ropean firms to bid on two future nuclear power re-
 actors. Over the past two years, Taipei has procured a
 small number of antiaircraft guns from Sweden and
 Switzerland. Efforts to obtain sonars, torpedo boats,
 combat aircraft, tanks, and submarines from other
 West European nations have been largely unsuccess-
 ful. Recently, however, the Netherlands, despite
 strong protests from Beijing, have agreed to build two
 submarines for Taiwan. Expanded economic ties with
 Western Europe might provide a conduit for the im-
 portation of some dual-use technology serving Tai-
 wan's efforts to expand and modernize its military
 industries.
 15. Israel has proved a more fruitful source of
 equipment and technology by supplying the Gabriel
 antiship missile.
 16. Taiwan's efforts to reduce nearly total depend-
 ence on the United States by acquiring nuclear tech-
 nology, fuel, and power-generation equipment from
 Britain, France, Italy, West Germany, or Belgium
 have been fruitless. A high-level nuclear delegation
 from Taiwan returned home emptyhanded after a
 swing through Western Europe in May 1979. In
 November 1979 the West German firm of Kraftwerk
 Union (KWU) offered to provide Taiwan a complete
 nuclear cycle, similar to one promised earlier to Brazil.
 Negotiations on this basis are likely to founder because
 of caution on both sides. Since its Brazilian deal, KWU
 has refrained from selling sensitive technology, such as
 nuclear fuel reprocessing. KWU does, however, use
 the prospect of acquiring such technology as bait to
 arouse interest among prospective foreign purchasers.
 In line with its interest in expanding its sources of nu-
 clear equipment and technology, Taiwan has invited
 West German and French firms to bid on construction
 of reactor units seven and eight in its nuclear power
 program along with the provision of associated fuel.
 US firms may still have an edge in this competition
 and are probably favored by the program's civilian
 managers.
 17. One of the major inhibitions on Taiwan's efforts
 to reduce nuclear dependence on the United States is
 that the bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement with
 Taiwan now provides the only suitable mechanism for
 safeguarding nuclear facilities on Taiwan. France and
 West Germany thus far have shown no interest in a
 separate bilateral agreement with Taiwan for fear of
 alienating China.

 18. Even if Taiwan were successful in limiting its
 dependence on the United States in these two key
 areas, using other sources to expand the island's still-
 limited industrial technological base would take years,
 particularly in the nuclear power industry. Taiwan
 may have greater success in developing a more self-
 sufficient military industry capable of producing anti-
 tank and shipboard cruise missiles, patrol boats, light
 fighter planes, tanks, and artillery. Even here, how-
 ever, progress is likely to be slow, and long-term reli-
 ance on key imported components-mainly from the
 United States-is likely to continue.
 19. Continued heavy reliance on the United States
 as a partner in developing the island's nuclear energy
 program will remain the main stumblingblock to the
 reactivation of nuclear weapons research on Taiwan.
 Taipei's weapons research program has been largely in
 abeyance since 1977. Although some military officers
 and officials-particularly those associated with the
 Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, and
 the Institute for Nuclear Energy Research-wish to
 revive nuclear weapons research, they have been un-
 able to persuade President Chiang that a reactivated
 effort would enhance Taiwan's security enough to off-
 set the severe damage likely to accrue to relations with
 the United States. Nevertheless, there is no sign that
 the authorities in Taipei have completely abandoned
 the nuclear weapons option. Rather, the program re-
 mains in limbo, with emphasis on contingency
 planning.
 20. It is unlikely that the relaxation of restrictions
 on trade with several East European countries will
 profoundly affect Taiwan's international orientation.
 Poland, Hungary, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia
 have shown tentative interest in greater trade, but
 trade with Eastern Europe, although likely to grow, is
 also likely to remain a minuscule part of Taiwan's
 overall foreign trade.
 21. Still less likely in the midterm is a major open-
 ing toward the Soviet Union. President Chiang Ching-
 kuo has consistently refused to consider entering into a
 dialogue with Moscow, partly from personal antipa-
 thy, partly because such a move would complicate his
 policies toward the United States and China. Deng
 Xiaoping has repeatedly avowed that a turn by Tai-
 wan toward the Soviet Union would cause Beijing to
 reconsider its peaceful approach toward reunification.
 22. There are signs of Soviet interest in opening
 trade with Taiwan. Any positive response from Taipei
 is likely to be carefully limited. Although hints of
 improving ties with Moscow might be used to remind
 Beijing and Washington that Taiwan has options other
 than reunification or continued heavy reliance on the
 United States, Taiwan's foreign policy is unlikely to
 move in that direction.
 23. Taiwan's more pragmatic foreign trade policy
 will help expand Taipei's markets but is unlikely to be
 translated into diplomatic support for independence
 from China. It is unlikely that any major foreign gov-
 ernment would recognize a self-proclaimed independ-
 ent Taiwan. What the more pragmatic policies do
 serve is continued acceptance of Taiwan's de facto in-
 dependence as well as enhanced possibilities for
 continued economic prosperity. These efforts would
 help maintain confidence and stability on the island,
 as well as strengthen Taipei's position if it eventually
 were to probe for a new relationship with the
 mainland.
 Internal Unrest
 24. The major threat to Taiwan's stability comes
 from potential domestic political unrest that could af-
 fect the KMT's ability to govern. The potential for
 political instability comes primarily from the split in
 Taiwan's society between the mainlanders who re-
 treated to the island with Chiang Kai-skek and those
 native to the island. Although linked by Chinese cul-
 ture, both groups retain a strong sense of self-identity.
 This self-consciousness is reinforced by language
 differences-despite 30 years of compulsory Mandarin
 training in the schools-and by differing historical
 experiences. Taiwanese have little reason to feel
 closely tied to the mainland. A largely neglected prov-
 ince of the old Qing Empire, the island was under
 Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945. Within two years of
 the restoration of Chinese rule by the KMT, mis-
 government, corruption, and a faltering economy pro-
 voked a spontaneous uprising in February 1947. The
 ensuing suppression, still vividly remembered by
 many Taiwanese, wiped out almost a whole generation
 of local leadership. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 peo-
 ple lost their lives, or disappeared. About 3,000 Tai-
 wanese went into exile to carry on a sporadic, ineffec-
 tual opposition.
 25. The mainlander elite still dominates the island's
 political affairs, commanding positions in the armed
 forces, security services, government ministries, and
 the KMT. Since the early 1970s, concessions have been
 8

 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP84B00049R000701970017-5
 made in response to Taiwanese pressure by bringing
 some Taiwanese into the higher reaches of the political
 structure, including ministerial positions. About one-
 third of the KMT Central Standing Committee elected
 last December is Taiwanese, and a Taiwanese com-
 mands the Eighth Army in the southern port city of
 Kaohsiung.
 26. None of these concessions, however, has altered
 the fact of mainlander rule. President Chiang Ching-
 kuo and his closest advisers, the men who run Taiwan,
 are mainlanders. Their authority is legitimized by the
 myth of return to the mainland and their continued
 claim to be the legitimate government of China, tem-
 porarily residing in the province of Taiwan.
 27. In practical terms the goal of mainland recov-
 ery has been long abandoned. In recent years greater
 propaganda emphasis has been placed on Taiwan as a
 model province whose example will someday inspire
 the people of mainland China to overthrow Com-
 munist rule. The KMT cannot abandon, however, its
 claim to be the legitimate government of China with-
 out bringing into question the right of a small minor-
 ity-15 percent of the population-to govern the
 remaining 85 percent, which is Taiwanese. The impor-
 tance of this claim, along with the mainlander Chinese
 identity of the ruling elite, precludes the KMT govern-
 ment from accepting the concept of Taiwan inde-
 pendence.
 28. The simple dichotomy of mainlander versus
 Taiwanese, however, is not a wholly faithful image of
 the complexities of Taiwan's society or politics. Even
 in 1947 there were many Taiwanese who linked their
 personal fortunes to the KMT and to China. Between
 50 and 80 percent of the KMT membership is Tai-
 wanese. Many of the Taiwanese businessmen who
 dominate the large private sector of the economy have
 a symbiotic relationship with the mainlander-con-
 trolled regime. Three decades of KMT-directed, anti-
 Communist propaganda and education in Chinese na-
 tionalism probably have had some effect in shaping
 the attitudes of younger generations. Certainly support
 for Taiwan independence exists among a number of
 Taiwanese, but its extent is impossible to measure and
 becomes confused with a desire to liberalize the more
 oppressive aspects of KMT rule and open up the sys-
 tem to allow the rise of Taiwanese talent.
 29. Thirty years of nearly unbroken economic
 growth and the concentration of middle and upper
 class Taiwanese on enhancing their personal prosperity
 have muted communal antagonism and diverted Tai-
 wanese energies from politics into business, the pro-
 fessions, and education. Taiwanese concern with
 maintaining and improving the standard of living-
 which is far above that of mainland China-has
 tended to reinforce KMT efforts to maintain the status
 quo at home and to resist political and military pres-
 sure from the mainland for reunification.
 30. Although the majority of working and middle-
 class Taiwanese do not appear to be highly politicized,
 eight Taiwanese oppositionists in their thirties or early
 forties were sentenced to prison in April 1980 for
 fomenting the antigovernment riot in Kaohsiung in
 late 1979. They are part of a growing, better-educated
 Taiwanese middle class, which may feel its lack of
 political influence more keenly than its elders.
 31. "Taiwanization" of the legislative branch of the
 government, the civil service, and the lower reaches of
 the KMT will increase sharply during the 1980s as el-
 derly mainlanders die or retire. If not forestalled by
 second-generation mainlanders, this trend could leave
 the Taiwanese in control of local government, national
 parliamentary bodies, and with a larger share of KMT
 membership. Such a development might temporarily
 mollify moderate Taiwanese by bringing them into
 greater participation in the political system, but it is
 equally likely that it will whet Taiwanese appetites for
 greater political power.  Moreover,  with creeping
 Taiwanization,  the  validity  of  the  concept  of
 mainlander control of the KMT government will come
 increasingly into question. In addition, increasing
 Taiwanization of the KMT would raise the possibility
 of a slow takeover from within by "KMT" Taiwanese
 with no interest in political reunification with the
 mainland.
 Chiang Ching-kuo, the KMT, and Reform
 32. Starting in the early 1970s, before becoming
 President, Chiang Ching-kuo-in league with the
 more reformist, liberal elements in the Kuomintang-
 instituted a cautious liberalization of the political sys-
 tem. In part this effort represented Chiang's attempt
 to carve out his own constituency and points of view
 within the KMT in preparation for his succession to
 power. In part, however, it also represented an at-
 tempt to come to grips with an aging political elite
 whose politically conservative ideas appeared ill-suited
 9
 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP84B00049R000701970017-5
 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP84B00049R000701970017-5
 to meet the changes occurring in Taiwan's society and
 international status. As a result of Chiang's efforts, un-
 precedented numbers of Taiwanese were brought into
 political office. Many moderate Taiwanese reformist
 politicians, including some who later became anti-
 KMT, came to regard Chiang as a moderate reformist
 whose interests were compatible with those of the
 Taiwanese.
 33. To effect his reforms, Chiang enforced anti-
 corruption laws, called on the services of technocrats
 in government rather than party hacks, and stressed a
 government bound by its own laws, rather than en-
 tirely relying on arbitrary action.
 34. Chiang attempted to reinvigorate and reform
 the KMT, though with only limited success. The party
 remained filled with personnel who could perform no
 other jobs. It failed to attract many of the most ca-
 pable younger men, who chose to enter the pro-
 fessions, the government bureaucracy, or business. At
 the grassroots many party members remained en-
 trenched within their local political alliances. They
 were suspicious of reform and enforced it half-
 heartedly.
 35. One aspect of the party structure that Chiang
 Ching-kuo had no intention of reforming was the cen-
 tralization of final decisionmaking in the hands of the
 party leader. The structure of the KMT, patterned
 after that of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,
 tends to concentrate authority at the top.
 36. The KMT, however, is only one of several in-
 stitutions, and not the most powerful, that President
 Chiang uses to govern. Decisions by the KMT bureauc-
 racy are often overridden by other government or-
 ganizations. For example, the opposition of some party
 bureaucrats to the crackdown on the non-KMT opposi-
 tion after the Kaohsiung riot was outflanked by the
 security services.
 37. Personal rivalries are numerous, and allegiances
 and factions can change kaleidoscopically. In balanc-
 ing these political blocs, Chiang, in order to achieve a
 specific goal, often permits one group to gain tem-
 porary prominence. When the political task at hand is
 accomplished, he reduces its power and restores fac-
 tional balance. Since the Kaohsiung riot, Chiang has
 permitted the more hardline, conservative element to
 increase its influence in the party. Currently the KMT
 appears divided into five factions:
 - The Wang Sheng group, headed by the director
 of the armed services Political Warfare Depart-
 ment.
 - The old line KMT conservative faction, com-
 posed mainly of elderly KMT leaders.
 - The Chang Pao-shu group, led by the now-re-
 tired, elderly secretary-general of the KMT.
 - The Hsieh Tung-min (Shieh Tung-min) faction
 represents the large Taiwanese element within
 the KMT.
 - The Li Huan group, headed by one of President
 Chiang's old political lieutenants, is the most lib-
 eral and reform minded of all the factions in the
 KMT.
 The Rise of a New Opposition
 38. The more liberal political atmosphere of the
 early 1970s encouraged non-KMT Taiwanese to be-
 come more politically active. Supplemental national
 legislative elections in 1969 and 1972 had gone well
 for the KMT in starting a carefully controlled process
 of injecting new blood into the aging ranks of KMT
 officeholders. The smooth evolution of this process,
 however, received a jolt from symbolically important
 and unforeseen opposition victories in the Taiwan lo-
 cal election of November 1977. Moreover, an election-
 associated riot suggested a new volatility among the
 population. The Taiwanese oppositionists, encouraged
 by the election, looked forward to greater victories in
 the next round of supplemental national legislative
 elections scheduled for December 1978. Although the
 Taipei authorities' reaction was restrained, their con-
 cern increased as signs multiplied that the opposi-
 tionists were organizing and attempting to reach out to
 the Taiwan Presbyterian Church-a longtime ad-
 vocate, of Taiwan independence and expanded human
 rights.
 39. The KMT government took advantage of the
 announcement of normalization of Sino-US diplomatic
 relations to postpone the elections. The oppositionists'
 reaction was mixed, but most did not resist a short
 postponement as an emergency measure. The govern-
 ment, however, quickly adopted a harder line toward
 opposition activities. By mid-1979, a more organized
 opposition group-associated with the highly critical
 new magazine Formosa-began sponsoring rallies and
 10
 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP84B00049R000701970017-5
 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP84B00049R000701970017-5
 attempting to coordinate oppositionist political activ-
 ity.      The authorities probably were particularly
 alarmed by Formosa's effort to organize an embryonic
 political party by setting up "service centers" around
 the island. Opposition moderates, perhaps fearing that
 they might be politically outbid by the "Formosans,"
 were uneasy about such activity but appeared unable
 or unwilling to moderate it. By November, at the or-
 der of Chiang Ching-kuo, the authorities had decided
 to suppress Formosa. The Formosa group's decision to
 hold an unauthorized rally in Kaohsiung on 10
 December 1979 (Human Rights Day) provided the op-
 portunity. Either spontaneously or through the action
 of government provocateurs (many Taiwanese believe
 the latter) the rally quickly became a riot. This event
 was followed by the suppression of Formosa, and the
 imprisonment of its leadership.
 The Current Scene
 40. The crackdown after the riot has set back op-
 position attempts to organize. Opposition moderates,
 never fully in sympathy with the increasingly
 confrontational tactics of the Formosa group, worry
 that the Kaohsiung affair will reverse the political
 gains of the 1970s. The continued suppression of op-
 position  publications,  including  one  representing
 young, moderate KMT intellectuals-even though
 masked by the banning of some KMT rightist
 journals-indicates that the limits of permissible de-
 bate have been narrowed. Moderates within the KMT
 have been discredited by their support for a more
 open political system. Chiang Ching-kuo may even-
 tually moderate the crackdown on the opposition and
 curtail the growing influence of the conservatives in
 the KMT. The KMT's success in the December 1980
 national legislative elections redounded to the credit of
 the conservatives who managed them, however, and
 could give them a permanent edge in the maneuvering
 to direct the party's future.
 41. The elections reflected the government's at-
 titude toward further liberalization of the political
 process. A new electoral law, although containing a
 few provisions more liberal than previous regulations,
 in practice is more restrictive. In particular, the new
 law restricts the conduct of campaign rallies. It also
 continues to prohibit student participation in the elec-
 toral process either as candidates or as campaign assist-
 ants. The net effect is to enhance the electoral fortunes
 of the KMT.
 42. Nevertheless, the expansion of the number of
 positions open for election-from 124 in late 1978 to
 204 last December-allowed room for the election of
 more Taiwanese candidates within the party without
 threatening KMT control of the legislature. The party
 leadership was able to limit the election of non-KMT
 candidates to merely a handful. The authorities made
 a special effort to limit public discussion of the Kaoh-
 siung incident during the campaign to preclude the
 election turning into a referendum on the govern-
 ments handling of the affair. While this effort was
 generally successful, the election of five opposition fig-
 ures linked with the disturbance-including the wives
 of two jailed Kaohsiung dissidents-reflected contin-
 ued desire among the native Taiwanese for wider
 participation in the political process at the national
 level outside the KMT. The KMT victory may re-
 inforce the,impression held by many Taiwanese that
 the mainlander element of the KMT and its Taiwanese
 allies have no intention of liberalizing the political
 system.
 43. Even though the Kaohsiung incident did not
 spark widespread popular expressions of support for
 the demonstrators or their political goals, it jolted the
 KMT establishment as well as the security services and
 the armed forces high command. The latter two in-
 stitutions launched a sweeping security investigation of
 all armed services personnel. The investigation will
 encourage the military to follow the KMT position, or
 to keep their political feelings to themselves. The
 mostly Taiwanese rank and file do not appear to be
 highly politicized or unwilling to obey their officers.
 The heavily mainlander professional officer corps is
 political to the extent that it tends to support the status
 quo and the legitimacy of the regime.
 44. In the longer run, however, the regime may
 have cause for concern. One of the defendants in the
 Kaohsiung riot trials touched obliquely on this sen-
 sitive subject by pointing out that the Iranian revolu-
 tion suggests that the army could not be used to "sup-
 press the masses." This implies not only that Taiwan's
 conscript army might hesitate to fire on civilians, but
 also that the 90-percent-Taiwanese army might not
 suppress a Taiwanese uprising.
 A Turning Point
 45. The Kaohsiung incident and subsequent restric-
 tions on opposition political activity may mark a sym-
 bolic turning point. By their handling of the incident,
 11
 SECRET
 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP84B00049R000701970017-5
 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP84B00049R000701970017-5
 Chiang Ching-kuo and the KMT conservatives have
 made clear their view that Taiwanese political aspira-
 tions must be fulfilled only within the KMT frame-
 work. The message received by politically conscious
 Taiwanese is that Chiang and the KMT do not intend
 to share power. In October 1979, Chiang remarked
 that the organization of an opposition party must be
 prevented because its existence would mark the begin-
 ning of the end of KMT control of local politics and
 ultimately of Taiwan.
 46. Conversely, those politically conscious Tai-
 wanese who have cast their lot with the KMT may for
 the moment feel vindicated. The KMT government
 has demonstrated its ability to suppress dissent. The
 more militant Taiwanese-although now few in
 number-may feel convinced that only greater activ-
 ism, perhaps including violence, will weaken KMT
 rule. The moderate middle group faces a difficult
 choice. To continue moderate efforts at political re-
 form risks absorption into the existing system. To turn
 toward militant activism risks not only government
 suppression, but also political instability that might
 undermine KMT rule, damage the island's economy,
 scare off foreign investors, and-in an extreme case-
 invite Chinese intervention.
 25X1 47.         authorities have expressed concern that
 the Taiwan Independence Movement (TIM) is renew-
 ing its efforts to bring about political instability in Tai-
 wan. They fear that the TIM is procuring arms in the
 black market on Taiwan and through smuggling.
 Whether or not the authorities' alarm is justified, it
 indicates new concern about potential instability in the
 island. The KMT also has attempted to link TIM with
 opposition groups on the island. These opposition
 groups, however, are quite distinct from TIM and rep-
 resent diverse interests. Opposition elements range
 from those who actively oppose the Taiwan authorities
 as representative of all China and, like TIM, seek in-
 dependence  for  Taiwan  from  both  KMT  and
 Communist control, to those who generally support the
 KMT and seek public office. There is general agree-
 ment among the majority of oppositionists on issues
 such as the cessation of martial law; parliamentary re-
 form so that representation reflects the constituency
 governed; direct election of mayors and the Taiwan
 provincial governor; an independent judiciary; re-
 moval of KMT control from schools, the military, and
 the courts; amnesty for political prisoners; and free-
 dom of speech.
 The China Angle
 48. The special relationship remaining between the
 United States and Taiwan, including the declared US
 interest in a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue,
 poses difficult problems for Beijing. Continued US
 arms sales to Taiwan draw Chinese criticism as provid-
 ing disincentives to Taipei to negotiate peaceful re-
 unification. The Chinese are also sensitive to any signs
 of US backsliding from what they regard as the terms
 of the normalization agreement. At the same time,
 Beijing must take into account Taiwan's expanding
 economic relations with Western Europe and its trade
 opening to Eastern Europe. Combined with other
 links-particularly with South Africa, Israel, and
 Saudi Arabia-these ties afford Taipei access to invest-
 ment funds, modern industrial and defense technol-
 ogy, and favorable trade balances. These factors will
 help deflect pressures on Taiwan to contemplate closer
 and more direct ties with China and also help
 strengthen Taiwan's bargaining position.
 49. Increased Taiwanese pressure on the KMT for a
 more open political system also poses problems for
 China. Although this pressure affords Beijing propa-
 ganda opportunities to pose as a champion of political
 change in Taiwan, such efforts also contribute to KMT
 attempts to discredit the Taiwanese reformers and the
 TIM as dupes, or even agents, of the Chinese Com-
 munists. Moreover, Beijing is concerned that an in-
 creasingly effective Taiwanese opposition movement
 might eventually be in a position to achieve self-
 determination for Taiwan. The Kaohsiung incident
 thus has forced Beijing to examine Taiwanese de-
 mands seriously, if only to counteract them in the
 cause of reunification. Fashioning a policy to deal with
 these dilemmas, however, has caused confusion and
 dissent within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
 Chinese Strategy and Tactics
 50. China's official policy on reunification is con-
 tained in the open letter of 1 January 1979 from the
 Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
 to "compatriots on Taiwan." The letter sums up policy
 previously enunciated by Deng Xiaoping and other of-
 ficials throughout 1978. The letter promises to respect
 the status quo on Taiwan; guarantees the island will
 retain its superior standard of living; and calls for the
 establishment of trade, communication, transporta-
 tion, and cultural links between Taiwan and the main-
 12

 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP84B00049R000701970017-5
 land. It also implies a major role for "Taiwan authori-
 ties" (that is, the KMT) after reunification. Deng later
 stated that Taiwan could retain its own armed forces.
 51. The letter leaves the impression that China is
 willing to allow Taiwan to retain a large measure of
 autonomy after reunification. This impression was re-
 inforced by a later statement by Deng recalling the
 special district permitted the Chinese Communists by
 the Nationalist government during the war against Ja-
 pan. Deng stated that China would be willing to des-
 ignate Taiwan as such a zone.
 52. This approach, which emphasizes negotiation
 with the Taipei authorities, prevailed throughout 1979
 and 1980. The Chinese also stopped "shelling" the
 Nationalist-held offshore islands and reduced their air
 forces in Fujian Province opposite Taiwan. The idea of
 the use of force was downgraded to be used only as a
 form of psychological pressure on Taipei, or as a last
 resort if:
 - Taiwan sought support from the USSR.
 - Taiwan declared itself independent.
 - The authorities in Taipei refused for a prolonged
 period to enter into negotiations with China.
 53. China has removed restrictions on trade with
 Taiwan, encouraged visits by Taiwan people to the
 mainland and contacts in third countries between Tai-
 wan people and mainlanders, and courted overseas
 Chinese who might have influence to urge the Taipei
 government to open talks with Beijing.
 54. Increasing Taiwanese pressure for political
 concessions from the KMT, evident in the activities of
 the Formosa group, complicated Beijing's policy. After
 first treating the Kaohsiung riot and the ensuing arrests
 cautiously, the Chinese media in early 1980 became
 more critical, accusing the Taiwan authorities of
 suppressing legitimate Taiwanese demands for greater
 political rights. The new tack was meant to turn politi-
 cal tension and anti-KMT feeling on Taiwan to Chi-
 na's use:
 - Politburo member Deng Yingchao's public ap-
 peal in early March 1980 for dialogue with
 supporters of Taiwan independence, although
 she carefully repeated Beijing's refusal to con-
 sider such a solution.
 A letter of 15 February 1980 from the Chinese
 People's Political Consultative Conference (a
 CCP united front organization) calling on the
 people of Taiwan (not the "Taiwan authorities")
 to pressure the Taipei government to seek
 reunification.
 55. Implicit in these appeals was the notion that the
 Taiwanese after reunification would enjoy the full
 political rights they did not possess before.
 56. Probably most of CCP leadership preferred the
 Taiwan policy set forth in Central Document Number
 Ten, issued in the first five months of 1980. Viewing
 with alarm the rising potential for a Taiwan independ-
 ence movement, and fearing possible Soviet meddling
 in the island's affairs, Document Ten asserted that
 negotiations with President Chiang remained the only
 viable way to reunification and that China should do
 nothing to bring about his downfall. Implicit in this
 policy is a rejection of support for anti-KMT Tai-
 wanese, along with the idea that the KMT would re-
 main in control locally after reunification.
 China and the Taiwan Succession Crisis
 57. Document Ten contained a note of urgency
 about starting the negotiation process with Chiang
 Ching-kuo. The Chinese fear that achieving reunifica-
 tion with a successor regime may be even more dif-
 ficult than negotiating with the 70-year-old Chiang,
 who has not designated a successor. A mainlander-
 dominated successor regime might be interested in
 securing its political privileges through some form of
 association with China, but might lack the popular
 support to be a credible negotiating partner. Under
 such conditions, negotiations might provoke an upris-
 ing by the Taiwanese. If a mainlander regime then
 called for Chinese aid to suppress the revolt, China
 would be presented with the military conflict it seeks
 to avoid. A Taiwanese-dominated government might,
 on the other hand, choose independence and appeal
 for US support or-in the worst case-intrigue with
 the USSR.
 58. The decision, reportedly favored by Vice Pre-
 mier Deng, to concentrate on securing negotiations
 with Chiang Ching-kuo is necessarily a relatively
 short-run approach, dependent on an early positive re-
 sponse from an elderly opponent. Such a plan does not
 deal with the prospect of "creeping Taiwanization" of
 the island's political institutions. Should Chiang prove

 unresponsive, other voices within the CCP-partic-
 ularly the party's Taiwanese members living in exile in
 China-prefer to direct China's appeals for reunifica-
 tion to the Taiwanese, hoping to take advantage of the
 latter's resentment of KMT rule. This approach, how-
 ever, appears even less promising than Deng's. Even if
 the KMT as an institution survived Chiang's death, a
 "Taiwanized" KMT might not be willing to negotiate
 on reunification. Alternatively, the KMT factionalism
 might polarize around mainlander versus Taiwanese,
 with neither able to force a clear-cut decision for re-
 unification or for independence.
 Taiwan's Reaction to China's Overtures
 59. The government in Taipei has refused to enter
 into direct negotiations with China on any issue. It has,
 however, shown greater pragmatism in dealing with
 China's political offensive by adopting a more flexible
 approach toward the subject of reunification. Taipei
 seeks to avoid being characterized as the intransigent
 party while seeking to present itself as reasonable, con-
 cerned with human rights and popular welfare, and
 clearly the best economic and political model for Chi-
 nese development. Taipei has continued the trend,
 noticeable in 1978, of permitting informal meetings in
 third countries between people from Taiwan and the
 mainland-such as scientists, journalists, academicians,
 students, and athletes.
 60. Taiwan has modified its official instructions for
 handling these contacts. Targets such as students from
 the mainland are to be won over to support the Tai-
 wan model and encouraged to propagate these views
 back home. Defections, although not rejected, are not
 greatly encouraged. Although Taipei does not publicly
 encourage visits by businessmen and others from Tai-
 wan to the mainland via Hong Kong and other third
 countries, neither has it arrested and prosecuted the
 increasing number of such visitors. In certain cases
 Taipei has permitted its delegations at meetings of in-
 conspicuous, specialized, international societies to at-
 tend under names other than "Republic of China."
 61. Parallel with the easing of restrictions on "peo-
 ple-to-people" contacts, Taiwan for the most part has
 turned a blind eye to a major increase in indirect trade
 between Taiwan and the mainland via Hong Kong,
 Japan, and other nations. Taiwan's exports to China
 increased from $1 million in the first quarter of 1979
 to $26 million during the same period in 1980. Imports
 from China during the first quarter of 1980 were
 $19.4 million. Taiwan mainly exports raw materials
 (such as synthetic fiber), parts, and consumer goods
 (watches, tape recorders, and television sets).
 62. China welcomes this trade and pushes for fur-
 ther increases. It has made goods from Taiwan duty
 free and urged the exchange of Chinese petroleum
 and coal for Taiwan's industrial products.
 63. The potential of trade as a lubricant for easing a
 move toward political relations has built-in limits.
 From an economic point of view, China can afford to
 spend little on imported consumer goods, although
 probably more on raw materials such as synthetic fi-
 bers. Conversely, Taiwan-while willing to import
 specialized consumer goods and perhaps coal-is wary
 of becoming overly dependent on the mainland. Al-
 though the trade is likely to continue to grow, perhaps
 at a more modest rate than in 1979, it is equally likely
 to remain a small percentage of Taiwan's overall for-
 eign trade.
 64. Taiwan is careful to avoid signaling Beijing that
 increased trade means a softening in Taipei's rejection
 of political negotiations, or indeed of direct contacts of
 any kind. The Taiwan authorities try to keep the
 growth in indirect trade under control and occasion-
 ally crack down on overambitious businessmen or
 those who engage in direct trade. Similarly, Taiwan
 attempts to keep under control the extensive trade in
 gold and small consumer goods between fishermen
 from Taiwan and the mainland. As object lessons, the
 authorities occasionally arrest fishermen and con-
 fiscate their goods. Control of the trade on the China
 side appears spottier and unevenly enforced.
 65. The forces making for the island's stability and
 continued existence as a de facto independent entity
 are strong, but it is likely that the midterm and beyond
 could be a period of flux both at home and in Taiwan's
 relations abroad.
 66. Taiwan's greatest strengths are its well-run, still-
 expanding economy, the continuation of extensive ties
 with the United States, and a leadership that has dem-
 onstrated the ability to maintain its own confidence,
 and that of most of its citizens, in the future of Tai-
 wan. The government has demonstrated its willingness
 and ability to maintain public order and suppress
 overt opposition.

 67. The island also has vulnerabilities. It has few
 natural resources. Increased participation in the inter-
 national market makes the resulting prosperity more
 subject to fluctuations in the international economy.
 Rapid, still-continuing urbanization will continue to
 have an unsettling effect on traditional social bonds
 and mores. Taiwan still must import most of its ad-
 vanced industrial machinery, and its defense indus-
 tries are only partially self-sufficient. The continuation
 of political domination by a mainlander elite over a
 much larger Taiwanese population provides the poten-
 tial for friction. The legitimacy of the regime rests on
 justifications which make domestic political reform
 difficult.
 68. In the midterm, the KMT government's most
 difficult political problem is likely to be containment
 of pressure by Taiwanese for more meaningful partici-
 pation in the political process and for a share of politi-
 cal power. To be successful, the Taiwanese opposition
 needs able leaders, a central organization, money, and
 consistent plans. Funds are available from Taiwanese
 businessmen, from the sale of publications, and from
 Taiwanese organizations in the United States. Al-
 though the Formosa group has been imprisoned, other
 Taiwanese leaders remain active on the island and in
 the United States. Their abilities, however, have not
 been fully tested. The more moderate non-KMT Tai-
 wanese politicians, such as Kang Ning-hsiang, may be
 more successful in the long run in gaining concessions
 from President Chiang, but they run the risk of even-
 tually being absorbed into the system of mainlander
 rule. The Taiwanese opposition, both at home and
 abroad, lacks unity, cohesive and consistent plans, and
 any common ideology apart from their anti-KMT
 orientation.
 69. The suppression of the Formosa network ended
 the only effective formal opposition organization on
 the island, and the KMT is unlikely to allow a similar
 organization to be formed any time soon. The various
 overseas Taiwan independence groups have formed an
 umbrella organization, the United Front for a Taiwan
 Nation, but their chronic disunity and bickering pro-
 25X1      vide little hope for effectiveness.
 The government s ability to
 act decisively will not change in the midterm. In
 particular, increased activity by oppositionists that
 might complicate movement by the authorities on re-
 unification will be dealt with swiftly and effectively.
 To mount a serious threat to the regime the
 oppositionists must construct some sort of organization.
 71. The KMT finds itself faced with the classic
 problem of maintaining an effective monopoly of
 political power by suppression, judicious concessions,
 or a combination of both. As long as President Chiang
 is active, the government probably will attempt both
 approaches. Concessions, such as the inclusion of more
 Taiwanese in the government and party bureaucracy,
 will be accompanied by suppression of any attempt to
 create a Taiwanese political party. Chiang is likely to
 continue to tolerate moderate Taiwanese politicians
 who work for reform within the system, while
 attempting to limit their popular appeal to the Tai-
 wanese by co-opting them.
 72. These political tactics are likely to be accom-
 panied by continued concentration on economic
 growth and an equitable distribution of income to pre-
 clude the development of widespread economic griev-
 ances. Taiwan economic technocrats already are plan-
 ning to increase the industrial sectors of the economy
 while reducing the agricultural and service compo-
 nents. This will entail some consolidation of landhold-
 ing to encourage more efficient agricultural produc-
 tion with a concomitant increase in the urban
 population. To provide jobs and shift exports from
 fields such as textiles, where Taiwan is slowly losing its
 competitive edge, the government plans on the growth
 of higher technology industries.
 73. Despite a slower rate of growth in GNP over the
 last three years (12.8 percent in 1978, 8 percent in
 1979, and 6.7 percent in 1980), Taiwan's economic
 prospects appear good. There is no difficulty in
 procuring foreign loans from the United States or from
 Western Europe. Taiwan's recent loss of membership
 in international financial institutions is unlikely to
 have major repercussions.
 74. Taiwan, however, will remain wholly depend-
 ent on imported oil. No commercially exploitable
 sources have been discovered in or around the island,
 although exploitable deposits of natural gas have been
 located. Growing imports of petroleum to provide the

 energy needs for economic expansion is causing an
 inflation of about 19 percent.
 75. If the growth in energy costs is not reduced,
 inflation will increase, slowing real economic growth,
 raising the potential for popular discontent, and
 diminishing Taiwan's export advantage. The govern-
 ment hopes to limit dependence on imported oil by
 implementing a major nuclear electric power program
 and partially switching to coal. Both alternatives
 would maintain Taiwan's economic dependence on
 the United States, which is the island's major source of
 nuclear technology and low enriched fuel as well as of
 coal. This dependence can be partially offset by im-
 porting coal from other sources, such as South Africa
 and Australia.
 76. Diversification of markets-Western Europe,
 Latin America, and Africa-will help counter rising
 protectionism, but in the midterm these areas are not
 likely to absorb more than a small amount of Taiwan's
 overall trade. The opening of trade with the European
 Communist nations, with its political implications,
 must be handled carefully to avoid arousing Beijing.
 77. If pressure from the Taiwanese for reform is the
 most important midterm political problem, the loom-
 ing succession crisis probably is the most troublesome
 immediate question. Estimates of the state of Chiang
 Ching-kuo's health differ. Japanese observers believe it
 is declining rapidly; the Chinese also evidently believe
 he does not have many years left. As a 70-year-old
 diabetic,  Chiang has already outlived actuarial
 expectations.
 78. Chiang has not attempted to groom a successor.
 Rather Chiang appears to be relying on the machinery
 of the constitution and a reshuffle in December 1979
 of the KMT Central Standing Committee to ensure a
 smooth succession.'
 ' Under the Constitution, should Chiang die in office before the
 next presidential election in 1984, he would be succeeded by Vice
 President Hsieh Tung-min. Although a factional leader in his own
 right, Hsieh, a Taiwanese, is unlikely to retain the presidential of-
 fice. The mainlander-dominated Central Standing Committee is
 more likely to choose a mainlander. Nevertheless, Chiang's reorder-
 ing of the Committee raised its Taiwanese contingent to nine, one-
 third of its membership. This increase, plus the precedent of having
 a Taiwanese vice president (Hsieh) suggests that Taiwanese feelings
 may be taken into account in the selection of the island's future
 leadership, perhaps in the form of another Taiwanese in the largely
 ceremonial vice president's office.
 79. Chiang's reshuffle of the Central Standing
 Committee raises the possibility that in the event of
 Chiang's incapacitation or death the Committee will
 assume a more important political role. The Com-
 mittee now contains all the most likely "power bro-
 kers" for a post-Chiang regime in the form of impor-
 tant figures from among the technocrats, armed
 forces, security services, and the KMT itself. If the
 Committee does not select one of its own number to
 succeed Chiang Ching-kuo, it is likely to have the ma-
 jor voice in choosing an outsider. The representative
 balance within the committee may be altered, how-
 ever, at the 12th KMT party congress, scheduled for
 March 1981.
 80. Chiang's institutionalization of a succession
 mechanism and adherence to constitutional processes
 probably will guarantee a smooth succession in a legal
 sense. Chiang's efforts, however, may not guarantee a
 determination of the future locus of political power.
 The succession to Chiang will present a unique politi-
 cal problem. Chiang Ching-kuo was a carefully
 groomed, logical successor to his father. From the time
 he became Premier in 1972, it became increasingly
 apparent that he was the real authority in the regime,
 particularly during his father's bedridden final years.
 After Chiang Kai-shek's death in 1975, Chiang re-
 mained Premier for three years. When he moved on to
 the presidency, he shifted the center of political
 authority into his new position. However, he has no
 Chiang Ching-kuo to succeed him. None of the mem-
 bers of the Central Standing Committee have his pres-
 tige or inherent legitimacy as the inheritor of the man-
 tle of Chiang Kai-shek.

 81. The decision in May 1980 by President Chiang
 to extend by one year in their present position the
 Minister of National Defense; the Chief of the General
 Staff; the commanders of the army, navy, and air
 force;
 suggests that maneuvering for the succession has a
 ready begun and will continue.
 82. Chiang has attempted to staff the government
 and economic bureaucracy with able, bright young
 technocrats, but they do not constitute a political
 power base. The armed forces officer corps and the
 security services appear to be a potentially more pow-
 erful political base for ambitious officers, but Chiang
 has carefully kept the armed forces from exercising
 independent political power as an institution. The Tai-
 wanese business community appears to be unlikely to
 provide a political power base. It has prospered by
 going along with the government and KMT, and it is
 concerned that political instability would damage its
 economic interests by frightening off foreign invest-
 ment and disrupting commerce.
 83. Under these circumstances the military and se-
 curity services may play a more decisive political role
 in the post-Chiang period. This would particularly be
 so if a successor civilian regime ran into political trou-
 bles, if public unrest generated by political and/or
 economic complaints became serious, or if a civilian
 regime made what the officer corps-the last bastion
 of mainlander domination and conservatism-re-
 garded as excessive concessions to the Taiwanese op-
 position. The possibility of rule by the military with a
 civilian facade is not out of the question for Taiwan's
 future.
 The KMT Government's Options
 84. In broad terms there appear to be three options
 open to the regime in the midterm: maintaining the
 status quo, seeking an accommodation with China,
 and declaring Taiwan independent.
 85. Maintaining the status quo. This would entail
 continuation of mainlander KMT rule using current
 tactics. Economic growth and prosperity probably
 would continue even if international conditions low-
 ered the growth rate. This course is likely to maintain
 stability at first, but in the longer term may not be
 able to deal with the "Taiwanese question."
 86. Indeed, ever increasing prosperity may ulti-
 mately accelerate demands by the Taiwanese for a
 share of political power commensurate with their eco-
 nomic and social importance. The status quo would
 also mean continued close relations with the United
 States-welcome for its economic and military gains,
 but unlikely to reduce drastically US leverage on Tai-
 wan. To meet this problem, Taiwan would continue its
 efforts to enlarge substantive relations with a variety
 of nations without much regard for ideology. Efforts to
 increase military self-sufficiency would continue.
 87. Maintenance of the political and economic sta-
 tus quo on the island and in Taiwan's relation to China
 is probably attractive to many in the KMT and to Tai-
 wanese businessmen, but it is probably impractical in
 the long run. If the KMT continues its policy of
 Taiwanization, this could make possible political
 participation by the Taiwanese at a level acceptable to
 all but the diehards on each side.

 88. Seeking an accommodation with China. Un-
 der present circumstances, there appears to be virtu-
 ally no sentiment on the island among mainlanders or
 Taiwanese for physical reunification. A KMT move in
 that direction could easily provoke an uprising by the
 Taiwanese. A moderate Taiwanese politician, when
 asked what the Taiwanese might do if the KMT
 reached such an agreement, replied in that case "we
 would have to kill them."
 89. An accommodation short of physical reunifica-
 tion, however, might not provoke a Taiwanese rebel-
 lion if skillfully handled over a considerable period of
 time. Some moderate Taiwanese politicians have sug-
 gested that Taiwan's relationship with China would
 come under discussion after Taiwan had achieved self-
 determination but have not ruled out all ties with the
 mainland. Taiwanese businessmen have expressed to
 the Taipei authorities interest in more trade with the
 mainland.
 90. Taiwanese businessmen may estimate that a
 loose form of association with China might benefit
 them economically. The 1980s are likely to be a dif-
 ficult period, with Taiwan facing increasing competi-
 tion for markets, and these businessmen may believe
 that the mainland offers an immense market in which
 Taiwan would occupy a privileged position-although
 we think this is unlikely.
 91. A limited move toward accommodation might
 also assuage mainlanders' fears of being unable to pre-
 serve their political privileges against Taiwanese en-
 croachment. The Taipei authorities could draw on a
 mutual interest with Beijing in preserving the concept
 that Taiwan is part of China to thwart the desire of
 more militant Taiwanese for an independent Taiwan.
 Moreover, an article in the Communist-controlled
 Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao on 23 March
 suggested that the "Taiwan authorities" would con-
 tinue to control appointments to office on Taiwan
 after reunification. Of course it is most unlikely that
 an arrangement of this sort would be reached in the
 time frame we are discussing.
 92. Conversely, the more moderate non-KMT Tai-
 wanese politicians may hope that if independence is
 not a viable solution, China in the long run might sup-
 port Taiwanese demands for greater power on the is-
 land in return for loyalty to Beijing as a way of keep-
 ing the KMT in check.
 93. Declaring Taiwan independent. Undoubt-
 edly there is sentiment for independence on the island
 and among Taiwanese overseas. Sentiment for in-
 dependence appears strongest among the Taiwanese
 but  is  also  present  to  a  small  extent  among
 mainlanders, particularly the younger generation. Op-
 position to independence probably is strongest among
 elderly or middle-aged mainlanders. Within the top
 leadership, Chiang Ching-kuo and his close advisers
 adamantly oppose formal independence. Moreover,
 there is fear that independence would draw a PRC
 military reaction. Deng Xiaoping has stated several
 times that a declaration of independence by Taipei
 would cause China to consider a military solution to
 the Taiwan problem.
 94. For these reasons, Taiwanese politicians may
 judge that Taiwan's possibilities for full self-de-
 termination and independence are slim. Although Tai-
 wan has managed to retain economic ties with a large
 number of nations, the prospects are slim that many
 nations would recognize an independent Taiwan. Eco-
 nomic ties to the United States and procurement of
 advanced US military equipment might be jeop-
 ardized, because Taiwan's independence would be in-
 consistent with Sino-US normalization and thus con-
 flict with a major US foreign policy interest.
 95. As long as Chiang is alive, independence is
 probably out of the question. But even though there is
 little sentiment under present circumstances for politi-
 cal affiliation with China, the KMT leadership might
 find a resurgence of Taiwanese pressure for the is-
 land's full independence so intolerable that it would be
 more inclined toward a form of association with
 China. For the reasons indicated above, some Tai-
 wanese would also take this position.
 96. For the midterm (into the mid-1980s), Taiwan
 probably will remain stable and prosperous, as long as
 Chiang Ching-kuo remains physically capable of
 governing.
 97. There appears little danger in the midterm of
 an attack from the mainland. Beijing understands that
 an attack would be costly in men and equipment, and
 that in the next few years it will continue to lack ade-
 quate resources to mount such an operation with a
 reasonable certainty of quick success. An attack would
 damage Beijing's relations with the United States, Ja-

 pan, and the West-thus jeopardizing Chinese defense
 and economic modernization. In military terms, an at-
 tack would detract from China's defenses against the
 Soviet Union, primarily in air defenses, and would add
 an additional military burden to the current one of
 sustaining heavy pressure on Vietnam. Taiwan rec-
 ognizes this situation, and its desire for continued ac-
 cess to modern US weapons reflects concern for main-
 taining a credible military deterrent to meet future
 contingencies and to inspire public confidence.
 98. A deterioration in the Sino-US relationship
 might lead Beijing to revert to a harder line toward
 Taiwan, particularly if an internal debate over foreign
 policy caused the Taiwan question to become a sen-
 sitive issue in domestic Chinese politics. If Washington
 unilaterally altered the "Taiwan compromise"-
 which allowed the United States and China to cir-
 cumvent the Taiwan issue in the interest of achieving
 more important foreign policy goals-the Chinese
 leadership might feel obliged to adopt a tougher stance
 toward Taiwan.
 99. Termination of Taiwan's access to advanced US
 military equipment or a reversion by Beijing to a
 harder line on Taiwan might embolden the advocates
 of a nuclear weapons capability to press for reactiva-
 tion of Taiwan's research program. Under these cir-
 cumstances, Chiang Ching-kuo's successors might be
 more sympathetic to such a move. Similarly, if Taiwan
 were to declare independence, both a mainlander-
 dominated or a heavily Taiwanese leadership might be
 more receptive to the nuclear weapons option if they
 feared a more militant China and perceived a reced-
 ing US interest in the island's future.
 100. In the midterm, the chances are favorable for
 maintaining continuity with the past. Prospects be-
 come less certain for continued political stability and
 economic prosperity toward the end of the period.
 101. Having demonstrated by its handling of the
 Formosa group an ability to suppress organized dis-
 sent, the government is unlikely to allow similar or-
 ganizations to surface. In the midterm the limits of
 permissible political conduct are likely to be more nar-
 row than they were in the late 1970s. Although Tai-
 wanese pressure for a greater role in politics is likely to
 persist, the government probably can contain such
 pressures for the next few years. The opposition is
 likely to remain disorganized, disunited, and unable to
 tap potential mass Taiwanese political discontent.
 102. Continued economic growth and relatively
 widespread prosperity will remain a vital lubricant for
 passing political frictions. The authorities in Taipei
 will remain sensitive to any development that might
 shake popular confidence in Taiwan's economic fu-
 ture, and thus they will maintain a close substantive
 relationship with the United States even as Taiwan
 seeks to broaden its international markets and sources
 of foreign investment and industrial imports.
 103. So far the potential for instability resides in
 popular political grievances. More difficult economic
 times could increase prospects for instability. Even
 though government management of the economy will
 remain growth oriented, economic developments over
 which the authorities have no control-such as rising
 foreign protectionism, increased competition in or de-
 cline of overseas markets, and inflation caused by
 ever-increasing costs for imported oil and industrial
 goods-could severely limit the prospects for growth.
 Economic discontent coupled with Taiwanese political
 grievances could then become a potent combination.
 104. If the 1980s are to be troubled years for the
 international economy, Taiwan can hardly hope to es-
 cape unscathed. In this new economic environment
 the island's past performance may no longer be a com-
 pletely reliable guide. Nevertheless, Taiwan probably
 could weather several years of economic difficulties
 without suffering major political unrest if those dif-
 ficulties were not too sudden and severe and did not
 immediately cause high unemployment or high infla-
 tion. In the midterm Taiwan probably can adjust to
 new world economic conditions by continuing its cur-
 rent programs.
 105. The sudden death or incapacitation of Chiang
 Ching-kuo might bring Taiwan's domestic political
 arrangements and its relationship with China into
 question. Beijing has indicated nervousness over this
 possibility, fearing that a successor regime lacking
 Chiang's unifying presence and his authority might
 feel too weak to bargain with China, or that it might
 provoke unrest on the island by cracking down too
 harshly on non-KMT Taiwanese politicians, or con-
 versely be too pro-Taiwanese.
 106. Beijing's  preference  for  negotiating  with
 Chiang, coupled with concern about his health, lends
 urgency to China's otherwise patient attitude toward
 reunification. Beijing has made reunification one of
 the "three great tasks" of the 1980s along with eco-

 nomic modernization and countering Soviet expan-
 sionism. Although there is a heavily propagandistic
 tone to this pronouncement, Beijing clings to the hope
 that early, if minor, movement on establishing a new
 Chinese-Taiwan relationship is possible in the next few
 years. Beijing apparently believes that increasing
 international isolation will prompt the KMT govern-
 ment to reconsider its opposition to all direct links with
 the mainland. Building on growth in indirect trade,
 the next step might be unacknowledged direct ship-
 ping and commercial ties, through the use of altered
 documents.
 107. If China is relying on the KMT's heightened
 feeling of being on its own to prompt movement to-
 ward reunification, any development that strengthens
 the KMT belief that it need not move toward accom-
 modation is unwelcome to China. For this reason the
 status of Taiwan in the US-Taiwan-Chinese relation-
 ship is likely to remain a sensitive issue. The publicity
 given future sales of US arms to Taiwan will remain of
 particular concern to Beijing as will any sign of a re-
 turn to "officiality" in US-Taiwan relations.
 108. Renewed confidence in Taipei might make the
 KMT more willing to reach an accommodation in the
 long run, but might equally assure the KMT that
 itneed not do so. On the other hand, lack of confidence
 would reduce the KMT leadership's willingness to bar-
 gain unless the island's economy was so damaged or
 increasing political strain so great that the KMT is
 compelled to turn to Beijing rather than abdicate
 power to the Taiwanese.
 109. For the midterm, the most likely goal for the
 KMT, because it is the least destabilizing, would be
 maintainance of the status quo on the island and in the
 island's relations with China. This trend might be
 combined with cosmetic concessions by the KMT to
 dampen Taiwanese political pressures and a glacially
 slow increase in contacts with the mainland. Taipei
 would strive to maintain its identity as a special inter
 national entity, but in a tacitly acknowledged special
 relationship with China. The slow evolution of such a
 limited arrangement-which might seem to China to
 be analogous to the current status of Hong Kong and
 Macao-might avoid provoking a Taiwanese reaction,
 receive support from the Taiwanese middle class and
 businessmen (who seek economic security and politics
 stability), and isolate the more militant advocates of
 Taiwan independence.

 Annex A
 The Rise of a New Opposition on Taiwan
 The Election of 1977
 1. The liberalizing reforms of the early and mid-
 1970s were meant by the KMT to modernize the
 political system and to foster national unity by grant-
 ing moderate concessions to the Taiwanese. The more
 open atmosphere, which included the public airing of
 views long proscribed, encouraged many reformist
 Taiwanese politicians to engage in political activity in-
 dependent of the KMT. The results of the elections for
 local offices in November 1977 encouraged them even
 more. Although the KMT easily won an overall vic-
 tory, an unexpected number of independent can-
 didates, all of them Taiwanese, were elected to county
 and city offices.'
 2. Chiang correctly blamed the setback on KMT
 overconfidence, poor candidate selection by local
 KMT organizations, and the party's lack of rapport
 with the masses. Well-worn election devices such as
 marshaling the votes of military dependents no longer
 worked automatically. Even more disquieting was the
 first mass political violence in many years. The riot at
 Chungli over alleged election irregularities, although
 quickly contained, revealed a new popular political
 volatility. Moreover, the authorities' restrained han-
 dling of the affair may have encouraged the belief that
 the government was unsure of its ground and on the
 defensive.
 3. Despite his disappointment with the election re-
 sults, President Chiang did not abandon his effort to
 open up the political process. Although KMT conserv-
 atives saw the election results and the riot as proof that
 further liberalization would eventually jeopardize par-
 ty control and political stability, Chiang guaranteed
 that the national legislative elections scheduled for
 December 1978 would be scrupulously fair. In addi-
 tion, Chiang quickly opened a dialogue with the new
 opposition office holders.
 1 Independent candidates, some of whom were disgruntled former
 KMT members, won four of the city mayoral or county magistrate
 races and 21 of the 77 Taiwan provincial assembly elections.
 4. The non-KMT Taiwanese victors had no com-
 mon organization or ideology. This did not mean,
 however, that the new oppositionists did not have
 common goals or that they did not maintain informal
 ties. Kang Ning-hsiang, a member of the national legis-
 lature and an influential moderate Taiwanese, prob-
 ably spoke for the majority of them when he remarked
 in early 1978 that the KMT government should end
 martial law, release all political prisoners, and re-
 nounce the KMT claim to govern the mainland.
 5. Although the oppositionists were buoyed by their
 success and Chiang's acceptance of it, most of them
 were careful not to adopt too militant a stance. Most
 oppositionists, particularly the moderates, believed
 early formation of a new political party (which some
 had urged) would be too provocative and give the
 conservative mainlanders and the security services a
 prominent target.2
 6. With the advent of the national-level election
 campaign in November  1978,  the oppositionists
 adopted a slightly higher organization profile by or-
 ganizing a "nonparty" campaign office in Taipei to
 assist non-KMT candidates. This enterprise was under
 the leadership of Huang Hsin-chieh, a member of the
 national legislature who within two years was to be
 caught in the crackdown following the Kaohsiung ri-
 ots. The office formulated a political platform em-
 phasizing human rights issues,' underlining this point
 by adapting a symbol depicting a clenched fist and an
 olive branch.
 , Taiwan has two small opposition parties, the Democratic Social-
 ists and the Young China Party. Both are small, powerless, and prob-
 ably subsidized by the KMT.
 ' The 12-point platform called for strict observance of the con-
 stitution; lifting of martial law; banning persecution, illegal arrest
 and violation of homes and privacy; medical care and unemploy-
 ment insurance; abolition of protectionism favoring capitalists; a ba-
 sic labor law granting the right to collective bargaining; subsidies
 and assistance to the fishing industry; abolition of discrimination
 against local dialects; and amnesty for political prisoners.

 7. Earlier in the year, Kang Ning-hsiang attempted
 to widen the informal oppositionist coalition through
 an approach to the Taiwan Presbyterian Church. The
 church-with perhaps 200,000 well-organized mem-
 bers and access to coreligionists in the United States
 and Britain-is almost wholly Taiwanese in member-
 ship. Its support for Taiwan independence and greater
 human rights, as well as its church connections over-
 seas, make it suspect to the government and KMT and
 a natural ally for anti-KMT politicians. Although
 many church members and officials were sympathetic
 with oppositionist goals, the church as an institution
 did not formally align itself with any particular in-
 dependent politician or group.'
 8. As the election drew nearer, both the opposi-
 tionists and the KMT foresaw important symbolic vic-
 tories for non-KMT candidates. Even the election of a
 few more new independent legislators, coming after
 the results of the 1977 local election, would symbolize
 the evolution of an increasingly effective Taiwanese
 political movement. Cosmetic concessions, such as
 Chiang Ching-kuo's order permitting KMT members
 who failed to obtain party nomination to run as in-
 dependents without fear of party discipline, would be
 unlikely to change the image of a declining party that
 is slowly losing its internal discipline as well as control
 of the electoral process.
 9. An additional cause for official alarm was the
 unprecedented number of university and secondary
 school students working for opposition candidates.
 Except for officially approved causes, student political
 unrest has been minimal on Taiwan. Compulsory mili-
 tary training overseen by military officers, extensive
 propaganda and political work by the KMT and the
 government, plus student concentration on preparing
 for lucrative careers had long combined to dampen
 political activism.
 10. The government and the KMT responded to
 growing opposition organization and self-confidence
 with a combination of petty political harassment at the
 grass-roots level and restraint. Fearing a repetition of
 riots, the authorities adhered to Chiang Ching-kuo's
 ' This caution did not later save several of its members from arrest
 in, the aftermath of the Kaohsiung riot. This caution, along with
 government concern about the possible reaction in the United States,
 enabled the church as an organization to escape the crackdown that
 followed the Kaohsiung incident, although its secretary general was
 arrested.
 orders forbidding election chicanery and promising
 fair and free elections. When combined with the
 perception held by some oppositionists that the regime
 was losing confidence and was vulnerable to pressure,
 the "open-election policy" was later to lead to
 misjudgment by the more militant of the opposition.
 The latter overestimated the government's defensive-
 ness and reluctance to suppress its opponents.
 After Normalization
 11. The timing of the announcement of the nor-
 malization of Sino-US diplomatic relations was a
 political windfall for the KMT. Under the guise of
 responding to the emergency, the government post-
 poned the supplemental national elections. With the
 election postponed, Chiang and his advisers would
 gain time to strengthen the party's position, while
 using the occasion to shift to a somewhat harder policy
 toward the opposition. The reaction to normalization
 among the oppositionists was mixed. Some believed it
 would make Chiang and the KMT more amenable to
 Taiwanese interests in the overriding interest of
 preserving national unity. Others suspected that Wash-
 ington had timed the announcement to forestall Tai-
 wanese gains in the election. The more suspicious be-
 lieved that the United States did not want to see the
 growth of a movement that might call for Taiwan's
 self-determination and complicate Washington's rela-
 tions with Beijing.
 12. Initially most of the opposition publicly ac-
 cepted what it hoped would be a short-term postpone-
 ment of the elections and used the crisis to dem-
 onstrate its loyalty to the government. The govern-
 ment, however, implemented its harder line. The
 imprisonment of an elderly Taiwanese oppositionist in
 1979 on charges of spreading Communist propaganda
 and failing to report an alleged Communist agent-
 who later was executed-was meant to warn the op-
 position that Chiang Ching-kuo and the KMT govern-
 ment had not lost the will to defend their interests.
 13. Later that year, the authorities mixed suppres-
 sion and concessions to reach an accommodation with
 the oppositionists, the more militant of whom soon re-
 sumed political activity. Over the summer and early
 fall, some opposition magazines were banned and their
 publishers eventually prosecuted. Some opposition ral-
 lies were banned, others permitted. The rule seemed
 to be that indoor rallies of moderate size were allowed.

 Mass outdoor rallies were prohibited. Some new op-
 position magazines, including Formosa, published by
 Huang Hsin-chieh, were permitted. The group around
 Huang included those of a more militant bent, among
 them Shih Ming-te, a former political prisoner and
 guiding spirit of the group. The Formosa group early
 on adopted tactics-including those risking violence-
 designed to test government tolerance in order to
 quicken the pace of liberalization by forcing further
 concessions from the government.
 14. The government did not harass the more mod-
 erate oppositionists, such as Kang Ning-hsiang. Rather,
 the authorities began a dialogue with the opposition in
 an attempt to formulate a new, informal set of rules
 that would permit opposition activity but avoid a di-
 rect challenge to the authority of the government and
 the vital interests of the KMT.
 15. By fall, however, the activities of the Formosa
 group had alarmed President Chiang. The most threat-
 ening activity probably was not the publication of the
 magazine itself, but the magazine's establishment of
 "service centers" in several major cities. One of the
 members of the group later admitted that the tactic
 was intended to cover the formation of a new, or-
 ganized opposition political party.
 16. The KMT authorities, split between a hardline
 conservative majority and a smaller liberal minority,
 were unable to fashion a policy to meet the situation.
 This stalemate led Chiang to appoint a special KMT
 committee that proceeded in late November to com-
 ply with Chiang's orders to thwart the formation of a
 new political party by deciding to suppress Formosa.
 Only the timing and method of suppression remained
 in question. The Formosa group's decision to stage a
 mass rally in Kaohsiung on Human Rights Day pro-
 vided the opportunity. The rally, which was legally
 banned, quickly degenerated into a riot. The wave of
 arrests that followed started with the Formosa group
 and spread to include the secretary general of the Tai-
 wan Presbyterian Church, who later received a seven-
 year prison sentence for aiding Shih Ming-te's futile
 escape attempt. A series of trials in the first half of
 1980 imprisoned eight Formosa leaders for terms
 ranging from 12 years to life. The Formosa magazine
 and its "service centers" were suppressed.

 Annex C
 The Military Situation in the Taiwan Strait Area
 Background
 1. Over the past three decades the Taiwan Strait
 has been an area of either actual or potential crisis.
 During the 1950s there were two major flareups in the
 Strait area: the Quemoy crisis of 1954 and blockade of
 Jinmen in 1958. The PRC in 1962 built up a large
 military force opposite Taiwan. Rising tension caused
 by the buildup and China's subsequent invasion of
 India, and further fueled by longstanding antagonisms
 shared by both Chinese Nationalist and Communist
 leaders, almost precipitated a major clash between
 Taiwan and China. Although actual fighting was
 averted in 1962, the remainder of the decade wit-
 nessed persistent calls by the Nationalists for re-
 conquest of the mainland countered by Communist
 promises to liberate Taiwan. The early part of the dec-
 ade of the 1970s saw the status quo continue.
 2. Realization by the Nationalist leadership that re-
 conquest of the mainland was an increasingly dim
 prospect coupled with PRC perceptions of the growing
 Soviet threat, the US commitment to assist in the de-
 fense of Taiwan, and persistent Chinese domestic
 political problems caused the Taiwan Strait military
 situation to shift from the top of the list of priorities
 for both sides. The PRC leadership began to advocate
 a policy of "peaceful liberation" and Taiwan accord-
 ingly adjusted its policies to a more practical modus
 vivendi. Peaceful liberation of Taiwan was premised
 on a strategy of political and diplomatic isolation of
 Taiwan combined with a reduction of provocative
 military activity in the Taiwan Strait area. Occasional
 ship transits and routine single-service training ex-
 ercises became the standard PRC military profile in
 the Taiwan Strait area beginning in 1974.
 3. The PRC conducted a major amphibious joint
 service exercise in the Taiwan Strait in July 1976. Be-
 cause of the timing, high visibility, and location it was
 assessed that there was a dominant political, as well as
 military, motivation underlying the exercise. Nonethe-
 less, this departure from precedent did underscore
 Beijing's refusal to renounce the use of military
 force in resolving the "Taiwan question." Moreover,
 an improving PRC capability to conduct large-scale
 joint service exercises and to provide limited amphibi-
 ous training for units in the Taiwan Strait area was also
 demonstrated. Although the exercise did not represent
 a break with the existing PRC strategy for peaceful
 liberation of Taiwan, it did signal an intention to
 gradually expand use of the Taiwan Strait for military
 exercises and maneuvers.
 4. Military tension in the Taiwan Strait area contin-
 ued to relax through the end of the 1970s. Beijing's
 prudent approach to expanded use of the Strait and
 Taipei's measured responses have jointly lowered the
 possibilities of major military confrontation due to
 miscalculation or accident. Additionally, the respec-
 tive means employed by both sides for resolution of
 the "Taiwan question" seem to rule out use of direct
 military pressures at this time. Therefore, in the mid-
 term, the possibility of a significant shift in the current
 military situation remains highly unlikely.
 5. In examining respective force levels over the past
 15 years there is no evidence of an appreciable change
 in the overall force structure on either side of the Tai-
 wan Strait. Between 1965 and 1975 Taiwan ground
 and naval assets changed only marginally while the
 number of combat aircraft decreased from approxi-
 mately 350 to 300. Taiwan ground force strength
 decreased by approximately 7 percent. PRC air and
 naval forces in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding area
 showed a decided and sustained growth between 1965
 and 1975; however, the percentage of the total air
 force that was directly opposite Taiwan changed very
 little. Ground forces also increased albeit in a less dra-
 matic fashion. The trendline for these increases flat-
 tens between 1975 and 1978 and further sizable
 growth of forces in the immediate Taiwan Strait area
 is unlikely.

 6. Although the qualitative aspects of forces on both
 sides of the Strait continue to be upgraded on a selec-
 tive basis, force levels over the past five years suggest
 that the basic defensive orientation and posture of
 each remains unchanged. In the immediate Taiwan
 Strait area, the PRC enjoys a quantitative advantage in
 the number of ground force divisions that could be
 used in an assault against Taiwan. The quantitative
 advantage held by the PRC Air Force is also pro-
 nounced and suggests that any qualitative edge as-
 cribed to the Taiwan Air Force would be largely offset
 by the increased numbers of aircraft available in both
 the Taiwan Strait area and from other military re-
 gions. Taiwan's numerical advantage in principal sur-
 face combatants could be negated by augmentation of
 China's East Sea Fleet assets by units from either the
 North or South Sea Fleets. Current force levels are
 indicated on the chart.
 7. China is not capable at present of a successful
 amphibious invasion of Taiwan. The PLA has suffi-
 cient ground troops in the military regions opposite
 Taiwan to invade the island without weakening those
 forces confronting the Soviet Union, but, to be success-
 ful, China would first have to win air and sea superior-
 ity around Taiwan. Such air operations would require
 a drawdown of fighter-bomber and bomber aircraft
 from the four northern military regions. Acquiring the
 command and control capabilities, landing ships,
 means for naval bombardment, and training would
 probably take at least 10 years.
 8. Taiwan forces are not capable of seizing the
 strategic initiative and can mount only small-scale
 raids against the mainland. Furthermore, Taiwan re-
 mains dependent on external sources for raw materi-
 als, some major military hardware, and logistics sup-
 port. With continued outside support, Taiwan will be
 able to maintain and improve its defensive military
 capabilities. The development of a significant offen-
 sive capability in the midterm is unlikely.
 Trends
 9. The level of tension in the Taiwan Strait area
 remains low. The current level of military activity sug-
 gests that routine training and air and naval patrol
 operations are being emphasized. Efforts to avoid up-
 setting the status quo for no appreciable political gain
 have been undertaken and will likely continue. In-
 cremental improvements to force capabilities will al-
 low a gradual upgrading of Taiwan's current defensive
 posture. Overall trends are unlikely to change in the
 near term. The shift from an openly confrontational
 relationship to one based on a realistic assessment of
 the geopolitical environment is the key factor that has,
 and will continue, to exert the major influence on the
 level and structure of opposing forces in the Taiwan
 Strait area.
 10. A fundamental reorientation in the nature of
 the present Taiwan-PRC relationship would begin to
 alter the force levels and military capabilities in the
 Taiwan Strait area. Military forces of each side will
 probably remain defensively postured. Although grad-
 ual and selective force improvements will continue to
 occur, significant augmentation of China's offensive
 capabilities will be unlikely in the midterm. The cur-
 rent status quo will likely continue for the next five
 years, barring unforeseen shifts in PRC-US-Taiwan
 relationships.

 Annex D
 Economic Conditions and Prospects
 1. Taiwan's economic growth continues, but at a
 slackening pace. Growth of real GNP was 6.7 percent
 in 1980, quite respectable compared to most other na-
 tional economies but registering a continuing down-
 trend from 13.9 percent in 1978 to 8.1 percent in
 1979. Taiwan's increasing integration into the world
 economy and its industries' heavy dependence on ex-
 ports (which amount to about 55 percent of
 GNP)-coupled with the island's dearth of natural re-
 sources and limited domestic market-render Taiwan
 increasingly vulnerable to economic fluctuations and
 events beyond its borders and control. Taiwan's eco-
 nomic managers have proved resourceful and resilient
 in overcoming numerous obstacles to economic
 growth, however, and although rapid expansion may
 become more difficult to maintain, the island's pros-
 pects remain relatively bright, barring severe disrup-
 tions in the world economy.
 2. In the midterm the major economic problems
 facing Taiwan probably will be:
 - Increasing energy costs both at home and abroad,
 which can adversely affect Taiwan's terms of
 trade and are already causing increased inflation.
 - Continued dependence on imported energy re-
 sources, oil, coal, and nuclear fuel.
 - Uncertain market conditions in Taiwan's major
 trade partners, the United States and Japan.
 - Increasing  protectionism  in  traditional  and
 prospective markets.
 - Competition for export markets from other less
 developed nations.
 3. During the midterm Taiwan is attempting to
 deal with these problems by diversifying its trade
 partners-as well as its sources, use, and types of
 energy resources-and by developing technology-
 intensive industries.
 4. Taiwan's almost complete dependence on im-
 ported energy resources (oil, coal, and nuclear fuel),
 including reliance on oil for 71.3 percent of its energy
 supply, has led to increasing inflation as petroleum
 prices have risen. Measured by the GNP deflator,
 urban consumer prices, which rose at a 4.7-percent
 rate in 1977-78, were advancing at a 16.7-percent rate
 in 1979-80. The increasing price of oil not only has
 fueled inflation, but has introduced a higher degree of
 uncertainty into the island's economy. This uncer-
 tainty is especially detrimental to Taiwan's planned
 economy, which depends on accurate economic fore-
 casting for the success of economic planning. An
 interruption of oil supplies or an unforeseen sharp in-
 crease in oil prices could cripple the economy.
 5. The authorities on Taiwan hope that their
 energy-use diversification policy will mitigate these
 dangers. Use of coal and nuclear power will reduce
 dependence on the Middle East. Two nuclear power
 reactors are in operation. Four more are under
 construction. Twenty-four coal-fired generators and
 14 more nuclear reactors will be built or under
 construction by 1989. According to Taiwan's economic
 planners, coal, which accounts for 12.7 percent of the
 island's energy supply in 1979, will account for 28.3
 percent in 1989. The amount supplied by nuclear
 power is expected to increase from 5.2 percent to 13.7
 percent during the same period. Conversely, petro-
 leum will drop from 71.3 percent of the energy supply
 to 48.8 percent by 1989.
 6. Energy resource imports will remain vital to Tai-
 wan's economy during the midterm and beyond. In
 1979 Taiwan imported 82.1 percent of its energy sup-
 ply. Under current plans this ratio will increase several
 percentage points by 1989. The Taiwan authorities
 hope to cope with this dependence by diversifying
 their sources of oil and coal, as well as nuclear fuel and
 technology. Coal will be imported from South Africa,
 Canada, Australia, the United States, and even China.
 Although the island will remain dependent on US nu-
 clear enrichment services for the midterm and be-
 yond, it is trying to obtain nuclear power equipment

 from West Germany, France, the Netherlands, and
 Belgium. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are likely to re-
 main the principal sources of oil, but Taiwan is explor-
 ing contacts with Mexico, Nigeria, and Indonesia.
 7. Taiwan's attempt to diversify its export markets
 is well under way, and will continue throughout the
 midterm. Efforts to expand trade with Western Eu-
 rope have already borne fruit in the form of a pro-
 jected $5 million in two-way trade in 1980. This
 expansion has produced the problem of dealing with
 Taiwan's estimated $1 million surplus in trade with
 Western Europe. Taipei has attempted to deal with
 this issue by increasing its purchases from that region.
 8. Taiwan also intends to expand trade with Latin
 America, Africa, South Asia, and the Pacific Basin na-
 tions, as well as with several nations in Eastern Europe.
 Trade with these regions, however, probably will con-
 stitute only a small portion of Taiwan's overall
 trade-which is likely to continue to be heavily ori-
 ented toward the United States, Japan, and, increas-
 ingly, Western Europe. Trade with Eastern Europe is
 likely to grow only slowly as it encounters political as
 well as economic obstacles. Taipei most likely will
 want to be paid in hard currency for its exports, while
 finding little to import from the region. Taipei also
 will not want its trade with Eastern Europe to be inter-
 preted as presaging a major shift in the focus of Tai-
 wan's foreign policy.
 9. Taiwan also is attempting to foster continued
 economic growth by emphasizing development of
 technology-intensive industries. This effort eventually
 would bring Taiwan into competition with the United
 States and Japan, but probably not in the midterm.
 If successful, this program will help Taiwan evade in-
 creasing competition from other less developed coun-
 tries, including China, in labor-intensive industries
 such as textiles, which up to now have been the
 foundation of the island's prosperity. Improved tech-
 nology also will help labor productivity grow at a rate
 faster than the growth of real wages, thus maintaining
 Taiwan's export competitiveness. Additionally, devel-
 opment of high-technology industries will help solve
 Taiwan's only unemployment problem, the economy's
 inability to absorb the growing number of skilled
 workers. Overall, Taiwan has had no major unemploy-
 ment or labor problems. By the standard definition of
 cyclical unemployment, Taiwan's rate was 1.3 percent
 in 1980.
 10. Taiwan's history of good economic manage-
 ment and well-conceived plans for continued growth
 provide grounds for optimism. Nevertheless, adverse
 developments in traditional or new major export mar-
 kets, inflation, increased energy prices, and increased
 international protectionism are among the factors that
 could slow the rate of growth. Equally important is the
 continuation of political stability on Taiwan necessary
 to encourage continued foreign investment. In the
 midterm, before Taiwan's energy diversification poli-
 cies are more widely implemented, the island's major
 economic problem is likely to be inflation fueled by
 the rising cost of imported energy resources. Taipei
 probably can keep inflation within socially acceptable
 bounds, but a rapid growth in inflation and accom-
 panying economic uncertainty could discredit the re-
 gime and might lead to political unrest, particularly
 among ethnic Taiwanese.
