 Leadership Succession in the SOZG
 L oscotwOs satrap ?or the SOZG (Soviet Occupied Zone of
 ermany), I7alter      ICicT, will be 71 this summer.  A2a.rt from
 being in the precarious position of all Communist dictators,
 he has been reported to suffer from different physical ills that
 might carry him off,  Leis removal from the scene could trigger
 a typical Communist dogfight over who will inherit the mantle
 of power.  Erich HIO11 C O  has for some time been judged the most
 likely successor for Ulbricht as First Secretary of the Social-
 ist Unity Party (SED).                   A su nary of biographic data on Idoneclaer
 is appended to this BPO as an unciabsified attachment to be 'Ue 3-.
 in station files against the contingency of Ulbricht's removal
 and/or  a  succession crisis in the SOZG.
 Spanish CP Given Undue Credit
 In a 13 May New York Tines article datelined Ijiadrid, the
 :Franco Government was repot e{ claiming that Communist influence
 is causing the current labor unrest in northwest Spain.  The
 Spanish newspapers and radio, closely controlled by the Franco
 regime, were said to have first ignored the strike of miners and
 metal workers in the t sturias region.  Then, in a newspaper and
 'adio campaign, the troubles were laid to Communist instigation.
 It was further reported that on the local scene backers of the
 i egime have formed a "labor front" apparently aimed at improv-
 in ; relations between workers and management.  The new organiza-
 tion was said to have put up posters in Asturian towns warning
 workers against "Communist maneuvers."
 There is no evidence or belief that the Spanish C' is
 actually the prime mover behind the stri lzes - the causes appear
 to be purely economic.   It is predictable, however, that the
 Co ymunists will not fail to move in and grab all possible credit
 for doing something real for the workers.   In short, the Spanish
 Government is repeating the mistakes of the Nazis and Vichy,
 who unintentionally built up the stature and strength of the
 i:F:ench CP by giving it the undeserved reputation of having in-
 itiated most acts of .11v II resistance in France.
 Press assets which deal with news of the Asturias strikes
 and further developments in Spain should be asked to insert low-
 ...eyed comment that the official Spanish line risks giving al-
 together undeserved benefits to the Spanish C?.
 CPU Af ter the Thermidor.
 The CPSU had 7.2 million members in January 19!5G, just be-
 fore its 20th Congress.  At the time of the 22nd Congress in
 October 1061, Party membership had increased by 2.5 million to
 7-.   1    on (announced. in Partiinaya Zl izn -- ?arty Life -- in
 its January 1932 issue).    once one 22nd  ongpress, membership
 has increased at an even faster pace, by almost 2.3 million in

 The Russian Ea-volution of 1S31.7 has often been compared
 with, the French ).'evolution of 1709 which entered its Themidior
 phase when Robespierre was overthrown on 27 July 1794 (9
 Thermidor on the Revolutionary ca:Iendar).sp ewe's death
 marl ed  the and of the raiaYl of terror -- as did Stalin's in
 Russia -- the beginning of the 5-man Directory government of
 mediocre men (the best had been killed) and the growth of
 public opinion influence.
 The huge mass party of F hrushcahev no longer resembles the
 Party of Lenin -- the hard core vanguard, an elite of profes-
 sional revolutionaries.   It is no longer led by a dedicated re-
 volt uutionary elite but by a vast bureaucracy of party function-
 aries.  The party has increased by some 54% since Xhrushchev
 came to power.
 Bias in selection of new party members is clear.  The
 "typical" party member is Russian, male, urban and from the upper
 middle class.  Se:: and ethnic biases noted in the 35%a membership
 in -crease from 195  to la3l appear to have been maintained.  Less
 than 3% of all adult women are meiibers (about one fifth of the
 Party) against some 13% of the adult male population.   Russians
 accounted for some 64% of the Party but only 55%d of the popula-
 tion in 1951 while Holdavians were underrepresented, (by 74%) ,
 Baltic peoples (by S4%) , Central Asians (by 4:7%) etc. While the
 Party is supposed to be composed of workers and peasants, it is
 weighted to urban groups and within these to upper middle and
 above economic groups.
 The coning 170th anniversary of the French Thermizlor pro-
 vides one  among  many opportunities to disci ss the nature of  the
 C:p3U and the Soviet society today -- a topic of particular in-
 te-ost to Communist parties around the world as well as to
 leaders in developing countries.  On the one hand attention can
 be rolled to the inevitable end of terrorist regimes (the re-
 volution devours its children, -- Communist  China will follow
 the USSR in this process), to the failure of revolutionary forces
 to maintain a society and their replacement by mediocre men,
 spay?ee  during the purges of the able opposition.  On the other
 hand, how vast a manpower is needed to maintain a dictatorship
 and great power  chauvinism can be demonstrated on the basis o .L
 ,5's constant expansion of his -party machine.

 That Trice Soviet Ail?
 Chairman Ibhrushchev has discovered that winning African
 friends away fro_.n Chinese Cosa unists and the free world is
 expensive business and that his rubles do not always guarantee
 success.   In early May ,bh7rusnichev announced a $125 million loan
 to Ben Bella (to who.i he also gave the Lenin peace prize) fol-
 wing a re  carpet state welcome for the Algerian President
 in the Soviet Union.   On May 24th Khrushchev himself wound up
 a fifteen day visit to  the United Arab republic, his first to
 Africa, by granting a $277 million loan to F1as_ser.  Both coun-
 tries,  the only African states receTv-Tng  ny sutantial amount
 of Soviet aid, are also to receive the dubious benefits of
 agricultural advice and assistance.   Algeria,  having rid her--
 selff for political reasons of the B'renc`a colon, who tilled
 Algerian soil for generations, is now to have professional as-
 sistance from a country known throughout the world for Its
 spectacular agricultural failures.  Perhaps agronomist Thru-
 slichev expects that the Soviet "modal farm" he will send to
 the UAR will become, there,  the model he has never achieved
 in the USSR.
 The UAR was grateful  for Soviet assistance to the Aswan
 Day project but the Egyptian people oracle it clear that neither
 respect nor affection could be purchased with Soviet money.
 LLru hchovts popular reception was not exuberant and it became
 even cooler when he presumed on hospitality by attacking the
 UA 's friends, derogating their cherished beliefs and interfer-
 ing in their internal affairs.  1e disparaged Arab natianalism
 ~.nd Arab unity and urged his audience to substitute Leu n's
 unity of worker and peasant in a class struggle.   lie spoke
 disparagingly of the small but wealthy Arab Kuwait and of the
 emir who has assisted many Arab countries including the UAI.
 fe recognized Arab socialism but implied that such forms of
 national socialism were simply early steps toward Commuaist-
 style "socialism."  Fie harangued against Western aid (the USA,
 for instance, has provided $750 :million in aid to the UAR over
 the past ten years) as imperialistic and dangerous, his awn as
 open handed and friendly.
 Khrushchev probably sought a double goal in Africa:   to
 convince Africans that they should look to USSR, notCommunist
 hina,for Communist leadership and assistance; to deliver a blow
 at Western non-Corraiunist influence on the continent.  But he may
 have overplayed his hand.  The proud, roll- ous Arab peoples
 apparently refused to respond to the. ,,:theist leader who seemed
 to be saying, "Now that via have given you so much money and
 assistance we will tell you how to achieve real socialism and
 what :foreign policies to follow."  The African countries below
 the Sahara, noting the communiques which concluded both Ben
 Bella's visit to Moscow and Khrushchev's to the Mr., may ques-
 tion whether support to                           Soviet foreign policies over
 the globe is not too high a price for OAU countries cos i.litted
 by charter to strict non-alignment.

 700.  Soviet Lcono aic _?erform4ace Vs Propaganda
 25X1C10b
 All currently available information about Soviet economic
 planning in 104 suggests that decisions are being rude cau-
 tiously and hesitatingly.  The most reliable grain forecast
 (important for the whole economy) can not be made until just be-
 fore the harvest and even this might prove inaccurate, especial-
 ly if there is a lot of rain tiring the too-prolonged Soviet
 harvest.  Presumably, in addition to waiting until there is
 some reliable grain forecast, an agonizing reappraisal of eco-
 nomic and political needs is being fought over by conflicting
 interests.  A sudden change in Soviet economic policy -- i.e.
 reallocation of material and manpower for military-civilian,
 industrial-agricultural, and investment-consumption uses --
 could be announced at any time.  However, this would not change
 the  facts that, contrary to the economic situation projected by
 Soviet officials over the last several years (1) the rate of
 economic growth took a downturn in 190, (2) serious problems
 had accumulated for several years, stemming from policies fol-
 lowed from the beginning of Xhrushchev's leadership, and (3)
 while an especially damaging crop failure was suffered in 1033
 crops have been poor since 1950.  Nor will new policies or pro-
 grams change the fact that the world and, to some extent, the
 people of the USSR now know that C]?SU officials distorted the
 economic picture, cla nao- considerably better performance than
 had been achieved and withheld much pertinent production data.
 The 1933 Soviet digest omitted or provided enceedingly
 little data on several sectors of the economy -- data which
 has, however, been publicized in the free world.  Three of the
 slighted sectors, particularly critical for the Soviet ,snowy,
 are as follows:
 1.  Investment.  It is admitted that total investment rose
 only 2.7 percent     1063,  But since capital investment Is of
 paramount importance in the future growth of an economy, it is'
 significant that the usual detailed treatment of this sector is
 avoided.

 The CEA press release on 9 January 1J F. said:
 Ater 1 6a, however, econo;-aiic g cowtih began
 to slow appreciably.  The rate of expansion of fixed
 investment, upon w -ich growth depends, was not main-
 tained.  'Uith annual increases in investment cut in
 half, falling to between 4 anc1 v percent in 1062-03,
 a sharp curtailment in economic growth was in-
 evitable....
 To a great extent Soviet economic difficulties
 steri from a series of programs too ambitious for
 available resources....
 Much of the blame for recent reductions in the
 rate of growth falls on the sharp increase in Soviet
 defense spanding, which between 1953 and lDG3 in-
 creased by about one-third.  However, the problem
 centers less on the total size of defense outlays
 than on the diversion of scarce, critical resources
 -- both manpower and materials.  The military "bite"
 was particularly severe on the best scientific and
 engineering talent, on 'the most skilled construction
 .quality ma-
 specialists, and on the associated high-
 terials and components,  The costs of increased

 2. A riculture.  iTo grain production information is con-
 14
 tained in the CI,   t' and the agricultural section is drastically
 reduced, compared with previous issues.  production on the New
 lands is omitted -- the last good yield on this answer to the
 Soviet's grain needs was in 1050.  The current free world esti-
 mate of the lS33 wheat crop shows that it was 17 million tons
 be! 'ow that of 1362, itself not a good year.  The USSI arranged
 to import some 11 million tons of wheat and flour during 1a33-
 1904 .  The crisis in agriculture is known to have been buil.." ing
 up for some years as a result of practices in which the soil
 was mined and depleted, machinery was not made available, ferti-
 lizer was not produced in sufficient quantity, and similar mal-
 practices were coL witted which could have been avoided.  The
 debacle is all the more spectacular because Z. personally dic-
 ta tecl agricultural policy in every detail, promised the people
 in greasing supplies of food, and predicted an early equality
 with the USA.  The failure of the grain crops forced the
 slaughter of livestock which in turn means that the vary dairy
 any ,I  eat products promised to the population will be set
 even further.

 The four-page CIA press release of January 9, among other
 things on this sector of the Soviet economy, said:
 A necessary corollary of the headlong rush to
 develop heavy industry was the neglect of agriculture.
 Starved for Investment funds, agriculture was falter-
 ing badly by the time Stalin died.  IKhrushchev suc-
 ceeded, at very small cost, in temporarily reversing
 the downward trenc,.  The New Lands put more grain
 into Soviet stomachs, into livestoc':, and into for-
 eign markets -- perhaps most importantly from the
 standpoint of political stability, into the Luropean
 Satellite countries to male up deficits in their own
 laggard farm output,  But the returns from the vast
 new acreage plowed up in 1955-53 proved to be tempo-
 rary.  Once the original soil mositure and fertiw_.ty
 were used up, output fell off.  in 1963, a severe
 drought in the traditional farming areas, as well as
 in Kazakhstan and Siberia, resulted in a near disaster.
 Output on a per capita basis in 1963 was about 13 per-
 cent below that of 1953.  Total agricultural output
 de ;lined some 4 percent in 1962 and probably more
 than 4 percent in 1933.
 The plight of Soviet agriculture is further illustrated
 by the composition of the Soviet diet.   In total cv,:o--
 ries, the average Russian citizen is not far behind
 his American counterpart.  But 73 percent of the
 Soviet diet consists of grain and potatoes, compared
 to 23 percent in the US. Only 25 percent of the
 Soviet diet consists of quality foods -- livestock
 products, vegetables, and fruits.
 The impact of a short grain crop on this pattern of
 diet is obvious.  Bread for human consumption must
 be curtailed.  Livestock herds must be reduced.  There
 is plenty of recent evidence on the disappearance of
 flour from stores, of distress slaughtering of live-
 stock., and of the elimination of free bread from
 factory cafeterias.
 3.  National Income.  Data on this subject in the digest
 is too ske c y to a  ow proper analysis.  Chile there is a chart
 showing yearly changes in national income, it is given in per-
 conta ;es from the base year 1940   On the question of economic
 growl'-.1h, Soviet officials reacted most strongly to the CIA public
 statement of a :"ecline in the rate of the OPTS to 2.5%.  Soviet
 rebuttals were confused and contradictory, but careful analysis
 showed that they pretty much supported the 2.5% figure.  The
 January 9 press release said;
 Although the slowdown in industrial output has
 had its effect, the serious decline in economic growth
 in 1962 and 1963 is largely due to the failures in

 Although the Soviet ocononny,  [-,-Ivan :lore favor-
 able agricultural weather, may be able to rebound
 from last ydar's growth of 2.5 percent, the prospects
 for recovery to a sustained growth rate o ual to that
 of the 1050's are not bright.
 ACTION:  To ':sop alive the image of grave and well-nigh
 .:aso]uw e problens in the Connunist economic s s era, use any ap-
 propriate report or  nformaw on on Soviet   oc economic affairs
 as a peg.  Target audiences are, particularly, individuals and
 groups concerned with developing economies, and Communists   an..
 r :I' .cal leftists in all countries.
 The withholding of information frosa the Soviet people (as
 well as from free world governments, economists, etc.)  .n the
 1033 economic digest warrants special treatment in serious jour-
 nals as well as speculative articles elsewhere.  It is, for a:: -
 ample, a change of policy from 1062 (to say nothing of the 1020';
 when considerably more detailed data was presented.  But 1062
 was before the true state of the Soviet economy had been e_:)>se+
 an: _1     need for grain Egad become so great that the Uw3.2. could
 no longer deny facts.  Soviet efforts to buy basic machinery an:i
 plants as well as to obtain long terra credits from the free
 world further belled the Xromlin's picture of the Soviet economy,
 It is possible that the authorities in the Soviet Union are
 still trying to arrive at   the true facts -- or at least to agree
 upon one set of facts.  Account books have been juggled for so
 long, figures confused by using different base years, criteria
 and definitions, and indices (or percentages) used rather than
 concrete figures, that it is no wonder there is a delay in pro-
 ducing a new official digest of economic data.  However, the
 delay might not have cone if the free world had not successfully
 contested Soviet figures.  The failure of the C?SU to fulfill
 its many promises to the people is bad enough; but deliberate
 government deception (a Communist custom) can only cause citizen
 to lose faith in the regime.
 Generally speaking, the Soviet leaders will publish plans
 and ;.prograras sooner or later which will loop, very good.  Total
 production figures will be impressive"'"     ar e; goers will prob-
 ably be low enough to permit overfulfiliment; certain imbalances
 in production will be corrected; irrigation and other large uncu7_,
 takings will be dramatically publici :ed.    In our reporting and
 co,- aentay y on these announcements, we deep things in perspective
 by pointing out what is not in the plans, noting for example
 the building program includes all of the unfinished
 structures and the promises of forner years, e. . for

 ,         to zts of an e: chhange of 3 CPU and 4 CCP letters which the C?SU
 probably did not want to see published.     Despite their combined
 length of about l9,000 words, they are relatively terse and
 "meaty." They provide an unparalleled exposure of the poetical
 warfare between the two protagonists.
 Q,uctes from the INCHA texts are in the attached unclassified
 sum iary review.  The full texts in ITCINA's lsn;lish are in MIS
 Far   ,ast Daily Report Supplement No. 6 dated 11 flay.   MovreVar,
 t::e :multi-language versions published by the Chinese will be

 8  pehing Review (now in '. nglish, French, Spanish, Japanese and
 Indone          eons) and in separate pamphlets (no information
 now available on  languages other than English and Chinese)*
 Evidence in late September and October indicated that the
 w_SU was preparing to call for an international meeting of
 parties to achieve "excommunication" of the CCP, but that sev-
 eral important Soviet-sympathizing parties opposed the move --
 le n by the Italian CP which stated its views in a 12,330-word
 plenum statement in 1tUnita 23 October.  Thus, the 7 I~Tovemfber
 anniversary of the "October Revolution," which would have served
 admirably as a public platform for launching a conference call,
 passed uneventfully with Khrushchev calling once more for an
 end to polemics.
 (i) The h"hrushchev-sinned CPSU letter of 29 Novenber to
 Liao .must be rea  against this  acIkgroun      In contrast to the
 militant Soviet statements of September -October -- includ-
 ing the massive October Kommunist editorial calling upon every
 Communist everywhere to "fulfill his international duty" by
 helping to stop the Chinese -- this letter exudes a spirit of
 fraternal reasonableness.   it urges that the two parties put
 aside their differences "until the heat of passion has coole6"
 and concentrate on their common interests and tasks, proposing
 such "concrete measures" as expansion of trade, "'broadenif"
 of technical assns ance, including the send n ; of  ov .e
 t- s, settlement of boundary questions, and, as a sine clung non,
 the cessation of polemics and factional activities. Th=egen-
 eration o  coraiunica  on between   a two is s ri king in the
 plain-t? ve note that "Comrade Chou En-lai is reported in the
 press to have declared in recent talks with foreign personali-
 t es and journalists" that China Wants  a  er relations.     ru-
 shc hey  s letter concludes by affirming that its proposals are
 intended to create more favorable conditions for preparation
 of. a world mee ing, -- which both   1aVe more than once advocated."

 (ii) On 22 , February, that is, almost 3 months later,, the
 CCP wrote a brief letter saying that they had "learned from a
 number of quarters" that the CPSU had, secretly and behind the
 back of the CCP, sent a 12 February letter to other parties
 which "distorts facts," "manufactures lies," and "instigates
 struggle" against the CCP on the "pretext" that the CCP has not
 answered the 29 November CPSU letter.  After denouncing the
 CPSU for regarding their letter as "God's will," demanding an
 immediate and affirmative reply, the CCP says the 29 November
 letter will be answered in due course and requests a copy of
 the 12 Feb. letter.  This and all subsequent letters were signed
 only by the respective Central Committees.
 While the Soviets had refrained from (overt) anti-Chinese
 propaganda or political activity since 29 November, the Chinese
 had continued their campaign with increasing belligerence.   On
 12 December they published the 6th in a series of People's Daily
 /Red Flag "comments on the 14 July CPSU open letter," a hard,
 bitter, 13,000-word blast on "Two Diametrically Opposed Poli-
 cies."  On 4 February they followed with the 7th, an 18,000-word
 diatribe which is the most deadly "declaration of war to the
 finish" on the CPSU and Khrushchev yet published.  The CPSU
 "agricultural" plenum which convened on 10 Feb. was expanded
 on the 14th to include thousands of ideological workers in
 secret sessions at which Suslov was reported to have delivered
 a major speech on the problems with the Chinese.
 (iii) The CPSU answered the 20 Feb. CCP note immediately
 -- dated 22 Feb. -- justifying their 12 Feb. letter on the
 basis of Chinese conduct and stating that "it was unnecessary
 and even useless" to send the CCP a copy.  Accusing the CPSU
 of splitting activities is like a real culprit crying "stop
 thief."  "With what purpose" was the CCP letter sent:  "ag-
 gravation" and "exacerbation."   It closes by reaffirming that
 the CPSU "is always.ready to do everything in its power for
 unity.
 (iv) On Feb. 27, the CCP retorted, reiterating its charges
 with supreme arrogance, taunting the Soviets -- whose "bluster
 is like a pewter-pointed spear":   "please produce all the magic
 weapons in your treasure box"-- e.g. the "most resolute rebuff,'
 "collective measures," etc.   It proposes an agreement on re-
 ciprocal publishing of all materials, "if you do not fear the
 truth and the masses."
 (v) On Feb. 29, the CCP followed up with a long r? ply, to
 the original 29 November G SU proposal for "concrete measures."
 It denounces scathingly the Soviet maneuver:  we "will nix be
 misled by honeyed words or bow under pressure or barter away
 principles." Although seeming to comment reasonably  perhaps
 deceptively so) on boundaries, it sneers at aid and trade offers,
 describing the harm done by Soviet efforts to use economic re-s
 lations for political ends and declaring:  Q"the  hinese people

 ful epithets applied to there by the Soviets they asib: how the
 CPS"U leaders can even tali of unity under the circumstances
 and repeat their taunts.    Eowever, the CCP concludes by affirm-
 in  willingness "to do its best" for unity and proposing "ade-
 quate preparations" for a world meeting, with the resumption
 of Sino-Soviet taLts in Peking 10-25 October, and a preparatory
 co.t.aittae of 17 parties meeting at an unspecified later date.
 (vi) Tho last CPSU letter in this exchange, elated 7 Eared,
 consists largely ofre ~.fn hiations based on the C inese let'-ter
 of 27 February.  Asserting flatly that "there are no  and can-
 not be any,  'father, or ?son, parties," the C 2SU see.ls to be
 15M:1.11,77 a rene ie plea  or? cessation of poleiiics and discussions
 "with tact and self-respect," -- but then they torpedo their
 own effort by adding that "if you vrere really interested" in
 unity, "you should have accepted our proposals long, ago!" Tac1ted.
 On to the end, however, is an ac now a geraen  of receipt of the
 29 Feb. letter, which "rejecte  a    the proposals ere  made.     k_av
 J "resolutely repudiates" all of its "libelous attacks" ^a1
 promises to give an answer to it.   ?ocrever, in the present let"
 e:: it as necessary to corru1ent on "the question which worries
 the whole Co;uaunist movement)" preparations for a world meet-
 in.                  The CPSU questions Chinese motives in delaying the steps
 so long and proposes a greatly accelerated schedule, leading
 to a world meeting in auttuan 154.
 Two days later the Chinese published the Guth article in
 their joint series, another 13,000-word tirade callin ; on all
 Cora:iunists to "repudiate and liquidate fhrushchev's revision-
 ism," and on 3 April the CPSU launched its new polemical caim-
 paign with the publication of the February plenum materials.
 (vii) Ttao months after the date of the last CPSU letter,
 the CCP replied with a belligerent blast dated 7 Ilay:   it de-
 nounces Soviet hypocricy of word and deed, calls       Soviet
 timetable "a step in your plot to accelerate an open split,"
 repeats the taunts of "empty threats," and finally says that,
 "judging by present circumstances," it will be necessary to de-
 lay still further, with wino-Soviet talks coming perhaps in
 Lay 1r6~5, and with 4 or 5 years or ion; er necessar o: prepare
 for a crorld b, eeting.       also clear y   -orewrarns" the C ?GU that
 any attempt to convene a faeetin  of its sy:apathizers and call
 it a world meeting world put the responsibility for a split
 directly on theca.  The CCP closes by stating its intent to pub-
 lish the texts of these letters and repeats its taunting pro-
 posal" for reciprocal publication of all materials.

 convincingly than most other evidence.  The bitter mutual
 recriminations and the self-righteous hypocrisy of each in
 charging the other with unscrupulous, self-serving political
 propaganda manipulations) and evidence of betrayal by other
 Communists, all expose basic vulnerabilities in the theory
 and practice of Communism.  The following points are suggested
 particularly for Communist and left-wing intellectuals, and for
 friendly neutralists, in media and through personal contacts.
 1)  Neither the CPSU/USSR nor the CCP/OPR is fit for world
 leadership.  Both aspire to domination (tic t;a 'u
 "hegemony") first over the Communist world and then the whole
 world.    Both constitute a threat to all who risk involvement
 in substantial relations with them on the party or state level.
 The CCP (29 Feb letter  says "To be frank, the Chinese people
 cannot trust you ZCPS/" and gives a bill of particulars of
 Soviet efforts to use economic relations "as an instrument for
 exerting political pressure,  to "infringe the independence and
 sovereignty of fraternal countries."  Betrayal and counter-
 betrayal by Communist parties and individuals is spelled out
 in the letter exchange (e. g. efforts of each to suborn the
 Albanians to 1960; quick disclosure to CCP of the "secret" 12
 Feb.CpSU letter).   Soviet efforts to plunder the economy of a
 satellite are now being described in detail by the Rumanians
 Lso far classified information which will probably seep through
 into the press] after they were broadly hinted at in their
 22 April plenum statement.  The broad line:   if fraternal Commu-
 nists -- in Party or State relations -- cannot trust each other,
 then no one else can.
 2)  Trade and aid for control in developing (and also
 developed) nations.  The 29 Nov CPSU letter offering concrete
 agreements in trade and other relationships, might appear
 reasonable and constructive even to leaders in developed coun-
 tries.                       But the Chinese, well schooled in Communist tactics,
 readily unmasked this Soviet maneuver.
 3)  Wide range of unscrupulous Communist tactics.  The
 letters document more than the Communist strings attached to
 trade and aid:  many standard tricks in the Communist cold war
 armory are detailed in the charges of lies, distortion and
 quoting out of context, provocation by delay, and betrayal.
 4)  Communists fear a really informed, participating
 populace.  The 7 March CPSU letter explains its refucal of the
 CCP proposal for reciprocal publishing of all materials bearing
 on the dispute, saying:   this would extend the party polemics
 to "the peoples of our countries" and "would only arouse a feel-
 ing of legitimate indignation among the Soviet people."  And
 this from a party which describes itself as representing the
 whole people!"  The Chinese, whose motives in publishing CPSU

 materials are hardly what they clai;a, accuse the CPI of
 "fearing the truth and the masses, " and "treating them as
 rabble."  We should do the same toward both parties, but more
 particularly we should help provide all the truth.
 5)        Black propaganda to Communist audiences.  Both sides
 have threatened fur  er   sc osures (C!?SU 22     : "One could
 cite innumerable facts and if necessary publish documents that
 expose the behind-the-scenes activity of the CCP..."; CCP 27
 Feb:  "I'ie could cite a wealth of facts (about tricks you have
 played 3 ") . We should furnish some of these wide-ranging new
 "facts."  The Rumanian "declaration of independence" -- tilto
 22 April plenum statement -- said "there is not and cannot be
 a 'Parent' party and a teon t party."  This statement is identi-
 cal with one in the 7 March C?SU letter.  We speculate whether
 the Rumanians forced this on the Russians, and wonder further
 about the rest of the Rumanian "declaration."
 We also use quotes from the CPSU letters to taunt K for
 "turning the other cheek," begging for sweet reasonableness
 des-nite all the arrogant blasts of icy Chicom hatred.

 suf:2erin  on the Soviet people, and unfortunately for the
 Chinese people, the dogmatically Stalinist CC? refuses to
 benefit froze the experience of others. Communist governments
 autocratically decide what the people want, regardless of the
 suffering their decisions impose.  CCP slavish adherence to
 dogmatic theoretical solutions has produced crude policies
 and programs for al-most all of their critical problems, for
 example:   forced colonization and prejudice against ethnic
 minorities; unrealistic agricultural programs; premature,
 forced industrialization; aggresive and predatory foreign rela-
 tions; and a cult of personality.
 Ethnic and Ilational Minorities:  Stalin pursued policies
 to assure R uss fjca  ono  a   o   he USSR.  All of the so-
 called autonomous republics and regions wore compelled, for cx-
 ample, to concede the primacy of the Russians (their conceded
 right to self-deter :sination was forcibly withdrawn), to have
 their children taught Russian rather than their native language
 and to have Russians assi ned to all the top ?arty and govern-
 meat posts throughout the Soviet Union,   In extreme cases,
 ethnic minority groups were deported on masse or even liquidated
 altogether.  The !-Ian Chinese are no loss chauvinistic in their
 attitude toward minority groups in China and no less reluctant
 to apply terror iihen less repressive measures fail to solve
 their problems.  The Sian Chinese force their language on all
 other nationalities, they wipe out races by such tactics as
 colonizing the chosen people in minority regions and forbidding
 Mongolians to marry Mongolians.  CCP treatment of the Tibetans
 leaves no doubt as to their willingness to commit cruel and
 brutal genocide when their objectives cannot be achieved by
 other mean,.
 Agricultural policies:   In a headlong attempt to solve
 Russia s agr cu curate. pro lems, Stalin initiated forced col-
 lectivization on tAeRussian peasants, expecting to bring them
 completely under State control.  This frantic and ill-advised
 policy alienated the peasantry, increased Russia's agricult ^ual
 problems, and caused hardship and starvation for untold millions
 of Russian peasants.  The CCp toot: a similar approach in the
 formation of the cor aunes as part of the Great Leap Forcward.
 The result was remarkably similar to those of Stalin's forced
 collectivization:   an alienated peasantry, still unsolved  a  r.i-
 cultur`l deficits and                   starvation. in the countryside.    See

 where there was sohxetimes a, desperate need for consumer goods

 further into the future.  Chicom economic planning experts are
 following a similar prograr with special efforts devotoci to

 Lyrical expressions of his wisdou and cf the correctness of
 his policies are cormaaoniolace.  Radio >aahing recently called,
 Mao's thoughts "the lighthouse which illuminates all our Wvork
 and the compass needle  or China's socialist revolution."  The
 July 1, 13:3 issue of China Youth said "as fish cannot leave
 water and Infants cannot   av e their mothers, so revolutionary
 cadres cannot leave ChtArman 1.Mao's works."  The inago of an
 infallible loader of a dictatorial regine serves several pur-
 poses, anong the most i,aportant of which are to cover up a
 record OIL failure  to malbe the people believe that their sacri-
 fices have not been in vain, and to imbue them with confidence
 that the Loader can answer any problems and assure success,
 \rlaich is a li     just around the corner.  The infallibility imago
 also serves to give outsiders the iupression that everyone is
 united in strength behind "the wise one."
 hicom Defense of Stalin:   While the Chinese Co-;nraunists
 are 3i L    n , s Chief defenders they paid remarkably little at-
 tention to his advice during his lifetime, particularly after
 the  aid-1220's when his insistence on an urban-based, proietari a s
 -led revolution almost brought about the destruction of the CC'=.
 Lfter that time the Chico-as virtually ignored Stalin's advice
 although they did not openly challenge him or his right to give
 them advice.   In the 1540's Mao ignored Stalin's advice to enter
 a coalition with ChiangK^ i-shek and to integrate the Coalaaaahfis?
 army into the Chinese a2mod  forces at the and of the war against
 Japan      in Lugus t  1545.  Mao's decision to pass from guerrill?i,
 war are to an all-or.t fuliscale offensive in slid-1543 was also
 ta'hen against Stalin's advice.  The extreme irony of the pre-
 sent sitT ation in the Sino-Soviet dispute is that the Chinese

 called revolutiozary policies do not build a viable society,
 they only sacrifice two or three generations of people in
 failures that could easily be avoided.  So long as China's

 thoories of Stalin, they will fail to call forth the diligence
 anc ingenuity of the Chinese people and the opportunity to
 build a new, modern structure on the foundation of China's
 natural resources will pass then by.  But Communist revolution-

 have dealt with "the tliao clique" when they allowed the bloo wing

 792, 1E The Chilean Elections -- A Contingency Guidance
 ..r
 CZ5 oU1'r :   [For more complete , chhgrround information,

 Spanish version, Las elecciones c a enias,  Either of these may
 be passed to indigen?t s asse ts, but        the caution that they

 It is a significant fact of contemporary history that no
 Cc anzrm nist party has ever come to power in national elections
 which were free and in which the voters had a reasonably clear
 choice.  'However, electoral trends of the last year or LmOre in
 Chile have so increased  the  strength of leftist political forces
 that a victory of the Communist-led ? opular Action Front emerges
 a  a distinct possibility.    For that reason, the elections
 scheduled for 4 September 19G4 are perhaps the most important
 ever to taL1-.e place in Latin f.merica.
 produced verbatim.]
 Presidential Election:  A candidate must receive an abso-
 lute major  y oa the Votes cast to be elected outright.   if
 no one receives 50% of the votes in the 4 September election,
 a joint session of Congress will meet on 24 October 1964 to
 choose between the two leading candidates.  This has happened
 in the last three elections, and in each case congress has
 voted overwhelmingly in favor of the candidate that came in
 first.
 slith few exceptions, all literate citizens are both eligib e
 and obligated to vote.  The number of citizens exercising their
 franchise has steadily increased in recent years, and it is
 estimated that some two and one half million will vote in sop-
 te;mber.  tloman's suffrage came to Chile with the elections of
 1952, and their vote has become an increasingly important factor
 in Chilean politics.  They polled 30% of the votes for president
 that year; the proportion rose to 35% in the 1950 elections,.
 ,=d will undoubtedly be higher in 1934.  Women in Latin America
 have tended to oppose Coamunist-bacLded candidates by small but
 often decisive majorities, a pattern which Chilean women have
 followed so far.
 :?olitical parties in Chile fall in the right-center-left
 spectrum usually associated with European parliaments.  On the
 r Sht, the Democratic Vront (FD -- Frente Derbocr,~tico) , which
 controlled an absolute majority in congress, has recently dis-
 solved into its separate components:   the rightist Liberal and
 Conservative Parties and the centrist L4adical Party (PR --
 Partido Radical).  Julio Duran Neumann, a senator and former
 president of the Chamber of Deputies, is candidate for president

 On the extreme left, the popular faction Front (FRAP -
 Frante de Accion Popular) is compose,.:: of the Communist Partyt
 the Socialist Party and several minor leftist groups.
 C r.ilean Communist Party, one of the best organized in Latin
 America, plays a dominant role in this coalition, although the
 candidate for FRfp, Salvador Allende Gossens, is a member of
 the Socialist Party.  For nearly 20 years Allende has been a
 leader in this extreme leftist coalition.  with the help of
 the Communist Party, he came in close behind Alessandri for
 second place in the presidential elections of 1959.   In 1961,
 he was re-elected senator from Valparaiso, also with the help
 of the Co~waunists. Since 1954, he has been a frequent visitor
 to the Soviet Union, Communist China, and Cuba, and is a
 staunch supporter of Fidel Castro.
 The Christian Democratic Party (P C -- Partido Democrata
 Cristiano) occupies a position somewhat to the left of tenter
 but between the R on the right and FRAP on the left.  Like
 most other Christian Democratic parties of Latin America, the
 Chilean PDC is iceologically closer to the Socialists than to
 the Christian Democratic parties of Europe.  The candidate for
 the PDC is Eduardo Frei Montalva, Senator from Santiago.
 1953, Frei ran a poor third behind Alessandri and Allende.
 Normally unallied with any other party, the PDC may this time
 receive the support of the Liberal and Conservative Parties.
 Campaign issues.  Campaigning and voting in the Chilean
 elect ons rvi   be carried out against a background of a number
 of vital economic problems which successive governments have
 been unable to solve:    inflation, the steady rise in the cost
 of living, unemployment in the urban centers and underemploy-
 ment on the farm, agrarian reform, nationalist resentments over
 foreign owned copper industry, which supplies over 660% of
 Chile's foreign exchange. Allende has promised that his first
 act as president will be to nationalize the copper companies.
 With this prospect, the companies themselves are reluctant to
 spend money on plant improvement and expansion.  The nationalism
 that exercises the people over this problem is such a powerful
 force that no public figure dares oppose the trend and' speak
 out in favor of the foreign companies.
 According to current indicators, no one candidate is
 likely to win an absolute majority in the election.   If Allende
 wins a plurality, the Congress will be faced with deciding
 whether to choose the second candidate, in accord with law but
 somewhat in defiance of recent practice, or cast     their votes
 for Allende and totalitarianism.                                     25X1C10b

 There is little that stations outside Chile can do to
 influence actual voting in the elections, against Salvador
 Allende.  When stations do receive specific instructions, it
 will ;irobably be to prepare public opinion, particularly in
 Latin    3are, against him in the event he should win the
 .ss   over by Congress after winning only a
 elect-ko s or xc -,
 plura.1-J, ty.
 T;1, imes which stations outside Chile may be called upon to
 ea,p   w.t to condition public opinion against Allende and against
 a Communist take-over:
 a) Loss throughexpropriation.   If elected, Allende
 will expropr a e the fore gn-owned copper companies.  An
 immediate and massive flight of foreign and domestic in-
 vestment capital will take place and plunge Chile into a
 state of economic chaos worse than that of Bolivia and com-
 parable only to that of Cuba.
 b) Loss of individual freedom.   If a Communist-
 dominated cos     on comes to power in Chile, the essential
 freedoms will little by little be lost:  there will be
 strict government control of press, radio, television,
 education, and organized labor.    People will no longer
 have freedom to move:   they will be shot trying to escape
 to Argentina, Bolivia, or Peru.
 c) Hisuse of democratic procedures?  Among intellectual
 audiences, we at  impt to Inspire a cop:.tinual dialogue on
 the philosophical and ethical aspects of the very practical
 problem with which the Chilean congress may be faced:  Does
 a people have a right to surrender that which we consider
 unalienable, or untransferrible -- its freedom?  Even more,
 does a majority have a right to deprive a minority of its
 freedom.  If 55% of the Chilean people -- or of the Chilean
 Congress -- decide they want a Communist government, they
 will not only be acquiescing in their own enslavement, but
 they will be dragging the other 45% down with them.   It
 would seem to be the right and the duty of the minority to
 resist, especially in Latin America, where freedom occupies
 an exaggeratedly high place in the scale of values:
 "Liberty is the highest value," has come to be an axiom.

 Erich HONECKER
 Memter, Socialist Unity Party (SED) Polit~uro and Se .ret ?aria+.
 Since 1958 Honecker has teen a memter of the BED Politturo and
 Central Committee Secretary responsitle for security and mili-
 tary affairs.   For nearly ten years (1 46-55) he headed the
 Free German Youth (FPJ), which he patterned after the Soviet
 Komsomol ; he has teen a deputy in the Vo11rs-ammer since 1949
 and is Secretary of the National. Defense Council, created in
 3960.   As a staunch Ultricht lieutenant, Honecker was nominated
 to supervise drafting of the new Party statute and to expound
 it at the Sixth BED Congress in January 1963.
 Honecker was torn on 25 August 1912 in Neukirchen in the
 Saar, the son of a miner who later tecame a Communist function-
 ary.                         After completing elementary school., he learned the roofer's
 trade.   He joined the Young Pioneers in 1922, the German Com-
 munist Youth Association (KJVD) in 1926, and the German Com-
 munist Party (KPD) in 1929.   Elected KJVD Secretary for the
 Saar region in 1931. and a memter of the KJVD Central Committee
 in 1.934, Honecker engaged in illegal Communist activities in
 the Ruhr during the Nazi regime and server? as courier 1-etween
 rerlin, Prague, Zurich and Paris.   Arrested for the first time
 in 1.934 and released for lack of evidence, he was charged again
 in 1935 and was eventually sentenced ty the People's Court in
 1.937 to ten years in prison.   He was li.F erated ty the Soviet
 Army from internment in Frandenturg at the end of WW II.
 In 1945 Honecker tecame youth secretary in the Cen t-ral.
 Committee of the KPD, helped organize the anti-Fascist youth
 committees, and edited the periodical Neues Leten.   When the
 BED was estatlished in 1.946, he was elected to its Executive
 Committee, and also t-ecame First Chairman of the Central. Council
 of the FDJ, the organization he had helped found.
 After long memtership on the BED Executive Commit.ttee, he
 tecame a candidate memter of the Pol_i'r--turo in ..1,9 50. In 1955
 he went to Moscow for a year's training at a party school, after
 which ho assumed responsitility for security and military affairs
 in the BED Central. Committee.   At the Fifth Party Congress in
 July 1955 he was taken in as a full. memter of the Politturo,
 since which he has strengthened his position as potential
 successor to Ultricht.
 At the Sixth BED Congress in January 1963, Honecter served
 as head of the Congress Secretariat and as Chairman of the
 Statute Commission.   In presenting the new Party statute, which
 defines rights and duties of Party functionaries, he was given
 the honor of making the only major speech tesides that of
 Ultricht.   Honecker also delivered the Politturo report to the
 Second BED Plenum in April. 1963.

 Chinese have published the texts in the multi-language Peking
 Review and in separate pamphlets.  They are quoted and para-
 p ras d below in chronological sequence.
 I.  3,000-word CPSU letter:  29 November 1963, The letter,
 which contains no  one critical word, sugges s$  they "let [dis-
 puted views] wait until the heat of passion has cooled" and
 concentrate on "the development of cooperation, noting that
 "Corirade Chou En-lai is reported in the press to have declared
 in recent talks with foreign personalities and journalists"
 that China wants to develop contacts and trade with the USSR
 and other socialist states.  "In this letter, vie wish to give
 our views on the contribution which our two parties could make,"
 proposing "concrete steps for setting things right in Soviet-
 Chinese cooperation," as follows:
 (1) "In the course of the next few years, the USSR could in-
 crease its export  to China of goods in which you are interested,
 and the is ors; or goods from China...."
 (2) "If your side shows interest, it would be possible in our
 view to come to an understanding on the broadening of technical
 aid to the CPR...."Once again we affirm our readiness to send
 Soviet specialists to the CPR should you consider it necessary
 (3) "Both our countries would undoubtedly benefit from the
 bro denin? of scientific-technical cooperation and also from
 the develalmen  or cultural   es o  many kinds .... How beneficial
 was the influence o   ov e -   nese economic cooperation on  he--
 course of sollal                        construction in the   R, and also on the
 economic growth of the Soviet Union, is well known.   It is all
 the more to be regretted that economic coop at and trade
 ...has not only failed to grow in recent years, but on the con-
 trary has constantly shrunk."
 (4) "You will probably agree that the situation which has
 arisen in recent years along different sections of the Soviet-
 Chinese border cannot be regarded as normal.  The SovGo-    as
 area y proposed that friendly consultation take place to de-
 fine accurately the boundary in different sections," and "in
 this connection, we are transmitting to you a relevant docu-
 ment."  "Statesmen s have -recently been mace in     na concern-

 Ignore this can become the source of  ninunc erstandings and con-

 problems artifically at the present timme.... "
 (5) "We should also...bar any acts whatsoever that night under-
 nine unity" and "repulse factionalists and splitters....
 (6) "The CC/CPSU has more than once advocated the cessation of
 public polemics .... 'Ie do not propose a general cessa ao~n of    e

 developments,  u  desire only that it should take place in the
 forms provided'-ior by the statement of the fraternal pare
 (VP's) in IUOO -- through mutua  consultation  negotiations,
 and exchanges of letters.'
 The letter then states that "in making these proposals,
 the CC/CPSU bases itself on the consideration that they will
 help strengthen confidence and create more favorable conditions
 for the preparation of a world meeting of t e Commun st and
 workers parties.  Recently, the CPBU and the CCF, like many
 other FP's have more than once advocated the convening of such
 a meeting.  We now reaffirm this position of ours...."
 "...Y"7e may differ in our understanding of this or that
 ideological problem, or in our estimates of specific phenomena
 of social development -- life will correct those who are mis-

 upon to Justify their t- st."
 The letter is signed by Ithrushchev as First Secretary of
 the CC/CpSU.  (All others on both sides in this series are
 signed only by the "Central Committee.)
 II.       500-word CCP letter:  20 February 1964.   It begins
 bluntly:    ,e Have laarneC4 from a num or of quarters that the

 'struggle against the great-power and Trotskyite views and the
 factional and disruptive activities of the Chinese loaders.'
 This letter has not, however, been sent to the CC?, from which
 it has been kept a secret."
 "...While crying for a halt to public polemics under the
 pretense of desiring unity, the C?STJ leaders are engineering
 a new campaign against the CCP and other Ili-L parties behind the
 back of the CC? and are unscrupulously engaging  in sec ariafa,

 "You have launched the present ca zpaign against the CCP on
 the new pretext that the CCP has not yet replied to your letter
 of 29 November 1903.  But we would like to ask;  Why were you
 free for a long time to act wilfully and refuse to accept tne
 acv cc of PPP's against bringing inter-party differences into
 the open before the onemy and their proposal for a halt to pub-
 lic polemics, whereas the CCP must regard the letter from the
 CPSU leaders as God's will and give an immediate and afflruia ive
 reply or also be c arged c-ith the major crime o   insubordination?
 Why are you privileged to publish thousands o  lengthy articles
 and other items attacking us, whereas we may not make any reply
 to set the facts straight and distinguish truth from falsehood?
 A journey has to be made step by step and problems have to be
 solved one by one.  Your letter will be answered in due course.
 Your self-important and domineering attitude in maintaining
 that you can attack whenever you please and that we must stop
 as soon as you cry halt has fully exposed your inveterate habit
 of great-power chauvinism and posing as the'fat er par y.
 "The present grave act of the C?U leaders to create a

 known to you long before we approached the FP's .... it was
 unnocessary and indeed useless ss to send you our letter of

 "After all this, one can only be surprised at your
 allegations.... `.s the saying goes among our people, this
 is using the well-known method in which the real culprit
 cries 'stop thief.'
 "If one is to look for real doubledealer....As early
 as June 1960, Comrade Liu S? ao-chi and other CCP leaders,
 in their-talks with an Albanian delegation, slandered the
 CPSU...and tried to set the Albanian public leaders against
 the CPSU.  T H555 ac  ons By the     nese leadership evoked
 the jus  indignation of members of the Albanian delegation
 who openly said so to the Chinese comrades and informed
 the CC/CPSU.... One could cite innumerable facts-and-:02
 necessary publish documents that expose the behind-the-
 scones activity of the CCP leadership.,..
 "As for the CPSU, we do not conceal our views and
 activities....?he CC/CPSU has not allowed itself to be
 provoked and has not taken the path of squabbling on the
 principle of  'spearpoint against spearpoint'....
 "As for your attempts to juggle with words like
 'great-power chauvinism,'  'self-important,'  'domineering,'
 'inveterate habit of posing as the father party,'  'God's
 will,' etc., we have to tell you that the use of such ex-
 pressions only testifies to the weakness of your position
 "For 4 years the FP's of the world have been appeal-
 int to the CC/CCP to approach the matter from the view-
 point of common interests and to cease its attempts to  im-
 pose its erroneous 'general line' on the WCM..,.but with
 growing ambition [the CCP? leadership] is posing as the sole
 heir of the founders of L-L and the supreme judge as re-
 gards the theory and practice of Communism....
 "Your great-power habits also appear in your last
 short letter when, addressing the CC/C?SU, you demand that
 it send to you its letter of 12 Feb.  You do noequest,
 but demand .... This is not merely rude, but simply ridicu-
 lous.

 us to reflect once again:  with what purpose was it sent?

 (5) Stopping public polemics.  You "provokked" and "impooseed,

 clearer and clearer and P1[-L is making more and more progress.
 What was a bad thing is becoming a good thing....It leads more
 and more people away from the bad influence of the baton and
 makes them think over problems independently,.,."
 After citing a series of CCP offers to end polemics, which
 the CLSU rejected, and quoting an early (1960) Soviet statement
 calling for open discussions, the letter says
 "But now you suddenly make a turn of 1010 degrees on this
 question and say that we should  o  the differences wait.
 What are ' ou up to?  To put it plainly, you are merely re-
 sor  ng to this trick to deprive us of the right to reply
 ...after you have heaped so much abuse....,'
 The CCP letter then gives a detailed account of the "anti-
 Chinese campaign" carried on by the C.'?SU and a number of other
 parties, by name, in reply to which "we have all along exercised
 great restraint."
 'How are you going to wind up the whole affair?  Do you pro-

 a    our attacks on the CCP are lies and slanders and remov-

 Leninist, or was he a murderer, a bandit and a gambler?
 ....These questions admit of no equivocation, but must be
 throroug z y straightened out.   Sow can issues of such faagni-

 The letter concludes with an assertion that, despite every-
 t%ing, the CC,P "is willing to do its best for the restoration
 and strengthening of unity and proposes  the following concrete
 measures:"  resumption of the Chinese-Soviet party talks in
