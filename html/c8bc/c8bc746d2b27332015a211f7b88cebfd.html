							    	[Text)    	In  view  of  the  rapid  opening  up  of  China's
							    	foreign  policy  and  the  d~velopmenC  of  e~~onomic  rela-
							    	tions  between  Japan  and  China~   	the  Ja~pa.n  Economic
							    	Research  Center  atarted  a  pro~ect  on  "Fteaearch  on
							    	the  Economic  Relations  Between  Japan  aMd  China"  in
							    	October  1977   	(under  the  direction  of  Sueo  Sekiguchi,
	    	_							chief  research  fellow  of  the  Japan  Ecc~~omic  ~tesearch		     	~
							    	Center).    	Members  of  the  pro~ect  viei~ed  China  in					     	-
							    	December  lasC  year  and  xeviewed  their  find~,ngs.    	The
							    	following  is  ~  resume  of  the  resulCs.
					  	A  China  boom  began  in  1978  in  Western  industrial  countrips  including
					  	Japan,  and  China's  economic  policy  toward  thE.  West  became  unexpectedly
					  	active  in  the  summer  of  that  year.    	Vieitora  to  China  at  the  end  of  last
					  	year  said  that  the  Chinese  authorities  were  talking  to  them  about  eco-		     	-
	    	'			    	nomic  matters  three  times  more  than  they  di~  in  the  summer.    	It  seems
					   	that   	the  policy  of  the  leaders  has  penetrated  deep  among  the  people  who
					   	are  confidently  and  actively  pushing  the  "f.our  caodernizatione"  ahead.
					  	Naturally  a  visit  to  China  by  us  nonexperte  who  have  been  engaged  in  China
					  	watching  for  only  about  a  yeax  and  a  half  cannot  reveal  much.    	But  on  the		 	-
					   	other  hand,   	research  by  expsrts  does  not  necesearily  reveal  the  secrets
					   	of  China's  economic  developments.    	We  must  look  at  the  aituation  in  Che
	    	,			     	light  of  both  our  own  concept  and  their  ic~ea  of  "self-reliance"  and
					   	"walking  on  two  l~egs."
					   	We  must  not  for~et  thaC  political  educatian  and  moral  inducements  play  an
					   	important  role  in  China.    	However,   	there  is  a  limit  to  this.    	Many  an				~
					   	earthquake  in  their  policies  in  the  past  was  not  unconnected  with  this.
					   	Some  disputes  over  political  leadership  were  centered  around  clashes			  	_
					   	over  the  value  of  moral  and  material  inducements.

			  	we  nonexperCe  will  diecuss  China'e  economic  developmente  and  questions
			  	concerning  the  ecnnomic  relgCions  between  Japan  and  Chinn  from  our  view--
			  	poinC.
			  	In  tlie  end  we  will  deal  with  we~ys  in  which  Japgn  can  contribuCe  Chrougti
			  	cooperation,  bearing  in  mind  the  special  relations  between  the  Cwo  coun-
			  	tries.
			  	Chinn's  Present  Cconomic  Situgtion
																										:
			  	IC  is  dif�icult  to  summarize  the  economic  aituation  of  a  country  with  a
			  	territory  as  vast  and~varied  ae  China.    	Here  we  will  make  an  uttempt  to
			  	outline  China's  economy  from  five  aspects~  which  we  feel  would  be  u~eful
			  	for  the  study  of  the  economic  relations  between  Japan  and  China.
			  	LaCent  Growth  Power--There  are  various  ways   	Co  estimate  China's  CNP.
			  	Tab1e  1  is  an  estimaCe  by  Che  World  Bank  for  international  comparison.
			  	According  to  this  table,  China's  per  capita  GNP  in  1975  reached  about
			  	$400.    	Since  the  population  growth  from  1970  to  1975  was  1.7  percpnt
			  	annually,   	the  annual  per  capita  GNP  growth  is  therefore  eatimated  at  5.3
			  	percent.    	This  growCh  rate  is  low  when  compared  with  the  RUK  but  fairly
			  	high  when  compared  with  the  United  States,   	the  Soviet  Union  or  J~pan.
			   	1.    	The  People's  Enthusiaem  for  Work
			   	Since  the  beginning  of  the  1970's,  China's  economy  has  been  growing  at  a
			   	rate  second  only  to  the  rapidly  developing  countries   	(the  ROY.,  Mexico,				  	-
			   	Brazil  and  the  like).    	But  will  this  continuP?    	We  believe  it  c~ill.
		-		  	China  has  gone  through  the  Great  Leap  Forward   	(1958  to  1960),   	the
			   	Gultural  Revolution   	(1966  to  1969)  and  then  the  period  of  chaoa  under				   	-
			   	the  "gang  of  foux"   	(1976)  during  which  China's  economy  remained  sCagnant.
			   	But  now  the  leadership  has  e~tabliahed  itself  firmly.    	If  they  continue
			   	with  their  current  policy  of  industrialization,  China's  growth  power  is
			   	believed  to  be  strong.
			   	This  ~udgment  is  based  firs~  of  all  on  the  universality  of  primary  and
			   	secondary  education,   	the  high  quality  of  the  labor  force  and  the  vigor-
			   	ous  enthusiasm  of  the  peasanCs  for  their  work.    	In  a  country  such  as
			   	China,  which  has  a  population  of  900  million,   	ite  future  is  determined
			   	by  the  mobilization  and  development  of  human  resources  rather  than  Che
			   	possession  of  natural  resources  as  is  widely  believed.    	But  there  are
     	~		  	still  queations  concerning  the  attitude  of  the  people  toward  saving  and
			   	investment  and  the  power  of  technical  innovations,  which  will  be  dis-
			   	cussed  in  the  following.

					 	4.    	The  Need  To  Introduce  Foreign  Cnpital
					 	Accumulation  of  Capital--Accumulation  of  capital  is   	thc  key  to  economic
					 	growth.    	Professor  Ishikawa  formerly  had  a  system  for  making  estimates  ot		 	=
					 	China's  capital  accumulation,   	but   	there  is  as  yet  no  accepted  formula  for
					 	long-term  estimates.    	We  have  attempted  Co  find   	the  b~iLance  of  i~tvestments
	   	-			   	of  savings  in  agricultural  and  nonagricultural  departments  utider  a  set  oE
					 	presumptions  in  the  rate  of  labor  distribution,   	raee  c~f  savi.ngs  an~l
					 	marginal  capital  coefficient.    	Although  this  is  only  ~1  ruugl~  esCimaee,
					 	we   	found  thnt  during  the  periods  of  chaos   	(1959  to  19G1;   	1967  and  1916)
					 	capital  wns  wasted  even  in  agricultural  deparCments.    	tlowever,   	durin~
	   	~			   	other  periods,   	savings   	flowed   	from  agricultural  to  nonagri.culturnl  depnrt-
					 	ments.    	To  get  closer   	ro  the  core,   	it  may  be  necessary   	to   	f.ind  evl.dence
	   	=			   	of  the  flow  of  surpluses   	from  lighC  Co  heavy  industry.    	But   	this   	is  only
	    	-			    	a  recent  phenomenon.
					 	Table  3  is  a  comparison  of  the  results  of  our  estimates  with  the  rate  of
					 	investment  in  other  Asian  countries.    	China's  rate  of  accumulntion  is
	   	-			    	lower  than  those  of  Japan  and  the  ROK,  but   	it  shows   	tha~  when  there  was

							according  to  the  UN's  "Asia-Pacific  StaCistical  Year."
			   	In  the  past~   	China's  marginal  capital  coeffi~ient  was  believed  to  be
			   	near  4.    	CapiCal  efficiency  was  lowered  by  the  increase  of  marginally
	 	_		 	uaeful  equipment,   	chaotic  policies,  political  struggles  and  delays  in
			   	the  distribution  of  raw  maCerials.    	Thus,   	to  accelerate  ies   	industrializa-
			   	tion,  China  must  either  lower  its  capital  coefficient,   	increase  its  savings
			   	rate  or  borrow  foreign  capital.
			   	5.    	Increase  of  Savings  Rate														     	_
			   	Prospects   	for  the  ~urrent  10-Year  Plan--The  Chinese  Government  published
	  	=		 	a  plan  ta  expand  its  agriculture  by  4  to  5  percent  and  its  industry  by				  	~
			   	10  to  11  percent  annually  before  1985  which  means  an  annual  GNP  growth
	 	-		 	of  more  than  8  percent.    	In  this  connection,  R.   	F.   	(Denbaaga)   	and					   	-
			    	(Fuaasenfuesuto)   	estimated  the  annual  growth  rate  at  a"pessimistic"
			   	6.5  percent   	in  Cheir  latest  report  to  Che  U.S.   	~oinC  congressional  com-
	  	'		 	mitCee.
			   	On  the  basis  of  the  above  arithmetic,   	if  the  savings  rate  is  raised  by
			   	25  percent  and  the  marginal  capital  coefficient  lowered  to  3.5   	(3.0),   	the
			   	growth  rate  will  become  7.1   	(8.3)   	percent.    	Naturally  if  China  borrows
	 	-		  	foreign  capital  ae   	it  is  doing  now,   	it  will  be  able  to  raise  its  growth
			   	rate  correspondingly.    	OI1  the  basis  of  thp  GNP  indicated,  a  percenC  of
			   	savings  rate  is  equivalent  to  above  $3  billion.    	When  the  capital  coeffi-
			   	cient  is  3.5,  an  increase  of  savings  rate  by  2  percent  will  raise  the				   	-
			   	growth  rate  by  about  0.6  percent.
			   	China  is  confronted  with  a  shortage  of  domestic  savings  and  of  capital  in			   	-
			   	its  attempt  to  accelerate  its  industrialization.    	Although  the  presenC				 	-
			   	rate  of  family  savings  is  still  high,   	can  the  savings  rate  be  raised?    	At
			   	least  the  enterprises  must  increase  Cheir  efficiency  and  profits.    	To

					  	perhape  China's  Achilles'   	heel  in  its  economic  development.
					  	Trade  Relations  Between  Japan  and  China
					  	The  China  boom  also  caught  on  in  Japan  last  year.    	But  in  Japan  the  sit-
					  	uation  is  different   	from  thaC  in  the  UniCed  SCates.    	Fiere  the  economic
					   	fact~r  ia  stronger  than  the  political  one.    	In  fact  we  can  say  Che  factor
	     	,			   	of  selling  to  China  is   	the  strongeat.    	China  is  a  highly  attractive  markeC			_
					   	for  Weatern  enterprises  which  are  plagued  by  depresaion.    	However,   	if
					   	Chinese  products  cannot  be  sald  abroad,  problems  of  accrued  debt  will  aoon
					   	sur.face  in  China.    	In  the  f~cllowing  we  shall  discuss   	the  trade  relations
					  	between  Japan  and  China,   	limiting  ourae].ves  only  Co  the  aspects  of  Crade
					   	and  investment.
					   	1.    	Import  of  Light  Industrial  Products
					   	Imbalance  of  Japan-China  Trade--In  Table  4  it  is  estimated  that  in  1977
					   	Japan's  share  in  China's  total  import  volume  was  30  percent;  but  China's
	     	~			   	share  in  Japan's  was  only  2.2  percent.    	Since  Japan  imports  little  from
					   	China,  Japan  takes  in  only  about  20  percent  of  China's  exporCs.
					   	',Jhen  the  degree  of  reliance  on  trade  with  Japan  is  high,   	China  becomes
					   	aub~ect  to  fluctuations  in  the  Japanese  economy.    	Consequently  China  is		    	-
					   	probably  trying  to  avoid  concentrating  on  a  small  number  of  trading  part-
					   	ners   	to  minimize  the  riek.    	In  this  connection,  China's  foreign  exchange
					   	policy  is   	to  keep  Che  official  rate  close  to  the  arbitrate~d  raCe.    	But
					   	the  RMB  is  strongly  affected  by  the  fluctuation  of  the  U.S.  dollar.
					   	China's  reliance  on  imports  wae  2.3  percent  in  1975,  but  increase  in  the
					   	import  of  industrial  plants  pushed  the  rate  up  in  1978.    	If  the  exchange
					   	rate  ia  not  lowered,  China  will  have  to  �inance  its  increased  imports  by
					   	exports  and  borrowing  of  foreign  exchange.    	China  has  a  large  favorable
					   	balance  of  trade  with  Hong  Kong   	(ENTRi~OT  trade  included)   	and  there  is  no			_
					   	need  to  balance  it.    	But  what  can  Japan  import  from  China?    	One  might
			'			    	think  it  is  only  a  question'of  balancing  the  figures;  however,   	it  is  not		  	-
					   	thaC  simple.    	Indeed  we  can  import  some  industrial  raw  maCerials  in  addi-
					   	tion  to  oil,   	but  we  must  also  import  some  general  light  industrial  products
					   	such  as  textiles  in  addition  to  marine  products  which  we  are  currently

				     	2.    	Abrupt  Change  in  Foreign  Policy
						Investment  and  Technical  Cooperation--China's  adoption  of  a  flexible
						foreign  policy  to  facilitate  technological  innovation  cun  be  seen  from
						its  aCtempts   	toward  consignment  processing,  compensation  trade  nnd  Che
				     	drafting  of  a  patent  law.    	In  addition,   	the  Chinese  Government  has
						recently  been  considering  the  acceptance  of  direct   	foreign  investmenC
				     	with  the  condition  of  being  able  to  buy  the  foreign  inv~sCment  and
				     	nationalize  the  enterprise  after  about  10  years.
	   	�																							     	-
				     	As  a  matter  of  fact,  Chinese  officials  in  the  investigatien  departmenCs  of
						the  policy~making  authorities  have  shown  a  very  strong  in?.~erest  in  invest-
				     	ment  agreements  under  the  condition  of  nationalizations.    	But  it  seems
						they  are  still  unable  to  evaluaCe  even  the  merits  of  coc;signment  processing,
				 	.     	which  is  one  stage  before  investment  agreement.    	Consequently,   	this  author
						believes   	the  changes  have  been  too  abrupt.    	Japan's  rate  of  domestic
						savings  tends   	to  be  roo  high  and  we  have  also  developed  various  tech-
	    	~			  	nologies  suitable  to  Chinese  conditions.    	Furthermore,   	the  Chinese  system
						of  enterprise  and  personnel  management  is  far  closer   	to  Japan's  than  to
						that  adopted  in  Europe  or  the  United  States.    	Ther~fore  it  is  easy  for
						Japan  to  cooperate  with  Ctiina  in  areas  such  as  providing  lo,zns  �~r  offering
						technological  know-how.    	In  the  meantime,   	the  cost   	f~r  personnel  exchanges
						is  also  relatively  lower.
						3.    	Establishment  of  a  Japan-China  Cooperation  Fund
						Business  should  be  carried  out  at  the  businessmen's  own  risk.    	The  govern-		 	~
	   	-			  	ment  should  limit  itself  to  beating  the  Western  countries  in  reducing
						tension  in  the  COCOM  (Coordinating  Committee  for  Export  Control),   	offer-
						ing  preferential  duties  and  easing  conditions  for  loans  to  China.

					  	s~id:    	"T}~is  new  move  seems  to  be  pert  of  China's  efforC~  tn  correct   	its
					  	overly  ~mbiCious  modernization  plnns.    	I  believe  thaC  it  representa  II~n1~C}?
					  	change  in  Ci~ina's  economic  consCruction  program  and  reflecCg  China'~  deaire
					  	to  be  more  pracCical   	in  its  planning.    	China  hns  thus  f~~r  persistently  sought
					  	to  obt;~in  the  most  up-to-date  technology  and  nothing  but  ultramodern  equip-
					  	ment  in  its  purchase  dealing~  with  Japan.    	The  Baoshan  Iron  Plent  mosC  vivid-
					  	ly  reflects  this  persistent  Chinese  effort:    	the  iron  plant  is  using  a
					  	computerized  system  in  its  operaCions.    	However,   	successive  imports  of
	    	~			     	ultramodern  equipment   	in  carrying  out  its  plant  construction  pro3ects  have	     	-
					  	resulted  in  a  shorzage  of  funds  and  technicians,  and  an  inabiliCy  to  cope
					  	with  t}~e  inflow  of  up-to-date  facilities.    	This  is  why  China  has  now  begun
					  	to  review  its  modernization  plans  and   	frozen  its  plant  import  contracts
					  	with  foreign  countries.    	AbouC  30  contracts--valued  ~t  some  580  billion  yen--
	   	-			     	involve  Japanese   	firms.
					  	According  to  the  government  official~  Vice  Premier  Kang--the  highest  official
					  	in  ct~arge  of  China's  modernization  program--told  patenC  office  director
					  	Kumay~~:    	"From  now  on  China  will  not  necessarily  stick  to  its  past  practice
					  	of  seeking  only  to  introduce  ultramodern  machinery  and  planCS.    	We  now  feel
					  	that  China's  reality  requires  us  to  buy  facilities  which  were  produced   	in
					  	the  late  1960's  or  the  early  1970's."
					  	This  is  the  first  time  a  Chinese  leader  has  expressed  China's  interests  in
		 	~			 	purchasing  "old   	types  of  machinery."    	By  purchasing  old  types  of  machinery~"	 	.
					  	and  faci.lities  China  will  be  relieved  from  the  need  to  turn  out  skilled
					  	technicians  in  a  hurry,  while  resolving  its  problem  of  lack  of  funds.

			     	They  eaid  Che  decision  by  the  China  National  Technical  Import  Corporation

		-		     	Mitsui  &  Co.
					Thie  is  the  first  time  that  China  hae  decided  to  abrogate  plant  equipment
					importanC  contract~  with  Japanese  firms.
					In  February,  China  unilaterally  told  Japanese  companies  that  it  would
					shelve  implementation  of  22  deals  value~d  at  580  billion  yen  ($2.9  billion),
					including  one  for  construcCion  of  a  large  steel  mill  at  Paoshan  near
		~		     	5hanghai.    	Peking  cited  a  review  of  its  economic  development  plans  as  the
					reason  for  the  action.
					The  Chinese  notice  to  annul  the  two  contracts  came  as  renegotiations  are
					going  on  in  Peking  on  some  of  the  22  suspended  plant  export  deals.				     	-
					The  sources  said  that  Japanese  firms  were  shock~~  at  the  move  as  it  came
					on  the  heels  of  a  remark  Wedneaday  by  Chine&e  Vice  Premier  Deng  Xiaoping
					to  a  Japanese  parliamentary  delegation  in  Peking  that  China  wants  to  re-
					solve  the  question  of  shelved  conCracts  as  quickly  as  possible.					   	_
					According  to  the  sources,   	the  two  contracts  which  China  wants  to  abrogate
					involve  two  ethylene  plants,   	each  with  an  annual  production  capacity  of
					300,000  tons,   	to  be  built  in  Peking  and  Man~in.
					China  signed  another  contract  for  two  more  ethylene  plants  of  the  same

					ing  global  supply  siCuation.
					In  the  talke  before  mid-February,   	the  two  nation's  agreed  that   	(1)  Japan
					would  undertake  the  whole  procesa  from  prospecting  to  developmenC  and  even

					(2)  The  total  pro~ect  cost  would  be  fixed  at  around  400  yen  billion;  and
					(3)  Japan  would  take  abouC  2,000,000  tona  of  crude  a  year,
					However,   	the  source  said  China  has  presenCed  new  conditions:    	(1)  Japan
					would  make  a  loan  of  $200  million  and  if  China  atruck  oil,   	the  loan  would
					be  paid  back  in  crude  oil  to  Japan,  but  if  China  failed  to  find  oil,  Japan
					would  noC  ask  for  Che  repayment  of  the  loan--eo-called  riak  basis;   	(2)   	If
					China  succeeded  in  finding  oil,   	the  volume  of  oil  Japan  would  take  would  be
