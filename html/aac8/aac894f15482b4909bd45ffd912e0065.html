 BRIEFING FOR OCD
 STAFF COLLEGE, Battle Creek
 I propose to concentrate this morning on the
 two major threats to the West--the Soviet Union and
 Communist China--and then,as time permits, take up
 Vietnam and Southeast Asia,  the Cuban threat to Latin
 America,  and a quick look at some of the world's other
 trouble spots.
 A word on the ground rules:   You may get the feeling
 that some of the material I cover corresponds to what
 you have already received from the press, radio,  and TV.
 Technically, however, we classify the material I
 am going to cover as "SECRET," not because we are
 unaware that it has been in print, but because I am
 summing up for you the findings of the U.S. Government
 intelligence services.  Some press reports are right,
 and some are wrong, and the Communists are welcome to
 read our newspapers, but we do not want to hand the
 opposition the judgments of the U.S.  intelligence services,
 STATINTL             as expressed by a representative of the Central Intelligence
 Agency.

 Leadership
 I.         The men who threw Khrushchev out of the Kremlin
 more than three
 y%E&Rdy&    }y  years ago have now had time to
 establish their policies,  their relationships,
 and their way of doing business.
 A.   What has emerged is essentially a collective
 leadership.
 1.   I think it was George Orwell, however,
 who advanced the thesis that under Commu-
 nism some people are more equal than others,
 and this seems to apply to the Secretary-
 General of the Communist Party, Leonid
 Brezhnev.
 2.   Brezhnev's standing has been growing
 steadily.   He appears at least to be first
 among equals.
 3.   But the major decisions,  by and large,  are
 apparently reached by compromise, and im-
 plemented with caution.
 B.    This type of collective leadership eliminates
 the erratic initiatives Khrushchev was noted
 for, and it reduces the chances of making big
 mistakes,   It has two inherent weaknesses,
 however.

 Approved For Re. ase 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP79T0Q,%27A001100050002-9
 1.       First,  there is a built:-in tendency  to
 :rock  UI  postpone  the hard decisions.
 For  instance, such highly political prob-
 lems as economic reform,  and the alloca-
 Lion cal'                                               critical resources,  have not been
 resolved.
 2.       Second,    the government develops a split
 personality, with collective leadership
 on  the surface, while a subtle struggle
 for power and position continues under
 cover.
 C.   The present leaders are a blend of mixed in-
 terests and authority, and whatever they may
 now th'nk of the one-man regimes of Stalin
 and Khrushchev,  that's where they learned the
 game.
 1.    They have not yet demonstrated that their
 machinery can make the hard decisions over
 the long run, and at the same time check
 the natural drift toward one-man rule.
 2.    So far,  they have held together remark-
 ably well, mainly by undramatic, middle-
 of-the-road policies.   The guiding
 principle has been:   "Don't rock the boat."

 Approved For Reuse 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP79T0$27A001100050002-9
 II.   This Kremlin rule-by-committee in no sense implies
 any weakening of the major thrust of Soviet foreign
 policy, which continues to center on the expansion
 of Russian influence beyond the borders of the
 Soviet Union.
 A.    The Cold War did not end with the Cuban missile
 crisis,  the fall of Khrushchev,  the nuclear
 test ban treaty,  or the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 B.    Rather,  the Cold War has changed its character
 and its tactics.   It is more political, more
 subtle, more gradual.   The goals remain the
 same.
 C.    The low-keyed style of Brezhnev and Kosygin,
 in fact,  is probably better suited to the Cold
 War and the nuclear stalemate, as they now
 stand,  than the flamboyance of Khrushchev.
 Military
 III.    One good measure of Communist commitment to the
 continuation of the Cold War is to examine what
 the Russians are doing to prepare for a possible
 "Hot War."      For several years the Soviet Union
 has been putting a major effort into a dynamic
 program of military research and development,
 looking for some kind of a breakthrough that

 Approved For Rejoase 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP79TOQ027AO01100050002-9
 might end the nuclear stalemate and swing the
 balance of power in Soviet favor.
 (CHART,   SOVIET DEFENSE SPENDING)
 A.   Soviet spending for defense and space
 according to all of the evidence we have on their
 fed
 various weapons programs, amounts to 20.4 billion
 rubles--the largest budget since World War Two.
 This is buying them a military posture and a
 space program that would cost about 56 billion dollars
 in this country.
 1.    If you take our defense budget for Fiscal 1967,
 and lop off approximately 19 billion dollars
 for expenditures directly related to the fighting
 in Vietnam,  the answer is also 56 billion dollars.
 2.    In other words, the Soviets--with an economy which
 is less than half the size of ours--are sustaining
 a comparable military and space effort.
 3.    For a completely valid comparison, we have to add
 certain expenditures of NASA and the Atomic Energy
 Commission to the U.S. defense budget.   On that
 basis,  again excluding our direct Vietnam spending,
 the comparable cost here of the Soviet military and
 space effort for the past five years has averaged
 85 percent of what we have been apending on the
 same programs.
 B.   The Soviets have announced that they are going to
 -3A-

 Approved For Reease 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP79TOO827AO01100050002-9
 increase their defense and space spending by
 .ms
 15 percent zaamit year.
 1.   As you can see from this chart, the actual
 spending does not always increase in direct
 proportion to the publicly announced budget,
 which is considerably smaller.
 2.   We estimate, however,  that total Soviet
 spending is 1968 will be around 23 billion
 rubles,  for programs which would cost them
 in the vicinity of $60 billion dollars at
 our prices.
 C.      About one third of the Soviet defense expend-
 itures are going for strategic offense and
 strategic defense.   The bulk of this share is
 going into research and development, or into
 sophisticated military hardware for advanced
 weapons systems.
 D.    The Soviets have not achieved the breakthrough
 they have been looking for, and we have no in-
 dications that they may be on the verge of one.
 1.   They are however,  improving across the
 board,  particularly in their strategic of-
 fensive and defensive capabilities.
 E.   They remain behind the United States in the
 number of warheads each can deliver on the
 territory of the other.

 Approved For RaWase 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP79TON27A001100050002-9
 1.    There is, however, a new deployment program
 under way for ICBM's which is a Soviet bid
 to catch up with us numerically.
 F.   At the same time, as you may have seen in the
 accounts of Secretary McNamara's congressional
 testimony,  they are deploying a defensive system
 around Moscow designed to intercept incoming
 ballistic missiles.
 1.    We do not consider this a very effective
 system. It can be fooled,  and it can be
 overwhelmed.
 2.    Also,   it is being deployed only around Mos-
 cow.                                              There is another system being deployed
 on a large scale over much of the Soviet
 Union,  but this second system does not ap-
 pear to have all the elements essential to
 a ballistic missile defense.
 IV.    The important conclusion to be drawn from everything
 we know about the Soviet military establishment is
 this:
 A.   The Soviets continue to increase their military
 budget and their effort to achieve a major
 breakthrough.
 B.   Over the next few years,  the resulting improve-
 ments are going to give the Soviet leaders

 Approved For R  ase 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP79TO  27A001100050002-9
 increasing confidence that they are creating
 an effective deterrent,  in the form of a mili-
 tary machine which can undergo nuclear attack,
 and still deliver enough punch to destroy a
 significant portion of the population and re-
 sources of the United States.
 C.   We do not believe that the Soviets themselves
 expect to be strong enough--even over the next
 ten years--to consider the deliberate initia-
 tion of a war against the United States.
 D.   But growing confidence in offensive and de-
 fensive capabilities is one of the factors
 which could lead to disastrous miscalculations
 when two countries are trying to face each
 other down, at the brink of a war which neither
 may want.

 Union                  think  little enough of  the
 anti -ballistic. missile so  that  their strategy
 centers on evacuation,        as this diagram in-
 dicates .
 1. The Soviet civil defense program stresses
 low-cost approaches to population protection.
 It incorporates
 basement-type         shelters of World War II
 vintage, with little protection against nuclear
 blast or fall--out.
 2.    In Moscow and other major cities, subway sta-
 tions have blast doors,  and there are booklets
 telling the individual citizen how he can re-
 inforce a root cellar,  basement,  or silage pit
 to serve as a shelter. Many apartments built
 since 1950 have reinforced basement areas.
 3.    There is no organized program to mark,  improve,
 and stock adaptable public shelter areas.
 4.    Existing shelter areas are probably sufficient
 tot ca-C
 for 10 to 15 percent of the         population.
 B.   The Soviet civil defense program, in other words,
 relies on sufficient  warning  to evacuate urban
 areas,  and  tMiPhtLsrze.S
 protection for the command and control mechanism,
 planning for reception of the evacuees in the

 countryside,  and rescue and recovery after
 the thermonuclear exchange begins.
 (TABLE OF ORGANIZATION,  SOVIET CIVIL DEFENSE)
 B.    Until about 1960, Soviet Civil Defense was un-
 der the MVD,  or Ministry of Internal Affairs.
 .In 1960 it was transferred, as this Table of
 Organization shows, to the Ministry of Defense,
 and specifically to the Commander-in-Chief of
 Ime.,
 the Ground Forces   Marshal Chuikov.
 1.   The Table of Organization parallels mili-
 tary command channels down to the local
 level, and military officers who have completed
 a t'             civil defense staff school are
 assigned to civil defense staffs as far down
 as city headquarters.

 3.y- level, civil defense becomes
 the responsibility of the civilian leaders
 who correspond to governors, mayors,  plant
 managers, and the.like in the United States.
 4.    The responsibility for establishing and
 preparing shelters also seems to devolve
 Approved For Release 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP79T00827AO01100050002-9
 Approved For Rdt ase 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP79TO  27AO01100050002-9 ( i)
 to the local level, where a combination
 of apathy and shortage of funds has re-
 sulted in a program which by and large
 will apparently not begin providing the
 necessary shelters until an emergency is
 declared.
 5.    Citizens are subject to compulsory train-
 ing, however, and are obligated to serve
 if selected for civil defense duty. There
 are about 100 civil defense schools scat-
 tered across the Soviet Union,  and as much
 as half of the population has probably
 been exposed to some instruction in civil
 defense.   The Soviets are probably behind
 us in shelter preparation,  but ahead of us
 in drills involving large public participa-
 tion.
 C.            In short, the main emphasis in Soviet Civil
 Defense today appears to be on preparations to
 maintain the processes of government, to try to
 limit casualties,  and to provide rescue and
 repair services after an attack.
 Soviet Relations With United States
 VI.   I want to touch briefly on just two facets of So-
 viet foreign policy--relations with the United
 States,     and the Sino-Soviet dispute.

 Approved For Rase 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP79TMY$27A001100050002-9
 VII.  In public,  Soviet spokesmen are taking the line
 that any improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations is
 going to be virtually impossible as long as we
 are attacking their Communist brethren in North
 Vietnam.
 They
 are practically forced to take this stand be-
 cause the Chinese Communists are accusing the
 Kremlin of working with the United States
 against North Vietnam.
 B.   In fact, however,  Soviet leaders have made it
 clear that they want to avoid any showdown
 with Washington over the Vietnamese issue.
 C.   They are,  of course, delighted to see major
 portions of our forces tied down in Vietnam,
 but they also realize that they must keep
 their lines to Washington open and working,
 if they want any progress on the issues that
 really concern them--such as European security,
 arms control, Germany, and East-West trade.

 The Sino-Soviet Dispute
 VIII.     As for the status of the Sino-Soviet dispute, re-
 lations between Moscow and Peking have hit rock-
 bottom, and we do not expect to see any improve-
 ment as long as the present leaderships remain in
 control at each end of the line.
 A.   The Chinese have been doing their best        -
 4            to goad Moscow into a final break
 in diplomatic relations.
 B.   Moscow is trying to hang on, and build a re-
 cord which can be used to pin the blame on
 the Chinese if it comes to a final break.
 C.   What is at stake is the supply line to North
 Vietnam,   Each country wants to be able to
 prove that it is the major support of the
 North Vietnamese, and that the other country
 is just sitting on its hands,  if not actually
 hindering the war effort.
 D.   One important bit of background information
 is that the port of Haiphong in North Vietnam,
 whatever the headlines may say,  is not a major
 factor in the supply of weapons to North Vietnam.
 1.    We know what goes into Haiphong.   Ships
 have brought in half a dozen big helicopters,

 batch of small arms or ammunition.   Oil
 and gas,  and some trucks,  of course,  are
 shipped in by sea.
 2.   But the weapons,  and the bulk of the war
 materiel generally, come in overland,
 across China.
 3.   To a great degree, this is because of
 Soviet reluctance to risk a confrontation
 with the United States on the high seas.
 4.   And this is precisely the confrontation
 the Chinese Communists want to bring
 about.
 E.    Moscow has charged that the Chinese are divert-
 ing, delaying, sabotaging, stealing, and even
 re-labeling Soviet war materiel passing through
 China to Vietnam.
 F.    The Chinese, on the other hand,  have accused
 Moscow of "cowardice" for refusing to ship by
 sea.   Peking probably believes that in a pinch,
 the Soviets would still refuse, and Peking
 could then tell the world Communist parties
 that Russia had abandoned the North Vietnamese,
 rather than face up to American sea power.

 I.   Communist China itself has been rocked for almost twb
 & year$now by the upheaval they call the Cul-
 tural Revolution.
 A.    You have all seen pictures of swarms of Chi-
 nese teen-agers on the march, holding little
 red books from which they chant quotations
 of Mao Tse-tung.
 B.    In China today, Mao's quotations are credited
 with almost miraculous power, although for
 the most part they are a collection of tired
 old cliches like "All power comes out of the
 barrel of a gun," or "Be resolute,  fear no
 sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to
 win Victory."
 1.   Peking radio says fighter pilots shouted
 Mao's thoughts over the intercom as they
 started a dog-fight, and were therefore
 able to shoot down a Chinese Nationalist
 aircraft.
 2.   A forestry conference in Peking concluded
 that the study of Mao would enable the
 Forestry Service to grow better trees.

 3.    A worker in Lanchou, who broke an arm,
 a leg and several ribs in a fall on the
 job, was reported to have refused sick
 leave, because Mao's thoughts enabled
 him to live with the pain.
 II.    To us, it sounds ridiculous, but for the Chinese
 it is in deadly earnest.
 A.    Mao, at 74,  is aging,  sick, and more and more
 inflexible.   He is obviously concerned that
 his Communist party is losing the revolution-
 ary zeal of its early days, and cannot be re-
 lied upon to keep China on the right track
 after he is gone.
 1.   The teen-aged millions of the Red Guards
 are supposed to rekindle that zeal with
 their unbridled and uncritical enthusi-
 asm
 B.    To Mao, then, the Cultural Revolution is
 primarily a drive to reinvigorate the Commu-
 nist Party, or even to replace it with a
 more reliable, more fanatical, younger version.
 C.    But for the men who are competing to succeed
 Mao, it has become a naked struggle for power
 and for survival.

 III.    Defense Minister Lin Piao was proclaimed Mao's Pm1 c-C.llve
 successor tvl /4ugVSt) J 9bb,  He immediately began mov-
 ing against any potential rivals.
 A.   His main targets were the men who have been
 at the top of the party machinery, Chief of
 State Liu Shao-chi, who used to rank second
 in the hierarchy, and the party secretary-
 general, Teng Hsiao-ping.
 B.   Today, Liu and Teng have virtually disappeared
 from public view,  and Lin Piao, next to Mao,
 gets top billing, but one of the dominant figures
 in Peking is the Prime Minister,  Chou En-lai.
 1.    Chou represents the. government,  as Lin
 represents the armed forces,and Liu and
 Teng spoke for the party.  If there is such
 a thing in Communist China, Chou is a relative
 moderate.   His main concern has been to keep
 the government and the economy running.
 C.    As the cultural revolution unfolded,  three
 significant things happened:
 1--Some of the provincial bosses--the men who
 owed their jobs to Liu and Teng, and who run
 their bailiwicks a long way from Peking--

 2--The Red Guard mobs generated their own
 momentum, and to this day some of them do
 not respond to direct orders from Mao and
 the men around him.
 3--Industry,     agriculture,  and public order
 threatened to break down as the administrative
 machinery creaked to a halt.
 D.    All this was a source of grave concern to
 Chou and the government administrators under
 him.
 1.    We also believe that Mao and Lin learned that
 they could not count completely on the loyalty
 of the troop commanders and troops.
 Otherwise, they probably would have used
 the army at an early stage to crush the
 resistance of some of the provincial
 bosses.
 2.   Instead, there have been pitched battles
 between Red Guards and workers, between
 rival Red Guard organizations, and in
 some cases between Red Guards and regular
 troops.

 E.   It is a fair conclusion that the excesses of
 the Cultural. Revolution at least twice approached
 the level where there was a threat of civil war,
 along with the breakdown of such services as
 transportation and food distribution.
 1.    I might be stretching it to say that a
 sort of "Third Force" came into being
 and made Mao moderate the purge, but the
 fact remains that in January and again in
 August, the brakes were put on the Cultural
 Revolution.
 2.    For the last half of 1967, the regime has

 divided and in conflict. They will find it dif-
 ficult to agree to any new policy: line, so we do
 not expect any radical departures from existing
 policies.
 --Second,  for some time to come, the Chinese Com-
 munists will probably suffer from a Cultural Rev-
 olution hangover that could limit their capacity
 to engage in foreign adventures.

 to expect any dilution of Peking's implacable
 hostility toward the United States.

 Chinese Military Power
 I.   At the time the Sino-Soviet dispute began in 1960,
 when the Soviet Union cut off all aid to Commu-
 nist China, Peking was left with the determina-
 tion to renounce co-existence and stand the Free
 World on its ear, but very little by way of assets
 to do the job.
 A.   We have measured their armed forces in Korea.
 They have the capability to overrun any of
 China's mainland neighbors--Russia excepted,
 of course--but only as long as they do not
 encounter significant opposition from a major
 power.
 1.    The army, is still basically a sub-standard
 World War Two Army.   There are'About 2,300,000
 men,  in about 100 infantry and a dozen armored
 or artillery divisions, but they are short on
 armor, heavy ordnance, mechanized transport
 and fuel.
 2.   The MIG-15s and 17a which the Chinese air
 force got from the Russians, or built with
 their help, are outdated, and the under-
 trained Communist pilots flying them have
 been outfought by Chinese Nationalists;

 3.   The navy has the world's fourth largest
 submarine fleet, but no sea-keeping ex-
 perience; it is a coastal defense force.
 B.   If we were concerned solely with the con-
 ventional Chinese forces, that would just
 about cover the subject.
 II.    But the fact is that over the past three years,
 the Chinese Communists have more than made up
 for the loss of Soviet assistance in 1960, and
 have emerged with their own family of advanced
 weapons systems.
 A.   They have done it entirely on their own, and
 the major achievement, of course, has been
 the development of a nuclear capability.
 B.   At present,  the Chinese nuclear weapons
 capability is crude and limited by our

 III.         We believe that the Chinese have been developing
 a medium-range missile with a reach of about
 1,000 nautical miles, and that they are about to
 begin deploying operational missiles of this
 type, with nuclear warheads.
 A.   From the borders of China, a medium-range
 missile can cover all of Japan and the
 Philippines,  a good share of Indonesia, all
 of Southeast Asia and South Asia, and
 Eastern and Southern Russia as far as the
 Caspian Sea.

 if they start testing soon.
 C.    The Chinese have assembled one copy of a
 Soviet submarine which can launch three
 ballistic missiles with a 350-mile range,
 but only when surfaced.
 1.   They may not yet have developed the missile
 for this submarine, and as I said, they have
 no experience in extended operations, but
 they certainly did not build this submarine
 for conventional coastal defense purposes.
 D.    Chinese factories are beginning to turn out
 advanced aircraft to replace and supplement
 their obsolescent air force inventory.
 1.   Over the past two years they have produced
 enough copies of the MIG-l9 so that they
 were able to spare some for Pakistan.
 2.   We expect that they will soon begin turning
 out Chinese versions of the MIG-21 and the
 Soviet BADGEU  jet medium bomber.
 Chinese Foreign Policy

 we must bear in mind that they are an ancient people

 who used to call their empire the "Middle Kingdom,"
 because to them it was the center of the world.
 (MAP,  "PEKING'S LOST EMPIRE")
 A.    This map,      for instance, published in a Chinese
 Communist history textbook,  shows areas once
 under Chinese domination which they complain
 were seized from the crumbling Chinese empire
 by unfair treaties with Russia.
 1.   You can see that their claims also extend
 to all of Southeast Asia, and even parts
 of India and Pakistan.
 (MAP, PEKING GEOCENTRIC)
 B.      This map appears to be upside down; actually,
 it is a geocentric map, centered on Peking,
 showing the Far East as it appears strategically
 to the Chinese.
 1.    From this viewpoint, Southeast Asia is a
 natural ante-room for China and not just
 Taiwan, but the Japanese, Philippine and
 Indonesian archipelagoes are China's
 offshore islands.
 2.    Bear in mind that most Of the countries
 south of China have at one time or

 another been vassals or tributaries
 of the Middle Kingdom, and that
 Southeast Asia is normally a rice
 surplus area.   China, on the other
 hand,  is less than 15 percent arable,
 and over the past decade the popula-
 tion has grown by more than 20 percent
 while food production has either stood
 still or--in bad years--decreased.
 V.   Part of the Chinese grudge against Moscow, then,  is
 not an ideological dispute with the Soviet Union,
 but an inherent desire to reclaim Chinese territory
 seized by Imperial Russia.
 A.    The Russians,  like us, are by and large a
 people of Caucasian stock, and therefore the
 Chinese on racial grounds can hate Russians
 and Americans with equal fervor, because we
 are foreign devils, and white foreign devils
 to boot.
 B.    But their hostility toward the United States
 is more implacable and more enduring for two
 reasons.
 C.    Firstly, we are the world's champions of free
 enterprise,  and the Chinese as basic Marxists

 believe that war between Communism and Capitalism
 is inevitable.
 D.    Secondly, World War II not only carried American
 influence to the far shores of the Pacific, but
 left us the only Free World nation with the
 power and the motivation to contain the Chinese
 Communists within their own borders in the Far
 East.
 E.   The Chinese, then, hate us because we are
 foreigners, because we are capitalists, and
 because we are there.
 VI. Elrushchev is reported to have commented at one
 time that Mao's strategy would welcome global
 thermonuclear war, because China was the only
 country that could lose 300 million people and
 still survive as a nation;.
 A.    This is bound to play some part in Chinese
 Communist thinking, but for the present,
 despite all the belligerent Peking propa-
 ganda about: support for North Vietnam, we
 think that there are probably only three cir-
 cumstances in which the Chinese would feel
 obliged to intervene there with military
 force.

 B,    ONE would be in the event of U.S. air strikes
 against China itself.
 C.    The SECOND would be a major U.S.  invasion of
 North Vietnam.
 D.    And the THIRD would be the threat of imminent
 collapse of the North Vietnamese Government.
 E.    This analysis, of course, is based to some
 extent on a Rational Chinese assessment of
 their national interests.   So we find it
 necessary,  in making this evaluation, to
 point out that there is nothing in the recent
 track record of Mao Tse-tung to guarantee that
 his decisions are going to based on rational
 assessaients.

 I.   Obviously, then, we cannot dismiss out of hand the
 possibility of a shooting war with Communist China,
 and the nations of Southeast Asia have even more
 reason to be apprehensive.   Let's take a quick look
 around Southeast Asia.
 (Map, FE and SEA)
 Indonesia
 II.   Until recently, the'100 million people of Indonesia, s
 with extensive potential resources and important
 strategic  geography,  were sliding slowly but
 surely into the grasp of Peking.
 A.    The Chinese didn't have to build a single
 landing craft, or make a belligerent gesture.
 They simply built up the Communist party of
 Indonesia,  supported and guided it, and
 convinced President Sukarno that Chinese Com-
 munism was the wave of the future.
 B.      The pro-Western Indonesian Army had almost
 been neutralized; the anti-Communist political
 parties had been banned or placed under tight
 controls; and the air force and navy were under
 pro-Communist leadership, when a badly timed

 and bungled coup attempt gave the army
 leaders a chance to turn the tables.
 C.          Today, the Communist Party of Indonesia has
 been shattered., and General Suharto has
 completed the delicate and difficult
 job of taking away all power from Sukarno.
 This has been time-consuming because to
 many Indonesians Sukarno is still a combina-
 tion of George Washington and Mohammed,--
 with a considerable dash of Don Juan.
 D.   But the process has been something like
 saving a hunter from the wolves, only to
 find that he is dying of starvation.   If
 it were possible to bankrupt a nation,
 Indonesia is bankrupt.   It owes more than
 two and a half billion dollars.   Just to
 put the economy on a survival basis is
 going to take years of careful planning,
 international cooperation on re-scheduling
 debts, and heavy infusions of financial help,.

 A.    The volatile ruler, Prince Sihanouk, has
 decided that over the long run the Commu-
 nists, and Communist China in particular,
 are going to be the winners in the Far East.
 B.    He is accordingly trying to take out insurance,
 both for his own future and for that of his
 country, by establishing close relations
 with Peking, and with the North Vietnamese
 and the Viet Cong.
 C.    Recently he may have had some second thoughts,
 partly because of the course of the war in
 Vietnam, partly because the Communists have
 refused to give him the assurances he wants
 on the independence of Cambodia and some
 long-standing border disputes with the
 Vietnamese.
 1.   His thinking is conditioned, however, by
 the historic hostility between Cambodia
 on the one hand, and the Vietnamese and
 the Thais on the other.   This situation
 is not helped by the activities of
 Cambodian exile groups, alternately tol-
 erated and supported by Saigon and Bangkok.

 2.   Sihanouk believes firmly that the Viet-
 namese and the Thais are puppets of the
 United States,  and he therefore also
 holds us responsible for everything the
 South Vietnamese and the Thais do.
 D.    The evidence is that Sihanouk is against
 Viet Cong use of Cambodian territory for re-
 grouping, refuge, and supply lines, but he
 does not have firm control of the remote
 border areas,  so the Vietnamese Communists
 use Cambodian, asylum pretty much as they
 please.
 Laos
 IV.    Laos theoretically was neutralized by the Geneva
 agreements, and is ruled by a coalition government
 of rightists, neutralists, and Communists under
 the neutralist prime minister Prince Souvanna Phouma.
 A.    In actual fact, the principal rightists have
 made grabs for power and been driven from the
 country.   The Communists have hung on to their
 half of Laos, which is vital for the Ho Chi
 Minh trail,  the supply line to South Vietnam.
 They have refused to take the ministries assigned
 to them in the Laotian Government.

 B.    That leaves the neutralists.   The neutralist
 military commander, Kong Le, has been re-
 nounced by his own officers, and shipped
 out of the country, an3the neutralist
 prime minister, Prince Souvanna, has become
 a firm anti-Communist the hard way.
 1.   For one thing, the Communist leader, his
 own half-brother, Prince Souphannouvong,
 has refused to negotiate or even meet
 with him, and has refused to accept the
 authority of the government in the Pathet
 Lao, or Communist, part of the country.
 2.   For another, there are now some 15,000
 North Vietnamese combat troops, and
 another 1:3,000 to 15,000 support troops
 in Laos, showing no signs of leaving.
 C.    The fighting in Laos doesn't hit the headlines
 but it continues.   Guerrillas of the Meo 'tribe,
 fighting on the government side, make a little
 headway in the rainy season,  and then the North
 Vietnamese take it back again in the dry season.
 Last year there were more than 1,600 engagements
 in Laos.   This is truly the "Forgotten War."

 I.   As for Vietnam,  I am not going to give you a blow-
 by-blow on the military progress there; that could
 take all day, without adding too much to what you
 can read in the papers.
 A.    Instead,  I think the military situation can
 be summarized this way:   Since American combat
 troops went in in the middle of 1965, we have
 taken the initiative away from the Communists
 as far as main combat forces are concerned;
 we have prevented them from massing to launch
 an offensive;  and we have inflicted heavy casu-
 alties.
 O
 B.    Last year the Communists lost             ,0C.\ killed in
 action, by actual body count, and another 11,000
 turned themselves in.
 C.    Yet our order of battle shows that the enemy
 has more men than ever under arms--the main combat

 II.   The indications are that the Communist command
 has decided it is too costly at present to fight
 major military engagements against our superior
 fire power and air support.
 A.     They can still put together major formations,
 they have around the border between North
 an   South Vietnam.   There, ou  Marines      at -7bMe,S

 or our own dispositions justify the risk.
 B.       In general, however, the Communists are
 going to try to  void major unit contact, and
 re-emphasize classic guerrilla warfare.
 1.     This shows that`our spoiling operations
 have produced good`results, but it is

 C.     There are no easy solutions.   Some suggest that
 all we have to do is bomb Haiphong and the Ho
 Chi Minh trail.   I have mentioned before that
 the war supplies that reach North Vietnam do not
 come in through Haiphong.   As for the main sup-

 III.    You can use the same summary for political stability,
 and for pacification.   The news is encouraging, but we
 still have a long,  long way to go.

 A.    The Ky regime established enough stability,
 to draft a constitution, elect a legislature,
 and then submit itself successfully for election
 as a constitutional regime rather than a military

 1.   Generals are still running the country,
 but they are running it as the result of
 an election rather than a coup,  and there
 is increasing civilian participation in the

 2.   In four successive elections--for the

 80 percent of the registered voters cast

 80 percent of those who are registered vote,

 going to be made to expand and firm up paci-

 North Vietnamese  generals-running major mili-
 tary commands in South Vietnam since 1964.
 It is interesting to note that there are four mili-
 tary regions, running from north to south, in
 North Vietnam, and the Viet Cong continued the
 same numbering system, starting with Military Re-
 gion FIVE and runningion down across South Vietnam.
 1.   But the two northernmost provinces of SVN are
 in military region FOUR, administered as part
 of the DRV from Hanoi.
 2.   MR FIVE, which runs down to Darlac and Khanh
 Hoa provinces, is commanded by a North Viet-
 namese, Lt. General Hoang Van Thai, who is the
 North Vietnamese Vice Minister of Defense.
 E.  As for the National Liberation Front, which is sup-
 posed to be a coalition of all rebel patriotic ele-
 ments, representative of all of the South Viet-
 namese people, it has five Vice Chairmen-,and at
 least three of the five are known Communists.
 V.   In the final analysis, the Communists know that they
 can no longer win by terrorism or by force of arms in
 South Vietnam;  they can only win by waiting us out, by-
 hoping that the Free World forces which defend South
 Vietnam--and that means mainly the United States--will
 tire of the war and pull out, or be forced out by world
 public opinion.       -42-

 This hope explains-why they show no readiness to
 negotiate.   It, sustains them--and at the same
 time, it is their ultimate vulnerability, be-
 cause if we can make it clear to them that there
 is no such hope, that the beginnings of democracy
 in South Vietnam are going to be defended, not
 deserted--then Hanoi too will finally be forced
 to realize that this particular ball game is over.
 At this point, I propose to skip geographical order,
 and jump to Cuba, because today there are actually three
 brands of Communism--Russian, Chinese, and Cuban--which
 pose a threat to us, and Fidel Castro's efforts to spread
 his revolution in this hemisphere can be particularly
 virulent and violent.

 I.   Fidel Castro, in Cuba, has been endowed by the
 Soviets with the strongest military establishment
 in Latin America.
 A.    Morale is good, especially among the officers.
 The armed forces are loyal to Fidel Castro.
 They are fully capable of maintaininq internal
 order, and they could defend Cuba against any-
 thing short of a large-scale invasion backed
 by U.S. help.
 B.      They have about 150 Soviet surface-to-air
 missile launchers, covering the areas shown by
 the circles on the map.   They have tactical
 surface-to-surface missiles, patrol boats armed
 with missiles,  and MIG-21 jet fighters,  some
 of them with all-weather capabilities.
 1.    Over the Past et months, there has been
 a considerable increase in Soviet military
 shipments.
 2.    Except for the new MIG's and another six
 missile patrol boats, however, these ship-
 ments have  consisted of replacements and

 America.
 (MAP, LATIN AMERICA)
 A.    A couple of years ago the Soviets worked out
 an agreement with Castro that all Communist
 efforts in Latin America would be channeled
 through the orthodox Communist parties in the
 various countries.

 1.   The orthodox Communists today are still
 willing to support a so-called War of
 National Liberation, or stage a
 revolution, when they judge there is a
 chance for success.
 2.   But they also believe that when the odds
 are against insurrection and insurgency,
 they should use opportunities for
 subversion and political action---what
 they call the "peaceful road to power."
 B.    In many countries of Latin America, there are
 dissidents who have left the regular Communist
 Party, forming their own, pro-Chinese and more
 militant wing, faction, or separate party.
 1.   There are also left-wing extremists who
 are not Communists--either Moscow-style or
 Peking-style--and  who are more militant
 than the orthodox party.  An example is
 the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,
 or MIR,  in Venezuela.
 2.   These militants favor instant revolution.
 The MIR launched a guerrilla war in Peru
 two years ago, with Cuban support, training,
 funds, and weapons--and  some from the

 Chinese as well. They have been virtually
 wiped out.
 C.   Moscow, especially since the Cuban missile
 crisis, considers such insurrections too
 wasteful, and too alarming to the West, when
 there isn't a reasonable chance for success.
 That's why Moscow tried to hobble Castro's
 efforts.
 III.  Now Castro has junked the agreement.   He has
 continued all along to train and arm guerrillas
 for other Latin American countries, and support
 them with propaganda.   For the past year or so,
 despite the agreement, he has supported them in
 armed action---in Venezuela, in Colombia, in
 Guatemala, where he considers   the time is ripe
 for action.
 A.        Early this year, Che Guevara and a number of
 Cuban guerrilla leaders launched a new insurgency
 in the remote,, mountainous area of south-eastern
 Bolivia.   The guerrillas were well-trained and
 well-equipped.   Regular Bolivian army conscripts
 could not cope with them, but eventually trained
 counter-insurgency troops eliminated the guerrillas--
 in part because they generated no peasant support.
 In fact,  it was information from a peasant woman
 that led to Guevara's capture and death.

 expand guerrilla assets in Ecuador,  in

 C.       In most of these countries, Castro is either
 working with dissident.Communist parties and
 non-Communist extremists of the left--like
 the guerrillas of Douglas Bravo in Venezuela--
 or, as in Guatemala, with individuals in the

 Africa, and has sent several hundred
 Cubans to the former French Congo to
 train the militia for the leftist
 government there.
 3.   He had instructors with the revolutionaries
 in the former Belgian Congo for a while.
 B. Specifically, however, Castro wants more
 Communist take-overs in the Western Hemisphere.
 He apparently fears that unless his Cuban
 revolution becomes an example for other Latin
 ,American Communists, as he has so often
 predicted, his own dynamism and mystique in
 Cuba could atrophy and eventually lose its

 spots where we have trouble or potential

 II.   INDIA:   India has its fill of troubles--political,
 economic, and military; domestic and foreign.
 A.    The recent elections cut the ruling Congress
 Party of Nehru down to its thinnest parlia-

 the government in majority IT, control of the
 state governments in only l of the 17 states.
 B.    The resulting instability is going to
 complicate the problems of dealing with the
 food crisis--and India is going to need
 massive food imports at least for the next
 several years.
 C.    Externally, the Indians remain apprehensive
 over the belligerent Chinese posture on the
 Himalayan frontier, and there is no progress
 toward a settlement of the Kashmir dispute
 with Pakistan..  There is not likely to be.
 1.    As a number of United Nations commissions
 have found, Pakistan has the stronger
 case, but India has effective possession.

 of their hold on Kashmir would inflame
 other separatist movements in a country
 where there are 14 major linguistic
 groupings and dozens of ethnic sub-
 divisions.
 (MAP MIDDLE EAST)
 III.    In the Middle East, we have excellent examples
 of crises that are never settled, but flare up
 and quiet down repeatedly.
 A.    The prime example, of course,  is the Arab
 Israeli dispute.
 B.    For the third time in 10 years, the Israelis
 proved in June that they are still more than
 a match for the combined Arab forces, but the
 fighting settled nothing.
 C.    The Israelis insist that they will not withdraw
 from areas they- have occupied until the Arabs
 agree to recognize the existence of Israel and
 end the state of belligerency.
 D.    On the Arab side, the Syrians and the Algerians
 want the Arabs to keep on fighting. Nasir,
 however, has prevailed with the relatively
 moderate viewpoint that the Arabs must get back
 what they lost by patience and negotiations with

 the Big Powers   or in the United Nations.   Even
 the moderates, however,  are not prepared to talk
 directly with Israel.
 E.    Meanwhile, the Syrians keep seeding terrorists
 and saboteurs into Israel and the Israeli-occupied
 portion of Jordan,  and Israel will probably soon
 feel it has to stage another retaliatory attack.
 F.    The Soviets are re-arming the Arabs, but it will
 probably take another year just to build weapons
 inventories back to pre-June levels. And
 sheer hardware will do nothing more now than
 it did in June to balance Israeli training
 and motivation.
 G.   One result of the Egyptian defeat in June has
 been to force Nasir to withdraw his troops from
 Yemen.   Belatedly, the Soviets are moving to
 fill the gap;  they are flying in weapons,,
 supplies,  and aircraft for the republican
 1   e Tl    4
 regime, and they may evene-frogsome air
 support missions against the royalists, but
 the capital of Yemen is under heavy attack now.
 The prospect is for continuing,   d indecisive,
 tribal warfare, with outside powers backing
 the various factions.
 IV.     Another crisis that threatens to be permanent is
 Cyprus.
 A. Turkey and Greece were probably both glad that
 outside mediation found a formula which averted

 war.   The trouble is that there is no
 guarantee that the settlement will be
 honored by the third party, Archbishop
 Makarios, the President of Cyprus.
 B.   The Greeks eventually would like to see the
 island become part of Greece, while the Turks
 are interested mainly in safeguarding the
 lives and the rights of the Turkish Cypriot
 minority--about 18 percent of the population.
 C.   Makarios pays lip service to ultimate union
 with Greece, but what he actually wants is
 independence and a,-free hand to run the island.
 The Turks have no confidence that Makarios
 would respect the rights of the Turnish Cypriot
 minority.
 D.   Makarios may ultimately push the Turks too far,
 and incite armed Turkish intervention. We have
 averted this twice, but only at the cost of
 being attacked as pro-Greek by the Turkish press,
 and pro-Turkish by the Greeks.
 V.     The Cyprus problem thus puts the United States
 uncomfortably in the middle,  just as Kashmir does
 with India and Pakistan,  and the area between Cyprus
 and Rashmir remains a prime problem area for the
 United States.
 A.   You may recall that this was where we tried
 to erect what we called the "Northern Tier"--

 with SEATO,  and shield the unstable Middle East
 from Soviet pressure.   Originally, this was the
 Baghdad Pact;  then, when Iraq fell out,  it became
 CENTO.   Its anchors were to be Turkey in NATO,
 and Pakistan in SEATO.
 B.    But we have trouble at both ends of the
 line.
 C.    Pakistan considers India a greater enemy
 than Communism,  and is engaged in a triple
 balancing act.   The Paks still want their
 alliance with us, but they also want arms
 from Communist China,  since we have stopped
 supplying them,  and they are working to
 induce the Soviets to be neutral in the
 Indian-Pakistani disputes.
 D.    The Turks are improving their economic relations
 with the Soviet Union,  accepting Russian aid
 and reviewing their treaties with us to
 ensure that they are not unduly provocative
 to the Russians.
 E.    In the middle of the Northern Tier, the Shah
 of Iran took note of the way Pakistan's
 Western arms sources dried up when the
 fighting began with India.   The Shah is
 convinced that the more extreme Arabs are
 going to attack Iran,  and is concerned that
 he might also be cut off if fighting starts.

 relations with the Soviets,  and has begun to
 buy weapons and other military equipment from
 them.
 F.   At the Western extremity, where the Northern
 Tier should be firmly tied into continental
 Europe, Greece at present is too paralyzed by
 its domestic: troubles to contribute much to
 NATO, or even to work out an amicable
 relationship with the Turks.   The present
 military leaders have no program and little
 ability to run the country.   At present,  it
 is questionable that they could or would
 restore a democratic government with the support
 and stamina to fend off the left-wing forces
 whose growing power provoked the military coup
 last April.

 VI.    Last stop, Africa. There are so many countries,
 and so many actual or potential trouble spots,
 that we have no time to examine them individually,
 so I must generalize.

 A.                                  Africa has a few countries in the South,
 sometimes called the White Redoubt, where
 the countries are still run by and for
 Europeans, or at least Whites of European
 stock.
 1.   As long as this situation exists, there
 are going to be Africans either waving guns
 at the frontiers, or waving speeches in
 the United Nations,  trying to force the
 major powers to step in and clear the
 way for majority African rule.
 2.   Sanctions, by the way, are not going to
 work against Rhodesia as long as South
 Africa and the Portuguese African colonies
 help Rhodesia to evade the full force of
 the sanctions.
 B.   The rest of Africa, by and large, consists of
 new nations where the African leadership is a
 paper-thin  veneer.
 1.   The Chinese Communists and the Russians
 are competing to develop influence over

 some of these men; the Western powers
 are doing their best to support and
 sustain the rest;  and if the two sets
 of African leaders--a handful of men--
 kill each other off or neutralize each
 other, below them there is nothing.
 2.   There are only a handful of viable
 economies at present on the entire
 continent.
 C.    Nigeria nrnhahly had as good a. chance as any
 of the developing natinns in Africa to
 make a go of it.
 1.   It is the most populous country in
 Africa,  it has substantial resources,
 and the British trained good administrators
 before they granted independence.
 2.   The most advanced Nigerians, the Ibos
 of Eastern Nigeria, were the best educated and
 best trained,  so they got most of the
 government jobs, but they were a very small
 minority.
 3.   When some of the larger tribes took out
 their grudges against the Ibos in a blood
 bath,  the Eastern Nigerians tried to secede
 and form a new nation, Biafra.

 the Federal Government has had the upper            4
 hand, but now it has to fight its way into
 the central Ibo tribal area,  and the
 fighting is likely to drag on indefinitely.
 5.    The trouble is that the old colonial boundaries
 do not necessarily result in a cohesive,
 viable nation.   There are more than 200
 separate tribes in Nigeria alone.
 D.   Similarly, the Congo Province of Katanga, Tshombe's
 old stronghold,  is part of the Congo because that's
 the way the Belgians ran it 100 years ago.
 1.    Actuallym, as far as the tribes and the
 natural resources and the communications are
 concerned, Katanga should be a part of
 neighboring Zambia, but Cecil Rhodes grabbed
 that for the British before the Belgians
 pushed that far across Africa.
 E.   Today, you have developing natinns in Africa
 which are aware that they can't run their own
 administrations, economies,  schools, services---
 but because of their former colonial status
 bitterly resent and threaten the foreigners
 woo can still be persuaded to help them do the
 job.
 F.   There is ample evidence in our press today,  and
 even in Congress, of how strong the temptation
 is to pull out and let countries like the Congo
 limp along on. their own, but in the final analysis,
