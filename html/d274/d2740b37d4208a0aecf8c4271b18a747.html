 UNITS, INDIVIDUALS DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES IN BORDER WAR WITH VIETNAM
 Third Battalion
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 2 Apr 79 p 1
 [Article by Li Zhen [2621 3791]:  "Take Lead in Spearheading Attack:  Distinguish
 Selves in Self-Defense Counterattack; 446 Men in 78 Units of Third Battalion of a
 Certain Border Defense Unit Gloriously Distinguish Selves"]
 [Text]  In the course of combat during the self-defense counterattack, the
 commander of the third battalion of a certain Guangxi border defense unit spear-
 headed an attack, outstandingly fulfilling combat duties and winning a silk banner
 bearing the words, "Spearhead Battalion in Storming and Capturing Luongson."
 Four hundred forty-six men in 57 squads, in 16 platoons, in 5 companies
 distinguished themselves with honor.
 In the course of combat during the self-defense counterattack, the commander of
 the third battallion was responsible for making a deep thrust and in continuing to
 advance.  With the ferocity of a tiger and the persistence of Mt. Tai, the
 battalion took only 1 hour and 40 minutes to attack and occupy the Luongson
 Provincial Administrative Committee, and to go on to defend it tenaciously for 7
 days and nights.  In the attack on Phannhien, cadres and soldiers of the eight
 company courageously and stubbornly, fought and attacked ferociously, traversing
 six mountain tops one after another to capture Khoacaosan.  They fought
 continuously, bravely making deep thrusts, attacking and conquering with one fell
 swoop the high ground to the east and west of Phannhien, putting to flight one
 enemy company and killing 20 of the enemy, seizing a large quantity of weapons and
 ammunition, and cutting off the enemy's escape route from Phannhien, to create
 favorable conditions for the total annihilation of the enemy at Phannhien.  In
 an attack of an unnamed height to the northwest of Dandang, all the comrades in
 the company dared to fight and to do their best, wiping out five enemy firing
 points, subjugating the highest mountain peak at an elevation above sea level of
 more than 470 meters, and annihilating 26 enemy.  In the battle for Luongson,
 they were full of fight, and like a steel knife plunging directly into the
 enemy's heart, they took the Luongson Provincial Administrative Committee with
 one stroke, receiving a group citation first class for meritorious service.
 Higher authority awarded them a silk banner bearing the words "Heroic Dagger
 Company."  In the battle for Bangoaosan and Luongson, the machine gun company

 closely coordinated with a company of infantry, bravely killing the enemy, using
 the power of the weapons in their hands to wipe out more than 20 of the enemy's
 firing points, and winning a group commendation second class for meritorious
 service.
 In the course of this counterattack combat, a great deal of heroism took place
 in the third battalion, superb commanders and young soldiers coming to the fore.
 Deputy battalion commander Xu Ziging [6079 5261 3237] led a "commando company" in
 four separate attacks.  In the attack on Bangoaisan, when the advance of the ninth
 company main attack force was held up, he braved the ferocious shelling of the
 enemy to get to the front line where he bravely and resourcefully concentrated
 firepower to suppress the enemy.  He then rapidly outflanked the enemy to envelop
 his rear, bravely attacked the mountain top, and defeated an enemy company.  In
 the battle for Luongson, he led the eighth company in the first attack on the
 Luongson Provincial Administrative Committee and the Provincial Academy, winning
 a commendation second class for meritorious service.  A young company commander,
 Yang Chaoming [2799 6389 2494], led his unit in an assault that captured fortifica-
 tions, daring to fight a hard-fought battle.  When the forces launched a general
 attack against Luongson, he led comrades in his company in a direct thrust against
 a large railroad bridge, defeating the enemy who tenaciously guarded the bridge,
 to win a commendation second class for meritorious service.  In the battle for
 Bangoaisan on the perimeter of Luongson, eighth company soldier Xiao Yicheng
 [5135 4448 2052] found that the ninth company had been cut off by an enemy heavy
 machinegun firing point.  In order to win victory and without regard for his own
 safety, he led four comrades in an attack to outflank and envelop the enemy and
 draw the enemy's firepower.  With the clever use of a hand grenade, he blew up the
 firing point and then led an assault on the position, killing eight enemies on
 the spot and capturing one heavy machinegun, and an assault rifle, clearing the
 obstacle for the ninth company, and winning a first class commendation for
 meritorious service.
 Cadres and soldiers in this battalion responsible for communications liaison and
 assuring logistics also made great contributions to combat victory.  In daylight
 and in darkness, in wind and rain, and even when cut off by enemy artillery fire,
 communications squad leader He Xinchun 10149 2450 2504] got instructions from
 higher command to each company on time.  During the attack on Bangoaisan, ninth
 company's walkie-talkies were destroyed, and contact broken.  At this critical
 time, he stepped forward bravely and resourcefully to travel through several of
 the enemy's interdiction lines to deliver orders from higher authority to the
 ninth company.  Meeting the enemy on his way back, he was fearless.  He opened
 fire on them, killing two enemy on the spot, and capturing one recoiless rifle
 and one squad machinegun, earning a commendation second class for valor.  Eighth
 company mess officer, Li Kangcai [7812 1660 2088], led the mess squad and company
 detail personnel in the delivery of water, food, and ammunition to the front line
 and rescuing the wounded, braving enemy artillery fire to do so, to assure
 victory in battle, thereby winning a second citation second class.

 Attacks on Hills 391, 9
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 2 Apr 79, p 2
 [Article:  "The Most Lovable People in the New Generation"]
 [Text]  Editor's Note:  During the fighting in the self-defense
 counterattack to protect our borders, vast numbers of commanders
 in the Yunnan Border Defense Force were united as one, shared
 a bitter hatred of the enemy, were bold, powerful and indomitable,
 and completely invincible.  They attacked Laocai, fought at
 Batay, conquered Mangliem, and captured Camduong, rolling up the
 enemy like a mat in a demonstration of both national and military
 prowess that stirred military and popular morale.  Here some of
 their combat exploits are introduced to the readership.
 The Attack on Hill "391"
 Hill "391" was a high point on the Vietnam side of the Sino-Vietnam border along a
 line running from Nama to Lapman to Thaplap, and it was also a strongpoint at
 which the Vietnamese aggressors in this area were entrenched to make attacks on
 our side of the border.  Here the mountain terrain is difficult of access, mountain
 forests and canyons lining both sides.  On the front of the hill only a spine
 like a fishes backbone served as a passage.  Atop the ridge,  the Vietnamese
 agressors had set up four or five defense lines, constructing a firepower network
 to interdict the passage by constructing vertical and horizontal interconnecting
 trenches, bunkers, and emplacements.  A deputy regimental commander and captain
 in the Vietnamese aggressor army was in personal command of the hill.
 At 3:10 pm on the afternoon of 18 February, a certain regiment of our border
 defense forces launched an attack on hill "391."  Artillery troops first used
 their firepower to clear the roads.   The fierce artillery fire frightened the
 enemy out of their wits.  The first line of defense was very quickly wiped out
 by our forces.  Then, the first battalion and the third batallion attacked, one
 from a hill to the south, and the other from the northwest flank.  The task
 of making a frontal assault was handed to the fourth company, which had a glorious
 tradition of fierce fighting and fierce attack.
 The cadres and soldiers of the fourth company carried forward this glorious
 tradition, and braving a rain of concentrated fire, it moved along the ridge to
 make a fierce assault.  The company commander was out in front leading the
 attack, firing at the enemy while he climbed along the precipitous mountain road.
 The deputy squad leader of the rocket launcher squad, Tang Canshuang [0781 3503
 7175], braved the shower of whistling bullets to attack the enemy's bunkers,
 destroying one after another of the enemy's fire points, and clearing the road
 of advance for his comrades in arms.  The company very quickly broke through the
 enemy's second and third defense lines.  Now the Vietnamese aggressor army acted
 as though it had gone mad.  They scrambled around in their bunkers and trenches,
 and fired their anti-aircraft machineguns in flat trajectory in a vain attempt to
 use a network of fire to impede the advance of the soldiers of our fourth company.
 At this critical juncture, our artillery troops got the range of the enemy's

 anti-aircraft machinegun emplacements, and directed withering artillery fire on
 the enemy.  Shouting loudly and with fixed bayonets, the cadres and soldiers of the
 fourth company assaulted the enemy fortifications.  The deputy regimental commander
 was forced to bore his way out of his bunker, and he and more than 10 others
 rolled and crawled along the slope in an effort to escape, but were shot dead on
 the spot.
 After the enemy's hill "391" had been completely occupied, the soldiers retrieved a
 "position daily log" from the enemy commander's site, which contained proof of the
 guilt of the Vietnamese aggressors in attacking our border territory.  They also
 uncovered combat maps used in carrying out military provocations in our country's
 border areas and a large quantity of anti-Chinese propaganda.
 Xinhuashe Correspondent Zhang Li [1729 4539]
 Yang Rongming [2254 1345 2494] Who Fought a Swarm of Enemy Singlehandedly
 Toward evening on 17 February, the third company of a certain unit of the Yunnan
 Border Defense Force launched an attack against the Vietnamese aggressors
 entrenched on hill number 9.  The fourth and the ninth squads assaulted hill
 number 9 from hill number 10, which had already been occupied, and in the hollow
 between the two hills, they suddenly came under interdictory fire from enemy
 machineguns, and for a time the company's assault was blocked.  At this critical
 juncture, the platoon leader, Tang Xinping 13282 2450 1627] made a snap decision,
 directing the two squads to withdraw quickly.  Yang Songming, the fourth squad
 leader then came forward and asked to be responsible for providing cover for the
 withdrawal.  He lay prone there, constantly firing to attract the enemy's fire.
 After his comrades had withdrawn from the danger area, Yang Songming was
 surrounded by more than 10 of the enemy.  Faced with danger, he did not flinch,
 but remained: calm.  Scanning the terrain all around him, he saw that the enemy
 had him surrounded in a hollow, and that the terrain was very unfavorable for
 him.  He made up his mind to fight to the death against the enemy.  Seeing only.
 Yang Songming moving about, the enemy rushed froward from all four sides brandish-
 ing assault guns only to be raked with a burst of fierce firing that left six dead
 and two wounded.  Thrown into confusion by this sudden and violent attack, the
 enemy took to its heels and fled, and Yang Songming took the opportunity to come
 boldly charging out.
 Yang Songming had not had anything to eat for a day and a night.  He was
 exhausted; nevertheless, he continued to grope through the dark to return to his
 company.  Along the way he found the severely wounded and unconscious leader of
 the sixth squad, Lo Huachun [5012 5478 4783] whom  he lifted to his back, and
 carrying the weapons and equipment of both, walked with severe difficulty for
 more than a li, not reaching his own company until after 3 o'clock in the middle
 of the night.  Not bothering to rest, before dawn, he lugged two rounds of
 artillery on his shoulders to the front and led the entire squad in combat.
 Between hills number 8 and  9, Yang Songming discovered several mess personnel of
 the Vietnamese army preparing food.  Assault gun in hand, he attacked and three
 of the enemy fell as he fired.  In this entire battle, he killed a total of nine
 enemies, wounded seven, and was cited for meritorious service.

 vigilance a hundred fold to strictly defend the northern frontier of the
 motherland.
 Heihe Prefecture located in the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang occupies an
 extremely important strategic position.  The famed border city of Aihui is located
 in this prefecture, and on the opposite bank of the river lie Hailanpao and
 Liushisitun of Jiangdong.  The broad masses of soldiers and people of Heihe
 Prefecture never forget the lessons of history.  They are determined to guard the
 northern gate of the motherland, and to protect the building of the four
 modernizations in the motherland.
 The Historic Tragedy Cannot Be Repeated
 "For 10,000 li along the Long Jiang, the watchtowers are empty; the grass of the
 frontier is spattered with blood.  The remains of Liushisitun are still there,
 but who will recover the vast Jiangdong?"  This was a couplet written in "Songs
 of Longjiang" written at the time by Fudutongyaofusheng of Aihui in the Qing
 dynasty to describe the "1900 Russian Rampage," when the old Czar massacred
 the people of our country"s Hailanpao, and Liushisitan of Jiangdong, burning
 Aihui City to the ground.  According to the "County Annals of Aihu," in mid-July
 1900, Czarist Russian aggressor forces under the command of Major General
 Gelibusiji [phonetic], commander of the Amur military district, forcibly drove
 the Chinese residents of Hailanpao to the banks of the Heilongjiang where they
 were whipped, bayoneted, and shot to drive them into the river.  The people of
 Aihui on the opposite bank of the river witnessed the Czarist Russian aggressor
 forces, "wielding knives and axes and hacking right and left, butchering
 bodies, the sounds bringing tears to their eyes."  The seriously wounded died
 on the riverbanks, and the lightly wounded died in the river.  Those who were not
 wounded jumped into the river and drowned, their skeletons floating and choking
 the river."  Following the great massacre at Hailanpao, the Czarist Russian

 aggressor army next launched a great slaughter that bathed t.,1ushisitun in J.Lang-
 dong.  These two slaughters by Czarist Russian imperialism caused the tragic
 death of more than 14,000 innocent Chinese residents.   Subsequently, the Czarist
 Russian aggressor army crossed the river on a large scale, surrounded Aihui and
 burned this more than 200 year old city to the ground.  Lenin, the great leader
 of the proletariat angrily denounced this atrocity of imperial Russia, saying:
 "The Czarist government's policies in China are criminal policies."  ("Selected
 Works of Lenin," Vol 1, p 217).  "They kill and burn, raze villages, and drive
 the common people into the Heilongjiang to drown.  They shoot and bayonet
 defenseless residents and their wives and children."  (Ibid, p 215).  The Chinese
 people will never forget this historic tragedy of 79 years ago.  The local govern-
 ment has established an exhibition hall in the old city of Aihui, and has collected
 much historical data and artifacts to record the crimes against China during the
 past 200 years of czarism new and old.  The army and people of Heihe deeply
 understand that to slacken vigilance is to be beaten, and to be unprepared means
 inevitable disaster.  Only when the army and the people are united as one to build
 an unbreechable rampart can the security of the motherland and the prosperous
 life of the people be protected.  When the seventh company of a certain border
 defense unit garrisoning the old city of Aihui heard of the constant harrassment
 and provocations by the Vietnamese aggressors along the Guangxi and Yunnan
 border and that our border defense forces had been forced to counterattack in
 self-defense, the cadres and soldiers said that the Vietnamese aggressors were
 egged on and supported by Soviet socialist imperialism.  We are determined to
 intensify precautions to guard against provocations and trouble from Soviet
 socialist imperialsim.  In the snow-capped mountain ranges and in open country,
 cadres, soldiers and the militia will grope, crawl, roll, and fight, teaching
 and learning from each other, becoming skilled in a combination of native
 and foreign methods for fighting tanks, and practicing skills suited to fighting
 in intensely cold regions.  In order to better prepare for the annihilation of
 the aggressor, the army and the people have built fortifications on important
 roads in mountain passes.  Numerous old people and young children have actively
 been carrying tools into the mountains to help build fortifications and cannot
 be persuaded to leave.  Everybody has braved bone chilling cold winds to wage war
 against the forzen ground, "bodies covered with sweat when they work, and bodies
 covered with frost when they stop," so that the good earth of the frontier will
 become a rampart for the defense of the motherland.
 Vigilant Eyes Everywhere
 The Heilongjiang in winter, blocked with ice and enveloped in snow, is like a
 white python separating two worlds.  But Soviet socialist imperialism's evil claws
 often reach across the boundary river.  In   the Heihe region, numerous instances
 have occurred in which the Soviet army has crossed the boundary to intercept our
 patrols, to kidnap our citizens on the border, and even to attack with weapons
 killing and wounding our citizens in the border area and our border defense
 troops.  Worse yet, they have steadily sent spies to sneak into our side to steal
 secret information.  In fighting all these destructive plots of Soviet socialist
 imperialism, the army and people of Heihe Prefecture better understand the nature
 of Soviet socialist imperialism and increase their vigilance.  Here is a story
 relating how a mess person and middle school students worked together to catch
 a spy.  The messhall of a certain border defense company was located on the shores

 of the Heilongjiang.  The mess squad leader Zheng Yonghe [6774 3057 0735] used
 the messhall as a sentry post, and while tending the fire and cooking, he
 unfailingly kept a watch out the windows, looking for anything moving on the
 river.  One day toward evening, he was watching out of the window, when suddenly
 he discovered a reconnaissance vehicle crossing the ice from the opposite shore
 and headed for the main channel, something that had rarely happened in the past.
 He quickly ran out of the building to watch what was going on in front of him.
 Just then, on our own shore a guy carrying a bag was walking down the slope of
 the riverbank.  He thought this man's movements were suspicious, and immediately
 ran back to the squad to make a report.  Just at this time, six students from
 Aihui County Middle School were skating on the river, and they also saw this
 person.  The students quietly discussed him briefly.  One student then suddenly
 shouted:  "One, two," and the other students joined in shouting, "Catch the spy."
 That guy had a guilty conscience, and as soon as he heard the shouting, he turned
 to go up the bank, taking to his heels and running.  Just then Zheng Yonghe and
 two soldiers cut him off, captured him, and sent him to the Public Security Bureau.
 This was how the Soviet spy fell into a net.
 The border defense troops here have proven themselves to be the most loyal and
 dependable sentries for the people of the motherland.  The 127.1 observation post
 of a certain unit, garrisons a small island in the Heilongjiang.  During the
 coldest days of the year when temperatures on the shore register 30 to 40 degrees
 below zero, temperatures on the river are even lower.  When the weather is coldest,
 the windows of the sentry tower form a thick layer of ice blocking vision, and then
 the guards watch from outside the building despite the bone piercing cold winds.
 Squad leader Zou Jifu [6760 0679 4395] is a famous "living map."  Every day he
 counts every grassy tract and every tree in the target area.  After going off
 duty, he frequently goes down along the river to watch.  When the weather is foul,
 this is a good opportunity for him to acquire greater skills in observation.  He
 knows the terrain and-the military installations in the observation area like the
 palm of his hand.  He needs only look at its lights to know what the type of an
 aircraft is, and he needs only to hear the sound of amoving vehicle to know what
 vehicle it is.

 PLA UNITS SOLVE OFFSHORE ISLAND LIVING PROBLEMS
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 2 Apr 79 p 2
 [Article by Xu Bosung [1776 0130 2646], Liu Xun [0491 6598], and Zhang Yuqiang
 [1728 3768 1730]:  "Taking the Party's Concern and Warmth to the Islands; Certain
 Division in the Fuzhou Command Acts Realistically to Help Grassroots Solve
 Problems; Travelling Oil Generator Inspection and Repair Team of 37513 Unit
 Serves Offshore Islets and Scattered Units"]
 [Text]  Out of concern for the hardships of soldiers, and to solve real problems
 in company size units, the CCP Committee of a certain garrison regiment of the
 Fuzhou Command has done its best to create a fairly good living environment, so
 that commanders will keep their minds on the islands, love the islands, and
 guard the islands.
 On the islands where rocks are numerous but soil scant, and where wind is plentiful
 but water in short supply, getting enough vegetables for the forces is a major
 problem.  Formerly people were regularly sent to the mainland to buy vegetables,
 but because of difficulties with transportation, some islands far distant from
 the mainland might, during the season of high winds, go without fresh vegetables
 for from 10 days to half a month.  The divisional CCP Committee decided to call
 upon companies to practice self-reliance and think up ways to achieve self-
 sufficiency in fresh vegetables and pork in the shortest possible time.  Division
 leadership cadres probed the islands and carried out investigation and study.
 Together with commanders, they explored experiences in raising hogs and growing
 vegetables on the islands, then summarized and spread these experiences.
 Frequently vegetables grown on the islands were knocked down by high winds, so
 they built windbreak walls more than a meter high all around the vegetable
 gardens.  The islands lack water, so they saved up water used for washing faces
 and hands and clothing to water the vegetables, and selected some vegetable
 varieties suited to growing on the islands for issue to companies.  Now quite a
 few companies in units garrisoning the islands have gradually attained self-
 sufficiency in pork and fresh vegetables, and some companies have more than enough
 to meet their needs and are able to help the masses on the islands.
 There is a shortage of water sources on the islands, and difficulties are
 frequently encountered in getting enough drinking water and water for other
 uses.  Though numerous wells have been sunk during the past several years and
 numerous reservoirs built to store water, during times of drought, water

 continues to be a problem.  Everyday some companies living in the mountains must
 waste a lot of effort in coming down the mountain to haul water.  The division
 CCP Committee gained the approval of higher authority to allocate special funds
 for the construction of sea water purification projects and underground
 reservoirs on islands where sources of water are particularly lacking, and tor lay
 pipelines to pump water up the mountains to end the difficulty island units have
 experienced in getting drinking water.
 As regards problems pertaining to housing, because of the former lack of experience
 and limitations of the terrain, quite a few of the barracks for forces garrisoning
 the island have been haphazardly layed out; quality is poor; and lighting is bad.
 Recently the divisional CCP Committee carried out a comprehensive inspection of
 the barracks of garrisoning forces, and has made plans for a thorough change in
 the situation.  During early November last year, divisional and regimental leaders
 made an inspection of organizational work units on the islands, seeking out cadres
 and soldiers for talks to find out their views.  There is a lot of wind on the
 islands, and because the barracks are facing in the wrong direction, the soldiers
 said that they were cold in winter and hot in summer.  During the period of the
 early summer rains in the south, because of the lack of any walkways on the old
 barracks, there was no place to stretch one's legs.  Divisional and regimental
 leaders worked with barracks designers to conduct surveys and select sights,
 orient and design new barracks suited to the islands that faced north and south
 and had walkways that would be warm and windproof in winter and ventilated and
 cool in summer, spacious, and attractive.
 The divisional CCP Committee was especially concerned about the cultural life of
 the garrisoning forces.  They first made certain what cultural and athletic
 equipment provided by higher authority was needed by the garrisoning forces.  Now
 every company on the islands has radios and television sets, and operates a
 library.  More nourishment for the mind, and conditions for the study of scientific
 and cultural knowledge have been provided.  The loving care of superior CCP
 committees and organizations has given great encouragement to island garrison
 commanders who are determined to contribute their efforts to strengthening the
 building of the islands.
 A travelling oil generator inspection and repair team has been organized by the
 37513 unit to inspect and repair oil generators for units on offshore islands
 and islets, and in only 5 months has made major repairs on six generators, and
 minor repairs on six generators, saving about 15,000 yuan thereby.
 Most of the units in this force are spread over small islands in forward positions.
 Formerly when their oil generators broke down, they had to remove them from the
 islands with great difficulty to a plant for repair.  In order to solve this
 problem, the forces CCP Committee held a special meeting in which it was decided
 to assign three repair technicians to set up a traveling oil generator repair
 team.  Carrying tools and spare parts, they would visit island grassroots units to
 inspect the oil generators, and fix at once any problems they might find.  There
 is a welter of generator types on the islands, some of which the repair team has
 never had anything to do with in the past.  They thumbed through books and
 checked data, studying as they worked.  Once when repairing an 80 horsepower
 generator about which they had no experience, they familiarized themselves with

 the machine during the day and consulted their reference aids at night, taking
 it apart, comparing it, and checking it over and over more than 10 times.  They
 finally got rid of the trouble, restoring the generator to a fine technical state.
 While giving attention to island-to-island inspection, they took note of the
 situation in which grassroots oil generator personnel were only able to operate
 the equipment but not repair it, and actively trained technical mainstay cadres for
 the island forces.  The repair team comrades would take the apprentices on their
 repair rounds.  Whenever they came to a place, they would take the equipment apart
 in the company of the oil generator personnel, and eliminate the trouble with
 them, both fixing and teaching as they went.  They also devoted time to passing
 on their own practical experience, using their rest periods, evenings, and Sundays
 to give individual technical guidance.  They have now trained 27 oil generator
 personnel for the island forces so that they have a certain technical proficiency,
 and now virtually no repairs are made off island.

 MILITARY EXPLOITS OF YUNNAN BORDER DEFENSE UNITS REPORTED
 Zhao Zhonglin
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 2 Apr 79, p 2
 [Article by Zhang Lingxiao [1728 0407 7197], Cao Jinhua 2580 6930 5478], and
 Zheng Jian [6774 0256]:  "Zhao Zhonglin [6392 1813 2651] Who Attacks Like a
 Ferocious Tiger"]
 [Text]  The eighth company of a certain unit of Yunnan Defense Forces, which had
 point duties, quickly penetrated the Vietnamese Army's area number 61 like an
 arrow released from a bowstring.  Along the way, a major enemy fortified hill
 position blocked the eighth company's way.  Here the enemy had layed out vertical
 and horizontal trenches and set up open and hidden firing sites.  The enemy had
 completely stripped all trees and vegetation from the top of the mountain, and
 only a squat stump remained here and there along the slope.  The eighth company
 launched an attack on this hill.  Sixth squad leader Zhao Zhonglin courageously
 took the point, leading the squad in an assault on the hill.  He had machine
 gunners Li Guanghong [2621 0342 4767] and Guan Kailin [4619 7030 2651] provide
 cover, while he himself braved the enemy's firepower by leaping from one stump
 to another, rapidly drawing close to the enemy.  When he was at a distance of a
 slightly more than 20 meters from the enemy, he tossed several hand grenades one
 after another, and took advantage of the gunpowder smoke created by the explosions
 to leap like a ferocious tiger to the front of the enemy's fortifications, raking
 with fire the enemy in their trenches.  He shot three enemy in a row and broke
 through the enemy's front line.
 Suddenly, Zhao Zhonglin discovered an enemy soldier sticking his head up out of a
 trench on the left flank, his hand in the act of uncapping a grenade.  He swung his
 muzzle around to fire when a hail of machinegun bullets came firing out of a hidden
 bunker hitting him in the abdomen and breaking his right arm.  The assault gun in
 his hand fell involuntarily to the ground.  At this critical juncture, he waved
 with his left arm, gave a shout, and charged toward the enemy in their trenches.
 This enemy hurriedly pulled his head back into his position.  Zhao Zhonglin
 jumped in after him, spread both legs and used his backside to hold down the
 enemy's head, and grabbed the enemy's assault gun, which he used, despite great
 pain, to pound the back of the enemy beneath him.  Within a short while this
 enemy soldier no longer moved.

 Soldiers Li Guanghong and Guan Kailin were worried about the squad leader, and
 after smashing the enemy, the two of them came rushing only to see Zhao Zhonglin
 forcibly holding the enemy down while pounding his back with a rifle held in one
 hand.  When this enemy soldier who had been knocked unconscious began to come to,
 he again began to struggle.  Li Guanghong then took aim with his bayonet at the
 nape of the enemy's neck and thrust it in fiercely.  They wanted to bandage Zaho
 Zhonglin's wounds, but Zhao Zhonglin pushed the two of them away, ordering them to
 attack at once.  Their eyes brimming with tears, the two soldiers quickly charged
 into the enemy.
 Zhao Zhonglin gloriously sacrificed himself.  In order to commemorate his heroic
 exploits, the CCP Committee of the unit awarded him a first class merit citation
 posthumously, and awarded a second class merit citation collectively to the sixth
 squad.

 "Flame Throwing Warrior, Gu Wenrong [0657 2429 2837]"]
 [Text]  On 17 February, the second company of a certain unit of the Yunnan Border
 Defense Force launched an attack on hill "318."  The soldiers valiantly killed the
 enemy, and by 8:52, only one final enemy firing point remained, and it was the
 largest of them all.  At this firing point, a tunnel connected three communication
 trenches.  The enemy holed up inside was extremely foxy, hiding around a corner
 in the tunnel when firing was taking place, only to come out to the mouth of the
 tunnel and into the communication trenches to offer stubborn resistance once the
 firing had stopped.  The second company had attacked the position, without success
 several times.  This time flamethrower Gu Wenrong, who had been attached to the
 second company, was burning with impatience.  He was determined to wipe out the
 enemies in the firing point.
 Under covering fire from light and heavy machineguns, and carrying a flame thrower
 on his back, Gu Wenrong advanced in a crouch along a communications trench.  The
 enemy discovered him and ferociously directed strafing fire toward him.  Gu
 Wenrong hit the dirt at once.  The bullets whistled over his head, and he continued
 to crawl forward.  When he got close to the mouth of the enemy tunnel, Gu Wenrong
 discovered that if he were to fire from a prone position here, his cone of fire
 would only go over the top of the bunker.  What was to be done?  Suddenly he leaped
 up, rushed forward, and stuck the muzzle of the flamethrower into the mouth of the
 enemy's bunker tunnel.  The enemy panicked but was about to resist when Gu Wenrong
 suddenly fired.  One enemy was immediately set on fire, and another enemy set
 afire and trailing a mass of flames jumped out of the mouth of the tunnel.  Our
 follow-up units quickly rushed forward to wipe out the enemy and take hill "319."
 In order to commemorate Gu Wenrong's heroic exploits, the CCP Committee at a
 higher level of authority awarded him a second class merit citation.

 [Text]  A certain unit in the Yunnan Border Defense Force is extolling the name of
 a Yang Gensi style hero.  He is a squad leader in the engineering platoon of a
 special task company, and member of the Communist party, Li Shuibo.
 Before dawn on 23 February, Li Shuibo led three soldiers to a nameless place to
 the south of Dainai to lay oriented landmines.  They had just buried the mines but
 had not yet had time to arm them when the enemy launched an attack and pressed
 close to them little by little.  The four of them carried four assault rifles,
 eight hand grenades, and one bangalore torpedo.  Waiting until the enemy got close
 to them, they opened fire suddenly, instantly killing four people.  An enemy hand
 grenade was thrown into their position and was about to explode before their very
 eyes when Li Shuibo, in disregard of his own life, leaped forward, grabbed the
 hand grenade and threw it back.  Some of the enemy were killed and others
 wounded.  They retreated.  Unwilling to suffer defeat, the enemy again launched
 an attack. Two of the comrades on the bangalore team were wounded, one comrade
 was killed, and Li Shuibo had taken a bullet in the leg.  By now their ammunition
 and hand grenades had been all used up, but the frenzied enemy was closing in
 around them screaming and shouting.  Then, Li Shuibo took the remaining bangalore
 torpedo, leaped out of the trench, pulled the firing pin, and rushed toward the
 group of enemy soldiers.  "Blam," a tremendous explosion sounded, and the enemy
 fell all around.
 When the fighting was over, comrades went to the spot where Li Shuibo had
 heroically given his life, and saw at the side of this heroic soldier's body the
 corpses of six of the enemy.  Li Shuibols action had made a reality of the combat
 oath he had sworn many times to his Party branch:  "If I am required to bleed for
 the revolution, I will do so without quibbling, and if it requires that I give
 my life, I will give it calmly!"  A superior CCP Committee awarded him a first
 class citation, and called upon the leadership of the defense force to title him,
 "combat hero in the style of Yang Gensi."

 MILITARY AND PUBLIC SECURITY
 NEED FOR THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF ENEMY EMPHASIZED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 2 Apr 79 p 3
 [Article by Huo Dongyou [7202 2639 0645] and Yang Yuchen [2799 3768 6591]:  "It
 is Necessary to Thoroughly Study Combat Adversaries"]
 [Text]  Editor's Note:  Beginning with this issue, the special
 page titled "Learn Military Matters" will run a special
 column titled, "Chats on Military Strategy. and Tactics,"
 the object of which will be to provide wide opportunities for
 the airing of views to enliven thinking on military science.
 Right now, this column is devoted primarily to publicizing,
 studying, and evaluating the experiences of our border
 defense forces in combat during the self-defense counter-
 attack against Vietnam, and to studying and exploring military
 science and difficult problems in military theory to promote
 the pace of modernization of China's armed forces.
 Just like the things learned by millions upon millions of
 people during the revolutionary period, when more was
 learned in a week than during the course of a year of muddled
 living, the 17 days of combat during the counterattack for
 self-defense under conditions of real warfare provided
 numerous things otherwise unobtainable from education and
 training in ordinary gimes.  This precious wealth, which
 could not have been bought at any price, we must treasure
 and value.  In order to make it become a common source of
 sustenance for the future building of our armed forces, it
 must be put through a conscientious process of summarization
 and study to elevate it to a high degree of military science
 and theory.  Fulfillment of this task of "elevation" is,
 without doubt, an important responsibility in academic
 research.
 In order to do a good job of summarizing and studying
 experiences in combat during the self-defense counterattack,
 we plan to publicize three aspects of the "combat results"
 that everyone has studied.  The first is to study the

 ordinary in terms of the special.  For example: war as a
 continuation of political struggle; a look at the justice
 of war in terms of the defeat of a 'third military power";
 training and experience; modern warfare as not being an
 immutable form; the position of subjective activity in modern
 warfare; attention to the study of military topography;
 doing a good job of assuring logistics, etc.  Second is to
 summarize the overall in terms of the partial.  Examples
 are:  discussion of coordinated warfare among infantry, tanks,
 and artillery; overall strength and an overall conception;
 flexible command; combat style, etc.  Third is analysis of
 some classic combat examples.
 "Chats on Military Strategy and Tactics" continues the policy
 of "let a hundred flowers blossom; let a hundred schools of
 thought content," each person presenting his own views, and
 speaking his own mind freely.  In analyzing specific combat
 situations, before the fact "Zhu Geliang's" [a wise and
 resourceful statesman in China's history] will be welcome,
 and after the fact "Zhu Geliang's" will not be rejected.
 It is hoped that commanders throughout the armed forces,
 particularly those in units with combat experience, will join
 with us in summarizing their experiences and publicizing
 them.
 In their self-defense counterattack combat against Vietnam, our border defense
 forces produced numerous rich combat experiences.  One of the most important was
 to act in accordance with realities to intensify study of the combat adversary so
 as to be able to adopt flexible and mobile tactics and strategy on the basis of
 the characteristics of the enemy's tactics.  Now we are diligently studying and
 assimilating this experience, and undertaking a thorough study of the enemy army.
 This has extremely great significance in meeting requirements for the modernization
 of the armed forces and of future wars.
 Study of the enemy and thorough familiarity with the enemy are major prerequisites
 for subjugation of the enemy and the attainment of victory.  One of the main reasons
 why our armed forces that were engaged in this self-defense counterattack combat
 against Vietnam became stronger the more they fought was adeptness in learning
 about warfare from warfare itself, gradually deepening their understanding and
 perception of the Vietnamese Army as their experience in combat developed.  Once
 our forces figured out the tactics of the Vietnamese Army--breaking the whole into
 parts, dispersal of fixed points, concealment of main forces by burrowing into
 holes, and sneak attacks under cover of darkness--we promptly adopted corresponding
 tactics and countermeasures using small teams to go after dispersed forces,
 ambushing the enemy's sneak attacks, pinning down forces in their holes, and such
 flexible and mobile tactics, so that we maintained the initiative throughout.  No
 wonder that foreign critics said that even though Chinese forces had not fought for
 more than 20 years, their application of tactics was surprisingly good.  Had we
 not understood the enemy, and had we not entirely figured out the temperament
 of our combat adversary but proceeded to array large forces for attack everywhere,
 the results might easily have been like "using a fist to hit a flea."

 In comparison with our experiences in this self-defense counterattack combat, our
 ordinary education and training, and our study of our combat adversary was far
 from adequate, dwelling as it did on understanding of general characteristics of
 weapons and equipment, and being content with the memorization of some data.  A
 murky notion of the characteristics of the enemy's tactics naturally could not
 produce any clear, scientific countermoves or flexible combat methods to keep one
 move ahead of the enemy.  One state of mind was biased about studying the combat
 characteristics of the enemy, supposing that it would be time enough to discuss
 the subject once fighting had begun, and supposing that in ordinary times one
 should concentrate energies on training one's forces well and everything would be
 all right.  They did not realize that the principle of early success in warfare
 required that we thoroughly study the enemy in advance of war, and that the
 education and training of our forces in ordinary times should also be directed
 toward the characteristics of the enemy's tactics, positively not conducting train-
 ing in a closed room without any targets to shoot at.
 Thorough study of enemy forces requires adherence to the concept of one divides
 into two.  Only when the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy's weapons, equipment,
 techniques, and tactics are understood can one circumvent his strengths and attack
 his weaknesses for victory in combat.  There were two tendencies meriting attention
 in our studies.  One was parochial arrogance and blind optimism, talking with
 great delight about the enemy's shortcomings, weaknesses, and aspects of a paper
 tiger while touching only lightly upon his long points, strengths, and aspects of a
 real tiger, isolatedly and lopsidedly emphasizing use of existing equipment to win
 victory over an enemy possessed of modern equipment, thereby developing a blind
 self-confidence, lowering one's guard, and slighting the enemy.  The other tendency
 was to look only at the advantages possessed by the enemy's arms and equipment
 without looking at the hidden weaknesses behind these advantages, or even "turning
 pale at the mention of a tiger" in reference to the enemy's arms and equipment,
 frequently expressing a sense of pessimism, gloom, and inertia.  The practical
 experience of the self-defense combat have told us that modern arms and equipment
 require corresponding battlefield conditions and various measures to safeguard the
 equipment, and that one must look at the enemy's equipment, tactics, and techniques
 in terms of one dividing into two, and study by seeking truth in facts.  For
 example, the assault force of the enemy's massed tanks is, naturally, not to be
 underestimated; however, the large quantities of petroleum required to supply them
 in in-depth combat operations poses numerous difficulties,  The atomic weapons
 of an enemy, though certainly possessing very great ability to kill and injure,
 also hurt the enemy's objective of plunder in launching a war of aggression,
 and limit his ability to advance.  The enemy's modern reconnaissance techniques
 are truly well developed and advanced, but they are also helpful in our revealing
 a false situation while hiding the real one, beating the enemy at his own game.
 After all, there isDalways one thing to conquer another in the world, and a view
 that sees only weaknesses without seeing strengths, or sees only strengths without
 seeing weaknesses cannot be said to be one whereby one truly "knows the
 adversary," but rather is a lopsided study of enemy forces.
 Thoroughgoing study of enemy forces and full knowledge of one's combat adversaries
 also requires being alert to their development.  Everything develops: and changes,
 and so it is with national military situations.  Take Vietnam, for example,

 Japan, it has received some American "property," and after (word illegible) the
 Soviet revisionists, it has styled itself "number three in the world," like a dog
 threatening people on the strength of its master's power.  As a result of
 continuous warfare, the Vietnam army has accumulated some combat experience, and
 tactically it has improved to a fairly great extent.  However, an armed force
 opposed to aggression was suddenly transformed into an aggressive tool of the
 hegemonists, and its combat strength greatly declined.  If we were not to pay
 attention to these new political and military situations, but make a study of the
 Vietnamese army on the basis of the situation 10 years ago, it would be very
 difficult indeed to get an accurate understanding of this combat adversary.
 Development of the Soviet army is the same way.  In order to achieve hegemony over
 the world, the Brezhnev renegade clique fears only that it will fall behind
 militarily, so it does everything in its power to carry out an arms race.  Take
 the case of guided missiles, for example, which have been replaced three times over
 a period of somewhat more than 10 years.  Rather great developments have also taken
 place in other things as well, such as combat aircraft, surface ships, submarines,
 anti-missile and radar systems, and command and communications equipment.  If we
 have no real idea of these developments, and if we have no predictions about their
 future development, it will be virtually impossible to avoid making the mistake
 of taking measures without regard for changes in circumstances.  At the outset of
 World War II, because France did not understand on time the upgrading of the German
 army's mobility or how the German army had changed its tactics, it acted blindly,
 using the old standbys of World War I, in a vain effort to use the "Maginot Line"
 to. block the German army, only to suffer a crushing defeat by the "Blitzkrieg
 tactics" of the German army.  The old lesson of history that "the overturned cart
 ahead is a warning to the cart behind" should be diligently borne in mind.
 Study of one's combat adversary poses still another problem that should be-raised:
 to dare to emancipate one's mind and let the enemy be one's "teacher."  Not only
 is it necessary to be adept in learning the enemy's advanced techniques, but it is
 equally necessary to be adept at learning the enemy's tactics that accord with
 objective laws.  "Aiya!  Isn't the raising of such a question capitulationism?"
 No, because our "seeking a teacher in the enemy" has as its objective victory over
 the enemy.  According to foreign critics, the guerrilla tactics used by the
 Vietnamese forces during this self-defense combat had been learned from the
 Chinese.  There is nothing strange about this.  If they learned them well, we can
 learn them back in a case of "returning something to its rightful owner."  Things
 that they did not learn well and which were reasons for their defeat, we can
 summarize and accept a lesson in teaching by negative example.  In short, even
 though the Vietnamese forces have been vanquished by us, we still desire to honor
 this "old third" as a "teacher."  So long as we are able to give attention to
 taking the long points of everyone, we will be even more able to be invincible.

 TRAINING REFORM BASED ON BORDER WAR EXPERIENCE
 Introduction

 [Text]. Are grenades better the farther they are thrown?
 Should bayonet training be included in military sports?
 Are satchel charges effective against tanks?  Opinions
 have long differed on such questions.  After the counter-
 attack against Vietnam, the two differing sides got new
 arguments from it.  Practice is the only criterion to.
 examine one's understanding.  It does not matter if for a
 time understanding cannot be unified, but all of us must try
 our best not to commit metaphysical errors.  In this dis-
 cussion each airs his own views.  We believe that by fully
 discussing them we will ultimately find those that are
 more correct and comprehensive.

 [Text]  "Overthrown Grenades Are Ineffective"
 What should mark the technical training of infantry in order to suit the demands of
 actual warfare?  We have gained new understanding after this defensive counterattack.
 In this war the consumption of grenades and explosives was low and bayonets were
 hardly used at all.  This is closely related to the continuous improvement of our
 equipment.  Our artillery firepower has been strengthened and automatic firearms
 have increased.  We generally used battle-sight firearms (40 mm rocket launchers,
 82 mm recoilless guns and 60 mm guns) to destroy enemy firing points and bunkers.
 There were few opportunities to use satchel charges and bangalores to attack the
 enemy.  Only when battle-sight firearms fell short did we adopt explosives.  This
 greatly differs from wars fought in the past.  In former wars our firepower was in-
 sufficient and we had to use mainly bangalores and grenades to destroy enemy firing

 points and strong points.  But today the infantry coordinates, regardless of the
 scale of the battle, so the role of these weapons has relatively decreased.  In
 former wars troops had to use quite a few grenades in each battle.  But in this de-
 fensive counterattack a soldier carrying four grenades in a battle generally did,not
 use them all.  Accuracy in throwing grenades is very important in combat.  In fact,
 a grenade can only be thrown to a distance of 30 to 35 meters, just enough to use
 the short interval after the blast to make a swift assault.  If a grenade is over-
 thrown the effect of the blast cannot be used.  Therefore, it does not accord with
 actual warfare if training in grenade throwing demands distance and not accuracy.
 After one has been trained to throw a grenade 40 meters, one can train to throw
 grenades in various types of terrain and postures.
 Bayonet, Grenade Training
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 16 Apr 79 p 1
 [Article by Ren Haiquan [0117 3189 3123], Military Training Department, Shenyang
 Unit:   "Training In Bayonet Fighting and Use of Grenades"]
 I wish to discuss my own views on several much debated questions in the training of
 infantry sub-units.
 1.  It Is Not Appropriate to Include Bayonet Training In Military Sports
 Daring to fight with a bayonet is a glorious tradition of our army.  In the war
 years the heroic spirit of our army in bayonet fighting terrified the enemy.  Some
 comrades say that in modern warfare the most obvious problem is fighting tanks and
 that the bayonet is no longer useful.  I think the first half of the statement is
 correct but the second half is too extreme.  From the circumstances of the defensive
 counterattack at the Chinese-Vietnamese border, the Vietnamese forces did not dare
 to fight ours with bayonets.  Some comrades proposed to turn bayonet training into
 a military sport.and some even demand the abolition of bayonet training.  I believe
 these are not appropriate.  Of course, it is not suitable to put aside too much time
 for bayonet training; the tendency to purely seek orderly for formation and good
 appearance must be overcome.  During training, emphasis must be placed on the needs
 in actual combat.  After a certain amount of training in basic moves, emphasis must
 be, shifted to face-to-face bayonet training so that the fighters will learn the true
 art of practical application.
 2.  Grenades Must Be Thrown Accurately and Far
 For a time there was a phenomenon of stressing only distance in grenade training.
 At that time, quite a few articles were published in the newspapers which pointed
 out the harmfulness of this phenomenon and the problem was quickly resolved.  However,
 another phenomenon followed.  Quite a few comrades believe that training to throw
 grenades is not important and that it is a waste of energy to practice throwing
 them far.  No longer does anyone keep records or talk about the average distance
 each unit can throw.  This is also an abnormal phenomenon.  Experience during the
 defensive counterattack on the Chinese-Vietnamese border has proved that grenades
 are still a good, close-combat weapon in modern warfare.  The training to throw
 grenades is one of the five great skills of the infantry which cannot be ignored.
 Training for accuracy is necessary, but distance is also useful.   It is appropriate
 to throw far so that a grenade exploding two to three meters above ground will in-
 crease the casualty area by shell fragments, which is particularly effective for
 annihilating group targets and enemy in trenches or on reverse slopes.   Clearly,

 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 training for accurate and long distance throwing should be equally stressed so that
 they complement each other.  A unit's average throwing distance, data on the rates
 of passing and of first-class qualifiers can all reflect to a certain degree the
 quality of training of the unit.  Why isn't this mentioned?
 3.  Fighting Tanks With Satchel Charges Cannot Be Categorically Rejected
 Can satchel charges be used to fight tanks?  This is a question that has caused much
 debate in recent years.  I believe that the use of satchel charges to fight tanks is
 not only a necessity for the present but will continue to be so even after we are
 extensively equipped with modern weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles as a
 supplementary measure in fighting tanks by the infantry.  This is because increasing
 anti-tank firepower essentially means building more anti-tank firearm units and sub-
 units.  It is not possible for each infantry soldier to be equipped with an anti-tank
 guided missile launcher.  Most of the soliders will still be using light armament,
 satchel charges and other equipment to fight enemy tanks and motorized infantry.
 Therefore, the use of satchel charges to fight tanks cannot be rejected categorically.
 We must warmly support the creative spirit of cadres and fighters, and should not
 discard the magic weapon that results from combined indigenous and foreign methods.
 Three Fights, Three Defenses
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 16 Apr 79 p 1
 [Article by Sun Fengrang [1327 7685 6245], Guangxi Border Unit:  "Three Fights and
 Three Defenses Are Still the Emphasis of Training"]
 Conventional weapons including rifles, grenades and bangalores of our troops played
 a very great role in the counterattack against Vietnam.  However, the three fights
 and three defenses were not used.  Some comrades have therefore concluded:  Rifles,
 grenades and. satchel charges can be solely relied on to fight a war under modern
 conditions.  Such a conclusion is not comprehensive.
 True, the conventional weapons in our possession have played a mighty role in com-
 bat.  They have refuted the incorrect view of some comrades who believe that exist-
 ing equipment cannot fight a modern war.  However, the following points must be noted
 in considering the role of these weapons:
 First, these conventional weapons played their mighty role in coordination with the
 powerful artillery of our forces.  In major and minor battles, infantry sub-units
 generally accompanied artillery troops and other kinds of heavy equipment.  Some
 even accompanied tanks.   In offensive or defensive warfare these long-medium range
 firearms effectively coordinated with infantry sub-units.  Therefore, the future
 training of infantry sub-units should not only emphasize technical training and skill
 with hand weapons, but must vigorously include coordination among arms of the
 services so that fighters will understand how to take advantage of the aftereffects
 of an artillery attack, start a quick assault, and be good at movements under artil-
 lery fire.  This is precisely our weak link in past training.
 Second, the object in this war was the infantry.  Great numbers of tanks, planes and
 modern weapons were not used in combat.  Conventional weapons were primarily used.
 But Soviet equipment, guiding ideology in combat and characteristics in strategy will

 all utilize large numbers of tanks, armored cars, planes, paratroopers, atomic and
 chemical weapons.  It is necessary to fight the armed forces of social-imperialism
 primarily with the three fights and three defenses.  One cannot hold that since they
 were not used in the war against Vietnam the three fights and three defenses are not
 important.
 Bayonet Training
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 16 Apr 79 p 1
 [Letter from Su Jianxin [5685 1696 2450], Assistant Squad Leader:  "Bayonet Training
 Can Be Halted"]
 In the discussion "How should we train in order to suit the demands of modern
 warfare" in the army newspapers, some comrades have suggested the inclusion of
 bayonet training in military sports.  After the counterattack we find the role that
 bayonets played in the fighting was extremely small.  Bayonets were only used in
 individual cases when unarmed or scattered troops were encountered.  This clearly
 shows that under the condition of substantial training for the infantry, bayonet
 training is like a singer who does not practice his voice but only his show tech-
 niques, giving up something important for something less.  Furthermore, future
 opponents in war will be much better equipped than the Vietnamese forces.
 After the counterattack we also find that in modern warfare, mines are not only
 extensively used in defensive warfare but also have a great role to play in offensive
 warfare such as cutting off the enemy's retreat route, resisting assault by the enemy,
 and safeguarding both flanks from the threat of enemy reinforcement.
 For these reasons, I strongly call for an immediate halt to bayonet training and for
 an increase in courses such as mine clearance and mine laying.
 Editor's note:  The suggestion of adding training in mine removal and mine laying is
 good.  That of putting a complete "halt" to bayonet training seems extreme.  However,
 in view of the place and role of bayonet fighting in future practical warfare,
 whether we can suitably reduce the duration of its training or should include it in
 military sports remains debatable.

 ARDUOUS STRUGGLE VIEWED AS KEY TO FUTURE
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 26 Apr 79 p 1
 [Commentary: "Arduous Struggle Is Still a Must"]
 [Text]  The defensive counterattack at the Chinese-Vietnamese border has proved that
 our old traditions and old ways still exist, one of which is arduous struggle.  We
 have previously given quite a few reports on deeds in this respect.  The news report
 published today, "Motherland, be proud of your heroic sons and daughters," once
 again displays the glorious picture of the people's army in their extreme hardships
 and difficulties, brave and heroic fight.  These heroic and outstanding achievements
 are deeply moving and will undoubtedly play a highly inspiring and instructive role
 in our daily life.
 The great Chinese Communist Party and the great Chinese People's Liberation Army
 which it leads are noted for their arduous struggle.  Countless revolutionary mar-
 tyrs have languished in enemy prisons; thousands and thousands of the people's
 fighters have sacrificed themselves on the battlefield.  On the road of the long
 march they had to eat grass, roots, and tree bark, and after the liberation of
 Shanghai they had to sleep on the streets.  Scenes of this arduous struggle still
 stir the hearts of the people today.  Arduous struggle is our political character
 and the safeguard of carrying out the party line.  Moreover, near the end of the demo-
 cratic revolution and on the eve of the launching of the socialist revolution and
 reconstruction, Comrade Mao Zedong warned the whole party:  "Be sure that comrades
 keep up with the style of being modest and prudent and not arrogant and rash.  Be
 sure that comrades keep up with the way of arduous struggle."  In the long march
 which we are undertaking, our armed forces shoulder the glorious task of defending
 the construction of the four modernizations.  We strongly need to develop the tra-
 dition of arduous struggle.  We have been called to do precisely this by our 11th
 National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Party Committee,
 the Military Commission Conference, and the National Military and Political Work Con-
 ference.  The problem is that there are many factors, particularly the destruction by
 Lin Biao and the "gang of four," which have caused some of our comrades to forget
 this tradition.  Therefore, it is even more necessary to advocate and encourage the
 tradition of arduous struggle.
 The need for arduous struggle is, fundamentally speaking, determined by our highest
 revolutionary ideals, and is a necessity for realizing the magnificent goal of
 socialism's four modernizations.  Our country has been liberated for almost 30 years
 and great changes have taken place in every aspect. Relying on the single-heartedness

 and arduous struggle of all its nationalities and people, our country has already
 turned the poor and backward conditions left behind by the old society into initial
 prosperity.  However, a large population and a poor foundation to start with remain
 the two basic things we cannot forget when we think of problems and do our work.
 Ours is a country with 900 million people of whom 800 million are peasants and pro-
 duction is still undeveloped.  Our country is vast but arable land is not plentiful,
 being only 7 percent of the total area.  Our resources are rich but much of them
 have not been clearly explored, exploited and used.  Thus they are still not real
 resources for production.  Particularly in these last 10 years or so, the destruction
 by Lin Biao and the "gang of four" has caused the national economy to be imbalanced
 and on the brink of collapse. Its serious consequences have not yet been removed.
 What does this show us?  It shows that we cannot but struggle arduously.  The con-
 struction of our four modernizations must proceed from the basic conditions of our
 country and must follow the Chinese way of modernization.  We should unite better.
 with full vigor and vitality; work, study, and produce intensely; persevere in in-
 cluding hard work and frugality in arduous struggle; overcome all difficulties
 along the road forward; and build ours into a great socialist country that is modern
 and strong.
 There are bound to be difficulties on our road forward, and we should rely on the
 revolutionary spirit of arduous struggle to triumph over all of them.  In the recent
 defensive counterattack we anticipated all kinds of difficulties as much as possible,
 but there are always unexpected ones.  We never encountered such complicated terrain
 before, so how could we anticipate it?  No matter how hard we exerted ourselves in
 logistics and supply, some units which undertook deep-thrust operations fought con-
 tinuously and even had to miss several meals.  Fighting is like this.                      Can difficulties
 of one sort or another come about during peacetime construction?  Yes, and in just
 this way.  Unfavorable weather, droughts, and floods are, at least for the foresee-
 able future, unavoidable.  We want to make big strides on all fronts and in all
 trades and professions, but as financial and material resources are limited it is
 not possible for all of us to do so.  Things in the world have always been like this,
 they cannot go smoothly without any difficulties.  Success always accompanies diffi-
 culties and only by overcoming difficulties do we have success.  Difficulties existed
 not only in the past; they exist now and will come in the future.  Many are foresee-
 able but quite a few are not.  Never can we merely look at the side of success and
 not that of difficulites.  We would rather anticipate a few more difficulties.  Of
 course, our difficulties are basically different from those of all decadent and.dying
 classes.  For them, quite a few difficulties are deadly and basically insurmountable.
 All our difficulties can be overcome eventually. On of the reasons why we can over-
 come difficulties is that we have the revolutionary spirit of arduous struggle under
 the party leadership.
 In former war years we had nothing or very little.  Circumstances forced us to
 struggle arduously.  Now with political power for the whole state, ours has become
 the ruling party and our cadres possess varying degrees of authority to muster and
 allocate materials and wealth.  The greed for luxury has grown among some people.
 They become addicted to luxury, let laziness become a habit, enjoy high position and
 live in ease and comfort, and give no serious thought to anything, gravely separating
 themselves from the masses.  Some engage in special privileges beyond the system and
 stipulations, use public office for private gain, turn what is public into private,
 and act generously at the expense of the state for personal luxuries.  Some people
 are not motivated by private gains but they blindly give instructions for spending
 and feel no pain when they-see state wealth being wasted, forgetting that they are

 the servants of the people.  They have absolutely no right to be wasteful if they
 value the slightest possession of the people.  Arduous struggle is the virtue of we
 Communists. For a party member and a cadre, a temporary period of arduous struggle
 is easy, but it is truly not easy to maintain the value of a thrifty and simple life,
 a vigorous revolutionary fighting will, and a heroic and brave self-sacrificing
 spirit for a lifetime.  But we must be able to do it.  If we cannot be unshakable by
 poverty and lowliness, unsubdued by force, unafraid of. hardship or death, and able
 to put worry before pleasure--then how can we be regarded as communist party members
 and revolutionary cadres!
 Of course, advocating arduous struggle does not mean showing no concern for the daily
 life of the masses.  Our goal to struggle arduously is to build ours into a pros-
 perous and wealthy country, increase the living standard of all the people in their
 material culture.  Our cadres must care about the fighters and the higher level
 must care about the lower level.  Each of our units and the leadership of each unit
 should worry about all the problems of the personnel under them.  All problems that
 must be resolved and can be resolved should be resolved to the utmost.  Adopting the
 bureaucratic attitude of indifference toward problems concerning the personal inter-
 ests of the masses is not acceptable.  At the same time we must make clear that the
 improvement of material and cultural life cannot exceed the limit of what our
 economic circumstances allow.  No matter how rational our demands may be, we do not
 have the capability so solve all the problems but can only make gradual improvement
 on the basis of developing production. When production expands and the state has
 more accumulation, many problems can be resolved with relative ease.  It is impossible
 to improve daily life if production makes no progress.and accumulation does not in-
 crease.
 There are many touching deeds of arduous struggle in the defensive counterattack at
 the Chinese-Vietnamese border which we should extensively use to educate our units
 and young people.  To educate the young people we must first educate the middleaged
 and the elderly.  Due to the increase in age, changes in their physical conditions
 and the requirements of work, it is not realistic to demand that leading cadres at
 all levels be exactly the same as the young people in every respect.  It is incorrect
 to engage in equalitarianism.  However, leading cadres should take the lead and ex-
 emplify themselves for the young people to maintain an indomitable fighting will,
 wholeheartedly serve the people, consider the country of 900 million people in every-
 thing we do, strictly implement the fiscal and economic regulations stipulated by
 party and state, and seek no private gains.  We must all struggle arduously, resolute-
 ly and earnestly implement the general and specific policies of the Third Plenary
 Session of the Party Central Committee and contribute to the four modernizations of
 our country.

 tion of the four modernizations, our country must strengthen the party's political
 and ideological work and must have thousands upon thousands of faithful political
 cadres like He Zixiang.
 He Zixiang was a political instructor of the 6th Company of a certain frontier de-
 fense unit.  For a long time this company has undertaken tasks in military-agricultur-
 al production.  Its personnel comes from 8 units and 13 nationalities and most of its
 cadres are newly promoted.  Last November, He Zixing became the political instructor
 of the 6th Company.  To counterattack Vietnamese aggressors the company contingent
 carried out in tense.pre-combat training at the beginning of this year.  Through in-
 depth and painstaking political and ideological work, He Zixing united the whole
 company contingent into a strong fighting collective.  In combat, the political work
 of the 6th Company was active.  Its cadre fighters fought boldly, vigorously and
 tenaciously, completing their mission with distinction.  Hence the company contingent
 was collectively honored with a Merit Citation, First-Class.
 As soon as the defensive counterattack combat mission came down, He Zixing, realigning
 the ideological conditions of the company, promptly convened a conference of the party
 branch to analyze and study it.  Then he adopted a variety of forms to carry out
 education, speedily unifying the ideology of the comrades of the whole company under
 the battle command of the higher level.  The company promptly carried out education
 in patriotism and revolutionary heroism among cadre fighters, putting forth four
 slogans for action:  Fight bravely, fear no sacrifices, fight the enemy and render
 meritorious service, and win honor for the country!  Morale was high among the cadre
 fighters engaged in battle.  A plan for fighting the enemy and rendering meritorious
 service was drawn up from individual fighters to squads and platoons.  Quite a few
 comrades even made out applications to joint the party and the CYL at the front

 lines.  The 6th Company was the first to submit to the battalion party committee a
 resolution to fight the enemy and to render meritorious service.  It also challenged
 other company contingents.
 He Zixing had deep proletarian feelings for all cadre fighters of the company.  He
 cared for and trusted them politically and showed consideration for them and helped
 them in their daily lives.  Squad and platoon leaders are the mainstay of a company
 in battle.  He Zixing found time to hold heart-to-heart talks with them as well as
 with many party and regiment members, understanding their family life, work perfor-
 mance and ideological sentiments, and encouraging them to play emexplary and leading
 roles in work and combat.  The men had never fought in a battle and some began to
 get nervous.  He Zixing mobilized the backbone leaders to work at every level and
 even held individual heart-to-heart talks with these comrades, comparing and analy-i
 zing the various conditions for sure victory by our forces, thus removing their
 ideological worries.  He was also very concerned with some comrades and wholehearted-
 ly helped to solve their real personal and family problems so that they had less
 worries and could go into battle with a light pack.
 He Zixing was good at carrying out active and vigorous propaganda work and giving
 encouragement.  At the crucial moment in battle he was good at putting forth simple
 and effective slogans to inspire the unit.  In the early morning of 17 February the
 No 6 Company reached the assult take-off position.  To remove the nervous feelings
 of some of the comrades he used the time before the attack to give the whole company
 a brief pep talk.  At the end he encouraged them saying:  "We will sing as we return
 from victory and the people of the motherland will line up to welcome us."  Immedi-
 ately, in a wave of laughter, everyone's nervousness turned into a strong desire to
 fight the enemy and to render meritorious service.
 The most powerful and moving political and ideological work was the combat action of
 political cadres who were heroic and fearless and who took the frontal assault.  After
 the battle against the enemy secret service at Xiluolou began, He Zixing and Company
 Commander Bi Xuelin [3968 1331 2651] led the platoon that was responsible for the
 main assault and fought bravely. in the vanguard.  They swiftly jumped into a trench
 .less than 50 meters from the enemy.  The enemy concentrated heavy fire on them and
 the company commander was woui-ded by an enemy grenade.  He Zixing turned around,
 grabbed a machine gun from one of the fighters and shouted:  "Follow me!"  He led a
 squad and charged the left flank of an enemy annular fortification.  Just then he
 noticed that beside him a platoon leader, Zhang Deyu [1728 1779 3768], was exposed
 to enemy gunfire so that he dragged him down and told him to take cover.  Political
 Instructor He reorganized the combat formation and, carrying the machine gun, once
 more led the fighters in an assault on the enemy.  Within a short distance of 10 or
 more meters he bravely exchanged fire with the enemy, swiftly annihilating those on
 higher ground... He Zixing was hit several times in the fighting and gave his life
 heroically.   In his pocket, the comrades found a copy of the "Slogans for Propaganda
 and Agitation in the Battlefield," "Resolution of the No 6 Company to Fight the Enemy
 and Render Meritorious Service," and "Work plan of the Party Branch."  They had
 already been stained with blood.
 To commend Comrade He Zixing's heroic deeds, the Party Committee of the unit post-
 humously awarded him a first-class merit citation and recommended to the higher level
 to grant him the title of "Model Political Instructor."

 DIVISION LEADERSHIP SOLVES PROBLEMS AT BASIC LEVEL
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 8 May 79 p 1
 [Article by Yuan Zhanxian [5913 0594 0341] et al:  "Leaders of a Certain Division
 Improves Work Style by Studying Experiences of Frontline Command"]
 [Text]  During the war of self-defensive counterattack along the China-Vietnam border,
 leading cadres at all levels commanded at the front line.  Their heroic deeds in
 charging forward have encouraged the leading cadres of a certain division of the
 Shenyang Units to plunge into the forefront of improving the leadership's work style.
 These leading comrades, learning from heroism translated into action, have conscious-
 ly displayed the spirit of frontline command by vigorously going down to the basic
 levels and studying new situations and solving new problems.  In the previous period,
 after leaving behind at headquarters two department leaders to maintain daily work,
 the party committee deputy secretaries led 10 party committee members and 65 cadres
 of the headquarters, administrative, and logistics organizations to separately go
 down to the basic levels and guide the units in doing good, solid work on all items.
 After they had gone down into the units, they took.as their model the heroism on the
 battlefield and the spirit of Li Wanyu [2621 8001 0151], deputy commander of a cer-
 tain division of the Guangxi border defense units, in leading the Dagger Battalion to
 charge and shatter enemy positions, and, together with the fighters, crawled, climbed,
 rolled, and attacked in an effort to experience things first hand.  The command of a
 military operation which coordinates various service arms is a new topic in the
 training of basic-level cadres.  In order to improve his skill in commanding combined
 arms operations, political commissar Yu [3768], during an attack exercise carried out
 by an infantry company that involved infantry, tank, artillery, and four other service
 arms, practiced and studied alongside the cadres and fighters.  Drawing on his per-
 sonal experience in this realistic exercise, he guided other infantry companies
 throughout the division in other comprehensive training exercises designed to streng-
 then the companies on attack and defense, and thereby improved the command capability
 of platoon and company cadres.  The party committee had not assigned a task in the
 units to Zhao Wencai [6392 2429 2088], deputy chief of staff, whom it had already
 decided to transfer back to civilian life.  He made three requests for an assignment,
 and finally on his own initiative went to the division's artillery regiment, where,
 together with the cadres and fighters, he studied the experience of infantry-artillery
 coordination during the war of self-defensive counterattack, and did research on re-
 ducing the number of personnel in artillery observation posts and on problems of com-
 manding positions near the front, thereby making artillery training more suited to the
 demands of actual warfare.

 When the leading comrades went down to the basic level, they soon solved the problems.
 they discovered there, simplified the work administrative levels, and improved work
 efficiency.  During a tactical exercise conducted by a certain regiment, only 2
 political instructors of the regiment's 11 companies went to the site of the exercise.
 After discovering this, the leading comrades that very evening convened a meeting
 of cadres at the platoon level and above, and educated the political cadres on the
 necessity of doing good political work linked to military training, and explicitly--
 formulated a system of regular class assignments for political cadres.  During the
 training in the "three defenses," the leading comrades discovered that the soldiers'
 protective equipment was adequate but that that of the horses was not.  The divisional
 leaders at once conducted research with personnel concerned and took measures that
 solved the problem of providing protective equipment for the horses. Division com-
 mander Li Jilei [2621 4949 7191] saw that some company cadres only paid attention to
 seeing that the fighters worked energetically and neglected concern for the living
 conditions of the masses, so he helped them to grasp the problems of taking care of
 the fighters' housing, food, and water.  Together-with rocket launcher soldiers, he
 also studied the. methods of judging wind direction and measuring wind speed so that
 under conditions of.varying wind-force the division obtained good results in rocket
 launcher firing.  Tang [0781], chief, and Li [2621], deputy chief, of the political
 department, investigated 20 companies of a certain regiment and took part in the
 troops' educational studies, attended classes, and answered test questions together
 with the troops.  They discovered that some company instructors did not have time to
 prepare lessons and that the higher elementary classes lacked teaching materials,
 that some companies grouped their fighters into one class regardless of the fighters'
 educational levels, that in the regiment the study time was not uniform and that
 teaching schedules were not grasped well, and over 10 other problems.  They reported
 these problems to the regimental party committee, and together with it, studied
 methods of solution and worked out measures for improving the situation.  At the
 same time, they held in this regiment an on-the-spot meeting on educational studies,
 and widely disseminated the'experiences of the regimental party committee members in
 taking the lead in educational studies, of a company closely integrating educational
 studies with military training, and of the signal communications company in not
 neglecting any part of its educational studies, thereby playing a positive role in
 promoting the troop activities of studying scientific and general knowledge.

 UNITS MAKE EQUIPMENT FOR TRAINING IN ATTACK,. DEFENSE
 Unit 81235's Innovations
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 8 May 79 p 2
 [Article by Bai Yuzhang [4101 3558 4545]:  "Unit 81235 Relies on Masses in Making
 Major Innovations on Equipment"]
 [Text]  Unit 81235 has given full play to the intelligence and wisdom of the key
 technicians among the masses in making major innovations on equipment, thereby
 solving fairly well the problem of insufficient equipment for training in the
 "three attacks and three defenses."
 Because the unit had a shortage of such equipment, several comrades of the unit's
 headquarters got on the job with local methods and, after repeated tests, success-
 fully developed a "practice rocket made of plaster and cement for the old 40-mm
 rocket," which,.like a live rocket, shows the point.of burst.  The cadres and
 fighters all reported that this type of practice rocket serves the purpose for which
 it is intended.  This new achievement made the unit's leadership see that there is a
 great latent potentiality for technical innovation contained in the broad masses,
 and that to fully bring into play the role of the innovators who have emerged among
 the masses is an important way.of solving the problem of the shortage of equipment
 for training in the "three attacks and three defenses."  Therefore, the leaders
 organized the "self-made experts," who have sprung up in large numbers, specifically
 divided up the work with individual responsibility develving on one leader, formed
 an innovation group and made big innovations.
 .The innovation group takes as its key point of attack the unit's difficulties in
 training in the "three attacks and three defenses."  In the past several years,
 sensing that they had never known the real situation with regard to firing at moving
 tanks, the cadres lacked scientific equipment concerning firing data with which to
 train the fighters and the fighters could only rely on different determinations by
 individuals in carrying out firing training.  After more than half a year of hard
 work, the key innovators designed and developed a "firing training kit for the new
 40-mm rocket launcher," which contained nine pieces of equipment and which basically
 solved a series of difficulties such as measuring wind speed, measuring temperature,
 aiming, and checking calculations, in order to create the conditions necessary for
 the unit's antitank training.  They successfully developed.one after the other a
 "gun chamber that simulates the trajectory of a shell fired from an 82-mm recoilless
 gun," a "device for the lead in aiming of the 100-mm tank cannon," an "instrument
 for checking the lead in aiming of an 85-mm cannon," and 16 other pieces of training
 equipment.  Of the 26 kinds of equipment they developed for training in attacking
 tanks, 4 have been popularized for widespread use and 1 has been made the subject for

 a military educational film.  The cadres and fighters, by applying the training
 equipment innovated by the unit itself to training in the "three attacks and three
 defenses," have obtained good results never seen before.  In live-firing tests with.
 the 40-mm rocket launcher, the unit received an overall rating of excellent.
 Unit 83123's Training Ground
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 8 May 79 p 2
 [Article by Huang Zhangjin [7806 1813 6855]:  "Unit 83123 Builds 'Three Attacks'
 Training Ground"]
 [Text]  This year the quality of training in the "three attacks and three defenses"
 of Unit 83123 markedly improved over that of previous. years, and one important reason
 for this improvement was that the unit solved the problem of a training ground for
 the "three attacks."  The party committee of this unit got an early and tight grip
 on the construction of the training ground.  As early as the beginning of the year,
 when preparing the training plan for this year, the party committee put the con-
 struction of a training ground on its important agenda.  They saw that to conscien-
 tiously solve-the training equipment problem and to set up a "three attacks" train-
 ing ground was an important equation in changing the "air-to-air" situation in the
 unit's "three attacks" training and in.improving the quality of this training.  In
 the past few months they have put a lot of effort into getting a good grip on the
 construction of a ground for training against aircraft, airborne forces, and tanks,
 and have prepared to construct six antiaircraft firing preparation ranges.  They
 have now completed one antiaircraft firing preparation range and one live-ammunition
 antiaircraft firing range.  In order to provide antitank training, they are vigorously
 preparing to contruct two moving-target firing ranges and 3 antitank training sites
 by rebuilding.on the foundation of the unit's original three moving-target firing
 ranges.  Zhong Xiuming [6988 4423 2494], commander of a certain subunit of Unit
 83123, led personnel in building an electrically controlled preparation range for
 infantry antiaircraft firing.  While basing themselves on the equipment at hand, the
 personnel also looked at the features of modern warfare from all angles, and installed
 an electrically controlled platform that simulates the flight characteristics of
 enemy aircraft when changing speed and direction, thereby insuring that antiaircraft
 training comes close to actual warfare.
 Unit 84806's Teaching Plans

 [Text]  The shortage of systematic teaching materials is a difficult.point in "three

 have vigorously solved the difficulties of companies in this respect.  Chief of Staff
 Hu Yuanchun [5170 6678 2504] personally organized 10 staff officers who had practical
 experience and instructors to compile teaching plans.  They'asked leaders who had
 taken part in battle to discuss their knowledge gained from personal experience;

 features of enemy armies, and, proceeding on the basis of the actual situation in
 the unit with.regard to existing equipment, compiled a "technical teaching plan for
 the three attacks and the three defenses: and a "tactical teaching plan for in-
 dividual soldiers and squads."  These two teaching plans assimilated the strong
 points of former teaching plans and summed up .the unit's training experiences.
 From basic theoretical knowledge to specific training movements, the compilers
 strove for clarity and understanding.  After the initial drafts were written, the
 compilers took them to companies engaged in advanced training and to units engaged
 in concentrated training, and solicited the opinions of the squad leaders, platoon
 leaders, and instructors who were organizing the training.  Afterward, they took
 the revised teaching plans to the companies and organized tryouts by the squad leaders
 and platoon leaders.  In this way, with the help of the higher-level departments con-
 cerned, and after five sessions of tryouts, revisions, and additions and after many
 examinations and approvals by leaders, the compilation team came up with the final
 versions of the plans and then distributed them to every company, thereby solving
 the teaching difficulties of the companies.

 REGIMENT IMPROVES TACTICS BY STUDYING ACTUAL WARFARE
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 8 May 79 p 2
 [Article by Fan Yiin [3058 1377 2430] et al:  "Absorbing Combat Experience, Improving
 Tactical Training"]
 [Text]  A certain regiment of the Beijing Units has absorbed the experiences of the
 war of self-defensive counterattack, has changed its idea and habit of training only
 a single service arm, and has vigorously organized tactical drills that coordinate
 the various service arms belonging to the regiment..
 In past military training, the infantry elements, the mechanized gun elements, and
 the specialized elements trained separately.  Although separated,by only a thin
 partition, the infantry elements and the artillery elements did not understand each
 other.  After studying the war of self-defensive counterattack, they made a point of
 carrying out tactical training exercises that coordinated . all. the service arms.  For
 example, when-strengthening the training topic concerning an assault by an infantry
 company on an enemy tank platoon.that had not attained a firm foothold, an 82-mm
 recoilless gun platoon, a 82-mm mortar platoon, and a squad of engineers were attach-
 ed to the infantry company, and each drilled repeatedly over unfamiliar terrain and
 under complex conditions.  During the drills, many commanders "lost the chariot for
 the cannon" [a reference to Chinese chess] and did not act in concert.  Focusing on
 the problems that had been revealed, the regimental organization took appropriate
 measures for their step-by-step solution.  It organized the various service arms to
 brief each other on weaponry knowledge and combat principles, and organized the
 cadres to study the principles of tank combat.  The combat training department put
 together an educational slide show entitled "Analysis of Tank Warfare in the Middle
 East" and explained topography to the companies, and also organized the companies to
 analyze the principles of battles involving infantry-artillery and infantry-tank
 coordinated operations in the war of self-defensive counterattack. Afterward, the
 second comprehensive drill was conducted through repeated drills, and there has been
 a great improvement in the tactical standards of the officers and men.
