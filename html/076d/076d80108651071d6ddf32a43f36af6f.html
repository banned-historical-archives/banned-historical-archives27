			  	[Text]    	Beijing,   	26  Dec   	(JIJI  PRESS)-A  Chinese  official  said  Friday  a  conclusion
			 	will  be  reached  "in  the  not  remote  future"  on  the  ongoing  review  of  all  existing
			 	contracts  for  imports  of  plants  fr~om  Japan.
			 	Wei  Fengqi,   	deputy  director  of  the  Fuurth  Bureau  of  the  Foreign  Trade  Ministry,
	 	'			also  told  representatives  of  the  Association  for  the  Promotion  of  International
			 	Trade,   	Japan,   	that  as  soon  as  the  Chinese  decide  on  specific  plant  pro~ects  which
			 	will  be  scrapped,  postponed  or  continued,   	the  Japanese  quarters  concerned  would
			 	be  informed  of  the  decision  through  National  Machinery  Import  and  Export  Corp.
			 	Wei  did  not  disclosz  when  the  decision  will  be  made.
			  	But  Chinese  sources  said  agreement  was  already  reached  at  a  meeting  of  comm~unist
			  	party  officials,  opened  here  around  last  16  December,   	to  step  up  the  current
			  	readjustment  of  China's  economic  programs  and  shorten  its  capital  construction
			  	plan.
			  	Therefore,  what  to  do  about  plant  pro~ ects  involving  foreign  interests  is  likely
			  	to  be  formally  decided  early  next  year.
			  	Japan's  plant  contracts  with  China  since  1979  have  reached  approximately  800  million
			  	dollars,  according  to  Japanese  business  sources  here.    	Indications  are  that  several
			  	contracts   	for  petrochemical  plants  wo~ld  be  cancelled.

		    	a  washboard?"    	Jiang  Qing  had  raised  her  voice.
		    	Xiaojing  said  nothing.    	She  continued  rubbing  the  child  gently.							  	`
		    	"Stop  it!"    	Jiang  Qing  came  up,   	seizing  the  towel  from  Xiac~ing's  hand.    	Clumsily

		    	laughing  and  playful,   	cry  in  fear.    	Xiaojing  hurried  to  fondle  her.    	Jiang  Qing
		    	curtly  put   	the  child  into  Xiao~ing's  arms.
		    	"That's  your  job,   	you  job!    	If  she  has  any  skin  trouble,   	take  care  of  it!"
		    	The  Chairman  Denounces  Personal  Enjoyment;  Jiang  Qing  Complains  of  a  Miserable  Life

		    	scolding  of  Jiang  Qing  merged  into  a  cacophony  that  charged  the  air  with  tension!
		    	There  was  a  sound  from  outside  ~he  door.    	Xiaojing  alertly  stood  up,   	the  child  in
		    	her  arms.
		    	"Why  don't  you  hurry  up?    	If  she  catches  cold,   	you  must  do  everything  for  her--send
 -		   	for  a  doctor,   	give  her  injections...."    	Jiang  Qing  was  still  letting  off  steam.
		     	Chairman  Mao  walked  in  knowingly.    	Jiang  Qing's  recent  way  of  living  and  her  atti-
		     	tude   	toward  the  working  personnel  had  come  to  his  attention.    	He  sat  down  and  said		   	_
 -		   	nothing.    	He  had  a  pufi  at  his  cigarette.
		     	"Isn't  it  exasperating?.   	She  is  just  a  clumsy  country  woman.    	She  forgets  whatever
 y		   	ouu  say  to  her.    	Well,   	just  look  at  your  baby's  eyes  and  skin."    	Pointing  to  the
		     	child,  Jiang  Qing  turned  to  Chairman  Mao,  righteously  pleading  her  case.						-
		     	"What's   	the  matter?    	Everything  seems  all  right  to  me!"  Chairman  Mao  said  slowly,
		     	with  a  frown.
		     	"Everything  is  all  right?    	You  may  as  well  find  out  for  yourself!"  Jiang  Qing
		     	turned  around  and  plonked  herself  down  on  the  chair  in  an  explosion  of  anger.
		     	"Calm  down!    	Why  have  you  made  a  mess  of  things  and  disturbed  eWeryone's  peace?
		     	The  working  personnel  in  our  home  are  a  tiny  part  of  the  revolutionary  ranks.    	They
		     	are  laboring  people  working  for  the  party.    	They  are  not  meant  to  wait  upon  you			 	-
		     	personally.    	You  musC  rid  yourself  of  your  petty  bourgeois  habits.    	Quit  living
		     	for   	~njoyment,"  Chairman  Mao's  voice  was  clear  and  forceful.

 -			Jiang  Qing,   	as  he   	stalked  out  of  the  room  in  anger.
		 	Alone  in  the  room,  Jiang  Qing  cried  her  heart  out.    	The  more  she  thought  about  it
		 	the  more  upset  she  got.    	She  had  recently  turned  a  deaf  ear  to  Chairman  Mao's				  	~
 -			occasional  criticisms  and  words  of  advice.    	She  felt   	::hat  the  chairman  did  not  care
		 	for  her!    	Bickering  had  become  the  order  of  the  day.    	Now  after  crying  for  s  whole
		 	day,   	she  felt  she  had  not  done  enough.    	She  must  go  the  whole  hog  and  make  her
		 	presence  felt.    	She  failed  to  show  up  for  supper.    	No  one  sent  for  her.    	Xiaojing			 	_
		 	fetched  her  food.    	She  ate  only  the  soup  and  soon  fell  asleep.    	The  second  day  she				_
		 	did   	not  get  up.    	She  cried  again.    	She  ate  nothing  and  contented  herself  with  only
		 	the  meat  soup  and  milk.    	The  thi.rd  day  she  still  failed  to  get  an  expected  call
 -			from  Chairman  Mao.    	She  could  not  take  it  any   	longer,   	the  pains  of  hunger  were
		 	gnawing  at  her  stomach.    	She  started  eating  regularly.    	This  time  around,   	she  did
		 	not   	see  Chairman  Mao  for  several  days,   	keeping  out  of  his  sight.
		 	Though  Xiaojing  had  never  been  to  school,   	she  knew  many  Chinese  characters,				    	_
		 	thanks  to  self-educat~on.    	As  a  dry  nurse  �or  Jiang  Qing's  baby  and  a  housekeeper,
		 	she  made   	the  most   	of  her  time.    	After  work  every  day,   	she  found  time  for  cultural
		 	stud ies.    	When  finding  her  so  occupied,   	Jiang  Qing  did  not  encourage  her  but  instead
		 	showed  her  displeasure.    	She  fe].t  that  there  was  arways  work  xemaining  to  be  done			 	-
		 	and   	~hat  Xiaojing  could  always  find  sometning  to  do.

		    	"All   	right,   	I'm  going  to  bed."    	Xiaojing  darkened  the  kerosene  lamp,   	and  got  ready
		    	to  go  to  bed.
		    	"Oh!    	If  I  hadn�t  dropped  in,   	you  would  have  kept   	the  lamp  burning  bright,   	reading.

			 	Going  Well  for  He  Zizhen  and  Jiao  Jiao
			 	After  victory  in  the  Sino-Japanese  war,   	in  the  early  summer  of  1946,  Zhu  Jiaren
			 	and  'Lhou  Li  went  to  Moscow  and  stayed  there  for  about  ha]f  a  year.    	At  that  time,
			 	the   	two  children  of  Chairman  Mao,  Anying  and  Anqing,  were  studying  in  a  vocational
			 	college  in  Moscow.    	Very  often  they  came  to  visit  Zhu  Jiaren  and  Zhou  Li.    	The  two
			 	brothers  gave  people  the  impression  that  they  were  full  of  youthful  spirits  and
		-		 	vitality.    	The  Zhu  couple  were  particularly  pleased  with  their  fluent  Rus-
			  	sian.    	However,  what  worried  the  Zhu  couple  was  the  health  of  sister  He  Zizhen  and
			 	her  child  who  went  to  Moscow  in  1937   	to  receive  treatment.    	One  day,  Zhu  Jiaren
			  	consulted  Nikolayev,   	a  Soviet  liaison  officer.
			  	"I  have  heard  that  Comrade  He  Zizhen  is  staying  in  an  asylum  in  ivanovo.    	I  wonder
			 	what  happened  to  her  child.    	We  are  anxious  about  their  life  and  health,  would  you
			  	please  give  us  the  details  about  what  has  happened  to  them?"
			  	Zhu  Jiaren  coul~  speak  �luent  Russian.    	He  sat  on  a  beautiful  sofa,   	immersed  in
	 	.		 	conversa~ion  with  Nikolayev  who  sat  next  to  him;  his  broad  forehead  showed  his
			  	worry  and  he  looked  soberly  at  Nikolayev,  at  times  looking  at  his  wife  Zhou  Li  who
			  	sat  opposite  him.
			  	"She's  not  in  a  good  mental  state.    	The  doetor  diagnosed  her  illness  as  schizo-
			  	phrenia,   	therefore  she  was  sent  to  the  mental  hospital.    	Her  daughte~r  is  studying
			  	in  an  international  primary  school.    	She  is  in  good  health."    	Nikolayev  answered

	 	-		 	Zhou  Li  asked  anxiously.    	Her  spoken  Russian  was  not  too  good,   	Zhu  Jiaren  had  to

		    	with  joy  and  her   	smile  showed  her  beautiful  teeth.
		    	A  week  later  they  received  Nikolayev's  reply:

		     	Life  in  a  Foreign  Land  Revaged  by  War
		     	Nikolayev  did  not  give  an  immediate  answer  because  he  was  not  in  a  position  to
		     	make  decisions.
		     	Zhou  Li  who  was   	sitting  beside  Zhu  Jiaren  iu~ediately  suggested  to  him:
		     	"How  about  this,   	tell  them  we  must  meet  her  and  her  child  Jiao  Jiao  in  Moscow.

		     	Zhu  Jiaren  agreed  with  a  nod  and  immediately  spoke  to  Nikolayev  in  Russian.
		     	"All  right!    	I'll  try  my  best.    	Please  wait  for  the  reply."

				[Text]    	Zhu  Jiaren  was  reading  TIME  Magazine  while  Zhou  Li  was  listening  to  the
    	-		  	radio  in  another  part  of  the  house.
				"Hi!    	Welcome.  How  are  you!"    	Zhu  Jiaren  hurriedly  put  down  the  magazine  and  stood
				up  to  meet  them.
				After  they  were  seated,  Zhou  Li  heard  thQir  voices  .and  came  in  to  join  them.    	As
				soon  as  she  saw  the  guests,   	she  exeended  her  hands.										  	_

				"Ah!    	How  is  your  health  and  how  is  Jiao  Jiao?"    	Zhou  Li  asked  enthusiastically
				and  looked  at  sister  He  carefully.    	She  was  weariz~g  a  French-style  round  rimless
				hat,   	a  Western-style  dark-grey  woolen  jacket,   	a  dark  skirt  and  a  pair  of  low-heeled
				round-toed  shoes.    	She  looked  fully  conscious  with  some  facial  expression,  but  her
   	-		  	eyes  were  dull  and  her  responses  were  slaw.
			 	"I'm  fine!"  He  Zhizhen  answered  briefly  with  a  smile.    	However,  she  slightly
			 	knitted  her  eyebrows.    	She  then  turned  her  head  and  asked  the  girl  standing  beside
    	-		  	her  to  say  "auntie."    	The  little  girl  was  sweet  and  lively.    	Her  eyebrows,   	eyes,
			 	nose,   	mouth  and  other  facial  features  all  resembled  those  of  Chairman  Mao,  however,
    	-		   	her  Chinese  was  not  very  good  because  she  was  very  small  when  she  come  to  the			     	-
			 	Soviet  Union.
			 	Zhou  Li  took  out  a  box  of  chocolates  for  them  to  eat  and  gave  each  of  them  a  cup
			 	of  lemon  tea.
			 	"We  have  been  looking  forward  to  meeting  you,"  said  Zhou  Li.
    	_		   	"Yes,"  He  Zizhen  answered  briefly.

			 	Her  Beloved  Son  Dies  in  the   	First  Year  When  She  Arrives   	in  the  Soviet  Union;
		_		 	Her  Life  is  Hard  During  the  Wartime  and  She  Becomes  Quarrelsome
			 	Zhou  Li  adopted  many  methods  in  talking  with  He  Zizhen.    	Within  3  hours,   	she  be-				~
			 	came  talkative  and  lively.    	Thus,  Zhu  Jiaren  and  Zhou  Li  got  some  important  infor-
			 	mar.ion  out  of  her.																		    	-
			 	During  t.he  first  year  in  Moscow,  He  Zizhen  gave  birth  to  a  baby  boy.    	The  baby  was
			 	healthy  and  beautiful.    	Unfortunately,  he  caught  a  cold  and  suffered  from  pneumonia.
		_		 	As  he   	failed  to  respond   	to  medical  treatment  in  hospital,  he  died.    	He  Zizhen  ~aas
			  	grieved  at  his  death.    	She   	thought  the  disease  was  curable.    	Since  the  hospital
			  	authorities  wanted  to  keep  the  hospital  well  ventilat~d,   	they  allowed  cold  air  in.
		-		 	Moreover,   	they  did  not  look  after  the  child  properly.    	Thus,   	the  child's  condition		   	-
		-		 	deteriorated.    	Because  of  this,   	she  quarrelled  with  the  hospital  authorities.
			  	Later,   	Jiao  Jiao  also  caught  a  cold.    	Instead  of  sending  her  to  hospital,   	she
			  	asked  a  doctor  to  con.z  and  see  her  at  home.    	The  doctor  advised  her  to  send  the
	 	~		  	girl  to  hospital,  but  she  refused.    	Tney  had  an  argument.    	Later,  Jiao  Jiao's
			  	condition  imT~roved,  but  her  relationship  with  the  ~~fficer  in  charge  of  the   	Inter-
			  	national  Ch:ildren's  Hospital  deteriorated.    	Sometimes,   	they  even  quarrelled  over
			  	trivial  day-to-day  matters.    	This  was  particularly  true  during  the  Russian-German
			  	war.     	In  or,3er  to  defeat  German  fascism,   	the  Russians  lived  in  great  difficulty.
			  	The  room  ten:perature  was  more  than  10  degrees  below  zero  and  there  was  no  heating
			  	system.    	They  only  used  a  little  firewood  to  make  a  fire  and  it  was  extremely  cold.
	 	_		  	Each  person  was  given  3   	liang  of  black  bread,   	a  few  potatoes  and  preserved  cucum-
			  	ber.    	There  was  a  shortage  of  milk,  but[er  and  meat.    	Occasionally,   	they  got  more
			  	food.    	Hawever,   	it  was  never  enough.    	People  lived  in  hunger  and  cold.    	While  male
			  	comrades  were  fighting  bravely  on  the  frontline,  women  were  engaged  in  production
			  	in  the  rear.    	They  suffered  hardships  and  worked  under  pressure.    	Some  people  were
			  	full  of  confidence  while  others  held  a  negative  attitude  and  lost  revolutionary			 	,
			  	optimism.
			  	Not  Proficient  in  Russian,   	She  Is  Treated  Harshly;   	Unable  to  Return  to  China,
			   	She  Becomes  More  Desperate  and  Downhearted												   	-
			  	Tne  officer  in  charge  of  the  International  Children's  Hospital  was  bad-tempered.				-
			   	In  some  aspects,  he  did  not  take  very  good  care  of  children  from  abroad.    	Moreover,		  	_
			  	he  often  quarrelled  wi[h  people.    	He  Zizhen  lived  in  great  difficulty  and  some-
			   	times  she  made  demands  regarding  living  conditions.    	However,  her  Russian  ~~as  poor
			   	and  her  demands  were  frequently  turned  down.    	Moreover,   	she  was  often  treated
			   	harshly.    	Living  conditions  in  all  areas  during  wartime  were  depressing.    	There
	 	_		  	had   	long  been  friction  between  them  and  this  developed  into  antagonism.    	Although
			   	there  was  no  profound  hatred  between  He  Zizhen  and  the  officer  in  charge,   	they  did
			   	not   	speak  to  each  other.    	Although  they  were  not  enemies,   	they  often  quarrelled
			   	over  trivialities.    	Ho~:~ver,   	the  officer  in  charge  should  be  held  responsible  for
			   	this.
	 	-		  	When  the  officer  in  charge  lost  his  temper,  He  Zizhen  was  frustrated  because  she
			   	did  not  understand  Russian  well.    	When  He  Zizhen  tried  to  reason  with  him  in  mixed
			   	Russian  and  Chinese,   	the  latter  was  unable  to  understand  her  completely.    	Thus,   	the
			   	gap  widened  and  misunderstanding  deepened.    	They  could  never  understand  or  excuse

			     	Because  of  the  quarrel,   	the  person  in  charge  of  the  kindergarten  hated  He  Zizhen's
	   	-		   	guts.    	She  was  obsessed  with  individualism  and  she  considered  it  unfair  for  Rus-
			     	sians   	to   	tighten  their  belts  and  economize  for  the  sake  of  looking  after  foreigners.
	   	_		   	She  was  preocc~pied  with  such  ideas  and  completely  forgot  about  internationalism.
			     	The  m~re  she  thought  about   	the  quarrel,   	the  more  she  found  He  Zizhen  unreasonable
			     	and  a  willful  troublemaker.    	She  found  her  selfish,  egocentric,   	and  argumentative.
			     	Thus,   	she  determined  that  He  Zizhen  must  be  mentally  ill.    	In  for  a  penny,   	in  for
			     	a  pound,   	in  a  trice  she  wrote  a  complaint  and  imposed  an  unwarranted  charge  on  her;
					"schizophrenia,"  and  she  reported  her  illness  to  the  superior.    	After  the  superior
			     	had  listened  to  her  statement,  he  approved  sending  He  Zizhen  to  an  asylum.    	At  that
					time,  He  Zizhen  disagreed  with  this  act  and  resisted  resolutely.    	People  thought
					that  she  was  suffering  from  mental  illness  again.    	Half-supporting  and  half-drag-
					ging  her,   	they  took  her  away.
					After  that,   	the  person  in  charge  of  thE~  kindergarten  was  perfectly  satisfied.    	On
					the  other  hand,   	He  Zizhen  was  imprisonec:  in  the  mental  hospital,   	suffering  torment

	   	-		   	one  to  rescue  her  from  the  abyss  of  misery.    	She  was  desperate  and  melancholy.
					Now,   	suddenly  came  the  good  news.    	At  last,   	:;he  could  leave  the  prison  and  go
					safely  with  her  daughter  to  Moscow  to  meet  her  dear  friends  from  the  motherland.

			  	When  they  were  having  dinner  one  evening,   	Zhu  Jiaren  was  lost  in  thought,  he  said,
			  	"I'm  not  timid  in  doing  anything.    	To  take  Zizhen  from  the  mental  hospital  and
			  	bring  her  home  is  understandable,   	this  is  class  feeling;  everybody  is  pleased  with
			  	it.    	I  discovered  that  the  children  studying  in  Moscow  all  heamed  with  smiles  when
			  	they  learnt  about  it  and  went  to  visit  her  everyday.    	What's  on  my  mind  is  that  I
			  	don't  know  how  Jiang  Qing  will  rea~t  to  this.    	However,   	I'll  not  withdraw  because
			  	of  her."
	  	-			"Of  course,  we  came  here  initially  to  request  a  meeting  with  her  until  we  realized
			  	that  she  was  suffering  from  mild  melancholia,   	that's  why  we  will  not  have  her  sent
			  	back  to  the  hell  in  ivanovo  and  have  decided   	to  take  her  back  to  China.    	We  are
			  	doing  this   	from  the  moral  standpo~.:~t  of  a  communist.    	Let's  settle  it  this  way!
			  	Moreover,   	the  girl  is  Chairman  M3o's  daughter."    	Zhou  Li  agreed.    	Her  fair  white
			  	face  blushed  scarlet  with  excitement  at  what   	they  had  done.
			  	"All  will  be  done  according  to  organizational  procedures,   	regardless  of   	the  fact
			  	that  it  concerns  the   	family  affairs  of  Chairman  Mao.    	Recently  I  have  had  time  to

				With  such  feelings  in  mind,  He  Zizhen  went  with  Zt?u  Jiaren,  Zhou  Li  and  her  daugh-
				ter.    	They  took  a  special  railroad  car  t~  Harbin.    	Liu  Liang  and  his  wife  of  the

		     	the  CCP  Withdraws  from  Yanan  to  Preserve  Vital  Forces
		     	Chairman  Mao  read  her  mind  immediately  and  he  said,"  you  coward,   	leave  here  if  you
		     	like!"
		     	Hearing  this,  Jiang  Qing's  enthusiasm  was  dan~.pened.    	She  stood  stupidly  in  the  mid-		    	_
		     	dle  of  the  room.    	Although  outwardly  she  was  calm  and  collected,  she  was  very
		     	annoyed.    	She  knew  well  enough  that  she  shot.ld  not  lose  k~er  temper  and  provolce
		     	quarrels,  so  she  kept  silent.    	Ten  days  had  past,  and  there  were  air  raids  all  the		     	-
     	_		 	time,   	there  could  be  close  fighting  or  bomb  explosions  at  any  time.    	Chairman  Mao
		     	was  firm  and  resolute.    	He  commanded  the  war  throughout  the  country  in  an  orderly
     	=			way.    	In  the  middle  of  March,  the  KZlf  launched  a  pincer  attack  on  Yanan.    	They  were		.
     	-			only  15  li  away  from  the  town  center  and  there  were  more  booms  of  guns.
				The  central  authorities  decided  to  withdraw  from  Yanan  then.    	The  troops  passed
				through  the  Yanan  airport  and  moved  to  the  north.    	Chairman  Mao  made  the  decision
				for  he  considered  preserving  vital  forces  more  important  than  losing  a  tawn  or  a
     	_		 	place.    	He  wanted  to  lure  the  enemy  in

				constant  moving.    	Ais  strategy  was  to  annihilate  the  enemy  at  the  most  favorable
				time.													   	~
				The  ambulance  in  wt?ich  chairman  rode  was  blasted  to  pieces  by  the  enemy  soon  after
     	-		 	the  withdrawal,   	therefore  he  had  to  proceed  on  horse.    	The  enemy  troops  was  3ust
				on  the  other  side  of  the  hill,   	and  firing  might  break  out  at  any  time.    	At  that
				time,   	the  weather  was  s~.ill  cold  and  ehe  snow  had  not  melted.    	The  northwest  wind

				revolution;   	their  resolute  will  overcame  every  difficulty.    	Whea  they  recalled  the
				days  during  the  long  march,   	they  were  full  of  confidence.

		 	The  plane  met  a  cold  front  when  it  was  not  far  away  from  Lake  Baiic~~l.    	It  suddenly				~
		 	dropped  by  2,000  meters  as  a  result  of  the  change  in  atmospheric  press~ire.    	No
		  	accident  occurred,   	due  to  the  superb  skills  of  the  pilot.    	Jiang  Qing's  face  turned
		 	pale.    	She  stared  and  gave  a  cry  of  fear.    	The  guards  were  scared  by  her  actions.		    	~
		  	Things  seemed  to  calm  down  in  another  momenx.    	Jiang  Qing  kept  mumbling  whi.le  1y-
		  	ing  down,   	and  could  not  speak  clearly.    	Others  were  startled  by  this  scene  and
		 	were  busy  attending  her.
		  	The  plane  came  to  its  destination  on  the  third  day.    	Alighting  from  the  plane,   	she				'
  '			saw  only  a  few  people  in  the  airport.    	There  were  no  senior  ufficial.s.    	She  felt
		  	dejected  at  once.    	A  slim  and  ta11  woman  interpreter  came  forward  and  introduced
		  	herself  as   	(Kardunova).    	Ir~  full  dress,  an  assistant  of  the  international  depart-
  -	     	ment  slightly  bowed  to  her.    	A  few  cars  were  parked  at  the  airport.    	That  was  all.
		  	Jiang  Qing  Feels  Dejected  Because  No  Senior  Soviet  Officials  Came  to  Receive  Her
		  	at  Airport;   	the  Stalin  Villa  is  Tastefully  Furnished										   	;
		  	Jiang  Qing  and  her  party  were  received  in  the  Stalin  villa  in  the  Moscow  suburbs.			  	I
  -			The  surroundings  were  of  an  exotic,   	unique  style.    	The  villa  was  densely  enclosed
		  	by  tall,   	sturdy  pine  trees.    	The  place  was  quiet  and  the  air  fresh.    	The  villa  was				~
		  	furnished  fn  good   	taste.    	In  addition  to  the  sleeping  and  dining  rooms,   	there  were				~
		  	a  small  room  for  watching  movies  and  other  rooms  for  playing  billiards  and  table			   	;
		  	tennis.    	Outside  the  villa,   	there  was  a  tennis  court  where  the  ground  was  like  a
		  	carpet  of  green  grass.
		  	Special  mention  should  be  made  of  the  large  group  of  hosts  there;   	the  house
		  	manageress  was  a  communist  who  entered  the  com~unist  party  during  the  period  of			    	,
		  	the  national  defense  war  and  a  family  member  of  a  martyr.    	She  was  plump,  love].y
		  	and  very  kind.    	She  always  smiled,   	nodded  and  courteously  made  waq  for  Jiang  Qing			 	j
   	-			whenever  they  met.    	She  invariably  addressed  Jiang  Q~ng  "lady"  or  "mistress"  and			   	I
		   	frequently  offered  light  refreshments  to  her.    	The  guards,   	the  chauffeur,  the				 	I

		   	(Kardunova)   	did  not  speak  Chinese  fluently  and  could  not  help  her  muct~.    	So,  she
   	_			was  not  happy.    	This  was  not  strange  at  all  because  she  had  a  social  nature.    	How-		     	~

		     	when  Jiang  Qing  was  having  a  hard  time  in  swallawing  the  tube.    	Sowever,   	she  thought

				for   	functional  over-sensitivity,   	there  was  no  other  organic  pathological  changes.
				There  Was  no  need  for  other  medical  treatment  and  the  doctor  decided  that  she  should

			  	after  1970,  with  ability  decreasing  with  age.    	Many  of  the  military  research
			  	personnel  were  named  to  the  posts  because  of  their  political  reliabilitp  than
	  	-			their  technical  qualif~cations,   	so  tbat  their  ability  is  often  inferior  to  Chat

			  	uuite.    	I~foreover,   	the  ffilitary  industrial  brnnches  are  rigidly  fractionaLi.zed,  eo
			  	that  resear~hers  and  technicians  are  often  unable  to  obtain  iaformation  from  tiheir
			  	awn  organization,  much  less  from  outside.
			  	The  antiscieace  p~licy  im~lemented  during  the  period  of  tbe  Cultural  Revolution
	  	-			and  the  "gang  of  four"  significantly  hindered  military  research  and  development.
	   	-			Long-range  research  plans  were  senerely  curtailed,  the  military  industry  and  the
			   	technical  research  institute  were  closed  dawn,  laboratories  were  plundered  and
			   	destroyed,  and  umiversity  professors  and  other  scientists  were  harassed  or  dis-
			   	graced.    	There  were  indeed  a  few  exceptions,  wherein  personnel  were  protected
			   	from  political  activities  by  the  party  organization  and  research  and  development
			   	plans  were  1~.ept  from  being  interrupted.    	This  applies  to  experts  in  the  fields
			   	of  missiles  aad  atomic  energy.    	These  experts,   	thouglz  slowed  dawn,  were  able  to
	  	_			continue  their  work.    	Although  a  new  policy  concerning  science  and  technology
	   	-			has  been  implemented  in  China,  remnants  of  the  antiscience  pexiod  still  abound  in
			   	in  the  attitude  of  many  military  researchers.    	Due  to  the  unnecessary  apprehen-
			   	sion  that  there  might  be  another  political  change  of  direction,  many  military   	~
			   	scientists  and  technologists  do  not  exert  themselves,  while  many  professors  and
	   	-			scientists  60  to  65  years  of  age  who  were  exposed  to  criticism  which  cut  deep
			   	into  flesh  and  bone  during  Che  Cultural  Revolution  probably  do  not  feel  enthusi-
			   	astic  enough  about  anything  to  begin  to  tackle  any  job.
			   	Until  quite  recently,  China  almost  entirely  disregarded  the  need  for  skilled
			   	management  of  military  research  and  development.    	The  basic  research  fram  which
			   	new  imawledge  is  born  had  been  forbidden  for  more  than  10  years.    	The  applied  re-
			   	search  from  which  actual  results  are  obtained  had  been  interrupted  by  the  Cul-
			   	t~ral  Revolut~on  and  was  not  begun  again  imtil  1976.    	Development  of  practical
			   	applications  of  the  results  of  research  had  been  only  parCially  successful.    	A
	   	_			high  degree  of  development  had  been  almost  completely  disregarded.    	Routi~e  devel-
			   	opmeat  work  had  been  aimed  at  relatively  small  reconstruction  of  exi~ting  prod-
			   	ucts,   	so  that  these  goals  could  be  achieved  based  on  research  and  development
			   	carried  out  in  the  past.    	Thus,  almost  all  weapons  made  in  China  have  been  pat-
	   	-			terned  after  outdated  Soviet  weapons,  while  a  great  deal  of  technical  difficul-
			   	ties  have  been  encountered  during  the  process.
			   	Tiie  weakness  of  China`s  military  industrial  production  can  be  seen  in  every  tech-
			   	nical  fiel.d,  from  basic  research  to  the  maintenance  of  the  finished  products.
	   	'			TEie  most  important  shortcoming  of  the  military  as  well  as  the  nonmilitary  machine
			   	industry-design  techniques  and  maaufacturing  know~-how--is  rendered  evea  more
			   	profound  by  adaitional  restrictions  imposed  on  production.    	These  restrictions
			   	include  poor  production  and  quality  control,  a  limited  1eve1  of  staadardizatioa,
			   	inadequate  machine  tools,  a  limited  number  of  tools,   	and  a  shortage  of  parts,
			   	special  metals,  and  othex  materials.

					The  State  Scientific  and  Technological  Commission  (SSTC)  has  also  reappeared,  aad
					it  seems  to  be  charged  with  broad  authority  for  supervising  the  planning  and  cap-
					ital  allotment  for  all  scieatific  and  technologic~l  businesses.    	This  co~ission
					has  thus  taken  over  a  portion  of  the  function  from  the  military  authority  which
					used  to  be  in  the  hands  of  the  National  Defense  Scientific  Technological  Co~is-
					sion  (NDSTC).    	The  NDSTC  will  probably  conCinue  to  be  responsible  for  scieatific
	     	-		 	a.nd  technological  planning  related  to  military  matters,  but  direct  supervisory
					authority  over  the  military  research  organizations  and  research  institutes  ap-
	     	-		 	pears  to  have  passed  to  each  individual  vnit.    	For  example,  it  is  said  that  there
					were  51  research  organizations  imder  the  direct  control  of  the  Fourth  Ministrq  of
					Machine  Building   	(in  charge  of  the  electronics  industry)  toward  the  end  of  1977.
					What  has  become  apparent  from  this  reorganizatinn  is  the  desire  of  the  leadership
					to  strengthen  its  control  over  the  defense  industry  in  order  to  minimize  latent
					opposition  by  the  mi.litary  toward  the  ne~w  policy.    	Defease-related  organizations
	     	-		 	have  been  accustomed  to  claiming  priority  to  get  special  treatment  i~  the  allot-
					ment  of  rare  and  scarce  materials,   	of  scientists  and  technologists,  of  precision
					ma.chinery  and  tools,   	and  of  high-quality  imported  goods.    	Through  the  present
					organization,   	the  Chinese  Government  naW  has  a  mechanism  for  sharing  these  rare
					and  scarce  materials  with  the  producers  af  civiliaa  industrial  facilities.    	Dis-
	     	-		 	tribution  of  thes~  materials  used  to  be  tampered  with  by  the  buresucratic  group
			-		 	dominated  by  the  PLA,  just  as  it  was  when  Lin  Biao  was  in  paw~er.
					China's  aim  is  to  try  to  a~oid  duplication  between  the   	[nonmilitary]   	and  military
					departments  and  within  the  defense  industry  itseZf,  so  that  resources  may  be  con-
				 	centrated  on  the  most  important  pro3ects.    	As  a  result  of  this  reorganization,
				 	China  will  naw  be  able  to  carry  out  its  military  production  according  to  aa  order
				 	of  economic  priority  and  ~11  be  able  to  utilize  existing  facilities  and  equipmeat
					more  effectively.    	This  movement  vividly  reflects  China's  need  to  gain  maximum
				 	productiaa  from  its  domestic  industrial  faci]ities.
				 	Expectations  From  the  West
				 	At  the  same  time  that  the  bureaucratic  structure  of  the  militarq  industry  compleac
					was  being  reorganized  in  China,  investigations  into  technical  aid  from  the  West
					~rere  being  broadly  carried  out.    	Since  late  1976,  China  has  launched  a  large-scale
				 	effort  to  investigate  foreign  military  technology  and  production  processes  over  a
				 	very  wide  range.    	Betwesn  1976  and  mid-1979,  many  militar~,  technical,  and  indus-
				 	trial  delegations  com~rising  several  thousands  of  persons  were  dispatched  abroad
				 	or  vl.sited  China.    	They  discussed  the  possibility  of  China's  gaining  the  military
				 	equipment  or  the  production  knaw-how  of  the  West.    	These  exchanges  increased
				 	rapidly  toward  the  end  of  1977  after  Vice  P~emier  Deng  Xiaoping  regained  power,
				 	and  they  reached  their  peak  taward  the  end  of  1978.    	Sfnce  early  1979,  hawever,

			   	military  equipment  from  abroad  has  also  slowed  down  proportionatelp.    	This  is
			   	considered  to  be  the  result  of  an  overall  economic  reevaluation  of  the  moderniza-
			    	tion  plan  carried  out  in  late  1978  and  tfie  read~ustment  of  tfie  plaun  implemented
			    	thereafter.
			   	What  can  be  learned  for  sure  from  the  technical  delegations  going  in  and  out.  of
			   	China  is  the  fact  that  China  is  trying  to  limit  ifis  dependence  on  any  particular
			    	single  country.    	Hawever,   	the  fact  that  contacts  have  been  made  with  practically
			    	all  ma~or  advanced  nations  seems  to  in.dicate  that,  while  formulating  its  long-
			   	range  plan,  China  is  also  studying  thE  defense  philosophy  of  ~ther  na~ions.    	For
			    	example,   	in  a.ddition  to  the  industrial  and  technical  contacts,  China  has  received
	 	-		   	many  delegations  of  officers  from  Japan,  Easti  and  West  European  countrles,  Africa,
			    	and  the  Philippines,   	and  it  has  also  dispatched  its  own  delegations  of  officers
	 	-		   	to  these  countries.    	These  visits  appear  to  be  linked  to  an  overall.  plan  to  pro-
			    	m~te  its  anti-Soviet  policy  and  also  aimed  at  soJ.iciting  advice  on  weapons  and
			    	military  technology  and  further  promoting  discussions  concerning  military  philos-
			    	ophy  and  theories.
			    	What  can  be  learned  from  China's  inquiries  about  Western  technology  over  the  past
			    	3  years  is  that  China's  ultimate  goal  lies  in  est~bl~shing  an  industrial  founda-
			    	tion  capable  of  supporting  the  large-scale  development  and  manufacture  of  ordinary
	 	-		   	weapons  as  well  as  strategic  weapons  systems.    	In  i.ts  e~rly  stage,   	China's  inter--

			    	of  the  systems  that  went  with  them.    	Iiowever,   	it  appears  that  China's  leaders  have
	 	~		   	come  to  the  understanding  that  it  is  no  use  buying  techxbology  and  licenses  for
			    	the  production  of  this  equipment  before  the  foundation  of  tY~e  industry  is  firmly

			 	Negotiations  are  being  carried  out  for  tfie  purchase  .:f  a  refining  facility  for
			 	alu:ninum,   	copper,  nickel,  titanium,  tuugsten,  and  zinc.    	Aiming  at  a  goal  of
			 	doubling  its  iron  and  steel  production  to  50  million  tons  by  1985,  China  had
			 	originally  planned  to  build  three  new  large  iron  and  steel  production  facilitiee
			 	and  to  modernize  seven  existing  facilities.    	Tfie  plan  has  since  been  reviaed.
			 	Chemical  Products
			 	Much  attention  is  being  paid  to  acquiring  foreign  equipment  and  production  pro-
    	-		   	cesses  in  order  to  spur  the  developmenC  of  China's  chemical  industry.    	In  fact,
			 	the  chemical  industrq  has  occupied  a  large  portion  of  China's  plant  impQrt  plan
			 	since  1972.    	Those  production  technalogies  imported  from  the  West  include,   	for
    	_		   	example,  synthetic  fibers,   	rubber,   	equipment  for  processing  p].astics,  and  petro-				-
			 	chemical  plan~ts.    	These  and  other  polymer  techaologies  are  being  widely  utilized
    	-		   	in  the  development  and  production  of  advanced  weapons  today.
    	_		   	Machine  Tools
			 	China  has  cultivated  a  broad  machine  tool  industry  consisting  of  several  thousand
			 	plants  which  vary  greatly  in  size,   	from  a  towa  factory  to  one  having~several
			  	thousand  workers.    	The  nea3  for  domestic  low-  to  medfum--quality  machine  toola
			  	can  be  satisfactorily  met  by  these  plants,  and  some  high-quality  and  durable  wni-
			  	versal  machine  tools  are  exported.    	However,  China  still  lacks  the  capabilitq  to
			  	manufacture  those  precision  machi.ne  tools  which  are  essential  for  weapons  produc-
			  	tion.    	China  is  today  at  the  early  stage  of  developing  digitally  controlled  ma-			  	_
			  	chine  tools  or  computer-aided  manufacturing  processes.    	The  Chinese  have  attempted
			  	to  develop  their  own  system  to  meet  the  need  for  special  equipment  at  some  of  the
			  	military  production  facilities.    	However,  the  machines  produce.d  thus  far  have  been
			  	substandard  or  have  failed  to  operate.    	It  appears  that  Cbina  must  satisfy  its
			  	need  for  precision  machinery  and  equip~me~t  by  purchasing  them  directly  either  from
			  	Japan  or  from  the  West.
			  	ElecCronics  Industry
     	-		   	Starting  from  its  elementaay  foun.dation  in  1949,  China  has  succeeded  in  develop-
     	_		   	ing  a  powerful  electronics  industry  which  is  expanding  at  a  rapid  pace.    	Since
			  	the  electronics  industry  is  important  to  both  military  developmeat  and  civilian
			  	industrial  production,  resourcea  are  allotted  to  it  preferentia.llq.    	From  one-
			  	half  to  three-quarters  of  its  total  products  become  militarp  procure~ent  and  the
			  	remainder  goes  to  the  peaceful  industries.    	Its  production  volume  is.comparable
			  	to  that  of  a  portion  of  the  advanced  industrial  countries  of  Westera  Europe.
			  	Ho~wever,   	its~standard  is  still  considerably  below  the  world  level.    	In  spite  of
     	~		   	the  fact  that  there  was  rapid  progress  in  this  field  for  several  years,  China
			  	had  to  import  advanced  electron.ics  industrial  products  which  are  strategicsll.y
			  	important  in  order  to  be  able  to  mave  tfie  plan  related  to  military  and  industrial
			  	production  forward.    	All  ma~or  departments  of  the  electr~nics  industry  are  behind
			  	others  3.n  design  techniques,  and  the  lack  of  quality  control,   	together  with  the
			  	production  of  substandard  products,  poses  a  very  serious  problem.

			 	There  are  advanced  technical  activities,  built  on  the  foimdation  of  basic  tech-

			  	very  high  priority  for  3  years  after  the  "gang  of  four"  was  overthrown.    	China
			  	appeared  to  be  ready  to  consider  aa  azrangement  based  on  the  contract  entered
			  	iato  with  fore~gn  civilian  aircraft  or  space  system  manufacturers,   	so  that  it			     	_
			  	might  gain  access  to  and  utilize  the  closely  interconnected  military  and  civilian
			  	techaologies  which  are  pervasive  in  the  advanced  world.    	China's  interest  in
			  	aviatian  tectznology  extends  to  every  aspect  of  modern  aircraft  production.    	As  a
			  	mechanism  of  technical  transfer,   	export  of  an  entire  facility  for  the  production
     	:		   	of  civilian  aircraft  or  a~oint~venture  eaterprise  ha.s  been  considered.    	Ztems

			  	technique  necessary  for  the  production  of  the  outer  frame  of  ~et  engines  and  the
			  	licenses  for  the  production  of  aircraft  wings,  brakes,  bearings,  jet  engines,
     	_		   	and  turbine  blades.    	Furthermore,  negotiations  are  being  carried  out  for  the  pur-

			  	devices,   	3nd  accessory  t~ols.
			  	China  has  also  eapressed  a  desire  to  purchase  a  few  foreign  communications  satel-		    	_
			  	lite  systems  aad  geophysical  resource  satellite  receiving  stations,  and  thereby
			   	to  gain  a  valuable  foothold  in  the  space  industry  of  Japan,  America,  and  the  West

			   	system,  Chi.na  dispatched  several  hundreds  of  its  scientists  and  engineers  abroad.

		     	As  a  result  of  the  all-out  effort  to  build  up  tfie  military  industry,   	a  consider-			 	-
		     	able  amount  of  surplus  capacity  has  been  created.    	flowever,  the  weapons  thus  manu-
		     	factured  are  basicallp  all  outdated.    	In  order  to  utilize  this  industrial  capacity
		     	more  effectivelp,  China  has  adopted  a  new  policp  and  I~as  redistributed  a  consider-
		     	able  portion  of  military  production  capacity  to  nonmilitary  production  effort.
		     	According  to  this  new  "unified  policy,"  more  and  more  experts  are  be3ng  dispatched		     	_
				from  munitions  factories  to  local  nonmilitary  organizations  in  order  to  candition
				these  experts  to  the  marketing  of  nonmilitarp  products.    	As  a  result  of  this  new
				policy,  many  new  products,   	from  cameras  to  mining  machinery,   	are  being  manufactured
				by  military  factories.    	For  example,   	a  tank  factory  at  Xiangtan  has  begun  prAduc-
				tion  of  sewing  machines,   	electric  fans,  bulldozers,  and  cranes,  while  an  arsenal			 	~
				at  Wuxi  is  said  to  have  begun  production  of  instruments  used  in  ear  operations.
				China  has  revea].ed  that  80  percent  of  the  defense  industry  enterprise  in  Liaoning				=
				Province  is  utilizing  its  facilities  and  technical  forces  for  the  production  of
				daily  necessities  for  local  consumption  as  well  as  for  export.
				During  the  ree~camination  of  the  economy  carried  out  from  late  1978  ta  early  1979,
				a  criticism  about  the  lack  of  adequate  ~udgment  and  adjustment  on  matters  related
				to  the  importation  of  technolagy  and  equipment  surfaced.    	This,   	together  with  a
				reduction  in  the  number  of  miliLary  delegations  sent  abroad  and  the  number  of  con-
				struction  projects,   	plus  the  emphasis  placed  on  the  production  of  nonmilitalry
    	-		  	goods  by  military  factories,   	sgeaks  loudly  of  China's  relaxation  of  the  tempo  of
    	-		  	its  military  modernization  plan.    	The  hectic  activitie~  of  1976-78  have  subsided,
				and  China  is  naw  more  able  to  appraise  calmly  what  in  fact  it  can  do  or  can  ab-
				sorb  when  it  attempts  to  acquire  Western  military  technology.    	Nevertheless,   	its
				long-range  goal  remains  the  acquisition  of  the  basic  and  intermediate  technologies
				which  are  essential  for  China  to  become  a  militarily  pawerful  nation.
				According  to  an  editorial  which  appeared  in  one  of  the  Chinese  papers,   	the  effort
			 	for  railitary  modernization  has  been  relaxed,   	and  any  [new]  large-scale  effort  re-
			 	lated  to  military  modernization  is  not  expected  to  begin  at  least  until  after  the
			 	Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  is  launched  in  1981.    	Whether  this  arrangement  can  actually
			 	materialize,   	only  time  can  tell.    	The  Sino-Vietnamese  war  i.n  the  spring  of  1979
			 	sufficiently  revealed  the  shortcomings  of  the  PLA.    	Military  planuers  are  pain--
			 	fully  aware  of  the  real  threat  posed  by  the  Soviet  Union,  and  anq  further  delaq  in
    	-		  	the  modernization  of  the  military  means  a  dangerous  gdmble.    	They  are  also  aware
     	-		  	of  the  fact  that  their  economic  plan  has  not  yet  materialized.    	The  fact  tha.t  the
			 	economic  modernization  goal  was  reexamined  in  earlq  1979  also  makes  it  clear  once
			 	again  that  the  launching  of  a  comprehensive  milftary  modernization  project  in  1981
			 	is  not  necessarily  guaranteed.    	No  doubt  there  will  be  a  heated  debate  over  the
			 	allotment  of  valuable  investment  funds  because  of  these  key  factors.						 	-
