 COSVN Moves Out of the Way
 Important elements of the Communists' top
 command-COSVN-have been relocating to an
 area of Cambodia some 20-25 miles north of
 South Vietnam's Tay Ninh Province border. The
 assembly of several high-level staffs well away
 from the border represents an effort to regroup,
 at least temporarily, beyond the 21.7-mile limit
 set for US forces.
 Captured documents and defectors affirm
 that several enemy base camps have been overrun.
 One complex, less than five miles north of Tay
 Ninh Province, reportedly was evacuated by a
 1,000-man staff upon receipt of a seven-hour
 advance warning of a B-52 raid. The seizure of a
 large quantity of important documents by US
 soldiers strongly suggests another important base
 had been uncovered.
 In South Vietnam, the Communists sharply
 increased harassing attacks in the I and IV Corps
 regions during the week, but enemy ground forces
 continue to operate in small units. Captured
 documents                 indicate that the 25X1
 enemy plans to carry out similar waves of limited
 attacks throughout the summer.

 Communists Grab Much of Cambodia's Northeast
 The capital of Stung Treng Province fell
 before a sharp attack on 15 May as Viet Cong
 forces increased pressure on the remaining iso-
 lated government outposts in Stung Treng and
 Ratanakiri provinces. The Communists now ap-
 parently control the Se Kong - Mekong waterway
 all the way from the Laos border to the outskirts
 of Kompong Cham. Additional attacks against the
 remaining government positions in the northeast-
 ern provinces are almost a certainty, and it is
 probably only a matter of time before the govern-
 ment's presence there is eliminated completely.
 The Communists' current drive to secure control
 of these provinces is designed to ensure the main-
 tenance of already existing supply routes from
 Laos and to open up other routes farther inland.
 Government forces, with South Vietnamese
 support, regained control of Kompong Cham city
 on 17 May, but they have been unable to move
 east across the Mekong in the face of stiff enemy
 pressure. A South Vietnamese force swept into
 southern Cambodia on 17 May, relieved the
 beleagured Cambodian garrisons at Takeo, Kep,
 and Kompong Trach, and is moving west toward
 the harassed coastal city of Kampot. Communist
 control is now confined to a narrow belt of ter-
 ritory just north of these operations, but, as in
 other border areas, they will almost certainly re-
 assert their control if the South Vietnamese pull
 back.
 SECRET
 The Communists are moving ahead to or-
 ganize Sihanouk's apparatus in "liberated areas"
 of Cambodia. On  18 May Sihanouk's head-
 quarters in Peking released copies of two letters
 purportedly sent from the "liberated areas" by
 Sihanouk's ministers of defense, interior, and
 propaganda. The letters report the election of
 committees for the National United Front in the
 "liberated areas" and great "voluntary contribu-
 tions both in manpower and materials" by the
 people of the area for the overthrow of the Lon
 Nol government.

 5EURE1'
 Asian Nations Meet in Djakarta to Discuss Cambodia
 Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik's initia-
 tive on Cambodia, so clumsily and amateurishly
 surfaced a month ago, turned out reasonably well.
 The twelve participants in the 16-17 May Dja-
 karta conference put on a good show and pro-
 duced a statesmanlike communique.
 The conference is not likely to have a meas-
 urable effect on events in the Indochina area, but
 it was never expected to do so. Its chief merit,
 acknowledged from the beginning by all partici-
 pants, is that Asian nations for the first time have
 taken the initiative on an Asian problem and have
 followed through to the extent of discussing it
 among themselves and specifying future action.
 Its principal weakness, which prejudiced its
 accomplishments from the outset, was its largely
 pro-Western complexion; the three Communist
 nations and six of the nonaligned countries
 declined to participate. Of the twelve nations
 represented, only Indonesia and Singapore were
 nonaligned.
 The most significant point made in the
 communique was the recommendation for a
 broader international conference at a later date.
 To this end, the communique directed the for-
 eign ministers of Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia
 to begin "urgent consultations" toward convening
 a conference similar to that already suggested by
 the UN Secretary General and others. The three
 foreign ministers are to approach the participants
 of the 1954 Geneva conference and all other
 interested parties. Otherwise, the communique
 followed anticipated lines in calling for the
 immediate cessation of hostilities in Cambodia,
 the withdrawal of all foreign forces, respect for
 Cambodia's sovereignty and neutrality, and reac-
 tivation of the International Control Commission.
 As expected, Indonesia and Japan played
 key roles at the conference and were chiefly
 responsible for the content of the communique.
 Japan's contribution was additionally significant
 in that, for the first time since World War II,
 Tokyo engaged in a purely political regional con-
 ference in contrast with its previous activities in
 economic and developmental fields. Other major
 participants were Thailand and Australia. Both
 Australia and New Zealand were pleased at the
 extent of their acceptance at an Asian conference
 on an Asian problem.
 The good organization and general smooth-
 ness of conference procedure seemed to surprise
 both participants and observers, particularly con-
 sidering Malik's hasty, largely untested initiative
 last month and the resultant pique in a number of
 Asian capitals. Assistance from Japan and Aus-
 tralia as well as Indonesia's traditional capacity
 for extraordinary, eleventh-hour activity probably
 accounts for the good performance. Moreover,
 many of the governments involved are actively
 committed to supporting the present Indonesian
 Government and, once they had overcome their
 surprise and exasperation at Djakarta's tactics,
 made an extra effort to see that "Malik's confer-
 ence" turned out well.
 Malik, who had been censured domestically
 for having compromised the nation's nonaligned
 foreign  policy  in  nurturing  this largely pro-
 Western conference, seems to have emerged
 undamaged politically and perhaps with his posi-
 tion slightly enhanced. He has a key role in fol-
 low-up consultations aimed at developing a later
 and more broadly based conference and thus has
 provided Indonesia with the kind of symbolic
 area leadership that Djakarta wants.

 Peking Postpones Warsaw Meeting
 Peking's 'decision to cancel the Sino-US
 meeting in Warsaw this week represents a tempo-
 rary  postponement designed to underscore
 China's hard-line public posture against US ac-
 tions in Cambodia while keeping open this
 important channel of corrimunication with Wash-
 ington. Unlike China's last'statement of cancella-
 tion in February 1969, itg? announcement this
 week was relatively mild i, tone and clearly
 implied that a new date for \he next meeting
 would soon be arranged through the normal'
 diplomatic mechanisms in Warsaw\
 The Chinese obviously considbxed that to
 meet while US troops were engaged in ground
 operations in Cambodia would pro   embar-
 rassing and would tend to undercut the                   age of
 resolve and militance Peking has ado ted in
 response to developments in Indochina. par-
 ticular, the Chinese probably belief that igns
 they were "dealing with the enem t' on a b si-
 ness-as-usual basis would raise questions in Han i

 The Chinese over the past m. month have con-
 sistently emphasized their had-line position on
 Indochina in order to encoufage Hanoi to steer
 clear of a negotiated settlemfnt, persist in a "pro-
 tracted war," and drive they"S out of Southeast
 Asia. At the same time,   king has also seen a
 golden opportunity to cap talize on Moscow's re-
 cent equivocation over th f Cambodian issue. Last
 week, for example, the   inese gave a warm wel-
 come to Vietnamese p rty chief Le Duan, in-
 cluding a meeting with Chairman Mao and Vice
 Chairman Lin Piao. This is the first publicly re-
 ported meeting of a North Vietnamese leader
 with Mao since 1965. This Chinese demonstration
 of support is in sharp contrast with the Viet-
 namese leder's earlier rather lukewarm send-off
 from Mojcow and was obviously designed further
 to encgrage Hanoi's militancy at the expense of
 the Soviets. Following up on what Peking clearly
 beliq es to be its current advantage, a Chinese
 central committee message to the North Viet-
 namese on the occasion of Ho Chi Minh's birth-
 day again stressed the "protracted war" theme.
 Although relations with the Soviets and the
 North Vietnamese are almost certainly the con-
 trolling factor both in Peking's insistence on a
 hard line with regard to Indochina and in its
 decision to postpone the meeting in Warsaw, the
 Chinese are clearly concerned about develop-
 ments in Southeast Asia. Chinese attacks on
 President Nixon, for example, have been espe-
 cially bitter in the past several weeks, labeling him
 a "malicious war criminal" and a "cornered dog."
 This concern is still relatively limited, however.
 Had Peking expected a sudden, serious worsening
 of the situation in Indochina, it might well have
 wished to meet in Warsaw to convey a private
 expression of concern or warning.
 Indeed, despite their strong verbal blasts, the
 C   ese will probably be ready to resume the
 tal.k once US forces have withdrawn from Cam-
 bodia,      one thing, the Chinese statement
 clearly  ed the current postponement to the US

 definitely *ews the Warsaw sessions as an im-
 portant sour  of much-needed political leverage
 in its dispute th the USSR. The recent upsurge
 in Soviet polem vs against China, together with
 Moscow's continuN military build-up along the
 Sino-Soviet frontier  almost certainly provides
 sufficient incentive to`-dissuade Peking from any
 prolonged suspension of`-the Warsaw talks.       25X1

 Communists Keep Up Pressure in South, Hold Off in North Laos
 Communist forces during the past week con-
 tinued to threaten the provincial capital of Sara-
 vane and to exert pressure on government posi-
 tions along the eastern rim of the Bolovens Pla-
 teau. Unconfirmed reports of three North Viet-
 namese battalions on the outskirts of Saravane
 have caused most of the civilian population to
 leave the town, but so far the Communists have
 confined their military action to occasional
 rocket fire and brief skirmishes around govern-
 ment outposts. The garrison commander, believ-
 ing an enemy attempt to seize Saravane is immi-
 nent, has closed the town's airstrip to resupply
 and evacuation flights. The Communists clearly
 have the capacity to take Saravane by force but
 may continue to employ largely psychological
 tactics, as they did at Attopeu, to persuade gov-
 ernment forces to surrender the town.
 Page  8
 Enemy troops remain in control of Attopeu
 and the artillery site overlooking that provincial
 capital. This week they also seized an important
 guerrilla base about ten miles to the northwest
 and told supporters that they would soon attack
 the principal guerrilla base on the plateau.
 Communist motivations in maintaining a
 high level of military activity in this region remain
 unclear. They may be seeking to broaden their
 logistic routes to the south, but it is possible they
 may only be making a show of force in the
 panhandle to compensate for their difficulties in
 achieving all their objectives in northern Laos.
 Although a major push against the Meo
 stronghold at Long Tieng cannot be ruled out,
 time is running against the Communists. Enemy
 forces did succeed in seizing several government
 outposts north of Long Tieng this week, which
 put the base, once again, within range of 122-mm.
 rocket fire. But these actions appeared to be
 designed to retard government efforts to expand
 the Long Tieng perimeter rather than to gain
 ground from which to launch an attack.
 On balance, it appears that prospects for a
 Communist drive against General Vang Pao's
 headquarters before the end of the dry season are
 dimming. The evidence suggests that the two
 North Vietnamese divisions in the area are shift-
 ing to a defensive posture to avoid a repetition of
 last year, when, during the rainy season, Meo
 irregulars easily took the Plaine des Jarres from
 the Communists.
 If Vang Pao succeeds in clearing the area
 south of the Plaine, he can sit tight around Long
 Tieng and give his troops a much needed respite.
 This strategy might include an effort to recapture
 bases north of the Plaine and some harassment of
 the enemy's rear areas, but it would avoid a major

 wet season offensive. Such a course could con-
 ceivably return the fighting in the north to the
 pre-1969 ground rules, when the Plaine was more
 or less a Communist sanctuary and the Commu-
 nists refrained from driving toward Long Tieng
 and the Meo heartland.
 This course runs the risk of allowing the
 Communists to maintain forward positions on the
 Plaine from which they could mount a fresh of-
 fensive toward Long Tieng in the fall. An offen-
 sive to push the Communists from the Plaine once
 again or to interdict Route 7 might set back
 Communist plans, but it would probably be more
 costly than last year's effort.
 Either way, it seems doubtful that the Meo25X1
 guerrillas can extricate themselves from the war
 of attrition in which they have been locked with
 the Communists for the past decade.

 Peking's Party Building Efforts Drag On
 The Chinese Communists' campaign to re-
 build their shattered party apparatus is still mov-
 ing at a snail's pace even though a full year has
 elapsed since the ninth party congress. Current
 discussions in domestic propaganda indicate that
 the principal obstacles to reconstruction are quar-
 rels over staffing new party committees and re-
 sistance to the party's resuming its previous lead-
 ing role in local administrations. There are also
 signs that these problems are being compounded
 by intensified factional infighting between various
 former Red Guard groups that are vying for domi-
 nant positions in the new party organs.
 over revolutionary  committees-the  governing
 bodies that were formed at nearly all levels of
 administration during the Cultural Revolution.
 Theoretically, this transfer of power should pro-
 ceed smoothly because the new party organs are
 required to draw the majority of their member-
 ship from the revolutionary committees. An in-
 creasing number of radiobroadcasts devoted to
 party leadership problems, however, have been
 complaining that elements who are on existing
 revolutionary committees and who have been
 denied membership in the party are unwilling to
 submit to its leadership in local affairs.
 Despite Peking's evident desire to speed up
 the tempo of reconstruction, the majority of the
 new party committees formed since the first of
 the year have appeared only at the lowest levels
 of administration, i.e., in communes, factories,
 and production brigades. To date, less than one
 third of the provinces have claimed that one or
 more reconstructed party committees have been
 formed as high as the county level. Not one has
 been announced at the special district or provin-
 cial levels, and only a single small city in southern
 China has announced that it has formed a munici-
 pal party organ.
 For many months after the party congress,
 party rebuilding was seriously hampered by insuf-
 ficient guidance from Peking, but this is no longer
 the case. Since last December, Peking has issued
 several authoritative statements detailing the man-
 ner in which the new party organs are to func-
 tion. Nevertheless, the regime's moves in recent
 weeks to reaffirm these guidelines attest to con-
 siderable opposition to them in many localities.
 Peking has stressed repeatedly, for example,
 that party committees must exercise leadership
 Disgruntled former Red Guard activists have
 been particularly virulent in their opposition to
 party leadership. Moreover, their discontents ap-
 pear to have been heightened by Peking's recent
 injunctions that Cultural Revolution activists do
 not automatically qualify for party membership
 and that all former Red Guard factions in a given
 area will not necessarily be awarded equal repre-
 sentation on new party committees. Thus, in
 many areas, competing factions appear to be en-
 gaged in a scramble for the relatively small num-
 ber of party posts open to them.

 Moscow to Keep Presence in Phnom Penh
 The Soviets have apparently decided not to
 break diplomatic relations with Lon Nol's overn-
 ment in Cambodia.
 The decision means in e ect tat
 Moscow's determination to retain its freedom of
 maneuver in Indochina has taken precedence over
 other considerations.
 The Soviet decision suggests that Moscow is
 uncertain about Sihanouk's prospects, and more
 importantly, wary of his dependence on the Chi-
 nese. In the present situation, the Soviets clearly
 believe it unwise to make a premature commit-
 ment that would limit their options. If Sihanouk
 should leave Peking, Moscow is free to review and
 modify its position.
 Moscow's present posture, however, leaves it
 vulnerable to Chinese charges that the USSR fol-
 lows a policy of only "sham support" for the
 Communists in Indochina, and at the same time
 places further strain on its relations with Hanoi.
 The  Soviets have already anticipated
 Peking's charge, however, and in private con-
 versations with diplomats and in propaganda they
 are claiming that China is obstructing united
 Communist action in Indochina. In the Pravda
 article of 18 May (which was Moscow's response
 to Peking's Lenin anniversary polemic), Moscow
 implicitly accused the Chinese of being re-
 sponsible for US actions in Cambodia, a charge
 that had already been made explicit in less
 authoritative propaganda.
 The Russians no doubt are trying to per-
 suade Hanoi that, in the end, its best interests
 might be served better if Moscow preserves for
 the present a degree of flexibility on the question
 of the future shape of the Cambodian govern-
 ment. The North Vietnamese, however, are dis-
 pleased at this current Soviet posture. Le Duan's
 failure during his recent stay in the USSR to line
 up full backing for North Vietnam's current
 policies clearly disappointed Hanoi's leaders and
 gave Peking a new issue to exploit against Mos-
 cow. Pham Van Dong made clear in a speech on
 19 May that North Vietnam's sympathies at the
 moment lie more with Peking than with Moscow.
 Heretofore, the North Vietnamese had always
 been careful to balance the praise given their two
 giant allies, but this speech was clearly more
 effusive toward the Chinese than the Soviets. The
 Soviets have apparently calculated, however, that
 so long as they provide strong-if not uncondi-
 tional-political backing and  the necessary
 economic and military aid, they will not jeop-
 ardize their over-all position in Hanoi

 Agricultural Prospects Dim in Eastern Europe
 For the third consecutive year the outlook is
 unfavorable for significant growth in Eastern
 Europe's agricultural production. Grain prospects
 are currently not as good as a year ago and the
 output of livestock products, especially meat,
 shows no sign of improvement. As a result, there
 will be little change this year in consumer avail-
 abilities of quality foods or in foreign exchange
 earnings from agricultural exports.
 Adverse weather through the end of last
 month makes production prospects for the im-
 portant winter grains-wheat, rye, and barley-less
 favorable than a year ago. Drought last fall was
 followed by a long, severe winter and by excessive
 moisture this spring. These conditions reduced
 the area seeded to winter grain and caused above-
 normal damage to these plantings in many coun-
 tries. Spring planting also was set back by as
 much as four to six weeks. Shortages of seed
 potatoes may also reduce acreages of this im-
 portant crop in the northern countries. More
 favorable growing conditions in the coming weeks
 could improve crop prospects, but attainment of
 above-average yields is unlikely.
 Growth in livestock production will be lim-
 ited by the smaller number of productive live-
 stock available at the beginning of 1970 and by
 fodder shortages. Output and procurement of
 livestock products such as pork, eggs, and butter,
 which fell in 1969, are not expected to improve
 before the last quarter of 1970, if then. The
 northern countries have programed increased im-
 ports of feedgrains and high-protein supplements
 during the year ending 1 July 1970 to prevent a
 significant drop in livestock herds and meat pro-
 duction. Grain imports may exceed last year's
 5.8-million tons by a half million tons. Some 40
 percent of total grain imports may come from the
 free world.
 Increased outlays for such purchases as well
 as reduced earnings from exports of food prod-
 ucts are likely to occur this year. Czechoslovakia
 and East Germany will have to increase hard
 currency expenditures for meat, potatoes, and
 animal feed. Hungary and Poland anticipate
 smaller net gains in foreign exchange earnings
 from Western trade in agricultural products.
 The population and money incomes will
 continue to increase faster than retail supplies of
 the quality foods most in demand. Thus, un-
 satisfied consumer demand for such foods, par-
 ticularly animal products, can be expected
 throughout 1970.

 Soviets Seeking Warsaw Pact Support Against China
 Moscow appears to be making a determined
 effort to involve the Warsaw Pact states more
 directly in support of its interests outside the
 European continent-particularly in the running
 dispute with China. The Soviet leaders seem
 increasingly disturbed by what they consider a
 provincial attitude on the part of some of their
 allies and a reluctance to get involved outside of
 Europe. Moscow is now talking of remedying this
 situation, to the apparent distress of Bucharest,
 and perhaps others.
 The USSR is placing much stress on the,
 reciprocal nature of bilateral treaty obligations
 between Moscow and the Warsaw Pact states. This
 was most recently manifested in the Soviet-
 Czechoslovak friendship treaty of 6 May, which--
 like treaties signed with Bulgaria and Hungary in
 1967-omitted the limitation of mutual defense;
 obligations to Europe. Thus, these three states at
 least now would appear formally bound to fight
 with the Soviets in an Asian war.
 Moreover, there have been recurrent rumors
 that the Soviets have already succeeded in
 maneuvering some of their allies into establishing
 a token military presence in Soviet Asia. At the
 turn of the year, there were several reports that
 some Polish Air Force units had been transferred
 to Soviet Central Asia.                             w o e
 me Czechoslovak Army units were
 None of these reports has been confirmed,
 and there would be little military advantage to
 the Soviets in establishing an East European
 presence there. However, the Soviet leaders might
 see considerable political advantage in this kind of
 tactic as a device to bring reluctant East Euro-
 peans more solidly into line in the dispute with
 China.
 There have also been indications that the
 Soviets would like to reorient the Warsaw Pact to
 take account of Soviet interests in Asia. They
 have begun in recent weeks to speak more and
 more frequently of an alleged Pact responsibility
 to defend the cause of peace and socialism "any-
 where"-in blatant contradiction to the published
 text of the Warsaw treaty itself.
 The Romanians have been the main obstacle
 to these ambitions. Bucharest made its opposition
 to any effort to reorient the bases of the Warsaw
 alliance dramatically clear in an editorial article in
 the party daily Scinteia last week. Presumably in
 reaction to recent Soviet tactics, the article
 pointedly stressed that the Pact's area of responsi-
 bility applies "only" to Europe, and that in giving
 orders, national command structures cannot be
 bypassed.
 Differences on these points may have been
 one of the factors that led to the sudden visit of
 Romanian leaders to Moscow for talks on 18-19
 May. Although these talks undoubtedly reflected
 the determination of the Soviet leaders to force
 Bucharest into line on these and other issues,
 there is still no indication that the Romanians are
 of a mind to make significant concessions. These
 differences may also affect the course of a meet-
 ing of Pact defense ministers in Sofia this
 week.                                    25X1

 lines account for 38 of the options. These 16
 airlines presently carry 70 percent of the passen-
 gers on the world's scheduled airline routes. In
 late 1969, pilots from Air France, BOAC, Pan
 American, and TWA went to Toulouse to test fly
 the Concorde. They reported that the aircraft was
 easy to fly, did not impose an excessive workload
 on the pilot, and should present no problems in
 training airline pilots and engineers in the han-
 ing of the aircraft.

 The nonpartisan cabinet named by President

 ing Finland with a government during the Presi-
 dent's forthcoming trip to Moscow as well as
 during  the  approaching parliamentary  recess.
 Negotiations for a new political government are
 expected to resume in the fall.
 Kekkonen took this step after attempts to
 form a majority government reflecting the sharp
 swing to the right in the parliamentary elections
 of 15-16 March were repeatedly stymied.
 The cabinet is expected to play essentially a
 "caretaker role," concerning itself with everyday
 duties and preliminary work on the next budget.
 There will be no vote of confidence, and the
 government will exist with the "toleration" of
 rather than the active support of parliament.

 Israeli Military Ripostes Batter Arabs
 Action Along the Canal
 A high level of ground, air, and sea action
 took place this week between Egyptian and Israeli
 forces.
 Egypt used one of its Soviet-built guided
 missile patrol boats for the first time since
 October 1967 and sank a large Israeli fishing
 vessel off the northern coast of the Sinai Penin-
 sula on 14 May. The following day an underwater
 explosive charge detonated in Eilat harbor killed
 one Israeli diver and injured several others; it is
 not clear who set the charge.
 Cairo paid the price for sinking the Israeli
 fishing boat and for its continued harassment of
 Israeli troops along the Suez Canal during the
 next few days. On 15 and 16 May four Egyptian
 MIG-17s and one MIG-21 were downed by the
 Israelis, bringing the total of Egyptian fighters
 lost to the Israelis since the June 1967 war to
 some 97.
 Also on 16 May, Israeli aircraft struck far to
 the south of the Suez Canal and attacked an
 Egyptian naval base along the Red Sea Coast. An
 Egyptian destroyer and a guided missile patrol
 boat were sunk in the attack, according to press
 reports from Tel Aviv
 `Itie E

 continued occupati
 outweighs any

 st militarily Israel's
 of Arab
 losses Cairo's armed forces suffer as a result. As a
 demonstration. of this, Egypt carried out an abor-
 tive    inando raid across-the Suez Canal on 19
 Jam.,-.suffering considerable casualties.
 Nasir continues to exhibit a willingness to
 resolve the Middle East impasse through political
 channels. Nevertheless, he probably believes what
 he has often said publicly: that only when his
 military forces are strong enough to challenge the
 Israelis can evacuation of the occupied territories
 be realized. The recent reinforcement of his de-
 fenses by Soviet units will stiffen his resolve to
 wait until this goal can be achieved.
 Underlying Tel Aviv's concern with Nasir's
 new aggressiveness-a result of the new Soviet-
 assisted air defense system in Egypt--is the fear
 that the Egyptians and Soviets are considering
 actions designed to limit Israeli military actions
 still further. The key question agitating the Israeli
 Government this week is whether the Soviet air
 defense system is about to be extended to the
 Canal. There is no evidence of such a move, but
 Israeli spokesmen have indicated that it is just a
 question of time. They claim that the Soviets
 have already attempted to do so but have been
 forestalled by heavy Israeli bombings.
 The Israeli Government has made it clear in
 notes to the Big Powers that it has chosen to fight
 to maintain air control over the Canal, i.e., that it
 has no plan to pull back under Egyptian and
 Soviet pressure. Implicit in such a decision is a
 willingness to accept the increased risk of direct
 confrontation between Israeli and Soviet pilots.
 Israeli leaders have so far operated with great
 caution as far as the Soviets in Egypt are con-
 cerned. Tel Aviv had hoped the unwritten modus

 vivendi-that Israel would forgo deep penetration
 raids in exchange for Soviet forbearance in the
 Canal area-would hold. A loss of its air superi-
 ority over the Canal-the prime guarantee of halt-
 ing any serious Egyptian military thrust into the
 lightly held Sinai-would raise for Tel Aviv the
 whole question of peace and war, and, in the
 Israeli psychology, the question of Israel's ulti-
 mate existence. The Israelis want at all costs to
 avoid a situation in which Nasir becomes so
 emboldened by direct Soviet support that he
 deludes himself again into thinking he can win a
 war with Israel. If Israel's existence comes under
 serious question, Israeli leaders will think of pre-
 ventive action against Nasir.
 Th  Israeli Government at ,,phis point is
 puzzled-  d troubled-by wh   it chooses to
 view as falt  g US suppo  of Israel. Foreign
 Minister Eban is i   ashi  on this week to try to
 obtain a US commit   t for continuing sales of
 aircraft to Israel     to    ain some indications
 of US diplom  c support   Israel against the
 developing .. ation in Egypt an  long the Suez
 Canal. S  ar, the Israeli Governor  t has talked
 in mil' ry terms and has given no indication of
 any isposition for political compromise. The few
 v ces in Israel that advocate compromise as the
 way to obtain peace have been drowned in the
 pub l  ~'"over the new situation posed by
 Sovie  ns ingypt.
 Israel's Lebanon Incursion: Aftermath
 Israel's armored thrust into Lebanon last
 week has heightened Arab fears of Israeli attacks
 against their eastern front forces.
 The Lebanon Government pitched itself into
 a new crisis last week less than 24 hours after the
 withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Mount
 Hermon area. Almost before the Israelis had left
 the area, large numbers of fedayeen had entered
 Lebanon from Syria. Stirred by misleading
 Lebanese Army accounts, President Hilu and
 most of the cabinet charged that Syrian Army
 regulars had entered the country without Beirut's
 permission. Interior Minister Jumblatt and feda-
 yeen officials in Amman, however, refuted the
 charge and maintained that the fedayeen were
 merely rotational replacements. Seeking to avoid
 a diplomatic clash with Syria over the alleged
 incursion, Prime Minister Karami led a delegation
 of civilian and military officials to Damascus last
 weekend, where they apparently were satisfied
 with Syria's explanations. By the beginning of
 this week Lebanon had quietly dropped its
 charges of a Syrian invasion, and the affair
 appears to have been resolved.

 Iran Faces Slower Economic Growth
 The recent agreement with the Western oil con-
 sortium will give Iran an 11-percent increase in oil
 revenues this year. These payments will ease Tehran's
 expected, balance of payments difficulties and will
 slow the cline in the growth of the economy.
 Ss
 High goviment expenditures, caused largely
 by heavy public  vestment under Iran's ambitious
 development progr  , have kept foreign exchange
 reserves under pressu since 1967. Annual imports
 since the Iranian year    inning March 1966 have
 risen by 21 percent, while reign exchange earnings
 from nonoil exports and oil  venues have increased
 only about 18 percent per yea  To finance the estiy
 mated $366-million gap for the  ear ending Ma
 1970, Iran has been borrowing inc  singly on  - ort
 term at high interest rates. As a r   lt, its ftinual
 external debt repayment burden incr sed 00ramat-
 ically during the past year, totaling an      ted $254
 million, or 18 percent of total foreign ex~ ge earn-
 ings.
 Military needs are competi increasingly
 development programs for fo ign exchange. La
 year the government decided   raise current expendi-
 tures by some $1.5 billii during the remainder of
 the Fourth Plan period,-(1968-73). Over half is to be
 for military purpose$ reflecting the Shah's concern
 with Iran's militafposture following the scheduled
 British withdraw' from the Persian Gulf in 1971.
 Largel G because of balance of payments con-
 straints, government investment, which grew 14.2
 percen  in the year ending March 1969, increased
 only  .7 percent last year and is not expected to
 ex   nd by more than 5.5 percent for the year ending
 t March. As the rate of investment slowed, the
 r*growth rate of real gross national product (GNP)
 declined from a high of 12 percent in 1968 to 9
 percent last year. It is expected to be about 8 percent
 this year.
 The government-consortium agreement will in-
 crease Iran's oil revenues by more than $100 million
 over last year, allowing increased imports of develop-
 ment goods. The government hopes that by next year
 it will have adequate funds to increase investment to
 planned levels, thus meeting the targeted 9.4-percent
 average annual increases in real GNP during the
 Fourth Plan period.

 Moderates Have Edge in Ceylon's Parliamentary Elections
 Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake's United Na-
 tional Party (UNP) holds a slight lead in the campaign
 for crucial parliamentary elections on 27 May, but
 the outcome could depend on minor shifts in up to
 50 closely contested seats out of a total of 151.
 Although the campaign has been free of violence, the
 opposition might yet decide to play on latent com-
 munal antagonisms between the majority Sinhalese
 and the minority Tamils in a last-ditch effort to
 achieve victory.
 The only significant opposition to the UNP is
 the United Front, a leftist coalition headed by Mrs.
 Bandaranaike, a former prime minister. The coalition
 is composed of her nationalist Sri Lanka Freedom
 Party, the Ceylon Communist Party/Moscow, and the
 Lanka Sama Samaja Party, a Trotskyite group. The
 front's election manifesto calls for the nationalization
 of remaining private banks and increased state control
 over both imports and the wholesale distribution of
 all "essential" commodities. It also promises the es-
 tablishment of "people's committees" at various
 levels of government to supervise the bureaucracy. In
 foreign affairs it endorses recognition of some Com-
 munist countries.
 The UNP has vigorously criticized the totali-
 tarian aspects of this manifesto and has pledged con-
 tinued communal harmony and economic growth.
 Ceylon's economic outlook is mixed, however, and
 the opposition may reap advantage from rising living
 costs and urban unemployment. The United Front
 scored an initial psychological victory when one of its
 candidates was declared an uncontested winner fol-
 lowing the disqualification of a progovernment in-
 dependent. An apparent opposition ploy to discredit
 the UNP, however, by alleging that the armed forces
 were preparing to seize power if the UNP loses seems
 to have been largely ineffective. The UNP has also
 won pledges of support from the Ceylon Workers'
 Congress, the country's largest union and one that
 controls a crucial swing vote of up to 20 seats.
 The UNP and its allies will clash head on with
 United Front candidates in only 47 constituencies. A
 Sinhalese nationalist party is fielding 5 1 candidates
 and may unintentionally aid the UNP by drawing
 strength away from the coalition. The presence of
 over 80 independents clouds the prospects for both
 sides. At present the UNP appears to have over 65
 solid seats and is leading in about a dozen other
 constituencies, while the United Front probably can
 count on slightly over 40 seats. If the UNP and its
 allies cannot muster a majority, the Tamil-based
 Federal Party could become the decisive factor; al-
 though this party left the UNP-led government in
 1968, it would probably support the UNP rather than
 Mrs. Bandaranaike, whose party has a history of anti-
 Tamil bias. ~

 defused to permit PDC members of parliament to
 strike a deal with conservative groups that would
 have set up a PDC-Radical leadership in the
 Chamber of Deputies. As a result, a new leader-
 ship consisting of a leftist Radical, a Communist,
 and atl.Socialist was elected. He may believe that
 hex thus could count on leftist votes in a contest
 .with Alessandri.
 Another new factor in, the campaign has
 been provided by a recent public statement by
 the army commander, General Schneider, that the
 armed forces would support the right of Congress
 to choose the candidate with the second highest
 popular vote. This statement has been attacked as

 The government may be facing a showdown
 with Ecuador's most powerful economic groups
 over the emergency taxes imposed last week to
 help cover its budget deficit.
 Business organizations from both the com-
 mercial center of Guayaquil and the capital of
 Quito are attempting to have the new revenue-
 producing measures struck down by the courts as
 unconstitutional. Businessmen have threatened a
 general commercial strike to enforce their de-
 mands, a threat that is not to be taken lightly
 because such strikes have helped to bring down
 two governments within the past ten years.
 President Velasco is reacting vigorously with
 name calling, a publicity campaign stressing the
 need to "soak the oligarchy," and threats to
 resign if he is defeated on the fiscal issue. There
 are no indications that the government is pre-
 pared to back off on even part of the fiscal
 measures.
 An extra session of Congress to upset the
 new tax decrees has been called for by economic
 interests and by opposition political parties. It
 appears unlikely that Congress will convene,
 however, as elections for deputies are due next
 month and the lower house does not want re-
 sponsibility for the problem.
 The armed forces, whose recent pay in-
 creases would be funded by revenue generated
 from the new taxes, are squarely behind President
 Velasco. If unrest develops, or if Velasco is faced
 with an unfavorable ruling from the Supreme
 Court, his principal military and civilian advisers
 will increase their pressure on the President to
 assume new powers, probably extraconstitutional.
 Despite the strong reaction to the taxes, a
 compromise is possible. Opposition groups nei-
 ther want to push Velasco into a dictatorship nor
 to see him replaced, because they see no alterna-
 tive candidate who is more attractive

 Dominican Elections Strengthen President's Control
 President Balaguer's sweeping re-election
 victory on 16 May, buttressed by overwhelming
 congressional and municipal majorities, puts him
 in a commanding position. Although the admin-
 istration will continue to be plagued by signifi-
 cant public order problems, Balaguer is unlikely
 to face a serious political challenge in the near
 future.
 Balaguer's 56-percent majority in the five-
 man race was a rude disappointment for his
 opponents. The two leading opposition candi-
 dates have predictably charged the government
 with fraud and have threatened retaliation, but
 they lack both the political and military muscle
 to carry through with their threats at this time.
 Moreover, the OAS observers publicly gave the
 elections their stamp of approval.
 Still-unofficial returns indicate that Bala-
 guer's supporters also won control of 26 of the 27
 Senate seats and 60 of the 74 seats in the Cham-
 ber of Deputies, and captured 75 of 77 mayor-
 alties. This showing increases the already formi-
 dable majorities at all levels. Only Balaguer's
 Reformist Party had the organization and re-
 sources necessary for an effective campaign.
 The total vote, less than 1.2 million, does
 not match the 1966 total of 1.34 million and falls
 substantially below the 1.8 million eligible voters.
 Juan Bosch's Dominican Revolutionary Party
 (PRD), which abstained, will cite these figures as
 proof of its continued strength. The low voter
 turnout, however, can be partially explained by a
 lack of voter interest. The PRD's vote getting
 potential is also called into question by the fact
 that, despite its support of the popular incumbent
 mayor of the capital, he lost to the President's
 candidate.
 President Balaguer
 The PRD nonethe-
 less remains the major
 opposition, if only by
 default, on the basis of
 the poor performances
 of the other parties. The
 party will continue to at-
 tract significant popular
 support in the cities as
 long as it has the mag-
 netic Bosch at the helm,
 but it is no match for
 the President's combined
 political and military
 strength. Balaguer, as he
 has done in the past, will probably bring some
 opposition figures into the government, and this
 action may further isolate the PRD.
 Balaguer, having stepped down temporarily
 from the presidency, will probably reassume
 office within a few days. His formal inauguration
 is scheduled for 16 August. The administration
 will face a significant public order problem in
 June, when the OAS is scheduled to meet in
 Santo Domingo. Bosch has already begun attack-
 ing the meeting and may urge demonstrations in
 an attempt to embarrass the government. Bala-
 guer, however, has been able to use massive mili-
 tary patrolling to shut off serious disorders in the
 past, and the government will make extensive
 security preparations in advance of the con-
 clave.

 Castro Blasts US, Admits Sugar Harvest Defeat
 Fidel Castro took a particularly aggressive
 stance toward the US in a speech delivered early
 on 20 May celebrating the return of the fishermen

 from the Soviet Union and may also represent an
 implied threat to Guatemala and Nicaragua,
 which he charged with supplying "bases for ag-
 gression."
 major portion of Castro's address was
 devote  o lambasting the US. He stressed the
 theme tha  the "principal party responsible for
 these deeds' was the US Governme  .-'.fle also
 reprimanded th British for allo,    the Bahama
 islands to be us   as sa~nttiies by the exile
 groups. Castro said    "ritish should demand

 he had   en in order to secure t  return of the
 fishe  en, but he constantly returne o his basic
 theme that the exile attacks were being planned,
 supported, and launched by the US.
 Castro has overreacted to this recent flurry
 of exile activity-beginning with the Alpha 66
 landing on 17 April. The kidnaping incident has
 brought forth his most vociferous protest. Castro
 is probably genuinely concerned about the vul-
 nerability of his extensive fishing fleet to more
 than just harassing attacks by exile groups.
 He also probably wants it made quite clear
 that his government will not be blackmailed into
 making deals and hopes this will put an end to
 such tactics. If they continue, he varned, Cuba
 will "seek every means to pass from the defensive
 to the offensive." Castro also complained that his
 air searches were cut short by the "very limited
 range" of his MIG-21s and lamented that "un-
 fortunately our country does not have long-range
 aircraft." These statements may be a prelude to a
 possible announcement of new military assistance

 Castro used the celebrations to deliver some
 bad news about the sugar harvest. He announced
 that "we will not reach the ten million (tons)."
 He admitted that this was a bitter defeat because
 the honor of the revolution had been at stake, but
 he added that "true revolutionaries" learn from
 failures as well as from victories. Castro praised
 the Cuban people for doing as well as they al-
 ready have in achieving a record harvest. There
 was no attempt to blame the US or anyone else
 for Cuba's failure to meet the ten-million-ton
 goal. He said that "our goal was too high" and
 urged the Cubans to an even greater effort in the
 remaining days of the harvest. In another speech
 made less than 24 hours later, Castro dwelt exten-
 sively on the reasons for the failure to reach his
 original sugar harvest goal. He did not resume the
 strong anti-US line emphasized in his earlier
 speech. According to preliminary reports, Castro
 indicated that a new goal of nine million tons
 could be achieved.

 POLICIES OF THE NEW SPANISH CABINET
 When General Franco announced sweeping changes in his cabinet last
 October the move aroused much interest because it is likely that this
 government will take Spain into the post-Franco era. Cabinet reshuffling in
 Madrid has been infrequent-the last major change took place in July 1965.
 In making his choices this time, Franco abandoned his usual policy of
 keeping a balanced representation of all the major groups that support him
 and gave the largest number of portfolios to businessmen and technical
 experts who are either members of or associated with members of the
 influential Catholic lay organization Opus Dei. These men, called "tech-
 nocrats" because of their economic orientation, believe that the political
 evolution of Spain requires stronger socioeconomic foundations. In keeping
 with this belief, they propose to give priority to the economic modernization
 of the country. Political liberalization, in their view, can wait.
 Shortly after formation of the cabinet, a leading member announced
 that the government had no intention of giving impetus to the very cautious
 political evolution that has been taking place in Spain in recent years and
 that it would instead place emphasis on changes in foreign policy, especially
 in improving ties with Europe. Ironically, this important goal is unlikely to
 be achieved until political liberalization takes place.

 The outstanding man in the new cabinet is
 one of only six survivors of the old one, Laureano
 Lopez Rodo, Economic Planning Minister. He has
 emerged as chief policy maker and has the sup-
 port of Vice Premier Carrero Blanco, the principal
 Minister of Economic
 Planning
 Lopez Rodo
 government figure after
 Franco. Lopez Rodo's
 training, his wide govern-
 ment and academic ex-
 perience, his economic
 and political expertise,
 and his membership in
 Opus Dei all serve to en-
 hance his position and to
 make him the leader of a
 team that includes sev-
 eral of his former sub-
 ordinates in economic
 planning as well as sev-
 eral colleagues in Opus
 Dei.
 INITIAL POLICY STATEMENT
 After its first meeting on 31 October, Vice
 Premier Carrero Blanco issued a policy statement
 on behalf of the new government. In the domestic
 field the statement emphasized general goals such
 as better social welfare programs, education re-
 forms, equitable distribution of wealth and the
 strengthening of local government. There was also
 a pious statement of the cabinet's intention to
 give full information on its actions in order to
 receive the benefit of public reaction.
 In international affairs, the statement noted
 that Spain belonged to the Western world and
 would formulate its foreign policy accordingly. It
 further stated that negotiations with the Common
 Market would be stressed and friendship with
 Portugal reaffirmed. It added that the government
 Special Report
 would strengthen relations with Latin America
 and with the United States. This was followed in
 mid-November by an interview given by Lopez
 Rodo in which he stated that the new government
 would emphasize changes in foreign policy rather
 than internal politics. This remark confirmed the
 general intention of the new government with
 regard to closer ties with the Common Market
 and relations with the United States.
 ROLE OF FOREIGN MINISTER
 LOPEZ BRAVO
 The chief spokesman of the new cabinet on
 foreign affairs is the new foreign minister,
 Gregorio Lopez Bravo, who also is one of the six
 holdovers from the previous cabinet, in which he
 was minister of industry. A go-getter with an
 attractive personality, he immediately started a
 flurry of diplomatic activity. In a newspaper in-
 terview in December, after little more than a
 month in office, he explained his approach to his
 job. After noting that, because of social, histori-
 cal, and political factors, there were many "con-
 stants" in Spanish foreign policy, he declared that
 the main changes that a foreign minister could
 make were in priorities and methods of operation.
 As part of his activist approach, Lopez Bravo
 is using personal visits to foreign countries to
 make Spain's views better known. Since his ap-
 pointment last October he has made eight trips
 abroad (see map). He also received German For-
 eign Minister Scheel in Madrid on 22-23 April.
 Lopez Bravo is also interested in having
 Spain play the role of a power with global inter-
 ests. He has stated, "Spain must not only have a
 foreign policy, it must participate in international
 politics." By interjecting himself into interna-
 tional matters, he hopes to promote both himself
 and Spain.

 In addition to making more use of travel
 than did his predecessor, Lopez Bravo has em-
 ployed a more tactful approach to foreign policy
 problems. For example, in the dispute with the
 Foreign Minister
 Lopez Bravo
 United Kingdom over
 Gibraltar-a perennial
 point of friction-Lopez
 Bravo has played down
 differences and concen-
 trated on aspects on
 which some progress
 might be made. In at-
 tempting to reduce ten-
 sion with the UK over
 Gibraltar, Madrid agreed
 last November to sus-
 pend further discussion
 of the problem in the
 United Nations. The
 Spanish press moderated
 its coverage of the subject and adopted a friend-
 lier tone toward the UK. There was no implica-
 tion that Spain would give up its claim to Gibral-
 tar, but Lopez Bravo stated in an interview that
 the Rock would no longer be the magnetic pole
 of Spanish foreign policy. Lopez Bravo and the
 British ambassador in Madrid have had informal
 exchanges this month concerning the sort of co-
 operation that might eventually take place be-
 tween Spain and Gibraltar once present border
 restrictions are removed. The problem remains,
 but it has been reduced somewhat as an obstacle
 to other Spanish goals.
 The new cabinet's real push to identify
 Spain with Europe is concentrated on efforts to
 reach an agreement with the European Com-
 munities (EC). Although Spain wants full mem-
 bership or association with the EC, political
 opposition to the Franco regime within some of
 the six countries has made that impossible. The
 Special Report
 new cabinet has continued earlier negotiations for
 a two-stage preferential trade agreement, and
 terms were concluded in March. Final approval by
 the EC is expected in June. During the first stage,
 to last six years, Spain will reduce tariffs by an
 average of 25 percent on most of the manu-
 factured goods that it imports from the EC (by
 60-70 percent on some items), and the EC will
 reduce tariffs by about 60 percent on most im-
 ports of Spanish manufactured goods. Both Spain
 and the EC will also reduce trade barriers on
 selected agricultural products. The character of
 the second stage was left undefined, but Spain
 hopes that it will lead to eventual association.
 In pursuit of these closer ties, Lopez Bravo
 has met with the foreign ministers of all six EC
 countries. For instance, his trip to Paris in Feb-
 ruary promoted closer relations with France,
 which in turn could help Spain in its plans to play
 a larger role in international affairs. ; The two
 foreign ministers in their talks stressed their
 similarity of views on international questions.
 France agreed to sponsor Spain's return to full
 participation in European affairs, including sup-
 port of Madrid's effort to establish a relationship
 with the EC. Lopez Bravo emphasized to the
 French that, in developing closer ties with Paris,
 Spain did not wish to detract from cordial
 relations with its other allies.
 The most notable accomplishment of the
 Paris visit was the signing of an agreement under
 which Spain contracted to purchase 30 Mirage
 aircraft. Under a special provision, almost half of
 the aircraft construction will be performed in
 Spain. Madrid is also considering the purchase of
 French tanks.
 During the past several months Spain and
 France have also discussed the possibility of
 forming a Mediterranean "pact" to ensure the
 security of the western Mediterranean. It is not

 clear which side revived this idea, as both De
 Gaulle and Franco have espoused it in the past.
 The pact, which may be no more than an agree-
 ment to consult, would include France, Spain,
 Italy, Greece, and certain Maghreb countries, or
 some combination of these.
 Spain is interested because of its
 concern over expansion of Soviet influence in the
 area. Madrid may feel that pact consultations
 would improve its relations with the Maghreb
 countries, but its main reason would be the op-
 portunity to enhance its international standing
 and improve its chances of eventually getting into
 NATO. Lopez Bravo told Secretary Rogers last
 month that he had discussed with the French how
 such a pact arrangement might be achieved, but
 that Spain would act with the full understanding
 and support of the United States. The idea is
 likely to remain a French-Spanish project, for an
 Italian official has already said his country would
 not be interested, and participation of the
 Maghreb countries at this time is doubtful.
 IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE USSR
 AND EASTERN EUROPE
 The cabinet is interested in stepping up rela-
 tions with the Soviet Union and the Eastern
 European countries. An indication of this goal
 was the brief stopover that Lopez Bravo made in
 Moscow en route to Manila last December, when
 he met with a Soviet Foreign Ministry official at
 the airport. Lopez Bravo is influenced by his
 long-time support for increasing Soviet-Spanish
 trade as well as by the possibility that better
 relations would put Madrid in line with the ef-
 forts of the EC countries to expand ties with
 Eastern Europe.
 The main development since Lopez Bravo's
 visit was the arrival in Madrid in late March of a
 Soviet shipping delegation to set up an office
 Special Report
 under terms of the port facilities agreement
 signed in February 1969. This may lead to even-
 tual subdiplomatic relations. The Soviets are also
 pressing for a TASS office in Spain and the estab-
 lishment of Madrid-Moscow flights by Soviet and
 Spanish airlines. Madrid is likely to move slowly,
 however, on giving the Soviets any significant
 presence in Spain. It believes it must balance its
 desire for improved trade and relations with its
 concern over Soviet expansion in the Mediter-
 ranean area.
 The present cabinet has continued the policy
 of its predecessor in establishing formal consular
 relations with Eastern European countries. This
 policy began with Romania in 1967 and was
 followed with Poland in July 1969 and Hungary
 in December. Negotiations for consular relations
 have been undertaken with Bulgaria, and a similar
 move with Czechoslovakia is expected.
 The Spanish Government has accepted in
 principle the Warsaw Pact proposal for a confer-
 ence on European Security. The Spaniards have
 indicated publicly their strong support for this
 proposal with the proviso that the United States
 and Canada participate and that it have careful
 preparation. They are urging that a date for the
 conference be set before September, a stand that
 goes beyond the more cautious NATO position.
 While devoting considerable attention to the
 promotion of Spain's ties with Europe, the new
 government has not neglected relations with the
 United States. In fact, Lopez Bravo immediately
 raised the matter of beginning negotiations on a
 new relationship to replace the bilateral defense
 agreement that expires next September. Spanish
 discontent with the amount of grant aid offered
 by the United States during negotiations for re-
 newal of the agreement in 1968 led Madrid to

 refuse to sign by the deadline and to invoke a
 consultation period that finally resulted in a
 shorter renewal period than the five years stipu-
 lated in the original agreement. In negotiations
 now under way, the Spaniards say they have
 abandoned the idea of rent for the bases. Instead
 they are stressing the need to replace the present
 US control over the bases with a "truly shared"
 US-Spanish control mechanism. They are also
 interested in having the new agreement permit
 Spain to participate along with NATO in deci-
 sions involving -European defense. Also, Madrid
 desires to increase and strengthen commitments
 to defend the Spanish security area. But the new
 government appears to want to continue its
 special tie with the United States and to expand it
 by including nonmilitary items such as aid to
 education. Although Spain could still make un-
 reasonable demands, it seems likely that it will
 accept some sort of compromise that can be
 presented to the Spanish people as an increase in
 international prestige.
 One immediate possible irritant in US.-
 Spanish relations may arise from the preferential
 trade agreement Spain has negotiated with the
 European Communities. Because Madrid is de-
 sirous that the agreement will lead to eventual
 association with the EC, it hopes Washington?
 which generally opposes preferential trading
 agreements, will leniently interpret the GATT'
 provision requiring that such agreements have a
 definite time schedule for full association.
 Although the cabinet's initial policy state-
 ment omitted any reference to Spain's relations
 with the Arab countries, Lopez Bravo later ex-
 plained that this did not mean any neglect or
 change in Madrid's traditional ties with the Arab
 states. To reaffirm this, he made an official visit
 to Cairo last January and to Rabat in early May.
 Special Report
 He also invited Nasir to visit Madrid. In addition,
 agreement has been reached to permit the Arab
 League to open an office in Madrid. Concurrently
 with the new flexibility, however, Lopez Bravo
 also softened Madrid's usual hard line toward
 Israel, which it does not recognize, when he
 stated in an interview in March that Spain's
 friendship with the Arabs does not mean that it is
 an enemy of Israel.
 Lopez Bravo is also interested in expanding
 Spanish relations in Asia. He was able to do this
 and also promote Spain's ties with the former
 Hispanic nations by going to Manila last Decem-
 ber for the inauguration of President Marcos, at
 which time he offered a $10-million Spanish
 credit to the Filipinos. He also used that occasion
 to meet the Mexican foreign minister, and this led
 to an understanding that their ambassadors in
 Washington would hold talks regarding the estab-
 lishment of consular relations.
 The new cabinet is following the economic
 programs of its predecessor, at least for the im-
 mediate future. This was to be expected because
 Economic Planning Minister Lopez Rodo, who
 held the same position in the outgoing cabinet,
 played a leading role in devising those plans.
 Inasmuch as a majority of technocrats in the
 present cabinet were chosen on his recommenda-
 tion, Lopez Rodo should be better able to imple-
 ment his plans now.
 Essentially economic policy is governed by
 the Second Economic and Social Development
 Plan, which was adopted in February 1969 to run
 through 1971. This plan, as did its predecessor,
 attempts to set target performances for each
 sector of the economy so that each will know
 where the related sectors and the economy as a
 whole are headed. The Second Plan seeks a more

 rational allocation of resources in order to achieve
 the greatest long-run economic growth and to
 increase the competitiveness of the economy with
 a view to further integration into the world
 economy. The plan stresses improvement in agri-
 culture, which has lagged behind other sectors of
 the economy, as well as in basic industries, trans-
 port, and communications. It emphasizes the
 need for more and better education, scientific
 research, housing, and urban services. It aims at a
 5.5 percent average annual growth of GNP for the
 period through 1971 and will attempt to bring
 about an increase in investment-especially in
 export-oriented industries-relative to total con-
 sumption.
 When the new cabinet took over, there was
 need for prompt action to restrain the growth of
 domestic demand and to cool the economy. Al-
 though the government has pledged to take the
 action necessary to maintain stable growth, it has
 appeared to be reluctant to promulgate deflation-
 ary measures because these would be politically
 unpopular. The new cabinet's primary line has
 been to continue the tight monetary policy
 initiated by its predecessor for controlling infla-
 tion. Thus it has continued for 1970 the 18
 percent annual ceiling on new bank credit estab-
 lished last September, and has raised the redis-
 count rate of the Bank of Spain to 6.5 percent.
 The cabinet has also moved to postpone
 government spending by ordering an indefinite
 delay of 10 percent of planned central govern-
 ment expenditure projected in the 1970 budget,
 which contained a 12 percent increase over the
 1969 budget approved by the old cabinet. The
 government also imposed a 20 percent predeposit
 requirement on all imports in hopes of cutting
 down Spain's enormous trade deficit, which was
 responsible for the 1969 balance-of-payments
 deficit.

 On the other hand, the cabinet yielded to
 worker demands for better pay by approving a
 17.6 percent increase in the general minimum
 wage effective on 1 April. This was a. raise from
 102 pesetas ($1.45) to 120 ($1.70) a day. Not-
 withstanding the government's contention that a
 minimum-wage raise is not inflationary because it
 affects only a small group of unskilled workers,
 most impartial observers believe that this increase
 will inevitably have a booster effect upon wages
 in general. The government maintains limited con-
 trols on wages and prices, which are more guide-
 lines than limits to be enforced directly.
 The new cabinet reportedly intends to see
 how well the present regulations work before
 proceeding further. It is also concerned with in-
 creasing Spain's exports, and this goal is reflected
 in the moves to build closer ties with both
 Western and Eastern Europe, and with the USSR.
 The new cabinet immediately impressed ob-
 servers with its alertness and competence and gave
 the impression of working as a team. US officials
 who have had contacts with the ministers have
 remarked on how well informed they are on
 important issues, including those outside the com-
 petence of their ministry. This spring, however,
 reports are being heard of a lack of coordination
 and a rise in frustrations within the cabinet. Al-
 though a certain amount of this reporting may be
 chalked up to the propensity of informed
 Spaniards to gossip about political figures, there
 are some problems at the root of it.
 Among these is the MATESA scandal. This
 involves the misuse of some 10 billion pesetas
 (around $143 million) of government export
 credits by a fast-expanding company, Maquinaria
 Textil del Norte de Espana, SA (MATESA).

 Because government approval was required to get
 these credits, and technocrats associated with
 Opus Dei were involved in approval of these trans-
 actions, opponents of the Catholic organization
 have tried to blame Opus Dei ministers. The min-
 isters of commerce and finance may have been
 dropped in the October cabinet changes in
 response to pressure to find those ultimately re-
 sponsible, but the official investigation to deter-
 mine responsibility and decide who should be
 punished has continued. The company president
 and several associates this week were given stiff
 fines and sentenced to prison terms of up to three
 years. Recently the investigation has been moved
 to the level of the Supreme Court so that minis-
 ters or ex-ministers can be indicted if necessary.
 This action implies that Franco himself has de-
 cided to let the case run its full course. Although
 the most likely result would be the indictment of
 the ex-ministers of finance and commerce, it
 could involve ministers in the present cabinet.
 The two most rumored possibilities are Foreign
 Minister Lopez Bravo, formerly the minister of
 industry, and Education Minister Villar Palasi,
 formerly a legal adviser to MATESA. It would be
 contrary to Franco's usual way of operating to let
 a case go so far as to involve a member of so
 recently  chosen a cabinet, however. Con-
 sequently, some solution not involving the
 present cabinet is likely to be found. However,
 the widespread criticism that the case has aroused
 makes it difficult to rule out entirely Franco's
 letting the chips fall where they may.
 Other difficult problems confronting the
 cabinet are financing the new education reform
 program, replacing old guard officials in the Na-
 tional Movement with more moderate officials,
 and living with the current budgetary restrictions
 on ministerial programs. These restrictions may
 have been involved in the recent resignation of
 Minister of Public Works Silva Munoz. He men-
 tioned family reasons, but some observers see his
 departure as a strategic withdrawal to avoid being
 identified with a cabinet that may be embarrassed
 by the MATESA scandal. As the member of a
 rival Catholic Action group, Silva Munoz may
 have considered himself outnumbered in the new
 cabinet and ready to build up political contacts
 outside the government.
 Last month after two leading Madrid news-
 papers published separate articles about the need
 for political liberalization in Spain, the editors of
 one of them, ABC, were ordered to print an
 article by one Gines de Buitrago, which, it soon
 became known, was a pseudonym for Franco and
 Carrero Blanco. In an angry rebuttal to critics of
 the present system, the authors likened calls for
 political democracy after the ills that existed
 prior to the present government as comparable to
 advising a reformed alcoholic to return to drink.
 The article made it evident that the regime does
 not intend to permit changes in the present po-
 litical setup. Such a warning against democracy
 does nothing to help efforts of the technocrats to
 lead Spain to reintegration into Western Europe.
 But the technocrats are pragmatists and are will-
 ing to work toward long-range goals to be
 achieved  after Franco goes.
