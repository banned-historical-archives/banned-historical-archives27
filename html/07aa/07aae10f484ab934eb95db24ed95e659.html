 China: A Touch of Paralysis
 Despite the outward appearance of order in China, stability has not been fully
 re-established since the purge a year ago of Lin Piao. The notion that Defense
 Minister Lin Piao, the man chosen personally by party chairman Mao Tse-tung as
 designated successor, could turn against the great helmsman has sharply eroded
 confidence in the country's leadership. The failure to reconstitute the ruling Polit-
 buro and replace the military leaders who went down with Lin, together with the
 general absence of leadership turnouts and authoritative policy pronouncements,
 leaves a clear impression that tensions exist among the surviving leaders-on impres-
 sion that is evidently share i by numerous low- and middle-level cadres in China.
 Moreover, there are signs that a significant number of military men who hold power
 in the provinces may also be purged-a situation that involves real risks for domestic
 political order.
 During this time of uncertainty and strain, Premier Chou En-lai has played a
 pivotal role, seeking to diminish the divisive forces at work while guiding China on
 the road toward political recovery. It is largely through his efforts that the political,
 military and economic machinery has continued to function. On the question of the
 fate of the military leaders in the provinces, for example, Chou seems intent on
 limiting the damage, at least until the wounds of the Lin affair have had time to
 heal. His efforts at moderation are meeting resistance, however, and further clashes
 within the Politburo are by no means out of the question. In such a conflict, Mao's
 role obviously would be a determining factor, and the aging party chairman seems to
 be keeping his options open.
 In view of the magnitude of the problem,
 the regime has achieved notable success in
 managing the aftermath of the purge of Lin Piao.
 Basic social order has been maintained. The
 armed forces have remained stable while the
 regime moved to re-subordinate them to civilian
 party control. The trend toward moderation in
 domestic po!icies-a trend evident since 1969 and
 one that has wide popular support-has been even
 more pronounced since Lin's departure. In the
 conduct of foreign affairs, Peking has scored a
 succession of triumphs in 1972, the fruit of a
 decision several years ago to pursue a more
 pragmatic and outjoing foreign policy.
 Nevertheless, the events of last autumn
 dramatically shattered the fragile political mosaic
 Special Report                              - 3 -
 painfully constructed at the party congress in
 1969, and the leadership has been extremely
 cautious in picking up the pieces. The havoc is
 most evident within the Politburo itself; only 16
 of the original 25 members named in 1969 are
 still mentioned in the official press, by name, and
 of these only a dozen appear to be taking part in
 the affairs of state in a meaningful way. The delay
 in reconstituting the Politburo is undoubtedly
 associated with the question of the military's
 proper place in that body.
 While the regime wrestles with this problem,
 the armed forces are without designated leaders.
 Marshal Yeh Chien-ying has been serving as de
 facto defense minister but has not been officially
 appointed to this position. Similarly, no one has
 been named to replace chief of staff Huang
 Yung-sheng, and the vacancies at the top of the

 air force, navy, and logistics services remain un-
 filled. This does not mean that the administration
 of the armed forces has been neglected .jr that the
 efficiency of the armed forces has suffered se-
 verely; merely that they have been an uncom-
 monly long time without formally d3signated
 leaders.
 Because Lin was officially designated Mao's
 successor, Peking must also work out a new for-
 muia for succession and rewrite a substantial
 segment of party history. The idea of a post-Mao
 "collective leadership" has persisted for at least a
 year, anti it seems likely that it is the composition
 of this collective, rather than the principle itself,
 that is still at issue. While Peking vacillates, the
 leadership grows older: Mao Tse-tung will be 79
 this month, and Premier Chou is 74.
 The Lin affair and its sequel make it ap,-;ear
 that one of the central issues in Peking is civilian
 versus military control. In fact, the issues at stake
 are much more complex. Evidence-some of it
 antedating Lin's demise-indicates that while the
 institutional problem is a real one, the leadership
 has long been deeply divided on a much wider
 range of policy and personnel questions. The
 Cultural Revolution itself, with its bitter factional
 disputes and Red Guard mania, clearly added to
 and intensified personal antipathies, particularly
 between radical leaders who were identified with
 its excesses and those of a more moderate persua-
 sion. It is hard to believe that these antipathies
 have now vanished or that, on any given issue,
 they no longer cut across institutional lines,
 including the armed forces.
 The actual facts surrounding the demise of
 Lin Piao in September 1971 may never be known
 in detail, but, in any event, it has not ended the
 rivalry between moderate and radical forces at the
 center. The purge removed the leading spokesman
 of radical interests in the armed forces, Lin Piao
 himself. On the other hand, it also claimed as
 victims high-level military officers who had been
 at the opposite end of the political spectrum,
 most notably the former chief of staff, Huang
 Yung-sheng. Moreover, a campaign against ul-
 Special Report                              - 4 -
 traleftists-which had begun in late 1969 and
 evidently was directed by Chou En-lai-has been
 muted since Lin's fall, even though a number of
 extreme leftist figures are still prominent and
 active. For example, Chiang Ching, deputy head
 of the Cultural Revolution Group, which directed
 Mao's purge of the old party apparatus, should
 have been an earl; target, but as Mao's wife she
 has thus far been immune. Another prominent
 leftist, Shanghai party leader Yao Wen-yuan, con-
 tinues to appear frequently in Pekir.g.
 Despite the  uneasy political equilibrium
 within the leadership in Peking, China's policies at
 home and abroad seem well defined. Rationality
 and pragmatism seem to be the order of the day,
 not only in foreign policy but also in such do-
 mestic areas dear to Mao's heart as education.
 Indeed, some of the present educational policies,
 such as the broadening of the academic cur-
 riculum and the special advantages given to tal-
 ented students, are a virtual repudiation of con-
 cepts Mao himself has advocated in the past.
 From time to time, there are hints in domestic
 media that the move toward moderation is being
 challenged on a selective basis, but these chal-
 lenges have had no visible impact on policy
 implementation.
 Military Under Fire
 The protracted effort to repudiate Lin Piao
 is almost certainly raising political temperatures
 throughout the country. Since early this year,
 cadres have been studying a succession of docu-
 ments spelling out the alleged details of Lin's
 coup plut. The key item in this series, the so-
 called "571 document," contains Lin's purported
 operations plan. The plan lists not only those
 forces that Lin could count on for support-
 primarily in the air force-but also a number of
 other military units he was attempting to enlist in
 the plot. The implication is strong that there are
 elements within the armed forces whose loyalty is
 being questioned in Peking. The most recent doc-
 ument in the anti-Lin series, issued in early July,
 is more ominous. It suggests that the central
 authorities may be considering moves against a
 wide range of military leaders and that the au-
 thorities will not in the future wait for written
 evidence to move against such individuals.

 Some members of the leadership may in fact
 be exploiting the Lin affair to bring down the
 military leaders of the provinces. This impression
 has been reinforced in recent weeks by the failure
 If a move against these leaders is under way,
 even on a selected basis, it risks jeopardizing do-
 mestic political order. The Cultural Revolution
 dismantled the old party and government bu-
 reaucracies, leaving the military as the best avail-
 able unified instrument of control. Efforts have
 been made to re-establish the civilian party struc-
 ture and to reassert the party's leading role, but
 military Izaders still hold the balance of power in
 the party apparatus in many pla,.es outside
 Peking.  Thus, a move against these military
 leaders, particularly if widespread, could con-
 ceivably cause a breakdown in control, since no
 alternative mechanism is available to fill the void.
 This consideration could help explain why Peking
 is moving with such caution in this matter.

 Given this background, it is no suprising to
 find that in 1972 Chou is again being linked with
 efforts to protect harassed military administrators
 in the provinces.
 An example of how a provincial luminary
 can be buffeted about is provided by the case of
 Liu Hsing-yuan, a career military officer who ran
 Kwangtung Province until March of this year. At
 that time, reports began to circulate that Liu, a
 close associate of purged chief of staff Huang
 Yung-sheng, was being transferred to the top
 party post in Szechwan Province in southwest
 China. His transfer to Szechwan would serve two
 objectives: it would separat,3 him from his south
 China power base, thus carrying out the logical
 extension of Huang's purge; at the same time, it
 would preserve his prestige, because his assign-
 ment would be an even more responsible post.
 Similar stratagems were used by Premier Chou
 during the Cultural Revolution on the behalf of

 After remaining in the shadows for seven
 months, Liu Hsing-yuan showed up again last
 week in Szechwan. He was identified only as a
 "leading member" of the Szechwan hierarchy,
 but the fact that he gave the major speech for the
 occasion will be a signal to many that he is or will
 be the province chief. This sequence of events
 suggests that Liu's transfer may have been
 opposed by those seeking to reduce the influence
 of moderate elements within the military estab-
 lishment. The length of his absence from view
 could mean that Chou, if in fact he pushed for

 Liu's transfer, had some difficulty getting his way
 even though he finally prevailed.
 Chou, in any event, can be expected to have
 a realistic view of the dangers inherent in trying
 to reduce the army's political role too abruptly.
 He is apt to urge caution at every step along this
 path. The moderates among the provinical mili-
 tary figures would appear to have nowhere else to
 turn if they are to make their voices heard in
 Peking.
 Many of the fires that Chou has been called
 upon to put out in the last six years were lit by
 Mao's wife, Chiang Ching. On at least one oc-
 casion, she herself was burned. In July 1967, at
 the height of the Wuhan confrontation, Chiang
 Ching urged that her militant Red Guard groups
 be armed in order to defend themselves against
 the repressive actions of the conservative military

 leaders in the provinces. Chaos ensued, and by
 September 1967 Madame Mao was obliged to
 back down and disavow her slogan, "arm the
 masses."

 noyance on the premier's part at Chiang Ching's
 behavior. The fact that Chou and Madame Mao
 are poles apart temperamentally as well as politi-
 cally does not mean that they are in permanent
 and implacable opposition on every issue; nor
 does Chiang Ching appear to be in a position to
 challenge Chou directly. Chou, for his part, is in
 no position to put the madame down completely
 as long as she retains Mao's patronage.

 obscure. In some respects, lie has removed himself
 from the public stage. He has not presided over a
 major public gathering since the funeral of the
 late foreign minister Chen I in January 1972 and
 has not appeared on the rostrum at Tien An Men
 Square in Peking since May 1971. The chairman's
 periodic meetings with foreign visitors in his
 private residence indicate that his mental and
 physical condition are probably not the reason
 for his reduced public activity.
 The pattern of Mao's recent activities, in
 fact, is reminiscent of earlier periods in which he
 engaged in intense behind-the-scenes maneu-
 vering, either to shore up his own position or to
 plot the next move against real or fancied op-
 ponents. It could be, for example, that Mao is
 personally directing the anti-Lin campaign,
 viewing it as an opportunity to settle scores with
 a number of provincial military leaders, primarily
 those whose opposition to the  Red Guard

 movement led to a closing out of the Cultural
 Revolution before it had accomplished all of
 Mao's objectives.
 On the other hand, the chairman must rec-
 ognize that his close personal identification with
 Lin renders him vulnerable in important ways.
 The 571 document contains unusually harsh
 words about Mao's leadership. It accuses him of
 imposing ill-conceived and unpopular domestic
 programs and characterizes him as a "cruel
 tyrant." This attack on the chairman is attributed
 25X1
 to Lin, and it has been circulated with Mao's
 explicit approval. Still, the effect has been to give
 wide publicity to a list of grievances against Mao
 with which many officials can identify. Indeed,
 there are signs that the regime-and perhaps Mao
 himself-are taking steps to disassociate the chair-
 man from the Cultural Revolution experience. A
 letter now circulating officially seems designed to
 show that Mao was opposed to Lin Piao and that
 Piao was less than enamored with "leftists" in
 general as early as 1966. This hardly seems to
 conform with the facts.
 The 571 Document on Mao's Leadership,16 January 1972
 (Mao) is the greatest dictator and tyrant in the history of China.
 The days of B-52 (this reference is clearly to Mao) are numbered. B-52 has consistently
 adopted the tactics of "divide and rule"; he is very cunning and treacherous and very rarely leaves
 his residence.
 Nobody has ever been able to work with him from beginning to end. Today you are his guest
 of honor, but tomorrow you will be his prisoner.
 He is a suspicious and cruel maniac.
 His several secretaries and some people who were close to him were either killed or locked up
 and struggled against.
 The struggle in the party has come to typify his personal likes and grudges.
 The leadership of the ruling group has fallen into corrupt, decadent, ignorant, and inefficient
 hands.
 The troops are under pressure, and dissatisfaction is widespread among cadres of the middle
 and upper ranks.
 Initially the Red Guards were hoodwinked into serving as cannon fodder, but now they are
 being suppressed, criticized, and repudiated. The sending of intellectual youth to the mountains it
 the countryside is just another torm of labor reform.
 Cadres sent to the countryside are just swelling the ranks of the unemployed.
 The living standard of workers and peasants is falling; the freezing of the wages of the
 workers, particularly young workers, has increased dissatisfaction.
 The socialist system in China is now being threatened in a serious manner.

 At the same time, there has been a marked
 de-emphasis in Mao's role as the party's theo-
 retical guide. Propaganda organs in China are
 reverting to more orthodox ways of justifying
 policy; namely, invoking the authority of the
 "party line" rather than citing passages from
 chairman Mao's works. Mao himself has given
 personal approval to a general playing down of his
 "cult," however, and speculation within-and out-
 side-China that Mao is losing his grip and is
 about to step down is at best premature.

 The Coming Months
 At this juncture, these domestic headaches
 seem containable. Pro',incial military leaders are
 not being faced, either collectively or individ-
 ually, with the massive public attacks and orches-
 trated violence that were a leitmotif of the
 Cultural Revolution. Premier Chou's coricein for
 the loyalty of the armed forces to the political
 system is surely as great as his concern for the
 cohesion of the military establishment. On both

 scores, he is likely to attempt to limit the damage
 rather than place himself at the head of a group
 determined to end the pressures against the mili-
 tary, especially if such a stance would involve
 open defiance of Mao.
 Mao's motives in the present situation are
 less predictable. He was stung by the army's
 equivocal role in the Cultural Revolution, and
 vindictiveness on his part could be .4 major factor
 in the current drive to unseat the provincial mili-
 tary. Mao presumably is aware of the disruptive
 influence of his wife, but he seems unwilling to
 put a stop to all her activities. On the other hand,
 the chairman's willingness to support relatively
 conservative and pragmatic policies at home as
 well as abroad seems to indicate that he is not
 preparing for another major political offensive at
 this time. Mao seems intent on establishing a
 better balance between competing leftist and con-
 servative forces-and hence enhancing his own
 maneuverability-by whittling away at the pre-
 dominantly conservative military leaders in the
 provinces through a process of linking them, how-
 ever tenuously, to Lin Piao.
 25X1
 Mao may not be content for long merely to
 whittle away. His seeming lack or activity and the
 surface calm in China may again only be the
 reassuring backdrop an old magician artfully
 develops before he unveils his next startling trick.
 A hint as to what it will be may have beer,
 provided  in  appointments  recently  made  in
 Peking. While most of the new appointees are
 conservatives who were under attack during the
 Cultural Revolution, there are two notable excep-
 tions. The elevation of these two leftist veterans
 of the Cultural Revolution points to the possi-
 bility of yet another leftward swing of the  olit-
 ical  pendulum.
