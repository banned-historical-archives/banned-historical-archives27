 The article notes that the party committees continue to re-
 quest experienced workers from the higher party authorities
 instead of "patiently training" local personnel.   "In Drogabych
 Oblast there are only six local persons serving as Secretaries
 of Executive Committees of town and rayon councils, only nine
 local deputy chairmen, and many posts are not occupied at all."

 Ukraine,
 3.           Czech Government denounces payments in kind in effort to
 'tighten control over distribution:  Premier  n onin  apotoc y
 has recently denounced payments in kind which are still being
 made as bonuses to workers in certain consumer goods indus-
 tries as apt to disrupt the rationing system and as unfair to
 workers in industries in which such bonuses are not given.
 Comment:   The Czech Government is attempting by all means
 to maintain. strict control of the distribution of scarce con-
 sumer goods so that it can utilize them most effectively as a
 political weapon.
 4.          Finnish Foreign minister reportedly considering resigna-
 tion:   The American Legation in Helsinki reports that Foreign
 Minister Sakari Tuomioja?s wife has intimated that he intends
 to resign his cabinet position because the combined jobs of
 Foreign Minister and Director of the Bank of Finland are too
 heavy a load,   The Bank reportedly wishes to have him back full
 time in view of the unfavorable trend in foreign trade and the
 probable shift from inflationary to deflationary pressures in
 the Finnish economy.                                                           25X1
 Comment: Tuomioja, a political independent, is highly
 respec a  a,n Finnish business and nanking circles,   He is con-
 sidered to have a pro-Western orientation even though, like
 his predecessor in the Foreign Ministry, Ake Gartz,   he is a
 member of the Board of Directors of the Finland-Soviet Union
 Society.
 In Naming a successor, Prime Minister Kekkonen would be
 guided by the necessity to appoint an individual who would not
 arouse the suspicion or distrust of the Soviet Union.
 Hungarian
 factory leadership

 ers from taking vacations:   T e Hungarian. trade union newspaper

 and trade unions for poor control work that resulted in workers
 losing the benefit of their vacations.   Instead of taking a

 rest, some miners reportedly cultivated their own farms,
 others took temporary. employment, and some factory hands re-
 mained at their jobs during vacation periods in order to ful-
 fill the plan.   The newspaper reproved factory leaders who put
 plan fulfillment above the provisions of the labor code re-
 quiring vacations with pay.
 Comment: This article shows unusual solicitude for the
 welfare     Hungarian workers, who usually are exhorted to la-
 bor longer hours on Stakhanovite projects.   It is possible
 that the trade union leadership is showing signs of opposition
 to the excessive demands made upon labor.   However,  the article
 simply may be a sop thrown to the workers. Certainly the party
 newspaper of the same day echoed the usual line, asking workers
 to fan "the flame of labor competitions" in honor of Constitu-
 tion Day on 20 August.

 ski:A Po  s   Government broadcast announcing a commemoration
 ceremony on 1 August for those killed in the Bor uprising de-
 manded a public trial of General Bor and other underground
 leaders. Josef Rokicki's book "Lights and Shadows" is quoted
 to condemn General Bor.                                                   25X1

 Comment:      The Communists consistently have called the
 famous Warsaw Rising of August-September 1944 the "Bor Up-
 rising" in an attempt to place the blame for the destruction
 of Warsaw and the annihilation of many thousands of its in-
 habitants on General Bor-Komorowski.   These attempts have not
 proved successful, however, in removing the impression which
 still persists in Poland that Stalin and General Rokossowski's
 units of the Red Army were responsible for the catastrophe,
 by their refusal to send help until it was too late to pre-
 vent the brutal suppression of the rising by the Germans.
 The fact that a public trial is contemplated for General
 Bor and his Home Army associates suggests that the belief is
 still strong among the Polish people that the Russians were
 responsible, and that the Polish Communist leaders consider it
 necessary to take unusual measures to counteract it.
 Correction:   The last sentence of Item 8, page 5, in the
 Current i~n.fel1igence Digest of 1 August, should read:   "It is
 not unlikely, therefore, that discharged service men are being  25X1
 alrected to essential industries."
 Comment:  Marshal Tito contends that the USSR, aided and
 abetted  y "reactionary" enemies in the West, is attempting
 through fabrications and other devious means to isolate Yugo-
 slavia from the West.
 The relaxation of Soviet-Satellite border pressures on
 the Yugoslav frontier,  the appearance of stories in the Western
 press questioning the authenticity of the Cominform break, And
 conciliatory treatment accorded to Yugoslavia at the June ses-
 sion of the Danubian Commission,  lend  some credence to Tito's
 theory,

 re-election
 Korean
 cured:    yngman   ee s re-election on   August for a four-year
 term is a foregone conclusion, according to US Ambassador
 Muccio.   His controlling position over the majority of social
 and patriotic organizations throughout South Korea, as well as
 the support of the government's propaganda machine, will as-
 sure Rhee an overwhelming majority.
 A fairly sizeable protest vote may develop, nevertheless,
 with the majority of these votes going to Cho Pong-am, former
 National Assembly vice-speaker.  Cho has waged the most  .
 spirited campaign against Rhee while the two remaining presi-
 dential hopefuls have done little more than advance initial
 declarations of principles to the press.
 In the important vice presidential race no less than
 nine candidates are registered with Yi Pom-sok, widely con-
 sidered South Korea's second ranking politico and rated as
 the pre-election favorite.  Yi's control of the Liberal
 Party and his influence in the Taehan Youth Corps give him
 a tremendous advantage over the other vice presidential
 aspirants.   Stumping the countryside extensively, his major
 campaign technique has been to sew up the unanimous support
 of rural organizations.
 It has become increasingly clear, however, that Prime
 Minister Chang Taek-sang and the new Home Minister, Kim
 Tae-son--undoubtedly under Rhee's instructions--have been
 diligently trying to stop Yi's election,   It appeared to
 Embassy officials on 1 August, however, that only a public
 disavowal of Yi by the President could prevent Yi from win-
 ning a plurality of the vice presidential votes.
 13.        French official reports on Chinese economy and morale:
 The former French  Consul  General at Shanghai, w o -e        na
 in late July, sees "no hope" for foreign trade and business
 interests in China. He states that the Communist administra-
 tion is effective, but that commerce and industry are "com-
 pletely ruined."
 He also reports that the Chinese populace is apathetic
 toward the regime and toward the Korean conflict in particu-
 lar.                           F7          I

 Comment:  There is no evidence that the strength of the
 Peiping regime has been seriously reduced by the current
 economic depression.   The depression is acute among private
 businessmen, but agricultural production and the output of
 state-operated heavy industries are at comparatively high
 levels.
 Other sources have also reported popular apathy in
 China recently.
 14.          Portugal willing to bargain with Peiping on Macao:   The
 American  massy in Lisbon reports-that Foreign Ministry
 officials fear that Chinese attacks on Macao this week have
 been directed from Peiping, and are directly related to re-
 strictions on the Macao-China trade.  A Foreign Ministry
 spokesman intimated that Portugal would be "quite willing"
 to make trade concessions in order to retain Macao.   He asked
 for "understanding" on the part of the United States.
 Meanwhile, the Lisbon government has instructed Macao
 authorities to avoid incidents  but to fight back when
 attacked.
 Comment:  The Portuguese Government has firmly resisted
 American pressure to halt all strategic exports to China
 because of the "very serious consequences" this would have for
 Macao.   Accordingly, it has applied for presidential exception
 from the provisions of the Battle Act for a select number of
 strategic goods.
 15,          Chinese resume food shipments to Macao:                         25X1
 I                                             Ia ~qu~ier on me
 crana-M cao border as of     ugust. No information has been
 received on the progress of negotiations between the Portu-
 guese and the Chinese Communists, but food is again coming
 into the                China and prices'are dropping.               25X1
 Comment:                                       I contradicting  25X1
 earlier       t s,      e  on 30 July that food shipments from
 China to Macao had been stopped.
 Although the resumption of food shipments on 1 August
 relaxes Communist pressure on Macao, the threat of a new
 embargo will assure Portuguese complaisance in negotiations
 with the Chinese.  Macao depends on China for most of its
 food, and the Communists could starve the colony into surrender.

 17,         USSR-Indonesian trade discussions conducted in Bangkok:
 Soviet Embassy officials have had discussions with the Indo-
 nesian Minister and his commercial staff looking to the
 signing of a barter trade agreement.   The USSR reportedly
 offered capital goods in exchange for rubber, tin, and
 coconut oil and allegedly is sending trucks and passenger
 cars to Indonesia for demonstration.   Apparently no
 under-
 standing has yet been reached.                                          25X1

 repatriate Chinese Nationalist troops through Rangoon, and in-
 tends to begin military operations against the Nationalists
 in the fall unless they are evacuated.
 The Embassy comments that Ba Swe is apparently sincere,
 but that his timetable appears to be optimistic and the
 repatriation of such a large number of troops who have no
 effective leadership seems impractical.  Nevertheless, the
 Embassy feels that a solution is urgent because an open con-
 flict between Burmese forces and the Nationalists would
 brio  serious repercussions for local anti-Communist Chinese.
 Comment:   Burmese Commander in Chief Ne Win'recently
 announcedat he was planning an all-out campaign against
 the Nationalists, who number 7,000 to 10,000.  A concentrated
 Burmese attack on the Nationalists would greatly benefit the
 Communist and Karen insurgents.
 20.           Communist military activity in Malaya apparently de-
 creasing:  During the week ending 24 July, Malayan police
 c asua   es and the total number of Communist-inspired inci-
 dents were the lowest in 19 months,  This fact, coupled with
 low civilian casualties, reflects a continued trend toward
 riot activity.
 Comment:  A document captured during the spring of
 1952 a m   ed the deterioration of the Communist position in
 Malaya and directed a reduction in military activity and
 the indoctrination of a wider segment of the population.

 21.                Defection of Liberal deput  eliminates Greek Government
 majority:  The par  amen ary majority o  the LiberaI-011C
 coa    on disappeared on 30 July with the resignation from
 the party of a Liberal deputy from north-central Greece.
 The Liberal-EPEK coalition now controls 129 seats, exactly
 half of the membership of parliament.
 Former Prime Minister and Greek Rally supporter Papan-

 the King to dissolve parliament or compel the government to
 rely on the eight Communist-controlled EDA deputies in order

 the opposition Greek Rally is trying to bring about its fall
 through defections.
 The King is strongly opposed to Marshal Papagos, the
 probable victor in new elections, and may prefer to rely
 on the EDA deputies rather than dissolve parliament.

 244         East German Alert Police now reported to number 82 0000
 American military authorities  n Germany estimate that continued
 recruiting has raised the strength of the East German para-
 military Alert Police from 70,000 on 1 June to at least 82,000
 by 30 July.   Reportedly, individuals are now being recruited
 between the ages of 16 and 30, the bfsic trainipg period has been
 extended from four to six weeks, and theirecruiting campaign has
 procured about 34,000 men since 1 April.   Recruiting is expected
 to continue at the Same rate.
 While each of the 24 Alert Police units consists now of
 about 3,000 officers and men, the Police must undergo extensive
 training before it attains any significant offensive capability.

 Fear of
 military service
 of East German refugees-  The recent mass flight of refugees into
 Est Berlin was tout ed off by widespread rumors, that the Berlin
 sector crossing points would be closed on 1 August and by fear of
 induction into the East German labor and military organizations.
 Refugees now average 1,000 a day, five times the daily average
 last spring.
 Communist sensitivity to this exodus has been demonstrated
 by the modification of the propaganda slogans for the rally of
 Communist youth in East Berlin on 3 August.  When the rally was
 first announced on 19 July, the appeals for youth participation
 emphasized the "overthrow the Reuter government" theme.   This
 theme was altered on 31 July to "eliminate" the Berlin refugee
 settlements,

 West German Transport Ministry and( American officials now believe
 that the Helmstedt-Berlin autobahn will probably be closed for

 being assembled near the Elbe River bridge, and a German truck
 driver was recentl  told by a Russian officer that the road would
 soon be closed.

 Comment:  Although the closing of the Helmstedt autobahn
 wouldoc  all highway access to Berlin by Allied natiols,
 three roads would still be available for German use.
 This move would come at a time when canal traffic to West
 Berlin is expected to be severely restricted because of "repairs"
 to the main canal and low water in the secondary canal.   Soviet
 authorities have not yet replied to the Allied request for five
 additional daily trains to Berlin to compensate for the closing
 of the main canal.

 American labor support:   Leon Jouhaux, the prominent  rent.
 oc a  st trade union leader and head of the recently formed
 "anti-Communist" peace movement, Fighting Democracy, plans to
 visit Great Britain and the United States in September in order
 to solicit labor backing, which he considers indispensable to
 the new movement's success.   Reportedly he has the support of
 President Auriol and eight Cabinet Ministers and is scheduled to
 meet American labor leaders at a dinner in Washington arranged by
 Ambaspador Bonnet.
 According to Louis Dolivet, a promoter of Fighting Democracy
 who gave this information to American Embassy officials, Jouhaux
 intends to block the circulation of a left-wing manifesto against
 the German contractual agreement, and hopes with the aid of
 British labor to organize demonstrations against              oming

 cording to a German Socialist leader, AF of L representatives

 Although the People's Party remains publicly aloof from the VdU,
 some People's Party leaders maintain
 contact with the VdU and have taken steps to preserve the VdU as
 a functioning party.
 The People's Party and the VdU recently defeated a Socialist
 resolution calling for reforms in Austria's two large nationalized
 banks, both of which have been accused of illegal diversions of
 foreign exchange, including ECA dollars.   The VdUQs support of the
 People's Party was considered somewhat unusual at the time in view
 of the former's frequent allegations that the latter is the party
 of corruption.

 script on per o :  T e  eig an Prime minister 1ears t hit recent
 imonstrat o~ ns against retention of the 24-month conscription
 period are wrecking army morale and can "definitely lead to a
 general strike,"  American officials in Brussels believe that the
 gravity of the situation is indicated by the Prime Minister's
 asking them to urge Socialist leaders to cease agitating the issue.
 The Prime Minister states that unless the other EDC countries
 adopt a 24-month military service period before the Belgian Army
 maneuvers end in late September, Belg ium will reduce its 24-month
 period,
 Comment:  Since there is no possibility that France and Italy
 will  'nose their 18-month conscription periods at this time,
 the issue for the Belgian Government has become one of announcing
 the reduction at such a time as to avoid further popular disorders
 and to minimize the cabinet's loss of prestige.
 The 24-hour national protest strike for 9 August, announced
 by the Socialist Federation of Labor on 2 August, is unlikely to
 have effects much more serious than those of the sporadic token
 strikes which have already occurred.

 An army coup is expected in 15 to 30 days when crowds viewing
 Senora de Peron's body have cleared the capital.  Brigadier General
 FLlomeno Velazco, former Chief of Federal Police, has reportedly
 been designated as Peron's successor.
 The US Naval Attache in Buenos Aires comments that a clash
 between the army and organized labor seems likely, but Peron's
 desire to resign seems doubtful.
 25X1
 Comment:  There are no other indications that Peron desires
 to res      although he probably anticipates increasing difficulty
 in preventing a clash between labor and the army, which objects
 to labor's powerful political role.
 Little is known of General Velazco's activities during the
 past three years, although they have included governorship of the
 Province of Corrientes.   He has, however, apparently maintained
 contact with some of the retired army officers involved in the

 in international arms deals, several times in the past two years.
 When Julian was in Guatemala last May, he reportedly signed a

 Guatemalan Minister of Defense.
 Rexim is an international trading company with headquarters

 Comment.-  Considerable information is available on the
 genera sagreement between the Defense Minister and President
 Sukarno. The failure to improve internal security and the de-
 terioration of conditions in West Java have increased senti-
 ment for an authoritarian government led by Sukarno.
 In addition to his normal allowances, Bao Dai recently requested
 $450,000 for a trip to Paris.
 Letourneau,who contends that Bao Dai is indispensable, at
 least for the time being, has not pressed him to economize, a -
 arentlyfearin  that he would threaten to quit.                 25X1
 Comment-   Since Bao Dai's return to Indochina in 1949, he
 has s owniimself more concerned with personal pleasure than
 with affairs of state, despite the heavy financial burdens of
 the war which are borne almost entirely by France and the United
 States.  He has exercised his broad, though ill-defined powers,
 in a desultory and irresponsible fashion and has opposed the
 establishment of representative government.
 There is little evidence that Bao Dai's permanent with-
 drawal from Indochina would be regretted by the 'Vietnamese.
