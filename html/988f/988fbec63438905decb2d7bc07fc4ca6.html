 Sept. 15, 1954
 Various advanced experiences and. new working processes continued to
 be popularized in State-owned industry in 1r>>3.
 Among the more notable were:
 In the iron and steel industry, the advanced. blast furnace operating
 experiences of full blast and fast traveling of the charge to cut down
 melting time, regular change of charging frequency to warrant the best
 use of gas energy, and high speed repairs continued to be popularized
 and pig iron output was raised.
 In steel making, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company popularized the
 experience of fixing the raw material quota for open hearth furnaces,
 thus reducing the consumption rate of raw materials.
 In st,:el rolling, the popularization of the "re-erse repeater" device
 invented by Chang h ng-shan raised the efficiency o.C rolling mills.
 In the machine building industry, the "universal fixture" device intented
 by Wang Tsung-lun has not only extended the functions of machine tools
 and raised production efficiency but lent impetus to a mass campaign of
 inventions and innovations.
 In metal cutting, the cutting efficiency was greatly raised by continued
 popularization of the Soviet high-speed cutting method and the multicutter
 and multiedge cutting method introduced by foremost workers in the north-
 east and the wide study of the lathe turning method, invented. by the Soviet
 worker Vasili Kolesov.
 In casting, a new system of division of labo.., was popularized, together
 with the advanced experiences of installing three rows of tuyeres on the
 cupola furnace and the pattern drop method invented by the foundry
 workers.  There was a marked rise in labor productivity and the quality
 of the castings was improved.
 In the coal industry, the proportion of coal output by modern methods
 already reached over 90 percent in State-owned collieries and the extent
 of mechanization of coal haulage at the working faces went up by 23
 percent compared with 1552.
 In the textile industry, in addition '?o continued application of the
 streamlined spinning method invented by Ho Chien-hsii and the weaving
 method formulated in 1951, a new mai:ctenance method of textile machinery
 formulated in 1;53 was publicized.  This new method reduced the break-
 downs in production and raised labor productivity.

 4--Capital construction.
 There was an increase of 66 percent, compared with 1952, in total
 investments in capital construction.
 The total investments of six of the industrial Ministries of the Central
 People's Government was 106 percent higher than the 1952 figure.  Among
 them, Investments of the Ministry of Heavy Industry increased by 02 percent,
 the Ministry of the Fuel Industry by 145 percent, and the First Ministry
 of the Machine Building Industry by 141 percent.  Investments of all other
 Ministries also rose compared with 1952.
 Altogether, 34 major items of industrial construction were started in 1953,
 of which the more notable ones were:  The No. 506 high tension power
 transmission line, the No. 1 Motor Car Plant, and the No. 1 Cotton Mill
 in Peking.
 In. addition, there were 80 major projects of industrial construction which
 were started earlier and continued in 1953.  They included such notable items
 as:  the heavy rolling mill and the seamless tubingmill in Anshan, the
 Haichow open cut coal mine in Fuhsin, a hydroelectric station in Fengman,
 the measuring and cutting tool factory, the State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill
 in the northwest, the Tzunai Sugar Refinery, and a paper milli.in Canton.
 Thirty-six major projects were completed in 1953 and have since gone into
 operation or partial operation.  They included the heavy rolling mill,
 the seamless tubing mill, the No. 7 blast furnace and the No. 8 blast furnace
 in Anshan, the Haichow open cut coal mine inFuhsin, a power plant in Fushun,
 a hydroelectric station in Fengman, the No. 2 Power Plant in Sian, and
 power plants in Urumchi and Chengchow.
 In order to meet the demand of China's industrial construction, considerable
 achievements were also made, in 1953, in geological. prospecting.  There
 was considerable growth of prospecting, designing, and working capacity
 for capital construction.
 In 1953 railway construction, 589 kilometers of track were laid for 7
 railroads under construction.  Of these, 182 kilometers from Lanchow
 to Chiuchuan were laid along the Lanchow-Sinkiang (line?).  One hundred
 sixty-three kilometers from Chengtu to Luehyang were laid along the
 Paoki-Chengtu line.
 In 1953 construction for the timber industry, 314 kt.lometers of narrow
 gauge forest railways were built.

 In 1953's highway construction, 29 major routes were newly built or
 rebuilt.
 Work was carried out on a total of i+,118 kilometers. Of this figure,
 2,689 kilometers were completed--1,507 kilometers  newly built, and
 1,182 kilometers rebuilt.
 In 19531s water conservancy wort 23 major projects were completed.
 Among the more important of these were the Sanho movable dam in the
 lower reaches of the Huai River, the ... and navigation project
 along the lower reaches of the Yellow River in northern Honan Province,
 and the new ... outlet for the Taching and Tzeya Rivers near Tientsin.
 Harnessing work on the Huai River is being continued.
 Major work was completed on the Kwanting Reservoir along the Yungting
 River near Peking. The reservoir proved itself capable of holding back
 an unusually heavy torrent along the Yungting River in the high water
 season in 1953.
 The Tahofang Reservoir was started in the second half of 1953. When com-
 pleted, it will keep the .Liao River under control.
 Buildings with a total floor space of over 30 million square meters were
 completed with State funds in 1953. These included factories,
 warehouses, offices, houses, schools, medical institutes, and army
 quarters. Dwelling houses with a total floor  space of 12 million square
 meters were among those built.
 5--Agricultural production and technical improvement:
 In 1953, considerable natural handicaps occurred in many regions, including
 drought in spring and excessive rain in autumn. However, owing to the active
 leadership, by the organs of the Communist Party and of the Government
 at all levels, of the peasants' fight against these handicaps, the
 intensification of the work of popularizing scientific farming technique
 on the basis of further development in mutual aid and cooperation, and
 other good work, the gross output of grain in 1953 was still somewhat
 higher than in 1952.
 The total output of food crops reached over 165 million tons, and of
 cotton over 1.7 million tons. Compared with 1952, the percentages of
 the outputs of major crops in 1953 follow: rice, 103; wheat, 100;
 soya beans, 106; cotton, 91; surgarcane, 103; sugar beet, 101; peanuts, 90;
 rapeseed, 92; sesame, 108; cured tobacco, 100.

 Cooperative and joint State-private industry accounted for 9 percent in
 1953 as compared with 8 percent in 1~ 2.  The number of handicraft coopera-
 tives rose by 43 percent'over the previous year and their total output by
 76 percent.  The number of agricultu:;.'al cooperatives rose from 3,663 in
 1552 to 113,900.  State-owned and cooperative enterprises handled 'j0 percent
 of the total volume of wholesale tra('.e as against 64 percent in 1952.
 The third improvement was a rise in living standards for the entire people.
 Real wages of personnel in State-owned and joint State-private industrial
 enterprises went up by 5 percent compared with 1952.  Twelve million
 square meters of housing were built by the State for the workers.
 The peasants received a sum of 12 trillion yuan in the form of State
 loans and 56 percent more in means of production than in the previous year
 through supply and marketing cooperatives.
 Dealing with the achievements in the first half of this year, the paper
 points out that capital construction completed by 15 ministries was 57
 percent above that finished in the corresponding period in 1953 (as
 transmitted--Ed.),  During the first half of the year also, the five
 industrial ministries completed 52 percent of their output targets for
 this year.
 In the field of agriculture, this year's wheat yield exceeded last year's
 by over 20 percent and in most parts of the country rich summer harvests
 were gathered. Due to the heaviest rainfall in 200 years over a considerable
 area, however, this year's autumn harvests have been affected.
 In order to achieve continued success in economic construction, the
 PEOPLE'S DAILY outlines several measures to be taken.  Industrial output
 must be raised greatly in both quantity and quality.  This should be
 attained through improved management and administration, perfection of the
 responsibility system, expansion of the technical improvements and inno-
 vations campaign and other means.
 Energetic efforts should be made in t.e areas not affected by excessive
 surface water or flooding to raise the per hectare yield so as to make
 good the losses sustained in the affected areas.  Drainage) salvaging
 of young crops,, and replanting should be speedily carried out and more
 land put to high-yield late autumn crops in the lightly affected areas.
 Where replanting is impossible, side occupations should be promoted.

 "We absolutely should not be conceited or self-complacent just because
 of these achievements.  We must not only strive to transform our country
 from an agricultural country to an advanced Socialist industrialized
 country but keep up the bitter and difficult struggle.
 "The present concrete tasks are to strife for the over-all fulfillment
 and overfulfillment of the State 1954 plan and to perform well the follow-

 "1--Strive vigorously to increase production and to raise the quality
 of products.
 "In industry, the various organs should, on the basis of the conditions
 of supply, production, and sale, adopt concrete measures to energetically
 fulfill and overfulfill State plans.
 "In agriculture, the broad areas not affected by flood must strengthei

 1tln waterlogged areas, the water must be speedily cleared and young shoots
 'protected    and replanted; more high-yielding late autumn crops should
 be planted; and, in case of non-arable land, the peasants should aptly
 undertake side occupations.
 "2--Carry out intensively the Socialist transformation of agriculture, of
 the handicraft industry, and in the capitalist sector of industry and
 commerce, and develop their hidden potential to increase Socialist
 production.
 "3--Continue to expand the interflow of merchandise and stabilize the
 market.
 "Commercial enterprises of the State and cooperatives should conscientiously
 perform well and continue to strengthen the work of :planned purchase and
 planned supply.
 "Intensively organize the work of purchasing grain, industrial raw
 material, and supplementary food to insure smooth operation of industrial
 construction and production; and intensively organize the work of
 supplying means of production and materials for livelihood:to the
 peasants, and marketing the products of secondary occupation of the
 peasants.
 "4--Rigidly practice austerity, which is an important regular political
 duty of the people in the whole country.  This applies particularly to
 :food in this year,. because a part of the country affected by floods may
 not be able to fulfill its planned production targets.  Therefore the
 meaning of practicing austerity becomes significant.

 Describing the rapid progress in Chin,,.'s Socialist industrialization,
 Kuo Mo-jo says that the output of modern industry in 1953 accounted for
 31 percent of the total value of output of all industry and agriculture
 as against 17 percent in 1949.  In 1954, the output value of modern
 industry will be 18.3 percent higher than in 1953.
 By spring this year, there were already 95,000 agricultural producer
 cooperatives.. with a membership of over 1.7 million peasant households.
 Together with the members of mutual-aid teams, they made up about 60
 percent of all peasant households in China.  The mutual-aid and
 cooperative farming, the only road to common prosperity, is developing
 on the basis of land reform completed in 1952.
 Other achievements Kuo Mo-jo lists include the rapid advance in people's
 democracy and the great unity between the various nationalities.  By the
 end of May 1954, 58 national autonomous regions of and over county status
 were set up throughout the country.
 "Socialist construction and peace are indivisible," declares Kuo Mo-_o,
 "the large-scale construction on which we have embarked assuredly demands
 an atomsphere of lasting peace.  The Chinese people love peace.  Because
 we, the Chinese people love peace, we resolutely oppose aggression."
 He described how the American imperia"fists are shielding the traitorous
 Chiang Kai-shek clique on Taiwan and  sing this Chinese island to make
 harassing and destructive raids on China and to prepare for eltended
 armed aggression.  "To liberate Taiwan, to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek
 clique, is the sacred task of the Chinese people.  It is China's own
 internal affair.  We will tolerate no outside interference.  To liberate
 Taiwan is to defend the peace of Asia and the world," he stresses.

 (Text)
 Peking, Sept. 14--Commenting on the orders of the Government Administration
 Council on the planned purchase and supply of cotton cloth and planned pur-
 chase of cotton today, the PEOPLE'S DAILY says editorially that the
 measures aim to ensure all necessary supplies of cotton and cotton cloth,
 safeguard the State's-planned production and distribution of cotton
 cloth, and eliminate speculation and stabilize prices.
 The measures are taken because the growth in the consumer demands has
 distanced the swift rise in production of cotton and cotton cloth, the
 editorial points out.
 In the past few years, the output of both cotton and cotton cloth has
 been rapidly increasing.  But the purchasing power of the people has.
 been growing still more rapidly.  The editorial adds that the State at
 present still has ample stores of cloth, but measures have still to be
 taken in preparation for the future.
 The revolution has brought about the growth in people's purchasing power,
 particularly since 1953, when the country's large-4scale economic
 construction was launched, the paper states.  Following the development
 in the country's construction, the purchasing power of society will be
 raised still higher.  Fundamentally, the only way to solve the conflict
 between supply and consumption is to carry out Socialist industrialization.
 Referring to planned purchase and supply  of cotton cloth and planned
 purchase of cotton, the editorial says that there are many advantages
 in carrying out these measures.  First, the total supply of cloth by
 the State this year is expected to be more than last year's.  This
 amount of cloth, to be supplied by the State" according to plan, can
 entirely ensure the basic demand of the people.
