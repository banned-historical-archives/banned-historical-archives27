 Crime Crackdown in China
 China has undertaken a massive campaign against  crime  in
 which  thousands  of people have been  arrested and a  large number
 executed..   The crackdown stems from  the perception of Deng
 Xiaoping and other    senior  leaders  that there has  been a  breakdown
 in  social order  and discipline  that threatens  the party's rule.
 The  campaign reaches  beyond ordinary  crime  to social and
 political misbehavior  as well, particularly among youth.      Tough
 measures   taken by local law  enforcement and judicial ' authorities,
 have,  in many  cases,  gone  beyond  the bounds of due process  as
 mandated  under. China's  legal   system. Such actions have  created        25X1
 controversy within  the party and  government,  vitiated  the
 generally positive reaction.to the crackdown among the the  Dovulace
 Since last August, the authorities in China have been
 carrying out a harsh campaign against crime. and social
 disorder.   In the past few months thousands of persons, mostly
 youth, have been arrested in police sweeps through urban areas.
 Hundreds have been executed, often before massed audiences.   The
 crackdown is c.ontinuing--embassy.and consulate reporting

 la three-year campaign is planned.   Ordinary street
 crime is not the only target; people have also been arrested for
 crimes of a political nature and even for behavior which, while
 not illegal, the security authorities'find objectionable.   Some
 in the.party evidently have misgivings but editorials and
 speeches have firmly repudiated their objections.
 China's "Crime Wave"
 The severity of the campaign attests to the leadership's
 conviction that China is facing a. crisis situation that demands
 strong measures.   Reliable crime-statistics do not exist for
 China; however, in recent months the press has carried an
 unusually large number of stories about crimes.   While the media
 campaign,  it probably also reflects a real crime problem.
 Generally, crimes fall into one of three categories:             25X1
 economic crime--including corruption,  smuggling, profiteering;
 street crime--rape, murder, burglary; and crimes against social
 order.   The final category includes crimes like rioting, viewing
 or selling pornography, and disturbing the peace.  It also
 includes dissident activity, although this aspect is not
 discussed or admitted by the authorities.   The social disorder
 category is exceedingly broad, giving security authorities an
 excuse for clamping down on activities, such as wearing long hair
 or dancing  which the   dislike but which are not specifically        25X1
 criminal.
 As in other countries,  a disproportionate number of crimes
 are committed by the young.   China's high unemployment rate,
 inadequate schools, the drift to the cities from the countryside,
 and the maturing of a generation severely disillusioned by the
 Cultural Revolution and' its aftermath all combine to exacerbate
 youthful discontent.  Increasingly this discontent has found its
 outlet in criminal and antisocial behavior; many unemployed urban
 youth have turned to robber   Prostitution, extortion or other
 crimes for a living.                                                     25X1
 Motives Behind the Crackdown
 We believe the campaign stems from long simmering leadership
 discontent with social order and'the performance of the security
 services in China.   A number of stories as to what precipitated
 the crackdown are in circulation, ranging from an attack on Deng
 Xiaoping himself to impassioned pleas to the Politburo by crime
 victims.   Whatever the case,  it is clear that the campaign. was.
 begun at the highest levels of Chinese leadership and directed
 from the top down--Deng and Chen Yun are, as far as we know,'the
 leaders most directly responsible for the initiative.   They
 'apparently were convinced that criminal behavior was getting but
 of hand and that emergency measures were.needed.   The resultant

 crackdown exemplifies?the way in which China's decisionmaking
 structure concentrates authority not only over general policy but
 even over the details of Its im lementation in the hands of a
 very few elderly leaders.
 While the authorities acted in part out of sincere concern
 over criminal disorder, the. campaign is also driven by. the
 party's need to repress dissident thinking and by a distaste for
 youthful attitudes and fashions--"crimes of attitude"--
 combinedwith the puritanical moral outlook of the aged leaders.
 We surmise that the leadership saw the crime problem as evidence
 that it was losing control of Chinese society in fundamental
 ways, particularly as regards those under 30--about two-thirds of
 China's population.. The congruence of the anti-crime campaign
 with two other current campaigns--the rectification of the party
 broader aims of Beijing's policy.
 The anti crime campaign has also been used to strike at
 political dissidents, though Chinese officials deny this.   One
 case that attracted considerable attention was the arrest of
 several Tibetans whom the Dalai Lama claimed were dissidents who     25X1
 advocated greater autonomy from China.  The US embassy reports
 that dissidents are clearly subje t; to arrest  but has. no

 Propaganda has linked .the anticrime campaign with class

 especially noteworthy because the thrust of
 1981'has been that class stuggle is of limited significance in
 socialist China.   The language of these commentaries was
 extraordinarily harsh, reminiscent of the rhetoric of the

 Some cadre reportedly believe that the sudden crackdown on
 crime represents a slap in the face to Hu's policies, which
 favored addressing unemployment and youthful disillusionment--the

 causes of crime--as well as enforcement.   They see a loss of
 confidence in Hu on Deng's part, and a concomitant loss of .
 status, possibly even imperiling Hu's position.   A recent story
 crediting Hu with initiating the campaign has begun to circulate,
 perhaps indicating an attempt by Hu's.supporters to undercut this
 speculation and place Hu on the right side of the issue.
 Leading cadre at all  levels, even the very highest, have
 been affected by another aspect of the crime crackdown, the
 attack on criminal activities of cadres' children and
 relatives.   Delinquency by privileged youth has been.a major
 problem in China at least since the end of the Cultural
 Revolution.   In the latest crime drive, Deng Xiaoping has-warned
 that no one will be able to hide behind influential parents--         25X1
 though                              he warned the Ministry of Public
 Security off an investigation of his own children.  Relatives of
 several top military and civilian leaders have been implicated in     25X1
 criminal activity.  Even the Politburo Standin  Committee has
 been involved.   The US Embassy  has heard
 a grandson o   e  ianying was      25X1
 executed recently for plotting against Deng and that a nephew of
 1i Xiannian        ot, with his uncle's consent, for c0'rruption.
 25X1
 Attacks on cadres' relatives can be used as a weapon in
 factional  infighting.. At lower levels this tactic is common, and
 it has been employed at the national  level  as well.   Beijing will
 have a great deal of difficulty preventing this abuse in its
 drive against crime, but serious inability to prevent it will
 discredit the campaign,  heighten tensions already high because of
 rectification, and po   ibl   dilute the long-term effectiveness of
 the crime crackdown.
 China has carried.out periodic drives against crime and
 corruption since the Cultural Revolution, most notably in 1980
 and 1981, but none has been as large-scale and intense as the
 current one.   Information from thr    h  t China indicates its
 severity.   One estimate                              puts the number of     25X1
 executions at 5000 since.t a start of the campaign.   Fragmentary
 statistics, support high estimates:   for example, Embassy Beijing
 reports over 60 executions took place in that city during the
 first 20 days of January.   Several cadres have referred to arrest
 quotas--levied by Beijing--which local  security organizations
 have had trouble filling with genuine criminals.   In some cases
 they have taken to arresting people engaged in minor public
 disturbances or who make injudicious political remarks.
 Morever, security forces have used tough new tactics in
 carrying out the campaign.   Some.arrests have taken place in
 night-time dragnets; sometimes relatives are not informed for

 arrested more than 8000 people in September alone. Another wave
 of arrests was in progress in January according to consulate
 reporting.   A public security official  said that many arrests
 were made on the basis of lists submitted by local party
 secretaries.   In Fujian, because police are arresting suspicious
 looking youths, Chinese residents have observed that barber shops
 are full of local would-be dandies getting haircuts.
 .  Some Chinese have reported the campaign has strained
 security resources, overwhelmed detention facilities, and clogged
 the fledgling legal system.   According to a resident of Shanghai,
 PLA troops have been called on to assist in making arrests and
 guarding prisoners, even though this responsibility was
 supposedly taken from them and given to the resuscitated People's
 Armed Police last year.  In one area, according to a security
 cadre, police have been using athletic fields as emergency             25X1

 Executions are often carried out immediately after
 sentencing, and sometimes in front of large crowds.   A grim rumor
 has it that families of executed criminals must pay 80 yuan--more
 than the average worker's monthly wage--to recover the body.   The
 free hand granted security authorities has.also enabled them to
 take advantage of opportunities for corruption--some families are

 As part of the crackdown, tough sentences are being imposed
 for relatively minor crimes.   People have reportedly been        -
 executed for pimping, prostitution, and robbery,, while lesser
 crimes like pickpocketing and even disorderly conduct have earned
 transgressors exile to remote labor camps.   Mild sentences are
 being reviewed and strengthened by higher level courts;  in
 Zhejiang province, two criminals who appealed prison sentences of
 seven and five years were sentenced to death after a State
 Council order to stiffen punishments.   One law enforcement
 official claimed that under the*new policy, all nonpolitical

 There is considerable opposition within the party to the
 heavy-handed tactics of the campaign.   The leadership is
 particularly sensitive to the charge that it has abandoned its
 commitment to the rule of law.   In early December, Chen P'ixian,
 Secretariat member in charge of legal and security affairs,
 defended the crackdown in a speech to the China Law Society.
 Chen frankly discussed some of the criticisms aimed at the
 campaign.   He said there is a viewpoint that   the struggle has
 ruined overnight the newly established legal system" and that
 some people have labelled the campaign "feudalistic, vindictive
 punishment."   His counter-argument--that the campaign strengthens
 the legal system because it helps to maintain order and. because
 the people favored it--has been widely carried in the press.
 Some articles in the provincial press have criticized p
 members for harboring reservations about the crackdown.
 China has also reacted sharply in its international
 propaganda organs to foreign critics of the crackdown, which have
 included Amnesty International and the foreign minister of
 Sweden.  These replies have stressed two main points: that the
 problem is a Chinese one to be solved by Chinese in accordance
 with their own laws and traditions, and that all normal legal
 Costs of the Campaign

 many of the "crimes" involve urban youth and intellectuals, and
 since many of the security troops are drawn from uneducated
 unemployed youths,  increased social tensions seem to be built
 into the conduct of the campaign,.
 The nature of the crackdown,  its targets and its tactics,
 indicate that part of China's leadership is still hypersensitive
 to any perceived loss of control, suspicious of the young and
 their attitudes, and unwilling to confront or even acknowledge
 the deeper causes of declining social order.   The party's old
 guard still harks back to a golden age and is ready to use heavy-
 like--disciplined, committed. to revolution, puritanical.
