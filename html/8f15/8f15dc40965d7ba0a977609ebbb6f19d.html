 FOREWORD
 This study examines Chinese policy toward both the Soviet Union
 and the US in the critical period since 1968 when tl. 2 current contours
 of the Sino-Soviet-US triangle began to emerge. It focuses on the
 complex and interrelated problems of how ;'.:e domestic political
 struggle within China influenced the conduct 'f Chinese foreign
 policy and how changes in the international envir,,nment have shaped
 the course of Chinese domestic politics. While it s generally accepted
 that there is an intimate relationship between he domestic politics
 and foreign policy of modern nations, no study exists which system-
 atically investigates this difficult problem witn regard to Chinese
 politics and Chinese policy toward the two superpowers since 1968.
 Part I sets forth a series of general propositions and describes an
 experimental conceptual framework which is based largely on the
 "bureaucratic politics" approach to foreign policy analysis. Part II
 uses this hamework to reconstruct the Sino-Soviet crisis of 1969, a
 major turning point in Sino-Soviet relations nd in the transformation
 of Chinese policy toward the US. Part III ',,ruses on the relationship
 between foreign policy issues and the fall of Lin Piao and his sup-
 porters in 1971, another key event which  cared the way for further
 progress toward the normalization of Sine US relations. Part IV dis-
 cusses the prospects and implications for he US. The focus through-
 out is on the basic forces at work within Chinese politics which have
 been influential during the period of leadership by Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung, and which are likely to continue to shape China's domestic
 and foreign policies in a post-Mao era.
 It should be noted that this study is experimental and its judgments
 are often highly interpretive and speculative. While it attempts to
 synthesize a considerable amount of material, some of it only recently
 available, the study is not intended to be a definitive history of the
 subject. Indeed, on the basis of the evidence now available no defini-
 tive account is possible no matter what approach to the problem is
 taken. It is hoped that the study will stimulate thought and discussion
 of the issues involved among those concerned with the subject and
 lead to a re-examination (using this and other research approaches)
 of the critical areas of disagreement which emerge.

 PRINCIPAL JUDGMENTS
 From the time that an opening to the US was first seriously con-
 sidered as a policy option in Peking in 1968, this question and the
 related question of the proper stance toward the Soviet Union, have
 been bitterly divisive issues within the Chinese leadership. Indeed,
 a protracted, disruptive, and ultimately violent realignment of domestic
 political power within China was necessary before what came to be
 called "Mao's revolutionary line in foreign policy" could be imple-
 mented.
 During this process of realignment, there were two events which
 marked major turning points: the Sino-Soviet border crisis of 1969
 and the internal upheaval that led to the fall of Defense Minister Lin
 Piao and most of China's top central military leaders in September
 1971. During the first of these, Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier
 Chou En-lai resorted to provoking a serious crisis with the USSR
 primarily in order to influence the course of the struggle for power
 within China and the overall direction of China's foreign policy.
 During the second, Lin and his supporters attempted to seize power
 rather than accept the transformation of China's domestic and foreign
 policy that was underway in 1971. While the 1969 crisis did not im-
 mediately halt the march toward increased influence and power of
 Lin and his supporters, it did slow it to some degree, as well as
 provide a powerful rationale for future steps to improve Sino-US
 relations. And while the fall of Lin Piao did not end the power and
 influence of the military in Chinese politics, it did diminish it enough
 both to clear the way for progress in Sino-US relations and to reorder
 China's priorities in the key areas of military expenditures and eco-
 nomic modernization.
 A reconsideration of these events and of the course of subsequent
 Chinese policy suggests the following insights into the patterns of
 interaction between domestic politics and foreign policy in China.
 The intensity of the struggle within China's leadership over policy
 toward the Soviet Union and the US reflects the f uct that foreign
 policy issues have become intimately bound up with a number of
 closely related domestic policy issues; these include the central problem
 1

 Approved For Release 2008/11/06: CIA-RDP86T00608R000600170030-6
 of the proper strategy for enhancing China's power and prestige and
 the closely linked problem of resource allocation. Even more basically,
 the contention over foreign policy mirrors a struggle for political domi-
 nance within China.
 ? Lin and elements within the military opposed the opening to
 the US precisely because of what it implied in terms of resource
 allocation and what that meant in terms of their influence a.-]
 power. The increased sense of security that would grow out of
 improved relations with the US, they reasoned quite correctly,
 would lead to pressures for smaller military expenditures.
 ? They also saw that improved Sino-US relations would lead to
 an expansion of the influence of their principal rival, Chou En-
 lai's moderate coalition, a group that both favored this line in
 foreign policy and stressed economic modernization rather than
 military strength as the most effective means of enhancing China's
 status and power in the world.
 ? Following Lin's fall, China's scarce resources were allocated
 away from defense expenditures and toward economic develop-
 ment, and Chou and his allies in the moderate coalition accel-
 erated their march toward the strong position they now hold
 in Chinese politics.
 Tension in Sino-Soviet relations is in large measure a function of
 the intensity of the internal power struggle within Peking.
 o The March 1969 crisis, the most serious in the history of Sino-
 Soviet relations, was an outgrowth of the jockeying for power
 and related debates over foreign policy that preceded the Ninth
 Party Congress (April 1969).
 ? Immediately following Lin's abortive 1971 coup, the civilian
 leadership deliberately and systematically exaggerated the
 threat of war with the Soviet Union to create a crisis atmosphere
 conducive to party unity (luring a purge of pro-Lin military
 figures.
 ? A similar escalation of expressed Chinese fears of a Soviet attack
 came in conjunction with China's Tenth Party Congress in 1973,
 when foreign policy issues re-emerged as a central element in
 the intenial power struggle.
 ? Overall, tension in Sino-Soviet relations has declined since 1969,
 because the extension of control by the moderate coalition has
 produced a somewhat more stable internal situation and because

 Approved For Release 2008/11/06: CIA-RDP86T00608R000600170030-6
 the implementation of the moderates' foreign policy program
 has resulted in a lessened sense of international isolation and a
 decreaF-d feeling of vulnerability to the Soviet threat.
 ? Nevertheless, should there be a serious future challenge to the
 moderate policy coalition, its leaders would be inclined to use
 additional provocative acts against the Soviets or an anti-Soviet
 propaganda campaign in order to exaggerate the external threat
 for domestic political purposes.
 Just as the internal power struggle has affected China's external
 actions and policies, so changes in the external environment have had
 an important impoct on the course of China's internal politics.
 ? The escalation of the Vietnam war undercut a trend toward
 flexibility in China's foreign policy that had emerged in 1964
 and 1965, and thereby set the stage for the xenophobic foreign
 policy of the Cultural Revolution.
 ? Numerous events in 1968-the first indications of a possible
 US disengagement from Indochina, the Soviet invasion of Czech-
 oslovakia, and the election of a new administration in Wash-
 ington-allowed moderates in China to argue that the inter-
 national situation required steps toward decreasing tension with
 the US.
 ? Chinese uncertainty about the direction of US policy in Indo-
 china during 1970 and 1971 gave ammunition to the opponents
 of an opening to the US and at one point the entire thrust of
 this policy was called into question.
 ? The Nixon-Brezhnev summit meeting of 1973 and certain con-
 comitant Soviet moves led to an intense internal debate within
 China and renewed pressure on the moderates to alter China's
 policy toward the US.
 Future changes in the external environment in general and US
 policy in particular are likely to have an important impact not only on
 Chinese foreign policy but also on the course of politics within China.
 ? Any rapid or significant progress in Soviet-US relations unless
 counterbalanced by offsetting US moves toward Peking would
 lead to renewed debate within China over the wisdom of the
 present course in foreign and domestic policy.
 ? A US action such as the establishment of full diplomatic rela-
 tions with Peking could paradoxically lead to a further lessening
 of Sino-Soviet tension since this would probably strengthen the

 moderates' hold on power, decrease their need to play up the
 Soviet threat, and generally decrease Chinese frustrations re-
 garding their nation's influence and recognition in the interna-
 tional hierarchy.
 ? At the same time, full normalization of Sino-US relations would
 probably strengthen the moderates enough to allow them to
 imp!.ment pragmatic policies which could considerably expand
 economic and other ties with the US and non-Communist coun-
 tries generally. Expanded Chinese relations with the US would
 by themselves sustain a certain level of tension in Sino-Soviet
 relations, as would the continuing competition of the two Com-
 munist powers for influence in Asia and elsewhere. To the degree
 that expanded ties with the US provided additional technology
 and greater resources which could be used to strengthen Chinese
 military capabilities, these developments could over time de-
 crease the differences between the civilian moderates and some
 elements of the military, thus producing a more stable leader-
 ship coalition in China with a vested interest in maintaining good
 relations with the US.

 THE DISCUSSION
 1. INTRODUCTION: ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK
 AND METHODOLOGY
 OVERVIEW
 The opportunities and risks to the US in its
 dealings with the USSR and China are heavily
 eond:ticncd by the quality of relations between
 the two Communist powers. Thus the prospects
 for war, conciliation, or continued tension between
 the two is one of the most critical issues facing
 US foreign policy. It is at the same time one of the
 most complex analytical problems facing the In-
 telligence Community. The purpose of this intro-
 duction is to elaborate a system tic conceptual
 framework for interpreting the relationship between
 Chinese politics and Chinese policy toward the
 USSR and the US. The major goal is to identify
 the basic patterns of Chinese politics, as they im-
 pact on foreign policy, that would be likely to
 endure in a post-bfao, post-Chou era.
 At the core of this framework is the observation
 that while all Chinese leaders are acutely conscious
 of the need to enhance their nation's status and
 power in world affairs, there has been serious and
 protracted dissension over the optimum cluster of
 domestic, economic, defense, and foreign policies
 to pursue in order to do so. The basic assumption
 is that these clusters, or policy alternatives, arc
 supported by Chinese leaders representing bureau-
 crc: irall y-based policy coalitions, and that the con-
 tention for power and influence among these coali-
 tions has shaved and is likely to continue to shape
 the course of Chinese politics and foreign policy.
 This framework and the subsequent analysis in
 this study reflect what has come to be called the
 "bureauc,atic politics" approach to foreign policy
 analysis. It views the Chinese government not as
 a rational monolith which makes foreign policy
 decisions designed solely to optimize Chinese na-
 tional interests, but rather as a number o  com-
 peting "players"; foreign policy is the political
 outcome of the interplay and infighting among
 these players, each of which tends to interpret the
 national interest in terms of its own factional
 interests.

 A. Status Sensitivity
 Partly because of rational balance-of-power cal-
 culations and partly because of the sensitivity of
 leaders in Peking about China's status as a world
 power, fear of Soviet domination has long been the
 central issue of Chinese foreign policy and a key
 to the dynamics of Chinese politics generally.
 Chinese concern about an intolerable inconsistei,cv
 between their own image of their proper role and
 their actual ability to influence world politics
 expl ns in good measure the de.ision to break
 the bonds of economic and military dependet.cy
 on the USSR of the 19.50s.? Indeed, the final break
 in Sino-Soviet relations came in the early 1960s
 when the Soviets refused to continue their aid to
 China in developing its own nuclear weapons, the
 single most convincing symbol  of great power
 s' atus, and when the Soviets publicized the size
 'There is obviously a wide g^' between China's military
 anu industrial achievements-relatively meager as comp'red
 with the USSR and the US-and the massive size of its
 territory ar,d population. This disparity, and the historical,
 cultural, and ideological mind set which in the past made
 the Chinese think of themselves as the "central" or the
 "middle kingdom" of the world, account for China's ex-
 treme sensitivity over its "status inconsi-tent" position in
 world affLirs. The concept of status inconsistency was first
 developed by soci? logists working in the field of social
 stratification to explain  individual and group behavior
 within a society. According to the classic definition by
 Mix Websr (Essays in Sociology, Oxford University Press,
 1946), stctus goes beyond objective measures of achievement
 and pow--r into such subjective areas as acceptance by key
 groups within society. Further, if the individual's perceptions
 of his own achievement and status do not correspond to the
 status ascribed to him by society, he is in a "status in-
 consistent" position. W'he-t situations occur which emphasize
 the rap, the individual's psychological stress can cause
 aggressive behavior.
 In recent years, a small body of theoretical literature
 in "interr,,,tional stratification" has carried the status in-
 consistency theme into relations among nations. For example,
 Johan Caltung  ("A Structural  Them y of Aggression,"
 Journal (, ' Peace Research, 1964, pp. 95-119) interprets
 Germany's behavior before World War I in terms of the
 gap between its military and industrial capability and
 its perception of denied prestige as measured by the pos-
 session of a large overseas empire. The most comprehensive
 book ?,n the subject is Michael David Wallace, War and
 Rank Among Nations (1973).

 of China's debt for economic aid, an act which
 infuriated the Chinese because it demean,d their
 status and flaunted before world opinion their
 dependence on the Soviet Union.
 Since then, most Chinese decision makers have
 remained acutely concerned about the need to
 reduce the power advantage held by the USSR,
 in order both to relieve the threat of Soviet pressure
 and to enhance China's authority as a world power.
 There has, ho%-ever, been bitter conte-ition among
 Chinese leaders over the optimum cluster of po-
 litical, economic, defense, and foreign policies to
 pursue to achieve these ends.
 B. Policy Clusters .:nd Coalitions
 For analytical purposes, three alternative policy
 clusters can be identified, and for e ach of these,
 a policy coalition, which seeks to promote the ele-
 ments of the cluster not only to influence policy
 but also to contend for political power. These
 p,Aicy cl,isters and  coaiitions, though obviously
 simplified for analytical purposes, are nonetheless
 believed to be reasonably accurate in their repre-
 sentation of the basic general ten3encies in the
 complex Chinese political sc_uc. Indeed, much of
 the course of Chinese politics since 1968 can be
 explained by reference to the struggle for power
 ar.d influence among the coalitions.`
 'There is increasing  recognition  among  specialists  in
 Chinese affairs that a new and systematic analytical frame-
 work is needed. On this point Professors Michel Oksenberg
 and Steven Goldstein argue in the March-April 1975 issue
 of Problems of Cwmmunism that the study of Chinese poli-
 tics is at a "cr iseroads," and that "the governing models
 of the past . . . have been tested and found wanting." In
 their article, "The Chinese Political Spectrum," Problems of
 Communism, March-April  1974, Oksenberg and Goldstein
 present a  new  a salytical  frarne?.vor!.  which focuses  on
 'opinion clusters'  in Chinese intellectual history as they
 relate  to  the questions of how China should respond to
 the West and the challenge of economic modernization.
 In contrast to Oksenberg-Goldstein, another new approach
 developed by Michael Pillsbury of the RAND Corporation
 focuses not on ideas or issues, but rather on the patterns
 of Chinese power struggles  ("ratterns of e'linese Power
 Struggle.: Three Models," a paper presented at the Uni-
 versity Seminar on Modern China, Columbia University,
 1974).
 The framework presented in this paper draws on elements
 of both of these approaches, accepting  the idea that
 "clusters" exist, but trying to  ink them to the dynamics
 of the internal power struggle, especially at the nexus
 where domestic politics and foreign policy interact.
 - Policy Cluster I, the radical alternative, is in-
 ward look=ng and visionary. It seeks to enhance
 China's status and power by creating an ideo-
 logically pure nation that would be self-reliant
 economically (i.e., revolutionary spirit would
 increase production and overcome all -)bstacles
 to de%elopment) and would gain influence
 on the world scene through example (and
 through supporting revolutionary movements
 elsewhere ). It is inclined toward isolationist
 views and is vehemently anti-Soviet and anti-
 US. It has a strong bias against "experts" and
 believes in "polit  - in command." The primary
 bureaucratic base  ' support for this cluster
 is the "radical" wing of the Chinese Commu-
 nist Party.
 - Policy Cluster II, the moderate alternative, is
 by contrast outward looking and relatively
 pragmatic. It seeks to enhance China's power
 and status through a combination of diplomacy
 and economic modernization. It is less con-
 cerned with ideology and makes diplomatic
 calculations in terms of their consequences
 for the global balance of n over, an approach
 which led it to favor an opening to the US
 as a counterweight to Soviet power. While
 it opposes reconciliation with the Soviets. it
 does so primarily for reasons of state-to-state
 rivalry rather than for ideological  reasons.
 This cluster's modernization strategy relies
 heavily on the importation of Western tech-
 nology, places a heavy emphasis on "experts"
 and reverses the radical slogan      putting
 eccnomics ratl?cr than politics in `ommand.
 Because of its heavy emphasis on economic
 developnu'nt, the moderate alternative favors
 the relatively inexpensive military strategy of
 relying on an "aroused populace" rather than
 heavy expenditures on military technology to
 meet the  Soviet threat; it uses the added
 argument that improved relations with the
 US would further enhance China's national
 security, thus diminishing the need for heavy
 expenditures in the area of advanced weapons
 technology. The primary base of support for
 this cluster is in the civilian bureaucracies,
 especially those concerned with economic af-
 fai,s and foreign policy.

 HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
 The 1950s: The Rajected Alternative
 During most of the 1950s Chino followed the general policy of allying and
 working with the Sov,dt Union to further the goal of advancing the interests of the
 communist bloc against the forces of "imperialism" in general and the United
 States in particular. To enhance China's economic and military capabilities, Peking
 relied on the importation of technology from the Soviet Union and accepted grante?
 and longterm loans to finance their economic modernization. Militarily, they
 relied on the Soviet nuclear umbrella and the importation of advanced Soviet
 weaponry such as jet aircraft.
 1958-1961: The Radical Alternative
 In the late 1950s, the Chinese became increasingly dissatisfied with their
 status in the world communist movement, and increasingly restive to assert their
 own ideological leadership against the Soviets. They we P also acutely conscious
 of their exclusion from the thermonuclear club of great powers, and of their slow
 pace of economic development under Soviet hitelage.
 The Chinese, therefore, embarked on a course of action which reflected many
 of the elements of the radical alternative, (that is, Policy Cluster U. By launching
 the Great Leap Forward, a massive effort to further the industrial strength of Ch'na
 by stirring up the revolutionary spirit of the masses, they aimed toward becoming
 economically "self-reliant."
 After two years of frenzied effort, the failure of the Great Leap was increasingly
 apparent. Nevertheless, during this period the Chinese had rejected the centralized
 Soviet model for the development of their economy and had laid the groundwork
 for a completcfbreak with the Soviets in other areas.
 1962-1965: The Moderate Alternative Foreshadowed
 During this period the break with the Soviets became final, and elements of
 Policy Cluster II carne to the fore though many of the tendencies of the radical
 alternative in the foreign policy area continued. The extremes of the Great Leap
 were abandoned and a more pragmatic economic course was set which emphasized
 realizable goals. Foreign trade was also increased, and in 1963 and 1964, the
 Chinese went so far as to negotiate for the purchases of whole plants from Japan
 and Western Europe. Concomitantly, steps were taken to establish or improve
 relations with ceitain non-communist nations.
 1965-1958: The Radical Alternative
 Before the elements of the moderate alternative could become established,
 the external setting was altered by the increases in international tension that
 accompanied the escalation of the Vietnam war. China's early efforts to expand
 ties with Japan and Western Europe ran into serious trouble, and the moderates
 who had favored this opening were discredited. Frustrated in this early attempt
 to enhance China's status through increased international intercourse, and
 fearful that even if successful, the opening to the West would lead to a decline
 in revolutionary elan. Mao and the radicals launched the Great Proletarian
 Revolution, a movement which in its foreign policy dimension carried the radical
 alternative io the extreme of cutting off virtually all forms of traditional intercourse
 with the international community. An intense xenophobic isolationism characterized
 Chinese policy and both the US and the Soviets were condemned with equal fervor.
 1968-1975: A Realignment of Domestic Political Power
 1968: Numerous events in the external setting-first indications of 'JS
 disengagement from Indochina, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the election
 of a new administration in Washington-allowed the moderates to take the first
 steps toward improved relations with the US.
 1962- In February these early steps toward the US were reversed by a
 coalition of the military and radicals. In March, with Mao's support, the moderates
 took the drastic step of provoking a serious Sino.Soviet crisis in an attempt to
 regain the initiative in the internal power struggle and to pro :rte a powerful
 rationale for the opening to the US.
 1970-1971: While the 1969 crisis slowed their advance, the military coalition
 maneuvered toward an ascendant position.  The moderate coalition and Mao
 continued to push for improved relations with the US and resisted advocates of
 ameliorating tension with the USSR. Rather than accept the transformation of
 policy underway in 1971, the military coalition under the leadership of Defense
 Minister Lin Piao attempted a coup against Mao and the moderates, and the
 struggle between moderates and the military reached a crisis stage resulting
 not only in the fall of Lin but also in a massive purge of China's top military leaders.
 1971-Present: The fall of Lin Piao was a clear-cut victory for Premier Chou
 En?laf and the moderates. They therefore moved over the next few years to imple.
 ment both their domestic and foreign policy programs. Diplomatically, they ccn?
 tinued to place great emphasis on improved relations with the West, receiving
 President Nixon in early 1972, and normalizing state-to-state relations with a
 growing number of countries including Japan and West Germany. In the economic
 field, new emphasis began to be put on developing scientific and technical expertise
 and importing Western technology and tec,.nological knowledge, and beginning
 in late 1972, there was a major drive to import whole manufacturing plants from
 the West. During 1973 contracts were signed for over one billion dollars of plant
 technology, over ten times the amount contracted for in any given pre-Cultural
 Revolution year.
 While the Fcurth National People's Congress held in early 1975 was generally
 dominated by the. moderates, advocates of the , dical and military alternative;
 still retain powerful positions and the contention tL '.)ower within China continues.

 - Policy Cluster III, the military alternative, is
 essentially non-ideological. Its general goal is
 to enhance China's position by increasing
 China's military capabilities, especially in the
 field of advanced weapons technology. It
 opposes the opening to the US not only because
 it doubts the US can be an effective counter-
 balance against Moscow, but also because
 it fears that Soviet-US "collusion," especially
 in the area of strategic arms limitation, could
 pose a serious threat to China's national se-
 curity. Its advocates, therefore, reject the basic
 premise of the moderates that improved rela-
 tions with the US enhance China's national
 security, and deeply resent their tendency to
 sacrifice expenditures on military technology
 in order to rechannel them toward general
 economic development. Supporters of the mili-
 tary alternative generally feel that it would
 be far more prudent to decrease tension with
 Moscow to some degree while continuing to
 make the development of a credible nuclear
 deterrent a first priority. This alternative is
 advocated primarily by elements in the mili-
 tary establishment, especially the air force and
 other components heavily dependent upon
 advanced technology.
 The chart on page 7 summarizes the main
 points of the three status and power alternatives
 outlined above, indicates the bureaucratic base of
 support for each alternative, compares them with
 the rejected alternative of close ties with the Soviet
 Union, and shows how each alternative views rela-
 tions with the US. It also provides an overview of
 the periods within recent Chinese history when
 each cluster has been partially dominant, dominant,
 or in contention for dominance.
 C. Methodology: A "Bureaucratic Politics"
 Approach
 The framework outlined above and the subse-
 quent analysis in this study draw heavily on the
 insights of the "bureaucratic politics" approach to
 foreign policy analysis. In the terms used by Gra-
 ham Allison in his Essence of Decision, it views

 the Chinese government not as a "unitary rational
 actor" that makes foreign policy decisions solely
 through objective calculation of the best way to
 optimize national interests, but rather as a num-
 ber of competing "players" who contend for power
 and influence and use foreign policy as well
 as other issues during this struggle. Power is "frac-
 tionated" rather than unitary, and any given action
 is the outcome of the interplay and infighting
 among the players rather than the result of a strictly
 rational and non-partisan assessment of national
 interests. Each player becomes involved in conten-
 tion over precisely what "national interests" de-
 mand, and each tends to define such interests in
 terms of his own individual political goals and
 the organization or faction he represents. Indeed,
 solutions to problems seldom follow from a de-
 tached and cool assessment of the alternatives;
 deadlines, events, and crises force players to take
 stands and defend them. In Allison's terms, this
 describes the "bureaucratic politics" model of for-
 eign policy analysis.* The chart on page 9 com-
 pares the two models and shows how the dif-
 ferent approaches pose different questions, follow
 different patterns of inference and explanation, and
 thereby tend to result in different predictions about
 future actions.
 In terms of research techniques, therc is in fact
 no basic difference between working with the clas-
 sical unitary actor framework and the more com-
 plicated bureaucratic politics model. In both ap-
 proaches, the analyst uses the best evidence avail-
 able and then attempts to reconstruct the views
 of the decisionmakers whose actions or policies he
 is trying to understand. The difference is that in
 one case the analyst assumes that all decision-
 makers deliberate and act as one with solely the
 best interest of the state in mind, whereas in the
 other case he assumes that there exists a group
 of decisionmakers who are contending for power
 and influence and who often act against one an-
 other to enhance their own personal position even
 'Readers familiar with Allison's approach will be aware
 that what is described above are his "Model I" and "Model
 Ill." While elements of Model II, the Organizational
 Process Model, are reflected in the analysis that follows,
 the primary emphasis is on showing how a variation on his
 Model III can be used to illuminate a set of complex intel-
 ligence problems.
 in some cases at the expense of what others may
 strongly believe are the best interests of the state.
 In one case, the analyst imaginatively reconstructs
 "China's" best interests; whereas in the other case,
 he attempts to reconstruct the goals, aspirations,
 and tactics of each of the participants in the internal
 debate over what China's best interests are at any
 given point.*
 D. The Players
 The first requirement of the bureaucratic politics
 approach is to identify the key players in the po-
 litical struggle and to specify which of the three
 policy alternatives outlined above each generally
 advocated. Before doing so, however, it is important
 to note that each policy cluster represents a gen-
 eral tendency, or, as the nomenclature implies, a
 cluster of tendencies rather than a dogmatic or
 clearly defined program of action. No individual
 Chinese leader adheres without deviation to all
 the tenets of any specific cluster, and individuals
 who generally support one tendency may over
 time come to alter their views and swing toward
 another alternative. With this caveat in mind, we
 can say that the principal leader of the moderate
 coalition was Premier Chou En-lai, that the radicals
 were represented by Chiang Ching and Yao Wen-
 yuan, both of whom had risen to prominence dur-
 ing the Cultural Revolution, and that the military
 coalition was headed by Defense Minister Lin
 Piao. * *
 'This process is what historian-philosopher R. G. Colling-
 wood called the "historical imagination"; Stanley Hoffmann
 calls the same process "imaginative reconstruction," Thomas
 Schelling speaks of "vicarious problem solving," and Hans
 Morgenthau uses the term, "rational re-enactment." Col-
 lingwood was addressing the fundamental epistemological
 question of how we know what we know about social and
 historical reality; Hoffmann, Schelling, and Morgenthau
 are addressing how we know and judge the behavior of
 national leaders involved in the foreign policy decision-
 making process.
 *'While Lin had worked closely with the radicals during
 the Cultural Revolution, his identification with their goals
 and policies appears in retrospect to have been largely
 opportunistic. A Chinese official interpreting this early
 period recently observed that Lin "had tagged along with
 the left wing in the late 1960s and had gone along with
 many of their policies," but that he was not in fact a
 "leader of the leftists."

 II. TURNING POINT: THE 1969 CRISIS IN
 SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS
 OVERVIEW
 On 2 March 1969 an unusual incident occurred
 on the frozen Ussuri river near the desolate island
 which the Chinese call Chen-pao and the Soviets
 call Damansky. On numerous occasions since the
 early 1960s, there had been periodic non-shooting
 skirmishes in this and other areas along the disputed
 Sino-Soviet border. On 2 March 1969, for the first
 time, Chinese soldiers opened fire on a Soviet
 patrol, killing 7 Soviet soldiers and wounding 23.
 On 15 March, the Soviets retaliated with a full
 scale military engagement in the same area during
 which hundreds of troops on both sides were killed
 and injured. Following these conventional military
 exchanges, Soviet spokesmen hinted in a number of
 forums that a nuclear attack on China might be-
 come necessary. By August 1969, the situation had
 deteriorated so badly that some Western observers
 were convinced that war was inevitable in the
 near term.
 Traauwnal explanations of this incident focus
 either on the territorial goals of China in initiating
 the crisis, or argue that Mao wanted to so embitter
 the Chinese people against the Soviets that they
 would never again be tempted to accept the Soviet
 "revisionist" road. The argument below presents
 an alternative explanation: it attempts to show that
 the origins of the crisis lie in the struggle within
 China for power and influence prior to the April
 Ninth Party Congress, and in changes in the ex-
 ternal setting during 1968 which opened the way
 for a basic shift in Chinese foreign policy.
 For some years prior to the crisis, the radical
 coalition had been dominant in China. During 1968,
 however, a number of events, including the opening
 of the Paris peace talks and the Soviet invasion of
 Czechoslovakia, gave the leaders of the moderate
 coalition the chance to argue for a shift in Chinese
 policy toward an opening to the US. In the fall
 of 1968, basic decisions were made to move in
 this direction by Mao and Chou, but these were

 apparently reversed in mid-February 1969 because
 of opposition from the radicals and elements of the
 military.
 At least in part in order to regain the domestic
 political initiative, Mao and Chou decided to
 sharply increase tension with the Soviet Union by
 provoking a bc, der clash-the critical 2 March
 incident at Chen-pan island. Despite continued op-
 position by the military and the radicals, by the
 end of 1969 the moderate coalition, with Mao's
 approval, had succeeded in using the Soviet threat
 to justify and implement the steps toward an open-
 ing to the US which had been prevented in Feb-
 ruary.
 A. Traditional Explanations
 While the possibility exists that the 2 March
 incident was an accident, the weight of the evidence
 suggests that, at a minimum, the Chinese ordered
 a change in operating procedures which led to the
 clash.*
 The question is, why was a decision made to
 embark on this high risk procedure at a time when
 the country was still very weak internally and
 isolated diplomatically? The most comprehensive
 *Prior to 1973, only the Soviets had given n detailed
 version of the events of 2 March. During the heightened
 tension in Sino-Soviet relations in  1973, however, the
 Chinese decided to get their own version into the record.
 They invited the pro-Chinese journalist Neville Maxwell
 to visit the border area in June, and had him briefed by
 the People's Liberation Army (PLA) officer who was in
 charge of the patrol involved in the fighting. Even allow-
 ing for the self-serving nature of the Chinese story, the
 account adds some important new details. The most im-
 portant of these is the assertion that following some Feb-
 ruary pushing incidents, a change in patrolling procedures
 was ordered which provided for a concealed Chinese armed
 patrol to parallel the regular one and come to its aid if
 the Soviets repeated their previous bullying tactics. This
 was done, and when shots were fired on 2 March 1969,
 the shadow patrol stepped out of its concealed position and
 opened fire. Whether or not one accepts the Chinese claim
 that the Soviets troops fired first, the fact remains that
 a change in procedures was ordered by the Chinese which
 made an armed clash far more probable, and that this must
 have been recognized by the Chinese authorities that ordered
 t):e change. For a full account, see Neville Maxwell, "The
 Chinese Account of the  1989 Fighting at Chen-pao,"
 China Quarterly, October-December 1973, pp. 730-739.
 intelligence study of the subject offers the follow-
 ing explanation:
 Mao's purpose wi..; not to attain it victory for internal
 use or to blacken the Soviet image internationally, but
 rather to assert his claim to the island. In wiping out a
 Soviet border guard detachment, he gambled that the
 Russians would not escalate either by launching a big
 ground-force or conventional air attack or by attacking
 with nuclears. He apparently hoped that the Russians
 would not respond at all militarily because the Chinese
 claim to Chen-pao was so clearcut and had been
 implicitly conceded in the 1364 talks.*
 Another motive, according to this interpretation,
 was to warn the Soviet Union that China could not
 be pushed around.
 The only other detailed study of the 1969 clash,
 a RAND Memorandum by Thomas W. Robinson,
 offers a variety of other possible explanations. The
 one he appears to be most comfortable with "pre-
 sumes that Mao was in full control of politics in
 China," and that the Chairman "hoped that perma-
 nent national hatred for the Russians would follow
 a serious military clash," thus immunizing China
 against the virus of "Soviet revisionism." * *
 As to the first of these interpretations, the Chinese
 certainly had good historical claims to Chen-pao.
 But while this might account for why that par-
 ticular location was chosen for the clash, it does
 not explain why China's leaders would want to
 concern themselves with relatively minor territorial
 issues at a time when they were preoccupied with
 the far more serious business of preparing for a
 party congress. Moreover, during the history of the
 border negotiations China's actual territorial claims
 have repeatedly appeared to be less important than
 the general goal of maintaining tension in Sino-
 Soviet relations. Chen-pao, a desolate, scarcely in-
 habitable swamp of an island totally lacking in
 military or economic value, would hardly seem
 worth asserting a territorial claim to at the risk of
 a Soviet retaliation of unpredictable magnitude. And

 if the Chinese wanted to warn the Soviets that they
 could not be pushed around, they certainly failed
 since the Soviet initiated clash of 15 March proved
 exactly the opposite.
 As to Robinson's argument, there is little doubt
 that the domestic impact of the incident was a
 major consideration in Man's calculations. But this
 explanation fails to depict the context realistically.
 Why, for example, should Mao time such an action
 in 1969 when, in the aftermath of the Cultural
 Revolution, the spread of Soviet revisionism was no
 longer a pressing issue?
 In short, both explanations see Mao as making
 a critical decision in virtual isolation from the con-
 straints of either domestic or international politics.
 In contrast, the present reconstruction of the crisis
 attempts to link it both to the ongoing domestic po-
 litical struggle within China and to changes in the
 global setting which occurred in 1965 and 1969.
 B. The Internal Setting
 In the period that preceded the 1969 Sino-Soviet
 crisis, China had just begun to emerge from the
 throes of the Cultural Revolution. Both the party
 organi;rations and the govcrnnu'ntal ~urcaucracy
 had i;evn severely weakened by that domestic up-
 heaval, and the military establishment had been
 brought in to fill the resultant power vacutun. As
 Minister of Defense, Lin Piao was in charge of the
 single most powerful bureaucracy in China, even
 if it was not fully under his control. After having
 pleased Chairman Mao by working closely with
 his wife Chiang Ching and other "radical" elements
 during the most violent phase of the Cultural Revo-
 lution, Lin in 1965 and 1969 used the army to re-

 establish order and dissolve the Red Guards, a
 decision that must have pleased moderate elements
 in the army and displeased radical elements in the
 party. The overall effect, however, was to greatly
 enhance the influence and power of Lin and the
 military coalition.
 While Premier Chou En-L,i undoubtedly saw
 the restoration of order as a step in the right di-
 rection, he and his moderate coalition were none-
 theless clearly fighting an uphill battle against their
 opponents. In the jockeying for power that occurred
 in the year or so prior to the Ninth Party Congress
 in April 1969, Chou often took the offensive and
 was able to influence key decisions, but the outcome
 of the Congress shows that he and other moderates
 were in a precarious position and that Lin and his
 allies were expanding their influence and strength
 at the expense of the moderates and the radicals
 alike.* The new Politburo, writes A. Doak Barnett,
 emerged from "a chaotic  situation  of violent
 struggle' which saw a purge of party leaders
 "wholly unprecedented" in the history of Commu-
 nist China.**
 C. Foreign Policy Differences
 In terms of foreign policy, there were major
 differences among the three key players who were
 seeking to influence Mao. In the first half of 1968,
 Mao, Chiang Ching, and Lin Piao were all in agree-
 ment with the dominant tendency of the period, the
 radical alternative. Among the top elite Chou En-
 lai was the only major dissenter from the radical
 cluster and the principal advocate of the moderate
 alternative. While he had reluctantly accommo-
 dated himself to the isolationist tendencies of the
 Cultural Revolution period, he almost certainly
 was searching for some lever to alter the basic
 lines of Chinese policy.
 It was not the first time Chou had found him-
 self trying to turn the direction of policy away
 from the extremes of xe.iophobic self-reliance. In
 fact, in the early 1960s, he had engineered an alter-
 native both to the over-dependence on the Soviet
 Union of the 1950s and to the excessive self-reliance
 of the Great Leap Forward (1958-60). To a degree
 far greater than is generally recognized, Chou set
 a foreign policy course in 1963 and 1964 which
 foreshadowed the opening to the West of the 1970s.
 His policy-which was  explicitly endorsed by
 Mao-was to compensate for the final break in
 Sino-Soviet relations by making an opening to "the
 second intermediate zone," that is, Western Europe
 and Japan, and to follow this with the importation
 of Western technology for the modernization of
 China's economy. He accepted the need for China
 to develop its own nuclear force to face the Soviet
 military threat, but he realized that this would
 hLve to be supplemented by diplomacy and eco-
 nomic modernization.*
 At the outset, Chou was remarkably successful.
 Relations were normalized with France, talks with
 West Germany were initiated, and there was prog-
 ress toward normalizing relations with Japan. Chi-
 nese negotiators opened talks with West German
 businessmen for the purchase of a steel rolling
 factory, and a deal was completed with the Japa-
 nese for a vinylon plant. China exchanged journa-
 lists with West Germany and Japan, and trade
 offices  were  exchanged  between  Peking  and
 Tokyo. * *
 By late 1984, however, Chou's opening to the
 West began to encounter increasing difficulties,
 primarily because of the increase in international
 tension generated by escalation of the Vietnam w?r.
 Sato came to power in Japan in late 1964, and,
 bowing to US pressure, vetoed the sale of a second
 vinylon plant to China. Secretary of State Dean
 Rusk successfully implored the West Germans to
 cancel the sale of the steel rolling complex to "a
 country allied with North Vietnam." Negotiations
 *While Chou also loyally pursued the more "revolu-
 tionary" aspects of Chinese policy during this period as is
 clear from his tour through Africa (1984 ), his subsequent
 actions suggest that he was less tha;i enthusiastic about
 their utility.

 for normalization of relations with the West Ger-
 mans were broken off. Chou had come up against
 a store wall.
 In these circumstances, Chou's opponents were
 given an opportunity to challenge his position, and
 Mao himself probably was disillusioned to a con-
 siderable degree. Chou had tried to enhance China's
 strength anal prestige by aligning China with the
 second intermediate zone against the Soviets and
 the US, and had failed. The moderate leaders who
 had advocated that position, including Chou, were
 weakened, and therefore in a shaky position to op-
 pose Mao when he decided to launch the Cultural
 Revolution, which in its foreign policy dimension
 represented a return to "self-reliance" and xeno-
 phobic attacks on both the Soviet Union and the
 US.
 D. Changes in the External Setting
 During 1988, a number of events occurred which
 gave Chou an opening to resurrect elements of his
 pre-Cultural Revolution program. For one thing,
 certain Soviet actions-especially the invasion of
 Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces in August
 and the proclamation of the Brezhnev Doctrine
 justifying Soviet intervention in the internal affairs
 of other ,;acialist countries-offered dramatic and
 concrete evidence of the seriousness of the Soviet
 threat to China.
 just as important, several developments under-
 scored a movement towards US-Soviet cooperation.
 The Chinese naturally enough interpreted this as
 "collusion" by the superpowers which raised the
 spectre of the Soviets being freed to apply pressure
 against China with greatly diminished concern for
 their Western flank. First, of course, the Nuclear
 Nonproliferation Treaty was signed by the US,
 the USSR, and other countries in late June. In early
 July, Moscow announced its willingness to open
 Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the JS. Fur-
 thet, the Chinese saw the US protest against the
 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August as rela-
 tively mild. Most galling of all, perhaps, the US
 and the USSR had "colluded" in arranging for the
 May peace talks in Paris between the US and North
 Vietnam. Chou probably interpreted this movement
 for possible settlement of the Southeast Asian con-
 flict without a Chinese role as a direct and heavy
 cost of the self-imposed diplomatic isolation of the
 Cultural Revolution.*
 If the first two trends repre:?ented challenge-a
 third represented opportunity: signs that the US
 might be interested in improving i 'lations with
 China. This was implicit in the fact that internal
 pressures were mounting for a US withdrawal from
 Vietnam, and that the US presidential campaign in
 process centered on the theme of ending the war.
 In this crisis atmosphere the 12th Plenum of the
 Eighth Party Congress met in Peking in late Octo-
 ber 1968. The agenda addressed questions of when
 to hold the Ninth Party Congress and what policies
 and personnel changes to ratify there. While all
 outstanding differences could not have been re-
 solved at the Plenum, there is little doubt that the
 major issues were discussed and that the jockeying
 for power and position that precedes a party con-
 gress was begun in earnest.**
 The one major foreign policy decision that fol-
 lowed the Plenum represented a triumph for Chou
 and the moderates, made possible in large measure
 by the above changes in the external setting. De-
 spite Mao's sympathies for the radicals and their
 policy orientation, Chou apparently convinced Mao
 to make a bold shift in the direction of Chinese
 foreign policy. Basically, Chou must have argued
 that the best way to shore up China's shaky inter-
 national situation vis-a-vis the Soviets and to slow
 the pace of Soviet-US collusion was to lay the
 groundwork for improved relations with the United
 States.
 Within days of the close of the plenum on 31
 October, Chinese media began to take a less harsh
 line in commentary on the US. When President
 Johnson announced a bombing f alt over North
 Vietnam on 3 November, his speech was published
 can Relations and the Struggle for Power in the Kremlin,
 June-November 1961 (1973), paints a vivid picture of a
 similar situation in Moscow prior to and during the 23rd
 Party Congress of the CPSU.

 in full in People's Daily without the usual vituper-
 tive attacks on Washington. The New China News
 Agency's (NCNA) comment on Richard Nixon's
 election was carefully worded and avoided the
 harsh personal denunciations that had characterized
 Peking's treatment of Johnson. More significantly,
 subsequent  commentaries  on  Nixon's  election
 argued that he had won precisely because of his
 pledges to reduce the US military presence in Asia.
 With this preparation, a Central Directive was
 issued on 24 November over    Mao's   signature
 which contained a long section explicitly stating
 that it was often necessary to enter into negotia-
 tions with one's enemies. Two days later, a Chinese
 Foreign Ministry statement was published calling
 for revival of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in
 Warsaw on 20 February.* While the statement
 made clear that Washington should expect no
 major Chinese concessions during the scheduled
 talks, it was nonetheless apf. Trent that Peking
 wanted to open a substantive uialogue, a remark-
 able turnabout given the vehemence with which
 the Chinese had denounced North Vietnam for
 making essentially the same decision a few months
 earlier. In addition to his moves to alter China's
 US policy, Chou also began in October and No-
 vember to rebuild China's ties with a number of
 other countries in Asia and Eastern Europe that
 had been the victims c,f "Red Guard Diplomacy."
 The basic lines of the moderate policy alternative
 with its heavy reliance on conventional diplomacy
 had begun to reemerge after years of suppression.
 E. A Radical Counteroffensive
 Chou's initiative almost immediately began to
 encounter opposition within China. As Chinese in-
 fighting so often appears to do, this opposition
 took the form of articles which criticized current
 policy through analogy with similar situations in
 the past. In December, a series of articles violently
 The first ambassadorial level talks betw";n the US and
 the People's Republic of China were held in Geneva in
 1954, the primary topic being problems related to the
 Korean war. Over time a broad range of additional bi-
 lateral issues were discussed. In 1958 the venue of these
 talks was shifted to Warsaw. During the 134th session in
 early 1968, the Chinese bitterly denounced the US and
 suspended the talks indefinitely.
 Radical Leader Yao Wen-yuan
 denounced the foreign policies of Liu Shao-'hi, the
 former Chief of State who had been purged during
 the Cultural Revolution for his "bourgeois" policies.
 The opening shot came on 2 December in an article
 in the radical Shanghai paper Wen Hui Pao, which
 pointedly attacked Liu for betraying China's in-
 terests to the US during his visit to Indonesia in
 1963. Significantly, the article attacked those who
 opposed any new condemnation of Liu's foreign
 policies.
 Other articles, usually on subjects in the "cultural"
 sphere which Chiang Ching, Yao Wen-yuan and
 the radicals controlled, accused Liu of "capitulating"
 to the US and not fully exposing its "criminal acts."
 In a reference which had obvious immediate impact,
 one article stated that Liu's unwillingness to attack
 US policy had "amazed and startled even the
 bourgeois newspapers and periodicals of the West."
 Since Chou's muting of China's criticism of the US
 had generated considerable speculation in US
 papers over China's apparent policy shift, the
 article's target was obvious.

 Approved For Release 2008/11/06: CIA-RDP86T00608R000600170030-6
 A theme of many of the articles was that Liu
 had incorrectly favored use of peacful negotiations
 in dealing with the US rather than following the
 correct line of using armed force against the US
 and its ally, Nationalist China. "Taught by our great
 leader Chairman Mao," one article concluded, "the
 Chinese people were clear headed and refused to
 believe the nice words of the US imperialists ......
 an especially ironic statement since Mao had just
 directed that the Chinese people get used to the
 idea of negotiations with the "enemy," i.e., the US.
 Clearly, both Chou and the new policy line en
 dorsed by Mao were under heavy attack from the
 radicals who opposc-1 any change in the foreign
 policy of the Cultural Revolution and therefore any
 softening of China's stance toward the LS.
 25X1
 F. Lin Piao and the Military
 25X1
 While abundant evidence exists that Lin had
 become an opponent of the opening to the US
 by 1971, the problem remains of pinpo`.ntiw- when
 and why this foreign, policy issue becariu inter-
 twined with the power struggle between Lin and
 Mao, which can be dated at least back to 1969.
 It seems highly unlikely that any Chinese leader
 charged with dealing with national security issues
 could have ignored the dramatic and threatening
 events of the spring and summer of 1568, and un-
 questioningly reaffirmed his allegiance to the sterile
 radical alternative. However, Lin could have at-
 tempted to counter Chou's initiative by insisting
 on an offsetting step toward the SLviet Union.
 Indeed, it is precisely this "error" that i i and
 his fellow military conspirators were to h- charged
 with following their fall from power.
 Certainly, many Chinese military leaders had
 long harbored a strong distrust of the US and
 Japan, as well as historical memories of the PLA's
 cooperation with the Soviet army, and it would
 not be surprising to find many of them gravely up-
 set over a policy which advocated diminishing ten-
 sion with the US while continuing to maintain
 a high level of tension with the USSR. Moreover,
 a plausible case could be made for reducing the
 immediate threat of a Soviet attack by some re-
 conciliatory gesture toward Moscow, and they re-
 allocating China's resources toward building the
 kind of advanced weapon's capability that would
 be a credible deterrent to Soviet aggression.*  25X1
 In addition to the internal logic of this recon-
 struction of the military view in 1968-69, there is
 evidence
 that suggests that Lin was indeed at odds
 with Mao and Chou over foreign policy issues dur-
 ing this eat 1v period.

 '5X1
 25X1
 Other indications of a split over foreign policy
 at this time
 deserve consideration.
 First of all, th- re-publication on 26 November 1968
 of Mao's 1949 speech which justified negotiations
 with one's enemies could just as easily be applied to
 negotiations with Moscow is with W't'ashington. And
 while the speech was edited prior to publication
 to exclude many historical anomalies, upon publica-
 tir'*r it still retained the phase, "the world anti-im-
 perialist front headed by the Soviet Union," a re-
 ;narkable editorial oversight given the state of Sino-
 Soviet relations in November 1968. Commenting cn
 the extensive justification of China's anti-Soviet
 policy in the major report at the Ninth Party Con-
 gress, Thomas Robinson observes "it is possible that
 the entire Maoist a .ti-Sos L, policy was under at-
 tack during, and presumably befor^, the Con-
 gress." ??
 Lin also had very good reasons for opposing the
 opening of talks with the US quite apart from the
 specific foreign policy implications of the move.
 Stricti, in terms of he rivalry with Chou and his
 alli 's in the civilian bureaucracies, Lin would not
 have wanted Chou to garner credit for an important
 initiative, especially at a time when critical per-
 sonned decisions were be'ng made regarding the
 composition of the Politburo to oe chosen by the
 Ninth Party Congress. In ti _ "violent 'truggle" that
 Doak Barnett describes as preceding the Congress,
 rivalries and differences over a host of matters
 would have motivated Lin to try to discredit and, if
 possible, reverse any policy associated with Chou,
 his most influential rival. Thus, both the military
 coalition and the radicals, each for their own
 reasons, were probably in a tacit if not overt al-
 liance aimed at reversing the first tentative step
 toward the opening to the US.
 G. Cancellation of the Warsaw Talks
 Despite opposition from the radicals as well as
 Lin and the military coalition, Chou persisted in
 the course he had set with Mao's approval. As late
 as two days prior to the scheduled talks with the
 US, preparations were proceeding on sched"le in
 \\'ar,aw. Then, as abruptly as Chinese policy had
 shifted toward the opening to the US, Peking an-
 nounced on 18 February 1969 that the talks would
 not be held. Soon thereafter, the restraint that had
 generally characterized Chinese media treatment
 of the US since November gave way to the virulent
 and abusive propaganda style of the Cultural Revo-
 lution.
 The circumstances of this turn a?.vay from an
 emergent new Chinese policy suggests ti' -t both
 Mao and Chou may have b^en overruled b} a coali-
 tion of the radicals and the elements in the military
 responsive to  Lin Piao. Alternatively, Mao and
 Chou may have reasoned that given the strong op-
 position of the radi  'c and the military, a tempo-
 rary retreat was in order. In any case, this dramatic
 reversal almost c: rtainly reflected  the growing
 strength of the Lin forces.*
 At the same time Washington raised an issue
 which hurt the moderates' case. In his press con-
 ferencc of 8 February, President Nixon not only
 reiterated U5 interest in SALT negotiations with
 the Soviets, he also justified his ABM program by
 saying it was directed against the "Chinese nuclear
 19

 threat." That the President had touched a raw
 nerve of China's status sensitivity was apparent
 from the fact that NCNA did not eves, mention
 Nixon's remarks on the ABM system and the Chi-
 nese nuclear threat in its story on the press con-
 ference. While t.us incident should not be exag-
 gerated, it does appear that the press conference
 gave opponents of Chou and Mao additional am-
 munition in their campaign against the opening
 to the US. Certainly the ostensible reason given
 by the Chinese for cancelling the talks-the defec-
 tion of a Chinese attache in Europe in early Feb-
 ruary--is not a sufficient explanation fo; the turn
 around.
 25X1   H. Bureaucratic Politics and the 2 March
 Clash
 That Mao and Chcu had been reversed on an
 initiative in which they had invested considerable
 prestige is only one of a number of indications that
 they may have been politically on the defensive
 at this time.
 It was in these circumstances, just 12 days after
 the planned Warsaw talks were cancelled and some
 30 days before the opening of the Ninth Party
 Congress,  that Chinese troops  attacked  Soviet
 soldiers near Chen-pao and touched off the most
 serious crisis in the history of relations between
 Communist China and the USSR. Since the Chinese
 Politburo was already debating the wisdom of a
 major shift in its foreign policy sta:tce, this debate
 almost certainly influenced any decision regarding
 an attack on the Soviet Union. Those segments of
 the military that followed Lin Piao's lead probably
 were concerned about the initial steps taken toward
 the US and desirous of a more evenhanded policy
 which included an attempt at reconciliation with
 the USSR. It would thus seem highly improbable
 that most military men would have favored a delib-
 erate provocation against the Soviets, especially at
 a time when military forces were still being used to
 restore infernal order.
 On the other hand, a clash with the Soviets
 would serve the interests of Mao and Chou in a
 number of areas. Most importantly, it would be a
 strong reassertion of Maas personal authority fol-
 lowing the 18 February setback and the general
 trend toward greater power for Lin and the military.
 Secondly, it would make it far more difficult for
 the         coalition to sustain a case that Sino-
 So. iet relations should be improved. Thirdly, the
 resultant increase in Sino-Soviet tension would pro-
 vide dramatic justification for an opening to the
 US. And finally, it would serve the purpose of im-
 peding the trend toward Sov* * --US "collusion" by
 demonstrating the aggressive military nature of
 Soviet behavior. In short, it would serve both the
 foreign policy and domestic political purposes of
 these key Chinese decisionmakers.
 This line of explanation, howevor, raises very
 difficult questions: if Lin and his supporters on the
 Politburo had been strong enough to reverse Mao
 and Chcu on the question of the Warsaw talks,
 why would they not have had enough clout to
 prevent  an action which was not in the best
 interests of the policy line they advocated? More-
 over, since Lin was in charge of the defense bu-
 reaucracy, how could a decision requiring a military
 action be taken without his approval?
 While it is possible that Mao and Chou con-
 fronted Lin directly on this d:cis:on and simply

 ordered him to take steps to implement it, it seems
 more likely that, given their weak political position,
 they pursued their goals in a less direct manner
 by circumventing the normal chain of command
 and ordering Chen Hsi-lien, commander of the
 Shenyang Military Region, either to attack the
 Soviets or to alter patrolling procedures and get
 tough with the Soviets, thereby increasing sub-
 stantially the chances of a clash.
 But why would Chen Hsi-lien agree to a request
 from Mao or Chou which in effect would involve
 him directly in the internal power struggle in Pe-
 king? First of all, Chen's own personal ambitions
 were well sei ved by an increase i ~ tension on the
 Sino-Soviet border. There is a direct relationship
 between the relative military power exercised by
 China's regional military leaders and the potential
 influence they wield. As commander of the largest
 of China's military regions, except for Peking, Chen
 wielded considerable influence, but his position
 had been weakened by early 1969 because the re-
 quirements of the Cultural Revolution had led to
 the transfer of two of Shenyang's eight armies
 to more heavily populated areas in China. The 1969
 bo;;ler crisis, however, led to the redeployment of
 th c :e armies back to Chen's command and this,
 along with his role in the crisis, probably influenced
 his elevation to the Politburo at the Ninth Party
 Congress. Moreover, his subsequent career sug-
 gests that he has enjoyed the added trust and
 appreciation of Mao and Chou ever since the 1969
 crisis. At a crucial juncture in 1974 when Mao and
 Chou's policies were again under fire, Chen was
 made commander of the critical Peking Military
 Region, and, in early 1975 Chen was elevated to
 the rank of Vice Premier at the National People's
 Congress which was dominated by the moderates.*
 Thus, given the kind of political infighting that was
 under way in 1965 and 1969, it is plausible that
 Chen would have obeyed a direct order from Mao
 without consulting Lin Piao.
 Othe- aspects of the events surrounding the 2
 March incident support the view that the attack
 was not carefully planaed by China's defense estab-
 lishment, but, instead, was arranged on short notice,
 and ex,,cnted without the knowledge of higher mili-
 tary authorities in the normal chain of command.
 Chen-Pao, for example, was an unusual site for a
 thougi,`ful military planner to select for a clash with
 the Soviets since no sizeable Chinese military in-
 stallations or airfields existed nearby, and Soviet
 forces were highly concentrated in the area. In
 addition, no major preparations were made prior
 to the attack, and there were indications that Chi-
 nese military authorities in Peking were at bast
 as surprised that the clash had occurred as were
 Soviet authorities.
 This interpretation of the 2 March clash, in short,
 has Mao and Chou acting hastily and for highly
 political purposes rather than deliberately and
 solely with concern for what China's national in-
 terests required. That they were prepared to risk
 the death of hundreds of Chinese soldiers and con-
 ceivably even war with the Soviet Union is thus
 a measure not only of how high they calculated

 the stakes in the internal power struggle, but also
 of how badly they wanted to discredit those within
 China who opposed the opening to the US. Cer-
 tainly the message that Mao could count on the
 loyalty of China's second most powerful military
 i. gional commander would not be lost on Lin in
 the continuing power struggle.
 !. !nternal Politics and the Soviet Question
 It is important to note that Soviet leaders were
 closely following events in China -.nd that their
 interpretation of Chinese politics and foreign policy
 at this time was similar r) the one presented above.
 Soviet diplomats          observed at the time
 that the Congress  a   urt er Lolated Chou and
 the "tcehnecrats," and expressed the view that Chou
 had emerged from the Co" "re" with a "diminution
 of real power."
 a number of anccTes m t e  oviet
 press at t is time referred to opposition to Mao
 among military leaders,* More ominously, one So-
 viet official stated in April that Moscow was closely
 watching the development of "centrifugal tenden-
 cies in China," including provincial leaders who
 often found themselves at odds with the center. If
 the situation in China disintegrated further, he
 said, and "local elements" requested help from the
 USSR in its struggle with the "Maoist leadership,"
 the Soviets might respond positively. Finally, Mos-
 cow ordered a substantial reduction in all propa-
 ganda attacks against Peking once the Ninth Party
 Congress opened, another indication that some So-
 viet faders may have believed that a less hostile
 leadership might emerge from the internal struggle
 going on within China.**
 Given this perspective, it is not surprising that
 the Soviets tended to relate the 2 Marsh clash to
 Chinese domestic politics. Soon after the incident,
 Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin told American of-
 ficials in Washington that the border clash was
 instigated with an eye toward the opening of the
 Ninth Party Congress. The 21 March issue of New
 propaganda during the Tenth Party Congress in 1973.
 Times, stated flatly that the clash was an outgrowth
 of the "power struggle" within China. Though
 neither Dobrynin nor the New Times article offered
 any supporting detail, their interpretations at least
 raise the possibility that Moscow's views on the
 internal Chinese political situation were being
 shaped by information supplied by highly placed
 sources within the Chinese leadership.*
 J. Aftermath
 In the immediate aftermath of the 2 March inci-
 dent, many observers dismissed the clash as of
 little significsuuce, yet another border skirmish
 which would quickly blow over. The Soviets also
 appeared initially to nave wanted to avoid a major
 propaganda exchange. A border clash without some
 follow-up, howev,.r, would have served neither
 the domestic nor foreign policy goals of Mao and
 Chou. Indeed, it is interesting to note that if the 25X1
 goals had been focused primarily on territorial
 issues, then subsequent Soviet probes aimed at
 reopening the border talks would probably have
 been accepted more quiccly. But instead of limiting
 themselves to sending a diplomatic protest note to
 Moscow, Mao and Chou implemented a massive
 anti-Soviet campaign.
 Nationwide demonstrations began on the day
 after the clash. By 7 March some 260 million Chi-
 nese had participated in mass rallies denouncing
 Soviet revisionism and vowing vigilance along the
 border. In addition, angry demonstrations were
 staged outside the Soviet Embassy from 3 through
 6 March and then resumed on 11 March, a tactic
 which drew a parallel response in Moscow on 11
 March. Following the Soviet counterattack on 15
 March, the anti-Soviet demonstrations resumed,
 and Chinese propaganda continued to attack Mos-
 cow shrilly. The message to the domestic rivals of
 Mao and Chou was unmistakable: anti-Soviet senti-
 ment was strong among the Chinese people and
 anyone favoring lessened tension with Moscow was
 treading on very unpopular ground.
 During the Ninth Party Congress, which opened
 on 1 April, Mao and Chou continued to exploit the
 *This, of course, is what the Chinese themselves strongly
 suspect, and there is at least enough circumstantial evidence
 in this regard to suggest Chinese fears about Soviet inter-
 ference in their internal affairs is not the product of an
 exaggerated paranoia.

 crisis with the Soviets, even going so far as to
 have one of the officers involved in the border
 clash appear before the assembled delegates. The
 key document presented at the Congress was the
 Political Report, and in the drafting and redrafting
 that preceded the formal presentation, Mao and
 Chou almost certainly used the implications of the
 crisis in their dispute with Lin over the foreign
 policy line to be taken.* In this they were partially
 successful. The report formalized the view that the
 Soviet Union was as serious an enemy of China
 as the US, though, possibly in defer;;nce to Lin's
 demands, Moscow was not yet named China's
 principal enemy. Moreover, the denunciations of
 the US were relatively routine; the Vietnam war,
 a key cause of continued Sino-US tension, was not
 even mentioned.
 Other sections of the report, however, reflect
 Lin's influence. In addition to insisting on language
 which left the door open for improved relations
 with the USSR, the leader of "world socialism," *
 the report asserted that Peking's foreign policy was
 "consistent" and that it was "not based on expedi-
 ency," a probable slap at the moderates who wanted
 to take the expedient route of dealing with the US
 in the face of a Soviet threat. The debate over the
 contentious issues in the report continued to be a
 central issue in Chinese politics in the months
 following the Congress.
 While there were ups and downs in Chinese
 propaganda throughout the remainder of 1969, ten-
 sion in Sino-Soviet relations remained high, in large
 measure because until September the Chinese con-
 tinued aggressive border patrolling and this resulted
 in additional armed clashes, and because Moscow
 responded by dropping veiled hints about a nuclear

 strike. By August and September a number of
 Western observers, including some intelligence
 analysts, had concluded that a Sino-Soviet war was
 inevitable in the near term. Whether or not the
 Chinese themselves expected war is not certain,
 but there is little doubt that they were alarmed
 and that the crisis atmosphere reinforced the posi-
 tion of the Chinese moderates who were disposed
 to be receptive to the overtures for improved Sino-
 US relations which were coming out of Washington.
 In what was almost certainly a compromise be-
 tween the moderates and their opponents, the
 Chinese agreed in October to open negotiations on
 the border dispute with Moscow, and then in Jan-
 uary 1970 announced they would be willing to re-
 schedule the aborted February 1969 Warsaw talks
 with the US. While it almost immediately became
 apparent that they were not taking the Sino-Soviet
 border talks seriously, they tried to keep up momen-
 tum in relations with the US by meeting in Warsaw
 in February 1970 and then scheduling another ses-
 sion of the bilateral talks for May 1970. Thus, the
 basic foreign policy goal of justifying steps toward
 an ope:iing to the US was well served by the 2
 March crisis; though, as discussed subsequently,
 Lin's drive toward expanding his power and influ-
 ence in party affairs was not derailed but only
 slowed. He continued to oppose each move in the
 direction of Sino-US rapprochement. In this con-
 text, the Sino-Soviet clash of 1969 was a prelude
 to the decisive confrontation between the moder-
 ates and the military which began in 1969 and came
 to a crisis two years later-the fall or- Lin Piao.
 III. WATERSHED: THE FALL OF LIN PIAO
 OVERVIEW
 By almost all surface criteria, Lin Piao had won
 a stunning victory at the Plinth Party Congress, pri-
 marily at the expense of Chou En-lai, his principal
 rival. Chhou's power base was in the Bove: nmental
 bureaucracies, and of the six men drawn from this
 sector on the Politburo in 1968, all but two, Chou
 and Li Hsien-nien, lost their positions at the Con-
 grsss. Eleven military men were added to the Polit-
 buro, a majority of whom were apparently Lin
 supporters. Lira's close ally Chen Po-ta,was named
 to the crucial Standing Committee of the Politburo,
 and more  importantly,  the  Congress  formally
 adopted a new constitution designating Lin by
 name as Mao's successor. Lin, it appeared, was well
 on his way to supreme power within C-iina. And
 yet, in just over two years after the 1`iinth Party
 Congress, Lin had fallen from power following an
 iniense and ultimately violent struggle within the
 Chinese leadership.
 Lin's fall was far more than the purging of a
 single individual. It was preceded by an elaborate
 conspiracy against Mao that involved a large number
 of individuals, and was followed by a massive
 purge of virtually all of China's ranking central
 military leaders. In the context of the framework
 presented in this paper, the Lin Piao affair repre-
 sented the crisis stage of the struggle for power
 between the moderate coalition and the military
 that had been under way since the winding down
 of the Cultural Revolution in 1968. In relative terms,
 the radical coalition played only a marginal role.
 Most previous explanations of the Lin Piao crisis
 have down-played the role of foreign policy issues.
 By contrast, this study presents the view that these
 issues, and more specifically what they implied
 in terms of resource allocation and the resultant
 balance of power between the moderate and mili-
 tary coalitions, are central to explaining the course
 of events that preceded. Lin's abortive 1971 coup.
 In brief, Lin appears to have consistently opposed
 any steps toward rapprochment with the US
 throughout 1969 and 1970. He apparently seized
 on the US invasion of Cambodia in the spring
 of 1970 to argue for the cancellation of the sched-
 uled Sino-US talks in Warsaw and to persuade
 Mao to make a series of reconciliatory gestures
 toward Moscow. This shift toward Lin's approach
 to foreign policy came to an abrupt end following
 the Second Plenum of the Ninth Party Congress in
 August 1970 when the balance of internal political
 forces began to tilt against Lin. Soon thereafter,
 there was a major change in China's propaganda
 line and by December 1970 Mao felt strong enough
 to extend the historic invitation to President Nixon.
 Lin's continued opposition to the opening to the
 US is well documented, but what is more difficult

 ,in Piao presenting the Polit;cal Report at the Ninth Party Congress
 to explain is- t(/ty It(, felt compelled to risk a con-
 frontation with \lao on this issue. The (tstt'er (ip-

 critical debates over foreign polict/ issues in 1971,

 If Chou suc((cded in enhancing Chinas sense of
 securilrl by improved relations with Washirwton,
 they reasoned, a key element in their rational' for
 high military e.rpcndittires' would be undercut. They
 may also have argued that Soviet-(%S progress ill

 security and that the ('S was, because of its "col-
 lusion" nit/t the USSR, an untrustwortht/ cottnter-

 of Foreign Minister Chino Luau-lino "foreign poli-
 cies are inseparable from  domestic policies" in
 China.
 A. Traditional Explanations
 Most pres'ioos stndi('s of Lin's fall have concluded
 that the' "central  issue" in the crisis was Mao's
 decision to rcasscrt civilian control over a military
 cstahlishrncnt that had grown  too  powerful as a
 result of the Cultural Hcyolotion, and tilt- military's

 dismiss the heated debates over foreign policy
 issues among China's leaders as "more tactical than
 causative or fundamental in nature," and suggest
 that Lin's favorable references to Moscow were
 made only "to score debating points."* While the
 discussion that follows does not dispute the view
 that the Lin crisis was ultimately over whether
 "civilians" or Lin Piao and his military supporters
 would rule China, it does attempt to show that the
 debate over foreign policy was not a tactical side-
 show but rather a central and fundamental issue
 in the power struggle that preceded Lin's abortive
 coup.
 B. Foreign Policy Differences
 As early as 1969, Lin had found himself at odds
 with Mao and Chou over whether or not to begin
 the process of improving relations with the US.
 After apparently derailing the first attempt to re-
 new the Warsaw talks, Lin used every occasion
 possible to criticize Chou's line that improving
 relations with the US should be a priority objective
 of China's foreign policy. In the fall of 1969, he
 probably insisted that if the Warsaw talks were
 rescheduled for February 1970, Sino-Soviet border
 negotiations would also have to begin. And then
 in April 1970, the US and South Vietnamese in-
 vasion of Cambodia gave Lin the leverage he
 needed to press for a major shift away from the
 opening to the US and toward some form of
 reconciliation with  Moscow.  Lin  undoubtedly
 argued that this US action proved that a major
 premise of Chou's policy-that the US was with-
 drawing from Vietnam and therefore no longer
 constituted a threat to China-was erroneous. Using
 this argument, lie apparently convinced Mao not
 only to cancel the scheduled May 1970 session of
 the Warsaw talks, but also to revert to the anti-US
 rhetoric of the Cultural Revolution. In a statement
 approved personally by Mao and issued on 20 May,
 the US was shrilly condemned, and President Nixon
 was assaulted as a perpetrator of "fascist atrocities."
 Significantly, within hours after it was issued, Lin
 personally read this statement to a massive rally
 in Peking organized by the PLA. Moreover, an
 authoritative joint editorial in June took a s-Avage
 swipe at Chou and the modes ate coalition by stat-
 ing that the "principal criterion" for judging a loyal
 revolutionary was his attitude toward the US.
 Lin was also apparently active in engineering
 a change in the direction or Chinese policy toward
 the USSR. The earliest indication came during
 Mao's and Lin's joint appearance at the May Day
 rally, an event which marked the first time the
 two leaders had appeared together in public in
 some six months. On this occasion, Mao went so
 far as to exchange comments with the chief Soviet
 negotiator to the border talks, an important sym-
 bolic gesture.
 Just as significantly, there occurred at this time
 a marked and prolonged decrease in the volume
 and virulence of anti-Soviet propaganda. From 22
 April until 8 September, Peking issued no authori-
 tative direct attack on Moscow and there was a
 notable restraint in the few anti-Soviet stories that
 were printed. Most remarkably, there was virtually
 no commentary on the Brezhnev Doctrine on the
 1970 anniversary of the August 1968 Soviet inva-
 sion of Czechoslovakia. Indeed, the topic of the
 Brezhnev Doctrine which had received enormous
 media treatment in 1968 and 1969 was addressed
 authoritatively dur.,ig this period only once-by
 Chou En-lai. While at first Moscow continued its
 propaganda attacks unabated, by early summer the
 Soviets had begun to restrain their own polemics.
 And on 15 August, tht. Soviets dispatched Deputy
 Foreign Minister Ilichev to Peking as their newly
 appointed chief negotiator in the border talks.
 One of the clearest indications of tension between
 the moderates and the military was the marked
 schizophrenia evident in Peking's treatment of Army
 Day on 1 August. While Chou En-lai's statement
 just prior to Army Day stressed the dangers of
 the Brezhnev Doctrine and the joint editorials on
 1 August pointed to the Soviet build-up on the

 Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng, left front, reviewing PLA troops

 national interests.*
 *Huang, who was almost certainly acting on Lin's behalf

 Events began to move rapidly against Lin and
 his military supporters soon after Army Day. While
 Mao may have been susceptible to Lin's arguments
 in the period immediately following the Cambodian
 invasion, reasoning perhaps that a brief tactical
 shift toward the USSR would have an impact on
 US policy, he almost certainly was displeased to
 see how far Lin was carrying things. It was in
 these circumstances that the Second Plenum of the
 Ninth Party Congress convened-in August 1970.
 At the Plenum, Lin and his supporters gambled
 that they were in a strong enough position to

 challenge Mao on the crucial issue of whether to
 retain the constitutional position of Chief of State.*
 They not only lost this gamble but Lin's close
 associate, Chen Po-ta was purged and branded a
 Soviet agent, a clear indication of the extreme
 dangers of even appearing to adapt a "soft" line
 toward Moscow. In addition to these setbacks, Lin
 also apparently lost out in the debate over foreign
 policy. At any rate, the communique that was
 issued following the Plenum took a foreign policy
 line that differed markedly from the thrust of
 Chinese policy in the previous four months. While
 some restraint was evident in the communique,
 Moscow was authoritatively denounced for the first
 time since prior to the Cambodian incursion, and
 the moderates' policy of improving relations with
 the US avid other "friends all over the world" was
 strongly endorsed.
 The Plenum's communique was followed by an
 even harsher attack on Moscow in an authoritative
 People's Daily Commentator article on 13 Septem-
 ber. The NCNA report accompanying the Com-
 mentator article emphasized this sensitive issue
 of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia comparing
 it to Hitler's invasion of Poland. Moscow responded
 in kind and the brief thaw in Soviet-Chinese rela-
 tions was replaced by a period of harsh invective
 which lasted until January 1971 when a new period
 of relative calm set in, as a result of a Soviet effort
 to wind down the polemics.
 Concomitant with the escalation of Sino-Soviet
 polemics, there were a number of major advances
 for the moderate coalition's program in other areas.
 In the three months following the Plenum, recogni-
 tion agreements were concluded with four coun-
 tries including Canada and Italy. State-to-state
 bilateral relations with Burma also improved, a
 key barometer of the influence of the moderates
 on policy. At the level of ideology, a major doctrinal
 departure was apparent in a November speech by
 Chou's close associate Chiao Kuan-hua. Chiao re-
 formulated and expanded the concept of peaceful
 coexistence by stating that it applied to relations
 between "all countries whether they have the same

 position abolished; Lin, reasoning that this diminished his
 own prestige as Mao's heir apparent and would impair his

 this change.
 or different social systems." This contrasted sharply
 with the previous authoritative statement on the
 subject made by Lin Piao at the Ninth Party
 Congress. Lin at that time had made an important
 distinction between the principles to be applied
 to capitalist and socialist countries, stating that the
 former should be dealt with on the basis of peaceful
 coexistence while relations with the latter should
 follow the principle of "proletarian international-
 ism." Chiao's statement marked a clear and unam-
 biguous shift away from an ideologically based
 foreign policy to one emphasizing state-to-state
 relations, and thereby constituted a major victory
 for the moderate coalition.
 These developments set the stage for Mao's cru-
 cial interview with Edgar Snow in December 1970,
 during which Mao said that President Nixon "would
 be welcome" to visit Peking. While it can be argued
 that Mao had alread, iined up a consensus behind
 this initiative, there are also reasons to believe
 that Mao, perhaps in consultation with only Chou
 En-lai, decided to float the concept of a Nixon
 visit and then wait to see how strong the reaction
 would be within China's top leadership. He un-
 doubtedly expected strong opposition, and may have
 decided on a bold move making China's invitation
 a fait accompli that would be difficult to reverse,
 even by a leader with the political clout of Lin Piao.
 It is also important to note that Lin and his
 military supporters were faced by early 1971 not

 only with rapid progress li Sino-US relations, but
 also with a major change in the direction of China's
 policy toward Japan, a nation that virtually all
 Chinese military men looked upon as an historic
 enemy and as a potentially very powerful future
 enemy.*
 Lin Piao and his supporters
 had opposed the opening both to the US and Japan.
 Thus, moves toward improving relations with the
 Japanese were probably as hotly debated as the
 Sino-US issue.
 C. Policy Issues and Power         25X1
 At a critical point in any policy debate between
 leaders at the pinnacle of power, differences over
 issues become so intense that it is not the policy
 itself which is paramount, but rather the authority,
 power, and influence of the leader advocating the
 policy. And at this juncture the debate over policy
 is transformed into a struggle for who will hold
 the ultimate power to decide the issue. In 1973
 no less an authority than Deputy Foreign Minister
 Chiao Kuan-hua said that debates over foreign
 policy issues occur frequently, but that if one
 opposes a whole series of decisions, one becomes a
 prime candidate for being stripped of all power
 and purged from the party and government.*
 In this context, the key question is not whether
 Lin Piao opposed the opening to the US and Japan,
 but why he judged that this issue was important
 enough to run the ultimate risk of strongly and
 *Chiao, who became Foreign Minister in 1974, made his
 statement in response to the following direct question: "It
 appears that on a number of occasions in the last decade
 foreign policy issues have been a matter of serious debate
 and division. I realize that this is a sensitive .uestion, but
 could you give us your views on this matter?"

 repeatedly opposing a policy that clear'y had the
 approval of Chairman Mao himself.
 Part of the answer to this question lies in the
 dynamics of the rivalry between Lin and Chou
 and their respective power bases. Very early in
 the protracted debate over policy toward the US
 and the USSR, Lin put his prestige on the line
 and probably argued that the US would remain
 deeply involved militarily in Asia and would there-
 fore remain a principal enemy of China. Chou
 made a different estimate which eventually proved
 correct. Lin also probably argued that in the proper
 circumstances Moscow would be willing to make
 a significant move to decrease Sino-Soviet tension
 and that this option should be explored. Chou
 countered that Moscow would offer only unsatis-
 factory gestures; and in this, also, events proved
 him right. So jr '"olicy debate after policy debate,
 a certain dynar   propelled both Lin and Chou to
 attack the posi;.uns of the other in order to dis-
 credit the policymaker as well as the policy.
 The roots of Lin's intransigent position, howe""er,
 prob..'' 'y lie even deeper. He and his supporters
 were _ repared to risk their careers because they
 realize.l that the power they had attained, as well
 as the even more exalted status they were seeking,
 were jeopardized by the implications of the policies
 advocated by their rivals in the moderate coalition.
 Decreased tension with the US and Japan and
 the increased sense of security that would grow out
 of improved relations with a nuclear power like
 the US, Lin and his supporters reasoned, would
 lead to pressures for smaller military expenditures,
 especially in the areas they believed to be critical-
 nuclear weapons, missiles, aircraft, and advanced
 military technology in general. And with a declining
 military budget, their influence and authority would
 also decline. Having fought his way to within a
 short distance of ultimate power in China, Lin
 saw the prospect of a reallocation of China's re-
 sources away from his power base in the military in
 general and the air force in particular as a direct
 assault on his personal authority. Thus, rather than
 see their power and authority drained away by the
 thrust of the mode.. `e coalition's program, Lin
 and his supporters first opposed this program at
 every possible juncture, and, when this failed, at-
 tempted to seize power to reverse the unwelcome
 transformation of China's d'imestic and foreign
 policy that was gaining momentum in 1971.   25X1
 D. Resource Allocation
 First of all it is important to note that discussion
 of the parameters of China's Fourth Five Year
 Plan (1971-1975) had begun in late 1970 and con-
 tinued until after Lin's fall in late 1971. The debate
 over allocation of China's scarce resources under
 the Plan was almost certainly sharply contested.
 Thus, concomitant with the debates over foreign
 policy issues came an intense struggle over re-
 source allocation, a struggle which inevitably be-
 came entangled with the specifics of the quarrel25X1
 over foreign policy.
 Throughout the summer of
 1971 numerous articles in People's Daily as well 25X1
 as some Radio Peking broadcasts focused attention
 on the problem of whether "electronics" or "steel
 and iron" should take priority in advancing the
 development of the national economy. A 13 June

 Approved For Release 2008/11/06: CIA-RDP86T00608R000600170030-6
 article in People's Daily argued that one group of
 "political swii 1lers" within China (i.e., Lin and
 his group) saw "atomic technology and jet engine
 technology" (i.e., electronics) as the key to enhanc-
 ing China's power and status in world affairs. A
 Radio Peking broadcast on 20 August was even
 more pointed. It charged that the same group of
 "swindlers" believed that advanced weapons were
 the "key to victory," and that once China possessed
 them, "all imperialists will be finished and over-
 thrown." Significantly, these views were sharply
 contrasted with those of Mao who was quoted as
 condemning any strategy which was premised on
 the concept that "weapons decide everything."
 It should be noted that this interpretation of
 Lin's fall from power does not argue that foreign
 policy issues were more important than the general
 issue of civilian versus military rule. In effect,
 foreign policy  sues were so intimately linked to a
 cluster of other issues that they formed an integral
 part of the overall struggle between the moderate
 coalition and the military coalition. A debate aver
 resource allocation and foreign policy was the im-
 mediate catalyst because it brought to a head the
 entire question of the continued predominance of
 the military in Chinese politics and society. Mao
 and Chou were undoubtedly engaged in a broadly-
 based campaign to prevent Lin and the military
 from expanding their power still further, and to
 do so they not only confronted this issue specifi-
 cally, but also used the thrust of their foreign
 policy program to focus the debate on the concrete
 issue of resource allocation.* Just as in 1969 when
 they had used a foreign policy crisis to further
 their domestic goals, so in 1971 they used arguments
 drawn from the implications of their diplomatic
 program for the same purpose.
 *In this reg:_td it is interesting to note that Mao himself
 has stated explicitly that one tactic he employs is to attack
 his opponents on the basis of issues rather than to confront
 them directly.

 All of this points to a general view that there is
 not as wide a divisio? in China as in the US be-
 tween the worlds of the foreign and domestic
 policymaker; indeed, it is reasonable to conclude
 that the small number of men at the apex of China's
 political structure do not make any significant dis-
 tinctions between the spheres of domestic, foreign,
 and national security policy. Indeed, Foreign 14in-
 aster Chiao Kuan-hua has stated explicitly that in
 China " for eign policies are inseparable from domes-
 tic policies," and that no separate formal decision-
 making structure for foreign policy similar to the
 National Security Council exists iii China.
 E. Internal Politics and the Soviet Question
 in the immediate aftermath of Lin's demise in
 Septcmbr 1971, the leadership stniggle between
 the moderates and the radicals apparently inten-
 sified. For about ten or twelve days between
 roughly 12 September and 25 September, the top
 leadership met in Peking to thrash out the measures
 that were to be taken in the wake of the crisis.
 During this period, the radicals may well have
 attempted to take advantage of the uncertain situa-
 Just as in 1969 when the lea&rsl,ip struggle
 intensified prior to the  Ninth  Party Congress,
 China's central leadership resorted to playing up
 the Soviet threat in the unsettled and fluid situa-
 tion that followed Lin's abortive coup.
 25X1
 25X1
 Indeed, a crisis atmosp ere was
 transmitted not only to party cadres but alsc to
 China's informed public. Summing up his impres-
 sions of what was going on, a resident of Canton
 stated that in September there was "a period of
 intense war alert during which hostilities with the
 Soviet Union were expected at any tirne "
 In reality, however, China's central leadership
 was far more concerned about possible Soviet
 manipulation of the internal conflict within China
 express their view that the Soviets not only have
 had lines of coin mu nication to certain elements
 within China, but also that the Soviets consistent)
 try to exacerbate differences within China.

 IV. IMPLICATIONS P OR THE US 25X1
 A. The "Collus*,on" Theme as a Key Indicator
 Since they began the transformation of China's
 domestic and foreign policies in 1968, backers of
 the moderate alternative have had to fight a two-
 front domestic war. On the one hand, they have
 1)(4-n opposed by the radicals who were hostile
 to ?- e moderate policy cluster for ideological rea-
 so. . On the other, they have been opposed by the

 Approved For Release 2008/11/06: CIA-RDP86T00608R000600170030-6
 military coalition not only because it was seeking
 supreme power in China, but also on grounds of
 "national security."
 While the leverage of the radical coalition on
 policy decisions has now been considerably re-
 duced, this apparently is not the case for the mili-
 tary coalition.* This is for three reasons: many
 military leaders have their own independent power
 bases; they almost certainly have sympathizers
 within the moderate coalition in general and the
 foreign policy establishment in particular; they have
 a strong argument which is cast in terms of China's
 vital national security interests. Their argument
 probably would go something like this:
 A basic premise of the moderates' rational security
 pro tram is that "contention" will always win oat over
 "co 'usion" in Soviet-US relations, and that China can
 therefore count on a powerful US as a counterbalance
 to the USSR in world affairs. This premise, however,
 is extremely dangerous because it does not take into
 consideration two very real possibilities: 1) the first
 is that the US, because of domestic political and eco-
 nomic difficulties as well as international setbacks,
 may fall seriously behind Moscow in terms of the
 global balance of power and therefore he unable
 to adequately fill the role of a strategic counterbalance
 to Soviet power; 2) perhaps in part because of the
 above, the US may well find it convenient or even nec-
 essary to place such a great emphasis on improved
 relations with the Soviets, especially in the critical area
 of strategic arms limitation, that it will be willing
 to sacrifice its relations with China to attain this goal.
 Rather than rely on the US as  strategic counterbalance
 to the USSR, China must in the short term ameliorate
 tensions with Moscow to decrease the immediate threat
 of a nuclear war that China could not win, and, in the
 long term, place emphasis on building up a credible
 nuclear defense structure that could ensure China's
 security in the face of the USSR, the US, or Japan
 should it become a nuclear power. Thus, China is
 endangering its national security by placing too large
 .  .hare of its nationa! resources in the service of
 economic development rather than milits,y expendi-
 tures, and the diploma'.ic rationale for fallowing this
 course may well be i.acorrect because it fails to take
 inte consider: Lion the prospect that Soviet-US c tnpe-
 tition in world affairs could well be replaced by a
 degree of cooperation that
 ld
 wou
 seriously endanger
 25X1           China's national security.
 Seen in this perspective, events which signal sig-
 nificant or rapid progress in Soviet-US relations,
 especially in the area of strategic arms limitation,
 are likely to lead to renewed debate within China
 over the wisdom of its present stance, and could
 lead to an increase of the relative power of the
 military coalition.* Indeed, in the immediate after-
 math of the Nixon-Brezhnev summit of June 1973
 and the signing of the Soviet-US agreement on the
 prevention of nuclear war, a "sharp and intense
 struggle" occurred within Chiua over the implica-
 tions of this event. For the first time since 1969,
 Chinese propaganda stressed the theme of "col-
 lt'sion" instead of the standard line, reiterated by
 Chou at the Tenth Party Congress, that "conten-
 tie   would always predominate over collusion in
 Soviet-US relations.** Significantly, a ranking mem-
 ber of the foreign ministry establishment appears
 to have written the analysis that touched off this
 struggle, and it is probable that he was supported
 by elements within the military establishment dur-
 ing the debate. Before it had run its course, the
 moderates once again resorted to a round of vitriolic
 anti-Soviet propaganda in public and dire private
 and public warnings of the prospect of an immedi-
 ate Soviet threat. Indications trtat the military per-
 sisted in pushing for some adjustment in China's
 foreign policy stance continued until December,
 when an authoritative Red Flag article, most prob-
 ably approved by P'rao himself, criticized those who
 **One such article accused Moscow )f using the Soviet-
 US agreement on the prevention of nuclear war to proclaim
 the successes of its "peace diplomacy," while still carrying
 out "nuclear intimidation and blackmail against the people
 of various countries." NCNA also replayed   caustic article
 from a Japanese leftist journal entitled 'The Illusion and
 Truth of the US-Soviet Summit-the Real Features of Soviet
 Social Imperialism." Brethnev's goal in the summit talks,
 the article argued, was to "strengthen the hegemonic rule
 of the two superpowers": the article also warned that world
 issues should not he settled by the "wisdom" of the super-
 powers. Similar themes were evident in a theoretical article
 in Red Flag which reflected extreme sensitivity to Brezh-
 nev's boast that the political climate of the world is deter-
 mined by the Soviet Union and the US. In one of the most
 defensive statements in the piece, the article asserts that the
 US and the USSR "certainly cannot det"rmine the fate of the
 world'  since the "people and the people alone are the
 motive force in the making of world  hictnrv "

 wanted to make friends with China's close neigh-
 bors rather than ally with distant nations. And
 while =.t cannot be demonstrated conclusively, it
 seem" likely that the massive reassignment of Mili-
 taiy Reg-onal Commanders that Mao ordered in
 December 1973 was partially motivated by con-
 tinued opposition within thA military establishment
 to Mao's "revolutionary line in foreign policy." Since
 this reshuffle, it has appeared at various times that
 Mao was preparing a massive purge of those ele-
 ments in the military that were still resisting him
 and his policies, and there are some indications that
 he is  presently  displeased  that  this  has  not
 occurred.*
 The important point to note here, however, is
 that the military coalition remains an influential
 factor in Chinese politics, and that US policy and
 action toward the Soviet Union, especially on the
 issue of SALT, could have an important impact
 on the configuration of political power within
 China.
 B. The Level of Tension
 ON erall, tension in Sino-Soviet relations has de-
 clined since 1969, in large measure because the
 moderate policy coalition has extended its control,
 the internal situation has become somewhat more
 stable, and China has received grea:2r recognition
 from the international community. Nevertheless,
 tension could easily again flare up if during the
 protracted and delicate succession process already
 and,,r way, a group within China were to become
 predominant which judges that its interests woulra
 be served by a provocation such as the 1969 border
 clash. Whether or not such a situation evolves
 depends in part on events outside China in genera'
 and on the actions of the USSR and the US in
 particular.
 US moves which would enhance China's status,
 such as establishing full diplomatic relations, would
 probably strengthen the ,noderates' hold on power
 and their commitment to the policy of expanding
 ties with non-Ccminunist countries. Paradoxically,
 such developments would probably also serve to
 lessen the imperatives pressing elements in the Chi-
 nese leadership toward periodic crises with the
 USSR. Nc' only would the leadership have a de-
 creased nc::d to play up the Soviet threat to deflect
 attack from domestic critics, but-with more self-
 confidence regarding China's status in the interna-
 tional hierarchy-these leaders would probably be
 more willing to en*-er into serious negotiations with
 Lie Soviets over the border issue. If Moscow were
 careful to take Chinese sensitivities into considera-
 tion by making a substantial conciliatory gesture
 (such as a sizable drawdown of its forces in the
 border area), some fonn of mutually acceptable
 border arrangement could conceivably be worked
 out.
 Even if some form of border arrangement were
 concluded, Sino-Soviet competition and contention
 would not cease. While the primary impact of a
 border arrangement would be to decrease substan-
 tially the chances of some future border incident
 escalating into a nuclear war, China's interests
 are at odds with the USSR's throughout Asia,
 and a border agreement would not end the struggle
 for influence and power there and in the rest of
 the world.
 Moreover, even if there were some improvement
 in Sino-Soviet relations, the US would still have le-
 verage for maintaining Sino-Soviet competition. The
 moderates, having been strengthened by normaliza-
 tion of the Sino-US relations, would probably allow
 the logic of their thesis on enhancing China's status
 to carry them even further in their pragmatic search
 for power and prestige through conventional di-
 plomacy and economic development. Indeed, given
 the right circumstances, a moderate Chinese gov-
 ernment might in the future be amenable to expand-
 ing substantially its cultural, economic, and even
 military ties with the West in general and the US
 in particular. Should the Sino-US relationship ad-
 vance along these lines, there is little doubt that
 there would be serious Soviet concern, and that
 this would express itself in increased Sino-Soviet
 tension.
 At the same time, expanded ties with the US
 would over ti: -ie directly or indirectly provide
 greater resources for meeting the military coalition's
