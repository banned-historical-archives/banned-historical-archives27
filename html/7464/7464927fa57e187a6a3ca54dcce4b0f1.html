 A Coeference of Organisations Representing
 More Than Fifty Million Americans
 VIGILANT PATRIOT RECOGNITION AWARDS for 1960
 The A 1-American Conference to Combat Communism serves as a meeting ground
 and clears   house for some fifty national women's, youth, religious, profession-
 al, civic, fraternal and veterans' organizations.  The Conference is non-partisan.
 It disseminates objective information about communist intentions and tactics to
 guide member organizations in their efforts to preserve freedom.
 The C reference also sponsors KNOW YOUR AMERICA Week each year to promote a
 fuller knowledge and appreciation of our Country and the principles for which it
 stands.  T fie Conference's monthly publication, Freedom's Facts Against Communism,
 reports on Communist activities which endanger those principles.
 The V GILANT PATRIOT RECOGNITION Awards Program, established by the Confer-
 ence in 1959, again this year offers National Honor Awards for outstanding contri-
 butions in defense of freedom by individuals, groups and organizations.  During
 the past twelve years, the onward march and menace of world communism has assailed
 and attempted to enslave millions more.  There is need NOW as never before for
 VALIANT PATRIOT effort in defense of human   eeMom.
 To stimulate such effort VIGILANT PATRIOT RECOGNITION Awards again are offhred
 in 1960 for outstanding contributions in a variety of categories including Edito-
 rials, Cartoons, Public Addresses, Radio and Television programs, published arti-
 cles and pamphlets.  A special category provides RECOGNITION Awards for especially
 effective observance programs marking KNOW YOUR AMERICA Week.
 Nominations may be addressed informally to the undersigned on or before Octo-
 ber 15, 1960.  Supporting documentation should include dated copies of published
 articles, editorialsqand cartoons; typescripts of public addresses with date and
 lace of dglivr~r; scripts or recordings of radio programs and films and or
 se  pts of television entries with date of telecast, etc.
 Docum ntation should be in coordinated binder or folder form.  It should in-
 clude matettials enabling objective evaluation by the judges--statement of purpose,
 form of organization, participating groups, programs, texts, reports and newspaper
 clips; photographs, etc., evidencing public reaction.
 All 1960 entries must represent or relate to activities produced, released,

 A PUBLICATION OF THE ALL-AMERICAN CONFERENCE TO COMBAT COMMUNISM
 917 15TH STREET, N.W.   WASHINGTON 5, D.C.
 Vol. 8, No. 8                                                       August, 1960
 THE FREE WORLD VS. THE COMMUNIST BLOC
 TODAY'S PRECARIOUS BALANCE OF FORCES
 The Russian Communists' official Party magazine, "Kommunist," warned the Party members
 last month not to underestimate the strength of the free world.
 While the upsurge of revolutionary activity in Africa, the Middle East and Cuba gives Com-
 munists a chance to spread their power, the magazine warned against pushing too far, too fast,
 and, by doing so, set off a hydrogen war.
 "Kommunist" stated that the Communist bloc expected to reach a predominant position in
 the world in about ten years and then would be able to force the free world to the wall without
 the danger of nuclear war.
 Meantime, the Communist policy was to step up the class war and even revolution inside
 countries of the free world while maintaining a policy of peaceful co-existence between states
 of differing social and political systems.
 Russian Vs. Red Chinese Estimates
 The Russian Communist estimate of the balance of power with the free world differs from
 that of the Red Chinese. In August 1958, Chinese Reds figured that Communists ruled about
 1,000,000,000 people; capitalist ruled only 400,000,000 people who were "divided and at odds";
 and the rest were either neutral or were fighting for independence from the capitalist camp.
 This meant the Communist forces already were stronger than those of the free world.
 Every bit of recent evidence indicates that the Red Chinese still believe in their estimate,
 and are pushing for a much more active aggression against the free world in South Korea, South
 Viet Nam, and Formosa than they recently did in Tibet and now are in Nepal.
 What the Russian Communists see, however, is that the free world is still much stronger
 economically, and at least as strong, if not actually stronger, militarially. They want to wait
 until Communist total power - human, economic and military - is predominant before pushing
 for a final decision with the U. S.
 The Communists expect to reach this point in just ten years. Every loss the free world
 suffers in the meantime will shorten that brief period in Communist calculations.

 COMMUNISTS, POLITICS AND THE FARM VOTE
 When Soviet Premier said June 21 that he wanted Americans to elect a President with
 whom he could deal, he put himself openly in the U.S. election campaign.
 Much of the trouble he has been causing in the Congo, West Berlin, Cuba and elsewhere
 can be credited, in part, to a desire to show how unpleasant Communists can be when we refuse
 to deal with them on their terms.
 The implied message is that a more concilliatory U.S. Government could avoid these day-
 to-day crises. But the price would be high. It would mean agreeing to some major Communist
 proposals - disarmament on Soviet terms; abandonment of West Berlin, Cuba and Formosa; recog-
 nition of Communist China; and a policy of slow surrender to the "inevitable" Communist world
 victory.
 Now, lacking a Presidential candidate to their liking, U.S. Communists are pursuing their
 aims by pushing for the election of senators and congressmen, state, county and city officials who
 will further their policies or, at least, will not strongly oppose them.
 Sights On Future, Too
 While they hope to make gains in the 1960 elections, Communists really have their sights
 on 1962, 1964, 1966 and 1968. They are, in fact, using the 1960 campaigns as staging grounds
 for a new third party. They want this to be a farmer-labor party which they can use as a vehicle
 for gaining supreme political power in the U.S.
 Farm support is essential to this scheme. And Communists right now are openly after farm
 support.
 Writing in "World Marxist Review" (June 1960), John Hellman pictures U.S. agriculture
 in the stereotype of class warfare. On one hand he sees some 2,000,000 "poor" farmers being
 forced off the farm or into part-time off-farm work. On the other hand he sees farms which are
 growing in size, productivity, efficiency and income.
 The Communist approach is to appeal to the "poor" farmers, to rally them to line up with
 Communist leadership against the "monopolies," that is, against the big farmers and the urban
 industries. And this is how they are trying to do it.
 First - attack current farm programs; say they help only the big farmers and the monop-
 olies. (Fact: while far from ideal, current policies reward efficiency, productivity, ability
 and market knowledge.) Also, Communists will oppose alI current efforts to impr'oove the lot o..__
 the so-called inefficient or marginal farmers through rural development, location of industries
 in rural areas, and training farmers for urban jobs. (This would keep these farmers "poor" and
 on the farm . )
 A Tricky Farm Program
 Second - offer a farm program which would (1) give price supports to each farmer to the
 extent needed to sustain a family farmer, (2) create agrarian reform in the South (break up large
 land holdings, give plots to individual farmers), (3) give more federal aid, credit and crop in-
 surance to small farmers, (4) use U.S. surpluses to improve the U.S. diet, not for foreign aid,
 (5) lift all restrictions of foreign trade (which would remove all limits on trade with Russia and
 Red China), and (6) provide minimum wage and social security protection for all agricultural
 workers.
 While some people may see virtues in one or another of these programs, together they add
 up to an appeal for the support of the so-called "poor" or "inefficient" farmer. He is the farmer

 being eased off the farm because he lacks the drive, the knowledge, or the capital to keep up
 with today's rapid farm progress.
 And note this. Taken all together, the Communist programs      aimed towar
 to ' sd  or ing
 human problems, but toward making them more acute by denying other employment
 farmers who cannot make a living on the farm. The idea: eventually these "poor" farmers with
 nowhere else to turn will be willing to accept Communist leadership out of their problems.

 "

 s
 The Commun
 Hellman makes a strong point that,
 active part in all forms of struggle in defense of the small farmers. . .The Party exposes monopolies
 as the chief enemy of the working farmer. . .and points the way to socialism as the only
 solution. . . .
 As farmer support for Communist leadership is developed, Party members hope to integrate
 the farmers along with the labor. Negro and small businessman support they hope to get in order
 to form the core of a new third party.
 In the meantime, 1960 political candidates and voters should note that Communists are
 busy in political activities on the grassroots level, using their appeals to gain support, throwing
 their weight behind candidates who will further their long-range plans or, at least, not oppose
 them strongly.
 Anyway you look at it, the hand of Moscow will be active in this year's U.S. elections.
 THEY'RE AGITATING FOR REVOLUTION IN LATIN AMERICA
 Eye-witness reports from Latin America paint an alarming picture. Fidel Castro's Cuban
 ambassadors are working hard to foment anti-U.S. and anti-democratic revolutions.
 Here's how it works in one key Latin American country. The Cuban Ambassador is on the
 radiotwo to three times a week. He spends many hours f Castro's revolution and tells 'vieweshow easy it would be for Indians.
 He shows s motion pictures                                                          them
 to do the some thing in their own country.
 By comparison, the American Ambassador is representing the United States in the time-
 honored traditions of correct but futile diplomacy. The some story is being repeated all over
 Latin America. Fidelistas are appealing to the people to take affairs sinto their own hands, to
 revolt, and-to throw out the Yankees. "Cuba, yes,
 Aim To Clip U.S. Wings
 objective on
 Before his surprise visit to the Big Brothers in Moscow, Raul Castro laid his oI
 the line. Said Fidel's younger brother on June 20, 1960, "The more prestige the Cuban revolu-
 tion acquires, the less feathers the imperial eagle (of the U.S.) will have and the lower it will
 fly until, soon, it will not fly at all."
 What's the effect of all this in Latin America? There have been pro-Castro, anti-U.S.
 student riots in Panama; student demonstrations for Castro in Mexico and Nicaragua; demonstra-
 tions in Guatemala which were brought under control only by declaring a state of seige.
 In none of these and other reports from Latin American countries is there any basis for
 complacency or for business as usual. The long-term Communist plan, hatched out by the old

 How Much Communist Drift In Cuba?
 The Communist plan already has gone a long way inside Cuba, much farther than most
 people of the free world realize. Behind the wild TV talkathons, the conflicting and confusing
 reports of events, the Communist plan is moving ahead. Here are some of the developments re-
 ported by the National ,Committee of the Popular Socialist Party of Cuba, Cuba's Communist
 Party.
 1 . Agrarian reform. This consists of taking land away from the owners and in forming
 cooperatives run by the state, not by individual farmers.
 2. Establishment of hundreds of "peoples' shops" designed to squeeze out the small retail
 merchant in the countryside and face him with starvation or complete surrender to the state
 domination.
 3. A purge in the trade unions, in which free trade unionists are being forced out so that
 unions will have no opposition to controlling labor on behalf of state-determined objectives at
 state-determined wages and working conditions.
 4. Development of a worker-peasant militia to exert force against land owners and
 businessmen, serve as a counter-balance to the army, and as a constant threat of terror in the
 countryside.
 5. State ownership of land, minerals, and other resources is spreading rapidly, and control
 of the economy is being concentrated in a central planning commission with central state owner-
 ship, management and control of all aspects of the economy.
 bloc. 6. Aid in terms of credits, trade, and technicians is flowing into Cuba from the Communist
 7. Cuban propaganda against the U.S., against the Catholic Church, against all aspects
 of the free world is growing inside Cuba and throughout Latin America.
 Cuban People Betrayed
 What do Cuban people think about all'this? Reports coming in indicate they believe that
 the revolution has been betrayed. Castro and Guevara have tricked them into kicking out one
 dictator only to establish a more totalitarian dictatorship.
 But as individuals, many are now afraid to speak up. They see the purges coming when
 anti-Castro, anti-Communist views will mean imprisonment, hard labor, or death. Some arrests
 already have been reported. Cuba's Communists report, "Anti-communism still exists in the
 minds of some revolutionaries, although fewer and fewer people are being enslaved by it."
 Of course you do not hear Marxism-Leninism mentioned often in Cuba, but, say the Com-
 munists, it is not necessary to talk about this as long as you follow the "universal truths of
 Marxism-Leninism" toward the common great goal of Communism.
 Communism is the goal toward which the rulers of Cuba today are headed. It appears to
 be their goal in every country in which Castro Cubans act as Ambassadors, as agitators, as
 spokesmen of Fidel ism.
 We must not be surprised that Moscow urges "Hands Off Cuba " just as Moscow urged
 "Hands Off Guatemala" when Communists were taking over control there. The lesson of Guatemala
 is that when the people recognize the nature of Communist tyranny, and while they still have a
 spirit of resistance, freedom has a chance to triumph. The chance, however, will not be there
 forever.

 CAPTIVE NATIONS WEEK - 1960 RESULTS
 Millions of Americans took part in Captive Nations Week observances on July 17 to 23.
 There were special services in synagogues and churches. There were hundreds of special meetings,
 observances and rallies.
 Through all of these events in many key cities Americans expressed their support for the
 hopes of captive peoples for freedom and national independence. They pledged themselves to
 struggle by every peaceful means to obtain self-determination and freedom for all captive
 peoples.
 At the rally in Washington, D.C. the Hon. George W. Abbott, Solicitor of the Department
 of the Interior, declared that "as long as any nation is unfree, no nation can be completely free."
 A former Cuban businessman and lay religious leader, Miguel Kohly, said 90 percent of his
 countrymen were dedicated to freedom, but the remaining 10 percent were leading the "boldest
 piracy in history." His Excellency II Kwon Chung, Ambassador of Korea, declared that there is
 no place for compromise or neutrality in the fight against Communism, and added that freedom
 has never burned brighter in the bosoms of Koreans.
 _
 A Hungarian Freedom Fighter Speaks
 At the same rally an anonymous Hungarian. "freedom fighter" made an eloquent plea.
 Speaking for peoples of the captive nations he declared, "We, members of the captive East
 European nations, turn to you, representatives of the free countries. We turn to you from the
 worst kind of slavery, pleading with you to deliver us from this hell on earth. We plead with
 you first of all in the name of the Creator, who blessed you with all the beauties, wealth and
 I iberty, leaving us the sorrow, suffering and captivity. Sorrow and suffering are easier to bear,
 but it is captivity against which we rebel and beg you to aid us in casting off our yoke.
 "If things go on the way they have during the immediate past, the tactics of the Commu-
 nists will conquer every country, one by one. If you, the strongest, are afraid, what can you
 expect of the really weak? With determination and courage you could save the oppressed and,
 automatically, save yourselves. The price of your freedom is our freedom."
 Senator Kenneth Keating (R., N.Y.), in a statement on the occasion of Captive Nations
 Week declared, "Their cause is our cause, their sorrow must be our sorrow, for freedom is a
 brotherhood or it is nothing. God made us to be free, and under God we must pledge to one
 another, across the oceans, across the curtains of iron, that freedom is not a separate destiny,
 but a common destiny . . . no free man can have ease of mind while his neighbors are shackled
 by the brutal chains of the sworn enemy of freedom."
 The Impact On Communists
 What impact did statements like these have upon the Communists in Moscow and in other
 Communist-ruled captials? Radio Moscow attacked Captive Nations Week even more bitterly
 this year than last. Claimed Commentator Orlov on July 19, the Americans cannot "stomach
 the fraternal relations of equal cooperation and mutual assistance within. the socialist system,
 for all this is in sharp contrast to their own relations with small or weaker countries, a clearcut
 instance of which are the recent imperialist intrigues, conspiracies, and interventions against
 Cuba and the Republic of Congo."
 Communist propagandists in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Estonia, Albania and
 other nations attacked Captive Nations Week as "a lying campaign," as a "slanderous campaign,"
 and as "a provocative act," which could only "make the world public laugh."
 The wide-spread and bitter Communist attack against Captive Nations Week by itself indi-
 cates that the truths proclaimed by the Week's activities have hit a sensitive spot in the Communist

 armor. The Communist-propagated fiction that captive nations are free and equal partners in
 the Communist bloc is exploded by the grovelling subservience of Communist rulers of the captive
 nations to every order and whim of the top Russian Communist.
 Plan For The Future
 Captive peoples are not free to select their own government, make their own laws, run
 their economy, or decide for themselves the kind of lives they want to lead. All decisions are
 made by the State and the Party and both are run from Moscow.
 Captive Nations Week exposed the truth of Communist tyranny to the world, and Commu-
 nists were hurt. They admit the truth of the charge when they deny the captive people the right
 to self-determination by a free and secret vote. They know that if captive peoples have the
 chance, they will throw the Russian Communists and their minions out of power.
 By voicing this truth with strength and with conviction, Captive Nations Week puts the
 Communist masters on the defensive before their own people and before the world. The effec-
 tiveness of Captive Nations Week suggests that the struggle needs to be increased through par-
 ticipation of more millions of peoples of the free world. The struggle must continue until all
 captive peoples can say to the Reds: Stop running our country and our lives. Go home. We
 don't want you here.
 KHRUSHCHEV LECTURES RUSSIAN TEACHERS ON EDUCATING
 THE NEW COMMUNIST MAN
 Russian education, so lauded by visiting Americans a few years ago, is in the midst of a
 vast reorganization. The objective, according to Soviet Premier Khrushchev, is "the education
 of a new man."
 Khrushchev told the All-Union Conference of Teachers in the Kremlin on July 9 that,
 "The main thing in the reorganization of the school is the fusing of education with socially use-
 ful and productive labor and strengthening of the work of the school in bringing up its pupils.
 The struggle for the victory of Communism demands an all-around harmonious development of the
 Soviet man."
 The "new man," he said, must have wide knowledge, able hands, and an ardent heart.
 He must love to work for the common well -being and have "supreme devotion to Communism."
 "We are all gladened by the work of numerous pupils in production brigades," Khrushchev
 said. "But toil of pupils is not important in itself. The most important thing is to train in youth
 the love for toil for the common welfare. The school must inculcate in pupils the ability to work
 collectively and ultimately the ability to live in a Communist manner."
 Hardwork And Collective Living
 What does this mean? Lenin said it meant "voluntary labor, labor in excess of norms,
 labor given without counting on rewards, labor through the habit of working for the common
 welfare, labor as a requirement of a healthy organism." It means life in a collective or a com-
 mune in which the individual is 100% subordinated to the group.
 Khrushchev explained that people need knowledge in order to live and understand their
 role in society, even if their role is to be a swine herd. An easy attitude toward this cannot be
 tolerated, Khrushchev said. Production training, particularly, is needed for the determination
 of vocations, organization of workshops, compilation of programs, and training of instructors, to
 be conducted with the prospects of development of each economic area.

 Family Not Exempt From Party Prying
 Since the new man must build Communism and live under it, Khrushchev told the teachers
 to improve the ideological training of pupils. Nor is family training to be exempt from Party
 eyes. "It is necessary that Party organization consider questions of the rearing of children in the
 family. Family conditions must be regarded as one of the very important sectors of Party work.
 All working people should be educated in the sense of responsibility for raising and, as in any
 other issue, the Communists must set an example in this."
 Of course, said Khrushchev, there is a problem with the children of "responsible workers,"
 meaning high Party officials. Any laxity with them, he warned, any award of high grades for
 poor work, will prepare that child not for overcoming difficulties, but by so doing "you weaken
 his will and create conditions in which this favor of yours, this concession . . . might be fatal."
 In summing up Khrushchev said, "The Soviet people's teacher educates and brings up
 children in the spirit of friendship and respect for all peoples, in the spirit of industriousness and
 a high standard of human consciousness. The Soviet teacher rears the young person as an honest,
 strong, and decent man, a man of toil and peace."
 But wait a moment. Does not the trainer of hunting dogs and draft animals do this much?
 He tries to train his animals to work beyond the norm without regard to reward, toil hard and to
 be loyal and peaceful. He interferes with the parents' training and does the job himself.
 What more will this new Communist man be than an intelligent, obedient, working animal?
 It is a question Russian teachers and parents, as well as American admirers of the Russian educa-
 tional methods, might well consider.
 STRAWS IN THE RED WIND
 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - At a World Peace Council meeting here on July 11, WPC
 representatives from countries bordering West Germany drafted a statement opposing the remilitari-
 zation of West Germany and opposing construction of West German military bases in Western
 Europe. The Council's action indicates an intensified Communist campaign of artification and
 hate against West Germany.
 PEIPING, (RED) CHINA - Red Chinese commentators on July 10 promised continued
 efforts inside Japan to oppose and finally nullify the Japan-U.S. security treaty. The method:
 a joint action type of mass struggle. The world saw how this works just prior to President Eisen-
 hower's planned visit to Tokyo. The Red Chinese now say this was just the beginning.
 HANOI, (COMMUNIST) VIET NAM - The Hanoi Daily, July 18, welcomed the statement
 by the World Peace Council favoring peaceful reunification of North (Communist) and South (free)
 Viet Nam. Reunification would come after the U.S. is ousted from South Viet Nam by popular
 mass action. Thus a more active Communist aggression against South Viet Nam is indicated.
 Similar steps in aggressive action have been indicated against Formosa and South Korea.
 BOGATA, COLOMBIA - On July 17, a rally of 2,000 people sponsored by the Colombian
 Communist Party praised the Cuban revolution as the "first anti-imperialist, anti-feudal revolution
 in Latin America," declared popular support for the Cubans, and promised that similar effort
 would be made to "defeat U.S.-imperialism" in Colombia.
 PEIPING, (RED) CHINA - Relations between Red China and Indonesia are at a low ebb
 because Indonesian nationalists are forcing overseas Chinese to leave Indonesia. Recently, a
 number of Chinese were killed or wounded by Indonesians. Also, Indonesians are reported treat-
 ing the Chinese to arrests, interrogations, forced occupation of Chinese-owned houses and school
 buildings. Peiping is furious.

 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - A new world-wide peace movement is being launched by the
 Communist front World Peace Council. WPC Executive President Professor John Bernal said on
 July 10 that the aim would be "to raise the popular will for disarmament to new heights and make
 it effective in forcing the governments to undertake serious disarmament negotiations." Campaign
 goals are: (1) prohibit the flights of planes carrying nuclear weapons outside the home territory,
 and (2) prohibit economic sanctions or military expeditionary forces against countries regaining
 their liberty or putting an end to exploitation by foreign monopolies. (This latter goal is aimed
 as a moral force to speed Communist revolutions in African and Latin American countries.)
 HAVANA, CUBA - Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev is seeking an invitation to at least
 one more Latin American country before he sets the final date for his visit to Cuba to "make his
 trip worth while." There is a chance that Red Chinese Chairman Mao Tse-tung may also visit
 Havana while Khrushchev is there to make a real Red Summit Meeting in Castro's capital.
 The All-American Conference to Combat Communism serves as a meeting ground and
 clearing house for some fifty national women's, youth, religious, professional, civic,
 fraternal and veterans' organizations.  The Conference is non-partisan.  It dissemi-
 nates objective information about Communist intentions and tactics to guide member
 organizations in their efforts to preserve freedom.  The Conference also sponsors Know
 Your America Week each year to promote greater knowledge of our country and the
 principles for which it stands.
