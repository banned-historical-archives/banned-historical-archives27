AMERICA'S SECRET AGENTS: 
The Mysterious Doings of CIA 
By RICHARD and GLADYS HARKNESS 
The Post presents its own exclusive report on America's 
"silent service"? the supersecret Central Intelligence 
Agency. Here, revealed for the first time, are its methods, 
how it gets its operatives and its money, and its a. ccom-
plighments?in Guatemala, Iran and behind the Iron Curtain. 
PART 
-MAN with the plump pink cheeks and blue 
eyes of a typical middle-class German sat 
on the grassy hilltop overlooking the Red 
port city of Stettin on the left bank of the 
Oder River in communist-held Poland. As he had 
done every seasonable day of last spring, he basked 
in the warm April sun while washing down his lunch 
of dry bread and sausage with a liter of white wine, 
and watched the birds in the nearby trees through 
his field glasses. Then, rising to leave, he swept his 
glasses along the piers on the river front below, where 
freighters were being loaded for the thirty-mile trip 
northward along the Oder and into the open Baltic 
Sea. 
ONE 
Returning to his small machine-tool works after 
the noon hour, the businessman called in his secre-
tary to take dictation. The letter, addressed to a 
French automobile-parts concern, was formal and 
concise in the stiff manner of German commercial 
houses. It cited precise specifications for presses his 
firm was offering for sale to stamp out motorcar 
fenders. The price was less than the British could 
quote. The machines carried the official guarantee of 
the Ministry of Machine Industry of the Polish 
People's Republic. It was a letter that the local Red 
commissar could approve ?and did. 
But do the communists know even now what the 
letter really was? The "East German businessman"

UNITED PRESS 
Col. Castillo Arm as (IA), whose American-armed 
"freedom forces" dr 3ve out Guatemala's Reds. 
and his pretty Nordic-type blond 'secretary" were 
plants of the United States' supersecret Central In-
telligence Agency. The innocent-appearing address 
on the letter was, in reality, a CIA drop in Paris. 
Once the letter from Stettin was in the hands of 
America's espionage and counterespionage service, it 
was rushed to a corn nonplace-looking shop in the 
arty Montmartre sec 'ion, where a sign on the win-
dow read SALON DE PHOTOGRAPHIE. Behind this 
front of a simple phoi ographic studio, a CIA micro-
film technician went ?Lo work. The agent, squinting 
through a magnifying glass under bright lights, 
scraped at each " period " on the typewritten page 
with a delicate, razor-sharp instrument. Finally, one 
black dot came off. There, scarcely larger than the 
point of a pin, was a tiny circle of microfilm which 
had been pasted on the sheet of paper at the end of a 
sentence. It had been disguised by the ink of the 
secretary's typewriter ribbon back in Stettin as a 
period. The agent, holding his breath lest he blow 
away the minute speck, used tweezers to carry the 
film to a photograph c enlarger. When he emerged 
from the darkroom, i he blown-up message was the 
size of a tea saucer. The words could be read as easily 
as the words on this printed page. 
In accordance with basic intelligence security, the 
message was only gibberish to the CIA microfilm 
expert. (Also in accordance with security, what ac-
tually happened in Stettin and Paris has been dis-
guised in this account.) The spy team in Stettin had 
employed a code prearranged with CIA headquarters 
in Washington. The microfilm was a cryptogram 
based on a key in the twenty-second prayer of David 
in the Book of Psalms; that mournful lamentation of 
David which begins?appropriately, in view of the 
fate of the Poles under the Russians? "My God, my 
God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" 
The next step in CIA procedure was to transmit 
the unintelligible scramble to Washington by short-
wave radio under the cipher address: "For AWD's 
eyes only." That meant: for the sole attention of 
Allen Welsh Dulles, the Government's first civilian 
director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and 
younger brother of Secretary of State John Foster 
Dulles. 
The message, decoded by a cryptographic machine 
and nronsoril?ed - purplish-bluc ink, was 
taken to Dulles in his office, where American and 
CIA flags and a huge world stereoscopic projection 
map dominate the room. Dulles worked with the 
supervising case man on this Polish project, and the 
full details of the report from Stettin are still classi-
fied top secret. But this much may be related: The 
two agents confirmed the underground route they 
planned to follow?successfully, it turned out ?in 
leaving the Red port, threading their way across 
eighty-four miles of communist-patrolled country-
side, and finding haven in a CIA "safe house" in 
West Berlin. To this may be added: When Dulles 
received the decoded message, he had information 
20 
1". 
UNITED PRESS 
The Swedish freighter Alfhem, which delivered 1900 tons of Czech munitions to Red-dominated Guate.J 
mala five months ago. When CIA agents reported the shipment, U.S. guns were flown to Colonel Armas. 
which enabled CIA to pull off one of the most suc-
cessful intelligence coups of the entire cold war. He 
was hot on the trail of proof that the communist-
dominated government of Guatemala was part and 
parcel of a Red conspiracy, hatched in Moscow, to 
give Russia a military toehold in Latin America hard 
by the Panama Canal. 
The message ? broadly paraphrased to protect 
code security ? said this: A freighter named the Alf-
hem and flying the flag of Sweden had tied up at the 
dock at Stettin. More than 15,000 crates and boxes 
had been lowered into her hold. The rumor along the 
water front was that the cargo, which arrived by rail 
from Czechoslovakia, consisted of munitions from 
the communists' Skoda arms works. 
Dulles alerted agents in Eurppe and in Africa. 
From them, replies tracing the transaction were 
rushed to Washington. Stockholm: The Alfhem was 
owned by the Swedish shipping line, Angbats A. B. 
The line had chartered the vessel to a shipping agent 
in London, E. E. Dean. London: Terms of the 
charter stipulated that Dean, a financial middleman, 
should recharter the freighter to Alfred Christianson 
in Stockholm. Stockholm: Christianson represented 
the Alfhem as carrying optical-laboratory equip-
ment and optical glass for the French West African 
port of Dakar. 
The Secret of the Devious Freighter 
ilTHER reports came into Dulles' office. Two 
drys out of Dakar, the captain received radio 
orders to change his course for Trujillo, Honduras. 
Two days out of Trujillo, the captain's orders were 
countermanded again. The Alfhem was to proceed 
and unload at Puerto Barrios, the Caribbean port 
city of Red Guatemala. 
For optical-laboratory equipment and optical 
glass, the shipment received extraordinary atten-
tion. The Guatemalan Minister of Defense was on 
hand to direct unloading of the cargo at Puerto 
Barrios. Cordons of army troops sealed off the entire 
dock area. Details of soldiers guarded the special 
military trains which sped the freight to arsenals in 
Guatemala City. Despite a junior-sized Iron Cur-
tain, Dulles again received a message: The 15,000 
unmarked wooden boxes and (Totag were of 2 size 
and weight to contain 1900 tons of small arms and 
small-arms ammunition, plus light-artillery pieces. 
Dulles called an emergency session of the Intelli-
gence Advisory Committee behind sealed doors in 
CIA headquarters. Seated around the table were the 
intelligence brains of the Federal Government ? the 
heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force intelligence, 
the intelligence officers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
the State Department and Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, and a representative of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. 
The committee, making the hours count, produced 
a quick crash estimate of the Guatemalan situation. 
Those 1900 tons of arms represented enough militarY 
might in Latin America to enable the Guatemalan 
Army to crush her neighbors, Honduras and El Sal-
vador, and to march across Nicaragua and Costa 
Rica, to the Panama Canal. 
Immediately, with no recommendation as to a 
specific line of action, but with an emphatic warnin 
that action was urgent, Dulles laid the crash esti-. 
mate before the National Security Council. The first 
evident result came two days later, on May seven-
teenth, when Secretary of State Dulles stripped the 
communist arms plot bare for all the world to see. 
The United States Government viewed the muni-
tions shipment with gravity, he said, because of its 
origin and quantity. 
Then Washington lapsed into official silence for 
a week. But, during the period ending May twenty-
fourth, the Department of Defense dispatched two 
Air .Force Globemasters over the Gulf of Mexico: 
Each plane ferried twenty-five tons of rifles, pistols; 
machine guns and ammunition to Honduras and 
Nicaragua. Now events ? some public, some veiled? ? 
were moving rapidly. 
Co]. Carlos Castillo Armas, former officer of the ? 
Guatemalan Army who was in exile in Honduras, 
obtained sufficient guns and munitions to equip! 
each man in a force of fellow anticommunist refugees! 
with a burp gun, a pistol and a machete. As he sent 
his troops across the Honduran-Guatemalan border 
.with an ultimatum to communist puppet Jacob? 
Arbenz Guzman to capitulate, Castillo dispatched 
his "air force" of two old World War II P-38 fighter 
planes to buzz Guatemala City. The Arbenz air 
force was the first to defect. The Guatemalan Army, 
fearing that the 1900 tons of Red arms from Stettin 
were actually intended for use by the communist-
dominated labor unions, refused to fight. An anti)._ 
communist junta took over the country, and a 
overt Russian threat to the Western Hemisphe ' 
was averted, at least for the present. 
Some American citizens may find it disturbing 
and even noxious for their Government?to engage in 
such clandestine activity in faraway Stettin and 
Puerto Barrios. In the live-and-let-live days after 
World War I, the late Henry L. Stimson disbanded 
the "Black Chamber" of State Department code 
exports, because "gentlemen don't read other peo-
ple's mail." Today, in this .period of cold war arter 
World War II, our Government is deeply involved 
countering Red espionage as it threatens the West-
ern democracies. 
On assignment by The Saturday Evening Post 
these two Washington correspondents set out twelve 
months ago to cover the Central Intelligence Agency 
from every angle consistent with national security 
and the public interest. Our every interview, includ-
ing talks with Government officials concerned with 
intelligence operations, and congressional leaders, 
plus exhaustive research, has had the aim of answer-
ing the question: "What is the CIA up to?"

Px-CIA boss Walter Bedell Smith with Sen. Joe 
- - McCarthy, who has said the CIA is Red-infiltrated. 
Briefly, the answer must be stated like this: We 
are too prone to view our conflict with Russia in 
terms of the worry, "When will the Reds attack us 
militarily?" We strain to arm ourselves, thinking 
only in terms of communist atomic bombs hurtling 
down on the democratic West from supersonic 
lanes. The Russians hold that fear over us while 
?,...4ey craftily go about their business of taking over 
tqrget countries from within. We plan to defend our-
selves on land, on sea and in the air, when what we 
must also do is combat the communist enemy un-
derground, where he uses the fourth dimension of 
war ?infiltration, subversion and conspiracy. 
The free world saw Poland engulfed by commu-
nism. That easy Russian conquest was gained, at 
Yalta, by deceit. Czechoslovakia lived briefly, after 
the war, in the illusion of peaceful coexistence with 
communism. But Czechoslovakia suddenly found 
her free people submerged under Russian infiltra-
tion. American military aid to the French in Indo-
china far outstripped in amount, cost and quality 
the armed support given the Vietminh rebels by the 
Chinese communists. But the Reds enveloped a vast 
area containing 12,000,000 people, the city of Hanoi 
and the rich rice fields of Northern Vietnam largely 
by infiltrating, softening up and swallowing. 
So it was ? in Guatemala. Communist 
agitators, operating in the role of reformers, began 
infiltrating the public and private organizations of 
Guatemala as long as ten years ago. Agents indoc-
trinated in such institutions as the Marx-Engels-
Lenin School in Moscow, organized the peasants and 
workers on the banana plantations. Once in control 
of such mass groups, Reds soon took over the 
official press and radio of the Guatemalan Govern-
ment. Through the technique of the political popular 
front, they dictated to the Guatemalan congress 
/ '4 president. Most alarming was the fact that the 
nmunists had not simply oozed across a frontier 
into a contiguous territory, but they were able to 
leapfrog their subversion and infiltration across the 
Atlantic and Pacific oceans to Latin America and 
its vital Panama Canal. The CIA, working with 
"freedom forces" of Guatemalans, met the Reds 
early enough to hand Russia its defeat in Guatemala. 
As of today, the intelligence experts who attempt 
to gauge Russia's long-term intentions predict that 
the communists are not now prepared for military 
global conflict. That cautious assessment is based on 
information from behind the Iron Curtain which 
may be reported here only in bare-bone outline: 
Inside Russia: Despite the hard outer shell of 
Russia's military might ?a 4,000,000-man army, 
20,000-plane air force and nuclear weapons esti-
mated in four figures?all is not rosy within the 
U.S.S.R. Communist industry is progressing reason-
ably well, spurred by an intensive program to train 
young scientists and engineers. This drive threatens 
to outstrip us in the live-or-die field of technology. 
Food?an all-important weapon in total war?is a

vexing problem, due to a breakdown in the commu-
nist collective-farming system. The Soviet recently 
was forced to divert 100,000 workers from industry 
to agriculture. Premier Malenkov is in control, but 
he ordered the liquidation of Secret Police Chief 
L. P. Beria because Beria was plotting the ?eradica-
tion of Malenkov "in two or three days." On the day 
Beria was seized, Red Army tanks rumbled into the 
outskirts of Moscow, as they did the night that 
Stalin died. So Russia's committee form of govern-
ment, with its divided power, is not an easy form to 
maintain in a dictatorship. 
Conclusion: The Politburo is quite satisfied with 
the gains communism is making with, the present 
Red technique of subvert and conquer. The men in 
the Kremlin cannot be certain, even if they launched 
open military warfare and won a global conflict, 
that their regime could survive the retaliatory wreck-
age and misery sure to be inflicted on the Russian 
tr-1 
f-
population. The Red rulers have no thought of win-
ning a war for someone else. The U.S.S.R. is worried 
lest her major ally, communist China, get a little out 
of hand. Russia does not want to be dragooned into 
armed combat with the West by Mao Tse-tung, but 
prefers, if and when she wages war, to choose the 
time and place herself ?probably not before 1957 or 
1958 at the earliest. 
The foregoing estimate of Russian plans and 
intentions is reported as no tidbit of gossip from the 
capital's cocktail-party circuit. It represents the 
warp and woof of our Government's foreign and 
domestic policy as patterned by the National Se-
curity Council. If our leaders had thought open war 
was imminent, the Administration would have spon-
sored no $7,400,000,000 reduction in Federal taxes 
at the recent session of Congress. Secretary of the 
Treasury George M. Humphrey would not be

Because of the bush-hush air surround-
ing the agency, they were voicing nat-
? , 
ural? doubts over the efficiency of the I/ 
? _1 administration of CIA, a political.. ?. 
.? 
curiosity as to the number of jobholders' ,. ? 
? 
i on its unpublished payroll, and a ques-
tioning of the reliability of CIA's 
? ," national estimates." 
, 
More recently, a direct attack on 
CIA came from Sen., Joseph. R. Mc- ?? ? . 
? Carthy, who charged that the agency f? ?s.? 
. had been infiltrated by communists. 
, The senator called the situation "even 
, more dangerous than Red penetration 
?' ? ":-1 of the Army Signal Corps' radar labora-
?' tories" at Fort Monmouth, New Jer- ? 
? 
,.t sey. He announced that he would make 
? ? CIA the next target of his Special In-?; - 
??-? 
, vestigating subcommittee. Flaunting 
his disregard of the presidential order 
safeguarding such executive secrets, 
McCarthy renewed his call on Federal 
employees 'to furnish -him with confi- ? ? 
? ? ?dential information from restricted and 
; 
,delicate agency files. 
? . +. Dulles issued one of his rare public, 
.. 
. ':statements. He called the senator's ; 
? : charges false. He revealed .,that he had' 
t- ? written McCarthy almost a year ago; ? 
. jasking for any specific allegations Mc-
. I earthy. had to offer on communists 
- ? within the CIA, but the senator, had 
.r??-.-. not even acknowledged, his letter:1 
? 
1 Dulles, expressing no doubt that Mc-'; 
? 
.'Carthy was seeking information from' 
. 
: Inside CIA, addressed a CIA orienta-
tion session with this ultimatum: "Any-1.. 
one giving Senator McCarthy CIA in- . 
t formation will be fired." .._ , 
McCarthy went ahead with his ii-i I, 
.,1 quiry, assigning the preliminary inves- I,. 
:. .tigation to Donald A. Surine, even' 
though the then McCarthy committee:: 
? '  aide had been refused clearance by the . 
Defense- Department to see classified 
Imaterial. McCarthy announced later I 
that he had conferred with a "high.' 
I 
? elected official" of the Administra a ; 
and agreed that public hearings on CIA 
? would not be in the public interest, but 
.- . he left for a vacation in Mexico, de-
. , 
- , claring his determination to probe our 
' intelligence system. 
i While McCarthy vacationed, the; 
Administration cannily froze him out; 
? of new Red-hunting headlines. The ,' 
? Hoover Government-reorganization 
commission announced that' a special 
task force would examine 'CIA. The' 
, 
' i-survey, beginning in the fall' of, 1954, 
. I was placed under the directiOn:of re-
tired Gen. Mark W. Clark. ' 
-V, ?A previous Hoover survey,(made in' 
I 1949, when CIA was two years old, heldi 
/ 
t that the agency "had not yet achieved 
is the desired degree of ,proficiency and 
? dependability in its estimates" for the 
?i National Security Council--so Mc-
1.? Carthy could not charge "whitewash." 
i, During the hearing into his controversy 
1 with the Army, the senator had singled 
. ' out General Clark for special praise?
. so he could not cry "hand-picked judge."
