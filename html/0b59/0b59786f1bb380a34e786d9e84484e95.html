 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST RELATIONS          .   .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .    .  . .  Page 1
 In his speech to the Supreme Soviet on 5 May, Khru-
 shchev resorted to a time-honored Soviet device on the eve
 of important East-West negotiations which is designed to
 place the Western powers, particularly the United States,
 on the defensive and to demonstrate that the USSR's peace-
 ful coexistence line does not result from any weakness the
 West could exploit in summit talks.   In general he sharply
 criticized the West's attitude toward the summit, and,
 specifically, he:charged violations of Soviet air space by
 American aircraft.  The speech probably was also intended
 to warn against any exaggerated expectations in the Com-
 munist world regarding the outcome of the Paris meeting
 and to prepare the ground for blaming American "insincerity"
 should the talks break down.   Khrushchev's reaffirmation
 at the end of his speech of his desire for a "mutually
 acceptable agreement" apparently was designed to reassure
 Western leaders and to forestall speculation that he has
 lost interest in summit negotiations.
 KHRUSHCHEV SHAKES UP TOP SOVIET LEADERSHIP .
 shchev's designated successor has been strengthened.
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 4
 The Soviet leadership shake-up on 4 May is the most
 extensive since the defeat of the Malenkov-Molotov "anti-
 party" group in 1957.  The evidence indicates that the
 changes were made at Khrushchev's direction.  The net re-
 sult is that the Khrushchev-Mikoyan-Kozlov team appears to
 be stronger than ever, and Frol Kozlov's position as Khru-
 cratic party.
 TURKISH DEMONSTRATIONS . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 5
 The demonstrations in Turkey against the government
 of Premier Menderes have subsided, but students are still
 determined to carry on the struggle and new outbreaks are
 possible.  The government appears determined to crush the
 opposition Republican People's party and, now that the NATO
 meeting in Istanbul has ended, may use the rioting as an
 excuse for proscribing the party and arresting its leaders.
 Premier Menderes and President Bayar are reported also
 apprehensive over possible defections from their Demo-
 CONFi?ENTiA

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1960
 PART I  (continued)
 SOUTH KOREA UNDER HUH CHUNG   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     .  .  .  .  .
 The South Korean public appears to desire a return to
 peaceful conditions, but students have renewed demonstra-
 tions, demanding that a new National Assembly be elected
 before changes are made in the constitution.             Should pro-
 longed political bickering appear to preclude a clean
 sweep of the old regime, the general public might again
 join the students in agitating against the government.
 Acting Chief of State Huh Chung, a political independent,
 apparently sees himself as more than a caretaker.  His
 early moves have been intended to gain popular support,
 .  Page 6
 and he may emerge as a new political power in South Korea.
 CUBA AND THE CARIBBEAN .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  Page 8
 The Castro regime, which is steadily strengthening
 its ties with the Sino-Soviet bloc,        is becoming further
 isolated from other Latin American governments.    Vene-
 zuela's Betancourt is now included among the democratic
 Latin American presidents being attacked by Cuban Govern-
 ment media.  Betancourt says he is completely disenchanted
 with Castro and would be happy to play a leading role in
 focusing hemisphere attention on the Cuban problem, pro-
 vided Dominican dictator Trujillo were ousted first.   In the
 Dominican Republic, the church-state conflict is intensi-
 fying,
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 MAY DAY IN THE COMMUNIST BLOC   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  Page 1
 May Day was observed throughout the bloc with the
 usual massive parades and Communist-style hoopla.             In Mos-
 cow, rockets and missiles were displayed for the first
 time since November 1957, but no important new equipment
 was shown.  Crowds were notably apathetic in Eastern Europe.
 The traditional tremendous parade in Peiping was given up
 this year in favor of smaller, dispersed celebrations
 throughout the country.  This, says Peiping, will be the
 pattern for future May Days in order to allow the greatest
 number of people to participate.

 .  Page 2
 Collective farms in the USSR, primarily those near
 major urban centers and on marginal land, are rapidly being
 converted to state farms.         The regime expects by this means
 to promote greater specialization of production and to re-
 duce costs.  The process is also consistent with the re-
 gime's long-range goal of eliminating the differences be-
 tween state and collective farms.
 .  Page 3
 Articles in Yugoslav journals in recent months indi-
 cate more unrest among party intellectuals than at any
 time since the Djilas affair in 1954.  The basic issue is
 how far Yugoslavia can evolve toward Western concepts in
 its political program.  Tito, who over the years has bor-
 rowed heavily from the West in developing his economic pro-
 gram,  is apparently having difficulty limiting the influ-
 ence of Western thought.
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  5
 Some 15,500 East German refugees--farmers, small
 businessmen, and youths--fled to West Berlin in April,
 despite the regime's intensified efforts to stop the flow.
 A new element is the large number of youths escaping from
 the regime's drive to place them on collective farms.
 The regime blames the Evangelical clergy for the flights,
 hoping thereby to counteract the effects of that church's
 criticism of the oppressive methods used to collectivize
 the farmers.
 MOSCOW SHIFTS TACTICS TOWARD SOVIET EMIGRES   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 7
 Soviet propaganda toward emigrds no longer urges re-
 patriation but rather tries to instill a feeling of patri-
 otism and to. encourage spiritual and cultural ties with
 the homeland.  Moscow probably believes that most emigrds
 who would return have already done so in response to the
 vigorous "return to the homeland" campaign of recent years
 and that the problem now is to organize and make more ef-
 fective use of those remaining abroad.
 SOVIET-PAKISTANI RELATIONS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 8
 The USSR, as part of its extensive effort to exploit
 contacts between Khrushchev and free world leaders, has
 sounded out the Ayub government on several recent occasions
 to determine whether such visits have produced any change
 in Pakistan's cool attitude toward bloc countries.   Since
 Moscow continues to support Afghanistan and to censure
 Pakistan for participating in Western military alliances,

 PART II (continued)
 Soviet diplomatic feelers seem designed primarily to
 arouse fears among Pakistan's allies of revision of
 Rawalpindi's strongly anti-Communist policies.
 ADDITIONAL PAKISTANI CABINET CHANGES .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  9
 President Ayub apparently intends to relieve ambi-
 tious Lieutenant General Sheikh of his duties as minister
 of interior within a few weeks and appoint him permanently
 to the less powerful Ministry of Food and Agriculture.
 The departure of Lieutenant General Azam Khan from the
 cabinet to assume the governorship of East Pakistan has
 already stimulated extensive rumors about rivalries within
 the government.                                                                  25X1
 PREMIER NU CONSOLIDATES HIS CONTROL IN BURMA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  10
 Premier Nu's return to effective control of the
 Burmese Government has been assisted by General Ne Win's
 determination to withdraw the army from open participa-
 tion in political affairs.  The new government's programs
 are designed to produce a rapid return to pre-1958 condi-
 tions of party politics and appear intended to eliminate,
 as far as possible, all reminders of the army regime.  Al-
 though government efficiency and integrity may decline,
 the army will continue its behind-the-scenes watchdog role.
 INDONESIAN ARMY INTENTIONS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  Page  11
 The Indonesian Army is encouraging the anti-Communist
 Democratic League and the league's anti-Sukarno press cam-
 paign, with the immediate objective of preventing installa-
 tion of President Sukarno's appointed parliament.                               Sukarno,
 who is still abroad, reportedly has been extremely irritated
 by these activities and may even dismiss army chief Nasution.
 Dutch plans to send naval units on a six-month flag-showing
 cruise to Far.Eastern waters could be exploited by Sukarno
 to drum up an anti-Dutch propaganda drive which could unite
 all Indonesian factions.
 Page  12
 Political activity in the Congo, centered about the
 legislative elections scheduled for 11 to 25 May, has been
 marked by the Communists' efforts-to increase their in-
 fluence in the Belgian colony.  Although no single party
 is expected to control the legislature, the group led by
 Patrice Lumumba--one of several enjoying Communist support--
 is expected to make a strong show ing.  The imminence of
 African rule on 30 June has increased restiveness among the
 Europeans in the Congo.

 NATIONALIST AGITATION OVER PORTUGUESE AFRICA  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 13
 Portugal's African possessions are likely to come
 under increasing attack from nationalist and exile move-
 ments supported by independent African states
 Agitators in the Belgian Congo are attempting to arouse
 nationalist sentiment in Angola.  Although the internal
 situation in the Portuguese territories remains calm,
 Lisbon's rule will be subjected to growing pressure as a
 ditional areas come under African control.
 MIDDLE EAST HIGHLIGHTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 15
 The Arab boycott of US shipping which began at mid-
 night 29 April has gained momentum, with dockworkers'
 unions or governments in almost all Arab states having ex-
 pressed their determination to implement it.  Most Ameri-
 can-flag ships have been diverted from Arab ports.                                     In
 Lebanon, despite this week's violent Christian-Moslem in-
 cidents, President Shihab has scheduled parliamentary
 elections beginning 12 June.  The political influence of
 the Iraqi Army will be increased as a result of Qasim's
 reshuffle of the cabinet following the resignation of
 competent, conservative Finance Minister Hadid.   In this
 week's Afro-Asian Economic Conference in Cairo, the UAR
 took the lead in thwarting attempts by representatives
 from Sino-Soviet bloc states to increase their influence
 in the organization.                                            25X1

 The British public's demands for unilateral British
 nuclear disarmament have become markedly stronger in recent
 weeks, and there is growing pressure on the Labor party
 leaders.to abandon their  support of an independent nuclear
 'deterrent.  As suggested in part by the recent parliamen-
 tary debate on the government's abandonment of the Blue
 Streak missile project, Labor leadersappear to be
 preparing for a new compromise to accommodate their, critics.
 This situation adds to the pressures on the Macmillan gov-
 ernment to show some tangible progress on disarmament.

 Economic Community (EEC) in the next few months.  Plans
 for sach?an election--provided for in general terms in both
 the EEC and EURATOM treaties--will probably be approved
 soon by the assembly, but ratification by the member gov-
 ernments will be difficult to obtain.  Proposals by European
 federalists that the limited powers of the assembly be in-
 creased have virtually no prospect of adoption at this time.
 US BASE IN TRINIDAD FACES HARASSMENT . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 20
 Trinidad's termination on 30 April of the use by US
 military planes of the island's only operational airport
 may presage other moves which would limit effective use
 of the Chaguaramas naval base and missile-tracking station.
 Premier Williams, who has strong anti-US prejudices, has
 long campaigned for full participation in the planned re-
 vision of the 1941 US-UK agreement on West Indies bases
 and for obtaining at least part of Chaguaramas for the
 federal capital.  Other harassments he has hinted at in-
 clude cutting the base's power supply, fomenting labor
 troubles, delaying movements in and out, and elaborating
 his charges that the base is a source of radiation hazards.
 PARAGUAYAN EXILES LAUNCH NEW INVASION   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 22
 The Stroessner regime in Paraguay, increasingly in
 the spotlight as the last dictatorship in South America,
 has encountered another exile invasion attempt.        The
 Argentina-based effort, which began on 29 April, now ap-
 pears to have faltered, but on 3 May a new small-scale
 thrust occurred in the northeast along the Brazilian bor-
 der.  The armed forces,  loyal to the Stroessner regime,
 are said to be confident they can control the situation.
 THE TAMBRONI GOVERNMENT   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 23
 The all - Christian Democratic minority government of
 Fernando Tambroni has won investiture in the Italian Sen-
 ate after pledging itself to a six-month tenure limited to
 caretaker functions.  The opposition parties of the left
 may still renew their efforts to overthrow Tambroni in the
 lower house, but with no prospect of success barring an un-
 likely breach of party discipline by Christian Democratic
 left-wingers.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 KHRUSHCHEV AT THE SUMMIT  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 1
 Khrushchev probably views the summit meeting which
 opens in Paris on 16 May not as a decisive confrontation
 with the West but as a new and important stage in a pro-
 tracted period of high-level negotiations.   This view-
 point and the opportunity for further bilateral discussions
 during President Eisenhower's visit to the USSR in June
 probably preclude any move to force a showdown at the sum-
 mit itself or in the period immediately after.  Khrushchev's
 principal efforts probably will be focused on obtaining a
 general statement on Berlin which the USSR could then rep-
 resent as marking Western acceptance of the principle that
 the Berlin situation is "abnormal" and should be modified
 in the direction of ending the "occupation regime" in West

 Off' IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 Khrushchev climaxed his
 pre-summit maneuvers with a
 speech to the Supreme Soviet
 on 5 May in which he resorted
 to a time-honored Soviet device
 --used frequently on the eve
 of important negotiations--
 which is designed to place the
 Western powers on the defen-
 sive and to demonstrate that
 the USSR's peaceful coexistence
 policy does not result from any
 weakness the West could exploit
 at the negotiating table,
 The Soviet premier gave a
 pessimistic assessment of pros-
 pects for agreement at the sum-
 mit, citing recent Western pol-
 icy statements and actions as
 providing little ground for
 hope that the Western leaders
 "are really looking for con-
 crete solutions."  He charged
 that "aggressive forces" in the
 United States recently have in-
 tensified their efforts to
 "wreck the summit conference,
 or at least prevent it from
 reaching agreements."
 Although Khrushchev's ref-
 erences to President Eisenhower
 were couched in moderate terms,
 he went further in criticizing
 the President than at any time
 since his visit to the United
 States.  He remarked that re-
 cent speeches by American
 spokesmen were an "ill omen"
 for a "favorable outcome" at
 the summit and said this situa-
 tion has been "aggravated" by
 the "unfortunate fact that even
 the American President approved
 these speeches."  He expressed
 regret that President Eisen-
 hower intended to limit his
 presence at the summit to only
 seven days and observed that
 this shows that questions to be
 discussed in Paris "do not en-
 joy due attention on the part
 of the United States Government."
 Khrushchev apparently in-
 tends to build up his charges of
 recent violations of Soviet
 air space by US aircraft into a
 major international issue. He de-
 nounced these flights as a "di-
 rect provocation" and announced
 that the USSR would bring these
 incidents before the UN Security
 Council.  He charged that the
 incidents were timed to coincide
 with the summit meeting and that
 the United States is seeking to
 weaken the USSR's "determina-
 tion to fight for a relaxation
 of international tension and an
 end to the cold war and arms
 race."
 In an effort to portray
 American policy as irresponsible
 and provocative and to generate
 widespread public alarm-over
 its possible consequences, Khru-
 shchev warned that the USSR re-
 serves the right to reply to
 "such aggressive actions" in
 the future "with measures which
 we shall find necessary to ensure
 the safety of our country." With-
 out committing the USSR to such
 a course, he attempted to convey
 the notion that it would employ
 missile retaliation.
 Khrushchev's threat to
 bring the issue before the
 Security  Council closely
 parallels a Soviet  move call-
 ing an emergency                                                            session of

 armed bombers over the Arctic
 "in the direction of the fron-
 tiers of the USSR." This move
 coincided with the beginning
 of the abortive preparatory
 talks in Moscow to arrange a
 pre-summit foreign ministers'
 conference.   The 1958 maneuver
 culminated  in ' a  veto 'bSr-,the
 '8oviet  Union  of  an' Amer-
 ican r6solut ion ` calling `for an
 Arctic inspection system to re-
 duce the danger of surprise at-
 tack.
 In addition to the primary
 effort to discredit the United
 States on the eve of the summit
 meeting, Khrushchev's speech
 probably was calculated to warn
 against any exaggerated expecta-
 tions in the Communist world
 regarding the outcome of the
 Paris talks, which he has been
 careful to portray as only
 the first of a series of such
 negotiations.   Khrushchev's
 harsh criticism of the United
 .States may also be intended to
 prepare a case for blaming
 American "insincerity" should
 the talks break down.
 Having .nvoked the threat
 of a new and dangerous crisis,
 Khrushchev concluded his speech
 by reaffirming his commitment
 to the "Leninist policy" of
 peaceful coexistence and by
 pledging himself to "spare no
 effort at Paris to achieve a
 mutually acceptable agreement.."
 This pledge was intended to
 reassure Western leaders and
 forestall speculation that he
 has lost interest in summit
 talks.

 speech, Soviet and bloc officials

 portrayed the Paris summit meet-
 ing as a general discussion to
 narrow differences rather than
 to negotiate specific settle-
 ments,   The Polish foreign min-
 ister privately expressed doubt
 that the Berlin problem  could
 be solved now. A Soviet official
 in Geneva said that the one
 thing the West could be assured
 of was that Khrushchev would
 come to Paris "with a smile"
 and a willingness to discuss
 issues seriously.
 In Vienna, a Soviet Em-
 bassy official expressed the
 view that some progress could
 be achieved on disarmament and
 nuclear testing. British press
 reports quote a "top  Commu-
 nist diplomat"  to  the effect
 that Khrushchev will mark time
 until the US  elections  and
 will seek only broad general
 agreements in. Paris, leaving
 the details to be worked out
 later.
 Bloc. spokesmen, including
 the Polish foreign minister,
 sought privately last week to
 de-emphasize any suggestion
 of a.crisis on Berlin at the
 summit.   The Soviet military
 attache in Prague, apparently
 acting on instructions, went
 out of his way to stress to the
 American attache that Khru-
 shchev's 25 April speech in
 Baku was not intended as a
 threat to use force on the Ber-
 lin issue.   The Hungarian and
 Rumanian attaches also took
 the same approach in private
 conversations, and the Soviet
 ambassador in London publicly
 denied that Khrushchev's re-
 marks could be interpreted as
 a threat.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1960
 Disarmament Talks
 In the last sessions be-
 fore the recess on 29 April of
 the disarmament talks at Geneva,
 the Soviet delegation used the
 problem of a final communiqu6
 to further its efforts in blam-
 ing the West for rejecting "com-
 plete and general disarmament"
 and obstructing progress in the
 conference.   Soviet chief dele-
 gate Zorin introduced a draft
 communique designed to commit
 the West to agreement on having
 achieved a "certain rapproche-
 ment of views" and to continue
 work on the basic principles of
 a general treaty after the re-
 cess.Zorn sought to induce
 the West to accept by indicating
 that when the negotiations re-
 sumed, the USSR would consider
 some provisions in the Western
 list of principles in develop-
 ing an agreed program for com-
 plete disarmament.
 Following Western presen-
 tation of amendments eliminat-
 ing the items on a rapprochement
 and the future work, the bloc
 delegations took the line that
 the West's position demonstrated
 its opposition to the UN resolu-
 tion and its desire to "strain
 the atmosphere."  As a result,
 the communique merely noted
 the recess and date for resump-
 tion.   Zorin's tactics in at-
 tempting to create the impres-
 sion'that the West opposes gen-
 eral disarmament provide further
 evidence that Moscow is prepar-
 ing the ground for shifting the
 talks to a discussion of partial
 measures after the summit.
 Nuclear Test Talks
 Moscow's acceptance of the
 Eisenhower-Macmillan proposal
 of 29 March for establishing a
 moratorium on small underground
 tests through unilateral declara-
 tions appears designed to focus
 the summit discussions on the
 duration of the moratorium.
 After stressing earlier that a
 moratorium should be formally
 incorporated into the treaty,
 either as an annex or protocol,
 the chief Soviet delegate on
 3 May presented a Soviet Gov-
 ernment declaration accepting,
 in effect, the US-British pro-
 posal; provided the three pow-
 ers reached agreement on a,
 "mutually acceptable duration
 for the moratorium."
 Although the declaration
 again proposes four to five
 years as a suitable period, it
 implies that this is subject
 to negotiation, on condition
 that the moratorium be con-
 terminous with the research
 program for improving detection
 techniques.   Soviet agreement to
 begin working out this program
 also included acceptance of the
 American proposal for conduct-
 ing experimental nuclear explo-
 sions during the course of re-
 search.
 The Soviet delegate, how-
 ever, indicated that the re-
 search program and experimental
 tests should be "joint," rather
 than coordinated national pro-
 grams as proposed by the West-
 ern powers. This approach may
 indicate the USSR plans to

 debate the concept of "joint"
 as opposed to "coordinated" in
 the preliminary meeting of ex-
 perts beginning on 11 May to
 establish the framework for the
 research program.
 The Soviet move appears
 timed to demonstrate Khrushchev's
 intentions to conduct serious
 negotiations on the nuclear
 test issue at the summit.  The
 Soviet premier will probably
 call for a long-term Western
 commitment on a moratorium and
 may propose a two-'to three-
 year period as a compromise
 solution.   In return he will
 probably press for Western con-
 cession on the number of on-     25X1
 site inspections as the only
 other major issue blocking con-
 clusion of a treaty.
 KHRUSHCHEV SHAKES UP TOP SOVIET LEADERSHIP
 The Soviet leadership
 shake-up on 4 May is the most
 extensive since the defeat of
 the Malenkov-Molotov "antipar-
 ty" group in 1957.  The evi-
 dence indicates that the changes
 were made at Khrushchev's direc-
 tion.  The net result is that
 the Khrushchev-Mikoyan-Kozlov
 team appears to be stronger
 than ever, and Frol Kozlov's po-
 sition as Khrushchev's desig-
 nated successor has been
 strengthened.
 The transfer of Kozlov
 from first deputy premier to
 the party secretariat will give
 him an opportunity to establish
 influence over the hard core
 of party professionals.  Their
 support will be necessary if
 he is eventually to take over
 control and maintain his posi-
 tion against other contenders.
 In addition, the secretar-
 iat has been reduced from a
 10-man body to a tight group
 of six, a size reminiscent of
 the Stalin era.'  Other than
 Khrushchev, Suslov appears to
 be the only remaining party
 secretary who might have the
 semblance of an independent
 voice.
 The promotion of Aleksey
 Kosygin, Nikolay Podgorny, and
 Dmitry Polyansky from candi-
 date status to full membership
 on the party presidium is a
 logical move.  Kosygin and
 Polyansky particularly have
 been mentioned frequently as
 rising stars on Khrushchev's
 team, and Podgorny, party  chief
 in the Ukraine, replaces Aleksey
 Kirichenko as representative
 of the Ukrainian Republic in
 the top leadership.
 The removal of Kirichenko
 and Belyayev from their top
 party positions simply formal-
 izes the demotion they received
 earlier this year when they
 were assigned to remote pro-
 vincial posts.
 The promotion of Kosygin
 from deputy premier and USSR
 economic planning chief to
 first deputy premier and his
 replacement by Vladimir Novi-
 kov, who worked for a time in
 Leningrad, Kozlov's old baili-
 wick, were the principal shifts
 in the government.   For the      25X1
 past year, Novikov has been
 chief economic planner in the
 Russian Republic (RSFSR).

 TURKISH DEMONSTRATIONS
 The demonstrations in Tur-
 key against the government           of
 President Bayar and Premier
 Menderes have subsided follow-
 ing the conclusion of the NATO
 Ministerial Council meeting in
 Istanbul on 4 May.   Before they
 did so, however,s,erious rioting
 occurred in Istanbul and An-
 kara, and minor demonstrations
 took place in Izmir, Malayta,
 Bursa, and possibly other Turk-
 ish cities. Many student lead-
 ers were arrested and some were
 reportedly beaten during inter-
 rogation.   The students appear
 determined to continue their
 struggle against the government,
 and new demonstrations are  a
 distinct possibility.
 The riots, which began on
 28 April, appear to have been
 sparked solely by recent re-
 pressive acts of the govern-
 ment against the political op-
 position in Turkey, although
 they may have been prolonged
 by the students in hopes of
 attracting the attention of
 the NATO delegates. Menderes
 was the special target  of
 the demonstrators, and there
 were repeated indications that
 the police also were the ob-
 jects of student hatred. While
 the students were unsuccessful
 in winning support of the
 troops sent to suppress the
 demonstrations, the army gen-
 erally was cautious in han-
 dling the crowds, and the stu-
 dents displayed respect fore
 the army's strength.
 Many intellectuals  have
 long opposed the increasingly
 authoritarian posture  of the
 Turkish Gowernment,and lawyers
 and university faculty members
 were particularly active in
 supporting the student demon-
 strations. The general public,
 however, remained largely
 apathetic.   Student leaders
 have denied that the opposi-
 tion Republican People's.,patty
 (RPP) was behind the rioting
 and have denied government
 charges that Turkey's small
 underground Communist party
 was involved.  Observers have
 noted that there was no indi-
 cation of anti-Americanism in
 the demonstrations.
 The Menderes regime has
 reacted to the demonstrations
 with new charges that the RPP
 is fomenting open rebellion.
 The regime may use the riots
 as an additional excuse for
 further limiting--if not elimi-
 nating--the RPP.   Several local
 RPP leaders reportedly have
 been arrested, and there is
 speculation that the government
 will move against the top lead-
 ership of the party after the
 NATO meetings.   If the govern-
 ment proscribes the party, the
 RPP plans to operate underground.
 If reprisals against the opposi-
 tion become severe,  RPP leaders
 may seek political asylum in for-
 eign embassies in Ankara.
 The administration is al-
 so worried that dissidents in
 the governing Democratic party
 (DP)--possibly as many as 150
 of more than 400 DP deputies in
 the legislature--may resign and
 eventually join.*ith the RPP to
 topple the government. Apparent-
 ly in anticipation of such moves25X1
 President Bayar reportedly has
 threatened to arrest any DP dep-

 5 May- 1960
 Continued student restive-
 ness in South Korea confronts
 the provisional government of
 Acting Chief of State Huh Chung
 with the problem of how to main-
 tain law and order while deci-
 sions on a new form of govern-
 ment and elections are being
 made. The general public appears
 to desire a return to peaceful
 conditions, but students have
 renewed demonstrations, demand-
 ing that elections be held for
 a new National Assembly before
 changes are made in the consti-
 tution.   Should prolonged fac-
 tional maneuvering A,hd political
 bickering in the legislature
 appear- to preclude a clean
 sweep of the old regime, the
 general public might again join
 with the students in agitating
 against the government.
 On 2 May some 20,000 stu-
 dents at Pusan and Taegu defied
 martial law to hold peaceful
 demonstrations demanding the
 speedy election of a new assem-
 bly before the existing Ameri-
 can-styge presidential system
 of government is changed for
 one with a prime minister and
 cabinet responsible to the
 legislature.   In Seoul, some 500
 students who staged a sitdown
 strike before the National As-
 sembly building had to be dis-
 persed with tear gas.
 American Ambassador Mc-
 Conaughy has noted that these
 demonstrations showed more plan-
 ing than was evident in the
 largely spontaneous movements
 of 19-26 April.   Seoul students
 have organized an executive
 committee representing all of
 the city's 27 colleges and uni-
 versities.   Outside political
 groups may also be attempting
 to  manipulate the students.
 The army seems intent on adopt-
 ing stiffer measures than here-
 tofore to cope with demonstra-
 tions.
 Such activity emphasizes
 the uncertainty of whether the
 public is willing to accept
 amendment of the constitution
 by a discredited incumbent Na-
 tional Assembly.   Ignoring de-
 mands that it quit, however,
 the assembly has continued its
 preparations to change the
 structure of the government be-
 fore a new legislature is elect-
 ed,.                                                        The committee charged with
 drafting the amendments to es-
 tablish a parliamentary form
 of government published on 4 May
 its proposals for making the
 president a titular head of
 state and providing for his in-
 direct election by the legisla-
 ture.
 It is questionable, how-
 ever, whether this measure will
 have the two-thirds support of
 assembly members needed to pass
 a constitutional amendment.
 Former President Rhee's Liberal
 party, after virtually abdicat-
 ing its leadership of the legis-
 lature following the overthrow
 of the regime, now may be mov-
 ing to reassert its majority
 position in the present highly
 fluid political situation. There
 are also indications that a
 minority among the Liberals may
 be maneuvering for a return of
 Rhee, possibly as president un-
 der the new parliamentary system.
 While the assembly appears united
 in its support for a cabinet sys-
 tem of government, it is not
 agreed on the method of select-
 ing the president.   A legisla-
 tive fight may develop over how
 he is to be chosen.
 Outside the legislature,
 preparations are under way for
 the formation or revival of a
 number of minor parties, from
 the Progressive party on the
 left to the militant National
 Youth Corps on the right.   An
 unstable, multiparty situation
 may develop.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1960
 Meanwhile, Huh Chung, while
 apparently favoring amendment
 of the constitution prior to
 holding elections for a new as-
 sembly, appears to have kept
 clear of the dispute. His ad-
 ministration has begun to reform
 the police, revise legislation
 to make local governments more
 responsible to the people, and
 clean up graft and corruption
 among officials and in the econ-
 omy.   Despite such popular ac-
 tions, Huh as yet has not
 emerged as a popular leader.
 On 28 April, Huh gave Am-
 bassador McConaughy the impres-
 sion he would lean heavily on
 the United States for support and
 particularly requested
 American assistance in
 overhauling the police
 system.   Huh assured
 the ambassador he hoped
 to promote the closest
 possible relations with
 the United States and
 requested   a  public
 statement of support
 to "aid in calming
 down the situation."
 Huh has indicated
 that he recognizes the
 need to normalize re-
 lations with Japan. He
 feels, however, that
 he must move cautious-
 ly to avoid any im-
 pression of making ex-
 cessive concessions. For this
 reason, he has stated publicly
 that any over-all settlement is
 dependent on Tokyo's ending the
 repatriation of Koreans in Japan
 to North Korea.   In the mean-
 time, he appears willing to
 revise Rhee'S hostage diplomacy
 toward Japan, relax enforcement
 of the "Rhee fishing line," and
 permit Japanese newsmen to en-
 ter South Korea.
 Pyongyang continues heavy
 commentary on events in South
 Korea, and now characterizes
 the outcome as a victory for the
 'Corean people, but only "an ini-
 tial victory."  To free them-
 selves fully, Pyongyang urges,
 the southerners must continue
 their demonstrations and "com-
 pel the American imperialists
 to withdraw."  North Korean
 leaders have again called for
 a joint North-South political
 conference, the establishment
 of a joint economic commission,
 and general all-Korean elections
 to set up.a unified government.
 There is no indication that
 North Korea intends to initiate
 hostilities, but Pyongyang may
 attempt to infiltrate additional
 agents during the present con-
 fused situation. The naval in-
 cident on 4 May off the east
 coast near the demilitarized
 zone,  between a South Korean pa-
 trol boat and North
 Korean torpedo boats,
 was probably acciden-
 tal. The South Ko-
 reans reported heavy
 fog in the area, and
 both sides may be
 somewhat nervous con-
 cerning the other's
 intentions.   The
 South Korean vessel
 reportedly was not
 damaged.
 Acting President
 u  Chung
 Huh  Chung, now
 62, has a reputation
 for directness, in-
 tegrity, and personal
 courage.     He is a political in-
 dependent who apparently sees
 himself as more than a caretaker,
 and he may emerge as a new po-
 liticdl power in South Korea.
 Educated at Columbia University
 in the 1920s, Huh speaks English
 and Japanese fluently and has
 a fair command of French.   He
 met Rhee, a fellow Methodist,
 in.the United States and there
 became active in the i:orean po-
 litical independence movement.
 Following the establishment of
 the South Korean Republic in
 1948, he was appointed trans-
 portation minister and elected
 to the National Assembly..Subse-
 quently he served as social affairs

 1954, Huh retired from politi-
 cal life, bitterly resentful
 of Rhee.
 In December 1957, Rhee ap-
 pointed Huh mayor of Seoul, al-
 legedly at the urging of the
 late vice president - elect, Yi
 Ki-pung, with whom Huh had been
 associated as a political moder-
 ate.           Yi apparently believed that
 Huh, as a political independent
 with Liberal party leanings, was
 better able to deliver the Seoul
 urban vote to Rhee in the 1960
 elections than any  proadmini-
 stration mayor.   As mayor, he
 conducted an able; largely non-
 political administration, and
 gained significant popularity.
 During an official trip to
 several major US cities in 1959,
 Huh criticized the Rhee admini-
 stration's abolition of the
 elective system for local offi-
 ces.                                                               This, coupled with pres-
 sure from those Liberal party
 leaders who were angered by his
 failure to cooperate in repres-
 sive measures for the election,
 caused his ouster the day after
 he returned to Korea in June
 1959.   In the fall of 1959, he
 served briefly as chief dele-
 gate to the South Korean - Jap-
 anese negotiations for normal-
 izing relations.
 Huh's appointment as for-
 eign minister on 25 April was one 25X1
 of several desperate, last-minute
 attempts by Rhee to popularize
 his regime.
 CUBA AND THE CARIBBEAN
 The Castro regime, which
 continues to strengthen its
 ties with the Sino-Soviet bloc,
 is becoming further isolated
 from other Latin American gov-
 ernments.   The estrangement be-
 tween Fidel Castro and Vene-
 zuelan President Betancourt ap-
 pears virtually complete; Cuban
 Government propaganda media have
 begun to attack Betancourt as
 they have other democratic pres-
 idents--Frondizi of Argentina,
 Lopez Mateos of Mexico, Lleras
 Camargo of Colombia, and Alles-
 sandri of Chile.
 In his May Day speech, Cas-
 tro derided Betancourt indirect-
 ly but unmistakably.   The next
 day an editorial in the Castro-
 controlled daily Revolucion at-
 tempted to promote a brea    be-
 tween Venezuelan civilian groups
 and the military, intimating
 that Betancourt is subservient
 to the army and to American oil
 companies.
 A political crisis in Vene-
 zuela could develop as a result
 of an open rift with Castro.   Dis-
 agreement over policy toward him
 is increasing, particularly with-
 in the government coalition.
 Venezuelan leftists staged a
 Latin American "congress of sup-
 port for the Cuban revolution"
 in Havana on 29-30 April, and a
 Venezuelan civilian "militia"
 group marched in the Cuban May
 Day parade.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1960
 Cuba has maintained close
 contacts with dissatisfied ele-
 ments in Venezuela's government
 coalition and with Communists
 there, and it may be giving them
 financial aid and guidance.
 Betancourt told Ambassador
 Sparks on 26 April that he was
 completely disencharjted with
 Castro; he said he would be
 happy to play a leading role in
 focusing Latin American atten-
 tion on the Cuban problem if
 Dominican dictator Trujillo were
 ousted first.
 Dominican Situation
 The church-state conflict
 is intensifying in the Dominican
 Republic, and a break in rela-
 tions between the Trujillo dic-
 tatorship and the church may be
 imminent.   The American Embassy
 reported on 3 May that Trujillo
 has launched a strong antichurch
 program in the country.
 One of the top anti-Tru-
 jillo dissident leaders told
 the American Embassy in Ciudad
 Trujillo that any expression
 of US disapproval of Trujillo
 would trigger a coup attempt now
 being organized with the help of
 military elements and would
 salvage US prestige among the
 dissidents "at the eleventh
 hour."
 Sino-Soviet Ties With Cuba
 Sino-Soviet ties with Cuba
 continue to be evident.
 Small shipments of Soviet
 crude and refined petroleum,
 wheat, and pig iron are arriving
 in Cuba under the trade agree-
 ment concluded in February.
 Marta Frayde--a charter
 member of the 26th of'July move-
 ment and close confidante of Cas-
 tro--told the press during her
 recent visit to East Germany that
 she favored closer relations be-
 tween both countries. Peiping ra-
 dio continues its extensive report-
 ing on events in Cuba, and the
 secretary general of the Cuban
 Communist party, Bias Roca, was
 received by Mao Tse-tung while in
 Peiping for the May Day celebrations,
 Expansion of Propaganda Media
 The Castro regime is
 steadily expanding its substan-
 tial propaganda efforts abroad.
 Plans have been announced for
 a powerful short-wave radio
 station for which the Ministry
 of Communications claims to have
 appropriated $1,700,000 "to
 bring the truth of the Cuban
 revolution to all Latin America."
 This probably would be closely  25X1
 tied in with the Castro-subsi-

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 MAY DAY IN THE COMMUNIST BLOC
 In Moscow's May Day cele-
 bration'this year, a military
 parade featured,      for the first
 time since November 1957, a
 massive display of rockets and
 missiles.   Four 700-nautical-
 mile and eight 100-n.m. surface-
 to-surface missiles were shown,
 as well as eight surface-to-
 air missiles.   The only new
 piece of equipment seen, how-
 ever, was a single-round rocket
 launcher mounted on aft amphib-
 ious tank chassis.   Two versions
 were shown, one of which had a
 new-type conical warhead. This
 rocket appeared to be one with
 two stages.
 Superheavy artillery
 pieces, probably designed to
 fire ram-jet,-assisted shells
 with atomic capabilities, were
 also shown for the first time
 since 7 November 1957.   Unlike
 the rockets and missiles, how-
 ever,  these special artillery
 weapons are not believed to be
 in the hands of troops.   It is
 possible that the weapons shown
 are prototypes which have never
 been produced in quantity.
 The attention given ad-
 vanced weaponry in this year's
 parade served both as a remind-
 er of Soviet military power on
 the eve of the summit and as an
 assurance to the Soviet people
 that their military strength
 has not been impaired by man-
 power cuts,
 All European satellites
 except Poland celebrated May
 Day with parades, but only in
 East Berlin were military units
 featured;  an estimated 4,000
 to 5,000 East German troops
 marched through the city. This
 action was in defiance of quad-
 ripartite agreements banning
 all troops but those of the oc-
 cupation powers.   As in previous
 years, certain unarmed paramil-
 itary delegations, including the
 workers' militia (Kampfgruppen),
 marched in the parade alongside
 about 100,000 "workers" and
 sympathizers.   The East German
 demonstration of strength and
 "sovereignty" in defiance of
 the West was greeted by a crowd
 of 25,000, smaller than expected,
 in Marx-Engels Platz.   This is
 in sharp contrast with the 750,-
 000 person's who attended cele-
 brations in West Berlin.
 In the other satellites,
 there was little popular enthus-
 iasm for the demonstrations.  In
 Czechoslovakia, the people par-
 ticipated in the parade because
 they felt their jobs depended
 on their participation, while
 in Poland hundreds left carry-
 ing "furled banners" before
 Gomulka had finished speaking.
 Most satellite spokesmen
 commemorating May Day emphasized
 the peace theme and Khrushchev's
 call for peaceful coexistence.
 This soft tone--abetted by the
 deletion of scurrilous advance
 propaganda and provocative
 floats--was marred somewhat,
 however,  by East German and
 Czech attacks on the Bonn gov-
 ernment, by a generally hostile
 tone and specific condemnation
 of Yugoslavia by Albania, and
 by calls for "vigilance" and
 caution by certain other satel-
 lites, including Rumania.
 Peiping announced on 24
 April that, beginning this year,
 the traditional method of ob-
 serving May Day with a tremendous
 parade in the capital would-be
 abandoned in favor of smaller
 celebrations throughout the

 in order "to enable the great-

 more enthusiastically" than

 result of the new policy.   Chu
 Te was the senior member of the

 decentralization theme with Mao
 in Tientsin, Liu Shao-chi in
 Chengtu, Chou En-lai in Kweiyang,
 and Chen Yi in Kunming.  Peiping
 declared a one-day cease-fire
 for the Chinmens on 1 May in
 order to enable "compatriots"
 to celebrate the occasion.
 North Korea and North Viet-

 customary fashion with huge
 demonstrations, parades, and

 have been several Soviet press
 accounts in the past month of
 conversions of collectives to
 state farms, notably in the New
 Lands area and the Soviet Far
 East.
 The immediate motivation
 is apparently economic.  The
 changes taking place around ma-

 issued late in 1958 calling for

 the creation of specialized
 truck farms near major urban

 hopes that the specialization
 resulting from such change-overs
 will reduce production costs,
 improve supplies in state re-
 tail outlets, and erode the com-
 petitive position of the collec-
 tive farm free market; conver-
 sion may also alleviate local
 shortages in agricul-
 tural labor.
 Many collective
 farmers living near
 urban centers reside
 at the farm but work
 in industry in the
 city.  The change to
 state farms could help stabilize
 labor and make it possible to
 create more rapidly conditions
 comparable to those in industry.
 By conversions on marginal
 land, the state can take a more
 direct hand in solving the prob-
 lems of the economically back-
 ward collectives.

 The state -farm system has
 generally been favored by the

 which allows tighter state con-
 trol.  The form is also more

 goal of making both living con-

 ditions and wage systems of the
 urban and rural worker similar.
 The changes, however, apparent-
 ly do not portend the elimina-
 tion of the collective system.
 Soviet leaders have indicated
 that for the present the col-
 lective system is to continue
 along with the state-farm sys-
 tem.  A principal reason for
 the state's present position is
 unwillingness to guarantee a
 normal wage to all agricultural
 workers--an obligation that
 could be a major burden in a
 poor crop year.
 Conversion will not be re-
 ceived favorably by all collec-
 tive farmers.   In marginal agri-
 cultural areas, where the col-
 lective farmer's income is very
 small, the security offered by
 the state farm might be welcome;
 on the other hand, the change-
 over means that collective farm
 capital, nominally owned by the
 farmers themselves, is trans-
 ferred to the state and the
 farmers become state employees
 with fixed wages.   Furthermore,
 the regime is discouraging
 state workers from owning cattle
 and cultivating private plots--
 valuable sources of revenue for
 the farm workers.   Collective
 farmers in the more prosperous
 areas will resent any tampering
 with their favored situation.
 The extent of recent changes
 is indicated by an official So-
 viet year-end report which dis-
 closed that 500 state farms were
 created during 1959, as compared
 with  fewer.. than: ,100  in 1958.
 In January 1959 there were 850
 collectives in Moscow Oblast.
 During the past decade the num-
 ber of collective farms has de-
 creased from over 250,000 to
 55,000 at the end of 1959--
 mostly through amalgamations
 but partly through conversion
 to state farms.   The number of
 state farms has increased each
 year since 1953, although at
 an uneven rate, and now totals
 approximately 6,500.
 On an average throughout
 the USSR, a state farm has from
 four to five times more sown
 acreage than a collective farm;
 the over-all share of state
 farms in the sown acreage has
 increased from about one tenth
 in 1953 to more than one fourth
 in 1958, and the amount of pro-
 duce sold by state farms to the
 state has also increased sharply
 in recent years.                       25X1

 nology,   the basic issue is
 how far Yugoslavia can evolve
 toward Western concepts in
 its political program.
 The regime's leading
 ideologist, Edvard Kardelj,
 in late February attempted
 to minimize the conflict, but
 Milhailo Markovic, a professor
 at the University of Belgrade,
 assured an American diplomat
 that the debate will go on
 "in one form or another.,,
 In addition to Markovic,
 more outspoken members of the
 liberal group include offi-
 cials in the International In-
 stitute for Politics and Eco-
 nomics and a number of writers
 and intellectuals,  including
 Gavro Altman, an editor of the
 party's monthly, Komunist. The
 debate has been carried  on
 primarily in two journals,
 Nasa Stvarnost, a nonparty in-
 eI'aec ua  monthly, and Komu-
 nist.
 Typical of the liberal,
 and in fact  non-Marxist, po-
 sitions which have appeared
 in these journals is Markovic's
 contention that, since the West

 has progressed in the social
 science and philosophy fields
 as well as in technology,Marx-
 ists must accept those   parts
 of Western thought which rep-
 resent a real contribution.
 A tactic commonly followed
 by the liberals is to criticize
 those Soviet ideological posi-
 tions which are also held  by
 conservative Yugoslav ideol-
 ogists.   Najdan Pasic, editor
 of Nasa Stvarnost,for example,
 ha d denie  the Soviet theory
 that the sole role of the West-
 ern state is to oppress the work-
 ing class.   Rather, he argues,
 every state is performing a
 series of functions which are
 indispensable to the society
 as a whole.
 The primary spokesman for
 the more doctrinally conserva-
 tive elements has been Boris
 Ziherl, central committee mem-
 ber and leading regime educator.
 He accuses the liberals of for-
 getting Lenin's view that a
 Communist state must be better
 in every respect.   Claiming
 that the liberals learned their
 Marxism "from the works of
 Marx's bourgeois critics," he
 also condemns the liberals for
 being so pro-Western that they
 are incapable of separating
 Marxism from Stalinism.

 In his attempt to resolve
 the debate, Kardelj assumed a
 middle position, but one which
 seemed somewhat to favor the
 liberals.   Milentije Popovic,
 another important party lead-
 er, followed Kardelj's lead.
 In essence, they are appealing
 for continued free development
 of "science and scientific
 thought," with the qualifica-
 tion that it must not degener-
 ate into "futile speculations
 and verbalisms."  Although
 Kardelj did not advocate an
 end to the debate, Komunist
 apparently felt a cog-o-dff
 period was called for and has
 ceased allotting space to it.
 The existence of these
 rumblings among the intellec-
 tuals has important implications
 for Yugoslavia's future orienta-
 tion,  since the dissidents are
 by and large from the new genera-
 tion of party ideologists. More-
 over, they are sympathetic to
 Djilas--who advocated a modified
 type of Western political democ-
 racy for Yugoslavia--although
 they believe his tactics were

 The high refugee flow is
 particularly embarrassing to
 the Communists on the eve of
 the summit, but the Ulbricht
 regime probably considers that
 the drastic measures which
 would be necessary to close
 the Berlin escape routes would
 be even more embarrassing. The
 regime has  clamped  severe
 controls on the East-West Ger-
 man border, however; only 1,-
 681 East Germans eluded the
 border police in April, bring-
 ing the total refugees figure
 for the month to 17,183.
 The flight of experienced
 farmers--said by West German
 officials to constitute about
 16 percent of the April totals
 --will add greatly to the re-
 gime's difficulties  arising
 from the speed and extent of
 its collectivization campaign.

 merely to gain time until they

 Officials view with con-

 serious shortage of adequate
 farm machinery, the lack of
 properly trained administra-

 serious  shortages of  farm
 buildings to shelter livestock
 on collectives.  Officials re-

 sult of these shortages, it
 will be five years before the
 regime achieves its  goal of
 raising all livestock on large
 collective farms and two or
 three years before the newly
 collectivized farmers  are
 organized into large-scale en-

 The regime is  seeking to

 MOSCOW SHIFTS TACTICS TOWARD EMIGRES
 A notable shift in Soviet
 tactics in the treatment of
 emigres has taken place this
 year.   Current propaganda no
 longer urges repatriation, but
 rather  aims  at  promoting a
 feeling of patriotism, admira-
 tion for Soviet accomplish-
 ments, and a strengthening of
 spiritual and cultural ties
 with the homeland.
 A  vigorous  redefection
 campaign was 'launched in 1954
 to bring as many emigres as pos-
 sible back under Soviet con-
 trol and to demoralize the rest.
 In early 1955 a Committee for
 Return to the Homeland was
 formed in East Berlin to handle
 the drive, and a political am-
 nesty was issued within the So-
 viet Union.  The campaign had
 only limited success; fewer
 than 10,000 returned, includ-
 &ing many   social  misfits and
 persons who had never lived in
 the Soviet Union. The amnesty,
 furthermore, did not prove an
 effective safeguard for return-
 ees. Emigre".circles have~l6arned
 that some of those who returned
 to the USSR were sent to prison
 for earlier transgressions, or
 were not allowed to settle in
 their native areas.
 The  committee  probably
 feels that most defectors like-
 ly to return have done so by
 now,   and  that it is time to
 concentrate on the "compatriots"
 who have settled abroad.   In
 line with the recent shift in
 tactics, the name of the com-
 mittee's newspaper has been
 changed from For Return to the
 Homeland to The Voice of the
 Homeland.   Clubs are being or-
 ganized in foreign countries
 to serve as local chapters of
 the  "Union of Soviet Patriots."
 The  committee  has  increased
 its mailing of cultural and
 educational literature and has
 stepped up its broadcasts.
 Emigres are urged to prop-
 agandize Soviet achievements
 and establish closer contacts
 with friends and relatives liv-
 ing in the homeland.   Soviet
 emigres are being offered the
 opportunity to visit friends
 and relatives in the USSR with
 the guarantee that they will
 be permitted to return to their
 adopted countries.   In the past,
 many emigres have feared to
 visit the Soviet Union, as some
 earlier visitors had not been
 allowed to leave.
 Judging from its present
 propaganda line, the committee
 apparently  feels  that  ris-
 ing Soviet prestige and lessen-
 ing tensions may bring at least
 some waverers back into the
 fold. in a letter to an emigre
 in West Germany, the committee
 says:   "Today we are not call-
 ing you to the homeland, be-
 cause we do not know what rea-
 sons have been holding you away
 for so many years.   But we also
 do not admit the thought that
 after all these years you have
 become hopelessly callous and
 that our appeal to think once
 more about your ties to the
 homeland will not find a re-
 sponse in your heart."

 SOVIET-PAKISTANI RELATIONS
 The USSR, as part of its
 extensive  effort  to  exploit
 contacts  between Khrushchev
 and  free world  leaders,  has
 sounded out the Ayub government
 in Pakistan on several recent
 occasions to determine whether
 such visits have produced any
 change in Pakistan's cool atti-
 tude  toward  bloc  countries,
 Since Moscow continues to sup-
 port Afghanistan and to censure
 Pakistan for participating in
 Western military alliances,  So-
 viet diplomatic feelers seem
 designed primarily to arouse
 fears among Pakistan's allies
 of a revision of Rawalpindi's
 strongly anti-Communist poli-
 cies.
 Soviet diplomats, in deal-
 ing with Pakistani officials,
 have exuded confidence that
 Pakistan eventually will take

 In a speech on his return to
 Moscow, Khrushchev declared,

 being held concerning a KhrU-
 shchev-Ayub meeting.
 Pakistani officials       are
 con-
 cerned that their government's
 pro-Western posture may be un-
 suited to the East-West "thaw,"
 but they plan to make no deci-
 sion as to a revision until af-
 ter the Commonwealth conference,
 which opened in London on 3 May.
 Pakistan is unlikely to make
 any major changes in its for-
 eign policy, and recent hostile
 Soviet Statements make diffi-
 cult even pro forma changes by
 the Ayub government to bring
 Pakistan more in line with the
 current East-West detente.
 ADDITIONAL PAKISTANI CABINET CHANGES
 Pakistani President Ayub
 apparently intends to relieve
 ambitious Lieutenant General
 Sheikh of his duties as minister
 of interior within a few weeks
 and appoint him permanently to
 the  less  powerful  Food
 and Agriculture post, which he
 assumed on an apparently tempo-
 rary basis on 20 April. Lieutenant
 General Azam Khan,generally re-
 garded as Ayub's right-hand man,
 vacated the top post in the Min-
 istry of Food when Ayub appoint-
 ed him governor of East Pakistan
 on 11 April.   In addition,Akhtar
 Hussain and Zakir Hussain, who
 were recently replaced as gov-
 ernors of West and East Pakistan
 respectively,have been named to
 the cabinet and are to be as-
 signed posts soon.
 Ayub has sought to main-
 tain the appearance of govern-
 mental stability.   These  are
 the first changes in cabinet
 membership since the army take -
 over of October 1958, although
 several shifts in cabinet  as-
 signments were made last Jan-
 uary.   The new assignments
 for Sheikh and Azam reflect
 the continuing high priority
 being given to increasing food
 production and to economic
 development in East Pakistan,
 but it is not clear why Ayub
 now has decided to accept the
 disadvantages  of  a second
 reshuffle.
 Ayub's action has  stimu-
 lated extensive rumors and
 speculation concerning rival-
 ries  and                                                        the balance  of
 power  within  the  govern-
 ment.                                                              The crash  program  to
 increase food production is
 almost  certain to suffer as

 Sheikh has already indicated
 he does not share Azam's eager-
 ness to push the program. Ghulam
 Faruque, chairman of Pakistan's
 Water and Power Development Au-
 thority and one of the country's
 most capable administrators,
 believes that Azam, although
 highly capable, is likely to
 offend East Pakistani sensi-
 tivities in his drive for great-
 er efficiency and harder work.

 of the influence of Sheikh and

 Sheikh says he protested against
 his intended transfer.   He has
 frequently been mentioned in
 rumors circulated by opponents
 of the regime as ambitious to
 increase his own power, and he
 may feel keenly the loss of the
 powerful Ministry of Interior,
 which controls the police.

 just taken hold of the food

 Premier Nu's first month
 back in office has been marked
 by a smooth transition from mil-
 itary to civilian rule and a
 rapid reversion to the pre-1958
 practices of Burmese government.
 In keeping with General Ne Win's
 decision to avoid responsibility
 for the programs of the new
 government, all but,five of the
 75 military administrators of
 the interim regime have returned
 to military assignments. There
 has been no protest from the
 army, although many of its re-
 form programs have been can-
 celed-or suspended.  It appears
 that U Nu is attempting to
 eliminate,as fare as is expe-
 dient, all reminders of the pre-
 vious regime.
 Immediately on taking of-
 fice on 5 April, U Nu announced
 abrupt changes in government
 programs.   For his Buddhist sup-
 porters, he reimposed a ban,
 lifted by General Ne Win in
 1959, on the sale and slaughter
 of beef, and he appointed a com-
 mission to advise on adoption
 of Buddhism as a state religion.
 For urban voters, he suspended
 the army's squatter resettle-
 ment program and, to meet stu-
 dent demands, announced plans
 to re-establish tuition-free
 middle schools.   For his own
 political followers, his gov-
 ernment is reviewing the cases
 of government officials--main-
 ly political appointees from
 his previous regime--sacked by
 the army for incompetence.
 Despite the 18-month inter-
 lude of army rule, U Nu's views
 on party affairs are remarkably
 unchanged from the past. U Nu
 is the idealistic advocate of
 unity,  democracy,  and magnanimity.
 However, he allows his lieuten-
 ants to carry out a vindictive
 campaign against the opposition
 Stable Anti-Fascist People's
 Freedom League (AFPFL)    As Nu
 publicly calls for the devel-

 from Parliament.   Within the

 The Indonesian Army is
 encouraging the anti-Communist
 Democratic League and the
 league's anti-Sukarno press
 campaign, with the immediate
 objective of preventing the
 installation of President Su-
 karno's appointed parliament.
 Despite continuing rumors of a
 coup, the army leadership ap-
 pears at this time to be in-
 terested mainly in the parlia-
 mentary objective and in pre-
 venting the inclusion of Com-
 munists in a reorganized cabi-
 net.
 Army support and instiga-
 tion of. league activities, al-
 though covert, are no longer
 secret.   Should army and league
 pressures prove insufficient
 to force Sukarno's political
 retreat, the army may find its
 political role further reduced
 by him, and Army Chief of Staff
 General Nasution may even be
 .dismissed.
 League criticism of the
 261-member parliament, which
 was appointed by President Su-
 karno in late March to replace
 the body he dissolved earlier
 the same month, has apparently
 created sufficient confusion
 to prompt Acting President
 Djuanda to advise Sukarno, now
 midway on a world tour, to re-
 consider:his plan to install the
 parliament in June.
 the President remains determined
 to install and maintain the new
 parliament until elections are
 held in 1962.
 Sukarno reportedly sent
 back orders that "no princi-
 pal measure" be taken before his
 return and that the newspapers
 which were criticizing his pol-
 icies be banned.   The dailies
 have not been banned, and they
 continue to print antiparlia-
 mentary articles, but General
 Nasution has ordered them to
 stop criticizing Sukarno.
 League and army strategy
 appears directed toward persuad-
 ing appointed members of parlia-
 ment not to accept their seats
 in the new body. The principal
 target is the Nahdatul Ulama
 (NU),  Indonesia's second largest
 Moslem party, which accounts
 for 14 percent of the parliamen-
 tary membership.   Should all NU
 appointees join representatives
 of the Democratic League, the
 army, and the navy in refusing
 their seats, their combined num-
 bers would account for only 32
 percent of parliament.   The re-
 mainder are chiefly air force
 and police representatives and
 adherents of the National and
 Communist parties.

 A new element, however,
 which is likely to benefit Su-
 karno and dissipate much of the
 criticism directed toward him
 is a Dutch plan to reinforce
 troops in Netherlands New Guinea
 and send naval units on a six-
 month flag-showing cruise to
 Far Eastern waters from early
 June to mid-December.  Indonesian
 officials have already reacted
 vehemently to Dutch plans, and
 President Sukarno could easily
 exploit them to drum up a propa- 25X1
 ganda drive for the "liberation"
 of "West Irian" which could unite
 all Indonesian factions.
 Political activity in the
 Congo, centered about the legis-
 lative elections scheduled for
 11 to 25 May,  has been marked
 by the Communists' efforts to
 increase their influence in the
 Belgian colony.   Although  no
 single party is expected to con-
 trol the legislature, the Nation-
 al Congo Movement faction led
 by Patrice Lumumba--one  of
 several groups enjoying Commu-
 nist financial support--is ex-
 pected to make a strong showing.
 The imminence of African rule
 has increased restiveness among
 Europeans in mineral-rich Katanga
 Province, and outbound aircraft
 are heavily booked.
 Belgian Communist efforts
 to establish a foothold in the
 Congo have emphasized the culti-
 vation of leading African poli-
 ticians through financial aid,
 together with promises of bloc
 economic aid for the Congo after
 independence on 30 June. Belgian
 Communist leaders reportedly be-
 lieve that Congolese anticipa-
 tion of rapid economic advance
 following independence will lead
 to a disillusionment susceptible
 to Communist exploitation. The
 bloc will probably offer some
 technical and economic aid after
 independence, and it might offer
 large-scale economic support if
 pro-Communist elements become
 influential in the new govern-
 ment.

 Meanwhile, delegates to the
 economic round-table conference

 to have had little effect, A
 number of delegates remain con-
 cerned about the Congo's finan-
 cial plight, however, and are
 dissatisfied with. steps taken

 economy.
 Despite periodic reassur-

 NATIONALIST AGITATION OVER PORTUGUESE AFRICA
 With independence attained
 or imminent in most African
 countries, nationalists are
 directing their attention in-
 creasingly toward Portugal's
 African possessions.   Nation-
 alist groups. exiled from Portu-
 guese territory have recently
 shown new vigor; they apparent-
 ly have acquired the support of
 prominent African leaders as
 well as aid from the Communist
 bloc.
 The principal vehicle for
 Communist activity against
 Portuguese Africa is the Con-
 akry-based  Revolutionary Front
 for the Independence of the
 Portuguese Colonies (FRAIN)
 The first
 goal of FRAIN's leaders, most
 of whom have long records of
 Communist affiliation, report-
 edly is the "liberation by vio-
 lent means" of Portuguese Guin-
 ea, a propaganda target of the
 Guinean Government as well.
 FRAIN has also conducted a
 propaganda campaign against the
 present conspiracy trials in
 Angola.
 FRAIN's operations apparent-
 ly are supervised by Guinean Min-
 ister of Public Works Ismael
 Toure
 A second group, the
 L'  eration Movement of Terri-
 tories Under Portuguese Domina-
 tion, also claims to have Guin-
 ean support.
 Another center of exile
 activity is the Belgian Congo,
 which has a tradition of rela-
 tively easy native passage over
 its long common border with Por-
 tuguese-held Angola. The Alli-
 ance of the Bakongo (Abako), a
 Congolese tribal group which domi-
 nates western Leopoldville Prov-
 ince, reportedly has been attempt-
 ing to extend its influence to
 related tribes in Angola and
 the enclave of Cabinda.   Congo-
 lese interest in the Portuguese
 territories is also revealed in
 the recent private statement of
 Patrice Lumumba, a member of
 the Congo's governing council,
 that the situation in Portuguese
 Africa is the most pressing
 African problem.

 Despite the UAR's differ-
 ences with Iraq and Jordan, the
 General Federation of Iraqi
 Trade Unions and Jordanian dock-
 workers have declared their in-
 tentions of boycotting American
 ships, although none are ex-

 The boycott in fact has received

 will not be serviced in Arab
 countries,with the exception
 of Tunisia and Morocco.
 They have not, however,
 been barred from the Suez Canal,
 and,according to the under sec-

 under flags of convenience will
 not be boycotted.  Tankers are
 included in a general ban or-

 Petroleum Company's facilities
 in Lebanon have said they will
 not load American-flag tankers.

 the government of Bahrein, pre-
 sumably  out of consideration
 for oil revenues, reversed
 its'.  initial decision to boy-
 cott both US-flag and US-owned
 tankers, and an American-flag
 tanker has since been loaded.
 The first two American-owned
 foreign-flag tankers to visit
 Sidon and Baniyas, in Syria,
 were loaded on 1 and 2 May.
 The secretary general of
 the UAR-dominated Internation-
 al Confederation of Arab Trade
 Unions, which organized the
 boycott, earlier told American
 Embassy officials that a boy-
 cott of American aircraft would
 be a later step if the boycott
 continues.   The UAR also is
 known to be considering a pos-
 sible ban on American goods.
 American embassies and con-
 sulates have recommended that
 American passengers on American
 ships stopping at UAR and Leb-
 anese ports not disembark be-
 cause of'the possibility of in-
 volvement in incidents.   The
 assault in New York on a UAR
 seaman from the Cleopatra re-
 portedly has aroused talk of
 reprisals along UAR waterfronts.
 Even before the-official
 start of the boycott, dock-
 workers in Alexandria and Ku-
 wait worked American ships only
 following police or government
 persuasion.   Lebanese longshore-
 men, according to Foreign Min-
 ister Uwayni, have made it
 clear they will not work on
 American vessels even if it
 means defying Lebanese troops.
 Although Arab government offi-
 cials publicly support the boy-
 cott, they privately have ex-
 pressed deep concern over the
 adverse effect a prolonged dis-
 pute could have on Arab-American
 relations.   The US Senate's
 passage of an amendment to the
 foreign aid bill, empowering
 the President to withhold aid
 from countries (the UAR) en-
 gaging in economic warfare
 against other aid recipients
 (Israel), has aggravated Arab
 resentment.
 Moscow has seized these
 new opportunities to try to
 convince the Arabs that the So-
 viet Union is their big-power
 protector against a Western-
 supported Israel.   In broadcasts
 to Arab audiences on 3 May,
 Radio Moscow declared that
 Zionist influence in the United
 States is behind the refusal
 to unload the Cleopatra. Cen-
 suring the Senate's action
 amending the US foreign aid
 bill, the commentator asserted
 that the dispute is further
 proof of Western "hatred for
 the UAR," which he described
 as "a long-term political trend."

 tian-Moslem tension resulting

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1960
 from intervention by Moslem-
 directed police in a dispute
 between two Christian factions
 on 1 May, President Shihab has
 dissolved parliament and sched-
 uled parliamentary  elections
 beginning 12 June. The  elec-
 tions will be held on four suc-
 cessive Sundays,   permitting
 movement of security forces
 from district to district in
 an effort to keep incidents to
 a minimum.
 The 1 May violence occurred
 as crowds gathefed for a pontif-
 ical mass planned as a gesture
 of national unity and attended
 by the papal nuncio,   the Maro-
 nite patriarch,   the                  Lebanese
 cabinet, and members of the dip-
 lomatic corps.   Supporters  of
 former President Chamoun  and
 the Phalange, the political ac-
 tion arm of the Maronite Church
 led by Minister of Workd Pierre
 Jumayyil, staged rival demon-
 strations. The pro-Nasir      Mos-
 lem chief of the emergency po-
 lice, a  deserter  during the
 1958 rebellion,   threw a hand
 grenade into the crowd.  This
 was followed by firing by the
 police. Extremist Christian
 elements retaliated  on 2 May
 by bombing the  residence  of
 the Moslem director of Nation-
 al Police.   That night Chris-
 tians in Beirut clashed                   with
 troops and police.
 Although President Shihab
 can be expected to take strong
 measures  to  prevent  fur-
 ther disorders, the incidents
 are likely to unite the Chris-
 tians against the Shihab re-
 gime and possibly against the
 patriarch, who has been  re-
 garded by many Christians as
 being soft in defending Chris-
 tian
 rights.
 The setting of the
 voting
 dates
 and  apprehension
 in
 Christian quarters that
 any
 new parliament would be
 domi-
 nated by pro-UAR elements bent
 on destroying the delicate
 balance between Christians and
 Moslems are likely to increase
 the influence of extremists
 among the Christian elements.
 Further incidents  are prob-
 able.
 UAR preparations for in-
 tervention in the elections
 are becoming evident.  There
 are several reports of  UAR
 contacts, both in Lebanon and
 Syria, with a number of aspir-
 ants for Parliament.
 Iraq
 A reshuffle of the Qasim
 cabinet on 3 May has resulted
 in the dropping of Finance
 Minister Muhammad Hadid, one
 of the most influential and
 conservative members, and the
 appointment of Brig. Gen.
 Ismail Arif, former military
 attache in Washington,   as
 minister of education.   The
 opportunistic Arif, who was
 an early Qasim supporter, re-
 portedly has criticized the
 Qasim regime at social af-
 fairs in Baghdad attended by
 Americans.  He has replaced
 Brig. Gen. Muhi al-Din Abd
 al-Hamid, a Qasim crony, who
 has been made minister of in-
 dustry.

 Afro-Asian Conference
 This week's Afro-Asian
 Economic Conference in Cairo
 appears to have marked a gain
 for Nasir's kind of neutralism.
 The USSR, participating as an
 observer rather than a member
 but backed by representatives
 of Communist China and other
 Asian Communist states, lost a
 fight to include eight Soviet
 Asian republics in the conference
 membership.   Membership remains
 limited to countries which par-
 ticipated in the 1955 Bandung
 conference or to those central
 governments located in Africa
 or Asia.
 Communist China's objection
 to the establishment of an Afro-
 Asian investment fund, drawn up
 by the UAR and labeled an "im-
 perialist trap" by the  Chinese,
 was overruled.   The Chinese
 delegation also objected with-
 out effect to the election of
 an Indonesian as a vice presi-
 dent of the organization, and
 there were loud complaints from
 the North Koreans on the inclu-
 sion of South Korea as a  con-
 ference member.
 Muhammad Rushdi of the UAR
 was elected  president, and the
 UAR apparently will continue to
 lead  neutralist opposition  to
 the Communists, as it has in
 the Afro-Asian solidarity move-
 ment.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 5 May 1960
 sponsored by the Campaign for
 Nuclear  Disarmament  proved
 highly successful in indicat-
 ing what the American Embassy
 terms a "strong ground swell
 of public awareness and disap-
 proval of nuclear weapons as
 instruments of national policy."
 Since  Easter,   two  important
 trade unions and the Coopera-
 tive party, an affiliate of the
 Labor party, have passed reso-
 lutions urging unilateral Brit-
 ish nuclear disarmament. Other
 influential unions will prob-
 ably follow suit.
 The Transport and General
 Workers Union, Britain's larg-
 est',;                   is already on record fa-
 voring unilateral disarmament.
 These groups have the votes to
 repudiate the Labor party's
 leadership at the annual fall
 conference unless some marked
 shift in their direction oc-
 curs in the meantime.
 Party  leader  Gaitskell,
 who insisted as recently as 1
 May that Britain could not dis-
 arm unilaterally, has acknowl-
 edged that Labor's policy
 would have to be reconsidered.
 One strong hint of an impending
 policy change came in the re-
 cent parliamentary debate on
 the Blue Streak missile project,
 when Labor's shadow defense
 minister, George Brown, charged
 that in abandoning plans for
 a British delivery vehicle to
 carry nuclear warheads, the
 government had admitted the im-
 possibility of providing an in-
 dependent deterrent.
 The Labor party's present
 position, adopted last year to
 stem left-wing pressure, calls
 for Britain to abandon nuclear
 arms only if efforts to form a
 nonnuclear "club" of all na-
 tions other than the United
 States and the USSR succeed. A
 possible compromise would call
 for an end to production of
 nuclear weapons, but retention
 of those already on hand.
 Public agitation and the
 prospect  of  a  Labor  party
 shift will add to the pressures
 on the Macmillan government,
 which has long shown extreme
 sensitivity to public opinion
 on the issue, and will heighten
 London's desire for some demon-
 strable progress on disarma-
 ment at the summit meeting.
 POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
 A low-keyed effort to re-
 sume direct progress toward the
 political integration of Europe
 is expected to attract increas-
 ing attention in the next few
 months in the European Economic
 Community (EEC).   Geared to im-
 plementation of existing pro-
 visions of the EEC and EURATOM
 treaties, the project seeks the
 election of the European Parlia-
 mentary Assembly by direct uni-
 versal suffrage.  This compara-
 tively modest achievement has
 long been sought by integration-

 work of a Belgian Socialist,.
 Fernand Dehousse, and its cau-

 uncovered in 18 months of con-

 hoped to link the direct elec-

 sion of the assembly's powers--
 a move which would almost cer-
 tainly doom the entire project

 the Common Market enjoys, few
 if any of its member countries
 are prepared at this time to
 set up a European constituent
 assembly.

 other moves which would limit
 effective US use of the Chagua-

 of dollars in uncollected air-

 tenance costs necessitated by
 heavy US use of the airfield.

 In line with his frequently
 indicated anti-US prejudices,
 Premier Williams nevertheless.
 refused last summer to discuss
 the US offer to pay fees, being
 determined to reserve the issue
 for bilateral or quadripartite
 talks with the US,  the UK,  and
 the government of the West
 Indies Federation on the over-
 all problem of revision of
 the'1941 US-UK base  agreement.
 Williams' success in elim-
 inating a practice arranged
 under a ten-year-old US-UK un-
 derstanding may encourage him
 to press his campaign even more
 actively for revision of the
 1941 agreement.   The British
 Colonial Office now is seeking
 a formula which would circumvent
 his threat that, unless Trini-
 dad participates as an equal
 delegate in the base-revision
 talks, he will repudiate any
 agreement.
 Williams seeks a promise
 that Chaguaramas will be evac-
 uated by 1967 at the earliest;
 he offers in return another.
 site which the US previously
 rejected.    In the meantime,
 he seeks "joint use" of the
 base and release of unused
 areas.   He continues to demand
 that the United States give up

 the Chaguaramas base area, which
 he wants as the site of the
 federal capital.                                                                          He asserts that
 the 1941 agreement will lapse
 in any case when independence
 is achieved.
 Williams has already begun
 preparations for harassment of
 the base's operations.   He plans
 to construct a marine police
 launch station at Staubles Bay,
 an enclave of British-owned
 land within the Chaguaramas
 site, and has hinted he might
 cut off the base's electricity.
 He could also foment labor
 troubles among the approximately
 500 local employees of the base.
 Trinidad Government officials
 have indicated they may set up
 customs posts outside the base,
 following up Williamt.' charges
 that extensive smuggling is
 carried on.
 Williams appears to be
 planning to follow up his suc-
 cess in arousing alarm over
 radiation hazards last summer
 by preparing charges that nu-
 clear submarines are using the
 base and constitute a radiation
 danger.   While the public does
 not echo Williams' vehement
 anti-Americanism, his control
 over the electorate apparently
 remains firm.

 5 May 1960
 PARAGUAYAN EXILES
 The Stroessner regime in
 Paraguay, increasingly in the
 spotlight as the last dictator-
 ship in South America, has en-
 countered another exile inva
 sion attempt.   The Argentina-
 based effort, which began on
 29 April, now appears to have
 faltered,but on 3 May a new
 small-scale thrust occurred in
 the northeast along the Brazil-
 ian border.   The armed forces,
 loyal to the Stroessner regime,
 are said to be confident they
 can control the situation even
 though isolated skirmishes are
 still being reported.
 The invasions apparently
 are a major effort by the small
 leftist 14th of May movement,
 which led a similar invasion in
 December.   Some observers be-
 lieve the Communist-oriented
 National Liberation Front was
 also involved.   Apparently the
 moderate exile groups did not
 take part, despite an agreement
 in January with leaders of the
 14th of May movement.   Exiled

 President Stroessner's
 periodic attempts during the
 past two years to liberalize
 the political atmosphere have
 aroused opposition within his
 own Colorado party and have
 been received coldly by opposi-
 tion leaders, who see reform as
 a threat to their plans for
 revolt.   The December invasion,
 despite its quick suppression,
 rattled Stroessner supporters
 and encouraged opposition exiles,
 partly because the rebels
 dramatized their efforts through
 the use of clandestine radio
 transmitters and through arrange-
 ments with Cuba's Prensa Latina
 news agency, which sent a rep-
 resontative to travel with the
 insurgents.
 Economic difficulties

 cial visit from Brazil's for-
 eign  minister                     and  an  indi-
 cation that Argentina now may
 be prepared to crack down more
 strongly on exile movements
 in the border area.
 The two-month-old Italian
 cabinet crisis has been for-
 mally brought to a close by a
 governmental formula which is
 almost identical to that which
 precipitated the crisis.  On
 24 February the government of
 Antonio Segni resigned when
 the conservative Liberal party
 withdrew its support from
 Segni and thereby put the all-
 Christian Democratic govern-
 ment'in the position of de-

 Christian Democrats of having
 immediately to pay the price
 at the polls of tacit parlia-
 mentary alliance with the neo-
 Fascists.
 Circumstances at the out-
 set of the crisis appeared more
 favorable than at any previous
 time for a center-left govern-
 ment, but conservative forces
 were able to block two such at-
 tempts.  There will, however,
 be further skirmishing, if not
 a major showdown during the
 ITALIAN
 PARLIAMENT
 and neo-Fascists--a situation
 deemed by the Christian Demo-
 crats too costly in popular
 votes.
 Now  the Tambroni govern-
 ment, with the approval of the
 Christian Democratic directo-
 rate,has come to power with
 the neo-Fascists as itj only
 other party support in the
 Chamber of Deputies. This sit-
 uation was made possible, in
 part, by the postponement dur-
 ing the course of the crisis of
 scheduled local elections, thus
 removing  the  risk  for  the
 next few months over
 the issue of the par-
 ty's over-all orien-
 tation.
 The party deci-   25X1
 sion on 28 April to
 approve the Tambroni
 government carried
 with it the stipula-
 tion that a meeting
 of the national coun-
 cil, the party's
 highest policy-mak-
 ing body, would be
 held in three weeks,
 and the advocates of center-
 leftism can be expected to re-
 new their campaign to achieve a
 formal revision of the party line.
 President  Gronchi,   his
 long-standing enthusiasm for an
 "opening to the left" presumably
 sharpened by recent conciliatory
 pronouncements from Socialist
 party leader Pietro Nenni, may
 press Tambroni to introduce
 gradually a legislative program
 slanted to the left, thus main-
 taining pressure among the
 Christian Democrats fora clear-
 cut political line.

 stage in a protracted period
 of high-level negotiations.
 This outlook probably precludes
 any move to force a showdown at
 the summit itself or immediate-
 ly after,  prior to President
 Eisenhower's visit to the USSR
 in June. The Soviet leader
 summed up this approach during
 his trip to France by express
 ing "hope that the meeting will
 usher in a series of important
 negotiations between the lead-
 ers of the great powers, with
 the object of putting an and to
 the cold-war policy."
 Moscow's general policy
 line during the pre-summit pe-
 riod has reflected the more con-
 ciliatory posture adopted by
 Khrushchev during his visit to
 the United States.   Moscow has
 endeavored to appear responsive
 to Western views on the timing
 of a summit meeting with no
 fixed agenda.   Except for ad-
 justments in its position on a
 nuclear test ban treaty, how-
 ever, the Soviet Government's
 efforts to create a favorable
 pre-summit atmosphere have not
 gone so far as to presage So-
 viet concessions on major East-
 West issues.
 Germany and Berlin
 Despite Khrushchev's fre-
 quent statements assigning top
 priority to disarmament and his
 intention to negotiate outstand-
 ing issues of a nuclear test ban
 treaty, he probably regards the
 German and Berlin questions as
 the focal point of the summit.
 Over the past few months,  Mos-
 cow has increasingly invoked
 the threat of a separate East
 German peace treaty to soften
 Western resistance to a peace
 treaty with both German states
 converting West Berlin into a
 free city.  Moscow probably
 realizes that, on these issues,
 a change in the status quo would
 be of little advantage to the
 West, and believes that negotia-
 tions are unlikely to be fruit-
 ful for the USSR unless conducted
 under the threat of unilateral
 Soviet action.
 At the same time, Moscow
 does not wish to detract from
 the general policy of detente
 or appear to be repudiating the
 Camp David agreement not to im-
 pose a time limit on negotia-
 tions.  Thus, the threat to sign
 a separate treaty has been am-
 biguously formulated and calcu-
 lated to create uncertainty as
 to the timing and circumstances
 of such action.
 Against this background,
 Khrushchev's initial move at the
 summit on these issues probably
 will be to reintroduce his max-
 imum demands for a peace treaty
 signed by both German govern-
 ments and the establishment of
 a free city in West Berlin. Mod-
 ifications of this position, as
 indicated by authoritative East
 German statements reportedly is-
 sued at Moscow's direction,
 would probably include an offer
 to draft two separate documents
 containing the same basic provi-
 sions, one of which would be
 signed by the Western powers
 with Bonn and the other by the
 bloc with East Germany.
 As a part of his peace trea-
 ty proposal, Khrushchev will
 probably urge that the heads of
 government agree on the underly-
 ing principles.  He will press
 for the establishment of a four-
 power commission to develop the
 details and of an all-German
 commission to present a joint

 proposal to the four powers.
 The Soviet leader may accompany
 such a proposal with an offer
 to hold the Berlin question in
 abeyance during peace treaty
 talks, but within a strictly
 defined time limit. As a fur-
 ther variant, Khrushchev may
 propose declarations ending the
 state of war, which would be
 signed by the bloc and Bonn and
 the Western powers and East Ger-
 many,  citing as a precedent the
 19 October 1956 Soviet-Japanese
 joint declaration.
 However, Khrushchev prob-
 ably does not expect at this
 stage to win Western agreement
 to a four-power commission to
 draft a peace treaty or to an
 all-German committee to discuss
 an expansion of contacts and
 reunification.   Western agree-
 ment to these proposals would
 imply acceptance of the long-
 standing Soviet position that
 conclusion of a peace treaty is
 the only task remaining for the
 four powers and that reunifica-
 tion is the exclusive responsi-
 bility of the two German states,
 Largely for the record,
 Khrushchev will advance as a
 separate issue the 1 June 1959
 proposal to make West Berlin a
 free city, garrisoned either by
 token contingents of all four
 powers or by neutral troops. As
 an ostensible concession, Mos-
 cow may drop its suggestion
 that a Soviet component join
 the "symbolic" Western units in
 West Berlin,. and instead build
 up the UN and neutral role in
 guaranteeing the free city.
 Finally, Khrushchev may
 indicate that the free-city
 status can be reached in stages,
 provided the final goal is ex-
 plicitly spelled out. The first
 stage might not go beyond the
 severance of all ties between
 the Federal Republic and West
 Berlin, with troop reductions
 at a later date.  Agreement to
 a limited first stage, however,
 would probably be contingent on
 a clear commitment to discuss
 further stages at an early date.
 Interim Berlin Agreement
 After the maximum Soviet
 demands have been put forward
 for the record, Khrushchev prob-
 ably will try to move on prompt-
 ly to the question of an interim
 Berlin solution along the lines
 discussed at the Geneva foreign
 ministers' conference in 1959.
 Gromyko recently hinted this in
 a private talk with Ambassadors
 Thompson and Bohlen, and Moscow's
 sharp propaganda criticism of
 alleged Western attempts to can-
 cel out the "positive results"
 of the foreign ministers' nego-
 tiations suggests that the USSR
 considers the Western proposal
 for an interim solution   still..
 open to negotiation.
 Khrushchev may introduce
 certain modifications to make
 the Soviet interim-solution pro-
 posal more palatable to the
 West. He may drop Soviet insist-
 ence on formal East German par-
 ticipation in such an agreement
 and suggest that East Germany
 could be associated by means of
 separate commitments.   He may
 offer to extend the time limit
 on an interim agreement from 18
 months to two or three years,
 and he may refrain from insist-
 ing on linking an interim agree-
 ment to the creation of an all-
 German committee. He can be ex-
 pected to stress that an interim
 solution would not involve any
 change in existing Western ac-
 cess arrangements.
 Khrushchev would probably
 insist, in return, on a Western
 commitment to reduce troops in
 West Berlin,  possibly in phases.
 On the basic question of the
 status of Western rights at the
 expiration of such an agreement,
 there is no evidence that the
 USSR would abandon its opposi-
 tion to explicit confirmation
 of these rights.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1960
 Minimum Aims
 It is unlikely that Khru-
 shchev expects to reach agree-
 ment even on the main elements
 of an interim Berlin solution
 in the few days available to
 the heads of government.   He
 probably will concentrate his
 main efforts on obtaining a
 general statement which Moscow
 could then represent as marking
 Western acceptance of the prin-
 ciple that the Berlin situation
 is "abnormal" and should there-
 fore be modified in the direc-
 tion of ending the ,occupation
 regime" in West Berlin.
 Khrushchev may even be
 satisfied with an agreement to
 resume high-level negotiations
 on Berlin with terms of refer-
 ence which the USSR could in-
 terpret as a step toward an
 eventual change in West Berlin's
 status.   He will be particularly
 vigilant to maintain intact the
 provision of his Camp David
 agreement with President Eisen-
 hower that new negotiations on
 Berlin should not be protracted
 indefinitely.  Therefore, he may
 press for setting a specific
 date for a subsequent summit
 meeting, or at least for another
 foreign ministers' conference.
 Disarmament
 Often' '  in'  the  past, when
 the Soviet leaders have wanted
 to impress world opinion with
 their peaceful and constructive
 purposes, they have turned to
 the disarmament problem. Since
 Khrushchev's speech to the UN,
 Moscow's main effort has been
 to focus on disarmament as the
 central theme of its peaceful
 coexistence campaign and to pre-
 sent a convincing case that the
 USSR is prepared to move toward
 total disarmament.
 In six weeks of actual ne-
 gotiations at the Geneva disar-
 mament conference, however, the
 bloc delegations have resisted
 Western efforts to discuss the
 vital question of effective in-
 ternational controls.  The So-
 viet delegation declined to spell
 out its position, beyond the
 vague and general proposition
 enunciated by Khrushchev that
 the extent of control should be
 commensurate with the various
 stages of the disarmament proc-
 ess.
 Soviet tactics in the nego-
 tiations have been aimed pri-
 marily at obtaining a defini-
 tion, in Soviet terms, of com-
 plete and general disarmament
 as the final goal of the con-
 ference, and winning Western
 agreement to a set of disarma-
 ment principles lifted directly
 from the Soviet plan.   Khru-
 shchev's position at the summit
 will probably be a continuation
 of this effort, with the objec-
 tive of gaining a joint state-
 ment instructing representatives
 in the ten-power committee to
 take into account Soviet and
 other plans in working out the
 framework of a treaty.
 The Soviet leaders would
 probably seek to represent such
 a statement as being tantamount
 to acceptance of the main fea-
 tures of the Soviet plan and
 press the West to agree to pro-
 ceed with a discussion of the
 first stage, which calls for re-
 duction of conventional forces.
 Such tactics would also allow
 Moscow to place the onus for re-
 jecting general disarmament on
 the West,  before permitting the
 talks to shift to specific first
 measures or partial plans.  As a
 secondary position, Khrushchev
 may follow the lines of his com-
 muniqu6s with Presidents Eisen-
 hower and De Gaulle and agree on
 a statement reaffirming general
 disarmament as the most important
 international problem.
 Nuclear Test Ban
 In contrast to its approach
 to disarmament, Moscow has moved
 to narrow the differences on the
 main issues of a nuclear test

 ban treaty in preparation for
 submitting these problems to
 the summit for decision.   Since
 Khrushchev's visit to the United
 States, the USSR has proposed
 compromise solutions on a num-
 bet of key points, while main-
 taining its long-standing posi-
 tion that all tests must be
 banned at the outset of an
 agreement.  After resisting the
 American position on the diffi-
 culty of detecting small under-
 ground tests, Moscow in effect
 acknowledged this position by
 countering a Western proposal
 for a limited treaty with a pro-
 posal for a moratorium on small
 underground explosions.
 Following the Eisenhower-
 Macmillan communique on 29
 March proposing that a morato-
 rium be achieved through unilat-
 eral and voluntary declarations,
 Soviet officials served notice
 that the main issues still out-
 standing, including the nature
 and duration of the moratorium,
 were beyond the competence of
 the Geneva conference and could
 be resolved only at the summit.
 They listed as possible summit
 topics, besides the moratorium
 itself, a quota for on-site in-
 spections, the composition and
 voting procedures of the con-
 trol council, and the staffing
 of control organs.
 Khrushchev has indicated
 that the paramount issue is the
 duration of the moratorium. He
 implied in a speech at Baku on
 25 April that the Soviet sug-
 gestion for one of four to five
 years could be adjusted down-
 ward.   The Soviet premier  has.
 dropped his insistence for formal
 incorporation of the moratorium
 into the treaty, either as an
 annex or protocol,and,accepted:
 a voluntary declaration provid-
 ing agreement is,reached on the
 duration.,.
 Since advancing the pro-
 posal, based on Prime Minister
 Macmillan's suggestion in early
 1959 for an annual quota of on-
 site inspections of suspected
 nuclear explosions, Moscow has
 made this a major element of
 its position on controls but has
 carefully avoided committing it-
 self to a precise figure.   The
 USSR has made it clear that such
 a determination should be based
 on a high-level political deci-
 sion, rather than a scientific
 estimate of the annual number of
 probably natural disturbances
 ,which could be mistaken for nu-
 clear explosions.
 Recently a Soviet official
 at the conference privately ex-
 pressed doubt that Moscow could
 agree to as many as 20 such in-
 spections in the USSR.   Khru-
 shchev is likely to take a sim-
 ilar stand, while pressing for
 American acceptance "in principle"
 of the concept of a quota based
 on an arbitrary political determi-
 nation.
 Other Issues
 Under the general category
 of East-West relations, Khru-
 shchev may attempt to secure an
 agreed definition of principles
 on which these relations should
 be based and set forth his con-
 cept of "peaceful coexistence."
 He may also be prepared to con-
 clude a more generalized agree-
 ment along the lines of the Camp
 David communique, reaffirming
 the four governments' intention
 to settle disputes by negotia-
 tion rather than by force.
 Khrushchev also. plans to
 raise the question of outer
 space, probably in connection
 with UN plans to convene an in-
 ternational scientific confer-
 ence to exchange information on
 peaceful uses.   Soviet repre-
 sentatives in the UN have pri-
 vately urged that the United
 Nation's Outer Space Committee
 meet before the summit and be-
 gin working out plans for the
 conference.   The USSR, however,
 is insisting on a preponderance
 in the key conference posts.
 Khrushchev will probably make
 some gesture to demonstrate
 that the summit has yielded

 results and to create the im-
 pression that the USSR is
 taking the lead in the field
 of peaceful uses of outer space.
 Although Khrushchev has
 deeply engaged his prestige in
 the campaign for a summit con-
 ference and has frequently rep-
 resented such a meeting as the
 most "effective manner" of re-
 solving international problems,
 he has been extremely cautious
 in setting forth any specific
 objective for the initial meet-
 ing.            In his recent remarks in
 France, he limited his expecta-
 tions to a hope to find a "com-
 mon language," and more recent-
 ly in Baku he resorted to  the
 standard expression that  the
 meeting should produce a fur-
 ther relaxation of tensions and
 "advance the  settlement of the
 urgent questions."
 Khrushchev has been equal-
 ly vague in defining the spe-
 West Germany, frequently
 the subject of East-West meet-
 ings, is more apprehensive
 than usual regarding the sum-
 mit conference on 16 May.   Al-
 though expansive economic con-
 ditions keep the mass of the
 population contented, the po-
 litically minded minority seems
 suspicious, uncertain, and gen-
 erally pessimistic about the
 outlook.
 Few Germans seriously be-
 lieve their country will be re-
 unified in the foreseeable fu-
 ture; during the past few
 months they have felt more and
 more isolated from the West and
 have been increasingly fearful
 that even the status quo may
 be sacrificed for the sake of
 an East-West detente.   Many
 Germans accordingly see  the
 summit conference as a major
 test of their allies; should
 the West fail to measure up
 to German expectations, par-
 ticularly with respect to Ber-
 lin, Bonn might become a more
 nationalistic and less reliable
 ally than heretofore.

 restraint in spelling out his
 objectives for the Paris meet-
 ing probably reflects his ex-
 pectation that a series of
 meetings will be held.   At
 Paris he may attempt to gain
 a specific commitment on the
 next meeting.   Such an approach
 is suggested by his speech in
 January to the Supreme Soviet
 when he asserted that "this
 conference will be followed by
 a number of summit meetings"

 provident to try to guess be-

 October that the Germans must
 yet pay a heavy price for the
 "liquidation" of World War II;
 more recently he has given his
 confidants the impression that
 he is fully reconciled to the
 indefinite division of Germany.
 Such views are in keeping with
 a growing recognition in Ger-
 many that certain fundamental
 goals of the Adenauer era are
 becoming increasingly impossible
 to achieve with the passage  of
 time.
 Public enthusiasm behind
 the European integration move-
 ment was particularly strong
 in West Germany during the
 early postwar years, when it
 provided an outlet for nation-
 al frustrations and bad con-
 science.   This now has been
 weakened by a growing confusion
 over objectives and a genuine
 concern in many industrial,com-
 mercial, and political circles
 over the possibility of a per-
 manent split of Western Europe
 into two antagonistic economic
 groupings.
 The Soviet "ultimatum" on
 West Berlin of November 1958
 struck politically  conscious
 Germans with unusual impact,
 since it posed the danger that
 even the present situation   in
 Germany could not be maintained.
 Despite numerous   reassurances
 of American determination to
 stand by Berlin, many govern-
 ment officials and leaders                  of
 public opinion remain fearful
 that the Allies are basically
 unwilling to take any real risks
 to defend Berlin, that they will-
 gradually accommodate themselves
 to the USSR's position on Allied
 occupation rights, and that the
 city's ties with the Federal Re-
 public will, sooner or later,be
 weakened.
 Adenauer has been especial-
 ly troubled by such a prospect,
 because he fears this would al-
 so pose a serious threat to his
 Bonn regime--which must be as-
 sured of Western support and
 which must maintain the illu-
 sion that reunification is at
 least an ultimate goal. Ade-
 nauer indicated pessimism about
 summit prospects when he private-
 ly expressed doubt that he could
 fully rely on the Western powers
 to avoid a dangerous compromise
 on Berlin and observed that not
 all the participants will have
 the game firmness as Khrushchev.
 Recent' Resentments
 Several developments   of
 the past few months have caused
 Germans to question whether in
 fact they are assured of West-
 ern support.   Many accepted as
 justified much of the interna-
 tional criticism that followed
 the anti-Semitic   incidents in
 West Germany last winter,   but
 others were unable  to   under-
 stand why there was concern in
 Allied countries over newspaper
 stories about German military
 bases in Franco Spain.
 Germans saw the effort to
 obtain supply bases in Spain
 as simply a military move es-
 sential to the fulfillment of
 Bonn's NATO obligations.   They
 were quick to recall that there
 had been no similar controversy
 over military cooperation  by
 other NATO countries with   the
 Franco regime and frequently
 interpreted the criticism as
 indicating a fundamental lack
 of trust on the part of Bonn's
 allies.   There were bitter re-
 marks about the Federal Repub-
 lic having only a second-class
 status in NATO".
 Many Germans also feel
 that their NATO partners have
 not supported  them  strongly
 enough in the face of the con-
 stant  Communist  propaganda
 barrage picturing the Federal
 Republic as "militarist," ""neo-
 Nazi," "revenge-hungry," and a
 threat to world peace. Bonn
 fears that such propaganda has
 created an unfavorable public
 impression of Germany in free-
 world countries, and this fear

 Policy Alternatives
 For years past there have
 been    calls for a new orienta-
 tion of West German foreign
 policy,   geared primarily to
 the hope of finding a solution
 to the unification issue.   The
 opposition parties  have   pro-
 posed such schemes as arms
 limitation, troop withdrawal
 in Central Europe,  and  the
 military and political neutral-
 ization of Germany. More recent-
 ly, Defense Minister Strauss
 has suggested in two or three
 little-noticed press interviews
 the withdrawal of Allied troops
 from Germany, Bonn's withdrawal
 from NATO,   and  international
 control of German armed forces
 --all in return for free elec-
 tions to determine the future
 of East Germany, including its
 social structure.
 There are also voices  on
 the right, iftdluding some with-
 in the Christian Democratic
 Union (CDU) itself, calling for
 Germany to be more assertive in
 Western councils and  to stand
 up for'its own rights and  in-
 terests.   Many, especially with-
 in the CDU, are inclined to seek
 greater military strength  for
 the Federal Republic.
 Adenauer welcomed develop-
 ment of France's nuclear capa-
 bility, feeling that it was of
 capability at their disposal.
 German Outlook
 The American Embassy  in
 Bonn believes that despite the
 mistrust and resentments,
 Adenauer and most of Bonn's
 military and governmental lead-
 ers are still convinced that
 the Federal Republic's security
 can be assured only by retaining
 its close ties with the West.
 This conviction springs both
 from a positive desire to be
 part of the free Western com-
 munity  and from a belief that
 Bonn has no tolerable alterna-
 tive. Any rapprochement with
 the Soviet Union on the model
 of the 1922 Rapallo treaty--in
 which the USSR renounced repara-
 tions from the Weimar Republic--
 is seen as at best extremely
 dangerous and at worst utterly
 disastrous.
 Nevertheless,an Allied com-
 promise on Berlin which the Ger-
 mans would interpret as a threat
 to the city's status,coupled with
 a continuing feeling that Germany
 is isolated and relegated to an
 inferior status, could sooner or
 later discredit the solidly pro-
 Western elements of the CDU and
 encourage West Germany to explore
 new means of pursuing its own par-
 ticular national interests. Even
 though unchanged in basic orienta-
 tion,a Federal Republic of this
 increasingly nationalistic char- 25X1
 acter would be a more difficult
 and less dependable ally.

 Such a program, however,
 would not only considerably dis-
 rupt Japan's present trading
 relationships--in many instances
 it would endanger domestic in-
 dustries, cause a large payments
 deficit, and drain foreign ex-
 change.   To reduce the impact
 of liberalization, the Japanese
 Government is considering broad-
 ening tariff schedules and rais-
 ing its low tariff rates.
 Japan's sugar purchases il-
 lustrate its problem.   Japan
 imports annually some 1,200,000
 metric tons of sugar. Of this
 amount, Cuba in 1959 supplied
 42 percent; Taiwan, 26 percent;
 Brazil, the Dominican Republic,
 Peru, and Ecuador together,  17
 percent; and Australia, 12 per-
 cent,   A smaller amount is pro-
 duced domestically by a grow-
 ing but high-cost industry
 which hopes in ten years to re-
 duce present import needs by
 half. In Brazil and Taiwan,
 Japan pays more than the market
 price for sugar in order to pro-
 tect export markets or other
 interests in those countries.
 Cuba has pressed Japan to in-
 crease  purchases.

 Japan's largest trading partner,
 on both the import and export
 side.   Japan is the second larg-
 est market,   after Canada,   for
 US  exports and the principal
 foreign purchaser of American
 agricultural products. Between
 1957 and 1959, Japanese sales
 in the US jumped 75 percent and
 purchases 30 percent.   In 1959,
 for the first time, Tokyo vir-
 tually balanced its merchandise
 trade with the US--at approxi-
 mately one billion dollars each
 way.    Income for US official
 and military personnel expendi-
 tures in the postwar period us-
 ually has given Japan annual
 surpluses in its over-all for-
 eign exchange account.
 The phenomenal growth in,
 sales to the TIntte.d,. States::ha.s
 occurred despite rising American
 pressures for restrictive meas-
 ures against imports from Japan.
 Low prices on many products, in-
 cluding quality items such as
 electronics equipment and opti-
 cal  goods,   have  stimulated
 charges of unfair competition
 and led to Japanese Government
 enforcement of a schedule of
 "check prices" below which items
 cannot be exported to the United
 States.   Even so, prices remain
 low. Tokyo has also established
 export quotas on items against
 which pressures are strongest,
 such as stainless steel flat-
 ware,  cotton and woolen textiles,
 plywood, sewing machines, um-
 brellas, and umbrella frames.
 The major irritant in US-
 Japanese trade relations is the
 prospective imposition by the
 US of an "equalization fee," or
 special tariff, against cotton
 textile imports  from  Japan,
 which in 1959 totaled $110,000,-
 000.   Japanese textile inter-
 ests are threatening to disre-
 gard export quotas, which they
 established with the understand-
 ing that the US would not raise
 tariff rates.
 South and Southeast Asia
 The relative impor.t.ance.of
 South and Southeast Asia in-Jap-
 anese trade has declined appre-
 ciably in the  postwar  period
 despite Tokyo's reparations pro-
 gram, which it hoped would re-
 duce animosity toward Japan and
 pave the way for close economic
 ties.
 Japanese trade with the
 Philippines has doubled since
 1955, despite frequently stormy
 economic relations; trade with
 Indonesia, the other major repa-
 rations recipient, has declined.

 40 percent of the increased oil
 production in the :I-next'  ten
 years, marks a major break-
 through.   Japan's failure to
 purchase nearly as much as it
 sells to Thailand and Burma,
 as a resu.lt'. `of ,a sharply reduced
 need for imported rice, has
 caused severe strains with those
 countries.
 Japan is participating in
 the economic development of In-
 dia in a special manner. Tokyo
 has extended yen credits to
 India in the amount of $70,000,-
 000 for purchases of equipment
 in Japan; $21,000,000 to devel-
 op iron-ore resources and re-
 lated rail and port facilities
 at Bailadila, to be repaid in
 preferentially priced iron-ore
 shipments at the rate of 4,-
 000,000 tons annually for 15
 years beginning in 1966; and
 $8,000,000 earmarked for a co-
 operative venture with the US
 in developing iron-ore mining
 and transport facilities at
 Orissa.
 Until recently Japan has
 regarded Latin America, with
 its large potential for economic
 growth and relative absence of
 antagonism toward the Japanese,
 as second only to Southeast
 Asia in market prospects. More-
 over, this area's unusual re-
 ceptivity to investments and
 participation in management has
 attracted one third of Japanese
 overseas equity investment. The
 principal investments are in a
 steel mill and shipyard in
 Brazil and a textile plant in
 Mexico.   Japan is now seeking
 to make further copper invest-
 ments in Chile, Peru, and Bo-
 livia.
 In 1959, Japan achieved
 virtual balance in its trade
 with Latin America,  but almost
 one third of total exports,
 valued at $242,000,000, con-
 sisted of ships for Panamanian

 relations with this area have
 been disappointing to the Jap-
 anese.
 Japanese officials believe
 that exports to Latin America
 will amount to less than $200,-
 000,000 in 1960, partly because
 of an expected cutback in ship
 sales and because some Latin
 American countries are ex-
 periencing foreign exchange
 shortages and except for min-
 erals and cotton,  lack export
 commodities needed by Japan.
 As a result of a 40-percent
 drop in Brazilian exports to
 Japan since 1955, principally
 because of high pricing and
 Japanese purchase commitments
 elsewhere, Rio de Janeiro has
 incurred a trade debt which
 Tokyo is seeking to alleviate--
 if only to protect its invest-
 ments and the postwar emigra-
 tion program, which thus far
 has enabled 25,000 Japanese to
 resettle in Brazil.   On the
 other hand, Japan suffers an-

 Mexico and Cuba--a total of
 $132,000,000 in 1959.  A severe

 dominant influence in the rise
 of Arab nationalism.   In 1958,
 Tokyo established a credit of
 $30,000,000 for the UAR to pur-
 chase Japanese industrial equip-

 Nasir's prestige among the
 Japanese dropped, and Tokyo has
 shifted to a broader Middle

 area.             Tokyo believes that it
 can compete with other nations
 of the free world, and it is
 also anxious to prevent Soviet
 penetrations in the Middle East.
 In 1959, 88 percent of
 Japanese imports from the Middle
 East consisted of crude oil;
 purchases other than Oil were
 valued at $40,000,000.   Iran,
 the area's largest importer of
 Japanese products, purchased
 less than $50,000,000 worth of
 commodities during the same year.
 Eighty percent of Japan's
 oil requirements are filled by
 Middle Eastern producers. Crude
 oil is Japan's largest single
 import item and is consumed al-
 most wholly in the domestic
 market at a heavy dollar cost
 to the Japanese Government.  In
 order to reduce foreign exchange
 expenditures for oil, the Japa= ---
 nese have acted in the past two
 years to develop nondollar
 sources through semibartei+,ar-
 rangements with the USSR, an
 economic assistance agreement
 to develop oil fields in Indo-
 nesia, and the exploitation of
 an offshore concession in the
 Persian Gulf granted by Saudi
 Arabia and Kuwait.
 Japan made its first oil
 strike in its Persian Gulf con-
 cession in January 1960, and it
 is reliably estimated that in
 five years production will amount
 to 30 percent of present Japa-
 nese crude oil imports.   By
 1963 the Japanese Government
 is expected to invest $180,000,-
 000 in this project, a sum
 which will limit Tokyo's par-
 ticipation in Other internation-
 al economic ventures.
 Africa is an important
 textile market for Japan, but
 it thus far offers little at-
 traction to Japanese purchasers.
 In 1959 the sale of ships to
 Liberia exceeded $200,000,000
 in value, while the balance of
 Afro-Japanese trade approximated
 $100,000,000 each way.   Tokyo
 is showing some interest in pro-
 viding technical assistance to
 Africa and in developing iron.
 ore resources in Rhodesia and
 Guinea as new sources of supply.
 Europe
 European and Japanese eco-
 nomic relations are more competi-
 tive than complementary, and are
 limited almost exclusively to
 trade.  The sole exception is
 Tokyo's extension of a $10,000,-
 000 credit to Yugoslavia in
 1959 for the purchase of Japa-
 nese plants and equipment.
 Japan regards as a threat
 the development of multination-
 al common markets which give

 5 May 1960
 trade with Europe in 1959 was
 roughly $350,000,000 each way,
 with a slight surplus accruing
 to Japan.   Its major trading
 partners, in order of importance,
 were the United Kingdom, West
 Germany, the Netherlands, Swit-
 zerland, France, Belgium, and
 Sweden.
 Japan's troublesome trade
 relations with Britain illus-
 trate its problems with other
 European countries.   Both coun-
 tries seek to protect domestic
 industries, and Tokyo claims
 that British tariffs and quota
 restrictions apply more severe-
 ly to Japanese products than
 to those of any other nation.
 The Japanese have been especial-
 ly disturbed by Britain's in-
 vocation of Article XXXV of the
 General Agreement on Trade and
 Tariffs, which in effect re-
 vokes preferential trade treat-
 ment for a member country. Ja-
 pan is most concerned about
 how to increase exports of cot-
 ton textile and optical goods
 to the UK.
 London claims that Japanese
 quota restrictions and foreign
 exchange controls discriminate
 against British goods, notably
 woolens and automobiles.   De-
 spite these differences, how-
 ever,  total trade between the
 countries in 1959 was valued
 at slightly more than $200,000,
 000, double the 1955 level, and
 the UK has succeeded in bringing
 accounts with Japan into balance.
 Communist Bloc
 Trade with the Sino-Soviet
 bloc is negligible.   It amounted
 in 1959 to $106,000,000--approx-
 imately one half of the postwar
 peak, which was attained in 1957
 --and constituted 1.5 percent of
 total Japanese trade. Although
 the bulk of present bloc=Japanese-
 trade is with the USSR, Japan
 depends on North Vietnam for
 most of its anthracite coal.
 The decline in Japanese
 trade with the bloc is due prin-
 cipally to Communist China's
 suspension of trade in May 1958
 for political reasons.   Prior
 to World War II, mainland China
 supplied 13 percent of Japanese
 imports and took 24 percent of
 its exports.   In 1957, Sino-
 Japanese trade had reached an
 annual total of $141,000,000,
 and in early 1958, just prior
 to the trade rupture, an agree-
 ment had been signed for an ex-
 change over a five-year period
 of $280,000,000 worth of Chi-
 nese coal and iron ore for Jap-
 anese iron and steel products.
 Many Japanese hope to re-
 gain a substantial portion of
 prewar trade with China and are
 anxious for a political settle-
 ment between Tokyo and Peiping.
 Others, who realize that res-
 toration  of large-scale trade
 with mainland China is virtually
 impossible, are anxious to ex-
 ploit whatever possibilities
 exist.
 The Japanese have been re-
 luctant to enter into long-term
 economic arrangements with the
 USSR or to become dependent on
 Moscow for items which cannot
 be quickly procured elsewhere.
 Recently, however, a new enthu-
 siasm has developed for trade
 with the USSR.   wince its formal
 resumption in 1956, Soviet-Japa-
 nese trade has grown from $4,000,-
 000 to a projected $125,000,000
 for 1960.
 Japan and the USSR recently
 signed a three-year trade agree-
 ment under which Tokyo will sup-
 ply heavy industrial products,
 presumably for Siberian economic
 development, and will purchase
 increased amounts of timber,
 coal, and crude oil. Tokyo also
 has agreed in principle to ex-
 tend credits to the USSR for
 some purchases in Japan, while
 Moscow is expected to supply
 1,000,000 tons of crude oil to
 Japan in 1960.   This amount is
 a tenfold increase over 1959
 and about 5 percent of Japan's
 present crude oil imports.

 Economic Assistance Program
 Reparations programs,  ex-
 tensions of credit to various
 countries, and a-proposal for
 a Southeast Asia Development
 Fund have created the mislead-
 ing impression that Japan is
 initiating a substantial capi-
 tal-export program to assist
 underdeveloped countries.   Al-
 though the Japanese are in an
 excellent position to provide
 technological assistance to
 such countries--and are doing
 so--they prefer to implement
 their limited capital-export
 program either in bi-
 lateral projects
 which assure them
 large quantities of
 vital raw materials
 or in connection with
 an international con-
 sortium, largely fi-
 nanced by other coun-
 tries, which would
 utilize Japanese
 equipment and tech-
 nical and managerial
 skills.

 them recently incurred--for pur-

 Japan's program in India
 is relatively adventurous, but
 elsewhere in Asia the Japanese
 have exercised extreme caution
 in pursuing their much-publicized

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1960
 Three milestones are
 being observed in North Vietnam
 this year.   The first, on 6
 January, commemorated the 30th
 anniversary of the Indochinese
 Communist party--now called the
 Lao Dong (Workers) party;  the
 second will be the 70th birth-
 day celebration of President
 Ho Chi Minh on 19 May; and the
 third, on 2 September, will
 mark the 15th year of "nation-
 al independence."
 The regime has expanded
 party membership and plans to
 hold  the  first party congress
 since 1953 and the first elec-
 tions to the National Assembly
 since 1946.   A new constitution
 is to be promulgated and a Three-
 Year Plan, which began in 1958
 and called for the "basic com-
 pletion of the socialization of
 agriculture,"  is  tea: be  com-
 pleted.
 The Party
 The Lao Dong party in 1956
 claimed a membership of 700,000,
 a relatively high percentage of
 the 13,000,000 population. Very
 few new members have been ad-
 mitted since the cease-fire in
 1954 and party membership was
 actually declining, both through
 attrition.  and as a result of
 the expulsion of those members--
 particularly in rural areas--
 whose loyalty had come under
 fire.   To halt this drift,  the
 party late last year held its
 first major recruitment drive,
 aimed at attracting younger
 elements, to commemorate the
 party's 30th anniversary. Some
 20,000 new members reportedly
 were recruited.
 Party statutes call for a
 national party congress every
 three years, but the regime,
 ignoring the wartime congress
 of 1953, states in its official
 histories that the last con-
 gress was held in 1951.   The
 "third party congress'' is sched-
 uled. for September and will
 probably coincide with "Inde-
 pendence Day" celebrations on
 2 September.   Items on the
 agenda include revision of the
 party statutes and the election
 of a new central committee and
 other organs.
 The top party and govern-
 ment leadership has been marked-
 ly stable.  This year, however,
 there will probably be some ad-
 ditions to the central commit-
 tee, most likely specialists
 and technicians who have made
 their mark since the French
 were expelled.   It also is,quite
 possible that Ho Chi Minh is
 planning a partial withdrawal
 from active politics and will
 resign as party secretary gen-
 eral but remain as party chair-
 man.  At any rate,  it will not
 be long before power devolves
 on younger men,  and   it   seems

 likely that it will ultimately
 fall'into the hands of militant
 activists such as Truong Chinh
 and Le Duan,  who are normally
 ranked immediately below Ho in
 the party hierarchy.
 New Constitution and Elections
 The liberal 1946 constitu-
 tion, designed to appeal to all
 Vietnamese nationalists, was
 never put into effect, and the
 regime has been operating with-
 out any basic statute.   Member-
 ship in the National Assembly
 has dwindled from the original
 333 elected in January 1946 to
 about 220.   High offices, such
 as the vice presidency, have
 been vacant for years,  and the
 legal and judicial systems are
 extremely primitive and under-
 manned.
 A committee worked for
 over two years to write a new
 constitution.   The finished
 draft, promulgated early this
 year,   closely  resembles  the
 Chinese Communist constitution.
 The regime subsequently an-
 nounced that elections for the
 National Assembly will be held
 on 8 May.   This step has been
 postponed as long as possible,
 because the original elections
 had been nationwide in scope,
 and to hold separate elections
 in the north would weaken Ha-
 noi's claim to sovereignty over
 the entire country.  To circum-
 vent this, the election law
 calls for all members of the
 National Assembly elected from
 the southern areas in 1946 to
 retain their seats.
 Relations With Its Neighbors
 North  Vietnam  recently
 scored an important propaganda
 victory when Guinea became the
 first free world country to
 grant it de jure recognition.
 Negotiations were concluded last
 summer with Bangkok for the re-
 patriation of the large majority
 --90,000--of the Vietnamese
 living in Thailand, who opted
 for repatriation.   More than
 3,500 now have returned from
 Thailand, with much fanfare.
 In its efforts to pose as
 a peace-loving state abiding
 by the terms of the cease-fire
 settlement negotiated in Geneva
 in 1954, the North Vietnamese
 regime attempts to dissociate
 itself from Communist-inspired
 disturbances  in  both  South
 Vietnam and Laos.  The regime
 continues to assure its people
 that the reunification of Viet-
 nam is only a matter of time,
 and pictures subversive activi-
 ties against the Saigon authori-
 ties as acts of the local popu-
 lation revolting against the
 "American 'imperialists  and
 their lackeys."
 Although Hanoi supported
 the Pathet Lao insurrection
 last summer,  it has subsequent-
 ly allowed the situation to die
 down, presumably under bloc
 pressure for "peaceful coexist-
 ence," On 4 April, Premier Pham
 Van Dong sent a mildly worded
 note to the Laotian premier
 suggesting that they negotiate
 their differences.   Hanoi's
 policy regarding Laos, follow-
 ing the recent election there,
 will be guided by Moscow's and
 Peiping's other international
 considerations.
 Armed Forces
 North Vietnam continues to
 work toward a modern, efficient
 armed force along the lines of
 the Chinese Communist military
 establishment, assuring it of
 military predominance on the
 Indochinese peninsula.   The
 strong, effective 270,000-man
 army is composed of 13 infantry
 divisions, an artillery divi-
 sion,                                                        13 separate infantry reg-
 iments, and security forces.
 Troop disposition has been
 relatively stable since 1954,
 although there have been some
 reports of troop movements along
 the Laotian border.  The general

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1960
 pattern of troop deployment is
 that of a strategic battle corps
 located in the Red River delta,
 with additional troops thinly
 distributed about the periphery
 of the country to strengthen
 the frontier guard and perform
 missions such as road building.
 An embryonic air force and
 marine element have come into
 being.   The air force,  although
 a separate service, is still
 little more than an administra-
 tive organization,  inasmuch as
 North Vietnam has only a few
 light training aircraft, two
 helicopters, and several trans-
 ports.  The marine element has
 recently received several Swa-
 tow-class gunboats from Com-
 munist China, thereby increas-
 ing its coastal-patrol capa-
 bility,   Neither, element has an
 offensive capability.
 The formation of the Peo-
 ple's Armed Security Forces was
 reported in September 1959. Its
 missions were described as "pro-
 tection of the frontiers,  the
 17th parallel, and coastline."
 These missions were previously
 army responsibilities,  and the
 Frontier Guard and the Coastal
 Security Regiments probably
 have been taken into the Peo-
 ple's Armed Security Forces.
 The appointment of Brig. Gen;
 Phan Trong Tue, vice minister
 of public security, as command-
 er of this new security force
 indicates that these forces are
 subordinate to the Ministry of
 Public Security rather than to
 the Defense Ministry.
 The Economy
 On the economic front,  the
 regime is also trying to mod-
 ernize its facilities.                                                                        Comple-
 tion of the Three-Year Plan in
 1960 and preparation of the
 first five-year plan are already
 being heralded in the press as
 tremendous achievements.          North
 Vietnam has apparently achieved
 self-sufficiency in food at an
 austerity level, an important
 step forward for an area which
 was long a net importer of rice.
 The Three-Year Plan as a
 whole,  however,  will almost cer-
 tainly fall considerably short
 of its original goals.   In in-
 dustry, which at present is
 much less important than agri-
 culture,   the  regime                                                                  has  met
 with  little  success,   and
 there seems to be particular
 difficulty in construction and
 coal  production.    The  rice
 goal for this last year of the
 Three-Year Plan, first set for
 7,600,000  tons,   has  been
 downgraded  to  5,400,000--a
 target  which  the   regime
 will probably boast of having
 attained,  It remains to be
 seen what effect the complete
 socialization of agriculture,
 scheduled for the end of 1960,
 will have on agricultural pro-
 duction,
