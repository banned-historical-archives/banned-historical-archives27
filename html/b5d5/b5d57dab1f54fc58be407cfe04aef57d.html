 Since the Berlin conference, the governments of
 Western Europe have taken positions increasingly in dis-
 agreement with those of the United States.                       Popular
 criticism of American inflexibility and impetuosity has
 also increased and is now widespread.  This trend is
 partly a reflection of lessened dependence on American
 aid.  Primarily, however, it stems from a reassessment
 of the Soviet threat and the belief that Washington has
 failed to adjust its policies accordingly.

 THE SOVIET WORLD
 The Soviet-Iranian financial and border negotiations
 which began a year ago now appear to be approaching a settle-
 ment.   It seems likely that the USSR will release some
 $21,000,000 in gold and credits held in Moscow and will make
 minor territorial concessions to Iran along the Azerbaijan
 frontier in return for a salient north of Firezeh east of
 the Caspian.
 A conciliatory attitude on the part of the Kremlin has
 been evident in its recent relations with Tehran.   The two
 countries signed the 1954 barter agreement on 17 June, pro-
 viding for the first time for substantial Soviet exports of
 trucks and spare parts and for larger exports of machinery
 and automobiles.  Talks are also being held in preparation
 for Iranian purchase of the long-inactive Iranian-Soviet Oil
 Company installations.  Last week end the Soviet Union was
 scheduled to return 300 Iranian political prisoners, freed
 under the Soviet amnesty decree.
 It is still possible that the Soviet Union will attach
 unacceptable political conditions to its agreement--such
 for example as ousting American military and technical per-
 sonnel from Iran.   The release of the gold and credits without
 such conditions would probably reflect a major upward revision
 by the Kremlin of its appraisal of Western influence in the
 area.   It might also foreshadow offers of economic and techni-
 cal assistance similar to those Moscow recently offered to
 Afghanistan.
 A full-dress treatment by Pravda on 3 July of the Churchill-
 Eisenhower talks repeated the s awn and Soviet positions on major
 world problems.  The tone of the Pravda editorial was one of
 disappointment and irritation wit   reat Britain for making con-
 cessions under American pressure, but the editorial claimed that
 many American-British differences were left unresolved.  Pravda
 warned Great Britain and "other capitalist countries" of possible
 catastrophic consequences of embarging on a course of concession
 to "aggressive American forces," and implied that France is an
 innocent victim of Anglo-American exlusivism.  Ambassador Bohlen
 notes that the reprinting of the editorial in Izvestia and other
 Moscow newspapers the following day is unusual and, emphasizes its
 importance in Soviet eyes.

 Moscow's initial propaganda on the new Guatemalan govern-
 ment claimed that Ambassador Peurifoy had maneuvered a "well-
 prepared suppression of a national liberation movement."  In
 view of current emphasis on nationalism, international Com-
 munist propagandists probably consider it most profitable to
 depict the revolution as the first suppression of a "national
 liberation movement" in Latin America.
 While the official Soviet announcement of the opening
 of an atomic electric power station on 27 June was brief and
 factual, subsequent Orbit propaganda has emphasized that this
 is the first atomic-operated power plant in the world.  The
 timing of the announcement may reflect the Kremlin's reaction
 to what the USSR considers an American intention to move ahead
 with the "Atomic Pool" without Soviet co-operation.
 At the same time, it gives momentum to the Communist propa-
 g.nda campaign, apparent since mid-March, which has sought to
 impress the world with Soviet atomic capabilities but simultane-
 ously  to contrast the USSR's alleged peaceful intentions with
 the irresponsibility of thosewho would base foreign policy on
 the use of atomic weapons.

 FRENCH-VIETNAMESE RELATIONS NEAR BREAKING
 POINT OVER TONKIN WITHDRAWAL
 The circumstances under which the French military
 authorities have carried out the withdrawal of their forces
 from the southern sector of the Tonkin delta have imposed
 such a strain on French-Vietnamese relations that the total
 collapse of the French Union system in Vietnam in the near
 future is not impossible.  The American embassy in Saigon
 reports increasingly overt hatred among Vietnamese toward
 occidentals in general and the French in particular.
 Vietnamese leaders contend that the withdrawal is unjusti-
 fied, that it was carried out in a unilateral fashion which
 precluded the taking of appropriate emergency measures on the
 part of the Vietnamese civil authorities, and that it was in
 violation of specific pledges given to the Vietnamese.   The
 most damaging charge against the French is that the withdrawal
 was made pursuant to a secret French understanding with the
 Viet Minh.  Although certain circumstantial evidence tends to
 support this contention, the French authorities emphatically
 deny the existence of such an agreement.
 Vietnamese officials also note that weapons-which the
 French have repeatedly promised for the arming of a militia
 in Tonkin have been withheld for so long that the French can
 now argue that it would no longer be safe to arm the militia.
 Vietnamese anger at this French "betrayal" is particularly
 evident among leaders of the predominantly Catholic population
 of southern Tonkin, where some 7,000,000 persons are now sub-
 ject to a virtually unopposed occupation by the Viet Minh.
 Ngo Dinh Diem, the premier-designate and the most prominent
 Catholic layman in Vietnam, vigorously sought,  and at one time
 believed he had obtained, a French pledge to defend this area.
 The highest. French officials in Indochina have engaged in
 several long and stormy sessions with Diem, attempting to per-
 suade him of the military necessity for the withdrawal.   The
 request by the chief French civil official that the American
 embassy exert a "steadying influence" on Diem indicates these
 efforts have not been entirely successful.
 Diem has threatened to declare
 Vietnam's independence outside the French Union if further
 withdrawals from delta areas are not stopped.

 Despite the wrangling and rivalry so prevalent among
 Vietnamese politicians, there is virtually unanimous agreement
 that partition of the country is no solution.  Leaders who are
 close to Ngo Dinh Diem are said to be arguing that since the
 French are apparently bent on selling Vietnam out to the
 Communists, the best move for the Vietnamese authorities is to
 seek direct contact with the Viet Minh.  There is little ques-
 tion that Vietnamese in general believe the prospects of under-
 cutting Viet Minh strength through political struggle within a
 unified Vietnam--however slight--are nevertheless better than
 the prospects of achieving the same result through a military
 showdown with the Viet Minh, once the latter have occupied all
 of Tonkin.
 Although Vietnamese anger toward the French has found no
 expression thus far except in utterances of helpless and bitter
 frustration and desperate pleas that the United States supplant
 France, the possibility of more direct action is growing. I
 The bishop o  Bui    u told the American consul in
 Hanoi that Vietnamese troops in southern Tonkin had branded as
 traitors Vietnamese officers who transmitted French withdrawal
 orders, and there was talk of a "coup d'etat" in the area.
 Many Vietnamese troops have refused to leave southern
 Tonkin.  Vietnamese officials justify this refusal on the
 grounds that the French have deserted the Vietnamese, rather
 than the reverse.  The problem of discipline among native
 troops will become still more acute in the event of a French
 withdrawal from all of Tonkin.  More than a quarter of the
 French regular army troops in Indochina are Vietnamese, a
 fact which might, with worsening French-Vietnamese relations,
 gravely imperil the security of French troops.

 The Castillo Armas revolution in Guatemala has been
 almost unanimously attributed by the rest of Latin America
 to the intervention of Washington acting through the govern-
 ments of Honduras and Nicaragua.   Some governments have
 voiced approval, but "anti-intervention" demonstrations and
 editorials have been widespread and in some cases violent.
 Many government officials have hinted that Washington either
 suffers from excessive anti-Communist zeal or is unduly in-
 fluenced by the interests of the United Fruit Company.
 During the early days of the crisis, many governments
 appeared stunned by Guatemala's by-passing of the Organization
 of American States in favor of working with the Soviet Union
 in the United Nations.   Most of them expressed fear that the
 future of inter-American regional machinery was in grave
 danger, and 14 of them agreed to back a call for an OAS
 meeting based on Washington's draft resolution setting up
 measures to combat the Guatemalan threat.   Only eight had
 previously agreed to accept the resolution.
 After the initial shock of the UN appeal wore off,
 however, a number of governments took the attitude that it
 would be impossible to discuss charges against Guatemala with-
 out discussing Guatemala's own complaints.                     A 28 June Uru-
 guayan proposal to alter the conference agenda to this effect
 was voted down in the OAS Council but received the support of
 Ecuador, Argentina, Chile, and Mexico.   The last three of these
 countries have also rejected Washington's request that they
 refuse political asylum to Arbenz followers.
 Most of the attacks on the United States have stemmed from
 the belief that Washington intervened in the affairs of another
 country.   Many of the anti-interventionist demonstrations--
 which took on major proportions in Argentina, Mexico, Chile,
 Uruguay, Honduras and Panama--were touched off by pro-Communist
 student and labor groups but were joined by large numbers of
 non-Communists.   In Argentina, the Senate passed a resolution
 reaffirming the principles of self-determination and political
 and economic independence as standards for the hemisphere.   The
 major Argentine labor federation issued a declaration that
 "every nation has the right to solve its own problems without
 outside interference."     The Chilean lower house refused per-
 mission for the foreign minister to attend the OAS meeting
 scheduled to discuss only Washington's case against the Arbenz
 regime.

 In Mexico, students laid a black-draped wreath at the
 door of the American embassy "in memory of the good neighbor
 policy."  In Uruguay,. and elsewhere, normally pro-American papers
 accused the United States of acting "hastily" and "without
 regard for juridical order."
 In only six countries--Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
 Costa Rica, Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru--has the press been
 relatively free from criticism of American "intervention."
 Except in these countries and possibly Colombia, that portion
 of the press which tended to ignore the issue of Washington's
 "intervention" and to explain the nature of international
 Communism has been all but drowned out.   In Brazil, for ex-
 ample, where the government has been attempting to reconcile
 diplomatic differences between the United States and Latin
 America, almost the entire noncontrolled. press and radio'has
 expressed suspicion of American motives,
 The Guatemalan crisis has also given rise to fears
 wider than those of American "intervention" and "dollar
 diplomacy."  Ecuadoran president Velasco reportedly fears
 the Guatemalan. crisis sets a precedent for Peruvian invasion
 of Ecuador and in a 2 July speech called for reaffirmation
 of the "juridical" principles which protect weak nations.
 Meanwhile, another sort of criticism of the United States
 has been voiced by officials in the Dominican Republic,
 Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.   These officials have accused Wash-
 ington of "poor timing" and of giving the insurgents too little
 aid to ensure success.   The Panamanian foreign minister, on the
 other hand, said on 23 June he believed the United States' po-
 sition was fully defensible but that it had been presented
 badly.
 A number of governments have been disturbed by the in-
 tensity of popular reaction, and it is believed that the Ar-
 gentine government has warned the press against further attacks.
 Bolivia is thought to have censored all press comment from the
 beginning.
 The major points of irritation may be somewhat smoothed
 by the indefinite postponement of the OAS meeting on 2 July and
 by the filing of antitrust proceedings against the United Fruit
 Company on the same day; no specific reaction to these moves
 has yet been noted, however.

 SATELLITE PRODUCTION FAILURES LEAD
 TO "STRETCH-OUT".OF NEW COURSE*
 Following a year of general failure in the Eastern European
 Satellites to meet the initial production goals of the economic
 "new course," the duration of the program has been extended
 beyond the initial two-year period and prospects for ultimate
 success are thereby improved.   Plans for the next several years
 call for increased allocations of labor and materials to the
 critical sectors of the Satellite economies and for further
 integration of the bloc countries in order to promote more
 efficient use of resources (see chart, p. 12).
 Originally the regimes changed from a policy of coercion
 to one of the increased use of incentives to bring about satis-
 factory progress while the shift in investments from heavy
 industry to consumer goods industries was being effected.  This
 shift in emphasis has, however, resulted chiefly in expectations
 of further concessions, especially among the peasants, rather
 than in the increased supply of foodstuffs and consumer goods
 which the Satellite leaders apparently hoped for when they out-
 lined the aims of the new course in 195,3.
 The downward revision of 1953 industrial goals permitted
 some reallocation of resources, and hence some increases in pro-
 duction of manufactured consumer goods, although less than
 planned.
 On the other side of the ledger, unfavorable weather
 damaged winter crops and delayed spring plowing and sowing, making
 it unlikely that 1954 crops will be better than the inadequate
 level  of 1953.
 Satellite plans for meeting new course goals in 1954 in-
 clude the sacrifice of immediate military expansion.   Satellite
 budgets reveal that direct military expenditures are to level
 off in 1954 in contrast to the steady, substantial increases of
 earlier years.   Such allocations this year range from a small
 increase in Czechoslovakia to a 37-percent decrease in Rumania,
 with most of the countries allocating about the same amounts
 to the military as in 1953, or slightly less.   While some appro-
 priations for defense are normally budgeted under the heading
 of "financing the national economy," increases in this cate-
 gory are. generally smaller than in previous years, and they
 contain larger outlays for investments in agriculture, consumer
 goods industries and the fuel and power sectors.   Thus, it is

 unlikely that increased defense appropriations are hidden in
 this part of the budgets.
 Even with the apparent decline in military allocations
 and in the rate of increase of heavy industrial production,
 most of the Satellites have had difficulties in fulfilling
 their industrial plans so far in 1954.   Poland was the only
 country announcing fulfillment of its first quarter plan.
 East Germany and Hungary met their first quarter plans by 97
 percent and 98.4 percent respectively.   The remaining Satellites
 did not announce their first quarter plan results, an unusual
 omission which in itself carries an implication of unsatisfactory
 progress.
 Rumania appears to be experiencing the most serious dif-
 ficulties, for industrial production in the last quarter of
 1953 was below the level of the previous year and apparently
 no significant improvement has occurred.   In addition, there
 has been no price cut on consumer goods in Rumania, which,
 taken with the wage and salary cuts imposed early this year,
 indicates a definite lack of progress in meeting new plan targets.
 Soviet and Satellite economic plans are to be integrated
 more closely during the 1956-60 five-year plan period in order
 to derive greater benefits from regional division of labor.  The
 Council of Mutual Economic Assistance is taking a more open and
 apparently more active role in planning bloc economic affairs,
 and the Yugoslav ambassador to the USSR told the American embassy
 he had heard from several sources that at the March meeting of
 the council the possibility of establishing bloc steel and oil
 pools along the lines of the Schuman plan was discussed.
 While the Satellites have fallen short of their goals so
 far,. the increased investments now taking place in the critical
 agricultural, consumer goods, and fuel and power sectors should
 permit greater opportunity for success in the future, provided
 the investments continue for a sufficient period of time.
 Speakers at the recent East German and Hungarian party congresses
 stated that the raising of agricultural and consumer goods pro-
 duction and the elimination of fuel and power shortages would
 be the primary tasks during the period 1956-60, and Czechoslovakia
 has announced an agricultural program extending through 1957
 which requires large-scale allocations of resources.
 If such long-range programs as those outlined in the
 three countries listed above are followed generally in the
 Satellites, as appears likely, the imbalance of their economies
 caused by a too rapid industrialization program should be sub-
 stantially corrected by the end of their second five-year plans
 in 1960.

 DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE TOP SOVIET LEADERSHIP.
 Developments during the past year, and especially since
 April, suggest that the principle of collective leadership at
 the summit of the Soviet hierarchy is being challenged by Party
 Secretary Khrushchev or a group associated with him.   The rapid
 growth of Khrushchev's prestige and influence suggests that,
 unless some strong opposing trend develops (the first signs of
 .which may already be appearing), he will soon become the dominant
 figure in the USSR.   While there has been no suggestion that
 Khrushchev disagrees with present Soviet policies, his public
 speeches have been somewhat harsher in tone than those of Malenkov,
 especially on foreign policy,
 The group leadership which has characterized Soviet politics
 since Stalin's death apparently arose from the lack of any over-
 whelmingly strong individual heir to the dictator's mantle and
 from fear among the leaders of the consequences of a one-man rule
 of the Stalinist type.   Realizing that supremacy for any one of
 their number would soon lead to the liquidation of the rest as
 potential rivals, the members of the ruling group presumably deter-
 mined to prevent the assumption of Stalin's power by any individ-
 ual..   The public prestige which Party Secretary Khrushchev has
 attained in recent months appears to threaten the collective leader-
 ship and Malenkov's position as first among equals within it.
 From April through mid-June Khrushchev was receiving more per-
 sonal publicity than any other Soviet leader since Stalin.  He
 has spoken authoritatively on an increasing number of aspects of
 domestic and international policy, and he has been active in all
 fields of Soviet life.   Several of his former associates have been
 elevated to high posts in the USSR, and the Ukraine, where he was
 party boss from 1938 to 1949, has been accorded prestige second
 only to that of the Great Russian republic.
 Khrushchev has shown signs of competing with rather than sup-
 porting the premier.   He has failed to give Malenkov any credit
 for the development of the new agricultural program first out-
 lined in Malenkov's August speech; he attended the Leningrad
 party plenum which, for reasons as yet unclear, fired V. M.
 Andrianov, believed to be a close associate of Malenkov; and some
 of his personal prominence has been achieved at the premier's ex-
 pense,-

 While Khrushchevts original rise after Beria's purge may
 well have been inspired by the collective's desire to create a
 counterweight to Malenkov's growing prestige, it has now ex-
 ceeded the limits which such a purpose would impose, and Khrushchev,
 not Malenkov, now appears to represent the greatest threat to the
 principle of collective rule.   It does not seem possible to ex-
 plain Khrushchev's build-up as an effort to enhance the prestige
 of the party by raising that of its first secretary.  For one
 thing, this could be done equally well by stressing the role of
 a group of party leaders, and other strictly party figures have
 not received similar treatment.  For another thing.,,many of. the.
 tributes to Khrushchev have been of a personal character.   Thus
 Khrushchev's growing prominence appears to be part of a personal
 quest for power by him or his supporters.
 A clue to the present relation of forces within the top leader-
 ship may be contained in the adoption in June of an alphabetical
 listing of the party presidium, which deprived Malenkov of one of
 his few remaining attributes of pre-eminence within that group.
 The shift may merely reflect an inability to.agree.on any precedence
 of listing, but it would suggest that Malenkov no longer holds a
 clear position as first among equals within the Soviet hierarchy.
 It has been argued that the alphabetical listing is designed to re-
 assert the strictest,principles of collectivity, thus dealing a
 blow at Khrushchev, the prime violator of this principle.  However,
 the move has not been accompanied by the propaganda fanfare about
 collectivity one would expect if this were its motivation.
 There have been suggestions in the past several weeks that
 Malenkov or the top leaders as a group may be moving against
 Khrushchev.  Despite his public leadership of the new agricultural
 program and contrary to previous practice, Khrushchev apparently
 did not give the keynote address at the late June central committee
 plenum on agriculture and he was not publicly identified with its
 decree on the subject..  The publicity accorded Malenkov has slightly
 increased, and Voroshilov strongly affirmed the principles of
 collectivity in his speech to the Hungarian party congress.
 In spite of these presumed maneuverings within the top
 Soviet hierarchy, no conclusive signs of fundamental policy con-
 flicts within the Kremlin have appeared.  Ambassador Bohlen has
 noted that Khrushchev seems to take a less realistic attitude to-
 ward domestic problems and ,a less calm and sober view of the inter-
 national situation than does Malenkov.   This may prove to be a
 cause of concern for the West if he succeeds in gaining the lead-
 ing position within the USSR.

 THE NEW STATURE OF MAO TSE-TUNG*
 Mao Tse-tung has apparently succeeded in obtaining from
 Stalin's heirs a role in the determination of developments in
 the Far East commensurate with his position as the most eminent
 living Communist leader and Asian revolutionary theorist.
 The Chinese Communists have been referring to "the Mao
 Tse-tung ideology" for at least the past ten years, and since
 1950 have worked particularly hard to present him as a major
 Marxist theorist.  By 1953 the Chinese were waging a real if
 subtle-battle with the Russians to gain recognition of the worth
 of Mao's doctrines and Peiping's freedom to proclaim them.
 The Chinese have claimed that Mao has made important con-
 tributions to Marxist-Leninist materialist dialectics and to the
 Lenin-Stalin theory on colonial revolutions, that he developed
 a "complete theory of new democracy" from Stalin's instructions,
 and that he built up a "complete theoretical system about the
 peasants' revolutionary war" from Stalin's viewpoint on armed
 struggle.
 These claims are in part true.   At any rate, since Stalin's
 death Soviet reviews of Mao's written works have described them
 as an "enrichment" of, or as a major "contribution" to, Marxist
 theory.   Until that time, such terms had been reserved exclu-
 sively for Lenin's and Stalin's achievements, and their use in
 references to Mao has in effect elevated him to a position of
 an author of world Communist doctrine.
 A related question has been that of the applicability of
 "Mao's road" to other colonial and semicolonial revolutions in
 Asia.   The Chinese claim to be a model for Asian revolutions
 dates from 1949, at which time Mao's tactics were recommended
 to all Asian "liberation" movements.
 The Russians failed to espouse this Chinese line, and in
 November 1951 a conference of Russian theorists in Moscow con-
 cluded it would be "risky" to regard the Chinese revolution as
 "some kind of stereotype" for the Far East.   Chinese abandonment
 of this line in late 1951 was probably in part the result of
 agreement with Moscow on a shift in tactics among Far Eastern
 Communist movements in that year, deriving from frustration of
 the Communist military program in Korea and elsewhere.   It also

 seemed to represent an open acquiescence by Peiping in Moscow's
 claim to be the policymaking as well as spiritual center for the
 Asian revolutions.
 The Chinese did not, however, abandon their belief in the
 eventual applicability of their program to much of Asia.   In both
 1952 and 1953 Chinese official works asserted that "all, or at
 least some, of the colonial peoples in the Far East can maintain
 for an extended period large or small base areas and revolution-
 ary regimes, carry on a revolutionary war to encircle the cities
 from the countryside, and proceed gradually to take over the
 cities and win nationwide victory...."
 By allowing their propagandists to acknowledge Mao's revo-
 lutionary concepts as a contribution to the theory of national-
 colonial revolutions, the post-Stalin Russian leaders have taken
 a major step toward reviving Peiping's claims of being a model.
 The Cominform journal took another step in January 1954 by
 observing that Mao had "creatively, and in a new way,"
 characterized the Chinese revolution as one of "a special type,
 now typical for the revolution in colonial and semicolonial
 countries."
 Moscow's deferential treatment of Mao's works appears to
 represent an indirect admission that Peiping has obtained a
 greater voice, if not a voice equal to Moscow's, in formulating
 strategy and tactics for Communist movements in Southeast Asia.
 It also seems to acknowledge Peiping as a second,  if lesser,
 spiritual center for such movements.
 An apparent illustration of this development was the
 Viet Minh's Sino-Soviet-Vietnam Friendship Month in January 1954,
 during which the Viet Minh gave extraordinary credit to Mao for
 Ho Chi.Minh's successes.   Whereas the Cominform journal four
 months earlier had deleted all references to Chinese guidance
 from a Viet Minh official's article, the journal in January 1954
 publicized the Viet Minh's debt to China.
 Moscow may have been reluctant to relinquish any of its
 authority over Communist movements in the Far East.   The shar-
 ing of authority necessarily involves the possibility that the
 USSR and China will disagree on the means for achieving their
 common aims in the region, or the timetable for their program,
 or its effects on the national interests of each.
 On the other hand, Peiping must surely seem to Moscow a
 trustworthy partner, and Moscow may well feel that the sharing
 of authority in Southeast Asia is a cheap price to pay for the
 Chinese contribution to the achievement of Soviet aims there.
 There seems little reason to expect that Moscow and Peiping will
 help out the West by quarreling seriously with each other.

 SPECIAL ARTICLE
 CURRENT WESTERN EUROPEAN ATTITUDES TOWARD AMERICAN
 POLICIES AND THE COLD WAR
 Since the Berlin conference, the governments of Western
 Europe have taken positions increasingly in disagreement with
 those of the United States.  Popular criticism of American
 inflexibility and impetuosity, which was formerly restricted
 largely to Communists and other political minorities, has also
 increased and is now widespread in all segments of public
 opinion.
 This trend, apparent among members of the Western alliance
 as well as in formally neutral nations, is particularly strong
 in those countries which are the most important allies of the
 United States.  With most countries it is partly a simple re-
 flection of greater economic strength and lessened dependence
 on American aid.   Primarily, however, it stems from a reassess-
 ment of the Soviet threat and the belief that Washington has
 failed to adjust its policies to meet the diplomatic needs of
 a period of reduced tension which may continue indefinitely.
 Indochina
 The British and French approach to the Geneva conference
 has been widely praised in Europe as compatible with a general
 desire to test Communist intentions through negotiations.
 Although the USSR's unwillingness to make concessions at the
 Berlin meeting dampened optimism for a solution to European
 problems, the prospects for further meetings with Communist
 leaders on other international problems sustained the hope for
 some kind of negotiated peace.  Regardless of the final results
 of the Geneva meeting, proposals for further conferences will
 almost certainly not be rejected out of hand.
 British and other European leaders regarded American
 appeals for "united action" and "intervention" on the eve of
 the Geneva conference as not conducive to an atmosphere of
 genuine negotiation.  The mid-April "misunderstanding" over
 the timing of a Southeast Asian defense system has been generally
 blamed on Washington, and Secretary Dulles was widely criticized
 for the brevity of his sojourn at Geneva.

 By contrast, Foreign Secretary Eden was widely praised
 for his exhaustive efforts to promote a peaceful settlement
 of the Indochina war.  His continuing attempts to enlist
 Southeast Asian nations in a defensive alliance have won him
 especial acclaim in Britain.   The American embassy in London
 comments on Eden's 23 June statement about Geneva in the House
 of Commons that for the first time since the war, a British
 foreign secretary has won the commendation of all wings of
 all political parties.
 The French feel firmly that they must end the Indochinese
 drain on their resources, and are strongly in favor of Premier
 Mendes-France's policy of seeking an immediate end to the Indo-
 china fighting.   Like the British and the vast majority of
 other Europeans who attach priority to the defense of Western
 Europe, they want to avoid a recurrence of hostilities which
 might involve them in Southeast Asia again.  The French tend
 to blame Washington for failure to support their desire for a
 negotiated peace, particularly in view of the United States'
 willingness to end the Korean fighting in a stalemate.
 In their present weakened condition at home and abroad,
 the French are reluctant to undertake further commitments on
 the continent.  They are increasingly disposed to think that
 France must have time to rebuild its strength in Europe before
 West Germany is allowed to rearm.  Mendes-France, unlike Laniel,
 has committed himself only to give the National Assembly the
 chance to decide on the EDC issue, and not to win approval of
 the present EDC treaty.
 European Defense
 Most members of the North Atlantic alliance are increasingly
 disposed to regard the present rearmament plateau as a maximum
 military effort within the long-haul concept of NATO strategy.
 British chancellor of the exchequer Butler's budget speech in
 April, in which he stated that relief from defense burdens
 "must" be found this.year, is an accurate reflection of the
 attitude of almost all NATO members.-
 Although present commitments are being generally met, there
 is little sense of urgency.   Popular enthusiasm for NATO ties
 has waned considerably in such countries as Denmark and Iceland.
 There have already been some readjustments which tend to slacken
 the general military effort, such as the Belgian reduction in
 stages of the period of military service from 24 to 18 months.

 Guatemala
 The sharpest reaction against the United States since
 the widespread disapproval of the hydrogen bomb tests in March
 has been aroused by Washington's handling of the Guatemalan
 situation.   Seldom has any action been so universally condemned
 as the American request to search European ships on the high
 seas to prevent arms from reaching the Arbenz regime, which
 many Europeans regarded as non-Communist.  The United States
 has, moreover, been adjudged maladroit generally on the Guate-
 malan issue and guilty of poor tactics in the United Nations.
 The American embassy in London reports that the American ver-
 sion of the whole affair is not accepted at its face value.
 East-West Trade
 Within the economic area of cold war tactics, the British
 have not diminished their efforts to secure a drastic reduction
 in the number and scope of Western export controls.  The presi-
 dent of the British Board of Trade wrote FOA director Stassen
 on 25 June that parliament and public opinion in his country
 would understand no policy on trade with the Orbit except one
 governed by commercial and peacetime criteria.  The Danes con-
 tinue to block any COCOM agreement on controlling the sales of
 nonembargoed merchant shipping to the Soviet Orbit.
 All the  Scandinavian countries have concluded agreements
 calling for large increases in trade with the Soviet Union and
 its Satellites during 1954.  Recognition of the fact that the
 Orbit has little to export has not deterred European business-
 men--particularly the British--from seeking actively to expand
 trade with Communist countries.
 Communist China
 As a part of their general approach designed to reduce
 East-West tensions, the British have sought closer diplomatic
 and commercial relations with Peiping.  Their decisions to
 receive a Communist Chinese charge d'affaires and an official
 trade mission in London and to expand trade With China in
 nonstrategic goods were undertaken with the prior acknowledg-
 ment that there would be unfavorable American repercussions,
 as was also the acceptance by top Labor Party leaders of an
 invitation to visit Peiping this summer.

 These actions have, however, won approbation in most
 European countries, which tend to follow the British rather
 than the American lead on this question.  The American embassy
 in Paris has the impression that France may soon recognize
 Peiping, and the British embassy in Oslo reports that the
 Chinese Communists have put out feelers about establishing
 diplomatic relations with Norway.
 East-West tensions
 Ever since the death of Stalin, Europeans have believed
 that there has been a genuine detente in East-West tensions.
 The hope that this detente may evolve into an indefinitely
 prolonged period of reduced tension has largely replaced the
 fear of Soviet aggression.
 The desire to promote stability in the East-West con-
 flict by trying to negotiate diplomatically and to increase
 commercial and cultural contacts with the Communist nations
 is contrasted by Europeans with what they regard as the
 American compulsion to oppose Communism actively, to threaten
 both allies and adversaries, and to pursue the cold war by
 all means short of outright military action.
 One of the major diplomatic efforts to test the possi-
 bility of replacing the cold war with an armed peace lies in
 the advocacy of Locarno-type pacts, a "master thought" first
 advanced by Winston Churchill on 11 May 1953.  This concept
 has since reportedly been received favorably by India's
 Prime Minister Nehru, and on 23 June Anthony Eden suggested
 that it might be appropriate for Southeast Asia as well as
 for Europe.
 Reactions to American-British differences
 The divisive effects of an Anglo-American split on the
 Western alliance--for which the United States as the acknowl-
 edged leader bears the brunt of criticism--have not gone
 unnoticed.   The general press reaction to the Churchill-
 Eisenhower talks has been one of hope that the alliance is
 strong and fear that the fundamental differences may be un-
 resolved.   French general Ely told Ambassador Dillon on
 29 June that he felt that the Western powers had lost tremen-
 dously in prestige in the last few months as compared to inter-
 national Communism, and that the obvious lack of Western unity
 has had a terribly damaging effect on negotiations with the
 Viet Minh.

 COUNDENTIAL
 Conclusion
 There is unlikely to be any lessening of European efforts
 under British leadership to encourage patience and moderation
 in Washington as well as in Moscow and Peiping.   There is,
 however, no force strong enough inside or outside Western
 governments to modify the present East-West line-up.  Neutralism,
 in countries other than those which have traditionally pursued
 an alliance-free policy, remains only a dream.   It enjoys wide
 popular support, but is usually linked to some immediate
 national objective rather than to active promotion of any
 "third force" bloc.   In West Germany, for example, neutrality
 appears to be the price which some elements would pay in return
 for Soviet concessions leading toward reunification of Germany.
 Far from reconsidering their adherence to the alliance,
 NATO members are apprehensive that the end of American
 economic aid will be followed by a political and military
 withdrawal from the continent in favor of a peripheral
 strategy with heavy reliance on nuclear weapons.  At the same
 time, many Europeans regard American pronouncements about
 "massive retaliation" and "rolling back" Communism as danger-
 ously inconsistent with American military cutbacks.
