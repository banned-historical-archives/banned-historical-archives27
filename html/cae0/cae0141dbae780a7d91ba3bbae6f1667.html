 Political, sociological, and economic data, including monetary conversion
 rates, generally reflect information through mid-October 1971, except for population
 estimates, which have been projected to 1 January 1972. Military manpower estimates
 are as of 1 January 1972 except for average number of males reaching military age,
 which are projected averages for the 5-year period 1971-75. Military and communications
 data are as of 1 October 1971 unless otherwise indicated.
 Most of the land utilization estimates are rough approximations, and most of
 the statistical data are rounded (thousands and millions). Figures for "arable" may
 reflect only the area actually under crops rather than the potential cultivable.
 Fishing limits are included only when they differ from the territorial limits.
 For some countries GDP, rather than GNP, is shown. The difference between the
 two is in the addition or subtraction of the value of return on foreign investment.
 GDP equals GNP plus income earned in the country but sent abroad, minus income earned
 abroad but sent into the country. GDP thus tends to exceed GNP in debtor countries,
 and the reverse is true in creditor countries.
 Major ports are the largest maritime ports of the country, relative to other
 ports of the same country, on the basis of estimated port capacity, alongside berthing
 accommodations, and commercial or naval importance. Minor ports are the remaining
 ports of a country which have, relative to the major ports, significantly lower
 estimated port capacity, fewer alongside berthing accommodations, are of less
 commercial or naval importance. Major transport aircraft are those weighing over 20,000
 pounds. Military budgets are in U.S. dollar equivalents. The dollar sign refers to
 U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. The abbreviation FY stands for fiscal year; all
 years are calendar years unless otherwise indicated.

 Economic activity in Gibraltar centers on commerce and large British naval and

 port serves also as important supply depot for fuel, water, and ships' wares.
 Recently built dockyards and machine shops provide maintenance and repair
 services to 3,500-4,000 vessels that call at Gibraltar each year.
 U.K. military establishments and civil government employ nearly half the insured
 labor force. Local industry is confined to manufacture of tobacco, roasted
 coffee, ice, mineral waters, candy, and\canned fish. Some factories for
 manufacture of clothing are being developed. A small segment of local
 population makes its livelihood by fishing. In recent years tourism has
 increased in importance.

 continuing to cross from West to East Jordan. These and
