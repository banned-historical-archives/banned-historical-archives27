China (Fri Brief) 1200, 20 Nov 80 
Deng Xiaoping retains the political initiative in Beijing, where he is 
attempting to nail down a sertes of reforms designed to ensure orderly decision-
making, provide for an orderly succession, and concentrate Chinese energies on-
modernizing the economy. 
Deng has won most of his battles so far, but the going has been tough 
and the costs have been high. His base of support is probably narrower than 
it was a year or two ago, particularly in the military and in segments of the 
economic bureaucracy. Deng's personality is still the glue that holds things 
together in Beijing, but he is 76 and won't live forever. Lots of loose ends 
regarding the succession remain to be tied up. 
Deng and his allies, by emphasizing pragmatism, have got to produce 
results--visible'economic growth and diplomatic successes. Neither is guaranteed. 
Critics remain waiting in the wings to capitalize on any faltering in the new 
programs (including the opening to the US). 
Economic performance obviously is a key in all this, but the Chinese 
are still groping to discover the best approach to their many problems. 
Economic growth this year may fall well below the long-run trend of five to 
six percent. Reforms are still being resisted and have caused initial confusion 
in many cases. 
Ambitious plans have been sharply scaled back, particularly in the area 
of capital construction. Beijing is now concentrating on difficult infrastruc-
tion problems, especially energy. This is rational and should produce good 
long-term results, but precludes splashy short-term results which could be 
politically useful. 
Foreign trade remains a bright spot. 
China remains militarily much inferior to the USSR. There is no short-
term solution to this problem, and foreign arms and technology purchases can 
only affect the margins of the basic problem. 
Military modernization remains a goal, but has a lesser priority than 
agricultural growth and than modernization of the economic infrastructure. 
Elements of the military are grumbling about this order of things, but basic 
priorities are not likely to change soon. 
In consequence, China must rely on clever diplomatic maneuvering (plus 
the prospect of prolonged, low-level resistance if the Soviets attack) to 
ward off the threat from Moscow.

LIBERIA 
The military coup in Liberia in April 1980 led by Sgt. Doe and a group 
of enlisted men toppled a political system that had survived for 133 years 
and reversed the domination of the Americo-Liberian elite over the indigenous 
population. After seven months in power, the ruling military is having 
difficulty dealing with urgent problems--most of them economic--or 
establishing policy direction for the future. 
The coup has made more precarious the historical US-Liberian "special 
relationship,"-'under which the US has enjoyed unqualified diplomatic support 
on international issues, access to Liberia's port and airfield, and the right 
to build and maintain important US communications facilities in the country. 
These include a Voice of America transmitter, a regional telecommunications 
center and a Coast Guard navigation center. Although US personnel and 
facilities have not been threatened, the possibility exists that the pro-US 
sentiment that has prevailed so far could erode if the country's current 
fragile political and economic system breaks down. 
Monrovia's most pressing economic problems are the recurrent payments 
crises generated by monthly government payrolls or large foreign payments. 
Currency flight and hoarding subsequent to the coup and the general unwilling-
ness of international banks to sharply increase exposure in Liberia have 
created a serious credit crunch. Uncontrolled spending by the military 
government and reduced tax revenues have led to $6-8 million monthly deficits 
and resulted in the loss--at least temporarily--of access to $70 million 
remaining under an IMF standby agreement. Business uncertainty arising from 
perceived political instability has been exacerbated by official harassment 
of expatriate firms and excessive worker demands. Major firms are already 
considering cut backs in operations and are delaying new investment plans. 
US economic and military aid has been useful in demonstrating our interest in 
the new regime, preventing food shortages, and providing badly needed support 
for head-of-state Doe, but has not been large enough to materially reduce 
Liberia's problems. 
Even though the leaders have stated that they will pursue a more non-
aligned foreign policy, they have looked first to the US to provide large 
amounts of economic and military aid, and have sometimes been critical of 
what they regard as a meager US response. 
Radical African governments such as Ethiopia and Libya have sought to 
ingratiate themselves with the new regime. The Soviets and Cubans have 
stepped up their contacts with Liberian officials, hoping to gain a foothold 
in the country. The Soviets reportedly have offered some military aid, but 
no agreements have been concluded. The Liberians have, so far, been cautious 
in their dealings with these countries, and any closer association may continue 
to be tempered by an anti-Communist sentiment among the general population. 
But Soviet or Ethiopian offers of military equipment or training could prove 
hard for the military leaders to resist, especially if US aid does not meet 
their expectations.

Soviet Strategic Programs (Fri Brief) 
ConiOlex - long term issue: 
How judge current balance 
How likely to trend in '80s 
Soviets are basically pleased with recognition of their achievement of 
parity or perhaps even superiority with the US in strategic weaponry. 
The issue which more than any other dominates perceptions of 
strategic balance in this country--and abroad--this is the 
vulnerability of US ICBMs to a first strike by the Soviets. At 
present, our calculations show only 30% of US ICBM force would 
survive such an attack this downward trend as increasingly accurate 
Soviet ICBMs come on line. By 1985 only about 10% of the US ICBM 
force would survive a first strike attack. 
ICBMs are not the full force of either side, however. We next can 
measure what the total US surviving capability would be if the 
Soviets attacked us first; and compare it with what the Soviets would 
have remaining after such an attack. 
The calculations show that the Soviets would exceed us in the total 
of residual destructive power until about 1988. Nevertheless, US 
ability to retaliate after absorbing a first strike would still be 
considerable. The remaining US forces would be capable of taking out 
the bulk of the Soviet urban area, the economic base, and their non-
silo military targets. After 1988 there is not only a sharp 
reversal, but the absolute Soviet residual force would have a very 
limited capability even against US urban areas. This is due to our 
build up of CMs & MX. 
What are the Soviets likely to do about this projected sharp reversal 
in position in the late 1980s? 
The Soviets will see MX as acting as a sponge to soak up thousands of 
their warheads. They could counter by building more (their throw-
weight helps here). We could counter-counter by building more MX 
shelters. If the race is unconstrained by SALT limits and starts 
soon, it would be difficult for the US to "win." 
If SALT limits prevail through 1990, an expansion of about 50% in MX 
shelters would "win." In between the result is mixed. I believe the 
Soviets will want to avoid this kind of hypothetical race. They 
would prefer to keep perceptions where they are today; they have a 
generous respect for our technological and industrial capacity 
(remembering how rapidly we built up our ICBM force in response to 
the "missile gap" of 1960); and they do not want to strain their

struggling economy if they can avoid it. Still, they will not 
hesitate to strain themselves if they perceive the late '80s as we 
do. Much will depend on whether they believe that we will be 
resolute in following through on the cruise missile and MX and TNF 
programs. 
The deployment of cruise missiles and MX also threatens to affect the 
survivability of the Soviet ICBMs by the late 1980s, as shown on 
Chart 10. To improve their force survivability they could deploy 
larger numbers of SLBMs or deploy mobile ICBMs, or deploy long-range 
cruise missiles. They could also try defending their ICBMs by a 
widespread ABM system. 
Mobile systems, particularly cruise missiles and ICBMs, will make 
verification of future SALT agreements even more difficult. 
In light of stark contrast in projected Soviet strategic position in the 
first half of the 1980s and the threat to it in the last half, we must 
ask whether the Soviets will attempt to take advantage of what some have 
referred to as the "window of opportunity" of the early to mid-1980s. 
Because even before they achieved parity the Soviets have regularly 
exploited opportunities in the Third World and have taken necessary 
measures to secure Eastern Europe, I don't believe their new 
strategic power position will embolden them much more. It may well, 
however, make their task easier as other nations perceive them to be 
in the military ascendency and they will encourage that attitude. 
Now, as a generation ago, Soviets will move to exploit opportunities 
when they believe the risk of US counteraction to be low. 
Thus, even in the early to mid-1980s, we expect the Soviets to probe 
and challenge the US in various situations to determine at what point 
the US is likely to react strongly. We do not, however, believe they 
will "go for broke" in the next few years.

NATO always tried use quality make up for quantity. 
Soviets have conducted steady modernization and are eliminating much of 
quality advantage we've had. 
Their advantage in #'s remains; even grows on mobilization. 
Margin of advantage these conditions provide not wide enough to make 
starting war an attractive propostion. 
Especially in view risk of escalation to at least tactical nuclear 
warfare, the uncertain reliability of East Europe, the threat of the 
Chinese on their other flank and the traditionally conservative 
Soviet military doctrine of massive force. 
But is wide enough that coupled with strategic perception that NATO 
allies not thinking in terms of trying to match militarily.

TALKING POINTS 
NATO-Warsaw Pact Balance  
1. INTRODUCTION 
Briefing will provide comparison of NATO-Warsaw Pact forces 
In Europe emphasizing: 
o Soviet perception of balance (based on excellent, 
but sensitive information); 
41 Modernization trends; 
o Nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities. 
Traditionally, NATO has counted on quality to counter Warsaw Pact 
quantity advantage. 
so Quality gap narrowing; Soviet modernization impressive; 
o Quantity margin adequate to give Soviets confidence that 
NATO allies will not try to match the Pact; 
o Margin not wide enough to make war attractive. 
2. SOVIET POSTURE OPPOSITE NATO 
Soviet ground, naval, and air forces designed to protect longest 
land border of any nation. 
o Emphasis on Europe; 55% of ground forces opposite NATO, 
but cannot forget China or Southern region (Afghanistan, 
? Iran); 
o Ground forces designed for fast, deep armor-heavy offensive; 
? nuclear or non-nuclear; 
41 Air forces organized for air defense of homeland and

Map of Center 
Region ? Have capacity to conduct combined ground-air offensive 
campaign; 
? Key issue is readiness and warning time. 
? - Soviet forces not fully ready for war on daily basis; 
- Forces in forward area--highest state of readiness; 
others low readiness; 
- 30% of divisions opposite NATO are Category III 
? (10-30% personnel manning, lack support equipment; 
? 72 hours to mobilize; need training); 
- Naval forces: half available in five days; 
three-fourths available in 25 days. 
? Expect a period of tension before war; time to mobilize, 
prepare nation; 
? US can detect mobilization within a day or two; 
? Soviets would prefer to mobilize and attack with clear 
preponderance of force (five fronts); could attack with 
less (two or three fronts). 
3. COMPARISONS OF NATO AND WARSAW PACT FORCES 
In terms of sheer numbers, the Soviet advantages are clear:. 
? Superiority in tanks--1.9:1 at fl-Day; 2.5:1 after 
mobilization;

o Slight advantage in manpower; 
is Significant advantage in divisions (2 to 1 after 
mobilization); 
o NATO advantage in aircraft; 20% after mobilization. 
Chart 4 Soviet perception of balance based on more than mere numbers; 
Soviet perception 
of buildup planning is based on correlation of forces; includes both quantitative 
and qualitative factors; takes into account modernization, training, 
quality of national forces (excellent evidence: detailed in writing, 
practiced in exercises). 
Soviet perception of correlation of forces (force balance) is 
more conservative than numbers indicate: 
e Rate ground forces as roughly equal at M-Day; gain 
1.8:1 advantage after mobilization; 
? Rate NATO combat aircraft superior both before and 
after mobilization--clear NATO advantage exceeding 
actual inventory comparison. 
Transition: following charts show Soviets view of modernization, 
conservative.

Tank moderniza-
tion tank production and quality.

(2,000); 
sr Rated NATO and WP tanks equal in '60s;

4. CONCLUSIONS 
Probable Soviet view of comparative strengths. 
Chart represents best estimate about how Soviets assess basic 
conventional/tac nuc military balance. 
Soviets are confident that they have the edge in the areas 
showns, but they know that they face: 
41 Superior NATO airpower and seapower; 
? Flexible command and control system; 
? Superior industrial and manpower reserves; 
4, Forces with the advantage of the defender; 
? A cohesive alliance. 
What does this mean? 
? Soviets strongest suit: confidence in their armed forces; 
? Respectful of US technology base; 
411 Conservative in thinking (tend to overrate West) about 
size of force structure;

SOVIET STRATEGIC PROGRAMS 
I. The Current Situation 
A. Soviets are basically pleased with recognition of their 
achievement of parity or perhaps even superiority with the US in 
strategic weaponry. 
1. Through the possession of a large defense establishment 
which includes centralized direction and control of forces and a 
massive, well disciplined R&D organization, the willingness to 
give defense program a high priority in allocation of resources, 
the Soviets have been able to at least match and in some areas 
surpass the US in many of the commonly used measures of strategic 
force comparisons. 
2. The only significant remaining US advantage is in numbers 
of warheads. Soviets lead in number of delivery vehicles, and 
equivalent megatonage, and have surpassed US accuracy capability in 
the latest version of their SS-18 and SS-19 ICBMs. 
B. Critical issue dominating perceptions in this country is 
vulnerability of US ICBMs to first strike by the Soviets. 
1. At present, calculation shows only 30% of US ICBM 
force would survive such an attack, (some 55% of Soviet silo-based 
ICBMs would survive.) (See Chart 1) 
II. Prospects for the early 1980s 
1. For the US, the vulnerability of its ICBMs will 
continue this downward trend the next few years, as increasingly 
accurate Soviet ICBMs come on line. (See Chart 2) 
2. Moreover, because of the tremendous mementum of 
Soviet programs, not merly in offensive systems, but for 
defensive systems and command and control as well, the Soviets 
will have a number of options for making further progress in 
the next decade.

a. Five to seven ICBM programs (some may be mobile), 
a new class, large SSBN (displacement one and one-half times 
the Trident class), and possibly air-launched and submarine-
launched cruise missiles. 
b. In the defensive area they are continuing an active 
ABM R&D program, trying to add an effective low-alititude 
capability to their already massive air defense system, 
working on the very difficult ASW problem, and spending 
the equivalent of over two billion dollars per year on 
civil defense. They are also striving to achieve technological 
breakthrough in laser and directed energy weapons in the 
fields of air defense, anti-satellite systems, and missile 
defense. 
25X1 
c. In command and control, Soviets continue process of 
enhancing flexibility of control and integration of all echelons. 
They are also enhancing survivability and improving early warning 
capabilities. 
III. Prospects for the late 1980s 
A. Despite the favorable trends for the Soviets in the early 1980s, 
the Soviets could be apprehensive about how long their hard won gains 
would last. 
1. Soviets believe they face aroused US public opinion 
which is willing to spend more on defense, they fear US technology 
and industry. 
2. They are also concerned about the nuclear threat from 
China, U.K., and France. They are particularly concerned about the 
NATO decision to deploy long range theater nuclear forces, which 
would be capable of striking Soviet territory. 
3. The Soviet economic prospects for the 1980s look in-
creasingly glum as they face decreasing productivity, which will 
cause further stringencies in funding defense programs. 
4. Even before the election they were concerned with US 
strategic programs. 
a. Cruise missile and Trident programs will further 
compound problems of defense. 
b. They are particularly concerned about the MX. 
5. The effect of the MX could be two-fold.

-3-
a. On the one hand, MX shelters would reduce the 
Soviet counterforce threat by acting as a sponge to soak up 
thousands of RVs in wasted attacks on empty shelters. For 
example, after full 4600 MX shelter deployment, the Soviets 
would have to expend most of their ICBMs in a counter-
force attack and would have few ICBMs left for attacks on 
other US military and economic targets, although the SLBM 
force could be so used. 
25X1 
b. On the other hand, the deployment of MX threatenILLEGIB 
to affect the survivability of their own ICBMs by the late 
80s, as shown on Chart 3. ILLEGIB 
B. Possible Soviet Responses. 
1. In projecting what decisions the Soviets might make, we 
assume they will want to preserve and extend their gains, if pos-
sible. They probably assume that with or without SALT, US programs 
such as cruise misisles, Trident, and MX will come to fruition. 
a. Under SALT, to maintain their counterforce capability 
the Soviets would have options to deploy their one new ICBM 
allowed with 10 RVs--to maximize the warheads available to 
attack MX shelters. Without SALT, the Soviets could also in-
crease the number of RVs on their currently deployed heavy 
ICBMs. 
b. To improve their force survivability they could, 
under SALT, deploy larger numbers of SLBMs or deploy mobile 
ICBMs, or both, but only at the expense of reducing fixed 
ICBMs. They could also deploy long-range cruise missiles. 
Without SALT, they would be free to build mobile systems of 
any type. They could also try defending their ICBMs by 
a widespread ABM system. 
C. By the end of decade, the survivability of fixed ICBMs will 
become a problem for both sides, because further improvements in ICBM 
accuracies will make even the hardest silos vulnerable. This will 
increasingly create pressures to go towards mobile systems. We al-
ready have evidence the Soviets are developing at least one mobile 
ICBM. A trend towards mobile systems, particularly cruise missiles and 
ICBMs, will make verification of future SALT agreements even more dif-
ficult.

- Oil is entering A no growth stage. 
25X1 
Because the Soviets have pursued an all-out 
drilling program in west Siberia, oil production 
may be maintained in the next year or two at about 
the current level. 
This strategy, however, cannot he kept up for more 
than a year or two because depletion of easily  
accessible "high flow" reserves would force 
Production down. 
- Coal production and nuclear power program are also 
lagging badly.

- Most will consist of relatively less-skilled and less

C. Productivity is also slowing because of 
- rising raw material costs, 
- greater distances to transport resources, and 
- lack of incentives.

III. Policy Implications - This will force the Soviets to makr, 
some exceedingly tough policy decisions. 
A. In a nutshell, their problem is that increments to 
national output in 19R0s will be too small to normit 
simultaneous achievement of:

- continued increases Hn defense spending at 4-5% per 
year, 
- more investment to problem areas such as agriculture, 
energy, and transportation, 
- support to Eastern Europe, and 
- continued modest increases in consumer welfare. 
B. Simply stated, something will have to give. 
IV. Near-Term Policy nirection - While publication of the 19R1-85 
plan is still 2 months away, its basic direction is clear. 
A. nefense continues to receive top priority. 
- We have no indication of a cut-back in any major 
defense programs. Floor space for the production of 
major weapons systems continues to grow rapidly. 
- Military related urn programs are at all-time high. 
- While costly to economy, the USSR for political and 
military reasons continues to provide extensive foreign 
aid to non-communist UnCs. In 1q79 Soviet military 
sales to non-communist LnCs totaled SRA billion and 
new economic aid committments stood at 0.6 billion. 
- Leadership speeches indicate they view the 
international situation as the worst in 15 years and 
anticipate Ahey will have to deal with a substantial 
buildup in NATO forces. 
B. Because we believe Soviet defense effort will retain its 
Priority in near term, the bind on investment will become 
increasingly tight. 
C. Moscow will pay, increased lio-service to consumer needs, 
hut no major reallocation of resources toward consumers 
is in the offing. 
V. Soviet Economic Relations with Eastern Europe and the West - 
Because of their domestic economic problems, we have no 
indications that Moscow intends to change its economic 
dealing with Eastern Europe or the 'est. 
A. For years Soviets have been trying to reduce tIle rnst of 
maintaining their hegemony over Eastern Europe hv 
reducing their trade subsidies. 
- In light of events in Poland. however, mosce.,v seems 
intent on providing increased economic aid--lt least i 
short-term--to tide them over. 
- A strong hard currency Position allows them in dn qn. 
B. Moscow also needs, more than ever, access to  Western 
technology and equipment. 
The best example is USSR-western Europe gas Honl,

Largest deal ever wi fh West (10 billion in potential 
equipment sales). 
- The Soviets continue to seek equipment and technology, 
and want to renew the US-USSR long-term grain 
agreement. 
Chances are that in the next few years, Moscow will 
be unable to acquire more than two-thirds of their 
grain import needs from non-US sources. 
The Soviets also have indicated they prefer 
sophisticated ITS technology and equipment where 
possible. They continue to seek, for example, ITS 
compressors for their gas oinelines rather than 
somewhat less advancedones from Western Europe. 
C. Nevertheless, as shown by Afghanistan, Soviets are quite 
willing to sacrifice any benefits from US trade for what 
they perceive as overriding political or military goals. 
- Indeed, Soviets remain sanguine that they can elicit 
trade agreements from Western Europe even in the face 
of US opposition. 
VI. Future Alternatives - Over the next few years, Moscow 
probably will be unwilling to undertake any major 
reallocation of resources, or risk changing the current 
system of centralized control. 
A. The current leadership seems to be marking time. It 
prefers tinkering.at the margins ; alternatives are too 
risky. 
R. nuring the early 190s, however, a change in leadership 
is likely. 
- Brezhnev is in poor health. 
- Most of those who hold key positons are in their 70s. 
C. Even a new leadership would be hard pressed in the short 
run to make changes. 
- They would need time to consolidate Power. 
- They might reason that by 1990s major difficulties 
pass 
D. We do not think the strategy of "marking time" is tenahle 
in long run; Soviet economic problems are too severe. 
E. As the problems become more acute. Soviet leaders could 
impose more austerity on the economy to support military 
spending. 
- Consumption would suffer greatly. 
- To garner public support, Moscow would likely oyoke an

- This policy could also probably mean less reliance on 
economic relations with West and less tolerance toward 
EE. 
F. Alternatively, a younger set of leaders, less committed 
to the status quo, might view a change in resource 
allocation policy in favor of consumers as a more viable 
way of maintaining "suner power" status.  
- Even so, a major shift in priorities away from defense 
would require the convergence of: 
-- economic problems at home severe enough to raise 
questions concerning internal political stability. 
-- an international environment that does not press 
the Soviets (e.g., resurgence of detente). 
-- a stable Eastern Europe.
