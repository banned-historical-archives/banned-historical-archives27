 ITALY: Programmatic Majority
 I          _7        Now that Italian Prime Minister - designate
 An reotti  has won permission from his Christian Democrats to
 include the Communist Party in a new government's parliamentary
 majority, he is focusing on programmatic differences among
 the major parties. Although the parties have been sharply at
 odds on several issues, Andreotti is likely to find this phase
 of his talks less troublesome than the protracted negotiations
 over the Communists' political rote.
 Ithe,Communists evidently were satisfied with the Christian
 Democratic directorate's invitation last week to join in a
 "programmatic-parliamentary majority." The Christian Democrats
 may use this formulation to continue asserting that the Com-
 munists are only part of a "program majority" as opposed to a
 "political" one, but for all practical purposes the Communists
 appear to have attained the goal they had in mind when they
 brought down the government early this year.

 I             In the meantime, Andreotti's meeting of party leaders
 over the weekend to discuss future government policy drew posi-
 tive comments from most of the participants. According to a
 Social Democratic official, a compromise may even be near on
 police unionization, one of the most controversial issues facing
 Andreotti. The Christian Democrats are open to the idea of a
 unionized police force but have strongly resisted proposals
 from the left to organize the police under the existing labor
 federation, in which the Communists are the most influential
 party.
 I     I Although the Republican Party has some reservations
 about  n reotti's program, the Liberals are the only party he
 is courting that is unlikely to support a new government. This
 worries the Christian Democrats even though Andreotti does not
 need Liberal support to have a majority.
 25X1         I             The small, conservative Liberal Party's support has
 been slipping in recent years, and it believes Andreotti's con-
 cessions to the Communists offer it a chance to capitalize
 politically by moving into the opposition. The Liberals, in
 fact, would be the only legitimate party remaining in the oppo-
 sition, since the neo-fascists and leftwing splinter groups are
 considered politically untouchable.
 25X1         I            lAndreotti will hold a series of meetings with labor,
 business, and political leaders today and tomorrow in prepara-
 tion for nnnt-hpr           le conference of party chiefs on Wednes-
 25X1              day.

 CHINA: Government Appointments
 The government named at yesterday's closing session
 of China's National People's Congress is composed of experienced
 veteran officials committed to pursuing the country's ambitious
 economic development program. The leadership seems to have opted
 for compromise regarding potentially controversial appointments;
 it avoided choosing officials whose candidacies may have en-
 countered strong opposition from some quarters.  On balance,  the
 Congress yielded mixed results for senior Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping, Premier Hua Kuo-feng's main rival.
 Hua Kuo-feng,  for example, retained the position of
 L_              I
 Premier. Although no one before Hua had ever held both the
 premiership and the position of party chairman, it was appar-
 ently less divisive to leave him in place than to name a new
 premier. Teng Hsiao-ping had a strong claim on the premiership
 by virtue of having been chosen for the post by the late Chou
 En-lai, but he evidently angered some important officials by
 his vindictive pursuit of old adversaries.
 I          J  It seems likely, however,  that Teng and Vice Premier
 Li Hsien-nien will continue, as in the past, to share most of
 the duties of the premiership despite Hua's retention of the
 title.
 L
 The choice of Politburo member and old marshal Hsu
 Hsiang-chien as the new Defense Minister seems also to be a
 _         I
 compromise. The two leading candidates for the job were highly
 controversial. One was a strong ally of Teng Hsiao-ping and the
 other, who filled in on the job two years ago, was probably op-
 posed by Teng.
 I             Former Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying, who is nearly
 80 an, was moved up to chairman of the National People's
 Congress,     a post roughly equivalent to head of state. The job
 is prestigious but less taxing than the defense portfolio.
 Appointments to the 35 government ministries were
 notable tor the replacement in several cases of military men
 by civilians, thus continuing the effort to remove military
 men from strictly civilian functions. Most of the new govern-
 ment ministers were purged in the mid-1960s and returned in
 recent years to public life. Two of them are newly rehabili-
 tated.

 Five of the seven ministries that oversee the pro-
 duction of military-related equipment received new leaders.
 This could reflect on the standing of Politburo member and mili-
 tary man Chen Hsi-lien, who is believed to be in overall charge
 of the seven ministries. Chen, who is an opponent of Teng Hsiao-
 ping, was one of the unsuccessful candidates for Defense Minis-
 ter and dropped from third to sixth among the vice premiers.
 Other probable enemies of Teng also retained their
 posts but slipped in the standings. Peking party boss Wu Te
 went from third to fifth in rank among the vice chairmen of the
 National People's Congress. Alternate Politburo member Saifudin,
 who has been under official criticism, dropped from fifth to 14th
 on the same list. He is now outranked by several officials who
 are not on the Politburo, suggesting that he has lost his Polit-
 buro position. Party vice chairman Wang Tung-hsing, who did not
 hold a position in the government, was again excluded.
 I          I  Teng's enemies were successful in denying him the
 premiership, and he was unsuccessful in removing them from their
 government positions. He saw them slightly demoted, however, and
 was also able to get some very close associates named to such
 posts as the important public security job once held by Hua
 Kuo-feng and to the newly established academy of social sciences.
 Six new ministries, most of them restored from the
 mid-1960s, were added to the 29 that were established at the
 .last congress in 1975. The new ministries focus on such matters
 as science, economic planning, ethnic minorities, and areas such
 as textiles that are important export items.
 //DIA does not believe that there have been any
 significant compromises in the election of a new state leader-
 ship, as this article suggests. It is that agency's opinion
 that a division`of responsibilities and roles between Hua Kuo-
 feng and Teng Hsiao-ping and other key leaders was worked out
 during last year's Party plenary sessions. Moreover, it seems
 highly unlikely that Peking would have elected to hold the Fifth
 National People's Congress, without first dispensing with such
 a critical matter as the power relationship between leading
 political figures.//

 USSR: Jewish Emigration Increase
 The rate of Jewish emigration from the USSR increased
 substantially during the eight-month period ending 28 February.
 During that time, emigration was almost 35 percent above the
 comparable period a year ago. The rate may increase even more.
 In view of the unyielding, highly visible campaign
 against certain dissidents, Soviet authorities presumably do
 not expect Western government and press criticism to abate
 merely because emigration is made easier. Soviet officials,
 moreover, have not attempted to exploit the policy shift for
 propaganda advantage or used it as a counter to Western crit-
 icism of their actions.
 The shift on emigration appears to be tied more
 closely to domestic than foreign policy considerations. By im-
 proving exit opportunities for the majority of Jews while crack-
 ing down on the'more vocal dissident leadership, Soviet author-
 ities are underscoring the message that the weight of the So-
 viet system will be thrown against those who seek to publicize
 their grievances against it. Such a policy, in addition, should
 lessen the emigration pressures that have built up since 1973.

 USSR: Hard Currency Position
 I     I The record hard-currency deficit in 1975 hurt So-
 viet cre it-worthiness. For the first time, the USSR had to
 borrow heavily in the Eurodollar market--more than $4 billion--
 doubling its hard-currency debt to $10 billion. This put some
 major Western banks close to their legal or self-imposed lending
 limits to the USSR, and they started to demand higher interest
 rates from Moscow.
 The USSR began to reduce its hard currency trade
 deficit in 1976 by boosting oil exports. It achieved a further
 reduction in 1977 by holding imports steady and expanding ex-
 ports by 10 to 15 percent.  Despite large orders for Western
 grain, we estimate that Soviet hard currency grain imports fell
 from a record high of $2.6 billion in 1976 to about $2 billion.
 This drop, however, was offset by an increase in machinery and
 equipment imports.
 Average annual prices were higher for oil, diamonds, timber,
 and platinum-group metals. Hard currency earnings from other
 sources--arms sales, tourism, and transportation services--have
 also risen rapidly over the past two years.
 I     I Moscow has sharply curtailed the growth in its hard
 currency net borrowing over the past two years. By the end of
 1977, hard currency debt to the West stood at about $16 billion.
 Soviet exports in 1977 generally benefited more from
 rising world prices than from substantial increases in volume.
 //The USSR has sought to reduce its reliance on
 Western banks in an effort to counter adverse publicity on the
 size of its debt and to avoid paying what it considers unac-
 ceptable interest rates on further bank loans.  Over the past
 two years, the Soviets havee increased the use of government-
 backed credits, postpo  d some payments to suppliers,  and
 stepped up gold sales.

 The hard currency trade deficit is likely to be re-
 uce                          urther in 1978, and the hard currency current account
 could even go into the black for the first time since 1974.
 Because repayments on past loans are catching up to new draw-
 ings, the growth in debt should be further slowed this year.
 The expected decline in machinery imports should more than off-
 set any rise in grain imports. Because of a slightly improved
 economic outlook for the West, we also expect Soviet non-oil
 exports to grow this year at the same rate as in 1977.
 The volume of hard currency oil exports may decline
 after rising substantially in 1976 and remaining at a high
 level last year. A further slowing in the growth of oil produc-
 tion appears almost certain this year, and oil exports to the
 West may decline unless the Soviets are willing to pay the cost
 of further economies in domestic oil consumption. The other
 alternative, a reduction in oil exports to Eastern Europe, is
 probably seen by Moscow as less desirable.
 PORTUGAL-AZORES: Autonomy
 Portugal has instructed the regional government
 in the Azores to submit by 15 March a specific plan for eco-
 nomic decentralization and political and administrative au-
 tonomy. Most Azorean leaders believe this indicates a new in-
 terest on Lisbon's part in improving relations after months
 of bitter quarreling.  Lisbon is also planning to replace its

 unpopular chief representative in the Azores. Both moves
 should help quiet Azorean discontent and separatist ambitions
 that could prove disruptive to negotiations on a new US base
 agreement.
 1             11
 Amaral expects to have no difficulty in meeting the 15 March
 deadline. After talks with Portuguese President Eanes and other
 leaders, Amaral and his colleagues believe that the present
 Lisbon government will be more receptive than its predecessor
 to Azorean autonomy proposals and that the government will im-
 prove on the existing provisional autonomy statute.//
 In the past  Azorean ambitions have outstripped Lis-
 //Azorean Regional Government President Mota
 bon's willingness to give; relations nearly reached the break-
 ing point in 1976. Recent rounds of recrimination seemed to
 rekindle separatist fervor, which had been declining.
 //Amaral would like Lisbon, to transfer most min-
 isterial functions as they relate to the Azores to the regional
 government. He also wants to insulate the Azores from Portu-
 gal's economic problems and its austerity program. The regional
 government has already passed measures that would://
 Establish a separate foreign exchange budget.
 -- Give Azoreans authority to open domestic banking
 agencies.
 -- Allow independent interest rates in the Azores.
 Delay implementation of objectionable legislation

 the Socialist-Center Democratic national government. A combina-

 tive action in the islands should, however, win serious con-
 sideration for its views.

 some of their major dealings with the base through Lisbon. They
 are interested in the working conditions of Azoreans employed
 on the base and in obtaining control over their share of eco-
 nomic assistance received by Portugal as a result of a new
 base deal. The Azoreans could try to disrupt negotiations if
 their demands are not satisfied.//
 The recent decision to replace General Galvao de
 Figueiredo as Minister of the Republic to the Azores is viewed
 in the islands as a favorable omen. Figueiredo has been unsym-
 pathetic to Azorean interests and has become a focal point for
 local discontent. F_                         I
 NICARAGUA:   Political Change
 //The explosion of Zong pent-up discontent
 in Nicaragua, sparked by the murder in January of newspaper
 editor Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, has set the country irreversibly
 on a path to political change. Although Marxist guerrillas are
 inciting much of the violence, it has become obvious that many
 weZZ-to-do Nicaraguans also now believe that the anachronistic
 paternalism of the 45-year-Zong Somoza dynasty must be altered.
 A growing number of Nicaraguans would, if necessary, even sup-
 port violent change.//
 //It appears that the movement toward change
 of some kind has been encouraged by the belief that the US is
 providing Zess support to Somoza than heretofore. Somoza prob-
 ably has a better than even chance of finishing his term in
 1981, but there is some possibility that the situation could de-
 teriorate more quickly.//
 //Somoza's ability to engineer an orderly
 evolution ?owa          new competitive system is being undermined
 by the rebels' success in creating turmoil. Somoza has been
 receptive to discussions with critics of the establishment and
 has demonstrated restraint even toward the Marxist revolution-
 aries. His stabs at statesmanship, however--for example, his
 offer of constitutional changes--are treated by the opposition
 with skepticism born of many years frustration.//
 I                        //It is increasingly evident that younger,
 well-educated Nicaraguans and determined to make the most of the
 present situation. These young nationalists do not trust Somoza,

 and they are not likely to sit still for any gradual changes to
 the political system fashioned by Somoza and his family. In ad-
 dition to their awareness of the country's political backward-
 ness,                        the younger Nicaraguans are concerned over the fact that
 an entrenched entrepreneurial class has reaped most of Nicara-
 gua's economic profits.//
 //In addition to his domestic challenges,
 omoza   aces    e prospect of increasing international criticism
 of his regime. In this regard, the US stand on human rights
 works both to encourage Somoza's opponents and to reduce his
 room for maneuver.//
 //Somoza's ability to temporize may diminish
 further as his government's energies are increasingly devoted
 to trying to curb the campaign of violence now being waged by
 two factions of the splintered Sandinist National Liberation
 Front, a Marxist organization. The National Guard will be spread
 thin by a prolonged period of rebel violence. This is likely to
 demoralize the President's frontline security forces, which in
 turn could weaken their loyalty to the regime.//
 //Somoza's decision to give the Guard a free
 hand militarily in attempting to quash the rebels may backfire.
 The inevitable casualties will intensify the human rights issue
 and prompt greater international concern. At the same time, some
 besieged Nicaraguan townspeople--who may or may not be sympa-
 thetic to the rebels--will almost certainly lodge new grievances
 against Somoza's security forces.//
 //Somoza's best chances for survival until
 1981 lie with the members of the Nicaraguan establishment, whose
 vested interests largely parallel his own. The threat of young
 radicals shaping events may be enough to convince the President's
 political antagonists within the establishment that they should
 accept his invitation to work together for a controlled tran-
 sition period. Somoza can still count--at least in the short
 term--on a loyal and effective security force, and his supporters
 in the Liberal Party have not lost faith in his judgment and his
 ability to control events.//
 //An alliance involving political groups,
 the National Guard, and prominent businessmen may not hold up,
 however, if the revolutionaries seem to be gaining ground. While
 Somoza still appears to be in a position to control events, the
 situation could quickly deteriorate to the Point where
 have to surrender power.                                                           25X1
