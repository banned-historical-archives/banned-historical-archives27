 VIETNAM
 Allied forces continue to maintain the military initia-
 tive in South Vietnam.   The Communists,  however,  are
 gradually improving their posture in the two northern-
 most provinces,  their capability for a major offensive
 only temporarily diminished by recent allied spoiling
 operations.   The Viet Cong apparently are also making
 a significant effort to disrupt the election of a con-
 stituent assembly by the South Vietnamese next month.

 Besides criticizing US policy in Vietnam in harsher

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S TRADE LOOKS WESTWARD
 About 70 percent of China's total trade in 1965 was

 USSR as its leading trading partner,  and Chinese trade
 with Western Europe also is growing rapidly.
 SUKARNO AND INDONESIAN TRIUMVIRATE STILL SPARRING
 Sukarno continues his obstructive tactics,  but General

 SOVIET OIL SALES LOSE GROUND
 Although the USSR has increased the volume of its oil

 VIETNAM
 The Communists continue to
 improve their military posture
 in South Vietnam's Quang Tri and
 Thua Thien provinces.   Their
 capability to support a major of-
 fensive in this area of I Corps
 has been only temporarily dimin-
 ished by recent allied spoiling
 operations.
 The strength of enemy forces
 in the two northern I Corps prov-
 inces ranges from at least five
 confirmed regiments to a possi-
 ble seven regiments.   In addition,
 confirmed separate battalions in
 Thua Thien Province have the
 capability to operate as a coord-
 inated regiment, and a reserve
 force of at least two regiments
 is available in North Vietnam
 near the DMZ.   Although uncon-
 firmed, one regiment and six
 Vietnamese Communist battalions
 may be in Laos adjacent to the
 Quang Tri - Thua Thien area.
 Elsewhere, allied forces
 continued to maintain the mili-
 tary initiative.   Australian
 forces last week scored an im-
 pressive victory over the Viet
 Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province.
 Total Communist losses for the
 four-day operation--named SMITH-
 FIELD--were 245 killed and four
 captured.   Australian casualties
 were reported as 17 killed and
 22 wounded.
 Scattered skirmishes be-
 tween allied and Communist troops
 were reported as allied forces
 participating in Operation PAUL
 REVERE II continued to sweep the
 western portion of Pleiku Prov-
 ince.   US soldiers captured a
 quantity of 37-mm.  antiaircraft
 ammunition--the first reported
 instance of the capture of this
 type of ammunition in South Viet-
 nam.
 Operation COLORADO,  a multi-
 battalion US Marine search-and-
 destroy operation conducted in
 the coastal flatlands of Quang
 Nam and Quang Tin provinces ended
 with a total of 514 Communists
 killed and 54 captured.   A total
 of 25 Americans have been killed
 and 177 wounded since the opera-
 tion began on 5 August.
 Election Developments
 The Viet Cong are apparently
 making a significant effort to
 disrupt the election of a con-
 stitutional assembly in South
 Vietnam on 11 September.   Commu-
 nist antielection propaganda,
 more intensive than that preced-
 ing past elections, reached a
 high point on 21 August when a
 Liberation Radio broadcast threat-
 ened the lives of candidates and
 government personnel assisting

 in the election process in the
 Saigon area.   Other action by
 armed Viet Cong units was also
 alluded to in the broadcast.
 Reports of Viet Cong plans
 to disrupt the elections have
 also come from the provinces and
 are of varying degrees of relia-
 bility.   They range from the
 seizure of voter identity cards,
 sabotage of polling places, and
 interception of ballot boxes to
 the specific deployment of a
 well-armed Viet Cong battalion
 near a populated area in central
 Vietnam.   Few Communist inci-
 dents directly associated with
 the election have been reported
 thus far, but more can be ex-
 pected as election day approaches.
 A continuation of the recent up-
 swing in the number of small-
 scale Viet Cong attacks and gen-
 eral terrorism could also reduce
 the voter turnout.
 The Buddhist Institute mili-
 tants are also implementing their
 call for an election boycott.
 According to evidence received
 by the US Embassy,  an antielec-
 tion communique issued by the
 Institute on 13 August has been
 -transmitted to Buddhist represen-
 tatives in the delta,  and possi-
 bly throughout the country. Mod-
 erate Buddhists, who presently
 have little influence on institute
 policy,  feel that the militants
 are planning some kind of action
 to dramatize the boycott, al-
 though they do not believe that
 the militants would dare to re-
 sume street demonstrations.
 Meanwhile, the US Embassy
 has reported that government ef-
 forts to stimulate voter aware-
 ness are showing good results.
 Normal censorship restrictions
 will be relaxed and candidates
 will be given,:Free broadcasting
 time during the formal campaign
 beginning on 26 August.
 Some 73 percent of the
 electorate voted in last year's
 local elections, but in that
 case national government pres-
 tige was less an issue, there
 was no Buddhist opposition, and
 the Viet Cong had made far less
 effort to keep down the vote.

 last spring's Buddhist-inspired
 "struggle movement" and concluded
 that in the future their Libera-
 tion Front should assume a larger
 and more active role in such de-
 monstrations against the Ky gov-
 ernment.   The author, writing
 under a pseudonym, described the
 Buddhist defiance of government
 authority in Hue and Da Nang as
 essentially different from previ-
 ous antigovernment demonstra-
 tions largely because of its
 anti-American overtones.   He
 recommended that the Communists
 increase their efforts to pene-
 trate politically significant
 urban groups such as Buddhists,
 student organizations,  and labor
 unions in an effort to bring them
 under effective Communist control
 and to develop their potential
 for creating political unrest.
 Without voicing any specific
 criticism of Liberation Front
 handling of the Buddhist defiance
 last spring, the current commen-
 tary contrasts with the front's
 extreme caution throughout the
 three-month period when the Bud-
 dhists were effectively chal-
 lenging government authority.
 At that time the front cast
 itself in an observer status,
 carefully avoiding open coopera-
 tion with the Buddhists as well
 as overt participation in the
 demonstrations.   Both front and
 North Vietnamese Government offi-
 cials privately spoke in disparag-
 ing terms of the Buddhist lead-
 ership, and front propaganda was
 restricted to inviting the strug-
 gle forces to join the front.
 The front mounted no independent
 political or military initiative
 which would significantly divert
 government forces or assist the
 Buddhiss.
 CAMBODIA'S BORDER PROBLEMS
 Cambodia is moving closer
 to a border agreement with the
 Viet Cong's National Liberation
 Front,  although there are still
 differences to be resolved.
 In a 19 August press con-
 ference, Sihanouk said that ne-
 gotiations with the Viet Cong
 Page  3
 were already under way and that
 a border agreement would probably
 be signed before the end of the
 year.   He claimed that the Viet
 Cong had agreed to recognize Cam-
 bodia's sovereignty over certain
 small islands lying between Phu
 Quoc Island and the Cambodian
 coast, whose disposition has long
 been at issue between Phnom Penh
 and Saigon.

 Sihanouk alluded, however,
 to certain "difficulties" which
 remain to be negotiated.   He
 claimed that the Viet Cong were
 asking "guarantees"  for the Viet-
 namese community in Cambodia.   If
 so,  the Communists are presumably
 countering Sihanouk's long-stand-
 ing demand that ethnic Cambodians
 living in South Vietnam be af-
 forded special status.   This is-
 sue apparently contributed to the
 failure of border talks in 1964.
 Another possible point of
 contention is Sihanouk's apparent
 desire that the agreement be
 signed in the name of his Sang-
 kum party and the National Libera-
 tion Front as "representatives"
 of the Cambodian and Vietnamese
 people.   He indicated that there
 was some question of whether the
 front constituted a "government"
 and argued that a people-to-
 people agreement might be more
 binding on a future government in
 Saigon.
 His relatively cautious re-
 marks, particularly when he argued
 that Saigon's refusal to nego-
 tiate left no other choice,  indi-
 cate continuing apprehension over
 possible repercussions of signing
 an accord with the Viet Cong. By
 holding out for a quasi-official
 agreement, Sihanouk presumably
 hopes to dampen its impact in
 Saigon.

 DE GAULLE EXPECTED TO MAKE MAJOR VIETNAM SPEECH I N CAMBODIA
 De Gaulle will probably use
 his 31 August - 2 September stay
 in Cambodia as a platform for a
 major policy speech on Vietnam.
 Cambodia's neutrality,  its prox-
 imity to Vietnam,  and the parallel
 interest both Sihanouk and De
 Gaulle have in resolving the
 crisis combine to make this visit
 a suitable occasion for such a
 speech.
 De Gaulle's pronouncements
 are expected to be harsher in
 tone than heretofore,  and may
 spell out in greater detail than
 before the conditions he considers
 must be fulfilled before negoti-
 ations over Vietnam can take
 place.   French Foreign Ministry
 spokesmen as well as knowledge-
 able French journalists expect
 De Gaulle to be more outspoken
 than previously in his criticism
 of "outside"--i.e.,  US--inter-
 vention.   These sources also be-
 lieve the general will condemn in
 stronger terms than heretofore
 alleged US escalation of the war
 and the bombings of North Vietnam,
 stressing that US policies carry
 the danger of extending the war
 far beyond its present theater.
 De Gaulle may also outline
 his views on the timing of a US
 troop withdrawal--views which he
 hinted at during his July conver-
 sations with the King of Laos--
 and indicate whether he believes
 a neutrality policy should apply
 to North Vietnam as well as South
 Vietnam.   Finally,  De Gaulle might
 for the first time publicly call
 for participation of all Viet-
 namese factions in any future
 negotiations.
 The French have publicly
 stated many times their position
 that an international conference
 should be convened to negotiate
 an agreement incorporating a
 cease-fire,  the withdrawal of
 foreign forces,  and the eventual
 reunification of North and South
 Vietnam.
 Since his first
 call for an international con-
 ference in July 1964,  De Gaulle
 has engaged in a series of pub-
 lic and private activities both
 to improve the prospect for ne-
 gotiations and to ensure a promi-
 nent French role.
 The expected Cambodian
 speech would be  another effort

 is unlikely, however, that De
 Gaulle will take the further
 step of advancing concrete   ro-
 posals at this time.
 con-
 ditions are not ripe for such

 probably no more willing than
 before to engage his prestige
 without some degree of certainty
 of success.

 NEW SHIFTS I N CHINESE COMMUNIST POWER STRUCTURE
 Profound changes in the
 power structure of the Chinese
 Communist Party have apparently
 taken place,  the most signifi-
 cant being the breakup of that
 group of leaders who had run
 the party machinery for more
 than a decade.   A possible new
 politburo lineup, headed by
 Mao Tse-tung and Defense Minister
 Lin Piao, was unveiled at a
 rally held in Peking on 18
 August  (see inset).   The situa-
 tion, however,  is still highly
 unstable and more changes may
 be in prospect.
 The new team may be facing
 strong opposition to its attempts
 to consolidate control.   On

 23 August the authoritative
 pa,  y paper People's Daily
 declared that a "faction- in
 power" was stubbornly resisting
 Mao's leadership.   Previously
 Peking had insisted that only a
 "small handful" of people
 opposed him.   On 21 August the
 party magazine Red Flag demanded
 the dismissal "Trom   1s official
 posts and functions" of any
 person who opposes Mao,  "no
 matter how high his position,
 how old his standing, and how
 great his  'fame.' " Similar
 statements were made in early
 June when the fall of senior
 politburo member Peng Chen was
 publicized.
 Mao's apparent decision to
 name Lin Piao as his successor
 seems to reflect the aging
 leader's growing mistrust of
 other elements in the leader-
 ship.                        On 18 August the party
 press described Lin as Mao's
 "close comrade in arms," the
 only leader to receive this
 accolade in nearly two years.
 Chou En-lai was said to be a
 "comrade in arms" of Mao, but
 no one else was given even this
 crumb of appreciation.
 In 1964, Peking found occa-
 sions to refer to party-machine
 leaders Liu Shao-chi, party
 general secretary Teng Hsiao-
 ping,  and Peng Chen--as well as
 Lin Piao and Chou En-lai--as
 Mao's "closest comrades in arms,"
 an indication that this group
 then constituted his inner cir-
 cle of advisers.   Liu Shao-chi,
 who had been Mao's first deputy
 in the party since 1945,  still
 holds his ceremonial job of chief
 of state, but has clearly been
 demoted in his party rank.   Teng
 Hsiao-ping also appears to have
 lost ground,  although not as
 much.   An indication of their
 decline is that neither has
 been credited with playing any
 role in the cultural revolution,
 which is now identified ad
 nauseum as the most important
 political program of the day.
 Liu, Teng,  and their sub-
 ordinates had long seemed to
 enjoy Mao's trust, not only
 because they had a record of
 personal loyalty to him but also
 because their radical approach
 was in accord with his.   The
 major party figures dismissed
 in recent months--Peng Chen,
 army chief of staff Lo Jui-
 ching,  and the propaganda chiefs
 Lu Ting-i and Chou Yang--had
 seemed to hold similar views.
 This presents a puzzling
 contradiction, especially with
 respect to policy implications.
 Mao seemingly is intent on
 pushing a radical program re-
 shaping society,  and is bringing
 to the fore radical leaders like
 Tao Chu and Chen Po-ta.   There
 is therefore no satisfactory
 explanation for his willingness
 to turn against old comrades who
 seemed to share his views and to
 retain or promote men like Chou
 En-lai and the economic special-
 ists Li Fu-chun and Chen Yun.
 These men are relative moderates
 who in the past espoused prag-
 matic economic views of the kind
 now condemned as  "revisionist."

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S TRADE LOOKS WESTWARD
 China's increasing politi-
 cal isolation from the Communist
 world is leading to further re-
 orientation of trade toward the
 free world.
 The trend was first noted
 in 1965, when about 70 percent
 of China's total trade of $3.7
 billion was with non-Communist
 countries and almost 40 percent
 with the industrial West.   Since
 then, Japan has displaced the
 USSR as China's leading trading
 partner.   Their total trade in
 the first six months of 1966 was
 valued at $320 million,  an in-
 crease of 41 percent over the
 first half of 1965.
 Trade with Western Europe
 also is growing rapidly.   In the
 first five months of this year
 total trade with the UK rose
 about 60 percent, with Italy
 about 30 percent,  and with the
 Netherlands about 25 percent
 over the same period in 1965.
 Grain continues to account
 for a substantial portion of
 China's total imports--about 25
 percent in 1965.   However,  there
 has been a significant growth in
 imports of capital equipment.
 Recent imports of machinery as
 well as complete plants empha-
 size China's drive to achieve
 industrial growth by purchasing
 equipment inc~:rporating advanced
 technology.   China has signed
 contracts totaling about $50
 million for steel finishing mills
 in addition to contracts for
 complete chemical plants, petro-
 leum refininq'equipment,  computer
 systems,  and other basic indus-
 trial hardware.   Negotiations
 are under way;with a West Euro-
 pean consortiyura for a $150-mil-
 lion steel roiling mill and with
 a Japanese fitm for a titanium
 metal plant.   Such equipment is
 basic to the growth of China's
 economy and cIntributes indirectly
 to its defens   industry.
 The "cultural revolution"
 now going on ~n China could
 dampen  the growth in trade in the
 last half of ]'966.

 SUKARNO AND INDONESIAN TRIUMVIRATE STILL SPARRING
 Indonesian army chief and
 government head General Suharto
 continues his plans to reduce
 President Sukarno's influence,
 but apparently has no intention
 of forcibly removing him from of-
 fice at this time.
 Sukarno,  for his part,  con-
 tinues his obstructive tactics.
 His independence-day speech on 17
 August took a line sharply tangen-
 tial to that of the government,
 and he insisted that he still
 holds pre-eminent power.   Although
 he is no longer able to exert any
 significant influence on national
 policy, his potential for trouble-
 making is considerable.   His emo-
 tional appeal--quite aside from
 the policies he espouses--remains
 great in densely populated East
 and Central Java.
 The large National Party
 (PNI), whose principal strength
 is on Java,  remains loyal to Su-
 karno,                   and the PNI's new moderate
 national leadership has been un-
 able to purge the party of left-
 wing elements which still control
 party units in many areas.   The
 PNI is engaged in an intensive
 ideological and organization pro-
 gram directed toward the 1968
 elections and appears to have am-
 ple funds.   It not only is bringing
 SECRET
 into its ranks ex-Communists who
 have been cleared by the army but,
 at Sukarno's request, has agreed
 to admit Communists, particularly
 members of the youth front.   On
 19 August PNI youths,  armed with
 knives and chains, repeatedly
 clashed with anti-Sukarno youth
 elements  in Bandung,  West Java;
 two students were killed.
 These youth clashes were at
 least partially precipitated by
 virulent student demonstrations
 protesting Sukarno's 17 August
 speech.   Since the anti-Sukarno
 activity went considerably be-
 yond approved bounds,  the army
 now has banned all demonstrations
 in both West Java and Djakarta
 and will continue to keep a tight
 check on any activity that could
 lead to violence.                     25X1

 SOVIET OIL SALES LOSE GROUND
 The Soviet share of the
 free world oil market is shrink-
 ing,  particularly in Western Eu-
 rope  where shipments from the
 USSR have failed to keep pace
 with expanding fuel consumption.
 Moscow has, however,  increased
 the volume of its oil shipments
 to free world destinations,  and
 they remain one of Russia's
 largest sources of hard currency,
 earning about $250 million last
 year.
 Soviet deliveries to under-
 developed countries,  frequently
 under clearing arrangements that
 do not add to hard currency
 earnings, are being maintained
 at substantial levels, assuring
 a competitive position in mar-
 kets which will one day be major
 consumers of oil products. Last
 year these countries took about
 one third of all Soviet oil ex-
 ports to non-Communist countries.
 The USSR has programed in-
 creasing deliveries of petroleum
 to Eastern Europ4 during the
 next. few years, and these should
 satisfy most of the rising fuel
 demands there.   Some of these
 countries, however,  already are
 developing free world sources
 of supply which will be neces-
 sary by 1970 to supplement So-
 viet deliveries.'
 While the USSR continues to
 foster its oil sales program
 and this year plans its largest
 oil production increase to date,
 it also is attempting to keep
 pace with other developments in
 the fuel industry.   Attention
 is being paid to tithe use of
 natural gas, which looms large
 in fuel planning for the future.
 The USSR already has agreements
 with Afghanistanand Iran for
 the purchase of natural gas for
 deficit areas in the Soviet Un-
 ion. On the other hand the USSR        25X1

 ITALY'S SOCIALIST COALITION PARTNERS NEAR REUNIFICATION
 Italy's Socialist Party
 (PSI)  and the Social Democratic
 Party (PSDI)--which split off
 from the PSI in 1947--have
 finished preliminary prepara-
 tions begun last year to rejoin
 forces.   The reunification--to
 be completed this fall--will
 have far-reaching effects on
 relationships among the country's
 major political parties,  and
 probably will necessitate some
 adjustment of ministerial posts
 within the center-left coalition
 government, in which both the
 PSI and PSDI now participate.
 The merger of the PSI's
 400,000 members and the PSDI's
 160,000 will reduce the number
 of Italian parties of national
 importance to eight.   It will
 also accentuate the trend evi-
 dent in recent years toward a
 complete PSI break with the Com-
 munist Party.   The, prospect of
 socialist reunification has al-
 ready helped undercut the Com-
 munists'  appeal for a "new major-
 ity" to govern Italy.   The Com-
 munists also fear that the emer-
 gence of the new party will
 cause them to lose further power
 at the local level in areas
 where the PSI heretofore has
 joined with them to form govern-
 ing councils.
 The unified socialist party
 may in time present a challenge
 to the dominance of its coali-
 tion partner,  the Christian Demo-
 cratic Party.   Campaigning sepa-
 rately,  the PSI and PSDI won a
 combined total of slightly over
 12 percent of the popular vote
 in the 1963 national elections.
 By a pooled effort,  the new party
 may be able gradually to improve
 its position by drawing votes
 from both the Christian Democrats,
 who won 38.3 percent of the vote
 in 1963,  and the Communists, who
 polled 25.3 percent.   The merger
 will also rule out any future
 Christian and Social Democratic
 combination, which in past Italian
 government crises has been viewed
 as providing the basis for an al-
 ternative to the center-left for-
 mula.
 A joint PSI-PSDI committee
 in late July approved the basic
 documents setting out the new
 party's political principles,  its
 statute, and temporary rules for
 its management.   The central com-
 mittees of the two parties will
 meet on 16 and 17 September to
 "debate" the agreements.   Na-
 tional PSI and PSDI congresses
 will be convoked between 19 and
 21 October and, barring unfore-
 seen difficulties,  a socialist
 constituent assembly will meet
 on 22 and 23 October to approve
 formal unification.
 At this juncture,  there ap-
 pears to be no major obstacle
 within either party to formal
 reunification, but the period
 before the new party's first
 congress is likely to be marked
 by pulling and hauling over or-
 ganizational problems.   These
 will require considerable atten-
 tion from the new party's presi-
 dent, PSI leader and Vice Pre-
 mier Nenni, who may therefore
 have to  relinquish the vice
 premiership to devote full time
 to party responsibilities.   In
 any case, both the Christian Demo-
 crats and the Communists can be
 expected to seize any opportunity
 to try to drive a wedge between
 the new partners.

 An armed clash between Greek

 remove the police post permanently.
 Tension in Paphos-Ktima
 stemmed primarily from the shoot-
 ing of an unarmed Turkish Cypriot
 youth by a Greek Cypriot police-
 man on 12 August.   The Turks
 Makarios was typically ada-

 consider removal of the police

 are adding to Mobutu's problems.

 mid-July have renewed their ac-

 troops now gathered in Kisangani.
 Moreover, bickering and indecision

 The state elections come at
 a time when the government is
 under fire from almost all
 political and economic sectors.
 Coffee growers and other busi-
 nessmen are opposed to austere
 economic policies;  some hard-line
 military officers want stronger
 action against corrupt politi-
 cians;  and church leaders in the
 impoverished northeast have
 issued a manifesto highly criti-
 cal of the government's failure
 to alleviate conditions there.
 Students and labor have been
 especially outspoken in recent
 weeks.
 Carlos Lacerda,  a volatile
 leader of the 1964 revolution
 which ousted leftist president
 Goulart, has called for united
 opposition to the regime.   In
 two open letters he recently
 warned that if the revolution
 were not "renovated," Communism
 would be its eventual successor.
 He dismissed hope;for improve-

 He may even believe that he can
 precipitate a crisis by forcing
 the government to ':make a martyr
 of him.
 However, the government
 appears firmly in control.   No
 one issue unites the administra-
 tion's disparate critics,  and
 as yet opposition ias not
 coalesced around any one group
 or leader.   There 1s no evidence
 of significant plotting against
 the government, and Castello
 Branco appears able to count on
 the continuing loyalty of most
 of the military.
 GUERRILLA TERRORISM IN GUATEMALA
 Communist guerrillas in
 Guatemala, who rejected a gov-
 ernment amnesty offer in late
 July,  appear to be renewing
 their terrorism.
 During recent weeks there
 have been three widespread
 attacks. A former policeman was
 shot and wounded in downtown
 Guatemala City; Manuel Orellana
 Portillo,  a prominent conserva-
 tive and former president of the
 national congress.. was assassi-
 nated in the northeastern
 Department of Zacapa;  and most
 recently on 19 August,  retired
 Colonel Pedro Cardona and one or
 more of his companions were
 killed in Escuintla';, southwest
 of the capital.   The Communist
 Party's action arm,  the FAR, has

 claimed credit for all three
 attacks.
 In the meantime, according
 to a FAR communique, national
 congress vice president Hector
 Menendez de la Riva (now resi-
 dent in Washington)  has also
 been placed on the assassination
 "list" because he escaped from
 FAR capture in early June.   US
 Embassy sources report that
 other congressmen have also
 been threatened.
 MEXICO ,

 LOCATIONS OF RECENT
 ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS
 In view of the FAR's past
 success in carrying out its
 threats it can be expected that
 some of these men will be killed.
 Although the FAR is only some
 200 strong, it apparently plans
 its actions carefully and
 executes them professionally.
 Meanwhile public confidence in
 the government's ability to pro-
 tect citizens' lives is being
 eroded and may again reach
 crisis proportions, as it did
 late last year when the FAR and
 Yon Sosa's 13 November Revolu-
 tionary Movement  kidnaped  four
 prominent Guatemalans for over
 $350,000 ransom. Two prominent
 officials--the former president
 of the Supreme Court and the
 former secretary of information--
 kidnaped by the FAR on 4 May are
 still missing.

 COMMUNIST PARTY OF URUGUAY HOLDS CONGRESS
 The 19th national congress
 of the Communist Party of Uru-
 guay  (PCU)             was held from 9 to 13
 August with many foreign dele-
 gates in attendance.   "US inter-
 ference in Latin America and Uru-
 guay" was the main theme used to
 set the international tone of
 the congress.   This issue was
 included in speeches by PCU
 leaders, by Gus Hall,  secretary
 general of the US party   and by
 Vasily Tolstikov,  a member of
 the central committee of the So-
 viet Communist Party.  Several
 speakers emphasized the need for
 each Communist party to deter-
 mine its own tactical line--an
 obvious rebuff to the sentiments
 expressed in Fidel Castro's 26
 July speech,  to which the PCU
 had taken exception as unwar-
 ranted interference in its af-
 fairs .
 Uruguay is presently
 the only country on the east
 coast of South America in which
 the Communists could hope to in-
 fluence national Policy through
 a legal and politically active
 movement.   Serious economic de-
 cline and a soaring cost of liv-
 ing in Uruguay are providing them
 with nearly ideal conditions for
 promoting disorder and seeking
 the overturn of the country's
 traditional institutions.   Uru-
 guay is a safe haven for Commu-
 nists and other leftist political
 exiles and a baste for their op-
 erations in South America.
 Aside from its interna-
 tional aspects,  the congress was
 a turning point lfor the PCU's
 internal policies with the cre-
 ation of a strea#n:lined central
 committee and s:i nificant
 changes in organization and pol-
 icies. Emphasis iaas put on the
 party's develop:L-g capability to
 implement two or! more seemingly
 contradictory'taotical lines
 simultaneously a-id on the need
 to provide the nucleus of a para-
 military apparat~s .   The control
 commission has been expanded,
 and there is a new stress on
 security principles and proce-
 dures--probably reflecting the
 party's fear of    rightist coup.
 PCU membership has grown
 swiftly since th4 last congress
 in 1962 from about. 10,000 to an
 estimated 18, 0001 t:o 20,000.
 The party's influence has espe-
 cially increased!in labor and
 education.    In their attempts
 to increase PCU influence and
 strength still further, PCU
 leaders can be expected to cite
 the successful conclusion of
 the congress as dvidence of the
 party's dynamism and efficiency.
