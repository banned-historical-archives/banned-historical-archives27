 The rapid succession of incidents on Israel's borders
 with Syria, Jordan and Egypt is evidence of increasing
 confidence on the part of the Arabs and of Israel's deter-
 mination to maintain an unyielding position.   These factors,
 the weakening of restraints in Jordan implicit in the dis-
 missal of British officers from the Arab Legion, and
 Israel's apparently increasing fears of Arab intentions
 have materially increased the danger that war could break
 out as a result of miscalculation on either side.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Peiping's Statement on the Geneva Talks: The 4 March state-
 ment by Peiping 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the
 Sino-American negotiations implied a more specific
 threat to the offshore islands than previous Communist
 declarations.          The statement was apparently timed to
 coincide with Secretary of State Dulles' visit to
 Asia, in the hope that Asian leaders would bring
 personal pressure on him to agree to direct talks with
 Chou En-lai.  Peiping seems disposed to continue the
 negotiations while preparing a case for American re-
 sponsibility if the talks break down.
 Page  1 25X1
 Cyprus: A new test of strength between the British
 security forces on Cyprus and the island's Greek
 majority seems likely following the suspension on
 1 March of negotiations between the British and Arch-
 bishop Makarios.  The failure of the talks also has
 the effect of widening the breach between Greece and
 Turkey.                                .       .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  2
 Morocco and Tunisia:   The declaration issued on 2 March by
 the French an  Moroccan governments is essentially a
 compromise permitting the current talks to proceed.
 Negotiations which will spell out French-Moroccan
 ties are expected to be conducted simultaneously in
 Rabat and Paris and may last until late in the summer.
 The Tunisians, who began new negotiations with the
 French on 29 February, have demanded the abrogation
 of the 1881 Treaty of Bardo, which established the
 protectorate.                                      .    .  .  .  .     Page  3
 Afghanistan:   The fast pace set by the USSR in its Afghan
 aid program is reflected in an unusually heavy flow
 of Soviet traffic and personnel to Kabul late in
 February and reported Afghan approval of an increase
 in the Soviet embassy staff.   An agreement covering
 part of the $100,000,000 Soviet credit was signed on
 2 March.  Provision for airfield construction in the
 agreement is probably part of a Soviet drive to get
 control of Afghan civil aviation.

 8 March 1956
 Shift in Communist Tactics Against South Vietnam:   Continued
 strengthening of t -Se Diem regime, most recently dem-
 onstrated in the 4 March election, has caused the Viet
 Minh to reassess its tactics toward the south.  Real-
 izing that unification elections will not be held in
 1956 and that there are no good prospects for over-
 throwing Diem by internal revolt, the Viet Minh is
 calling for new international negotiations, and is pre-
 paring for a long-term subversion effort.                  Page
 Singapore:   Singapore's Chief Minister David Marshall is
 preparing to go to London late in April for talks
 on self-government.   He does so in an atmosphere of
 diminishing British confidence in Singapore's readi-
 ness for self-rule.                         In view of steadily increasing
 Communist subversion in the colony, British officials
 are concerned over the absence of a strong non-
 Communist party or a competent non-Communist local
 leader in whose hands the new powers could be safely

 Indonesia:   President Sukarno has asked ex-prime minister
 Al~Sastroamidjojo to be the formateur of a new
 Indonesian cabinet.  Chances that Sastroamidjojo will
 succeed are slim, and Sukarno may have to appoint
 one or more other formateurs.   Sukarno would like
 to have the cabinet formed by 26 March when the
 elected parliament is to be installed.  Regardless
 of whether the anti-Communist Masjumi participates
 in the new cabinet, Indonesian policy probably will
 be more strongly nationalistic than at any time in
 USSR Urges Resumption of Relations With Australia: Soviet
 officials in the UN have approached t eir Australian
 colleagues three times since November with proposals
 for re-establishing Soviet-Australian relations.
 Their efforts so far have made little progress,
 because of Soviet insistence that Australia publicly
 take the initiative, but the USSR will probably
 modify this position.                                           Page  9  25X1
 South Korean Liberal Party Nominations:   President Rhee's
 ref usa  to be renominated on the Liberal Party ticket
 serves to remind the party of its dependence on Rhee
 and sets the stage for his draft by popular acclaim.
 Although Liberal Party chairman Yi Ki-pung has been
 nominated for vice president,  it is possible that
 Rhee will not endorse any one candidate.

 Opposition to Rakosi in Hungary:   Hungarian party leader
 ads , who has been having difficulty for some
 time in controlling. nationalist elements among the
 Hungarian Communists, probably faces new threats to
 his position.  Moscow may decide eventually to
 sacrifice Rakosi, particularly if he is unable to
 overcome the serious factionalism within his party.
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 SOVIET POSITION ON DISARMAMENT .
 The Soviet representative in the London talks of the
 UN Disarmament Subcommittee convening on 19 March will
 probably press the Western powers to accept the interim
 measures suggested by Khrushchev in his report to the
 20th Party Congress:   discontinuation of thermonuclear
 weapons tests, prohibition of possession of atomic
 weapons by forces stationed in Germany, and reduction
 of military budgets.   Otherwise the USSR probably will
 stand firm on the basic disarmament position set forth in
 its 10 May proposals of last year.'

 THE COMMUNIST PARTIES OF WESTERN EUROPE   .  .  .  ,  ,  .  ,               Page 3
 The evolution of the new Bulganin-Khrushchev foreign
 policy over the past year seems to have been of little
 help to the political fortunes of the Communist parties of
 Western Europe.   In most countries,  the influence of the
 parties has remained about the same or slightly declined.
 Where they have gained, or where they remain a major
 political force, as in France and Italy, this is largely
 the result of local developments.   As adjuncts of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union,  the European Communists
 appear to have been able to produce only limited support
 for Soviet foreign policy goals and to gain only limited
 benefits from shifts in Soviet policy, even when these have
 been in the direction of moderation.

 MAO TSE-TUNG AND THE COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLE .       Page 8
 Mao Tse-tung and other Chinese Communist leaders
 have regularly endorsed the principle of "collective
 leadership," but Mao for many years has personally led
 the Chinese Communist Party and has personally controlled
 its policy in a way not very different from Stalin's
 domination of the USSR.  Mao's personal direction has
 been particularly evident in the past year.   Nevertheless,
 Mao's program in China--that is, Chinese "application"
 of Marxist-Leninist doctrine--has continued to be warmly
 praised by Soviet leaders.   Khrushchev's pragmatic
 approach to ideology suggests that he and Mao are suited
 to work well with one another.   C
 JAPANESE INTEREST IN PROMOTING AN INDEPENDENT TAIWAN .  .     Page 11
 Japanese leaders have long maintained that the
 creation of two Chinas offers the only feasible solution
 for the present impasse over the international status of
 Taiwan and Communist China.   They are insistent that
 Taiwan must not fall into Communist hands.   They fear
 this might occur suddenly, because of a collapse of the
 Nationalist regime through demoralization or the death of
 Chiang Kai-shek.   This apprehension and the conviction
 that an independent Taiwan would be the most favorable
 solution for Japanese interests are behind the inclination
 of Japanese leaders to favor a Taiwan independence move-

 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 The rapid succession of
 border incidents on Israel's
 borders with Syria, Jordan
 and Egypt illustrates the in-
 creasing confidence of the
 Arabs,  as well as Israel's
 determination to maintain an
 unyielding position.   These
 factors,  the weakening of re-
 straints in Jordan implicit
 in the relief of British of-
 ficers in the Arab Legion,
 and Israel's apparently in-
 creasing fears of Arab inten-
 tions have materially in-
 creased the danger that war
 could break out as a result
 of miscalculation on either
 side.
 There are some indica-
 tions that  Israel,  in the
 light of its failure to se-
 cure arms from she West, may
 seek a rapprochement with the
 USSR.    Tel Aviv officials
 have said they are now will-
 ing to admit Soviet personnel
 under the UN technical assist-
 ance program,  and even moder-
 ate Israeli newspapers have
 suggested. that the Soviet
 Union be given a voice in Near
 Eastern affairs.
 Some went so Tar as to
 suggest that  Israel might ask
 the USSR for a guarantee of
 the status quo.   This may be
 the policy decision American
 observers in Israel have be-
 lieved imminent.                    The USSR,
 however,  apparently has not
 thus far made any move to
 suggest that it will meet the
 Israelis even halfway in
 supporting them against the
 ArabE..   (Also see Part I, page 4).
 The.fact that  Israel has
 formally called the Palestine
 situation to the attention of
 the UN Security Council sug-
 gests that the Israelis have
 not decided to use the latest
 spate of border incidents as
 a takeoff point for larger-
 scale hostilities.   Should
 some kind. of UN action not be
 forthcoming,  however,  the Is-
 raeli government might well feel
 impelled to stage a Iretaila-
 tory" action,  especially if
 new incidents seem to threaten
 the security of Israel's bor-
 ders.
 The disappearance of
 British influence in Jordan
 has led Israeli foreign min-
 ister Sharett to comment that
 Israel was being "encircled"
 by the "long arm" of Egyptian
 prime minister Nasr.   Egyptian
 influence in Jordan is almost
 certain to become dominant
 with the departure of the Brit-
 ish,;  but Nasr's problems
 may Llso increase as a result
 of this victory for his policy.
 Nasr has already been at
 pains to urge the Syrians to
 moderation;  with Jordan under
 his wing,  he must also con-
 cern himself with the possi-
 bility that precipitate action
 by Arab Legion units against
 Israel could lead to Egyptian
 involvement in war before Cairo's
 preparations are completed.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 THE THREAT TO BRITISH INTERESTS
 IN THE MIDDLE EAST
 The Jordanian king's abrupt
 dismissal of General Glubb on
 1 March is symptomatic of the
 decline in British influence
 in the Middle East generally.
 The Foreign Office has indicated
 to the American embassy in
 London that it believes closer
 support from the United States
 is essential.
 Britain's capacity to.ar
 rest the decline of its influ
 ence in the Middle East has been
 weakened by the progressive de-
 cline in the leverage it can
 exert from its military bases
 in the area.
 In Cyprus, which is now
 Britain's principal base in
 the Middle East, the collapse
 of the latest negotiations with
 Archbishop Makarios means the
 continued commitment of many
 of the 20,000 British troops on
 the island to an intensive anti-
 terrorist drive.  British
 evacuation of the Suez Canal
 base is now far advanced, and
 the Egyptian army maintains
 close surveillance over the
 disposition of the remaining
 British units.   In Libya, the
 British plan soon to increase
 their garrison to armored divi-
 sion strength, but the Foreign
 Office anticipates increasing
 political problems there.
 .FURTHER SOVIET MOVES
 .IN THE NEAR:EAST
 Moscow is continuing to
 capitalize on its rapprochement
 with the Arabs.  A delegation
 of Soviet engineers is on a
 fact-finding trip through the
 Arab states.  According to the
 London interprets recent
 developments in the Middle East
 as increasing the threat to
 Britain's vital oil interests.
 A possible alliance between
 Jordan and Egypt and Syria at
 the minimum could bring heavy
 pressure on Britain by threat-
 ening to stop the flow of Brit
 ish oil through Syrian pipe..
 lines.
 Reaching an agreement with
 Saudi Arabia in the Buraimi
 dispute is now seen by the
 British as of increased urgency,
 both for their oil interests
 and for the general stability
 of the region.
 The British view that im-
 mediate strengthening of the
 Baghdad pact is now necessary
 may reflect a belief that the
 developments in Jordan have

 It is going on to Egypt, Saudi
 Arabia, and possibly Yemen.
 The Arab News Agency states
 that the Soviet delegation has
 shown interest in providing
 Lebanon and Syria with oil refin-
 eries, textile factories, and:..'.
 other installations.  The simi-
 larity of these projects to
 the industries covered in a
 detailed market survey made by
 Czechoslovakia several months
 ago suggests that the Soviet
 survey team will attempt to nego-
 tiate detailed contracts.
 Egypt
 In his first public state-
 ment since he arrived in Cairo
 in late January, Soviet ambas-
 sador Kiselev told the Egyptian
 press that any event in the
 Middle East that affected Soviet-
 Egyptian relations is "an impor-
 tant matter" for the USSR.  He
 said that the Soviet Foreign
 Ministry's statement of 13
 February on the Middle East
 and the resolutions of the So
 viet 20th Party Congress made
 clear the USSR's opposition to
 the dispatch of American and
 British forces to the area--
 without the consent of the
 countries in the area--in the
 event of an Arab-Israeli war.
 Kiselev's remarks, which
 apparently were made with the
 prior approval of the Egyptian
 Foreign Ministry, were evidently
 staged to ensure that Soviet
 views--which tend to support
 present Egyptian foreign policy
 -reach the Egyptian public.
 Just as Moscow hailed the
 violent anti-Western riots in
 Jordan in December and January,
 it has saluted the dismissal
 of General Glubb by King Hussain
 as "a sound patriotic Arab de-
 cision."  Referring to Glubb as
 the "honest servant of colonial-
 ism," Moscow accuses him of
 attempting to use the Arab Legion
 to push Jordan into the "prison"
 of the Baghdad pact by Machine-
 gunning the Jordanian people
 during the December riots.   Iz
 veStia has termed Glubb's dig-
 -m ssa                                                   "a new great defeat of
 British foreign policy in the
 Middle East."
 The USSR apparently hopes
 to maintain a polite diplomatic
 attitude toward Israel while
 simultaneously continuing to
 support Arab aspirations.   Molotov
 reportedly has told Israeli am-
 bassador Avidar in Moscow that
 he could understand Israel's
 security fears and why it de-
 sires to improve its armament.

 The Mollet cabinet is facing
 its first major test in the
 current National Assembly debate
 on its request for extraordinary
 powers for Algeria.  The govern-
 ment still lacks a really effec-
 tive policy for Algeria and the
 search for a scapegoat has in-
 creased the tendency to blame
 the United States for France's
 North African difficulties.
 Premier Mollet's quasi-
 ultimatum to the rebels on 28
 February to lay down their arms
 or face an all-out effort app.eazs
 to have had little effect and
 has tended to weaken his parlia-
 mentary position.   The threat
 of force shocked many members
 of the premier's own Socialist
 Party,  and the Popular Republi-
 cans have stated that they can-
 not condone the government's
 policy.   The current Communist
 line stresses "ties between
 France and Algeria" rather than
 Algerian independence.   The
 Communists may support Mollet
 because of their eagerness to
 maintain the fiction of a. popular
 front.
 The parties of 'the ,?'right
 remain critical of what they
 consider to be Mollet's con-
 tinued inaction,  but may be
 willing to keep him in office
 to take the blame for unpopular
 measures--a factor which Mollet
 probably has taken into consid-
 eration.
 The search for a solution
 now focuses on the feasibility
 of early and massive reinforce-
 ment of French troops in Al-
 geria.   Robert Lacoste, minister
 residing in Algeria, has asked
 for additional troops, in amounts
 variously reported between 100,-
 000 and 200,000,;to::strengthen
 an estimated 200,000 already
 there.   He is reported ready
 to resign if the government does
 not comply.
 French military leaders
 incline to the view that Al-
 geria will be lost unless ex-
 tensive military action is
 taken soon.   General Valluy,
 French representative to the
 NATO Standing Group, estimates
 that the situation requires
 a total of 500,000 troops, but
 he fears that there is not
 enough time to train so many
 men for guerrilla warfare.   Gen-
 eral Augustin Guillaume resigned
 as chairman of the Joint Chiefs
 of Staff Committee in protest
 over the government's indecision,
 stating subsequently that France
 has two alternatives:   to call
 up new troops
 to "evacuate."
 he
 French army maintains a reserve
 subject to immediate recall
 without parliamentary consent
 composed of all conscripts who
 have completed their military
 service within the past three
 years.   This reserve is believed
 to total 420,000, and, although
 it has already been levied on,
 it should be adequate to cover
 a call-up of as many as 300,000.
 Certain officials have
 charged the United States with
 encouraging the nationalists.
 At the   same time they have
 argued that the USSR is attempt-
 ing to outflank NATO by encour-
 aging the Arab states to back
 North African nationalists, and
 Mollet has asked for a joint
 French-American-declaration of
 common,policy on North Africa.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Peiping's Statement on the
 Geneva Talks
 Peiping's Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs has made its
 second appeal to international
 opinion in seven weeks in eon
 nection with the Sino-American
 negotiations at Geneva.   Charg-
 ing that the United States has
 been using the negotiations mere-
 ly to forestall Communist China's
 exercise of its rights to Taiwan
 and the offshore islands, Pei-
 ping warned on 4 March that it
 would not agree to the "dragging
 out" of the talks.
 The specific mention of
 "Taiwan and the coastal islands"
 at five different points in the
 4 March statement strikes a new
 emphasis on the question of the
 offshore islands.   For the past
 year, Communist China has re-
 frained from attempts to capture
 any of the offshore islands and
 in its statements on the Sino-
 American negotiations has slighted
 the islands by referring general-
 ly to the "Taiwan area."   The
 shift in emphasis may be designed
 to underscore the Communists'
 disposition to exercise their
 capabilities against the offshore
 islands if the United States
 maintains its present stand at
 Geneva.
 The ambassadorial-level
 negotiations at Geneva, which
 began on 1 August 1955, resulted
 in fairly rapid agreement that
 nationals desiring repatriation
 would be released expeditiously.
 Despite this agreement, Peiping
 has continued to hold 13 Ameri-
 can prisoners in an obvious at-tempt to force American conces-
 sions as a condition for their
 release.   The concession Peiping
 most desires at this time is
 agreement to hold direct talks
 between Secretary Dulles and
 Foreign Minister Chou En-lai,
 The 4 March statement was
 apparently timed to coincide
 with Secretary Dulles' visit to
 Asia.   The Communists undoubtedly
 hope that Asian leaders, some
 already favorably disposed to
 a Dulles-Chou meeting, will per-
 sonally press their views on
 Mr. Dulles.   Peiping would look
 for assistance particularly from
 Indian prime minister Nehru, who
 will receive the US secretary
 of state over the 9 March week
 end.   During the visit of Khru-
 shchev and Bulganin to India,
 Nehru ,1 oti.ned them in urging
 that the Sino-American talks at
 Geneva be raised to a "higher"
 level.
 Peiping's primary considera-
 tion in pressing for a Dulles-
 Chou meeting involves prestige
 and implied recognition of
 great-power status, which would
 raise its international stature
 and further erode.the standing
 of the Nationalists.   It is
 unlikely that the Communists ac-
 tually  believe a meeting of
 foreign ministers could resolve
 the disputed points at issue.
 The Chinese Communists are
 willing to renounce force but
 only in the most general terms.
 They will not agree to renounce
 force against Taiwan,  asserting
 that the "liberation" of Taiwan
 is a purely domestic matter.
 They concede that Taiwan should
 be "liberated by peaceful means,
 if possible," but affirm tha-L
 it will be "liberated by war, if
 necessary."   They will not recog-
 nize the US right of "individual
 and collective self-defense"
 in the Taiwan area,  since this
 would acknowledge the legitimacy
 of the US Mutual Defense Treaty
 with the Chinese Nationalists.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 While unwilling to renounce
 force against Taiwan,  they would
 like to discuss the "question
 of relaxing and eliminating
 tension in the Taiwan area'-? at
 a conference attended by Dulles
 and Chou.   Since Peiping argues
 that this tension derives from
 the American "occupation" of
 Taiwan,  the conference would
 consider the question of Ameri-
 can "withdrawal."  On all these
 points, Communist China has
 taken an unequivocal stand both
 in official statements and propa-
 ganda broadcasts, and loss of
 face would be entailed in any
 retreat from these declared
 positions.
 Cyprus
 A new test of strength
 between the British security
 forces on Cyprus and the island's
 Greek majority seems likely
 following the suspension on 1
 March of negotiations between
 the British and Archbishop
 Makarios,  The failure of the
 talks also has the effect of
 widening the breach between
 Greece and Turkey.
 Following the breakdown in
 the talks, Governor Harding
 ordered the immediate resump-
 tion of extensive security op-
 erations by the 15,000 police
 and British troops.   Makarios
 has announced that the British
 must initiate any further talks
 and has asked the 410,000 Cypriot
 Peiping seems disposed to
 continue the negotiations while
 preparing a case for American
 responsibility if the talks
 break down.   This does not neces-
 sarily mean continuing Communist
 forbearance toward the offshore
 islands. As the record in Korea
 demonstrates, protracted nego-
 tiations do not preclude con-
 current military pressure by the
 Communists.  While there are
 no indications of an imminent
 attack against any of the off-
 shore islands,                                                             the Communists

 Greeks to continue their "pas-
 sive resistance."  His refusal
 to comment on terrorist activi-
 ty will also probably encour-
 age the underground organization
 EOKA to intensify its efforts.
 Makarios apparently re-
 jected the final British offer
 because of suspicion that Britain
 intended to manipulate the later
 constitutional negotiations so
 as to deny the Greek population
 a proportionate majority in a
 Cypriot legislature.   Before
 the arrival of British colonial
 secretary Lennox-Boyd, Makarios
 had told the American consul
 in Nicosia that Harding's re-
 fusal to commit himself on that
 issue was the only remaining
 obstacle to agreement.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Makarios apparently inter-
 preted Lennox-Boyd's sudden
 trip to Cyprus as a sign of
 British weakness.   He probably
 renewed demands for an amnesty
 for political offenses and a
 time limit on the governor's
 control over public security
 as a means of exerting pressure
 for a concession on the propor-
 tional representation issue.
 Makarios probably expects
 that continuing pressures on
 the British will force the con-
 cessions he wants.  A Labor
 member of the British Parlia-
 ment who participated in the
 final phase of the negotiations
 has told,the'.-American .embassy
 in Athens that he sees no way
 of breaking the impasse'.   He
 questioned the wisdom of London's
 apparent attempt to convey con-
 flicting assurances to the Greek
 and Turkish communities on Cy-
 prus.   He asserted, and the
 British ambassador in Athens
 "rather ruefully" agreed, that
 in six months Britain would wish
 it had made concessions on the
 three unsettled points.
 In retaliation for British
 jamming of Athens radio on 6
 March,  the Greek government

 The declaration issued by
 the French and Moroccan govern-
 announced termination of re-
 lays of broadcasts of the Brit-
 ish Broadcasting Corporation.
 Athens also appears to be exert-
 ing diplomatic pressure on the
 British and on its other allies

 The Greeks apparently con-
 sider the "hidden veto" Turkey
 has exercised over the negotia-
 tions as the cause of their
 breakdown.   The Greek ambassa-
 dor in Belgrade was instructed
 to inform the Yugoslavs that
 'Greece would withdraw its agree-
 ment to an early meeting of the

 Turkey.   The Greek ambassador
 said that Turkish foreign minis-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 suspends the protectorate treaty
 signed at Fez in 1912 and is
 essentially a compromise per-
 mitting the current negotiations
 to proceed.   The Moroccans had
 demanded immediate abrogation of
 the 1912 treaty, while the
 French had insisted that the
 links of "interdependence" with
 France must be spelled out prior
 to abrogation.
 France now has agreed to
 Moroccan participation in
 Morocco's foreign affairs, de-
 fense and internal security.
 In general, however, the
 Moroccans will be confined to
 token representation.  A
 French Foreign Ministry spokes-
 man has told the American embassy
 in Paris that the French are
 following the same line the
 British have used successfully
 --that is,  "giving... everything
 on paper and hoping to retain
 substantial influence in fact."
 The spokesman added that France
 is relying heavily on the ex-
 cellent personal relations
 existing between the sultan and
 Andre Dubois, the former French
 resident general in Morocco who
 is now designated high commis-
 sioner.
 Negotiations to spell out
 French-Moroccan ties are expect-
 ed to be conducted simultaneous-
 ly in Rabat and Paris and may
 last until late summer.  The
 Moroccans fear the French may
 exploit the near. bankruptcy of
 Morocco's treasury to bind the
 country more closely to France
 than they desire.
 The French Foreign Minis-
 try spokesman also stated that
 France is anxious to see a Mo-
 roccan army created rapidly so
 that it can take over the major
 portion of operations in the
 Rif.  While composed of Moroc-
 can soldiers, the army would be
 commanded by a French general
 and rely on the French for ar-
 tillery support, all logistics,
 and special services.
 The spokesman also expect-
 ed that the sultan would soon
 make a strong statement calling
 on Moroccan rebels to lay down
 their arms.   In the past the
 sultan has resisted French pres-
 sures for a surrender call,
 partly to avoid the risk of
 having the call ignored, and
 partly to use the rebellion for
 :bargaining purposes.   He may
 now delay a surrender call until
 he is certain such a request
 would be obeyed.
 Both the declaration on.
 2 March and the return of the
 sultan to Rabat on'5 March re-
 sulted in popular demonstrations
 throughout Morocco acclaiming
 independence.   In Spanish Morocco,
 demonstrators clashed with the
 police and 19 Moroccans were
 killed and more than 150 in-
 jured.   Spain, whose position
 with regard to the joint dec-
 laration has been "reserved,"
 may now be subjected to increas-
 ing nationalist pressures for
 concessions in Spanish Morocco..

 solid progovernment slate was
 returned for the 123-seat Viet-
 namese constituent assembly
 summoned tc approve Diem's
 constitution.
 Realizing that the uni-
 fication elections, scheduled
 for July 1956,:will not be held
 and that there is no good pros-
 pect for overthrowing Diem by
 internal revolt;,  the Viet Minh
 is now calling for new inter-
 national negotiations and is
 preparing for a ,long-term sub-
 versive effort ;in South Viet-
 nam,           In conformity with cur-
 rent international Communist
 strategy,  the Viet Minh does
 not appear to contemplate the
 use of its superior military
 forces.
 Initially the Viet Minh
 appears to be considering
 supporting a neutralist South
 Vietnam government-in-exile
 under the leadership of Tran
 Van. Huu,  onetime French-
 controlled premier...
 Huu; hopes to
 set up a rival government for
 South Vietnam possibly based
 just north of the 17th parallel.
 While Huu has little or no
 support in the south,  his close
 contact with North Vietnam leaves
 little doubt that the Viet Minh
 is intimately acquainted with
 Huu's plans ands is very prob-
 ably supporting the movement.
 On the international scene,
 Communist efforts to obtain a
 new Geneva conference on Indo-
 china have been well co-ordinated,
 with Moscow and Hanoi endorsing
 Chou En-lai's call for such a
 conference.   Concurrently, Pol-
 ish members of the International
 Control Commission have stated
 the need for a new conference
 with the implied threat that
 "we cannot hold them (the Viet
 Minh) back indefinitely."
 Communist policy makers
 probably feel that they have
 everything to gain and little
 to lose if they can maneuver
 the West into accepting a new
 conference.   Hanoi may hope for
 an agreement to increase economic
 and political relations between
 north and south,  and perhaps
 even to commit the Diem govern-
 ment to a definite election
 schedule for all Vietnam.
 In South Vietnam, the
 constituent assembly is ex-
 pected to convene shortly and.
 will undoubtedly approve, within
 the specified 45-day limit, a
 draft constitution prepared
 under Diem's supervision.   The
 draft constitution reportedly
 provides for a separation of
 powers,  with overriding author-
 ity vested in the presidency.
 The emphasis placed on impeding
 Viet Minh efforts to subvert
 the young republic is indicated
 in a provision of the assembly
 election ordinances waiving

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUM'KARY
 Singapore
 Singapore's Chief Minis-
 ter David Marshall is preparing
 to go to London late in April
 for talks on self-government.
 He does so in an atmosphere
 of diminishing British con-
 fidence in Singapore's readi-
 ness for self-rule.   In view
 of steadily increasing Com-
 munist subversion in the
 colony, British officials are
 concerned over the absence of
 a strong non-Communist party or
 a. competent non-Communist local
 leader in whose hands the new
 powers could be safely en-
 trusted.   Obstruction of the
 movement toward independence,
 on the other hand, would pro-
 vide the Communists with polit-
 ical capital.
 Marshall, who is strongly
 anti-Communist, has not been
 an effective chief minister.
 His health is poor and he lacks
 a strong political organiza-
 tion.   His party, the Labor
 Front, was hastily organized
 in 1954 to contest the April
 1955 elections.   It is now
 unsuccessfully competing for
 support among the same popula-
 tion groups which are being ex-
 ploited by Singapore's best
 organized and most rapidly
 growing party--the Communist-
 manipulated People's Action
 Party.   In the Singapore Legis-
 lative Assembly, opposition
 strength--of which the People's
 Action Party is a part--equals
 that of the government.
 Marshall ansi other Labor
 Front leaders have considered
 expanding the present coalition
 government, which also includes
 the Alliance, a Malay-Chinese
 political organization which
 has little strength in Singa-
 pore.   The Labor Front has ex-
 plored co-operation with a. newly
 organized Chinese party, the
 Liberal Socialist Party, and
 with the so-called "right wing"
 of the People's Action Party.
 Both of these groups, however,
 appear increasingly dis-
 inclined to enter the govern-
 ment before the London talks.
 Should Marshall be unseated
 after the talks, his pros-
 pective successors appear
 less likely to provide vigor-
 ous anti-Communist leadership
 than he.
 Although plans are con-
 tinuing to hold the self-govern-
 ment talks in April as scheduled,
 tentative alternative schemes
 are being explored.  The prin-
 cipal one is' the admission of
 Singapore as the twelfth state
 in the Federation of Malaya,
 where the government is much
 stronger and where Communist
 subversion has not developed
 to the extent it has in Singa-
 pore.  Marshall claims that
 such a course would be politi-
 cally unpalatable to Singapore.
 He prefers a form of political
 combination which the two gov-
 ernments would enter on equal
 terms.
 This suggestion, how-
 ever, has already been re-
 jected by Malaya's Chief
 Minister Rahman.   Rahman is re-
 luctant to get involved in Singa-
 pore's intricate political prob-
 lems on any basis and partic-
 ularly dislikes the prospedt
 of the accession of Singapore's
 large Chinese population.            25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Indonesia
 President%Sukarno has asked
 ex-prime minister All Sastro-
 amidjojo to be`the formateur
 of a new Indonesian cabinet.
 Chances that Sastroamidjojo will
 succeed are slim and Sukarno may
 have to appoinlY one or more
 other formate0s.   Sukarno would
 like to have the cabinet formed
 by 26 March, when the elected
 parliament is to be installed.
 The Harahap cabinet, which re-
 signed on 3 March, is continu-
 ing in office as a caretaker
 government andthe old parlia-
 ment has recessed pending for-
 mal dismissal on 25 March.
 Cabinet negotiations will
 revolve around. 'the National
 Party (PNI) and the Nahdlatual
 Ulama  (NU).   WIether these par-
 ties will turn 'to the moderate,
 anti-Communist:Masjumi, also
 a major party,to give their
 government stability in the par-
 liament is the principal ques-
 tion which the negotiations will
 decide.
 Editorials in NU-.influenced
 papers state.that resignation
 of the Masjumi;led cabinet has
 ."kept the door open" for.co-
 operation with,the Masjumi...
 Masjumi chairman Natsir, how-
 ever, has said he does:notbe-
 lieve the PNI?-NU "team" would.
 accept his.part.y in the cabinet
 as an "equal"..and that he re-
 jects any other ,terms.   Other
 reports, however, state that
 Vice Chairman Sukiman and not
 Natsir will speak for the Mas-
 jumi, and that his more flexible
 attitudes and greater political
 skill may open the way for Mas-
 jumi participation on satis-
 factory terms.
 Should efforts toward a
 tripartite coalition fail, the
 PNI and NU will turn to the 22
 small parties which account for
 21 percent of the membership
 of the new Indonesian parliament.
 A coalition including the NU
 and numerous small parties would
 lend itself to largely unre-
 strained direction by the Na-
 tional Party and President Su-
 karno, and would have the support
 of the Communist Party.
 In any event., Indonesian
 policy probably will be more
 strongly nationalistic than at
 any time. heretofore.   The plu-
 rality of the National Party in
 the September and December elec-
 tions has been interpreted by
 all parties as an endorsement
 of a nationalistic approach to
 Indonesia's problems.
 Probably scheduled to re-
 ceive early and continued atten-
 tion is-;the country's claim to   25X1
 Netherlands New Guinea (West
 Irian).
 Soviet officials in the UN
 have approached their Australian
 colleagues three times since
 November with Tronosals that
 Australia take the initiative
 publicly in re-establishing re-
 lations with the USSR, which
 were suspended in April 1954

 The conversations have made
 little progress because of So-
 viet insistence that Australia
 make the first public approach
 and also guarantee diplomatic
 protection for the Soviet em-
 bassy and its personnel.  Aus-
 tralia   has countered with the
 proposal that both sides simul-

 notes to avoid appearance of
 initiative from either side.
 The USSR will probably
 modify its present position
 eventually to achieve normaliza-
 tion of relations.   Australia
 is one of the few countries
 still untouched by the post-
 Stalin Soviet policy of expand-
 ing relations with non-Communist
 countries.
 The presence of Soviet
 diplomatic representatives in
 Australia would facilitate
 establishment of support facil-
 ities for the Soviet Antarctic
 expedition and participation
 of Soviet athletes in the sum-
 mer Olympics at Melbourne.
 A high official of the
 Australian Department of Ex-
 ternal Affairs has expressed
 the opinion that both embas-
 sies will be restaffed and
 relations resumed at the latest
 prior to the opening   of the
 Olympics in November.   He
 thought that the Petrov  revela-
 tions would work against re-
 sumption of Soviet expionage
 activity.
 South Korean Liberal Party
 Nominations
 President Rhee's refusal
 to be renominated on the Liberal
 Party ticket has served to re-
 mind Liberal politicians of
 their dependence on Rhee, and
 sets the stage for his renomina-
 tion by popular acclaim.   Rhee
 has stated that while he does
 not consider himself "incapable
 of working for the country," the
 Liberal Party should ''wait:-and
 listen" for the voice of the
 people.
 The nomination of Liberal
 Party chairman Yi Ki-pung for
 vice president reflects his
 continued domination of the
 party organization and the pre-
 vailing view that his candidacy
 is acceptable to President Rhee.
 Election to the vice presidency
 would make Yi the likely succes-
 sor to the 80-year-old Rhee;
 however, his prospects might be
 jeopardized should Rhee fail to
 endorse him or if Rhee should
 run independently.   A member of
 the opposition Democratic Party
 has predicted that Rhee will
 encourage several vice-presi-
 dential condidates without sup-
 porting any one.
 Reports that Rhee desires
 an overwhelming vote of confi-
 dence in the election suggest
 that he will take advantage of
 the support of the Liberal Par?-
 ty organization.   However, mem-
 ories of the 1952 campaign.,  in
 which Rhee at the eleventh hour
 successfully shifted his support
 from the Liberal Party vice-pres-
 idential   nominee to the present
 incumbent, Ham Tae-yang, will
 encourage Yi's opponents and
 possibly stimulate independent
 campaigns for the vice presi-
 dency.

 The rapid initiation of

 Opposition to Rakkosi in Hungary
 Hungarian party leader
 Rakosi, who has been having dif-
 ficulty for some time in con-
 trolling nationalist elements
 among the Hungarian Communists,
 probably faces new threats.to
 his position.
 Rakosi has apparently
 depended mainly on Moscow's sup-

 power since his ouster of the
 more moderate Communist leader,
 ex-premier Nagy, a. year ago.
 The leaders of Rakosi's opposi-

 different path to socialism
 than that followed by the USSR.
 They are also encouraged
 by reports that an official
 revision of the findings of the
 1948 trial of Laszlo Rajk, who
 was executed on charges of
 nationalist deviation and con-
 spiracy with Tito,  is under
 study both in Moscow and
 Budapest.
 A reversal of the Rajk
 verdict would stimulate Rakosi's
 opponents to greater efforts.
 Rakosi probably will not be
 directly implicated in any re-
 vision of the official version
 of the Rajk trial,  since the
 blame can be laid on conven-
 ient scapegoats such as ex-
 police chief Gabor Peter and
 former politburo member Mihaly
 Farkas.  Nevert:heles.s,,.RakosVs

 as a withdrawal of Soviet sup-

 freer expression of their con-

 local autonomy in working out
 Hungarian policy.
 Moscow may in fact even-
 tually decide to sacrifice
 Rakosi, particularly if he is
 unable to overcome the'serious
 factionalism within his party.
 His removal from the Hungarian
 scene would add to the general
 persuasiveness of the ideologi-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY

 PART III
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 SOVIET POSITION ON DISARMAMENT
 The line the Soviet dele-
 gate to the UN Disarmament Sub-
 committee will probably take
 when it reconvenes in London
 on 19 March was indicated in
 speeches by the top Soviet
 leaders at the recent party
 congress in Moscow.  The Soviet
 leaders regard their disarma-
 ment policy, not a,s an end in
 itself but rather as a power-
 ful political instrument to
 be manipulated in the pursuit
 of broader foreign policy ob-
 jectives.
 Soviet Position at London
 The Soviet representative
 in the forthcoming London talks
 will probably press the Western
 powers to take the preliminary
 steps proposed by Khrushchev
 in his report to the party con-
 gress.   Khrushchev suggested
 that agreement on the "more
 intricate aspects of disarma-
 ment" would be facilitated if
 the nations would (1) discon-
 tinue thermonuclear weapons
 tests;  (2) prohibit possession
 of atomic weapons by forces
 stationed in Germany; and (3)
 reduce military budgets.  This
 simple three-point interim
 program is another example of
 the USSR adopting elements of
 proposals previously advanced
 by non-Communist spokesmen.
 Nuclear Weapons Tests
 The proposal to discontinue
 thermonuclear tests is the first
 Soviet suggestion that this
 measure could be adopted outside
 of a, general disarmament agree-
 ment.            It will establish a
 basis for later Soviet denuncia-
 tion of the series of American
 nuclear tests in the Pacific
 beginning late in April and of
 Britain's initial. hydrogen bomb
 test later this year.
 Since Khrushchev's speech)
 the Soviet delegate on the UN
 Trusteeship Council has been
 pressing the council to halt
 further tests in trust terri-
 tories.   Although the Soviet
 delegate did not insist on a
 vote on th s issue, India's
 Khrishna Menon used the occa-
 sion to warn that if the
 United States proceeded with
 the tests in the Marshall
 Islands, India would demand
 that the International Court
 of Justice be asked to rule
 on the legality of nuclear
 tests in trust territories.
 The Soviet leaders also
 expect that the proposed ban
 on hydrogen tests will have a.
 strong appeal in Western Europe.
 Moscow probably expects that
 the French delegate, Jules
 Moch, will be prepared to move
 further and faster than his
 Western colleagues toward pro-
 moting a. synthesis between the
 Soviet and Western positions.
 Molotov, in his party congress
 speech, noted that Premier
 Mollet had expressed a special
 interest in the disarmament
 problem and promised that the
 USSR would strive, "together
 with France, to achieve certain
 progress in the solution of this
 problem."
 Moscow may also anticipate
 that a nuclear test ban proposal
 would place the Eden government
 in an embarrassing position with
 British public opinion and the
 Labor Party, which has been press-
 ing   the government to seek
 agreement on limiting or pro-
 hibiting further tests.
 Atomic Weapons in Germany

 prohibition of possession of
 atomic weapons by troops

 stationed in Germany--was first
 put forward in the Prague dec-
 laration  of the Warsaw pact
 meeting on 28 January.   At that
 time it was coupled with a
 modified version of Eden's sum-
 mit conference plan, which
 called for the creation of a.
 semidemilitarized zone in
 Europe,  incorporating both
 East and West Germany, in which
 opposing forces would be limited
 and controlled.
 M litary Budgets
 The third point--reduc-
 tions in military budgets--was
 apparently intended as a cau-
 tious endorsement of former
 French premier Fa.ure's proposal
 at the summit conference.
 Recent Soviet statements
 have provided no hints that
 there will be any shift in
 Moscow's position on the car-
 dinal problem of inspection and
 control.   The Soviet delegate
 probably will continue to stress
 the importance of the conces-
 sions 'to the Western position
 embodied in the plan his govern-
 ment presented on 10 May 1955
 and to insist that the sub-
 committee should reach agree-
 ment on force levels and the
 timing of the prohibition on
 the use of nuclear weapons as
 the first step toward final
 agreement.
 The Russians still appear
 confident that the plan they
 advanced on 10 May has given
 them a. strong advantage over
 the Western powers and that
 they ca.n maintain it indef-
 initely.   The Soviet dele-
 gate may introduce amendments
 ostensibly designed to widen
 the possible area of agreement
 with the West.  For example,
 he may announce that the USSR
 is not irrevocably committed to
 the .:orce levels in the Soviet
 draft, and would be willing
 to discuss modifications as
 long as the West accepts the
 principle of fixed reductions
 as an integral part of a general
 disarmament treaty which would
 require a complete prohibition
 of nuclear weapons.
 The Soviet delegate may
 also suggest that rockets and
 missiles be prohibited along
 with nuclear weapons.   Premier
 Bulganin told the Supreme Soviet
 on 29 December that the USSR
 favors outlawing "atomic and
 hydrogen weapons and other
 types of weapons for wars of
 annihilation, including rocket
 missiles which have been de-
 veloped particularly over the
 past five years and... are
 becoming intercontinental
 weapons."
 As always, Soviet disarma-
 ment policy is shaped to serve
 broader political objectives.
 For many years after World
 rrd.r II, Moscow relied on the
 simple demand for immediate pro-
 hibition of atomic weapons and
 a one-third reduction in armed
 forces and armaments.   The
 first major shift in this
 policy came in September 1954,
 three months after France and
 Britain had outlined a new
 phased disarmament program
 .which departed significantly
 from past Western positions.
 The USSR's acceptance of
 this program as a, basis for a,
 disarmament convention, an-
 nounced by Vyshinsky in the UN
 General Assembly on 30 September
 1954, was clearly timed to coin-
 cide with the crucial meeting
 of the Western foreign min-
 isters in London to devise a,
 substitute to the EDC plan for
 rearming West Germany, which
 had been defeated by the French
 assembly a month earlier.
 This shift   was aimed
 directly at the French in the
 hope that they would postpone
 any action toward German re-
 armament until they had ex-
 plored the new Soviet dis-
 armament position.  The USSR
 at that time accepted the

 and, for the first time, agreed
 that reductions of conventional
 armaments should be initiated
 prior to an unconditional re-
 nunciation of the use of nuclear
 weapons.
 The next major Soviet dis-
 armament plan was placed before
 the UN Disarmament Subcommittee
 meeting in London on 100Ma.y 1955,
 five days after the final ra.ti-
 fication of the Paris agreements
 and West Germany's entry into
 NATO.   It was a vital component
 of the new Soviet diplomatic
 offensive launched last spring.
 THE COMMUNIST PARTIES
 The new Eulganin- Xhrushchev
 foreign policy over the past
 year seems to have been of little
 help to the political fortunes
 of the Communist parties of
 Western Europe.   In most coun-
 tries the influence of tl a par-
 ties has remained about the same
 or slightly declined.   Where
 they have gained it has been
 largely the result of indigenous
 developments.
 Communist capabilities
 continue to vary widely from
 country to country in Europe.
 Communism remains a major polit-

 Moscow then accepted the max-
 imum levels for conventional
 forces and the timing of the
 ba.n on the use of nuclear
 weapons proposed by the Western
 powers on 8 March 1955.
 The timing of Soviet dis-
 armament moves suggests that
 the Soviet leaders are less
 interested in a formal enforce-
 able disarmament agreement with
 the West than in manipulating
 world opinion in such a way as
 to cause the curtailment of
 Western military spending, the
 reduction of armed forces, and
 the weakening of NATO.
 politically isolated, a minor
 force in the councils of labor,
 and. an instrument of question-

 During most of the past year,
 the Communists in Western Europe
 have sought to align themselves
 with the democratic left.   In
 doing so,  they have acknowledged
 the vitality of the anti-Commu-
 nist opposition in most of these
 countries and their own liability
 derived-from Soviet aggressive-
 ness during the Stalinist period.
 Communist adjustment to the
 concept of an East-West detente

 digenous problem.  As adjuncts
 of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union, the European Com-
 munists appear to have been able
 to produce only limited support
 for the foreign policy goals of
 the Soviet Union and to gain
 only limited benefits from shifts
 in Soviet policy, even when these
 were in the direction of modera-
 tion.
 In those countries where
 the economic and social griev-
 ances of the people were exten-
 sive, the Communist menace re-
 mained a serious one.   Where
 a vigorous and responsible non-
 Communist political leadership
 directed its efforts to redress
 these grievances, the Communist
 menace was weakened.
 During 1955, the French
 Communists stressed two major
 themes:   that the progressive
 "pauperization of the working
 class" is the inevitable result
 of a capitalist society and that
 unity of action on the left is
 the best way to a."popular
 front," eventually to be led by
 the Communists.
 In both cases, the Commu-
 nists were seeking broad left-
 ist support to strengthen their
 position in the 1956 elections
 and to remove their party (PCF)
 from its isolation in the Nation-
 al Assembly and establish it as
 the champion of the French work-
 ing class.
 Although the "unity of
 action" theme had been stressed
 intermittently for some time,
 especially on the labor front,
 concentration on its political
 aspects came with Thorez' call
 in May 1955 for a renewal of
 "class war."  The Communist-led
 General Labor Confederation (CGT)
 subsequently embarked on a broad,
 militant strike program, the
 early successes of which netted
 the PCF renewed prestige.   This
 prestige was considerably dissi-
 pated, however, when in September
 the CGT rejected the generous con-
 cessions offered by the Renault
 management which were later ac-
 cepted by non-Communist labor
 elements.
 As the national elections
 approached,  Thorez stepped up
 his drive to increase the

 respectability of the PCF as
 a political party.   This drive
 was aided when Premier Faure
 accepted Communist support in
 November In order to stay in
 power.   Moreover, although So-
 cialist leadership prevailed,
 nearly 40 percent of the dele-
 gates at the late November So-
 cialist congress voted in favor
 of electoral alliances with the
 Communists.
 Communist expectations of
 gaining parliamentary seats
 from the split among the center
 parties were borne out by the
 election results.   The party
 suffered only a fractional de-
 cline in its share of the total
 vote and its appeal as the in-
 strument of revolutionary change
 apparently remained intact.
 Having achieved an assembly
 representation roughly commen-
 surate with their electoral vote,
 the Communists are now in a
 strong position.   So long as
 the center remains divided, Com-
 munist support of Mollet's Re-
 publican Front government allows
 the PCF to claim the de facto
 existence of a "popular front."
 At the same time,  the party can
 press the Socialists, who vie
 for working-class support with
 the PCF,  to undertake reforms
 which would split the Republican
 Front.
 Mollet has so far been
 little dependent on Communist
 votes because his economic
 measures have been too moderate
 to arouse widespread right-center
 opposition; but the Communists
 will probably try to force his
 hand by demanding broad wage
 hikes and more liberal social
 security payments.
 Italy.
 In Italy, where 143 Com-
 munist deputies and their 75
 Nenni Socialist allies comprise
 one third of the lower house of
 parliament, the Communist Party
 (PCI) has been unable to block
 important government measures,
 and its prestige declined dur-
 ing 1955.   In the midyear
 regional elections in Sicily,
 Communist votes were fewer than
 in the general elections in
 1953.   Communist domination of
 Italian labor also weakened
 in 1955, with Communist-affili-
 ated unions suffering losses
 averaging about 12 percent in
 the shop-steward elections.
 In many plants, notably
 the Fiat works, the Communists
 lost their majority, and de-
 fections from Communist-contlled
 unions were more frequent.
 The decline in Communist
 fortunes revived dissension
 within the Communist hierarchy.
 In January, Vice Secretary
 Pietro Secchia, a leading ad-
 vocate of a more militant policy,
 was demoted.   Recently, there
 have.been new reports of P "bit-
 ter struggle" within the PCi
 and the Communist-dominated
 General Confederation of Labor,
 whose secretary general has long
 been considered "lukewarm" toward
 exploiting the confederation for
 purely political purposes.
 Communist leaders have
 reacted to these problems with
 evident confusion.   Although
 the conciliatory policy long
 advocated by Togliatti continued
 to predominate in practice, the
 party also invoked the theme
 of class struggle, alleging that
 even in a period of international
 detente there was still a need
 to call for revolutions.   While
 asking for a broad alliance, Commu-
 nist leaders also attacked Chris-
 tian Democrat "reformists" for
 trying to beat the Communists
 on their own ground by pressing
 for speedy action on the govern-
 ment's Vanoni plan and other
 socio-economic reform programs.
 The Vanoni plan does in
 fact offer some threat of divid-
 ing the Communists from their
 Nenni Socialist allies, for
 Nenni's endorsement of the plan
 in principle suggests that it
 would be difficult for him to

 which in the long run might
 deprive the Communists of the
 support they derive from the
 economic grievances of the pop-
 ulation.
 West Germany and Austria
 The Communists were clearly
 on the defensive in West Germany
 and Austria, where the anti-Com-
 munist left is strong, the right
 is united under vigorous leaders,
 and there is a painful aware-
 ness of Soviet imperialism and
 the rigors of Soviet army occu-
 pation.
 In West Germany, Communist

 percent since the state treaty
 was signed last June.
 Circulation of the party
 press has also declined,  and
 in local and provincial elec-
 tions the Communist vote has
 dropped in some cases as much
 as 25 percent.   The party has
 been undergoing an internal re-
 organization,  and the Communist-
 front election alliance, the
 People's Opposition, has been
 dissolved.   Only Communist
 strength in the former Soviet-
 controlled enterprises in east-
 ern Austria gives the govern-
 ment any real concern.
 Iceland and Finland
 By exploiting xenophobia,
 the ineffectiveness of the non-
 Communist left,  and a precarious
 economic situation,  the Ice-
 landic Communists have been able
 attain a unique position it
 northern Europe.    The party is
 the third largest in the coun-
 try and,  with the help of the
 left-wing Social Democrats, it
 gained control of the Icelandic
 Federation of Labor (IFL) in
 November 1954.
 In the meantime, overt ac-
 tivities of the party were de-
 voted to propaganda support of
 the Communist line on German
 reunification and to a vigor-
 ous effort to 1.nr.rease Communist
 influence in German -'.abor.   The
 success of the Communists in
 fomenting strikes in Bremen and
 Hamburg and in electing an abso-
 lute majority to the works coun-
 cil of a large Ruhr steel plant
 in the fall spurred some unions
 to take direct action against
 Communist infiltration.   In
 later elections, in the Bremen
 and Flensburg shipyards, Commu-
 nist losses were severe.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 8 March 1956
 The Communists poll about
 20 percent of the popular vote,
 but this seems to reflect a
 good deal of protest as well
 as pro-Communist sentiment.
 They have been pushing hard for
 restoration of a common front
 with the Social Democrats and
 for representation in the govern-
 ment--proposals which are repeat-
 edly ignored.   In the meantime,
 the Social Democrats are making
 progress in their efforts to
 reduce the strong minority which
 the Communists still have in the
 trade union-movement.
 Other Countries
 In the other Scandinavian
 countries, Britain and the
 Benelux countries, the Communist
 parties are all politically iso-
 lated and reduced to hard-core
 elements which try to infiltrate
 the ranks of labor, slavishly
 propagandize "favorable" turns
 in Soviet foreign policy and
 have difficulty in maintaining
 their party press.
 Both in Denmark and Sweden,
 there have been frequent reports
 of dissension among Communist
 leaders.   The Swedish Communists
 have been unsuccessfully push-
 ing united front tactics since
 1953, even admitting the needs
 at a December party convention
 of a "reasonable" military pro-
 gram in Sweden.   Communist in-
 fluence in the unions is largely
 confined to the miners and forest
 workers in the north, construc-
 tion workers in Stockholm, and
 the ship and dockyard employees
 in Goteborg.
 In Norway, the Communists
 have had no success with united
 front tactics directed at the
 Labor Party,  and in the October
 local elections the Communists
 received about the same share of
 the popular vote as in the 1953
 national elections.
 The British Communist Party
 contested only 17 of the 630
 parliamentary seats at stake in
 the 26 May general elections and
 won none, polling a total vote
 little greater than the party's
 estimated membership.   Efforts
 to infiltrate the trade unions
 achieved their first noteworthy
 success in several years with
 the election last December of a
 Communist to the executive of
 the Amalgamated Engineering Union.
 Membership of the Belgian
 Communist Party has continued to
 decline,  and the only Communist-
 dominated labor union in Bel-
 gium, the Syndicat Unique, dis-
 integrated last fall.   Party
 membership in the Netherlands
 is stable at an estimated 40,000,
 and the Communist-controlled
 Unity Trade Union Central had
 no notable successes during 1955.
 The capabilities of the
 Swiss Communist Party, a negli-
 gible political force, remained
 stationary.   On the Iberian Penin-
 sula, Communist organizations are
 illegal, are under strict sur-
 veillance, and have virtually no
 potential for subversive action
 among the anti-Communist popu-
 lations.
 Prospects
 In recent months, the
 Soviet Union itself has seemed
 to give increased recognition
 to the problems faced by the
 parties of Western Europe in
 their efforts to give effective
 local representation to the for-
 eign policy objectives of the
 USSR and at the same time gain
 an effective voice in the forma-
 tion of national policies.
 The direct overtures the
 Soviet Union has made to seven
 of the thirteen Socialist par-
 ties of Western Europe since
 last fall seem intended both
 to encourage Socialist support
 for the foreign policy views
 of Moscow on a variety of issues
 and to overcome the suspicion
 with which the European Social-
 ists have greeted local Commu-
 nist appeals for common fronts
 and election alliances.   The
 doctrinal innovations proclaimed

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 at the 20th Party Congress of
 the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union--the attacks on
 Stalinism and the proclamation
 of a parliamentary route to Com-
 munism--were directed also to
 these ends.
 It is too early to deter-
 mine the effectiveness of these
 maneuvers, although in come cases,
 the direct overtures to the
 Socialist parties have already
 been spurned.   The attitude taken
 by the Council of the Socialist
 International at its 2-4 March
 meeting in Zurich suggests that
 many Western Socialists remain
 highly conscious of previous
 experience with united fronts
 both in their own countries and
 in Eastern. Europe immediately
 following the war.   Moreover,
 the Communists themselves have
 historically found it difficult
 to cope with the tactical prob-
 lems of participating in a par-
 liamentary system which they
 are dedicated to destroy.
 MAO TSE-TUNG AND THE COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLE
 Mao Tse-tung and other
 Chinese Communist leaders have
 regularly endorsed the principle
 of "collective leadership," but
 Mao for many years has personally
 led the Chinese Communist Party
 and has personally controlled
 its policy-in a way not very
 different from Stalin's domina-
 tion of the USSR.   Mao's per-
 sonal domination has been par-
 ticularly evident in the past
 year.   Nevertheless.Mao's pro-
 gram in China--that is, the Chi-
 nese  'application" of Marxist-
 Leninist doctrine--has continued
 to be warmly praised by Soviet
 leaders.   Moreover, Soviet par-
 ty leader Khrushchev's pragmat-
 ic approach to ideology suggests
 that he and Mao arc suited to
 work well with one another.
 The Chinese Communist Party
 has always been committed in
 theory to direction by party
 organizations rather than by a
 single leader.   In fact, however,
 the party's early years were
 marked by a series of struggles
 between individual leaders, with
 Mao and Mao's policies emerging
 triumphant in 1935, at which
 time Mao's program was given
 Soviet blessing.   Having risen
 to oower,much as Stalin did,
 Mao since 1935 has dominated
 his party much as Stalin con-
 trolled the Soviet party, al-
 though the Chinese leader has
 apparently relied more on per-
 suasion than on purges.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 8 March 1956
 Chinese Communist pronounce-
 ments endorsed the collective
 leadership principle, without
 great enthusiasm, during 1953
 and 1954, and in 1954 Peiping
 carried on a mild campaign for
 the principle during the "party
 unity" drive.   The reorganiza-
 tion of the government structure
 in the fall of 1954 indeed
 established the basis for a
 collective leadership in the
 government.  Nevertheless Chi-
 nese pronouncements and Chinese
 practice continued to reflect
 the fact of Mao's domination.
 Since mid-1955 Mao has
 publicly and emphatically as-
 serted his personal leadership
 of the Chinese Communist Party,
 and, through the party, his
 control of the government.   In
 this period Chinese Communist
 spokesmen have been eulogizing
 Mao in extreme terms much like
 those employed in 1953, when
 China was said to be entering
 "the. era of Mao Tse-tung."
 Special consideration  for Mao
 has continued despite the strong
 reaffirmation of collective
 leadership and denunciation of
 "the cult of personality" at
 the Soviet party congress last
 month.
 In July 1955 Mao personally
 reversed a moderate line on the
 collectivization of agriculture,
 affirmed by the Chinese Commu-
 nist Party central committee
 and approved by the National
 People's Congress only a few
 days before Mao spoke.   Mao,in
 calling for a rapid speed-up
 in agriculture,  not only did not
 follow the collective leadership
 principle in so acting, but
 seemed unconcerned about making
 all other party leaders look
 foolish on this issue.   Mao
 committed his own prestige so
 heavily as to suggest the
 possibility, for the first time,
 that a resounding failure of
 the line he had laid down
 might threaten his dominance
 of the party.
 Evidently unperturbed by
 this risk, Mao in November 1955
 exhorted the All-China Federa-
 tion of Industry and Commerce,
 meeting at his instance, to
 carry out a commensurate speed-
 up in the socialization of in-
 dustry.  The transformation of
 "capitalist" industry to joint
 state-private industry had
 moved only slowly in the 1949-
 1955 period.   Within two months
 of Mao's address, according to
 official pronouncements, private
 industry in major cities had
 been "transformed."
 In December 1955, Mao an-
 nounced flatly that the question
 of the tempo of socialization
 "has been settled," and in
 January 1956 he predicted that
 China's "socialist revolution"
 could be completed "in the main"
 in about three more years.
 Premier Chou En-lai, following
 up, said in January that "right-
 leaning conservatism" in regard
 to China's transition would be
 the "central question" for con-
 sideration by the Chinese
 Communist Party Congress later
 this year.
 "Peaceful" Transition
 Mao's theory that the
 transition in China will be
 "peaceful" in nature has been
 claimed by Peiping as another
 of Mao's "contributions" to
 Marxist-Leninist doctrine.   In
 view of the current speed of
 agricultural socialization,
 which may encounter substantial
 resistance, there is some ques-
 tion as to whether the theory
 fits the facts.   Nevertheless,
 a Peiping spokesman has recently
 asserted that the "peaceful"
 advance of Chinese capitalists
 to socialism is "something that
 has appeared for the first time
 in the world."

 Since Stalin's death, So-
 viet ideologists have at least
 in part accepted Chinese claims
 of Mao's eminence among living

 Communist greats by describing
 him as a "strong Marxist theo-
 retician" and his work as an
 "enrichment" of a  major "con-
 tribution" to Marxist theory--
 terms previously reserved for
 Lenin and Stalin.  The recent
 Soviet party congress in effect
 no-t4 need this practice,  by
 warmly praising Chinese "appli,-
 catioj,," of Marxist-Leninist doc-
 trine.   Soviet leaders,  how-
 ever, in line with their em-
 phasis on collective leadership,
 for the most part modified
 their praise of Mao by citing
 the Chinese Communist Party
 rather than Mao personally.
 Khrushchev in his report
 to the congress observed that
 the Chinese Communist Party,
 like other parties of the bloc,
 had demonstrated in its domestic
 program "creative Marxism in
 anti-on."  Similarly, party
 secretary D. Ti Shepilov paid
 tribute co the Cninese for a
 "masterly application" of
 Marxist doctrine.
 The Chinese Communists
 have not set themselves up as
 original theorists on any queE.-
 tion more ambitious than that
 of the applicability of doctrine
 to backward "semicolonial"
 areas, such as China.   They are
 evidently prepared to accept
 Khrushchev's revisions of Com-
 munist dogmas on the inevi-
 tability of war and the possi-
 bility of a peaceful "transition
 to socialism" in some countries.
 The Chinese Communist Party's
 official newspaper, People's
 Daily, has already endorsed
 rushchev's ideological points.
 Mao and Khrushchev
 While Khrushchev's newborn
 pretensions as a Communist theo-
 retician may in the long run
 tend to lessen Mao's eminence
 in the Communist world, Khrush-
 chev's approach to ideology
 suggests that he is the type of
 leader with whom Mao should be
 able to work very well for the
 time being.  A milestone in
 Khrushchev's rise to power in
 the USSR seems to have been his
 trip to Peiping with Bulganin
 and Mikoyan in the fall of 1954,
 and he has consistently sup-
 ported and endorsed Mao's
 program in China.
 The Soviet leader seems to
 resemble Mao strongly in his
 willingness to readjust dogma
 to fit the changing needs of
 basic strategy.   Moreover,
 both Khrushchev and Mao exhibit
 great self-confidence, a bold-
 ness of approach, a livelier
 literary style than is customary
 among Communists, and a willing-
 ness to engage  occasionally in
 undignified personal behavior.
 While nothing concrete is known
 of their personal relationship,
 such evidence as there is of
 the men and their policies sug-
 gests a cordial one.
 Mao is expected to retain
 his authority in shaping Chinese
 Communist policy while contin-
 uing to reduce his role in
 routine party and government
 affairs.  He will almost cer-
 tainly be re-elected, as the
 party's top leader at the 1956
 party congress.
 Mao's frequent absences
 from the public eye during 1955
 may be explained in part by a
 need for withdrawal to think
 and write on major policy matters.
 It also seems likely, as he is
 62 and reported suffering from.
 a variety of ailments, that he
 is actually incapacitated from
 time to time.   For example, in
 1954 he was "on holiday" for
 three months, missed a major
 party conference, and reappeared
 looking thinner.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 JAPANESE INTEREST IN PROMOTING AN INDEPENDENT TAIWAN
 Japanese leaders have long
 maintained that the creation
 of two Chinas offers the only
 feasible solution for the pres-
 ent impasse over the inter-
 national status of Taiwan and
 Communist China.   They are in-
 sistent that Taiwan must not
 fall into Communist hands.
 They fear this might occur sud-
 denly, because of a collapse
 of the Nationalist regime
 through demoralization or the
 death of Chiang Kai-shek.   This
 apprehension and the conviction
 the an independent Taiwan would
 be the most favorable solution
 for Japanese interests are be-
 hind the inclination of Japanese
 leaders to favor a Taiwan in-
 dependence movement.
 Beginning of Movement
 Embittered by the Chinese
 Nationalist takeover at the end
 of World War II and the Chiang
 regime's maladministration, the
 Taiwanese openly revolted in
 February 1947.  Many Taiwanese,
 including most intellectual and
 professional leaders, were
 killed, and the surviving lead-
 ers went abroad or underground
 to form an independence move-
 ment.  The presence in nearby
 Japan of more than 40,000 Over-
 seas Chinese--19,000 of Taiwanese
 origin--as well as mutual eco-
 nomic and strategic interests,
 inevitably involved Japan in
 the Taiwan problem and made it
 an appropriate headquarters for
 the Taiwan independence move-
 ment.
 Although the movement's
 leaders preferred Nationalist
 to Communist domination, they
 continued to work for independ-
 ence, and by 1950 several organ-
 izations sponsoring Taiwan auton-
 omy had been formed in Japan.
 Of these groups, the Taiwan
 Democratic Independence Party,
 led by Thomas Liao (LIAO Wen-i),
 has emerged as the principal
 promoter of Taiwan independence
 in Japan
 Japanese Doubt
 It was apparent as soon
 as it had regained its independ-
 ence that Japan questioned the
 durability of the Chinese
 Nationalist government and the
 value of establishing relations
 with it.   Some Japanese offi-
 cials alleged that American
 pressure compelled Tokyo to
 conclude a peace treaty with
 Taipei.  The foreign minister
 at that time, Okazaki, pub-
 licly stated that Japan recog-
 nized Nationalist sovereignty
 only over territory controlled
 by Taipei.
 By 1952 the growing
 strength of the Taiwan independ-
 ence movement led American offi-
 cials in Tokyo to expect unoffi-
 cial Japanese support for the
 movement, official aid being
 barred by Tokyo's political
 commitments to the Nationalists.
 Japan Seeks Solution
 Japan's desire for rela-
 tions with Communist China, the
 growing assertion of independ-
 ence from the United States,
 and the awareness of the po-
 tential danger to Japan of the
 explosive situation in the
 Taiwan Strait are among the
 factors prompting Tokyo to
 seek a solution of the Taipei-
 Peiping impasse.   Influential
 Japanese leaders have repeatedly
 sought to determine whether the
 recognition of two Chinas is to
 become American policy. They
 fear that both Washington and
 Tokyo will be caught short by
 an early collapse of the Chiang
 Kai-shek regime.
 A Foreign Ministry offi-
 cial asserted in mid-February
 that internal political dissen-
 sion and a, deterioriating inter-
 national position precluded the
 continuation of the present Na.-
 tiona.list leadership for more
 than two years.   In early December
 1955, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 suggested to Ambassador Allison
 that a plebiscite be held on
 Taiwan which the foreign minis-
 ter believed would clearly show
 that the islanders rejected
 Communist rule.   Shigemitsu
 stressed that the anticipated
 Taiwanese vote for autonomy
 would strengthen the free
 world's endeavor to prevent
 Taiwan from becoming Communist.
 Latest Moves
 Subsequent events empha-
 size the continued growth of
 Japanese interest in Taiwan
 independence.   The Foreign
 Ministry in mid-February appar-
 ently leaked a. background paper
 "Analysis of China" in an effort
 to ascertain Washington policy,
 to influence that policy toward
 relaxing strategic trade con-
 trols against the mainland,
 and to persuade the United
 States to support Taiwan auton-
 omy.
 The Japanese government
 has rejected Chinese Nationalist
 requests to restrict the activ-
 ities of the Taiwan Democratic
 Independence Party (TDIP).  On
 1 September 1955, the TDIP had
 inaugurated a Provisional Na-
 tional Congress of Taiwan and
 on 28 February 1956 had formea
 a "Democratic Taiwan Government."
 In each case,  the Japanese gov-
 ernment maintained there was
 no legal basis for it to take
 any action against the party.
 A Foreign Ministry official,
 did, however, call in its lead-
 er and told him "to take it
 easy."
 These actions and the
 recurrent approaches to Ameri-
 can representation by Japanese
 officials on the two Chinas
 problem and the status of Tai-
 wan suggest that the Japanese
 will continue to work for Tai-
 wan autonomy as the solution to
 this major Far East problem.
