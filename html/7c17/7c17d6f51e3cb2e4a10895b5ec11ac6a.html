 technical cooperation is progressing smoothly, while
 China's recent posting of a defense attache to Brasilia
 may set the stage for large-scale arms sales. We
 expect each country to continue efforts to expand ties,
 but obstacles will impede a deepening relationship,
 especially in technology transfer and military sales.
 Growing Mutuality of Interests
 Since the establishment of diplomatic relations
 between Brazil and China in 1975, bilateral relations
 have improved steadily. Press and US Embassy
 reports indicate that growing trade fostered the
 expansion of ties, especially after 1979 when China
 increased exports of crude oil and petroleum products
 to Brazil to help buffer Brasilia's import disruptions
 caused by the Iran-Iraq war. Subsequently, Sino-
 Brazilian political relations improved as well. F_~
 According to the US Embassy in Beijing, Brazil's
 relatively advanced level of technology and Beijing's
 interest in greater cooperation with other Third
 World countries made Brazil an especially valuable
 trade partner for China. Beijing views Brazil as an
 important developing country and an activist for
 Third World interests in international organizations.
 Chinese press reports stress that Brazil is a leader in
 Latin America, and may serve as an entree to the
 region. In particular, Beijing may hope that Latin
 American nations will use Sino-Brazilian relations as
 a model for their own relations with China.F__1
 Bilateral Relations Blossom
 According to trade statistics from the two countries,
 Sino-Brazilian bilateral trade amounted to more than
 $800 million in 1984. Brazil's favorable balance of
 trade grew to $45 million in 1984. As Beijing has
 initiated new infrastructure projects, Chinese imports
 of Brazilian iron and steel, which account for
 approximately 50 percent of Brazilian sales, have
 surged. China also has increased imports of plastics,
 textile fibers, and industrial equipment. Petroleum
 and petroleum products, particularly crude and partly
 refined oil, constitute over 95 percent of China's
 exports to Brazil. Indeed, Brazil bought almost 10
 percent of China's crude oil exports last year. F_
 Bilateral technical cooperation commenced in 1984
 with the signing of nuclear and scientific
 agreements-the culmination of Brazilian President's
 Figueredo's visit to China. Included was a Nuclear
 Cooperation Agreement for peaceful purposes,
 according to the respective Embassies. Although the

 Beijing's "Economic Diplomacy"
 In the past three months, China has increasingly
 emphasized its interest in expanding economic ties to
 the Third World as part of its drive to increase the
 foreign trade and investment that Beijing needs to
 finance its ambitious modernization program. For
 example, Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang told a
 conference of Chinese ambassadors in December 1984
 that diplomatic success will depend on the successful
 expansion of China's economic relations with foreign
 countries. Zhao added that such economic diplomacy
 would ultimately advance China's political
 objectives. We believe that this policy, implemented
 after the Communist Party Conference last
 September, may have been endorsed by the senior
 Chinese leadership during their meetings in August at
 Beidaihe.
 We believe that Deng Xiaoping and other reformers
 may be touting the prospect of large foreign trade
 agreements concluded under the rubric of "economic
 foreign policy" to deflect domestic criticism of the
 "open-door" policy. The Chinese have been using
 such a policy for some time to undermine Taiwan's
 position abroad, particularly in Latin America, and
 to put pressure on Taipei to negotiate-a goal on
 which all Chinese leaders agree.
 China has made a special effort to increase its
 economic and political ties to other Third World
 countries. We believe that declining world oil prices
 and increasing protectionism in the industrialized
 countries against Chinese textiles may be motivating
 Beijing to tap Third World markets to shore up
 Chinese exports. Beijing also seeks to enter into joint
 ventures, probably to increase China's foreign
 currency earnings and gain access to high technology
 more cheaply. 0
 accord does not commit either party to purchase
 nuclear services and technology, it requires that
 international safeguards be applied to all sales.
 Under a Science and Technology Agreement, a
 Chinese delegation from the Ministry of Aeronautics
 visited Brazilian facilities for advanced aeronautics
 research in August 1984.
 the Chinese expressed
 interest in Brazilian satellite design, fabrication, and
 propulsion systems. Soon after, Brazilians toured
 several sensitive Chinese installations that reportedly
 had not previously been shown to foreigners.
 the two governments
 then prepared drafts of a space cooperation annex to
 the Science and Technology Agreement. The drafts
 call for Sino-Brazilian cooperation in satellite attitude
 control and power supply, image processing, and
 improving telemetry and ground command systems.
 China and Brazil indicated in 1984 that they would
 exchange military attaches,
 he agreement probably stemmed
 from Brazes interest in selling military equipment to
 China. Although the actual agreement was not
 announced until last year, this is the first time Brazil
 has allowed such an exchange with a Communist
 country, a harbinger of further deepening ties.
 Closer Ties Last Year
 In 1985, Sino-Brazilian relations expanded in several
 new directions. As part of its worldwide drive to
 reduce imports of finished products and bolster
 Chinese technical capabilities, Beijing began
 negotiations for the acquisition of Brazilian
 technology. Embassy and press sources report Chinese
 interest in technical plans and processes related to
 transportation, offshore oil exploration, hydroelectric
 power, and the steel industry. According to
 Beijing may also be interested in military
 technology, particularly for the manufacture of light
 aircraft.
 China is also planning to use Brazilian construction
 companies on major civil projects. For example,
 Beijing approved Brazilian participation in China's
 port reform project, designed to open Chinese ports to
 supertankers. Brazilian firms would like to participate
 in construction of the proposed 14-million-kW
 capacity Three Gorges hydroelectric dam on the
 - Yangtse River.

 Secret
 Both countries continued to express interest in
 cooperation in the nuclear field, but reached no
 specific agreements. Nonetheless, the Brazilians were
 attempting to join forces with the West German firm
 Kraftwerk Union AG (KWU) to land a nuclear power
 reactor construction project in China.
 China, which has scaled
 back plans for nuclear power, has recently postponed
 this project indefinitely.
 In space cooperation,
 Brazil's Sonda IV rocket, which has been
 test-flown twice, is currently too inaccurate to be used
 as a weapon.                           China is
 interested in acquiring Brazilian solid-fuel
 technology, and hope to arrange an exchange in these
 areas. Nonetheless,
 negotiations, which have
 not yet begun in earnest, are likely to be difficult.
 Zhao's Visit
 To cement these new ties, Zhao Ziyang spent five
 days in Brazil last November, as part of a 16-day trip
 that also included Argentina, Colombia, and
 Venezuela. US Embassy and Brazilian press sources
 indicate that he received red-carpet treatment during
 the visit-including a meeting at the airport with
 Sarney, an honor normally reserved for heads of state.
 During the visit, Zhao signed new protocols on
 cooperation in geological sciences and other technical
 areas, as well as an agreement for cultural and
 educational exchanges. Moreover, Zhao and Sarney
 also agreed to annual Foreign Ministry discussions on
 the international situation as well as bilateral
 relations. Zhao sounded the only cautionary note by
 expressing Chinese concern over Brazil's growing
 trade surplus with Beijing, which sur ed to $245
 million in the first half of 1985.
 According to press reports, Sarney and Zhao privately
 discussed a large sale of Brazilian military equipment
 to China. The Chinese, according to these accounts,
 industries for Chinese defense officials.
 presented a very ambitious shopping list, indicating an
 interest in acquiring 3,200 armored vehicles and
 tanks; 500 Tucano military trainers; AMX attack
 planes; and various types of communications
 hardware, military computers, and radios. In an effort
 to realize some of these sales, which could total more
 than $3 billion, China's newly accredited attache will
 probably arrange tours of Brazilian military
 bilateral ties.
 Outlook
 Sino-Brazilian bilateral cooperation is proceeding
 smoothly, with no signs of flagging interest from
 either side. We expect each country to continue
 efforts to expand trade and technical cooperation.
 Nonetheless, important obstacles will plague the
 overall relationship, and may delay the deepening of
 For trade to expand to the $1.2 billion level planned
 for this year, while accommodating China's desire to
 reduce Brasilia's burgeoning trade surplus with
 Beijing, Brazil would need to increase imports from
 China. On the basis of an analysis of Brazil's current
 import requirements, we judge the Chinese will
 encounter difficulty increasing their export sales to
 offset large new purchases of Brazilian raw materials
 and manufactured products. Moreover, a likely
 decline in Chinese oil revenues and textile exports
 worldwide will probably lead Beijing to press Brasilia
 to arrange new countertrade agreements to conserve
 hard currency. For example, China probably will
 press Brazil to accept more oil to balance trade. We
 believe Brazil's preference for cash will complicate
 the negotiations to arrive at mutually acceptable
 terms of trade for long-lived contracts, and will work
 to slow the growth of trade between the countries.
 We believe the negotiations for military sales are
 likely to be a slow, arduous process. Although periodic
 agreements for small purchases are likely to be
 announced, we doubt that a major agreement will be
 concluded this year. Among the problems that could
 stand in the way are:
 ? Brazil's difficulty in providing financing for any
 large-scale purchases of arms.

 ? COCOM regulations that require clearance from
 member countries to sell their components, some of
 which are in Brazilian military products.
 ? Brazilian defense industries' possible reluctance to
 transfer technology for proprietary products to
 protect their competitive position.
 Beijing will probably require Brazilian companies to
 transfer technology with licenses to allow
 coproduction as a requirement for military equipment
 sales. This demand could impede sales. Although
 Brazil has licensed the production of Tucano aircraft
 to a British firm in Northern Ireland, manufacturers
 may hesitate in Beijing's case . We believe China's
 lower labor and manufacturing costs could raise fears
 that Beijing would undercut Brazil as a manufacturer
 of ostensibly Brazilian products. Moreover, in our
 view, the license fees paid to Brazilian manufacturers
 probably would not fully compensate for their
 potential loss of markets.
 We believe that scientific exchanges will probably
 increase in nonsensitive areas, such as food irradiation
 using nuclear isotopes. We judge the prospects of a
 large commercial sale to China of Brazilian nuclear
 power components or of Chinese assistance in the
 sensitive areas of reprocessing or uranium enrichment
 technology are low. Despite denials by Brazilian and
 Chinese officials, reports of space cooperation
 continue to appear periodically in the Brazilian press.

 Mexico: Chihuahua Prepares
 for Elections
 Mexico will hold elections this year for governor in 13
 states. Of these, the race in the northern border state
 of Chihuahua is likely to be the most hotly contested
 and to receive the most publicity in the Mexican and
 US press. Although the conservative National Action
 Party (PAN) commands considerable support and has
 nominated a popular candidate, we expect the ruling
 Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to retain
 control of the statehouse. The PRI is also likely to
 recapture some of the state deputy positions and
 mayoralties PAN won in elections three years ago.
 We believe localized violence will erupt this year, as it
 did last year elsewhere in the country
 was forced to go on extended leave, an act tantamount
 to resigning, last September. He was under attack in
 his own party for an alleged lack of leadership and for
 allowing the PAN to make unprecedented electoral
 gains.F_~
 The Candidates
 The PRI and the PAN, the two major parties
 contesting the Chihuahua elections, formally
 announced their gubernatorial candidates in January.
 Each party selected men who are respected natives of
 the state and are likely to wage strong campaigns,
 according to the Embassy. ~
 The Coming Elections
 In addition to the 13 governorships, 230 state deputy
 posts and 1,158 mayoralties will be at stake
 nationwide.'
 however, the government views the Chihuahua races,
 to be held on 6 July, as the most potentially
 troublesome. Perhaps for this reason, Chihuahua was
 among the first states in which the PRI named a
 gubernatorial candidate this year. PAN currently
 controls seven of Chihuahua's largest cities,
 containing over 70 percent of the state's population,
 including Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua City, the
 capital. Moreover, PAN made its strongest showing in
 Chihuahua during midterm congressional elections
 last July. It was declared the winner in three of the
 state's 10 congressional districts and would have won
 at least one more had election officials acted
 impartially, according to the US Embassy.
 The PRI also cannot take the elections lightly in view
 of factional infighting that in recent years has left the
 ruling party in the state in considerable disarray.

 image of a man of the people. Barrio is also politically

 The PRI candidate, Fernando Baeza Melendez, 44, is
 widely respected in the state as an effective
 administrator and an accomplished politician, the
 Embassy reports. Baeza is now serving as a Federal
 Deputy representing a constituency in northern
 Chihuahua. He previously held the post of Deputy
 Federal Attorney General in Mexico City, where he
 established close ties to a number of government and
 ruling party officials. He also was formerly the mayor
 of Delicias, Chihuahua, his hometown.
 Baeza is regarded as a moderate within the PRI,
 according to the Embassy. The fact that he was once
 a member of the PAN should make him more broadly

 acceptable to many middle-class Chihuahuans and to
 the state's business community, from which the PAN
 derives much of its support. On the other hand,
 organized labor, in view of Baeza's conservative bent,
 only reluctantly endorsed his candidacy, according to
 the US Embassy. Rural Chihuahuans, for their part,
 have strongly supported the PRI in the past and are
 likely to favor Baeza by a wide margin, despite
 dissatisfaction with producer prices set by the
 government that in recent months have led to protests
 in several areas of the state.)
 Election Tactics
 The PRI will use its patronage powers and pork-barrel
 projects to good advantage in its Chihuahua
 campaign.
 the ruling party is prepared to spend
 heavily to ensure an impressive victory. We expect the
 government to devote fewer resources to funding PRI
 campaigns in other states with gubernatorial elections
 in 1986, particularly in view of Mexico City's
 exaggerated promises to cut this year's budget deficit.
 Baeza and other PRI candidates in Chihuahua will
 also benefit from the ruling party's control over
 electoral machinery. To improve its electoral
 prospects in Chihuahua, the PRI-controlled state
 administration late last year amended election laws.
 PAN officials assert, probably with reason, that the
 controversial changes will make it easier for the PRI
 to practice fraud. Among the new provisions are ones
 that restrict the access of poll watchers and give
 officials in each precinct greater discretion in deciding
 Diccionario Biografico del
 Gobierno Mexicano
 whether voters without identification can cast ballots.
 In case such tactics fail, however, the government
 recently deployed a 900-man Army unit to the state to
 maintain order during the election period
 The PAN, for its part, is likely to campaign hard,
 particularly in urban areas of the state. The party will
 devote fewer resources to rural areas, where
 historically it has not made a strone showing.
 much of its
 support is likely to come from the business community
 and clergy. Business will provide the main source of
 campaign funds for the PAN, which, unlike other
 major political parties, does not accept government
 subsidies. Reflecting a trend toward greater church
 involvement in politics, the Bishop of Ciudad Juarez,
 Manuel Talamas Camandari, recently was among
 those publicly critical of the changes in the state's
 election laws.
 At the state level, PAN will seek to capitalize on the
 popularity of Barrio, who is well known throughout
 the state. It probably will also seek to exploit
 discontent with the PRI's management of the
 economy and the limited accomplishments of the
 Ornelas administration. In addition, the PAN may
 publicize allegations of several other opposition
 parties that Baeza did little to combat corruption and
 drug trafficking while a top official in the Attorney

 Outlook
 The PRI, which has not lost a governorship since it
 was founded in 1929, will not cede the Chihuahua
 statehouse in 1986, in our judgment. Even if Barrio
 and the PAN captured a plurality of the votes cast, we
 believe it highly unlikely that the government and
 ruling party would recognize the results. As the
 Embassy has noted, whether the PAN triumphs will
 not depend on the adequacy of its campaign
 financing, the popularity of its candidate, or even its
 vote totals. The key will be the willingness of the PRI
 to acknowledge an opposition victory. Nonetheless,
 the nature of Barrio's campaign and whether the PRI
 unites behind Baeza almost certainly will affect the
 ease with which the PRI wins.
 some PAN leaders in
 Chihuahua already have privately conceded there is
 little chance Barrio can capture the governorship.
 The outcome of state deputy and local contests
 appears far less certain. On the one hand, the de la
 Madrid administration, as reflected in the results of
 midterm elections last July, appears to be pursuing a
 strategy aimed at divesting opposition parties of many
 of the offices they now hold. Mexico's leaders
 probably believe they cannot afford greater political
 liberalization at a time when, because of poor
 economic conditions, the overwhelming support of
 voters for the ruling party is no longer assured. As a
 result, we believe the PAN will lose at least some of
 the local offices it now controls in Chihuahua.
 We believe there almost certainly will be isolated
 political disturbances in Chihuahua between early
 July, when elections occur, and late September, when
 those elected are sworn in. PAN leaders in the state
 have suggested violence could result if the elections
 are stolen, an observation that PRI officials could
 interpret as a threat. The PAN almost certainly will
 protest the results if it dislikes the outcome.
 According to the Embassy, the PAN asserts that the
 PRI has inflated voter registration lists in the state by
 almost 400,000, or approximately one-third of the
 total, to facilitate fraud. As a result, protest activities
 are likely, including public rallies, occupations of
 town halls, petition drives, and hunger strikes.
 Election-related violence also is probable, in our
 judgment, but most likely will be localized and
 quickly contained.

 Jamaica: Anticipating Local
 Elections
 Elections for Jamaica's 13 local parish councils, which
 by law must be held by 31 July, probably will
 determine whether Prime Minister Seaga can resist
 opposition calls for a general election before his term
 expires in 1988. Although Seaga has some political
 capital on which to draw, there are indications that
 voters will use the local contests to express
 dissatisfaction with his ruling Jamaica Labor Party
 (JLP) and give People's National Party (PNP) leader
 Michael Manley a victory that will strengthen PNP
 calls for a national showdown soon. Manley recently
 has become more active in trying to generate
 enthusiasm among his supporters for the coming
 contests.F___1
 Seaga has postponed the local polls, originally
 scheduled for June 1984, three times purportedly for
 technical reasons, prompting opposition charges that
 he was tampering with the democratic process.
 Although Seaga has not yet announced a date for the
 contests, it is unlikely he will postpone them again
 because such a move would encourage Manley to
 increase his pressure for early national elections.
 The Communist Workers' Party of Jamaica also
 attaches major significance to the forthcoming local
 vote and aims to win one or more council seats to
 substantiate its claims to be a legitimate player on the
 national political stage, according to the Embassy.
 Although small, the party reportedly has stepped up
 efforts to build broader grassroots support and portray
 itself as the only real alternative to the two major
 parties.                               the
 Communists are generally having limited success in
 their effort to exploit popular dissatisfaction over
 current economic conditions.
 Manley's Challenge
 Manley hopes to use the elections as a referendum on
 Seaga's policies, according to US officials. His party
 recently assumed a more active and aggressive stance,
 organizing several protests against government
 economic policies. The biggest event so far was an all-
 night vigil and procession to Jamaica House, the seat
 of government, where protesters demanded that
 savings from lower world oil prices be used to
 subsidize food and medical care. The Embassy
 estimates that Manley attracted no more than 15,000,
 failing to increase his crowd-drawing ability over a
 Both Seaga and Manley view the local contests as the
 first genuine test of their parties' electoral strengths
 since the national election in 1980, according to the
 Embassy. Although 189 parish council seats will be at
 stake, control of the councils themselves means little
 in terms of political power. Nevertheless, analysis of
 past elections shows that the outcome of the
 municipal polling often is an accurate predictor of the
 next national election. Moreover, a high-ranking
 official of the JLP has told the Embassy that a sizable
 sweep of council seats by Manley's party would
 probably necessitate calling national elections within
 six months of the local contests. Manley would
 portray a large margin of victory as a vote of "no
 confidence" in the government. He would use the
 victory to gain leverage to push for early national
 elections, according to the Embassy. F__1

 success.
 In addition, Manley has been quick to take advantage
 of the government's education policy. According to
 the Embassy, the government's announcement in
 February of the introduction of college tuition is
 highly unpopular, and
 Manley views the issue as one he can focus on to help
 overcome inertia in his party.

 Manley's recent aggressiveness marks a departure
 from a relatively passive strategy that had appeared to
 lack momentum and direction from the leadershi ,
 Manley seemed to be
 satisfied with the position of de facto leader of the
 opposition and content to let Seaga make unpopular
 but necessary economic decisions. Even if Manley is
 privately reluctant to seek an early national election,
 however, internal party pressure may be forcing him
 to become more strident in his challenges to Seaga.
 there was
 widespread criticism in the party of Manley's lack of
 activism.
 Seaga's Strengths and Weaknesses
 The Embassy reports that events this year have
 produced some good news and political pluses for the
 government, but overriding economic problems
 probably will drain ruling party support in the local
 elections. External developments such as the
 formation of the Caribbean Democratic Union under
 Seaga's leadership, the Jamaican role in former
 Haitian President Duvalier's decision to step down,
 and the Prime Minister's visit to Trinidad and
 attendance at the Grenada minisummit all helped to
 improve the government's popular standing at home,
 according to the Embassy. Much of the political
 capital that Seaga gained from these developments
 was diminished, however, by an acrimonious 13-
 month salary dispute with the Jamaica Teachers'
 Association that led to disruption in the school system
 and some violence, according to US officials.
 Labor problems are symptomatic of broad
 dissatisfaction with Seaga's attempts to follow IMF-
 recommended austerity measures. Several currency
 devaluations have raised consumer prices 220 percent
 in Jamaica's import-dependent economy since Seaga
 took office in 1980. Small employment gains in the
 manufacturing sector have been offset by layoffs of
 civil servants and bauxite workers, and the
 unemployment rate continues to hover at about 30
 percent. Despite Seaga's strict economic policies,
 noncompliance with IMF targets has interrupted aid
 flows several times, while real per capita income has
 fallen about 13 percent since 1980.F__-]
 These difficulties are sapping support for the JLP.L
 several
 major Jamaican business corporations intend to
 withhold funding to Seaga's party, or contribute to
 Manley's party, for the local elections because of
 discouragement with the government's economic

 Several incidents this year may point to the
 reemergence of political violence as a campaign
 tactic.'
 ? Members of a Jamaica Labor Party youth ct iliate
 disrupted a parents-teachers' organization meeting
 in January with shouting, egg-throwing, and tire-
 slashing. These actions were quickly disavowed and
 condemned by the party, according to the Embassy.
 ? Street thugs-traditionally drawn to political
 rallies-marred a People's National Party's march
 on Jamaica House in March by attacking and
 robbing participants and passers-by, according to
 the Embassy.
 Paul
 Burke, a high-ranking People's National Party
 official, is attempting to regenerate the notorious
 "Hot Steppers" armed gang as a base for political
 support. The gang reportedly now has
 approximately 10 to 12 members.
 The Prime Minister reportedly intends to use the bulk
 of the estimated $40 million in oil savings for public
 works jobs in road repair this spring that would help
 reduce unemployment in time for the elections.
 Nevertheless, these projects are unlikely to overcome
 recent PNP gains. The electorate's accumulated
 grievances and desire to send the government a
 message probably will give Manley a victory large

 performance. A recent public opinion poll indicates
 that Seaga would attract only 27 percent of eligible
 voters in a general election. Seaga believes many of
 his supporters will boycott the local contests to protest
 against the government's austerity program,
 Outlook
 Once a polling date is announced, the implications for
 national politics could cause a resumption of the
 violence that has characterized past parliamentary
 elections. Proponents of violence are stepping up
 activity, even though such actions will hurt the vital
 tourism industry.
 Seaga's strengths may be enough to avoid a massive
 defeat. He is counting on superior finances and public
 works projects to give his party a respectable showing.

 Argentina                Possible Constitutional Reform
 The Argentine Congress may consider a constitutional amendment later this year
 that would allow President Alfonsin to run for a second term when his current
 term expires in 1989, according to press reports. Such an amendment might also
 shorten the presidential term from six to four years.
 'Alfonsin favors this move, although he has not stated his position
 publicly. A similar measure passed during the first presidential term of Juan
 Peron-and repealed by a subsequent military government-reinforced Peron's
 increasingly undemocratic image and ultimately aided in his downfall by uniting
 key political groups against him.
 Altering the constitution to provide a second presidential term would require a
 two-thirds majority vote in Congress, which Alfonsin and the Radical Party could
 only muster through sizable defections from the opposition. The Peronists, in our
 judgment, are not likely to support constitutional reform because they probably
 believe they could not defeat Alfonsin in the 1989 presidential election. Even if the
 Radicals manage to railroad the change through Congress, Alfonsin's insistence on
 a second term would cast doubt on his willingness to leave office and tarnish his
 image with the voters as a defender of democratic institutions.
 President Sarney named Marco Maciel, leader of the centrist Liberal Front Party,
 as his chief of staff in a cabinet reorganization in February. The appointment
 heralds a stronger civilian presidency. Unlike his predecessors, who took a
 backseat to the head of the military household, Maciel obtained broad new powers
 to bolster his effective political control of the executive branch. According to the
 US Embassy, he now will name second- and third-echelon officials throughout the
 government, a power that will ensure more coherent policymaking. To enable
 Sarney to be more assertive in dealing with Congress and his opponents, the new
 chief will control the $77 million government information and propaganda budget
 and the President's emergency reserve fund, and allocate funds to municipalities-
 keys to the political pork barrel for Congressional elections in November. Maciel
 has picked a seasoned and well-respected civil servant--Henrique Hargreaves-as
 his liaison with the Congressional leadership.0
 Maciel intends to use his new powers to lay
 the groundwork to succeed Sarney in 1991. Using his access to government funds,
 Maciel plans to assist moderates and conservatives in the coming election
 campaigns. The next Congress will draft Brazil's new constitution in 1987, and

 many observers believe it will shorten Sarney's six-year term in office.
 Nevertheless,                     Maciel wants the Congress to keep Sarney in

 notably Leonel Brizola and Janio Quadros-will be too old to run. Sarney will
 probably support Maciel's efforts, but we judge that Maciel's ability to achieve his
 goal will largely depend on the President's popularity with the electorate, which is
 currently linked to the success of the new economic stabilization program.
