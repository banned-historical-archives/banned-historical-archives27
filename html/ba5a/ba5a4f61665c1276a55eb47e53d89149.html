 MIDDLE  EAST
 USSR SEEKS TO MINIMIZE IMPORT OF NEW KISSINGER MISSION
 As with previous rounds of U.S. diplomatic efforts to facilitate
 a new Sinai disengagement agreement, Moscow thus far has given
 meager attention to Secretary Kissinger-'e current Middle East
 mission.  TASS in a one-sentence dispatch from Washington on the
 18th reported that a White House spokesman had officially announced
 that the Secretary "is to make a trip to the Middle East as part
 of his shuttle diplomacy in the area."  While scattered comment
 has ccv:tinued to express standard criticism of "partial" Arab-
 Israeli agreements, Moscow had been reserved on the specific sub-
 ject of a new Sinai accord in the first half of August.
 As it became apparent that negotiations through the United States
 were intensifying and that Kissinger might undertake a new Mideast
 trip to conclude an accord, Moscow began to prepare the ground by
 minimizing the sigi..ficance of any new agreement.  On the 13th, a
 commentary carried by the "unofficial'? Radio Peace and Progress--
 tl:e lowest level of Soviet media--explicitly criticized U.S.
 Mideast diplomacy, American "intermediaries," and "maneuvers for
 a partial settlement."  Following up on the 18th, a Moscow radio
 commentary in Arabic, sharply criticial of a ne:a disengagement
 accord, attacked not only Israel but implicitly Egypt as well by
 pointing out various alleLed disadvantages of a new accord for
 Egypt, Syria and the Palestinians.  The commentary also viewed
 with distinct distaste the proposal for a U.S. presence in the
 Sinai to man an early warning system as part of a new agreement.
 other comment has cast doubt on Israeli intentions underlying any
 new accord, continuing to maintain that Tel Aviv seeks to retain
 possession of as much Arab land as possible and to avoid the
 issue of satisfying Palestinian rights.
 U.S. DIPLOMACY     Criticism of the U.S. diplomatic role in
 facilitating the Israeli-Egyptian talks has
 been implicit in Moscow's overall treatment of a possible new
 accord, but c.:)mment directly critical of the United States has
 been rare--a treatment generally in line with Moscow's handling
 of Secretary Kissinger's last Mideast: trip in March 1975.*  One
 such attack, however, came in the 13 August Radio Peace and
 Progress broadcast, which remarked that a new Sinai accord was

 "quite possible" in view of Secretary Kissinger's previous remarks
 that he would not otherwise undertake a new Mideast mission.  The
 Peace and Progress commentary recalled remarks by Syrian President
 al-Asad that an interim Sinai agreement prior to a Geneva confer-
 ence and not linked to the Golan and West Bank situations "could
 only hamper peace efforts."   The  commentary asserted that such a
 view was confirmed by the failure of previous attempts "secretly
 made" to solve the Arab-Israeli problem, adding that "nor has the
 step-by-step policy produced any substantial developments--yet the
 maneuvers for a partial settlement continue, as we can see."  The
 broadcast also noted that Israel had requested U.S. aid in build-
 ing a new defense line in the Sinai, and charged that such a plan
 "confirms that the American intermediaries want, by means of the
 disengagement betweeen Egyptian and Israeli forces, to create
 greater possibilities for maneuver by Israeli diplomacy."
 CRITICISM     While Moscow has been emphasizing the ultimate price
 OF EGYPT      to be exacted by Israel in return for a small terri-
 torial withdrawal in the Sinai, it has at the same
 time implicitly questioned Cairo's wisdom in cooperating with U.S.
 diplomacy and allowing itself to fall into the "snare" of sepa;:ate
 agreements.  A Moscow radio commentary in Arabic on the 18th, 1" or
 exa;aple, employed scarcely Veiled sarcasm even as it conceded
 that Secretory Kissinger's new round of shuttle diplomacy might
 result in Egypt's recovery of the Mitla and Jiddi passes and the
 Abu Rudays oilfields.  The commentary observed that neither the
 Arabs themselves nor "their loyal friends" object to "the libera-
 tion of even an inch of Arab territory"--a favorite expression of
 Egyptian President as-Sadat's.  But it went on to remark that many
 Arabs "and their friends" were troubled about the price to be paid
 for this "not very extensive withdrawal."  Citing the views of
 unidentified Arab papers, the commentary maintained that Israel's
 policies gave ample cause for skepticism that a new accord would
 help, rather than hinder, resolution of the basic is;;ues---complete
 Israeli withdrawal fro;.z Arab territories and assuranccA of
 Palestinian rights.  The commentary repeated the oft-expressed
 Soviet allegation that Israeli strategists sought a new Sinai
 accord "to isolate Egypt from the joint Arab front," and added
 that Israel wanted a "buffer zone" along the new disengagement
 line which could "greatly hinder any counteraction by Egypt" in
 a new Arab-Israeli war.
 The 13 August Peace and Progress commentary was more forthright in
 its criticism of Egypt, asserting that Israel, "with the support
 of U.S. diplomacy," was attempting to dupe the Arab states--
 "starting with Egypt"--into making "significant political
 concessions which have been described as amounting to a degrading
 capitulation."  The commentary asserted that "all the patriotic

 forces in the Arab world," in implied contrast to Egypt, were
 criticizing both the notion of separate accords and the objectives
 underlying them.  Referring to the Damascus ATH-THAWRAH, but also
 closely paraphrasing part of a Yu. Glukhov PRAVDA article on the
 12th, the ccmmentary cited as objects of the Arab criticism an
 alleged U.S. refusal to exert effective pressure on Israel for a
 genuine Mideast settlement, along with a simultaneous U.S. supply
 to Israel of weapons and "every possible economic and financial
 assistance."
 U.S. PRESENCE     As another example of the price Egypt could pay
 IN SINAI          for a new disengagement accord, the Moscow
 Arabic-language broadcast on the 18th referred
 to reports that "a foreign presence" might be allowed on Arab
 territory and, specifically, that "American technicians" might
 man the "so-called werning system" near the Sinai passes to
 monitor compliance with a new agreement.  The broadcast saw such
 an arrangement as complicating the issue of Israeli occupation
 of Arab territory, since the proposal would inject "the question
 of a relationship with foreign machinery--in this instance
 American--that has no connection :.iith the United Nations and
 its emergency forces."  The broadcast charged that "this machinery
 will only be linked with the forces of the aggressor and will
 serve his aims."

 PORTUGAL
 PRAVDA OBSERVER CRITICIZES WESTERN MEDDLING, URGES LEFTIST UNITY
 Moscow has elevated the level of its comment on Portugal with a
 19 August PRAVDA Observer article, only the second time since the
 April 1974 coup that Portuguese events have received authoritative
 treatment in PRAVDA.  A PRAVDA editorial article last February,
 ostensibly marking the forthcoming first anniversary of the coup,
 had seemed timed to coincide with preparations for the April
 constituent elections.*
 The present Observer article reflects Soviet concern over the
 deteriorating situation of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP),
 as well as uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of what
 Moscow commentators have been calling "the most serious and
 complex crisis."  The Observer article and other current comment
 seem calculated to keep Moscow's options open.   Observer
 attacked both domestic reaction and Western "interference," but
 did not repeat recent charges that alleged Western intervention
 was incompatible with CSCE obligations.  Observer's remark--
 highlighted in the TASS summary of the article--that the Soviet
 people "firmly defend the principle of noninterference in the
 domestic affairs of other countries" was perhaps an indirect
 response to Secretary Kissinger's 14 August Birmingham address
 in which he warned the Soviet Union against interference in
 Portugal.
 OBSERVER ON          Despite the criticism of the Socialist Party (PS)
 DOMESTIC EVENTS      leadership and the call for "support" of the
 PCP, Observer's chief message appeared to be the
 article's concluding appeal for leftist and military unity.  Under-
 lining this point, TASS quoted this final sentence as the lead in its
 summary of the Observer article.  The Soviet people,, Observer declared,
 "regard with profound sympathy the Portuguese democrats' desire to
 insure the unity of actions of the MFA (Armed Forces Movement), the
 :ommunists, the socialists, and all leftwing progressive forces who
 advocate the strengtheiing of the antifascist democratic regime in
 the country and are defending the Portuguese people's revolutionary
 gains."  Thus, Moscow on its own account reaffirmed in almost identical
 language a position taken jointly by the CPSU and the Italian Communist
 Party in an 8 August communique--apparently the first time Moscow
 had mentioned unity since Portugal's government crisis began developing
 late this spring.  The February PRAVDA editorial article had advised

 "all progressive forces" to maintain unity, but this idea was
 pursued only sporadically in subsequent comment.
 Observer appeared to be making a careful effort to place Moscow on
 record with support for any of the "progressive forces" which
 might come out on top in the current power struggle.  Thus, the
 article said that "no true friend" of the Portuguese people could
 "remain indifferent Lo reaction's intrigues."  Observer then went
 on to stress the importance of "mass solidarity" with the "political
 forces" in Portugal struggling against reaction, subordinating
 to this a less emphatic call for "support" specifically for the
 Portuguese communists.   (The Observer article did not repeat the
 pledge in a 16 July IZVESTIYA article by Kamynin that Portugal
 could "count on active economic and political cooperation with
 the socialist countries.")
 In the same cautious vein, Observer portrayed the Socialist
 Party (PS) leadership as responsible for tha present situation,
 but at the same time contrived, along the lines of other recent
 comment, to suggest that whatever its true intentions, the party's
 actions were being exploited by "reactionary forces."  "Like it
 or not," Observer said, the PS leaders were rallying "all the
 reactionary forces in Portugal, including those who have recently
 tormented communists, socialists, and other democrats and
 patriots "  Like other commentators, Observer did not identify
 the "reactionary forces" but described the perpetrators of
 disturbances and "pogroms" against the PCP as terrorist detach-
 ments, hooligar elements, unruly thugs and hired terrorists.
 Holding up the Chilean example--as had a Moscow radio foreign-
 language commentary on the 15th--Observer noted that the present
 attacks by reactionaries "remind us of the things that happened
 just before the fascist coup in Chile."
 The Observer article's critical, yet measured, handling of
 Portuguese moderates had been foreshadowed in the 17 August
 Moscow radio observers roundtable, in which Moscow radio political
 o'i;server Dunayev recalled the "leading role" played in the
 revolution by former foreign minister Melo Antunes and wondered
 how a man like Antunes--whose "motives and sincerity" were not in
 question--had now "permitted his name and popularity to be used
 by the enemies of the revolution."  Dunayev saw PS leader Mario
 Soares--welcomed "triumphantly" in Lisbon after the 1974 coup--as
 a "similar although somewhat different case," and speculated
 whether PS "excuses" for withdrawal from the'government, like
 Soares' "personal conflict" with Prime Mi?I;ister Goncalves, did
 not "hide something more substantial."

 TREATMENT OF           Soviet sensitivity to Secretary Kissinger's
 KISSINGER ADDRESS      warning to the USSR vis-a-vis Portugal in
 his 14 August Birmingham address was
 demonstrated in Moscow's hand?ing of the speech.  Not until the
 16th did TASS selectively report the speech, in a New York-datelined
 dispatch which :elegated his remarks on Portugal to a brief final
 paragraph.  A version carried by RED STAR and Moscow radio further
 compressed TASS' paragraph on Portugal, while PRAVDA omitted this
 paragraph entirely, along with two other deletions.
 The TASS report, of course, made no mention of Secretary Kissinger's
 remark that the United States has "never accepted that the Soviet
 Union is free to relax tensions selectively," and his specific
 caution that the Soviet Union "should not assume that it has the
 option, either directly or indirectly, to influence events contrary
 to the right of the Portuguese people to determine their own
 future."  TASS' editorialized account said he declared U.S.
 sympathy with "the 'moderate elements,' which, as is well known,
 oppose the policy of the Revolutionary Council."  TASS said
 Kissinger "admitted at the same time that 'the events in Portugal.
 are the result of the development of Portuguese history itself."'
 The Secretary did say that events in Portugal have their origin
 in the dynamics of Portuguese history; but he went on to add that
 80 percent of the Portuguese people had declared their desire
 for a democratic system, and "the attempt by an antidemocratic
 and doctrinaire minority to thwart this desire is meeting

 INTERNATIONAL  COMMUNISM
 PRAVDA WARNS AGAINST DANGERS OF COMPROMISING WITH SOCIALISTS
 In a str4!,.ing reassertion of Soviet hardline revolutionary doctrine,
 PROBLEMS OF PEACE AND SOCIALISM Chief Editor K.I. Zarodov warned
 in a 6 August PRAVDA article that communist parties must maintain
 "hegemony" in bourgeois democratic revolutions in the West and be
 willing to suppress resistance by force if necessary.  Ostensibly
 commemorating a 1905 essay by Lenin, Zarodov was clearly aiming
 at present-day "opportunists," "moderates," and "conciliators"
 within the communist movement who, according to him, were willing
 to compromise communist revolucionary goals for the sake of-pre-
 serving tactical alliances with socialist parties.  Although? there
 was no reference to Portugal in the text, the article will no
 doubt be read in the West and in the communist movement generally
 as an endorsement for a policy of forceful measures to preserve the
 communist position in Portugal.   Whether it should also be read
 as a broader change of line by Moscow, implying a repudiation of
 its carefully cultivated policy of encouraging alliances with
 socialist parties, remains to be seen.  At this point, there is
 much evidence to suggest a less dramatic interpretation.
 POLICY AND IDEOLOGY     in the first place, the article is an
 isolated statement.  The bulk of Soviet
 media comment continues to express support for the coalition of
 leftist parties in Portugal and for the united front policy in
 general.   As recently as 19 August a PRAVDA "Observer" article
 reaffirmed Soviet support for the "unity of action" program in
 Portugal.  An "Observer" article involves a much more formal con-
 mitme-at of official authority than an article signed by an individual
 such as Zarodov.    Moreover, official support for "unity of action"
 was reaffirmed by world communist specialists Suslov and Ponomarev
 in speeches last month before a Kremlin conference commemorating
 the 40th anniversary of the 7th Comintern Congress, which had
 ratified a policy of seeking broad antifascist united fronts in
 the face of the growing threat from Hitler's Germany.  Ponomarev
 in partic,tlar asserted, in his speech on 4 July, that "the cause
 of defending peace" occupied an even larger place in the activity
 of communist parties today than it did in the 1930'x, as he pointed
 to the "topicality of the conclusions and ideas" of the 1935 Congress
 fur "the unity of the workers' movement and, above all, relations
 between communists and social democrats."
 In the second place, there is an alternative explanation which would
 appear to account both for the character of Zarodov's artii-le and
 the fact that it is not being seconded by other public declarations.

 The article appears to be part of an ongoing debate among Soviet
 theorists over the strategy and tactics of communist parties at
 Lhe current stage of the "crisis of world capitalism."  The Zarodov
 article itself contains many indications that it is aimed at other
 theorists who have been pushing a soft line on these questions.
 One of the more prominent of these, Timur Timofeyev, director of
 the Institute of the International Workers' Movement of the USSR
 Academy of Sciences, seems to be a particular target of Zarodov.
 THE STAGES OF REVOLUTION     In articles in KOMMUNIST in April 1975
 and in PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY in May
 1975, Timofeyev presented an extensive theoretical justification
 for the policy of united action with "democratic" forces.  A key
 issue for. 'Timofeyev was the question of distinguishing the first,
 "democratic," stage of the revolution from the second, "socialist,"
 stage.   In his view, only the first, "democratic" stage was called
 For by the current world situation.   He labeled as "'leftist'
 opportunists" those who would "deny the inevitability and necessity
 for a general democratic stage in the antifascist, antimonopolist
 struggle."  Interestingly enough, Timofeyev specified Portugal as
 one of the places where such "leftists" could be found.
 The same issue was addressed by Zarodov in his commentary on Lenin's
 article.   But unlike Timofeyev, Zarodov sought to blur the distinction
 between the two stages, recalling Lenin's statement that there was
 no "wall" between the democratic and socialist stages, and insisting
 that the tasks of both stages could be "resolved simultaneously."
 He criticized as "opportunist" the view that the "seizure of the
 levers of power should be merely a final act for the proletariat
 and its party."
 Although the conflict between the two articles is so sharp as to
 leave little doubt that the one is intended as a rebuttal of the
 other, the issue probably reflects a broader debate within the
 communist movement as well.  Timofeyev expresses what has thus far
 been the majority view--that the formation of united fronts with
 socialist parties is the best way to influence the policies of
 capitalist states in preferred directions and to prepare the way
 for eventual socialist revolution.   Zarodov expresses a dissenting
 view--possibly reflecting nothing more than the perspective of
 Pragun-based chief editor of a journal that is supposed to reflect
 the views of a diverse group of world parties--most without the
 responsibilities of exercising political power.*
 Zarodov was editor of SOVIET RUSSIA in the early 1960's before
 moving to PRAVDA as first deputy editor in 1.965.  He moved to Prague
 to assume his current position about the time of the August 1968
 Warsaw Pact intervention in Czechoslovakia.

 THE BREZHNEV CONNECTION     These observations do not, of course,
 answer all the questions raised by
 the Zarcclov article.  It remuias a puzzle why PRAVDA should have
 chosen to publish the article at this time, when the fortunes of
 the Portuguese communist party seem to have reached their Lowest
 ebb since the April elections.  It cannot be entirely ruled out,
 then, that some faction in the leadership might be using the current
 embarrassment of the Portuguese Communist Party to challenge the
 whole concept of "unity of action" as.the appropriate strategy
 fcr the current stage of the world communist movement.  Such a
 challenge would presumably involve a rebuke to Brezhnev, who is
 closely identified with the "unity of action" policy--a point
 which Timofeyev strongly emphasized.  Such a hypothesis is purely
 speculative, however, since there is no indication that any other
 leader has opposed the "unity of action" program.

 WEST EUROPEAN CP'S REACT TO PRAVDA, CITE INDEPENDENCE
 Major. W'st European communist party leaders have reacted gingerly
 to the Zarod.:Yv PRAVDA article, apparently recognizing that It puts
 at issue boch their credibility as national leaders and the
 viability of the alliances they have been developing in recent
 years with moderate socialist parties.   But the "directive" tone
 of the article compelled the West European communi3ts to
 reemphasize that their policy "is not made in Moscow," as French
 party leader Georges Marcnais put it in his 8 August press
 conference, according to L'JIUMANITE on the 9th.
 Marclais' reassertion of independence from Moscow echoed his
 remarks in late June when he responded to the much-publicized,
 so-cal.l.ed "Ponomarev directive" to West European communist parties
 which was printed in LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS on behalf of the
 beleaguered Portuguese Socialist pape': REPUBLICA.   On that
 occasion Marchais said "once again the independence of our party
 has been called into question," and "we will react strongly
 each time the charge is made against us."
 Marchais attempted to minimize the importance of the Zarodov
 article by noting its commemorative nature.  But he r_,)rietheless
 went on to take issue with Zarodov about the need for a dominant:
 communist party role in leftist coalitions when he emphasized
 that the PCF's strategy was "founded on the alliance of the left"
 and "it: is completely out of the question that we should change
 our strategy."  Marchais also further emphasized that the
 PCF's "attitude toward democracy and personal and collective
 freedoms .  .  . is well known."  This attitude, he said, "does not
 stem from an existing model or models."
 The Italian Communist Party's initial reaction--a short article
 in they 9 August L'UNITA--also tended to softpedal the polemical
 intent of Zarodov's views.   L'UNITA acknowledged that some of
 Za..odov's views seemed "partly correct," but took issue with his
 attempt to reduce Lenin's thought to a "single concept, limited
 to a few questions i-nd to short formulas."
 L'UNITA took a more forceful position on 12 August when it stated
 that "the presumption cf dictating rigid and general rules is
 unfounded," not only because "monolithism has been over for some
 time in political practice and in relations between communist
 parties" but because of the "variety of today's situations and
 problems."  The 12 August L'UNITA article also disputed Zarodov's
 "doctrinaire" view of the "relationship between democracy and
 socialism," apparently an allusion to his reference to the
 "Leninist conclusion" that "there is no 'wall' between the democratic
 and socialist stages of revolution in the new era."

 British Communist Party press spokesman George Matthews said on
 13 August that his party's policy was "independently decided by
 our party and by no other" and "the time has long since passed
 when communist parties subscribed to a single political center."
 According to the London MORNING STAR on 14 August, Matthews went
 on to suggest that this was also the position of the CPSU and
 therefore "we have no reason to believe that PRAVDA intended that
 this anniversary review of Lenin's book should be considered as
 a 'directive' to other parties."
 Given the historical nature of the article, said Matthews,
 Zarodov had paid too little attention to the changes that have
 taken place since 1905.  Zarodov, according to Matthews, failed
 to take into consideration the many different conditions that
 exist for the advance of socialism, and he dealt with tactics
 applicable to Russia at the time in which Lenin wrote "as if
 they werr: universally applicable today."  Like his fellow West
 European communists, the British pasty spokesman stressed that
 the transition to socialism must be achie,ed by "democratic
 political struggle" and that unity of socialists and communists
 was "ind!.spensable" if rightwing ideas and influence were to be
 defeated,

 PRC  FOREIGN  RELATIONS
 CAMBODIANS VISIT PRC, DPRK ON WAY TO ESCORT SIHANOUK HOME
 The first official Cambodian delegation to leave Phnom Penh since
 the 17 April victory visited China  from 15-19 August, where it
 was joined by RGNU Prime Minister Penn Nouth before proceeding
 to Korea to escort Prince Sihanouk hack to Cambodia.  During the
 Chinese portion of the trip, the delegation was led by RGNU
 Deputy Prime Ministers Kliieu Samphan and Ieng Sary.   Sihanouk has
 participated in delegation activities in Korea, and he gave a
 banquet for DPRK President Kim Il-song on 20 August at which
 Kim announced that Sihanouk would return to Cambodia with the
 delegation.
 KHIEU SAMPHAN IN CHINA     Chinese and Cambodian testimonials to
 their close mutual solidarity and
 friendship during the Khieu Samphan delegation's visit were
 similar to those expressed during the extraordinary treatment
 accorded Khieu Samphan during his April-May 1974 visit to China.
 There was, however, no repetition of last year's meeting with
 Mao, perhaps because of the absence of Sihanouk, who led the
 delegation at last year's ,.eeting.  The effusive Chinese and
 Cambodian media treatment of the ?7isit stands ir, Vivid contrast
 to cursory Cambodian-Vietnamese coverage of the recent visit to
 Cambodia, acknowledged early 'in August, of a DRV delegation led
 by VWP First Secretary Le Duan, and it serves to underscore
 recent s.'.gns of Cambodia's differentiated relationships with its
 two most important communist allies.*
 Though the visit to China of the Cambodian delegation overlapped
 with that of a high-level DRV aid delegation led by Vice Premier
 Le Thanh Nghi, there was no report of any meeting between the
 Cambodians and Vietnamese.**  By contrast, when Le Thanh Nghi
 traveled to China on a similar aid mission last August, he was
 reported meeting separately with Cambodian "head of state" Prince
 Sihanouk and with RGNU Prime Minister Penn Nouth.  This year the
 Cambodians also did not follow their practice in 1974 of stopping
 first in. Hanoi before visiting China, but traveled directly from
 Phnom Penh to China.
 *   The Cambodian delegation's 1974 visit to China is discussed in
 the TRENDS of 10 April 1974, pages 11-15; 24 April 1974, pages 19-
 20; and 30 May 1.974, pages 10-12.  Le Duan's recent visit to
 Cambodia is discussed in the TRENDS of 6 August 1975, pages 16-1.8.

 The Khieu Samphan delegation's visit was highlighted by a meeting
 with Premier Chou En-lai on 16 August.  Vice Premier Teng
 Ilsiao-ping headed the Chinese side at other meetings with the
 delegation, including their arrival on 15 August and their
 departure on the 19th.  Teng feted the delegation at a banquet
 on the 15th at which both he and Khieu Samphan spoke and held
 talks with the delegation, together with Hua Kuo-feng, on the
 15th and 16th.  Khieu Samphan and Teng I-Isiao-ping signed an
 economic and technical cooperation agreement at an 18 August
 Peking ceremony also attended by Hua and Li Hsien-nien.  Khieu
 Samphan hosted a farewell banquet on the 18th.  RGNU Prime
 Minister Penn Nouth was present at all of the delegation's
 activities except for the bilateral talks; Phnom Penh reported on
 16 August that he had flown to Peking from Pyongyang especially
 to meet the delegation.   On 19 August NCNA released a joint
 communique dated the 18th.
 SINO-CAMBODIAN AGREEMENTS    The 18 August joint communique
 employed essentially the same
 expressions of warmth and solidarity between the two countries
 that were in last year's communique, hailing the growth and
 progress of the "great revolutionary friendship and militant
 unity" between them, though again failing to note a complete
 unanimity of views.  Both communiques similarly hailed the
 conclusion of the respective aid agreements as "another vivid
 manifestation of the friendship and unity" between the countries,
 and in both commur?nues the Cambodian delegation acknowledged
 Chinese assistance to the Cambodian liberation struggle in the
 past.  Both communiques also assessed similarly the importance of
 the respective visits, the current communique stating that Khieu
 Samphan's visit this year had made "an important contribution to
 strengthening the great revolutionary friendship and militant
 unity" between the two peoples and to "further developing the
 friendly relations and cooperation" between the two nations.
 Going slightly beyond last year's effusive language, the present
 communique recorded that the current delegation had been accorded
 a "grand and enthusiastic welcome and an extremely cordial and
 friendly reception"; last year the communique had noted "a warm
 welcome and   ;rand and cordial reception" for the delegation.
 Bilateral talks were described in the current communique as
 proceeding in a "very cordial and warm atmosphere" and both
 sides "expressed great satisfaction with the results"; last
 year's communique did not characterize the atmosphere of the talks
 between the two sides.  This year's communique repeated last year's
 condemnation by both countries of international maneuvers of the
 "superpowers," and Cambodia reinforced its anti-Soviet credentials
 by lauding China as a "steel bulwark" of the "socialist movement."

 NCNA's i8 August report of the agremeent on economic and technical
 cooperation signed by Teng Hsiao-ping and Khieu Samphan on the 18th
 did not provide details on the intended cooperation, but Khieu
 Samphan in referring to the accord on the 18th thanked the
 Chinese for their "unconditional and gratis aid."  The aid
 agreement concluded last year and signed by Chou En-tai and Khieu
 Samphan had called for "gratis provision of military equipment
 and supplies" to the inaurgent Front for "1974."
 DELEGAT;ON IN KOREA     Under the leadership of both Penn Nouth
 and Khieu Samphan, the Cambodian delegation
 departed Peking on 19 August for Pyongyang, where it was greeted on
 arrival by DPRK Vice President Kim Tong-kyu.  Accompanied by
 Prince Sihanouk, the delegation was received by Kim Il-song on
 the 19th and was feted at a welcoming banquet hosted by Kim
 Tong-kyu and attended by Kim I1-song.   Vice Premier Ieng Sary
 did not accompany the delegation to Korea, but according to NCNA
 on .19 August departed Peking that day for Lima as head of
 Cambodia's delegation to the ministerial conference of nonalined
 nations.
 Sihanouk gave a banquet for Kim Il-song on 20 August, at which
 Kim formally noted that Sihanouk would return to Cambodia.
 Kim referred to the Penn Nouth-Khieu Samphan delegation as having
 come to visit Korea "in order to accompany Samdech Norodom
 Sihanouk home."
 PHNOM PENH COVERAGE     Phnom Penh radio's coverage of the
 delegation's visit to Peking has thus
 far followed the past practice of Front media in reporting the
 delegation's activities in detail and carrying texts of speeches
 and of the final communique, in striking contrast to its terse
 coverage of the recent visit to Phnom Penh by VWP First Secretary
 Le Duan, which was noted only by a brief communique on 3 August.
 Thus, Phnom Penh radio reported on 15 August the delegation's
 departure from Phnom Penh's Pochentong airport, and noted its
 arrival in Peking with a 16 August report.
 On 17 August Phnom Penh radio carried the full text of Khieu
 Samphan's 15 August banquet speech--the first time since Cambodia's
 "liberation" that the radio has carried the full text of a RGNU
 leader's speech--and reported Teng Hsiao-ping's speech at some
 length in its "weekly international news feature."  On the 17th
 the radio also carried an editorial hailing Chinese support for
 Sihanouk and the Front since its inception, specifically singling
 out the efforts of Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai, and acknowledging
 anew that the PRC has "continued to provide unconditional support"
 since the liberation.  The radio reported the signing of the aid
 agreement, the departure of the delegation for Pyongyang, and the
 departure of Ieng Sary's delegation to Lima, all on 20 August.

 PEKING GIVES RESTRAINED WELCOME TO HANOI ECONOMIC DELEGATION
 Peking media treatment of the 12-17 August visit by a ARV economic
 delegation led by Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi has provided new
 evidence of coolness in Sino-Vietnamese relations by omitting
 almost entirely the customary cordial descriptions of visit atmos-
 pherics applied to similar visits by Le Thanh Nghi in July, August,
 and October last year.*  The delegation was greeted on arrival on
 the 12th and feted at a welcoming banquet on the 13th by PRC Vice
 Premier Li Hsien-nien, '.rho had welcomed Le Thanh Nghi on his
 visits last year.  The delegation also met PRC Premier Chou En-lai
 in the hospital; last year's delegation did not meet Chou on its
 first visit, but had a meeting with him after signing an economic
 and military aid protocol on 26 October.  Hanoi's VNA on the 18th
 announced that the delegation had gone on to the Soviet Union on
 the 17th; DRV Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Ly Ban has remained
 in Peking, presumably to continue negotiations as he did last year.
 Characterizations of atmospherics were notably lacking throughout
 the delegation's visit this year as compared with its initial
 visit in July last year.  While NCNA had reported that Li Hsien-nien
 had "warmly greeted" the delegation on arrival in July last year,
 NCNA reported that Li only "greeted" the delegation on 12 August
 this year.  Initial talks between Le Thanh Nghi and Li last year
 had proceeded in a "very cordial and friendly atmosphere" according
 to NCNA, but this year initial talks between the two leaders were
 not characterized by NCNA.  In NCNA's report on the 13 August
 banquet and speeches, Li did not express confidence that Sino-Viet-
 namese relations would "be consolidated and constantly develop on
 the basis of proletarian internationalism," as he had in his
 5 July banquet speech last year.  While Le Thanh Nghi was "warmly"
 sent off on his 7 July departure by Li Hsien-nien last year, NCNA
 did not  characterize his sendoff this year.
 By contrast, Hanoi media continue to describe the tone and atmosphere
 of Le Thanh Nghi's meetings with PRC leaders in terms similar to
 those applied to his visits to the PRC last year.  Thus, a 14 August
 VNA report had stated that "an atmosphere of militant solidarity and
 great friendship completely pervaded" the ]. August banquet.
 *  The successive visits of the DRV delegation last year were dis-
 cussed in the TRENDS of 10 July 1974, page 19; 14 August 1974, pages

 20 AUGUST 1975
 Last year, Peking reports showed sensitivity about Chinese aid to
 Vietnam; the pattern continued in NCNA's report of this year's
 13 August banquet speeches by Li Hsien-nien and Le Thanh Nghi,
 which deleted several references to Chinese backing that were
 included in Hanoi's 14 August VNA report of the baaquet and speeches.
 The only references to such backing retained by NCNA in summarizing
 Li's speech dealt with Chinese sympathy and support for Vietnam
 in the past and his pledge of continuing Chinese support for the
 "Just struggles" of the Vietname,fc people.  While NCNA did record
 Le Thanh Nghi's remark that China has always supported Vietnam out
 of "bounden internationalist duty," NCNA delet::d Nghi's mention of
 current talks on economic aid to Vietnam, his recognition that
 Chinese aid had constituted an "important factor" in the communist
 vi(:tory in Vietnam, and his expectation that "an increase" in PRC
 aid would be of "great importance" and have a "-,reat effect" on
 Vietnamese reconstruction.  NCNA's coverage of the banquet speeches
 by Li and Le Thanh Ng:ii during Ngh;'s successive visits last year
 had cimilarly omitted most references in Peking's own name to aid
 the Vietnam.
 NCNA's report of the banquet speeches deleted all but two references
 to the United States, both made by Le Thanh Nghi.  While reporting
 Li's assessment of the "great international significance and
 historic importance" of the Vietnamese victory, NCNA omitted Li's
 elaboration--reported by Hanoi--on the future importance of the
 victory to other liberation struggles.  Hanoi predictably omitted
 Li's assessment of the current international situation with its
 references to "hegemonism" related to the Sino-Soviet polemic
 exchange.

 PEKING PORTRAYS U.S. TIES TO JAPAN. HITS SOVIET THREAT
 Consistent with the Peking media's increasingly positive treatment
 of developments suggesting that the United States maintains a
 strong strategic presence in Asia to guard against Soviet inroads,
 Chinese media have virtually dropped criticism of U.S.-
 Japan ties while increasing their attacks on Soviet intentions re-
 garding Japan.*  Peking's NCNA reported the 5-6 August tsiks between
 President Ford and Prime Minister Milci without the usual reproaches on
 U.S.-Japanese defense ties.  At the same time, Chinese reports on
 14 August sharply criticized Soviet military and economic pressures,
 instead of criticizing U.S. military involvement in Japan as had
 been customary in the past on that date, the anniversary of V-J Day,
 an anniversary which Chinese media usually have not acknowledged
 explicitly.
 FORD-MIKI TALKS     A 7 August NCNA report highlighted passages from
 the U.S.-Japanese joint announcement following
 President Ford's talks with Prime Minister Miki which emphasized
 the importance both sides attach to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty
 and noted that "the continued maintenance of the treaty serves the
 long-term interests of both countries."  NCNA replayed the announce-
 ment's affirmation that the United States would continue to abide
 by its defense commitment to Japan, and cited without adverse comment
 President Ford's statement that the United States "would continue
 to play an active and positive role in that region and would continue
 to uphold its treaty commitments there."  By contrast, Peking's
 coverage of the last official visit by a Japanese prime minister
 to the United States, a 3 August 1973 report on former Prime Minister
 Tanaka's talks in Washington with then President Nixon, had ignored
 both sides' stress in their joint communique on the importance of
 the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.
 In reporting that the two leaders had discussed "a wide range" of
 economic problems, NCNA avoided references to U.S.-Japanesr: friction
 over trade and financial matters that in the past had been a staple
 of Chinese comment.  Peking even noted with apparent   approval that
 both leaders had "welcomed" a dialog between oil producers and
 consumers.  By contrast, the 3 August 1973 NCNA report on former
 Prime Minister Tanaka's talks had cited alleged "contradictions"

 between the two leaders on trade and fi..ical policies, noting news
 reporLa that Tanaka felt the United States and Japan were "both
 partners and competitors."
 The current NCNA report on the Ford-Miki talks did criticize the
 passage in the joint announcement which voiced both sides' support
 for the security of South Korea, but Peking's rebuke was predictably
 milder than its reaction  to the last U.S.-Japan summit communique
 to focus on Korean security--the November 1969 joint communique
 following former Japanese Prime Minister Sato's talks with former
 President Nixon.  That communique had prompted an outpouring of
 strident Chinese comment, including a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial,
 accusing "chieftain of U.S. imperialism" Nixon and "his faithful
 lackey" Sato, among other things, of plotting to drive "Japanese
 militarist forces" to promote "aggression and war" in Korea and
 elsewhere in Asia.
 V-J DAY ANNIVERSARY     The Chinese media, as usual, have not
 explicitly acknowledged the 14 August 30th
 anniversary of the defeat of Japan in the Pacific war, but NCNA
 did use the date to issue two sharply worded reports attacking
 Soviet military threats and pressure against Japan.  On the last
 quinquennial of the date in 1970, Peking similarly had avoided
 explicitly acknowledging V-J Day but had iasued a 'Lengthy NCNA
 attack on the United States for its alleged military occupation
 and pressure on Japan.
 The current NCNA reports reiterated recent wide-ranging Chinese
 cr'?icisms of Soviet policy toward Japan, claiming that Moscow was
 employing "tough and soft tactics of military threat and economic
 lure" to bring Japan into its sphere of influence.  One report
 broke new ground regarding both tactics by depicting Soviet military
 bases on the Japanese-claimed "northern territories" as "a dagger
 directed against Japan" and by pointing to a "new trick" regarding
 alleged efforts by Moscow to get the Japanese involved in a so-called
 "new plan for developing Siberia" following its failure to get
 involvement in exploitation of the Tyumen oil field in Siberia.
 The report stressed the Soviet military threat to Japan, stating
 that Moscow only needed to move its forces "slightly" in order to
 land troops on the main northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, "as
 the troops of the old tsar did in the past."  It added Japanese
 press comment that Japan's air space from "Hokkaido to Okinawa" and
 the "whole of Japan" have been "put under the shadows of Soviet
 naval and air force might."

 FBIS TRENDS
 Though the articles duly portrayed Moscow's efforts as designed
 fundamentally to contend with the United States for hegemony in
 Asia, NCNA carefully avoided all reference to the U.S. bases or
 military presence in Japan.  It even went to some pains to depict
 the United States and Japan as mutually threatened by Soviet ex-
 pansion.  For instance, one report said that Soviet naval maneuvers
 around Japan "pose a threat to the U.S. Pacific fleet and directly
 to Japan's security" and also stated that Soviet bases in the
 northern territories were targeted for use against the United
 States as well as Japan.
