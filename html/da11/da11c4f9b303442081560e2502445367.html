 FAR EAST
 Indochina
 Vietnam: Saigon Government on the Defensive
 An increasing number of political elements
 seem to have concluded that the Thieu govern-
 ment has been hurt as a result of the recent turn
 of events. The opposition still appears highly frag-
 mented and incapable of effective, coordinated
 action, but many opposition leaders and some
 rejected political suitors clearly believe that now
 is a good time to get in a few blows against the
 government. Even the usually proadministration
 Saigon newspaper, Chinh Luan, has commented
 that Thieu has damaged his ability to lead the
 people. So far, antagonism against the regime
 does not seem particularly intense among the
 people, and there have only been a few small
 demonstrations that have been easily contained.
 Antiregime sentiment, however, may well gather
 more  momentum during the remaining three
 weeks before the presidential election-or refer-
 endum-on 3 October.
 Vice President Ky's efforts to change Presi-
 dent Thieu's plans for the presidential election
 and to capture the leadership of the opposition
 are taking the spotlight for the moment. Ky's
 threats in his remarks to foreign newsmen last
 week went considerably beyond his earlier attacks
 on the President. Ky, possibly prompted by the
 realization that his threats might force Thieu to
 take countermeasures, later issued a denial that he
 had said he would destroy Thieu. Nevertheless,
 Ky allowed an impression to remain that a coup is
 a real possibility, in the apparent belief that this
 will win him some points in the opposition
 groups.
 Ky's camp probably has encouraged some of
 the recent protests by militant disabled veterans.
 The vice president may have had prior knowledge
 of plans for a protest suicide attempt in Nha
 Trang last weekend. He arrived shortly before it
 occurred and has received considerable publicity
 because of his presence at this incident.
 Some militant students and other political
 factions  are  also  protesting  Thieu's  election
 policy.  Although the President has remained
 unmoved by pressure for a postponement of the
 presidential election, there are signs that he is
 becoming nervous about the situation.F
 Thieu appears uncertain about how to
 handle   the  inflammatory  Ky,  but any steps
 against the vice president almost certainly would
 make the situation worse.

 nam panhandle have been cut by flooding; but
 logistics preparations under way in the southern
 provinces for the movement of supplies and men
 through the Laos panhandle during the coming
 dry season  probably have been affected only
 marginally.
 Hanoi faces a major clean-up job in the wake
 of serious flooding, but assistance from China and
 the USSR will replace agricultural losses. North
 Vietnamese weather broadcasts indicate that rain-
 fall in 1971 has been generally double the amount
 of last year, ranking with the highest ever re-
 corded. Aerial photography               shows
 extensive flooding in the delta surrounding Hanoi.
 The heaviest rainfall in the Red River Delta, the
 country's principal population and agricultural
 region, took place during 13 to 19 August. Higher
 than average rains in the extreme northwest in-
 creased the flow down the Black, Clear, and Red
 rivers, adding to the delta's flood stage at Viet
 Tri, where the three rivers converge some 30 miles
 northwest of Hanoi. North Vietnamese papers
 report that many locations in the delta were "sub-
 merged for several weeks" and that dikes and
 dams which had been improved and strengthened
 in recent years were "greatly damaged."
 Premier Pham Van Dong's statement that
 the current floods are worse than in 1945, when
 hundreds of thousands died in an ensuing famine,
 suggests that there has been considerable human
 suffering, although Hanoi has not yet released
 casualty figures. Presumably reserves of food and
 other daily necessities have been drawn down to
 provide relief to flood victims. Looters and specu-
 lators seeking to profit from disorder are being
 given stern warnings of prosecution.
 Agriculture will suffer severely from the
 flood. The tenth-month rice crop, usually pro-
 ducing about 2.5 million tons, already had been
 planted.  Losses, however, are expected to be
 made up by increased food shipments from China
 and the USSR. Both Peking and Moscow have
 pledged relief assistance.

 Laos: One Step Backward in the South
 The Communists on 4 September inflicted
 another setback on government forces attempting
 to recapture Paksong on the Bolovens Plateau.
 The North Vietnamese used a coordinated ground
 and mortar attack to drive three Lao Army bat-
 talions from positions on Route 23 west of the
 town. The government front line is now held by
 irregular battalions at Ban Phak Kout, six miles
 from Paksong.
 Although there is no evidence of the extent
 of North Vietnamese casualties, the enemy was
 subjected to heavy air strikes and artillery shell-
 ings in the Paksong area. Nonetheless, they have
 thwarted every government attempt to recapture
 the town. Lao Army battalions, despite relatively
 heavy casualties, have fought their way through
 heavily fortified enemy positions, once to within
 two miles of their objective, only to be driven
 back by counterattacks. The Communists have
 quickly shifted their forces to meet government
 thrusts from the northwest, the south, and the
 west. The 9th  NVA  Regiment, with  a total
 strength of about 1,400, is responsible for the
 security of Paksong. Although the 9th has prob-
 ably suffered significant casualties, it presumably
 continues to maintain a tactical capability be-
 cause of a steady stream of replacements.
 On the northwest edge of the Plateau, the
 four-battalion irregular task force that occupied
 Ban Lao Ngam on 2 September continues to be
 the target of Communist shelling attacks and

 northern and eastern edges of the Plaine des
 Jarres. Vang Pao's irregulars last week were forced
 to abandon outposts northeast and southeast of
 the Plaine, although no major positions changed
 hands. The North Vietnamese used shelling at-
 tacks and ground probes to harass other govern-
 ment positions.
 Cambodia: Artful Political Dodging
 After some delicate negotiations, the govern-
 ment appears to have worked its way around a
 potential confrontation with the National As-
 sembly. Although the uneasy truce with the
 Assembly could break down in short order, the
 government apparently has persuaded the leg-
 islature to postpone its interpellation of Finance
 Minister Sok Chhong until the Assembly approves
 the regime's projected economic reforms and the
 multinational Exchange Support Fund (ESF) is
 established. The latter is likely to take some time,
 and Chhong could have a lengthy grace period.
 Chief of State Cheng Heng was largely re-
 sponsible for bringing the Assembly around, as
 Lon Nol and Sirik Matak evidently prevailed upon
 the  harassed  Chhong to  pigeonhole  his oft-
 tendered resignation. In doing so, they probably
 have also calmed down some members of the
 cabinet who were vowing to quit if Chhong fell
 victim to the Assembly or if his resignation was
 accepted. It is likely that the leadership's efforts
 were helped along considerably by a general
 recognition in the capital that a serious political
 crisis could discourage foreign backing for the
 ESF and could also endanger the possibility of
 obtaining additional economic assistance from
 Washington.
 Little Military Movement
 Communist  forces  continue  to  lay  low
 throughout the  country, leaving the military
 initiative to the government. Cambodian Army
 (FAN K) units in clearing operations along Route
 6 in Kompong Thorn Province met only light
 enemy resistance during the week and continued
 to consolidate their positions around Kompong
 Thmar.  Despite the relative ease with which
 FANK troops have moved up Route 6, Prime
 Minister Lon Nol apparently has decided that the
 drive will not be extended any farther north along
 the highway toward Kompong Thom town.
 The Cambodians reportedly are considering
 a push  southeastward  from  Kompong Thmar
 along Route 21, however, aimed at clearing crack
 Communist forces from their strongholds in the
 rubber plantations that line that highway. But for
 the moment, FANK troops on Route 6 are to
 concentrate on pacification operations from Tang
 Kouk to Kompong Thmar. In line with this, First
 Deputy Prime Minister In Tam has visited re-
 cently liberated villagers in areas between those
 two towns to assure them that they can count on
 the continuing protection of FANK.
 Two FANK battalions from Kompong Thom
 have begun a second clearing operation along
 Route 6, south of that town. The small size of
 this operation suggests that it is primarily local in
 nature, and that it is not destined to link up with
 the FANK units at Kompong Thmar. Although
 elements of the Communist VC/KC 201st Regi-
 ment apparently are located within striking dis-
 tance of the battalions, they have not yet seri-
 ously challenged the slow and cautious FANK

 Japan:  The China Problem.
 Some leaders of the ruling Liberal Demo-
 cratic Party (LDP) have dissociated themselves
 from Prime Minister Sato on the China represen-
 tation issue. These leaders-including former de-
 fense chief Yasuhiro Nakasone, who otherwise
 supports Sato-are opposing a decision to co-
 sponsor US-proposed resolutions on the issue,
 although the government has promised to support
 them. Two major party leaders-former foreign
 ministers Miki and Ohira-have publicly objected
 even to supporting the resolutions, advocating
 instead all possible encouragement for Peking's
 admission. Ohira's stand has been seconded by
 Justice Minister Maeo and Agriculture Minister
 Akagi. At a weekend meeting of the top ruling
 party leaders, no consensus on the question of
 cosponsorship could be reached on the eve of
 Foreign  Minister  Fukuda's departure to head
 Japan's delegation to the joint economic con-
 ference in Washington on 9-10 September.
 ARMS CONTROL: The USSR has submitted a
 proposal for the provisional agenda of the up-
 coming UN General Assembly calling for a world
 disarmament conference. Although the proposal
 indicated that the conference could consider both
 nuclear and conventional weapons, it stressed the
 nuclear aspect. Support for a world conference
 was contained in Brezhnev's "peace program" last
 March but had not been pushed by the Soviets
 prior to this week. China's recent torpedoing of
 Moscow's proposed  Five Power Nuclear Con-
 ference as well as Moscow's desire to dramatize its
 present peace program probably contributed to
 the Soviet initiative. In refusing to consider the
 Five Power plan Peking reiterated its support for
 a world conference to discuss abolition of nuclear
 weapons. The Soviets may intend their initiative
 to place Moscow firmly on record as support-
 ing-even championing-a world conference, and
 at the same time to put China on the spot by
 testing  Peking's willingness to respond to the
 proposal.

 Communist China: Leftists Down, But Are They Out?
 The appearance in domestic propaganda last
 week of the first open denunciation of the ex-
 tremist May 16 Corps further attests to the grow-
 ing strength of moderate forces in China's leader-
 ship coalition. The criticism was a brief allegation
 that May 16 elements were behind factional dis-
 orders at one of Peking's leading universities in
 1968. The article in Red Flag, the authoritative
 party journal,  called  for more moderation in
 educational reform.  Its publication, as well as
 several other recent articles by foreign journal-
 ists-officially inspired-discussing the "May 16
 plot," suggests that moderate elements in the
 regime are cautiously laying the groundwork for
 an open repudiation of the more extreme phases
 of the Cultural Revolution. Eventually, there may
 also be some public explanation of the kaleido-
 scopic changes that have been precipitated within
 the leadership by the investigation, which began
 nearly two years ago, into the activities of the
 May 16 extremists and their high-level backers.
 Although the full ramifications of the in-
 vestigation are by no means clear, it apparently
 was meant to counter the efforts of Cultural
 Revolution Group (CRG) leaders on the politburo
 to broaden their influence in regime councils,
 apparently at the expense of Premier Chou En-lai.
 Ultimately, the investigation led to the purge of
 CRG head Chen Po-ta-who was charged with
 organizing the May 16 Corps-and has cast a pall
 over the political future of Chen's closest col-
 leagues, Madame Mao and Kang Sheng. Chou's
 personal position correspondingly appears to have
 been strengthened, and the ascendancy of Chou
 and  his  more  moderate  colleagues has been
 further affirmed by the latest Red Flag article.
 Given wide dissemination on 3 September, the
 article apparently is intended to signal that efforts
 are now under way to curb further the residual
 influence of ultraleftist politburo members in the
 educational  sphere, where their influence had
 been considerable owing to Mao Tse-tung's de-
 termination to radicalize the university system.
 Despite the continuing setbacks to the leftist
 forces, the May 16 investigation does not appear
 to have reached its climax, nor has the political
 pendulum in Peking swung completely to the
 right. The regime has yet to take the final step of
 publicly denouncing Chen Po-ta, even though it is
 widely known among party cadres that the nu-
 merous press articles that have appeared since last
 May excoriating "sham Marxists" and "political
 swindlers" have been directed implicitly at Chen.
 Furthermore,  Peking  city  party  chief  Hsieh
 Fu-chih, who seems to have cast his lot with the
 -4,,....t
 _
 e
 has
 appeare   publicly on y once in  the past    18
 months and apparently has been dropped from
 his post as public security minister.
 There also are tenuous indications that the
 wholesale turnover among top military and civil-
 ian leaders in the sensitive Peking Military Region
 is in some way associated with the infighting
 within the politburo over the May 16 investiga-
 tion. During the past year, the commanders of the
 Peking garrisons and the Peking Military Region,
 as well as the regional political commissar, have
 dropped from public view. No explanation has
 been offered for their disappearance and no re-
 placements have been named, but both regional
 commander Cheng Wei-shan and political com-
 missar                                                                   Li  Hsueh-feng,  an  alternate  politburo
 member, were directly criticized by CRG leaders
 during the Cultural  Revolution. Because they
 dropped from view at a time when Chen Po-ta's
 case was coming to a head, their apparent ouster
 probably means that the influence leftist forces at
 the top have exercised over important personnel
 assignments has not been entirely vitiated.

 EUROPE
 Soviet Smiles tor Washington, Brickbats for Peking
 Soviet reaction to the recent movement in
 Sino-US relations has followed very different
 courses toward China and the US respectively.
 Moscow has intensified its hostile attitude toward
 Peking, but has provided a moderate and balanced
 public assessment of US motives. It has also taken
 actions designed to underscore the necessity and
 importance of US-Soviet relations and negotia-
 tions.  In many respects, the Sino-US activity
 seems to have given added impetus to Moscow's
 desire for productive dealings with the US, while
 it has encouraged the Soviets to take an unyield-
 inq line toward the Chinese with whom they have
 little fruitful contact and who they feel  are med-
 dling in their East European empire.
 Triggered  by the invitation to President
 Nixon, Moscow on 4 September made its sharpest
 authoritative attack on China in more than a year.
 The lengthy Pravda article by "I. Alexandrov"a
 pseudonym indicating high-level party endorse-
 ment-minced no words that Moscow sees mali-
 cious intent in Peking's invitation. The bid to the
 President was placed in the context of Peking's
 new, more flexible foreign policy, which Pravda
 branded  as  primarily  motivated  by  "anti-So-
 vietism."
 The article appeared to rationalize recent
 Soviet calls for greater Communist unity in the
 face of improving Chinese-American relations. It
 attacked Chinese efforts to undermine Soviet in-
 fluence in Eastern Europe, warning that Peking
 would be pleased "by a crack, if only a small
 one" in relations between socialist countries.
 The article restated Soviet intentions to seek
 better relations with China, but unlike some pro-
 nouncements prior to word of the President's
 impending  visit,  it contained  no conciliatory
 passages. Terming as "mythical" China's con-
 tention that it faces "a threat from the North,"
 Pravda did  net level  some of the emotional
 charges that the Soviets have made against the
 Chinese in the past. Indeed, the tone of recent
 Soviet comments public and private suggests that
 Moscow, while deeply disturbed by the implica-
 tions of improving Chinese-American relations,
 does not want Sino-Soviet relations to slip back
 to the nadir of the 1969 border fighting.
 . And Maintains Moderate Stance Toward US
 Alexandr:;v's treatment of China stands in
 marked contrast to recent Soviet handling of US
 reasons for improving relations with China. A
 lengthy Pravda article on 10 August presented an
 unusually balanced assessment of US motivation
 and reserved final judgment on the US-Soviet
 implications o' the cominc presidential visit until
 events develo  further.
 Most recently, Pravda on 2
 eptember presented  a relatively balanced ac-
 count of Secretary Rogers' speech to the Ameri-
 :an Legion, specifically noting his assurance that
 Washington's China policy does not mean any
 lessening of interest in serious negotiations with
 the USSR. The Alexandrov article appeared the
 same day as Soviet publication of the new agree-
 ment on Berl n, thus implicitly contrasting Mos-
 cow's ability to deal with the West with the
 intractable differences with China. This treatment

 suggests that not only does Moscow want to avoid
 damage to its wide-ranging contacts with Washing-
 ton through harsh polemics, but at the same time
 may be employing the China problem to justify
 internally its pursuit of detente tactics in Europe.
 Soviets Intensify Bilateral Contacts
 In addition, the Soviets have moved recently
 to intensify their bilateral relations with the US.
 This has been particularly noticeable in the area
 of cultural exchange, a field in which Soviet
 performance has generally tended to be somewhat
 perfunctory.
 On 24 August, the chief of the Cultural
 Relations Division of the Soviet Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs, Sofinsky, expressed interest in nego-
 tiating a new cultural exchange agreement before
 expiration  of  the current one, which covers
 1970-71. If the Soviets follow through, it would
 mark the first time since 1959 that they have
 agreed  to negotiate a new agreement before
 expiration of the old one.
 In a visit to Soviet Minister of Culture
 Furtseva on 3 September, the US ambassador
 found her attitude much more forthcoming than
 usual as she stressed the importance of cultural
 relations in paving the way for better political
 relations. Sofinsky told a new US cultural coun-
 selor on the same day that he "was lucky to arrive
 at a time when his work was going to be much
 easier than had been the case in the past." Both
 Sofinsky and Furtseva offered assurances that sev-
 eral problems in current cultural exchange pro-
 grams would be ironed out.
 In addition, a high official of the Soviet
 Chamber of Commerce recently made a plea for
 closer cooperation with the US Embassy. In a
 meeting requested with some urgency, he urged
 greater US participation in Soviet exhibitions
 next year, and even suggested a comprehensive
 exhibit of US products, lamenting that the last
 such US exhibit in Moscow was in 1957. The
 comments of these Soviet officials mark a striking
 change in tone and attitude and suggest that they
 have received their marching orders to encourage
 more active and visible US contacts. Moscow may
 hope to demonstrate to Washington that it is
 more profitable to deal with Moscow than with
 the "intractable" Chinese, and may also wish to
 counter the publicity being given to Sino-US
 developments. In addition, the Soviets doubtless
 want reassurance that US interest in bilateral
 contacts has not waned.
 The newest round of US-Soviet bilateral
 talks will get under way in Moscow on 12 Octo-
 ber, dealing with US-Soviet naval incidents. In
 addition  Ambassador  Dobrynin  has informed
 Secretary Rogers that Moscow is prepared to
 begin talks on outstanding bilateral  maritime
 issues this fall-a move which was preceded by US
 relaxation  of  port restrictions against Soviet
 vessels. It would not be surprising if Moscow
 should also seek additional discussions on such
 subjects as bilateral trade. This would be con-
 sistent with Premier Kosygin's comments to US
 representatives to the "Dartmouth Conference"
 in Kiev in July, when he lamented the low level of
 US-Soviet  commerce.

 International Economic Developments
 Four  weeks after  President  Nixon's an-
 nouncements the international financial markets
 have settled into a relatively stable, although tem-
 porary, pattern that is unlikely to be altered be-
 fore the IMF meeting in late September.
 Tokyo remains determined to minimize the
 yen's revaluation.  New restrictions have been
 placed on capital flows and on the freedom of
 Japanese banks to buy and sell foreign currencies.
 Moreover, the Bank of Japan has been intervening
 directly in the market. As a result, the yen has
 floated in a relatively narrow band at about six
 percent above parity.
 European currencies are fluctuating within a
 narrow band, established soon after the 23 Au-
 gust reopening of currency markets. The markets
 have remained relatively inactive, as many specu-
 lators apparently are remaining on the sidelines.
 The pound has appreciated about 2.5 percent
 against the dollar, while the mark's value has
 deviated about one percentage point from its pre -
 15 August value-eight percent above nominal
 parity. The  French  "financial" franc has ap-
 preciated by four percent, while the "commer-
 cial" franc has hovered near its ceiling, at times
 requiring official intervention.
 French and German differences are still pre-
 venting the establishment of a common EC posi-
 tion. In a number of bilateral meetings, in the EC
 monetary comn ittee meeting at Brussels, and in a
 Group of Ten deputy finance ministers meeting at
 Paris,  the  maj,ar  European  countries,  except
 France, agreed that a realignment of their cur-
 rencies is neces ary. Nevertheless, there is uncer-
 tainty  over  ultimate US objectives and con-
 siderable resentrient of US methods.
 European discussions of a possible dollar
 devaluation-primarily  as  a  concession  to
 France-reversed the earlier decline in gold prices.
 Between the Prasident's 15 August speech and 1
 September, gold prices on the London market fell
 from $43.00 per fine ounce to $40.65. This drop
 reflected the a[ ,parent acceptance by speculators
 that the official price of gold would not be in-
 creased. In reaction to the recent suggestions that
 the dollar be devalued, however, the price of gold
 rose to $41.40 t:.y 8 September.
 Canada is especially concerned about the
 impact of the import surcharge, and is the first
 country to take special measures to assist indus-
 tries that would be hurt. Early economic indica-
 tors show the Canadian economy to be experi-
 encing an upturn, and Ottawa fears that the
 surcharge would dampen the recovery. On 7 Sep-
 tember, legislat on designed to maintain employ-
 ment in industries affected by the surcharge was
 introduced. In doing so, the Trudeau.government
 rejected  actions  that  could  lead  to a trade
 INTERNATIONAL AVIATION: Delegates from
 around the world gathered in Montreal this week
 to begin drafting the "unlawful interference" con-
 vention that probably will call for the suspension
 of air services to nations that tolerate air piracy.
 This drafting session may also be capped by the
 entry into force of the complementary "unlawful
 seizure" convention opened for signature last De-
 cember. That document, inspired by the US and
 Canada, has already achieved nearly the requisite
 ten ratifications. It would require adhering states
 in which a hijacked plane lands either to extradite
 or prosecute the aerial  irates.

 NATO Plans Closer Look at Mutual Force Reductions
 The Western allies are in the midst of prepa-
 rations for a special high-level session of the
 North Atlantic Council (NAC) on 5-6 October.
 This meeting will decide how to move beyond the
 bilateral soundings that have been taken with the
 Warsaw Pact allies this summer regarding mutual
 and balanced force reductions (MBFR). The prep-
 arations to date have been marked by the cau-
 tious and skeptical approach of the European
 allies, based on their feeling that American sup-
 port for MBFR is dictated essentially by domestic
 US pressures.
 The Europeans are fretting-in private con-
 versations with US officials as well as in the
 press-about the dependability of the US commit-
 ment to the defense of Europe over the long
 term. Despite reassurances from the US, the con-
 vergence of recent events-particularly those as-
 sociated with the financial crisis-has fed suspi-
 cions that MBFR could turn out to be mainly a
 cover for the large reductions in US forces.
 The NAC session in October will probably
 designate retiring Secretary General Brosio to
 explore, in talks with Moscow and its Warsaw
 Pact allies, the prospects for MBFR negotiations.
 In recent discussions at NATO, the West Germans
 have reiterated their support for MBFR but have
 continued to urge a slow, orderly approach,
 recommending  initially  limited  and  verifiable
 reductions in order to build confidence in the
 good intentions of both sides. Although the UK
 still doubts that any reductions would be com-
 patible with Western security, both Bonn and
 London are prepared to begin a long and difficult
 negotiating prccess. The French, however, remain
 opposed to MBFR talks. Paris believes that the
 West should make no cuts in its military forces in
 Europe until the East-West political climate has
 vastly improvec.
 Some of he smaller allies are now assessing
 more thoroughly the potential impact of MBFR
 on their interests. A coalition of southern allies-
 Greece, Turkey, Italy, and Portugal-is emerging,
 in opposition to any expansion of the geographi-
 cal coverage of MBFR to include their territory.
 Their concern is not so much that their forces
 would be included, but that limitations might be
 placed on the JS presence in the Mediterranean.
 Norway and Denmark, on the other hand, appar-
 ently are not opposed to an eventual extension of
 MBFR coverage to include their territory.
 The allies are likely to continue to look to
 the US for leadership on NATO's MBFR position.
 In spite of their hopes for detente and their
 support for a Conference on European Security,
 however, the a lies will continue to be tormented
 with uncertainty about how Western Europe's
 defense would be managed with a reduced US
 presence.
 Romania Solicits Diplomatic Backing
 Although  Soviet-inspired  criticism  of
 Romania and Yugoslavia in bloc media has sig-
 nificantly subsided in the last few weeks, covert
 pressure on Bucharest apparently still continues.
 The Ceausescu regime has recently made dip-
 lomatic demarches in Paris, London, and Wash-
 ington to obtain support, but it has not conveyed
 any urgent concern. Meantime, Ceausescu used
 recent trips to Romania by high-level representa-
 tives of the Japanese and Spanish Communist
 parties to enlarge on his adherence to an inde-
 pendent course

 SECRET
 The three Romanian demarches were made
 in Paris on 30 August, in London on 1 September,
 and in Washington on 3 September. The ap-
 proaches had a common theme: Soviet pressure
 on Bucharest is incompatible with major trends
 toward detente as exemplified by Sino-US rap-
 prochement,  the Berlin draft agreement, and
 widespread interest in a conference on European
 security.
 In each instance, however, the Romanian
 diplomats did not contribute much in the way of
 specifics about Soviet pressure tactics. Instead,
 they cited official anti-Romanian utterances in
 Soviet bloc media which have included fabrica-
 tions about an "anti-Soviet axis" in the Balkans
 under Chinese sponsorship. Speaking with Secre-
 tary of State Rogers in Washington, Ambassador
 Bogdan also claimed that Moscow had exerted
 economic pressure, but he added that this has
 been "subtle and difficult to distinguish from
 hard bargaining."
 Bucharest undoubtedly is experiencing pres-
 sure from Moscow and its allies. This could easily
 occur in the economic sector; the Romanians
 have obstructed Soviet aims but are dependent on
 the USSR for some key raw materials. At the
 same time, however, Bogdan invited Secretary
 Rogers to visit Romania in the spring of 1972, an
 indication that Soviet pressure is not yet intolera-
 ble. Indeed, Bogdan described the demarches as
 reflecting his government's view that not enough
 has been done to make other governments aware
 not only of Soviet pressure on Romania but also
 of the threat such pressure poses to detente in
 general.
 The communique" summarizing the visit of
 the  Japanese  party  delegation  amplified  the
 theme of a new Communist unity in which "there
 is no need for any center of leadership in the
 Communist movement in any part of the world."
 Similarly, the Romanian-Japanese and the Ro-
 manian-Spanish communique's denounced med-
 dling in the affairs of another party, "including
 support of factions of another party."
 Each of these formulations could be con-
 strued as being implicitly critical of Moscow and
 to a lesser extent of Peking. Ceausescu, however,
 probably  sees  them  as serving to strengthen
 Romania's claims that its policy toward the Com-
 munist movement is                                                                               impartial, aimed  at real
 socialist unity, and based on correct relations
 between all parties.
 Yugoslavs Dig in for Brezhnev Visit
 This week Tito took his case for national
 solidarity to the people in preparation for Soviet
 leader Brezhnev's visit in late September. Stump-
 ing Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, he made
 impassioned pleas for unity and the rejection of
 nationalist excesses. Tito clearly wants to produce
 a convincing display of domestic cohesion as a
 base for his negotiations with the Soviets, and
 from first indications, he is succeeding.
 Tito's success in past dealings with Soviet
 leaders has been closely linked to his reliance on
 firm domestic support against both implied and
 actual  Soviet  threats.  The  internal  upheaval
 caused by the current political reform and con-
 tinuing economic problems, however, might ap-
 pear to Moscow as a rare opportunity to increase
 Soviet influence in Yugoslavia. This summer Tito
 has been unflinching in his resistance to subtle
 Soviet pressures, but Brezhnev's presence in Bel-
 grade will place a premium on domestic order and
 unity.
 Croatia presents the greatest potential for
 embarrassment; nationalism flared there early last
 spring. Tito, recognizing the possibility of a re-
 vival, arrived in Zagreb last Monday to a tumul-
 tuous-and  carefully  arranged-welcome.  He
 conducted an energetic round of personal politics
 in the republic, bestowing his favor on moderates

 like Vladimir Bakaric and Mrs. Savka Uabcevic-
 Kucar, and ignoring Croat leaders who waver in
 facing down nationalist demands. Tito's strategy
 seems to be aimed at encouraging the moderate
 wing to take even stronger measures in defense of
 Belgrade's policies.
 Prior to  visiting  Croatia,  the  President
 stopped off in Bosnia-Hercegovina, which has also
 been troubled by nationalist agitation within its
 Croatian  minority.  In  speeches  there,    Tito
 stressed the theme of national cooperation in the
 partisan war against the Germans and condemned
 those Yugoslavs who in the past cooperated with
 foreign enemies because of national animosities.
 Meanwhile  Belgrade's media have been lay-
 ing down a steacy barrage of complaints regarding
 Soviet pressure. against the Balkan mavericks.
 The latest salvo was directed against the Pravda
 Alexandrov arti ae's criticism of China's improved
 relations in the Balkans. Belgrade is, in effect,
 warning Brezhr :v not to come in expectation of
 Yugoslav concessions, and reassuring the Yugo-
 slavs that the regime is willing to reject any Soviet
 pressures.
 Mixed Prospects for East European Harvests
 Eastern Europe's total grain harvest has re-
 bounded from a 1970 setback and may nearly
 equal the record of 1969. This, however, is in
 sharp contrast to the unfavorable prospects for
 most other crops in the northern countries and in
 Hungary. East Germany is in the worst position
 of all the East European countries and for the
 third straight year may have to increase imports
 of all agricultural products.
 Grain production for this year is estimated
 tc be 12 percent above 1970, and in all countries
 except East Germany almost certainly will exceed
 the 1966-70 average level. Production of bread
 grains is expected to increase 19 percent. The
 picture is less clear for grains for livestock feed;
 coarse grain (barley, oats, and corn) may increase
 as much as six percent. However, the full impact
 of  unfavorable weather conditions on yields,
 especially in East Germany, Poland and Hungary,
 is not yet known.
 Nongrain crops have not fared as well-ex-
 cept            in Bulgaria and Romania-because of poor
 planting conditions and a summer drought. Im-
 portant fall-harvest crops like potatoes, sugar
 beets, late vegetables, and hay are expected to fall
 below the 1966-70 average level of production.
 East Germany and Poland will have an especially
 acute shortage of roughage for feeding livestock
 this winter. Tt e only major nongrain crops for
 which a good t arvest is forecast for all countries
 is oilseed.
 East Eurc pe's demand for imported grain
 through June cf next year will drop an estimated
 1.5 million tons below the record level of 9.1
 million tons imported last year. Good bread grain
 harvests in the northern countries will lessen im-
 imort requirements for milling-quality wheat, but a
 shortage of fodder supplies will  increase the
 demand there or feed grain imports.
 If the USSR agrees to provide as much grain
 to the deficit northern area as the estimated 5.5
 million tons delivered in the year which ended
 last June, imports of free world grain by the
 northern countries are unlikely to exceed two
 million tons this year. Western sales of grain to
 southern East Europe are unlikely, unless Hun-
 gary's corn cop turns out to be smaller than
 :,urrently forecast.
 In fact, southern countries may improve
 their export earnings from agricultural products
 over the next 12 months. Romania and Bulgaria
 will be net e.</div></div></div>  </div>
