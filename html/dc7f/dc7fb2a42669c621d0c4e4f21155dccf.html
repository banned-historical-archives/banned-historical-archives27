TWENTY YEARS OF DISSENT IN CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY  
1949 
October--
1954 
a) Proclamation of People's Republic of China and flight 
of armies of CHIANG Kai-shek to Taiwan which left the vic-
torious MAO Tse-tung in possession of the China mainland 
but not entirely in possession of its inhabitants. 
b) MAO's molding of the CCP to the point where dissent be-
came dangerous reached its fine point in the years between 
1949 and 1954. Maoist cleansing of party ranks -- called 
"rectification" -- resulted in the outright killing of 
800,000 opponents of his regime. MAO admitted to that num-
ber of victims in his February 1957 speech on contradictions 
(although the figure may be low). Killings were carried 
out on the grounds that the regime opponents were "enemies 
of the people." 
1955 KAO Kang and JAO Shu-shih, dissented from MAO's policies 
and were tried in secret proceedings conducted by LIU Shao-
ch'i and TENG Hsiao-p'ing. Following Stalin's tactics, MAO 
and his prosecuting lieutenants "proved a long history of 
dissent and conspiracy"on part of the accused. KAO, JAO 
and the seven men who fell with them (similar to the anti-
party group purge in the USSR in 1957) have never reappeared. 
KAO, the CCP says, "committed suicide." 
1956 
December 
1957 
February --
1958 
In a Peking Jen-min Jih-pao (Peoples' Daily - CCP newspaper) 
article covering Politburo discussions came a second attack 
on "the fiction of no tension between leaders and led." Dis-
agreements sufficiently serious to be the subject of Polit-
buro discussions are difficult to disguise. 
a) In a February 1957 speech MAO opened the door for non-
communist criticism of the CCP in an attempt to win over 
dissenting Chinese intellectuals. This is the famed "hundred 
flowers and hundred schools of thought" line which was launched 
for MAO by CHOU En-lai in 1956. 
b) Dissenters within the 
as "harmful to the cause 
in its criticism as well 
some of MAO's own in the 
ch'i,were included among 
party openly criticized this line 
of socialism;" the CPSU was violent 
and there were even indications that 
CCP leadership, including LIU Shao-
the dissatisfied. 
c) MAO never admitted that the CCP dissidents to his line 
were correct in their dire predictions of damage to party 
unity. He simply halted criticism in practice, supported 
it theoretically and in the "hundred flowers" revival in 
1961 permitted "debate" only on academic subjects.

1958 -- The Great Leap Forward conceived by MAO was a failure by 
1960 the fall of 1958. The commune distribution system was 
based on the fallacy that psychological and spiritual in-
centives could be substituted for material incentives as 
the principal stimulus for production. This fallacy was 
a target for criticism outside the CCP and China as well 
as inside the CCP. Some of the dissenters in the CCP were 
Politburo members including PENG Te-huai and CHTEN Yun. 
The latter had been eased out of any real role in the CCP 
by September 1959, if not before. PENG's fate (following) 
was more dramatic. 
1959 a) Marshal PENG Te-huai, China's Defense Minister in 1959, 
was the leader of an "anti-party" group in the Politburo 
who had written a letter to Moscow criticizing the Great 
Leap Forward. His second sin was to resist CCP control of 
the Army and the establishment of an "enormous untrained 
militia." His third was to protest the growing breach 
with Moscow, chief supplier of Chinese modern weapons. 
b) PENG was arrested, underwent intensive reindoctrination 
and finally wrote a "confession" divulging his wrong doings 
to the CCP. He was replaced as Minister of Defense by LIN 
Piao and most of his followers (including Army Chief of 
Staff Genern1 HUANG K'o-ch'eng) were removed from their 
party/government positions. 
1961 
The growing Sino-Soviet rift became open knowledge in 1961 
with the withdrawal of Soviet technicians from China. There 
was dissension within the CCP over China's stand against 
Khrushchev's policies even in the Politburo. (This dissent 
was part of Defense Minister PENG's crime.) The most notable 
of the other dissenters was Politburo alternate member CHANG 
Wen-t'ien: his disappearance from the scene since that time 
can apparently be explained because of his opposition to 
the anti-Soviet views of MAO and his more tractable lieutenants. 
1962 The CCP initiated a long-term campaign to combat the deterior-
Early ation of party morale. Demoralization in the ranks of the CCP 
was a result of the four years of privation connected with the 
Great Leap Forward. Implicit in this campaign itself was 
criticism of Chairman MAO since he was the architect of the 
policies. 
1962 a) CH'EN Yi, Foreign Minister of the CPR, in a series of 
August -- speeches during this period placed great stress on "subver-
September sion" in China. 
b) During the same period two Secretariat members were dropped: 
General HUANG K'o ch'eng, former PLA Chief of Staff under the

already purged (1959) Marshal PENG Te-huai and General 
T'AN Cheng, whose department in the Secretariat was be-
lieved by China watchers to have failed to curb Army crit-
icism of the CCP. 
196)4 At the Third National Peoples Congress held in Peking, 
December -- Premier CHOU En-lai's speeches on internal matters clearly 
1965 indicated continued CCP concern over popular apathy and 
January disillusionment with party programs. (In part this was a 
hangover from the Great Leap Forward period.) In the same 
speech CHOU attached signs of capitalism as evidenced in 
private plots and livestock. 
1965 a) The United Front Work Department chief, LI Wei-han was 
Spring summarily dismissed. The Department he had headed was 
party organization responsible for working with intellec-
tuals. 
b) The Minister of Culture, SHEN Yen-p'ing and several vice 
ministers were dismissed. It is believed by China observers 
that they had failed to bring the intellectuals into line. 
SHEN's past work was said to have "weakened the class strug-
gle." 
1965 LO Jul-ching, Chief of Staff of the Peoples' Liberation 
November Army, disappeared from the scene as the PLA was apparently 
readied for its role in the Cultural Revolution. 
1965 -- 1969 Shanghai newspapers launched an attack on WU Han, non-
Communist Vice Mayor of Peking and the opening gun in the 
Cultural Revolution -- now in its third tumultuous year --
was fired.

Soviet Source Says 25 Million Chinese 
Were Exterminated Between 1955 and 1965 
Literaturnaya Gazeta, the Soviet Writers' Union weekly, devotes half 
of this week's issue to a series of articles on China and the effects of 
Maoism. You find the inevitable denunciations of Peking's "anti-Soviet hys-
teria," but the main body of the dossier deals with the internal situation in 
the Chinese People's Republic. Everybody is in on the act, humorists and car-
toonists as well as reporters and photographers. There are even some documents 
of.alleged Chinese origin, whose authenticity only Literaturnaya Gazeta can 
vouch for, such as the letter from a Peking high school student called Chuo 
Yang, on the way out to the country after completing his secondary studies, 
who writes: 
"Like all my comrades, I belonged to the Red Guard. We thought we were 
making the revolution, that we were doing the right thing. But now, most of 
the young people's eyes have been opened. Many people no longer believe in 
Mao Tse-tung. But there are still a lot of people who believe in him, and who 
do not understand that he is the cause of all China's troubles." 
This recurrent theme of "China's troubles" is backed up with reams of 
statistics. We learn, for example, that "more than 25 million people" were 
exterminated in the decade from 1955 to 1965, that 30 million more were dis-
placed, and that there are 32 thousand people in the Takla-Makan concentration 
camp in the Sinkiang desert. 
A Power Struggle Among the Present Leaders 
With the same abundant seasoning of figures, the Soviet writers' weekly 
explains that "the spiritual food of the Chinese people" today consists of 
almost nothing besides the works of Mao Tse-tung, of which 3,126,000,000 copies 
have already been printed. The cult of Maoism is illustrated with selected 
examples, including two texts singing the praises of the Chinese chairman pub-
lished under the title of "Ave Mao," and an item noting that all the gold dust 
produced in the Nanking and Suchow workshops is now being used to gild busts of 
Mao and to print the titles on his Little Red Book. 
In such a context, political anPlysis is scarcely concerned with nuances. 
The writers' weekly accuses Peking of "repeating the cruel history of the feudal 
despots who ruled by fire and sword." And yet, everything is not all that simple 
in Chinese politics. Literaturnaya Gazeta says that "we should not take serious-
1y everything Peking tells us about the alleged unity among the Chinese rulers 
We are witnessing a complicated and largely secret struggle for power between 
two major. opposing cliques, a struggle between two clans, that of Mao and his 
wife, Chiang Ching, and that of Lin Piao and his wife, Yeh Chun." You can 
glimpse the horizons opened up.to future historians and chroniclers .by the hy-
pothesis of this summit struggle for power among the leaders of the Chinese 
Communist Party.

Without searching for over-subtle meaning in these propaganda texts, we 
can note that they give the Soviet reader a double picture of China. First they 
are shown a "monstrous" country, subject to an intolerable regime, one that runs 
against nature, thrust by its leaders into a manner of life that is the anti-
thesis of the aspirations of the Soviet people. While it is de rigeur to make 
a distinction between the "good" Chinese people and the "bad" Maoists, it is by 
no means certain that the general Soviet public will notice this nuance, and con-
tinue to rain it its racist feelings' which aro all too ready to crop out again. 
The second image is that of a China by no means as powerful as it claims 
to be, weakened by its tribulations, and consequently far less formidable than 
the USSR might once have feared. This theme is relatively new, but it has al-
ready been mentioned once, just after the 13 August Sino-Soviet incident on the 
Sinkiang border. At that time, an editorial in the Defense Ministry journal, 
Krasnaya Zvezda, said that Peking's mobilization campaign in anticipation of a 
possible war with the USSR posed no serious threat to the Soviet people. 
"It goes without saying," the Defense Ministry editorial went on, "that 
there is a very great distance between the inflammatory statements of the Peking 
adventurers and their real capacities.1! Some observers concluded from this that 
Moscow is trying to keep the fear of China created by the border incidents and 
the way they have been handled from generating panic among the people.

CHINA'S GRAIN RESERVES 
CPYRGHT 
The general reader of Tho China Quarterly may well think it an imposi-
tion to be treated to a public debate on so technical a subject as 
Chin's grain stocks. May I as his indulgence in vlow of the importance 
of the issue raised by Kang Chao (The China Quarterly, No. 37 
(January-March 1969), pp. 139-140). The question of the size and move-
ment of the national stockpile is indeed an integral part of any assess-
ment of China's grain policy. 
Unfortunately Kang Chao does not define his use of the term stock-
pile or state reserve. Properly defined, it can only refer to that amount 
of grain which is kept in government storage beyond the normal stock 
in the pipeline. 
In a country in which different grains are harvested at different 
times of the year, substantial quantities are bound to lie in godowns 
in various parts of the country. They do not necessarily form part of 
a genuine carry-over. It is perfectly possible that 12.69 million tons of 
"grain reserves" existed in mid-summer 1953 and 28.84 million tons 
in mid-summer 1957?the time of the statistical change-over from one 
crop year to the next?but they were not necessarily more than tem-
porary stocks; nor need the apparent increase in "grain reserves" by 
16.15 million tons reflect anything more than an early harvest of summer 
grains in the altogether favourable year 1957. 
The "grain reserves" which, according to Viscount Montgomery's 
account, were completely exhausted by the end of September 1961?
and well they might be after two man-made disasters following the 
Great Leap Forward?are unlikely to have been in the same category as 
those quoted for mid-summer 1953 and "1957. Difficult though it is, 
we must try to compare like with like. 
In estimating the likely size of government carry-over stocks, it is 
worth recalling that some four-fifths of China's consumers produce 
most of the grain they need. Let us assume that present gross supplies 
of grains (and potatoes in grain equivalent) for human consumption 
total, say, 150 million metric tons equal to, say, 170 kilos of milled 
grain (at 80 rather than 85 per cent. average milling rate) per head per 
year. Against this, the requirements of the consumers living outside 
grain self-sufficient areas are unlikely to amount to more than, say, 
25 million metric tons per annum, or 2 million tons per month, equal 
to about one-sixth of total grain supplies for human consumption. 
Only in very exceptional circumstances will the government have 
to meet any of the needs of the self-suppliers; its normal concern will 
be with the regular flow of grains to those who are not self-suppliers. 
To prevent any breakdown in this flow, the government ought to be 
able to draw at any time on a minimum reserve of, say, 5 million tons 
or 10 weeks' supply for those who are not self-suppliers. A stockpile 
of 10 million tons or 20 weeks' supply would entail a capital investment 
in grain storage facilities which a country such as China would probably 
deny itself?except when laying in a strategic reserve designed to meet . 
eventualities other than those arising in peacetime.

? 
As to China's programme of grain imports, this?like the storage 
programme?ought to be related to the needs of the non-self-suppliers. 
As Professor Ta-Chung Liu rightly points out, the Chinese Government 
spends roughly 30 per cent. of its annual foreign exchange earnings on 
the purchase abroad of. say. 5 to 6 million tons of wheat and flour every 
year. It does this so as to meet the needs, for a period of 10 to 12 
weeks, of those who are not producing the grain they eat; or, to put it 
in another way, tome 25 to 30 million Mute depend entirely on 
foreign grain supplies throughout the year. 
This is a problem of such magnitude that it can hardly be solved 
by squeezing every member of the country's 125 million cultivators' 
families to the tune of 75 calories or so a day. Policies other than 
those of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution would 
have to be introduced if a rate of saving even as modest as that of 
3 to 4 per cent. of the daily diet were to be extracted from every one of 
China's vain prriiiiiri.rs /mad their familloa.

THE IMPACT OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION ON 
THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY MACHINE 
CHARLES NEUHAUSER 
After more than two years of intense activity, a good deal of 
first-class melodrama, and an enormous outpouring of rhetoric, the Great 
Proletarian Cultural Revolution continues to baffle most observers?and it 
it would appear most Chinese as well. No two students of the Chinese 
scene seem to agree entirely on what has thus far happened, or on just 
why it has happened. Nor is the evidence available to those outside the 
Chinese mainland in any way conclusive; it is at best contradictory, and 
often misleading. Too much has happened, and too quickly, to form a 
wholly coherent picture of events. And we are of course much too close to 
those events to see them in full perspective. 
One problem is that a great many forces, pressures and problems have 
come together to produce the present upheaval. Another is that the main 
protagonists in China appear to be reacting more or less on an ad hoc basis 
to pressures and currents released by the Cultural Revolution itself?pres-
sures that may have been by no means fully expected and that can be only 
dimly perceived by observers abroad. Nevertheless, certain aspects of the 
convulsion do appear to be of major importance and can perhaps be isolated 
for a tentative examination. One such aspect is the Chinese Communist 
Party organization itself. For it seems reasonably certain that problems 
within the party were a major precipitating factor in bringing on the Cul-
tural Revolution,' and that the party machine has been a principal victim 
of the "revolution." The party has suffered a trauma easily the equal of the 
Long March, but one from which it is unlikely to recover as quickly or 
with such elan. Indeed, a better parallel may be the confusion and debilita-
tion caused by the abortive insurrectory movement that accompanied and 
followed the break with the KMT in the late 1920s. 
We should, however, be clear about one thing at the outset: the party 
as such has not been under attack at any time in the course of the Cultural' 
Revolution. No attempt has been made to deny its central legitimizing role 
as the "vanguard of the proletariat" and the font of political authority in" 
China. Rather, it is the party machine, the organizational command struc-

466 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND THE PARTY 
ture, that has been battered out of recognition in the past two years. But 
it is of course true that in any real political sense the two are inseparable. 
Political authority has flowed down from the chairman, the Politburo and 
the Central Committee through the organizational machine to the levels 
where policy is translated into practice. And an attack on the party machine 
of the scope and intensity of that which has just taken place must not only 
undermine the morale of party members but also greatly reduce the stature 
of the party itself in the eyes of the general populace, and to some extent 
at least bring into question the very legitimacy of the party as the arbiter 
of Chinese political and social life. 
The attack has been devastating. Of the 11 members and alternates on 
the Politburo who were politically active in 1965, 8 have fallen by the way-
side. Of 11 politically active members of the Central Committee Secretariat, 
only 3 have survived, and none appears to be performing secretarial work. 
Of 10 known directors of Central Committee departments and bureaus, only 
one appears to be active. 
The Central Committee itself has been equally hard hit. Some 63 mem-
bers of the Central Committee promulgated in 1958 were politically active 
in 1965; of these, 34 (52%), have been shunted aside, vilified and in many 
cases "dragged out" and disgraced since the summer of 1966. Another 9, 
or 14%, have been under severe Red Guard attack and apparently are or 
have been in deep political trouble. Of 72 politically active alternate mem-
bers of the Central Committee, the figures are 27 (or 38%) and 29 (40%) 
respectively. While some of these people will no doubt survive the Red Guard 
assaults or will later be rehabilitated, the scope of the attack can be com-
pared only to that directed against the 1934 Central Committee of the 
Soviet Party, which in the years of the Great Purge lost some 70% of its 
members2?although in China the destruction has for the most part been 
merely political rather than physical. 
At middle levels the picture is bleaker still. Only 9 (20%) of the 45 
provincial party 1st and 2nd secretaries known to be active in 1965 can 
be identified today. Of these, many appear in supernumerary roles, and 
relatively few seem to be performing meaningful political activities. The 
provincial party committees themselves have not existed as organized, ac-
tive bodies since February 1967. The same is probably true of the regional 
party bureaus, of which nothing has been heard since early 1967. Principal 
party secretaries in the regional bureaus have without exception been 
shunted aside or "dragged out" and disgraced. At hsien and municipal and 
at hsiang, commune and district levels, the situation is probably not much 
different, although all party committees may not have been formally "dis-
solved" as at the provincial levels. 
Information regarding the basic levels is spotty and contradictory. It is

here, of course, that the vast bulk of party membership is tp be found. 
Fragmentary information suggests that party committees and cells in fac-
tories have been hard hit. Lane committees and party fractions in produc-
tion brigades and work teams have probably suffered much less in terms 
of actual Red Guard assault. Brigades and teams have been formally ex-
empted from Red Guard attack,8 but directives from the center apparently 
no longer carry the weight they once did. Moreover, with the party's com-
mand channels short-circuited at the provincial and hsien levels, basic-level 
cadres are probably largely inactive or are operating with the sketchiest of 
instructions?a situation that in some ways may resemble that of outlying 
guerrilla groups during the anti-Japanese war. Natural leaders probably 
remain in command in the rural areas, but this is precisely because they 
are natural leaders and not because they have .the weight of the party be-
hind them. 
At the lower levels, particularly in the rural areas, the full impact of the 
Cultural Revolution may not have been felt until well into 1967?particu-
larly during the upsurge in "revolutionary activity" that took place in April 
- and May of that year. But at the middle and upper levels of the party ap-
paratus, the damage had already been done. The assault on the party ma-
chine reached its climax in December 1966-January 1967, and despite bit-
ter arguments about so-called "false seizures of power" in the course of the 
"January revolution," essentially little more than mopping up operations 
appear to have taken place at these levels since that time. 
? In February, with the demise of the provincial party committees, local 
power passed into the hands of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)?es-
sentially to the regional and district military commanders. In most cases 
it still remains there. The PLA has also assumed many of the party's func-
tions in propaganda work and is performing at least part of the party's 
former supervisory role in the economic sphere. But this is clearly an un-
natural situation. That it has persisted for over a year is a measure of the 
enormous difficulties caused by the breakdown of the party machine and 
the resulting fragmentation of institutions of political authority and block-
age, of many normal channels of political communication. The year 1967 
has seen a number of experiments designed to bring a degree of order out 
of the present chaos through the establishment of new political and ad-
ministrative institutions. But these experiments, tenuous and hesitant at 
best, have very largely been vitiated by powerful forces pressing for still 
more "revolution." 
Nevertheless, in the wake of the turn toward moderation that began in 
September 1967, a new emphasis on "party-building"?which implies at 
least a partial rebuilding of the party machine and the rehabilitation of 
many party cadres?has been apparent. Thus far this effort does not appear 
to have gone very far. Precisely because it presages a return to normality

468 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION A'Nq THE PARTY 
it is opposed by those "revolutionaries" who in the past two years have 
acquired a stake in, and an emotional commitment to, continued ferment; 
and because it portends a rehabilitation of cadres shunted aside n the 
Cultural Revolution, it poses a political threat to some of those political 
leaders who orchestrated and supported the attack on the cadres in the 
first place. 
Yet although the effort at party-building is likely to be slow and painful, 
it may be possible already to perceive the shape of things to come. 'While 
it is clear that some portion of the Red Guards will eventually be drawn 
into the party, nevertheless at the lower levels a considerable proportion 
of pre-1966 party members are likely to survive or be rehabilitated. In form, 
the party structure probably will not look much different from the way it did 
in the past, although a degree of streamlining and pruning is likely. Never-
theless, the Cultural Revolution has exacerbated rather than rooted out di-
visions within the party, and resentments born in the turbulent events of 
the past two years will be extremely hard to overcome. Above all, party 
morale has been shattered and cannot easily be repaired, while the party's 
claim to unchallenged political authority and political infallibility has at 
least to some degree been damaged. In these very important respects the 
consequences of the past two chaotic years are likely to be very great in-
deed and will almost certainly plague Chinese political life for years to 
come. 
It seems increasingly evident as more material comes to light in the 
course of the Cultural Revolution that for several years prior to its begin-
ning Mao had felt the Chinese revolution was losing steam, that there 
was the distinct possibility that "revisionism" of the sort espoused by the 
post-Stalinist Soviet Union was a threat not only within the international 
Communist movement but also within China itself, and that the revolution-
ary ideals for which he had long fought were in danger of becoming lost 
or downgraded as the Chinese Communist Party became enmeshed in the 
difficult job of nation-building. Both old party members who had fought 
against the KMT and newer recruits who had joined the party since 1949 
had failed to sufficiently "transform their world outlook": their priorities 
were wrong. And because this was so, there was a danger that the party 
would become increasingly divorced from the "masses," whose untapped 
"revolutionary enthusiasm" remained high. 
Mao apparently felt that his plans for releasing this revolutionary po-
tential were being blocked by powerful figures within the party who felt 
his ideas were anachronistic. Moreover, the party bureaucracy, growing 
over the years, had itself become a deadweight, with bureaucratic methods 
stifling revolutionary initiative. It would seem that Mao was at least partly 
right on both counts, but the important thing is that he believed himself 
to be thwarted, and felt that something had to be done about it. This meant 
shaking up the party and removing a number of its important leaders. This

surely was a prime aim of the Cultural Revolution from the start. 
That start can probably be dated from September 1965, when Mao gave 
the signal at an acrimonious work session of the Central Committee for a 
strong attack in the cultural field against revisionism. But parallel to the 
well-known attacks on literary figures that followed this meeting there also 
developed a campaign directed at hsien-level party committees, the first such 
concerted and extended campaign to involve party organizational questions 
since 1962. Criticism of hsien-level party committees reached floodtide in 
early 1966, but interestingly enough died away abruptly just when the grow-
ing clamor against Wu Han and Teng T'o indicated unmistakably that the 
Peking Party Committee was in deep trouble. 
The central charge against the hsien committees was that they had be-
come divorced from the masses?that party members had failed to "trans-
form their world outlook," had succumbed to bureaucratic inertia, and 
would in consequence have to submit to open criticism at mass meetings in 
which large numbers of non-party persons would participate. This in itself 
was unremarkable, but along with the usual Maoist slogans a number of 
other, rather different ideas were introduced into the discussions in the 
party press. One was that to eradicate problems at the hsien level, party 
members would have to supervise their subordinates more closely and take 
into account specific local conditions and special situations in implementing 
party directives4?in effect, hsien committees were told to act with greater 
bureaucratic efficiency and pragmatism. One len-min Iih-pao article went 
so far as to suggest that the problem was not "transformation of world out-
look" at all, but rather the need for better understanding of work condi-
tions and modern scientific procedures.3 Moreover, the press reported that 
the idea of open criticism of party members by non-party masses was 
strongly resisted.? Furthermore, in the course of the campaign a new hero 
was introduced for emulation?one Chiao Yu-lu, a hsien party secretary 
and the first emulation hero not to have a PLA background. 
All of this suggests that the campaign was less a Maoist initiative than 
a rear-guard action on the part of the party bureaucracy to protect itself in 
the face of growing pressure. This episode suggests several conclusions; 
first, that problems involving the party organization were at issue from 
the earliest days of the Cultural Revolution; second, that there was con-
siderable resistance within the party machine to ideas of uninterrupted rev-
olution that would sacrifice the rather pragmatic tasks of nation-building to 
less clearly focused ideological concerns; and third, that while "waving 
the Red Flag" of reform of party organizational methods, important ale.

ments within the party apparatus?who apparently had some control of 
the Central Committee's own journal, fen-min Iih-pao?were evidently will-
ing and able to fight to protect party prerogatives, particularly with regard 
to non-party intrusion into party affairs. 
These divisions and tensions became at once more apparent and acute 
following the fall of P'eng Chen in May 1966. P'eng's political demise led 
quite aaturally to omplete ahake.up of the Peking party municipal or-
ganization, into which Mao was later to claim "you could not drive a pin." 
If this were all, however, the implications for the party machine as a whole 
would not necessarily have been very great or immediate. In fact, because 
cultural issues were at least formally involved in the protracted dispute 
that ended in P'eng's fall, a thoroughgoing purge of the party's propa-
ganda, educational and cultural "systems" also could not be avoided. This 
was a move of cardinal importance, and it had major consequences almost 
at once. The purge was conducted through the medium of "operation teams" 
which carried out on-the-spot "investigations" of accused individuals and 
attempted to lead struggle sessions against them in a manner reminiscent 
of the land reform program of the late 1940s and early 1950s. This was 
only ostensibly a concession to Maoist principles, for the "operation teams" 
were directly controlled by the party apparatus, and Liu Shao-ch'i and 
Teng Hsiao-p'ilig apparently took a direct hand in running them.7 These 
teams were opposed?often in pitched battle?by less well-organized groups 
of students responsive to appeals that had begun to appear in the official 
press calling for unbridled revolutionary ferment. 
- Two issues were at stake here. One involved the question of how the 
purge was to be conducted?that is, was it to remain entirely an operation 
run by the party secretariat or was the secretariat to be bypassed, at least 
in part, in favor of direct action by the "masses," who were in turn respon-
sive to and probably manipulated by forces anxious to shake up the bureau-
cratic machine?principally Mao himself. The second issue involved the 
question of who exactly was to be purged. Although some kind of purge 
could not be avoided, if it could be kept within carefully controlled bounds 
the damage could be limited. This apparently was what Liu Shao-ch'i and 
Teng Hsiao-p'ing attempted.8 
There was nothing subtle or indirect about the battles over the conduct 
of the "operation teams"; the issues were now out in the open. But the 
course of events had raised the stakes, which were now nothing less than 
who was to control the party and how it was to be run. Yet at the same 
time the conflict was personalized, and in such a situation Liu's prestige 
was no match for Mao's. At the 11th Central Committee Plenum in August 
1966 both Liu and Teng were downgraded and removed from effective

power, although no formal censure was publicly pronounced. But by noilw' 
the struggle had greatly expanded. To this point it had been a contest of 
giants, in which Liu Shao-ch'i, Teng Hsiao-p'ing and Peng Chen ha 4 been 
principal protagonists. Now a-much wider range of characters was invnived. 
Liu and Teng's closest associates would of course be pushed aside, but the 
episode of the "operation teams" had undoubtedly deepened Mao's sus-
picion of the entire party apparatus, which would now have to bear the 
consequences of his distrust. 
The slogan "95 percent of Party cadres are good or comparatively good" 
had been incorporated into the 16-point decision issued by the 11th Plenum, 
but it was clear almost at once that it would be honored more in the breach 
than in the observance. Yet in light of both the size of the impending house-
cleaning and of the events of the spring and early summer, it was also clear 
that the party apparatus could not be trusted to purge itself; hence the Red 
? Guards, successors to the semi-organized bands that had hauled the "opera-
tion teams" in May, June and July. But the Red Guards were a heterogene-
ous group, composed mainly of youngsters, many of whom were not party 
members, and initially at least loosely organized and relatively loosely con-
\ trolled. Moreover, the undifferentiated call to hit at "persons in authority," 
which now began to be heard, was certain to create a good deal of con-
fusion in itself. Under these conditions, the forthcoming struggle was bound 
to be a messy affair. 
It should not be thought, however, that the attacks on "persons in au-
thority" were a wholly spontaneous manifestation of "revolutionary fer-
ment." Mao and those in his immediate entourage on whom he relied 
moved quickly to channel and direct the Red Guard movement. The extra-
ordinary number of meetings at which Red Guard groups were addressed 
and admonished by major leaders was one aspect of this effort. Another was 
the establishment of the Small Group for the Cultural Revolution of the Cen-
tral Committee, which clearly was given the task of overseeing and coordinat-
ing Red Guard activities. Theoretically subordinate to the Central Com-
mittee, this body was soon speaking with an independent and highly au-
thoritive voice.? Its members were all almost entirely dependent on Mao's 
personal patronage and at this stage at least could be considered extensions 
of his personality." 
Measures to control Red Guard activities were varied. The Red Guards 
were given permission to use the railways and the state telegraphic net-
work for at ,best nominal charges.11 This was a virtual necessity as Red

CPYRQHT 
Guard activities expanded, but it placed the "rebels" in a dependent re-
lationship to the central authorities, who could revoke these privileges at 
any time, and provided a degree of leverage of Red Guard actions.0fficial 
permission was needed for major demonstrations against "persons in au-
thority,"12 which meant that Red Guard targets had to be officially approved 
in advance either by authorities on the spot or by the Small Group in 
Peking. Red Guard newspapers were published on state and party 'presses, 
using state stocks of newsprint,1? which meant that at least a degree of 
control could be exercised over what was printed in these papers. Above 
all, after an initial period of permissiveness, fairly strict controls were es-
tablished over the collection, collation and distribution of "black materials" 
?documented charges of wrongdoings to be brought against Red Guard 
targets.14 Much of this material could only have come from archives un-
available to the general public; if some of it was "manufactured" for the 
occasion?as was almost certainly the case?this could only be done by 
persons with a detailed knowledge of high-level party affairs, which would 
rule out nearly all the Red Guards themselves. Moreover, leaders of the 
major Red Guard organizations were undoubtedly in close behind-the-
scenes contact with members of the Small Group for the Cultural Revolu-
tion, and transmitted instructions from them down to lower levels through 
an increasingly elaborate organizational structure. 
Nevertheless, anomalies were certainly not uncommon. Discipline in the 
hastily organized Red Guard groups was by no means as well-enforced as 
in traditional mass organizations, much less as in the party itself. Forged 
"black materials" were put in use, although usually this probably involved 
lower-level targets." Unplanned disputes between local "authorities" and 
militant Red Guards, or between Red Guard groups themselves, frequently 
escalated, involving peripheral figures and no doubt occasionally leading the 
central authorities to approve new targets for attack only after the attacks 
had in fact already begun. In other instances, important leaders in Peking 
were clearly divided over the question of whether or not the assault on a 
given individual should be pursued or curtailed." However, these disputes 
generally involved party figures whose duties did not directly impinge on 
the management of the party machine. By and large, party secretaries, 
members of central party organs, and members of lower-level bodies con-
"Denial of this permission by local and provincial officials was later considered

cerned with party affairs?the backbone of the party apparat?were fair 
game. 
Confusion among the Red Guards and their mentors was 'mirrored by 
an equal confusion among those under attack. It would be hard to over-
estimate the shock, anger and dismay felt by party cadres at all levels as 
the Red Guard attacks widened. In Sian, for example, cadres accustomed 
to defending and protoottn4 party prerogatives and tha avidity of the 
party organization felt that the Red Guard attacks on leading party bodies 
could only be counterrevolutionary." This undoubtedly was a typical re-
action. Precisely because the attacks were so widespread, because the Red 
Guard targets were generally members of the leading locn1 party organs, 
because the Red Guards themselves stood outside the regular party struc-
ture, and because the most militant "rebels" were frequently led by "out-
siders" from Peking," the Red Guard movement appeared to be a sinister 
effort to destroy party prestige and authority and to sweep away entirely 
the party as an institution. The reaction of the local cadres was violent 
and extremely hostile. Militant Red Guards were attacked, beaten up and 
jailed. By October, Mao himself admitted that the movement was largely 
misunderstood in the provinces, and he called on leading party provincial 
figures to cooperate with the Red Guards even though they and their sub-
ordinates understood the Cultural Revolution only imperfectly." 
But if individual middle-level cadres reacted instinctively to what they 
felt to be a challenge to party prerogatives and prestige, most upper-level 
party bureaucrats in the provincial,- regional and important municipal bu-
reaus felt that they understood what was happening all too well. They were 
the immediate targets of the Red Guard attacks, and they moved to protect 
? themselves as best they could. For them the central question was no longer 
that of outside interference in party affairs or the rationalization of bureau-
cratic procedures; it was simply self-preservation. Utilizing the resentment 
felt against the Red Guards at all levels of the party machine, and probably 
drawing on a resentment of "outsiders" felt by wider circles of the local 
populace, the provincial party chieftains organized Red Guard groups of 
their own, responsive to their own orders and ready to defend the party 
organs under attack by the militants sent out from Peking. Some "rebel" 
groups were declared counterrevolutionary.20 Many soon found themselves 
virtually under siege. 
7 This counterattack was surprisingly strong and sustained; it appears to 
have virtually stalled the Cultural Revolution for several months. In essence 
it appears to have been an instinctive reaction to an overwhelming chat.

474 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND THE PARTY 
lenge on the part of provincial party officials; there is no evidence it was 
centrally directed in any sense. But this show of strength sealed the fate 
of more than the individual party bureaucrats who organized the counter-
attack. When the impasse was broken at the beginning of 1967, the target 
was not so much individuals within the party as the party machine itself. The 
call to "seize power," sounded on January 1, 1967, was in effect a signal 
to dismantle the party structure. 
The Red Guard methods of attack were primarily propagandistic. Hand-
bills, wall posters and unofficial newspapers kept up a drumfire of violent 
criticism of chosen targets. This written propaganda was supplemented by 
mass meetings, demonstrations, occasional "invasions" of party and state 
offices, and confrontations with the targets of attack at struggle meetings 
held under Red Guard auspices. This program put leading party officials 
under considerable pressure, but it was insufficient actually to dislodge 
them from their entrenched positions. In any event, the removal of major 
officials required authorization from Peking.21 So long as regional provin-
cial and other local officials remained in office, they kept the most important 
levers of political authority and administration in their own hands. In their 
official capacities they could organize Red Guard forces of their own and 
solve the logistical problem?food, housing and the like?of keeping them 
in the field. They could, moreover, encourage factory workers and others 
to make excessive demands on Peking for higher wages and other ameni-
ties.22 But to remove these officials wholesale was to invite chaos, for they 
played a crucial role in administering both the state and the party. Hence. 
the stalemate in the autumn of 1966. 
Mao's solution to this dilemma was drastic. The Gordian knot was cut 
at the provincial level, where resistance to the Red Guards had been con-
centrated in the period following the 11th Plenum. Both provincial state 
governments and provincial party committees ceased to exist in any mean-
ingful sense. Regional party bureaus apparently also vanished at this time. 
But while provincial state functions were generally taken over by the mili-
tary after a brief hiatus, the short circuit in the party chain of command 
was allowed to persist. It has not yet been repaired. 
The "January revolution" of course encompassed far more than an as-
sault on provincial "organs of power." But it worked differently in Peking 
than in the provinces, and differently when applied to state organs than to 
party organs. In Peking, no assault was launched against either the State 
Council or the Central Committee as such, although members of both groups 
fell from power in considerable numbers. Individual ministers and vice. 
premiers came under attack for "counter-revolutionary" activities, usually 
within their own ministries. A few members of the State Council?most

"Few such decisions have evidently been published, but there are numerous refer-
ences to central directives on personnel questions in Red Guard publications.

notably Chou En-lai himself?escaped unscathed; several other ministers 
were severely attacked but managed to remain in position; still more were 
shunted aside." But in no case was a ministry itself "dissolved." The work 
of the ministries went forward, although under adverse conditionEk for un-
questionably a considerable number of lesser functionaries fell to Red 
Guard assaults, and ministerial functions were frequently affected by Red 
Guard disruptions within the ministries themselves. Several ministries, 
particularly those dealing with transportation and communications, were 
"taken over" by the PLA in February, but work has apparently gone on 
under loose military supervision. 
Party organs in the capital were even harder hit. There have been no re-
corded announcements of the "dissolution" of central party organs, but no 
official has been identified performing party functions since January 1967. 
Subordinate bureaus of the Central Committee seem uniformly inactive. 
Only one director of a party bureau appears to have survived the on-
slaught;24 it is likely that some lesser functionaries within the bureaus have 
also survived, but it is hard to believe that they have much meaningful work 
to perform. The party's organizational bureau may be hors de combat en-
The party secretariat has not fared? much better. Three secretaries 
still appear in public, but never in connection with their secretarial functions. 
None has been identified as a party secretary since January 1967. In fact, 
virtually no party official was publicly identified in a strictly party role?
not even as a member of the Central Committee?between January and 
October 1967. 
Nor can the state provincial organs be identified after January 1967, al-
though no formal "dissolution" was ever announced. A considerable num-
ber of provincial governors were attacked and presumably deposed as 
"among the small handful following the capitalist road," but minor func-
tionaries probably continued during January to perform their tasks?large-
ly by rote, since it is unlikely that many instructions were transmitted down 
from Peking. Nevertheless, confusion?or even a considerable degree of 
chaos?must have attended state business at the provincial level through-
out the month. Since the state ministries continued to function in Peking 
and presumably at lower levels as well, direct-line communications remained 
relatively unaffected in this sphere. However, some working form of state 
authority at the provincial level was obviously necessary if decisions made 
in Peking were to be implemented, or if even routine administrative work 
was to be performed over any period of time. These considerations almost 
certainly played a major part in the decision to bring the PLA into the 
Cultural Revolution, a decision announced on January 23.25 In February, 
following this move, military control commissions were set up in virtually

every province in China.20 These commissions took over the task of civil 
administration in the provinces, supplanting the provincial governors and 
supervising the work of state provincial functionaries, many of whom un-
doubtedly continued to carry on their normal duties. Control commissions 
may also have been established in the very few provinces that established 
Revolutionary Committees formally reeognized by Peking, although in these 
cases direct administrative responsibility, if not political power, apparently 
rested with the Revolutionary Conunittccs. 
In many respects this situation resembled that which obtained in the 
years immediately following the Conununist takeover, when military con-
trol commissions also ran provincial affairs. But in this case there is one 
major difference: there are no provincial party committees to check on the 
work of the control commissions. The provincial party committees were 
formally dissolved.27 References to them after January 1967 invariably speak 
of "former provincial party committees." No individual has been identified 
performing strictly party work on the provincial level. Since January, no 
communication from the central authorities has been addressed to a pro-
vincial party committee: addressees are invariably regional and district 
military commands, military control commissions, and, where they exist, 
provincial revolutionary committees." 
A similar situation appears to exist with regard to municipal party corn-
mittees. The regional party committees and party committees at the hsien 
? also do not appear to be functioning, but here the situation is not so dear 
cut." Many hsien committees may have been dissolved, but this does not 
appear to have been quite so formal a process as that which took place at 
the provincial level. But certainly, so far as can be observed from a distance, 
no significant work is being performed by either regional or hsien commit-
tees. In any event, in a party organized in the way it was in China prior to 
1967, a complete break in the party chain of command would render organs 
at a lower level ineffective and organs at a higher level impotent. 
Not all members of the various provincial committees were disgraced in 
January, although virtually all provincial first secretaries active in 1965 
were condemned. Several second and third secretaries showed up as mem-
bers of Revolutionary Committees or "preparatory groups" late in 1967; 
"No announcement of the establishment of these bodies was made at the time, al-
though frequent references to the commissions soon began to appear in official and Red 
Guard publications. 
"See, for example, "Record of the Seizure of Power," Kuangchou Hung-wei-ping, 
February 17, 1967. 
"Red Guard publications, as well as wall posters, carry the texts of many of these 
directives, including addresses. 
"Regional Bureaus were organs of the Central Committee and therefore theoretically 
inviolable. Power was "seized" in the "organs directly under" the several bureaus?i.e., 
in the various administrative departments of the bureaus themselves. Since January 
1967 the Regional bureaus appear to have been totally bypassed. Reorganization of the 
subordinate administrative units now seems to have begun, but the bureaus themselves 
still have no real political significance.

but they appeared to play supernumerary rather than leading rule:, ;La 
these bodies. Still more former members of the provincial committees are 
apparently politically inactive. 
The consequences of "seizure of power" began to be felt almost immedi-
ately. The Red Guards took their role as "revolutionary successors" very 
seriously, and in many places apparently attempted to step into ;the shoes 
of the party cadres they had displaced. This came close to being an un-
mitigated disaster on two counts: first, untrained youths proved inade-
quate replacements for experienced party bureaucrats, and second, the 
numerous and fragmented Red Guard groups, prone to disputes from 
their inception, now began to quarrel bitterly over division of the spoils. 
The Center soon found it necessary to remind the "rebels" of the virtue of 
humility and discipline. 
Since the Red Guards could not perform administrative and supervisory 
tasks by themselves?and in many cases probably not at, all?it was soon 
clear that many of the cadres so recently shunted aside would have to re-
turn to the job. But this raised new problems. First, the cadres themselves 
were reluctant to resume their old posts; they had just been through the 
mill, and did not wish to repeat the experience. Second, the "rebels" were 
not anxious to see them return, since this meant that newly won power and 
authority would have to be shared. Full of revolutionary rectitude, they 
claimed that only those who had "rebelled" from the first deserved re-
habilitation. Again the Center was obliged to press the line that most cadres 
were comparatively good, that mistakes could be repeated and corrected, 
'and that it made little difference when an individual cadre had first seen 
the light. 
A further complication arose from the first tentative and rather makeshift 
efforts to rebuild a viable administrative structure in the provinces. From 
the first, Peking saw military rule as a temporary expedient to be replaced 
by something that would invite the active cooperation, support and partici-
pation both of a sufficient number of former cadres to ensure efficient ad-
ministration and of the vast majority of the revolutionary rebels. Not sur-
prisingly, this reconciliation of old and new?the vehicle for which was the 
Revolutionary Committee?was difficult to achieve. 
In the wake of the "January revolution," bodies calling themselves "Rev-
olutionary Committees" sprang up all over China at all levels. Most of these 
bodies were soon accused by militant Red Guards of being nothing but a 
false front behind which party "power-holders," who had engineered false 
"seizures of power," continued to operate. In many cases there was prob-
ably more than a grain of truth in these charges, but the party officials in-
volved soon discovered that they were merely operating in a vacuum. Real 
power now rested in the hands of the military control commissions, who 
received and implemented instructions and directives from Peking,.bypass-

the vine. Only in Heilungkiang, Shantung, Shensi, Kweichow and in the 
autonomous municipality of Shanghai did Ped;: recognize authentic Rev-
olutionary Committees. Below the provincial level, authentic Revolutionary 
Committees were nonexistent. 
In form, these new bodies were "triple alliances," that is, they inoluded 
representatives of the Red Guards (who first had to form a "great alliance" 
of smaller individual Red Guard groups which could not send repreienta-
tives directly to the Revolutionary Committees), "old cadres," and the mili-
tary. In practice, the military probably had a commanding voice in these 
bodies, ruling indirectly rather than directly as in the case of the military 
control commissions.3? But from the start there were anomalies. In Shang-
hai, the leading figure in fact as well as in form was Chang Ch'iin-chiao, an 
authentic "rebel" and a member of the Central Committee's Small Group 
for the Cultural Revolution." Even more interesting, in Heilungkiang, the 
first province to establish a Revolutionary Committee, the leading figure was 
P'an Fu-sheng, an "old cadre" and provincial first secretary before the 
"seizure of power." P'an and Wei Kuo-ch'ing in Kwangsi were the only 
provincial first secretaries to survive the January onslaught without signi-
ficant loss of power or status." In the remaining provinces former provin-
cial secretaries were also included as members of the new committees, but 
they were lesser figures and probably performed little more than symbolic 
roles as examples of reconciled cadres. Minor functionaries who had form-
erly worked in the party provincial committees probably continued to per-
form similar tasks within the new Revolutionary Committees, but the fre-
quent appeals in February and March for "old cadres" to come forward 
and declare for the Cultural Revolution suggests that persons in this cate-
gory were not very numerous. 
The Revolutionary Committees, insofar as they were more than merely 
a facade behind which the military made the major decisions, were pri-
marily administrative organs, replacing the former provincial governorates. 
Many tasks formerly performed by the provincial party committees no 
longer had such meaning, in any event. Internal party administration ob-
viously was out of the question; the major task of supervising and carrying 
out propaganda work had very largely passed to the PLA and in some re-
spects to the Red Guard organizations. Supervision of the work of the pro-
vincial organs of central ministries could not have been very meaningful; 
"The precise relationship of the military to the early Revolutionary Committees is not 
entirely clear. P'an Fu-sheng in Heilungkiang, and Chang Ch'iin-ehiao in Shanghai, 
quickly assumed the posts of political commissar to the leading military command in 
their respective areas. P'an has been closely associated with military figures since Janu-
ary 1967, and PLA personnel have played important roles in both areas. The East China 
Fleet command has been increasingly important in Shanghai in recent months. Wei 
Kuo-ch'ing acted only as PLA political commissar until the formation of the Kwangsi 
"preparatory group" in December 1967. 
"The Shanghai situation has in many respects been unique. 
"Both Chang Ktto-hua in Tibet and Wang En-mao in Sinkiang were commanders of 
their respective military regions and had troops at their disposal.

in the economic sphere this responsibility was shared with the PLA.88 
Moreover, the very few Revolutionary Committees in existence in the early 
months of 1967 had come into being very suddenly; members of the new 
bodies had clearly been co-opted from above in the heat of the 4:n1-lent. A 
great deal of sorting out had to be done, particularly with regard to the 
participation of Red Guard representatives on the committees, for the sud-
den formation of "revolutionary great alliances" had papered over rather 
than removed deep-seated differences among the various Red Guard groups. 
Indeed, the very existence of the new committees, and more important, 
the prospect that additional committees would be formed in other provinces, 
exacerbated these differences and in fact so envenomed the disputes be-
tween Red Guard organizations that as a practical matter the formation of 
workable "revolutionary great alliances" was in most places out of the 
question. Red Guard groups argued over which individuals were to become 
"revolutionary" representatives on the Revolutionary Committees, bow 
many representatives from one group as compared to another should be 
included, and whether or not some Red Guard groups should be represented 
at all. These arguments were by no means merely academic. They quickly 
degenerated into free-for-ails, and then into planned, pitched battles. This 
sort of fighting fed upon itself, making reconciliation still more difficult. 
The question of "who are our friends, who are our enemies" took on a 
very immediate meaning. 
To these intractable problems was added the continuing issue of the rec-
onciled cadres. The Red Guards were not alone in resenting the possible 
return of relatively large numbers of former party officials and function-
aries to important posts. Those cadres *ho had early thrown their lot with 
the "rebels" in hope of winning preferment and rapid advancement were, 
not surprisingly, resentful of the line advanced in February and March that 
most cadres were comparatively good no matter when they had first re-
belled. And to these problems there was soon added a new issue: As the 
military took charge in the provinces they handled the Red Guards rough-
ly in the interest of rapidly restoring order. Many Red Guards were ar-
rested; Red Guard activities were restricted and "rebel" privileges with-
drawn; and some Red Guard groups were suppressed outright.84 Moreover, 
the military were making the real decisions at the provincial level. In ef-
fect, military regional and district commanders and their subordinates had 
become a new set of "persons in authority." 
This combination of circumstances produced irresistable pressures from 
below?pressures, in any case, that Mao and his radical friends in Peking 
were happy to exploit. In February, retreat had proved to be a tactical 
maneuver; by April, revolution was rampant again. Interestingly enough, 
the signal for the new lurch to the left was the introduction of the first pub.

lie attacks on Liu Shao-ch'i, and the central issue on which these attacks 
turned was the question of Liu's approach to the cadre question. "Slavish 
mentality" and unquestioning obedience to orders were roundly condemned. 
In practice, this meant that the attempt to rebuild the new administrative 
structure in the provinces had to all intents and purposes been abkindoned. 
Indeed, with the new upsurge in revolutionary activity this was very largely 
an impossibility. Moreover, atill another complicating factor had beip added 
to the provincial situation. Red Guard attacks were now being directed 
against the military authorities who were locally in power. The PLA com-
manders, taking a page from the books of the discredited party leaders, be-
gan to organize and encourage some Red Guard groups who would support 
the regional and district commands." Clashes between these groups and 
the more militant Red Guards, who were still manipulated from Peking, 
very quickly overshadowed the disputes among he militants themselves. 
These clashes were the central political fact of the spring and summer, 
but the underlying issue remained the same: who was to hold power and 
how was that power to be exercised. Yet for all the fury of the struggle?
in July and August the confusion, disruption and factional fighting reached 
heights that surpassed the chaos of the "January revolution"?very little 
really changed. A Peking Municipal Revolutionary Committee was formed 
in May, and a single provincial Revolutionary Committee and six "prep-
aratory groups" were set up in the summer, but these bodies were clearly 
dominated by the military men already running the respective provinces 
involved; they were in large degree Military Control Commissions writ 
large.86 
Furthermore, although important PLA figures came under severe Red 
Guard attack between April and September, prior to August there was no 
concerted effort to disrupt the military chain of command as the party had 
been disrupted in January. Even when the brief, across-the-board assault 
on the PLA was inaugurated following the Wuhan incident, the consequences 
to the military establishment were comparatively few. Ch'en Tsai-tao, the 
Wuhan Military Commander, was dismissed together with his immediate 
subordinates. Apparently a number of commanders of the military districts 
immediately adjacent to Wuhan were also sacked, but those men were at 
once replaced by others of similar background brought in from other mili-
tary regions." There was no effort made to "dissolve" either the affected 
regional or district commands; a shuffling of personnel sufficed. Indeed, 
"In the spring of 1967, militant Red Guard groups began to attack their opponents 
for having the support of local military commanders. 
"This situation was obvious in Tsinghai, where military figures were clearly in com-
mand. In Peking, although Hsieh Fu-chih, chief of the new Revolutionary Committee, 
was a member of the State Council, the situation apparently did not change appreciably 
from that which had existed since February 1967, whee lbe Peking garrison took over 
the municipality. 
"Commands were apparently shaken up in the Hupeh, Henan, Hunan and Kiangsi 
military districts.

the assault on the military establishment was almost wholly abortive. The 
unprecedented apology to the PLA made by leading members of the Small 
Group for the Cultural Revolution early in September suggests, that the 
Maoist radicals soon recognized that they could not take on the army as 
they had the party; and PLA resentment and distrust of unbridled "revolu-
tionary" activity almost certainly was a major factor in the sudden decision 
to curtail that activity in September." 
The downturn In "revolutionary" activity was accompanied by a new ef-
fort to deal with the consequences of the "January revolution"?that is, the 
consequences of the virtual dismemberment of the party. With one con-
spicuous exception, the methods employed closely resembled those of the 
previous February; in a sense it could be said that the work of repairing 
China's administrative and political structure was picked up where it had 
been left off at that time. As in February, a major effort was made to recon-
cile and rehabilitate "old cadres," to tame the Red Guards, and to form 
new Revolutionary Committees. Former party cadres were again urged to 
step forward, declare for the Cultural Revolution, and take up new duties. 
Implicit in this appeal was the fact that few cadres had done so in Febru-
ary, and fewer still in the intervening months. But from the Red Guard 
point of view, what was important was that many cadres who had been 
politically impotent for nearly a year were likely' to regain a measure of 
authority. Many of these men had scores to settle; moreover, competition 
for posts and positions would be intensified. 
These were volatile issues, and indeed the whole question of what to do 
about the Red Guards was very probably an explosive one. If they were 
? allowed to remain active, the job of reconstruction and rehabilitation would 
be immeasurably more difficult; if they were sidelined, large numbers of 
militants would be alienated, and, more important, their political demise 
would be virtually an open admission that the Cultural Revolution had run 
its course. Even more important?critically important?the "rebels" had 
close connections with leading members of the Small Group for the Cultural 
Revolution in Peking, and although this group had been weakened in Sep-
tember,8? it apparently could still prevent any move to defuse the Red 
Guard movement as a whole. Thus, only half-hearted efforts were made to 
tame the Red Guards. Little real attempt was made to curb or end Red 
Guard privileges, and, unlike February, virtually no troublesome Red Guard 
organization was declared counterrevolutionary.40 However, some effort was 
made to end Red Guard disputes by putting high priority on the rapid 
? formation of "revolutionary great alliances," and the PLA was ordered to 
help in this procc,s."

482 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND THE PARTY 
But the "revolutionary great alliances" were merely the first step in the 
formation of the "triple alliances"?that is, in the formation of Revolu-
tionary Committees. This was made the first order of business.42 Never-
theless, progress in this direction was extremely slow, and this in itself is 
a measure of the continuing difficulties that beset the task of rehabilitation. 
By February 1968, only six additional provincial Revolutionary Committees 
had bean set up, and only four additional "preparatory groups" bad been 
formed. The pace has subsequently quickened somewhat; by mid-April an 
additional nine Revolutionary Committees had come into existence, In near-
ly every case the formation of these bodies has apparently been preceded 
by elaborate negotiations, almost certainly both in the province itself and 
in Peking. These negotiations are not conducted publicly, but Red Guard 
comments on specific situations, while highly polemic, give some idea of 
the issues involved. The central question seems to be political patronage?
the issue that has plagued provincial administration since the "January 
revolution." In the provinces themselves, disputes appear to center around 
questions involving the relative merits, importance and prerogatives of in-
dividual Red Guard organizations, and, perhaps more important, around 
the thorny problem of getting both "rebels" and "old cadres" mutually to 
accept new provincial leaders. In Peking, the problem is to decide just who 
those leaders are to be. 
Until February the decision had been to accept the military figures al-
ready running the various provinces as the dominant figures in the new 
Revolutionary Committees?a decision in effect to postpone more basic 
political choices. Nearly all of these military men have been under some 
form of Red Guard attack for months, but even more bitter disputes may 
center around lesser figures drawn from among the rehabilitated cadres 
and the Red Guard organizations. Yet even when Revolutionary Commit-
tees come into existence, disputes continue. Virtually every such provincial 
committee?both those formed recently and those that came into being 
early in 1967?appears to be under attack from without and racked by 
strains from within. It is unlikely that similar bodies at lower levels, where 
the committee-forming process has gone on somewhat more rapidly since 
September, are immune to these pressures and strains. 
In the past several months these troubles have apparently intensified. 
Radio broadcasts in the affected provinces have become increasingly shrill 
in denouncing "factional" disputes, which are frequently said to extend 
into "leadership bodies." In late January and early February, Wen Hui Pao 
was especially stern in condemning "factional crimes" which have inter-
fered with the functioning of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, but 
it is clear that such difficulties are not confined to Shanghai alone." For 
example, some kind of dispute between Cheng Kuo-hua, head of the

Szechwan "preparatory group," and Liu Chieh-ting, chief "rebel" repre-
sentative and number three man on the group, may be one cause for the 
long delay in the formal establishment of a Revolutionary Committee in 
that province." 
Moreover, as the process of consolidation and rehabilitation goes on, 
differences between "rebels" co-opted into leadership organs and those on 
the outside tend to increase. As early as May 1967, warnings rare issued 
to "revolutionaries" who had been elevated to leadership positions not to 
assume the officious airs and bureaucratic ways of the party officials they 
had displaced. The Shantung Revolutionary Committee actually issued a 
code of behavior designed to correct such abuses.45 Still more important, 
"rebels" in responsible positions now have something to protect. They and 
the Revolutionary Committees are apparently being criticized by Red Guard 
groups who have either been squeezed out in the formation of the new com-
mittees or who feel that they are under-represented on them. Nearly all 
provincial Revolutionary Committees appear to be under pressure of this 
sort,4? and as it continues leading "rebel" figures such as Chang Ch 
chiao, head of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, find themselves less 
and less spokesmen for "revolutionary" interests and more and more con-
servators of the status quo.47 
The glue holding all these disparate forces together still appears to be the 
military, but the PLA has itself tended to become a participant in, rather 
than an arbiter of, the political infighting. Moreover, an army of less than 
three million can scarcely perform the administrative and political func-
tions of a party of 20 million indefinitely. It is in this context that the ten-
tative steps toward restoration of a functioning party machine must be 
viewed. For the major way in which the recent effort at rehabilitation dif-
fers from that of February is that on this occasion not only are individual 
cadres to be reconciled, but apparently the party machine is, at least in 
part, to be rehabilitated as well. 
Since late November increasing emphasis has been placed on the task of 
"party-building," which is now said to be an integral part of the "strategic 
plan" introduced by Mao in September. 48 Leading figures are again being 
identified by their party titles; discussion of the party's central role in 
Chinese political life is again being emphasized. "Party-building" itself was 
listed as a major task in the 1968 New Year's Day len-min Jih-pao editorial.

THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND THE PARTY 
and radio has been remarkably vague and general, but several salient points 
titand out. One is that the long-postponed 9th Party Congress will ap-
parently he held," at which time a new party constitution will apparently tic 
adopted and such leading "renegades" as Liu Shao-ch'i, Tcng lisiao-p'ing 
and P'eng Chen will be formally excluded from high office.5? A second is 
that party cadres are eventually to form the "core and backbone" of the 
Revolutionary Conunittecs---which means that the party's bureaucratic 
structure will have to be restored in fact if not in name." A third is that 
party officials in the military will probably play an extremely important 
part in the task of "party-building."62 A fourth is that while considerable 
numbers of Red Guards will obviously be allowed to enter the reconstituted 
party, they will not be brought in en masse but will have to undergo a 
thorough screening; former party cadres will also have to be screened, but 
it is apparently contemplated that reasonably large numbers will survive 
this process." Finally, the party bureaucracy will be streamlined.64 
It should be emphasized that this scenario represents less a fully accepted 
program of action than it does the pious hopes of those elements in the na-
tional leadership that have been pressing most strongly for a restoration 
of order and rationality and an end to unbridled "revolution." While some 
general consensus has probably been reached at the Center with regard to 
an eventual reconstitution of party life, a program that so obviously assumes 
the virtual end of the Cultural Revolution certainly cannot be popular with 
large numbers of "revolutionaries," nor with those elements at the Center 
who are most closely bound up with them. Transfer of real political power 
to party factions within the Revolutionary Committees must deeply upset 
many activists who quite naturally expect that, should it occur, the score 
will be settled wholesale by embittered "old cadres"; some efforts are ap-
parently under way to reassure "revolutionaries" on this matter." 
But this question is merely the symptom of a more basic problem, namely, 
who will have control over the screening process when "party-building" 
really gets under way. If the Red Guards are to have a real voice in the 
process of rehabilitating party cadres, the process of rebuilding the party 
machine may be delayed indefinitely. While this is not likely to occur, the 
issue probably has not been settled definitely, almost certainly because the 
central leaders in Peking themselves cannot agree on the matter." Some

straws in the wind have begun to appear, however. In February Revolu-
tionary Committees were acting up in Hupeh, Hopeh and Honan, apparent-
ly without the usual, laborious, prior negotiations at the provincial level." 
Although the Henan and Hupeh committees are dominated by military 
figures, both include prominent party officials who were under very severe 
Red Guard attack at the height of the "revolutionary" movement. And in 
Hopeh the situation is even more interesting: The new committee is headed 
by Li lisuelpfeng, former head of the party's North China Regional Bureau 
and successor to P'eng Chen as First Secretary of the Peking Party Commit-
tee. Both he and his deputy, Liu Tzu-hou, were disgraced in late 1966; Liu 
Tzu-hou was "dragged out" and paraded by Red Guards in early 1967. 
Their rehabilitation hardly seems a victory for "revolutionary activists." 
These recent rehabilitations are spectacular because they resurrect men 
who had not simply faded into political limbo, but who had been quite 
clearly disgraced. Yet while this development is almost certainty of con-
siderable significance, it probably is not decisive. The level of violence 
and disruption is still high in nearly all areas of China, and the arguments 
over place and position as well as over the future of the Cultural Revolu-
\ tion still go on." Furthermore, for all the recent smoke about' rehabilitation 
of cadres, there still appears to be very little fire: positive information in-
dicating that much has yet really been accomplished in this direction is 
lacking. Also, there is as yet no sign that the party chain of command has 
in any way been restored; nor is there any indication that 'preliminary steps 
have been taken to prepare for the 9th Party Congress. However, articula-
tion of a restored organizational structure for the Young Communist League 
appears to have advanced rapidly since February.5? 
Nevertheless, on the basis of what has in fact occurred in the past few 
months, some speculation about the future shape of events is probably in 
order. In the first place, if the party is to form the "core and backbone" of 
the Revolutionary Committees, a party structure not noticeably different 
from that which previously existed is bound eventually to emerge from the 
rubble. This process has not yet really begun, but the outcome is not really 
in doubt. The crucial issue is the staffing of the structure. 
Here, too, changes may not be as great as once seemed likely. Since in 
both February and September the fires of revolution were banked at least 
in part because it was generally recognized in Peking that the administrative 
costs of continued ferment were too high, the argument for experience and 
"No "preparatory group" had been previously established in Hopeh. Hupeh and 
Honan are less clear-cut eases. 
"The fall of Acting Chief of Staff Yang Ch'eng-wu in late March seems to be in some 
way related to problems within the Revolutionary Committees. His purge was followed 
by a general attack on "rightists" and "double-dealers" who had "wormed their way" 
Into the committees. This was accompanied by a denunciation of a tendency toward 
"reversal of verdicts"?te? indiscriminate rehabilitation of cadres.

4136 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND THE PARTY 
administrative ability is likely to carry considerable weight as the party 
bureaucracy is restaffed. Many old faces are likely to reappear in high posts, 
although there may be some transfer of party personnel from jobs in the 
state bureaucracy to party work. At middle levels, the need for experience 
will probably also play an important role, but perhaps not quite ao many 
cadres will return to the jobs they previously held. It seems quite,possible 
that there :nay be room for some upward mobility at this level, end oecond, 
and third-raaing officials may inherit important posts. In any event this 
twents a teanonable11iy Imt it is no more than timt, At the basic 
levels, the situation is even more obscure. A considerable number of cadres 
in the rural areas probably have survived the Cultural Revolution relative-
ly unscathed, but it is at this level that the greatest infusion of Red Guards 
is likely to occur. Perhaps a fairly high personnel turnover can be ex-
pected in urban areas, but here again we enter the area of pure speculation. 
Those leading party figures who have been assigned major roles as vil-
lains in the course of the Cultural Revolution almost certainly can be 
counted out of the picture permanently. Those who have been denounced 
by name in official publications (as opposed to Red Guard papers and wall 
posters) or in radio broadcasts are clearly beyond the pale. It is most likely 
that such thoroughly reviled figures as Liu Shao-ch'i, Teng Hsiao-p'ing 
(neither of whom have yet been denounced by name), P'eng Chen and T'ao 
Chu will not even be given roles as "teachers by negative examples," but 
will be excluded entirely from public life.?? If the recent events in Hopeh 
and Hupeh are any indication of what is to come, however, at least a few 
officials disgraced and humiliated by Red Guard attacks at the height of the 
Cultural Revolution will finally be rehabilitated?although they may be 
demoted and given lesser responsibilities. 
Far fewer of the Red Guard rank and file are likely to be admitted to 
party ranks than seemed likely several months ago." Many, but by no means 
all, of those Red Guard leaders who have been co-opted into the various 
Revolutionary Committees are likely to survive," but their relative standing 
vis-a-vis "old cadres" and, at least temporarily, military figures on the 
committees is by no means settled. And the same is true of those relatively 
few party cadres who threw in their lot with the Red Guards and thereby 
earned the title of true "leftists." The battles on these issues are quite clear-
ly still going on. 
There have been enough twists and turns in the Cultural Revolution to 
make all predictions hazardous, but if the picture just outlined has much 
validity it is surely a picture of Thermidor. This is not to say that Mao 
from the start has been conducting a charade and that many of the party.

peraonnel apparently disgraced in the paat two years were never in any 
real trouble at all. It seems quite likely that circumstances?primarily the 
sustained and unexpected resistance to the Chairman's initiatives?have 
pushed Mao onto paths he did not originally expect to travel, but the battles 
of the Cultural Revolution have been real battles, and the victims real 
victims. Mao won most of the early battles, but only by escalating the war, 
and the consequences of hie victories have boon eo grave, and the complica-
tions they have engendered so extensive, that in the end they have not been 
victories at all. It is hard to believe that there are not very considerable 
strains within the central leadership in Peking at present. These strains may 
account in part for the slowness and hesitancy of the reconstruction process. 
One major aspect of this process, "party-building," is beset by disputes in-
volving such questions as whether or not revolutionary enthusiasm or prag-
matic administrative qualities ought to be a primary qualification for high 
party office, and whether or not non-party masses ought to endorse the 
qualifications of party cadres. But these were the questions at issue when 
the Cultural Revolution began. We have come full circle. 
Yet even if we assume that these questions will be settled with a certain 
degree of compromise and adjustment, according to the general terms out-
lined above, there remain several major issues regarding the relationship 
of the party bureaucracy to the other elements of the Chinese Communist 
system. The most important of these involves the future relationship of the 
party to the state bureaucracy and to the military establishment. 
Neither problem is new, but both are likely to arise in acute form in the 
aftermath of the Cultural Revolution. Strains involving the interrelation-
ship of the state and party bureaucracies are almost certain to arise in the 
Revolutionary Committees. These are administrative organs, supervising 
many of the functions and services previously performed by the provincial 
governorates; yet they are increasingly responsible for such ostensibly 
party-controlled functions as supervision of propaganda, and they have ap-
parently taken under their wings such party-controlled organizations as the 
Young Communist League. Moreover, party fractions are to be the "core 
and backbone" of the committees. There is bound to be a confusion of 
functions here surpassing anything seen in the past.58 In the central minis-
tries, however, the situation is different. These organs have continued to 
function in the past year, while the party apparatus has been out of busi-
ness; party supervision and control for all practical purposes has ceased. 
Reassertion of that control is not likely to be easy; furthermore, Chou En-
lai, who today appears to be a more powerful figure than ever within the 
inner policy-making group, is unlikely to be overawed by any successor to 
Teng Hs;ao-p'ing, as he may on occasion have been in the past. It is pos-
sible, but by no means certain, that he may resist a full reassertion of party.

control over areas within the purview of the State Council. 
Problems involving party-PLA relationships are obvious. The Cultural 
Revolution has certainly not disposed of the old professional-political of-
ficer dichotomy, and in some respects the professional wing of the PLA 
has been strengthened. Former commissars whose ties were primarily to 
the party rather than the army have nearly all long since left the scene; 
most of the commissars now active appear to be largely the creatures of 
the several military region and district commanders." And those are the 
men who in most cases are still running China's provinces. Moreover, no 
officer known to be a member of the PLA's General Political Department 
has appeared in public in the past several months." Yet it is the party 
committees within the various military commands that will bear the major 
burden of "party-building," for this is the only party "system" in any sense 
operative; rather than having been destroyed outright, it has merely been 
atrophied." In this situation, professional military problems are likely to 
get a sympathetic hearing initially, but it is hard to believe that as the new 
party structure is articulated, politics will not attempt to reassert itself over 
the gun." 
Beyond these problems there is the even more fundamental question of 
party morale. The Great Leap Forward certainly had a deleterious?indeed, 
virtually traumatic?effect on large sections of the party; it seems likely 
that the Cultural Revolution will have an ultimate effect many times greater 
on party morale at all levels. Thus far cadres have shown a great, although 
perfectly natural, reluctance to "step forward" and resume their tasks. Even 
after the Cultural Revolution is concluded, not many are likely to perform 
with much enthusiasm or initiative. And animosities engendered in the 
course of the "revolution" are likely to linger for years. These animosities 
may prolong the "revolution" itself for some time to come, but the job of 
picking up the pieces once it is over is likely to be arduous in the extreme. 
The party organizational structure will probably be restored, but in this 
sense it is safe to say that the Chinese Communist Party will never be the 
same again. 
"Most of these men appear to have made a career in the PLA rather than in the party 
bureaucracy. When commanders and commissars appear together, pride of place is given 
to the commander. 
"Hsiao Hua, head of the GPD, fell in late August 1967. This entire development has 
interesting implications with regard to Lin Piao's relationship to the PLA. 
"Frequent references to military party committees began to appear in official media 
early this year. There has still been no mention of other party organs. Of course the 
army chain of command, to which the military party committees are related, has re-
rnained intact throughout the Cultural Revolution.

Communist Ohina: 
The Economy and the Revolution 
BY JAN S. PRYBYLA ' 
Professor of Economics, Pennsylvania State University 
OMMUNIST CHINA has published 
only one statistical manual: a slim, 
? retrospective volume. entitled Ten 
Great Years, covering the years 1949-1958.' 
The figures for 1949-1952 are not very re-
liable because of the modest state of statistical 
science in the country at that time. The, 
data for 1953-1957 (the First Five-Year Plan 
period) are probably the best of the lot, but 
even here numerous technical difficulties arise. 
Figures for 1958 (the first year of the "great . 
leap forward," 1958-1960) were so exagger-
ated and fanciful that even the Chinese later., 
declared them to be totally misleading. No ' 
comprehensive statistics have been published 
since 1959. Since 1966, the information 
blackout has been complete. One could go ' 
so far as to say that the amount of quantified, 
information emanating from Peking in the. 
last three years would fit comfortably on a 
sizable postage stamp. . 
For a while (1961-1965) the Mainland 
prcss carried much interesting discussion 
about the economy. Here and there one 
could pick up a suggestive datum, a hint on 
what was going on in the fields of agriculture, 
industry and trade. After 1965, this type 
of reportage was replaced by inspirational 
articles extolling the thoughts of Chairman 
Mao Tse-tung. The language of these es-
says has become frozen by Maoist ritual. 'For, 
a time, a study of the provincial press yielded; 
some valuable information on leadership at- ,

'SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
A number of general principles about the 
?Chinese economy should be kept in mind. 
The designation, "planned economy," does 
,not apply to China.. Like the rest of Chinese 
society, .the economy in the past 19 years has 
been run by a series of short-term expedients, 
. typically assuming the . form of mass cam-
paigns. The only period which fits the des-'

in various ways, among which po4 icy disagree-
ments within the top leadership should cer-
tainly be included. The major stages of shift-1 
ing policy were the rehabilitation period 
1,(1949-1952), the First Five-Year Plan ; 
(1953-1957), the liberal interlude (late ' 
; 1956-1957), the great leap forward (1958-
1960), the period of retrenchment and re-
building (1961-1965), and the great pro-
letarian cultural revolution (1966 to the 
'present). Each stage contained a number of 
'minor substages, some of them mutually con-
tradictory.'Each stage also revealed policy' 
:shifts horn right to left and back again de-
:pending on whether emphasis was placed on 
\ :economic calculation or ideological euphoria.' 
The cultural revolution, for example, shows 
' at least seven such swings in the revolutionary 
, pendulum. To some extent, these move-
ments are consciously directed by the leaders 
on the theory of alternating tension and re-
laxation. Increasingly, however, the swings 
appear to be spontaneous and uncontrollable. 
? Like other underdeveloped economics, the 
Chinese economy is not fully integrated. 
There is a considerable clement of localism 
and local self-sufficiency in the mechanism. 
To sonic extent this is a legacy of the past 
which the Communists have tried to eradi-
cate. On the other hand, not a few measures 
taken by the Communists since 1958 have 
tended to encourage local economic auton-
omy. The interesting point about this is that ? 
it enables the economy to withstand upheav-
als at the center, to keep on functioning lo-
cally in spite of confusion at the top.i 
The Chinese economy is "aidless." It has 
never received any grants from abroad and 
the last long-term (Soviet) loan was received 
in 1954. China's external economic contacts 
are based on cash (mostly hard cash) pay-
ments and short-term credits for the purchase 
abroad of specified items. Two-thirds of the 
country's trade is presently carried on with 
"capitalist" powers. 
At least since 1961, the Chinese economy 
has not been "Marxist-Leninist" in the Stal-
inist sense. In the *U.S.S.R. and Eastern Eu-
rope the Stalinist economic priorities were?
and to some extent still are?heavy industry, 
light industry, agriculture. China's official 
priorities after 1960 have been: agriculture, 
light industry, heavy industry. This depar-
ture from the orthodox pattern was largely 
dictated by the urgent need to feed and 
clothe a rapidly increasing population.' 
aiA_TREypintiogifsaiku8166.66615 
e,conomy one must constantly ear in min 
the cultural gap between Western and Chi-
nese conceptions of life. It is difficult enough' 
to understand the workings of totalitarian , 
systems when one has not been exposed to 
them directly and for corisiderable periods. 
It is even more difficult to graspthe elusive 
qualities of a totalitarian system imposed on 
,a society whose values are very different from , 
ours, and whose language loses more than the 
usual share of meaning in translation. There 
is no civil or criminal code in China today, 
nor are there any codes in other areas of law.: 
The whole body of Chinese Communist law' 
takes up just 600 pages of rather large print,' 
3and most of the "laws" are, in fact, admin-
istrative decrees, many of them applying ret-
rospectively. The General Code of Laws of 
the Ch'ing Dynasty made it a criminal of-
fense to "do what you ought not to do." 
The Chinese, moreover, have a capacity for 
!separating the public from the private face, 
so that noisy expressions of obeisance on the 
part of private individuals must at all times 
' be viewed not only in the context of a sys-
tem of fear but in the light of a special ethic 
which existed long before Mao and Marx.

' At the end of December, 1966, the cultural 
revolution was extended to economic life. 
Red Guards and Maoist workers' formations 
("revolutionary rebels") were ordered to take 
over offices, factories and farms. At this 
juncture, the upheaval in the "superstruc-
ture" (politics and cultural life) invaded the 
"base" (the economy) . Since that time, 
there have been several shifts to the left and 
right, but the important point is that the 
revolutionary turmoil is now common to both 
political and economic life and directly af-
fects the growing of grain and the making of 
steel.'

trancous matter is discarded, China's funda.? 
; mental problem is seen to be what it has 
always been: how to feed and clothe a grow,' 
I 
lug population. The economic answer to 
1 this problem lies in modernization, that is, 
[ the breaking out of the limits imposed on 
productivity by traditional, methods of pro-
duction, and the application of modern sci-
ence and technoloxy to the economic process. 
1There are various ways in which this can be 
? done. However, because the margin between 
food and mouths to feed is extremely narrow, 
I  
1,the range of options is for all practical pur-
(poses restricted to one: the development of 
!agriculture. During the relatively pragmatic 
period, 1961-1965, the Chinese Communists 
recognized this constraint and applied them-
selves to promoting agriculture and indus-
tries directly serving agriculture, including 
I ight industries supplying the peasants with 
consumer goods. The importance of this 
sector is, of course, further enhanced by the 
, fact that .about 80 per cent of the Chinese 
,people derive their living directly from the 
soil. Help from abroad must for the time 
!being be ruled out. 
There are two hard figures to go on. The 
first is the 1953 population figure of 583 mil.? 
lion, the second? is the grain output figure for 
,1957 which reads 185 million metric tons. 
,Both figures seem reasonable and they have 
been repeatedly endorsed by official China. 
The rate of natural population increase since? 
1953 is subject to dispute. Estimates range 
from 1.4 to 2.5 per cent per annum.' If the 
lower rate is taken, China's population in 
1957 would be 615 million. The 2.5 per 
cent rate is probably too high. Taking a 
more reasonable rate of, say, 2 per cent per" 
annum, the 1957 population would be 631 
'million. Assuming a 1957 population of 615 
'million and a domestic grain output of 185 
I in 1957 works out at 0.3 tons. If the 2 per munist China Produce?" The China Quarterly, 
, 
UTC (707 million) and the higher grain avail-
ability figure 4205- million tons), the per 
capita grain availability in 1967 works out 
, 0.29 tons. If the higher population figure 
takee (770 million) together with the,; 
grain figure (205 million tons), the! 
is a per capita grain availability of 0.27. 
All this may sound involved, but the con-
t hision is simple; per capita grain availability 
I a China MIS prnetivally the titanel WV ns 
kt 1957, and this on the most favorable as-
tumptions. There appears to have been no.. 
visible improvement., It should be noted, of 
ourse, that the' fact that the Chinese ClOra...

The 1967 harvest was exceptionally good;

iast two .years water conservancy projects 
have been neglected and that there has been. 
an increase in illegal chopping down of trees 
.by peasants.. One is inclined to assume 'that,

t-
The .overall contittsitm which emerges is 
a per capita .grain availability of .0.3 
,,.tnetric tons or thereabouts represents a satis-
factory present level, but that it will be in-
. treasingly difficult to maintain this level in 
the future unless (a) a determined effort is 
.-made to raise per acre yieltls, extend the cul-
tivated area and 'keep floods and droughts in

dialectical mysticism. There seems to be, . 
- 'frankly, very little room left for the kind .of ?

' :have enjoyed for the last three years. 
A final note about clothing, .which means 
; ;iprimarily cotton. The Chinese these days. 
'are not given to conspicuous consumption in 
the matter' of 'apparel. The millions are 
drably but cleanly dressed. Cotton output 
appears at present to be inadequate to cover 
:anything but the most modest requirements 
of domestic consumers and state exports. 
; Total cotton production in 1957 Was 1.64 ml!-
llon
, 
metric tons. .By 1966, it had probably' 
:declined to 1,3 million tons.' If, as the Chi-
nese claim, cotton output in 1967 was better 
than in the ,previous year (let ,us assume a . 
20 per cent improvement), it may now ' be., 
roughly back.wherC it was in 1957.' 
And sriin this area too, there is littic. room 
left for ideo;ogical revivalism., There is, 
'rather an urgent need for economic rational-
by, as Mao's Communist opponents have re-
peatedly said. 
!FOREIGN TRADE 
I: China's foreign commerce is the one sector 
! about which the outside world has relatively 
reliable information, simply,because it is pos-
' sible to get at trade figures issued by China's 
partners. The country's total imports and 
exports are in the $344 billion range, which 
is not very much by world standards, but is 
crucial for China. Again, thorn of interest-
ing but somewhat irrelevant incidentals, for-
':.eign trade is important for the Chinese be-
' cause it enables them to get chemical /era-
lizers and chemical plants and some Indus-
trial equipment which they lack, as well as 
svIteat to fill the gap between inadequate and 
mum nutritional standards. The chemi-
cals, plants and wheat come overwhelmingly 
:from the Western industrial countries and 
...japan. Australia, Canada, Argentina and 
France are the major wheat suppliers. A 
tons of imported wheat costs the Chi-. 
ese $50460 million in hard currencies, so' 
.:..that the annual expenditure on this item runs. 
?- these days into some $2504300 million. 
? Since the wheat deals are settled in cash 
tor on a short-term credit basis, the Chinese . 
'have to be very careful about their foreign 
-.exchange reserves and about the way their: 
'trade balance shapes Up each year. What 
:China's foreign exchange (i.e., hard currency , 
reserve) position is at present, is anybody's 
guess, but there are clues. ? 
The Chinese have at all times scrupulously 
:.settled their foreign debts, even in the face' 
of unfraternal provocation by the Soviets. - 
They have paid promptly. and in full, thus: 
.esiablishing for tIzemselves a good name, if 
.not a credit rating, in the world. Mainland 
China today has DO outstanding debts, except 
the usual short-term ones, which are settled 
hi the normal way. 
To pay for essential imports, The Chinese 
have made a determined effort to promote, 
! exports of agricultural commodities (e.g.,. 
rice) and light industry products (e.g., cotton 
fabrics, cement, simple consumer goods).?  ? 
China's foreign trade balance (commodity 
. account) has usually been in slight surplus.

In this way, a small inflow of foreign cur-
rencies has been assured over the years. 
An important source of foreign exchange , 
has been China's trade with Hong Kong. ! 
The Chinese supply most of the goods and 
services (including water) which the Hong ; 
I Kong population needs daily and buy very 
little from the colony. The surplus is settled 
by Hong Kong in pounds sterling. 
Invisible payments (I.e., the services ac.%1 
,count), such as freight and insurance and the ; 
servicing of loans, are settled by hard cur-
rency remittances from overseas Chinese. It 
I is estimated that overseas Chinese remit about 
!,$150. million to Mainland China every year, 
although the amount has no doubt fluctuated 
and has probably dropped to half that sum 
in each of the last three years. 
In some years, recourse has been made by 
the Chinese to bullion sales, especially of., 
silver. From 1959 to 1962, China sold in 
London' about $50 million worth of bullion,: 
and there have been no sales since. In 1965 ' 
, . and 1966, the Chinese bought some gold in - 
!,London, possibly as a hedge against the ex-
pected devaluation of the British pound, in? 
,' 
.which China's foreign exchange reserves are: 
Mainly held. China did not join in the rush ' 
on gold at the end of 1967 and in early 1968.? 
1. Since the early 1950's, but especially after 
the break with the Soviet Union, the Chinese,' 
have extended credits to various non-Com-
munist developing countries. Most of these; 
loans have been tied to the delivery of Chi-
nese-made goods, although there have been 
few instances of emergency foreign ex-
change loans. As a rule, the loans are inter-
est-free and directed to specific projects in 
the beneficiary countries. 
; One of the disturbing side effects of the 
'cultural revolution has been a decline in Chi-
nese exports and a concurrent rise in imports, 
resulting in a trade deficit of some $50 mil-
lion in 1966 and about $200 million in 1967. 
;The drop in exports is probably traceable in 
' the first place to disruption in Chinese ports 
and confusion on the railroads, and also to 
; production problems in industry. Less sig- ' 
!nificantly, the cultural goings-on have' 
strained 
strained China's relations with a number of 
trading partners, including Hong Kong. 
Because of the continuing need to import 
; wheat (in 1968 wheat impOrts are likely to 
exceed 6 million tons), there is here again no 
rocnr: for ideological exuberance. Most West 
Asss sig.'s, , 
European countries are eager to tra c WI 1 
Mainland China. Whether their eagerness 
will be rewarded depends to a considerable 
extent on China's ability to put her own 
house in order quickly. Even Mao Tse-. 
Tung, in his brief spells of economic ration-
ality, has come around to this view, A Red 
Guard poster in Canton quoted him as saying 
that 
this nationwide disorder, including military clip 
order, is to occur for the very last time. 'After 
that, the nation will return to peaceful order, ' 
and the world will once more be in the hands, 
of revolutionary rebels: The Central Govern- ' 
ment this time deliberately allows the existence 
of this nationwide disorder.? 
There is a non sequitur in this (Le., the revo-
lutionary rebels are the agents of disorder), 
but it is at least more sober than the state-
ment made by Wu Fa-hsien, Commander of. 
.the 'Air, Force, in August, 1967: "in imple-
menting Chairman Mao's directives we must 
,completely disregard? whether we understand 
them or not."'? 
INDUSTRY 
Industry, as well as agriculture, has been 
plagued throughout 1967 and the better part. 
of 1968 by problems of labor discipline. The - 
authority of professional managers and local 
government officials in charge of plants, of-, 
; flees and farms has been undermined, and 
in numerous instances the professionals have ' 
, been replaced by- inexperienced mixed com-
mittees of workers, rehabilitated cadres and 
the military. In addition, the workers have 
,been torn by factional disputes, some siding 
with the Maoist revolutionary rebels, others 
? with the anti-Maoist Officials. By the latter 
part of 1967, the original issues had become 
blurred; personal vendettas appear to have 
I been at least .as important and frequent as 
ideological positions in causing clashes in 
factories and offices. The summer months of 
1967 were especially violent, and bloody; 
armed clashes were reported daily from most

of absenteeism and resort to go-slow tactics , 
have often been mentioned in press, radio 
land wall poster reports. ? 
; It seems fairly clear that industrial pro- . 
duction was little affected by the early ideo-1 
'logical and power struggle phases of the cul-! 
fural revolution in 1966: One gets the im- I 
iression that output of most major industries 
?in that year was somewhat better than in ' 
1965, although this is exactly what it says: 
an impression. The Chinese have published 's 
no industry-wide production figures, and*, 
,Western estimates are based on scattered in-
formation from various plants and localities ' 
and on the general tenor of the reports. It 
is possible that in 1966 China produced about 
10 million tons of crude oil (1.5 million in , 
1957, and about 8 million tons in 1965), per-'
i 
? haps 40 million tons of iron ore (16 million , 
, tons in 1957), perhaps as much as 12 
14tons  of steel (up a million tons. from 1965), 
and about 250 million tons of coal and lignitel 
(130 million tons in 1957, and perhaps 210 
million tons in 1965).12 The figures, to re-
peat, are informed guesses and the most one 
can say is that in 1966 there was no discern-
, ible evidence of an industrial crisis, and 
, probably some improvement. 
The picture changed radically in 1967, 
, after the cultural revolution was carried into 
the economy. A new note of urgency and 
,worry was struck in Mainland reports, side, 
by side with the usual references to "great 
,upsurge" and "unprecedented achievements.", 
'A socialist recession appears to have devel-
oped rapidly, gathering momentum as the 
troubled months dragged on. The situation' 
' seems to have deteriorated further in 1968, as 
:the longer-term effects of the cultural up-
heaval began to be felt, chief among them 
; the lack of competent leadership at the plant, 
level, and worker restlessness. 
? The signs pointing to a deteriorating situa-, 
'tion in industry may be summed up as fol.,. 
, lows: 
; 1. In the winter of 1967-1968 a serious 
coal shortage developed partly because of 
fights, skirmishes, riots and strikes in coal 
mines. At the Lungmen colliery in Loyang,' 
for example, "civil war" had raged for sit 
Months prior to February, 1968. Similar 
trouble had apparently hit the Fushun col-
lieries in Liaoning Province, a major source 
of coal for the key Anshan steel works. Fact

2. There have been practically spo reports 
in 1967 and the first half of 1968 from some 
:4 China's most important industVal areas of 
Szechwan and Kansu. Even during the cul-
tural revolution, when information of any 
kind was scarce, good performance would 
have been praised to the skies as a manifesto-, 
tion of the inspirational power of Mao Tse-
tung's thought. A similar, information black-.) 
out was imposed on the once much vaunted.. 
Taching Oil fields. For about two years pre-. 
arious to 1967, Taching and the "Taching 
spirit were the themes of a mass propaganda 
,1  
campaign illustrating the economic benefits 
to be derived from Mao study. It is an in,' 
teresting comment on the sort of data one 
! gets out of China these days that, in spite, 
;of millions of words written on the subject of 
Taching, the field's exact location is not, 
known to this day. 
, 3. Anarchism, factionalism, groupism, sec.; 
tarianism, "mountain-topism," and all the .? 
other sins attributed to those who oppose the'. 
cultural revolution, have been mentioned in 
connection with the Anshan steel works and 
in the steel city of Wuhan. A month after 
the installation of a Municipal Revolutionary.' 
Committee in Wuhan (March, 1968) "acute: 
class struggle" was still being talked about on' 
, the radio and in the press. 
4. Urgent calls to "make revolution thrift-
fly" were being broadcast in the spring and: 
summer of 1968. These appeals were ad-
dressed primarily to factories and farms. 
5. Railroad transportation has been seri-
ously disrupted in 1967 by strikes, sabotage 
; 
and pitched battles between warring factions 
of railroad workers and between workers and

harvest comparisons with pre-

conspicuous silence on expanded

Indicating that there was little,

early and late rice production 
was estimated at 86,400,000 
metric tons. Taken together, 
the latest harvests of winter 
crops and early rice seem to 
have definitely fallen below 
those of last year. 
SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST 
18 September 1968 
. . 
. SEVERE rains, floods, frost and drought have hurt crops in mainland China. 
Farm Problems Pla 
ONE OF THE most serious 
and persistent economic prob-
lems for China's leaders is how 
to increase the populous nation's 
agricultural productivity. 
The acuteness of the problem 
becomes evident when it is rea-
lized that agriculture in China 
accounts for almost 50 percent 
of the national income, employs 
about 80 percent of the labor 
, force and provides a major pro-
, 
portion of the country's exports. 
Additionally, the size of the 
ilyearly harvest vitally affects 
! consumption, industrial produc-
tion, capital investment, rev-
enue, foreign and retail trade 
and other economic variables. 
An estimated 11 percent of 
, China's land area is now cul-
tivated, and about 40 per-
cent of it is probably double-
cropped. The total sown area is 
roughly equal to that in the 
, United States. However, almost 
all tilled land is located in the 
eastern half of the country, 
where there are sizable areas 
with 50 percent or more of the 
land under cultivation. 
These areas include nearly all 
of the North China Plain and 
the valley of the lower Yangtze 
below'Wuhu as well as parts of 
the Manchurian Plain and the 
Szechwan Basin. The amount 
, of land in cultivation in the rest 
of eastern China _varies_ widely. 
Approved For Relea 
: But it generally averages below 
1 30 percent, and it typically oc-
curs in sinuous and relatively 
narrow bands along the river 
valleys and on the immediately 
1 adjacent slopes. 
i New Lands Opened 
1 
The cultivated area of China 
has fluctuated within relatively 
narrow limits during the past 15 
years. Although new land has 
been brought into cultivation it 
apparently has not been suf-
ficient to offset the losses caused 
by greatly expanded urban and 
industrial areas, as well as the 
construction of a large number 
of reservoirs, and a number of 
physical factors such as saliniza-
tion and erosion. 
Most of the new land has 
been opened in Northeast China 
and in Sinkiang by state farm 
1 and military resettlement pro-
jects. Although a potential for 
opening new land for cultivation 
, remains, most land that is not 
' already in use is in marginal 
agricultural area. Aridity, al-
titude, short growing season, and 
other physical factors discour-
age farming there. 
A reluctance of the Chinese 
Communists to invest in costly, 
large-scale land reclamation

pansion of land under cultiva-
tion. Most plans for significant 
Increases in agricultural output, 
therefore, have been geared to 
Improving yields. 
:1 
Basic Problems 
The further expansion of 
irrigation and multiple cropping 
may increase output. However, 
a substantial improvement in 
agricultural productivity ap-
pears to depend more on the 
greater use of chemical fer-
tilizers and the use of improved 
seed. 
Basic to all plans for increas-
ed agricultural production is the 
need for better land manage-
ment and coordination of the 
land and water conservancy 
programs. 
Rice Dominates South 
The most significant division 
in China is that which separates 
the rice-growing southern pro-
vinces from the northern pro-
vinces that specialize in wheat 
and small grains. Within these 
two broad groups a large variety 
of other crops is grown. 
Rice is dominant almost every-
where in South China, where 
about 35 to 80 percent of the 
cultivated land is irrigated. In

(from Chinese Communist press and radio as indicated) 
"In medical and health work, put 
the stress on rural areas" 
Mao Tse-tung, quoted by NCNA, 
January 15, 1969. 
During the Cultural Revolution, in an attempt to correct the imbalance 
between town and country in the field of medical care, the Chinese authori-
ties launched a drive to move doctors and nurses from urban to rural areas. 
As a consequence, urban hospitnls were left short-staffed and standards de-
clined. 
In addition, the number of so-called "barefoot doctors" increased, but 
many of these poorly trained doctors do not know their limitations and have 
consequently endangered their patients lives. 
The cooperative medical care system intended to improve rural medical 
facilities is already suffering from shortages of drugs and a mediocre serv-
ice. 
The regime has made a sustained attempt to discredit the "bourgeois"' 
attitudes of city doctors and to reform their outlook and doctors have 
been subjected to political indoctrination and even physical harassment. 
Various disruptions during the Cultural Revolution have also caused short-
ages of drugs and a decline in standards of public health. 
In an attempt to overcome difficulties caused by lack of facilities 
in rural areas and the desire of many doctors to return to the cities, the 
authorities, with some assistance from Army doctors, have emphasized the 
use of Mao's thought as a medical aid. 
The opening shot in the latest campaign to send medical personnel away 
from the urban areas and into the countryside came before the beginning of 
the Cultural Revolution in an instruction from Mao Tse-tung in June 1965 
which said: 
"Urban hospitals should retain some doctors who have 
graduated for one or two years and who are not very ex-
perienced. All the others should go to the countryside." 
By March 1968 this already sweeping directive had been extended by the 
Central Committee, with the instruction that all 1966-67 graduates from med-
ical schools were to go to the countryside. This provoked a strong reaction 
from the young graduates concerned, many of whom resisted it on the basis of 
Mao's June 1965 directive - only to be?told that Mao's ideas were "lively,

Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000500060001-5 
flexible and changeable, and should not be interpreted too narrowly." 
Available evidence suggests that these directives have been rigorously 
applied and Chinese urban hospitals have lost virtually all their trained 
doctors and that the nursing staff and trainee doctors are doing what they 
can to cope with this unprecedented situation. Certainly there is abundant 
evidence of a massive influx of medical personnel into the rural areas. 
The New China News Agency (NCNA) on December 7, 1968 reported that in 
Heilungkiang over 3,600 medical personnel had recently settled in rural 
areas and that over the past two years over 8,400 had done the same. 
Kweiyang Radio on December 8 said that thousands of public health 
workers had gone to settle in the rural areas of Kweiyange 
NCNA on December 12 stated that in Kiangsi 11,000 medical workers had 
already settled in rural and that 10,000 more would soon be going. 
Canton Radio on January 4, 1969 reported that so far 5,000 medical 
workers in Kwangtung had gone to rural areas and that "in some cases whole 
units have been moved to the countryside." 
Travelers -from China reported in January 1969 that because so many 
trained nurses had been sent to rural areas, patients in Canton's hospitals 
were required to enlist the help of relatives to look after them. In one 
Canton hospital, it was reported in December that, about one third of the 
staff had been sent to the countryside and therefore treatment was only 
available to outpatients from 7:30 until 12:00. 
In October travelers reported that 50 per cent of the staff at the 
Canton Peoples Hospital had received a directive to proceed to rural areas. 
"Barefoot Doctors" 
In addition to the dispatch of trained medical personnel from the cities 
to the rural areas, the Cultural Revolution has witnessed a great increase 
in the numbers of the so-called "barefoot doctors." The People's Daily of 
September 14, 1968 and Red Flag No. 3 both published a joint "investigation 
report" entitled: "The orientation of revolution in medical education as 
seen from the growth of 'barefoot doctors.'" It described the organization 
of medical facilities at commune and brigade level and made suggestions 
for the reorganization of medical education. This report described "bare-
foot doctors," as mainly young peasants with education up to junior middle-
school level, who have been trained in a variety of basic medical practices 
either by two month courses at commune health clinics or on the job with the 
help of commune doctors. After two years experience they are said to be 
able to prescribe about 100 medicines, perform acupuncture, cure measles, 
pneumonia, pleurisy and diagnose appendicitis. During the Cultural Revolu-
tion the number of "barefoot doctors" has increased.

The People's Daily and Red Flag. articles proposed that in the future, 
medical schools should take their students from among the "barefoot doc-
tors" and other rural health workers who will return to the countryside 
after training. 
Cooperative medical care  
A further measure - cooperative medical care - intended to improve 
the medical facilities in rural areas was described in the People's Daily  
of December 5, 1968 as something new which has emerged during the great 
proletarian Cultural Revolution. 
The paper described how this scheme has been organized in Loyuan com-
mune, Hupeh Province. On the basis of actual medical expenses in the past 
it was decided that each person should pay an annual cooperative medical 
fee of one yuan. In addition each production team should pay 10 fen (cents) 
from its collective welfare fund for each member who subscribed to the med-
ical service. Except those suffering from chronic ailments, each commune 
member should pay 5 fen for every treatment and be given free medicine. 
Canton Radio reported that a similar system had been established in 
Kwangtung. There, each person was to pay 25-30 fen a month, forwarded 
twice a year by the production team to the collective where any deficiency 
would be made up from the collective welfare fund. The members were each 
to have a card entitling them to medical treatment at the brigade public 
health center. The cooperative system has also been inaugurated in several 
areas. 
The system however seems to have come up against obstacles. Travelers 
reported in December 1968 that at one Kwangtung commune the system had been 
started but that most farmers had not joined and if they were sick would 
see private doctors. This was said to be because the new system suffered 
from a chronic shortage of drugs and that the service was very mediocre. 
Army aid  
Two communes, one near Peking and the other in rural Kwangtung, have 
both been "helped" by the PLA to establish a cooperative medical system 
according to NCNA on January 15, 1969 and Canton Radio on January 11, 1969. 
It was not clear whether PLA help was necessary because of opposition to 
the scheme or because there was such a shortage of qualified medical per-
sonnel that only the Army could provide the necessary medical expertise. 
The "revolutionization" of urban medical staffs  
Along with the drive to send medical personnel away from the cities 
in order to improve the situation in the rural areas during the Cultural 
Revolution there has also been a sustained attempt to discredit the "bour-
geois" outlook of medical practitioners who wished to "stay in big hospitals 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : dIA-RDP79-01194A000500060001-5 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000500060001-5 
and become great doctors" (Canton Radio, November 6, 1968). Many doctors 
have accordingly been required to spend much valuable time in Mao-study. 
Travelers from CarrtOn reported in early 1968 that it was common to see a 
line of outpatients waiting for up to two hours outside a hospital while 
doctors read from the "little red book;" at the People's hospital in 
Canton it was reported in September 1968 that the staff had to study Mao 
from 8:00 until 8:30 every morning. 
Other doctors have been criticized and humiliated. In Canton hospi-
tals, according to travelers reports, so many doctors and other medical 
staff have been "struggled" against that Worker-peasant teams had taken 
over the running of the hospitals. 
In the Kwangtung Provincial People's Hospital all cleaning work was 
carried out by doctors under criticism according to reports in October. 
The doctors wore labels around their necks reading "Guilty of manslaughter 
by negligence during medical treatment." 
In another Kwangtung hospital patients reported that 12 of the 16 doc-
tors previously employed in the obstetric ward and outpatients section were 
assigned to the rural areas, and were replaced by six school drop-outs who 
are expected to learn the profession by experience and observation. In 
the same hospital the nurses and cleaning staff have also been interchanged, 
in accordance with a directive calling for the "re-education" of trained 
medical staff. Doctors who tried to point out the harm unskilled treat-
ment could to to patients were criticized. When the staff of the Kwangtung 
People's hospital were informed that they were required to go to rural com-
munes for farm work by April 30, many doctors protested at the number of 
patients who would be neglected if they went. They, too, were criticized. 
Shortages of medicines  
Disruptions in the pharmaceutical industry and of the transport system 
during the Cultural Revolution resulted in an acute shortage of medicines 
in many areas. In Kwangtung in early 1968 it was reported by travelers 
that drugs had been short since late 1967, especially supplies of strepto-
mycin, penicillin, chloromycetin and tetracyclin. In May 1968 a shortage 
of medicines was reported in Tientsin. 
Drugs were reported to be in short supply in Kwangtung, especially in 
Canton, from July until October 1968. Travelers in September said that due 
to the serious shortage, patients at Canton city hospitals were advised to 
attend hospitals for treatment until supplies returned to normal. 
Decline in public health during the Cultural Revolution  
The Cultural Revolution has also apparently contributed to a decline 
in public health standards: refuse and nightsoil collections were curtailed 
and rubbish was allowed to pile up in the streets. Mass meetings, rallies

and long marches assisted the spread of infectious diseases. Reports of 
epidemics of cerebral and spinal meningitis have been numerous. 
Shanghai Radio on January 21, 1968 published a notice on sanitation 
with particular emphasis on meningitis prevention methods. An Australian 
student who visited China in early 1968 saw a Peking general hospital 
notice board listing precautionary measures to be taken against type-B 
meningitis. Travelers from Kwangtung reported in early 1968 that since 
the beginning of 1967 type-B meningitis had been evident in Kwangtung hav-
ing been spread by individuals participating in the movement to "exchange 
experiences." The disease was also reported, by travelers in May 1968, 
in Kiangsu where the death rate was rising because of shortages of doctors 
and drugs. 
Mao's thought as an aid to medicine  
On April 18, 1960, the Central Committee issued a directive on health 
work in which it was stated: 
"It is wrong to regard health work as a piece of isolated 
work. Health work is vital because it benefits production 
work and study." 
In the spirit of this directive the authorities have sought to stress 
the political aspects of health work and the importance of putting Mao's 
thought in command. Many of the city doctors and medical staff sent to 
rural areas have encountered difficulties in coping with the lack of facili-
ties and in changing their "bourgeois" desires to remain in city hospitals 
where they feel their talents would be put to better use. The emphasis on 
the use of Mao's thought as a medical aid is designed to overcome such doubts 
and difficulties. 
The New China News Agency on December 4, 1968 reported that in Kansu, 
a rural medical team had "performed a caesarian section with only six artery 
forceps and one scalpel," and that "a throat specialist of another team 
successfully extracted a stone weighing 12 gr. and measuring 5 mm. in diam-
eter, from the bladder of a commune member." 
The report added: 
"All this proves that Mao Tse-tung's thought, once grasped 
can work wonders." 
NCNA on December 10, 1968 broadcast a People's Daily report on a tu-
mor operation in which it stated: 
"The concept of 'incurable diseases' is not in line with 
the thought of Mao Tse-tung."

Medical personnel who, thus inspired, have undertaken risky and dan-
gerous tre44:tments are acclaimed by the press and radio. Army doctors have 
featured prominently in such exploits and are evidently serving a propaganda 
purpose in being specialists in the impossible. 
On January 30, 1969, NCNA reported that doctors and nurses at Hsinhua 
Hospital attached to Shanghai No. 2 Medical College recently saved the life 
of Chou Teh-ming, a worker whose heart had stopped beating for 23 minutes 
after an electric shock. On arrival at the hospital the patient received 
cardiac massage and artificial respiration but he did not respond. He was 
then given an injection of adrenaline despite "bourgeois conventions and 
old medical 'textbooks?" which rule this out in cases of electric shock 
because it causes strong contractions which may go into uncontrollable 
fluttering and result in death. Twenty-three minutes after the patients 
heart had stopped, it started to beat again. Five minutes later he took 
his first breath. 
Sining Radio on December 5, 1968 carried an account of an operation by 
an army mobile medical team on a commune member suffering from a tumor of 
the liver. Although the team were "understaffed and insufficiently equipped," 
they determined to overcome all obstacles with the help of Mao's thought. 
First they cabled the hospital for instructions on how to handle the op-
eration and having received them, the team prepared for the operation. 
"Lacking anesthetics, the team consulted the masses about 
measures for anesthetizing the patient.... On September 23 
the teams studied Chairman Mao's quotations.... They were 
thus much encouraged. Members of the team took their pre-
arranged positions and carried out the surgery while Chairman 
Mao's quotations set to music were sung.... The operation 
ended successfully." 
On November 3, 1968 NCNA acclaimed a PLA medical team using new 
acupuncture techniques on deaf mutes at the Liao Yuan school for deaf mutes. 
They tried an important acupunture point formerly called a "forbidden point" 
by specialists, because to insert the needle that far "would endanger life." 
After acupuncture for half a month 32 of the 157 deaf mutes could shout 
"Long live Chairman Mao." 
Hofei Radio on December 5, 1968 reported that the Anhwei Provincial 
hospital had accepted a post-natal cardiac ailment complicated by fibril-
lation. On her second day in hospital her heart stopped. The medical 
personnel on duty applied heart massage and artificial respiration for 
25 minutes with no success. The medical staff feared to perform open-
heart massage on such a frail patient fearing that she would die, but 
"the workers propaganda team and revolutionary leading 
group organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings 
on ridding oneself of weak thinking and repudiate Liu Shao-
chi's line of having experts manage hospitals."

Peking Radio on April 7, 1968 reported that PLA dispensers with no 
advanced medical training had operated on a child's crushed hand keeping 
politics in command. 
People's Daily on July 9, 1968 in a report on a Shanghai hospital 
stated: 
"Quite a few nurses can do appendectomy and hernia 
surgery. In the neurosurgery department there are 
some nurses who ... as a result of being steeled in 
practical work have mastered the surgery of removing 
brain tumors which formerly could only be done by 
doctors who had had special training and a long period 
of experience."

Excerpts from China Mainland Media ' June-Nov 1968 
Revealing Regime Treatment of Scientists 
Warning To China's Nuclear Scientists. 
Chien San-chiang, Director of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences since 1958, has been denounced as a "capitalist-
roadar and secret enemy agent" who must be "toppled." (Canton Red Guard 
newspaper, Red Flag Bulletin, No. I, June 1968.) 
This attack on Chien, one of China's leading nuclear scientists who, 
although he studied and worked abroad between 1937 and 1948, has since 
held a number of political as well as scientific posts, reflects the 
changed official attitude towards scientists and technicians seen in Mao's 
recent instructions on technical training (Peking Radio, July 21) and in 
reports on the experiences of the Shanghai Lathe Plant in adopting new 
training procedures. 
The emphasis in technical training is now to be on practical labor 
at ordinary factory or agricultural worker level as opposed to theoretical 
research which is said to divorce intellectual workers from the masses. 
Foreign influences and revisionist views such as those attributed to "China's 
Khrushchev" (Liu Shao-chi) are to be resisted. 
The relevance of the latest instructions to scientists has been 
clearly underlined. On July 21, the People's Daily, commending an investi-
gation report on the Shanghai Lathe Plant prepared by the New China News 
Agency. and Wen Hui Pas, urged scientific research departments and "leading 
units" to read it carefully as a "sharp weapon for further criticizing 
and repudiating" Liu Shao-chi's i'counterrevolutionary revisionist line in 
science and technology." 
Wen Hui Pao warned on July 26 that the situation in scientific and 
technological circles was "not satisfactory," and complained that "some 
people" sought to put work first, indulged in personal ambition, relied 
too heavily on foreign textbooks and conventions, and did not move beyond 
the library or laboratory. They did not intend to follow the direction 
indicated "long since" by Mao for science and technology. The newspaper 
also complained that a "number of so-called experts, extremely politically 
reactionary and completely ignorant in their work," had "usurped leader-
ship over science and technology." 
And in research bureaus, the strata were "strictly defined" and the 
"newly emerging forces," (presumably the revolutionary workers), were sup-
pressed. In short, the structure of scientific and technological depart-
ments had become a "hotbed for the breeding of revisionist intellectual 
aristocrats." 
Wen Hui Pao warned on July 26 that some scientific and technological 
units had abandoned the task of "consolidating and expanding" revolutionary 
great alliances and three-way alliances. Instead of struggling against

"capitalist-roaders," they were divided by !'civil wars." A Special Edition  
of Materials (published jointly by two Canton revolutionary groups and 
recording Chou En-lai's meeting on April 20-21, with representatives from 
the National Defense Scientific Commission, the Military Control Commis-
sion, the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building and the Chinese of Sciences), 
dlsclosed that the "violent struggle of the Seventh Ministry of Machine 
Building was connected with the factionalism of the Scientific Commission." 
Both those departments are thought to be eeneerned with China's nuelear 
program. 
Wen Hui Pao laid down certain tasks for scientific and technological 
circles. They were to 
"combine revolutionary mass criticism and repudiation 
'with the purification of the class ranks, with the task of 
struggle-criticism-transformation in individual units and 
with the rectification of the party organization, and carry 
mass criticism and repudiation through to the end." 
This sterner attitude contrasts with that revealed in the 16-point 
decision of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee on the Cultural 
Revolution, adopted on August 8, 1968, which laid down that during the 
cultural crevolution, 
"the policy of unity-criticism-unity should be con-
tinued toward those scientists, technical personnel, and 
working people; so long as they are patriotic and work ac-
tively without opposing the party and Socialism, and so 
long as they have no improper association with foreign 
countries. Those scientists and technical personnel who 
have made contributions would be protected. Assistance may 
be rendered in the gradual transformation of their world 
outlook and work methods." (NCNA, August 8, 1966) 
"Red v. Expert" campatzn continues. 
Laboratories have also become a target of the new wave of the "Bed 
versus Expert" battle now being waged in China. In 1963-65 during the 
period of recovery from the three previous years,necessity caused greater 
reliance on expertise, but currently the emphasis on the leading role of 
workers has given rise to a new prestige for "Redness." Consequently pur-
.chases of technical equipment and money spent on proper research facili-
ties in 1963-64 are now being condemned as bourgeois and counterrevolu-
tionary. 
Eight workers at a silk weaving mill. in SOochow, Kiangsu province,-.

"These fellows were so free with money that they 
bought a good deal of apparatus blindly, regardless of 
whether it was needed or useful." 
The workers also condemned the "appalling extent to which the labora-
tory laced itself above the masses," and concludiull 
"The laboratory staff have gone down to do produc-
tive work on the shop floor where they are being reedu-
cated by the workers." 
The story of the laboratory at Chuchou Tientsin Locomotive and Rolling 
Stock Works was told by Changsha Radio (October 30). This laboratory was 
established in 1958 at which time it was quite simple and in regular touch 
with the workers. But in 1964, encouraged by official emphasis on "expert-
ness," the "reactionary bourgeois technical authorities" spent 8,000 yuan 
on "a fine-looking laboratory" in the main building of the works and they 
also built a second laboratory. 
"These persons also made a big thing of buying instru-
ments, trying several of the same kind at one time." 
The laboratory personnel were 
"gravely divorced from production, sitting around in 
their laboratories and going in for so-called creation, 
invention, scientific research and theorising? They always 
reckoned themselves superior to the workers." 
The report ended: 
"The laboratory staff must take it in turns to do 
production and steel workers must take it in turn to work 
in the laboratory."

Victory for Maoism in Past Decade? 
If the opening of the Ninth Congress marks 
a victory for Maoism over China's more prag-
matic theorists, the events of the past 
decade?the "hundred flowers" campaign, the abortive eco-
nomic "great leap forward" and the development of the ideo-
logical dispute with the Soviet Union (all of which reflect 
Mao's guiding hand) were largely responsible for the disturbed 
political climate which forced its continual postponement. In 
August, 1966, Mao told the Central Committee: "We have 
been preparing for a congress for many years; in all likelihood 
it will be held at a suitable time next year". However, he 
clearly had great difficulty in making sure of majority support 
for his views, and the formation of the new organs of power, the 
revolutionary committees, was continually delayed by factional 
disputes, so that they were not completed at the highest 
administrative level until September, 1968. Even today less 
than half of the provinces claim to be "all-Red", with revolu-
tionary committees at all levels. These difficulties may have 
been the reason why Hsieh Fu-chih laid down in 1967 that the 
congress should start from national level, with the party com-
mittees being formed afterwards at the provincial and county 
levels?a reversal of the old pattern in which provincial con-
gresses came before the main event. It means that the top party 
organs are no longer supported by a broad-based pyramid of 
reliable local organisations. The fact that many local broadcasts 
still refer to persisting factional disputes, the prevalence of the 
theory of "many centres" and continuing support for Liu 
Shao-chi's policies, indicates that there are many problems 
ahead in rebuilding the party at the lower levels.

90,000 teachers, 50,000 doctors 
and 140,000 industrial techni-

considered crucial to an ex-

"As a long-range forecast, 
'the reform of the school system 
and the strong tendency toward 
'being red rather than expert' 
are considered likely to have 
adverse effects in the future on 
the training and supply of

Tokyo, like Washington, does 
not recognize Communist China 
but, unlike the United States, 
Japan conducts and is trying 
to enlarge trade with the main-
land Chinese. In both 1967 and 
1968, Japan carried on the larg-
est trade of any non-Communist 
nation with Communist China. 
Though the supply of physi-
cal resources for industrial de-
velopment is considered ample,, 
Ithe capital investment available 
to exploit those resources is de-
ficient, according to the Jap-
anese analysis. 
"Internal investment in 1965 
was only slightly over the 
amount of 1956," the report 
said. "There are no figures for

tne fact that basic construction

"Coupled with the low pro-

the investment level can hardly 
be expected for some time to

Unable to push forward rapid

capital and technical invest4 
ment, the Japanese analysts 
stated, Chinese authorities 
"groped for a reform of human 
nature through the Cultural 
Revolution u a method of 'set.

' "The material incentive poll.

criticized as 'revisionist,' and in

Small hops forward 
FROM A CORRESPONDENT 
Mao has had his congress. But there Is 
little evidence that this formal victory; 
means' a retUrn to the economies' of the 
1958 Great Leap Forward. The ;'olci 
maoist goals remain:'the cult of the 
commune, of self-sufficiency,"' of 
of 
decentralisation of industry, of , 
as against material incentives. But th< 
reckless urgency and naive optimism with 
which they were once pursued seem' to 
have gone?perhaps, now. that Mao is 75,' 
gone for good. 
The economic disruptions wrought' by 
the cultural revolution never, matched 
those of the great leap, but there has been 
a' toll. The recovery in industrial pro-
duction during the 'early, '196os was 
actually accelerated in 1966, despite the 
initial launching of the cultural reyolution, 
but in 1967 output probably "fell by 
between to and 20 per cent: ' The slide 
has since been halted,- but' even on' the 
most generous interpretation industrial 
Production at the end of 1968 was, 
reckoned to be little higher than in z 965; 
and only some 50 per cent higher 'than in 
1957. ' ' . ? `" 
True,' agricultural production' has been 
blessed by good weather and spared the. 
full impact of the cultural revolution. 
Many China-watchers now reckon that 
the population numbers no . more than. 
roughly 720 million and that annual grain, 
output in the past four years. has, reached.

has also, restored. its reserves of hard 
foreign. exchange, . perhaps by now to 
nearly .$i,000 million, the equivalent of 
 eiglit months' imports.from the West. But, 
on any estimate, grain output per bead; 
is still below ,the 1957 level. Moreover,:

There are two 'qualifying factors, how-

The doubtful existence, of a 
 ne hina 
itteports from Peking agree ?that 
a new atmosphere! is about" in the 
Chinese capital. The cultural revolution 
has not been ended by the ninth party 
congress and may never now be for. 
malty wound up, since the evil spirit of 
capitalism will always be, abroad. But 
for the ordinary people the political 
load has been lightened. Foreigners find 
that shop assistants are more polite; the 
train journey, can be accomplished 
without the loudspeaker blaring out the 
thoughts of Mao set to mimic or 
otherwise; and if there are any Political' 
posters left in Peking they flap unre-
garded 'on out-of-the-way walls. The 
cymbals', and gongs, that herald yet 
another demonstration . are no longer, 
heard. 
All this might suggest a new start in 
I China. Are not ambassadors going back 
; to their posts after more than two years' 
absence? Does?this not mean that China 
is resuming its contacts with the outside 
world? Such assumptions are altogether 
too sanguine. A new. China of some 
kind may be taking shape after the 
ninth party et:ingress:but its outline is 
not , visible ? and its existence must 
remain in doubt. The truth is that the 
long-awaited ninth party congress told 
us yery little, offered no prospects, and 
thus far has given birth to nothing. As 
simple proof of this one might take the 
daily English bulletin of the official 
New China News Agency. In the eight 
weeks since the congress ended "the 
headlined items in this bulletin have 
been as follows: 13 'dealing 'in retro-
spect with the congress itself and the 
campaign for unity in China; 17 attacks 
or angry notes ? exchanged , with the 
Russians, .and other attacks were on the 
United States (3), India and Bulgaria (1 
each). Occasions of support were one 
each for Vietnam, Albania and Tenzer' 
nia. 'On 11 occasions no items of news 
was worth headlining. 
That is to say not one single promi. 
nent item has dealt with current events 
in China, or future events, or economic 
plans, or anything to suggest that 
internal conditions have taken ,a new 
turn. Nor was there anything in the 
congress itself that promised change. 
Where the eighth party congress in 1956 
invited delegates from all over the 
communist world, the ninth had none; 
where the eighth published all the 
speeches in a volume of 1,000 pages, 
the ninth has given only the text of Lin 
Piao's report and the revised constitu-
tion : where the eighth set' forth future 
economic plans. the ninth offered a

himself that China has' been saved for a

Nevertheless the abiding, impression 
is that China is still in a 'fair state ?of 
disarray. The theme of unity pro-

centre 'this seems to be true. China's 
'inner cabinet must now be regarded as 
the standing committee of the political 
bureau in which Mao, Lin Piao and 
Chou En-lai are the awkward triutrivi-

faithful secretary and spokesman, and 
K'ang Sheng, the shadowy, ex-Comin-

obvious gap between these five and the 
?rest, of the political bureau, 'made up

picked by Lin Piao, plus Mrs. Mao and 
Mrs. !Lin. It does not look a body to 
compare in ex perience .and , homogeneity 
'with the men who formed the old 
politieal bureau. ? " 
The Same iS true of the'central 
committee. The committee elected at 
the eighth party. congress. in 1956 were 
men of long revolutionary experience in 
party,: army and government; 'men 
whose positions for the ?'most part

ornmunIst unina s economy, 
for all the regime's propaganda 
trumpeting about its dynamism, 
is Asia's prime- stretcher case. 
In this 20th year of commu-
nist rule on the mainland, there 
is not even the slightest hint 
'available that China's present 
leaders have come up with a 
'solution to the problem of the 
nation's plodding economy: 
"The Thoughts of Chairman 
Mao Tse-tung" have perhaps 
motivated some Workers at low, 
er lets but there are no,. clues 
In production figures to suggest 
that the chairman's pep talks 
have obtained results beyond 
short-term hypnosis. 
, Communist China's economiC 
stagnation is all the more 
shocking when viewed from the 
free world's second biggest pro-
ducer in terms of gross national 
product (GNP). 
1 The result is that Communist 
China, which looks very strong 
and foreboding on 'the map, is 
really a second-rate power. It 
simply does not have the econ 
noinic'wherewithal to .be other-
Wise. 
; These considerations are in-, 
Creasingly important ,as more 
and more discussions are being 
held on the future of Asia, the 
US role in Asia, and the con-
cepts of one, two or three 
Chinas. 
Communist China's economic, 
growth is expected to creep 
along at an unspectacular four, 
Percent: for the next few' years,. 
according to a report by the 
japanese Foreign Ministry. 
I The Japanese report concurs 
with information available in 
}Tong Kong to the effect that a 
measure of political stability is 
returning to China after the 
tumultuous cultural revolution. 
But its agricultural produc-
tion in 1968 is believed to have 
'fallen short of the 1907 level 
of 2,000,000 tons, This is due 
partly to floods and drought in 
different parts of the country' 
last June 'and July and to the 
shortage of fertilizer. 
Industrial output is estimated 
to have dipped by 10 to 15 per 
cent last year. 
Some comparisons and trade 
figures help reveal ,the plight 
of China's economy. 
One example is steel output. 
China's production is around 
12,000,000 tons annually or 
about one-fifth of Japan's pro-
duction. 
Annual oil consumption 
figures ard revealing also. Per 
capita usage of oil in China is 
eight to 1 gallons, compared 
to 1,800 gallons per capita in 
the US, 800 gallons in the So-
viet Union and 200 gallons in 
-Japan. 
' China's modest -progress in 
'industry, furthermore, has been 
mostly borrowed from abroad: 
Complete "turn-key" plants 
have been set up but these 
have apparently not made a 
demonstrable effect on the eco, 
nomy. 
The World Bank estimated 
China's per capita income In 
1966 at $95. That's below the 
figures for such countries as 
Cambodia, Ceylon and Thailand, 
Nationalist China, by con-

directly traced to the cultural

The Japan External Trade

Ing Communist China's trade 
with its most important non. 
communist trading partners, 
noted a 17.8 percent decline in 
China's total trade in the first 
six months of 1968. 
Exports fell by 1:3.5 percent 
and imports dropped by 22.1 
perat in that period. The 
treed for the last half of 1968 
suggests no upturn. 
Trade with communist coun-
tries also has slowed. UN 
figures show that trade be-

Communist China in 1908 fell 
to five percent of its peak level 
in 1950.

Peking's cutback of aid to

that the cuts were made partly.

growing as China imports food,' 
The question arises-of China's 
long-range potential for eco-,

not come easily. It could be. 
that China, is .involved in

N the early, conspiratorial ays 
? communism, party congresses were held 
so that opposing factions could slug it ott 
and decide the next stage of the revolt), 
tion. In recent years, ruling parties have 
staged elaborate congresses to give mes 
chanical approval to major decisions al. 
'ready reached by a small inner circle o 
career bureaucrats and theoreticians. 
The ninth national congress of. the 
Chinese Communist party apparently had 
elements of the old and the new. 
Becauge of the time involved (24 days); 
the rumor-proof secrecy (no one discov? 
ered in which building meetings were 
held) and the visible preparations, whick 
seemed to have anticipated a shorte ? 
, meeting, it is reasonable to conclude tha 
there was disagreement. The untidy state 
of the party just before the tongresi 
virtually guaranteed conflict. ; ? 
As the congress publicly produced ex 
achy what was expected of it, it could bc , 
described as staged. There was mon i 
planning evident, however, in the nois3\ 
celebrations of hundreds of. millions o 
Chinese this past week in the sweaty 
hysterical spectacle that ancient lanc 
produces. 
Mao exalted 
The hoarse throats and the. hypnotic 
. chanting slogans that marked the `victon' 
?ry" of the congress were largely saluting , 
.. the one man who still dominates China ?? 
; with his will and personality. He is Mao 
?! Tse-tung, at 75 the deified father-figure of-: 
the country. 
' ? 4 
Mr, Mao was continued as the leader, 
? the party chairman. Better still, the con-
gress elevated him officially to the same , 
exalted philosophical rank a5 Marx and', 
Lenin, a promotion that the Chinese can , 
take pride in, and the rest of the Coin-, 
munist ruling parties (except the Albani-
ans) can reject. 
The congress gave China a new faith. 
It was not called "Z?laoisrn," which would 
be too simple and undignified. Rather it 
was called "Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse 
tung thought." .And it confirmed Lin - 
Piao, the quiet military strategist With 
.the heavy eyebrows, the most faithful 
conduit of Chairman Mao's ideas, as his 
successor.

For the future, the congress promised 
China me of what it has hod during the. 
past sevcral years. The cultural revolu-
tion was "victorious" but not yet ended. 
Massive :ampaigns of ideological educa-
tion were going to be dosed out as cures

This wr s all that was produced in three 
sober, la .gely 'sterile communiques, the 
new and somewhat vague constitution 
and finaLy the list of 279 names that 
comprised a new central committee., 
Egalitarian dream 
? 
The ccngress .was, of course, much 
more then that. With gale winds of 
change I lowing through China, it ap-; 
peered to be one of the'last, great scenes, 
in the second revolution of Mao Tse-tung. 
Nearly 29 years before, Chairman Mao' 
had proclaimed the People's Republic of: 
China, th fruit of a guerrilla revolution. 
and civil war, for Which he could thank 
hated fol eign invaders and a softened 
and corroded Nationalist' opposition. 
Though Chairman Mao led it, that was a 
revolutior from below, relying on Ehe 
messes o millions of posir or disaffected 
Chinese. 
'A corn )rex man, Chairman Mao has 
simple but utopian goals. Not only has he 
worked t) restore China to its ancient 
greatness but he was also driven by the 
dream of an egalitarian China, free front 
the hated exploitation of the past?a land 
where tit( worker and peasant would be 
as culturc d as the intellectual who would 
also do m mual labor., ' 
Hatred had driven Chairman Mao to 
despise rr andarins of any persuasion. He 
considered them a ? bureaucracy out of 
touch will, the people, snooty intellectuals 
quoting classics, seeking special pay and 
special pn.vileges. 
'Slum bid on "great leap" 
Success in guerrilla war, in mass edu-
cation anc in propaganda techniques had 
convinced Chairman Mao that he could 
"remold the majority into new men." He 
believed hat subjective will could be 
turned int) objective force. With some-
thing like 500,000,000 backward, supersti-
tious peasants living barely above sub-
sistence in a tired land, China profited by 
a Mao preaching the impossible. 
Chairmai Mao's techniques worked un-
til the "g-eat leap

error but fought back to wipe out exactly 
What he feared would ruin his purist 
dreams. ' 
. Peasants were thriving with their nri-
vete plots, private pigs and private mar-
kets. Workers were getting incentive pay 
rather than laboring for the ideological 
glory. The party was full'of experts and 
managers, drifting from Chairman Mao's 
Idealized contact with the masses. Chair-
man Mao never saw nor wanted to sea 
that China was progressing, ?just, as he 
never cared to see Russian progress. All 
he could sea was his egalitarian: vision. 
being destroyed by his old comrades irt 
arms. , ; .

By 1962, he was-striking back. Wlaat'tho 
outside world saw as a conflict between., 
ideologues and, pragmatists was the be-
ginning of Chairman Mao's accond reps-
lution. By 1966, Chairman Mao alone 
carefully ripped off the head of the party 
he had built and slashed .at its innards; 
using Red Guard students and his mass 
techniques of rebellion. 
'The giant party of 18,000,000 members 
that controlled every aspect of Chinese 
life fought back, but in the end it fell 
?defeated. Down went most of its leaders, 
Liu Shao.chl and others, denounded as 
traitors. History was rewritten to Show.

years, when all they had done in fact was' 
to jolly him along. ci 
? 
Chairman Mao had to call in Lin Pia, 
and.. the army to maintain order. Tho; 
military is still there, on farm and in, 
factory, to put down resisting "class enc.: 
rnies.' The chairman had to entice back, 
cadres, who finally restored some sembl,

revolutionaries. But it took two long'

The author of this work, Wang Ming, is a veteran of the 
Communist Party of China and of the Chinese people's struggle 
for socialism. He was a member of the central leadership of the 
party through the years of arduot4s and perilous underground 
struggle against the bloody repression by which Chiang Kai-shek 
tried to destroy the Party physically by murdering scores of thou-
sands of the finest sons of the working class.,---thousands of them 
by beheading in public without even the pretence of a trial. From 
January 1931 until January 1935 Wang Ming was the First 
Secretary of the Party under* the illegal party name of Chen 
Shao-pl. 
In January 1935, in the course of the famous Long March. 
Mai Tse-tung became First Secretary and Wang Ming was 
assigned to the position of representative of the Central Commit-
tee of the Communist Party of China to the Communist Inter-
national. In that capacity he participated actively in the prepara-
tion of George Dimitrov's famous report to the 7th World Con-
gress and he was elected by the Congress of the Executive Com, 
mittee. 
Wang Ming worked as the representative of the Chinese 
Party in the world centre of the Comintern until that body dis-
solved in 1943. After that he continued, by decision of the leader-
ship of the Chinese Party, to be its representative in Moscow. He 
negotiated and arranged the details of the decisive assistance that 
was extended to the Chinese revolution by the Soviet Union. 
Throughout those years he continued to be an active member of 
the leadership of the CPC and he was re-elected to its Central 
Committee at its 8th Congress in 1956. 
While, constitutionally, Wang Ming is a full member of the 
Central Committee of the CPC, he is not able to play an active 
role in the Central Committee of the Party in China today. Those 
who read this document will readily understand why. '

In domestic policy the Maoists are 
doing their utmost to drag China onto 
the dismal road of political reaction, 
economic chaos, cultural retrogression 
and poverty. In foreign policy they use 
all their resources to drag China onto 
the reactionary and dangerous road of 
hostility for the Soviet Union and other 
socialist countries, split the world corn-
monist and working-class movement, 
subvert the national liberation, social-
progressive and democratic movements 
and also the world peace movement, 
and provoke another world war. 
At the same time thousands upon 
thousands tit Communists and Young 
Communist Leaguers, workers, peasants 
and intellectuals, officers and men of the 
PLA and of the public security forces, 
and foremost youth and juveniles have 
selflessly risen against the Maoist 
counter-revolutionary military coup and 
Mao Tse-tung's personal dictatorship. 
They have risen in defence of Marxism-
Leninism, the Communist Party and the 
legal state authority, in defence of the 
gains of the Chinese revolution and the 
cause of socialism. In contrast to Mao 
Tse-tung and his group they aim to put 
China, in domestic policy, on the bright 
road of political freedom, economic 
fluorescence, cultural progress and a 
happy life, and, in foreign policy, on the 
road to win progress, world security, on 
the road of friendship, co-operation, al-
Hance and mutual assistance With the 
Soviet Union and other socialist coun-
tries, the road of unity and co-operation 
with the world communist and working-
class movement and with the national 
liberation, social-progressive and democ-
retie movements, the road of concerted 
struggle with all the peoples for world 
peace, to avert another world war. 
At the very outset of the so-called 
"cultural revolution" Mao Tse-tung and 
his group had openly proclaimed that 
it was a life and death struggle be-
tween two roads, between two classes, 
between two lines. Countless facts show 
that the anti-communist, anti-Soviet, anti-
popular counter-revolutionary Maoist 
group is indeed a "handful of people in 
authority taking the capitalist road," 
that they are in fact championing the 
interests of the bourgeoisie and pursu-
ing a reactionary, bourgeois policy. 
The leaders and cadres of the Party, a 
state, military and mass organizations h 
who are in the front ranks of the anti- t 
Maoist revolutionary struggle are the P 
real revolutionaries who are following a 
the socialist road, and they are indeed e 
championing the interests of the work- A 
ers, peasants and intellectuals and pur- s 
suing a proletarian revolutionary policy. L

Judging by indisputable facts and o 
the basis of my own experience gaine 
in the struggle against the thought an 
policy of Mao Tse-tung in the course o 
decades, I should like first and foremos 
to say that the blame for the presen 
catastrophic state in which the CPC an 
China now find themselves devolves pr 
manly on Mao Tse-tung, on his though 
and policy and his extremely self-cen 
tred, extremely careerist, criminal cal 
culations. 
At first Mao Tse-tung and his grou 
shifted and dodged, claiming that Ma 
Tse-tung was accomplishing only a "cul 
tura' revolution," whose purpose was to 
"safeguard the dictatorship of the pro-
letariat," "safeguard the socialist sys 
tern," and "avert the restoration of capi 
talism." They said that the "cultural 
revolution" was aimed only at a "hand-
ful of persons in authority in the Party 
taking the capitalist road" and "cham-
pions of the bourgeois reactionary line," 
only against "counter-revolutionary revi-
sionists," "traitors" and so on. 
However, facts are stronger than de-
magogy. They cannot be twisted. Let us 
see what Mao Tse-tung is really doing. 
TEN MAJOR CRIMES COMMITTED BY 
MAO TSE-TUNG IN CHINA 
1. He is trying to expunge Marxism-
Leninism from the minds of the Com-
munists and working people of China 
and replace it with the anti-Marxist, 
anti-Leninist thought of Mao Tse-tung. 
He insists that the "thought of Mao 
Tse-tung must ,capture all ideological 
positions," that the "thought of Mao Tse-
tung are the highest instructions in all 
spheres of life," that the "thought of 
Mao Tse-tung are the absolute autho-
rity" and so forth. At the same time he 
declares that Marxism-Leninism is "ob-
solete" and trumpets that "the world 
has entered a new epoch?the epoch of 
the thought of Mao Tse-tung?' 
n sale of his sinister anti-Marxist, anti-
d Leninist "thought" in China and abroad, 
d everything he is doing proves that in 
f effect he is using the screen of Marxism-
t Leninism to destroy Marxism-Leninism. 
t Actually he is replacing Marxism-Lenin-
d ism with the anti-Marxist, anti-Leninist 
i- reactionary "thought" of Mao Tse-tung. 
? 2, He is smashing the Comnumist 
. Party of China and preparing to re-
place it with an essentially anti-Corn-
munist party which will be "Communist" 
o in name only. 
In a tatzupao written by him person-
ally on August 5, 1966 he proclaimed 
the slogan "open fire at the headquart-
ers," which was the signal for the rout 
- of the CPC. He crushed the CC CPC 
that ,was elected by the 8th Congress Of 
the CPC. According to reports from vari-
ous sources, of the 174 members and al-
ternate members of the CC CPC nearly 
four-fifths have been subjected to re-
pression. All the members of the Poli-
tical Bureau of the CC and its Standing 
Committee as well as of the Secretariat 
of the CC, elected prior to the 11th Ple-
nary Meeting of the CC, with the excep-
tion of Mao Tse-tung and a few persons 
from his group, have been brutally per-
secuted on the basis of all sorts of false 
accusations. They include the Deputy 
Chairman of the CC Liu Shao-chi, Chu 
Teh, Chen Yun, the General Secretary of 
the CC Teng Hsiao-ping, members of the 
Political Bureau Peng Teh-huai, Ho 
Lung, Chen Yi, Peng Chen, Tan Chen. 
un, Lu Fu-chun, Lieu Po-cheng, Tung Pi-
wu, Li Hsien-nien, Li Ching-chaure alter-
nate members of the Political Bureau 
Ulanfu, Chang Wen-tien, Lu Ting-yi, Po 
Yi-po, members of the CC Secretariat 
Wang Chia-hsiang, Tang Cheng, Teng Tzu-
hui, Huan Ke-cheng, Lo Tui-ching, Tao 
Chu, Wang Jen-chung, Liu Ning-i, Li 
Hsueh-feng, alternate members of the 
? CC Secretariat Yang Shang-kun, Hu 
Chiao-mu and Liu Lan-tao. All these 
comrades were without foundation an.
of "counter-revolutionaty revision-
ism," branded "traitors" and "elements 
against the three" ("elements opposing 
Mao Tse-tung, the Party and socialism") 
and subjected to cruel repression, per-
secution and insults. Of these some were 
"defiled," others "defeated," still others 
"overthrown," arrested, killed, declared 
as deserving to be "burnt alive," slan-
dered, insulted or publicly humiliated. 
Premier of the State Council Chou En-
lai, who was also Deputy Chairman of 
the CC until the 11th Plenary Meeting 
of the CC, was likewise repeatedly de-
clared by the hungweipings as deserving 
W4bAolyabtfino tiosy_gao Chu, who 
He has banned the reading of Marxist-
Leninist literature. He burns progres-
sive Marxist-Leninist literature. He calls 
Marxism-Leninism "revisionism" or "dog-
matism." Earlier he had called Marxist-
Leninists "dogmatists," now he calls 
hem "counter-revolutionary revisionists" 
nd persecutes and destroys them. He 
as made the persecution and destruc-
ion of Marxist-Leninists ideologically, 
olitically, organizationally, spiritually 
nd physically the principal means of 
radicating Marxism-Leninism in China. 
though at times he is compelled to use 
uch an authoritative term as Marxism-
eninism as an honourable_ 7i.9 Vi 1

Bureau and of its Standing Committee 
at the 11th Plenary Meeting of the CC, 
has been subjected to brutal repression, 
while Nieh Hung-chen, Hsueh Hsiang-
chen and Yeh Chien-ying, who were elec-
ted members of the Political Bureau, 
have fallen into disfavour. Mao Tse-tung 
is destroying Party committees and CPC 
cells of all levels. Wherever it has been, 
possible he has sent hungvvelpings, Cm-
fans, the military and the police 
mercilessly to smash territorial bureaus 
of the CC CPC, provincial, municipal, 
district, county and regional Party com-
mittees, and Party cells at workshops, 
factories, 'mines, transport organizations 
and rural production teams, and also 
brutally to persecute and destroy lead-
ing functionaries and cadres of the Party 
committees. 
The ,persecution and physical annihi: 
lation of Party leaders, cadres and rank-
and-file members has become Mao Tse-
tung's main means of destroying the 
CPC. 
Mao Tse-tung and his group have dealt 
our Party, a severe blow such as the 
International imperialists, the Peiyang 
warlords or the Kuomintang of Chiang 
Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei could not 
Inflict in the course of decades. But they 
have not been able to destroy the Party, 
which has nearly 25 million members 
and enjoys tremendous prestige and the 
all-round support of the working class 
and the whole people. 
Although in issuing orders and instruc-
tions for all sorts of sinister actions 
Mao Tse-tung still demagogically uses 
the name of such an authoritative organ 
as the CC CPC, it is nothing more than 
what is correctly described in a Chinese 
proverb, which says: "Where the skin 
is lost what is the hair to cling on to?" 
Since Mao Tse-tung has already routed 
the Communist Party of China and its 
leading organs?the CC and its Political 
Bureau?how and on what grounds can 
he still call himself Chairman of the 
Military Committee of the CC CPC? 
Since these organs of the CPC have, in 
effect, ceased to exist, on what grounds 
does Mao Tse-tung commit acts of vil-
lainy in their name? What right does 
Mao Tse-tung have to use the name of 
the CC CPC to guide the so-called "Group 
for Cultural Revolution Affairs at, the 
CC CPC" to all sorts of anti-communist, 
anti ? popular, counter - revolutionary 
crimes? Who gave Mao Tse-tung the 
right to convene the so-called 11th and 
12th "plenary meetings of the CC CPC"? 
No matter how much he tries to use 
the signboards "CPC" and "CC CPC" to

tray him as an anti-Communist from 
head to toe. His group is inconte itabky 
an anti-Communist clique. He 3ends 
every effort to destroy the CPC as a 
genuine Marxist-Leninist, revoluti nary 
Party of the working class, a Party tha t 
emphatically opposes the reacti )nari 
thought and policies of Mao Tse-tting in 
general, and his counter-revolutionari 
military coup masked as a "eulturd 
re-
volution" in particular. 
He plans to organize a false Com.' 
munist Party of his supporters to sup-
ersede the former real CPC. A campaign 
to "prepare" for the so-called "9th Con-
gress of the CPC" was conductec for 
this purpose last year. Actually these 
were not preparations for the 9th Con-
gress of the CPC but only preparations 
for an assemblage of anti-Commuilsts, 
of Maoists. 
The decision of the so-called "12th Ex. 
tended Plenary Meeting of the CPC" was 
published recently in Peking. Thi: , as 
everybody knows, was a plenary meeting 
withbut the participation of the, ever-
whelming majority of members an I al-
ternate members of the CC CPC, In-
stead, it was attended by members of 
Oe so-called "Group for Cultural Revo-
lution Affairs," representatives of the 
hungweipings and tsaofans, of the pro-
vincial "revolutionary committees" and 
of military leaders favoured by Mao Tse-
tung. Incidentally, ,Mao Tse-tung grant, 
ed all of them the "right of a casting 
vote" of members of the CC CPC. The 
decision stated that the so-called '9th 
Congress of the CPC" would be corwen-
ed in the immediate future. On the one 
hand this decision proclaimed that dele-
gates to this "congress" must be those 
who were utterly devoted to Chairman 
Mao and to his thought, those who had 
shown this devotion? in the course of 
the "cultural revolution," i.e., those hung-
weipings, tsaofans and military who had 
been particularly vicious. On the oilier 
hand, it was announced that there we uld 
be another purge of Communists, Yong 
Communist Leaguers, foremost worlars, 
intellectuals and peasants at every ofice, 
factory and educational institution, in 
every people's commune and in el,ery 
family. Moreover, the draft of the so: 
called "New Rules of the CPC" to be 
submitted for endorsement to the com-
ing "9th Congress" have been circulated. 
This is a monstrous anti-Communist and 
anti-democratic document. 
Mao Tse-tung's notorious thesis of 
"removing the old and absorbing the 
new," which has been given wide pub-
CPYRGHT 
fty in recen9OO1 moniPs and has now 
been formally included in the above-
mentioned "draft Rules," is a cynically, 
frank admission of the fact that he is 
preparing to make away completely with 
the real Communist Party of China and 
replace it with a new false Communist 
Party, which he plans to use to further 
his personal aims. All this irrefutably 
proves that the so-called "9th Congress 
of the CPC" will be, in fact, a gathering 
of Mao Tse-tung's toadies even though 
a small group of leading functionaries 
and cadres of the CPC are to be allow-
ed to attend in order to hide its real 
face with the purpose of misleading the 
Chinete people and public opinion 
abroad. But their participation cannot 
in the least change its true, anti-Com-
munist nature. "Delegations" from for-
eign pseudo-Communist parties will 
most certainly attend this gathering.' It 
will, indeed be a conclave of traitors and 
renegades of all hues, who together 
sign an anti-Communist, anti-Soviet, 
anti-popular tune under the direction of 
Mao Tse-tung. 
? A new Maoist anti-Marxist, anti-Lenin-
ist, reactionary party, "Communist" in 
name but anti-Communist in substance 
is to be formed at this gathering. Mao 
Tse-tung reckons that this is the only 
kind of party which he can use as a 
blind tool to prop up his tottering im-
perial throne and pursue reactionary 
domestic and foreign policies. He cal-
culates that this is the only kind of 
party that can be used as an obedient 
tool for the continuation of the sinister 
work he has bequeathed to Lin Piao, 
the successor he has himself appointed. 
Judging by reports from various sour-
ces, after this false Communist Party 
'is formed Mao Tse-tung plans to follow 
the example of his predecessor and teach-
er?the Judas Trotsky?to set up an anti; 
Communist, counter-revolutionary Mao: 
ist "International." I am' deeply con-
vinced that not only Chinese Commun-
ists and the Chinese people but also? 
Communists and their friends through-' 
out the world take a firm stand against 
these machinations of Mao Tse-tung.

Mao Tse-tung tried to use the slogan 
of the destruction of the old bourgeois 
state machine as a pretext for crushing 
the constitutional state organs of peo-
ple's power in China. He has completely 
paralyzed the higher legislative body?
the National People's Congress and its 
Standing Committee, both of which had 
been elected in accordance with the 
Constitution, The Chairman, Deputy 
Chairmen, members of the Standing 
Committee and most of the deputies of 
the NPC have been savagely persecuted 
on all sorts of false accusations levelled 
at them by Mao Tse-tung. 
To all intents and purposes, the State 
Council, which is the highest organ of 
executive 'power in China, has also been 
paralyzed. More than two-thirds of the 
Premier's deputies have been relieved of 
their posts or arrested, and the remain-
ing deputies have been slandered and 
attacked by the hungweipings and tsao-
fans. 
With the exception of the Defence 
Ministry and a few other offices, the min-
istries and state committees subordina-
ted to the State Council were placed 
under the control of hungweipings and 
tsaofans and then an integrated mili-
tary control was established over them. 
Allany high-ranking officials of the State 
Council and Ministries have been killed, 
wounded, baited until they lost their 
health or subjected to other repressions 
in the form of unbearable, humiliating 
or health-destroying hard labor. 
Provincial a.nd lower people's con-
gresses and people's councils have been 
made away with, and legal organs ? 
people's courts and people's procura-
tor's offices of all levels?have likewise 
ceased to function. Their heads and 
cadres have been either persecuted or 
physically destroyed. The exceptions are 
the members of the national bourgeoisie 
in all legislative and executive bodies. 
They have not been touched at all by 
Mao Tse-rung. 
Mao Tse-tung has elected to liquidate 
.the Party backbone and foremost repre-
sentatives of non-Party people in organs 
as the cardinal means of destroying 
these organs of power. In planting so-
called "rc -)Ititionary committees," Mao 
Tse-tung counted on creating a weapon r 
of his personal military dictatorship. s 
Their paramount task is to persecute 
and annihilate Communists,. Young 
Communist Leaguers, revolutionary e 
servicemen and foremost workers, pea- r, 
? 
sants and intellectuals. As soon as a 
so-called "revolutionary committee" m ai 
set up, hungweipings led by the ch2ip-
man of the "revolutionary committe 
publicly smashed the signboards of the 
local CPC committee and of the peopl es 
committee. 
This was followed by the publicati r, 
of notices ordering all officials of lora 
Party organizations and Communists a 
well as cadres of the organs of powe 
to register at the "revolutionary con 
mittee" within three days and await far-
ther sanctions. Arrest, exile, imprisca 
ment or murder awaited many of thost 
who registered and also those who cd 
not register but were later discovered,? 
Communists who headed provincial or 
other local Party organizations or 
people's committees and charged wi h 
being "counter-revolutionary revision, 
ists," "traitors" or "Soviet spies" we T 
brutally executed at public rallies n 
many localities where so-called "rev> 
lutionary committees" were 'formed. A .e 
these not typical features of an an 1- 
communist coup of any, cout?ter-revol 
tion? ' 
The key role in the "revolutionary 
committees" is played by military peop e 
whom Mao Tse-tung still manages to 
delude. The so-called 'Leftist element:" 
(hungweipings and tsaofans) are men-
ly their assistants, while the few form r 
Party and administrative cadres who 
have been recruited with the help of 
the "tripartite alliance" slogan play tt e 
role of supernumeraries. In spite cf 
Mao Tse-tung's having proclaimed the, 
slogans of "struggle against the dictato 
ship of the bourgeoisie" and "defence cf  
the dictatorship of the proletariat," a I 
his actions prove the reverse,: behind 
the screen of "defending the dictator-
ship of the proletariat" he is destroy-
ing the people's power and replacing it 
with his personal reactionary Military 
dictatorship. 
4. He is inflicting harm on the People's 
Liberation Army, splitting its ranks and 
employing it as a blind tool for his own 
personal ends directed against the Party 
and the people. 
Mao Tse-tung has 'used part of the 
PLA as an instrument of the counter-
evolutionary coup and reactionary per-
onal military dictatorship, concentrated 
art of the PLA on seizing power from 
Communist Party and the people's gov-
rnment, killing Communists, workers, 
easants and inteljectuak;  
part of the PLA against another pan 
and ordered the PLA to pursue his re. 
actionary policy of "three supports" 
and "two military measures."** 
He' utilized the abolition of military 
ranks as a means for isolating in one 
blow the marshals, generals and officers 
who held no military posts from any 
contact with the arty, Mao Tie-tung 
has purged and persecuted marshals, 
generals, officers and sergeants of the 
PLA. Of the nine marshals, all except 
Lin Piao have been subjected to brutal 
persecution and indignities and some, 
for example, Marshals Peng' Teh-huai 
and Ho Lung, have even been arrested. 
The number of generals and admirals 
of the army, navy and air force re-
moved from their posts and persecuted, 
runs, according to incomplete data, 
from 70 tO 80. According to information 
from various sources, among those pur-
ged are four Deputy Defence Ministers, 
the Chief of the General Staff and seve-
ral of his Deputies, Chief of the Opera-
tional Department of the General Staff 
and his Deputy, Chief of the Central 
Political Administration and two of his 
Deputies, three Deputy Commissars of 
the Public Security Forces,' three Deputy 
Commanders, the Commissar and First, 
Deputy Commissar of the Navy, the 
Commander, four Deputy Commanders 
and three Commissars of the Artillery, 
seven Deputy Commanders, the Commis-
sar and two Deputy Commissars of the 
Air Force, Commander of the Armored 
Forces and his Deputy, three Deputy 
Commanders and Deputy Commissar of 
the Railway Forces, Deputy Commander, 
*Three supports: "support of the1. 
Lefts," meaning support of the hung-
weipings and tsaofans, "support of in-
dustry" and "support of agriculture", 
which means the establishment of mili-
tary control over the country's entire 
economy. 
**Two military measures: "military 
administration," which signifies the es-
tablishrnent of a military regime in the 
cities and countryside, In factories, offi-
ces and educational establishments to 
watch the workers, peasants, intellee-
tuals and students and persecute them: 
"military training", which means that 
the entire population, young and old, is 
forced at the point of the bayonet "to 
study Mao Tse-tung's thought" and that 
military drill is introduced in schools 
and higher educational establishments,

Aiti-Aircrafgtilitn, five Deputy Chiefs, 
the Commissar and Deputy Commissar 
of t1-1. Central Administration of the 
Logistics Service, and so on. 
Still more commissars and political 
workers were persecuted among the me-
dium-rank and junior officers. More than 
half of the personnel in the General 
Staff and the Central Political Adminis-
tration of the PLA have been removed 
from their posts and persecuted; the 
removal and persecution of the corn-
panders of the Peking Military Area and 
the Peking garrison was even reported 
on two occasions. The facts show that 
Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao not only 
carried through a mass purge, persecuted 
and annihipted the higher commanders 
and commissars and also the command-
ers and political workers of all ranks in 
the former First, Second and Third Field 
Armies?, which they have always regard-
ed as an alien body, but they also pur-
ged, persecuted and annihilated, group 
after group, the higher commanders, 
commissars, commanders and political 
workers of the former Fourth Field 
Army whom Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao 
did not trust or who Chiang ,Ching 
,thought did not obey her orders. 
They are ruthlessly purging the corn-
munist backbone of the PLA and are 
'planning to replace wholesale the cadres 
'of Communists and members of the 
Young Communist League in the PLA 
with the new men tried and tested in 
the course of the "cultural revolution". 
All this is being done to make it easier 
for Mao Tse-tung, Lin Piao and Chiang 
Ching to usurp all the power in the 
PLA and to convert, in a conspiratorial 
way, the People's Liberation Army, crea-
ted and led by the Communist Party, 
into their personal anti-communist hord, 
es directed against the people. 
They have already set up special army 
units directly subordinated to the 
"headquarters of Mao Tse-tung". It is 
only with the help of these units that 
Communists, the population and "un-
reliable" detachments of the PLA are 
suppressed and the "revolutionary com-
mittees" in the localities are protected. 
All this demonstrates the fear of Mao 
Tse-tung and his supporters in face of 
the dissatisfaction mounting in the 
army. Indeed, the commanders, politi-
cal workers and soldiers of the PLA will 
not be able to tolerate for long the pre-
sent situation. Sooner or later they will 
rise up to fight against Mao Tse-tung 
and his group, for the restoration of a i 
? genuine Chinese Communist Party and I 
the building of socialism in China.

tion; he has disbanded the Young Com-
munist League of China and is replac-
ing it with the reactionary organiza-
tion of hungweipings. 
On the one hand, Mao Tse-tung has 
disbanded the Young Communist Lea-
gue and the Young Pioneer Organization 
and is brutally persecuting the leaders of 
the YCL and the Young Pioneers, their 
functionaries and YCL members. On the 
other hand, utilizing the military and 
the police as the leading core and back-
bone of command, he has by coercion 
,and deception compelled part of the 
university students and secondary and 
elementary school pupils to organize in - 
hungweipings and to play the part of 
the storm detachments in villifying, 
hounded, insulting, beating up, arrest-
ing and killing people and in arranging 
arson?all according to his wishes?to 
act as small fry, as bullies who shed 
their blood to stage the "rebellion" and 
the seizure of power he wanted. 
He has compelled millions of young' 
people and children to waste their valu-
able time, to drop their studies, to' 
undergo moral corruption and to lose 
.their health and life. He has committed 
a grave crime, crippling the growing 
generation of the Chinese people. He 
has wounded the soul of tens of millions 
of fathers and mothers anxious for the 
fate of their young sons and daughters. 
Those whom Mao Tse-tung and his 
group wanted abused and insulted were 
abused and insulted on their orders by 
the hungweipings at their assemblages. 
Those whom Mao Tse-tung and his group 
wanted purged or ousted from office 
were, on their orders, marked down by 
the hungweipings, who, at their rallies 
and demonstrations demanded that they 
be purged or ousted from office. Those 
whom they wanted beaten up, were, on 
their orders; beaten up by the hungwei-
pings. Those whom they wanted to ar-
rest, on their orders were arrested by 
the hungweipings. Those whom they 
wanted to kill, on their orders were 
kill-
ed by the hungweipings. The books they. 
wanted to burn and the historical monu-
ments they wanted to destroy, on their 
orders were burned and destroyed by 
the hungweipings. 
But all these actions, committed by 
them through their puppets, just as the 
"campaign to rectify style" and other 
false "mass movements", staged by Mao 
Tse-tung in the past, are demagogically 
pictured by them as a result of apply-
ng the "line of the masses", that is, "the 
me from the masses ? to the masses", c 
as some kind of "big democracy" of 
he masses, as a "real mass movement" 
9414t00651100600111124sscs." But all 
their demagogy cannot deceive anyone. 
When the hungweipings were sent to 
commit their infamies, Mao Tse-tung and 
his group repeatedly and openly declared 
that no one, no institution or organiza-
tion, including military institutions, had 
the right to interfere in the actions of 
the hungweipings or stop them, because 
the hungweipings were the "little initia-
tors" and "the vanguard" which was 
carrying out the "cultural revolution" 
under the personal guidance, the per-
sonal organization and personal leader-
ship and command of Mao Tse-tung. 
Similarly, the hungweipings, too, often 
shouted that Mao Tse-tung was their 
"supreme commander-in-chief," that 
they were the "guards commanded by 
Chiang Ching." 
' Replacing the Young Communist Lea-
gue and Young Pioneer Organization, 
by hungweipings and hunghsiaopings, 
Mao Tse-tung thereby wanted not only 
to abolish the assistants and reserve of 
the Communist Party, but also to abolish 
the most politically conscious, the most 
organized vanguard of the youth and 
children, the vanguard richest in revo-
lutionary traditions, in order to make 
the young people and children easily sus-
ceptible to his fraud and convert them 
into his personal reactionary tool for 
any crime. 
Today many hungwelping detach. 
meats have escaped this control and 
millions of young people have become 
aware of the criminal character of the 
"cultural revolution" and the reaction-
ary nature of Mao Tse-tung's "thought." 
The Mao Tse-tung group is brutally sup-
pressing them, sending millions of young 
men and women to remote areas and 
to the countryside in order that they 
should not be able to raise a rebellion 
against Mao Tse-tung and his group in 
the cities under the selfsame slogan "a 
rebellion is a just cause!" 
But this does not save the situation, 
because they can raise an anti-Mao 
"rebellion" not only...in the cities to-
gether with the masses of workers, but 
also in the villages, together with the 
peasant masses. There is no doubt what-
soever that China's younger generation 
cannot,tolerate for long the present situa-
tion. It will necessarily rise up more and 
more to struggle against the baneful 
regime of Mao Tse-tung and his group, 
for a bright future for themselves and 
their country.

lation. pn the pretext of "the strug 
against I counter-revolutionary eco 
mism," he is against improving the 1 
of factory and office workers, is arresti 
and killing all who advocate an i 
provement in the life of factory and 
lice workers. 
Ignoring the difficult living conditio 
of the workers, he pursues the so call 
"combination of industry, agricultu 
and military affairs," compelling t 
workers, in addition to their jobs, 
engage also in agriculture and under 
military drill. He has sent to each i 
dustrial, mining and transport ente 
prise military units for permanent b 
leting in order to institute military co 
trol over the workers and other c 
ployees and bring military, pressure t 
bear on them. Before their shift start 
workers and other employees are force 
to recite and sing "quotations" in fron 
of Mao Tse-tung's portrait. This is calle 
"asking Chairman Mao for directives; 
at the end of the shift, they also recit 
and sing "quotations"?"report to Chai 
man Mao about their work for the day. 
Military men make use of every free 
minute to compel the workers and other 
employees "to study Mao Tse-tung 
thought," depriving them of an possib 
lity of resting. 
By coercion and deception he force 
part of the workers and other employee 
to organize into so-called tsaofans, t 
attack the overwhelming majority of th 
workers and other employees at fac 
tories, mines and on transport as con 
servatives and reactionaries, to rebe 
against them and capture power. from 
them. This splits the unity of the work 
ing class and causes conflicts in their 
ranks. 
On many occasions Mao Tse-tung has 
falsely proclaimed that "in conditions 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat 
there are no grounds within the work-
ing class for necessarily splitting into 
two irreconcilably hostile camps." But 
the question is asked, who split theworking class into two irreconcilably 
hostile camps? Was it not Mao Tse-tung 
Mast; He, as before, adheres to the crro-
_ 
lass neous division of the middle peasants 
into three sections: higher, average and 
lower, constantly compelling and pro-
yoking the so-called poor and lower 
middle peasants to hound the so-called 
average and higher middle peasants; he 
is wrongly ousting the well-to-do middle 
peasants from the middle-peasant ranks 
and deititying them as The main tvpro? 
sentatives of capitalism in the country-
'side. All this is ruining the internal soli-
darity of the peasants, undermining their 
labor enthusiasm and impeding the de-
velopment of socialist agriculture. 
He, far from abolishing the system of 
the food tax, far from establishing single 
rational rates and purchase prices of 
farm produce, even decided to raise the 
food tax, increasing thereby the burden 
borne by the peasants. Moreover, he is 
also applying the notorious "combina-
tion of industry, agriculture and mili-
tary affairs" compelling the peasants, in 
addition to farming, to engage in indus-
trial production and undergo military 
drill. He sent military units for per-
en- manent billeting in the countryside in 
of order to institute military control and 
ut supervision over the work and life of 
ass the peasants. Members of peasant fami-
at. lies, men and women, aged and young, 
ri- are forced every day to waste much 
on time in memorizing "quotations" and 
ss "studying" Mao Tse-tung's thought, rob-
g's bing the peasants of rest after arduous 
le, work. 
SS On the pretext of fighting against. 
he "counter-revolutionary revisionism" he is 
to rejecting the system of workday units, 
st 'based on the principle of payment ac-
cording to work done, and also material 
p. incentives?rewards for increasing pro- . 
a- duction. Under the cover of the noto-

the 10. He does everything to protect the 
national bourgeoisie and co-operates 
an with domestic and external reaction. 
According to Mao Tse-tung's theory of 
the "new democratism," the bourgeoisie is 
eir a class which exercises dictatorship 
jointly with the workers, peasants and 
re- the petty bourgeoisie. In his explanation 
dal of the national flag of the CPR?red with 
nd five stars?he says that the bourgeoisie 
iii- is ao equal member of society just as 
al the working class, peasantry and the 
a petty bourgeoisie. Therefore he attach-
ch es particular significance and grants 
n, special privileges to the national bour-. 
si- geoisie in the spheres of policy, econo-
ct my and social status. 
ns In the economic sphere, immediately 
after the country's liberation Mao Tse-
al tung acceeded to the demands of the 
ei- national bourgeoisie and allowed them 
er to retain capital and profits, thus foster-
ing the development of capitalism. In 
d 1956, after the establishment of the 
0- joint state-private administration of in-
d dustry and trade he decided to pay an 
t- annual five percent guaranteed profit to 
d the capitalists for a period of 5-7 years. 
S In 1962, upon the expiration of this 
d term, Mao Tse-tung decided to prolong 
s, the payment of profits for another five 
years. This period has also expired and 
he has once again decided to continue 
paying out profits for another . . . 10 
' years. 
At the same time the administration 
of all state-private enterprises in effect 
remained in the hands of the capitalists. 
Occupying the posts of directors, mana-
? gers, engineers and so forth, capitalists 
receive salaries several times higher 
than those paid to other people hold-
ing the same jobs. Prior to the adoption 
of the Constitution, at the time when 
the so-called new democratic policy was 
being put through, representatives of the 
bourgeoisie made up a considerable part 
of the People's Political Consultative 
Conference. A considerable number of 
them also held the posts of heads and 
their deputies in the Central People's 
cursed byqPpeop for all tunes.

intellectuals in China and they are m

despots in China's history. 
9. He conducts a barbarous great-H 
chauvinistic policy with regard to 
national minorities and annihilates th 
revolutionary leaders and cadres.. 
Following the traditions of the 
?actionary regimes of Chinese feu

Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Tse-tung uses m 
tary-police forces to decimate nation 
minorities; he steadfastly enforces 
policy of great-Han chauvinism whi 
finds its expression in discriminatio 
disparagement, repressions, forcible as 
milation or resettlement and disrespe 
for the faiths, customs and traditio 
of the national minorities. 
At the outset of the so-called cultur

These crimes of Mao Tse-tung are 
alien to Marxist-Leninist national policy 
and a betrayal of proletarian interna-
tionalism. They evoked not only vigorous 
resistance and armed struggle of the 
national minorities, but also opposition 
to his reactionary policy and compas-
sion for the national minorities on the 
part of those local Party and administra-

ism and after the Constitution was 
adopted. Statistics show that out of 
approximately 1,260 deputies of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), the 
country's highest organ of power, 260 
were representatives of the bourgeoisie. 
It is common knowledge that deputies of 
the NPC are not elected by a direct 
vote. Nominally they are elected at pro-
vincial meetings of people's representa-
tives. In fact, however, they are all 
selected by Mao Tse-tung. As a result of 
this selection the national bourgeoisie 
which numbers less than a hundredth 
part of the country's population held 
over a fifth of the seats in the NPC, 
while the workers, peasants and the 
petty bourgeoisie comprising over 90 
perecent of the population had less than 
four-fifths of the seats. 
There is a fairly large number of the 
bourgeoisie occupying posts of deputy. 
chairman and members of the Standing 
Committee of the NPC. In the State 
Council and its ministries and state com-
mittees many of the heads and deputies 
are from the bourgeoisie. Moreover, they 
hold an even larger number of important 
posts in the People's Congresses anci 
People's Councils in all towns. For ex. 
ample, Jung Yi-jen, a big capitalist, who 
annually gets over 3,000,000 yuan in pro-
fits, is a deputy of the NPC and member 
of its Standing Committee; he is deputy 
of the Shanghai Municipal People's Con-
gress and deputy-mayor of Shanghai. . 
In the course of the so-called cultural 
re olution workers? peasants and the 
intellectuals had been and are being 
subjected to brutal repressions on the 
part of the hungweipings, tsaofans, the 
army and the police, and only the na-
tional bourgeoisie continues to live as 
before, and as before receives profits 
and ,exploits the people. Foreign corres-
pondents after visiting China and seeing 
the lite of the Chinese bourgeoisie, !un-
animously agree that in the China which 
is living through the so-called "cultural 
revolution" the bourgeoisie is the sole 
flourishing and contented class. It is not 
surprising, therefore, that the bourgeoi-

greetings to Mao Tse-tung calling him 
"beloved father and teacher" and thank-
ing him for his profound solicitude and 
all-round care. 
As regards the facts of Mao Tse-tung's 
connivance with internal and external 
reaction there are more than enough of 
them. We shall only mention some of 
the more striking ones. 
Mao Tse-tung had an exceptionally 
high opinion of LI Chi.shen. After the 
formation of the CPR Li Chi-shen was 
appointed Deputy Chairman. of the 
Standing Committee of the NPC. What 
sort of a man was Li Chi-shen? He 
was a notorious hangman. After Chiang 
Kai-shek had betrayed the revolution 
of April 14 (1927) in Shanghai, Li Chi-
shen on' April 15, 1927 betrayed the 
revolution in Canton and in the course 
of three days executed more than 5,000 
Communists, revolutionary workers and 
students. Therefore, at a solemn recep-
tion on the occasion of the formation 
of the CPR a veteran Party member 
upon seeing Li Chi-shen and others of 
his ilk, hit the table with his hand and 
exclaimed: "This is an outrage! Old 
revolutionaries are valued less than 
non-revolutionaries, and non-revolution-
aries are valued less than counter-revo-
lutionaries." 
Mao Tse-tung is on friendly terms with 
Li Tsung-jen, he made Li Tsung-jen his 
honoured guest and the guest of all the 
country. What sort of man is Li Tsung-
jen? He is also a notorious hangman who 
together with Wang Ching-wei betrayed 
the revolution of July 15, 1927 in Wuhan. 
Within a few days they executed tens 
of thousands of Communists and other 
revolutionary workers and students. He 
is war criminal No. 2 who had replaced 
Chiang Kai-shek as president in order to 
bring the anti-communist, anti-popular, 
counter-revolutionary civil war to a con-
elusion. 
A loyal flunkey of U.S. imperialism he 
fled to the United States after the de-
feat of the Kuomingtang in the civil war 
and stayed there for 15 years. Upon Li 
Tsung-jen's return to China in 1965, 
Mao Tse-tung organised official welcomes 
and receptions in his honour in Peking 
.and other cities at which Li Tsung-jcn 
widely propagandised the slogan "td 
fight against imperialism it is necessary 
to fight against revisionism" which he 
had brought from the United States. In 
fact, Mao Tse-tung made him his adviser 
for anti-Soviet, anti-communist and anti- I 
popular affairs.

Tung-sung? Chang Tung-sung taught the 
notorious history of Western philosophy 
His book "History of Western Philo-
sophy" praises to the skies the reaction-
ary-idealistic philosophers of the west. 
Marx's name is mentioned on the very 
last page. "As regards the philosophy of 
K. Marx," it is stated in the book, "it 
simply merits no discussion. For only 
the insane can balleVa In his phil000phy." 
At a joint meeting of 'the leaders 
the central ministries and committees 
held a few days prior to the official 
proclamation of the CPR, someone, sud-
denly informed Mao Tse-tung: "Chang 
Tung-sung has arrived!" A joyous smile 
spread across Mao Tse-tung's face and 
he said for all to hear: "That's great! 
That's great! Chang Tung-sung has also 
arrived! He is a veteran of the Peiyang 
and Yanchiu groups and on top of that 
he is a prominent professor. Since he 
has come to us he at least should be 
given the post of member of the Cen-
tral People's Government Council." I 
told him there and then: "Chairman 
Mao! This man still needs to be looked 
into. The veterans of the Pciyan and 
Yanchiu groups had not only always 
opposed the Communist Party but even 
the Knomingtang at the time when it 
was still participating in the revolution." 
Several days later the name of Chang 
Tung-sung was on the list of members 
of the Central People's Government 
Council. A short while later public se-
curity organs discovered that he and 
his son were American spies and had a 
secret radio station in their home 
specially for maintaining contact with 
the U.S. secret service. 
On November 25, 1965 Jenmingjihpao 
published an account of how Mao-Tse-
tung and his wife congratulated the 
writer Anna Louise Strong, propagan-
dizer of Mao Tse-tung's thought in 
the U.S,A. on her birthday and publish-
ed a group photograph. The newspaper 
mentioned that all the Americans on the 
photograph were friends of Mao Tse-
tung and Chiang Ching. The past of 
some of these people is still unclear. 
Among them were L. Early and Ep-
stein who, as is well known, were advis-
ers and friends of Chiang Kai-shek and 
his wife Sung Mei-ling and have now 
become the advisers and friends of Mao 
Tse-tung and Chiang Ching, 
Mao ITse-tung is striking a secret dip-
omatic deal with the U.S. imperialists. 
The Chinese and American ambassadors 
have already had 134 meetings in War-
aw. Both sides have made the subject 
of their talks a complete secret from the 
Chinese and American peoples and from 
. the world public. A U.S. State Depart 
ment representative frankly admitted 
that Washington and Peking have been

secret diplomatic deal between China 
and the United States has already at-
tained considerable scope and level. 
Such are the 10 principal crimes com-
mitted by Mao Tse-tung withih the 
country.- These crimes are proved by 
incontrovertible facts. These crimes 
cannot be refuted by any verbal aril-
flees of Mao Tse-tung and his group. 
These 10 crimes demonstrate with 
especial clarity and precision that Mao 
Tse-tung is engaged not in some kind of 
a "cultural revolution." but in an armed 
counter-revolution, an anti-communist 
counter-revolutionary military coup dir-
ected against the people. Even at the 
time when the vaunted "cultural revolu-
tion" was only getting under way, 
Marxists-Leninists of all countries point-
ed out that the so-called "great prole-
tarian cultural revolution," launched and 
led by Mao Tse-tung personally, far from 
having anything to do with either the 
proletariat or culture, or the revolution, 
was indeed spearheaded against the pro-
letariat, against culture, against revolu-
tion; far from having anything in com-
mon with Marxism-Leninism; it was 
spearheaded against Marxism-Leninism; 
far from resembling in any way the 
policy of a Communist Party and a 
socialist state, it was spearheaded 
against the Communist Party and social-
ism. The entire course of subsequent 
events has increasinglydemonstrated 
the absolute correctness of such an' 
appraisal. 
Comrade L. I. Brezhnev, General Sec-
retary of the Central Committee of the 
CPSU, in his speech at a meeting with 
electors on March 11, 1967, already con-
cretely pointed out: "The legend about 
the 'proletarian cultural revolution' is 
merely clumsy camouflage of a policy 
alien to Marxism-Leninism." "This looks 
more like a reactionary coup." In his 
speech on September 8 of the same year 
at a brotherhood meeting in Budapest he 
once again noted: "What has been named 
the 'cultural revolution' by the Mao

ise-tung grotP woultcr e more correct 
to call counter-revolution." Subsequent 
events in China have fully corroborated 
the exceptional correctness of this 
Marxist-Leninist evaluation. 
These 10 crimes also demonstrate 
very clearly that the aim of the so-called 
"cultural revolution" effected by Mao 
Tse-tung and his group is not "to safe-
guard the dictatorship of the proletar-
iat," but, on the contrary, to abolish 
people's rule in China; not "to safeguard 
the socialist system," but, on the' con-
trary, to undermine the foundation for 
building socialism in China. These 10 
crimes show with exceptional clarity and 
precision that the object against which 
the "cultural revolution" is spearheaded 
is not "a handful of Party persons in 
authority taking the capitalist road" and 
not "carriers of the bourgeois reaction-
ary line," not "counter-revolutionary 
revisionists" and not "traitors," but, on 
the contrary, it is the Marxist-Leninist 
Chinese Communist Party which unites 
in its ranks about 25 million members; 
it is the Young Communist League of 
China which unites in its ranks about 
30 million members; it is the All-
China Federation of Trade Unions which 
unites in its ranks over 20 million mem-
bers; it is the millions of leaders, 
cadres and activists of Party, adminis-
trative, military and various other insti-
tutions and organisations, including 
schools, higher educational establish-
ments, industrial, agricultural and tran-
sport enterprises; it is the majority 
of the workers, peasants and intelligent-
sia of the entire country. According to 
incomplete data, the number of people 
persecuted, arrested and physically an-
nihilated by Mao Tse-tung and his 
group in the course of the "cultural 
revolution" exceeded five million long 
ago. 
And, lastly, these 10 crimes prove 
with exceptional clarity and precision 
that indeed the so-called "handful of 
persons in authority taking the capital-
ist road" and "carriers of the bourgeois 
reactionary line" are no one else but 
Mao Tse-tung himself and his group! 
The facts show, and all recognise, that 
the anti-communist and anti-popular 
Mao Tse-tung group consists only of a . 
few people. And among them the per. 
son closest and most trusted by Mao 
Tse-tung is his wife Chiang Ching. That 
'is why Mao Tse-tung is forced himself 
openly to praise her as the only person 
who really understands well, propagates 
and applies Mao Tse-tung's thought in 
'general and his thought in the sphere 
CPYRGF,1T 
cutAnnnsnnnAnnni _s . 
of literature and art in' particular:That 
is why he has appointed her formally 
the deputy, and actually, the chief of the 
so-called "group for cultural revolution 
affairs and commander-in-chief of 
hungweipings. That is why he artificially 
put her in the third place, so far after 
Lin Piao, in the Mao heirarchy. And that 
is why public opinion in China and for-
eign observers unanimously agree that 
Chiang Ching remains the only person 
Mao Tse-tung could really trust in 
everything.

That Mao,Tse-tung and 
tacked on to Liu Shao-c 
ping and others the label 
ed, such as "a handful of Party persons 
in authority taking the capitalist road" 
and "carriers of the bourgeois reaction-
ary line," is a political trick with con-
cealed aims. 
? 
These aims are, first, to blame Liu and 
Teng for the- various mistakes and 
crimes committed by Mao Tse-tung over 
a number of years in home and foreign 
policy and thereby make Liu and Teng 
the scapegoats. 
Second, Liu and Teng were for many s 
years colleagues of Mao Tse-tung and 
know of the many crimes and unseemly 
secrets of Mo Tse-tung in internal and f 
international 'affairs; that is why Mao is r 
trying to liquidate Liu and Teng as s 
living witnesses. 
Third, another still more, important 
aim is to tack on to Liu Shao-chi, Teng 
Hsia-ping and Tao Chu labels of "Party 
persons in authority taking the capital-
ist 
and on this pretext to liqui-
date Liu, Teng and Tao themselves and 
then arbitrarily tack on a label of "sup-
porters of Liu, Teng and Tao" to all per-
sons whom Mao Tse-tung and his group 
intend to persecute. 
The real objective of their call?nec-
essarily to link together "big criticism" 
of the "top Party person in authority 
taking the capitalist road" with the cam-
paign of "struggle, criticism and trans-
formation" in all the country's institu-
tions and organisations, is to utilise the 
slogan 'of "struggle against the handful 
of Party persons in authority taking the 
capitalist road" as a screen and pretext 
for persecuting and destroying Party 
cadres in all institutions and organisa-
tions throughout the country. 
By decision of the unlawful so-called 
"12th Plenary Meeting of the Central 
Committee of the CPC," Liu Shao-chi 
was removed from all the Party and state 
posts he held and "expelled from the 
Party for ever" on the basis of absolu-
tely false accusations entirely fabricated 
by Mao Tse-tung himself. Mao Tse-tung 
followed this up by another, wider, still 
more slanderous campaign in the press? 
radio and at meetings and rallies all 
over the country under the slogan of 
"launching a struggle of unusual scale 
and depth against the top traitor, top 
scab and top spy of the Kuomingtang, 
imperialism and Soviet revisionism, Liu 
Shao-chi, and his supporters in all the 
localities." This once again most clearly 
reveals "the tiger's aspect and snake's 
soul" of Mao Tse-tung as an unprece-
dentedly bestial and absolutely brazen 
plotter. 
Communists and other upright people 
throughout the world are raising their 
wrathful and just voice. in protest 
against such foul persecution by Mao 
Tse-tung of the Vice-Chairman of the 
Central Committee of the CPC and Chair-
man of the Chinese Pt20, .-'S Republic 
Comrade Liu Shao-chi, 
Mao Tse-tung acted in a similar way 
during the so-called "campaign to rectify 
style," started in February 1942. Making 
use of the military power he usurped in 
he Party and the difficult international 
ituation during the early period of.the 
Hitlerite attack on the Soviet Union, 
Mao Tse-tung began this campaign which 
ormally was called the "campaign to 
ectify three styles" (that is, the Party 
tyle, style of education and literary 
? 
Approved For Release 1999/09/02 :LIA-RDP79-01194A000500060001-5 
CPYRGHT 
Approvcd For Rcicasc 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000600060001-6 
style); actually it was a campaign of 
"four antis" (that is, anti-Leninist anti-
Comintern, anti-Soviet and anti-Party). 
For what purpose did Mao Tse-tung 
need that campaign? In preparing it and 
in the course of conducting it, Mao ?Tse-
lung himself repeatedly said that by car-
rying out the campaign he wanted to 
achieve three aims: 1) to replace Lenin-
ism by Maoism; 2) to write the history 
of the Chinese Communist Party as the 
history of Mao Tse-tung alone; 3) to 
elevate the personality of Mao Tse-tung 
above the Central Committee and the 
entire Party. Why did he have to do it? 
He himself replied: this would give him 
two opportunities: first, to capture the 
chief leading place in the Party leader-
ship and all power in the Party in his 
own hands; second, if he already has 
taken the first place in the Party leader-
ship, .no one should ever be able to 
? oust him. 
To achieve these ends he did the fol-
lowing in this campaign: 1) he declared 
Leninism to be Russian Marxism suit-
able only for leading the Russian revo-
lution and unsuitable for leading the 
world and the Chinese revolution; 2) de-
clared that the leadership and assistance, 
of the Communist International to the 
CPC was entirely wrong; 3) declared 
that the all-round support given by the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
(Bolsheviks) and the Soviet Union to 
the Communist Party of China and to 
the Chinese Revolution was not only 
"invalid" and "ineffective" but even 
."harmful"; 4) accused the entire Party 
of "non-recognition of Maoism" and of 
"loyalty to Leninism and the Commun-
ist International" and of "adherence to 
the CPSU(B) and the Soviet Union?' 
And who was to blame for all this? 
Mao Tse-tung held that the blame lay 
with all the leaders and important 
cadres of the Party who had studied in 
the Soviet Union and spread the influ-
ence of Leninism, the Comintern, the 
CPSU(B) and the Soviet Union in China. 
Their main representatives were Wang 
Ming, Ching Po-ku, Chang Wei-tien, 
Wang Chia-hsiang, Kai Fang, Yang 
Shang-kun, Chu Jul and others. And who 
was to blame for supporting these 
Comintern men? Mao Tse-tung held that 
these were Chu-Teh, Chou En-lai, Hsien 
Ying, Teng Fa, Peng Teh-huai, Ho Lung 
and others. 
And who was the "top man" to blame? 
Mao Tse-tung held that this was Wang 
Ming. According to his statement, Wang 
Ming was the "main representative of 
_Russian Marxism and the line of the, 
pp  
Comintern in the Communist Party of 
China." Wang Ming was the "principal 
adherent and defender of the CPSU(B) 
,and the Soviet Union in China." Wang 
Ming was the "principal foe of Maoism 
in the CPC." But how was the struggle 
against Wang Ming to be waged and 
finked with the struggle against the 
absolute majority of the leaders, Party 
cadres and members? 
For this Mao Tse.tung artificially div. 
ided the entire Party into two groupings 
?the "dogmatic" and "empiristic" and 
at the same time united them as one 
target of his attack. He placed all the 
Communists who, had studied in the 
Soviet Union or engaged in ideological 
and political work and also those who 
? socially originated from the intelligent-
sia into the so-called "pro-Soviet and 
dogmatic Wang Ming grouping. All the 
Communists who engaged in practical 
work orrwho were of ?working-class and 
peasant social origin he placed into the 
so-called "empiristic grouping." At the 
same time he declared that the empiris-
tic grouping was a "captive and assist-
ant" of the dogmatic grouping. 
Moreover, Mao Tse-tung held that in 
order to write the history of the CPC 
as the history, of Mao Tse-tung alone it 
was necessary not only not to recognise 
the, services bf Leninism, the Comintern, 
the CPSU(B) and the Soviet Union in 
the history of the CPC and the Chinese 
Revolution. It was necessary to deny 
that any leader, any Party functionary 
or member had rendered any service to 
the CPC and the Chinese revolution. Ac-
cording to Mao Tse-tung's statement, it 
was particularly necessary: 
1) to deny the services rendered by 
Chu Chiu-po in the struggle against 
Right opportunist Chentuhsuism and 
also the services of the extraordinary 
August Conference of the CPC (1927) 
which approved in its decisions this 
struggle and the services of the Comin-
tern leadership which Was the direct 
sponsor of this conference and to pro-
claim the line of the August CPC Con-
ference to be a "Chuchiupoist Left 
Opportunist line"; 
2) to deny the services rendered by 
Wang Ming in the struggle against the 
Left adventurist line of Li Li-san and 
also the services of the 4th Plenary 
Meeting of the Central Committee of 
the CPC, sixth convocation (January 
1931), and the Presidium of the Execu-
tive Committee of the Comintern (May 
1931) which approved this struggle in 
their decisions and to declare the line 
of the 4th Plenary Meeting of the CPC 
Central Committee a "Left opportunist 
line of Wang Ming"; 
' 3) to deny the services rendered by 
Wang Ming in putting forward the pol-
Icy of the anti-Japanese national united 
front and the services of the 7th Com-
intern Congress which approved this 
policy in its decisions and to declare 
this policy of the anti-Japanese nationai 
united front, a "Right-wing capitulatory 
line of Wang Ming." 
According to Mao Tse,tung's state, 
ment, if the services of other persons is 
the history of the CPC and the Chinese 
revolution were recognised then "there 
would be no Maoism," "the history of 
the CPC as the history of Mao Tse-tung 
alone would be impossible" and there 
would be no "especially high and un-
shakeable place of Mao Tse-tung in the 
CPC." In keeping with his conspirator-
ial plan, Mao Tse-tung first of all struck 
the main blow at Wang Ming?not only 
ideologically, politically, organisationally 
and morally, but also physically (at the 
beginning of this campaign Wang Ming 
had already been gravely poisoned by 
toxic preparations). 
Mao Tse-tung also struck blows of dif? 
1"4-tent severity at the absolute majority 
of the leaders, cadres and Party mem-
bers. Employing diverse methods of 
deception, slander, threats and coercior 
compelled all of them to admit thal 
Nary were either dogmatists or em'pir. 
icists, that is, "captives and assistants 
of the dogmatists" and that, of course, 
all without exception carried out the 
above mentioned so-called "Left" or 
"Right" line of Wang Ming. Moreover, 
by similar methods and cruel torture 
he compelled a considerable part of the 
Communists and YCL ,members to Con-
fess that they were "traitors," "counter-
revolutionaries" and "spies of the Kuo-
mintang, the imperialists and the Soviet 
Union." Many of those who did confess 
to being such criminals were arrested 
or killed or committed suicide. This con-
tinued for more than three years. 
As a result of this campaign, the 7th 
Plenary Meeting of the CPC Central 
Committee, 6th convocation (April 1945), 
under the pressure of Mao Tse-tung 
adopted a "Resolution on Some Histor-
ical Questions of the CPC." This was 
the first official document falsifying the 
history of the CPC in accordance with 
Mao Tse-tung's concepts. Following this 
the Rules, adopted by the 7th Congress 
of the CPC (April-May, 1945), forcibly 
Included recognition of Mao Tsetung's 
thought as the only guiding ideas of the 
CPC. Moreover, Mao Tse-tung succeeded 
in capturing the top leading post (at

After the 7th Congress and until the 
so-called cultural revolution, for more 
than 20 years, Mao Tse-tung constantly 
conducted campaigns under, different 
names. But their chief content, chief 
aims, chief methods and chief objects of 
attack in the main were the same as in 
the first "campaign to rectify style" of 
1942-45. 
The fist "campaign to rectify style" 
was a rehearsal of the so-called cultural 
revolution. The various campaigns which 
followed it, were to one or another 
extent direct preparatory measure& for 
the "cultural revolution." During this 
time in view of the many fundamental 
mistakes and repeated failures and de-
feats of Mao Tse-tung's home and for-
eign policy and especially in view of the 
obviously reactionary and counter-
revolutionary nature of these campaigns 
and the "cultural revolution," even men 
who were closest and most loyal to 
Mao Tse-tung as, for example, Liu Shao-
chi, Hu Chiao-mu, Tan Chen, Tao Chu, 
Lo Yui-ching, Ho Chang-kung, Peng 
Chen, Lu Ting-i, Chou Yang and othcrs, 
one after another became his enemies 
and victims. These facts graphically 
show that Mao Tse-tung, notwithstand-
ing his frenzied terror and perfidy, is 
today even more isolated and is in a 
really unprecedented desperate position. 
Similarly Mao Tse-tung has slyly 
branded Peng Teh-huai, Ho Lung, Lo Jui-
ching and others as "army persons in 
authority taking the capitalist road," 
not only to utilise this as the pretext, 
for persecuting them but also in order 
to be able arbitrarily to brand as "sup-
porters of Peng, Ho and Lo" any military 
leaders and army cadres whom he 
intended to persecute. 
Similarly, as early as 1962 Mao Tse-
tung ordered Chi Pen-yu to write an 
article slandering as "traitor" the na-
tional hero of the T'ai P'in revolution 
Li Hsiu-cheng who heroically perished 
at the hand of the national traitor Tseng 
Kuo-fan; thereby Mao Tse-tung initiated 
the so-called "campaign of struggle 
against traitors." Following this, Chu  
Chiu-po, well-known . ldader of the 
Chinese Communist Party who heroic- t 
ally perished singing the "Internation- a 
ale" at the hand of butcher Chiang s 
Kai-shek, was classed among the pa 
"traitors." Next a list of "traitors" was b

FIVE MAJOR CRIMES COMMITTED 
BY MAO TSE-TUNG 
IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Foreign policy is a continuation of 
domestic policy. Let us now see what 
'crimes Mao Tsa?tung has committed in 
the sphere of international policy. 
L He frenziedly attacks the Soviet 
Union and other socialist countries. 
He organised a siege of the embassies 
and other diplomatic offices of the 
U.S1.S.R., Bulgaria, Hungary, the German 
Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia 
and Mongolia in China, insulted the 
leaders of these countries and caused 
the manhandling and baiting of diplo-
mats and members of their families. 
Like the Peiyan warlords and Chiang 
Kai-shek he in effect does not recognise 
the Mongolian People's Republic as an 
independent state, openly threatens its 
sovereignty and lays claim to its terri-
tory. He persists in his frenzied opposi-
tion to joint action with the Soviet 
Union and other socialist countries in 
the rendering of assistance to the Viet-
namese people in order to repulse United 
States aggression, and seeks to under-
mine the Vietnamese people's bonds of 
friendship with the Soviet Union and 
other socialist countries, thereby encour-
aging U.S. imperialism to keep escalat-
ing the war of aggression in Vietnam. 
He spreads slanderous rumors, insulting 
and undermining the prestige of the 
Korean People's Democratic Republic;e 
t hereby encouraging provocations 
against the KPDR by aggressive United 
States troops and the South Korean 
puppets. Besides bringing 'trade and 
economic pressure to bear on Cuba after 
the manner of the U.S. imperialists, he 
-engages in subversive activities against 
the Communist Party and revolutionary 
3overnment of Cuba. He openly pro-. 
elaims his intention of "demolishing" 
the U.S.S.R. and other socialist coun-
cries, constantly fans anti-Soviet hysteria 
China and fosters hostility for the 
soviet Union. 
Mao Tse-tung savagely attacks the 
CPSU and the Soviet Union because the 
reat Communist Party of the Soviet 
nion, founded and reared by Lenin, 
as the longest history, the most exten-
ive experience; the most imposing 
chievements and the greatest prestige, 
because the great Land , of Soviets, 
? created by Lenin and embodying Marx-
ism-Leninism, is the world's first social-
1st country with the longest history, the 
most impressive achievements and the 
greatest might, because led by the 
CPSU thee Soviet Union is indeed the 
mightiest and most reliable mainstay 
of the world 'revolution and of world 
peace, that it is indeed the most edur-
ing and consistent revolutionary bastion. 
of the struggle ? against imperialist 
cli eues and reactionaries of all the 
capitalist countries headed by the U.S.A. 
Mao Tse-tung has turned frenzied 
an I-Sovietism into his banner of strug-
gle against Marxism-Leninism, against 
the Communist and Workers' Parties, 
ag inst socialism and communism, 
against the world revolution and peace 
in order to gain the approval and un-
derstanding of the imperialist clique 
heeded by the U.S.A. and obtain .the 
po sibility of collaborating with it. 
nother reason for the violence of his 
att icks on the Soviet Union and the 
CP43U is that the Great October Revolu-
tion has witnessed its 50th anniversary. 
Th Great October Socialist Revolution' 
am. its brilliant achievements in the 
budding of socialism and communism ' 
over the past 50 years have opened the 
vis a of a bright future for all mankind. 
This is the greatest force inspiring the 
wo -king class and all other working 
pee pie throughout the world. It is the 
greatest force inspiring the CPC and the 
Chinese people, who are at present 
afil cted by a great tragedy. 
Through furious anti-Soviet campaigns 
Ma) Tse-tung seeks to rupture the long-
est blished, traditional friendship and? 
fra ernal relations between the Corn.. 
mu list Parties and peoples of China and 
the Soviet Union. He is beset by a har-
ros ing fear that the Chinese Commun-
ists and the Chinese people will learn 
of lhe immense achievements, which the 
So s iet people, led by the CPSU, have 
attained in the course of the fulfilment 
of the new Party Program and the de-
cisbns of the 23rd CPSU Congress, in 
the building of communism, in the 
struggle, for world peace and in render-
ing support to the communist and 
wor king-class movement in different-
coustries and to the national liberation 
and social-progressive movement in , 
Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
Ha is exceedingly afraid that the 
Chinese Communists and the Chinese. 
peo7le will learn that the material and 
cult rral life of the Soviet people is 
stea lily improving, that they are gradu-
llly moving from the principle of "from 
eacl according to his ability, to each' 
leeexding to his work" to the principle

'of "from each according to his ability, 
to each according to his needs," in other 
words, that they are moving towards a 
prosperous and happy life under com-
munism. 
Mao Tse-tung is extremely afraid that 
if the Chinese Communists and the 
Chinese people learn the truth in all 
these (Aiestions they will see Weimar 
the gross absurdity and perniciousness 
of the 'so-called "thought of Mao Tse-
tung" apd of his policies. They will then 
inevitably and unanimously demand 
that China take the correct Marxist-
Leninist road of socialist construction 
and of the struggle for peace, which has 
been followed by the Soviet Union. 
After appreciating all this they will rise 
with greater determination, on a larger 
scale, in a more organised manner and 
in greater unity against Mao Tse-tung 
and his "thought," against the counter-
revolutionary coup of Mao Tse-tung and 
his group. That is precisely why anti-
Sovietism has become the focal point of 
Mao Tse-tung's foreign policy and the 
core of his policy at home. 
The armed provocative attack of the 
Mao Tse-tung clique on Soviet frontier 
guards of March 2 on Soviet territory 
on the Damarisky Island in the Ussuri 
river and in this connection the new 
anti-Soviet racket in China and abroad 
'accompanied by outrageous territorial 
claims to the U.S.S.R. are not accidental 
events. Internally, they .represent an at-
tempt by Mao Tse-tung to distract the 
attention of the Chinese people from the 
incredible and growing difficulties of a 
political and economic character aris-
ing out of the consequence of the so-
called "cultural revolution," as well as 
the preparation for the carrying through 
of the so-called "Congress of the CPC" 
in an atmosphere of exceptional anti-
Soviet, anti-communist hysteria. 
Externally, this armed provocation 
and anti-Soviet propaganda ballyhoo re-
presents an act of assistance to the anti-
Soviet, anti-Communist sorties of the 
ruling circles of the ,U.S.A. and of the 
German Federal Republic, in particular 
in regards to the Bonn venture to carry 
through presidential elections in West 
Berlin of March 5 and even more so 
serves as an encouragement to the re-
vanchist claims of Bonn to reshape the 
map of Europe. It also represents an 
attempt to interfere with the Interna-
tional Conference of Communist and 
workers parties which aims to achieve 
the strengthening of the unity of the 
world communist and workers' move-
ment and the unity of action of all anti-
imperialist forces.

Simultaneously these facts clearly 
show the absurd, shameful, adventurst 
and dangerous point , reached by the 
anti-Sovietism and anti-Communism of 
Mao Tse-tung. 
2. He venomously attacks the Marxist-
Leninist Communist and Workers' par-
ties of all countries. 
Ha goes to extremes to intensify his 
splitting and subversive activities 
against the overwhelming majority of , 
the militant contingents of Communists 
in different countries, organises a fifth 
column to combat Communist and 
Workers' parties, openly slanders them, 
calling them "counter-revolutionary re-
visionist" parties, and publicly proclaims 
his intention of "destroying" them. He 
has slandered the Karlovy Vary Confer-
ence which was attended by representa-
tives of 24 Communist and Workers' 
parties, calling it a "conference of scabs 
and traitors," and he has called the 
leaders of each of these parties "a hand-
ful of traitors and scabs." The Budapest 
Consultative Meeting, attended by rep-
resentatives of 66 Communist and 
Workers' parties, has been named by 
him "the Budapest farce," while the 
parties which attended it have been 
called a "handful of traitors and scabs." 
In Western Europe he concentrates 
his attacks mainly on the largest and 
most influential Communist parties. He 
not only maliciously attacks Comrade 
Waldeck Rochet and other leaders of the 
French Communist Party but also slan-
ders the late Maurice Thorez, the great 
fighter for communism. He not only 
maliciously attacks Comrade Luigi Longo 
and other leaders of the Italian Com-
munist Party but also slanders the late 
Palmiro Togliatti, who was another 
great fighter for communism. 
At the same time he fiendishly attacks 
the heroic Communist Party of Spain 
and its glorious leader Comrade Dolores 
Ibarruri, a party which is in the fore-
front of the struggle against fascism. 
He intensifies subversion and splitting 
activities against the Communist parties 
of the U.S.A., Canada and Latin America 
as well as against the Communist par-
ties of the Arab countries. He makes a 
special effort to split and undermine the. 
communist movement in Asian coun-
tries neighbouring on China. The Com-
munist Party of Indonesia which came 
under the influence of Mao Tse-tung's 
"Leftist" and reactionary ideas, suffered 
a tragic defeat as a result of which mil-
lions of Communists and non-Party i 
workers, peasants and intellectuals suf-
fered horribly. Mao Tse-tung drew no 
lesson whatever from this.. Instead, he 
imputed the blame to the leaders of the 
Communist Party of Indonesia, who 
died heroically. 
He ceaselessly engages in splitting 
and subversive activities against the 
Communist parties of India and Ceylon, 
causing enormous difficulties in their 
work, In this easie of the Communist 
'Party of Japan, which, urged Mao Tse-
tung to create a united front of struggle 
against U.S. imperialism and came out 
against the Maoist anti-Soviet "united 
front," he did not confine himself to 
open slander and splitting and subver-
sive activities. He organised Chinese 
residents in Japan into hungweiping 
gangs in order to manhandle Japanese 
Communists and attack and destroy the? 
building housing the Society for Japan-
ese-Chinese Friendship; he bribes hooli-
gans and Trotskyite elements to attack 
offices of the Japanese Communist Par-
ty. In Peking, acting on his instructions, 
hungweipings beat up and seriously in-
jured alternate member of the Presi-
dium of the CC CPJ Itiro Sunama, cor-
respondents of the CPJ newspaper, as 
well as Japanese students. Moreover, he 
openly proclaims his intention to "de-
molish" the CPJ and calls for the liqui-
dation of top leaders of the CPJ, com-
rades Sandzo Nosaka and Kenclzi 
Miyamoto. 
Thus, Mao Tse-tung mouths "Leftist" 
verbiage about a "world revolution" but 
in fact engages in splitting and subver-
sive activities with the object of "de-. 
molishing" the foremost contingents 
heading the revolutionary movement in 
different countries; he speaks of a 
"struggle against the imperialist clique 
and reactionaries of all countries head-
ed by the' U.S.A." but does exactly what 
'the U.S. imperialists and all reaction-
aries want but cannot do. 
A striking example in this respect is 
his attitude towards the Alevelopments 
in Czechoslovakia. He and his group 
level dirty slander and fabrications at 
the Soviet Union and other socialist 
countries as well as against the healthy 
forces in the Communist Party of Czech-
oslovakia and among the Czechoslovak 
people, thereby directly and openly 
pouring grist on the mill of U.S. and 
West German imperialism and of the 
counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist 
forces within Czechoslovakia. 
3. He plans ,to split and undermine 
the national liberation movement in 
Asia, Africa and Latin America, pursu-
ng a policy of openly pressuring the 
developing countries of Asia and Africa.

He does his utmost to split and under-
mine the Afro-Asian unity movement 
and the movement for solidarity of the 
peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin Amer-
ica in the joint struggle against imper-
ialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism. 
_He is, in fact, helping to put into effect 
the imperialist design of crushing the 
countries of Asia, Africa and Latin 
America one by one. He Makes eVery 
&OA to underniine the friendship and 
unity of the national liberation and 
social-progressive movements of Asia, 
Africa and Latin America with the 
Soviet Union and other socialist coun-
tries as well as with the international 
'communist movement, thereby seeking 
to isolate the national liberation and 
social-progressive movements in Asia, 
%Africa and Latin America and deprive 
them of the all-round assistance of the 
socialist countries and the international 
communist movement. Mao Tse-tung 
keeps talking about support and assist-
ance for the national liberation move-
ment in Asia, Africa and Latin America, 
but no sooner does U.S. imperialism 
undertake aggression against any Asian, 
African or Latin American country than 
he, in effect, sides with U.S. imperialism. 
When Vietnam was made the target 
of armed aggression by U.S. imperial-
ism, instead of taking joint action with 
the Soviet Union and other socialist 
countries to help the Vietnamese people 
repulse this aggressor, Mao Tse-tung 
directed his efforts towards slander and 
provoking a rupture of the Vietnamese 
people's friendly relations with the 
Soviet Union and other socialist coun-
tries in order to isolate the Vietnamese. 
Similarly, in 1962 when Cuba was , con-
fronted with armed aggression by U.S. 
imperialism, instead of taking joint 
steps with the Soviet Union and other 
socialist countries to defend the Cuban 
revolution, Mao Tse-tung concentrated 
on slander and on provoking a severance 
of the Cuban people's friendly relations 
with the Soviet Union and other social-
ist countries in an effort to force Cuba 
into isolation and thereby help U.S. 
imperialism to smash her. 
When the Arab states were subjected 
to U.S. imperialist stage-managed Is-
raeli aggression, instead of taking joint 
steps with the Soviet Union and other 
socialist countries to help the Arab 
states, Mao Tse-tung directed his efforts 
towards slander and provoking the 
breaking off of the Arab countries' 
friendly relations with the Soviet Union 
and other socialist countries in order to 
isolate them and thereby facilitate U.S. 
and Israeli aggression, 
At a time when the vast majority of 
countries have applied economic sanc-
tions to the South African Republic, 
which, created by the British imperial-
ists and colonialists, proclaimed barbar-
ous apartheid as its policy at home, Mao 
Tse-tung acts at one with the U.S. and 
British imperialists. He has used this 
' opportunity to promote trade with the 
South African Republic, Mt only pur-
chasing chromium ore from that racial. 
ist Government but selling it armaments 
and munitions, thereby helping in the 
repressions against the indigenous popu-
lation of the South African Republic. In 
effect, he sides with the white racialists, 
vivid testimony of this being his vitriol-
ic outpourings against Martin Luther 
King, the late leader of the civil rights 
movement, of the movement against 
poverty and against the U.S. war of ag-
gression in Vietnam. This man, who 
enjoyed the respect and affection of all 
American Negroes, was called by Mao 
Tse-tung "a tool in the service of the 
reactionary ruling groups'in the U.S.A." 
During the "cultural revolution" 'Mao 
Tse-tung still further intensified his 
policy of pressure founded on barbar-
ous great-power chauvinism with ,re-
gard to developing Asian and African 
countries, which had recently shaken off 
imperialist rule. The reactionary 
"thought" of Mao Tse-tung is exported 
by compulsion with the help of Chinese 
diplomatic representatives and technical 
experts to countries like Nepal, Cambo-
dia and Ceylon. Mao Tse-tung forces citi-
zens of other countries to wear badges 
with his portrait, infringes upon the 
sovereignty of other states, and inter-
feres in the internal affairs of other 
countries, thereby giving rise to inter-
state conflicts and development that 
seriously harm relations between states. 
Vis-a-vis India he not only frequently 
provokes armed frontier conflicts but 
proclaims his intention to organize arm-
ed uprisings in India with the purpose 
of overthrowing the Indian Government. 
In Burma he organizes Chinese resi-
dents into hungweiping gangs in order 
to provoke armed conflicts and blood-
shed; in addition, he is hatching out 
Plans for an armed invasion across the 
Burmese frontier and the organization 
of armed uprisings to overthrow the 
Burmese Government. Protesting against 
Mao Tse-tung's interference, through 
Chinese diplomats, in their internal af-
fairs African countries like Dahomey, 
the Central African Republic and Bu-
rundi have already broken off diploma-
tic relations with China. In Kenya and 
Tunisia, as well, Mao Tse-tung has used 
Chinese doplomats for openly circulat-
ing documents discrediting the govern-
ments of these countries and propagat-
ing the reactionary "thought" of Mao 
Tse-tung. This has brought diplomatic 
relations between China and these coun-
tries to the brink of rupture. 
The policy pursued by Mao Tse-tung 
with regard to developing Mian and 
African countries is fully in line with 
the Great-Han "Celestial Empire" policy 
of the Chinese feudal emperors. Its sub-
stance is that a foreign state must be-
come either a vassal of the "Celestial 
Empire" or its enemy. Having become 
the victims of Mao Tse-tung's insults, 
the Asian and African countries have 
replied to him by word and action that 
they have no desire to be vassals of . 
Mao Tse-tung. 
4. He plans to provoke a U.S.-Soviet 
and world war. 
At the Moscow International Meeting 
in 1957 he openly pressured for a nuclear 
war, which would destroy from one-third 
to half of mankind. In documents at-. 
tacking the world communist movement, 
published in April 1960, he continued to 
call for a nuclear war, which could 
destroy the entire world. He constantly 
shouts that the "atomic bomb is a paper 
tiger," that the "hydrogen bomb is a 
paper tiger," that atomic and thermo-
nuclear war is not "terrible at all." 
The purpose of all this is to demora-
lize the world anti-war movement and 
instigate a world war. He constantly 
comes out against any action taken by 
the Soviet Union and other socialist 
' countries on the international stage to 
relax international tension, avert a 
world war and secure peaceful co-exist-
ence and peaceful conditions for the 
building of communism and socialism. 
His objective is to undermine world 
peace. He slanderously accuses the lead-
enship of the Soviet Union of "modern 
revisionism," of "capitulating to U.S. 
imperialism," of "U.S.-Soviet collabora-
tiob in order to rule the world together." 
The motive underlying these accusations 
is that in upholding the interests of the 
Soviet people and of all mankind, the 
leadership of the Soviet Union does not 
accept his mad proposals for the un-
leasing of a U.S.-Soviet and world war. 
The main reason for Mao, Tse-tung's 
constant displeasure with the U.S. rul-
ers is that, being aware that by starting 
a thermonuclear war against the U.S.S.R. 
they would be signing their own death 
warrant, they do not dare to begin a,

war in which while destroying the 
U.S.S.R. and the international commun-
ist movement, both 'deeply hated by him, 
the U.S.A. would also be destroyed to-
gether with other states whom he deep-
ly envies for having a higher level of 
economic and scientific development. 
His dream of "winning twice on one 
stake," if it were to come true, would 
permit him to spend the remainder of 
his years enjoying the longed-for life of 
a sovereign and ruler of that part of 
China's territory where, according to his 
imagination, "there would still be 
people," while at the same time he would 
make an attempt to realize his age-old 
dream of becoming the "master of the 
world" and instituting his rule over it 
on the ruins left in the wake of a world 
thermo-nuclear war. 
5. In the economic sphere he is sever-
ing all ties with the world socialist 
system and transferring them to the 
capitalist camp. 
This, above all, is clearly seen in the 
changes that have taken place in China's 
foreign trade. In 1950, right after the 
country's liberation, China's foreign 
trade still bore the old semicolonial 
features: 74 percent was with the capi-
talist countries of which 50 percent fell 
to the share of the imperialist states, 
while the share of the socialist countrie 
and the U.S.S.R. was 26 and 23 percent 
respectively. By 1959, China's foreign 
trade had undergone radical changes: all' 
foreign comme,rce with capitalist coun-
tries 'dropped' to 32 percent of which 
,the imperialist states accounted for 23 
percent, at the same time trade with 
socialist countries went up to 68 per-
cent including 60 percent with the 
U.S.S.R.. Here we have a clear manifes-
tation of the distinguishing feature of 
the foreign trade of a socialist country. 
But by 1967, the situation in China's* 
foreign trade became evdn worse than 
in 1950: commerce with the non-social-
ist countries went up to 80 percent in-
cluding 57 percent with imperialist 
states, while trade with socialist coun-
tries fell to 20 percent of which only 7 
percent was with the U.S.S.R. Today 
China's chief trading partners are not 
only Britain and the countries of the 
British Commonwealth ? Canada, New 
Zealand and Australia ? not only Japan 
and West Germany but also the U.S.A. 
which Mao Tse-tung daily showers with 
Invectives and curses but with which 
he has established economic ties 
through Hongkong. Thus, in the sphere 
of foreign economic relations China has 
once again become dependent on im.

facts show that they were a pretext for 
severing foreign economic ties with the 
world socialist system and going over 
to the capitalist camp. He views as 
necessary economic co'operation with 
the capitalist world as part of his plat-
form of "reliance on one's own forces," 
and economic ties with the world social-
ist system as unnecessary "outside assis; 
tance." All this is striking indication of 
the fact wihat in the sphere of foreign 
policy, *it as in the sphere of domes-
tice policy, Mao Tse-tung has taken the 
road of political and economic rap-
prochement with the bourgeoisie direct-
ed against the proletariat and the work-, 
jag people, that he is supporting capi-
talism and is against socialism. 
Such are the five principal crimes 
actually committed by Mao Tse-tung in 
the international sphere. There are in-
disputable facts proving these crimes, 
and they cannot be disproved by what-
ever dcmogagy Mao Tse-tung and his 
group may resort to. The crimes of Mao 
Tse-tung and his group in international 
affairs just as in China's internal affairs, 
merely play into the hands of imperial-
ist circles and reactionaries in all coun-
tries headed by the U.S.A. Therefore 
they have been welcomed in imperialist 
countries with unfeigned pleasure. For-
mer U.S. President Johnson, former 
State Secretary Dean Rusk, former De-
fence Secretary Robert ,McNamara re-
peatedly spoke in favor of hastening 
the adjustment of U.S.-Chinese relations 
and establishment of U.S. co-operation 
with Mao Tse-tung in the Far East. 
A conference of U.S. specialists On 
the Far East frankly declared that the 
White House is staking on Mao Tse-tung 
because his victory in the cultural revo-
lution would be in the interests of the 
U.S.A. Expressing hopes for the estab-
lishment of co-operation with Mao Tse-
tung, the U.S. Government has not only 
permitted U.S. publishers to issue Mao 
Tse-tung's "book of quotations" and sell 
them in the U.S.A., but has also sanc-. 
tioncd their ,export, thus helping Mao 
Tse-tung to spread his "book of quota-
tions.". 
It is universally known that Spain's 
fascist secret police and the neo-nazi 
West German secret service more than 
anything else fear the publications of 
the Spanish and German Communist 
Parties or any other Communist litera-
it , 
i amt o . 
Nonetheless, they do not ban the anti-
Soviet and anti-communist propaganda 
materials put out by Mao Tse-tung. On 
the contrary they help spread these 
materials and even frequently reprint 
them. All this leaves no doubt as to 
who are Mao Tse-tung's friends today 
and against whom their joint efforts are 
directed. ? 
No matter how Mao Tse-lung and his 
group shift and dodge and no matter 
what screen they set up around them-
selves ? whether it be the slogan of. 
"struggle ,against modern revisionism" 
or the slogans "spur the world revolu-
tion" and "support the national libera-
tion movement," and no matter what 
double-dealing they engage in under the 
the mask of "we are against the U.S.S.R. 
and against the U.S.A." in order to ca-
mouflage their anti-Sovietism and their 
make-believe struggle against U.S. im-
perialism, no matter what old and new 
intrigues they may employ to conceal 
their activity ? they cannot cover up 
the real character of their anti-Soviet, 
anti-communist and man-hating crimes 
in international affairs. The five crimes 
,they have committed, are five indict-
meats written with their own hand. 
CPYRGHT 
Inasmuch as such 10 major crimes 
inside the cduntry and 5 major crimes 
in international affairs were perpetuated 
on the initiative, under the personal 
supervision and on instructions of Mao 
Tse-tung, he has become not only an 
enemy of the Communist Party of China 
but also the common enemy of the in-
ternational communist movement. He 
has become not only the enemy of the 
Chinese people, but the common enemy 
of the entire progressive and peace-
loving humanity. 
Mao Tse-tung spares no effort to com-
mit every kind of infamy chiefly for the 
sake of achieving his extremely egois-
tic goals, namely while he lives he wants 
to preserve his unlimited imperial rule 
in China and to prevent anyone from 
overthrowing his power. And when he 
will leave this world nobody will be 
able to make him pay for the terrible 
crimes he committed during his life-
time.'Yet facts show that his intentions 
are not destined to materialize and that 
everything will be totally unlike his ex-
pectations 
Mao Tse-tung is aware Of his real 
position and realizes the dangers aris-
ing from his hostility towards the Com-
munist Party of China and the interna-
tional communist movement, towards 
the whole Chinese nation and all pro-
gressive and peace-loving mankind. He 
can be likened ,with a coward whO is 
a e y night and try-
ing to dispel his fright by whistling. 
He requires a daily dose of sedatives. 
And so on his instructions Chinese news-
paper editors daily give a great deal of 
space to articles describing how the 
Changs, Wans, Lis and Chaos throughout. 
their country "dearly " love Chairman 
Mao," how they are "devoted to Chair-
Mao" and wish him "long, long years." 
They also publish other stereotype 
eulogies, which can only evoke a feeling 
of disgust and loathing. This is supple-
mented by false reports allegedly corn-
ing from abroad that in all countries 
citizens ,A, B, C, D, etc. "dearly love 
Mao Tse-tung," that they are "devoted to 
Mao Tse-tung," and his "thought" and 
that they wish him "innumerable years 
of life." All this is just as shameless 
and absurd as his personal deificatitict 
as the "sun," or all the all-seeing and 
omnipotent "living god". All this is just, 
as comical and ridiculous as his claims 
that his "thoughts" are a talisman Ca-
pable of "miraculously and imme?dia-
tely transforming any wish into reality," 
and that his "Three Old Articles," 
"Book of Quotations" and "Selected 
Works" are a "Magic Encyclopaedia" 
or "sacred books." MI this is by no 
means a sign of his strength, but of 
his extreme weakness. It shows his mor-
bid fear and desperation of a person 
held in a vice of difficulties at home 
and abroad, of ti'man abandoned by his 
near ones and associates, a man who in 
solitude faces a dismal future. ' 
No matter what Mao Tse-tung invents 
or does to ele'vate or praise himself, to 
deceive or soothe himself, historical, 
facts prove that only one destiny awaits 
a man such as Mao Tse-tung is today, 
and that destiny is inevitable defeat, 
which neither charlatanism, incanta-
tions, demogogy, slander, nor resort to 
killings, arson "rebellions," "capture of 
power" or other like methods can avert. 
Such is the irr;:vocable law,of historical 
development. And such will be the inevi-
table end of Mao Tse-tung, of his 
"thought"?and of his policy. 
Why has Mao Tse-tung fallen so low? 
It is by no means an unexpected pheno-
menon but the inevitable outcome of 
the natural evolution of the thought and 
policy of Mao Tse-tung over the decades. 
All this has its ideological and theoreti-
cal as well as historical and social roots. 
But these questions have to be studied 
separately.
