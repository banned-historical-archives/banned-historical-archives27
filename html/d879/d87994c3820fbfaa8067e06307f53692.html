Army 
unrest tests 
Sadat !orntacy 
By John K. Cooley 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christia-a Science Monitor 
Beirut, Lebanon 
Last week's reported Egyptian Army un-
rest in Cairo was a relatively minor incident 
with possibly major future implications for 
President Anwar al-Sadat's government, in-
formed observers here believe. 
President Sadat might clarify the situation 
In a major speech, which Cairo Radio said 
was scheduled Oct. 25, these observers 
thought. Meanwhile Egyptian Government 
sources and travelers from Cairo did not 
confirm initial reports Oct. 21 and 22 from the 
British Broadcasting Corporation of a major 
coup attempt by several hundred Army 
officers said to have driven into Cairo at the 
? head of two or more columns of armored 
personnel carriers a week earlier. 
They did, however, indicate that at least 
one junior Army officer, described as a 
captain, led several armored cars to Cairo's 
Al Hussein Mosque. The captain delivered a 
fiery oration demanding immediate war 
' against Israel to end the stalemate along the 
Suez Canal, where he said Egyptian soldiers 
were "eating the bitter sands of Suez." 
He and a few followers are said to have 
been arrested immediately. 
The incident, its rarnifirAtons, and the 
number and rank of offlc.!r.; linplicated are 
all in doubt at this writing. W is certain is 
that it reflected the profr,ur.,! state of dis-
satisfaction in the Egyptian armed forces. 
Neither President Sadat's dii or.attc et-
forts to end the state of "no war, no peace" 
with Israel, his removal of Soviet military 
advisers last summer, nor his current efforts 
(begun by Egyptian Prime Minister 
Sidky's visit to Moscow last week to improve 
tics with the Soviets have chamzed this. 
Neither the United States nor Western Eu-
rope have responded to President Sadat's 
hopes for moral, diplomatic, and economic 
support ? hopes which President Sadat again 
expressed publicly in art interview appealing 
? for West European understanding of Egypt's 
position, broadcast by the French state 
television network Oct. 21. 
Its men were said to be clamoring for 
Immediate action against Israel in retaliation 
for Israeli attacks on Lebanon in September. 
Miles Copeland, former U.S. diplomat and 
Central Intelligence Agency official in the 
Middle East, said in an interview here that 
senior Egyptian officers "have been suspect-
ing this sort of thing was coining for some 
time." 
President Sadat's security men, Mr. Cope-
land speculated, may have deliberately led 
on or provoked the "coup" attempt in order 
to pinpoint dissident junior officers "whose
names nobody ever heard of.': 
Discipline lag seen 
Mr. Copeland, once a friend of the late 
President Nasser and author of the best-
selling book, "The Game of Nations," about 
U.S. relations with Mr. Nasser, said that 
under President Nasser "discipline in the 
14:yptian Army was very, very good. It has 
broken down recently, not so much because 
of people genuinely wanting to fight Israel, 
but because they have lost their pride. 
President Sadat knows this very, very well. 
He's taken all sorts of measures to try to 
reinstate some pride in his Army." 
Mr. Copeland recalled that President Nas-
ser in late years "got very, very suspicious of 
those around him, particularly senior Army 
commanders." President Nasser, according 
to Mr. Copeland, began to develop young 
officers as a counterweight to the more 
senior ones. 
In Mr. Copeland's view, these younger 
officers were like "time bombs" planted 
within the Egyptian system, which President 
Sadat now wants to flush out and defuse. 
Mutiny reported 
The incident at the Al Hussein Mosque 
about Oct. 16 and ensuing special security 
measures in Cairo came about three weeks 
after the reported mutiny of an Egyptian

A Child's Guide to the Arabs 
MILES COPELAND 
The first play to be based on the life of President Nasser appeared last week in 
Beirut, Lebanon, in a gymnasium-cum-auditorium called "The Theatre of Revolu-
tion." It will never reach Broadway; the audience was unenthusiastic?or perhaps 
just bewildered; there were no cries for "author" (anyway, the author was 
anonymous); it ran for only three nights and got only one review ("Elegant in 
its simplicity," said an arty, left-wing French-language weekly). But there was 
one line which I treasure: "If my people believe all I say," mused the play's 
Nasser, "they are missing the point." 
The author must have known Nasser personally, for Nasser spoke often in 
these terms of the contradictions in "Arab" public opinion, and of the difficulties 
they posed for any leader addressing his public. To attain power, the leader of an 
Arab country must make bigger and   
better promises than his rivals. Since no "unite" Egypt with it.) Or war with

BUT that's not all. The leader of an 
Arab country must make his promises 
in terms which the members of his 
audience think they accept, but really 
don't. He must have the knack of 
speaking passionately and earnestly in 
one set of terms, while allowing his 
audience to understand that they may 
add up what he says in quite another. 
Take Arab nationalism, for example. 
No leader of an Arab country could 
attain power, or hold it for long, were 
he not to manifest fervent support to 
the notion of Arab unity. But how long

One could go on and on. The leader 
of an Arab country attains and holds 
power by denouncing the United States 
and praising Russia, yet he spends a 
fair percentage of his waking hours try-, 
ing to figure ways of making secret 
deals with the United States, or with 
private American interests, showing 
clearly that he values his deals with the 
Soviets mainly for what they are worth 
as leverage in negotiating alternative 
sources of aid. He pours praise on the 
Palestinians, addressing them as "our 
Arab brethren," yet he treats them as 
foreigners, and second-rate foreigners 
at that. (The Libyan government 
allowed some four thousand Palestinians 
to become Libyan citizens, but has 
since rescinded the decision, and is 
currently working out a deportation 
scheme which will be much less con-
spicuous than [hat of Uganda's against 
its Asian population, but just as 
thorough.) Most important, the leaders 
of Arab countries must constantly talk 
"revolution," yet their various "Revolu-
tionary Command Councils" talk and 
think in terms which would have been 
considered reactionary in the days of 
the Ottoman Empire.

Nasser, Arab Firebrand or-Humanitarian? 
By EDMUND FULLER 
In July, 1952, a group of Egyptian army of-
ficers carried out a coup that deposed King 
Farouk and proclaimed a military govern-
ment under the titular leadership of General 
Mohammed Neguib. In fact the principal 
leader of the revolution was Lt. Col. Carnal 
Abdel Nasser. On the eve of the coup, he 
found'one of his associates in an overly emo-
tional state and said to him, in English, "To-
night there is no room for sentiment, we must 
be ready .for' the unexpected." Asked why he 
had spoken in English, "Nasser replied .svillaa 
laugh that Arabic was not a suitable language 
?to express the need for calm." ' 
Even so slight an anecdote reveals more 
than Most Americans have known about the 
man who ushered 
Egypt into the mod-
ern world and altered 
the bilabces of power 
In the Middle East. 
The American. public 
has seen him genes-
ally as.a strident na-
tionalist, a Pan-Arabist and a mi14ary adven-
. twist. Countering this, the anecdote offers a 
glimpse of the range of his education, his cool 
deliberateness and his humor. It exemplifies 
"the numerous surprises in Anthony Nutting's 
biography, "Nasser" (Dutton, 493 pages, S10), 
a book crammed with important historical-Po-
litiell information and at the same time full 
of human interest. 
It would be, hard to find another man so 
well qualified to write such a book. Anthony 
Nutting is a scholar and diplomat with partic-
ular expertise in the tangled Middle East. He 
served EnIand as Under-Secretary of State 
fox Foreign Affairs in 1951. negotiated With 
Nasser the Anglo-Egyptian agreement of 1954, 
and was later Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs and leader of the U.K. delegation to 
,the General Assembly of the U.N. 
? It is fair to ask if an Englishman of such 
.background could write -with detachment 
;about events in which he participated, in an 
.arena in which his country had been an impe-
rial power. Putting aside the fact that nobody 
can write .really objectively about anything, 
Mr. Nutting does bring remarkable detach-
ment to materials involving some of the most 
Inflammatory political passions of the cen-
tury. He resigned from his government post 
In 1956 in protest against the English-French-
Israeli attack on Egypt in the Suez crisis. 
Mr. Nutting begins his book with a needed 
brief review of Egyptian history, noting that 
.Nasser became "the first true Egyptian to 
rule Egypt since the Persian conquest nearly 
2,500 years before." The dynasty which ended 
with Farouk was Turkish. After "two and .a. 
half thousand years of taking orders succes-
sively from Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzan-
tine. Arab, Kurdish, Turkish, French and 
.British proconsuls, the people of Egypt were 
at long last to regain their national state-
hood." Without awareness of these centuries 
Bookshelf 
of subservience and impoverishment the na-
tionalistic emotional force behind .Nasser's 
reign cannot be understood. 
Nasser, born in 1018 in Alexandria, was the 
son of a post-office worker who dame from a 
proud clan of 'Upper (Southern) Egypt. He ed-
ucated himself zealously and was a prodi-
gious reader in his teens, including such writ-
ers as Voltaire, Rousseau and Dickens. He 
studied the lives of Alexander, Julius Caesar, 
Napoleon and Gandhi. He became a fervent 
nationalist. As the son of a fellah he was 
barred from the Military Academy, his best 
hope of more advanced education, but by per-
sistence he gained admittance. 
Early he became convinced that the mili-
tary structure, rather than subterranean po-
litical parties, would be the path to power and 
revolution. At iio time, even when playing the 
Soviets against the West, was Nasser ever 
Communist or interested in leftist ideology. 
The rise of Nasser is the history of modern 
Egypt. Mr. Nutting traces this closely in a 
book that is fascinating but densely textured 
and demanding. American readers will have 
special interest in the treatment of the Aswan 
Darn affair, the Suez. Crisis, and the Six Days ? 
War of 1967. ? 
Mr. Nutting is harsh in his judgment of his 
own Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, whom he 
believes to have badly mismanaged Middle 
Eastern policies. 'He is equally severe about 
John _Foster Dulles on many detailed counts. 
By his "renege" on the Aswan High Dam, 
Mr. Nutting charges, "Dulles bad . . . pulled 
down the pillars of the temple on Western in-
fluence not only in?Egypt, but throughout the 
Arab world as well." He shows Nasser as 
driven reluctantly toward the Soviets when he 
preferred Western alliances. He had no illu-
sions about the Russians. 
Mr. Nutting takes no notice of the ironic 
aspects of the Aswan High Dam, which has 
not been able to bring the hoped for agricul-
tural and economic advancements, and about 
which increasing suspicions arise that it may. 
be ecologically disastrous to the whole East-
ern Mediterranean. As lightweight but pro- . 
vocative collateral reading I recommend the 
current "Aswan," by Michael Hein) (Knopf, 
275 pages, $6.95) which is chilling .science-fic-
tion in a simulated documentary style. 
? One can barely suggest the scope and de-
tail of this historical-political biography. Nas-
ser is. presented in the round. Among many 
surprising things is the close contact long 
maintained with 'him by the CIA, chiefly 
through the person of Kermit Roonvelt who 
won Nasser's confidence on terms of true per-
sonal friendship. We see 'skilled American 
diplomats in Cairo whose advice was ignored 
by variosis administrations back home. - 
The Egyptian leader had churns and also 
grace under pressure. ? His humor was often 
rueful. Sucked by misjudgment and misinfor-
mation into a long thilitary? entanglement in 
Yemen, which sometimes involved half his 
armed forces, Nasser called it "My Viet-
nam." Often at odds With Jordan's King Hus-
sein, Nasser said to him after the catastrophe 
of the Six Days War, as the king was depart-
ing for America: "I got you into this mess, so 
forget about my losses and go and kiss Lyn-
don Johnson's hand and ask him to give you 
back the West Bank." . ? 
He had handled himself brilliantly in the 
Suez Crisis, had .erred badly in the Six Days 
War and the Yemen affair. In his last action, 
as chairman of the conference of Arab coun-
tries seeking to end the warfare between Hus-
sein arid the Palestine liberation forces in Jor-
dan in 1970, he was again at his best,?pronapt-
ing Mr. Nutting to cite "an old saying in the. 
Moslem scriptures that those who are about 
to die often speak and net with exceptional, 
wisdom and vision." A few days later he was 
dead?worn out. 
Nasser had faults and made errors hut he 
also had greatneas and did much for Egypt. 
After Suez, "It would have required a man of 
almost superhuman qualities not to, be carried 
away by the idolatry with which Nasser was 
nbw hailed by the Arab masses." He was car-
Tied away into his Pan-Arab adventurism, 
dreaming of uniting the Arab world into One 
political entity and failing utterly because "he 
consistently failed to understand his fellow 
Arabs." He emerged from that worst period 
not in irresponsible rage, but wiser. 
Mr. Nutting offers one exceptionally-in-
formed man's view of a span of history in-
volving major events and great passions. No

will agree with none of it?but it is one of.the

Egypt smashes U.S.-Israeli plot 
CAIRO ? The semi-official Egyptian daily newspaper, al-Ahram 
("The Pyramids"), said on Monday that Egyptian security police had 
discovered three underground anti-government groups tied in with U.S. 
and Israeli intelligence, and that charges were being prepared against 
them. Al-Ahram said the leader of one of the groups, the so-called 
"Arab Vanguard Organization" (al-Tali'a al-'Arabiyya), was Abdel 
Shafei.Eiss.4, who was employed on the staff of President Anwar el-
Sadat as an economist. ? 
Earlier, al-Ahram revealed that an American and several Belgian 
and French citizens were involved in espionage and plotting against the 
government. The American was identified as Sue Anne Harris, who 
worked in Cairo as a "secretary" in the U.S. Mission (U.S.-Egyptian 
diplomatic ties weresevered in 1967, but the U.S. maintains a Mission in 
the Spanish Embassy in Cairo). Al-Ahram etiitor, Mohammed Has-
sanein Heykal, wrote that Miss Harris was caught "red-handed" in the 
act of trying to obtain secret information on Egyptian air strength; 
she was released last December, he said. She was a liaison agent for the

Washington's persistence turned into pres-

Mr. Heikal said: "Washington then said,

U.S. Envoy 
Said to Spy 
In Egypt 
From sews Dispatches 
CAIRO, Feb. 17?An Ameri-
can women diplomat was ar-
rested here on spy charges 
late last year, the editor of the 
influential newspaper Al Ah-
ram said today, Reuter re-
ported. 
The-woman was not named, 
and the editor, Mohamed Has, 
sanein Heikal, Ci-d--not make 
clear whether she was still 
being detained. 
[A State Department spokes-
man refused to comment on 
the report. "We never com-
ment on allegations like that," 
the spokesman said.] 
Heikal said the woman was 
arrested with an Egyptian 
man of Greek origin when a 
"huge spy ring" involving the 
U.S. Central Intelligence 
i/ Agency was uncovered. 
Heikal said Washington had 
Insisted that the woman be re-
leased immediately and repa-
triated to the United States,' 
but Cairo had replied that in-
vestigations must be carried 
out first. 
In a further exchange of 
messages Heikal wrote, the 
U.S. government said the 
alleged espionage was not 
directed at Egypt but the 
Soviet Union. The aim was to 
obtain details on new Soviet 
aircraft sent to Egypt. 
It was not clear when these 
exchanges took place. 
Helkal. in his weekly article 
for Al Ahram, said the Egyp-
tian, the manager of a large 
company in Cairo, was the 
chief defandant in the case. 
The Egyptian was not named 
either. But Heikal said his CIA 
contact was the American 
diplomat, who was caught red-
-handed. 
In another espionage case, 
Washington Post correspond-
ent William Dullforce wrote 
from Cairo that President An-
war Sadat said today that three 
Eurpoeans had been arrested 
for acting as Israeli agents 
and stirring up trouble during 
studeht demonstration in Janu, 
having been recruited by Is-1 
raeli agents to distribute leaf-
lets among students. 
The president also answered I 
questions on Egypt's military; 
capability and the prospects 
of greater domestic democracy. 
Al Ahram reported this 
morning that the three ? men 
arrived in Cairo a few days 
after the beginning of the 
student sit-in. Sadat said ti-solf 
leaflets incited the students 
to overthrow their govern-
ment. criticized the Soviet 
Union and praised Sudan for 
getting rid of its Communists. 
Sadat emphasized that the 
students themselves had been 
in no way involved in the 
plans of Israeli intelligence. 
The president, siho in his 
opening speech to the special 
meeting yesterday offered to 
resign if the people at any 
time lacked confidence in his 
leadership, was thanked yes-
terday evening by a delegation 
of students from all Egyptian 
universities for releasing the 
last of their comrades de-
tained since the January dem-
onstrations. ? 
All indications so far are 
that Sadat will get the vote of 
confidence he has been seek-
ing from the national congress 
which finishes its three-day 
.meeting Friday evening. 
[United. Press International 
quoted Cairo's state-controlled 
newspapers as saying that the 
council's various committeeg 
"expressed full support" for 
Sadat today. UPI said political 
sources predicted that the en-
tire membership of the party 
would endorse the president 
at the end of the special meet-

The end of the meeting will 
coincide with the arrival in

Met In Secret Peace Talks 
BY EDWIN ROTH 
News special correspondent 
1 )NDON 
? ONE OF THE most 
dramatic cloak-and-dagger 
diplomacy operations in 
world history was the top-
level peace conference be-
tween Israel, Jordan, - and 
Egypt around a table in 
London. immediately before 
Christmas 1970. It was the 
Erst formal Israeli-Arab 
meeting since the 1949 armis-
tice talks on the Greek island 
Rhodes ? and it' had im-
mensely important results, 
which still exist. 
'A' few days before Christ-
mas 1970, I met by chance in 
a:. London restaurant an 
Israeli who, because of the 
very, special position he had 
htld .in 1967, had witnessed 
fascinating secret ? historic 
events ? and knows all of 
Israel's most important state 
secrets. I asked him whether 
he could spare the time to 
meet me for a lengthy talk ? 
"historic research rather 
than journalism" ? and we 
arranged to meet on Deceni-
ber 26, which is a holiday in 
Britain;? 
I knew then that Israel's 
(^reign minister Abba Eban 
and King Hussein of Jordan 
had been in London at the 
same time immediately be-
fore Christmas, and mention-
ed recent stories about earli-
" meetings between Eban 
and Hussein. The Israeli to 
thorn I mentioned this dur-
tfne our talk on December-26 
mt a good poker player, 
and I could see that my 
remarks worried him very 
8114(h. He suggested that env" 
rsanalistic speculation about 
ft'  might do tremendous 
and cost many lives. 
I didn't speculate 
good reasons why telling the 
story now cannot do any 
harm ? though it may be 
officially denied until either 
one of the three governments 
directly involved, or the 1.7.? 
S. administration, or the 
British government, will 
want to release it officially. 
In this context, it is signifi-
cant that after more than 
fifteen years none of the 
three participating govern-
ments has yet publicly ad-
mitted the historic fact of the 
top-secret conference be-
tween Israel's Prime Minis-
ter David Ben-Gurion, 
Israel's Chief-of-Staff Gener-
al Moshe Dayan, France's 
Prime Minister Goy Mollet, 
and Britain's Foreign Secre-
tary Selwyn Lloyd in the 
Paris suburb Sevres in Octo-
ber 1956 ? which decided the 
Israeli-British-French Suez 
Canal WRY against Egypt. 
Fall of 1970 
IN THE FALL of 1970, two 
immensely important events 
happened ih the Middle East, 
King Hussein of Jordan won 
his civil war against the 
Palestinian guerrillas, and 
his throne?probably also his 
life ? was saved by Israel's 
concentration of mobilized 
armored and infantry forces. 
in 'Northern Israel, which 
caused the invading Syrian 
tanks to withdraw from Jor-
dan. In Egypt, Gamal Abdel 
Nasser died, and his succes-
sor Anwar Sadat was very 
weak. 
President Richard Nixon 
and Secretary of State Wil-
liam Rogers wanted to avert 
the danger of a new Middle 
East .war by bringing ,top-lev-
el representatives of Israel, 
Jordan, and Egypt to the 
same table ? which could be

? 
_ 
This parliamentary guts-
tion was disallowed for se-
curity reasons, and security 
?censorship prevented its pub-
lication in Israel, and its 
transmission abroad by for-
eign correspondents. But it 
was heard by about 250 
ordinary people in the public 
cy. The Central laelligence 
Agency's seji7r-diplilmacy. 
sertion was told to arrange 
this conference, which be-
-came one of its most success-
ful coups. 
London waS chosen as the 
venue, because King Hussein 
and Abba Eban could find 
good ostensible reasons for 
-visiting London. - 
When Eban and Hussein 
had met in London in 1968, 
London's Israeli embassy 
had made a planning mis-
take for which it Was not to 
blame. Hussein was known to 
be at London's most expen-
sive private hospital, the 
London Clinic, where he was 
treated for his chronic nose 
ailment. Eban's visit to Lon-
don at the same time was to 
be top-secret. 
But when Eban arrived at 
London airport, he walked by 
chance into a crowd of news 
media representatives wait-
ing for another news person-
ality ? and was recognized 
by them. He told them he 
had come privately to see his 
mother who lives here, but 
his arrival got publicity 
which he and Hussein had 
wanted to avoid. 
The- ingenious camouflage 
for the London meeting in 
Christmas Week 1970 be-
tween Eban, Hussein, and 
Egypt's Foreign Minister 
Mahmoud Riad was to be 
that Eban's and Hussein's 
movements before the con-
ference would be enormously 
public. 
There was an. additional 
diplomatic safeguard. Early 
in November 1970, the Israeli 
-government leaked- the story 
of the dramatic meeting be-
tween Hussein and Israel's 
deputy prime minister \lag 
Allon in a car in Israel's 
gallery. In Israel, this meant' 
that the entire population 
knew it within 48 hours. 
On December :1,:i(ing Hus-
sein arrived in London at the 
start of a western capitals 
'tour during which he also 
visited Washimtton, Paris, 
and Bonn. The main purpose 
of this tour was to provide 
camouflage, for the coming 
London Christmas confer-
ence with Eban and .Mah-
moud Riad. Throughout it; 
he denigd the story of his 
previous meetings with Eban 
and Alton. 
King Hussein's wife and 
children had been living in 
Britain since the slimmer for 
their Safety. Hussein had not . 
met his family since June. 
To ensure maximum press 
and TV coverage, Hussein's 
two-year-old twin daughters. 
were taken to London airport_ 
by their British-born mother 
Princess Muna, and all posed 
for happy family pictures. . 
? 
Hussein meets Heath 
ON DECEMBER 4, Hus-
sein very publicly met Brif-
ain's Prime Minister Ed-
ward Heath. On the same 
day, the British Foreign Of-
fice announced that he would' 
return to London on, Decem-
ber 20 for further talks with 
Britain's Foreign Secretary 
Sir Alec Douglas-Ho*, 
On December 7, Hussein 
flew -to Washington, where he 
met President Nixon ? and 
got much publicity. Then he 
flew to Paris, where he met 
President Pompidou ? and

:Gamal Abdo' Nasser over dinner in Cairo 
that he did not want President Johnson to 
withdraw, troops from Vietnam; rather, he 
-wanted yore Americans sent there. Why? 
Becatss.e "we are afraid that some American 
militarists may press for a nuclear attack on 
China" and therefore ? American Involve-
anent would be !`an insurance policy against 
an. attack" because the U.S. troops would 
be "so close to us they will be our hostages." 
Item: In 1959 Nikita Khrushchev wrote 
*Camel Abdel Nasser that the Soviet Union 
- bad "feared" a year earlier to offer unlim-

Day Wax, Alexel Kosygiu counseled Egypt 
to "compromise, to work politically" after 
Nasser had closed the Straits of Tiran. 
Item: -Nasser had an "instinctive dislike" 
? for President Johnson because he had stud-

dent and was "shocked" at those in which 
Johnson had his feet on his desk and was 
showing off his operation scar. When the So-

?night to deliver a Johnson message sent via 
Kosygin, Nasser took it as an effort to "neu-
tralize" the Soviet Union in the Middle East.

THESE FRAGMENTS, and much more, 
are to be found in a forthcoming biography 
' of Nasser by his friend end confidant, Mo-
hemmed Heikal, the highly influential editor 
of Cairo's Al Abram; Excerpts from the 
book, to bo published next year, have been 
running for some weeks in the London Sun-
- day Telegraph. The items mentioned here 
are from those excerpts and while some of 
Ileikars reporting may be open to clues:Lion, 
- much of it has the ring of truth. 
Of all the middle rank nations none has 
had greater importance for and influence on 
- the superpowers than Egypt. Heikars ac-
count is both revealing and chilling. It is re-
vealing because It includes much new infor-
mation. on the Soviet attitude toward Egypt 
.as . well, as some details of Kennedy and 
Johnson diplomacy in the Middle East plus 
, a great deal about inter-Arab relationships. 
It is chilling because Heikal suggests that a 
sense of conspiracy and emotion rather?than 
?bard facts and analysis governed Nasser's 
critical decisions. What -this implies for the 
current Sada regime can only be guessed, 
Heikal's role today is es important as It was 
In Nasser's years.

the American troop involvement on a grand 
scale was only just beginning?that "the 
effect which this demoralization" through 
drugs "is - going to have" on the United 
Stales "will be far greater than anyone

Reikal reports that Nasser subsequently 
told Averell Hairiman of the first part 
-of Chou's remarks but not about the drugs. 
It was, says Heikal, the only time in the 
two-hour Nasser-Harriman meeting that the 
American "showed any real interest" in the 
talks. 
. 
Chou's bitterness toward the Soviet 7relnicn 
? also is deeply reflected in the Heikal ac-
count. When Nasser said the Soviets Were 
helping Egypt,. Chou replied that "they are. 
not going to help you. They are only in-
terested in helping ? themselve.e." The Rus-
sians complained that Nasser was getting 
too friendly with China: and all unnamed 
Russian leader, says Heikal, recounted an 
"insult" to the Soviet Union: Mao Tse-tung 
had gent his two sons to Moscow for train-

asked what they had learned- and when they ,?

War III." The most Khrushcher would . 
promise by way of help, to the Arabs was to 
announce Soviet maneuvers on the Bulgari-
an-Turkish border "but don't depend on any-
thing more than that." 
Nasser would not accept the idea of Israe-
li cohesion with Britain, and France in 1935 
though his Paris embassy had paid an un-
named Frenchman for just such advance in-
formation. By the time of the Six Day War, 
however, Nasser was ready . to believe in 
American collusion with Israel. As Heikal 
tells it, what eonyinced Nasser was an over-
flight of two American planes and a Johnson 
message via Kosygin delivered by the Soviet 
ambassador that the planes were on their 
way to help the American spy ship Liberty. " 
Nasser even was affected by an American 
press account that President Johnson had 
remarkedto his wife that "we have a war on 
our hands." "We" was equated with collie

'NEWSPAPER REOPENS 
EGYPTIAN SPY CASE ? 
Special to The New York Timea 
BEIRUT, Lebanon, Sept 12?
An Egyptian editor, now serv--
ing life imprisonment for spy-
ing for the -United States, has 
stated that he was falsely ac-
cused by a former Egyptian in-
telligence chief and that he had 
kept in touch with the Ameri-
cans because the late President. 
Game! Abdel Nasser( asked him 
for information about activities 
by the United States Embassy 
in Cairo. 
A leading newspaper here,' 
Al Anwar, today reopened the 
.case of Mustafa Amin, the 
founder, of Cairo's . prominent 
Akhbar Al Yom publishing 
house, who was sentenced to 
life imprisonment in 1965 after 
being found guilty of providing 
the United States Central In-
telligence Agency with secret 
information bearing on Egyp-
tian security. 
Al Anwar, which now em-
ploys Mr. Amin's twin brother, 
*Ali printed the text of a letter 
ithat Mr. Amin sent to President 
Nasser in December, 1965, 
pleading his innocence and ac-
cusing the intelligence chief at 
the time, Salah Nascr, of sub-
jecting to torture. The message, 
however, never reached. the 
President. 
The letter suggested that Mr. 
/Naser falsely accused Mr. Amin 
after hearing that President 
Nasser intended to make him 
ithe new intelligence chief. Mr. 
laser himself is now serving 
15-year prison sentence. He 
c'was convicted by a Cairo mili-
tary court after the six-clay war 
with Israel in 1967 .as im-
plicated in a conspiracy to
