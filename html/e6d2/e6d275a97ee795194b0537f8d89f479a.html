SOME CHANCES IN CHINE COMMUNIST POLICIES TOWARD 
KEY SOCI?A-714WPS 
L ORCANIZATION 
This paper is pre= ented. in outline form. Following the introduction 
there is an examination of past and present policies toward intellectuals (both 
literati and professional persons), the "national bourgeoisie", the peasants, 
and "democratic personages" or non-Communist politicians. Each section 
is divided into the following four headings: 
a. Past policy 
. Present policy 
c. Necessity for a policy change 
Context and perspective 
ORIGIP.;1 OF NEW POLICIES 
The .7une. 1956 National Peples Congress elaborated on several policy 
changes. Seve:zal were first stated earlier in the spring: 
A. On 2 May 1\41,ard Tse-tung, for the benefit of in,tellectuals, said 
"Let all flowers lli.o!nn. at the same time and let all 
schools. of thoughtvie- wIth. one another." 
B. Six ce February the State pvplicy toward the natio 
has evolved from the use of intimidation to "edueation by persuasion". 
The former capitalists are also to have a larger role in managing 
the 1nt State-private enterprises. 
C. Mat)), and the Central Commatee in April issued a-n instruction 
that the "entl'ausia.srn of the -oeata. for production" is to be 
heightened by giving "a high(r.lr income to 90% of the peasants 
in Calua.... The relationship between the individual coopera-
tive member and the collective "is to be 'eonsolidated". 
D. The head, of the United Front Department of the Party, speaking 
for the dentral Commifte in July, stated that party policy toward 
non-Coyittialitical is to "continue to consolidate and 
expand the Peoples Democratic United Front". He also said "there 
shcoild be mutual supervision of political parties, and first of all, 
supervision over the Chinese Communist Party."

III. DISCUSSION OF POLICIES 
A. INTELLECTUALS 
"Let all flowers bloom at the same time and let all 
schools of thought vie with one another." 
1. Literati  
a. 
1) May 1942: From a speech by Mao Tse-tung at a forum on 
literature and arts at Yenan: 
"Will not Marxism-Leninism then destroy the creative 
spirit? Yes. It will destroy any brand of creative spirit 
which is not of the masses and of the proletariat. And 
is it not right that these brands of creative spirit should 
be destroyed as far as proletarian writers and artists 
are concerned? I think so. They should be extirpated 
to make room for the new." 
2),..S.Ls_tember 1954: Liu Shao-Chi and Chou En-lai claimed that 
the Governments measures of thought reform had succeeded 
with all but "a handful of reactionary intellectuals". 
3) _n 1955: A mass campaign was launched against the 
idealism ofHu Feng, a pro-Communist writer. Hu had 
called upon the CCP Central Committee to eliminate the 
"Five Daggers" which, he maintained, literary dictatorship 
was thrusting into the brains of writers. These were that 
the writers: 
a) must have a Communist world view; 
b) must submit to thought reform; 
c) must "penetrate" the lives of workers, peasants and 
soldiers; 
d) must produce work of prescribed national form; and 
e) must only treat topics declared to be of great significance. 
4) ARILL...,L _1955: Kuo Mo-jo wrote an article for the Peking People's  
Daily  entitled "Anti-Socialist Program of Hu Feng". Kuo said that 
to admit influences from the past and from other countries, as Hu 
wished, would be "to drag all the people into a swamp of cosmopolitan 
" Kuo further explained that the question of subject was not 
whether a writer should treat topics of primary or seccindary import-
ance., but "whether he should serve the most important task at a 
given moment. "

Approved Rye' Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R040500190002-4 
On the question of variety Kuo said: 
"The content (of Huis demands) in essence comes to this: 
to dissolve the united organization of literary and artistic 
workers; to split the unity of the ranks of the writers; 
to liquidate collective leadership; to cease publication 
of the present literary journals and replace them with 
magazines published by different people who represent 
'qualitatively different tendencies' of literary artistic 
thought: to bring about free competition in the manner 
of the capitalistic market...." 
"It is completely clear that by following this program.... 
one could liquidate the system of unity of the mass organiza-
tions and unified leadership of these organizations, create 
a state of confusion, of universal divergencies, disorganiza-
tion and absence of leadership..." 
This policy is one of "unity of writers" or conformity of thought. 
b. 
June 1956: Fix.cerpts from a speech by Shen Yen-ping, Minister 
of Culture, at the National Peoples Congress in which he elaborated 
on the theme of "Let all flowers bloom at the same time.... 
"It is our opinion that, in accordance with the policy of 
'let all flowers bloom at the same tirnel... we should study 
western music and oil painting but should not neglect to 
carry on and develop our own legacies in music and the 
arts... .As long as it is a 'flower', we should let it 'bloom'. 
The greater the varieties and styles, the better it is." 
"It l.F4 our opinion that, according to the policy of 'let all 
schools of thought vie with one another, we should, let 
all schools of thought in literature and the arts prove their 
worth by means of free discussion and mutual competition. 
We believe that the Socialist and realistic methods of creative 
writing are tae best to reflect reality truthfully, that they 
point out to us the law of social development. Therefore, 
they are the best methods. We promote and publicize the 
Socialist and realistic methods of creative writing, but we 
also advocate that all writers should have complete freedom 
in choosing their respective methods of creative writing. That 
is, we should follow the principle of self-willingne SS. The 
victory of Socialist and realistic works of literature should 
be won by more and better writings, and should not depend 
on artificial measures."

"The people are tired, not because the great social events 
have been mentioned again and again, but because all the 
themes and the way in which they are depicted have invariably 
been similar. The people urgently want us to depict more 
important social events of the present era in more of our 
works, in a more lively and penetrating form. It is our 
opinion that the depiction of important social events is and 
will be the main direction toward which the efforts of writers 
sh.ould be channeled. However, this does not mean that we 
will exclude all other subjects. in addition to important 
social events, all facts of life not harmful to the under-
takings of the people can be used for literary themes. 
"Our literature should be made to serve the people, 
especially the workers, peasants, and soldiers. There 
should be no doubt about this...Here we must realize 
that 'let all schools of thought vie with one another', 
instead of creating confusion in thought, will overcome 
the subjectivism and dogmatism of the dominating school 
of thought and thereby lead finally to basic parallelism 
of thought and concepts." 
c. Necessity orpicvcne 
Excerpts from. Shen Yen-ping's speech: 
"The main question concerning work in the fields of 
literature. and the arts has been that of quality. In. the 
first six months of this year most theaters failed to 
attract large audiences. Why was this so? The reason 
was that there was a lack of good new plays. What is the 
key to the question of quality? The complaint of audiences 
and readers has invariable been that the plays are dull and 
dry because of their similarity. The faults have been 
generalization, formalism, and narrow scope in the 
choice of themes." 
"Limited scope and monotonous themes are common defects 
of toclayls literary works. Superficially it seems that the 
limitations in scope and monotony of themes are attributable 
to the depiction of important social events by all writers and 
artists, but actually many great social eventsstill have not 
been employed as themes." 
"If important social events are the sole theme of our writings, 
and if the latter are similar in form and content, the people will 
complain. As a matter of fact, they have already complained."

d. 
The violent suppression of Hu Feng and his associates 
obviously resulted in the intimidation of other writers to the 
point that their work has become mere parroting of the of-
ficially accepted line of thought. The new line is an attempt 
to induce work of a higher literary standard and at the same 
time to preserve the Communist theme in the writings. 
Many of Kuo Mo-jos criticisms of Hu Feng are specifically 
contradicted by Shen Yen-ping. 
I) Enos statement that to admit influences from the past 
and from other countries would lead to "cosmopolitanism" 
is refuted by Shen in saying that western music and painting 
should be studied. 
2) Suitable subjects for artistic endeavor are broadened by 
Shen to include "all facts of life not harmful to the under-
takings of the people" as well as "important social events". 
3) Kuo's thesis that variety of themes would lead to "a state 
of confusion, of universal divergencies, disorganization 
and absence of leadership" is denied specifically by Shen 
In saying "'let all schools of thought vie with one another', 
Instead of creating confusion in thought, will overcome 
the subjectivism and dogmatism of the dominating school 
of thought and thereby lead finally to basic parallelism 
of thought and concepts. " 
Hu Feng is not to be considered vindicated of his crimes, however, 
even though much of the ideological criticism levied against him 
is now invalid. His name is not mentioned once in the proceedings 
of the session of the NPC. This must be interpreted to mean that 
Hu Feng is till considered guilty of counterrevolutionary activities 
because he criticized the Communist Party and program. 
The new line cannot, therefore, be considered. to mean let ALL  
schools of thought contend, butisa.....:2a.:.oa.2 to th.e Communist 
oal in literature, I  e. the ideololcal trairnug of thaeo.)21-
tend with one another. No criticism of Communist programs or 
of materialism will be allowed under this new 'liberal' line, any.
than under the old line of unity of thought. Shen pointedly 
said "so long as it is a 'flower', we should let it tbloorrim. Hu Feng 
apparently is still considered as growing weeds instead of flowers 
even though he was pro-Communist well before 1949.

The "Five Daggers" thrusting into the brains of writers 
are largely unaffected by the new policy as interpreted 
by Shen. Writers must still have a Communist world 
view, must still submit to thought reform, must still 
penetrate the lives of workers, peasants and soldiers. 
Dagger number four is modified slightly in that artistic 
works of the west are now considered open to study but 
production must still be according to the prescribed 
national form. 
The fifth dagger, that writers must treat only topics 
decLazed to be of great significance, is also modified 
but not to the extent that it might at first appear. Suitable 
topics may now include. "all facts of life not harmful to the 
undertakings of the people" but, as Shen points out, "the 
depiction of important social events is and will be the main 
direction toward which the efforts of writers should be 
channeled." Consi.deri.g the widely publicized fate of Hu 
Feng, it is not considered likely that many intrepid writers 
will experiment to find out which facts of life are considered 
harmful to the undertakings of the people. 
Mao, it seems, was right when he said in 1942 that Marxism-
Leninism will destroy the creative spirit. The old creative 
spirit has been destroyed and there is. plenty of room for 
the "new", but, at this point, no new creative spirit has 
arisen to take its place. 
2. Professionals -- Scientists, teachers, en ineers, doctors, etc. 
a. Past policy 
1) San Fan (3-Ant; Mpverrient) 1951-52 
The 3-anti movement was ostensibly launched against 
"corruption, waste, and bureau.cratism" in the CCP and 
the state bureaucracy but actually was used by the Com-
mu.nists to eliminate political undesirables and to intimi-
date those who remained. WW Rostow sums up the upper-
most motives in the minds of the Communist leaders that 
led to the San Fan movement in his book The Prospects  
for Commu.nist China: 
"First, they desired to eliminate as many of the ex-KMT 
and other collaborators of doubtful Communist sympathy 
as they could afford to dispense with, given the rate at 
which adequate new cadres were coming forward.

"Second the top leadership wished to assert its over-
riding authority against the burgeoning bureaucracy and 
thus prevent the development of the notion that the bureau-
cracy could proceed i.n safety to gather to itself comfortable 
areas of authority." 
"Third., the 3-Anti Movement was used as an occasion to 
reassert the unity of the Communist Party as a whole." 
2) Wu Fan (5-Anti Movement) 1951-52: 
The Wu Fan campaign was ostensibly launched against the 
commercial evils of bribery, tax evasion, fraud, theft of 
state assets, and leakage of state economic secrets. In 
effect it was an attack on the residual middle classes who 
were prepared to work with the Communists under the new 
system. Intellectuals were con sidered "petty bourgeoisie" 
socially at that time and, while the main attack was directed 
at the national bourgeoisie, the intellectuals were also intimidated. 
3) As a result of these twons1(_&1_f arty cadres ref2.az_de..d., 
the intellectuals sus iciousl and man intellectuals became  
reluctant to state izmiaions even on rofessional matters. 
) 
Excerpts from a speech to the June 1.956 National People's 
Congress by Lo Lung-chi on intellectuals: 
"During the past few years, as a result of the Three 
and Five Anti's Campaigns, the struggle.to suppress 
counterrevolutionaries and the ideological, reform 
movement, our intellectuals have beyond all, doubt 
greatly raised their ideological levels, and the work 
of uniting with the intellectuals has been strengthened. 
However, certain deviations committed in the course of 
the above-mentioned campaigns have also alarmed and 
frightened a number of veteran intellectuals. In some 
extreme cases, a number of high-level intellectuals, 
because of thei.r lack of correct understanding of the 
policy of the Communist Party, erroneously took the 
personal. deviational practice of a number of individual 
Party members as the policy of the Party as a whole. 
This erroneous view has led intellectuals to become 
alarmed and worried. They have preferred to talk as 
little as possible because they were afraid. On the 
other hand, they have also preferred to steer clear of 
all Communist Party members in life. Because of this 
misunderstanding the potential power of a number of high-
level intellectuals has not yet been developed today. This 
is a proven fact."

(b)Article in.  Clileh-fan4 Jih-pao, Shanghai, Z4 February 1956. 
"Many cadres look askance at the intelligentsia and 
fail to utilize them in national constuction. They 
take the attitude that members of the intelligentsia 
served former regimes and were mostly members 
of the reactionary class which traditionally kept 
Itself aloof from the proletariat. " 
4) Intellectuals in a..,11 professions 1/*!(,ere forced to tinder- o 
reform, and even the science,s were considered to have  ideolni-
cal orientations: 
Report on the Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry Department 
of the Academia Sinica by Wu Yu-hsun, chairman. July 1955. 
"At present a violent, ideological criticism movement is 
In progress. Persons in the fields of mathematics, chemistry, 
physics, and astronomy, have been exposed in the past to 
Idealist influences; we have to condemn these remnants of 
bourgeois idealism which hinder the development of science." 
b. Present 
1) Intimidation of the intellectuals has eased up and a strive 
15.3 their confidence and su2Rort is noN;_(_ro ress. 
Chou En-lai started the current drive to curry favor with high-
level intellectuals in January 1956 in two reports delivered by 
him to the Second Plenary Session of the Second CPPCC National 
Committee. The reports both contain the following three principles: 
(a) Improve the utilization and treatment of intellectual0; 
(b) Trust and support intellectuals to the extent they deserve; 
,(c) Provide the: intellectuals with necessary working conditions 
and suitable pay. 
2) These principles and Maols policy of "let all flowers bloom" were 
restated by Lu Ting-i, CCP Central Committee propaganda director, 
In a speech to CPR scientists on 26 May. He countered the stand 
taken by Wu Yu-hsun in July 1955 by stating: 
."Natural sciences., includin  medicine,  have no class character. 
They have their own laws of development. Their relations with 
social systems is only that under bad social systems these

can develop quickly. These are questions which have 
already been solved theoretically. Therefore, it is 
erroneous to attach class labels such as ?feudal', 
'capitalist', 'socialist', 'proletarian', or 'bourgeois' 
to certain medical theories, or theories of biology or 
other natural sciences." (Reference seems directed 
toward the Pavlov and Lysenko cases specifically.)

is enforced, the pay for intellectuals, particularly scientists 
and technicians, will, be increased to a greater extent than 
others." 
"The high-level intellectuals were kept too busy and were 
asked to do a great variety of work. Since the Government 
announced its policy of guaranteeing the intellectuals at 
least five-sixths of their 'working days for academic work... 
more than three-fourths of the professors and scientists in 
Peking have solved their problems concerning the shortage 
of time."

writers, and artists who fulfill the requirements of party 
membership should be brought into the ranks of the party." 
) Li Wel-han, head of United Front Work Department, to the NPC: 
"So far as the intellectuals are concerned, the purpose of educa-
tion and study is to help them to continue self-reform, so they can 
gradually adapt their ideology to their changed, and changing 
social. statu.s." 
"As the majority of the intellectuals have become a part of the 
working class, what is involved on the whole is a relationship 
within the working class., Therefore, the Communist Party 
members should in general establish Socialist relationships

of mutual aid and cooperation with non-Communist 
Party people. Their contradictions and differences 
should be dealt with in a spirit of comradeship." 
"The main question here is first that Communist 
Party members must be required to place full 
co.nfidence in non-Communist Party persons, 
seeing to it that they have the authority of their 
positions and helping them to carry out their 
functions and responsibilities to the fullest extent." 
c. Necessity_fhange 
1) At a meeting of the CCP Central Committee in January 1956 
Chou En-lai set the next twelve years as the time necessary 
for China to overtake the rest of the world technically. A 
Planning Committee for Scientific Development was inaugurated 
On 14 March 1956 to strengthen the leadership in planning for 
the development of research. The chairman of this committee 
is Chen I and the vice-chart-nen are Li Fu-chlun, Kuo Mo-jo, 
Po I-po and Li Ssu-kuang. The rank of these officials indicates 
the importance with -which this project is regarded. 
2) A policy change toward intellectuals i.s a very important step 
in striving for the 12 year goal since, the intellectuals, as Lo 
Lung-chi admits, have become "alarmed and worried" and 
have "preferred to talk as little as possible because they were 
afraid." 
3) Bullying of the intellectuals by the party cadre is also a serious 
hindrance to scientific progress. Li Wei-han, head of the United 
Front Work Department, told the NPC of the following shortcomings 
and faults of "certain Communist Party members": 
"Not respecting the position and authority of non-Communist 
Party people and not supporting non-Party people in the 
carrying out of their functions and powers; brushin.g others. 
aside and making arbitrary decisions, reluctance to consult 
non-Party people in doing things, intolerance of different 
opinions and opposing opinions., forcing their will on other 
people, to say nothing of not learning from the strong points 
of other people." 
4. Context and pelmective 
It is 212Earent that the Communist leadership greatly needs the 
creative power of the intellectuals and is co nizant of the necessity 
for persuading th.e intellIgentsla to use their  abilities rather than

frightening them into it. The policy of "let all, schools of 
thought contend" must again be considered a misleading one, 
however, as it apparently nnean.smix_. th2se schools of thought 
within the Marxist-Leninist framework are qualified  to compete. 
Mao Tun, in an article in the People's Daily 13 July 1956, said: 
We hope that the academic workers who do enter into 
cornp-etition and discussion will show ,sound reasoning, a 
sense of responsibility and a practical approach, and will 
not contradict universally recognized truths." 
"I do not approve of setting various limits and. drawing up 
regulations, such as the notion that we will compete better 
and discuss better if our discussions contribute to the 
strengthening of theories of Marxism-Leninism. It is not 
.....:Eteill22.12smstion but. that Marxism-
Leninism guides our ideol.og so wh ion iLm as a limitation 
(Emphasis added) 
2) But how can the CCP be sure that all discussions will be within' the 
Marxist,Leninist framework? Li Wei-han answers that: 
? 
"The over.vthelmiag majority of intellectuals are now govern-
ment workers." 
The intellectuals are thus directly controlled by the government 
and heresy can be Stamped out. A measure of relaXation in th.e 
control of subject matter is not dangerous in these conations, yet 
the policy of contention, as interpreted by Lo Lungt-chi, is a very. 
limited relaxation: 
"The policy of contention in the era of Socialism and collectivism 
aims at contention among the people for a common goal, toward a 
common direction, and for a common future. Let us take music 
by way of illustration. Contention in the era of Socialism and 
collectivism will be like music produced by a great orchestra. 
The pianist, the flute player, and the gong and drum player in 
the orchestra must each have his own specialized training. They 
must be able to coordinate for the benefit of all. The artistic level 
of an orchestra is a combination of the advancement of the specialized 
training of each member. The orchestra should encourage each 
member to advance in his own field of training and must not over-
look the talent of any of its members. Performances must be 
given according to the types of music in which the people are 
interested.... The orchestra must give its performances under 
good organization, leadership, and conductorship. Only in this 
way will the music be in harmony."

narrow interpretation of the policy was recognized 
immediately as a death blow to any initiative that might 
be aroused by the new policy. The People's Daily on 
20 July took pains to renounce this interpretation: 
"To 'contend' is not to sing in unison or in chorus. 
Debates and arguments, even nonconformity, are bound 
to appear. All 'schools should create their own music, 
not merely play the music as designated by the director 
of an orchestra. So long as the music is not counter-
revolutionary, they are entitled to the freedom to "contend'," 
Though it is possible that Lo sincerely misunderstood that 
policy, it seems more likely that his error was in choice of 
a metaphor which stated the actual policy too baldly thereby 
spoiling the intended effect. 
B. NATIONAL BOURGEOISIE 
1. Past policy 
a. 1951-5Z: Wu Fan (5-anti movement)  
The Wu Fan mass movement in 1951-52 was a mobilization of class 
feeling directed primarily against the national bourgeoisie or merchants 
and manufacturers. W. W. Rostow describes the technique employed 
as follows: 
"The development of evidence against them was encouraged by 
open and secret denunciations. The cadres then moved in and 
ruled on the extent to which individuals had or had not committed 
one of the five sins (bribary, tax evasion, fraud, theft of state 
assets, and leakage of state economic secrets.) The extent of 
guilt was assessed both morally and in terms of a fine. The 
final stage involved payment of the fine and a decision on future 
status. Then committees were set up to restore 'normal' busi-
ness conditions under increased surveillance and control by the 
state." 
"The 5-Anti Movement signaled an end to the regime's uneasy 
tolerance of those middle-class elements prepared to work with 
them in the New Democracy. Many alleged offenders were sent 
off to labor camps; others fled or committed suicide. Those who 
remained found themselves not only virtually without cash reserves 
but permanently reduced to the status of virtual civil servants 
under government control,." The Prospects for Communist China,

b. The Five Year Plan. Report by Li Fu-chun, Chairman of the State 
Planning Commission, submitted to the second meeting of the 
First National People's Congress, July 5-6, 1955: 
"It is estimated that in the first Five Year Plan period the 
following achievements shall be scored in the transformation 
of private industry and commerce, namely: (1) The major 
part of /old fashioned/ private industrial enterprises shall 
be transformed into various forms of state-capitalist economy 
(including two forms lower than joint state-private ownership - ed.), 
while (2) the major part of modern/sic/ private industrial enter-
prises shall be transformed into the higher form of state-capitalist 
economy --joint state-private ownership; (3) over half of private com-
mercial enterprises shall be transformed into (a) various forms of 
state-capitalist commercial enterprises or (b) into, small coopera-
tive commercial concerns organized by small traders and pedlars." 
c. "High tide of socialist transformation" of the private 
sector of the economy. NCNA February 2, 1956: 
"Members of industrial and commercial circles in all places 
have proposed the slogan of 'catch up with the Capital /Pekinz/ 
and march, toward Socialism'. The leadership organs at various 
places have extended the experience of Peking and rapidly pushed 
the movement to a high tide. Within 11 days after the approval 
of changeover of all private industry and commerce into joint 
enterprise, that is between January 10 and 20, an unprecedented 
high tide in Socialist transformation reached all the major 
municipalities throughout the nation. In these 11 days, all 
private industry and commerce were changed over to joint 
ownership in Sian, Tientsin, Shenyang, Chungking, Shanghai, 
Wuhan, Canton and other large municipalities." 
The changeover from private to joint State-private ownership meant the 
passing of control of the businesses from the owner to cadres assigned 
by the State. These State cadres began immediately to amalgamate 
enterprises without waiting for detailed directions from the State 
Council. In many cases the amalgamations were so uneconomical that 
the State Council, on February 8, passed a ruling that no more changes 
in corporate structure or method of operation should take place for a 
six month period. From January until the present, therefore, the State-
private enterprises have operated under cadre control but without being 
integrated into the public sector of the economy. The former owners and 
managers remained in managerial positions but in most cases decisions 
were made by the State representatives on the management staff.

"Education. through persuasion. " 
a. Mass movements and intimidation are ostensibly not to be em_ployed 
in dealing  with the national bourgeois i! in the c.o._211: 
Li Wei-han, head of the United Front Work Department, CCP, told 
the June 1956 National People's Congress: 
"Since changes have occurred in the class relations, in the 
forms in. which class contradictions and class struggle are 
expressed, the situation henceforth will be more favorable 
for using persuasion as the principal method in dealing with 
class contradictions and class struggle. The method of per-
suasion referred to here is the method. of reasoning, of 
emulation, of criticism and self-criticism and encourage-
ment coupled with criticism. Since education through per-
suasion is the principal method in dealing with class con-
tradictions and the class struggle, educating and studying 
thus become the central task. Education and study should 
be carried out mainly in two ways: Learning from actual 
practice in work and vocational pursuits on the one hand, 
and from political and theoretical studies on the other hand." 
"To meet the demand for political and theoretical studies on 
the part of democratic personages of all circles, industrialists, 
and businessmen, the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference published on March 27, 1956, 
a decision on organizing democratic personages of all circles, 
industrialists and businessmen for political and theoretical 
studies. The guiding principle of education as laid down by 
the decision just mentioned include the following: 
a) Participation in the studies program Is on a voluntary 
basis; 
b) Teaching methods must provide for free examination of 
questions and free debate; 
c) No investigation is to be made into the past history of the 
ideology of those who participate; 
d) As regards the conditions of study, non-Party people and 
Party members are to be treated on the same footing. " 
b. On relations between Communist Party members and the national 
bourgeoisie Li Wei-han continued:

uThi.s relationship arose in large part in the course of the high 
tide of Socialist transformation. It is a new relationship, the 
establishment of which reflects the fundamental change in th.e 
original capitalist relations of production in those enterprises 
and the gradual transition of the bourgeoisie elements toward 
becoming working people. But the change has not yet been 
completed, and the transition, so far as a great majority of 
people are concerned, is only a first step. This type of 
working relations is, therefore, simultaneously a relation of 
classes, It is of vital political importance to deal with this 
relation correctly. There should be a common viewpoint on 
this question among workers, Communist Party members and 
representatives of private interests in these enterprises: That 
Is, the enter 3_ e the principal center in 12:1-1ELths....9pLitals 
h!rrresentatives can be further united, educated and 
reformed (emphasis added), The capitalists and their representa-
tives have long experience in industry and commerce, the most 
convenient path they can take to gradually transform themselves 
into genuine working people is to continue to work and learn in 
their enterprises." 
c. On treatment of the national bourgeoisie in the joint enterprises Li said: 
'Capitalist representatives should be given a place in the structure of 
democratic management in the enterprises, and the division of work 
and responsibility, they must be given the authority of their positions. 
In the course of work, we must place confidence in them according to 
their deserts and bring their special abilities into full play. They 
should be awarded and commended without descrimination for their 
achievements and positive role. They should be helped in the spirit 
of good will to acknowledge and correct their defects and mistakes. 
In doing this work, representatives of Government shares and Com-
munist Party members should pay attention to seeking the help of 
the Association of Industrialists and Businessmen and the China 
Den. ocratic National Construction Association." 
3, Necessi.t'c 
During the "high tide of socialism's in January, so many private 
companies came under state management the Communists were unable 
to handle the problem of integrating them into the public sector of the 
economy. State production, distribution and reorganization plans for 
these enterprises had not been completed. Eager cadres assigned as 
State representatives on the management staffs of the industries never-
theless tried to proceed with amalgamations and operational changes on 
the local level, Economic confusion resulted and the State Council was

forced to halt all amalgamations for at least six months in order to 
complete plans for the necessary reorganizations. It now appears that 
the plans have still not been completed in all cases and that the former 
capitalists are to be asked to help the Communists integrate their 
businesses into the public economy. 
a. Cli'en Yun speech on socialist transformation for private industry 
to the June 1956 National People's Congress: 
As a result of so quick a change illdays?1 / many departments 
and many areas had no time to accumulate experience of bringing 
the enterprises of whole trades under joint State-private operation. 
Consequently, in the days when cymbals and drums were struck 
to celebrate the transformation, quite a few factories, handicraft 
shops, stores and transport establishments in many places were 
merged one after another. Among these, there were some that 
should not have merged, and some that could be merged but 
became too big in their combined size. In short, too many of 
such enterprises were amalgamated and the unit whose profits 
and losses should be calculated together grew too big. This 
blind tendency of amalgamation was stopped by a decision of 
the State Council on February 8. " 
"It is our opinion that the reorganization of enterprises cannot 
be done hastily; there must be adequate preparation. The decision 
of the State Council not to make any change for six months stopped 
certain confusions at the time and afforded the departments in 
charge the time to study and gain experiences and find measures 
for the reorganization of enterprises. However, this does not imply 
that after the six months, reorganization can be carried out in all 
the trades. No, the reorganization of all the industrial, handicraft, 
commercial, and transport undertakings should not be subjected to 
a time limit, it must be done with adequate preparation, through a 
step by step transformation of the respective trades in groups and 
by stages, linked with the arrangements for production and in 
conditions favorable to production." 
b. Li Wei-han at the June 1956 National People's Congress: 
Capitalist representatives should be given a place in the 
structure of democratic management in the enterprises, and 
in the division of work and responsibility, they must be given 
the authority of their positions. They must also have a part 
to play in the reorganization and the transformation of the 
enterprises, and in the movement of socialist emulation."

c. Relations between national bourgeoisie and state and party 
cadres in the joint enterprises have been poor and have been 
reflected in production. 
Chen Yun at the June 1956 National People's Congress: 
"Since the national changeover of capitalist industry and com-
n-ierces to joint State-private enterprises, the question of 
satisfactory cooperation between representatives of the state 
and private interests has become a big one in many such 
enterprises, affecting their production and management." 
4. Context and perspective 
The merchants and industrialists, like the intelligentsia, command 
knowledge and experience essential to the rapid economic progress 
of China. Both classes have in the past been subjected to a reign 
of terror; thought reform for the intellectuals and five-anti campaign 
for the national bourgeoisie. After being thoroughly intimidated these 
two groups were incorporated into the state system. 
Li Wei-han at the June 1956 National People's Congress: 
The overmheiming majority of intellectuals are now government 
workers..... A great majority of capitalists and their agents are 
beginning to become public service personnel of joint State-private 
enterprises and in some cases State-owned enterprises." 
'Vice Premier Chen Yun boasted at the National People's Congress that 
11except for a few border areas, all capitalist industry and commerce 
has now come under joint State-private ownership.... It is not the 
first time in the world that private ownership has been changed to 
Socialist ownership, but its transformation by so peaceful a way 
with industrialists and traders throughout the country accepting 
the transformation in such high spirits, is an event unprecedented 
in history." 
Li Wei-han provides the explanation of the peaceful transformation; the 
bourgeosie were so intimidated by the five-anti movement that they rushed 
into joint enterprises to avoid a recurrence of the terror: 
It is well known that because of these ;five evils), the working class, 
under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Govern-
ment, carried out the historic struggle of Wu Fan which educated not 
only the mass of workers and Government functionaries, but also the

NEW 
bourgeoisie. By this  struggle, the bourgeoisie was enabled to  
1211 a profound understandin of the dan er of their "five evils" 
to the Motherland and the people and of the necessity of acceptinL 
the leadership of the working class and embarking on the road of 
socialism. It is precisely for this reason that it has become 
possible to adopt a more moderate form of Socialist transforma-
tion today." 
This incorporation of the commercial and industrial class into 
state enterprises established direct channels for Communist Party 
control over these individuals. The intellectuals are now functionaries 
in the state bureaucracy and controlled closely by CCP members in 
leading positions. The national bourgeoisie are now organized in joint 
enterprises. These joint enterprises are not used solely for business 
purposes, they are also?and perhaps most importantly?organizations 
for education and control of the bourgeoisie. 
Li Wei-han at the June 1956 National People's Congress: 
"As the Chinese Commuaist Party plays the leading role in State 
affairs, the relations of working together within Government organs, 
schools, and enterprises are mainly the relations between the Com-
munist Party members and non-Communist Party people. In these 
relations, the Communist Party members should take the initiative 
and shoulder the main responsibility, while non-Communist Party 
persons also have their responsibility." 
"The enterprises are the principal center in which the capitalists 
and their representatives can be further united, educated and 
reformed." 
Although the broad reasons for transforming the economy from private 
enterprise to socialism are to some extent economic, the decision to 
speed up the process from a two year period to one month was apparently 
motivated by other factors. No overall plan had been formulated for 
integrating the large number of new joint enterprises into the public 
sector of the economy. The "blind"arnalgarria.tions and the almost im-
mediate decision of the State Council to delay any changes in organization 
of enterprises for six months testify to that. The wage policy followed in 
the new joint enterprises increases the expenses of the enterprises. Wages 
of cadres superimposed on the operating enterprises also added to their 
overhead. The speed-up in socialization of these enterprises was probably 
carried out in order to increase control over the national bourgeoisie. 
Thus the Communist regime recognized that the cooperation of the skilled 
businessmen is essential in building a strong state but were unwilling to

relax their intimidation of these people until direct lines of control 
over them were established, The current policy, regarding the 
national bourgeoisie, which appears liberal on the surface, is 
therefore an attempt to coax cooperation from the national bourgeoisie 
while maintaining complete control over their actions. 
C. PEASANTS  
1, Past Polisir 
a. The Five Year Plan 
Submitted to the Second Meeting of the First National People's 
Congress, July 5-6,1955, by Li Fu-chun, Chairman of the State 
Planning Commission: 
"By 1957, the peasant households joining the present 
elementary forms of agricultural producers cooperatives 
will make up about a third of all the country's peasant 
households." 
"Under the present conditions, the agricultural producers' 
cooperative represents a means for increasing agricultural 
output that involves small investment and yields good results 
in a short space of time. It is also a step necessary to lead 
the peasants to Socialism. To move gradually from th,s 
elementary form of cooperation with initial technical improve-
ments to a higher form of cooperation with mechanization of 
agriculture and other technical reforms is the way leading to 
the uninterrupted development of China's agricultural pro-
duction. " 
"in our work, we must resolutely abide by the principle of 
the voluntary desire of the masses and that of mutual benefits." 
This schedule called for one third of the peasants in elementary 
forms of coops by 1957--a relatively slow rate of change. The 
justification for the change was the necessity to increase production. 
b. Mao Tse-tung himself accelerated this pace. July 31, 1955, speech 
at the Conference of Party Secretaries: 
"The Party Center decision in the spring of 1955 to attain one 
million agricultural cooperatives means only an increase of 
350,000 over the existing 650,000. I think this is a bit on the 
low side. Ma be it is needed to double the figure, that is, to

Approved Far Release : CIA-RDP78-00915Rt1,0500190002-4 
increase to 1, 300, 000 cooperatives. " 
"By the spring of 1958, there will be around 250 million of 
our population, or around 55 million peasant households, 
who will have joined the semi-socialist agricultural coopera-
tives, and they will constitute one half of the total of our 
rural population... We plan in 1960 to basically complete the 
semi-socialist transformation of the agricultural economy 
among the remaining half of the population. " 
c. October 4-11 1955, Resolution of the th Plenum of the 7th CPP Central 
Committee: 
"In places where the development of mutual aid and cooperativiza-
tion is comparatively advanced, and where cooperativization by the 
summer of 1955 had grown to 30-40 percent of the total. number of 
local peasant households, by the spring of 1957 70-80 percent of all 
the local peasant households should have joined agricultural coopera-
tives. In other words, cooperativization of a semi-socialist character 
will be basically achieved. In the majority of areas, agricultural 
cooperativization included approximately 10-20 percent of all peasant 
households in the spring of 1955. Semi-socialist cooperativization on 
the whole will be accomplished in these areas before the spring of 
1958. " 
Between July and October 1955 the goals changed from one third in 1957 
to four fifths in 1957. 
d. December 17, 1955, New China News Agency announced the existence 
of 1, 397, 000 cooperatives and the prospect of nation-wide basic comple-
tion. in the autumn. of 1956. 
e. June 19, 1956, Teng Tzu-hui, Director of the Seventh Office of the State 
Council, at the National. People's Congress: 
"By now, over 108 million peasant households have joined agricultural 
cooperatives, making up 90. 4 percent of all peasant households in 
China; of these 73 million or 6L 1 percent of all peasant households are 
in higher stage cooperatives, and 35 million or 29. 3 percent of all 
peasant households are in elementary cooperatives. Therefore, on 
the whole, cooperativization has been attained in agriculture, basically 
transforming the small peasant economy." 
The constant revision of the goal upward resulted in a drive that col-
lectivized. 75% of the households between the 1955 harvest and the 1956

planting period. This movement occupied the peasants during the 
time they usually participate in sideline production to supplement 
their incomes, and with the households already collectivized, ?brought 
the total member of households in cooperation to 90%, itself an excess 
of the October 1955 goal, Of these, 60% of all peasant housenolds are 
in laigh_a_, level cooperatives, quite a contrast from the modest goal 
of July 1955 of one third in elementary cooperatives next year, 
2. Present Policy 
"Increase the income of 90% of the cooperative members." "Overcome 
the tendency to lay ofe.sided stress on collective and national interests 
while overlooking the interests of the individual." 
a. In planning the "socialist high tide" in collectivization the top leaders 
as su.med that labor was almost wholly idle during the winter and could 
be mobilized with little economic strain. Official doctrine swung to 
the other extreme by May and it was claimed that sideline occupations, 
many of Which are pursued during the winter, contribute one-third of 
the peasants' aggregate income. (People's Daily, 20 May 1.956). The 
officials began to recognize that the collectivization procedures and 
labor mobilization for "capital projects" in the new collectives might 
increase the production of major crops, but would also lower the peasant 
income in two ways: first, it takes the peasants away from sideline 
production and thus leaves them without funds to tide over until the 
harvest is in and the distribution completed; second, the investments 
necessary in a number of capital projects involve depletion of coopera-
tive funds, or payment of interest for loans, which in many cases be-
came so large in relation to total cooperative income that:, even with 
an increase in total production, cooperatives face a possible decline 
in in.dividual income, 
b. Individual income was considered of secondary importance as late 
as mid-March 1956. An article in als_ns7._ai Hsueh. Hsi on 13 March 
declared "Only when collective interest is taken care of first will 
It be possible for us to take care of individual interest." Provincial 
authorities criticized "blind development of sideline production" as 
late as April. 
c. During April the press began to be concerned with the extent of non-
productive capital investments in the cooperatives. Teng Tzu.-hui, 
director of the Rural Work Department of the CCP, recognized the 
problem in a speech recommending means for guaranteeing pro-
duction and increasing individual income. Teng also warned against 
too high a concentration on principal crops alone. On 12 May the

areas, "one of whose main causes is the decline in sideline 
production". Since then. the People's Daily has admitted that 
the one universal worry of the peasantry is reduction in income, 
that "peasants minds can hardly become steady right away", 
and that the failure to take care of sideline production was a 
result of inexperience in administering the collectives. 
d. The policy change was best expressed by Liao Lu-yen, Minister 
of Agriculture, in his June 15th explanation of the new Draft 
Regulations for High State Cooperatives: 
"The central, key point at present in order to consolidate 
and develop the... cooperatives is correct handling of the 
relationship between the individual and the collective, over-
coming the tendency to lay one-sided stress on collective 
and national interests while overlooking the interests of 
the individual." 
e. The gravity of the problem is demonstrated by the measures 
proposed in May by Teng Tzu-hui to combat it: 
(1) 
Treat individual income as a major policy question, 
rather than as ancillary to production. 
(Z) Cut all non-productive expenditure and plan to build 
cultural. and health facilities only gradually?stop 
attempting to "reach heaven with one step". 
(3) Set limits on the public expenditure of money. Production 
Lees, should be kept to 15-20% of annual income, reserve 
and welfare fund S should generally be less than 8% of annual. 
income. (Earlier instructions in Kwangsi said 15% was 
advisable). 
(4) The proportion of total annual production divided as shares 
to the membership must be 60-70%. 
Teng said that under these programs, 90% of cooperative members 
can increase their income this year over last. 
f. Teng Tzu-hui, Director of the Seventh Office of the State Council 
(Agriculture), at the National People's Congress: 
"This years wheat harvest will be followed by the first 
distribution of agricultural income since the development of 
cooperation on a massive scale. This distribution must insure

that 90 percent of the cooperative members increase their 
income while the income of the remaining members should 
be the same as before. Only in this way can the enthusiasm 
of the peasantry for production be brought into full play and 
the cooperative be consolidated." 
Thug Tzu-hui points out many faults in the program of rapid 
collectivization yet indicates that it will be resumed following 
the fall harvest. 
"Another upsurge is expected this winter and next spring when 
higher stage cooperation will spread to most provinces in the 
country." 
Liao Lu-yen, Minister of Agriculture, at the June 1956 National 
People's Congress: 
"The central key point at present in the further consolidation 
and. development of the agricultural producer cooperative is 
the correct handling of the relationship between the individual 
cooperative members and the collective; correct coordination 
between the interests of the individual cooperative member and 
those of the collective. The tendency to overemphasize the 
interests of the collective and the state and to neglect the 
interests of individual cooperative members should be eliminated. 
h. Liao further states that the 
easants should receive an increase in 
ncome even if 
roduction is not increased after collectivization: 
"If the production of cooperatives does not increase rapidly, 
the cooperative can reduce the amount of sinking funds for the 
purpose of increa sing the income of ea ch individual member. 
This regulation is very necessary for ensuring the adequate 
coordination of collective and individual Interests, and will 
undoubtably elevate the member& enthusiasm further and 
contribute to the development of the cooperatives." 
Necessity for change  
a. The necessity for raising the income and. living conditions of the 
peasants is stated by Teng Tzu-hui as follows: 
"A too rapid and too great increase in public funds, clisre-
garding the production growth of the cooperative and the present 
living conditions of the individual members, and the expense of 
the members income, would necessarily undermine the corn-

Approved FewRelease : CIA-RDP78-00915R0N1500190002-4 
munity of interests of the individual and the collective. Con-
sequently, it would be impossible to consolidate the cooperative. 
Only when the public funds are suitably accumulated on the basis 
of adequately increasing the income of the membership can the 
membership become more keenly interested in the interests of 
the collective and work more energetically. In this way, not 
only will the cooperatives be consolidated, but more public 
property can be accumulated more quickly. ss 
The socialist "upsurge" predicted by Teng for next winter and spring 
will be more readily carried out if it can be demonstrated to the peasants 
that material benefits will be theirs in the higher stage cooperatives. 
b. This projected'hocialist upsurge's into the higher stage cooperative is 
significant in the light of what Li Fu-chun said just one year ago when 
presenting the Five Year Plan: 
"To move gradually from this elementary form of cooperation 
with initial technical improvements to a higher form of coopera-
tion with mechanization of agriculture and other technical reforms 
is the way leading to the uninterrupted development of Chinas 
agricultural, production." 
c. The difference between elementary agricultural producers cooperatives 
and higher stage producer cooperatives as ,stated by Liao Lu-yen: 
"The elementary agricultural producer cooperatives pooled the 
land as shares under centralized management on the .basis of 
private ownership while the higher stage cooperatives have full 
collective ownership of the means of production. This is the basic 
difference between the elementary agricultural producer coopera.-
tives and the higher stage agricultural producer cooperatives." 
There is generally another difference between the two types of coopera-
tives. A higher stage cooperative is usually formed by amalgamating 
several of the lower stage cooperatives, and incorporates several 
thousand people. 
The problem of leadership in the cooperatives has been a large one 
in the past. The charge of "middle peasant control of the coopera.tives" 
was common. This meant the cooperatives were refusing to observe 
state quotas, failing to pay taxes and deliberately underreporting 
grain stocks and production. The decision to move rapidly rather 
than gradually from the elementary stage to the higher stage coopera-
tive may be prompted by a shortage of reliable leaders in the rural 
areas.

4. Context and perspective 
a. arithialla_epastea r the peasantry, like the natio 1 b our e o iena 
has been or anized into controllable units b the CCP and the State. 
The basic ppblem again corontighe Chinese leaders is bow to  
get cocperatlon. out of people Arh when the exe undei_y_ich co ietem 
control. The current emphasis on the interests of the peasants has 
strong elements in common with the new policy towards intellectuals 
and national bourgeoisie. The plan for the organization of the peasants 
into easily controlled groups was radically speeded up in the past year 
until nearly the entire segment of the population is now involved. This 
speed-up was generally uneconomical since over-all production and 
distribution plans had. not been finished. The result has "affected the 
economic balance of society and the supply of raw materials for certain 
Industries and handicrafts" according to Teng Tsu-hui, vet the process 
is to be completed as rapidly as possible after the fail cr ops are in. 
Again the establishment of the organization of control over all individuals  
itla.!_shiatm_sslciettslaLL.t2,1.2.222t2o le".....Emps to be the main  
Incentive for the rate of collectivization. A corollary to this is that 
the anti-Communist elements of the society will be isolated and there-
fore ineffective. 
Teng Tzu-hui at the National People's Congress: 
"This consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the stronger 
unity between. poor and middle peasants is also completely isolating 
the former landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and 
other undesirable elements, making it easier for us to peacefully 
transform the rich peasants and all the other exploiting classes." 
b.The elemezil,alLfaran_gfperative, as discussed aI;)ove,pparently 
2,Loved inadequate as a form of or anization for the control of the 
?tsandtheariBltural economyz, This would appear to be the 
explanation for the short time which elapsed before the higher stage 
collectives were imposed on the peasants. 
c. Control of the production by the State and of the peasants by the CCP 
are illustrated by the following two articles or organization of the Huo-yen 
Agricultural Collective located in Hsing-tai Hsien, Hopeh: 
Article 38: All decisions made by the membership meeting must 
be in conformity with the state plans and policies and 
in line with the principles of collective and individual 
Interests.

Article 47: The director of the collective is responsible for the 
overall leadership. He must correctly grasp and 
execute the various party policies and rely on the 
masses to fulfill the production tasks under the 
leadership of the Party. (The articles of organization 
appeared in the Peiping Chung-kuo Nung-pao, 25 March 
1956, pp. 28-30. It was offered as a model for other 
collectives to follow. Although the source is unclassified 
ref erence to it should not be made in widely disseminated 
overt publications.) 
d. oblem now acing the relrne is how to make the peasants 2roduce 
now that they are enclosed in the socialist straightjacket. The Communists 
admit that without a surplus in agricultural production the industrializa-
tion program will fail, and that an agricultural surplus will be possible 
In sufficient quantities only when the peasantry is imbued with "pro-
duction enthusiasm". This "production enthusiasm" is expected to 
result from an across-the-board increase in income. The funds for 
this increase will not come from the state. They are to come from the 
increase in production expected as a direct result of cooperativization. 
If, as is most likely, an insufficient increase in production results from 
cooperativization, the increased incomes are to be financed at the expense 
of the cooperative sinking fund. Since this sinking fund stems from the 
compulsory investment of the individual peasant in the cooperative when 
he joins it, he is in effect getting an increased income at file expense of 
his own capital., or in other words at his awn expense. An increased 
Income from a subsidy by the state would be real; but this increase, 
financed by cooperative funds, decreases the amount of construction 
possible in the future. Thus the state proposes, in effect, to raise the 
income of the peasants by dipping into capital reserves designed to 
finance future operations of the cooperatives or act as a cushion against 
hard times. In other words, the peasant's 1956 income is to be raised 
at the expense of his future standard of living, and at the expense of 
sound financial management of the cooperatives. 
D. NATIONAL "DEMOCRATIC" PARTIES IN THE 'PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC 
UNITED FRONT" 
Past Policy 
a. Under the Organic Law governing the CPPCC, parties and organiza-
tions eligible for recognition as political entities in. Communist China 
must have first agreed to a statement of principles which was essentially 
a statement of the short term goals of the CCP. 
26

The Organic Law of Chinese People's Political Ccinsultative Conference 
(CPPCC) 27 September 1949: 
"Article 1. The CPPCC is the organization of the democratic 
united front of the people throughout China. Its aim is the 
,liix_Ls of all democratic classes and nationalities through-
out China through the unity of all democratic parties and 
groups and people's organizations, to exert joint efforts in 
carrying out New Democracy, etc....to establish and con-
solidate.. the Chinese Peoplets Republic of the People's 
Democratic Dictatorship led by the working class and based 
on the alliance of workers and peasants." 
"Article Z. Democratic parties and groups and peoples 
organizations which agree to Article 1 of this Organic Law 
may take part in the CPPCC after being approved by the 
National Committee of the CPPCC through consultation." 
b. These parties accepted entirely the leadership of the CCP and 
served merely as links to the sections of the populace that were 
least in contact with the CCP, which was ostensibly a workers and 
peasants party. 
Joint declaration in May 1950 by the democratic parties: 
We, the democratic parties of China, are unconditionally 
united under the leadership of the great Communist Party 
and Chairman Mao Tse-tung for the building of an independent, 
free, democratic, united and prosperous China." 
c. In practice, despite an occasional show of formalities, the democratic 
parties were completely Rppei parties without real function. Li Wei-han 
at the 1956 meeting of the NPC admits this: 
"Some say: In the Communist Party there are those who 
do not take democratic parties seriously, while in the demo-
cratic parties themselves there are also those who do not 
take democratic parties seriously'. This is not, II believe, 
merely a matter of the viewpoint of certain people but is a 
reflection of a social phenomenon. " 
d. This is an authoritative admission that the Communists have con-
sidered the democratic non-partisans of no real importance in the 
political scheme of things, an attitude which has not been without 
influence on the democratic personages themselves.

2. PreAppriftffiftweRelease : CIA-RDP78-00915R0W500190002-4 
a. Li Wei-han at the June 1956 National PeopleIs Congress: 
"Democratic parties play an important role not only in mili22..g. 
and mobilizing (rallying) all positive forces but also in mutual 
su_ze.za_rision. The Central Committee of the CCP has put forward 
the policy that the Chinese Communist Party should coexist with 
democratic parties over a long period of time, and that there 
should be mutual supervision and first of all supervision over 
the Chinese Communist Party. This is a momentous policy. " 
"We must have strict respect for the political freedom and 
independence of organization enjoyed by the democratic parties 
and peoplels organizations within the framework of the rights 
and obligations laid down by the constitution. No party or 
organization has the right to interfere in this freedom and 
independence enjoyed by other parties or organizations." 
"The task before us is to continue to consolidate and expand 
the Peoples Democratic United Front, unite together all 
possible forces, and strive for our common target." 
b. NCNA report on CCP United Front Work Conference held July 2-4, 1956: 
"At the conference, Li Wei-han stated that it was a mistake for 
some to think that following the victory of the Socialist transforma-
tion the democratic parties would not be needed." 
c. This is a radical change from a situation where no CP cadre took 
the democratic parties seriously to the present policy of "mutual 
supervision" which ostensibly allows these parties to supervise the 
CCP. 
3. Necess ity larchan 
a. The change in the wording of the policy toward democratic parties is 
very slight, but in practice the change may be of some significance. 
The parties may expand their memberships and take a more active 
role in criticising functionaries of the government. 
NCNA report of the United Front Work Conference, July 4: 
"Leaders of local organizations of all parties stressed the need. 
to expand their organizations. They said they needed more full-
time 
officials...Local organizations asked for leading members 
of their parties to be relieved of governmental work to be able 
to concentrate more on building up the parties."

b. This change is prompted by the recognition by the CCP that 
the entire productive population of China must be mobilized 
to meet the twelve year goals set early this year. Since no 
one took the democratic parties seriously, it was necessary 
to find a larger role for them to play. In this way the CCP 
hopes to make a larger share of the people identify their 
interests with those of the State.. 
Mao Tse-tung as quoted by Li Wei-han at the National People's 
Congress: 
"Affairs of state are the public concern of the whole people, 
not the private business of a party or a group /such as the 
CCP/. 
c. Branches of some of the democratic parties are active in Southeast 
Asia. Peking's drive to bring skilled overseas Chinese back to 
the mainland may be more successful if the overseas Chinese can 
be made to think their parties are actually participating in the 
government of the CPR. 
d. A more democratic appearance in Communist China's government 
may be calculated to please the leaders of neutral nations in Seouth 
Asia and the Near East and strengthen her claim to recognition by 
the other countries of the world. 
4. Context and perspective 
a. In discussing the policies on the relations between CCP members 
and other members of the society it was noted that non-Communist 
intellectuals, peasants and national capitalists were gi ven more 
latitude of action only after two conditions had been satisfied: 
1) The groups had demonstrated acceptance of Communist 
ideology and 
2) Organizational controls had been established linking the 
individual and the state either directly or indirectly 
(cooperatives). 
b. Although the organizational controls over the democratic parties 
are not as readily demonstrable as in the other cases, speeches 
by Li Wei-han and leaders of the democratic parties indicate that 
the two conditions were met before the "mutual supervisions" 
aspect of the policy was evolved. Under the Organic Law of the 
CPPCC the parties had to agree to Communist aims but they were 
not considered ideologically oriented in Communism to the point

Approved ar Release : CIA-RDP78-0091511190500190002-4 
where they could be trusted to criticize along "correct" lines. 
Li Wei-han indicates that their leaders have "raised their ideologies" 
in the past seven years: 
"The various democratic parties have accepted Socialism and 
adopted political lines in the service of Socialism. These changes 
reflect the expansion and strengthening of Socialist unanimity, 
both political and ideological, among our whole people. They 
express the further consolidation and expansion of our Peoples 
Democratic United Front. These changes have, moreover, 
created favorable conditions for the continued consolidation 
and expansion of the Peoples Democratic United Front." 
it. The leaders of the democratic parties have issued statements which 
indicate that they recognize their new role in the "expanded" united 
front as one of criticism of government agencies and functionaries 
within the framework of Communist ideology. Their chief function 
will still be to unite as many non-Communist elements of the society 
as possible under the leadership of the Communists. Never will they 
criticize actual policies or the reasons behind policies as political 
parties in the Western sense do as a matter of course. 
NCNA report of the United Front Work Department meeting July 4, 1956: 
"They (leading personages of the democratic parties) unanimously 
expressed the determination to develop positive influence henceforth, 
to unite all circles capable of uniting, and to serve jointly the interests 
of Socialist undertakings. In order to cope with the new situation, they 
were of the opinion that the members of the democratic parties should 
further raise their ideological consciousness, and should further develop 
and consolidate their organizations. They also requested the Com-
munist Party to strengthen its leadership over the democratic parties."
