 Scope Note           This study is a broad historical examination of economic sanctions as an in-
 strument of foreign policy in a variety of political settings. It reviews 14
 cases of economic sanctions covering a representative sample of sanctions
 sponsors, targets, and circumstances. Drawing on the information in these
 case studies as well as on open literature, we have examined each of the ele-

 Economic Sanctions:
 A Historical Analysis
 Economic sanctions, though rarely decisive in forcing
 policy change, are a useful-and increasingly used-
 foreign policy tool. More effective than diplomatic
 protest and less drastic than military action, sanctions
 not only send a strong political message, but also can
 have a significant impact on target countries by
 raising economic costs. The greatest impact typically
 occurs during the first six to 12 months. This is a
 period in which trade is disrupted, financial flows are
 altered, and regimes are forced to deal with disloca-
 tions throughout the economy. In general, countries
 already subject to economic problems tend to be more
 vulnerable to the impact of economic sanctions.F_
 shifted to punishing Cuba and increasing the econom-
 ic costs to the USSR of supporting a client state.
 These costs have amounted to some $40 billion since
 1960.
 Often, the true objectives of sanctions are never
 publicly stated. The announced objective of the
 League of Nations actions against Italy, for example,
 was to end the war in Ethiopia, while the real, but
 unstated, objective was to check Hitler's expansionism
 by demonstrating the effectiveness of the League's
 collective security provisions. Similarly, the unstated
 objectives of the UK sanctions against Rhodesia were
 to prevent the use of force by third countries and to
 maintain a favorable image for the United Kingdom
 The effectiveness of economic sanctions depends, in
 large part, upon the objectives of the sponsoring
 country. While sanctions have traditionally been
 viewed as efforts to change a country's behavior-10
 of our 14 case histories fall into this category-they
 may have less ambitious goals. For example, the Arab
 League has long recognized that its boycott of Israel
 can hurt the Israeli economy but cannot force policy
 change. Similarly, according to Carter administration
 officials, Washington understood that US sanctions
 would not cause the Soviets to withdraw from Af-
 ghanistan; the sanctions were intended to punish the
 USSR and let Moscow know the price for similar
 conduct in the future. In some cases, the objective is
 limited to showing disapproval of the target country's
 actions. This was the case with the European Commu-
 nity (EC) sanctions against Ar entina during the
 Falklands/ Malvinas war.
 Sanctions may also combine the objectives or change
 in their relative emphasis over time. For example, US
 and Organization of American States (OAS) sanctions
 against Cuba were initially meant to bring down the
 Castro regime. As time passed, however, the focus
 in the Commonwealth and the Third World.
 Unstated objectives present policymakers with both
 advantages and problems. On the positive side, unstat-
 ed objectives allow:
 ? Flexibility in determining when sanctions can be
 removed.
 ? An opportunity for the target country to accede to
 the true objectives of the sanctions without publicly
 capitulating.
 There are three principal disadvantages, however, to
 unstated objectives:
 ? A country urging a multilateral group to impose
 sanctions will have a more difficult task if it main-
 tains a private agenda.
 ? Unstated objectives cannot be kept secret in a
 multilateral context, making a public confrontation
 with the target country unavoidable.
 ? Unstated objectives may be more difficult to justify
 in the public opinion of sponsoring countries.

 Establishing and Implementing Sanctions
 We have identified four key elements that are likely
 to affect a decision to implement economic sanctions:
 ? The kinds of items to be withheld or markets to be
 boycotted.
 ? The need for multilateral sponsorship and willing-
 ness of other countries to participate.
 ? The economic and political effects on the target
 country.
 ? The target country's degree of commitment to its
 policies relative to the sponsoring country's commit-
 ment to the sanctions.
 Emphasis on one or another of these elements depends
 on the goals of the sanctions. If the objective is to
 demonstrate disapproval, only the first two are perti-
 nent; punishment, in addition to the first two ele-
 ments, requires assessment of the economic impact;
 an attempt to change the target country's policies
 requires consideration of all four elements.
 The economic impact of sanctions against the target
 country can range from minor inconvenience to major
 dislocation and is affected by:
 ? The target country's access to alternate sources of
 supply or alternate markets for its exports.
 ? The target country's ability to adjust internally.
 ? The s onsorm country's ability to enforce sanc-
 tions.
 In 12 of the 14 cases studied, the target countries
 were eventually able to secure alternate import
 sources and export markets. The alternate sources
 were ideological or strategic foes of the sponsors in the
 cases of Italy, Cuba, and Rhodesia. In the rest of the
 cases, the sources were opportunistic suppliers. Dur-
 ing the short duration of sanctions against the Domin-
 ican Republic, for example, Canada, Western Europe,
 and the Middle East supplied arms, vehicles, and
 petroleum. The EC sanctions against Argentina were
 never seriously intended to deprive Buenos Aires of
 key imports, and alternate supplies of most items were
 available if necessary.
 Target countries may also try to adjust internally to
 sanctions by increasing self-sufficiency and shifting
 demand away from embargoed items. Rhodesia, for
 example, developed an effective manufacturing sector
 in response to sanctions, and white Rhodesians were
 generally able to maintain their standard of living
 during the long sanctions period. In the case of Cuba,
 the shift was from an economy dominated by US
 capital and consumer goods to an economy in which
 capital is supplied by the Communist Bloc and Japan,
 and the supply of consumer goods is substantially
 Despite general availability of alternate supply
 sources and export markets, sanctions can still have
 considerable economic impact. In the cases of China,
 Cuba, and Rhodesia, there was either a timelag
 between the imposition of sanctions and the availabil-
 ity of new sources or a high economic or political cost
 involved in obtaining the new sources. Thus, the
 availability of alternate supplies does not preclude
 successful application of sanctions.
 The political impact of sanctions is difficult to quanti-
 fy, but it is affected by:
 ? The severity of the economic impact.
 ? The distribution of the economic impact among the
 population of the target country.
 ? The ability of the government to maintain its au-
 thority despite the sanctions.
 In general, the greater the ideological commitment of
 the target government and population to the policies
 that triggered the sanctions, the more likely that they
 will bear the cost of sanctions without changing those
 policies. Moreover, national unity and commitment
 are often solidified as a result of sharing hardship
 under the sanctions. One author notes that the theory
 underlying the use of economic sanctions "disregards
 the simple principle of adaptation: that which seems
 unacceptable at the beginning of the conflict becomes
 acceptable as one gets used to life under hardship ...
 value-deprivation creates the social conditions under
 which much more sacrifice is possible so that the limit
 for political disintegration will be reached much

 Secret
 The Chinese, Cuban, and Rhodesian cases are all
 examples of a high degree of commitment:
 ? The Chinese continued their ideological and eco-
 nomic split with Moscow despite the high initial cost
 of Soviet sanctions.
 ? The Cubans not only continued but also intensified
 the conduct that had brought forth the sanctions,
 expanding their efforts to export revolution and
 acting as Soviet surrogates in Africa.
 ? The Rhodesians held firm for almost 15 years,
 eventually giving in to civil war and not to economic
 sanctions.
 The countries imposing sanctions are often less com-
 mitted than the target countries. Commitment by the
 sponsor countries is affected by:
 ? The importance the public attaches to the objectives
 of the sanctions and its willingness to bear the
 economic costs.
 ? The willingness of the government to incur the
 political costs.
 ? The willingness of allies to share both political and
 economic costs.
 In the likely event of problems with any of these
 elements, commitment will be reduced and sanctions
 may not be sustained. This difference in relative
 commitment between the sponsoring country and the
 target country is a major reason for the failure of
 many sanctions programs.
 Given the current degree of international interdepen-
 dence, economic sanctions frequently affect not only
 the target and sponsoring countries but other nations
 as well. The sanctions on Rhodesia, for example, had
 an unintended negative impact on Zambia because of
 disruptions in critical oil supplies and local trade;
 furthermore, they had an unintended positive impact
 on South Africa because Pretoria became a principal
 supplier and transshipper of goods bound for Rhode-
 sia. The economic confrontation between sponsor and
 target can cause dramatic, unforeseen, and unintend-
 ed changes in the latter's foreign policy. The case of
 Soviet sanctions against China provides a clear exam-
 ple of unintended political consequences. Although
 sanctions were intended to reassert Soviet ideological
 Reverse Blank                                        3
 leadership over China, the result was a sharp reduc-
 tion in political leverage as the USSR's participation
 in Chinese development was terminated. The sanc-
 tions were a major reason why China eventually
 turned to the West for technology and capital. Simi-
 larly, US sanctions against Cuba, originally intended
 to force a reorientation of Castro's politics away from
 the Soviet Union, ended with the reorientation of the
 Cuban economy toward the USSR.
 Economic sanctions represent a middle ground be-
 tween diplomatic protest and military actions and, as
 such, they constitute a useful foreign policy tool in a
 variety of situations. Used alone, they are rarely, if
 ever, sufficient to force a major policy change on the
 target country. They can, however, serve to isolate the
 target country, solidify international opinion against
 the target country, and increase the political and
 economic costs to the target country of maintaining
 its policies.

 League of Nations Sanctions
 Against Italy (1935-36)
 Background to the Sanctions
 Immediately following its invasion by Italy in October
 1935, Ethiopia appealed to the Council of the League
 of Nations under provisions of the Leagues's Cove-
 nant, which declared any war or threat of war a
 matter of concern to the whole League. The League
 Council Committee of Six reported that Italy had
 resorted to war in violation of League obligations to
 submit disputes to arbitration or judicial settlement.
 The adoption of this report by the Council was the
 signal for the automatic application of sanctions
 under the provisions of Article 16.1 of the Covenant:
 Should any Member of the League resort to war in
 disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13, or
 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed
 an act of war against all other members of the
 League, which hereby undertake immediately to
 subject it to the severance of all trade or financial
 relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between
 the nations of the covenant-breaking State and the
 nationals of any other State, whether a Member of
 the League or not.
 never adopted; therefore, the scope of the sanctions
 did not include commodities critical to Italy's war
 effort.
 Not only was the scope of sanctions limited, but also
 the League did not have the legal power to enforce
 members' compliance. Furthermore, when the initial
 sanctions were imposed, the 54-nation League did not
 include Germany or the United States, major suppli-
 ers of arms and oil to Italy.
 Objectives of the Sanctions
 The League of Nations sanctions against Italy are a
 good example of a case where the stated and unstated
 objectives differed considerably. The announced ob-
 jective of the League's sanctions was ". . . to make the
 war so costly for Italy that a `reasonable' solution
 could be evolved. The (member) nations were prepared
 to be modest in their definition of their `reasonable'
 aims. Ethiopia, like Czechoslovakia at Munich, was
 expected to do most of the yielding."'
 The sanctions imposed by the League on Italy were
 not nearly as stringent as Article 16 mandated. The
 League adopted four economic sanctions effective 18
 November 1935:
 ? The prohibition of the export of arms, ammunition,
 and implements of war.
 ? An embargo on certain agricultural and key mineral
 exports to Italy.
 ? The prohibition of loans, credits, and some other
 capital flows to public and private entities in Italian
 territory.
 ? An embargo on imports of Italian goods.
 Also in November, the League submitted to member
 governments an additional proposal that extended the
 sanctions to petroleum, iron and steel (including alloy
 steels), and coal and coke. These later measures were
 The publicly stated objective for the League's action
 may not have been paramount in this sanctions case.
 According to several academic studies, the League
 intended the sanctions to inhibit Hitler's expansionist
 plans by demonstrating that the collective security
 concept of the League could work in Europe although
 it had failed in Manchuria. The Italian invasion of
 Ethiopia occurred against a background of rising
 tensions in Europe created by both a resurgent and
 expansionist Germany and Italy's search for its place
 in the sun. The sanctions thus became a principal test
 of the peace enforcement powers of the League of
 Nations

 Given the specific provisions of the sanctions, howev-
 er, the prospects for influencing the behavior of either
 Mussolini or Hitler were not favorable. The two
 principal powers in the League-France and the
 United Kingdom-did not intend the sanctions to
 undermine seriously Italy's warmaking capacity. Al-
 though the Italian war effort was vulnerable to a
 cutoff of strategic materials, the British and the
 French did not want to impose stringent sanctions
 that would push Mussolini too far toward war with
 them or toward alliance with Hitler.' As author
 George W. Baer wrote:
 Much of this was well known to Mussolini. Italian
 diplomacy made excellent use of this desire to avoid
 war. At several critical times the British and French
 turned aside from imposing increasingly harsher
 terms of sanctions in response to threats that Italy
 would assume belligerent rights.'
 Compliance With the Sanctions
 Not only was the scope of the sanctions limited, but
 also the compliance by members and nonmembers
 was incomplete. Four members of the League refused
 to apply any sanctions. The embargo on arms was not
 applied by seven members. Financial restrictions were
 not adopted by eight countries. Finally, 13 countries
 failed to prohibit imports from Italy. One writer has
 noted:
 The belated and partial restrictions adopted did not
 interfere at all seriously with Italy's warmaking
 potential or even with the comfort of her population.
 Italy had been able to build significant stockpiles of
 many essential products in the period from December
 1934 to September 1935, while her intentions grew
 ever clearer. She was able to continue this process for
 at least a month and a half after the invasion, since,
 for coordination purposes, the effective date for many
 sanctions measures was November 18. The failure to
 ban important items, such as petroleum, and the
 failure to cut off shipments of banned items from
 nonmembers and even from members permitted Ital-
 ian industry to function at high levels.4

 and the Italian-Ethiopian War, 1935-1936," International Organi-

 Implications of the Sanctions
 Analysts of the League's sanctions against Italy gen-
 erally conclude that the measures had little, if any,
 impact on the Italian Government's ability to main-
 tain political leadership or on Italy's national unity
 and commitment to continue the war against Ethiopia
 and here written:
 With the measures of control over trade and over the
 economy which were adopted or strengthened, few of
 the hardships envisioned by the advocates of econom-
 ic sanctions were in fact felt by the Italian people.
 Indeed, the buildup and war periods saw a substan-
 tial decline in Italy's unemployment problem. While
 wages rose little or not at all, many families saw
 overall income rise as more members went to work or
 received Army pay.'
 In fact, analysts believe that Mussolini was able to
 turn international opprobrium into a tool for uniting
 the Italian people behind the Fascists in defiance of
 the League.' Whether full application of sanctions
 over a long period of time would have affected
 Mussolini became an academic question after Italy's
 conquest of Ethiopia and the League's failure to
 extend sanctions to the point where concessions would
 have been forthcoming.'
 Results of the Sanctions
 The League of Nations failed to achieve even its
 stated objectives against Italy. Although collective
 action by the League was imposed for six months, the
 sanctions failed to make the war so costly for Italy
 that it would be forced to resolve the conflict by
 negotiation. More important, in the long run, failure
 to apply Article 16 fully, coupled with serious prob-
 lems of implementation of the sanctions because of

 that the League would not be likely to impose collec-
 tive security measures against expansion of the Third
 Reich.'
 Historically, the focus of attention has been on the
 lack of will of the League members to invoke the
 collective security concept of the League to check
 Mussolini and to serve as a demonstration to Hitler.
 However, the fact is that even if Article 16 of the
 Covenant had been fully invoked and even if all
 members of the League had complied with the full
 sanctions, nonmember Germany was willing to pro-
 vide Italy with arms required to continue the war and
 the nonmember United States was willing to provide
 the oil. Furthermore, Ethiopia's inability to resist any
 army equipped with modern weapons, including gas,
 severely limited the time available for even fully
 implemented sanctions to have an impact on Italian
 military operations or to have a significant enough
 impact on the Italian economy to give the political
 leadership pause in its prosecution of the war.
 Failure of the League's sanctions provides a classic
 demonstration of the problems involved in establish-
 ing and implementing effective sanctions through a
 multilateral organization:
 ? The membership of the League did not agree on
 objectives; sanctions were late, limited, and
 incomplete.
 ? The League did not have the power to enforce
 sanctions; therefore, League members violated them
 as their individual national interests required.
 ? The membership of the League did not control the
 supply of goods and services to be withheld by the
 sanctions; therefore, Italy was able to purchase
 essential strategic goods.

 France were loath to take any risks and anxious to avoid any

 Appendix B
 Arab League Boycott of Israel
 (1948-Present)
 Background to the Sanctions
 The Arab boycott of the Jewish community in Pales-
 tine predates the formal establishment of the state of
 Israel in 1948. In December 1945 the Arab League
 Council called on all Arabs "to refuse to deal in,
 distribute, or consume Zionist products or manufac-
 tured goods." Even before the boycott, many Arab
 individuals and groups shunned Jewish businesses in
 Palestine.
 Before 1950 the boycott attempted only to keep
 Israeli goods out of Arab countries. In that year the
 boycott was extended to include third-party shipping
 in an effort to slow trade into and out of Israel. The
 Arab League Council decided that any ship carrying
 military equipment or immigrants to Israel would be
 barred from Arab ports. In the early 1950s the
 Council also recommended extending the boycott to
 foreign firms with branches in Israel.
 The Arab boycott is administered by a Central Boy-
 cott Office (CBO) headquartered in Syria and nation-
 al boycott offices in each Arab country. The sponsor-
 ing Arab League had seven members initially-Syria,
 Trans-Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt,
 and Yemen-but has since grown to 21 active mem-
 bers. Each member of the League appoints a repre-
 sentative to a central boycott committee, which usual-
 ly meets semiannually. The committee recommends
 the addition or deletion of firms to the blacklist, but
 its decisions are not binding. Each Arab country
 decides whether to accept the decisions of the commit-
 tee. Each country, therefore, maintains its own black-
 list, and the various country lists are not uniform.
 Objectives of the Boycott
 The boycott's stated goal is to hinder the economic
 and military growth of Israel. Beyond that, however,
 the boycott serves as a sign of opposition to Israel and
 a useful propaganda device. In a press interview, CBO
 Secretary General Nurallah Nurallah claimed that
 the boycott is "the only effective Arab measure
 against Israel." One scholar has observed that "per-
 haps one of the principal benefits of the boycott
 program, in Arab League eyes, is that it keeps the
 issue of Israel constantly before the Arab people." F
 The Arab League does not distinguish among the
 various types of boycott it administers, but the world
 business community generally differentiates among
 three types of boycott action. The primary boycott
 bans all direct trade between Arab states and Israel,
 and before 1977 was most commonly enforced by a
 negative certificate of origin-a trade document that
 certifies the goods in question were not made in Israel
 and do not contain Israeli-made components. In 1977,
 however, the United States enacted strict antiboycott
 legislation and forbade US firms to supply negative
 certificates. Since then, most Arab states have come
 to accept a positive certificate of origin that indicates
 where the product and its components were manufac-
 tured and the name of the manufacturer.
 The secondary boycott, instituted in the early 1950s,
 bans commerce with companies that contribute signif-
 icantly to Israel's economic or military strength. A
 firm is blacklisted if it:
 ? Has a plant, branch, licensee, or regional agent for
 the Middle East in Israel.
 ? Is a partner in any Israeli company.
 ? Advises Israeli manufacturers.
 ? Acts as agent or principal importer for any Israeli
 firm.
 ? Prospects for natural resources in Israel.
 Although boycott officials periodically insist publicly
 and privately that only firms adding to Israel's
 strength are blacklisted, the contributions of many
 boycotted companies are difficult to discern. The
 Topps Chewing Gum Company, for example, was
 blacklisted after it licensed an Israeli factory to
 produce Bazooka bubble gum.

 Secret
 Firms suspected of proscribed activity in Israel are
 usually confronted with a questionnaire asking if they
 are engaged in forbidden practices. If a firm responds
 positively or refuses to reply to a questionnaire, it may
 be blacklisted. US firms are prohibited from respond-
 ing to boycott questionnaires under the 1977 antiboy-
 cott legislation. The law also requires US companies
 to report the receipt of questionnaires to the US
 Department of Commerce. In late 1979 the deputy
 secretary general of the CBO stated that, since US
 antiboycott laws took effect, 90 percent of all US
 companies blacklisted were boycotted for failing to
 respond to boycott office questionnaires.
 In a form of extended secondary boycott, boycotting
 countries require third-country firms to refuse to use
 products or services of blacklisted companies in fulfill-
 ing a contract or sale to enforcing countries. A clause
 requiring such a refusal sometimes appears as a
 contract condition. This requirement has been labeled
 a tertiary boycott in the United States. It is especially
 prevalent in international banking. As Arab financial
 institutions have come to play an increased role as
 lenders to corporate and government borrowers, some
 borrowers have been pressured to refrain from dealing
 with blacklisted banks or other institutions with al-
 leged "Zionist" connections. Three Arab banks, for
 example, withdrew as comanagers of a $2 billion loan
 for the Mexican state oil company after blacklisted
 banks were included in the management syndicate.?
 Enforcement of the Boycott
 The numerous exceptions made by Arab states to the
 boycott principles detract from the Arab goal of
 preventing certain types of commerce with Israel.
 Some Arab League members have criticized the
 central boycott bureaucracy itself. After the boycott
 committee went through all of 1978 without meeting,
 the League commissioned an investigation of charges
 by some members that the CBO is ineffective. A
 report written by the Arab League's then assistant
 secretary general accused the CBO of inflating its
 The threat of a loss of business in the Arab world is
 the only tool the Arab League has to enforce its
 secondary boycott. Therefore, companies that conduct
 a relatively small share of their business with Arab
 countries are less vulnerable to boycott pressure.C
 Even countries that strictly enforce the boycott have
 overlooked regulations and dealt with blacklisted
 firms when they believed it was important to their
 economic development or national security. Iraq, for
 example, bought buses from British Leyland while the
 company was on the blacklist. If goods or services are
 only available through a few exporters, exceptions are
 made. The boycott also may be ignored if a blacklist-
 ed firm is the only source for necessary spare parts.
 The former head of the US Commerce Department's
 Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance said in 1981, "If
 they want the goods, Arab countries will accommo-
 date themselves ... by and large an arrangement can
 Military equipment is usually exempted from boycott
 requirements since government-to-government sales
 are not subject to the boycott. Despite the principle of
 blacklisting any company contributing to Israel's mili-
 tary strength, Arab governments regularly put their
 own national security interests ahead of boycott rules.
 Still, the General Principles for the Boycott of Israel
 recommend that importing countries examine Israel's
 connections with arms manufacturers.
 The boycott office excepts from boycott rules any
 international banking institution from which the Ar-
 abs derive greater benefit than Israel regardless of the
 extent of the bank's relationship with Israel. A com-
 mercial bank will not be blacklisted for dealing with
 Israel if boycott officials have evidence that the bank
 has loaned more money to Arabs than to Israelis.
 In the same vein, some Arab countries have told
 corporations investing in Israel that they would not be
 blacklisted if they made an equal or greater invest-
 ment in an Arab country.

 large firms and banks, therefore, have foun that they
 can deal with both Arab states and Israel because the
 Arabs consider their products or capital resources

 Implementation of the boycott varies from country to
 country. Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Kuwait are consid-
 ered by most observers to be among the strictest

 The impact of the boycott on Israel's economy is
 difficult to measure, but we believe it was a factor in
 the drop in foreign investment in Israel from a high of
 $185 million in 1973 to $86 million in 1985 after net
 disinvestment of $1 million in 1980. Although Israel
 touts its free trade access to the EC as an attraction to
 investors, many potential investors probably locate in
 EC countries to avoid boycott problems. The boycott,
 however, is only one of the reasons for the decline in
 investment. Triple-digit inflation and a strop trade
 union movement discourage many investors.

 its peace treaty with Israel.
 Iraq and Libya are among the most inflexible enforc-
 ers of the boycott, but they will make exceptions for
 products or services that cannot be matched else-
 where, especially items for the petroleum industry.
 Before the US embargo on Libyan petroleum-related
 services and equipment in 1981, Tripoli allowed boy-
 cott language acceptable to US authorities in letters
 of credit for goods that could not be found outside the
 United States.
 Oman, at the other extreme, is an unenthusiastic
 participant in the boycott. Muscat's practice has been
 to pay lipservice to CBO directives and interpret them
 in a liberal fashion or ignore them entirely.
 Impact of the Boycott
 Until the mid-1970s the Israeli Government for the
 most part was quiet about the boycott, fearing that
 publicity would only remind the business community
 of its existence. Before the increase in Arab economic
 power in 1973, Israel had so little concern about the
 boycott that in 1971 it abolished its small antiboycott
 office. In 1975, however, Israel reestablished an anti-
 boycott unit. Still, Israeli Government officials have
 differed in tone on the boycott, stressing its negative
 aspects when talking to US officials but playing it
 down to potential investors. Israeli officials have
 acknowledged that foreign firms are able to continue
 doing business with Israel through various means such
 as dealing through separate companies or subsidiaries
 or simply ignoring the boycott. Although some firms

 The economic impact on the sponsoring Arab states is
 diluted considerably by their failure to implement the
 boycott stringently. If the Arab states adhered vigor-
 ously to their boycott principles, they might deny
 themselves access to necessary inputs or best suppli-
 ers.
 In the long term, Arab countries' implementation of
 the boycott is likely to be marked by continued self-
 interest, with exceptions to boycott regulations com-
 mon when they serve a particular nation's purpose.
 Therefore, the boycott's impact on Israel, the Arab
 states, and third-country businesses will continue to
 be limited
 The main achievement of the Arab boycott has been
 the symbolic expression of Arab solidarity against
 Israel, as the boycott has few of the elements neces-
 sary for successful sanctions:
 ? The Arab states do not control the supply of goods
 Israel imports.
 ? The boycott is not mandatory for members of the
 Arab League.
 ? The degree of enforcement varies widely, in part
 because of the potential detrimental impact on the
 Arab states themselves. US antiboycott legislation
 has complicated the enforcement effort.
 ? The political and economic impacts of the boycott
 on Israel have been small.

 Appendix C
 USSR Sanctions Against
 People's Republic of China (1960)
 Background to the Sanctions
 The decision by the USSR in August 1960 to cancel
 abruptly its technical assistance to and withdraw its
 economic experts from China was a dramatic remind-
 er that Soviet aid entails a heavy political price. In the
 early 1950s, China felt compelled to pay this price of
 subservience to Soviet national interests and Soviet
 leadership of the Communist world in order to enjoy
 the strategic and economic benefits of the Sino-Soviet
 alliance. By the mid-1950s, however, as China began
 to stand on its own feet, differences over a broad
 spectrum of political, military, economic, and ideolog-
 ical questions began to undermine Sino-Soviet
 relations.
 As China became increasingly independent, Soviet
 policy vacillated. In agreeing in 1957 to assist China
 in the development of an advanced weapons program,
 the USSR sought to persuade the Chinese leadership
 to subordinate their political ambitions in the interests
 of becoming a great military power. But, when in
 1958 the Maoist leadership in quick succession
 claimed to have discovered a new road to economic
 development (the Great Leap Forward) and a shortcut
 to the ultimate Communist society (the People's Com-
 mune) and then precipitated the Taiwan Strait crisis,
 Khrushchev turned increasingly to threats and sanc-
 reality as Stalin had been and the Chinese delegate
 responded in kind, including a personal attack on
 Khrushchev for having "betrayed" Marxism-
 Leninism, the moment of truth had arrived.
 The purposes for which the USSR imposed economic
 sanctions against China in mid-1960 were never
 clearly defined. Crude and self-defeating as it may
 seem in retrospect, Soviet strategy appears to have
 been to give China a foretaste of the even more
 unpleasant consequences that would ensue if Beijing
 persisted in challenging Soviet leadership and Soviet
 doctrine. The Soviet Union may also have hoped to
 take advantage of China's economic dislocation-the
 result of the Great Leap Forward and a succession of
 bad harvests-to strengthen the hand of the moderate
 opposition within the Chinese Communist Party to
 Mao's radical policies.
 Having threatened in an international Communist
 forum to reduce aid unless China retreated, the
 Soviets may have felt compelled to act when it
 became evident the Chinese would not back down.
 Since the objective of the sanctions was not made
 clear, it was interpreted by the Chinese as an attempt
 to force the replacement of Mao Zedong as leader of
 tions in order to secure compliance from China. In
 June 1959, for example, both as a penalty for past
 behavior and a threat for the future, Khrushchev
 formally abrogated the Soviet commitment to assist
 China in the development of nuclear weapons
 With the publication of the polemical Lenin Anniver-
 sary pronouncements in April 1960, the Chinese
 issued an unmistakable challenge to Soviet ideological
 and political leadership of the international Commu-
 nist movement. The Soviets responded at a Bloc
 conference in June by circulating a long letter de-
 nouncing the Chinese and threatening to reduce aid
 unless China backed down. When Khrushchev then
 attacked Mao for being as vain and isolated from
 the CCP or at least the repudiation of his policies.
 Description of the Sanctions
 The USSR inflicted a heavy blow on the Chinese
 economy in August 1960 when it abruptly canceled
 Soviet technical assistance and withdrew some 2,000
 experts. Soviet aid projects (some 300, including those
 supplied by East European countries) constituted the

 Secret
 very heart of China's industrialization program. Prac-
 tically all the basic plans for industrial development-
 for example, the construction of new steel complexes,
 the building of new power plants, the development of
 railways, and the installation of new chemical plants
 and oil refineries-were predicated on these projects.
 Although perhaps one-half of these were fully or
 partly completed and in operation by mid-1960, the
 whole program was undercut by the sudden withdraw-
 al of Soviet technicians, who took the blueprints for
 plant installation back with them. While Sino-Soviet
 trade continued, equipment on order and arriving
 from the Soviet Union could not be installed and
 began to pile up on railway sidings, in warehouses,
 and in half-completed factories.
 Although the Soviets threatened a more drastic cessa-
 tion of aid, they did not cut off trade, even in such
 strategic commodities as petroleum (for which China
 was then heavily dependent on the USSR) and spare
 parts for China's industry, including military indus-
 try. Indeed, it was the Chinese who in the fall of 1960
 took the initiative in cutting back on trade by phasing
 out the importation of Soviet complete plants and
 equipment.
 Factors Affecting Success or Failure
 The Soviet Union could only prevent the supply of
 experts and technical assistance to China from Soviet
 Bloc countries. As a result of the Korean war and the
 associated US and allied trade embargoes, however,
 in 1960 China could not obtain many types of ma-
 chinery, equipment, and complete plant installations
 from any other source. The same applied to technical
 assistance.
 Within three months, however, the Soviet Govern-
 ment had second thoughts and offered to send "any
 number" of Soviet experts back to China. This rever-
 sal was apparently prompted by the belated realiza-
 tion that, by pulling the experts out, the USSR had
 deprived itself of the chief remaining instrument
 through which it might retain some leverage or
 influence on the Chinese leadership and policy. The
 Soviets also apparently had some forebodings of the
 enormity of the consequences, which were to greatly
 accelerate the process of separating the Soviet and
 Chinese economies and societies.
 The economic cost of the sanctions to China is
 difficult to assess. There is no question that the
 withdrawal of Soviet experts dealt the Chinese econo-
 my a heavy blow whose effects were still felt many
 years afterwards. Combined with three years of bad
 harvests and the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward,
 it helped precipitate a domestic crisis in the years
 1960-62, which for a time appeared to imperil the
 very existence of the Mao regime. Although industrial
 production plummeted, the basic cause of this crisis
 was a shortage of food so severe that it reached
 famine proportions (the Chinese have admitted a
 famine death toll in excess of 10 million at this time)
 in the disaster areas of eastern and northern China.
 Paradoxically, as the crisis deepened and the Chinese
 restructured their economy to give priority to agricul-
 ture and maintaining subsistence levels of food con-
 sumption, there was progressively less need for Soviet
 experts and technical assistance for China's industry.
 Finally, the political consequences of the Soviet appli-
 cation of economic sanctions against China were
 counterproductive. Instead of undermining the Maoist
 leadership, Soviet sanctions were exploited by the
 Chinese as a scapegoat for the regime's economic
 failures. A nationwide campaign criticizing Khru-
 shchev and the Soviet Union was organized in discus-
 sion groups extending down to the primary school
 level. The Chinese charged the Soviet leader with
 precipitating China's industrial slowdown (by with-
 drawing Soviet technicians); aggravating China's food
 crisis (by insisting on debt repayment via expanded
 Chinese exports of foodstuffs); and attempting to
 subvert and subdue the Chinese Government (by
 applying economic pressures). In addition, the Chinese
 propagandists heaped personal abuse on the Soviet
 leader (employing such epithets as "pig," "donkey,"
 "coward," and "turncoat") and predicted that eventu-
 ally he would be disowned and overthrown by the
 Soviet people.

 China: Total Trade Trends, 1950-70
 Throughout the three-year "time of troubles"
 (1960-62), there was continuing controversy within
 China's leadership over the proper response to Soviet Billion us $
 economic pressures. Alternating between defiance and
 at least tactical accommodation, the varying charac-
 ter of this response appeared to reflect fluctuating
 leadership assessments of the gravity of China's do-
 mestic crisis.
 Confronted with famine, popular uprisings, and the
 threat of disaffection in the Army, the Chinese re-
 sponded favorably to the Soviet offer to negotiate a
 new aid and trade agreement in November 1960 and,
 throughout the ensuing protracted negotiations,
 ceased polemics and even made a number of concilia-
 tory gestures toward the Soviet Union. But the help
 that China had hoped to obtain-principally, 5 mil-
 lion tons of grain-was not forthcoming. Moscow's
 refusal of Beijing's request at a time of desperate need
 further embittered the Chinese.
 After a further period of tactical accommodation in
 the spring and summer of 1962 (this time prompted by
 concern over the threat of a US-supported Chinese
 Nationalist invasion), the Maoist leadership then de-
 cided in the fall of 1962 to launch an all-out struggle
 against the "modern revisionist" leadership of the
 Soviet Union. The following year, the Chinese began
 to orient their economy more and more toward the
 West and Japan. The large capitalist industrial states
 increasingly took over from the Soviet Union the bulk
 of China's annual foreign trade (see figure 1). More-
 over, as the Chinese emerged from their economic
 depression, they began placing in the West long-term
 orders for complete plant deliveries of the type the
 Soviets had made to China in the past.
 Instead of bringing the Chinese to their knees, the
 final outcome of the Soviet decision in mid-1960 to
 impose economic sanctions on China was to bring to
 an end the central role the USSR had played in
 China's modernization and to reorient the Chinese
 economy toward the capitalist West.

 The USSR's cutoff of aid to China is a case where
 sanctions not only failed to achieve their objectives
 but led to adverse political consequences for their
 sponsor:
 ? The Chinese leadership was so committed to its
 ideological break with the Soviet Union and to
 establishment of its own independent development
 and foreign policy courses that it was willing to bear
 the considerable economic and political cost of the
 sanctions.
 ? The sanctions also provided the Chinese leadership
 with a scapegoat for domestic economic problems,
 thereby reducing their political impact during diffi-
 cult times.
 ? Chinese adjustment to the impact of the sanctions
 ultimately left Moscow with limited economic
 means to influence Beijing's behavior, a substantial
 political reversal for the sponsor of the sanctions.

 Appendix D
 OAS and US Sanctions Against
 Dominican Republic (1961-62)
 Background to the Sanctions
 For 31 years, the Dominican Republic was ruled by
 what some academics have called the most absolute
 dictatorship ever established in Latin America. Gen.
 Rafael Trujillo began in 1930 to build a power base
 on the control-through strong-arm tactics and brib-
 ery-of both the armed forces and the political
 apparatus as well as on a virtual monopoly of the
 national economy. The Trujillo family controlled over
 half the arable land, three-fourths of the nation's
 labor force, and four-fifths of the capital city's busi-
 nesses.
 By the late 1950s, however, international and domes-
 tic forces combined to undermine Trujillo. Regional
 sentiment against dictators mounted with the fall of
 other Latin American strongmen, such as Juan Peron
 of Argentina in 1955, Marcos Perez Jimenez of
 Venezuela in 1958, and Fulgencio Batista of Cuba in
 1959, and the publicity over Trujillo's allegedly order-
 ing the execution of a political opponent and his
 American pilot in 1956. Meanwhile, Washington was
 becoming increasingly aware of the growing anti-US
 sentiment in Latin America that was highlighted by
 Vice President Nixon's unfriendly reception in Peru
 and Venezuela in 1958. As a result, the Eisenhower
 administration reevaluated its policies toward Latin
 America and began withdrawing support from the
 Trujillo regime, including cancellation of arms trade
 agreements.
 Pressure against the Trujillo regime intensified in
 February 1959 when Romulo Betancourt-an outspo-
 ken critic of Trujillo-took office as the president of
 Venezuela. In June 1959, Dominican exiles launched
 an unsuccessful invasion that Trujillo believed was
 Venezuelan backed. Trujillo lashed out with unprece-
 dented violence against the exiles and their supporters
 in the Dominican Republic. Pressed by Venezuela, the
 OAS's Inter-American Peace Committee accused the
 Dominican Republic of "flagrant and widespread
 violation of human rights" including the "denial of
 free assembly and of free speech, arbitrary arrests,
 cruel and inhuman treatment of political prisoners,
 and the use of terror and intimidation as political
 weapons." In retaliation for Betancourt's continued
 verbal attacks on Trujillo and for alleged Venezuelan
 assistance in the June invasion, Trujillo launched his
 third and nearly successful assassination attempt on
 the Venezuelan president.
 OAS and US Sanctions
 Dominican aggression against Venezuela caused the
 OAS to initiate sanctions. In January 1961, the
 members voted to:
 ? Break diplomatic relations with the Dominican
 Republic.
 ? Partially interrupt economic relations with the
 Dominican Republic, beginning with the immediate
 suspension of trade in arms and implements of war
 of every kind.
 These sanctions were later expanded to include trade
 in petroleum, petroleum products, trucks, spare parts,
 and other commodities.
 The United States initially objected to the sanctions,
 fearing that they would lead to Trujillo's overthrow
 and his replacement with a pro-Castro leader. Wash-
 ington argued that the OAS should persuade the
 Dominican Republic to become more democratic and
 hold free elections under international supervision.          25X1
 With the other members clearly opposed to the US
 approach, and in hopes that the OAS would condemn
 Cuba in the future, Washington decided to approve
 OAS sanctions. In addition to OAS sanctions, the
 United States cut back import quotas for Dominican
 sugar

 The US-supported sanctions, officially imposed as
 punishment for Dominican participation in the Betan-
 court assassination attempt, were, in our judgment,
 constructed to force political liberalization of the
 Trujillo regime or an end to Trujillo's rule. After
 Trujillo's death, the sanctions were used as a tool to
 rid the Dominican Republic of the Trujillo family,
 prevent a rightwing coup, and press for democratic
 The sanctions hit the Dominican economy when al-
 ready sagging economic performance hampered ad-
 justment to them and the Trujillo regime had turned
 its attention to survival. Real GDP growth, which had
 averaged 7 percent annually from 1953 to 1958, had
 fallen to only 1 percent 1959 and 1960 as massive
 capital flight cut imports sharply. In 1960 foreign
 exchange revenues were drawn down by nearly half,
 to $15 million. Moreover, two-thirds of public expen-
 ditures were allocated for defense. In 1961, the
 sanctions worsened the economic crisis:
 ? A shipping crisis occurred when Venezuela refused
 to admit ships that had docked in the Dominican
 Republic and the international seamen's and long-
 shoremen's unions stopped loading ships bound for
 the country.
 ? Oil shortages developed when the Netherlands An-
 tilles halted shipments of refined petroleum and
 Shell Oil temporarily suspended sales in response to
 pressure from Venezuela.
 ? Export earnings in 1961 were cut 21 percent, and
 imports fell another 20 percent in nominal terms.
 The Dominicans were able to circumvent some of the
 sanctions by purchasing arms, vehicles, and petro-
 leum-albeit at higher cost-from Canada, Western
 Europe, and the Middle East. Trujillo also managed
 to ship coffee to the United States disguised in
 Colombian bags, and he planned to build a Domini-
 can refinery with French and US contractors.
 Squeezed by the growing crisis, Trujillo raised taxes,
 slashed public employee salaries, cut bonuses, and
 increased commissions to government officials on all
 business transactions. He also used the sanctions as a
 basis for anti-US propaganda and opened diplomatic
 and commercial relations with the USSR and Eastern
 Europe. In these circumstances, investor confidence
 remained in the depths. Economic activity fell 2.2
 percent in 1961, and unemployment rose sharply.

 The deterioration of the economy fostered political
 unrest in the middle and upper classes, the Army-
 traditional Trujillo supporters-and the Catholic
 Church. The regime responded with increased repres-
 sion and terror. An underground movement grew
 rapidly, and on 30 May 1961 Trujillo was assassinat-
 ed. Trujillo's inept son succeeded his father, while
 figurehead President Balaguer retained his office.
 With continued economic pressures from OAS sanc-
 tions and an increasingly vociferous opposition, Tru-
 jillo's son resigned abruptly in November. Trujillo's
 brothers, dissuaded from taking power by the show of
 US naval force off the coast and the antagonism of
 the Dominican armed forces, left the country with the
 remainder of the Trujillo family, leaving Balaguer in
 charge. Balaguer, considered a Trujillista, encoun-
 tered widespread domestic opposition. After the Unit-
 ed States threw its support to the opposition, Balaguer
 was forced to share power with a seven-member
 Council of State and promised he would resign if
 OAS sanctions were removed. On 4 January 1962, the
 OAS removed all diplomatic and economic sanctions.
 The OAS sanctions and US sugar quota cutbacks,
 initiated to punish Trujillo and force political liberal-
 ization in the country, met with considerable success
 in exacerbating deteriorating economic conditions and
 providing fuel for the floundering anti-Trujillo opposi-
 tion. Although the assassination of Trujillo cannot be
 directly attributed to the sanctions, after his death
 clear signals of US policy and the continuation of the
 sanctions forced the Trujillo family to flee the coun-
 try.

 Appendix E
 US and OAS Sanctions Against
 Cuba 9 (1962-Present)
 Background to the Sanctions
 Almost from the day Castro took power in January
 1959, Havana and Washington embarked on courses
 of action that inevitably led to conflict. The United
 States was at first shocked by the circuslike execu-
 tions of Batista supporters and then alarmed at Cuban
 provocations directed against US citizens, property,
 and policies. The antagonism grew as Cuba came to
 be seen as the vehicle for Soviet encroachment into
 the hemisphere.
 The turning point came with the visit to Cuba of
 Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, who
 signed a trade agreement with the Cubans on
 15 February 1960. The agreement was the first of a
 series of political, military, and economic understand-
 ings that tied Cuba to the USSR. Furthermore, it
 began the basic reorientation of Cuba away from its
 traditional relationship with the United States. On
 7 May 1960 Cuba and the USSR reestablished full
 diplomatic relations.
 With these actions and the attacks against US proper-
 ty and interests, US policymakers decided to impose
 economic sanctions against Cuba. A contingency or-
 der had already been given in March 1960 for Cuban
 refugees to be organized, trained, and equipped for
 possible action:
 ? In June the American- and British-owned oil refin-
 eries in Cuba refused to process crude oil sent from
 the Soviet Union. (Cuba retaliated by seizing the
 installations.)
 ? In July, President Eisenhower suspended the re-
 mainder of the Cuban sugar quota for 1960, which
 amounted to 900,000 tons out of a total of 3.1
 million tons, worth approximately $92 million. (The
 Cubans reacted by confiscating a series of properties
 of US citizens and companies.)
 The application of economic sanctions was only one set of
 measures used by Washington in its relationship with the Castro
 regime. Other measures included military action, covert activities,
 political pressure, and propaganda, which are not addressed in this
 ? During the same two-month period a coordinated
 decision was made by the US Government and the
 US companies to remove key personnel from Ameri-
 can-owned plants in Cuba, a measure designed to
 put the squeeze on Cuba's productive capacity and
 output. (Despite disruptions, this technical manpow-
 er gap was filled by Cubans or foreign specialists.
 By August, the Castro regime had seized all Ameri-
 can-owned properties on the island.)
 Following the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion in
 April 1961, US policy toward Cuba entered a new
 phase:
 ? On 3 February 1962 the Kennedy administration
 imposed a total prohibition on exports to Cuba
 except for "foodstuffs, medicines, and medical
 equipment for humanitarian reasons."
 ? On 23 March, Washington prohibited imports of
 merchandise made or derived in whole or part of
 products of Cuban origin.
 Under the Johnson administration, the anti-Cuban
 measures already instituted by the United States were
 multilateralized through hemispheric approval and
 support. In July 1964 the OAS voted to establish the
 following sanctions against Cuba:
 ? The severing of diplomatic and commercial
 relations.
 ? The suspension of all trade-direct and indirect-
 except for foodstuffs, medicines, and medical
 equipment.
 ? The suspension of all sea and air service to and from
 Cuba.
 ? The establishment of passport restrictions on travel
 to and from Cuba.
 Additional sanctions were imposed by the OAS in
 1967:
 ? The recommendation that cargoes owned or fi-
 nanced by member governments not be shipped on
 vessels sailing to Cuba.

 Secret
 ? The general call to "Western" allies to restrict their
 trade and financial ties to Cuba.10
 Most OAS members adopted the sanctions, but many
 did not rigorously enforce them.
 The initial primary objective of the US sanctions was
 to remove Castro from power, as demonstrated most
 visibly by the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion. Subse-
 quently, US policy shifted to a combination of eco-
 nomic and political pressures designed at least to
 neutralize Castro and, at best, to cause his downfall.
 The 1962 missile crisis did not change this thrust. US
 officials publicly and privately stated their belief that
 Cuba posed a potentially grave security threat to the
 United States-directly because of its ties to the
 international Communist movement and indirectly
 because of its support for subversive groups elsewhere
 in Latin America.
 The basic structure of the Eisenhower-Kennedy
 Cuban policy changed little during the Johnson ad-
 ministration. The Johnson administration followed the
 example of its predecessors by treating the Castro
 regime as temporary. The United States publicly
 portrayed the overall goal of its policies to be the
 establishment of "a truly free and independent Cuba
 which, under a government democratically chosen by
 the people, will live in peace with is neighbors."" US
 officials also publicly identified four specific goals,
 indicating that US objectives had become more di-
 verse over time. These goals were:
 ? To weaken the Castro regime.
 ? To discredit the Cuban economic model and make
 Cuba pay a high economic price for its conduct.
 ? To contain the spread of Castroism.
 " Robert M. Sayre, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-
 American Affairs, "Review of Movement of Cuban Refugees and
 Hemispheric Policy Toward Cuba," Department of State Bulletin,
 ? To make Soviet support of the Castro regime so
 costly in political and economic terms that the
 Soviets would realize the futility of continuing their
 burdensome commitment to Cuba or of assuming
 similar commitments elsewhere in the hemisphere.
 US policy goals toward Cuba did not change signifi-
 cantly during the Nixon administration." Neverthe-
 less, enforcement of the economic sanctions became
 increasingly difficult. The onset of the Vietnam war
 had revised Washington's foreign policy priorities, as
 had the administration's overture to China, and ef-
 forts to enforce the embargo became less aggressive
 over time. The Castro regime not only had demon-
 strated its staying power, but also had gradually
 abandoned its support for revolutionary movement in
 the hemisphere. Indeed, Havana launched a broad
 campaign to normalize its economic and political
 relations with other nations in the hemisphere as well
 as in Africa, Asia, and Europe.
 As a result of these events, pressures began to build in
 the United States against continuation of the policy of
 isolation. In the early 1970s a number of US Con-
 gressmen began urging normalized relations with
 Cuba. In 1972 five hemispheric nations recognized
 Cuba, in the face of the OAS ban on relations. In
 1974 the United States agreed to permit the first
 major exception to US embargo regulations by per-
 mitting sales to Cuba by US subsidiaries in third
 countries. Other exceptions followed.

 By the mid-1970s, therefore, it had become apparent
 that the broad application of economic sanctions and
 other measures aimed at the isolation of Cuba was no
 longer possible. In August 1975 the OAS passed a
 Figure 2
 Cuba: Trade With the United States, 1956-62
 resolution that allowed each member to determine for percent
 itself the nature of its economic and diplomatic
 relations with Cuba. The United States voted in favor
 of the resolution.
 The Economic Impact of the Sanctions
 In our judgment, the Cuban embargo in its early
 years was significantly damaging to Cuba's growth
 and general development. Before the embargo, Ha-
 vana was extremely dependent on trade with the
 United States (see figure 2). The loss of this natural
 trading partner caused serious dislocations throughout
 the Cuban economy.
 Havana's hard currency earnings suffered greatly
 from the loss of the US market for sugar-its major
 export. Since most large sugar importers had long-
 established contracts with sugar-producing nations,
 Cuba could not make sizable sales to other hard
 currency purchasers. With low export revenues from
 its major crop, Cuba was forced to reduce drastically
 its imports from the West. Havana turned to the
 Communist Bloc for trade, and, by 1965, this group of
 countries accounted for 76 percent of Cuban trade, up
 from less than 3 percent in 1957 (see figure 3).
 The rapid shift in the direction of trade caused a
 multitude of domestic production problems. The most
 damaging effect of the embargo was probably Cuba's
 inability to attain the needed spare parts and raw
 material inputs for its almost entirely (90 percent) US-
 produced capital stock. Other problems arose from a
 lack of complementarity between Cuba's import needs
 and Bloc export capabilities. Often the kinds of
 machinery and raw material imports that Cuba need-
 ed most were in short supply within the Bloc. Fre-
 quently, the quality of Bloc imports was unsuitable,
 either because of poor production processes or because
 products were unsuitable to the Cuban climate, tech-
 nological orientations, or methods of use. Hundreds of
 pieces of Soviet farm equipment were junked because

 1956   57 58 59 60
 they were designed for continental crops planted in
 rows of different widths from those the Cubans
 planted
 While it is not possible to quantify the cost of the
 embargo to Cuba, we believe it was at least partially
 responsible for the decreases in production experi-
 enced by Havana during the 1960s (see table 2)."
 Other factors included irrational and inefficient plan-
 ning systems and the flight of skilled technicians. In
 addition, the embargo had a significant impact on
 Cuban lifestyle since the Cuban people were over-
 whelmingly dependent on US consumer goods and
 foodstuffs. Domestic production was oriented toward
 export goods, and, after the implementation of the

 The effects of the embargo have diminished consider-
 ably over time. Cuba's capital base now consists
 largely of Soviet, East and West European, and
 Japanese machinery and equipment. Consumer goods
 are more readily available from both the Eastern Bloc
 and from improved domestic production capabilities.
 In addition, Havana has opened several front compa-
 nies that enable it to obtain various types of US
 products, particularly consumer goods. Industrial, ag-
 ricultural, and transportation activities are now rela-
 tively unaffected by the disruptions and diversions of
 resources originally associated with the embargo.
 The costs of the embargo to the United States were
 minimal. Washington readily obtained alternative
 suppliers for Cuban sugar. In addition, US exports to
 Cuba were small-2.8 percent of total US exports in
 Political Impact of the Sanctions
 The imposition of sanctions in the 1960s did little to
 weaken then Prime Minister Castro's internal politi-
 cal situation. Indeed, the benfits probably outweighed
 the disadvantages. Sanctions implied a grave external
 threat, which Castro exploited to carry out the radi-
 calization of all Cuban political, economic, and social
 institutions. In an atmosphere of national peril, most
 Cubans were ready to accent radical change in a spirit

 would ordinarily fall directly were no longer of eco-

 after the sanctions had lost their economic impact, the
 Castro regime continued to extract political capital by
 blaming virtually every economic problem on them.
 Recently Cuba attributed its need for debt reschedul-
 ing to the economic damage allegedly wrought by the
 US sanctions.
 In our judgment, the US and OAS economic sanc-
 tions, by themselves or in conjunction with other
 measures, have not met any of their objectives. We
 also believe that Western economic sanctions have
 almost no chance of compelling the present Cuban

 We believe the current Cuban leadership reacts to
 sanctions and other external pressures not by reducing
 foreign subversive adventures but by stepping up such
 activity. Unless Western pressures coincide with Sovi-
 et pressures on Havana, sanctions are not likely to
 have the desired limiting effect on Cuban policy until
 the "guerrilla elite" now in control in Havana passes
 from the scene.
 The outcome of the US economic sanctions against

 ? The sanctions provided Castro with a scapegoat for

 the threat they posed to gain acceptance of radical
 changes in all aspects of Cuban society.
 ? Cuban adjustment to the impact of the sanctions
 left the United States with limited economic means
 to influence Havana's behavior.
 In addition, OAS participation in the sanctions did
 not change the results because their additional eco-
 nomic impact was minimal and enforcement became
 increasingly lax. The economic cost to the Soviets of

 Economic Sanctions Applied
 Against Cuba as of 1975
 The OAS Sanctions
 (None of these has effect by itself; all need support by
 laws and regulations of the individual states):
 ? Member states are called upon to suspend all trade
 with Cuba, except for foodstuffs, medicines, and
 medical equipment; and to suspend all sea transpor-
 tation between their countries and Cuba except that
 necessary for humanitarian reasons (under Author-
 ity of the Rio Treaty, Resolution 3 of the Ninth
 Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign
 Affairs 1964).
 ? Recommendation is made that OAS member states
 deny bunkers and government cargoes to ships in
 the Cuba trade (under OAS charter, Resolution III
 10 of the 12th Meeting of Consultation of Ministers
 of Foreign Affairs, 1967).
 ? Recommendation is made that friendly nonmember
 governments restrict their commercial and financial
 operations with Cuba, as well as sea and air trans-
 port with that country, especially transactions and
 transport conducted by state entities (recommenda-
 tion under OAS charter, Resolution 111 2 of the
 12th Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of For-
 eign Affairs, 1967).
 Restrictions on US Citizens and Entities
 Section 620(a) of the US Foreign Assistance Act of
 1961, as amended, authorizes the President to "estab-
 lish and maintain a total embargo upon all trade
 between the United States and Cuba." Although in
 actual practice provision is made for exceptions for
 humanitarian purposes, a near-total embargo on such
 trade is maintained under regulations that include:
 ? Export control regulations. Issued under the au-
 thority contained in the Export Administration Act
 of 1969 (previously the Export Control Act of 1949)
 and other laws, these regulations prohibit any unli-
 censed direct or indirect export from the United
 States to Cuba except for humanitarian shipments
 of certain foodstuffs, medical supplies, and inexpen-
 sive gift parcels. This prohibition includes parts and
 components exported from the United States for use
 in the manufacture of a product for export to Cuba.
 Licenses are usually not issued.
 ? Cuban assets control regulations. Issued under the
 authority contained in Section 5 (b) of the 1917
 Trading with the Enemy Act and other laws, these
 regulations:
 Prohibit the direct or indirect import or export
 of any property in which Cuba or a Cuban
 national has any interest.
 - Prohibit, without a license from the US Trea-
 sury, any vessel under the control of US citizens
 or their foreign subsidiaries from engaging in
 the Cuba trade.
 - Prohibit US companies that own foreign petro-
 leum installations in their own names from
 bunkering or having any dealing with vessels
 registered in or under charter or lease to Cuba.
 - Block Cuban assets in the United States, pre-
 vent use of US financial facilities by Cuba or
 Cuban nationals, and prohibit Americans, in-
 cluding those who are officers and directors of
 foreign subsidiaries of US companies, from
 engaging in any financial or commercial trans-
 action with Cuba without Treasury license.
 - Where there are no American officers or direc-
 tors, the US company is asked to support US
 foreign policy by preventing its foreign subsid-
 iary from engaging in such transactions. This
 "moral suasion" has been successful.

 appropriate steps to prevent ships or aircraft under
 their registry from carrying any goods to or from
 Cuba. This can be waived if the President deter-
 mines it is important to national interests.

 of 1951 (the Battle Act): US assistance is prohibited
 to any country that permits strategic exports to any
 nation threatening the security of the United States.
 Cuba was included within the terms of the Battle
 Act as of November 1962.

 (Public Law 480): Under Title I of the Act, US sales
 of agricultural commodities are prohibited to coun-
 tries that sell, furnish, or permit their ships or
 aircraft to carry any equipment, materials or com-
 modities to or from Cuba, except that with respect
 to the selling, furnishing, or transporting of medical

 by the US Government should not be shipped from
 US ports on a foreign flag vessel that has called in
 Cuba since 1 January 1963 unless the persons
 controlling the vessel give satisfactory assurance
 that no ships under their control will, henceforth, be

 gaged in trade with Cuba since 1 January 1963. In
 accordance with the recommendation of the 12th
 Meeting of Consultation of Foreign Ministers of the
 American States, licenses for bunkers are denied to
 ships that have called in Cuba since 24 September

 Appendix F
 UK and UN Sanctions
 Against Rhodesia (1965-79)
 White Rhodesian opposition to sharing power with the
 country's black majority set the stage for the UK-led
 imposition of economic sanctions against Rhodesia in
 November 1965. Pressured by rising worldwide anti-
 colonial sentiment after World War II, the United
 Kingdom hammered out a new constitution for Rho-
 desia in 1961. Among other things, the new constitu-
 tion established a complex franchise system that
 immediately created 15 parliamentary seats for
 blacks and could have led eventually to black majority
 rule. Seeking a quicker and more complete power
 transfer, however, black nationalist groups (led by
 Joshua Nkomo of the Zimbabwe African People's
 Union) rejected the new constitution and, for the first
 time, resorted to violence against white property.
 Conservative whites formed the Rhodesian Front in
 March 1962, and this party-aided by an election
 boycott by blacks-won power at the end of that year.
 The political platform of the Rhodesian Front was to
 remove the threat of black nationalism and gain
 independence from the United Kingdom. Ian Smith,
 who had risen to leadership of the Rhodesian Front by
 April 1964, pushed London to accede to a formal
 application for independence that had been made by
 the party leadership in 1963. Although the British
 Government was not averse to independence for Rho-
 desia, a stalemate quickly developed over the role of
 black Rhodesians after independence. Britain sought
 five conditions:
 ? Maintenance of the principles and intention of
 progress toward majority rule, already enshrined in
 the 1961 constitution.
 ? Guarantees against retrogressive amendment of the
 constitution.
 ? Immediate improvement in the political status of
 blacks.
 ? Progress toward ending racial discrimination.
 ? Acceptance by the Rhodesian population as a whole
 of any proposed basis for independence.
 Following two trips by Smith to London and a visit by
 UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson to Salisbury in
 futile attempts to iron out differences, the Smith
 government announced a unilateral declaration of
 independence on 11 November 1965. Prime Minister
 Wilson imposed economic sanctions against Rhodesia
 on the afternoon of the same day.
 London imposed a second set of sanctions in Decem-
 ber 1965, and the United Nations followed with
 sanctions in December 1966 and May 1968. The UN
 resolutions were passed without dissent. Both resolu-
 tions included reminders to member states that failure
 or refusal to implement the measures would constitute
 a violation of their obligations under the UN Charter.
 All states were called upon to report measures taken
 to implement the resolutions, and a Security Council
 committee was established     h r information on
 the evasion of sanctions.
 UN sanctions complemented those imposed by Lon-
 don and eventually encompassed a cutoff in all trade,
 transport of Rhodesian goods, and funding to Rhode-
 sia (see inset). In addition to the four major sanctions
 measures, both the United Kingdom and the United
 Nations passed supplementary legislation and resolu-
 tions designed to tighten and increase their effective-
 ness. In the period January through June 1966, the
 United Kingdom made purchases of several Rhode-
 sian products by anyone in the world a violation of
 British law. The UN Security Council passed roughly
 a dozen additional sanctions measures after May
 1968. Some of these covered loopholes in transporta-
 tion, financing, and franchising, while the remainder
 simply duplicated items in Resolutions 232 and 253.

 ? Removal from the sterling area.
 ? Ban on export of capital.
 ? Denial of access to the London capital market.
 ? Ban on further coverage by the UK Export Credits

 United Kingdom, December 1965
 ? Cutoff of purchases of several minerals (including
 copper, chrome, and asbestos) and foodstuffs (corn
 and beef).
 ? Blockage of dividend, interest, and pension pay-

 for similar action.
 The Wilson government's stated objectives were to
 end the Smith rebellion and restore legitimacy so that
 ultimately the country could be granted independence
 under majority rule. Wilson wished to unseat Smith
 ("There can be no truck with this illegal regime or any
 compromise with it.") rather than just induce a return
 to negotiations. The objectives of the subsequent UN
 sanctions were worded differently: to "end the rebel-
 lion" and to "avoid assisting the illegal regime." F_

 motor vehicles and equipment, and petroleum
 products.
 United Nations (Resolution 253), May 1968
 ? Ban on all imports from Rhodesia.
 ? Ban on all exports to Rhodesia, except medical and

 ? Cutoff of airline connections to and from Rhodesia
 because of the political impact these connections
 had in a third country.

 would not oppose his invasion of Uganda to remove
 Amin by force.
 Wilson had several unspoken objectives aimed at both
 domestic British constituencies and world opinion.

 son wanted to head off any growth in pressures for
 military intervention that might endanger his consen-

 Rhodesia. Their views coincided with those of many
 Third World countries. Some additional objectives not
 directly articulated by the Wilson government were:
 ? To forestall the use of force by other countries.
 ? To maintain Britain's positive image and reputation
 in the international community.
 ? To take a stand for morality and justice.
 ? To reduce the chances that Zambia might cut off
 copper shipments to British industry if Britain failed
 to punish Rhodesia.
 ? To reduce the likelihood of retaliation against
 whites in other African countries.
 The UK and UN sanctions were targeted against the
 225,000 white Rhodesians. Besides controlling the
 government, this group dominated the economy.
 White farmers produced all of the country's principal
 export crops; and white businessmen owned the mines,
 factories, transport facilities, and most of the whole-
 sale and retail distribution system. Had sanctions
 worked as intended, they would also have severely
 hurt the welfare of the country's 5 million blacks.
 Roughly half of these depended on low-paying jobs in
 white-owned businesses for at least part of their
 As it turned out, however, the sanctions were severely
 undermined because Rhodesia's African neighbors,
 Japan, the United States, and many European coun-
 tries-including the United Kingdom-were unwill-
 ing or unable to abide by them. Moreover, the United
 Kingdom and the United Nations were unwilling to
 enforce them militarily.
 South Africa, which faced the threat of sanctions
 because of apartheid, openly helped Rhodesia circum-
 vent the sanctions during the entire 14 years they
 were in effect. Pretoria continued to trade with
 Rhodesia and provided critical imports, such as oil, as
 well as transport and other entrepot services to the
 landlocked country. We estimate that at least two-
 thirds of the goods moving between Rhodesia and
 South Africa for much of the period originated or
 ended up in world markets with false documentation
 provided mainly by South African middlemen. The
 similarity between Rhodesian and South African
 traded goods, as well as South African laws prohibit-
 ing importers from disclosing the ultimate destination
 of their purchases, enhanced the ability of middlemen
 to obscure the Rhodesian connection.
 subsistence
 In many respects, Rhodesia appeared to represent a
 nearly ideal target for sanctions:
 ? Exports were concentrated in a small number of
 primary products-tobacco, sugar, and a few miner-
 als-and only three markets: the United Kingdom,
 Zambia, and South Africa.
 ? Imports were concentrated in one product area-
 machinery and transport equipment-and were pur-
 chased largely from two countries: the United King-
 dom and South Africa.
 ? Overall, foreign trade accounted for a sizable per-
 centage of Rhodesian GNP.
 ? The British economy was not critically dependent on
 supplies of raw materials from Rhodesia or on the
 Rhodesian market."
 "Several Western companies, however, were dependent on specific
 primary exports from Rhodesia. For example, Union Carbide of the
 United States and Foote Mineral of the United Kingdom depended
 on Rhodesia for chrome ore; Turner and Newall of the United
 Other African countries also breached the UN
 embargo:
 ? Disguised trade channels similar to those through
 South Africa were available to Rhodesia in Portu-
 guese Mozambique until its independence in mid-
 1975.
 ? Zambia-Rhodesia's largest 1965 export market-
 continued to trade with Rhodesia and to use its
 transport facilities until 1973. Then in October
 1978, after a five-year hiatus, transport bottlenecks
 on the alternative Benguela and Tazara railroads
 forced Zambia to resume transshipments via Rho-
 desia. This probably enabled some Rhodesian
 goods-particularly white corn, light manufactures,
 and coal-to find their way to Zambian markets.
 ? Other black African neighbors-Botswana, Mala-
 wi, and Zaire-maintained economic relations with
 Salisbury in spite of UN sanctions.

 Secret
 The West and Japan did not vigorously enforce
 sanctions, especially during the initial years of appli-
 cation. Indeed, much of the billing and payment for
 Rhodesia's trade with the West was -channeled
 through Swiss banks; Swiss middlemen apparently
 remained important conduits until the sanctions were
 lifted, although in January 1978 their government
 banned such activity. A 1978 report sponsored by the
 British Government accused the United Kingdom's
 two largest oil companies of supplying petroleum
 products to Rhodesia until 1976-first through South
 African middlemen, then via a complex swap arrange-
 ment with a French company in then Portuguese
 Mozambique. The United States resumed its role as
 the leading importer of Rhodesian chrome and several
 other minerals from the passage of the Byrd Amend-
 ment in late 1971 until its repeal in March 1977.
 ? The cutting of trade ties to Rhodesia would have
 caused severe economic dislocations in Malawi,
 Botswana, Zambia, and Zaire.
 The countries that evaded the Rhodesian sanctions
 generally felt they had strong reasons. These reflected
 their assessments of their own best economic and
 political interests combined with the inducement of
 strong price incentives offered by Rhodesian
 businessmen:
 ? The US Congress passed the Byrd Amendment on
 the grounds that chrome was "the one item which
 could and should be imported from Rhodesia that is
 vital to the national security of the United States."15
 ? Portugal viewed continued relations with Rhodesia
 as a stabilizing factor in southern Africa. This was
 important to Lisbon while it was still trying to
 maintain control of Angola and Mozambique
 through the mid-1970s.
 ? Switzerland felt that compliance with the sanctions
 would violate its longstanding policy of neutrality.
 " Although only chrome was mentioned during the Congressional
 hearings and debates, the general license issued by the Department
 of Treasury on 25 January 1972 authorized imports of chromium
 ore, ferrochrome produced in any country from Rhodesian chromi-
 um ore, and any other material of Rhodesian origin determined to
 be "strategic and critical." Rhodesia produced 22 of the 72
 minerals on the US list of "strategic and critical" mineral products,
 and many of these were imported while the Byrd Amendment was
 The UK and UN sanctions against Rhodesia failed to
 achieve the stated objectives of either Prime Minister
 Wilson or the UN Security Council. As time passed
 and the Rhodesian economy flourished, the United
 Kingdom narrowed its stated objectives for the sanc-
 tions. Instead of ousting the Smith regime, Britain's
 goal became that of keeping pressure on Smith to
 negotiate. Even that objective was questioned. By        25X1
 1972, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Foreign Secretary of
 the then Conservative government, said, "I do not
 honestly think that sanctions are the main influen
 which brings Mr. Smith to the negotiating table."
 Following the first full year of sanctions, the Rhode-   25X1
 sian economy performed well for almost a decade.
 Real GDP growth averaged 6.5 percent annually
 between 1965 and 1974; below-average economic
 performance occurred only in drought years. F_
 To achieve this pace, the government took a larger
 role in the economy through a formidable array of
 organizations and controls:
 ? Development corporations were set up to provide
 financing and technical expertise for industrial,
 mining, and agricultural enterprises.
 ? Efforts to find new export markets and to evade
 sanctions were centralized.
 ? The Rhodesian Government assumed extensive

 not match or exceed the 1965 level until 1973.
 Import substitution flourished and contributed to the
 economic resiliency. By 1970 manufacturing had re-
 placed agriculture as the leading nonservice sector,
 because of a 50-percent overall growth over the five-
 year period. As a result, virtually all essential consum-
 er items and some intermediate and capital goods
 were supplied domestically, thereby saving Rhodesia
 valuable foreign exchange. Indeed, import volume did

 Secret
 On the export side, only agricultural sales suffered
 badly during the sanctions period. The embargo crip-
 pled tobacco sales, Rhodesia's largest foreign ex-
 change earner. This was because tobacco was too
 easily traced to the source and could not, therefore, be
 passed through foreign middlemen to the world mar-
 ket. The sharp decline in tobacco earnings and a need
 to reduce dependence on imported food caused the
 government to encourage growers to switch to corn
 and wheat production.
 Sanctions initially hurt the chromium market, Rhode-
 sia's second-largest export earner. Despite a sharp
 downturn in output during the late 1960s, however,
 the US decision to end its embargo-the Byrd
 Amendment-and the skirting of trade impediments
 by other Western countries, allowed production to
 outstrip presanctions levels by 1972.
 Other nonagricultural exports generally held their
 own. Copper and pig iron sales, for instance, were
 hurt little by sanctions because of new markets in
 Western Europe and transit with South African bills
 of lading. The majority of Rhodesia's nondurable
 manufactures were sold to South Africa and were not
 affected.
 Following the unilateral declaration of independence,
 South African funds and an involuntary boost in
 domestic investment allowed Rhodesia largely to re-
 place traditional sources of capital. With remittances
 to US, British, and Canadian parent companies pro-
 hibited by the Smith government, profits had to be
 reinvested rather than repatriated. As a result, total
 domestic investment surged from 13 percent of GDP
 in 1964 to an annual average of 20 percent during the
 first half of the 1970s.
 In addition to the reinvested earnings, some $500-750
 million in new foreign investment flowed in, mostly
 from South Africa. Adherence to the boycott by
 international bankers and foreign donors made Salis-
 bury almost totally dependent on South Africa for
 these and other financial flows. Concessional aid and
 access to Pretoria's private capital markets enabled
 the Rhodesian Government to finance its small bud-
 get deficits.
 Beginning in 1975, Rhodesia was beset by a new
 round of troubles that wreaked economic havoc. The
 main factors were an escalation of the protracted civil
 war and the Zambian and Mozambican closure of
 their borders with Rhodesia. The ensuing uncertainty
 and the erosion of the middle-class market because of
 white emigration weakened the investment climate.
 Moreover, international demand for Rhodesian com-
 modities sagged with the recession in Western mar-
 kets. The economic downturn that began in 1975
 persisted for five years. With the real economic
 decline averaging 3 percent annually, per capita in-
 come had tumbled 24 percent by 1979.
 Government reactions to the war also had profound
 implications, as the mounting diversion of resources
 into defense undercut economic growth. The defense
 portion of the budget rose from 19 percent in 1975 to
 a peak of 32 percent in 1979, pushing the overall
 budget deficit from $4 million in 1975 to more than
 $700 million in 1979. The stimulative effects of rising
 defense expenditures were more than offset by the
 reduction in producer and consumer subsidies, the
 boost in personal income taxes, and the mandatory
 purchase of war bonds to help cover these deficits.
 Moreover, the shift of scarce foreign exchange to
 military-related purchases reduced financial resources
 for local businessmen, even as the diversion of skilled
 white manpower from industry and agriculture wors-
 ened an already bad labor situation
 External factors also undermined the embattled econ-
 omy. The Zambian border closure during the period
 1973-78 had deprived Salisbury of transshipping fees,
 but, by itself, this did little harm. More serious,
 however, was the decision in 1976 by the new Machel
 government in Mozambique to close Mozambique's
 borders with Rhodesia. This action forced a rerouting
 of trade through South Africa, which increased Rho-
 desia's freight payments about 50 percent annually.

 Secret
 Beyond the internal and regional forces, the deterio-
 rating international economy also took a heavy toll.
 Demand by developed countries for most of Rhode-
 sia's exports slumped as world oil prices soared. Trade
 sanctions caused Rhodesia to suffer disproportionate-
 ly, as buyers switched to more dependable suppliers.
 In addition, largely because of technology changes,
 Rhodesia was unable to replace the US chrome
 market lost to it after the 1977 repeal of the Byrd
 Amendment.
 Whether the sanctions were a significant factor in the
 ultimate switch to majority rule-14 years after they
 were imposed-is questionable. Without the escalat-
 ing civil war after 1975, the Rhodesian economy
 probably would have continued to achieve a perfor-
 mance acceptable to the white population, despite
 sanctions. Nonetheless, combined with the civil war
 and the persistent diplomatic pressures of the United
 States, the United Kingdom, and ultimately even
 South Africa, the Smith government probably fac-
 tored in the difficulties caused by sanctions in its
 decision to capitulate
 By imposing sanctions, the Wilson government proba-
 bly achieved some of its unstated objectives. Thus, the
 imposition of sanctions served-at least initially-as
 an effective expression of morality and justice and
 probably helped maintain a positive international
 image for Britain. As time passed and the sanctions
 proved ineffective in bringing Rhodesia to heel, these
 initial results were severely eroded. Third World
 countries, in particular, expressed frustration over
 London's unwillingness to resort to military force.
 Ironically, the longer term outcome of the Rhodesian
 sanctions was to leave the Smith government's succes-
 sors with stronger and far more diversified manufac-
 turing and agricultural sectors than would otherwise
 have been likely. By 1975 the investment of retained
 earnings by Rhodesian companies plus South African
 investment had developed Rhodesian manufacturing
 sufficiently to meet most domestic consumer needs
 and provide exports to South Africa and other neigh-
 boring countries. Because of the enforced switch from
 tobacco to grain crops, Rhodesia not only strength-
 ened its self-sufficiency in food production, but also
 became (along with South Africa) one of Africa's only
 two consistent net food exporting countries.
 The failure of the UK and UN sanctions to achieve
 more than a few unstated-and certainly not prima-
 ry-objectives illustrates the difficulties of enforcing
 sanctions even against a target that appears highly
 vulnerable:
 ? The sanctions were not fully enforced by any of the
 major implementing parties.
 ? Neither the United Kingdom nor the United
 Nations was willing to use military force.
 ? A key supplier of the value to be withheld by the
 sanctions-South Africa-did not participate and,
 in fact, openly flouted the sanctions.
 ? Largely because of South Africa's role, the Smith
 government's prohibition against profit repatriation
 by foreign-owned companies, and Salisbury's cen-
 tralization of economic authority, the Rhodesian
 economy adjusted quite well to the sanctions that
 were enforced.
 The fact that the Smith government gave way after
 14 years appears much more the result of the civil war
 and heavy diplomatic pressure than of the domestic
 impact of sanctions.
 Even though unintentional, the sanctions ultimately
 turned out to be beneficial from the viewpoint of both
 the sponsors and the target because they left Rhode-
 sia, now Zimbabwe, with a much stronger economy
 than would otherwise have been likely.

 French Sanctions Against
 Algeria (1971)
 Background to the Sanctions
 In April 1971, France imposed sanctions against
 Algeria in an effort to resolve a dispute over oil prices
 and the nationalization of French oil holdings. The
 issue arose when a 1965 oil agreement granting oil
 and gas concessions to France in return for aid in
 industrial development and exploration came up for
 renegotiation in 1970. The Algerian Government
 claimed that France was not fulfilling all of its
 obligations in connection with exploration, industrial
 development, and the import of Algerian gas into
 France.
 In July 1970, Algeria unilaterally announced an
 increase in the tax-reference price 16 of oil from $2.08
 to $2.85 per barrel. In the fall of 1970, Algeria raised
 this to $3.00 and by the end of the year was demand-
 ing $3.24. Futhermore, Algeria asserted that the price
 issue was secondary to this objective of taking over
 control of oil production from the French companies
 involved. After protracted negotiations, the Algerian
 Government broke the deadlock in February 1971 and
 unilaterally announced that it would take over 51
 percent of French oil production-accounting for
 about 70 percent of total Algerian crude oil produc-
 tion-and all pipelines and gas wells in the country.
 According to press reports, the French Government
 initially decided to make the best of the situation and
 seek the highest possible remuneration for seizures.
 Following fruitless talks between the two govern-
 ments, however, Algeria announced in April 1971
 that:
 ? It was raising its oil price to $3.60 per barrel (the
 highest price of any oil producer in the world).
 ? It would pay only $100 million to French oil
 companies as compensation for the 51-percent take-
 over of their assets (about a seventh of what the
 French companies had estimated their lost assets to
 be worth and a third of what they were willing to
 settle for).
 ? It was ending all foreign-owned concessions in
 Algeria.
 The French Government responded by cutting off
 negotiations with the Algerian Government, and the
 French companies involved-the state-owned Elf-
 Erap and the 35-percent-state-owned French Petro-
 leum Company (CFP)-suspended their liftings of
 Algerian oil.
 Objective of the Sanctions
 The objective of the sanctions was to force the
 Algerian Government to reconsider compensation
 terms and the tax-reference price of oil. The French
 calculated that their actions would lead to an immedi-
 ate drop in revenue. The French companies involved
 produced in 1970 some 660,000 b/d of crude oil out of
 a total Algerian production of 976,000 b/d.
 Description of the Sanctions
 The French boycott campaign cost the Algerians a
 production drop of at least 25 percent in 1971. In
 addition to suspending their lifting of Algerian oil, the
 companies took action on the international oil market
 by issuing warnings that they would sue any buyers of
 oil from the fields seized by Algeria, which they

 Secret
 considered to be their property. The French Govern-
 ment also approached the World Bank, from which
 the Algerian state oil firm Sonatrach was seeking
 financing for petroleum development, to block any
 extension of credits. Finally, it appealed to the United
 States to forgo a planned purchase of gas from
 Sonatrach until the oil dispute was settled.
 Factors Affecting the Success
 or Failure of Sanctions
 The effectiveness of the French sanctions was under-
 mined by developments in the world oil market, where
 rising prices enabled the Algerians largely to offset
 the losses resulting from production cutbacks. More-
 over, the French could not win the full support of their
 allies. Although the United States proved willing to
 delay the purchase of Algerian gas by the Texas El
 Paso firm-a decision also influenced by the high
 Algerian asking price-both US and British firms
 reached agreements with Sonatrach on the exploita-
 tion of their own, smaller oil concessions in Algeria.
 French determination to uphold the sanctions was
 eroded by the disproportionate cost of the measures to
 their own interests. Before the imposition of sanctions,
 Algerian oil accounted for 25 percent of total domes-
 tic consumption. French energy policy, which did not
 provide well for alternative sources of supply, made it
 difficult for France to find quickly oil substitutes to
 make up for the Algerian shortfall. The loss of the
 Algerian oilfields was particularly serious for the Elf-
 Erap firm, for which the fields represented 80 percent
 of total production. In addition, the sanctions strained
 Franco-Algerian trade relations generally and encour-
 aged Algeria, which had relied heavily on trade with
 France, to diversify its trading partners (for example,
 by developing prospects for large-scale exports of oil
 and gas to the United States). The sanctions also
 strained the "special relationship" between Algeria
 and France. This was of special concern to France
 since Paris considered Algeria an important link to
 the Arab world.
 The net result of these converging pressures was the
 collapse of the sanctions. CFP agreed to Algerian
 terms in June 1971, followed by Elf-Erap in Decem-
 ber of that year. CFP settled for a share of oil
 amounting to half its 1970 production, and Elf-Erap      25X1
 agreed to accept a share equal to only one-third of its
 prenationalization production. Four small companies
 agreed to withdraw completely from the Algerian
 industry. Compensation for the nationalization was
 close to Algeria's original terms. The tax-reference
 price was raised from $2.90 to $2.95 per barrel, with a
 provision for renegotiation after five years.
 Sonatrach, on the other hand, emerged as the 10th-
 most important oil producing company in the world.
 Algeria itself has emerged as one of the leading price
 hawks in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
 Countries (OPEC). Its victory over sanctions in 1971
 almost certainly contributed to this aggressiveness.F
 In the French boycott of Algerian oil almost none of
 the factors needed for successful sanctions was
 present:
 ? France was not Algeria's only customer and could
 not gain the full support of the others.
 ? France's commitment to the sanctions was eroded
 because it could not readily replace Algerian oil,
 which was a significant portion of French supplies,
 and because the sanctions strained the "special
 relationship" with Algeria, which Paris considered a
 key link to the Arab world.
 ? The cost of the sanctions to Algeria was minimal
 because rising world oil prices enabled the Algerians
 to offset most of the revenue loss resulting from the
 reduction in export volume.
 ? The Algerian Government remained strongly com-
 mitted to taking over control of its oil production.F

 OAPEC Oil Embargo Against
 the United States (1973-74)
 Background to the Sanctions
 members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum
 Exporting Countries (OAPEC) " sufficient financial
 The Arab oil exporting nations embargoed the United
 States during and after the 1967 Middle East war,
 but the embargo was not effective. The United States
 used its domestic spare capacity in conjunction with
 stepped-up imports from non-Arab oil producers to
 meet its oil requirements. The Arabs were unable to
 withstand the loss of oil revenue for an extended
 period and soon lifted the embargo.
 By October 1973, however, the United States had
 become vulnerable to an Arab embargo. Three impor-
 tant developments had taken place:
 ? US oil demand increased steeply while domestic
 production fell.
 ? Increased world oil demand reduced world spare
 capacity.
 ? Oil prices quadrupled.
 Between 1967 and 1973 the US energy-intensive
 industries boomed, and, because environmental laws
 and federal regulation limited the mining and use of
 coal, the construction of nuclear power plants, and
 natural gas production, most of the increased energy
 demand was for oil. US oil output peaked in 1970 and
 fell thereafter; Arab oil imports rose as a result. F_
 Until 1970 world oil supply usually exceeded demand.
 In the early 1970s, however, the economies of the
 major industrial countries expanded simultaneously
 and soaked up the excess supply. The surge in oil
 demand and growing assertiveness by OPEC revolu-
 tionized oil pricing. In 1971 producer governments
 forced the oil companies to raise oil prices. Then, on
 16 October 1973, OPEC unilaterally hiked the price
 from $3.01 to $5.12 a barrel. Demand continued to
 outrun supply, and three months later OPEC raised
 the price to $11.65. Oil revenues flowed into produc-
 ing countries at unprecedented rates, giving the

 reserves to withstand a prolonged embargo.
 Description of the Sanctions
 On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt invaded Israeli-
 occupied Arab territory. Israel suffered military re-
 versals in the first days of the war and asked the
 United States to resupply it with arms.
 On 17 October the members of OAPEC decided to:
 (1) embargo the United States, (2) shut in the oil
 normally shipped to the United States and reduce
 production an additional 5 percent, (3) determine an
 importer's access to Arab oil according to its level of
 support for the Arab cause, and (4) make further
 monthly production cuts of 5 percent until Israel
 relinquished all Arab territory."
 On 18 October the United States announced that it
 would resupply Israel with arms. Saudi Arabia, which
 had counseled OAPEC to be moderate, reacted by
 reducing its oil production an additional 5 percent and
 assuming leadership of the embargo.
 OAPEC governments ordered foreign oil companies
 to enforce the embargo and threatened them with
 expropriation and other punitive measures if they
 failed to comply. To ensure compliance, OAPEC
 members required tanker captains loading Arab oil to
 sign affidavits designating their destination and to
 cable back upon arrival. Arab diplomats abroad also
 checked public records of oil imports. OAPEC mem-
 bers did not establish a mechanism to monitor each

 Secret
 other's observance of the boycott; nonetheless, virtual-
 ly no Arab oil reached the United States during the
 embargo.
 OAPEC members stated three objectives for the
 sanctions:
 ? To express their anger at the United States for
 assisting Israel.
 ? To demonstrate solidarity with Egypt and Syria.
 ? To make the United States press Israel to return
 Arab land.
 The act of imposing sanctions allowed OAPEC to
 accomplish the first two objectives. As to the third,
 Egypt regained sovereignty over some of its territory
 while the sanctions were in effect, but the United
 States did not ask Israel to make territorial conces-
 sions in order to induce the Arabs to lift the embargo.
 The OAPEC linkage between the sanctions and repa-
 triation of Arab land loosened after the war ended in
 late October. Saudi Arabia, the largest oil exporter
 and the key to maintaining the embargo, indicated
 that total Israeli withdrawal was not a condition for
 lifting the sanctions. It did insist, however, that Israeli
 withdrawal begin.
 In November 1973 the United States launched a
 diplomatic effort to disengage Arab and Israeli forces.
 Egypt and Israel concluded an agreement in mid-
 January 1974 that required Israel to pull back in the
 Sinai. Henry Kissinger, who mediated the agreement,
 asserts in his memoirs that the sanctions did not
 influence US diplomacy. Israeli Defense Minister
 Moshe Dayan's memoirs corroborate Kissinger's
 statements.
 The United States felt that the agreement met the
 Saudi condition for ending the embargo. Syria, how-
 ever, quickly petitioned the Saudis to extend the
 embargo until the United States attempted a Syrian-
 Israeli disengagement. The United States refused to
 commence negotiations while the embargo was in
 effect. In February an Arab summit conference
 offered a compromise-OAPEC would agree to end
 the embargo if the United States sent a diplomatic
 mission to assess the prospects for a Syrian-Israeli
 disengagement. The United States agreed, and
 OAPEC lifted the embargo on 19 March 1974.F-
 The Arab sanctions led to widespread fuel shortages
 in the United States. The sanctions had an impact
 because non-Arab exporters did not have sufficient
 spare capacity to compensate for Arab production        25X1
 cutbacks and the Arabs had the financial reserves to
 maintain the embargo for an extended period.
 Three factors, however, mitigated the sanctions'
 impact:
 ? The oil companies used their worldwide transporta-
 tion and marketing networks to reallocate the avail-
 able oil. By diverting some non-Arab oil from
 Europe and Japan to the United States and replac-      25X1
 ing it with OAPEC production, they protected the
 United States from the maximum oil loss possible.
 ? At the time, US dependence on Arab oil was
 modest. The sanctions cost the United States 1.3
 million b/d of oil, or 8 percent of its total oil
 consumption. The American people experienced dis-
 comfort but not hardship."
 ? The US commitment to Israel had broad support.
 Throughout the embargo, the public never pressed
 the government to change its Middle Eastern policy
 to meet Arab demands.
 The embargo awakened the United States to the costs     25X1
 of importing substantial amounts of oil. During and
 after the embargo, the United States began making
 major adjustments in its domestic and foreign policies
 " The oil companies' allocation measures caused Western Europe to
 lose about 12 percent of its total oil consumption; they permitted

 to try to reduce its vulnerability to future sanctions.
 The United States:
 ? Initiated a variety of programs to conserve energy,
 develop synthetic fuels, and increase oil, gas, and
 coal production.
 ? Helped create the International Energy Agency to
 foster energy cooperation among the industrial oil-
 importing countries.
 ? Assumed a more active role in the Middle East to
 prevent a diplomatic stalemate that could trigger
 another war and renewed sanctions.
 The embargo had a powerful demonstrational effect
 on other industrial countries. Most were heavy con-
 sumers of Arab oil and lacked the capacity to reduce
 their dependence substantially. Western Europe and
 Japan waged vigorous diplomatic campaigns to culti-
 vate OPEC members, and, as a result, they voiced
 greater support for Arab positions.
 The sanctions greatly enhanced the international
 prestige of the Arab oil exporters and OPEC in
 general. OAPEC had used oil to punish a military
 superpower with impunity. The less developed coun-
 tries saw it as a turning point in international rela-
 tions. They soon enlisted OPEC support in an attempt
 to make the industrial countries create a "new inter-
 national economic order" favorable to the Third
 World.
 In terms of its effectiveness, the OAPEC oil embargo
 on the United States presented a paradox. Few of the
 elements needed for achieving substantial economic
 impact were present:
 ? The Arab oil exporters were not able to control the
 supply of oil to the United States.
 ? The United States was able to adjust to the embar-
 go with relatively little economic dislocation.

 Yet, OAPEC members could legitimately claim that
 the embargo met their objectives:
 ? The goals of expressing anger at the United States
 and demonstrating solidarity with Syria and Egypt
 were symbolic and easily met by imposing the
 embargo.
 ? The goal of making the United States pressure
 Israel to return Arab land was also largely symbolic

 end.

 US Sanctions Against
 Pakistan (1977-80)
 Background to the Sanctions
 The imposition of sanctions against Pakistan in the
 late 1970s involves a number of factors that appear to
 make it a special case. First, the objective on the part
 of the US Government was highly specific-to dis-
 courage the Pakistani military regime from pursuing
 a nuclear weapons program. Other aspects of Islama-
 bad's foreign and security policies, or even its domes-
 tic politics and human rights record, were not relevant
 to the decision to impose sanctions. Second, the
 sanctions were diverse, involving not only the prohibi-
 tion of all nuclear cooperation but also the termina-
 tion of US Government assistance in the areas of
 military and economic aid. Third, some of the sanc-
 tions have been removed while other restrictions still
 remain in effect. The prohibition against nuclear
 cooperation is still in force, but economic and military
 assistance programs involving or requiring US Gov-
 ernment financial support resumed as of December
 1981.
 A crucial factor that complicates any long-term as-
 sessment is that developments in the Pakistani nuclear
 program could trigger the reimposition of economic
 and military sanctions within a short period of time.
 The rationale and legal foundation for the original
 sanctions remain operative. US political leaders can
 authorize a total embargo on assistance programs any
 time the pace of the Pakistani nuclear program seems
 to warrant this step. The possibility of a reimposition
 of economic and military sanctions could still influ-
 ence the decisionmaking process within the Pakistani
 regime concerning the immediate need for a nuclear
 weapons device.
 The Sanctions: Origin and Scope
 The imposition of sanctions against Pakistan in 1978
 and 1979 was an outgrowth of the broad
 Congressional-Executive effort in the period 1976-78
 to codify laws governing nuclear exports and to make
 US nonproliferation policy more stringent. The rele-
 vant US legislation does not single out Pakistan, but
 growing concern about the direction of the Pakistani
 nuclear program was an important factor in stimulat-
 ing proposals for tougher laws on nuclear transfers to
 nonnuclear weapons states. The French decision in
 early 1976 to sell Pakistan a commercial-scale repro-
 cessing plant was a major turning point. The Ford and
 Carter administrations put considerable pressure on
 the French Government to cancel the contract even
 though Pakistan had agreed to place the facility under
 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safe-
 guards. In June 1978 Paris informed Washington that
 French firms would withdraw from the reprocessing
 plant project. We believe this step was taken not in
 response to US wishes but primarily because of the
 risks in being associated with the nuclear weapons
 ambitions of a rightwing military regime
 US Government efforts to restrict relations with
 Pakistan were based on the following legislation:
 ? The Symington and Glenn Amendments to the
 Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.
 ? The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978.
 The fundamental purpose of this legislation was to
 pose the threat of sanctions in order to persuade states
 that had not already ratified the Non-Proliferation
 Treaty to accept IAEA safeguards over their entire
 nuclear program and refrain from procurement activi-
 ties that could contribute to a nuclear weapons pro-
 gram. Congress and the Executive Branch were essen-
 tially in agreement on these basic goals, although
 opinions varied about the ultimate motives of poten-
 tial proliferators such as Pakistan.
 The prohibition against all nuclear cooperation with
 Pakistan resulted from the automatic application of
 section 128 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of
 1978. This section stipulates that there can be no
 nuclear exports to any nonnuclear weapons state that
 has not placed all its nuclear activities under IAEA

 safeguards at the time of export. Islamabad's long-
 standing refusal to accept safeguards on all its exist-
 ing nuclear facilities required ipso facto the total and
 immediate ban on US nuclear transfers to Pakistan."
 This prohibition took effect when the Act came into
 force on 10 March 1978.
 Termination of economic and military assistance to
 Pakistan resulted from the Glenn and Symington
 Amendments. The Glenn Amendment to the Foreign
 Assistance Act requires such sanctions against any
 nonnuclear weapons state that acquires unsafeguard-
 ed reprocessing technology or detonates a nuclear
 device. This amendment was never formally invoked,
 but the US Government ordered a winding down of
 economic aid in 1977 in reaction to the French-
 Pakistani reprocessing plant project. Economic assis-
 tance was resumed for the period 1978-79 after the
 French decision to withdraw from the reprocessing
 project.
 The eventual termination of all US Government
 economic and military assistance to Pakistan resulted
 from the application of the Symington Amendment.
 This amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act stipu-
 lates that a nonnuclear weapons state that has ob-
 tained uranium enrichment technology outside IAEA
 safeguards can no longer receive economic or military
 assistance from the United States. Discovery of evi-
 dence of the existence of Islamabad's clandestine
 enrichment facility near Kahuta led to the imposition
 of economic and military sanctions for nearly three
 years beginning in March 1979.
 There were three publicly stated objectives for the
 imposition of sanctions on Pakistan:
 ? To discourage\the Pakistani military regime from
 pursuing a nuclear weapons program.
 ? To slow development of the program by persuading
 other nuclear weapons states not to export sensitive
 nuclear materials, equipment, and technology to
 Pakistan.
 ? To demonstrate that the United States would with-
 hold nuclear cooperation and economic and military
 aid from a nonnuclear state that is attempting to
 develop nuclear weapons.
 In our judgment, the imposition of the sanctions failed
 to achieve the first objective. Pakistani President Zia
 and his top military advisers were not deterred from
 their fundamental objective of obtaining a nuclear
 weapons capability. Islamabad steadfastly resisted
 safeguards over its entire nuclear program, and Paki-
 stani scientists continued efforts to develop both re-
 processing and enrichment technology-the two
 routes to a nuclear weapons capability. Moreover,
 there was no incentive to slow the effort to develop a
 nuclear weapons capability once it became evident
 that the United States wished to resume economic
 and military aid to Pakistan in the wake of the Soviet
 invasion of Afghanistan. Although the nuclear sanc-
 tions remain in effect, economic and military aid
 resumed as of December 1981.
 On a political level, the military regime in Islamabad
 appeared to reap additional public support in the wave
 of reaction against the US sanctions in 1979. The
 Pakistani leaders felt no compelling need to rely on
 the United States prior to the Soviet invasion of
 Afghanistan later that year. They had taken steps to
 develop strong ties to China following the downturn in
 US-Pakistani relations in the mid-1960s. In the
 1970s, Pakistan also looked more to moderate Arab
 states and Iran for financial assistance and to Europe-
 an suppliers for arms.
 there was virtually no visible public pressure to restore
 relations with the United States, given the uneven
 history of bilateral relations and the widespread belief
 among Pakistanis that the United States had failed
 them in two wars with India

 Secret
 The sanctions appear to have reinforced Islamabad's
 doubts about the credibility of the US security com-
 mitment to Pakistan as enunciated in the defense
 cooperation agreement of 1959.2)
 the termination of US military
 assistance,  anyt ing, confirmed Pakistan's intention
 to develop a nuclear weapons capability. Islamabad
 regards such a capability as the ultimate guarantor of
 its security against India, whose conventional suprem-
 acy and nuclear potential it cannot hope to match.
 With the United States unavailable as a counter to
 India and the Chinese unable to supply sophisticated
 arms, Islamabad placed a high value on nuclear
 weapons as an effective deterrent that was attainable
 with Pakistan's technological and financial resources.
 The cutoff in US economic aid occurred at a time
 when Pakistan's foreign payments position was be-
 coming increasingly precarious following several years
 of heavy borrowing. Foreign exchange reserves had
 dropped by one-half between December 1978 and
 July 1979 to $183 million and continued to slide to a
 mid-September low of $77 million, roughly one week's
 import coverage. While US aid was small in relation
 to Pakistan's needs-scheduled 1979 disbursements
 of $130 million versus a financial gap of $1.3 billion-
 it was provided on very soft terms. Nevertheless, after
 vaguely threatening to default on debt service pay-
 ments in an effort to secure a new debt rescheduling
 agreement from a group of Western creditors, Paki-
 stan was able to bolster its international reserves by
 negotiating short-term credits from foreign private
 banks and soliciting emergency assistance from Saudi
 Arabia.
 Despite the lack of US aid, by June 1980 Islamabad
 had covered its foreign payments gap and increased
 foreign exchange reserves to nearly $700 million.
 Islamabad used planned and emergency aid from
 Saudi Arabia, a $163 million trust fund loan from the
 IMF, and short-term funds borrowed against export
 earnings of the next rice crop. Moreover, good crops,
 1' President Zia ridiculed a tentative US offer in early 1980 to
 provide $400 million in emergency economic and military aid
 following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This offer was made
 by the Carter administration without having obtained Congres-
 sional approval to waive the restrictions under the Symington
 strong export growth, and several key economic policy
 reforms enabled the economy to grow by 6 percent in
 FY 1980 for the third consecutive year. Pakistan
 reduced its current account deficit in both 1980 and
 1981.
 Military Assistance
 The termination of military aid probably reduced US
 influence within the Pakistani military establishment
 as a result of the suspension of the International
 Military Education and Training (IMET) program for
 promising officers, but it had no appreciable effect on
 Pakistan's military capabilities. The amount of US
 arms supplied to Islamabad after 1965 was negligible
 and largely paid for in cash. Since the US arms
 embargo during the 1965 Indian-Pakistani war,
 China and France had become Pakistan's principal
 arms suppliers. From FY 1966 through FY 1979,
 Pakistan purchased less than $430 million in military
 equipment from the United States, much of it spare
 parts and ammunition for older US weapons. The
 only significant military items purchased from the
 United States during this time were TOW antitank
 missiles and M- 113 armored personnel carriers,
 bought in 1975 and 1976.
 The Symington Amendment did not preclude cash
 military sales. Even before the sanctions were applied,
 only $7.6 million of Pakistan's total arms purchases
 from the United States were funded by Foreign
 Military Sales (FMS) credits, and none have been
 since FY 1968. Pakistan signed cash FMS agree-
 ments worth $88 million in FY 1980 and FY 1981
 after the Symington Amendment sanctions were ap-
 plied, but only for spare parts, ammunition, and
 support equipment. Moreover, the Symington Amend-
 ment did not preclude the delivery of military equip-
 ment already purchased. Pakistan received about
 $130 million in military equipment, including TOWs
 and armored personnel carriers from FMS agree-
 ments concluded before the sanctions.

 Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 went into force. The
 main effect of the Act's prohibition of nuclear trans-
 fers to Pakistan fell on the US voluntary contribution
 in cash and kind to the IAEA, an annual gift used to
 finance technical assistance and training programs for
 developing nations. Since the contribution was funded
 under the Foreign Assistance Act, the United States
 decided that the provisions of the Symington Amend-
 ment made Pakistan ineligible for any US funds
 provided via the IAEA on a country-specific basis.
 This assistance included the provision of experts, gifts
 of equipment for laboratory facilities, and fellowships
 for the study of nuclear-energy-related subjects in the
 United States. The training and technical assistance
 that the United States denied to Pakistan through the
 IAEA was instead provided by European countries.
 The United States has succeeded to a considerable
 extent, however, in meeting its secondary objective of
 making it more difficult for Pakistan to achieve a
 nuclear weapons capability. Washington continued
 efforts to persuade other nuclear supplier states not to
 export sensitive nuclear materials, equipment, and
 technology to Pakistan-efforts that would not have
 been credible in the absence of US nuclear sanctions.
 This attempt to win support for tighter export controls
 was a source of tension and disagreement with other
 nuclear suppliers for a number of reasons:
 ? Several West European countries as a matter of
 policy are opposed to trade restrictions even with
 regard to nuclear transfers to a potential
 proliferator.
 ? Few West European countries accepted the princi-
 ple that a nonnuclear item should be controlled on
 the basis that it could contribute to a nuclear
 weapons program. As a result, the United States has
 found it difficult to interdict trade with Pakistan
 involving dual-use equipment or gray-area
 technology.
 ? Other nuclear supplier states have until recently
 resisted US efforts to make the export control lists
 more precise and more comprehensive. The London
 Suppliers Guidelines, in many instances, are too
 vague to serve as a useful guide to the implementa-
 tion of export control policy.
 ? Some countries have not been willing to devote the
 law enforcement resources needed to prevent Paki-
 stan from operating a clandestine procurement net-
 work in Western Europe. Through the use of inter-
 mediaries, false shipping addresses, dummy
 companies, and other techniques, Pakistan has been
 able to conceal in many instances that it is the
 ultimate user of items being bought.
 Nevertheless, Pakistan is less prepared to explode a
 nuclear device at this time than it would have been
 had Islamabad been free to advance its nuclear
 program through open procurement and trade. A
 number of nuclear supplier states were sensitive to the
 issue of nuclear cooperation with Pakistan and took
 steps to prevent some sensitive nuclear transfers. As a
 result, Islamabad is now almost totally dependent on
 the clandestine procurement network. The completion
 of the enrichment and reprocessing facilities designed
 to produce weapons-grade nuclear material was sig-
 nificantly delayed.
 The United States is still trying to get Pakistan to
 accept safeguards on all its nuclear facilities. Wash-
 ington has urged other nuclear supplier states not to
 submit bids for Pakistan's new nuclear power reactor
 without the stipulation that Islamabad accept "full-
 scope" safeguards. Several Western governments,
 however, have made it clear to the United States that
 they fear they might be undercut by competitors at
 the last moment and lose the contract. Nevertheless,
 the concern about Pakistan's unsafeguarded facilities
 and the IAEA's inability to maintain effective safe-
 guards at Pakistan's only power reactor near Karachi
 is now widespread. There are no international legal
 obligations for any nuclear supplier to insist on full-
 scope safeguards, but failure to make this demand of
 Pakistan at this point would expose the supplier state
 to considerable criticism.
 years to bear fruit.
 Pakistan's leaders are not likely to relinquish their
 objective of obtaining a nuclear weapons option even
 if the United States succeeds in fashioning a united
 supplier front on the issue of full-scope safeguards.
 However, the rejection of full-scope safeguards would
 seriously impede Pakistan's plans for a larger nuclear
 power program. The Pakistanis could and probably
 would turn to other developing nations with nuclear
 expertise for assistance, but this strategy would take

 The US sanctions against Pakistan did not halt
 Pakistan's nuclear program, but the fact that the
 United States took tangible action and reinforced it
 with efforts to sensitize other nuclear supplier states
 has caused Islamabad to be almost totally dependent
 on the clandestine procurement network and has
 slowed development of its nuclear program.
 The sanctions imposed under provisions of the Foreign
 Assistance Act did not have a major impact on
 Pakistan's military preparedness or economic develop-
 ment:
 ? Pakistan was able to adjust to the absence of US aid
 for the short period of its suspension in part because
 other donors, including multilateral institutions sup-
 ported by the United States, provided alternate
 sources of military and economic aid.
 ? The Government of Pakistan was willing to forgo
 US assistance in order to continue its efforts to
 develop nuclear weapons because it perceived nucle-
 ar weapons as a vital element in its national
 security.
 ? Imposition of US sanctions in a highly visible way
 increased domestic support for the Government of
 Pakistan, thus easing the political cost of the for-
 gone aid.

 US Trade Sanctions
 Against Uganda (1978)
 Background to the Sanctions
 The United States imposed trade sanctions against
 Uganda in October 1978 in response to a lengthy
 series of human rights violations by Ugandan Presi-
 dent Idi Amin. According to US estimates, Amin had
 murdered nearly 100,000 people-including two
 American reporters-since seizing power in a military
 coup in 1971. He also had expelled almost all of
 Uganda's 60,000-member Asian community, crip-
 pling the country's domestic trade.
 The decision to impose sanctions capped a yearlong
 campaign by a small group of congressmen who in
 September 1977 introduced three bills to terminate all
 trade between the United States and Uganda. State-
 ments in The Congressional Record indicate particu-
 lar concern about US purchases of Ugandan coffee-
 half of Kampala's total coffee exports at the time-
 which were cited as an important element in Amin's
 ability to stay in power. The statements also pointed
 out the role of US companies in supplying nearly 40
 percent of Uganda's oil imports, in constructing a
 telecommunications satellite system, and in providing
 civilian jet aircraft and pilot training. According to
 Ugandan statistics, the United States was Uganda's
 largest trading partner in 1977, accounting for nearly
 one-third of the value of Kampala's international
 transactions
 Efforts to obtain approval of embargo legislation were
 held up by the lack of support in both Congress and
 the White House.
 President Carter's opposition to Ugandan sanctions
 was based on a number of factors:
 ? The United States had already demonstrated its
 distaste for the Amin regime by closing its Embassy
 in Kampala and suspending all official US
 assistance.
 ? Washington was monitoring Ugandan trade by re-
 quiring the Departments of State and Commerce to
 review US export licenses and determine whether
 the export item would contribute to human rights
 violations.
 ? Amin might retaliate by taking measures threaten-
 ing the safety of the 200 Americans still in Uganda.
 ? Economic sanctions would be ineffective and incon-
 sistent with the principle of free trade.
 Over the next several months, however, an intensive
 anti-Amin campaign by the American media gradual-
 ly aroused public opinion in favor of sanctions, with a
 similar impact on Congress.
 Provisions and Objectives of the Sanctions
 The sanctions contained in Public Law 95-455 of 10
 October 1978, applied to nearly all US trade with
 Uganda and directed that:
 ? No article-including technical data or other infor-
 mation-except grains and additional foodstuffs
 could be exported to Uganda by anyone subject to
 the jurisdiction of the United States.
 ? No article grown, produced, or manufactured in
 Uganda could be imported into the United States.
 These proscriptions were to remain in effect until the
 President certified to Congress that the Government
 of Uganda was "no longer engaged in a consistent
 pattern of gross violations of human rights."
 While an end to human rights violations in Uganda
 was the stated objective of the sanctions, we believe
 the congressional testimony on the legislation indi-
 cates that there was a major unstated objective as
 well. That goal was to put enough pressure on the
 Ugandan economy to undercut Amin's control and
 thereby result in his ouster.

 Uganda was in desperate financial straits during this
 period, and, being landlocked, it was dependent on the
 pro-US government of neighboring Kenya for its
 international trade. Most of the modern sector of the
 economy had long since shut down, following the
 expulsion of Asians and Amin's indiscriminate perse-
 cution of Ugandan professionals. Agriculture kept the
 economy going, but production had been declining as
 farmers reduced output to subsistence levels.
 Despite its economic problems and heavy dependence
 on the US market, Uganda suffered little from the
 US trade sanctions. Ugandan officials had been
 aware for some time of official US sentiment regard-
 ing Amin's policies because of the steps taken by the
 Carter administration and the discussions in Con-
 gress. According to Embassy sources, Ugandan en-
 voys were visiting numerous Western and other coun-
 tries as early as January 1978 to line up new
 customers for coffee and other products. Indeed, by
 the time sanctions were in place, US companies had
 almost completely ended commercial dealings with
 Kampala. In addition, the Kenyan Government con-
 tinued to provide transit for Ugandan trade. Official
 data indicate Ugandan efforts to locate other buyers
 were largely successful-export receipts during the
 embargo showed no change from the similar period
 immediately preceding the sanctions. Most of the
 slack was taken up by other Third World countries,
 although Japan, the United Kingdom, West Germa-
 ny, and Italy also stepped up purchases somewhat (see

 Nyerere's decision to opt for a direct military cam-

 believed the sanctions were a sign that the interna-

 On the surface, the US trade sanctions against Ugan-
 da had little going for them:
 ? The United States was unable to gain the coopera-
 tion of other governments in shutting off trade.
 ? Uganda was able to find other suppliers and buyers
 of most of the goods traded with the United States.
 Yet, the sanctions ultimately-even if indirectly-

 the Ugandan Government because of the political
 impact they had in a third country. President Nyerere
 of Tanzania interpreted the sanctions to mean that
 the international community would not oppose his
 invasion of Uganda to remove Amin by force.

 US Sanctions Against
 Iran (1980-81)
 Origin and Scope of the Sanctions
 The United States imposed economic sanctions
 against Iran as part of a larger diplomatic strategy to
 force the release of the American hostages seized by
 Iranian militants on 4 November 1979. The immedi-
 ate objective of the sanctions was to create sufficient
 economic pressure on Iran to force it to release the
 hostages.
 Three days after the US Embassy was taken, Presi-
 dent Carter ordered a halt to all US oil imports from
 Iran. As the crisis dragged on, the administration also
 blocked all Iranian assets under US control and
 informally curtailed some exports to Iran-particular-
 ly military equipment already paid for by Tehran. US
 impatience with Khomeini's intransigence with re-
 spect to settlement proposals from both Washington
 and the United Nations culminated in Carter's formal
 prohibition on 7 April 1980 of all exports to Iran
 except food and medicine. In fact, a de facto trade
 embargo was already in place because US longshore-
 men had earlier refused to load cargo-even food-
 bound for Iran.
 The most controversial US sanction was the blocking
 of all Iranian assets in the United States and those
 under the control of US banks, businesses, and indi-
 viduals outside the United States. The objectives of
 this action were, initially, to protect US asset claims
 from Iranian default and, later, to pressure Iran to
 release the hostages. The US decision froze about $12
 billion of Iran's bank deposits, gold, and other proper-
 ty under US control; about $5.6 billion of these
 deposits and securities were held in overseas branches
 of US banks, mostly in the United Kingdom. By
 taking the extraordinary step of obstructing the use of
 these overseas accounts, the United States doubled
 the amount of Iranian assets it could immobilize-
 including nearly one-half of Iran's official foreign
 exchange reserves.
 To make the sanctions work, the United States needed
 the cooperation of its allies. To this end, US repre-
 sentatives visited several European countries to dis-
 cuss the sanctions from the outset of the crisis. The
 United States also asked the UN Security Council in
 January 1980 to adopt restrictions on trade and
 financial transactions with Tehran, and in April Sec-
 retary of State Vance met in Washington with repre-
 sentatives from 25 countries to seek a commitment to
 the sanctions.
 Concerned about their own self-interest and the wis-
 dom of Washington's hardline economic position, the
 allies' response was less than enthusiastic. They
 feared the sanctions would threaten their substantial
 contractual arrangements with Iran and generally
 were skeptical that sanctions would force Tehran to
 free the hostages. Japan and, to a lesser extent,
 Western Europe counted on Iran to meet oil import
 needs. Following the Soviet veto of the UN resolution,
 the EC and Japan reluctantly adopted a diluted
 version of the sanctions they had earlier approved
 during the Security Council discussion.
 Although some allies gave tacit approval to the assets
 freeze, they never did agree to the tougher measures
 that Washington wanted them to impose. Generally,
 the EC agreed at its ministerial meeting in May 1980
 to ban:
 ? All export contracts retroactive to 4 November
 1979, excluding food and medicine.
 ? All new industrial service contracts.
 ? All new supplier credits, loans, or credit guarantees.
 The EC measures also included some financial restric-
 tions on Iranian bank accounts and on the purchase of
 Iranian oil at prices sharply higher than the OPEC
 benchmark. Japan announced similar sanctions in
 June 1980. These sanctions did not block Iranian
 assets in the allies' banks, contained loopholes, and
 were not strictly enforced. Moreover, neither the EC
 nor Japan embargoed oil imports from Iran.

 Secret
 Domestic Impact of the Sanctions
 The rationale for the economic sanctions was Iran's
 heavy dependence on foreign trade. In 1979 the
 United States was Tehran's second-largest source of
 imports, following West Germany; the member coun-
 tries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
 and Development (OECD) accounted for about 70
 percent of Iran's imports in 1979. Iran relied on
 imports to meet most of its requirements for capital
 goods, industrial raw materials, military equipment,
 and consumer goods. Iran's most critical import needs
 at the time of the sanctions were for food and for
 spare parts for the oil industry.
 The economic sanctions apparently had no effect on
 Iran's decision to hold the hostages. Khomeini's re-
 sponse to the sanctions was even more caustic than his
 usual criticisms of the United States. Khomeini re-
 portedly appeared ecstatic over Carter's break of
 diplomatic relations, calling it a "final victory" for
 Iran. His control of this emotionally charged issue
 was so great that Iranians were probably willing to
 suffer (or could be coerced into suffering) economic
 costs far in excess of those exacted by the sanctions. If
 anything, the hostage crisis consolidated the revolu-
 tion in the hands of Khomeini and the clerics.
 The sanctions exacerbated economic problems in
 some sectors of the economy but did not inflict major
 new hardships or create insurmountable difficulties.
 Tehran managed to find alternative sources for many
 denied goods-albeit at much higher prices. In other
 cases, Iran either rationed commodities or fell back on
 inventories. Because of the generally depressed state
 of the economy, Iran probably would have cut back on
 imports of most trade categories, in any event.
 The only sector of the economy to suffer notably from
 US economic sanctions was the transportation sector,
 which faced a critical shortage of spare parts. By June
 1980 about half of the civil aircraft fleet-composed
 mostly of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft-
 lacked sufficient spare parts. The railroads also were
 in desperate need of spare parts for their US-made
 locomotives. Iran suffered a general shortage of car
 and truck parts as well.
 Stopping the supply of oilfield equipment to Iran did
 not substantially affect already depressed crude out-
 put. The revolution had put the petroleum industry in
 disarray; the oilworker strike from January to March
 1979 and Khomeini's decision to lower oil exports
 caused oil production to tumble 40 percent to an
 average of 3.2 million b/d for 1979. During most of
 1980 the high price for Iranian oil in the face of a soft
 world oil market was the main reason oil exports fell
 further to about 1.6 million b/d; the other reason was
 Iraqi war damage. Nonetheless, Iran had sufficient
 spare parts and excess capacity to keep its oilfields
 and refineries operating at these reduced levels of
 production without US equipment or technology; even
 with the sanctions, oil industry equipment often could
 be obtained legally from third parties and foreign
 subsidiaries of US companies.
 Oil income of about $33 million a day gave Iran the
 financial wherewithal to cope with the sanctions. Even
 without US oil purchases, Iran's oil earnings-which
 accounted for virtually all Iran's income-were more
 than sufficient to cover the import bill in 1980, which
 was up 34 percent from 1979. Although oil exports to
 other developed nations also declined, these countries
 still provided an important market for Iran's oil.
 Iran easily circumvented US and EC sanctions on
 trade. Increased food shipments from France, Germa-
 ny, and Australia more than made up for the loss in
 US foodstuffs, which had accounted for about one-
 fifth of Iran's food purchases abroad before the
 sanctions. Food imports from the OECD in 1980 rose
 30 percent over 1979 to $1.2 billion. Tehran also
 turned to the Third World for new sources of food.
 Several West European, Japanese, and even US firms
 traded embargoed goods with Iran in violation of the
 sanctions, usually through intermediary firms in the
 United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Supply arrange-
 ments covered a wide range of industrial goods,
 capital equipment, and chemicals, all of which fell
 under the sanctions. US involvement included the sale
 of goods such as engine parts, tires, appliances, and
 drilling rigs.

 The blocking of financial assets did not significantly
 worsen Iran's economic problems, in part because
 Iran radically changed its portfolio management poli-
 cies. Markazi, Iran's central bank, increased its hold-
 ings of gold as a reserve asset.
 Longer Term Impact on Trade
 While the sanctions had little short-term impact on
 Iran's ability to procure needed imports, they did
 refocus Iran's trading patterns. The sanctions acceler-
 ated the shift of trade from the West that had begun
 before the hostage crisis. To offset the impact of the
 sanctions and to lessen its dependence on the industri-
 alized West, Iran signed economic agreements with
 several Third World countries. Largely as a result, the
 OECD share of Iranian imports fell from 83 percent
 in 1978 to 66 percent in 1980.
 Iran also strengthened its economic relations with
 Eastern Europe. Tehran signed comprehensive trade
 agreements with several of these countries to ex-
 change oil for foodstuffs, industrial goods, and the
 technical assistance, equipment, and material to con-
 struct factories in Iran. In addition, Eastern Europe
 provided military hardware to Iran. Some of these
 countries helped Iran evade the sanctions by trans-
 shipping Western spare parts.
 Iran also signed a one-year trade agreement with
 China in November 1979 calling for a doubling of
 two-way trade over 1978, to roughly $160 million. In
 May 1980 the two countries concluded a deal for an
 unspecified amount of Iranian oil.
 The USSR provided little help to Iran despite a new
 trade agreement. The Soviets were unable to meet
 Iran's priority need for food because of the USSR's
 own agricultural problems. Moreover, the USSR
 could not supply many of the components needed by
 Iranian industry, which was based largely on Western
 designs. As a result, Iranian purchases from the
 USSR actually declined about $17 million in 1980.

 far below normal as a result of the internal revolu-
 tion. Moreover, most of the economic pressure that
 should have resulted from the US-imposed trade
 and financial restrictions was relieved by Iran's
 ability to circumvent the sanctions.
 ? The United States failed to have the full support of
 its allies and, hence, full control over the value it
 attempted to deny Tehran.
 ? The failure or inability of the United States to
 reduce substantially Iran's oil exports gave the
 regime the financial wherewithal to overcome what-
 ever trade disruption initially occurred.
 ? Finally, the United States underestimated the
 strength of the revolutionary movement in Iran,
 Khomeini's ability to organize and control the popu-
 lace, and the willingness of Iranians to sacrifice to
 the point of martyrdom for what they perceived as a
 just and important cause.
 Iran's war with Iraq probably had more to do with the
 hostage release than the sanctions. Because of the
 Iraqi invasion in September 1980, Iran desperately
 needed spare parts for military equipment. War dam-
 age to oil facilities and the danger to tankers serving
 Iranian ports, however, eliminated a key source of
 finance for these purchases. With Iran's security
 threatened, the continuing assets freeze began to have
 an impact.
 The sanctions were probably more successful when
 viewed as a response to the need to "do something"
 quickly about Iran's temerity in seizing the hostages.
 For both domestic and international political reasons,
 the United States had to make some show of force.
 Other options, such as military actions, were initially
 dismissed as inappropriate or unlikely to succeed.

 Appendix L
 US Sanctions Against
 USSR (Afghanistan) (1980-81)
 Background to the Sanctions
 In January 1980, following the Soviet military inter-
 vention in Afghanistan, the United States and its
 major allies announced a sanctions program against
 the USSR. All the governments involved issued im-
 mediate, and in most cases, strong condemnations of
 the Soviet invasion. After consultations, most of the
 allies initially agreed to back the US-led partial grain
 embargo. The United States, in addition, proposed a
 number of specific economic denial measures covering
 the supply of other agricultural products, various
 kinds of high-technology goods, and government cred-
 its and credit guarantees (see inset). Finally, the
 United States proposed a Western boycott of the 1980
 Olympic Games to be held in Moscow. The sanctions
 effectively ended with the lifting of the grain embargo
 in spring 1981.
 The stated objective of the sanctions was to bring
 about a withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghani-
 stan. None of the parties to the sanctions, however,
 was willing to intervene militarily to achieve this
 result, and most were convinced that nothing short of
 force would work. Thus, the primary objective of
 these sanctions became the unstated one of punishing
 the Soviets for their aggression. Of the economic
 denial measures introduced or suggested, three were
 aimed at hindering Soviet plans for upgrading con-
 sumer diets (grain embargo and denial of superphos-
 phoric acid and fishing rights). Several were designed
 to hinder Soviet efforts to eliminate bottlenecks inter-
 fering with economic growth (denial of oil and gas
 equipment, metallurgical equipment, communications
 and automotive equipment, and computers-as well
 as the proposed limits on Western government cred-
 its). The Olympic boycott was aimed primarily at
 embarrassing Moscow politically, and secondarily at
 denying the USSR some hard currency.
 Compliance With the Sanctions
 The US-proposed sanctions did not draw strong sup-
 port from US allies, who made it clear from the outset
 that-for both political and economic reasons-they
 wanted to keep the door to the Soviet market ajar.
 Moreover, each was mindful not to take a markedly
 tougher stand on sanctions than its neighbor. In the
 case of grain, Argentina, a major exporter, refused to
 embargo any sales. The varying degrees of commit-
 ment to the sanctions meant that acceptance of and
 compliance with the US proposals also varied. Most
 countries put a temporary de facto hold on official
 export credits, but some held out longer than others.
 The national Olympic committees in West Germany,
 Japan, and Canada boycotted the Olympic Games;
 the committees in Britain, France, and Italy did not
 boycott, although participation was limited.
 In the months immediately following the US intro-
 duction of sanctions, the debate over the issues had a
 divisive effect on the Western alliance. The West
 Europeans, in particular, were highly critical of the
 Carter administration's handling of the matter, claim-
 ing that the United States had no long-term strategy
 for dealing with the Soviets and that the United
 States did not appreciate the West Europeans' posi-
 tion on their relationship with the USSR and the need
 to keep channels of communication open. The debate,
 however, served to heighten awareness of the need for
 greater policy coordination in dealing with the Sovi-
 ets. A consensus was reached on the need to strength-
 en the Coordinating Committee for East-West Trade
 Policy (COCOM), for example, even though the par-
 ties did not agree on the means. In addition, the
 discussion involving the US request for less conces-
 sional terms on new credits to the USSR helped lay
 the groundwork for the 1982 OECD decision to move
 the USSR into a higher rate category for official
 export credits.

 Principal US-Proposed Economic Denial
 Measures Against the USSR
 Agriculture
 ? Limit the USSR to purchases of the 8 million tons
 of US-origin grain guaranteed in each of the
 1979/80 and 1980/81 US-USSR Long-Term Agree-
 ment years (1 October-30 September accounting
 basis).
 ? Agreement among all the major grain exporters
 except Argentina not to replace denied US grain.
 ? Denial of outstanding contracts for oilseeds, meals,
 and poultry as of 4 January 1980.
 ? Ban the sale of processed agricultural products
 made in foreign countries from US raw products
 or example, soybean meal made from US beans).
 ? Suspend shipments of I million tons a year of US-
 origin superphosphoric acid to the USSR.
 ? Reduce Soviet fishing quotas in US waters from
 original 1980 figure of 420,000 tons to 75,000 tons.
 Technology
 ? Assurances that West European and Japanese firms
 would not be allowed to bid for projects US firms
 could not pursue because of the suspension order on
 export licenses.
 By the spring of 1981, the United States had decided
 that the domestic political costs of the partial grain
 embargo were too high relative to its effect on the
 USSR. US farmers-the group most affected by the
 sanctions-had lost grain and soybean sales to the
 USSR worth perhaps $1.3 billion.
 The lifting of the US grain embargo further weak-
 ened allied support for other US sanctions. Western
 governments acted quickly to protect their commer-
 cial interests.. The EC eliminated restrictions on sales
 of grain to the USSR and planned to resume subsidies
 on exports of grain and other agricultural products.
 The Canadians, who were taking advantage of the US

 pending export license applications for sale of

 to include COCOM review of any large ($100
 million plus) transaction in which Western

 items.

 embargo to pry better terms out of Moscow for grain,
 dropped that tactic and rushed to sign a five-year
 agreement. On the nonagricultural front, Tokyo be-
 gan to argue that US lifting of the grain embargo
 gave Japan a freer hand in selling high-technology
 products to the USSR, although within COCOM the
 no exceptions" policy on sales of embargoed technol-
 ogy has not been formally abandoned.
 In the case of the grain embargo, the USSR was able
 to replace only 9 million tons of the 17 million tons
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/18: CIA-RDP97R00694R000600110001-2
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/11/18: CIA-RDP97R00694R000600110001-2
 denied by the United States between January and the
 end of September 1980. Thus, total grain imports for
 the 1979/80 marketing year (MY) (October/Sep-
 tember) were roughly 25 percent below the expected
 level. In the MY 1980/81 year, however, Moscow was
 able to line up nearly all the grain its ports could
 handle while relying on the United States for only 9.5
 million tons, or one-fourth of the total, as compared
 with nearly two-thirds in the year prior to the embar-
 go. The roughly 1.5 million tons of soybeans and
 soybean meal denied by the United States in the 1980
 MY year were fully replaced by Argentina and firms
 in Western Europe. EC, Canadian, and Australian
 grain exports to the USSR all increased in 1980
 compared with 1979.
 The sanctions resulted in some delay in Moscow's
 effort to upgrade its domestic fertilizer industry. The
 United States is the only large-volume source of
 superphosphoric acid (SPA)-a chemical that the
 Soviet "liquid complex" fertilizer plants purchased
 from France were designed specifically to use. The
 suspension of US SPA sales between early 1980 and
 mid-1981 delayed the liquid complex fertilizer pro-
 gram by more than a year because most of the
 available phosphoric acid was of a lower grade and
 unsuitable for use in the program.
 Western sanctions probably did not impair Soviet
 industrial production appreciably, in large part be-
 cause France, West Germany, and Japan did not fully
 support restrictions on trade in technology and equip-
 ment. While orders by the Soviets for Western ma-
 chinery and equipment fell dramatically for a while,
 new Western contracts to supply equipment rebound-
 ed in second-half 1980. Nevertheless, the interruption
 in US technology sales retarded some urgently needed
 modernization in the USSR. For example, Soviet oil
 and gas exploration schedules were set back by delays
 in granting export licenses for such items as drillships
 and rigs. The revocations of licenses for the Dresser
 drill bit plant complicated efforts to improve drilling
 efficiency. And US denial of computer parts and
 assembly line equipment has further hampered an
 already lagging Soviet effort to double production
 capacity for diesel engines at the Kama truck plant.
 The impact of these denials, however, is likely to
 diminish over time as West European and Japanese
 firms continue to step in as US replacements.
 The boycott of the Olympics deprived Moscow of the
 prestige and propaganda opportunities it hoped to
 extract from well-run, noncontroversial games. It had
 little effect on Soviet hard currency earnings, howev-
 er, because most of the receipts from tourism and
 broadcast rights had been prepaid.
 On the political side, the economic sanctions height-
 ened the debate within the USSR between advocates
 of expanding trade with the West and those favoring
 greater autarky. Sanctions served to strengthen the
 hand of those favoring self-sufficiency who have long
 argued that the USSR is dissipating its patrimony by
 exporting vital raw materials for Western technology.
 Thus, the denial measures introduced an element of
 uncertainty at a time when Soviet officials were
 putting the finishing touches on the 1981-85 plan and
 reinforced doubts within the leadership about the
 viability of Soviet-Western trade over the long term.
 The sanctions have not, however, deterred Moscow
 from the pursuit of its goals in Afghanistan.
 The sanctions against the USSR following its inter-
 vention in Afghanistan illustrate the difficulty of
 implementing economic denial measures on a multi-
 lateral basis even though potential sponsors generally
 agreed on the objectives, both stated and unstated:
 ? The United States and others were unable to control
 supplies of grain to the Soviet Union because a
 major grain exporter refused to participate in the
 embargo.
 ? The intensity of the US commitment to the grain
 embargo was affected by domestic political
 considerations.
 ? Apart from the grain embargo, there was no consen-
 sus among the major sponsors on how to carry out
 the objectives.
 The sanctions did achieve, in some measure, the
 objective of punishing the Soviets for their aggression:
 ? Grain imports in 1980 were reduced by 8 million
 tons and restrictions on sales of SPA acid delayed
 the liquid complex fertilizer program, thus adversely
 affecting Soviet plans to upgrade consumer diets.
 ? Interruption of US technology sales delayed indus-
 trial modernization efforts.

 Appendix M
 US Sanctions Against USSR
 (Poland) (1981-82)
 On 29 December 1981, President Reagan imposed
 sanctions against the USSR in response to Moscow's
 "heavy and direct responsibility for the repression in
 Poland." They included:
 ? Suspension of all Aeroflot service to the United
 States.
 ? Closure of the Soviet Purchasing Commission
 (SPC).
 ? Suspension of the issuance or renewal of licenses for
 the export to the USSR of electronic equipment,
 computers, and other high-technology materials.
 ? Postponement of negotiations on a new long-term
 grain agreement.
 ? Suspension of negotiations on a new US-Soviet
 maritime agreement and a tightening of port access
 controls.
 ? Licensing requirement for exporting to the Soviet
 Union an expanded list of oil and gas equipment,
 including pipelayers, and suspension of the issuance
 of such licenses.
 ? Termination of the US-Soviet exchange agreements
 coming up for renewal in the near future, including
 the agreements on energy and science and technol-
 ogy, and a complete review of all other US-Soviet
 exchange agreements.
 Sanctions were also levied against Poland in Decem-
 ber 1981 (see inset).
 When the sanctions failed to produce the desired
 result (a six-month review period had been allowed),
 the Reagan administration announced a further re-
 striction on 18 June 1982-a prohibition on the export
 to the Soviet Union of all oil and gas equipment
 produced under US license.
 Objectives of the Sanctions
 The stated objective of the sanctions was the restora-
 tion of basic human rights in Poland as provided for in
 the Helsinki Final Act. If this objective was not
 attainable, then the administration's unstated goal
 was to punish the Soviets economically as severely as
 possible. The sanctions on the export of oil and gas
 equipment were considered to be the most damaging
 provisions because they might delay, or certainly
 increase, the cost of completing the Siberia-to-
 Western Europe natural gas pipeline. These restric-
 tions were largely aimed at halting the delivery of
 rotor sets produced by General Electric for gas tur-
 bines being built by GE's West European manufac-
 turing associates and destined for the Soviet pipeline
 compressor stations
 The pipeline has been viewed with alarm by Washing-
 ton from its inception. The primary concern was the
 degree of political leverage that the Soviets might
 gain from West European reliance on the USSR as a
 future major supplier of gas. With completion of the
 pipeline, West European countries could be relying on
 Soviet gas for nearly one-fourth of their gas require-
 ments by 1990. Gas supplies seemed particularly
 vulnerable because gas is difficult to replace on a
 short-term basis (because of the lack of a spot market
 and high startup costs) and the sectors most depen-
 dent on gas-residential and commercial-are the
 least able to cope with an abrupt fuel supply interrup-
 Of equal concern was the fact that Soviet purchase of
 Western oil and gas equipment and technology would
 add to Moscow's export capabilities and hard curren-
 cy earning power and relieve the pressures for reform
 and the need to choose between financing additional
 military growth and satisfying the needs of consum-
 ers. The pipeline is vital to Moscow's prospects for
 earning sufficient hard currency beyond the mid-
 1980s to offset a substantial part of the expected fall
 in oil export revenues. It was estimated that revenues

 Sanctions Against Poland
 The sanctions against Poland included:
 ? Suspension of Polish civil aviation privileges in the
 United States.
 ? A halt in the renewal of the Export-Import Bank's
 line of credit insurance to the Polish Government.
 ? Suspension of the right of Poland's fishing fleet to
 operate in US waters.
 ? Proposal to our allies that COCOM controls be
 tightened on high-technology exports to Poland.
 These US sanctions were followed in January 1982
 by a set of NATO restrictions, which included a ban
 on future government-guaranteed credits for goods
 other than food and the suspension of negotiations on
 service payments due on Poland's debt to official
 creditors. Negotiations on Poland's reentry into the
 IMF were also suspended.
 In December 1983 the Polish Government claimed
 that the damages to the Polish economy resulting
 from Western sanctions amounted to more than $10
 billion in the period 1982-83. In light of the econo-
 my's problems, however, it is hard to separate the
 impact of sanctions from the effects of prudent mar-
 ket-oriented decisions that would have reduced West-
 ern trade ties to Poland in any case. The denial of
 Most Favored Nation treatment and suspension of
 fishing rights did result in losses to specific indus-
 tries. However, the suspension of airline service (the
 route to the United States reportedly was unprofit-
 able) and Poland's avoidance of debt service repay-
 ments in 1982 and 1983 resulted in a cash flow gain
 that probably more than compensated for such losses.
 In January 1984 the United States lifted the ban on
 fishing (but with quantitative limits imposed) and
 allowed 88 charter flights to the United States by the
 Polish air carrier. In late 1983, Western governments
 resumed debt negotiations with Poland, resulting in
 the July 1985 rescheduling of $11 billion in arrears
 accumulated in the period 1982-84. Talks concerning
 IMF entry resumed in 1984, and Warsaw expects
 membership in the first half of 1986.
 from the pipeline deal alone could reach $5 billion
 annually in the early 1990s when all credits are
 repaid, and total gas earnings (including existing
 contracts) could be roughly $10 billion. Thus the
 pipeline would support Moscow's purchases of West-
 ern goods and technology, which are increasingly
 important to the improvment of industrial produce
 ty and the reduction of agricultural shortfalls
 The United States expected that the Soviets would
 also suffer some economic loss from the other sanc-
 tions, but to a lesser extent, particularly since trade
 had already been disrupted by the sanctions imposed
 in 1980 and 1981 after the Soviet intervention in
 Afghanistan. These provisions were largely intended
 to be irritants that reminded the Soviets that normal
 trade relations were not possible without some behav-
 ior modification. The activity of the SPC, for exam-
 ple, was already at a low level, and other Soviet
 commercial organizations in the United States were
 not affected by its closure.
 Compliance With the Sanctions
 The December 1981 US sanctions evoked weak sup-
 port from our allies. In January 1982, NATO mem-
 bers pledged not to undercut each other's sanctions
 against Poland and the USSR. In March the EC
 Commission recommended a reduction in 1982 of
 imports of nearly 100 products from the USSR by 50
 percent as compared with 1980 imports. These restric-
 tions did not apply to contracts entered into before the
 new regulations came into force and did not include
 energy products. Moreover, EC member countries
 further weakened these provisions by eliminating ad-
 ditional products.
 The West Europeans generally favored symbolic ges-
 tures and resented the US attempts to slow the gas
 pipeline construction. They viewed Soviet gas as a
 relatively low-priced substitute for uncertain Middle
 Eastern oil and anticipated that the Soviet pipeline
 equipment orders would ease their substantial unem-
 ployment problems. In addition, they held that in-
 creased East-West economic interdependence would
 lead to more responsible Soviet behavior. Even in the

 West Europeans believed that they could cope reason-
 ably well through a combination of conservation, fuel
 switching, temporary increases in domestic gas pro-
 duction, and drawdown of gas stocks.
 The attitude of the allies toward the United States
 turned to hostility when the sanctions were expanded
 in June. Most of the Big Seven 22 economic partners
 believed that earlier in the month at their Versailles
 meetings the United States had agreed not to press
 the allies on the Siberian pipeline if they would
 exercise "commercial prudence" in future extensions
 of credit to the USSR and Eastern Europe. Yet the
 sanctions imposed barely two weeks later were target-
 ed at the West European associates of US companies
 that were participants in the pipeline construction.
 The previous sanctions had prohibited export licenses
 for the export of machinery by US firms only. The
 new regulations attempted to prohibit the export of
 any machinery manufactured with US licenses. The
 West Europeans believed that the extraterritorial and
 retroactive features of the measures were a serious
 infringement of their sovereignty. They saw the sanc-
 tions as further evidence of US indifference to West
 European political and economic difficulties and as
 the latest example of Washington's predisposition to
 interpret international trade practices unilaterally. F
 Faced with the prospect that the US embargo would
 delay delivery of the Western gas turbines ordered for
 the gas export pipeline, the Soviets initiated a crash
 program during 1982 and 1983 to produce 16- and
 25-megawatt turbines. Although lower in efficiency
 and less reliable than Western turbines, they were
 workable substitutes. The decision to use a combina-
 tion of these and West European equipment on the
 pipeline and to mount a massive effort to accelerate
 pipeline construction enabled the Soviets to overcome
 much of the disruption and potential delay caused by
 the US embargo. Pipelaying operations on the gas
 export pipeline were completed in September 1983.
 Gas deliveries to Western Europe began in October
 1983 and reached 2 billion cubic meters of additional
 gas in 1984-less than originally scheduled, largely
 because of the warm winter and soft demand for gas.
 The Soviets assigned a high priority to this project not
 only because of the substantial hard currency that the
 pipeline would earn but also because the imposition of
 sanctions had made completion of the pipeline a
 matter of national prestige and had provided an
 opportunity to foment dissension in the Western
 alliance.
 The sanctions, however, imposed costs on the Soviet
 economy. First, the imposition of sanctions in addition
 to existing uncertainties in East-West trade caused by
 East European debt problems and by a Western
 review of credits to the USSR contributed to the
 emergence of a new climate in the West that made it
 more difficult for Moscow to conduct trade on terms
 as favorable as those obtained in the past. Second, the
 myriad of inefficiencies associated with the substitu-
 tion of domestically manufactured equipment boosted
 production costs in the affected industries and, in
 turn, imposed costs on other sectors of the economy.
 Third, the diversion of resources to the export pipeline
 probably slowed the pace of development of other
 important Soviet projects such as the Tyumen oil-
 fields. Output from these fields went into decline in
 1985 because timely countermeasures had not been
 As a result, Paris ordered French firms to honor their
 Soviet contracts, and London-acting under legisla-
 tive authority-required British firms to do the same.
 Bonn approved of the French action and stated that it
 could not stop the West German firms involved from
 delivering embargoed material to the USSR. Rome
 said that pipeline contracts would be honored but did
 not order Italian firms to do so. Because of the furor
 in Western Europe and the continued determination
 to participate in the pipeline project, the administra-
 tion in early November 1982 reduced the sanctions on
 oil and gas equipment to the level of controls that had
 applied in 1980. The United States decided to concen-
 trate instead on implementing a proposal for a com-
 mon allied approach to East-West trade that had been
 agreed upon (without French accord) in March 1982.
 This included common policies on export credit re-
 straint, interest rate subsidies, energy alternatives in
 Western Europe, and tighter controls on the transfer
 of advanced technology from West to East.

 on the USSR. The postponement of negotiations on a
 long-term grain agreement did not restrict Soviet
 purchases of US grain. The agreement was extended
 on a year-by-year basis, and a new five-year agree-
 ment was signed in August 1983. The revocation of
 Aeroflot landing rights, port restrictions, postpone-
 ment of a new maritime treaty, and suspension of
 exchange programs were never intended to inflict
 major economic harm on the USSR. They were
 meant to highlight the general deterioration in bilat-
 eral relations; conversely, their lifting signified a thaw
 in US-Soviet relations. After the May 1985 meeting
 of the Joint US-USSR Commercial Commission-its
 first meeting since 1978-progress was madam
 resolving all of these longstanding issues.
 The sanctions failed to achieve their primary aim-
 the immediate lifting of martial law in Poland-or
 their secondary aim-the substantial delay of the gas
 export pipeline by the Soviets and a major rethinking
 by the West Europeans of their potential dependence
 on Soviet gas supplies. However, they did achieve to a
 considerable extent their tertiary aim; they caused the
 Soviets to mount a costly campaign to compensate for
 the disruption in their imports of Western equipment,
 which probably had a negative impact on efficiency
 and on the pace of development in other sectors such
 as oil. The United States also managed to obtain a
 West European commitment to limit purchases of
 Soviet gas to no more than 30 percent of total
 requirements.
 These gains came at some economic and political cost
 to the United States. Economically, some US exports
 were replaced by West European and Japanese equip-
 ment, and domestic Soviet production capacity was
 developed that ultimately lost markets and jobs for all
 the Western allies. The growth in foreign capabilities
 to produce gas turbine compressors and oilfield equip-
 ment systems and hardware also represented a loss of
 future US control over the export of these items.
 These sanctions added to Moscow's perception that
 the United States was an unreliable trading partner,
 increasing Soviet determination to-redirect trade
 away from US firms in the future. Politically, the
 sanctions-particularly the second round-created a
 serious but temporary rift between the allies.

 Appendix N
 European Community Sanctions
 Against Argentina (1982)
 Background to the Sanctions
 On 2 April 1982, Argentina militarily occupied the
 Falkland (Malvinas) Islands. On the following day,
 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 502,
 which demanded immediate cessation of hostilities
 and withdrawal of Argentine troops and called on
 Argentina and the United Kingdom to resolve their
 differences diplomatically.
 The United Kingdom immediately dispatched a fleet
 toward the islands, invoking the right of self-defense
 under Article 51 of the UN Charter. On 3 April,
 Prime Minister Thatcher froze Argentine assets in the
 United Kingdom. This move was quickly followed by
 invasion were to take place, the sanctions would have
 failed to achieve their primary objective of forcing
 negotiations.
 Unable to achieve the unanimity required to renew
 the Community-mandated sanctions by 16 May, the
 EC Foreign Ministers announced action by their
 separate governments to maintain economic pressure
 on Argentina. Ireland and Italy stated they would
 avoid "distortions of trade," which meant they intend-
 ed to resume imports from Argentina but not for
 cross-trade purposes. The Danish Government re-
 newed its sanctions pending parliamentary adoption
 of national measures for sanctions. The remaining six
 member states announced a renewal of the existing
 a ban on trade with Argentina.
 In addition to bilateral action, the United Kingdom
 embarked on a comprehensive worldwide diplomatic
 campaign to induce other countries to apply maxi-
 mum pressure on Argentina to withdraw its troops
 and resort to a negotiated solution to the territorial
 dispute over the Falklands. On 6 April, at a meeting
 of the permanent representatives of the EC Ten in
 Brussels, the United Kingdom requested a firm show
 of EC solidarity and implied that it would like to see a
 total ban on imports from Argentina. The EC re-
 sponded to the British request on 16 April by agreeing
 to a 30-day ban on imports from Argentina. This was
 the sternest punitive measure taken by the EC, al-
 though it was not as comprehensive as the British had
 requested.
 As the British fleet approached the Falklands and it
 became clear that the United Kingdom would not
 negotiate while Argentine troops remained on the
 islands, EC solidarity faded. Ireland publicly stated
 that it opposed British use of force to regain the
 islands. The Italian Government was under strong
 domestic pressure to lift the sanctions, primarily
 because of cultural and ethnic links to Argentina.
 Other members, such as the Netherlands and Den-
 mark, were concerned that the sanctions were becom-
 ing irrelevant to the conflict. They argued that, if an
 sanctions for one week.
 A week later, on 24 May, the EC Foreign Ministers
 met again to discuss the sanctions issue. This time it
 was announced that the members would extend indef-
 initely the separate national measures announced the
 previous week.
 After the fall of Port Stanley, the British wanted to
 maintain the sanctions until Argentina formally
 agreed to end hostilities. However, on 21 June the EC
 announced that economic measures would be lifted by
 the member states the following day. The EC noted
 that some of the Ten that had introduced arms
 embargoes on a national basis would continue these
 measures for the time being.
 Objectives of Sanctions
 The explicit goal of the sanctions was to pressure
 Argentina to comply with UN Security Council Reso-
 lution 502, which demanded Argentine withdrawal
 from the Falklands and resumption of negotiations to
 settle the dispute. The relative importance of EC
 trade to the Argentine economy led many Europeans
 to conclude that the trade embargo would exert
 considerable pressure on the Argentine regime to
 come to the negotiating table.

 c7vI rel
 An important unstated motive of the EC sanctions
 was to demonstrate that the Community would re-
 spond to a clear-cut case of aggression against one of
 its members. Unlike controversial sanction cases such
 as Poland and Afghanistan, where the Community
 was divided on the appropriate form of action, Argen-
 tina had attacked an EC member state. Many EC
 countries felt that Argentina's sense of international
 isolation would be increased by EC solidarity.
 Finally, the continental EC countries were conscious
 of the growing unpopularity of the EC within the
 United Kingdom and the United Kingdom within the
 EC. EC agricultural policies and the cost of EC
 participation were sensitive domestic political issues
 for Thatcher's Conservative government. Decisive po-
 litical support from the EC on the Falklands issue was
 seen as a possible way to increase the EC political
 standing in the United Kingdom while coaxing the
 Thatcher government to be more compromising on
 internal Community issues.
 The specific sanctions imposed by the EC were far
 short of the comprehensive measures taken by the
 United Kingdom. They applied only to imports from
 Argentina and were for a 30-day period. Specifically
 exempted from the sanctions were contracts that had
 already been signed and shipments under way. Given
 the amount of Argentine goods subject to long-term
 contracts and the length of time it takes to ship goods
 from Argentina to the EC, most trade was not
 affected by the ban.
 Only if the 30-day ban had been extended would the
 measures taken collectively by the EC have had
 practical effect. It was clear from the outset, however,
 that renewal of the sanctions would be difficult, given
 the unwritten procedural requirement for unanimity
 within the Community and the reluctance of Ireland
 and Italy to support continued sanctions. It was the
 symbolic gesture of the EC decision that was intended
 to produce diplomatic and psychological effects.
 The EC sanctions were not nearly as effective as the
 separate actions of particular states. Both France and
 West Germany were strong supporters of the British
 and quickly moved to impose arms embargoes on
 Argentina. Other arms suppliers-including Belgium,
 the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria,
 and Norway-also cut off arms sales. Because Europe
 was the primary suppliers of arms to Argentina,
 access to military equipment was almost completely
 EC sanctions were part of the broader context of the
 diplomatic and economic pressure being applied
 against Argentina. In a wide variety of multilateral
 forums, Argentina found little support for its military
 action. In the Security Council and the EC there was
 explicit condemnation. Argentina was unable to gain
 Nonaligned Movement support for its positions in the
 UN General Assembly (UNGA), UN Conference on
 Trade and Development (UNCTAD), General Agree-
 ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and even UN
 Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
 (UNESCO). The response of the OAS was largely
 rhetorical, and moderate Latin states insisted on
 watering down Argentine resolutions so that they
 would have no legal effect.
 In spite of Argentine vulnerability to economic sanc-
 tions, the nature of the dispute between Argentina
 and the United Kingdom reduced the leverage of
 economic coercion. It became clear as the crisis
 developed that Prime Minister Thatcher had broad
 domestic political support to retake the Falklands by
 force. Within the Conservative Party she would have
 faced strong opposition to a negotiated settlement that
 did not achieve total Argentine withdrawal without
 any commitment on the sovereignty issue.
 Argentine President Galtieri and the military govern-
 ment had little room to negotiate. National sentiment
 in Argentina favored retaking the Falklands. As it
 became clear that a favorable diplomatic settlement
 was unlikely, the leadership decided that it would be
 better to surrender on the battlefield after an honor-
 able fight than to surrender at the negotiating table.

 Secret
 The sanctions, combined with other factors, however,
 may have kept the military conflict in bounds. Al-
 though Argentine leaders decided to fight in the
 Falklands rather than negotiate withdrawal, there
 was also talk of a protracted war against Britain. Had
 Britain stood alone, this might have been a more
 attractive policy alternative; but, with the Argentine
 economy already weak, little prospect of resupply of
 military equipment, and with the threat of renewal of
 the EC ban on imports, this was not a realistic option.
 The EC sanctions against Argentina are the classic
 case of a diplomatic gesture. At little cost the Com-
 munity demonstrated solidarity with a member state
 that had been the victim of aggression. Had the
 sanctions been in effect for a lengthy period, their
 economic impact might have provided incentive to
 Argentina to remove the troops and return to the
 negotiating process. However, the intransigent posi-
 tions of both the United Kingdom and Argentina and
 the British willingness to use force to prompt a rapid
 resolution of the crisis meant that economic sanctions
 had little influence in resolving the conflict.

 Few hardships felt by Italian people. Unemploy-

 sanctions. Little if any impact on the Italian
 Government's ability to maintain political leader-
 ship or on Italy's commitment to continue the
 war.
 Until 1975, little discernible economic impact.
 After 1975, some foreign firms may have decided
 to forgo trade with Israel.
 Withdrawal of Soviet experts dealt the Chinese a
 heavy blow whose effects were felt many years
 afterward. Combined with three years of bad
 harvests and the mistakes of the Great Leap
 Forward, sanctions helped precipitate a domestic
 crisis in 1960 through 1962.
 Sanctions hit the Dominican economy when al-
 ready sagging economic performance hampered
 adjustment, The Dominicans were able to cir-
 cumvent some of the sanctions by purchasing
 arms, vehicles, and petroleum. Economic deterio-
 ration fostered political unrest in the middle and
 upper classes, the Army, and the Catholic
 Church, After Trujillo's assassination, the re-
 maining family and supporter lost control of the
 government.
 The sanctions significantly damaged Cuba's
 growth and general development. The sanctions
 did little to weaken Castro's internal political
 position.
 Economic impact affected some sectors, notably
 agriculture, more than others, but generally Rho-
 desia's ability to adjust internally-combined
 with circumvention of the sanctionssubstantial-
 ly reduced economic effects.
 Algerian production dropped at least 25 percent
 in 1971, but impact undermined by developments
 in world oil market where rising prices enabled
 the Algerians largely to offset the losses from
 production cutbacks.

 the United States and other industrial countries
 for a relatively short time, The embargo awak-
 ened the United States to-the costs of importing
 substantial amounts of oil, leading to the begin-
 ning of major adjustments in US domestic and
 foreign policies. The embargo had a powerful
 demonstration effect on other industrial countries
 that were heavy consumers of Arab oil; they
 began to voice greater support for Arab positions,
 Sanctions did not halt Pakistan's efforts to devel?
 op nuclear weapons capability. Economic impact
 was minimal.
 Despite its economic problems and heavy depen-
 dence on the US market, Uganda suffered little
 from US trade sanctions.
 Little impact on Iran's ability to procure needed
 imports but did change its trading patterns. Iran
 circumvented US and EC sanctions on trade.
 Blocking of financial assets did not significantly
 worsen economic problems. Sanctions, by them-
 selves, failed to force early release of the
 hostages.
 In 1980 USSR able to replace only 9 million of
 17 million tons of grain denied by the United
 States, but the impact declined the next year as
 the USSR more fully replaced denied grain sup-
 plies. Some delay in Moscow's effort to upgrade
 domestic fertilizer industry. Retarded some mod-
 ernization programs, Deprived Moscow of some
 prestige and propaganda opportunities from the
 Olympics.
 Despite initial delay and confusion caused by
 embargo on gas rotors and turbines, pipeline
 successfully completed on schedule with domestic
 and West European equipment, This imposed
 costs on the Soviets in terms of efficiency and
 negative impact on other sectors caused by high
 priority of pipeline project. Other sanctions had
 little economic impact.
 No significant economic impact. Reduced chance
 for a protracted war against Britain.

 Conclusions
 Failure of these sanctions provides a classic dem-
 onstration of the problems involved in establish-
 ing and implementing multilateral sanctions.
 Membership did not agree on objectives; sanc-
 tions came late, limited, and incomplete; League
 did not have power to enforce sanctions; and
 membership did not control critical strategic
 goods.
 Main achievement of boycott has been the sym-
 bolic expression of Arab solidarity against Israel.
 The boycott sponsors do not control the supply of
 goods Israel imports and do not effectively en-
 force the sanctions.
 Sanctions failed to change Chinese ideological or
 foreign policies. In fact, they led to adverse
 political consequences for their sponsor. The Chi-
 nese leadership was so committed to its ideologi-
 cal break with the Soviets and to establishment of
 its own independent foreign policy that it was
 willing to bear the considerable economic and
 political cost of the sanctions. The sanctions
 provided the Chinese with a scapegoat to explain
 economic failures. Chinese adjustment to sanc-
 tions ultimately left Moscow with limited eco-
 nomic means to influence Beijing's behavior, The
 sanctions did punish the Chinese for their
 conduct.
 The sanctions met with considerable success in
 exacerbating deteriorating economic conditions
 and providing fuel for the floundering opposition,
 After Trujillo's death, the continuation of sane-
 tions forced the Trujillo family and supporters to
 yield control of the government.
 The Castro regime was so committed to its
 revolutionary policies that it was willing to bear
 the considerable cast of sanctions Sanctions pro-
 vided Castro with a scapegoat for domestic prob-
 lems, which he exploited to gain acceptance of
 radical changes in Cuban society, OAS participa-

 implementing parties; key supplier, South Africa,
 flouted sanctions; and the Rhodesian economy
 adjusted quite well to the sanctions that were
 enforced. Unintentionally, the sanctions left Zim-
 babwe with a much stronger economy than would
 have otherwise been likely.
 French companies settled the dispute on terms
 favorable to Algeria. Sanctions had little impact
 on Algeria because France failed to get coopera-
 tion of other states; market conditions helped
 Algeria offset revenue losses; French commitment
 was eroded because it could not readily replace
 Algerian oil,
 The United States remained committed to its
 support of Israel, The Arab states were not able
 to control the supply of oil to the United States.
 The United States was able to adjust to the
 embargo. Yet, the embargo did demonstrate op-
 position to US support of Israel and symbolized
 solidarity with Syria and Egypt.
 Pakistan was willing to forego US aid in order to
 continue its efforts to develop nuclear weapons
 because it perceived nuclear weapons as an ele-
 ment vital to its national security. Highly visible
 imposition of sanctions increased domestic sup-
 port for the Government of Pakistan policies, thus
 easing the political cost of forgone aid. The fact
 that the United States took tangible action, com-
 bined with demarches to other countries, has
 caused Islamabad to become dependent on the
 clandestine procurement network and has slowed
 development of its nuclear program.
 The United States was unable to gain cooperation
 of other governments in shutting off trade, and
 Uganda was able to find other suppliers and
 buyers. Yet, sanctions indirectly changed the
 Ugandan Govenrment because President Nyerere
 interpreted them to mean that the international
 community would not oppose his invasion of
 Uganda to remove Amin by force.
 Impact of sanctions was slight because the Irani-
 an economy was already operating far below
 normal and Iran was able to circumvent sanc-
 tions. Although some allies gave tacit approval to
 the asset freeze, the United States failed to have
 full support of allies and full control over embar-
 goed items, United States underestimated the
 strength of the commitment of the revolutionary
 movement in Iran and the willingness of Iranians
 to sacrifice for their cause. The sanctions did
 serve the US need to "do something" quickly in
 response to the hostage seizure.
 Illustrates the difficulty of implementing econom-
 ic denial measures on a multilateral basis. United
 States and allies not able to control supplies of
 grain because a major exporter refused to partici-
 pate. Intensity of US commitment was affected
 by domestic political considerations. No consen-
 sus among major sponsors on how to carry out the
 objectives. Sanctions did punish the Soviets in
 some measure.
 Sanctions did not force Soviets to lift martial law
 in Poland. Without cooperation from the West
 Europeans, sanctions were not effective at delay-
 ing pipeline and in fact increased determination
 of Soviets to go it alone. US attempts to use
 sanctions to force West Europeans to reconsider
 their participation in project backfired, Some
 costs were imposed on Soviets but US and West-
 ern Europe also suffered economic losses and
 damaged political relations,
 The EC sanctions against Argentina represent the
 classic case of diplomatic gesture. Community
 demonstrated solidarity at little cast.
