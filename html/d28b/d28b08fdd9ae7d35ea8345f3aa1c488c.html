The founding and the first year's activities of the Commor ? ? ? /4/0A. 
were reported in FILS, Volume 2, number 5, October 1983, 
an update on Thomas Troy's report. ? ?? ANS 
Professional intelligence officers have traditionally beer ? 
their work ? shouting their good works from the housetop ? /VS/ C_, 
professional association which would bring public attent p 
simply not the thing to do. But Congress changed all that. s.

As Tom Troy wrote, "retired intelligence officers, old pros, ..? . 
ceaseless round of accusations, investigations, revelations, and condemnations of 
the intelligence agencies. They had organized in defense of themselves, their 
careers, their craft, their agencies. At the same time, they had found natural 
allies ? retired military, defense specialists, some academicians, public-spirited 
citizens ? whose concern for national defense made them also supportive of a 
strong, effective national intelligence system." 
"Out of the collaboration there came on the Washington scene, in the last decade, 
more than a baker's dozen of either new intelligence organizations or old 
organizations with a new interest in intelligence. From them came in the 
aggregate much talking, meeting, fund raising, and prompting of causes and 
projects. So much, in fact, that retired Ambassador Elbridge Durbrow of the 
Security and Intelligence Fund (now the Security and Intelligence Foundation) was 
laughingly moved to complain, 'There are too damned many people barking up the 
same tree. There's need for some coordination.'" 
ncJiZe4-#40 
There had been some suggestion of a super-organization, to which all others could 
belong, which would act as a coordinating body for- their efforts. Some 
organizations talked of combining, but as is normally the case, the question of 
which organization would be subsumed brought all these efforts to naught. 
At the October 1981 convention of the National Military Intelligence Association 
(NMIA) at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., leaders of four 
professional intelligence groups discussed the profession, and particularly the role 
of their organizations. In addition to NMIA, the National

Honorable Joseph G. Ninish

Washington, D. C. 20515 
Dear Mt. Mirlish: 
OLC 76-1043/a 
21 April 1976 
I have received your letter of 6 April referring to a request 
by Mr. Gus Lanata, Caldwell High School, Caldwell, New Jersey, for 
an Agency official to address his high school assembly. 
We recognize the desire of the public to be informed about the 
Central Intelligence Agency and we Make every effort to respond to 
that whenever we can. We believe, however, that the best utilization 
of our resources for this purpose is in a single speaker context; not 
in a seminar or forum discussion with other speakers.. 
I regret that we cannot accept the invitation from the James 
Caldwell High School. However, if a group or groups of these 
students ever visit Washington we would be pleased_ to have them 
visit our headquarters in Langley, Virginia and meet with an Agency 
official. 
I have enclosed a package of material about the Agency for 
you to send to NT. Lanata. I believe that it will enable him and 
his fellow students to get a better understanding of our role and 
responsibility in our Government. 
Sincerely, 
SI=

conspired to gain an 
unfair aviation advan-

The suits, filed in Oke;

inextricably involved 
in this conspiracy by; 
the CIA and various of!

One of the suits was 
filed by U.S. Overseas 
Airline, Inc., composedi 
of five other aviation, 
firms. The other was 
filed by California Air 
? Charter Inc. and Holi-

The suits claim fed-

just profit for their own 
benefit and to the ulti-
mate detriment of the 
? plaintiffs and the con-
sumers of commerical 
aviation services of our

They j claim the al-
leged conspiracy 
deprived the American 
people. of "low cost, 
high quality -commer-

for years and caused a 
loss to the nation's in-
dustrial development 
"measured in the bil-
lions of dollars." - 
The CIA's involve-
ment, according to the., 
suits; "was apparently 
the agency's effort to 
develop sources of in-
come to finance clan-
destine activities with-
out the inconvenience 
of cortgressigliVarbwd 
sight" from 193g to the 
present.

cal airlines, and were 
allowed "to gouge. 
greater profits from 
military airlift con-
tracts as well as exces-
sive profits from con-
tract air services from 
the private sector." 1 
While the govern-
ment allegedly forced 
the complaining avia-
tion firms to comply 
with arbitrary regula-
tions and security con-
siderations, the govern-
ment-run firms were 
"allowed a 'hands off' 
status" the suits state.

Jeer Mr. Bullock: 
Thank you for your kind invitation of 31 May to speak before the 
Calvin Bullock /Forum on 3 October, 25 October, or 1 November. 
I am aware of the program of the Forum and the fact that Mr. 
Helms, on two separate occasions, spoke off the record to your mem-
bers. I accept your invitation and believe that 1 November would be 
most convenient. Perhaps The Intelligence Community" would be the 
best working title for my comments. 
Needless to nay, my acceptance of your invitation is contingent 
upon the outcome of my forthcoming appearance before the Senate for 
confirmation as Director of Central Intelligence.

The Honorable William Egan Colby 
Director 
Central Intelligence Agency 
Washington, D. C. 20505 
Dear Mr. Colby: 
0001-6 
Once or twice a month a remarkably prominent group 
of business men gathers at One Wall Street to hear a speaker dis-
cuss some matter of major interest to the business world. 
Such meetings are usually held in mid-week and begin 
at four o'clock sharp. The talk lasts half an hour and is followed 
by a quarter hour question period. 
Everything said is off the record. This permits 
unu8ually intimate addresses and discussions. 
A partial list of speakers is enclosed. Their eminence 
and the character of the audience have given this institution an inter--
national reputation. 
Won't you come from Washington as our guest and honor 
our Forum on O'ctober 3rd, October 25th or November 1st? We 
would promise you a distinguished audience. We hope you can say 
yes. 
Sincerely yours, 
HI-1/es

get the report right Coups 
d'etat or midaight butcheries, 
occurring in distant spots at 
:moments of ?? unexpected 
crisis, area- often reported 
with littleereal accuracy at 
the- time. Few writers go 
back to those reo-orts, once 
nut on- page' one, to discover 
later that-the real story was 
a very different one. 
-Just such a case occurred 
Thur years ago on the night 
of August le- 1975, when the 
-rounding nationalist leader of 
Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur 
Ranerean was killed in a mili-
tary putsch. For The Guar-
dian.. Martin Woollacott and I 
eled one of the most detailed 
accounts of what happened. 
It ran as the lead story on 
August 23 1975. Looking 
back, it appears that we in-
evitably missed a lot. But, as 
with all such events' -when 
they happen, no one except 
the actual participants knew 
what had really gone GIL 
The coup happened. on one 
of. those hot sweleering mon-
sooa nights that. .blow up 
_ each summer from.. the Bay 
of Bengal. It was :a quiet 
-evening and the escariticaa talk 
en the tea shops of Dacca 
that 'clay was about. Mujites 
? speech p/anned.efor the next 
" morning at. thee university.

-
night did not seerrr much slif-a. 
? fereart from many others that - 
summer. 
-.Yet life- ire Dae a- did take ' 
a-- sudden turn that-' August ? 
evening. Just after midnight 
- the Bengal Lancers and' the 
Bangladesh Armotjaei 
slowly trundled outrliFletiai 
? caP'ea-are main cantonment to. 
ward' , the runways '? of... the 
abandoned half-built_ second 
As --they lined up in 
. formation on the main run-
way, the cornrnanding officer 
of the column, Major Farooq, 
stood. GIT a tank and told his 
tr.ene that that night they 
would overthrew elujib'es re-
gime. It was ,a fire-eating 
speech ad by the time Far-
ooq had enished they were 
ready to go. They moved out 
and split into three columns. 
Within three hours Mujib 
and-. more than forty 
members of his family were 
dead. - 
The version ' of events 
which 'emerged at the time 
WaT.that six junior officers, 
with three hundred men 
under their command, had 
acted on theiri own over- : 
throwing Mujib. The motives! 
for the coup were attributed 
to a combination of personal 
grudges held by certain of 
the officers against Mujib and 
his associates, together with 
a general mood of frustration 
at the widespread corruption 
which had come to character-
ise Mujib's regime, 
In reporting the coup no 
foreign or Bengali journal-
ist probed beyond the super-
ficial. aspects of what had 
happened. What contacts the 
officers- had made before 
August, which politicians had 
been, contacted, were ignored. 
The -version of events that 
; 
'the officers had acted alone, 
-without prion political plan-
- rang. was -a myth that came 
to stand as fact. _ - 
The naornLarg Mujib and his 
family were killed, the figure 
by the young 
majors- as President was 
Mimed-akar Mustaque, gener-
ally aonside_red to be the re-
presentative of the rightist 
...faction within eaujib's Awami 
League. After the putsch, 
Mustaque remained impec-
cably reticent about any part 
he personally might have 
-a.played in Mujib's 
He neither conermed nor 
denied his prior involvement. 
He simply avoided Any public 
discussion of the question 
A year following the coup, 
after he had himself been 
,-toppled , from'-power and 
-before his own arrest on cor-
ruption charges,. Mustaque 
denied to me any prior. 
: knowledge of the coup plan 
or prior meetings with the 
army majors who carried out 
the action. The majors, how-
ever, have told a very differ-
ent story. 
They have confirmed. prior 
meetings and prior links with 
Mustaque and his associates. 
Knowledgeable Bengali and 
foreign diplomatic sources 
? now claim that Mustaque and 
his political friends had been 
involved far more -than a 
year in . plans designed to 
bring ablaut the Over:throw of 
According to inform-
ation obtained from senior 
US officials at the American.. 
Embassy in Dacca and from 
well-informed - Bengali 
sources, it appears that the 
United 'States ? had, prior 
knowledge of the coue which 
killed Mujib, and that Amer-
ican Eirtbassy personnel had 
held discussions with indivi-
duals involved in the plat 
more than. six Tao-tabs prior 
to his death. 
According to one' etigealy-
placed US Embassy diplomat, 
officials n at. :the.. Araericarre 
Embassy- Were- approached by 
people ?: intesiding -a to ? e over-
throw - 'the government 
Sheikh alujibureee Rahman. ? 
This Embassy source has,. 
stated that a series of meet-
ings took place with Embassy 
personnel between November 
1974 and January 1975. These 
discussions were . held with 
the purpose of determining 
the attitude of the US Gov-
towards a political 
change in Bangladesh if a 
coup d'etat were actually to 
happen. 
The contacts occurrred 
during the period in which . 
the Church and Pike Con-
gressionai Committee hear-
ings in Washington on CIA 
assassinatior of fol--jtai 
leaders were gearing up. Then - 
creating great nervotiS ness 
and anxiety. The American 
press was openly speculat-
ing that senior American in-
telligence officials might face 
imprisonment for illegal clan-
destine action .in Chile and 
elsewhere. 
In the atmosphere emanat-
ing .from the Senate hear-
ings, a decision was taken by 
the US Embassy in Dacca in 
January 1975. According to a 
senior official: "We came to 
art - 'understanding in the 
embassy that we would stay 
out of it and disengage from 
those people." Although a de-
cision was made at. a high 
Ievela.in the embassy that 
there would be no further 
contact- with the anti-Mujib 
group, what happened subse-
quently is a matter of contro-
versy among US officials 
interwieweds. . 
Those- who knew of the 
earlier meetings deny any 
personal knowledge of what 
happened alter ea-riy 1975.

Thank you very much for the invitation to speak 
at the meeting of the John Carroll Society on Sunday, 
October 19th. Barbara and I will both be very happy to 
be with you on that occasion. 
Obviously, I will speak about American intelligence 
today. I hope I can clarify our country's need for good 
intelligence, the excellence of our intelligence, the 
true proportion of the missteps we may have made over 
the past twenty-eight years and the way intelligence works 
today. The idea of a twenty-or-so minute talk followed 
by questions sounds very appropriate. I look forward to 
the opportunity to meet this important audience, and I 
will hope to bring along my application blank as well. 
Thank you again.

By TKENNETII A. BRIGGS 
A prominent Roman Catholic net.vs-
paper has renewed charges that the 
United tSates military entered into wide-
spread collusion with Catholic Relief 
.ervices during the Vietnam war. 
charge of the agency's Vietnam program 
has assailed the newspaper report as 
'roll of halt-truths" and has defended his 
policy of cooperating with the American 
war effort. - 
While such cooperation has been the 
'subject of persistent rumors in the last 
few years, the yearlong investigation by 
Richard Rosake of the National Catholic 
Reporter, an independent journal based 
in Kansas City, Mo., raises these reports 
,o a- new level of seriousness. 
The paper, in its Dec. 17 issue, cort-
eludes that the agency went beyond its 
:humanitarian mandate - as the foreign 
. relief arm of the United States Catholic 
. Conference by aiding the military in such 
endeavors as forcibly uprooting Viet-
namese peasants and herding them into 
refugee camps: 
Among Mr. Rashke's contentions are 
that the Catholic service unit supplied 
huge amounts of food and other pro-
visions to prison camps and to reimburse 
-Vietnamese military forces. Military of-
ficers were said to have worked in Cath-
olic Relief Service offices and provided

The Rev. Robert 1. Charlebols, 
rected Vietnamese efforts for the organi-
zation, conceded yesterday that the 
agency accepted material help from the 
American Government and worked in 
close cooperation with the military. 
He argued, however, that these ar-
rangements were solely for the purpose 
of assisting the poor, and represented e):-
pedient choices under severe wartime 
conditions. 
"When we found ourselves in the reali-
ty of the situation," Father Chariebois 
said, "we made the best ofit that we 
could." He added that the pressing situa-
tion led the agency to accept many forms 
of help, among them transportation for 
staff members by Air America, the line 
operated by the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
Father Charlebois, now an assistant to 
the executive director of the agency, also 
pointed out that the policies in questioo 
saved lives. "What would have hap-
pened if we hadn't responded as we did 
in many cases?" he said. "Death." lie 
continued: "No doubt hundreds of thou-
sands of people were kept alive because 
we fed them." 
Reports of alliances between the mili-
tary and Catholic Relief Services have 
floated about for- years. Many came to 
light a year ago with reports that the 
C.I.A. employed American rnissionarie4:1 
a; in .ot-rnants. 
ThEit controversy loe.:zan with the dis-
closure by Senator /lark 0. HatfieldA 
Repuhtican of Cragon, that the Direetor 
of Central Intelligence, Willi mi E. Colby, 
and phdi? W. Ruc.hen, White. House. coun-
sel, had rseknov.riedge-.1 in letters that' 
enlistment of missionaries was consid?
ered standard 'procedure. 
Vigorous protesns from church groups. 
followed, most demanding a eban,s,a in, 
policy. The outcries subsided when the 
new Director of Central Intelligence,-
George Bush, in one of his first j-diciall 
acts, issued a directive forbidding tee 
di-
rect solicitation of irn'ormation 
church personnel. . . 
Catholic Relief Services and a Protes:' 
tans evangelical agency, World Vision In-
ternational, were mentioned widely ri.sLI, 
recipients of large Government grants.. 
Suggestions that these agencies offered" 
support for late war effort usually accorn-
paoled those reports. 
The National Catholic Reporter article.' 
binds together many of these scattered: 
allegations. Father Charlebois, who says-7 
he felt ''nobody could win: the war,' 
maintained that the writer, Mr. Reshke, 
drew his materials for the most p.arr, from - 
two sources--two former members of the 
agency Staff whom the priest s-tys Ice dis-
missed. One is a former priest, Father,' 
Charlebois said. -

By Marjorie Nyer 
. WaNhinaton Post Staff Writer 
During much of the Vietnam war, 
Catholic Relief Services.abandoned- its.
apolitical: humanitarian rol-e and be-
came an. adjunct of the American mil--
itary effort, a leading Catholic weekly - 
--has charged. ? - 
The charges, which will appear in 
the Dec. 17 issue of the National Cath-
olic Reporter, grew out of a year-
long investigation of CRS -by the 
? weekly's -- Washington - correspondent, , 
Richard Rashke. 
In his account, Rashke. alleges: 
* That CRS turned over vast quanti-
ties of relief suppplies?food, clothing 
and medicines?to U.S. and South Vi- ? 
etnamese military units to be used as
pay for irregular . forces and 
"incentives' for intelligence gather-
ing.

worked in-, CRS offices, ? where they 
- had access to CRS field reports con-. 
taming infortnation valuable to mill-. 
tary intelligence but possibly discs-
, trous to the Vietnamese. civilians CRS 
' was supposed to help. ? 
That as much as 90 per cent of the 
chuith agency's. budget came 
from the V.S. Agency forinternational 
Development program in Vietnam on. 
a quid' pro quo basis,c.which presup-
posed the church. agency would. reci-.. 
..procat'e :."by accepting .U.S. _policy.. 
withont, Criticism- and by Sharing in-
formation with  U.S. AID personnel,'  
the Reporter says. 
0- Thar CRS supplied rations' for in-. 
:Am-rogation centers and- pris-
ons, including Con Son prison with its 
infamous "tiger cages," . . 
d' That the 'U.S._ military "built 
CRS into its refugee program" of fore-
- lag Vietnamese civilians from homes 
and farms into refugee camps, which 
were supplied by CRS. ? 
* That CRS "encouraged" its staff 
members to live rent-free in housing 
on AID -compounds and used the 
CIA's Air America for staff travel and 
shipment of relief goods.:-- ?' ?

-policy and demanding U.S. military 
withdrawal, 
? The Most Rev. James S. Bausch, 
general Secretary of the National Con-
ference of Catholic ishops?to which 
'ens is ultimately responsible?said 
? he has not yet seen the Reporter ac-
count and therefore could not corn-
? ment. He said that, if the charges are 
substantiate.cl, the bishops would 
"certainly want to take action." 
Information in the Reporter ac-
count was derived largely from U.S. 
government reports and interviews 
with former CRS-Vietnam personnel 
as well as staff members of other vol-
.-
untary and U.S. government agencies 
who served in Vietnam. 
CRS,, which Is headquartered in 
New York, refused to make any of its 
. files or reports available. Rashke said. 
As the official humanitarian arm. of 
American Catholics, CRS is supported 
in part by collections in all churches 
on a derAgrat,ed Sunday, usually in late 
March. Like other worldwide relief 
' agencies, it also derives a large part 
of its budget from U.S. government 
contribution of surplus food under 
?.Public Law 4P.O. . ? ? 
1iY75, church members gave 56.5 
?riuion to CRS, or 3 per cent of CRS' 
total, worldwide budget. . ?? 
CRS worked in Vietnam from 1934, 
when it moved in to help feed, clothe 
and resettle the nearly 1 million refu-
gees who fled south after the French 
pullout, until the fall of Saigon in 
.1975. Although there were earlier 
charges of mishandling of relief 
.goods, the Reporter account deals psi-
manly with the situation from 19-67.-
on, when the agency's 'Vietnam opera-
tion was directed,by the Rev. Robert 
L. Charlebois. 
In 1967, writer' Michael' Novak re-
ported after a visit to Vietnam- that 
CRS, at the request of Gen. William 
Westmoreland, was. supplying 7,000 
tons of food and clothing a month to 
150,000 Vietnamese civilian militiamen 
and their 550,000 dependents. The sup-
plies were requested by the American 
military to provide what- Novak said 
was23 per cent of the monthly wages 
of the Popular Forces/Regional Forces, 
nicknamed the Ruff Puffs by the U.S. 
Marines. , ? ; 
After seven months of growing criti-
cism, CRS in New York ordered an 
end to paying Ruff Puff salaries with ? 
relief supplies. - Rashke's article 
charges that instead of changing, its 
-policy, CRS in Vietnam "merely 
changed its accounting procedures.'-

It adds: "Charlebois and his Saigon .

One leads to another 
"Many of the criticisms directed against fraternities are well founded, and 
they are not entirely engendered by a feeling of bitterness on the part of some 
disgruntled student who did not make a fraternity. The fraternity system cannot 
be attacked in theory, but unfortunately we do not always carry out our ideals 
and principles in practice. Snobbishness, political activity, extravagance, poor 
scholarship, and many other often-quoted evils do exist in many of our chapters, 
and these must be eradicated absolutely, if we are to justify ourselves in the 
public eye." 
? Written in 1913 by afield Secretary of a national fraternity. 
1913, that was a long time ago, but much, if not all of those 
criticisms are still true. So what is Chi Psi doing? Though in the 
formative stages, both the Educational Trust and the Fraternity 
are seriously working to battle the problems of relevance in the 
fraternity system of today. Both groups aim to provide a mean-
ingful experience for not only undergraduates but also alumni. 
"Yes, but I've heard that before," you may say to yourself. 
Exactly why this editorial is being published. All of our members 
should be aware of the initial steps being taken to reach that 
goal. 
The Chi Psi Educational Trust has embarked upon a cam-
paign to provide an experiential education for all Chi Psis. Part 
of an undergraduate's educational experience in college relates 
to the original ideals of fraternity. "For the cultivation of true 
friendship, then; for mutual protection and advancement in 
intellectual, moral and social life . . . " words taken directly 
from the Preamble of the Chi Psi Constitution, written in 1845. 
The Trust has committed itself to initiating new programs to 
provide an "advancement in intellectual, moral and social life." 
Description of a new program appears later in this issue. Briefly, 
the pilot program provides a career internship capitalizing on 
the benefits Chi Psi alumni can provide to Chi Psi undergrad-
uates with the assistance of the Trust. 
In The Chi Psi Story, the national pledge manual, John W. 
Anderson, Epsilon '90, sixth president of the fraternity is quoted, 
" . . . it (Chi Psi) has expression only in the fellowship of its 
bonds, begun when life is young and not broken in old age." The 
Trust's Career Internship Program makes this quote a reality. 
Existing Trust programs such as the "Program for Self-
Development" touched upon the experiential education for un-
dergraduates but now the Trust advances one step further. 
The Fraternity also looks ahead to create a more meaningful 
Chi Psi experience. As of this summer, the Central Office staff 
underwent a reorganization assigning staff members to be re-
sponsible for all Central Office communications with specific 
Alphas. In this manner, the staff member would become very 
familiar with his Alphas enabling him to provide personal atten-
tion to them. Alumni Council members were also assigned spe-
cific alphas to visit. Through this, the Executive Council should 
obtain first-hand input from the undergraduates. 
The Chi Psi Executive Council, ever conscious of the under-
graduate student body, continues to devote five of its fourteen 
positions to undergraduate representatives of Chi Psi's five 
regions. This represents the largest number of undergraduates 
on any national fraternity governing board. All the alumni 
Council members agree that the input from these men proves in-
valuable.

President-elect of the Fraternity, Oliver Rowe, Sigma '25, 
embarked upon a crusade within the fraternity for a "Program 
for Excellence" last spring. Brother Rowe's program has created 
great interest among the undergraduates, many alumni and 
members of the Executive Council and the Educational Trust. 
Brother Rowe's personal goal requires him to visit every Alpha 
of Chi Psi presenting his visions of excellence for the Fraternity. 
Brother Rowe's response to the question, "What is the Pro-
gram for Excellence?" describes "The Program for Excellence" 
as "a movement within the Fraternity 'to give the Brotherhood 
a serious and practical purpose. Its long-range objective is 
to help the undergraduates achieve success in college and to 
prepare them better for achieving greater success in any walk 
of life they may choose after college. 
"In college the Excellence they achieve would practically 
assure their entrance into any graduate school, into law school, 
into medical school, or into any professional school they desire. 
Also, the reputation of the Fraternity would rise so high and the 
achievements for excellence be so great on the part of our grad-
uates, they will have earned a preferred position in getting posi-
tions in industry or business. 
"In life after college our graduates will achieve greater success 
in their professions and careers, because of the habits they 
have acquired and the things they have learned from their ex-
perience in Chi Psi. I call this the "stuff' on which success 
is built, 
"The Program for Excellence will raise our Brotherhood to 
heights undreamed of in the fraternity world. So great will be 
the improvement that colleges and universities will want our

Once again, Alpha Pi is dominating 
the athletic, academic, and social facets 
of Union College. The Lodge itself is 
thriving with a full house of 37 actives. 
The Union football team, captained by 
Brother Tom Hood '77, is bolstered by 
the presence of ten other Lodgers, while 
the Union soccer team is captained by 
Brother Jim Manning '78, with support 
from two other Lodgers. 
Academically, Alpha Pi ranks fifth 
among Union's fourteen fraternities. Re-
cent Clifford Williams Scholarship win-
ner Bob Clarke '77, has been initiated in-
to Tau Beta Pi, an honorary engineering 
society, and has his eye on medical 
school. 
Socially, Alpha Pi saw many alumni 
on Homecoming Weekend, and also an-
ticipates a typically excellent rush. 
Finally, Alpha Pi would like to thank

Things are going well at Alpha Mu 
this fall. The Lodge has improved in re-

the better. Our cook of three years is 
back and the food is great! 
With 18 brothers initiated this fall, 
our membership now numbers sixty. 
This large number enabled us to wel-
come back our alumni brothers properly 
on Middlebury's Homecoming Week-
end, October 8-9. The weekend was, 
indeed, a success despite the frigid, 
damp weather conditions. A moderate 
alumni turnout enjoyed an afternoon 
cocktail party and buffet dinner. An 
Alumni Corporation meeting was con-
ducted on the morning of October 9th, 
with trustees and the Lodge #1 and #4 
attending. Brothers Schaefer, Cangiano, 
Peck, Baxter, Barry, Brigham and Fraser 
were attending. Money was alloted for 
sprinkler additions and wiring repair. 
Intramurals are going well. Alpha 
Mu's touch football team is undefeated 
through October 14th. including a de-
vasting 52-0 trouncing of DKE. The 
Lodge soccer team, after two games has 
a win and a tie.

great one, profitable in many ways. 
We hope as many of you as possible will 
stop by to see us.

The first semester at Alpha Alpha,

The fall election of officers saw Bro-

A new fraternity ruling at Bowdoin, 
increasing rush to ten days, gave many 
freshmen an opportunity to see the 
Lodge during its more relaxed moments. 
The ruling proved fruitful. Under the 
leadership of chairperson Sue Sokoloski 
'78. Chi Psi had the most successful rush 
on campus. We gained seventeen new 
brothers as well as twenty-nine new 
members. The brothers include: Mark 
Kulp '79, Ames Ziegra '79, Mike Arel

voted in Tom McNamara '78 as #2. and 
expressed our unanimous confidence in

We were all saddened by hearing 
about the death of Brother Glenn 
McIntire '23. For those who knew Glenn. 
we realize we have lost a personification

Phillip William Barnhill '77 
Alpha Phi of Chi Psi is once again off 
to a financially sound and active fall 
semester. We had a very good turnout at 
our fall corporation meeting in October 
with many alumni returning to the 
Lodge. It is a good feeling for the actives 
to know that they are supported not only 
by the recent graduates but also by 
alumni from the classes of the 30's, 40's, 
and 50's. 
During the corporation meeting. Phi 
decided to move strongly in the direction 
of a major fund raising drive to be held 
sometime next year. The proceeds from 
the fund drive are drastically needed to 
replace plumbing, electrical wiring, and 
a roof for our old but much admired 
Lodge. 
Rushing started October 14th and will 
continue until the end of January. If our 
success ratio continues to be as strong as 
it has been in the recent past we will look 
forward to another pledge class of at 
least fifteen men.

Life in Ann Arbor this fall remains 
consistent with the previous few, but 
within the stately walls of Chi Psi, things 
are changing, especially in athletics and 
house unity. This is particularly en-
couraging in light of the tragic loss of 
our beloved Brother and #1, Pete Haber-
korn, not to mention the turmoil that 
existed in the later months of the last 
winter term. 
Undercurrents of tension have fallen 
off to stronger bonds of friendship and 
a general feeling of optimism has taken 
root. 
In the line of sports. the softball team 
displayed moments of brilliance, for in-
stance, overcoming an eight run deficit 
late in the first play-off game ? at last 
gaining athletic respectability! 
On October 14, we were honored to 
have President-elect Oliver Rowe grace 
us with his inspiring words and charis-
mic personality. Indeed, when he left 
Ann Arbor the following clay, he left 
some of his dynamic enthusiasm with 
every member of the lodge. 
In the kitchen the new steward, John 
Ross. has things well in hand, including 
this year's new gourmet cook, a foxy 
little dish from Ohio. 
Fall rush so far has resulted in the ac-

Gernot Joachim and Jim Shaw, due to 
the fine efforts of rush chairman, Ian

ALPHA SIGMA 
University (tf North Carolina 
Gregory Nye '77 
Alpha Sigma's Brothers arrived in 
Chapel Hill late in August knowing that 
new leaders would have to emerge this 
year and continue the fine traditions of 
the Lodge. The impressive achievements 
of last year and the subsequent sweep of 
convention awards this past summer 
served as a reminder of what the Lodge 
can be. The Brothers set out to make the 
Lodge even better this year. 
This semester, three new social chair-
men, Clint Corrie, Les Hamashima and 
Paul Brown, took over the job of plan-
ning of the social calendar. Staley Moore 
began organizing Parents' Weekend. 
Louis Edmonds made plans to keep the 
Brothers busy on numerous workdays to 
maintain the reputation of the Lodge as 
the nicest place to live on campus. Mike 
Egan and Larry Gellerstedt began train-
ing programs involving nearly the entire 
Lodge for the coming intramural season. 
Tom Terrell and Tom Temple worked 
hard to get the best possible rushees over 
to the Lodge during rush, which was 
rewarded in eleven outstanding pledges. 
The Coffee House held in late Septem-
ber gave the Brothers the opportunity to 
demonstrate their various talents, from 
song and dance to juggling. With results 
from last semester's academic work in, 
Sigma regained its leadership among 
fraternities with an average of 3.3 on a 
4.0 scale. Brothers Egan and Gellerstedt 
have succeeded in getting the Brothers 
out of the library and onto the intra-
mural field ? at least long enough to 
take a first in volleyball and a second in 
the track meet. 
With the new leadership in the Lodge 
this semester, it appears that Sigma is 
maintaining its reputation as the best 
fraternity at the University.

Gamma is really excited about this 
school year. Coming out of Convention 
with the honors we received, we went into 
rush with a fired-up attitude, and 
pledged 32 of the best men that went 
through rush. 
Improvements at Gamma have com-
pletely reworked the thermostat system; 
put in more insulation; recarpeted parts 
of the Lodge; repainted the entire in-
terior of the Lodge, and rebuilt our 
pantry and fireplace. Thanks to our loyal 
alumni who offered us a $24000 match-
ing grant, we were able to instigate these 
repairs. 
Gamma was most honored when Pres-
ident-elect Brother Oliver R. Rowe, 
Sigma '25, paid us a visit during rush. 
The night of our pledge banquet he pre-
sented his "Program for Excellence," 
which impressed the new pledges and 
brothers alike. 
Gamma is now in the process of work-
ing on several major projects. Com-
munity service heads the list. For Hal-
loween, the Brothers of Gamma, along 
with Pi Beta Phi Sorority, gave a party 
for the children at the North Miss. Men-

we are working on some fund raising 
events to help the under-priviledged

Homecoming Weekend proved to be 
a high point of the semester. In addition 
to the night time band parties, the actives 
and alumni were treated to a pre-game 
pig roast. The highlight of the day was 
the presentation of a silver platter to 
Bill Hearns to commemorate his 25th 
year with the Lodge. Bill was extremely 
appreciative and he delighted in seeing 
all of the returning alumni. 
Typically, rush is the most important 
period during first semester. Under the 
direction of rush chairman, Jeff Kauf-
man '78 the Lodge came out of the rush 
with one of the largest and best quality 
pledge classes of any house on the 
grounds. Twenty-three bids were re-
turned and the event was celebrated at 
a formal dinner followed by a cocktail 
party. This was definitely our best rush 
in many years and the Lodge will reap 
the benefits of this supreme effort for 
many years to come, 
Due to the hard work of many actives 
especially #4. Jeff Henry '77. the Lodge 
is pointed in the direction of strength 
and prosperity. All alumni are welcome 
to visit at any time or just write and say 
hello. Look for the next "Omichronical." 
ALPHA PSI 
Cornell University 
Joe Lynch '78 
The youngest class of Alpha Psi is per-
haps the most varied group of new initi-
ates in the history of the Lodge. Covering 
ground on the football field are Dave 
Rupert. Steve Caputi, Mike Tanner, 
Frank Santamaria, Bruce McMahon, 
and Dave Kintgh. Returning to the 
NCAA championship lacrosse team are 
Joe Szombathy and Riley McDonald, 
while Scott Pickens and Tom Bishop 
man oars for the lightweight and heavy-
weight crew teams respectively. Mike 
Williams, Kevin Halloran, and Pete Call 
are representing the Cornell cagers and 
Joe Magid, recently recovering from a 
shoulder operation. specializes in the still 
rings for the gymnastic squad. 
Despite this concentration in organ-
ized sports, Alpha Psi has put together 
impressive intramural teams in football. 
soccer, basketball, volleyball, hockey, 
softball, swimming, track, wrestling, 
badminton, and lacrosse, and with each 
passing week the I.F.C. All Sports 
Trophy looms ever closer. 
Focusing the activities of our diversi-
fied Brotherhood is Jerry Krushin, 
present #1 and the remainder of the exec-
utive committee. Thus far, our social 
functions, including Homecoming, sev-
eral banquets, a surprise party for the 
football team following their victory over 
Harvard, and a few rush functions have 
been very successful and the future 
promises more of the same. Indeed, 1976 
should be an enjoyable and extremely 
worthwhile year at Alpha Psi.

ALPHA NU 
lIniversity of Minnesota 
J.D. Howell '78 
On October 9th many alumni came 
back to Alpha Nu for Homecoming. 
With an active-alumni football game 
and a Gopher victory, the day was as 
good as any. A pancake breakfast was 
put on by the pledges and a dance that 
evening made for a thoroughly enjoyable 
time. 
This fall Nu has 25 pledges. Although 
they slightly outnumber the active body, 
we expect an excellent group of men due 
mostly to the complete revamping of our 
old, outdated pledge training methods. 
In sports, besides the usual fall IM 
teams in football and swimming, we now 
have a soccer team. Although not doing 
very well in the standings both the foot-
ball and soccer teams have an unprece-
dented high level of enthusiasm. 
Initiation is scheduled for the week of 
December 3rd with the formal dance on 
December 4th at the St. Paul Athletic 
Club. Everyone is, of course, welcome. 
See you there.

wallpapering the dining room, carpeting

pledge project, painted the kitchen and 
the barroom.

ALPHA RHO 
Rutgers University 
Tom L)iGirolamo '78 
Alpha Rho was very honored to have 
as its guest this fall, Oliver R. Rowe. 
Brother Rowe spent two days with us 
and, in that short time, exchanged with 
us many ideas of fraternity in general, 
and more specifically, his most worth-
while "Program for Excellence". Oliver's 
visit to Rho will be remembered as a 
period of admiration and inspiration for 
our brother who has done so much for 
our fraternity and he leaves us a great 
deal of inspiration, not only to be better 
Chi Psis, but better men. Brother Rowe's 
visit concluded when he presented the 
fraternity's Distinguished Service Award 
to Brother Tilford G. (Gerry) Wharton, 
at a banquet held in Brother Wharton's 
honor. 
Alumni relations is a topic which has 
been of great concern to Alpha Rho this 
year. Brother Wharton is only one of the 
many honored and distinguished Rho 
alumni whom we, as actives, would be 
honored to know and share our fraternal 
experiences with. This fall we sent out 
questionnaires to many of our alumni 
and held post-football game receptions, 
all for the purpose of getting to know our 
alumni more closely. Brotherhood is 
something we all have in common from 
the day we are initiated until the day we 
die; actives and alumni sharing their 
experiences can only strengthen that 
brotherhood. 
ALPHA XI

Robert Platt '78 
Alpha Xi, led by Brother Ken Skor-
enko '78, has started off this term with 
an outstanding pledge class of thirteen 
men. We are certain that these men will 
become fine Brothers under the inspired 
leadership of Brother Robert Platt, '78. 
Socially, this looks to be a fine year 
with many parties and social events. 
Highlights include Chi Psi Weekend 
held the weekend of November 12, which 
featured a cocktail party, a band party, 
and a Broadway play. Also planned are 
a Casino Night and an Alumni party. 
In late October, we had a Halloween 
party. 
Athletically, the Lodge is having a 
good season. Currently, we are in second 
place in football and in first place in 
ping pong. Playing for Stevens from the 
Lodge are five lacrosse players and three 
ning to insulate the attic. Other than 
that there is nothing in need of repair. 
We are still receiving fine cooperation 
from our Alumni Association led by Bro-
ther Dale Jacquish, Xi '70 and from our 
Parents' Club. This should be a very suc-
cessful semester. 
ALPHA ALPHA DELTA 
University of Georgia 
Glen Joanis '79 
A strong fall rush highlighted a prom-
ising quarter at Alpha Delta. During this 
time we gained twenty pledges. 
These will be the first pledges to par-
ticipate in our revised pledge and Big 
Brother program. Basically, the program 
involves a more informal method of 
training the pledges in their duties and 
responsibilities as they progress toward 
becoming brothers. Also, the brother-
hood will be more responsible for spend-
ing more time with each pledge so that 
both may have a better opportunity to 
get acquainted. 
House improvements including instal-
lation of a new sanitary system, painting 
several rooms, and adding shrubbery to 
the yard have all been successful projects 
around the lodge. 
In sports, Alpha Delta is continuing 
its winning tradition. The football team 
is undefeated after three games. We are 
also excelling in tennis and there is an 
excellent chance that our singles and 
doubles teams will be league champs. 
Academically, Alpha Delta is doing 
very well also, with several brothers being 
named to national honoraries and How-
ell Haunson, #1, being named to Grid-
iron Secret Society. 
Fall quarter 1976 is every bit as pros-
perous as we hoped it would be and we 
hope that any brothers and alumni who 
are in the area will stop by to see us. The 
invitation is always open.

The fall semester has been flying by 
this year at Beta Delta. It began in late 
August, with the sophomores coming 
back a week early to clean up the Lodge. 
They were supervised by #2, Rob Abele, 
who also helped them paini: walls and 
ceiling in the living room, dining room 
and foyer. 
Rik Shiiki, Alpha Advisor visited the 
Lodge at the end of September. We are 
always pleased to have visitors from the 
National stop by and see how we are 
doing. We were also visited by several 
brothers from Xi and Rho during Oc-
tober. 
Rush began at the end of September 
and will last until February. So far it's 
going pretty well. We are confident of 
getting another strong class this year.

our annual Halloween party for under-
privileged children with the Gamma 
Phi Beta sorority on October 30. Thirty 
children trick or treated through the 
Lodge and were treated to a party after-
wards. 
Intramurals are playing an important 
part in Chi Psi's schedule. Our football 
team is faring well with wrestling, bowl-
ing and volleyball starting soon. 
Other activities this year have included 
weekly functions, the selection of a court 
and a Casino night housedance. A re-
treat on the McKenzie River is being 
planned with the Alpha Phis. 
A special invitation is extended to all 
Brothers who may be in the area to stop 
by.

Alpha Delta Delta started the '76 
school year off by getting ten pledges in 
the fall rush. Added to this were the six 
pledges we got from informal spring 
rush. Together, this gave Delta Delta its 
largest pledge class in many years. 
Delta Delta has two alumni events 
planned for the near future. The first 
will be the annual Alumni-Family day 
held before the Stanford-Cal, Big-game, 
November 20th, at the Lodge. The sec-
ond event will be the Initiation Banquet 
to be held in late January. 
With the enthusiasm of our great new 
pledge class, the actives of Delta Delta 
forsee a great year ahead.

catching up with the cost of living, there 
has been a lot of internal investment in 
the Lodge, including a new TV, two 
sofas, carpeting, and fresh paint all over. 
After a particularly industrious Clean-
up Week, the twenty returning Brothers 
pledged eight very capable and enthu-
siastic new men. The Brothers and 
pledges are currently continuing with a 
strong informal rush, as well as rushing 
our second class of Little Sisters and had 
a successful Homecoming Weekend. 
Also, Chi Psi IM teams are currently 
undefeated, with the football team 2-0, 
and the coed volleyball team 1-0. 
The Brothers would like to invite all 
actives and alumni to initiation, which is 
tentatively scheduled for January 6.

Our fall pledge class brought in 13 
outstanding potential brothers. It helps 
carry forth our feelings that quality is 
the most vital attribute of a pledge class. 
The new pledges are: Chris Larson,

month. Many of the brothers had an op-
portunity to meet the members of the in-
tegral group behind the scenes at Psi 
Delta, A Board meeting after dinner 
concluded the evening. 
Our goal this semester is to increase 
alumni participation in the Lodge. We 
invite all alumni to stop by the Lodge in 
Boulder and once again become part of

What's Happening at 
Theta ? Williams College? 
Rumor told us that fraternities are re-
turning to Williams College. Alumni of 
Alpha Theta, upon hearing this rumor 
have been firing questions to the Central 
Office about their old Alpha. Realizing 
their concern, a staff member went to 
Williams to personally investigate the 
situation. To provide the source of these 
rumors, a little background is appro-
priate. 
Last spring, a group formed at Wil-
liams and called itself the Adelphic 
Literary Society. The Society then peti-
tioned the Alpha Delta Phi International 
to discuss the possibility of a reformation 
of the Williams chapter of Alpha Delta 
Phi. An article discussing this matter 
appeared in the Alpha Delta Phi news-
letter, a copy of which reached the Chi 
Psi Central Office. 
On the day before the Chi Psi staff 
member visited Williams College in 
early October, the Adelphic Literary 
Society had officially disband. Excerpts 
from a letter written by the Society read: 
"Those Students having formerly 
participated in the activities of an organ-
ization known as the Adelphic Literary 
Society wish to inform and assure the 
College that the group has dissolved it-
self and that its members have dis-
banded . . . 
"We have informed the national orga-
nization that our society will cease to 
exist on or off the Williams College 
campus. The Adelphic Literary Society 
never recieved a charter as an Alpha 
Delta Phi fraternity. Additionally, none 
of its present undergraduate members 
were ever initiated into the fraternity." 
The Williams Record, the newspaper 
of' the College, paraphased Dean Peter 
Berek. Dean of Williams, stating "The 
College 'respectfully and forcefully re-
quested' that the fraternity cease 'inter-
fering in the internal affairs' of Wil-
liams." 
Upon arrival in Williamstown, the Chi 
Psi staff member was introduced to Dean 
Berek. Dean Berek assured Chi Psi that 
Williams is not ready for the return of 
fraternities nor will it ever be in the 
future. Dean Berek expressed particular 
concern and distress at any fraternal or-
ganization that would operate sub rosa. 
Dean Berek justified himself stating that 
Williams experienced incompatibility 
with the fraternity system in the sixties 
proving an incompatibility with the fra-
ternity system now and any time in the 
future. Dean Berek was also quoted in 
the Williams Record, as saying "The 
College 'would have to take appropriate 
action' if students turned to fraterni-
ties." A study at Williams conducted by 
the Committee on Undergraduate Life 
revealed that only 7% of the student 
body favored a return of the fraternity 
system. 
To summarize the situation at Wil 
Hams, President Chandler of Williams 
College characterized the return of fra-
ternities as resulting in "a great deal of 
diverted energy and attention that would 
do no one any good." 
Finally, Dean Berek quoted specifi-
cally to our staff member during their 
meeting from the Williams College Stu-
dent Handbook: "Participation by un-
dergraduates in fraternities at Williams 
College is prohibited as a matter of edu-
cational policy." 
The Central Office can only assure 
alumni of Theta that we will keep tabs 
on the situation, dreary as it may look at 
this point. 
Trust's Pilot Program: Career Internship 
Chi Psi Educational Trust approved 
a new pilot program which it calls the 
Career Internship Program. Five under-
graduates will be selected to test this 
pilot program next summer. The Central 
Office will seek an appropriate intern-
ship through Chi Psi Alumni able to pro-
vide such an opportunity to these under-
graduates. To establish an internship, 
the Central Office will provide alumni a 
description of goals the Trust would like 
the internship to accomplish and ask for 
suggestions as to how the internship 
position might be developed in their 
organizations. Through this, the pro-
gram hopes to establish a close relation-
ship between the Chi Psi alumnus and 
the undergraduate will benefit from 
close work with an alumnus actively 
involved at a high level of a business or 
a professional career. The undergrad-
uate can then evaluate his own desires 
for such a career and measure himself 
against the demands of that career. 
Chi Psi has some 17,000 alumni in a 
variety of occupations and professions. 
The Trust feels that Chi Psi Fraternity 
can provide the common link to join the 
undergraduates to alumni with intern-
ships to offer. The Trust also feels that 
most universities lack "experiential edu-
cation" for their students and that such 
an internship program will be an inval-
uable supplement to an undergraduate's

As of September, the Chi Psi Educa-
tional Trust successfully completed rais-
ing contributions from alumni and 
Foundations to match the $50.000 per 
year, ten-year challenge gill from the 
Temple Buell Foundation. In conjunc-
tion with this matching gift program, the 
Trustees have committed themselves to 
a substantial capital effort to increase 
the Trust to live times its current size. 
The motivation for this capital effort be-
gan with the Buell Challenge Gift, and 
has been encouraged by many alumni 
and foundations nationwide who are 
expressing willingness to give to the 
Trust to promote and extend experien-
tial programs available to undergrad-
uates and alumni of Chi Psi. 
The Chi Psi Educational Trust, a pub-
lic foundation, is a tax-exempt vehicle 
that can be of great help in promoting 
educational opportunities lOr college 
undergraduates. The Trust has tra-
ditionally offered scholarships and aca-
demic improvement awards, and over 
the past 15 years has been active in sup-
porting and promoting the addition of 
library and study facilities to Chi Psi 
Lodges. Since 1965, the Trust has spon-
sored a motivation achievement pro-
gram, called the "Program for Self-
Development", which has been ac-
claimed and copied by other fraternities. 
Because of the effectiveness of this self-
development program, the Trustees 
are increasing support for the program 
to further its effectiveness by providing 
follow-up sessions to the initial weekend 
seminar. 
In an ellOrt to keep the programs of 
I he Trust current with the needs of 
today's undergraduates. the Trustees 
are now in the process of establishing 
new program emphases. The Trustees 
recognize that Chi Psi is in a unique 
position, having membership of both 
undergraduateti and alumni, to comple-
ment the academic programs offered by 
most universities. In an effort to take 
advantage of this position, the Trustees 
are establishing a Career Internship Pro-
gram, which would bring Chi Psi under-
graduates and alumni together in pro-
moting experiential education. 
The Trustees also see that the fra-
ternity experience comes at an important 
time in the moral growth of its under-
graduate members, and the Trustees are

of the meeting follow: 
1) Brother Steve Gould, Chairman of 
the Nominations Committee, noted that 
there would be at least three vacancies 
on the Executive Council at the 1977 
convention. Any alumni with nomina-

loss for the fiscal year ending July 31. 
1976, the budget shows a proposed gain 
for the year of $13.000. 
3) Pros and Cons of the convention date 
were reviewed. There were problems with 
having the convention in either June or

San Francisco Shop 
Does a Brisk Trade 
In the Works of Mao 
Store's American Owner Shuns 
Politics; Red China Doesn't 
Mind Not Getting Its Money 
NIALL,STRLET JOURNAL 
ease 2004/11/61?: illiik-A?P88-01315R00R00360q61,76 c 
By HUGH SPITZER 
Staff Reporter of Tim WALL STREET. JOURNAL 
SAN FRANCISCO ? Posters of Chairman 
Mao plaster the shop's walls. The Peking Op-
era's version of "The East Is Red" plays on a 
phonograph. Bookshelves are jammed with the 
works of Mao?including copies of the famous 
"little red book" in :30 languages. 
The store could be in Canton or Peking, but 
it happens to be a Yankee enterprise called, 
China Books and Periodicals. From its quar-
ters in the Mission District of San Francisco, 
China Books does a booming nationwide busi-
ness in publications, posters and phonograph 
records put out by Red China. 
One reason the store does well is that it's 
one of only two U.S. concerns that are licensed I 
by the Treasury Department to import pub-
lished material from Communist China. (The 
other license holder is China Publications of 
New York.) 
Another reason for China Books' success is 
that the paraphernalia of Maoism are very 
?much the rage these days among young people, 
particularly those who align themselves with 
the radical student movement. China Books' 
hottest selling items are buttons with Mao's 
picture on them and the little red 
books, officially titled "Quotations from Chair-
man Mao Tse-tung." The store also does? a 
brisk traffic in books and pamphlets on the 
techniques of guerrilla warfare. 
500,000 Publications a Year 
The store's owner is a tall, friendly 58-year-
old named Robert Noyes. Mr. Noyes, who says 
he is apolitical, started his firm nine years ago 
in Chicago with 5200 and the import license, 
and now he says he sells more than 500,000 
books and magazines a year. 
China Books regularly supplies Red Chinese 
literature to libraries, colleges and individual 
China scholars. It even gets orders from the 
U.S. military services, as well as from politi-
cally oriented groups on both the far left and 
far right. Though it maintains a retail opera-
tion, most of its business consists of wholesal-
ing to some 1,000 bookstore customers scat-
tered around the U.S. 
"Awareness of the differences between 
China and Russia and China's development of 
the H-bomb have both contributed to the in-
creasing interest in China in this country,", 
says Mr. Noyes. "We've grown with that inter-
est." 
China Books gets all English-language pub-
lications put out by Peking's :Guozi Shudian, or 
China Publications Center, as well as some 
Chinese-language classics that have been ap-
proved for distribution by the Communist re: 
gime. The English-language books range from 
slick, lavishly illustrated volumes on art or 
travel ("China?Land of Charm and Beauty") 
to heavy tomes on Maoist theory ("Training 
Successors for the Revolution Is the Party's 
Strategic Task.") Approved For Rel 
P S

There are even children's bedtime stories 
with a revolutionary twist. A book called "I 
Am on Duty Today" follows a toddler sporting 
a red armband as she does her daily chores?
helping her little brother dress, feeding the 
rabbits and obeying her teacher at school, all 
according to the thoughts of Mao. 
Money Never :Reaches China 
Though China Books regularly pays out 
money for the books it sells, the funds never 
reach Red China. Because Federal law prohib-
its any transactions that would put U.S. dollars 
into Red Chinese hands, all income due the Pe-
king publishing house is held in blocked ac-
counts in U.S. hanks here. 
"But China's main interest is having its ma-
terials read abroad, though they wouldn't mind 
being paid some day," says Mr. Noyes. 
Because of the touchy nature .of relations, 
between the U.S. and Red China., Mr. Noyes 
makes a point of remaining personally aloof 
from politics, both domestic and international. 
He says he has a "full understanding" of 
Marxism and has "studied the socialist system 
in China with great interest and concern." But 
he adds that he strictly avoids political involve-
ment "because it's inappropriate in this busi-
ness." 
Mr. Noyes' interest in China is a long-stand-
ing one. He was born there and lived his first 
eight years with his Presbyterian missionary 
parents in Canton. He later won bachelor's and 
master's degrees in English from the Univer-. 
sity of Toronto and a doctorate from the Uni-
versity of London. He wrote three novels at 
night while working during the day as a. tool. 
and die maker, but none Were published. (He 
continues, however, to write poetry as a 
h,obby.) 
When an old friend who had imported 
Chinese publications during tile 195ns suggested 
that Mr. Noyes take over the business, he 
:jumped at the opportunity. "It seemed a natu-
ral thing lo do," he says, "China has always 
been like a second home." 
Mr. Noyes put his wife and two teen-aged - 
children to work filling orders. When the busi-
ness grew too large for their Chicago home in : 
1963, they moved to San Francisco and opened 
the shop. His wife and children, now grown, 
still, are his only full4ime .employes.

Students protest CIA 
The Chicano Associated Student 
Organization (CASO) is holding a 
peaceful protest in front of Ford Hall 
at Highlands today to dampen CIA 
recruitment of minority students. 
Levi Borunda, speaking for CASO, 
said the organization feels the CIA 
recruits Latinos and other minority 
groups to infiltrate and dismember 
S minority organizations.  
CASO reportedly heard of today's 
CIA recruitment plans nearly two 
weeks ago and scheduled the 
protest. 
"We hope to have slowed down the 
recruiting process" Borunda 
commented. 'I think we've been 
pretty effective.. .we have a lot of 
support from the student body and 
Faculty."

Christian Anti-Communism Crusade 
THE CUBAN GULAG 
April 15, 197,7 
"If you can't lick 'em, join 'em". This is the policy that lurks behind the mask of devotion to Human 
Rights which conceals the present program of progressive surrender to communism. 
Out of one side of his mouth the President tells of his devotion to Human Rights. Out of the other he 
assures those who deny human rights to their people that he will do nothing about it. "There is no 
linkage," he emphasizes. This only applies to enemies as action is definitely taken against friendly 
countries where human rights are slighted. 
Cuba is riding high. The Cuban military forces form the mercenary army of the Soviet Union which 
provides the guns and weapons the Cuban forces use and the money to pay the troops. It is reported 
that the Soviet Union is subsidizing Cuba to the extent of $3 million per day. The Soviet Union can 
give this money because of the credits granted them by the capitalist world to buy the goods produced 
by the capitalist system and which now exceed $40 billion. The Cuban forces, paid servants of the 
Soviet, conquer Angola and impose a minority Communist Government on the Angola people. Angola 
then serves as a sanctuary for communist-influenced and led rebels to invade Zaire. Thus the malig-
nant process proceeds. 
The Cuban conquest of Angola is serving as a model for the conquest of other African states as Cuban 
troops are based in African countries which are favorable to the Soviet Union to train and lead, or 
prepare to lead, troops for the conquest of neighbors. The trustworthy English journal, THE ECONO-
MIST, reports that a major military and economic partnership is developing between Cuba and Libya. 
Cuban tank crews and advisers will help Libya absorb the massive new deliveries of Soviet equipment 
while Libya will give Cuba part of her large oil revenues. The deal will involve 5,000-7,500 Cuban 
troops in Libya who will consist mostly of tank crews, infantrymen and pilots, and their primary duty 
will be to train Libyans to utilize advanced Soviet weapons systems. While the Libyan Army will 
exercise formal command, the orders will come from the Russian officers in charge of the reconstruction 
of the Libyan army. 
Castro and Oaddafi, the Libyan dictator, are reported to have agreed that their military partnership 
will operate in future ventures in Africa and the Middle East. They are also reported to have agreed 
to cooperate in accelerating their training of international terrorists in Cuba and Libya. 
Qaddafi has offered Castro $250 million for the first year and larger sums later, accepting sugar as 
repayment. 
Human Rights in Cuba  
This is a strange time to be adding to Cuba's capacity to extend world communism by military force. 
The Cuban record in the field of human rights is appalling. 
Consider the question of Political Prisoners. There is general agreement that the number is very large

and estimates range from 5,000 to 100,000 as shown in the following table: 
HOW MANY POLITICAL PRISONERS? 
How many political prisoners are there in Cuba now? 
Estimates vary widely. 
?The U.S. State Department and the International Res-
cue Committee, among others, estimate 20,000. This is the 
same figure Fidel Castro gave American journalist Lee 
Lockwood in mid-I965. 
?The National Council of Churches says the figure is 
now 10,000. 
?Some members of Miami's Cuban exile community use 
figures estimating political prisoners in excess of 100,000. 
?Frank Greve and Miguel Perez of the Miami Herald 
have written extensively on Cuban political prisoners. They 
estimate there are approximately 20,000-5,000 from the 
Revolution's first six years, and the remaining 15,000 
arrested since 1965. But, they add, "nobody really 
knows." 
?In a July, 1975, speech Castro spoke of the 5,000 
pre-1965 political prisoners, saying that 3,000 are in 
reeducation camps and 2,000 remain in prisons. Two 
thousand was the same figure cited by a foreign ministry 
official to Alton Frye, senior fellow of the Council on 
Foreign Relations, when Frye visited Cuba in August, 
1976. 
-00ther estimates include those of the Journal de Geneve, 
which reported that there were some 50,000 political 
prisoners in March, 1976. In June, 1975, the Washington 
Post published an estimate of 25,000-50,000. 
?Another responsible scholar of Cuban prisoner issues, 
Frank Calzon, points out that periodic waves of political 
arrests and prisoner releases indicate the total number of 
Cubans who have experienced the political prisons may be 
significantly larger than any present or past incarceration 
figure. 
'The Anmesty International Report for 1975-1976 esti-
mates "approximately 4,000-5,000" current political 
prisoners in Cuba. This estimate, the report says, was 
"based on recent Cuban government statements to visitors 
and public speeches by officials." Amnesty uses the same 
approximate figure, "less than 5,000," for estimating the 
current number of political prisoners in Chile. 
WORLDV1EW / JANUARY! FEBRUARY 1977 
The precise number is difficult to obtain as Cuba does not permit investigations by delegations of 
neutral or hostile newsmen, attorneys, etc. as Chile does. The paradox is that the more independent 
investigators are excluded from a country, the better press that country receives. This is because an 
investigative reporter can receive much more publicity for an expose' based upon interviews with 
political prisoners than he can for a report that he has been denied permission to visit and interview 
prisoners. The relative freedom Chile grants to outside investigators accounts in considerable measure 
for the bad press Chile continues to receive in this country. 
Nevertheless, reports of the deplorable conditions of political prisoners in Cuba periodically appear. 
One such report is the January-February editon of WORLDVIEW, which is published by the Council 
on Religion and International Affairs which is predominantly liberal. This account is entitled "The 
Yellow Uniforms of Cuba", and the author is Theodore Jacqueney. He writes: 
" 'In Cuba, political prisoners wear yellow uniforms', the wife of one prisoner told me in 
Havana. Originally, the color was meant to be punitive--the same color worn by the army of 
defeated dictator Fulgencio Batista, with obvious implications. 'In the late 1960's,' said 
another political prisoner's relative, 'when my father was with Huber Matos and others in Cinco 
Y Medio prison, located five-and-a-half miles from Pinar Del Rio, a prison director tried to 
require political prisoners to change to the blue uniforms worn by common criminals. Led by 
Matos and his cell mates, political prisoners protested being lumped with common criminals, and 
refused to wear the blue uniforms. They were severely beaten.' Some political prisoners then 
accepted the new color, but Matos and his followers never relented. 'They were forced to go 
without any clothes at all for four months. The guards said that if they refused the blue uniforms 
they must go naked. 
" 'After four months they were permitted to wear undershorts--nothing else, not even shoes. They 
lived like this, in their underwear, for more than a year more--four months without any clothes, 
and more than a year with only undershorts. At the end, sometime in 1968, they were given the 
yellow uniforms again and transferred to Boniato Prison in Oriente province--where we hear that 
many prisoners are killed, even today. Matos and the others had opposed Batista, fought against

him in every way. They had no affection for the old regime at all. But now the government 
has changed the meaning of a yellow uniform?for us it is now a uniform of honor.' 
Page 3 
"In early October, 1976, I spent a week in Cuba interviewing released political prisoners, fami-
lies and friends of still-detained political prisoners, and other underground opponents of Fidel 
Castro's government. Havana authorities do not grant entry visas to people known to be interested 
in questions of oppression and human rights in Cuba--for years officials of Amnesty International, 
the worldwide political prisoner relief organization, the Red Cross, the Organization of American 
States, and others have unsuccessfully sought permission to visit political prisoners. When a 
friend suggested that I join a group of progressive Republican Ripon Society members invited to 
tour Cuba, I neglected to mention the full range of my interests to Cuban U.N. officials charged 
with clearing visitors. 
"Once in Havana I rarely went on the thoughtfully programmed official tours. Instead, after 
the others had left for scheduled trips, I visited people to whom I had brought introductions. One 
interview with a group of obviously frightened women who had overcome their fears to talk to me 
set the tone for many of my conversations in Cuba: The first words spoken after my contact intro-
duced me were, 'What do you hear in America about our political prisoners?' Another time a 
man who carefully described himself as a 'center-leftist,' suddenly blurted out, 'When I heard 
on a foreign radio broadcast of the Organization of American States investigating political pris-
oners in Chile, I cried. Why don't they come here and look into our political prisoners who have 
been treated as harshly as in Chile and have been in prison so much longer?' 
"Through people like these I was able to send and receive messages from political prisoners held 
in maximum security, and from them I learned that for about a month prior to my October visit, 
political prisoners in LaCabana Prison, near Havana, had been rejecting the food normally 
brought to them by the guards because the quality was 'so rotten.' ...'Rotting maize porridge 
served with salt and water twice daily, with rice, meat, fish, and vegetables served only rarely, 
producing severe protein deficiencies,' I was told. There are approximately four hundred politi-
cal prisoners--called plantados--held in LaCabana's subterranean 'galleries' (long, narrow prison 
wards sleeping about sixty to seventy men in tiered bunk beds in LaCabana Prison, one hundred 
or more in other prisons, usually with one toilet per ward). 
The Case of Huber Matos 
"I communicated with cell mates of Huber Matos in LaCabana Prison. Perhaps the best known 
Cuban political prisoner, Matos is a onetime Amnesty International 'political prisoner of the 
year.' He was a ranking commander in Castro's rebel army and became a military commander 
of Camaguey province in January, 1959, immediately following revolutionary victory. Ten 
months later he resigned, protesting increased Communist domination of the new regime, and 
was arrested on the now ironic charge of 'slandering the Revolution by calling it 'Communist,' 
a charge later changed to 'treason'. Sentenced to twenty years, Matos has been kept in various 
political prisons since October, 1959. Matos has been held incommunicado for the past six years. 
Members of his family in Cuba, including his father who now is over ninety years old, have re-
peatedly tried to visit Matos during this period--all unsuccessfully. 
"The 'Matos cell' was described to me as sixty square meters, underground. During the past six 
years between seven and sixteen men have been crowded into the cell. Seven are there now. 
The Matos cell is said to be kept in total darkness--a canvas sheet woven over the cell's two

windows to block the daylight has been replaced by metal sheets which keep the room darker, 
hotter, and more humid than ever. An interior hall provides the cell's only ventilation. The men 
are permitted to see sunlight only three days per week, for two-hour periods. 'In the summer they 
have to carry water into the cell to pour over themselves. Otherwise they could not live because 
of the heat,' I was told. 
"Almost every LaCabana prisoner has allegedly suffered the loss of many teeth, and a few have 
lost them all. Prisoners are also infected by rats, mice, and 'all kinds of insects.' A kind of 
biting bedbug was described as particularly troublesome. From the Matos cell prisoners report 
steadily worsening vision loss caused by lack of light, limb paralysis, hair and eyebrow hair loss, 
stomach ulcers, and circulation problems. Another disturbing health crisis was described to me 
as extreme 'nervousness,' with symptoms explained as uncontrollable head-flickings, eye-dartings, 
rapid gestures, and sleeplessness--some in the Matos cell are reported to wake up screaming 
through the night--symptoms possibly caused by long-term, closely packed, dark, hot, damp liv-
ing conditions." (Pages 4 and 5) 
The following is a letter from Huber Matos: 
LETTER FROM A HAVANA PRISON 
Huber Matos 
If the spiritual state is holding up I cannot say the same 
for my physical state. I am old and ailing. I am a shadow of 
the man who entered prison in October 1959. Most of my 
hair has fallen out, and what remains is gray or white. Deep 
lines run from my eyes to chin. My thick dark eyebrows 
have completely disappeared. Only 56 years old, but I look 
like an old man. 
The ups and downs of my health remind me of those old 
worn-out suits which, despite their many patches, still have 
a hole here and there. The good thing is that my spirit has no 
holes, nor will I allow them. And if my hair has fallen out, 
my energies have not gone with my hair. Privation and 
suffering, however hard, cannot undermine my spirit. 
Even so, in recent months I have had the unpleasant 
experience of losing the use of my left arm, the result of an 
occurrence you already know about. Having experienced 
for a year and a half the loss of feeling in my arm, it became 
obvious that my shoulder had atrophied. I have been visited 
by more than one doctor, amongst them a captain, a 
specialist in orthopedics, who diagnosed atrophy in mid-
November. 
At the same time he explained that the condition was 
incurable and that the course of treatment 1 should follow 
should aim at preventing total loss of the arm's movement. I 
am following this course, which basically consists of 
exercises, heat and pills. I can definitely confirm that the 
exercises I do day after day according to the doctor's 
instructions permit me to retain such movement as I now 
have. 
I do not give much importance to this circumstance since 
I was prepared for a greater loss of movement, and because 
my healthy spirits are not to be dampened by such clouds. 
From time to time I still amuse myself humming old songs. I 
still get up each morning and go to bed each night thinking 
of my dear wife and of the children. 
?Excerpts from a letter to his family, dated 
March 10, 1975, smuggled out of prison. 
Translated from Spanish for the New York 
Times. 
...The reality we breathe tells us we belong to another 
world, that we are buried in the bowels of the earth. 
There is something in my situation which gives me more 
pain than imprisonment itself. It is to be labeled and treated 
as an enemy of the People, knowing as 1 do that I am part of 
that People, and that their cause is my cause, although a 
considerable distance separates me from the system and the 
men who rule our country. 
Nothing unites me to the latifundistus, the monopolies, 
the personages of the old order, nor to the crimes, vices and 
privileges that the Revolution destroyed. I would not give 
one drop of my blood or sweat to revive the "elected" and 
corrupt Republic which was born in 1902, a deformed 
creature of North American intervention on the ashes of the 
ideals and sacrifices of true Cubans. But, in sum, this is my 
fate and I am resigned to it. 
It is hardly pleasant to expose you to these truths. I 
should like to offer a more optimistic picture--but I could 
only do so by putting on rose-colored glasses. What is true 
is that when they try to tarnish my "Cubanness" everything 
within me rebels. 
And if I explain to you 
because here freedom is 
how I contemplate the future it is 
more a dream than a hope, and 
dreams are lost in infinity when confronted by the dawn of 
reality. Where more or less long-term prisoners are con-
cerned, the system which reigns in Cuba leaves little 
margin for hope. 
Of course there are prisoners who, either through naivete 
or self-deception, believe that the Government will not 
survive long and hope to be released from prison in a burst 
of happiness which cannot be far off. Others, the majority, 
simply hope for liberty. 
My viewpoint is a minority one. If only it were mistaken! 
I know you are hoping I shall be free within the next few 
years; I know that you are making efforts to free me and 
relying on the help of apolitical organizations and people of 
good will. I am grateful for the good all those generous 
souls wish to do for me, but in truth it seems difficult to 
return to my home and life from the bowels of the earth.

Women in Prison 
"Granja Nuevo Amanacer at Punta Brava was singled out as a prison reputed for mistreating women 
political prisoners. Some are kept in solitary confinement for long periods, others stacked into 
'galleries' at a hundred or more women per ward, it was charged. Allegations of poor food, heavy 
on corn-flour porridge, with concomitant protein deficiencies, matched complaints concerning 
male political prisoners, as did charges of insect and rodent-plagued wards. The women also report 
the same extensive loss of teeth that the men do. As in the men's prisons, the women political 
prisoners report deplorable medical inattention, with deprivation of health care sometimes used to 
coerce prisoners. I was told by a relation about a woman in Nuevo Amanacer who was not permit-
ted to have a desperately needed cancer operation 'until she promised to change her political ideas 
and attitudes. And thus she was rehabilitated,' said my bitter informant. 
Rehabilitation 
"The Cuban Government offers a 'rehabilitation' program to political prisoners. A prisoner who 
accepts may eventually receive less rigorous treatment, including possible transfer to a work camp 
setting where 'sanitation is better, sleeping arrangements less crowded, food is better, with more 
protein, including fresh milk. Many rehabilitation camp prisoners are required to construct dairies,' 
said one freed rehabilitation camp prisoner. Rehabilitation camp inmates must do manual labor, 
primarily construction or mining, with occasional agricultural fieldwork; prisoners are even build-
ing a new 'model prison' located near the capital that inmates call 'Havana East.' On paper, 
rehabilitation prisoners are permitted furloughs every forty-five days. Vocational and political 
indoctrination classes are also provided. At one of the few scheduled events I attended, Supreme 
Court Justice Nicasio Hernandez de Armas told me that the indoctrination classes were voluntary. 
Coercive Voluntarism 
"However, 'accepting' rehabilitation was not always voluntary, my informants charge. I frequently 
heard of prisoners who rejected rehabilitation and refused forced labor only to find that at the com-
pletion of their sentences their terms had been extended a year. The next year [the prisoner] was 
asked to accept rehabilitation and told that if he did not accept, he would remain for another year 
--and the next year, the same thing... Over and over again I asked contacts why prisoners re-
jected the rehabilitation plan--the possibility of doing easier time and eventual freedom--for the 
certainty of harsh treatment and continued detention. 
The Love of Liberty 
" 'More than four hundred prisoners in LaCabana have followed the example of Huber Matos and 
not accepted the plan,' I was told. 'Rehabilitation requires the prisoner to renounce his political 
principles, to say they are wrong,' said a relative of one of the La Cabana four hundred. 'Most 
of the prisoners believe that the issue causing their imprisonment is the issue of liberty, of personal 
freedom in Cuba, and they will not say they were mistaken about this.' 
"A group of prisoners sent another message, put together in consultation, I was told: 'Tell the world 
we are suffering in Cuba's prisons. You asked about 'human rights' in Cuba. In Cuba these two 
words are unknown. Cuba and Cubans would like to be free. Help them please. And guard the 
liberty you have.' Yet another Cuban dissident told me: 'We hear that sometimes foreigners are 
permitted to visit political prisoners who have accepted rehabilitation. But permission to see those

who feel strongly about liberty is always refused, because it is said that such people are held in 
'maximum security'. Ideas like those of Matos and the others, you see, must be held in maximum 
security.' 
Permission to Visit Prisoners Denied 
"While in Cuba I formally requested permission to visit three well-known political prisoners. This 
I did in carefully written letters citing human rights concerns by progressive and influential U.S. 
leaders?letters I personally handed to about half a dozen cabinet and subcabinet officials and a 
supreme court justice. The three were: 
*Huber Matos 
*David Salvador--once a key leader of Castro's urban revolutionaries and who headed Cuba's trade 
union confederation after the victory. Salvador was arrested in November, 1960, in an attempt to 
escape Cuba after Castro turned on leaders of his old 26th of July Movement who, because they 
held ideas of free speech, free press, free elections, and free trade unionism, opposed dominance 
of the new government by Communists. 
*Miguel Sales--a twenty-five-year-old poet whose works have been published in the U.S. 
"There was never an official response to my letters or my verbal requests to see these men. 
Cuban Elections 
" 'These elections are a comedy,' said one former prisoner. 'Only Communists or Communist-
approved candidates can run. They were selected by a show of hands at assemblies--not by secret 
ballot--and they can be coerced from participating by the Municipal Election Committees, which 
supervise the election and which are controlled by Party members. No one may campaign, no one 
can say 'vote for me and I will order the Committees for Defense of the Revolution [the Party-
controlled community membership associations with heavy police functions] to stop spying on neigh-
bors; that if you vote for me, I will try to control the organs of State Security, the G-2 and the 
DGI secret police, to stop them from coming into everyone's house at any time, searching every-
where, arresting everyone.' If you could say such things, Castro and the Communists could not 
win a free election. A free election--such an idea is utopian, a fantasy.' 
The Trade Embargo  
"Ove Pend over again government officials encountered on the tour voiced demands that the U.S. 
end IV Cuban trade embargo. Communicating this demand to Americans was clearly, I thought, a 
key purpose for inviting Ripon Republicans to Havana. But the Cuban dissidents with whom I was 
in ccitact agreed; they too wanted the embargo lifted and the diplomatic and trade relations 
normcitized between the U.S. and Cuba, although for different reasons than their government. 
"Phe embargo problem is the most important for the political prisoners, and for all of us fighting 
fSigo democratic process,' said an officially 'rehabilitated' prisoner once jailed for anti-Castro 
acVities. 'Isolation from the U.S. is for the prisoners more important than food, teeth, disease, 
eve0thing. Tell them in the U.S. that the blockade helps Fidel Castro. It gives him an excuse 
tocplain his big economic mistakes, and the political prisons--all mistakes in this country are 
exillained by the blockade. If we fail in the price of sugar, it is the blockade. If there is not 
eno%h coffee, if we do not have petrol, if prices are too high and goods are scarce, it is the 
blocikpde. In my opinion the blockade is wrong.'

The Cuban Dissidents 
0-tt-010( (7711 TA/a, // 
" 'My friends and I hear about the underground in Russia, about Samizdat, about Solzhenitsyn and 
Sakharov and others of the Russian resistance. Do you think we do not have our Cuban Solzhenit-
syns, our Sakharovs? How could we not, when we are so close to your country and respect the 
ideas of your country, the democratic process, freedom, liberty? Of course we have people like 
them here. But how is the world to know, and how can they be protected by world opinion, like 
the Russians, if there are no journalists here to meet them and write about them, if Castro can 
arrest them and they disappear?' " (Pages 5 through 10) 
The author reports that those Cuban dissidents whom he met, favor the lifting of the embargo on trade 
with Cuba. If this is done, it should be coupled with a continuing campaign to expose the treatment 
of Cuban political prisoners and the denial of basic human rights to the Cuban people. As the commu-
nists are so fond of saying, "detente does not mean the cessation of the ideological war." Literature and 
radio messages exposing the plight of the prisoners should flood Cuba and the world till the names of 
Huber Matos, David Salvador, and Miguel Sales are as well known round the world as those of Sakharov 
and Solzhenitsyn. 
CUBAN AGENTS WITHIN THE U.S.A. 
On September 21, 1976, Orlando Letelier, former Foreign Minister of the Allende Government in 
Chile, was assassinated by a car-bomb in ashington, D.C. The identities of his murderers are still 
unknown, although the Chilean Intellige ce Service (DINA), its Cuban counterpart (DINA), and 
anti-Castro Cuban exiles have all been ccused. 
At the time of his death, he was dire or of Transnational Institute which is a subsidiary of the Insti-
tute for Policy Studies (IPS) which iVbased in Washington, D.C., and which is an influential radical 
think-tank. 
A briefcase containing confident I papers was discovered with the body of Letelier. Letters from 
Allende's daughter "Tate", who 4s married to a senior officer of the Cuban Intelligence Agency (DGI) 
and who lives in Havana reveale that Letelier was receiving a regular salary of $1,000 per month 
from Havana, Cuba. 
These documents also revealed that he had built up an impressive range of contacts among congressional 
staffs and well-known liberals in the U.S.A. and that he maintained close contacts with staff members 
of the Church Committee on American Intelligence activities. 
4(944AU '-
Congressman Michael Harrington, who championed the Kennedy Amendment, which cut off arm supplies 
to Chile, in the House of Representatives, received money from Letelier for a trip to Mexico. 
[ 
S. Gorshov, one of the leading naval men of the Soviet, writes: "Under many circumstances it is
not necessaryto resort to military strength. All that is necessary is to put pressure to bear on the 
other side with the strength of one's military power and by the threat of war, and one will achieve 
one's political oloiective," (Ta Kung Pao, February 10, 1977)

THE PURPOSE OF SOVIET SEA POWER 
Approved For Release 2004/11/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000200360001-6 
NUCLEAR POWER IN THE SOVIET UNION 
The Russians are proceeding rapidly with the development of Nuclear Power. They decide, then act 
without encumbrance by protesting demonstrators. This contrasts with the situation in the free world 
where there are protests and demonstrations whenever and wherever building a Nuclear Power Station 
is proposed. In non-communist countries, these protests are often supported by the communists. This 
is consistent with their program to weaken the free world economically, militarily, and morally so 
that communist conquest will be easier. 
The Russian attitude to Nuclear Power is revealed in this statement by the Chairman of the USSR 
Atomic Energy Committee: (ATLAS, April, 1977) 
All Clear in the U.S.S.R. 
Our tenth Five-Year Plan sets a priority rate of development for the atomic 
power industry in the European part of the U.S.S.R., the most densely 
populated section of the country. Nuclear reactors are in operation or 
under construction in the Leningrad, Kursk, Smolensk, Sverdlovsk, and Kalinin 
regions, near Kiev in the Ukraine, in Armenia, and elsewhere. 
Strict sanitary regulations are laid down and enforced by the Ministry of 
Health. They are obligatory and cover also the location and operation of nuclear 
installations. Each operating reactor is provided with virtually unfailing (because 
of a three or four-tier system of checks and double-checks) safeguards against 
accidents that ensure automatic instantaneous cooling if the temperature 
suddenly reaches a critical point. Of course no serious scientist rules out the 
probability of the improbable. It is all a matter of the degree of risk. 
Not long ago the U.S. nuclear regulatory commission estimated on the basis 
of data collected at 100 operating nuclear power stations that the "likely" 
disaster rate was once in a million years. At this rate one might as well scare the 
public with the danger of the Empire State Building collapsing. The same applies 
to the talk about the radiation danger to the population in general. To raise this 
scare is as absurd as it is unscientific. If it comes to that, sugar or salt could kill 
any living organism it introduced in inordinate quantities. Air can kill if a bubble of 
it gets into the circulatory system. We live in the midst of constant dangers but 
have learned how to guard against them. Controlled peaceful use of atomic 
energy within scientifically set limits involves no danger from radiation. 
As to the problem of the radioactive waste, the greater part can be relatively 
simply coped with since the degree of its radioactivity is not high and does not 
present a very great danger; it disintegrates rapidly in specially designed tanks 
under water. There is, however, a certain proportion of highly radioactive waste 
that has to be stored away hermetically for years, in, say, abandoned salt mines. 
Experts are now concentrating on the creation of new types of reactors with a 
low yield of radioactive waste. 
Optimism should not be taken to mean that I underestimate the potential 
danger of the nuclear destruction of our civilization. But that is another problem. 
The world has reached the state when atomic energy has ceased to be a great 
and fascinating scientific and technological novelty and has become a vital 
necessity. The march of progress cannot be halted. ? 
---Andranik Petrosyants, Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Atomic Energy 
Commiltee, in an interview with Elena Knorre, staff writer 
for the weekly "New Times" of Moscow, Jan. 3.

Worldwide Effort 
Being Launched to 
'Destabilize' CIA 
By George Lardner Jr. 
?, Washington Post Stmff Writer 
Perched just. below-Dupont Circle is the appar-
ently temporary headquarters of a new interna-
tional campaigneto"destabWee the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. ' ?:?.; 
The anti-CIA announcements are being made in 
Havana, but the vehicle is a magazine being put to-
"gether by former.-CIA, officer-Philip Agee, "the 
agency's No. 1 nemesis," and a number of colleagues 
bent on - "exposing CIA personnel and operations 
whenever and wherever we find them." 
? The new publication, which is expected to appear 
'roughly six times a year, is called the Covert -Ac-
;tion Information Bulletirsi, arid its tone is uncompro- ; 
mising. Urging a worldwide effort to print the name 1 
of anyone who works abroad for the CIA, Agee ad-
vises readers Of the premier issue not to stop there. 
? Once the names have- been- madee-publie, he 
recommends: 
"Then organize public demonstrations against 
-those named?both at the American embassy and at 
'their homes?and, where possible, bring pressure on 
'the government to throw them out. Peaceful protest 
will do the job. And when it doesn't, those whom 
the CIA has most oppressed will find other ways of 
fighting back." 
Agee concludes: "We can all aid this struggle, to-
gether with the struggle-for socialism in the United 
States itself." - 
"This thing is incredible ... unbellevable,"- ex-
claimed CLk?spokesman Herbert Hetu. "The motiva-
Iion of 'these people has got to-be more than that 
they're just ticked off at the CIA. 
"This goes beyond whistle-blowing," Hetu added 
_Of the magazine. "Whistle-blowing' is supposed to be 
directed at wrongdoing. These people are operating 
under the overall pretext that everything we do is 
wrong.". , 
Expelled from Britain and a. succession of other! 
Western -European countries over the .past two-
years, Agee is reportedly living in. Rome, but the I 
'magazine is being published hereby.C. I. Publica-
tions Inc., a nonprofit corporation setup. in the 
District on Dec. 22. 
Its incorporators, directors and officers are Wil-
liam H. Schaap, a lawyer and editor in chief of a 
newsletter called the Military Law' Reporter; Ellen 
Pay, a colleague of Schaap on various boards and 
projects; and Louis Wolf, coeditor with Agee of a 
new book entitled "Dirty Work: The CIA in West-
:ern Europe." 
It is designed partly as a how-to-do-it book aimed 
at "breaking the 'cover' of thousands of CIA. agents 
around the world.'  
The headquarters of C. I. Publications Inc. ' is 
given in the incorporation papers as. a sixth-floor ; 
suite in the Dupont Circle Building at 1346 Connect-
icut Ave. NW, which houses the Public Law Educa-
tion Institute. 
The institute's president, Thomas P. Alder, told a 
reporter yesterday he had not been aware of 
Schaap's use of the address for his "sideshow" meg-
'azine and indicated he would gut a stop to it. The 
institute publishes the ?Military Law Reporter 
Schaal) edits. ? 
. The financing for the new undertaking was un-
clear. Alder said Schaap, Agee and . all the others 
who could answer such questions were still in Ha-
vana, where they have been taking part in an anti. 
CIA tribunal that began last week as part o.f the In-
ternational Youth Festival. 
In announcing the plans there, Agee-and Schaap 
have said they hope to establish a worldwide net-
work of "researchers" who will keep CU officers 
under close scrutiny and forward their names to the 
Covert Action Informatiqn Bulletin lei. publication. 
_Others associated with Agee in the so-called "CIA 
Watch" are James and Elsie Wilcott, former CIA fi-
nance and support personnel who are also taking 
part in the Havana festival, 
? In a joint statement in the first (July 19'7'8) Issue' 
-of Covert Action entitled "Who We Are." Agee and? ; 
the others describe the magazine as a successor to 
Counter-Spy, which went out of business a year 
.and a half ago. 
Counter-Spy folded after a welter of controversy : 
? over the 1975 assassination in Athens of CIA station 
chief Richard S. Welch. The magazine had earlier 
listed Welch's name as a CIA official stationed. in 
Peru. 
Unlike Counter-Spy, Agee and the others said in 
the first issue of Covert Action, "We are confident 
that there will be sufficient subscribers to make this 
publication a permanent weapon in the fight against, 
the CIA, the FBI military intelligence- and all the 
other instruments of U.S. imperialist oppression 
throughout the world." - ? 
. . 
According to John H. Rees, editor of a cOnserva.

Why Crinudighter is the best protection against... 
burglary. 
The crime rate of residential 
burglary has increased 334 percent in 
the last 10 years. Can you think of 
people you know (perhaps yourself!) 
who have been touched by theft or 
other crime? Hardly anyone in the 
country has not been affected in 
some way by the brutal statistics. 
Nite & Day's Crimefighter provides 
the very best protection against 
burglary in a home or small 
business. Its protection is superior 
to that of guns, dogs, and most other 
electronic systems. Dollar for dollar, 
Crimefighter is unsurpassed by 
any system. 
DAYTIME BURGLARIES 
Most break-ins occur between the 
hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. in broad 
daylight! As well as providing superior 
nighttime protection, the Crimefighter 
system is convenient to use as a 
virtually absolute deterrent to daytime 
burglaries. 
BETTER PROTECTION THAN 
LOCKS 
Of course it's a good idea to lock your 
Crimefighter 
BUSINESS RE Y 
No oostage necessary ,f 
doors and windows. But remember?
it's easy to overlook a latch or two. 
Besides, locked doors and windows 
don't do much to slow down a deter-
mined intruder. The Crimefighter 
system is simple and foolproof to arm, 
and it works whether doors and 
windows are locked or not. 
BErIla PROTECTION THAN 
GUNS 
Most burglars carry guns of their own. 
It is far better to scare an intruder 
away with an alarm?or quietly and 
electronically summon the police?
than to endanger yourself and your 
family in a shoot-out. 
BETTER PROTECTION THAN 
DOGS 
Dogs provide limited protection, 
particularly in an empty house. They 
are easily subdued by chemical means, 
and barks and yelps are too common 
a sound to attract much attention. 
THE DEADLIEST HOURS 
Fatal fires most often occur between 
the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. 
Hot, silent toxic gases rise, fill 
bedrooms, and asphyxiate sleeping 
families. Once combustion has begun, 
only early detection gives a family a 
fighting chance, particularly in the 
middle of the night. 
Nite & Day's Crimefighter gas and 
heat detectors and electronic alarm 
wakes sound sleepers in time for 
escape. 
THE TOLL IN CHILDREN 
Each year more children under 14 die 
by fire than from the combined effecti 
of rheumatic fever, leukemia, heart 
disease, and polio! A primary reason: 
Parents don't find out about fire in 
the home in time to get everybody to 
safety. Smoke and heat detectors can 
provide the much needed timely 
warning. 
MOST FIRES START SLOWLY. . . 
A fire can smolder for hours?or days 
before producing visible smoke or 
flames. This is the time to detect the 
fire; this is the time your heat and 
smoke detector system lets you know 
a fire is under way. 
... AND GET OUT OF CONTROL 
QUICKLY 
Once flames break out, your house 
acts as a giant furnace. From the 
point of conglagration, a fire can rage 
out of control within 4 to 7 minutes 
consuming everything inside your 
home. 
BUT FLAMES AREN'T THE BIG 
KILLER 
Fires produce hot, deadly gases. These 
gases, including hydrogen cyanide and 
carbon monoxide, cause the greatest 
number of fire fatalities. Your 
Crimefighter can warn you of 
combustion and its gases early enough 
to prevent asphyxiation.

Stop a burglary before 
it happens. 
The purpose of an alarm system is to 
stop an intruder and/or to apprehend 
him. To accomplish either of these 
objectives, a response must come in the 
shortest possible time. With the 
Crimefighter, the intruder is detected 
before he enters. 
SENSORS

Find out about a fire in 
time to escape. 
If you don't learn of a fire in its very 
first stages, you may not have time to 
get your family to safety. After flames 
break out, your home can be an inferno 
in 4 to 7 minutes! With the early 
detection and warning features of the 
Crimefighter, your chances of escape 
are excellent.

How the Crimefighter system works. 
RESCUE SQUAD, HOSPITAL 
or AMBULANCE SERVICE 
A system as quiet-or noisy-
as you want it to be. 
For extra safety, the alarm system can be 
audible or silent. It can send a silent 
signal to the police if your primary 
objective is to apprehend an intruder. If 
personal safety is first consideration, you 
can use our incredibly loud audible 
alarms which have the dual function of 
severely startling an intruder and drawing 
considerable attention to the site of the 
break-in. 
The silent alarm utilizes an automatic 
telephone dialer which summons the 
police, the fire department, or an 
ambulance through your own telephone 
system. It can warn or inform anybody 
who can be reached by telephone. 
It's economical and versatile. 
The Nite & Day Crimefighter system is 
flexible. You can add security options 
easily and economically. You can take 
the system with you when you move. 
And this sophisticated equipment can 
be yours for pennies a day. 
A WIRELESS 
SYSTEM?
The Crimefighter 
operates on radio 
impulse. That 
means no wires to 
spoil the decor of 
your home, and no 
wires for a burglar 
to cut to deactivate 
the system. 
The Nite & Day 
system is the only 
radio frequency 
home alarm system 
meeting all 
industry standards 
to receive UL 
approval. 
This is the little

Home Improvement 
It Gives An 
Earlier Warning 
TATISTICS gathered by 
various governmental 
agencies and profes-
sional safety organiza-
tions indicate that the inci-
dence of home fires has been 
increasing steadily in recent 
years, with the greatest num-
ber occurring between mid-
night and 6 A.M. ? when 
most people are asleep and 
consequently when there is 
the greatest danger to the 
occupants of the house. 
It is actually not hard to 
understand these statistics 
since fires spread very rapid-
ly once they get started, and 
sleeping persons often do 
not awaken in time to es-
cape. In many cases they are 
overcome by smoke, nox-
ious gases or superheated air 
while they are still asleep, 
and betore the actual flames 
ever get to them. To give 
some idea of how rapidly 
this can happen, studies 
have shown that from the 
time flames actually break 
out, a person has; on the 
average, less than tour min-
utes in which to escape be-
fore he will be overcome by  
toxic gases or superheated 
air. 
As more and more home 
owners have become aware 
of these dangers there has 
been a steadily growing trend 
toward the installation of 
alarm systems that will wake 
sleeping occupants when fire 
breaks out at night so as to 
give them the precious extra 
minutes needed to escape. 
The most widely used 
kind of home fire detector is 
a heat sensor or special ther-
mostat that sounds a central 
alarm bell or horn when the 
temperature in the vicinity 
of the detector reaches a pre-
determined level ? usually 
about 1 35 degrees. The 
trouble with this type of de-
tector is that it loses valuable 
minutes before it gets hot 
enough to sound the alarm. 
By the time the element 
reaches the critical tempera-
ture the air in the room is 
already much hotter than 
this, and about one-third of 
the critical four-minute-
leeway (time to escape) may 
be gone. In addition, some 
fires give off lots of smoke 
without much heat. 
The second most widely 
used alarm is the smoke de-
tector. This uses a photocell 
that sounds the alarm when a 
percentage of the light pass-
ing through a special closed 
chamber is obstructed by a 
smoke buildup. It gives an 
earlier warning than the heat 
sensor, but it may be set off 
by insects and may not give 
adequate warning when the 
fire produces very little 
smoke at the beginning. 
Though either one or both 
of these systems will give ad-
vance warning of fire, the 
drawback with both of them 
is that all too often they do 
not sound the alarm early 
enough, especially during a 
FIRE STAGES ? During Incipient stage fire shows 
no visible smoke r flames. During Smoldering stage

fire's so-called incipient stage 
when it can smolder for 
many minutes ? or even 
hours in some cases ? with-
out visible smoke or flames. 
However, there is one type 
of fire detector that will 
sound the alarm while the 
fire is still in the incipient 
state ? it detects the invisible 
gases and microscopic air-
borne particles  that areliven, 
off at the very beginning. 
Known as a? combustion 
products detector or ioniza-
tion chamber detector, this 
type has been largely pro-
duced only for commercial 
establishments up till now. 
However, one company is 
now producing an early 
warning combustion prod-
ucts detector for the home 
which is  completely self-con-

installed by anyone withal

need for wiring. Called the 
1:IKK Early Warning ire De-
tector it is manufactured by 
Mr" Electronics. Inc. of 
Aurora, Ill. 
As with most fire detec-
tors, the BRK unit is design-
ed to be installed on the 
ceiling (two screws hold it in 
place) and for most homes 
two units will be needed. 
Measuring about seven 
inches square, the detector 
has its own battery power 
supply, and is the only self-
contained unit of this type to 
be approved by the Under-
writers' Laboratories, 
Inc.... 
*It operates on an indus-
trial grade battery that sig-
nals when it is weakening, 
but even a weak battery will 
continue to sound an alarm 
in case of fire, the maker 
says. 
*The sensing element is an 
ion chamber in a circuit that 
monitors the current across 
the chamber. When combus-
tion product particles, which 
are larger than normal air 
molecules, enter the cham-
ber they cause a change in 
voltage and send a signal to 
the amplifier sounding a 110 
decibel alarm. It can be turn-
ed off and also tested at 
intervals with a reset switch. 
A manual supplied with 
each of these BRK Early 
Warning Detectors gives in-
structions on selecting the 
best locations ? but as a rule 
it is advisable to install one at 
the top of each stairwell in 
the hall leading to the bed-
rooms.

LOCATION OF DETECTORS 
It is very important that you locate 
these BRK Detectors where they will 
be able to detect fire at its earliest 
possible state to give you the earliest 
possible warning. 
The products of combustion from 
fire rise to the ceiling and rapidly 
spread across it. Therefore always 
mount the Detectors on the ceiling 
? Between the bedroom area and 
the rest of the house, 
? On any level (like a basement) 
separated from the rest cif the 
house by a closed door. 
? At the top of stairwells. 
If smoking is done inside a bedroom, 
either the door should remain opened 
or a Detector should be placed directly 
inside the room.

ALL BIG FIRES START SMALL 
In virtually every case except explosions, a fire starts 
small and spends many times longer in the first two 
stages than in the last two. It is a matter of record that 
the Incipient and Smoldering Stages can exist for hours 
or even days BEFORE the Flame and Heat Stages are 
reached. Once Flame and Heat are present a fire can 
develop at a catastrophic rate. 
4 Heat Stage: High heat, uncon-
trolled and air that is rapidly 
expanding join here to make a 
dangerous combination that de-
stroys property, claims lives and 
creates tragedies.

10% VISIBLE 
In most fires 90% of the products of combustion are 
invisible. Only 10% are in the visible (smoke) form. 
EARLY DETECTION SAVES LIVES 
Most of the fire detection systems in use today are de-
pendent upon the Heat Stage to trigger any alarm. This 
is too late in many cases to save lives and extensive 
property damage.
