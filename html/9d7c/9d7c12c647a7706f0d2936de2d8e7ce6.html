 CURREi~T CHIIiL'SL?' SCIENCE
 ~omment:  This report presents a Soviet article describing the
 visit of Chinese scientists to the USSR, and four articles by well-
 known Chinese scientists on the current position of the physical,
 geological, mathematical, and chemical sciences in China.
 An index of the Chinese scientists mentioned in this report is
 appended
 Vestnik Akademii Nauk SSSR, No 6, 1953, Pages 50-53
 At the invitation of the Acndemy of Sciences USSR, a large group of Chinese
 scientists, hended by Prof Chien San- n'ia:ig, director oT the Institute of
 Modern Physics of the Acade:aia Sinica, visited the Soviet Union.  The group in-
 cluded noted scientists whose works are well known to Soviet scientists and
 representatives of the younger generation of scientific workers who have com-
 pleted their education under the people's government.
 The scientists in the delegation represented various fields of science:
 physics, mathematics, geophysics, botnny, physiology, electrical engineering, "
 architecture, history, geology, etc.  All are united in their effort to raise
 the level of science in China,. so that the practical problems of economic and
 cultural life in the new China may be solved.

 The purpose of the visit of the Chinese scientists was to familiarize them-
 with the activity of the Academy of Sciences USSR and its institutes, and of
 other scienti.~'ic research institutions of the Soviet Union.
 Guided by the appeal of Mao Tse-tong to master the theory of N,arxism-
 Leninism and to study the progressive experience of Soviet science and tech-
 nology, the Chinese scientists took a lively interest in the scientific and
 cultural life of the USSR during their 3-month stay.  In Moscow and Leningrad
 alone, they visited about 100 scientific establishments of the Academy of
 Sciences USSR and of various ministries and departments, including the Academy
 of Medial Sciences USSR, the All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences imeni
 V. I. Lenin, the Academy of Architecture USSR, the Agricultural Academy imeni
 K. A. Timiryazev, the Academy of Social Sciences under the Central Committee of
 the CPSU, the Ministry of Culture USSR, the Ministry of Health USSR, and a num-
 ber of universities and institutes.
 During their visits to scientific institutions, the Chinese scientists be-
 came familiar with the basic aims of Soviet scientific research work, the organ-
 izational structure and planning of work in these institutions, and the problems
 of training scientific personnel and raising their ideological level.
 In addition, discussions of scientific and orgn::izational problems were
 arranged for the Chinese scientists in the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences
 USSR.  The guests became thoroughly familiar with the structure of the presidium,
 the work of the Council for the Study of Productive Forces, the publishing
 houses, the system of training scientists in postgraduate courses, and other
 phases of the ncademy'swork.  These studies may have great importance for the
 organization of scientific research and the successful development of science in
 China.
 In the course of these discussions, which sometimes lasted several hours,
 the Chinese scientists asked all kinds: of questions, showing an interest in every
 phase of activity of the academy.  They were especially interested in the coordi-
 nation of scientific research work with the requirements of industry and agri-
 culture, the. effect of the decisions  of the 19th Congress of the CPSU on plans
 for scientific research by the Academy of Sciences USSR, the procedure for pre-
 paring the academy's 5-year and annual plans, the organization and conduct of
 scientific discussions, and methods of raising the ideological and political
 level of scientific workers.  The questions asked were proof of the lively in-
 terest of the Chinese in the organization of scientific research in the Soviet
 Union and also of their desire to establish a closer connection between science
 and the practical demands of construction and development now taking place in
 sll branches of the national economy of China.
 The most noted scientists of the USSR took part in the discussions with the
 Chinese scientists.  The included Academician A. PI. Ptesmeyanov, President of the
 Academy of Sciences USSR; Academicians I. P. Bardin and V. P. Volgin, vice-presl=
 dents; Academician A. V. Topchiyev, chief scientific secretary of the presidium]
 Academician N. N. Anichkov, President of the Academy of hiedical Sciences USSR;
 Academician T. D. Lysenko, President of the All-Union Academy of Agricultural Scianes
 imeni V. I. Lenin; Academician A. V. Palladia, President oi' the Academy of
 Sciences Ukrainian SSR; T. Z. Zakhidov, President of the Academy of Sciences
 Uzbek SSR; the scientific secretaries of departments of the Academy of Sciences
 USSR; scientific secretaries of the Presidium of the Acadetay of Sciences USSR;
 and directors and scientific associates of institutes.                   '

 Soviet scientists enumerated Soviet achievements in various fields of
 science and technology, and told of the close cooperation between workers of
 science and industry, the introduction of the results of scientific research
 in the practical work of the nation's economy, and the organization of control
 over the fulfillment of scientific research work.
 To give the Chinese scientists Puller acquaintance with the activity of
 the academy, individual members of the delegation were invited to attend meetings
 for the defense of dissertations on sub,~ects of possible interest to them, and
 conferences of the Scientific Secretariat and the Presidium of the Academy of
 Sciences USSR.  At one of these conferences, the delegates heard a report by
 A. P. Vinogradov, Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences USSR, on the
 work of the Institute of Geochemistry imeni V. Z. Vernadsk'_y, and a report by
 A. A. Mikhaylov, Corresponding btember of the Academy of Sciences USSR, on the
 construction of the Pulkovo Observatory.
 At a meeting of the presidium of the academy, the guests heard a report by
 S. P. Tolstov, Doctor of Historical Sciences, head of the Khorezm Archeological,
 Expedition, and other reports on a number of general organizational problems.
 At their request, the delegates were given an opportunity to study the
 development of science and culture in the union republics.  During their
 10-day stay in the Ukrainian SSR and the Uzbek SSR, they visited not only the
 Academies of Sciences and many scientific establishments, but also plants,
 factories, mines, kolkhozes, and sovkhozes.  They were able to observe hox the
 acievements of science were practically applied in industry and agriculture.
 'she Chinese scientists published articles in Soviet newspapers and periodicals,
 ant gave radio talks about their impressions of the cooperation between science
 and production and of the utilization of the results of hlichurin biology in
 agriculture.  Much interest was shown by the delegates during their ?risit to
 Stalino, where they inspected a coal mine and witnessed improved methods of
 coal mining and the cperntion of a coal-mining combine.
 After the return of the delegation to China, the President of the Academy
 of Sciences USSR received a telegram from Peiping in which Li Ssu-kuang, Vice-
 President of the Academia Sinica, expressed his thanks for the friendly re-
 ception and assistance which had been given.  The telegram stated that, during
 its stay in the USSR, the delegation had gained much valuable knowledge, which
 would not only further the development of science in China, but also strengthen
 the friendship between the two Academies of Sciences.

 The development of modern physics in China, as of other natural sciences,
 was begun by scientists who had received their education In capitalist countries.
 Ths history of modern physics in Chinn dates back slightly over 30 years;
 departments of physics were established in higher educational institutions only
 after 1914, and scientific research work has gradually developed since 1926.

 In the Tsinghua University, research was done under the supervision of
 Yeh Ch'i-sun and Wu Yu-hsun on X rays, electronics, and nuclear and theoretical
 physics.  4+. "king University, experime~ital and theoretical work on spectro-
 graphy woo   _od by Yao Yui-t'ai.At'the Institute of Physics of Peking
 University, Yen Ch'1-tz'u was in charge of research on spectrography, piezo-
 electric crystals, applied optics, radiochemistry, and crystallography.  At the
 Institute of Physics of the Central Academy, Ting Hsi-lip supervised research
 work on radiotechnolagy, magnetism, geomagnetic measurements, and the ma~i-
 facture of instruments for physical research.
 In the universities (e.g., Chekiang University), attention was also given
 to the development of physical research.
 Under the former ece~omic and political conditions, physics, like other
 sciences in China, was slow in developing.  The reactionaries were not inter-
 ested in the developme.*.t of scientific research, and universities and scientific
 research institutes received no serious support from the government.  Therefore,
 physicists had to make tremendous efforts to overcome all kinds of difficulties.
 For example, the only printed publication on physical problems, the Journal of
 Chinese Physics, was unable to nppear regularly because of constant financial
 difficulties.
 During the 1930s and 1940s,when tiie Japanese imperi:~ists attacked China,
 they destroyed a large part of the equipment necessary for research, making
 it impossible to continue.   esearch physicists saved s small amount of in-
 struments and literature and moved to the distant southwest and northwest parts
 of China, establishing primitive laboratories.  After the expulsion of the
 aggressors, the scientists returned to Peiping, Nanking, Shanghai, and other
 large cities.  The position of science did not improve, however, until the
 establishment of the people's government.
 According to incomplete data for the 30 years preceding the victory of the
 Chinese people, scientists published a total of about 1,400 articles on the
 various branches of physics.  Works in the fields of atomic and molecular
 physics began to be published after 1914 and over ].00 articles dealt with
 problems in these fields.  Among the first of these works is the research of
 Li Yao-pang on the measurement of the electric charge of electrons, Au Kang-fu
 on the measurement of the maximum speed of photoelectrons originating from
 % rays, Yeh Ch'i-sun on the measurement of the Planck constant, Wu Yu-hsun on
 the study of the dispersion of X rays in gases, and others.  The last work
 deserves special attention, for the results of the study on the distribution of
 intensity of the shifted and unshifted lines in the Compton effect were of great
 importance for the determination of this effect.
 About 250 articles dealt with problems of nuclear physics and research on
 cosmic rays.  The first work in these fields appeared about 1930.  The most
 important studies were those on gamma rays by Ch'so Chung-yao, who was the
 first to discover the anomalous line of radiation of the atomic nucleus and to
 determine its wave length.  This is the special radiation which we now know
 occurs in the conversion of a pair of electrons into a photon.  Wang Kan-ch'ang
 suggested a method of detecting a neutrino.  Chien San-cli'iang made a study of
 gamma rays and their intensity in the region of low energies.
 The mast important work in the field of nuclear ructions was that done by
 Chien San-ch'iang and Ho Tse-hui.  These scientists were tF~ first to discover
 the phenomenon of fission of the uranium nucleus into three oY four parts, and
 they gave a basic explanation for the phenomenon of fission into three fragments.
 The research of Chang Wen-yu on the disintegration of light nuclei and oP Chao
 Chung-yao on the nuclear reactions of fluorine made it possible to measure

 ?     certain energy levels of light nuclei,  In his study of cosmic rays, Chang
 Wen-yu did research on gamma rays originating from mu-mesons in lead and iron,
 and Wang Kan-ch'ang studied the energy spectrum of electrons, resulting from
 the decay of mu-mesons.
 The first studies on theoretical physics (of xhich about 200 have been
 published) appeared about 1926.  To be noted among these studies are those of
 Wang Ch'u-hsi and Chang Ts'ung-su, who applied the meth;,ds of statistical
 mechanics to their research on crystalline alloys.  After 1y4O, the number of
 research studies on quantum mechanics increased, especially on the theory of
 the meson field.  Peng Huan-wu, using the theory of attenuation, explained
 certain phenomena occurring in cosm'c rays; this explanation, in turn, made
 it possible to examine certain problems in connection with the hard component
 of cosmic rays.  Ma Hsi-ts'un studied the dispersion of mesons, and Hu Ning,
 using the meson theory, obtained relativistic corrections for nuclear forces.
 Peng Auan-wu also introduced a new field theory and Chang Ts'ung-su made a
 number of research studies on the quantum field.
 In 1928, articles on problems of spectroscopy and optics began to be
 published; about 300 have been devoted to discussing research in these fields.
 Yen Ch'1-tz'u and other physicists made systematic studies of the resolution
 and shift of spectrum lines in nn electric field, as well as of the widening,
 shift, and asymmetry of atomic spectra of alkali metals,
 Systematic research on molecular spectra was carried out by 13o Yui-t'ai,
 Wu Ta-yu, Ch'eng Hua-ch'i, and others on Raman spectra (spectra of combined
 scattering) and by Wu Hsueh-chou and Lu Ta-kang on absorption spectra.  Wu
 Ta-yu did extensive research, both experimental and theoretical, on the
 oscillatory spectra of polyatomic molecules; This research was generalized in
 his book _Oscillatory Spectra and Structure of Pol atomic Molecules.  Ch'eng
 Mai-inn  conducted a number of studies, using spectroscopy to examine
 astrophysical and atmospheric phenomena.
 In the field of applied optics, the most attention was devoted to the
 manufacture of glass.  Wang Ta-heng carried out systematic spectrophotometric
 research on the effects of iron, uranium, and antimony in sodium glass.
 About 170 published works concern the physics of solids, the first being
 published about 1926.  Special mention should be made of the systematic re-
 search of Ko T'ing-su with regard to the phenomenon of internal friction in
 metals.  The viscosity of metal granules was proved with the help of this re-
 search, making it possible to explain many dynamic properties of metals.
 Chien Lin-chao worked on the solution of problems of the sliding of metallic
 b uly-centered single-crystals and Shih Ju-wei studied the magnetic properties
 of alloys and compounds.  In examining the structure of crystals, Yu Jui-
 huang developed a new complex method of X-ray analysis.  In the field of in-
 strument building, mention should be made of the work of Tsai Po-ling, xho
 made computations for the production of large electromagnets and natural
 permanent magnets.  In the field of the theory of solids, the work of Huang
 K'un, on the theory of the R-center and the ionic lattice, deserves special
 interest.  Auang K'un has recently turned to an examination of the theory of
 crystals.
 Of 180 works on electronics and electromagnetism, the systematic ob-
 servations of piezocrystals by Yen Ch'i-tzu and Chien Lin-chno, as well as the
 work of Min Nat-ta on the study of electrical distribution circuits, deserve
 attention.

 ^         Researdi in the field of mechanics developed only after 1935?  Hrsic
 contributions have been msde to aerodynamics and the mechanics of elastic
 bodies.
 Research on the theory of turbulence has been done under the supervision
 of Chou P'ei-yuan, who has also solved the problem of velocity correlation and
 has obtained basic results in the solution of several practical questions.
 Chien Sui-sen has studi~~l the theory of the similarity of fields with subsonic
 speeds; the results of his research have practical importance in the solution
 of problems concerning airplane wings.  Lin Chia-ch'ao achieved positive re-
 sults in his research on the stability of laminar flow and thus put an end to
 arguments which had been going on for several decades.
 In the field of the mechanics of elastic bodies, mention should be made
 first of the work of Chien Sui-seng on the nonlinear theory of stability of
 thin membranes, which resulted in the creation of a new field in stability
 problems.  The generalizing studies of Chien We:-ch'ang on the theory of thin
 plates and shells unified this theory and showed a new direction for the so-
 lution of problems in the field of mechanics of nonlinear elastic bodies, i.e.,
 the problem of terminal deflections.  The first studies on the principles of
 the theory of solids were completed by Lu Ho-fu.
 It is evident from the above that the basis of physical research in China
 is very weak, the history of physics is comparatively short, its development
 has been irregular, and the number of works is small.
 Because China was For a long period a beckward, semicolonial country, most
 of her scientists studied in the capitalist countries of Europe and America.
 These scientists pursued the study of "international physical problems" and
 their work was therefore alien to the life of the people.  The reactionary
 rulers of Chinn neglected scientific research work:  not only was there a lack
 of the most essential equipment and materials, but the lives of scientific
 workers were constantly in danger.  Physical research was done in a haphazard
 fashion, without any plan or purpose, by individuals whe rarely cooperated and
 never planned a distribution of work.  The results of this can be felt even now,
 for there is still c tendency to give preference to theoretical rather than
 experimental work and to prefer experimental wort; to research with a practical
 purpose.  It should also be noted that there are still comparatively few complex
 and large instruments in China.  Those branches of science closely related to
 the life of the people, such as radio and hydrodynamics, are poorly developed.
 Zn theoretical fields, idealistic influences have been insufficiently overcome.
 With the establishment of the people's government, physics in China began
 u new stage of development, and more attention was given to science.  An
 Institute of Modern Physics end an Institute of Applied Physics have been or-
 ganized under the Academia Sinica.  Obstacles to the development of physical
 research, such as insufficient funds or indifference to the needs of science,
 have been eliminated, but the rate of economic con,truction is still consider-
 ably higher than the development of physical science.
 Because of the extreme weakness of the experimental base for physical re-
 search, especially during the initial period when the physics institutes were
 being created, it was necessary to concentrate on the fulfillment of the most
 it~portant experimental work.  Even here, hocaever, the results obtained are still
 very limited.

 The orork of the Institute cf hindcrn Physics includes the following fields:
 theoretical physics, nuc]oar nhvsics, cosmic rays, and radiochemistry.  The re-
 search on r rclear physics is basic. During the last 3 ,years, preparations for
 exnerimer,tal work have been rande.  A nwnt,er of research studies on theoretical
 physics have been made, concerning the ability of light nuclei to fuse.  The
 study of the forces of interaction among nuclei has begun.
 The basic task of the Institute of Applied Physics is the study of the
 structure and properties of matter and its change under different conditions,
 with a view to npnlyin,? the results obtained to production technology.  pt
 present, research i:,concentr~ted on the physics of solids.  In addition to the
 continuing work on crystallography, magnetism, optics etc., research has been
 begun on semiconductors and low temperatures.
 The Academia Sinica has founded an instrw.;ent-building r,orkshop, the main
 task of which will be the planning and manufacturing of optical instruments
 and other precision instnunents required by industry.  At the same time,
 preparations are being made for the organization of an institute of economics.
 Physical research, which in the past began in various higher educational
 establishments, xill be developed extensively in the future.  Higher educational
 establishments are now reorganizing their system of instruction, studying Soviet
 methods and curriculums, and improving the old methods.  Plans have been made
 to organize research departments in higher educational establishments.
 A number of social reorganizations, carried out under the leadership of
 the Chinese Comr,,unist Party in the past 3 years, have been especially concerned
 with the ideological re-education of scientists, and have created a sound
 ideological basis for future work in the field of physics.
 We hope that the aid and authoritative instruction of Soviet scientists
 will further the speedy and extensive development of Chinese science according
 to the pattern of Soviet science, so that research may be closely integrated
 caith the needs of the state and with the struggle for strengthening the forces
 of peace.

 Tho first geological organization in China was formed in 1911, when the
 temporary government in Nanking created a department of geology in the Bureau
 of Ffining of the Ministry of Industry.  A short-teen school was opened under
 the direction of the geologist Chang Hung-,jao and a srnll~nwnber of geologists
 were trained in this school.  In 1916, the Chinese Geological Service was es-
 tablished and geological research began; the Institute of Geology was founded
 in 1928.
 During the  jnti-~ Japanese war, the Bureau of Psozpecting and Surveying
 of Useful Minerals was organized.  During the period 1927-194'7, local estab-
 lishments for geological research and prospecting were organized, one after the
 other, in the provinces of Honan, Hunan, Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Kweichow, Szechwan,
 ?ukien, Yunnan, Sinkiang, and Chekiang, and in northeast and northwest China.
 With the help of these establishments, studies on stratigraphy, paleontology,
 geological structure, and deposits oi' useful minerals were carried out.  The
 results of the work xere published in geological monographs, books, and
 periodical articles.

 In the old Chinn, geological research and the study of useful minerals
 served only the interest of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and the
 Chinese people did not understand its value.  It was natural that, under such
 conditions, Chinese geologists ^,hould be concerned mainly with purely theo-
 retical research, especially with problems of stratigraphy and paleontology.
 The works of Soviet paleontologists helped Chinese scientists to define more
 accurately the stratlgraphic subdivisions of different strata.  For example,
 the fossi]s found in 1925 by Prof Li Ssu-kuang, under the supervision of
 i    :I. A. Bolkhovitnova,.in the region of the Podol'sk quarry, assisted
 Chinese geologists in solving the problem of the biiddle Carboniferous period.
 As n result, geologists also solved the long-disputed problem concerning the
 period of formation cf the T'ai-yuan strata and the Maning ~iot further idE?n-
 tified1 limestones.
 Betcreen 1929 and 1935, Chinese geologists carried out research on a
 nation-wide scale.  Basic work was done in the provinces of Shensi, Szechxan,
 Suiyuan, Yunnan, Kweichow, Sikang, Kansu, Jehol, Hupeh, Hunan, Kiangsi,
 Kwangtung, and Kwangsi.  Detailed, systematic research was carried out in the
 region of the king-cheer. range near Plankin^.  In 1929, Pei Pan-cheng found the
 remains of Sinanthropus Pekinensis and stone tools of pccdution inCh'ou-K' ou-tien,
 one, of the worlds richest sources of traces of prehistoric man.  The study of
 materials found there has contributed greatly to the science of anthropology.
 In the field of paleontology and stratigraphy, the research of Yang Chung-
 chlen on fossil rodents in northern China, as xell as on fossil vertebrates
 and tertiary deposits, should be mentioned; as should the work of Sun Yun-chu
 on Trilobite and the strntigraphy of the Lower Paleozoic era, that of Huang
 Ch'1-ts~en on stratlgrnphy and Permian deposits, that of Yu Chien-cheng on
 Carboniferous deposits, that of Tien Ch'i-ch'un and Yin Chiang-ts'un on
 Devonian deposits, that of Hsueh Ts'e on the graptolites of the lower Yangtze
 valley, and that of Chen Hsueh on the fusilina of southern Chinn.
 In the field of mineralogy, petrography, and the study of deposits of use-
 ful minerals, the most important research was an the effusives of the Upper
 Mesozoic era in the re Rion of Huuan-hue, the systematic investigation of
 volcanic rccYs of the Nitrg-sheen mountain range near Ranking, end the study of
 granites and contact metamorphism in rocks composing the Hsi-shan range near
 Peiping.  During the same period, work in the field of petrography was begun.
 In 1935, Ho Ts'o-ling discovered rare earth minerals in the Suiyuan Province;
 these minerals served as the basis for the use of spectral analysis in the
 study of minerals in China.  Considerable work on the study of ore deposits and
 metallogeny was done by Hsieh Chia-,Jung and 6feng Sun-ming.
 As u result of research in the field of Quaternary geology by Li Ssu-kuang,
 it was established that glacial periods existed in the regions of Lu Shan, Huang
 Shan, crestern Hupeh, and Kwcichow.  The ?rork of Li Ssu-icuang on glacial and
 flu?,iological deposits opened new ways for the study of Quaternary geology and
 disi.roved the erroneous opinions of bourgeois geologists (such as Richtofen,
 Anderson, and others).
 Since 1927, Chinese geologists have begun to study the tectonic movements
 of the earth's crust.  Zt seas first of all determined that the chief orogenesis
 of the Mesozoic period in China corresponds to the Yon-shan movements.  In
 southern China, the Kwangsi movements were discovered to correspond to the
 Caledonian folding phase.  Different phases of the Hercynian movement in regions
 of southeast China were studied in detail and were subdivided according to
 period.  It was established that the Hercynian movements had n strong influence
 on the mountain area of western China.  The importance of the Himalayt. movements
 was gradually established and it uas proved that the pre-Hsi-ling movements were
 very significant in the formation of the Chinese continent.

 Study of tectonics of the Chinese continent has two principal trends --
 geological and geodynamic.
 On the basis of a stud;? of the phases of sedimentary rocks, the composition
 and distribution of fossil fauna, the types of volcanic rocks and folding,
 platform (i.e., stable or slightly folded) areas and geosynclinal (i.e., movable
 or intensely folded) areas in various geological periods have been discovered.
 The distribution of various strongly folded zones, and forms of str?ctural units
 forming certain zones have been studied by analyzing the interaction between
 stress and strain.  The results of this analysis make it possible to determine
 the types of structure of a given geological period and to establish the inter-
 relation between them.
 As a result of the development of this field of geology, the following
 conclusions were drawn regarding the formation of the Chinese continent.  The
 existence of latitudinal zone, particularly marked in certain latitudes, was
 established.  Most widely developed is the "catasiatic" structural line and,
 in connection therewith, the fault dislocations in eastern China and on the
 Pacific coast.  Among existing structural types of displacement deformation,
 the basic types are the E-shaped structures and arches, located on tha periphery
 of the continent.  Thee deforc~dtions reached their highest development after
 the Jurassic period.  The greatest curvatures in these structures occur on the
 surmnits, which are widely extended and are often accompanied by intrusives and
 ore deposits.  A great deal of research on these deformations was done by Li
 Ssu-kuang; considerable work on the separation of the tectonic units of China
 was done by Huang Ch'i-ts'en.
 Between 1937 and 1949, geological work in China was disturbed and dis-
 organized by the intervention of the Japanese and later the American imperi-
 alists.  The reactionary ruling classes of China tried to restrir'; geological
 research, but the geologists continued to work steadily and achieved certain
 successes.  For example, in Lu-feng iisien, Yunnan Province, vertebrate fossils
 of the Triassic period, including nu:nerousreptiles  (Saurichian) and r_a.~als
 (Deinotherium), were found.  These finds are ertre^;ely ic~portant in the
 classification and study of the evolution of vertebrates.  At the sar,:e time,
 relatively detailed studies were c.ade of the strata of southwest China and the
 pet.rolcum-bearing areas of northwest China.  Geological maps of the whole of
 China were compiled on the scale of 1:1,000,000 and 1:3,000,000, as well as
 geological maps of Szechwan and Kiangsi provinces on the scale of 1:200,000
 and of Kwangsi Province on a scale of 1:250,000.  A detailed study eras made of
 the Tertiary vulcanogenic rocks around Nanking.  Research was also done on the
 metamorphic zonality of eastern Sikang and other regions.
 It is evident from the above that although geological research in old
 China, played a certain part in the development of geological science, it rras
 scattered, unplanned, and completely alien to the practical life and needs of
 the people.  It was thus not properly developed in the past.
 After the establishment of the people's government, geological work
 developed anew.  Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, large-
 scale construction is being carried out, requiring close coordination with
 geological research and prospecting for mineral deposits.  The work of geologists
 in China has taken a new direction and has begun to serve the people.
 The complex geological expeditions to the Northeast, organized in 1950,
 combined the work of several previous organizations in China.  These expeditions
 formed the foundation for the organization of a single administration of
 geological research, the Committee for the Administration and Planning of
 Geological Work, which gradually took over the supervision of all crork in that

 field.  This cosmmittee was the predecessor of the Ministry of Geology, which
 was formed in September 1952' All gedlogical.institutions.id China were sub-
 sequently reorganized, and, to meet national requirements, all geological
 work was concentrated on problems connected with economic construction.  The
 Institute of Geology and the Insitute of Paleontology of the Academia Sinica
 were temporarily placed under the ,~urisidictibn of the Ministry of Geology,
 although the Cabinet for the Study of AnciP~t Vertebrates remained under the
 academy.  Geological administrations of tht ,ventral-South, Southwest, North
 China, Northwest, Iortheast, and East China administrative areas were or-
 ganized in the cities of Hankow, Chungking, Kalgan, Sian, Chang-ch'un, and
 Nanking, respectively.
 During the past 2 years, the geological service has concentrated entizely
 on meeting the requirements of national economic development, the prospecting
 of mineral resources, and the supplying of necessary data for hydraulic
 engineering construction.  Prospecting for mineral resources is carried out
 wlth two ends in viex.  First, deposits are prospected to meet the require-
 ments of industry.  During the past few years, more than 60 percent of
 Chinese geologists have been employed  in prospecting for iron, manganese,
 copper, tungsten, tin, coal, and petroleum deposits.  Second, much prospect-
 ing is carried out in order to discover new regions of deposits of useful
 minerals.  In addition to the prospecting work carried out in Chins proper,
 the Academia Sinica sent a scientific expedition, which included a number of
 geologists, to Tibet in the spring of 1951.
 Prospecting for and surveying of deposits of useful minerals have met
 with definite success.  Copper-nickel and scheelites have been founP in the
 Northeast and copper ore deposits have been found east of Tsinghai Province
 and south of Shensi Province.
 In the field of hydraulic engineering construction, geologists are taking
 an active part in the work of regulating the Huai Ho.  Work is also being done
 in connection with the construction of new railways.
 Little has been done in the field of geological scientific research work,
 but some practical investigations Yutve been coordinated with the scientific
 research in progress.  For example, the age of the Lower Paleozoic formations
 of the Northeast, in'the T'ai-ts~a Ho area, has been found.  The study of
 Phoroxylon, belonging to plant fossils found in the northern part oi'.the
 Northeast, Ys of great importance in botany.  Remnants of fossil flora have
 provided a definite solution to the problem of the Upper Oermian Era of the
 Shi-t'ien-fang fonnstion, as well as the problem of the existence of the
 Upper Devonian in the provinc_s of Hupeh, Kwangtung, Kiangsi, and Kansv.  On
 the basis of study of trilobites, it was determined that a large part of the
 "Mantos" clay formation Shantung (Province), which w?s formerly considered to
 be Locrer Cambrian was actually of the Middle Cambrian era.  The existence of
 Devonian deposits in western Hupeh Province hss been established.  With the
 help of local workers, .numerous  remnants of fossil vertebrates were found,
 especially in Lai-yang Hsien, Shantung Province.  Also, a large number of
 extremely well preser^ed fossil lizards of the Upper Cretaceous period have
 been discovered.
 During research work at Chou-k'ou-tien, the teeth of a prehistoric ^an
 were found and traces of the Quaternary glacial period were observed.  In
 studying the Hsi-shah range, near Peiping, various chloritoids were found,
 which had been formed under the inflaenca of dynamic metamoi~hism.  With the
 aid of X-ray and microscopic investigation, it was possible to determine the
 general laws governing the formation of agate and silicified wood.  By
 experimental research and field obsexvaticns, a connection was established

 between the formation of folds and fractures, fissures and cleavage structures.
 Research leis begun on discovering connections emong the E-shaped structure,
 the "catasiatic" structure, latitudinal folding, and the platform and geo-
 synclinal structures.
 Geological institutes have been opened in Peiping and Chang-ch'un for
 the purpose of trnining geological cadres.  The Peiping institute has been
 organized from the geological faculties of the Peiping, Tsinghun, and
 Tientsin universities and the Tien-shop Institute of Transportation.  In
 the Chang-ch~un institute, the geological faculties o: Shantung University
 and the Geological T~~.:hnilcu:a of the Northea^t have been combined and expanded.
 Over 5,000 students, including students of the former geological faculties.,
 are noror being trained in geological institutes.  In addition, there are
 geological colleges for training students with secondary school education in
 the cities of Nanking, Hanl:ow, and Chungking.  At present, about 8,000 stu-
 dents nre enrolled in geological institutes and colleges.
 The formation of a single leading geological organization and the feeling
 of collectivity which has develope3 among Chinese geologists during their
 K
 practical crorlc of the past few years have led to closer cooperation among
 them.  The steps taken to raise the ideological level of scientific xorkers
 and to develop criticism and self-criticism guarantee a further improvement
 of geological work in the new China.
 The speedy developTent of geology is closely corncected ~+ith the assist-
 ance received by the people of China from the Soviet Union.  The USSR not
 only supplies  China with various  geological prospecting  equipment, but
 also sends numerous specialists to China.  The ,e specialists are cooperating
 .a th Chinese geologists and are sharing the theories developed by Soviet
 scientists and the practical experience gained by the Soviet Union in the
 field of geology.  With the aid of Soviet specialists, it has been possible
 to disprove the erroneous opinion of bourgeois geologists that China was
 poor in petroleum and copper.  Petroleum was found in the limestones of the
 Ordovician period of Hopeh Province, and copper ores, related to the for-
 mation of secondary quartzites, were discovered in the southern part of
 Shensi Province.  This indicates the error of the statements by bourgeois
 geologists that petroleum is found in China only in marine tertiary deposits
 and that China has no copper deposits of porphritic ores.
 At present, Chinese geologists nre making efforts to master progressive
 Soviet theory and experience in the prospecting of useful minerals.  Geolog-
 ical institutes and colleges use. Soviet methods of instruction and Soviet
 teaching programs.  Geologists are striving to master the Russian language.
 They are given the task of learning the principles if grammar and the
 elementary vocabulary used in geological literature (about 200 words) in a
 period of one month, and in this way :rill be able to read Russian geological
 literature with the help of a dictionary.
 In January-February 1953, the Ministry of Geology called a conference
 of geological workers of all China.  The chief purpose of the conference
 was to familiarize the :corkers with leading Soviet geological theories and
 the practical experience of Soviet geologists.  Most of the time :vas de-
 voted to discussing the reports of Soviet geologists.  The reports contained
 statements and discussions of the basic requirements of prospecting work, as
 well as of problems of classification, estimates of reserves of mineral re-
 sources, geological work at the site of deposits during mining operations,
 prospecting for nonferrous :petals, iron, coal, and petroleum, problems of
 hydrogeology and engineering geology, and methods of scientific work.  The
 conference enabled Chinese geologists to become acquainted with the leading
 Soviet scientific methods and to review their own outdated opinions.

 Inst of bathematics,
 Academia Sinica
 Mathematics in China has a history of many centuries.  The creative works
 on mathematics in ancient China were remarkable.  For example, in 460 the
 Chinese mathematician Ts'u Chung-ch'i had calculated that the value of pi is
 included in the limits from 3.14159c6 to , 1415927?  He took 11~ 355 as an
 approximate value of pi.  In 1247, the Chinese nzthematician Chin Ch'iu-shoo
 devised a method for approxL^~ztely computing the roots of nn equation, ordi-
 narily called Horner 's method.  About 1200, the so-called Pascal triangle was
 found, called "kai-fang-ch'a-Bang-tu" in Chinese.
 However, during the prolonged dominance of feudalism, the further develop-
 ment of mathematics in China ceased.  htoreover, a considerable period from
 1367 to 1750, was marked by signs of regression.  The mathematicians of this
 period not only did not develop the successes of their predecessors, but also
 were uiuible to grasp their remarkable atca.inments.  An example is the forget-
 ting of the method for solving systems of equations with four unknowns, which
 was discovered as early as 1303.
 At the end of the 16th century, as a result of the development of
 navigaticn, advanced mathematical knowledge and methods from the West began
 to penetrate China.  Chlnese mathematicians seized upon these methods and
 began to study the works oi' their own predecessors on the basis of this new
 information,  In particular, they again studied the long-forgotten method
 for solving a system with four unYsiowns.
 However, China has actually started on the path of present-day mathe-
 matical investigations only in the last 25 years.  In this: period, Chinese
 mathematicians have written about 1,100 works (besides works on applied
 mathematics).
 An object of systematic study was Fourier series.  A larger number of
 mathematicians worked in this field.  Outstanding among these is Chen Chien-
 kung,
 Chen Chien-kung began to work in 192.  Independently of Western
 mathematicians (M~ Riesz, Hardy, and Littleorood), he found the necessary and
 sufficient condition fog the absolute convergence of trigonometric series;
 he considered the set (svertka) of two functions and showed that if a trig-
 onometric series converges everywhere absolutely to f(x), then f(x) can be
 represented as the set of two functions from L2, and conversely.

 It is necessary to note also the works of Ch en Chien-kung on orthogonal
 series.  Some of them overlap the investigations of D. Ye. Men~shov,  In
 aarticular, Ch en Chien-kung established the equivalence of the following two
 familiar theorems:
 (1)  If L (log n)2?Cn < m   , then ~ Cn}n(x) converges almost everywhere.
 (2)  If ~ (loglog n)2?C~ < oo, then ~ Cn~n(Y) (C, 1) almost everywhere.
 Incidentally, Ch en Chien-kung established the equivalence of the first
 theorem (and consequently also of the second theoreri) to the follmring fact:
 (3)  If ~ (loglog n)2Cn < m  , then the sequence of partial sums S(x,2),
 S(x,22),.., , S(x,2n) converges almost everywhere (here Sr,~ means the p-th
 partial sum of the series ~ CncLn(i)~'
 AnotheF important problem, long ago studied by Chinese mathematicians,
 is the ~wmnability of trigonometric series.
 As for str..~a ,usursbility, Wang Fu-ch~un demonstrated in 1945 that the
 Fourier series of the function f(x) possr~ses strong ~w:miability under the
 condition that   f
 f  I~(u)I ?{1+Log~l~'(u)~) ?rlu=o(t),
 where t-ir0,  and CP(u)c~~f(xfu)ft(x-u) -2S~.
 This result represents the solution of the problem posed by Hardy and
 Littlewood.
 The works of Wang Fu-ch~un on the Riesz suumiability  me very profound.
 According to HlIardy and Littlewood, the conditions
 (1)   f `I4(u) f?du~o(tllog  t  ), where  t-~  40,

 Wang Fu-ch~un demonstrated by an example that under condition (1) it is
 possible to replace IQ(~i)I by  ~ (u).  He also obtained many results by in-
 vestigating the Riesz summability of Fourier series under various conditions.
 Afany mathematicians have undertaken the study of Fourier series under
 the guidance of Chen Chien-kung.  One of these is Cheng Min-te, who demon-
 strated that if the spherical partial sws

 where epsilon (E) is a:>,y positive number, then the trigonometric series
 identically equals zero.
 The first works of Su Pu-ch~ing mainly concern differential geometry in
 affine space, especially affine thaw..y of surfaces of rotation.  He extended
 the characteristic properties of a suri'ece of rotation in Euclidean space to
 affine space and determined such surfaces.  Among the many other works of Su
 Pu-ch'ing on the theory of surfaces in affine space, is his investigation of
 the second-order Alutard surface.
 Su Pu-ch'ing has guided Investigations on projective differential
 geometry.  The principal successes here have been attained in two fields:
 1.  In +.he field of curve theory, where Su Pu-ch'ing and Ch ung Su-
 cheng have investigated the properties of singular points of curves on a
 plane and in a space, and have studied, with the aid of these points, the
 curves in projective space.
 2.  In the field surface theory, where Chang Su-chcng has discovered
 certain properties of linear surfaces, and Pai Ch'ing-Y.uo has solved the
 Fubini problem concerning asymptotic curves on surfaces.
 Su Pu-ch~ing~s investigations on linear complexes and iris study of the
 Laplace sequence rith period 4 have been closely connected with the work of
 S. r. i?'inikov.
 Recently, Su Pu-ch~ing has undertaken to generalize the theory of
 connectivity in a space of K-spread, where the principal results concern the
 theory of declinations in a Finsler-Cartan space.
 A large group of mathematicians is working under the direction of Su
 Pu-ch~ing.
 It is also necessary to note the recent attainments of Sun Tsa-ying.
 The familiar problem of the equivalence of generalized spaces, which has
 begun to be studied by means of tensor analysis, has been worked out pux?ely
 geometrically by Sun Tse-ying; his results are significantly better than
 previous ones.
 Integral geometry has been undertaken mainly by Wu Ta-jen, who has ex-
 tended the main kinematic fomulas of integral geometry to double points in
 the theory of curves and has employed the dual formula of the principal
 formula in the field of integral geometry, hence obtaining a number of
 integral formulas.  Wu Ta-jen has developed certain basic results of inte-
 gral geometry in elliptic space.
 Prof Yen Clt'i-ta has considered the main kinematir_ formulas in n-
 dimensional space.

 Combinatorial topology assumed a leading position in the investigations of
 the Institute of Mathematics at the Central Academy.  Therefore the number of
 topologists wrs large.  Unfortunately, some of them went to the USA  when Chiang
 Kai-shek compelled the Institute of Mathematics to move to Taiwan.  However,
 they returned to China.  I shall discuss the topologists who remained in China.
 Chiang Ch'e-hen turned from variational calculus in general to topology
 and is now working mainly on the theory of manifolds.  Chang Su-ch'eng studied
 homestopic types and problems relating to them.  Yen Ch'i-ta studied the topo-
 logical properties of Lie groups and differential geometry; he found the
 Poi?care polynomials for five exceptional Lie groups.
 Soviet mathematics exerted the strongest influence on the analytical theory
 of numbers.  H~,a T,o-keng (author of this article) began to undertake and to di-
 rect works in this field in China.  His first acquaintance with the works of
 Soviet mathematicians was in 1935?  He studied certain basic results obtained
 in the Petersburg school, mainly the works of Academician I. M. Vinogtndov, and
 extensively employed Vinogradov's metho3 ir. various problems of number theory.
 Hua Lo-keng's first general work, which summarized his investigations, was
 ccmpleted in 1940 and published in Volume xCCI of the Trudy idatematicheslcogo
 Institute tmeni V. A. Steklova  Akademii Nauk SSSR (Works of the Mathematical
 Institute imeni V. A. Steklov of the Academy of Sciences USSR).  This cork mainly
 concerned the Waring problem with prime unknowns and system of equations with
 prime unknowns.
 IIua Lo-keng also concluded a number of other works.  In the Terry problem
 he obtained the upper bound for M(k):
 M(k) ,  (K}1) 11  l0  2  (k+2)     ~ +I /
 I L log  k+l    -log k
 exp C2?tif(x,Y)IPI,
 ya
 where f(x,y) is a polynomial of power k with integral coefficients, and p is
 a prime number.  It was  demonstrated  that for certain condi'.:ons this sum
 equals   0(P` - ~)
 Later Min Ssu-heo generalized this result to the case of n-variables.
 In 1947 Min Ssu-heo demonstrated that

 He demonstrated that the absolute minimum primitive root module prime p is less
 than 2m.  p, where m is the number of various prime divisors of (p-1).  These
 works are closely connected with the works of Academician I. M. Vinogradov. The
 method obtained by Hua Lo-keng in the field of the complete trigonometric sum
 not only simplifies past existing proofs, but also is applicable in the field
 of algebraic theory of numbers and in the special series of the Terry problem.
 In the field of the analytical theory of numbers, Hua Lo-keng, together
 with his associate Min Ssu-heo, studied the double trigonometric sum

 The theory of p:vbability  and mathem aic:11 statistics ue_e developed in
 China only after 1939, when certain Chinese students bc~;u: to study mathematical
 statistics in 13ng1and.  After 1t-5 years they had masterai the theory on the
 verification of hypotheses, which had been developed in the FLslter school, and
 obtained goo.] results.  !?fost remarkable were the works of Hsu Yao-lu, who, in
 his numerous works, developed new rcat'nematical tecluciques for these problems.

 In the theory of schlicht functions, for exa;aple, the following result
 was obtained as early as 1933   If the function
 o-?        ~ kr+1
 ra
 is a schlicht function within the unit circle 1 and k equals either 1, or 2, or
 3, then the evaluation
 1- 2  '
 ft .; an ek
 is correct for the coefficients an of this function.
 In the field of the theory of schlicht functions, a comparatively large
 number d  ~ithematicians has been working under the guidance of Chen Chien-kung.
 'These mathematicians are now studying the method of the Soviet mathematician
 G. M. Goluzin and are applying this method in their investigations.
 Much has been done on the history of ancient Chinese mathematics by Li
 Yen and Chien Pao-ts'ung, who have investigated the problem of the tlme of
 appearance of ancient works and have modernized the sy^a'~ols and formulas
 employed by ancient Chinese muthemnti?tans.  They have contibuted much value-
 able material for the study of the history of ancient mathematics in China,
 and for the compilation of the history of mathematic's development in our
 country.
 Before the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, universities
 and scientific institutions in China conducted certal- nathem^_tical inves::i-
 gntions that did not require any equipment;  in a numbe=?  oY x'ields,  dei'i[[ite
 successes were gained.  However, these investigations proceeded slowly, of
 their own accord, and without plan.  The investigatio:s had no definite dl-
 rectiou to their operations; direction varied according to the personal
 interests of the teachers.  idoreover, these interests were usually dictated
 by the "modes" of bourgeois countries.  The advanced Soviet mathematical
 investigations were generally little known.  Many in China considered mathe-
 matics a play of the imagination devoid of practical purpose and did not
 ? understand that mathematics arises from the requirements of practice and from
 experience.  Such a position was natural under former conditions.
 The great victory of the Chinese people cleared the way for the develop-
 ment of all the sciences, of which mathematics is one.
 Soon after the organization in the People's China of the Academia Sinica,
 the In=titute of Mathematics was created.  The number of students in the
 mathematical faculties of universities was increased.  Under the guiding
 influence o:' the Chinese Communists Party and of the people's government of
 China. mathematicians realized the practical significance of their operations,
 and pe[?ccived that the purpose of mathematics, as in other sciences, is to
 serve tue native land.
 In China, all obstacles that had impeded the studv of the attainments
 of advanced Soviet science were liquidated.  Chinese scientific workers are
 now learning with great enthusiasm from their Soviet colleagues.
 'b!ost instructors in the universities have learned to read, with the help
 of a dictionary, literature iri Russian and have worked out plans to translate
 many books from Russian into Chvrese.  Already, at least 30 volumes have been

 Smirnov's Kurs Vysshey Matematiki (A Course of Higher btathematics) and of
 Academician I. M. Vinogradov's Osnoy Teorii Chisel (Principles of the Theory
 of I7umbers) hale already become our textbooks.
 The Institute of Flathematics is conducting profound investigations of
 the results of the Petersburg school in numbers theory.  In particular,
 special attention is being paid to the works of Academician I. td. Vinogradov
 and of Prof Yu. V. Linnik.  The works of G. M. Goluzin on schlicht functions
 are exerting great influence on our work.  In the field of theory of proba-
 bility and mathematical statistics, our students are learning from the Soviet
 school directed by Academician ^. N. Kolmogorov.  Colloquia are being held on
 i'?ti?~ works of Z. M.  Gel'Yand and t?1.  P..  iiaymark.   The symposium entitled 30 Let
 Sovetskoy Matematiki (Thirty Years of Soviet t?Sathematics) has been almost
 completely translated into C:?inese.  .le play. to translate all the mathematical
 ~oorks that win Stalin prizes.
 In the process of strengthening the indestructible friendship of China
 and the Soviet Union, a close cooperation with Soviet scientists has become
 the desire of all Chinese mathematicians.
 Chinese aathematicians are carefully considering the ways for the further
 development of iu. science.  We p;' pose to initiate study of those branches of
 mathematics that were only little ur not at all studied in China, e. g.,
 functional analysis and ~ hers.  We propose to develop those branches that
 have some foundation in the past, e.g., the theory of functions with several
 variables and other studies.  Also, we propose to improve the quality of
 investigations in those fields that have a fairly good foundation, e.g.,
 Fourier series.
 Problems still exist in all fields of Chinese mathemntics; also there
 are many weak spots, although not in all branches.  Thus, at present, it is
 difficult to look forward to the time when, in 5-10 years, the study of
 mathematics in China will encompass all branches of this science, as in the
 case of our esteemed Soviet colleagues.
 Therefore, we cannot distinguish the important from the second-rate and
 the urgent from the nonurgent, depending on the practical requirements of
 the state.  We have resolved to make differential and integral equations,
 which posses direct practical value, and functional analysis, which is im-
 portant for mathematics itself, the bases of the development of our mathematics.
 These fields had hot?been appreciated enough by the mathematical community of
 China in the semifeudalistic and semicolonial past of China.
 Finally, to turn our attention to what is basic does not mean to forget
 the rest.  lJe shall consolidate those branchca that nlread~ possess attainments,
 fur example, analysis of Fourier series, analytical theory of ..,~uioers, topology,
 and differential geometry.
 We believe that, under the wi^,e guidance of the Chinese Communist Party
 and oi' Chairman Mao Tse-tung, we shall succeed, by studying the advanced
 experience of the Soviet Union, in quickly developing and strengthening our
 science, in order that it may play its proper role in the economic and cul-
 tural development of China.

 No  , 1953, Pages 21-2                  Inst of Industrial Chem, Academia Sinica
 In old China, which was long under the yoke of the imperialists, and then
 later undex? the yoke of the reactionary Kuomintang government, chemical research
 did not advance very far.
 At first, such research was begun in the field of analytic chemistry during
 World 1Jar 1; analyses of coal and  mineral ores were made rather systematically.
 By 1930, in the institutions of higher ]earning, a transition eras gradually
 made to research in the field of foo3, physical, an3 pharmaceutical chemistry.
 $ut all this work was conducted unsyst.ematicaily.  Somewhat later, special re-
 search establishments were set up, in :r^'c; rr-search work eras carried out in
 organic, physical, pharmaceutical, a:~l industrial chemistry.
 Research in organic chemistry was directed toward the synthesis of styrene
 compounds and a number of other organic comnourds.  Work in pharmaceutical
 chemistry had to do with vegetable alkaloids an3 glucosides contained in Chinese
 medicinal herbs.  Researc.. in physical chemistry included the study of the ab-
 soc?ption spectra of polyatomic molecules of linear structure, the stereochemistry
 of biphenyl, the Joule-Jay-Thompson effect in the field of ideal gases, and the
 phase equilibrium of metals.  In industrial chemistry, research has been con-
 ducted on bauxites, water-soluble salts obtained in fermentation processes, coal,
 liquid fuel, ceramics and porcelain, tang oil, lacquers, oils, fats, and the
 smelting of vanadium, tungsten, and other metals.  'fhe results of t}cis research
 served as a foundation for the creation of certain branches of industry.  For
 example, production of scda by the Ho Te-pang method was organized.
 When the war of resistance against the Japanese aggressors was begun, a
 large part of the research was discontinued, and only some work in the field of
 industrial chemistry was continued.  For example, a study was made of the
 feasibility of obtaining benzene, mazut, and lubx?icating oils from vegetable
 oils.  The production of paper from local raw materials, and the production of
 artificial leather, fireproof materials, plastics, etc. were also studied.  The
 technology of the processes of wood distills+,ion was developed.  On the basis
 of the results of some of this research, industrial production was set up on a
 small scale.
 After the expulsion of the Japanese aggressors, the basis for research in
 the areas under Kuomintang rule virtually ceased to exist, in view of tha fact
 that the corrupt Kuomintang regime permitted the dumping of goods by the
 American imperialists.  All research, except work of dyestuffs and the proc-
 essing of medicinals, stopped.
 Favorable conditions for the developr. ~t of science in New China were
 established only after t}ce victory of the l:iiinese people's revolution.  After
 the reorganization of the state economy and the renewal and growth of pro-
 duction, research in chemistry was also 3eveloped.  During the more than
 3 years since the establishment of the people'_ hegemony, the volume and
 scope of chemical research expanded considerably.
 At present, besides analytical and research laboratories in the factories
 and plants, there are 11 chemical scientific research establishments in Chine,
 including five institutes of the Academia Sinica. In scale of research, these
 institutes differ widely.  Also, the number of scientific workers varies from
 50 t.o several hundred, and the subjects cf research vary.

 ~         In the Complex Research Institute, half the research is on industrial
 chemistry; the principal work is done on synthetic rubber, cellulose chemistry,
 rare elements, etc.  The Institute of Industrial Chemistry is concet?ned with
 problems of crude petroleum, synthetic liquid fuel, lubricating oils, and fire-
 proof materials.  In the Institute of Organic Chemistry, studies are being
 made of compounds of high molecular weight, antibiotics, and vitamins.  The
 Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry is working on the synthesis of special
 drugs and of Chinese medicines.  At the Institr:t? ~f Physical Chemistry, re-
 search is being conducted in molecular spectral analysis, fluorescence chemistry,
 applied electrochemistry, and other subjects.
 In addition, at six scientific research institutes subordinated to adminis-
 trations studies are being made of shale oils, vegetable oils and fats, organo-
 silicon compounds, inorganic salts, the chemical composition oi' sea water,
 problems of the technology of producing paper, ceramics, porcelain, and rubber,
 problems of skin tanning, etc.  Scientific repot?ts and articles are published in
 the  Chemical Bulletin, the Scientific Research Bulletin of Northeast China, the
 Bulletin of Chemical Industry, Scientific Corunurtications, and other publi.ca':ions.
 The basic chemical research carried on in the IIe?.r China is divide3 into
 three groups.  The first group includes research pertaining to the needs of
