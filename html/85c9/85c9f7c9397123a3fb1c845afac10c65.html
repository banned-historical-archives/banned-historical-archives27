 SING - SOVIET  R ELATIONS
 POLEMICS ON CHINESE ANNIVERSARY REFLECT WIDENING GAP
 Soviet comment commemorating the PRC National Day on 1 October ias
 underlined recent signs of a widening gap in relations between the
 two adversaries.  The Soviet greetings message-,-from the USSR
 Supreme Soviet and State Council to the Chinese National People's
 Congress and State Coui.cil, just as was last year's--reflect?.'.
 the deterioration in Sino-Soviet relations since 1974 and the
 stalemated negotiations on normalizing state relations by om'.tting
 previous Soviet avowals on the issue,   Signed articles in PTJVDA
 and IZVFSTIYA were consonant with rererit tough Soviet commen'. on
 China in being substantially h-~,sher toward Maoist policies than
 similar commemorative articles in 1974.  Moscow's stance iv:
 consistent with its pessimistic assessment of possible improvement
 in Sino-Soviet relations set forth in a KOMMUNIST editoria  article
 in August,* as well as with the continuing stalemate in Sino-Soviet
 border negotiations in Peking, marked by the absence from China
 since early May of the chief Soviet negotiator.
 Peking gave its usual curt treatment to Soviet commemoration of
 the anniversary.  Authoritative Chinese comment on the concurrent
 1 October 20th anniversary of the founding of Sinkiang Province,
 on the Sino-Soviet border, bluntly testified to PR.C hostility by
 giving special stress to the danger of Soviet "surprise attack"
 against China.
 SOVIET COMMENT     The Soviet comment reflected the more.
 pessimistic stance Moscow has taken on improved
 ties with the PRC since the Chinese National People's Congress in
 January enshrined hostility to "social imperialism" io the revised
 PRC state constitution.  The Soviet greetings message did not
 repeat last year's statements that improved bilateral relations
 would be consistent with the decision of the 24th Soviet congress,
 would enjoy "unanimous support from the entire Soviet people,"
 or would serve to strengthen world socialism and contribute to
 international peace and security.  It also refrained this year from
 specifying measures the USSR has undertaken in order to improve
 *  The August KOMMUNIST editorial. article is the third such
 Soviet comment to be issued at this time each year since 1973, and
 it is Moscow's most authoritative comment since a PFAVDA editorial
 article last February on China's National People's congress.
 See the TRENDS of 27 August 1975, pages 14-15 for a discussion
 of the KOMMUNIST article as summarized by TASS on 20 and 21 August.

 ties, unlike 1974, when Soviet proposals for a treaty on non-use
 of force and a treaty of non-aggression with the PRC were
 mentioned as steps conducive to bettering relations.
 The usual signed articles in PRAVDA and IZVESTIYi~ on 1 October
 contained standard Soviet avowals of determination to rebuff
 Maoism while trying to normalize state relations, but unlike last
 year, they raised charges against China on sensitive bilateral
 disputes, including the border problem.  PRAVDA referred
 specifically to Chinese territorial claims against the USSR and
 other Asian countries.   Though IZVESTIYA claimed that Maoism "does
 not have a future," both commentaries depicted the current Peking
 regime as thoroughly in control of China and institutionalizing a
 solid anti-Soviet direction in PRC policy that dimmed prospects for
 normalization.  Not surprisingly, there was no reference to
 Brezhnev's relatively optimistic observation at the 24th Soviet
 Party Congress, highlighted in last year's PRAVDA commentary,
 about Moscow's confidence in the prospects for Sino-Soviet
 normalization.
 CHINESE TREATMENT     NCNA's terse report on the 30 September PRC
 embassy reception in Moscow disclosed that,
 as he had last year, Deputy Foreign Minister Ilichev led the
 Soviet turnout.  NCNA as usual identified Ilichev as the head of
 the Soviet delegation to the Peking border talks.  NCNA, as in
 past years, also replayed this year's Soviet greetings message.
 Typical of the hardline anti-Soviet Chinese invective marking the
 1 October Sinkiang anniversary was a speech by PRC Politburo
 member and Vice Premier Chen Hsi-lien at a 29 September Urumchi
 rally.  As reported by NCNA, Chen warned his audience to prepare
 against the danger of superpower war, noting in particular that
 "we must never forget that the Soviet revisionists have not
 renounced their intention to subjugate our country," a,.td adding
 that "we must do our work well and guard against surpri;e attack
 by the Soviet revisionists."  NCNA reported on 2 October that
 Chen and other PRC officials personally congratulated repro..seatatives
 of the Sinkiang militiamen who captured the crew of an intruding
 Soviet helicopter in March 1974.
 PEOPLE'S DAILY ATTACKS GROMYKO DISARMAMENT PROPOCALS
 Authoritative Peking press reaction to Soviet disarmament proposals

 such disarmament proposals since the fall of 1972, repeated the
 criticism in PRC Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua's UNGA speech
 on 26 September, but employed notably harsher language.*
 Commentator focused primarily on denouncing Moscow's current
 plan for a total ban on testing nuclear weapons and gave routine
 criticism to other current Soviet initiatives.
 Commentator depicted the various plans put forward by Gromyko as
 "a sheer lie of Goebbels' style," and an "out-and-out fraud."
 He said that the USSR has merely been using the "smokescreen" of
 detente to expand nuclear armaments, "gradually catching up with
 and in certain respects surpassing those of the other superpower."
 NUCLEAR WEAPON TEST   Commentator called Gromvko's proposal
 BAN DENOUNCED         prohibiting nuclear weapons testing merely
 a rehash of "rotten stuff" "handed down
 from the ::hrushchev period."  He reaffirmed China's stance that
 the "only way" to eliminate the nuclear threat and war was by
 complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.
 And he restated the Chinese demand that the superpowers and other
 nuclear countries must agree not to be the first to use nuclear
 weapons, in order to provide the "first step" toward ending
 nuclear war.
 The article claimed that the USSR was presently advocating a ban
 on nuclear weapons testing since "it has conducted enough tests"
 and thereby plans to use the ban "to bind other nuclear and
 non-nuclear countries hand and foot" and engage in "nuclear
 blackmail."  It equated the current Soviet effort with its
 negotiation of the limited test ban treaty 12 years ago, after
 Moscow had "wantonly carried out nuclear tests in the atmosphere."
 Commentator also pointed out that the present Soviet proposal
 provided "enough leeway" for continued Soviet underground nuclear
 testing by stipulating that such tests can be conducted for
 "peaceful uses."
 OTHER GROMYKO      The article dismissed as "worn-out themes"
 ARMS PROPOSALS     Gromyko's rear:eration of Soviet calls for a
 10 percent reduction in the military budgets
 of the five permanent Security Council members and for the
 convening of a world disarmament conference.  Commentator devoted

 He charged that this was "an international laughing stock,"
 since the Soviets "cannot explain clearly what they want to ban"
 but are merely using the proposal to divert world attention from the
 "urgent questLon" of total prohibition and destruction of
 nuclear weapons.

 INDOCHINA
 PRG DENOUNCES U,S, PLAN TO RETURN REFUGLES UNILATERALLY
 South Vietnamese authorities have reacted with mild indignation to
 the U.S. plan to unilaterally repatriate by ship a large group of
 disgruntled Vietnamese refugees who want to return home from Guam
 and the United States.  Official Vietnamese communist reaction
 came in a 4 October PRG Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement
 which, while denouncing the U.S. proposal, stopped short of stating
 that the refugees would be refused admission if they returned to
 Vietnam.  In recent months the plight of Vietnamese refugees who
 want to go back has received only scant attention in Vietnamese
 media.  Monitored Vietnamese media comment and reportage
 accompanying the foreign ministry spokesman's statement has
 likewise been limited to .a Liberation Press Agency commentary,
 broadcast on the 6th by Libeiation Radio, and brief'Hanoi radio
 reports--which reiterated the arguments of the spokesman's
 statement.
 The relatively low-level foreign ministry spokesman's statement,
 while not taking a specific stand on whether the PRG would accept
 the refugees if returned by the United States, did make it clear
 that the Vietnamese communist authorities were dissatisfied with
 the United States for proposing to act without PRG "authorization."
 Characterizing the U.S. move as a "criminal act," the statement
 demanded that the Ford Administration "immediately stop it" and
 pointedly reminded the United States that the matter of
 authorizing the refugees' return was a "sovereign right of
 Vietnam" and should not be settled simply "according to the
 desires" of the United States.
 The foreign ministry statement was also addressed to the refugees
 themselves.  Professing a desire for an early end to the family
 separations caused by the U.S. evacuation, the statement noted
 that each of those who filed an application for repatriation would
 be considered by the FRG on a "specific case" basis.  Then, in
 what could be construed as a threat to those who intend to return
 without PRG permission, the statement warned that the refugees
 should "protect themselves" by being "aware of the enemy plot and
 unite in struggling against the adventurous U.S. act."
 BACKGROUND     Previous Vietnamese media comment on the refugees
 shortly after the April communist takeover in the
 South had seemed to take the tack that they should be returned by
 the United States unilaterally, and had made no mentiun of the
 formality now being set forth by the PRG of deciding each case on

 an individual basis.   For example, a 9 May Hanoi radio commentary
 on the reported "maltreatment of forced evacuees" demanded that
 the Ford Administration "return all the South Vietnamese forced
 evacuees to their homeland."  A 25 May QUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 commentary on the refugees quoted Australian Prime Minister
 Whitlam to the effect that the best solution would be for
 the United States to let the refugees return to their own
 country.  The same commentary also cited an unidentified UN
 spokesman as "acknowledging" that the PRG had a "cooperative
 attitude" and welcomed "those who . . . now choose to return."
 Subsequent sparse Vietnamese media comment and reportage on the
 refugees have dwelt more on what was described as their dissatis-
 faction with refugee camp life and their desire to return home,
 but without the earlier specific urgings that the United States
 allow them to do so.
 PHNOM PENH MORE EFFUSIVE ON PRC ANNIVERSARY THAN ON DRV FETE
 Phnom Penh comment on 1 October 26th anniversary of the PRC was
 markedly warmer than its comment marking the 2 September 30th
 anniversary of the DRV.  This duplicates the pattern of Cambodian
 comment employed on these anniversaries in the past and underlines
 Phnom Penh's continuing differentiated approach to its own neighboring
 commu-fist allies.
 As in past years, Cambodian comment on the Chinese anniversary
 included congratulatory messages from Prince Norodom Sihanouk and
 RGNU Prime Minister Penn Nouth to PRC Premier Chou En-lai, as well
 as Front radio comment, this year in the form of a radio editorial.
 on 1 October.  Cambodian leaders led by Penn Nouth also attended the
 30 September PRC ambassador's reception in Phnom Penh.
 Sihanouk's message to Chou En-lai hailed Peking's support for just
 national liberation struggles, noted China's "exemplary fraternal
 friendship and militant solidarity" with Cambodia, and extended
 his "highest, most grateful, most affectionate and admirative
 considerations."  Sihanouk's message to Ton Due Thang on DRV National
 Day had pointed out only that Cambodia is "a neighbor, intimate
 friend, brother, and comrade-in-arms" of Vietnam, and extended his
 "very high and fraternal consideration."
 In extending "heartiest congratulations" and "best wishes" to
 China, the 1 October Phnom Penh radio editorial called China the
 "strong steel bulwark of the democratic and socialist movement for
 national liberation," and repeatedly expressed Cambodia's "most

 revolutionary internationalism."  The 1 October editorial also noted
 that since the April liberation, Sino-Cambodian relations have
 become "increasingly intimate" and "mutual assistance and support
 increasingly active," setting an example for relations between a
 great nation and a small one.  It called Mao Tse-tung and
 Chou En-lai "the closest and most intimate friends of the Cambodian
 people."
 By contrast, Phnom Penh's radio editorial on 2 September on the
 DRV's 30th anniversary had only extended "warm greetings" to the
 Vietnamese people, recalled that the people of Vietnam, Cambodia,
 and Laos had "joined their seething efforts" against the common
 enemy of "U.S. imperialism," and included the long-standard statement
 of expectation that Cambodian-Vietnamese friendship would be
 ''strengthened and forever developed on the path of equality and
 mutual assistance."  Apart from hailing the "militant solidarity and
 everlasting friendship" between Vietnam and Cambodia, the editorial
 included no additional characterization of solidarity or mutual
 support between the two nations.
 1974 OBSERVANCES     Cambodian comment on the PRC's anniversary
 last year had also been more effusive than its
 comment marking the DRV National Day.  For example, last year's
 Phnom Penh radio article had hailed Peking's multiform support for
 the Cambodian struggle and had enthusiastically discussed
 Sino-Cambodian solidarity. It had also called China Cambodia's
 "powerful support and reliable mainstay," expressed "deepest thanks"
 for Chinese moral, material, and political support, and saluted the
 health of Mao and Chou.  Last year's Cambodian Front radio article on
 the DRV's anniversary had stressed standard themes of Cambodian-
 Vietnamese fraternity and solidarity in the common struggle, in a
 tone comparable to this year's radio editorial.
 DRV'S OBSERVANCE OF PRC ANNIVERSARY MORE SUBDUED THAN 1974
 North Vietnam's observance of the 1 October PRC National Day this year
 followed the standard pattern with the usual "grand meeting,"
 congratulatory message, and editorial comment, with some evidence of
 less effusiveness on Hanoi's part.
 Consistent with past years, VWP Politburo member Hoang Van Hoan
 headed the Vientamese representation at the 29 September Hanoi
 meeting, while the customary Chinese reception hosted by Ambassador
 Fu Hao on the 30th saw the attendance of Premier Pham Van Dong,
 Defense Minister Vo Nguyen Giap, Foreign Minister Nguyen Van Trinh,
 and Hoang Van Hoan.

 This year's DRV greetings message to the PRC was slightly more
 subdued than last year's.*               Vietnamese gratitude for Chinese
 help was merely expressed as "sincere and profound thanks
 great and effective assistance and support."                      for
 1974 DRV message had noted China's "wholehearted support   the
 all-round and effective assistance."                  Pportt and great,
 This year's Hanoi message concluded by characterizing the two
 countries as "comrades and brothers" acting in the "spirit of
 proletarian internationalism."
 DRV TREATMENT OF YUGOSLAV VISITORS REFLECTS NEUTRAL STANCE
 Hanoi's treatment of the 2-6 October visit by a Yugoslav government
 delegation headed by Federal Executive Council President Bijedic
 laid heavy stress on the two countries' common goals of "independence,
 equality and mutual respect," while showing a relatively cool reaction
 to evident Yugoslav encouragement to Vietnam to become more actively
 engaged with the nonalined states and follow the Yugoslav example.
 The Hanoi media's selective treatment of certain speeches and themes
 also reflected customary DRV caution about publicizing statements
 potentially polemical or offensive to either Moscow or Peking.
 The joint communique on the visit, carried by TANJUG on the 6th
 and VNA the next day, expressed "satisfaction" with results of the
 1974 DRV-Yugoslav agreements on "economic, scientific and technical
 cooperation" and on "trade and payments," and spoke of the need for
 further efforts to develop cooperation in all fields.  No new
 economic or other agreements were announced; a TANJUG report on the
 April 1974 agreement signed at the conclusion of DRV Premier Pham
 Van Dong's visit to Yugoslavia had noted that it covered a five-year
 period.
 TREATMENT OF DRV'S     Yugoslav comment in advance of Bijedic's
 NONALINED STATUS       Asian tour had stressed its importance,
 particularly for developing stronger relations
 and strengthening the unity and role of nonalined countries.  A TANJUG
 commentary on the 28th noted  that nonalined unity was "essential"
 for preserving the independence and sovereignty of the nonalined
 states.  Reflecting Hanoi sensitivity about giving offense to
 Moscow by overplaying the DRV's own role among the nonalined
 and its ties with Yugoslavia, DRV spokesmen and the media gave
 sparse, pro forma attention to the nonalined role, including
 several paragraphs in the final joint communique which praised

 the role of the nonalined states in defending independence, freedom
 and economic sovereignty.  Hanoi's seemingly middle-road position
 was spelled out in traditional terms by Pham Van Dong in his
 2 October speech at a formal reception honoring the Yugoslav
 visitors.  After describing in standard terms Vietnam's postwar
 task as building a "peaceful, unified, independent, democratic
 and prosperous Vietnam, a socialist Vietnam," Dong declared that
 this task required
 that we reinforce the great friendship and the all-sided
 cooperation with the fraternal socialist countries, and
 at the same time expand good relations with the nonalined
 countries, the Third World countries, and other countries
 in the world .      .
 Dong made only one passing reference to Yugoslavia's "positive
 participation" in the nonalined movement, and his only other
 reference to nonalinement came in a Cambodian context, where he
 referred to Cambodians building a "really independent, peaceful,
 neutral, nonalined, democratic and prosperous Cambodia. . . ."
 HANOI TREATMENT OF     North Vietnam's circumspection in reporting
 BIJEDIC SPEECHES       the speeches by Bijedic reflected Hanoi's
 customary selective editing to avoid
 possible offense to Moscow or Peking, most recently illustrated by
 the Vietnamese media omitting Chinese criticism of Moscow during
 VWP First Secretary Le Duan's 25-28 September PRC visit.*  On at
 least three occasions the DRV media omitted passages in Bijedic
 speeches, as carried by Yugoslav media, that could be construed
 as offensive particularly to the Soviet Union, given the recent
 relatively cool state of Moscow-Belgrade ties.  VNA's account of
 Bijedic's 2 October Hanoi reception speech omitted a single passage
 where Bijedic, discussing the international situation, said:
 "Undemocratic methods and practice continue to be present in
 international relations.  Political and economic pressures against
 de\!,loping countries, interference in internal affairs of other
 countries, and efforts to cause internal difficulties and to
 provoke putsches continue."
 Briefly reporting Bijedic remarks during a 3 October visit to a
 Hanoi institute, Vietnamese media omitted his suggestion for "united
 actions" by "nonalined" countries as a deterrent to the "policy of
 aggression, pressure and interference" in other countries' internal

 affairs.  And in reporting Bijedic's remarks at a 5 October reception
 he gave on the eve of his departure, VNA again omitted his statements
 about the similarity of the problems both countries faced, including
 "establishing equal and democratic relations in the international
 community," in a context where Bijedic seemed to be alluding to
 Soviet pressures upon Yugoslavia in the past year--without, however,
 naming Moscow.  VNA confined its own account of Bijedic's remarks
 to generalities about the future of Yugoslav-Vietnamese relations
 and his expressions of gratitude for Vietnamese hospitality.

 PRC - YUGOSLAVIA
 ?              MAO MEETING HIGHLIGHTS VISIT OF YUGOSLAV DELEGATION
 Peking has given a warm welcome and full honors to an official
 Yugoslav state delegation led by Premier   Bijedf.c that arrived
 in China on 6 October, the highest level official Sino-Yugoslav
 interchange to date.  Initial comment on the visit has demonstrated
 continuing bilateral differences over ideology and on international
 detente, but the main thrust of statemei,ts by both sides has
 stressed their identity of views on defending national independence
 and has testified to good prospects for broadening bilateral
 cooperation.  The visit caps a series of resent Sino--Yugoslav
 military, economic, and scientific e::changes; and the identity of
 the negotiators at the Peki,ig working-level talks suggests that
 agreements in these areas may be forthcoming.
 The Yugoslavs were welcomed at Peking airport by Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-)ing, and met that evening with NPC Chairman Chu Te,
 Teng and other Chinese leaders before a banquet hosted by Teng,
 at which the Chinese vice premier and Yugoslav Premier spoke.
 The full delegation held its first reported working session with
 Chinese counterparts led by Teng on 7 October, and also toured a
 Chinese commune and attended a soiree that day.  On the morning of
 the 8th, Teng was reported meeting alone with Bijedic, and the
 Premier   and the rest of the delegation also met with Mao for a
 "friendly conversation" in a "cordial atmosphere."
 Teng's welcoming speech on the 6th was replete with praise for past
 Yugoslav defense of national sovereignty and continuing vigilance
 against outside adversaries, noting that "any imperialism, if it
 dares to invade Yugoslavia, is bound to suffer a defeat even more
 ignominious than that suffered by old-line fascism."  Teng went on
 to admonish his audience about the danger of superpower war,
 especially in Europe, reiterating the recent Chinese stress against
 the Soviet threat in stating that "the most dangerous source of
 war is the superpower that is more zealous in preaching peace."
 Bijedic declared that bo+.h sides shared in co  on the buildin
 of a "new socialist society in conformity wits our own cond:L tions"-??
 a line carefully avoided in PRC comment, as China still has not
 renounced its past view of Yugoslavia as ideologically "revisionist."
 Bijed=.c also differed with the Chinese in reaffirming Belgrade's
 advocacy of "the policy of detente and negotiation in Europe, 2nd
 in the world at large."
 Teng pointed out that bilateral efforts have given rise to "a good
 development" in Sino-Yugoslav relations in recent years, adding that

 In the economic field" had been achieved and in stating; that the two

 of cooperation.  Neither side specifically referred to  he
 possibility of military cooperation, but a Yugoslav and .1 PRC vice
 chief of staff were noted as attend.Ing the 7 October working talks
 with their economic and foreign policy counterparts.
 Since the normalization of Sino-Yugoslav relations in ,t969, official
 exchanges lravrr increased, reaching a new high over the past year.
 The closer ties were underlined by unprecedented visits in May 1.975
 by a PRC vice chief of staff to Yugoslavia, and in October 1974 by
 a Yugoslav vice chief of staff to China.   Both military delegations
 received warns, high-level treatment, with Vice Chairman Yeh Chien-ying
 receiving the Yugoslav visitors for a "cordial and friendly" talk
 on 26 October.  Other recent bilateral interaction has included the
 November 1974 signing in China of an agreement on scientific and
 technica`.l cooperation, and the visit in September 1974 of a high-level
 Yugoslav parliamentary delegation which was received by Chu To
 and. Teng Hsiao-ping.
 YUGOSLAVIA WELCOMES GROWTH OF STATE RELATIONS WITH PEKING
 While Belgrade comment pegged to the start of Premier Bijedic's
 Peking visit characterized it as opening a "new stage" in state
 relations between the two countries, it was also careful to stress
 that ideological differences between the Yugoslav and Chinese
 communist parties are likely to remain for some time, and one
 Belgrade commentator cautioned that an improvement in relations with
 Peking would not be allowed to jeopardize relations with Moscow.
 Typifying the comment, an article in the 6 October party daily
 POLITIKA, as reported by TANJUG on the 5th, portrayed the first
 Yugoslav head-of-government visit to Peking a; a "culmination
 of a process of normalization of relations" which had begun
 when the two countries resumed diplomatic relations in 1969,
 following an 11-year freeze in state relations.  Similarly, a
 TANJUG commentary, published in the 28 September BORBA, asserted
 that previous lower-level exchanges between the two countries had
 provided a "solid basis" for a "full normalization of inter-itate
 relations" as well as for broader economic cooperation.
 Belgrade also stressed the similarity of the two countries' positions
 on international questions.  A Peking-datelined TANJUG dispatch on
 the 5th, for example, noted their comLLnon stance against "colonialism,
 imperialism and neocolonialism and support for liberation movements."
 Further comparing their foreign policies, the same dispatch asserted

 that "their views on a series of concrete international issues are
 similar in essence and their views on others differ  only slightly."
 tend in a somewhat obscure formulation which could be taken as
 veiled criticism of Moscow, POLITIKA, depicted the "anti-hegemonist"
 positions of Peking and Belgrade as "close . . . despite considerable
 differences."
 Belgrade comment has repeatedly emphasized that the visit is taking
 place exclusively at the "state" level and that continuing ideological
 differences should not hinder the development of governmental ties.
 As if to dispel Soviet concerns that the visit could lead to a
 rapprochement between the two parties, the POLITIKA commentary
 claimed that it had "no ideological implications" and that Bijedic's
 talks "are not even likely to touch on" ideological differences.
 A Zagreb radio commentary by Milika Sundic on the 4th, however,
 evinced some interest in inter-party talks with the Chinese in
 implying that such an initiative from the CCP would be welcomed by
 Belgrade.
 Sundic, who often voices stronger positions on sensitive issues than
 the official party organs, also suggested that Belgrade would not
 develop its relations with Peking at the expense of Moscow.  He
 asserted that Peking's relations with 'Moscow and the other bloc
 countries "must in no way have a negative influence on Yugoslavia's
 cooperation with the European socialist states."  Sundic also
 declared that Belgrade has no intention of involving itself in the
 Sino-Soviet conflict.
