 ETHIOPIA: Mengistu on US Relations
 //Chairman Mengistu of Ethiopia's ruling miZi-
 tary council called in the US charge on Thursday for a long
 discussion on US-Ethiopian relations, including his displeasure
 over the US decision to supply arms to Somalia.  He made his
 points in a more restrained manner than in previous discussions
 and expressed a desire to improve bilateral relations.//
 //Mengistu referred to the close economic and
 defense cooperation between the US and the previous Ethiopian
 government. He complained that the US had not taken foreign
 threats to Ethiopia's security seriously, held up arms deliv-
 eries, misunderstood Ethiopia's revolution, and now is provid-
 ing moral and material support to a country that is committing
 aggression against Ethiopia.//
 //No longer able to rely on the US for arms,
 Mengistu claimed that Ethiopia was forced to seek assistance
 elsewhere, but he said this did not mean that Ethiopia was any-
 body's puppet.//
 //The Ethiopian leader made no new demands dur-
 ing    the-meeting, and voiced his intention to improve bilateral
 relations, even suggesting he might soon appoint an ambassador
 to Washington. He asked the US charge to convey to President
 Carter his appreciation for the President's expressed desire to
 improve relations. As an indication that the door is open for
 further dialogue, Ethiopian media have omitted charges against
 the US--including criticism of the arms supply decision to
 Somalia--for the past several days.

 A US delegation met with Colombian President Lopez
 in Bogota Last month to discuss the problem of narcotics-
 related corruption among Colombian government officials. The
 meeting--which was preceded by a series of discussions, brief-
 ings, and media coverage of drug trafficking in Colombia--is
 another stage in joint US-Colombian drug control efforts.  Po-
 litical constraints, however, probably will Limit Lopez' ef-
 fectiveness in dealing with the drug problem.
 Lopez, who is deeply concerned about the narcotics
 problem, was receptive to an offer by President Carter to pro-
 vide evidence on corruption among Colombian officials charged
 with enforcing narcotics regulations. He was very candid dur-
 ing the meeting. After hearing information implicating various
 high-level officials in the judiciary, the military, and law-
 enforcement agencies, Lopez said he planned to set up an elite
 civilian law-enforcement unit to cope with crime and corruption.

 drug problem would have priority during his final year in of-
 fice, and he said he is considering stationing a narcotics
 liaison officer in Miami to work with the US Drug Enforcement
 Administration.
 I             Lopez'  commitment to improve narcotics enforcement
 may tacilitate certain bilateral drug-control efforts, but a
 direct assault on the problem of corruption, particularly at
 higher levels, is unlikely. Lopez has just weathered a serious
 scandal that threatened his political position, and he may be
 reluctant to risk another public outcry by focusing attention
 on corrupt officials.
 Lopez' ability to address the drug issue is further
 circumscribed by his prospective "lame duck" status after the
 primary election slated for next February. As his authority
 diminishes, he may not be able to pursue many of his plans on
 narcotics control. Even in mid-term, when his political strength
 was presumably at its peak, Lopez seemed unable to deal effec-
 tively with a number of pressing problems.
 The problem of corruption, perhaps the main impedi-
 ment to efforts to resolve Colombia's other ills, is not likely
 to be seriously addressed, much less solved, during Lopez'
 final months in office. At best, Lopez may be able to set some
 machinery in motion that will be continued by his successor.

 CHINA: Industrial Revival Falls Short of Expectations
 I                IDuring the first half of 1977,  China's industry
 has made a respectable recovery from last year's poor perform-
 ance but has fallen short of Peking's expectations.  A critical
 factor in achieving a more rapid recovery will be the ability
 of the central government to restore worker discipline and elicit
 greater effort from its  labor force.  Teng Hsiao-ping's return to
 power may help accomplish this task;   he is regarded as a strong
 administrator who advocates programs favorable to the workers.
 Unless the central government makes good its promise to increase
 wages, however, Chinese labor is likely to be only temporarily
 pacified by Teng's return.
 I             IEarlier this year,  the Chinese media released a
 torrent o  statistics suggesting a rapid revival of industry,
 particularly in those provinces and cities hard hit by the po-
 litical turmoil of last year. Mid-year reports, however, have
 been scant and notably lacking in statistics. The latest round-
 up merely noted that industrial production from January through
 June was "above" the same period in 1976.
 //Peking for the most part has relied on inter-
 provincia  and inter-enterprise emulation campaigns and on strong
 negative measures such as sevFre sanctions aaainst absenteeism
 to promote economic recovery.

 administrator to bring greater unity and a more forceful approach
 to solving the problems of the economy.

 only temporarily. The central government, however, will be

 CANADA: Possible Increase in Gas Exports
 //The Canadian National Energy Board will consider
 favorably requests by domestic producers to increase gas ex-
 ports to the US. This position is contained in the NEB report
 issued last month that supported the construction of the AZcan
 pipeline. It is a reversal of the Board's previous stand and
 reflects he much improved prospect for gas supplies in Alberta.//
 //The NEB envisions two ways to take advantage of
 Alberta's current gas surplus. The first option calls for gas
 exports to be increased over the next several years but offset
 against shipments scheduled after 1984 under existing long-term
 contracts.//
 //The NEB sees several advantages in this option.
 US customers would receive Canadian gas at a critical time, be-
 fore Alaskan North Slope gas reaches the domestic market. The
 additional exports would earn revenue for Canadian producers
 and induce new exploration and development. Canadian consumers
 would benefit because of reduced export commitments after 1984,
 when the Board forecasts a domestic shortfall.//

 //The second option is basically a "loan" arrange-
 ment. It involves increasing exports now on the understanding
 that the gas would be repaid with Alaskan gas at a later date.//
 I                //The NEB, however, notes an obstacle to boosting
 exports--the lack of pipeline capacity. Addressing this prob-
 lem, it suggests building new pipelines in Alberta and
 Saskatchewan to connect with a future pipeline moving Alaskan
 and Mackenzie Delta gas south.//
 I                //The NEB's willingness to consider export in-
 creases reflects the sharply improved gas supply picture in
 Alberta, the leading gas-producing province. The surplus has
 emerged during the last two years because of increased drilling
 and slower-than-anticipated growth in domestic demand. Higher
 domestic and export gas prices and improved return to producers
 prompted the sharp rise in gas drilling.//
 //All interested parties--the NEB, Ottawa, gas
 firms, and Alberta officials--agree there is a gas surplus, but
 its size is a matter of debate. Provincial officials have an
 optimistic view largely because they are being pressed by pro-
 ducers, many of them independent, to find market outlets for
 new supplies. The NEB, however, takes a conservative view. It
 estimates the surplus at about 420 billion cubic feet annually
 this year and next, declining to 300 billion cubic feet annually
 in 1979 and 1980, and disappearing by 1985.//
 //An increase in gas exports would reverse the de-
 cline in Shipments of the last few years. After peaking in 1973
 at 1 trillion cubic feet, exports fell to 959 billion cubic feet
 in 1974 and stabilized at 950 billion cubic feet in 1975 and
 1976. The drop reflected production problems in the British
 Columbia gas fields that supply the US Pacific Northwest. This
 year, exports will probably increase, perhaps to 980 billion
 cubic feet, because of emergency exports early in the year to
 meet abnormal demand caused by the severe winter in the US.//
 //As yet Ottawa has not indicated that it will sup-
 port the NEB's recommendation on exports. Energy Minister
 Gillespie recently suggested that it might be premature to spec-
 ulate on a boost in exports before the matter is discussed by
 the government as part of the debate on an Arctic gas pipeline.//

 //Cabinet deliberations on whether and how to
 offer pipe i.ne negotiations to the US will start today and are
 expected to result in a decision by Monday after preliminary
 consultations with the US.//
 //Several companies, however, are already reacting
 to the NEB's suggestion. Northwest Energy, a US pipeline com-
 pany and a participant in the Alcan consortium, has signed a
 five-year contract with Pan-Alberta Gas for part of the surplus
 with deliveries beginning in 1979. Pan-Alberta also wants to
 extend the domestic pipeline system, which ends at Montreal,
 eastward to supply the Maritime provinces and perhaps the north-
 eastern US.//
 //Trans-Canada Pipelines Ltd., which now transports
 Alberta gas to consumers in eastern Canada and the US, is moving
 ahead with plans to increase exports to the US if Ottawa gives
 the go-ahead.//
 //Ottawa stands to gain in several areas if it
 with the NEB recommendation. Approval would improve
 relations between the federal government and Alberta and could
 open the way for further cooperation on other energy matters.
 Ottawa would have more time in deciding when and how to tap
 Mackenzie Delta reserves for domestic markets, and an increase
 in gas shipments would help Canada's overall export picture.//
 //A favorable decision by Ottawa may also win the
 government of Prime Minister Trudeau some political points in
 Alberta. With national elections scheduled within the next two
 years, the Trudeau government is well aware that it has little
 political strength in Alberta and other western provinces.

 and China under a mixture of barter and hard-currency arrange-
 ments, and these countries are generally free to re-export the
 sugar on world markets. The Cuban position on other matters at
 the London talks, however, was surprisingly constructive.
 Sugar exporters probably are anxious to reach an
 agreement because of the current low sugar prices and because
 Congress is considering a bill that could impose restrictions
 on sugar imports if a satisfactory agreement is not concluded.
