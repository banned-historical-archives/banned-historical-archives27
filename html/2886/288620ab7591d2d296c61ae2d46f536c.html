 Summary
 Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central
 Committee in December 1978, China has been engaged
 in a process of economic readjustment and reform
 that continues today.   Beijing has turned away from
 a philosophy of isolated self-reliancle to one of
 expanding international  involvement.   In the closing
 months of 1984, Beijing continues to 'promulgate new
 policies that will,  if effectively implemented, give
 China a more open economy, with greater flexibility/

 the Economic Structure"     and reports from other authoritative
 sources, China plans to allow production and pricing of many
 commodities according to supply and demands with a limited number

 of goods under loose "guidance" plans and a'~~few key products
 strictly controlled.)                   Beijing also will release control of
 distribution of those goods not controlled by the state, so that
 producers will be responsible for arranging both marketing and
 transport of their goods.   This also allows private transport of
 agricultural goods, which may help alleviate regional shortages
 and surpluses that have characterized China'!'s food distribution
 system.   Beijing also intends to make widerliuse of such economic
 levers as taxes and interest rates to forcehente?rprises toward
 greater efficiency and profitability, although windfall profits
 will  be discouraged by an "adjustment" tax.,  The mechanisms by
 which price and other.financial reforms will be introduced have
 not yet been explained.
 Beijing is clearly sensitive to charges in the foreign press
 that China is "going capitalist."   The announcements of these
 reforms have been carefully crafted to embed structural changes
 within the context of socialism.   The Central Committee Decision,
 for example, stressed that China's productive forces are still
 owned by the people and are therefore socialist, the only
 difference from the past being that it is now "commodity
 socialism."   This is permissible, says the Decision, because the
 state cannot collect, absorb,  and act on the necessary
 information fast enough to run the economy efficiently.   It is
 also notable that most of these reforms have been evolving for
 several years--experiments in selected areas and in agriculture
 began in the late 1970s.   Perhaps the greatest significance of
 the October party conclave is  its endorseme,nt--long sought by the
 reformist leadership--of a comprehensive package of economic
 reforms.   Endorsement does not equate to policy implementation,
 however, and the-task of making the party's+proposals work
 promises to be a difficult one.
 Agriculture--The Centerpiece of China's Economic Reforms
 Reform of China's agricultural production and marketing
 systems began in 1978 and initially focused on increasing
 production.   The reforms were not a wholesale abandonment of
 central government control over China's rural areas.   Rather,
 they were a combination of  (1) better central planning,. (2) a
 cutback in the extent of government intervention in and control
 of routine decisionmaking, and  (3)  improved producer
 incentives.   The main elements of the program involved:
 Prices--Government procurement prices for farm products were
 increased substantially with a round of major price increases in
 1 Among goods that will continue to be Stat'e-controlled are coal,
 crude oil, electricity,  steel, nonferrous metals, timber, cement,
 selected machinery, grain, cotton, pigs, oiIlseeds. synthetic
 fibers, newsprint, cigarettes,  and tobacco.

 1979 followed by smaller increases for selected crops in later
 years.   Because of these changes, the average price paid by the
 government for farm produce has escalated steadily, rising by
 nearly 48 percent between 1978 and 1983.
 Contracting with households--The largest share of production
 activity was turned over by production teams to individual
 households.   Prior to 1978 income was only',weakly tied to
 individual effort because of the egalitarian distribution
 practices of production teams.   Under the household contract
 system now in place, farmers can see 'a direct link between their
 efforts and the income they earn.   This has led to greater work
 effort as well  as to better farm management.
 Reopening free markets--Initial steps'to reform the
 marketing system opened up new distribution channels for
 additional production by farm families.   Between 1978 and 1983
 the government expanded free market trade.   These efforts were
 limited--free market sales were only a small  share of total
 retail  sales in 1983--but they nonethelessimade an important
 contribution to increasing incentives and broadening the scope of
 farm production.
 .Specialization--Restoration and expansion of regional
 specialization were also an important element of policies
 introduced between 1978 and 1983.   Steps to promote
 specialization included encouraging the formation of specialized
 households to concentrate on the production of a single crop or
 product.   These specialized households now"account for at least
 10 percent. of all rural households.   While'some of the increase
 in specialization is the result of greater','freedom of choice for
 farmers, an important part is because of better government
 planning.   The government has readjusted production and
 procurement targets between regions and guaranteed food supplies
 for regions and households that are specializing in production of
 non-food items.
 Production Up Sharply
 China's recent-agricultural performance has given the
 government the peg needed to justify its swing away from orthodox
 Marxist economic practices.   Between 1978 and 1983, the value of
 farm output rose by 46 percent and per capita rural  incomes
 jumped by 121 percent after stagnating for,more than two
 decades.   The total  value of agricultural output jumped 9 percent
 in 1983, more than double the 4-percent goal  set in the annual
 plan.   Grain production--the key indicator''--hit a record 387
 million tons, and"will  likely exceed 400 million tons this
 year.   China credits  its experiment with market-oriented
 practices for the recent agricultural gains,  although better-
 than-average weather conditions and price adjustments also played
 important roles.

 Beijing is also touting the reforms for their impact on
 rural employment.   In pursuit of profits, an increasing number of
 peasants have put down their plows to engage in either commercial
 activities in the service sectors--opening' restaurants, repairing
 shoes and clothing, cutting hair, etc.--or 'Iproduction of
 handicraft  items.  Given the traditional  labor surplus in
 agricultural production, the government hasp welcomed the shift.
 Beijing hopes by the end of the century to,'have about 40 percent
 of its rural  labor force employed in nonagricultural
 production.
 Industrial Performance--A Different Story
 Output Up, Efficiency Down, Problems Mounting
 China's industrial performance, when measured in terms of
 total output, also appeared more than satisfactory.   The total
 value of industrial output rose a sharp 10 percent last year,
 well ahead of-the planned 4-percent growth rate.   But the overall
 output figures belie the fact that, to date,  industrial reform
 has failed to meet its primary goal of increasing efficiency.
 Neither the productivity of labor nor the efficiency with which
 capital  is used have been raised significantly.
 Indeed, both the pace and the direction of industrial growth
 in recent years have been dictated more by the readjustment
 policies of 1979 than by industrial reform.   Like the bulk of
 economic programs instituted prior to 1980,', readjustment
 attempted to change the composition of national  income without
 altering the underlying system of direct central government
 control.   Whereas high rates of investment--especially in heavy
 industry--were favored during most of the previous decade, under
 readjustment Beijing attempted to scale back the rate of
 investment in favor of consumption.   The composition of
 investment was also-altered to benefit light industry.
 The sharp improvement in urban consumer welfare that is now
 apparent in China. is also largely attributable to readjustment,
 not reform.   Although the bonus system that was introduced under
 the reforms put more cash in the hands of consumers,  it was the
 readjustment's emphasis on light industry that began actually
 making consumer goods available.
 The energy sector provided Chinese policymakers with what
 was perhaps the most pleasant surprise of 1983.   Primary energy
 output rose 6.7 percent, the fastest pace in five years.   When
 energy saving measures are included, the gain exceeds 9
 percent.   A new incentive system which allowed producers to
 market above-quota production at higher prices had a major impact
 on the production of coal--China's largest energy source--and
 probably boosted oil output as well.   A newly instituted tax on
 energy consumption probably contributed to energy savings.

 Performance in the transportation sector has been
 satisfactory, given the meager investmentithat Beijing has
 devoted to it over the past few years.   The 7.6-percent increase
 in goods transported last year came mainly from improved
 management of existing facilities.
 The Other Side of Reform--Mounting Problem's
 Progress in furthering reform has been slo.w--in part due to
 a host of problems that emerged or were exacerbated by the new
 policies. In many cases,  the problems wer'~e reflections of
 ideological confrontations between advocates of the rigid
 Maoist   policies prjacticed in China during', 1965-76, and those
 favoring the more market-oriented approach introduced by Deng
 Xiaoping and his colleagues since 1978.
 But economic reforms also were threatened by a series of
 real financial problems that accompanied djecentralization of
 economic decisionmaking.   The fiscally conservative government
 has had to reconcile itself to 5 consecutiye budget deficits
 totalling about 55 billion yuan.   Treasury bonds have been used
 to help finance the deficit without totally resorting to the
 inflationary printing of money; however, Beijing is growing
 increasingly concerned about its ability to balance revenues and
 expenditures.
 On the revenue side, budget shortfalls stemmed in part from
 the decision to hold the line on production of heavy industrial
 goods--the major revenue generator.   When ',heavy industrial output
 levelled-off in 1980 and then declined in '1981, revenues
 suffered.   Beijing's efforts to spark productivity by allowing
 enterprises to retain a significant portion of their profits also
 Even successful agricultural reforms compounded financial
 problems on the expenditure side.   Procurement prices for
 agricultural products were increased sharply beginning in 1979 to
 boost rural  incomes, while consumer prices for those products
 went relatively unchanged.   The result of l,these and other pricing
 problems was a huge gap requiring more than $70 billion in price
 subsidies between 1979 and 1983.   Price subsidies alone took
 nearly one-fourth of total state revenue in 1983.
 The devolution of decisionmaking authority to lower levels
 also threatened to untrack China's high-priority infrastructure
 investment program.   Enter-prise managers, using their new
 authority to make capital  investment decisions,  ignored
 government pleas to hold the line on industrial   investment;
 between 1979 and 1982, extrabudgetary investment in capital
 construction more than doubled.   The increase not only drained
 funds needed to carry out the  infrastructure investment program,
 it also left China short of cement, glass,, and other construction
 supplies needed to upgrade existing facilities and
 infrastruture.   Furthermore, when operational, many of the

 projects absorbed raw materials needed by larger, more efficient
 state-run enterprises.
 Pushing Ahead With Reform--The 1984 Policy;, Shift
 Unwilling to accept continued stagnation, the leadership
 decided to press ahead with its new policies.   In January,
 Beijing issued Central  Document No.  1, a comprehensive summary of
 all the rural reform measures, for study by provincial and local
 leadership.   In April, the State Council  issued new regulations
 lifting--at least for selected enterprises--a cap imposed only a
 year earlier on bonuses.   New regulations also permitted
 factories and commercial enterprises to experiment with new wage
 programs.   In May, the, "Provisional Regulations on Greater
 Freedom for State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" were published,
 permitting enterprises to:
 -- Produce whatever goods are in short supply after
 fulfilling state plans for their normal output.
 -- Set retail prices for industrial machinery and other
 means of production within a range of 20 percent
 around the state price.
 -- Decide what share of their income will go to
 production, expansion, reserv.es, and bonuses.
 -- Lease or rent equipment as  long as proceeds go to
 upgrade existing facilities.
 -- Recruit technical  specialists directly and develop
 pay standards.
 Although many of these measures were little more than
 restatements of policies Beijing had experimented with during the
 previous three years,  they signaled a renewed commitment to
 industrial reform.
 Zhao's government work report at the May session of the
 National People's Congress gave official confirmation to the
 policy shift.   In addition to reviewing and praising various
 foreign and domestic policies, Zhao spoke forcefully and at great
 length on the "urgent" need for urban reform.   Specifically, Zhao
 called for:                                        j;
 -- Implementation of the second stage of China's tax
 reform program to give enterprises even greater
 financial autonomy.
 -- Experimental  restructuring of the managerial system
 in the construction  industry, replacing financial
 appropriations with bank loans, using public bidding
 procedures to issue contracts,~!and revamping the
 material distribution system to alleviate shortages.

 -- Better utilization of educated technicians in
 planning and management of the industrialization
 process.
 -- Reform of the commodity circulation system to
 facilitate the flow of goods between town and
 country,  and the exchange of goods between different
 regions.
 By late June, the China Daily was printing articles
 advocating such market-oriented practices as forcing state banks
 to. compete against each other for deposits Iand loan business and
 allowing domestic enterprises to issue stocks, bonds, and other
 securities.   A Shanghai official at about the same time argued
 that China should expand its financial markets to allow secondary
 trading of enterprise-issued notes.
 Perhaps most notable was the emergence of a host of articles
 advocating an early resolution of the price question.   Prior to
 this time--despite the view widely held byl~Western and Chinese
 economists alike that the entire experiment with market tools
 could not succeed within the framework of China's irrational
 prices--only the most vocal advocates of economic reform had
 suggested moving quickly to tackle the potentially explosive
 issue of price reform.   Ultimately, price reform became one of
 the key features of the October Plenum decision discussed
 above.
 Trade and Investment Ties
 In the international arena, too, China's policies have
 evolved from isolation to involvement.   China's door,  still
 locked tight as recently as nine years ago, has swung wide open
 in recent years,  as thousands of Chinese students have continued
 their studies abroad and foreign investors and technicians have
 been welcomed to China.  'Beijing now has formal  links with such
 international economic institutions as the World Bank,   IMF, and
 the Multi Fiber Arrangement and is moving toward membership in
 the Asian Development Bank and GATT.
 Foreign Investment
 Beijing's past progress  in attracting foreign investment has
 been slow,  in part, because of an uncertain commitment among
 Chinese leaders and planners on the extent' of incentives that
 should be offered to foreign companies.   Other obstacles to
 success  included China's inexperience;  its'need to develop
 credibility in relationships with foreign businessmen;  its lack
 of adequate  infrastructure; problems with labor productivity and
 wages;  and the lack of detailed re ulations on taxes and
 remittances of profits.

 Now China is becoming more active i,n the world economic
 scene, expanding  its trade and investment linkages and
 participating more in international economic organizations.   Its
 higher profile has attracted the interest of foreign firms and
 forced,  albeit very slowly, Chinese accommodations to standard
 international business practices.   We believe a prime area of
 potential trade growth over the next decade will be that evolving
 from direct ties between foreign and Chinese firms, such as joint
 ventures, co-production, and cooperative project development.
 The.se arrangements generate both imports--technology, materials,
 and equipment--and exports.   Much of recent' sustained export
 expansion can indeed be traced to ties with foreign firms,
 particularly compensation trade links established in the late
 1970s.   For example, Chinese pharmaceutical exports have grown
 from $4.7 million in 1979, when several pharmaceutical ventures
 were established, to $25 million in 1983, an average annual
 increase of more than 50 percent.
 Over the past five years the Chinese have undertaken several
 steps to increase foreign participation in their economy through
 trade and investment:
 -- Opened 19 coastal  sites  (14 just this year) to
 foreign investment, offering more liberal business
 terms than offs red elsewhere in China.
 -- Passed laws governing taxation,' liability, patent
 protection, trademarks and investment procedures for
 foreign firms.
 -- Expanded the array of products of joint Chinese-
 foreign firms that may be marketed within China.
 -- Held many investment conferences to publicize
 hundreds of projects for which the Chinese want
 Western technology, equipment, capital, management,
 and marketing.
 -- Negotiated tax,  investment,  and, other cooperation
 accords with several countries to clarify such  issues
 as expropriation policy, arbitration procedures,
 repatriation of profits,  and labor compensation.

 By the end of 1983 there were 1882"equity" and 1,047
 "contractual" joint ventures in China.    In addition there were
 18 cooperative projects for exploration for' and exploitation of
 offshore oil.   We estimate.that at yearend 1983, total paid-in
 foreign investment on these three forms of ?direct investment
 amounted to approximately $1.5 billion.   Of that total about $380
 million is located in the four Special Economic Zones, with the
 bulk in Shenzhen, on the Hong Kong border.; If licensing
 agreements, processing and compensation trade, and wholly-owned
 foreign subsidiaries are included in the totals,  in accord with
 Chinese practice (as -shown in the tabulation below), total paid-
 in foreign investment amounted to $2.3 billion through the end of
 2 From a Western viewpoint, both forms of joint ventures,  as well
 as joint oil exploration agreements and who!',lly-owned foreign
 subsidiaries,  are considered direct foreign' investment.   In our
 balance of payments estimates, other forms of business
 arrangements,  such as licensing, processing'',,  and compensation
 trade agreements,  are not treated as foreign investment since no
 foreign claims on real assets located in China exists.     The
 Chinese, however, use the term "foreign investment" loosely to
 refer to all forms of foreign participation, even including loans
 to Chinese enterprises.   The Chinese.appear'to use the term
 "cooperative production agreement" synonymously with contractual
 joint venture.   From a Chinese legal viewpoint there are three
 chief distinctions between contractual and ;equity joint
 ventures.   Equity joint ventures:
 (1)   fall      under the Joint Venture Tax I;law (a flat 33 percent
 tax), whereas contractual  ventures are taxed on a graduated basis
 under the Foreign Enterprise Income Tax;    "
 (2)   share profits in proportion to equity participation,
 whereas contractual joint ventures share profits according to a
 ratio agreed to in the contract;
 (3)   form new legal entities with their own boards of
 directors, whereas contractual  joint ventures are managed
 directly by their parent corporations.

 US Investment in China
 US firms have established nearly two dozen joint ventures,
 one wholly owned subsidiary,         and countless lcooperative
 arrangements  (licenses, compensation trade,!I assembly or
 processing accords, buy-back deals)  in China since 1979.
 According to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
 Trade, US investment in equity joint ventures was $85-to-90
 million at the end of 1983.           In addition, US firms are involved
 extensively in China's search for offshore oil, with contracts
 costing US companies about $300 million.   Together with
 cooperative arrangements, we estimate that US investment in China
 now totals as much as $500 million dollars.   By contrast,
 Occidental's 1984 contract to develop coal mines at Ping-sue
 will  cost the participating US firms about $350 million.
 Foreign Debt and Finance
 As of June 1984, China had accumulated $16.5 billion in
 foreign exchange reserves.   In addition, the Chinese have used
 very little of the $27 billion in commercial  and government-
 supported credit lines they arranged in 1979 (see table 2).
 Fiscal conservatism and cutbacks in capital expenditures, rather
 than the previous ideological  aversion to foreign debt, have left
 little need for these loans.   Further, Beijing's economic
 development plans are based on the assumption that foreign--and

 uuiir iutrv I i A L
 especially US--firms perceive China as an untapped market with
 great growth potential; by enticing firms to assist Chinese
 enterprises in exchange for products. China hopes to modernize
 its industries at a minimum cost.
 China's current outstanding debt of $5.7 billion is a
 mixture of commercial  and official  loans, with a wide range of
 maturities.   For the past three years commercial borrowing has
 been cut back sharply and it now accounts for less than one-
 fourth of total debt.   China is seeking only concessionary loans
 and will  avoid incurring commercial debt for all but short-term
 trade financing.
 During 1983, Beijing and Tokyo concluded an agreement
 extending $2 billion in Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund loans
 to cover seven major development projects in China.   The loans
 can be drawn over the next five years, carry a 3.5 percent
 interest rate, and allow repayments over 20 years, following a
 10-year grace period.   Earlier this year Tokyo also agreed to
 extend another $2.6 billion in Export-Import Bank resource
 development loans to cover oil  and coal development projects.
 The new loans will carry interest rates of 7.1 to 7.3 percent.
 This compares with the 6.25-percent rate on' a $2 billion line-of-
 credit that Japan Ex-Im provided in 1979.
 The Chinese also obtained $1.9 billion in commitments from
 the World Bank to cover 18 projects, energy, communications,  .
 agriculture, education, and medicine.   Of the total, the IBRD has
 contributed $1.2 billion and the IDA has contributed more than
 $700 million.   Only a small fraction of the loans have been
 drawn.   While these loans might appear,  at;first glance, to
 "crowd out" commercial  lending, this probab'lly is not the case,
 since most of them are for infrastructuralprojects that do not
 provide high or immediate returns and thus ,would not be
 attractive to commercial  lenders.
 We expect China to continue financing '', its development very
 conservatively.   Beijing expects to begin uising its reserves more
 heavily and will  continue to rely on compensation trade
 mechanisms as much as possible to cheaply acquire advanced
 foreign technologies and equipment.   When foreign financing is
 required, we expect Beijing to seek concessionary loans on.the
 basis that China is a poor country and therefore deserves
 preferential treatment.
 Trade Trends
 In the five years from 1979 to 1983, total Chinese two-way
 trade grew at an average annual  rate of nearly 11 percent, while
 US-China trade averaged a robust 17.5 percent per year.   Total
 Chinese exports have led trade expansion with an average annual
 growth of 15 percent.   Expansion of sales to the US doubled that

 pace, however, primarily because of nearly 40 percent average
 annual growth in exports of textiles and apparel.   The United
 States accounts for about 10 percent of China's total trade.
 The transition phase that the Chinese, trade structure is
 undergoing makes estimates of China's trade for the rest of this
 decade difficult.   The key factor that will affect trade is
 China's progress implementing the reforms'' recently introduced or
 currently under consideration.   The decenfraliration of foreign
 trade, opening of domestic markets to joint venture products, and
 other changes could have significant positive impact on total
 trade if the reforms-work as well as those implemented in
 agriculture over the past few years.   Chin,,a's leadership has
 proposed 7-to 8-percent annual growth for the domestic economy
 during the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90) and plans to
 quadruple total trade by the end of the century imply about 8
 percent average annual growth in trade.   If average annual
 increases in actual merchandise trade fall within this 7-to-8
 percent range, then the total would be aboiut $70-75 billion by
 1990.   At least half of that amount would be exports, primarily
 because:
 China strongly wishes to avoid trade deficits;
 Strong export growth of recent"years will moderate as
 international trade protectionism limits primary
 markets for China's  largest export products.
 Beijing could reduce imports if necessary to maintain
 balanced trade.
 We believe these totals are conservative estimates of trade
 growth, however, and that the actual  levels of trade would rise
 further if reforms are successfully implemented.
 Nonetheless, based on these projections and assuming the
 United States continues to account for 10 to 12 percent of
 China's total trade, then US-China trade by 1990 would reach $7-9
 billion.   Because China is trying to reduce its dependence on
 OECD markets and because we expect export growth to moderate, we
 estimate that China's exports to the United States will remain at
 a level that averages 10 percent of total exports (about the same
 share as 1982-83); that would amount to $4-4.5 billion by 1990.
 Similarly, with China seeking alternative suppliers, we expect
 the US share of total  imports to fall far below the 20 percent
 level  of 1981 and perhaps to approximate the 12 percent level of
 1983, which would mean $3.3-3.6 billion in Chinese imports from
 Outlook for China's Imports
 China's interests in industrial advancement and export
 development will stimulate new import patterns.   During the next
 few years we expect capital goods and software--designs,

 blueprints, training--to constitute a greater share of Chinese
 imports, while the share taken by agricultural products ebbs.
 Software fees are not itemized in trade statistics, but we
 estimate that expenditures for software exceeded $2 billion last
 year.
 China has more than 300,000 industrial enterprises that need
 at least some capital  improvements and massive infrastructural
 development.   More than $16 billion in foreign exchange reserves
 and, additional billions in untapped foreign loans have long
 suggested an imminent groundswell  in capital  imports.   However,
 Beijing is wary of another massive surge in plant and equipment
 purchases like the 1.978 binge that led to contract cancellations
 and embarrassment.   Thus emphasis for the rest of this decade
 will  be on projects to upgrade existing factories, especially
 with foreign investment and advice or under the auspices of
 Western assistance programs.   China significantly stepped up
 imports of industri-al supplies and capital  goods in 1983 and we
 expect imports to further accelerate this year, perhaps by 25 to
 30 percent, then to moderate in the last half of the decade.
 Import gains can be expected in such industrial materials as
 lumber,  nonferrous metals, fertilizers.,  and plastics.   Among
 capital goods, products for the transportation and energy sectors
 will  lead import growth,  particularly aircraft, trucks,
 locomotives, power plant equipment, oil drilling gear and mining
 equipment.   China will also continue to seek out used plants and
 equipment such as the Kai               ant being relocated to
 Beijing from California.
 Other categories with significant potential for US exports
 to China are high technology and weaponry.   China prefers to
 acquire manufacturing capabilities in these sectors and is
 subject to export controls on certain technologies.   Prospects of
 prolonged negotiations and approval processes dictate against
 substantial  increments in the value of US-China merchandise trade
 from these sectors during the rest of the 1980s.
 Favorable weather patterns have led to four consecutive
 years of bumper harvests, reducing the overall need for imports
 of agricultural commodities." Furthermore, the Chinese are
 reducing acreage sown to foodgrains in order to increase the
 output of such commercial crops as cotton,  soybeans,  and
 oilseeds.   These adjustments are having a major impact on China's
 agricultural trade.   Last year, for example, China cut back
 substantially on cotton imports and actually began exporting raw
 cotton for the first,time.
 Prospects for China's Exports
 China's early forays into export expansion have focused on
 improving, packaging,  and marketing traditional  light industrial
 products.   Early 1984 trade statistics suggest a growing export
 capability in such product groups as toys, collectibles  (coins,
 antiques), housewares  (wicker, china, plasticware), processed

 foods, and chemicals.   The Chinese, especially through joint
 foreign-Chinese firms,  are actively searching for additional
 marketing opportunities.
 Certain agricultural products may offer export
 opportunities.   If Chinese exporters can meet international
 quality and other standards, then within the next few years China
 could emerge as an important exporter of raw cotton,  and could
 increasingly compete with US suppliers of cotton.,  soybeans,  and
 corn to Japan and other major Far Eastern markets.   However, we
 believe that, together with fluctuations in future weather-
 related growing conditions, the needs of China's growing
 population will work, against large-volume exports of unprocessed
 China's long term economic plans apparently include
 substantial growth in machinery and equipment exports as well.
 Beijing already exports such machinery as basic machine tools and
 small hydropower generators.   Various ministries, corporations,
 factories, and provinces have developed atl;least tentative plans
 to upgrade their manufacturing facilities and to improve output
 quality in order to become competitive within the next five to 15
 years in such diverse products as machine tools,  chemicals,  and
 process controls.   China is pushing electronics development in
 particular, driving to double by 1990 the output of
 semiconductors, communications equipment, computers, and consumer
 electronics for. both domestic use ;and export.
 We believe the Chinese will not be able to absorb
 technologies fast enough for finished manufactures to become a
 significant share of exports within the next decade.   China's
 ability to absorb technologies has been circumscribed by such
 factors as a shortage of skilled personnel,' lack of incentives
 for plant officials and, planners,  and poor !planning and
 prioritization.   We believe that Chinese industries will progress
 technologically, but their average technical  level will continue
 to lag that of the developed world.
 It is likely, however, that China will substantially expand
 component assembly operations under the auspices of Western
 firms.   Machine tool  sales probably will increase,  particularly
 those tools that are of relatively uncomplicated designs and
 require predominantly hand machining and assembly.   Exports of
 such small manufactures as hand tools,  spade parts, and
 industrial fasteners also are likely to show rapid growth.   Some
 of these products could displace the sales iof US firms, but no
 more so than similar exports already    minqll~ from Pakistan,
