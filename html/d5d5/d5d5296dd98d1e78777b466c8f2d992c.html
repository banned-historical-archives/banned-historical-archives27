 Continued postponement of the UN General Assembly's

 UN withdrawal resolutions underscores the divisive effect
 this issue has had on the UN as a whole and on its member
 governments individually.    While most UN members agree
 that Israel should comply with the assembly's directives,
 there is wide disagreement over the extent to which
 Israel's demands for guarantees should be taken into

 Indonesian political leaders are being subjected to
 an intimidation campaign by both President Sukarno and
 the Communists, and their reluctance to accept Sukarno's
 plans for Communist participation in the government may
 lead to extensive arrests and a declaration of a state of
 siege.  The president's vigorous advocacy of his new con-
 cept of government is being enthusiastically endorsed by
 Indonesian Communists in mass meetings and by mob dem-
 onstrations.   Indonesian'. army officers are ',. probably divided
 on Sukarno's plans, but if the president makes use of a
 recently organized association of enlisted men'.and non-

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 BRITISH OFFICIALS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT KUWAIT .  .                          .  .  .  .  .     Page 1
 British officials fear a nationalist upheaval may
 be approaching in Kuwait, which supplies over 60 percent
 of Britain's crude oil requirements.   London's present
 course apparently is to avoid innovations in policy for
 fear of deepening Arab suspicions of British intentions.
 Meanwhile, British oil interests are going ahead with
 plans to extend their operations.
 With the UN General Assembly's adoption of a res-
 olution on Cyprus acceptable to Greece, the Karamanlis
 government seems likely to weather the crisis over the
 island.  Britain is willing to let the North Atlantic
 Council discuss the problem; Greece has already indicated
 qualified approval of such a course, and Turkey will

 The new government named by Polish premier Cyrankie-

 an important victory for Gomulka in his efforts to stamp
 out the Stalinist opposition.     Most of the pro-Stalin
 Natolin group have been removed from the cabinet and the
 Council of State, and greater powers have been vested
 in the new liberal parliament.

 Despite an initial wave of labor unrest in late
 December, Bolivia's economic stabilization program appears
 to be succeeding.   The program,which is backed by the
 United States and the International Monetary Fund, faces
 the possibility of new labor unrest, however, which may

 Peiping's efforts to expand its sphere of influence

 Development grants were given last year to Cambodia and

 Communist China is making certain modifications in

 the Communists came to power, agricultural production is
 to increase more rapidly than industrial production.
 The scheduled increase in industrial output is to be
 only 6 percent, considerably below the 17-percent average
 annual increase achieved during the first four years of

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 United Nations
 Continued postponement of
 the UN General Assembly's de-
 bate on sanctions against Is-
 rael for noncompliance with
 UN withdrawal resolutions under-
 scores the divisive effect
 this issue has had on the UN
 as a whole and on its member
 governments individually.
 While most UN members agree
 that Israel should comply
 with the assembly's directives,
 there is wide disagreement over
 the extent to which Israel's
 demands for guarantees should
 be taken into account before
 any sanctions move is under-
 taken.
 Ath Thamad-
 .   Even the legality of a
 General Assembly call for
 sanctions has been questioned
 by some members, who point out
 that under the terms of the
 charter, only the Security
 Council has the authority to
 impose sanctions.   There is
 also a growing concern that
 a General Assembly recommenda-
 tion for sanctions might be
 ignored by many prominent and
 influential members,. thereby
 further weakening the UN's ef-
 fectiveness.   Therefore, most
 UN members have gone along with
 continued postponements in the
 hope that private negotiations
 with Israel by the US and the
 UN secretary general. would lead
 to some agreement which could
 be used to.avoid a showdown.
 Cairo Meeting
 The Israeli withdrawal
 issue, and the American atti-
 tude toward it, were the domi-
 nant themes of the Arab "summit"
 meeting in Cairo.   Nasr re-
 portedly pressed Saud hard on
 these questions, and a bitter
 debate took place over Saud's
 desire that the conferees in-
 dicate their appreciation of
 the American policy stand on
 Arab problems.   At one point
 Saud is said to have threatened
 to walk out of the conference.
 Saud apparently gave way
 in the end, however, since the
 communique issued on 27 February
 gives first place to his report
 on his American talks,. but
 leaves approval of the American
 position to be inferred.   More-
 over, this portion of the com
 munique is balanced by a clear,

 Syria
 There were a few indica-
 tions last week that Saud's
 antileftist  attitude might
 also be having some effect in
 Syria.  The American embassy
 in Damascus noted reports that
 President Quwatli was co-operat-
 ing with Khalid al-Azm, formerly
 a leading proponent of leftist
 influence, and an able con-
 servative, Mahmud Kuzbari, with
 a view to replacing the Asali
 cabinet with a more pro-Western
 one.
 However, Syrian army G-2
 chief Colonel Sarraj, who still
 appears to be the dominant
 figure in Syrian politics, re-
 vealed himself to be more bit-
 terly anti-Western than pre-
 viously in a talk with the
 American army attache during
 a Soviet embassy reception.
 Sarraj said that since the
 Western press was accusing him
 of being a Communist, he might
 as well become one, and cited
 the Soviet Union as Syria's
 friend.   When the presence of
 over 40 Soviet bloc nondiplo-
 matic personnel--probably mili-
 tary officers in civilian
 clothes--was pointed out to
 him,  Sarraj remarked, "They
 are nothing; I can use them
 but they cannot use me."
 Meanwhile, new Soviet
 equipment continues to arrive
 in Syria.   Trucks, ambulances
 and cranes of Soviet origin
 were observed entering the
 Damascus area on 24 February,
 and the American military at-
 tache there believes additional
 shipments have arrived at
 Latakia.
 Syrian-Lebanese relations,
 which had been strained even
 more than usual following the
 assassination in Beirut on 19
 February of Ghassan Jadid, a
 leader of the rightist Syrian
 Social National Party, have
 eased slightly.   However, the
 death sentences pronounced by
 the Syrian army court last
 week against persons accused
 last fall of conspiring with
 Iraq to overthrow the govern-
 ment may lead to new tensions,
 since several of the accused
 had sought refuge in Lebanon
 and the Lebanese authorities
 have previously refused to
 extradite them.
 In Jordan, the struggle
 between King Hussain and the
 left-wing cabinet of Prime
 Minister Nabulsi abated some-
 what pending the outcome of the
 Arab leaders' conference 'in
 Cairo, in which Hussain hoped
 to have his position supported
 by King Saud.  Meanwhile, the
 factions appear to be crystal-
 lining.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 Termination of Britain's
 obligation to defend Jordan,
 and Israel's long-standing
 interest in establishing its
 frontier on the militarily
 defensible line of the Jordan
 River, have revived rumors of
 schemes for an impending
 partition of Jordan.
 President Sukarno,  con-
 fronted with mixed reactions
 from political leaders to his
 plan for Communist participa-
 tion in a reorganized Indone-
 sian government, must now de-
 cide whether to ignore the
 views of the opposition or at-
 tempt some compromise.   He
 told a mass rally on 28 Febru-
 ary that the "fate" of his plan
 will be decided in the "not-
 too-distant future" after he
 had considered various view-
 points.
 At the rally,. organized by
 the Communists outside the
 presidential palace on 28
 February, Communist Party
 spokesmen enthusiastically en-
 dorsed Sukarno's plan, and the
 National Party has indicated
 its views are close to those
 of Sukarno.   Moslem and Chris-
 tian parties are, in varying
 degrees, opposed.   The Masjumi
 party chairman was shouted off
 the speakers' platform when
 he asked for "another way out"
 of the republic's pressing
 political problems.
 Sukarno has spent the past
 week urging the acceptance of
 his maximum demands--the estab-
 lishment of an appointed "ad-
 visory council" and the partici-
 pation of Communists in both
 the council and a new cabinet.
 In his determination to force
 his concept on the nation, he
 reportedly is considering ar-
 resting political leaders who
 remain adamant in their op-
 position.   He also may declare
 martial law throughout the
 country.
 In stimulating mass sup-
 port and intimidating his op-
 position, Sukarno has had the
 assistance of a massive Com-
 munist campaign which has all
 the signs of careful organiza-
 tion and ample financing.
 Sukarno has welcomed this Com-
 munist support, and has re-
 garded Communist-organized
 demonstrations as evidence of
 popular acceptance of his con-
 cept.   He has not intervened
 to discourage Communist ex-
 cesses, which include defacing
 of American property,  and only
 a few official efforts to con-
 trol the campaign have been
 reported.
 The Indonesian army, for-
 merly a strong anti-Communist
 force, is probably divided on
 Sukarno's plans.   As the re-
 sult of a thorough reorganiza-
 tion, a significant percentage
 of the officer corps is amen-
 able to the policies of Sukarno
 and the National Party.   There
 are strong indications that
 Sukarno will attempt to bypass
 the officers and coerce them,
 if necessary, with an organiza-
 tion established in 1956,  the
 "Noncoms' and Privates' Associa-
 tion."                                                       The association strong-
 ly favors Sukarno and reported-
 ly is heavily infiltrated by
 Communists.

 Sukarno's insistence on
 Communist participation in a
 new government stems in part
 from his admiration of the ef-
 ficiency of the Communist sys-
 tem of government he observed
 on recent tours of the USSR
 and Communist China.   Sukarno
 sees in autocratic aspects of

 those Communist regimes a pos-
 sible solution to the political
 and economic disintegration
 facing his country.  His pro-
 posed advisory council would
 be in a sense a "Communist
 politburo" sunerimnosed on the
 cabinet.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 BRITISH OFFICIALS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT KUWAIT
 British officials fear a
 nationalist upheaval may be ap-
 proaching in Kuwait,                             which nor-
 mally supplies over 60 percent
 of Britain's crude oil require-
 ments.   Pending more study of
 the situation,  London's course
 apparently is to avoid innova-
 tions in policy for fear of
 deepening Arab suspicions of
 British intentions.
 British planning for fur-
 ther development of Kuwait's
 oil industry is going ahead.
 Work is proceeding to complete
 a 160,000-barrel--per-day re-
 finery this year.   British and
 American oil interests are al-
 so considering a pipeline from
 Iraq's southern fields into
 Kuwait,  or,  as an alternative,
 piping Kuwaiti oil to the
 Mediterranean by connecting
 Kuwait to existing lines across
 Iraq and Syria.

 At the same time,  British
 officials display concern that
 the political situation at Kuwait
 is increasingly unfavorable to
 Western oil interests.   The
 British ambassador to Iran vis-
 ited the Persian Gulf area in
 January and was particularly
 impressed by growing Arab na-
 tionalism at Kuwait.   One of
 his staff told the American em-
 bassy in Tehran that it is ob-
 vious the present "rather com-
 fortable" status cannot last
 much longer.   The British am-
 bassador himself feels it is
 only a question of time before
 the present paternalistic polit-
 ical system in Kuwait "blows up."
 Presumably as a result of dis-
 turbing signs of unrest in the
 Persian Gulf,  the head of the
 Eastern Department of the Foreign
 Office is presently touring the
 area.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 officials in Kuwait have lost
 their influence with national-
 ist groups and are now forced
 to rely exclusively on the
 UN CYPRUS RESOLUTION EASES TENSIONS
 With the UN General As-
 sembly's adoption of a sub-
 stantive resolution on Cyprus
 acceptable to Greece, the Kara-
 manlis government seems likely
 to weather the crisis over the
 island.   The prime minister
 expects to win a parliamentary
 vote of confidence when the
 Chamber of Deputies reconvenes
 on 5 March.
 The General Assembly res-
 olution, adopted on 26 Febru-
 ary,  expresses the hope that
 negotiations will be resumed
 toward "a peaceful,  democratic
 and just" solution of the
 Cyprus issue in accordance
 with the principles of the UN
 charter.   Mention of the char-
 ter, which specifically en-
 dorses the principle of self-
 determination, was particular-
 ly important to Greece.   The
 Greeks have interpreted the
 resolution as calling for re-
 newed negotiations between the
 British and Archbishop Makarios.
 However,  the British and the
 Turks claim the resolution
 ruler and his tributary sheiks 25X11
 in charge of government adminis-
 tration.   The ruler has dismissed
 many of his British advisers in
 the past three months and
 recently became less accessible
 to those remaining.
 envisages tripartite negotia-
 tions,  and the British will not
 consider negotiating again with
 Makarios.
 Britain will not modify
 its Cyprus policy but is will-
 ing to have the Cyprus dispute
 discussed by the North Atlantic
 Council, provided the terms of
 reference do not "permit NATO
 to move too far into substance."
 Greece has already indicated
 qualified approval of recourse
 to NATO,  and Turkey is not
 likely to object if British
 conditions are met.
 EOKA,  the Greek-Cypriot
 underground,  apparently has
 been severely weakened in:the
 past few weeks.   It announced
 through leaflets on 25 February
 that it would continue to fight
 "until our aim is achieved,"
 but its activities are likely
 to be increasingly circumscribed
 by British security forces and
 a probable gradual lessening of
 local support for its violent
 methods.
 MOROCCAN AND TUNISIAN RELATIONS WITH FRANCE
 New frictions in Moroccan
 -French relations overshadow
 recent progress in resolving
 some of France's minor prob-
 lems in Morocco and Tunisia.
 The two major problems--the
 support by Morocco and Tunisia

 credits of more than $20,000,-
 000 were released to Morocco
 last December.   Moroccan sup-
 port in the United Nations for
 Algerian independence drew a
 sharp French protest and threat
 to cut off further financial
 aid.   Tangible support for the
 Algerian rebels--aid in the
 procurement of arms and logis-
 tics and rehabilitation facil-
 ities--continues.
 Paris is irritated by a
 provision of the Moroccan dip-
 lomatic convention with Spain
 of 11 February permitting Spain
 to represent Morocco in Latin
 America where Rabat does not
 maintain diplomatic representa-
 tives.   This provision is not
 technically in conflict with
 the Moroccan-French diplomatic
 convention of last June, but
 Paris considers that France
 should perform such services
 for the Moroccans in all areas
 where Rabat does not have its
 own missions.   The Rabat govern-
 ment flatly rejected on 23 Feb-
 ruary a French protest against
 Morocco's use of Spanish dip-
 lomatic services.
 Demands by the principal
 Moroccan political party,
 Istiglal,  for the incorpora-
 tion of Mauritania into Moroc-
 co and Moroccan help to Mauri-
 tanian exiles have also in-
 creased friction.   Moreover,
 recent engagements between
 French West African military
 units and alleged bands of
 the former Moroccan army of
 liberation--considered as di-
 versionary operations to re-
 lieve the hard-pressed Alge-
 ria.n. rebels--caused a second
 French protest on 23 February
 accompanied by a hint that
 the French army might "inter-
 vene."   Morocco in reply de-
 manded early negotiation of
 border problems and the status
 of French forces in Morocco.
 The American embassy in
 Rabat considers that a poten-
 tially dangerous situation exists
 which could lead to an open
 clash between the French army
 on the one hand and the Moroc-
 can sultan, government, and
 people on the other.
 Despite some progress made
 in resolving minor French-Tuni-
 Sian problems during the.recent
 visit to Tunis of French under
 secretary of state Maurice
 Faure,  Tunisian premier Bour
 ghiba was said to be in "his

 eral engagements between the
 rebels and French military
 units have occurred on Tunisian
 soil.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 THE NEW POLISH GOVERNMENT
 The new government named
 by Polish premier Cyrankiewicz,
 and approved on 26 February by
 the Sejm (parliament), r pre-
 sents an important victory for
 Gomulka in his efforts to stamp
 out his Stalinist opposition.
 Most of the pro-Stalin Natolin
 group have now been removed
 from the cabinet and the Coun-
 cil of State, and greater
 powers have been vested in the
 new liberal Sejm.
 The number of ministries
 has been reduced from 31 to 25,
 in line with the program of
 streamlining the government ap-
 paratus which Gomulka has pur-
 sued since he came to power in
 October.  The merging and abo-
 lition of various ministries
 made possible the removal of
 several members of the cabinet,
 including communal economy
 minister Mijal, and chemical
 industry minister Ruminski,
 both members of the Natolin
 group.  The only important
 Stalinist remaining in the cabi-
 net is Deputy Premier Zenon
 Nowak, who has been retained
 as one of three deputy premiers,
 a position of little real au-
 thority, probably as a sop to
 the Stalinist factions.
 The new Council of State
 is composed of a group of per-
 sons who are mostly liberal
 minded supporters of Gomulka,
 who himself,  is a member.  The
 retention of Aleksander Zawadzki
 as chairman of the council,
 thus titular chief of state
 of Poland, is probably in ex-
 change for his support of
 Gomulka's liberal program.
 While formerly chairman of
 the Polish trade unions,
 Zawadzki was known as a per-
 son completely loyal to Moscow.
 The personnel changes
 strengthen Gomulka's in-
 ternal political position,
 and he will probably attempt
 to consolidate his gains
 by making the government
 more independent of the party,
 which still contains many
 Stalinist elements opposed
 to his program.
 Gomulka will permit the
 Sejm to exercise increased
 authority through greater
 participation in governmental
 affairs, thus broadening the
 base of political support
 in the fulfillment of his
 liberal aims.
 The meeting of the Demo-
 cratic Socialist Party  direc-
 torate on 23 February adopted
 a wait-and-see policy on So-
 cialist reunification, making
 it conditional on the future
 performance of the Nenni So-
 cialists with regard to foreign
 policy and relations with the
 Communists.  The meeting did,
 however, interpret the recent
 Venice congress of the Nenni
 party as a further move toward
 eventual reunification, and took
 no steps to block the growing
 co-operation between the two
 parties at the local level.
 Democratic Socialist Party
 officials are apprehensive lest
 Nenni's failure to win a major-
 ity of the votes for his party's
 central committee means that,
 in spite of the nearly unanimous
 endorsement of reunification
 and independence from the Com-
 munists he received at the
 Venice meeting, he will have
 difficulties pulling a united
 party away from Communist

 influence.   While they passed
 a motion characterizing the
 Venice congress as "a step for-
 ward on the road to integra-
 tion," they apparently intend
 to watch the parliamentary vot-
 ing of Nenni's party on spe-
 cific issues.   In the Italian
 Senate on 20 February, the Nen-
 ni Socialists abstained on a
 government motion favoring
 EURATOM, thus leaving the Com-
 munists isolated in opposition,
 Democratic Socialist chief
 Saragat complained to American
 embassy officials before the
 directorate meeting that he
 was under strong pressure from
 those in his own party and with-
 in the Socialist International
 who favor reunification.   Such
 pressure is likely to continue
 in view of the critical line
 against the Communists and the
 objective tone on Western Euro-
 pean integration being taken by
 Nenni and his party organ Avanti
 The American embassy also re
 ports a tendency on the part of
 reunion protagonists to believe
 that Nenni can control his op-
 position in the Socialist Party.
 The Democratic Socialist
 decision to move slowly on re-
 unification appeared to have re-
 moved the immediate threat that
 the party might withdraw from
 the government coalition.   A
 subsequent parliamentary move
 against the coalition by an-
 other party, however, has
 created a new pressure for a
 political realignment which may
 give a further push to Socialist
 reunification,  On 25 February
 the small Republican Party--
 which is not represented in
 the cabinet but has formed part
 of the government's 16-vote
 majority--announced that Premier
 Segni can no longer count on
 its support.   One faction
 of the party is already urg-
 ing an alliance with the two
 Socialist parties, and if the
 Republican Party as a whole
 should force a showdown with
 Premier Segni, this would prob-
 ably accelerate moves for a
 realignment of the left-center.
 Heinrich von Brentano,
 West Germany's foreign minister
 and the cabinet member who ap-
 pears most likely to become
 Chancellor Adenauer's eventual
 successor,  is to arrive in
 Washington on 3 March for a
 one-week official visit.
 Brentano was originally to
 have accompanied the Federal
 Republic's president, Theodor
 Heuss, but the 73-year-old
 Heuss has had to postpone his
 visit, citing illness.
 Besides exploring views
 of American officials on Euro-
 pean problems and helping lay
 the groundwork for the chan-
 cellor's expected visit in
 late May, Brentano will probably
 use his trip as another op-
 portunity to remind the German
 public of the coalition govern-
 ment's good ties with the
 United States, especially in the
 wake of the early February visit
 of Erich Ollenhauer, leader of
 the opposition Social Democrats
 (SPD),   Following his American
 stay, Brentano will leave from
 San Francisco for official
 visits to Australia and then
 India.
 The 52-year-old native of
 Hesse and a bachelor of a well-
 to-do family and conservative
 background, Brentano is a long-
 time member of the Christian
 Democratic Party (CDU).  He
 came to his present post after

 Eckhardt,  who sometimes use
 their close relationships with
 the chancellor to meddle in
 foreign affairs.   On the other
 hand,  Brentano's standing with
 the opposition SPD is relatively
 good; he has been receptive to
 a "grand coalition" of the CDU
 and SPD,  if election results
 should make such a solution nec-
 essary,  a concept Adenauer has
 always flatly rejected.   If SPD
 gains in the upcoming Bundestag
 elections make such a coalition
 practical,  the SPD is likely to
 consider Brentano the most ac-
 ceptable of CDU candidates for
 chancellor.
 THE NEW SPANISH CABINET
 The new Spanish cabinet,
 announced on 25 February,  pre-
 sents a change in faces rather
 than in basic policies, with
 about the same balance between
 the Falange on the one hand
 and the military,  monarchists,
 and church interests on the

 Foreign Affairs and Commerce
 Ministries,  together with the
 inclusion of at least one fig-

 seem to foreshadow somewhat

 reluctance to reduce the govern-

 in July 1951, which was like-
 wise preceded by a period of
 intensified criticism of the
 regime expressed in part through
 extensive transportation boy-
 cotts in major cities.
 The Falange continues
 strongly represented, despite
 the shift to a less important
 post of Jose-Luis Arrese,  the
 sponsor of the controversial
 laws which would have greatly
 strengthened the organization's
 constitutional position.   The
 new labor minister is again a
 Falangist with a strong labor
 following, thus indicating
 Franco's continued backing of
 the Falange's campaign to win
 broad support among the workers.
 By way of compensation to
 the military,  Franco has not
 only left them the three serv-
 ice  ministries but given them
 the Interior and Public Works
 Ministries as well.   This army
 control over the police also
 suggests a concern for public
 security in the event of fur-
 ther student and worker unrest.
 Since the military are almost
 entirely monarchist in sympathy,
 the monarchists--who retain the
 Justice and Industry Ministries--
 are probably reasonably well
 satisfied also.
 The replacement of the mod-
 erate Catholic and pro-American
 foreign minister,  Martin Artajo,
 by Fernando Maria Castiella
 would not seem encouraging,  ac-
 cording to Ambassador Lodge in
 Madrid.   Castiella,  a Falangist
 who served in the Blue Division
 on Germany's eastern front in
 World War II,  became ambassador
 to the Vatican in 1951 when
 Britain refused to accept him
 as ambassador because of his
 extreme anti-British and general-
 ly anti-Western attitude.
 The replacement of Commerce
 Minister Arburua by Alberto Ul-
 lastres   raises doubts as to the
 new cabinet's economic policies,
 The previous cabinet had strong-
 ly objected to Arburua's pro-
 posals for an austerity program
 to meet the inflationary threat,
 and Ullastres,  despite his rep-
 utation as an orthodox economist,
 is likely to be similarly blocked
 by strong Falangist pressure for
 increased welfare benefits and
 by the retention in the cabinet
 of Industry Minister Planell,
 who is reputed to be a "big
 spender."  The appointee to the
 new post for economic planning--
 which is to have no staff--is 71
 years old and politically in-
 experienced.   He seems unlikely
 to be able to exercise any real
 restraint on deficit soending

 urgent need for consolidation

 supported his predecessor's

 that it was in Japan's "ulti-
 mate" interest to co-operate
 with the United States in in-
 ternational relations,  thereby
 reaffirming the assurances he
 has frequently given American
 officials of his friendliness
 toward American interests. At
 the same time, however, Kishi
 feels that Japan must achieve
 a more independent position
 within the relationship.
 Kishi may seek a revision
 of the security treaty to lim-
 it  American bases and rights
 in Japan, as well as agree-
 ment on a specific date for
 the withdrawal of all American
 ground forces.   In recent Diet
 debate,  the new prime minister
 appears to have committed the
 government to oppose any
 American request to introduce
 nuclear weapons or atomic task
 forces into Japan.   An advo-
 cate of rearmament, however,
 he favors strengthening Japan's
 defenses before American forces
 are withdrawn.
 Kishi.has.what most.Japa-
 nese regard as a realistic
 attitude toward relations with
 the Communist bloc.   He would
 limit them,  however, so that
 they do not jeopardize relations
 with the free world.   He ad-
 mittedly favors the "two
 Chinas" solution for relations
 with Peiping.   For the time
 being, he advocates an expan-
 sion of economic relations with
 Communist China by what he
 calls a "rationalization" of
 the embargo on strategic trade,
 and has predicated Japanese
 recognition of Peiping on the
 regime's acceptance by the UN.
 Kishi is aware of the develop-
 ing internal Communist threat
 and is likely to take measures
 to cope with it.

 GOLD COAST INDEPENDENCE
 On 6 March the Gold Coast
 will become independent and,
 as Ghana, take its place in the
 British Commonwealth.   Britain's
 rapid progress in training the
 Gold Coast nationalists in ad-
 ministrative practices has
 created deep distrust between
 traditional chiefs and modern
 politicians, but Prime Minister
 Nkrumah is supported by a large
 majority of the Gold Coast
 people.  The participation of
 Communist nations in the in-
 dependence celebrations will
 give them an opportunity to
 press for diplomatic relations
 Britain is leav-
 ing the Gold Coast
 after more than 100
 years of rule.   Since
 the exit has not been
 forced, the national-
 ists are   friendly
 toward London and
 have decided to join
 the Commonwealth.
 The Accra government
 still lacks many of
 the qualities of
 Western democracy,
 but London hopes it
 has taught the people
 sufficient respect
 for democratic pro-
 cedures to ensure
 that they will avoid
 the graft and cor-
 ruption found else-
 where in Africa.
 The traditional
 chiefs of the hinter-
 land have demanded
 that the socialist
 Convention People's
 Party of Prime Minis-
 ter Nkrumah   give
 them constitutional
 guarantees of federalism to pro-
 tect their regional powers and
 tribal institutions.   When their
 appeals to London were unsympa-
 thetically received in 1956,
 the leaders resorted to threat
 of secession and civil war.
 In January, discussions be-
 tween Gold Coast leaders and
 British officials resulted in
 a compromise Whereby the new
 Ghana constitution will provide
 for regional assemblies with
 important powers.   The consent
 of these assemblies is necessary
 for a constitutional revision
 and any change in the authority
 of the chiefs.   While the Gold
 Coast government accepted these
 terms and the tension eased, an
 independent Ghana government
 may not observe them for long.
 The Accra government, act-
 ing largely through British
 diplomatic contacts, has invited
 almost all nations to the inde-
 pendence celebrations.  Among
 the Communist nations, the So-
 viet Union is to be represented
 by Minister of State Farms I. A.

 shchev, and Communist China by

 BOLIVIAN STABILIZATION PROGRAM STIRS LABOR UNREST
 Bolivia's spiraling infla-
 tion appears to have been halted
 by the sweeping economic sta-
 bilization program begun in mid-
 December.                           Resulting labor un-
 rest, which at one point brought
 BoliVia's president to the verge
 of  resigning, again  threatens
 the whole program with crippling
 strikes and riots--possibly as
 early as: March.
 The stabilization program,
 begun with a $25,000,000 fund
 put up by the United States and
 the International Monetary Fund,
 has made a good showing in its
 first two months.  The initially
 high prices resulting from the
 abolition of controls have begun
 to recede slowly.  The govern-
 ment's cumulative dollar losses
 from the beginning of the pro-
 gram to 23 February were only
 $1,161,000 as compared to the
 high of $2,100,000 reached on
 29 January.  A second American
 investment in Bolivian petroleum
 development and nearly completed
 negotiations for new foreign in-
 vestment in zinc mining indicate
 foreign business confidence in
 the stabilization program.
 Progress in stabilization
 thus far can be attributed in
 large part to the government's
 success in controlling labor
 unrest, particularly at the
 mines, which produce over 90 per-
 cent of Bolivia's exports.  On
 17 February, however, Juan
 Lechin, leader of the mineworkers
 and long noted as one of the
 two or three most powerful men
 in Bolivia, stated that unless
 prolabor adjustments were made
 in the stabilization program,
 miners and other wage earners,
 spurred on by Communists, would
 probably engage in crippling
 strikes and riots, possibly
 in March but not later than
 May.
 Both Lechin and his chief
 lieutenant, the minister of
 mines, who has also predicted
 serious trouble in the next
 several months, may be moti-
 vated in part by a desire to
 maintain their own prestige
 prior to the  mineworkers' con-
 gress scheduled for April and
 the May congress of the power-
 ful national labor confedera-
 tion--which Lechin heads.
 Lechin does, however, ap-
 pear to face a serious rivalry
 for leadership of the miners
 from Communists and pro-Com-
 munists who oppose the stabili-
 zation program and who have al-
 ready successfully provoked
 strikes of short duration.
 Since most of the miners' wages
 have reportedly been spent in
 advance through commissary pur-
 chases, the majority of the
 miners will receive no pay at
 the end of February.   Conse-
 quently, early March may be a
 critical period for the govern-
 ment.                                    25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 On the 39th anniversary
 of the Soviet armed forces on
 23 February, the USSR again
 emphasized its retaliatory
 capability, hinting that it
 possesses weapons more powerful
 than atomic and hydrogen bombs.
 Defense Minister Zhukov
 called for increased vigilance
 and stated that the Soviet
 military, together with the
 Soviet people,  "wholeheartedly"
 support the foreign policy of
 the Soviet state.
 Various articles emphasized
 that while the USSR seeks peace,
 it is more than capable of
 defending itself.   Marshal K.
 S. Moskalenko, commander of
 the Moscow military district
 and of the Moscow garrison,
 wrote in Red Star that "if a
 new world war__Breaks out,
 atomic, hydrogen,  or even more
 powerful bombs could fall on
 the American continent."   He
 further noted that the army,
 air force and navy have been
 rearmed with atomic and ther-
 monuclear weapons.   This is
 the first statement specifying
 that all three services have
 been so equipped.
 Marshal R. Ya. Malinovsky,
 commander of the Soviet ground
 troops, referred to the
 "splendid aviation units,  diver-
 sified atomic and thermonuclear
 weapons, powerful rocket arma-
 ments, including long-range
 missiles," in Soviet hands.
 Marshal K. K. Meretskov, writ-
 ing in Izvestia,  alluded to the
 ability    -f'FiI USSR to deliver
 atomic and hydrogen bombs "to
 any spot on the planet."
 The choice of Marshals
 Moskalenko and Meretskov to
 write major articles on this
 occasion suggests their rising
 prestige,  and tends to support
 other indications that the
 two have positions equal in
 status to that of a deputy
 defense minister.   Moskalenko
 had close ties with Khrushchev
 during and after the war.   They
 both came to Moscow from the
 Ukraine in 1949, Khrushchev to
 become first secretary of the
 Moscow Oblast organization,
 Moskalenko to be appointed
 air defense commander of the
 Moscow Military District,
 At the time of Beria's
 arrest, Moskalenko was appointed
 commander of the Moscow Military
 District and sat on the court
 which sentenced Beria..   He
 had been active in Moscow
 party affairs and was elected
 a full member of the party
 central committee in Februar
 1956.
 Meretskov's position since
 his return to Moscow from the
 White Sea Military District in
 late 1954 has not been deter-
 mined.  He has served briefly
 as chief of the general staff,
 commander of various fronts in
 the war,  and military district
 commander in the postwar period.
 In the Far East he was closely
 associated with Malinovsky,
 who was appointed chief of
 ground troops in early 1956.
 Meretskov was the only officer
 with the rank  of marshal of the
 Soviet Union who was not elected
 to the central committee at
 the last congress in February
 1956.   This suggests that his
 position and prestige at that
 time had not warranted it,
 but his recent prominence
 indicates a rise in his status,

 Peiping's efforts to ex-
 pand its sphere of influence
 in Asia has been marked by
 offers of economic assistance
 by which the Chinese hope to
 buy good will and prestige and
 to advertise their own econom-
 ic progress to Asians.   Develop-
 ment grants were given last
 year to Cambodia and Nepal, in
 addition to the established aid
 programs to the Communist re-
 gimes in North Korea, North
 Vietnam and Outer Mongolia.
 In the last month, the Chinese
 reportedly attempted to induce
 Laos to accept economic aid.
 Under a program inaugu-
 rated in June 1956, Peiping
 is supplying Cambodia with
 materials worth $22,400,000
 over a two-year period to help
 Cambodia develop its economy.
 The Chinese have emphasized
 that this aid is "without
 strings" in deference to Cam-
 bodian neutrality.   The pro-
 gram is administered with the
 assistance of a small technical
 mission from Peiping, however,
 which gives the Chinese Commu-
 nists de facto representation
 in a state which does not rec-
 ognize Peiping.   Leaders of
 the Chinese mission have been
 granted diplomatic privileges
 by Phnom Penh.
 Nepal has been favorably
 impressed by Communist China's
 promptness in meeting its com-
 mitments under an aid agreement
 signed last October.   Peiping
 has paid the first installment
 of a grant which will supply
 Nepal with approximately $12,-
 600,000 in cash and materials
 over a three-year period,   No
 Chinese technicians have gone
 to Katmandu, perhaps to avoid
 further arousing Indian fears
 of active penetration.   Peiping
 instead seems to be attempting
 to build good will through dis-
 interested "friendship."
 It seems likely that the
 proposed assistance program for
 Laos, following the pattern es-
 tablished by the agreement with
 Cambodia, would include an aid
 mission for administration and
 technicians to assist the Lao-
 tians at the working level
 economic development and for
 support of the Laotian army.

 last year.   This
 would require,  he
 implied,  that appro-

 be used to improve track and

 is also being asked to sustain
 a cut in spending in order to
 provide funds for economic con-

 Icelandic Federation of Labor,
 however, as well as the coun-
 try's largest single union,
 and there are no signs that
 they will be ousted from the
 coalition government.
 The Communists suffered
 their heaviest blow to date on
 24 February, when a Conservative-
 Social Democratic coalition
 gained control--by a vote of
 525 to 498--of the Reykjavik
 Factory Workers Union, the
 third largest in the country.
 Loss of this long-time bastion
 of Communist labor strength
 climaxes a recent downward
 trend in other union elections,
 in some of which the Communist
 vote fell off as much as 25
 percent.
 The decline in the Communist
 vote reflects in part the strong
 reaction of many workers to the
 Hungarian events.  The most
 significant factor, however,
 is better co-operation among
 democratic trade union elements--
 chiefly the , Conservatives and
 the Social Democrats.  The de-
 cline of the.Communist vote
 has in some instances been in
 unions which traditionally
 have been strongly Social
 Democratic and only within the
 past year or so have registered
 any significant Communist vote.
 Communist defeats do not neces-
 sarily mean a corresponding
 rise in popular support for the
 Social Democrats.
 There has been some intra-
 party dissension between the
 "Moscow':" wing and the "national
 Communists," who apparently
 want to cloak the party even
 more closely with the mantle
 of the Labor Alliance, which
 enabled the Communists and left-
 wing Socialists to win consider-
 able worker support in the June
 1956 parliamentary election.
 Despite some defections, how-
 ever, no serious party split
 appears likely.
 Communist domination of the
 Icelandic Federation of Labor,
 made secure for another two
 years at the biannual congress
 in November 1956, gives the party
 an unimpaired base from which
 to counteract the Social Demo-
 cratic-Conservative elements in
 the local unions.  The Communists
 also retain absolute control of
 the country's largest union,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY-
 28 February 1957
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE ARAB SOCIALIST RESURRECTION PARTY
 The Arab Socialist Resur-
 rection Party (ASRP), a leftist,
 ultranationalistic anti-Western
 group, has become the principal
 vehicle for spreading pro-Soviet
 and pro-Communist influence in
 Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and to
 a lesser extent,  in Iraq,  Saudi
 Arabia, Bahrein, and Kuwait.
 It is a decisive factor in
 Syrian and Jordanian politics,
 where it has been used by Nasr
 to extend Egyptian influence.
 History and ideology
 The ASRP, often called the
 t3aath,  was formed in 1953 by
 the merger of two groups of
 Syrian origin--the Arab Resur-
 rection Party and the Arab
 Socialist Party.   The Resurrec-
 tion,  sometimes referred to as
 the Renaissance Party,  was
 founded in the late 1940's by
 Michel Aflaq, a Christian, who
 had been a leader in the Syrian
 Communist Party up to 1943, and
 Salih Bitar, the present Syrian
 foreign minister.   The Arab
 Socialist Party was founded by
 Akram Hawrani, a radical, anti-
 Western politician, for the
 purpose of countering the right-
 ist Syrian Populist Party.
 Ideologically, the ASRP
 is secularist and Marxist,
 claiming that Marxian socialism
 is the ideal system for the
 Arab world.   It links itself to
 Arab nationalism by stressing
 that it is not a Syrian but an
 Arab party.   It advocates worker
 participation in the management
 of industry,  distribution of
 large agricultural holdings to
 the peasants, and strict neu-
 trality in world affairs.   Aflaq
 is the theoretician, while
 Hawrani is the practical poli-

 Personalities
 Aflaq now rejects Communism
 on philosophical grounds.   He
 maintains that its dialectical
 materialism is incompatible with
 the spiritual elements of Islam
 and that Arab nationalism cannot
 be reconciled with international
 Communism.   However,  he believes
 Communist support can be safely
 exploited to reach Arab nation-
 alistic aims.   He has a con-
 siderable intellectual hold on
 students and graduates of the
 Syrian University, whom he re-
 ceives at his apartment in the
 manner of a master imparting
 truth to his disciples.   Aflaq
 is deeply convinced of his role
 and his mission.  He and Hawrani
 have differed on party policy
 but never enough to cause seri-
 ous
 seusion.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 Hawrani is a practiced and
 practical politician and a
 brilliant speaker.       He believes
 violence will ultimately have
 to be used to carry out his pro-
 gram and he was influential in
 bringing about three of the
 military coups which have taken
 place in Syria since 1949.  He
 was minister of defense in
 Colonel Shishakli's regime and
 was considered the "brains" be-
 hind the dictator.  He broke
 with Shishakli in 1953 and fled
 to Lebanon, where he carried on
 political activities aimed at
 the overthrow of Shishakli.
 Hawrani, appreciating the
 crucial position of the army
 in Syrian politics, has followed
 a policy of actively infiltrat-
 ing the officer corps, especial-
 ly those officers in key posi-
 tions in intelligence and ar-
 mored units.  Younger officers,
 dissatisfied with Syria's po-
 litical conditions, and univer-
 sity students, who are easily
 inflamed, are the party's
 stanchest supporters.
 Communist Support
 The turning point in the
 ASRP's fortunes came in 1954,
 when the party agreed to accept
 Communist support and gained 17
 of the 142 seats in the new
 Syrian parliament.   In 1955, it
 supported the Asali cabinet
 because of the latter's opposi-
 tion to any alliance or agree-
 ment with the United States,
 Turkey, or Iraq.
 Hawrani has been the lead-
 er in promoting co-operation
 with the Communists, but Aflaq
 also freely admits to co-opera-
 tion and is confident that the
 ASRP is by far the stronger of
 the two allies.  He claims the
 public knows that the party has
 consistently been ahead of the
 Communists in its demands for
 social reform.  Aflaq is con-
 fident that Arabism will win
 out over Communism.
 Co-operation with the So-
 viet Union is based on the old
 Arab adage "my enemy's enemy
 is my friend", in this case the
 enemy is Western "imperialism."
 If the ASRP attained power, it
 might fall prey to the Com-
 munists within its ranks.
 Role in Various Countries
 The party believes its po-
 litical fortunes benefited from
 the Anglo-French intervention
 in Egypt, which it feels gave
 the Arabs a stronger sense of
 unity.  Federation with Egypt
 is one of the party's immediate
 goals.
 Syria:  The ASRP's policies
 have nominated the Syrian polit-
 ical scene since the invasion
 of Egypt and have been hardly
 distinguishable from those of
 the Communists.  The Syrian
 press and radio feature Soviet-
 inspired items, conservative
 influence has been greatly
 undermined, and the flow of
 Soviet bloc military equipment
 and technicians has increased.
 A factor which has contributed
 to the momentum of Syrian orien-
 tation toward the Soviet Orbit
 is the influence and encourage-
 ment of Egypt, which is, itself,
 following much the same course.
 The ASRP has been a prime mover
 behind the pressure for Syrian-
 Egyptian political and economic
 union and for the purging of
 government officials who are
 considered unreliable, i.e.,
 pro-Western.
 Jordan:   In Jordan, the
 ASRP operates quite openly and
 appears to have captured the
 imagination, if not the loyalty,
 of General Nuwar, the ambitious
 army chief of staff.  The govern-
 ment has become infiltrated by
 its members.  Minister of State
 for Foreign Affairs Abdullah
 al-Rimawi is, like the Syrian
 foreign minister, a member of
 the party.   Its greatest
 strength in Jordan lies with
 the refugees.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 Iraq:   Since all political
 parties are banned in Iraq, the
 activities of the ASRP are nec-
 essarily clandestine.                              The party
 is the most active nationalist
 organization in Iraq and, as
 in Syria and Jordan,  it co-
 operates with the Communists.
 The ASRP's major strength is
 found in the schools and among
 the professional classes,
 especially in the higher insti-
 tutions of learning--Baghdad
 Law College, the College of
 Medicine, and the teachers
 college.   It aims at the rover-
 throw of Nuri Said and the
 palace regime.   A center of its
 activities is the Arab Renais-
 sance Club, which was organized
 under the auspices of pro-West-
 ern Fadhal Jamali, but which
 has fallen under ASRP control.
 The Iraqi government has con-
 tinually tried to repress the
 party, and numerous members
 have been sentenced to prison.
 Saudi Arabia:   Penetration
 by the ASRP into Saudi Arabia
 is still minor and has been con-
 fined to Palestinian Arabs who
 are employed by Aramco.  How-
 ever, the party has a strong,
 following among Palestinian
 employees, and several handbills
 have been distributed attacking
 the "greedy colonialism" of
 Aramco and urging strikes in
 support of Arab solidarity and
 against the "shameful attitude
 of the Saudi government and the
 Saudi royal family."  Nasr is
 hailed as the "sincere hero of
 the Arabs."
 In Kuwait and Bahrein, the
 extent of ASRP influence is un-
 known, but agitators are Arab
 Palestinians.   The party's in-
 fluence has spread to Egypt,
 particularly among students,
 via Syrian youths sent to study
 at Egyptian universities and
 military schools.
 The ASRP appears to be a
 much more active vehicle for
 Communists and fellow travelers
 in the area than are the Com-
 munist parties themselves.   Arab
 Communists are aware of this
 situation and appear indeed to
 HUNGARIAN ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS
 Fundamental to the Kadar
 regime's attempts to stabilize
 Hungary politically is the
 necessity to restore the Hungar-
 ian economy.                  In an effort to
 meet economic grievances and get
 the populace back to work, the
 government has made a number of
 concessions, notably in agri-
 cultural administration.   The
 damage to the economy will not
 be fully repaired until well
 after the end of 1957, necessi-
 tating a reduction of planned
 investment and a major realloca-
 tion of labor and materials to
 overcome economic dislocations.
 Scarcities are beginning
 to raise the threat of inflation;
 and unemployment, while less
 severe than had been anticipated,
 is a serious problem which may
 worsen if badly needed raw
 materials are not obtained from
 the Soviet Union or elsewhere
 to keep production going.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 During the last two months
 of 1956, according to the Hun
 garian press, production was
 virtually at a standstill, re-
 ducing the national income for
 1956 to about 10 percent below
 the planned figure.   Industrial
 production,which in December
 was equal to about one quarter
 of the September rate, had
 risen to 50 percent in January,
 according to regime statements.
 Coal and Power
 The coal shortage, one of
 the foremost problems during
 the three months following the
 revolt, has been somewhat alle-
 viated through imports and in-
 creased production.   The mines
 now supply between 55,000 and
 60,000 tons per day compared
 to a normal output of 70,000
 tons before the revolt.  The
 number of miners presently ex-
 ceeds 80,000, according to
 official sources, whereas some
 94,000 workers were employed in
 the industry prior to 23 October.
 Coal now is available to furnish
 power for a1l'.industries except
 the . largest'consumers, such as
 the key aluminum and`. steel in-
 dustries, which are being.re
 stored to p:roductaon .gradually'.
 In an effort to get miners
 to resume work, the regime
 raised wages, abolished the
 norm system,  and announced that
 the traditional wage system
 based on professional skill in
 the mining industry was being
 restored,
 Industrial Limitations
 Raw material shortages and
 labor slowdowns are preventing
 many factories from resuming
 full production.   According to
 official announcements, the out-
 put of some factories is only
 50 to 70 percent of average,
 with reductions up to 20 percent
 in number of workers employed.
 Production at the Csepel iron
 and steel works was said by the
 regime to be 60 to 70 percent
 of normal, but plan targets
 are now 15 to 20 percent lower
 than before 23 October.  The
 aluminum-processing industry
 has been almost completely at
 a standstill but is scheduled
 to resume operations in March.
 Directors of the Hungarian
 oil industry claim that work in
 the:oil fields has continued dur-
 ing the entire period since 23
 October despite power and trans-
 port difficulties.  Production
 is said to be about 70 percent
 of normal.
 With the exception of some
 plants in Budapest and on Csepel
 Island,  there was apparently
 little damage to industria,'~

 workers at the 25X1
 an                     j

 northeastern Hungary, which pro-
 duces about 30 percent of the
 country's crude steel, deliber-
 ately let the steel solidify in
 the open-hearth furnaces during
 the revolt.   As a result the
 smelt equipment must be com-
 pletely replaced.
 Although no statement has
 been made that heavy industry
 would lose its priority in
 Hungarian planning, concern has
 been expressed about the suit-
 ability of some of the long-
 term industrial projects which
 have been undertaken.
 For example, Minister of
 Industry Apro said on 4 January
 that the country did not need
 the Dunapentele  (Sztalinvaros)
 metallurgical combine, which is
 only half completed:   "Much
 money and labor went into the
 erection of this center of
 heavy industry in the Hungarian
 plains at Stalin's behest.   It
 was believed that this was the
 way to improve and secure the
 country, but time has proved
 this an erroneous idea.  Hungary
 is poor in raw materials and
 electric energy, so it should
 not have developed heavy industry
 on the scale it did but should
 have concentrated its energies
 and resources to produce goods

 requiring less materials but
 more craftmanship."
 A temporary wave of hoard-
 ing in the wake of the revolu-
 tion,  combined with the stoppage
 of light industrial production,
 seriously reduced stocks of in-
 dustrial consumer goods.  The
 value of these stocks is es-
 timated to have fallen from 14
 to 5 billion forints ($1.19 bil-
 lion to $425,000,000) as of the
 end of the year.   At present
 the principal shortages are in
 clothing and shoes.
 The regime claims that a
 rapid increase in the coal sup-
 ply has made it possible to re-
 sume production in many facto-
 riesand avoid widespread unem-
 ployment.  The regime puts the
 unemployed at about 100,000.
 The outflow of refugees to the
 West eased unemployment but
 aggravated production problems
 because of losses of skilled
 workers and high-caliber per-
 sonnel.  Present dismissals of
 government employees as part
 of an economy drive add to un-
 employment.   In some factories
 a shorter workweek  has been
 temporarily instituted to
 prevent dismissals.
 In an important concession
 designed to reduce unemployment,
 the Kadar regime plans to grant
 loans to assist people in set-
 ting up their own businesses,
 especially workers who lose
 their jobs as a result of
 "rationalization measures."
 Of further encouragement to
 private industry is a decree
 effective 1 January abolishing
 the income tax payable by in-
 dependent small shopkeepers and
 craftsmen for their employees.
 The government is faced
 with the difficulty of trying
 to persuade workers to co-oper-
 ate despite their disapproval
 of the regime.  Pressure is
 being brought to include party
 members in workers' councils
 to assure adherence to regime
 policies, while the importance
 of the party-controlled trade
 union organization is also
 being emphasized.
 Budget
 To forestall inflation,
 the regime plans to cut the
 1957 budget, especially in gov-
 ernment administrative expenses,
 national defense and capital
 investments, completing only
 those capital projects which
 require "very little expense"
 and which help increase stocks
 of consumer goods.
 A budget has been prepared
 to cover the first quarter of
 1957, and the Planning Office
 has been instructed to submit
 proposals by 31 March for a
 plan to cover the remainder of
 the year.  Capital investments
 in 1957 will be reduced to ti
 billion forints instead of 11.6
 billion as planned before the
 revolution.  The government
 has also announced that since
 it would be impossible to
 carry out the old five-year
 plan, a special three-year plan
 for 1958-60 is being prepared.
 Foreign Exchange and Trade
 The foreign economic loans
 which Hungary has received
 since October 1956 provide only
 temporary support for an economy
 which even prior to the revolu-
 tion was in serious difficulties.
 The country's normally high-
 cost obsolescent industry, which
 is based almost entirely on im-
 ported materials, has been un-
 able to compete successfully in
 foreign markets.  The fact that
 imports exceed exports in  trade
 with the West has necessitated
 curtailment of needed imports
 and the arrangement of short-
 term credits often on a precar-
 ious day-to-day basis.  Hungary
 has a substantial foreign debt
 and is negotiating for postpone-
 ment of certain payments due al-
 most immediately.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 At least half of the for-
 eign assistance to Hungary in
 the past three months has con-
 sisted of relief supplies.  The
 remainder, primarily from Com-
 munist countries, is composed
 of commodity and rehabilitation
 loans,  including foreign ex-
 change loans of more than $50,-
 000,000 each granted by the
 USSR and Communist China, which
 may meet some of Hungary's
 .longer-range needs.   Additional
 Soviet assistance valued at
 $200,000,000 is now being nego-
 tiated.
 The Hungarian Central
 Office of Statistics,reported
 on 15 January that the produc-
 tion level of the food industry
 had reached that of September.
 Basic foods are available and
 a semblance of normalcy has
 been restored in the distribu-
 tion system,  in part because of
 the relief and economic aid
 received from both the bloc and
 Western countries.  The longer-
 range outlook for the urban
 food supply is unfavorable,
 with much depending on whether
 sufficient imports can be
 obtained during the second
 quarter of the year.
 Agriculture
 The disintegration of co-
 operative farms in Hungary was
 extensive and rapid.   According
 to Agriculture Minister Dogei,
 only half of the country's co-
 operatives still function, and
 land, stock and machinery be-
 longing to the co-operatives
 have been distributed among the
 peasants.  The Central Office
 of Statistics stated on 15
 January that about 1,720 co-
 operatives were functioning,
 in contrast to 3,930 reported
 at the end of September.   In a
 broadcast on 6 January,  the
 regime made plain that the
 agricultural collectives and
 state farms would continue to
 be supported by the government
 and that "the government will
 treat with great severity at-
 tempts to deprive the state
 and co-operative farms of their
 property."
 On the other hand, there
 is considerable evidence that
 the regime realizes the need
 for improvement in the ad-
 ministration of its agricultural
 policy in order to raise pro-
 duction.   Some measures re-
 stricting trade in real estate
 are being abolished.   It will
 be possible for producer co-
 operatives and state farms to
 purchase land, and even in-
 dependent farmers may purchase
 or lease land up to the legal
 maximum of 35 acres.  Any in-
 dividual will be able to lease
 his land,or the property may
 be share-farmed.
 The regime is also seek-
 ing to enlist the support of
 noncollectivized farmers whose
 produce is essential to supply
 adequate food for the populace
 as well as important export
 products.  The compulsory pro-
 duce delivery quota system, so
 disliked by the peasantry, was
 abolished by the Nagy govern-
 ment late in October--a con-
 cession which the Kadar govern-
 ment has continued.   Although
 "full freedom of peasant produc-
 tion and marketing" has been
 promised by the regime, a new
 system of state contractual
 bulk-buying at "free state
 prices" is being instituted
 which limits this freedom some-
 what.  Nevertheless, the regime
 has promised the peasants they
 will get higher prices for their
 produce.
 Future Prospects
 The chaotic situation in
 the Hungarian economy will pre-
 vent a return to full production
 during 1957 and perhaps for a
 longer period.  Manpower--skilled
 technical, and professional--
 lost through emigration cannot
 be replaced in a short time,
 Full production in the aluminum,
 steel and other vital, industries
 will not be restored for many
 months, and worker morale and
 consequently worker productivity
 will  ec)ntinue to be low.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 GERMAN UNIFICATION AND EUROPEAN SECURITY
 In this election year, the
 government of Chancellor
 Adenauer is under strong com-
 pulsion, as it was before the
 Bundestag elections of Septem-
 ber 1953, to satisfy the public
 that it is doing its utmost for
 German unification.  Realizing
 that unification can be achieved
 only within the framework of
 great-power interests, the
 government has since 1953 made
 particular efforts to find some
 way of reassuring Moscow that a
 unified Germany would not threat
 on the security of the Soviet
 bloc.   Arms limitations, buffer
 zones, collective security
 pacts, modifications in the
 Atlantic alliance or German
 withdrawal from the alliance
 have all been suggested by pol-
 iticians and commentators.
 Bonn's Major Considerations
 The government's attitude
 is colored by a number of con-
 siderations.   Chancellor Ade-
 nauer and his advisers doubt
 that Moscow is ready to permit
 German unification on any terms
 except the totally unacceptable
 one of assured Communist con-
 trol.             At the same time,  the
 chancellor still seems to be-
 lieve in his policy of unified

 Pacts and Buffer Zones
 In the many Eu-
 ,ropean security;propos-
 als made by both So-
 viet and Western lead-
 ers since mid-1953,
 the two common ele-
 ments have usually
 been formal guarantees
 by both sides, and a
 buffer zone or area of
 reduced armaments
 which would lessen the
 possibility of border
 clashes and, perhaps,
 provide a testing
 ground for internation-
 al arms inspection.
 The proposals have
 differed on the
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES             Page 7 of 14
 Western strength. These views
 would suggest that the govern-
 ment need make no extraordinary
 effort to reach agreement.
 On the other hand, in a
 year when control of the Bun-
 destag is at stake, Adenauer
 must not allow any doubt to
 arise in the voters' minds
 that he is doing his best to
 reunite the country, and
 according to opinion polls,
 the public considers unifica-
 tion more important than the
 Western alliance.   Adenauer
 would probably like to crown
 his career by uniting Germany.
 Moreover, he is seriously
 worried about the possibility
 of the tensions in central
 Europe resulting in war.
 The government's approach
 to the problem is likely to be
 one of steady formula-seeking,
 restrained by a basic caution
 regarding Germany's security.
 Bonn has no intention of find-
 ing itself friendless in the
 maelstrom of European politics,
 even for the sake of unifica-
 tion, and is therefore unlikely
 to make any move that would
 seriously threaten its good
 relations with the West, es-
 pecially the United States.

 that a United Ger-
 many in a Western al-
 liance would not nec-
 essarily advance the
 position of NATO
 forces to the east.
 In 1953, for example,
 he proposed that as
 Germany is unified,
 all of the present
 East Germany, and an
 equal area east of
 the Oder-Neisse line,
 be demilitarized.
 Moscow rejected this
 plan as weakening
 only the East, not
 the West.
 As early as the election
 campaign of 1953, Adenauer
 attempted to undercut an ex-
 pected Soviet proposal of Ger-
 man neutrality by suggesting
 a mutual East-West security
 guarantee--a suggestion which,
 although repeated the next
 year, drew no expression of So-
 viet interest.   Adenauer has
 outside NATO, with
 NATO forces remaining in the
 Ruhr and on the west bank of
 the Rhine, and Soviet forces
 withdrawing to the Oder-Neisse
 line.
 At a press conference on
 11 January this year, Adenauer
 talked of a militarily "thinned
 zone" extending beyond the
 Federal Republic both to the
 east and the west.  This plan
 was not conditioned on German
 unification, but was offered
 only to improve the "inter-
 national climate."                                                                   He said

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 28 February 1957
 it was "perhaps almost certain"
 that Bonn would discuss such an
 arrangement with its allies
 this year.  Apparently as a re-
 sult of vigorous objections
 from his Christian Democratic
 Party, Adenauer practically
 withdrew this proposal in anoth-
 er press conference on 25 Jan-
 uary, when he stated that it
 was useful only to control con-
 ventional forces and should be
 considered after the great pow-
 ers had agreed to ban thermo-
 nuclear weapons.
 It seems unlikely that
 West Germany would,  in fact,
 accept any limitations on its
 armed forces going beyond the
 restrictions in the Paris trea-
 ties, except in conjunction
 with German unification.
 Affiliation of United Germany
 Neither the Christian
 Democrats nor the opposition
 Social Democratic Party (SPD)
 gives any evidence of wanting
 the Federal Republic to with-
 draw from NATO as an opening
 move.to lure the USSR into an
 agreement on unification. More-
 over, there is little tendency
 to accept a position of complete
 military isolation for a united
 Germany.  The issue of what
 military ties a united Germany
 should have is, however, hotly
 disputed.
 Under  an SPD plan, unifi-
 cation would coincide with re-
 placement of NATO and the War-
 saw alliance by a collective
 security pact involving both
 the US and the USSR.  While the
 SPD has not fully explained how
 its pact would operate,  it prob-
 ably envisages something like
 the "Eastern Locarno," suggested
 by Churchill in 1953, by which
 each side would be pledged to
 assist the victim of aggression.
 Under a pact of this kind, how-
 ever, Germany would not partic-
 ipate in NATO peacetime milri-
 tary planning.
 Most coalition politicians
 do not like the SPD plan, partly
 because they doubt that it would
 offer as much security as NATO.
 A West German general recently
 told American officials that
 peacetime planning was indis-
 pensable.   Coalition leaders
 are also loath to accept the
 restrictions on German sover-
 eignty which would be involved
 in giving up freedom to make
 alliances.
 Both Foreign Minister
 Brentano and Bundestag presi-
 dent Gerstenmaier,  however,
 have recently demanded simply
 an effective security guarantee
 for a united Germany.  Gersten
 ma ier said on 12 February that
 when such a guarantee was forth-
 coming, German membership in
 NATO could be "put up for debate."
 Brentano remarked on 18 January
 that Bonn was willing to find
 new forms of living side by
 side with the Soviet bloc, and
 that this could be done within
 existing pact systems or with-
 in systems still to be created.
 It is possible the coali-
 tion leaders will try to counter
 the SPD plan with a proposal that
 a collective security system be
 superimposed on NATO, with the
 purpose of guaranteeing assist-
 ance to the Soviet Union in
 the event of German aggression,
 an arrangement Adenauer had in
 mind two years ago.
 Defense Minister Strauss,
 who frequently makes proposals
 without the coalition's backing,
 was reported in the press on
 19 February as reiterating that
 a unified Germany would not
 automatically be bound by the
 Federal Republic's ties with
 the West.  He stated that "though
 the wish and desire of security
 of a reunited Germany would
 point to membership in a Western
 military alliance, the hard
 political realities" might call
 for a neutral position like
 Austria's.
 Adenauer seems to be de-
 veloping an entirely new thesis
 which may relieve him of the
 necessity of debating the re-
 spective merits of freedom of
 alliance and the SPD security
 pact.  On 13 February, he

 LEADING PROPOSALS FOR A EUROPEAN SECURITY AGREEMENT
 1953
 May         - Churchill suggests an "eastern Locarno" by which "Germany" and the
 Soviet Union would be guaranteed against aggression by each other, but
 without indicating whether he meant a united Germany.
 July        - Adenauer suggests a mutual guarantee between the proposed European
 Defense Community and the USSR.
 Sept.       - Adenauer suggests a demilitarized zone covering all of East Germany
 and an equal area east of the Oder-Neisse.
 Sept.       - Belgian foreign minister van Zeeland proposes withdrawal of US,
 British, and Soviet forces to the Rhine and Vistula, demilitarization
 of East Germany, and a 20-year guarantee of the Oder-Neisse line.
 Sept.       - French deputy foreign minister Schumann proposes Western-Soviet pact
 1954                guaranteeing frontiers against forceful change.
 Feb.        - At Berlin conference, Molotov offers European security treaty, with
 mutual ass stance provision,  to replace NATO.   US would not be a party;
 Germany wod remain divided.
 Oct.        - Adenauer suggests nonaggression pact between Western Europe and So-
 viet bloc.
 1955
 May         - Social Democrats call for a united Germany's membership in a new se-
 curity pact with all the major powers instead of in a purely Western
 pact.
 July        - At summit meeting, Prime Minister Eden proposes a demilitarized zone
 between East and West, and heads of state direct their foreign minis-
 ters to consider a European security pact,  including arms limits and
 inspection and a zone of agreed force levels.
 Oct.        - At Geneva foreign ministers' meeting, West offers the Eden plan--a
 collective security pact in stages, providing for mutual assistance,
 to be fully effective when a united Germany enters NATO and WEU. There
 would be a zone of controlled arms along united Germany's eastern bor-
 der.
 Oct.        - At Geneva meeting,  the USSR suggests a security pact including the
 US and WEU states with the Warsaw pact states and involving mutual as-
 sistance and a consultative body, all conditioned on a divided Germany
 1956                anb dissolution of the Western and Warsaw alliances.
 Mar.        - Free Democrat Erich Mende proposes that both parts of Germany leave
 alliances,  that foreign forces withdraw to the Rhine and the Oder-
 Neisse line, with German forces in the area between, and that acol-
 lective security pact be concluded, all prior to German unification.
 Mar.        - At London conference of UN Disarmament Subcommittee, the USSR pro-
 poses a European zone,  to include both Germanies,  in which atomic
 weapons would be banned.  Progressive disarmament program would limit
 German forces to 200,000.
 Sept.       - Bonn,  in its first note to Moscow on unification, expresses interest
 in re-examining collective security proposals involving mutual assist-
 ance and demilitarized zones.
 Oct.        - Soviet reply to Bonn's note urges participation of two German states
 1957
 Jan. 11     - Adenauer suggests a militarily "thinned zone" extending east and west
 beyond the Federal Republic.
 Jan. 16     - Social Democrat Fritz Erler calls for consideration of a "thinned
 zone" and treaty system guaranteed by the US and USSR, as a means of at-
 taining German unity and East European freedom.
 Jan. 25     - Adenauer declares "thinned zone" is useful only after international
 ban on thermonuclear weapons.
 Feb. 13     - Adenauer says he is not opposed to a European security system, but
 that the main effort should be directed toward banning nuclear guided
 missiles.

 Whether Adenauer intends
 to  make a ban on nuclear guided
 missiles a precondition to a
 security pact will perhaps
 emerge in the US-British-German-
 French talks scheduled to open
 in Washington on 6 March in an
 effort to find a common policy
 on the interrelated questions
 of German  unification and
 European security.
 LIBERALIZATION IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 In the aftermath of the
 disorders in Poland and Hungary,
 the Chinese Communists are pro-
 ceeding cautiously, with the lib-
 eralization program started in
 1956.   Heretofore proscribed
 courses of study have been re-
 introduced into university cur-
 ricula; the forms, if not the
 substance,  of political democ-
 ratization  have been extended;
 and free markets, under careful
 state scrutiny, have been estab-
 lished for many commodities.
 Cowed by recent repression, the
 Chinese intelligentsia is react-
 ing timidly to liberalization
 and shows no disposition to
 emulate its bolder contemporar=
 ies elsewhere in the bloc by
 calling for more liberties than
 the authorities wish to concede.
 The first intimations of a
 liberalization policy in China
 appeared at a party conference
 in January 1956, when Chou En-
 lai called for more conciliatory
 treatment of  intellectuals,
 "the most precious property of
 the state."  The program, which
 emerged from the Soviet 20th
 party congress in February 1956,
 provided Soviet sanction for a
 swing toward moderation in
 China.   In May, Mao Tse-tung
 gave his blessings to a "new
 course" for China with the ex-
 hortation to "let all flowers
 bloom together and all schools
 of thought contend."
 Promises
 In succeeding weeks, the
 Communists provided some guide-
 lines for the liberalization.
 The intellectuals were to be
 conceded freedom of thought
 "inside the camp of the people."
 They were encouraged to examine
 divergent schools of thought
 and even to publicize in "free"
 debates the heresy of idealism.
 The conclusions of these debates
 were foreordained, however, by
 the reminder that "debates are
 intended to find out the truth.
 Only dialectical materialism
 is the truth."
 In the arts, members of
 the intelligentsia were assured
 they need no longer restrict
 themselves to heroic portraits
 of the worker in overalls but
 were free to select themes out-
 side the confines of "socialist
 realism."  As Communist Party
 leader Lu Ting-i rationalized,
 "taboos and commandments about
 choice of subject matter can
 only hamstring art and litera-
 ture and result in writing to

 formula and bad taste."  But
 nonproletarian themes, Lu ob-
 served, should be used to crit-
 icize rather than romanticize
 the old society.
 In regard to the natural
 sciences, Peiping seemed less
 inclined to preserve the hedges
 around freedom of expression
 and research.   Particularly
 significant was the announce-
 ment--as yet not echoed by
 orthodox Marxists elsewhere in
 the bloc--that these sciences
 had no class character and that
 theoretical formulations in
 these sciences could not proper-
 ly be labeled with the epithets
 feudal and capitalist.
 Peiping may be convinced
 it must allow scientists to
 broaden their horizons beyond
 the confines permitted in the
 Soviet Union under Stalin.
 Chinese scientists were appar-
 ently not to be subjected to
 the sort of vilification suf-
 fered by Russians who disagreed
 with the party-supported
 theories of Lysenko.   The study
 of English in China was en-
 couraged, and scientists were
 told to borrow freely from West-
 ern as well as Soviet studies.
 Party Congress
 While intellectuals were
 apparently the chief benefici-
 aries of the new course, the
 people at large were also to
 feel the relaxation of state
 pressures.   Speaking at the
 eighth party congress in Septem-
 ber, Director of Public Security
 Lo Jui-ching promised a con-
 tinuing fight against unyield-
 ing counterrevolutionaries but
 declared that the stage of
 fierce class struggle had passed.
 Earlier in the year, the re-
 gime had announced a policy of
 leniency toward surrendering
 counterrevolutionaries and re-
 ductions in the sentences of
 those already convicted who
 were properly repentant.   Agri-
 cultural collectives were no
 longer to refuse membership to
 reformed counterrevolutionaries.
 Speakers at the party
 congress also promised the
 creation of "free markets."
 Goods worth some 12 billion
 yuan--out of a total annual
 retail trade of 46 billion--
 were to be freed in varying
 degrees from state control.
 The ruling applied to minor
 local products, handicraft
 goods and general consumer
 goods.
 In support of its lip serv-
 ice                                                                  to democratic practices
 in political affairs, Peiping
 about this time began to em-
 phasize the functional role
 of the puppet parties as the
 representatives of the non-
 proletarian classes.   At the
 National People's Congress in
 June, Communist Party members
 were chided for belittling the
 function of the "democratic"
 parties,  and "mutual super-
 vision and criticism" between
 these parties and the Chinese
 Communists were called for.
 Response
 The Chinese intelligent-
 sia--thoroughly cowed by the
 campaign against intellectual
 nonconformity in 1955, and
 familiar with the Communists'
 record of alternating periods
 of moderation with periods of
 repression--were not emboldened
 by Mao's call to "let all
 schools of thought contend."
 Furthermore,  Peiping.'s repeated
 warnings that liberalization
 constituted no sanction for
 the propagation of counter-
 revolutionary views discouraged
 intellectual flirtations with
 the heterodoxy.
 The absence of post-l.iber-
 alization unrest in China prob-
 ably reflects in part the lack
 of serious factionalism within
 the Chinese party.   In the
 Eastern European Satellites
 last year, intellectuals were
 able to draw support from
 "liberal" elements within the
 Communist parties,,and the
 call for more freedom resulted
 as much in an intraparty

 struggle as one between the
 party and non-Communists.   With
 no known faction to challenge
 Mao Tse-tung's supremacy, in-
 tellectuals in China could draw
 no such support.
 In any case, inclinations
 toward intellectual independence
 were probably dampened by
 Peiping's second look at liber-
 alization, following the East
 European disorders last fall.
 The regime thereafter made
 clear its determination to keep
 its liberalization program
 within bounds.   Propaganda em-
 phasis shifted from the promise
 of democratization to a need
 for disciplined unity.   Sensing
 a developing cynicism among the
 nation's students, Peiping
 called for further indoctrina-
 tion "so that in this complex
 international situation, they
 will be able to distinguish
 between right and wrong."
 Implementation
 Current curricula in the
 universities show that the
 authorities now are allowing
 students a limited exposure to
 Western thought.   Lectures have
 been introduced on the philos-
 ophies of Hegal and Bertrand
 Russell.   Anglo-American law
 and the economic theories of
 Keynes are also being studied,
 although presented in an un-
 flattering light and with the
 declared purpose of proving the
 superiority of Marxist doctrine.
 "Student ideas and democratic
 life," notes the official
 People's Daily, have taken "a
 new lease on  ife, and an at-
 mosphere where the students
 speak unreservedly and think
 independently has presented
 itself."  Under the circum-
 stances,  the schools are adjured
 to remember their continuing
 obligation of positive leader-
 ship along the approved ideo-
 logical paths.
 In the political arena,
 the Chinese are trying to show
 that democratization is being
 honored in practice as well as
 principle.   The national and
 local congresses serve mainly
 as forums for authoritative
 pronouncements from the top
 leadership,  but delegates now
 may offer suggestions on minor
 points.   The puppet parties--
 the ostensible representatives
 of the nonproletarian classes
 in China's multiclassstate--
 have been encouraged to expand
 their membership.   These par-
 ties had an 80-percent increase
 in their membership rolls over
 the year.
 The free markets promised
 in September have been estab-
 lished, and fully a third of
 all marketed agricultural pro-
 duce is now sold in these
 markets.   The appointment of
 politburo member Chen Yun as
 minister of commerce,  with
 responsibility for administer-
 ing the markets, indicates the
 importance Peiping attaches to
 the experiment.   In recent
 months, however, the authori-
 ties have issued a series of
 directives redefining the role
 of the free markets.   Producers
 and consumers will still be per-
 mitted to make direct trans-
 actions,  but under closer state
 supervision.
 Prospects
 Despite their present
 toleration of free markets,  the
 Chinese Communists have never
 considered that liberalization
 marked a retreat from Socialism.
 Liberalization may provide a
 more peaceful transition to
 socialism but it is not to delay
 the process.   When Peiping
 started its liberalization pro-
 gram last spring, about 50 per-
 cent of China's peasant house-
 holds were enrolled in the fully
 socialist collective-type co-
 operatives.   Before the year's
 end, the figure was 80 percent.
 The current policy of mod-
 eration, Peiping frankly ac
 knowledges, is?.possible because
 the nonproletarian classes were

 sufficiently "educated" during
 earlier repressive stages. The
 Chinese, moreover, probably con-
 sider a periodic return to the
 more ruthless accents essential
 if the socialization drive is
 to avoid loss of momentum.
 It is nevertheless likely
 that some features of the cur-
 rent liberalization will sur-
 vive the next few shifts in
 party line, particularly as
 regards the natural sciences.
 Such innovations as the en-
 larged freedom to examine West-
 ern sources must necessarily
 be sustained if they are to
 have the effect Peiping desires
 in raising China's scientific
 standards.   The oft-repeated
 warnings against "counter-
 revolutionary" views should in
 the coming years prove least
 inhibitory to China's physi-
 cists, chemists, biologists
 and others who have been as-
 sured their disciplines have no
 class character.   In no case,
 however, do Communist China's
 leaders envisage any freedom
 to question the fundamental
 policies of tL   r regime.
