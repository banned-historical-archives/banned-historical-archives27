INDOCHINA 
The 81st anniversary of Ho Chi Minh's birth on 19 May provides the 
occasion for Hanoi and the Front to reiterate thr.ar determination 
to adhere to Ho's last will and testament and "resolutely fight 
the U.S. aggressors until complete victory." A commemorative 
address by Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh contained standard 
propaganda fare: Trinh lauded recent victories throughout 
Indochina, warned of new U.S. "adventures" against the DRV, and 
denounced the United States for failing to accept the communist 
proposals for a settlement. 
Attention to the fighting in South Vietnam includes Hanoi comment 
pegged to a communique, broadcast on 21 May, claiming that from 
1 December 1970 to 10 April nearly 7,500 ARVN troops were put out 
of action in the operation in the U Minh jungle. Vietnamese and 
Cambodian communist media on the 25th for the first time took 
note of the ARVN operation launched into Cambodia on 11 May, 
claiming that by the 17th nearly 1400 South Vietnamese had been put 
out of action in Svay Rieng and Prey Veng provinces. 
The "new" 12 May Pathet Lao peace initiative calling for a bombing 
halt and a cease-fire received official support from the Vietnamese 
communists in DRV and PRG Foreign Ministry statements on the 20th 
and 21st, respectively. A VNA statement on the 24th dismissed as 
"slander" Souvanna Phouma's letters to the Geneva conference 
cochairmen and to the ICC on "the so-called aggressive actu of 
North Vietnamese troops." VNA did not, of course, acknowledge 
that Souvanna Phouma was complaining about attacks on Pak Song on 
the Bolovens Plateau and on Muong Dong Hene in Savannakhet 
Province. Hanoi media have publicized Pathet Lao reports on the 
communist advances in southern Laos, but there has been no DRV 
comment. 
Moscow propagandists routinely reiterate that the Vietnamization 
policy is failing and that the United States must set a troop-
withdrawal deadline in order to proceed to a settlement. Moscow 
continues to charge that Peking's friendly gestures toward the 
United States encourage the expansion of U.S. aggression in 
Indochina. And the anniversary of Mao Tse-tung's 20 May 1970 
statement on the U.S. incursion into Cambodia prompts further Soviet 
claims that the PRC supports the Indochinese in words only.* 
HO'S BIRTH ANNIVERSARY MARKED BY PLEDGES TO CONTINUE STRUGGLE

1970 by a Hanoi meeting on 18 May, jointly sponsored by the VWP

Central Committee, the National Assembly Standing Committee, 
the Council of Ministers, and the Vietnam Fatherland Front 
Central Committee. President Ton Duc Thang opened the 
meeting and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy 
Trinh gave the main address, the text of which was carried 
by Hanoi radio on the 20th. From 16 through 18 May Hanoi had 
broadcast installments of Premier Pham Van Dong's address 
delivered at last year's Hanoi meeting commemorating the 
80th anniversary of Ho's birth.* And VNA on the 19th 
reported that "all the Hanoi dailies" carried editorials 
marking the anniversary. 
Except for Pham Hung,** the only Politburo member not reported 
atter ling the Hanoi meeting was Le Duc Tho. However, Tho 'S 
prest.nce in Hanoi had been noted as recently as 16 May, when 
VNA :ir.ted him among those who met Le Duan uron his return 
from Visit to Peking and his sojourn in the USSR after 
attending the CPSU congress. Trinh's speech focused most 
attention on the construction of socialism in the DRV, but it 
also included standard discourse on U.S. "aggression" 
throughout Indochina. Among other things, Trinh repeated 
the characterization of the Laos incursion as resulting in 
"great strategic victories" for the communists; and he 
said that the Laos action, along with "important" communist 
victories in Cambodia, had left the allies more confused and 
divided. He pointed to growing opposition to the war in the 
United States but said the Nixon Alministration "still balked" 
at accepting the NFLSV's proposals: The United States refuses 
to set a deadline for total withdrawal and persists in 
"maintaining" the Thieu-Ky-Khiem administration. Pro forma 
criticism was also leveled at the United States for its "daily" 
strikes at the North and its "hatching cf new military 
ventures against the DRV." 
Trinh followed these denunciations by recalling Ho's warning 
that the war may drag on and "the people may have to face new 
sacrifices of life and property," but "whatever happens we 
must keep firm our resolve to fight the U.S. aggressors until 
total victory." He also noted that the 19th plenum of the 
Party Central Committee--announced last February--pointed out 
that "the foremost task of our entire party, army, and people 
at this moment" is to fight the "aggressors." 
See the TRENDS of 20 May 1970, pages 13-15.

Trinh thanked the socialist countries and 
flour friends worldwide" who have "whole-
heartedly supported and assisted" the DRV 
and in socialist construction. And in another 
said that Pthoroughly imbued" with Ho's instructions, 
and people have always striven to contribute toward 
international solidarity and the internal solidarity 
of the socialist camp and toward actively restoring the 
solidarity bloc of fraternal parties." The WAN DOI NHAN DAN 
editorial of the 19th also observes that Ho "untiringly 
struggled for international unity," which he regarded as "an 
indispensable factor for insuring the victory of the Vietnamese 
revolution and the international revolution." 
Pham Van Dong in his speech marking the anniversary last year 
had quoted the passage in Ho's last will and testament on his 
pain at the discord among the fraternal parties. And at the 
31 August 1970 Hanoi meeting marking the 25th anniversary of 
the DRV's founding on 2 September, Pham Van Dong said that 
acting on Ho's "sacred" testament, "we have done all in our 
power to contribute to the restoration and consolidation of 
the solidarity of the socialist camp and the international 
communist and workers' movement . . . ." It is standard for 
Hanoi propaganda to pledge to work for the solidarity of the 
"socialist camp," and this pledge was recently reiterated 
authoritatively in the communique.of the VWP Central Committee 
19th plenum, publicized on 1 February 1971. 
THE FRONT Ho's birth anniversary was.also marked by a joint 
PRG-NFLSV-Alliance meeting on the 18th in "a 
liberated area" in the South. As at last year's meeting, the 
main address was given by PRG President Huynh Tan That, .and 
PLAF Deputy Commander Mme. Nguyen Thi Dinh also spoke. Phat 
that the anniversary was being marked in a "very spirited 
atmosphere when the revolutionary.liberation war of the three 
Indochinese peoples is gaining very.great successes . . . ." 
He reviewed "puppet" losses during the Laos incursion, and he 
said that the result and "gaps" on au battlefields had 
weakened pacification efforts. Phat prefaced a call to 
persevere in the struggle with the declaration that "no matter 
how the enemy may distort the truth, President Ho continues to 
be our sacred national image and the personification of our 
national unity . . . ."

Other attention to the anniversary included a special edition 
of GIAI PHONG, organ of the NFLSV Central Committee, and an 
anniversary message from NFLSV Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho and 
President Huynh Tan Phat to President Ton Due Thang, Le Duan, 
Truong Chinh and Pham Van Dong. Quoting Ho's saying that 
"nothing is more precious than independence and freedom, and 
so long as there is an aggressor in our country we will have 
to fight on to expel him from .the country," the message 
expressed the determination of the South Vietnamese armed 
forces and people, "closely united behind the NFLSV and PRG," 
to "constantly raise high their absolute revolutionary 
fighting spirit, to achieve at all costs the sacred testa-
ment of President Ho . . . ." 
HANOI PROTESTS U.S. STRIKES. REPEATS CALLS FOR VIGILANCE 
The latest in the continuing series of statements from the 
DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman came on 19 May with a protest 
against alleged U.S. action on the 17th.* The statement says 
that Tuong Lap village was bombed by U.S. aircraft, including 
B-52's, and that Vinh Son village was shelled by U.S. 
artillery based south of tilt; demilitarized zone. (VNA English, 
in an apparent mistranslation, rendered this passage "based 
in the southern part" of the DMZ.) The protest claims that 
also on the 17th, U.S. fighters attacked the Le Ninh state 
farm in Quang Binh Province and on the following day attacked 
Ky Phuong village in Ky Anh district, Ha Tinh Province. 
These attacks, it says "caused losses in lives and property." 
The spokesman routinely condemned the U.S. "criminal war acts" 
and demanded an end to all acts of encroachment on DRV 
sovereignty and security. 
VIGILANCE In addition to Nguyen Duy Trinh's reference on 
the 18th to "new military adventures" against the 
DRV, this theme recurs sporadically in other propaganda. An 
11 May QUM' DOI NHAN DAN editorial on increasing the combat 
strength of the local armed forces says it is necessary to 
* Hanoi has not acknowledged action-on 23 May when, according 
to the U.S. Command, fighter bombers and B-52's crossed the 
southern border of the DMZ to bomb suspected DRV rocket launch-
ing sites. The U.S. Command also reported that on the night 
of the 22d a U.S. F-105 fired a Shrike missile at an enemy WI 
site 12 miles north of the DMZ.

carry out this task in order to "readily smash all new military 
schemes" of the United States agaiast the northern part of our 
country. An 18 May NHAN DAN editorial as broadcast by Hanoi 
radio, on strengthening the militia and self-defense forces, 
claims that the United States "is plotting to make use of its 
air and ranger forces to bomb, strafe, and carry out surprise 
attacks by ground units against the northern part of our country. 
That is why our people and armed forces should be ready to 
fight and to annihilate the enemy." 
A discussion of how to combat "the enemy's heliborne attacks" 
appeared in a column on practical military matters serialized 
in QUAN DOI NHAN DAN from 21 to 24 April. In a possible 
allusion to the November Son Tay prisoner-rescue raid, the 
paper said that use of helicopters "to drop rangers and stage 
raids in the hinterland of North Vietnam is one of the craftiest 
and most reckless schemes of the American; and their lackeys"--a 
scheme aimed at destroying important military, political, and 
economic targets, "kidnapping cadres, seizing weapons, freeing 
pilot pirates, and sowing confusion among our people . . . ."

continues the aggressive war in Laos, the statements warn, 
the Vietnamese people will strengthen their solidarity with 
the Lao and Cambodian peoples and fight together until "total 
victory." 
The Vietnam Fatherland Front also sent a message to the NLHS, 
reported by VNA on 26 May, which hails the new proposals and 
praises the Lao people's "great victories." It expresses 
"indignation" over continued intensification and expansion of 
U.S. aggression in Laos which it says is "torpedoing" the 1962 
Geneva agremeents and preventing the Lao parties concerned 
from meeting. 
A 24 May VNA statement denounces Souvanna Phouma's 18 and 
19 May letters to the Geneva conference cochairmen and to 
the chairman of the ICC/Laos "on the so-called 'aggressive 
acts of North Vietnamese troops on Lao territory." VNA 
does not, of course, acknowledge that Souvanna Phouma was 
complaining about attacks on Pak Song on the Bolovens Plateau 
and on Muong Dong Hene in Savannakhet Province. VNA does 
not mention the latest NLHS proposal when it says routinely 
that Souvanna Phouma has Angaged in "brazen slander" to 
mislead U.S. and world opinion, which is demanding that the 
Nixon Administration put an end to intervention and aggression 
in Laos, ending the bombing of the whole terril.,ory of Laos 
as "an immediate step," so that the Laotians can settle their 
affairs themselves. 
PATHET LAO A 20 May NLHS Central.Committee spokesman's

A Pathet Lao Radio commentary of 24 May scores Souvanna Phouma 
for avoiding acceptance of the new proposal "under pressure

"slanderous propaganda" to cover up U.S. aggression.

SUPPORT press and radio comment, including propaganda on a 
week of solidarity with Laos which began on 17 May, 
the seventh anniversary of the inception of U.S. bombing of 
Laos. (A 22 May IZVESTIYA article says the solidarity week 
was called for by the ninth session of the Council of the 
Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, held in Tripoli 
last November.) The commentaries condemn the United States 
for expanding the wax in Laos and for trying to prevent a 
settlement, saying that peace contacts over the past year have 
failed because of "sabotage" by "U.S. militaiist circles and 
Laotian rea:tionaries." 
Some commentators, including Shchedrov in a 22 May PRAVDA 
article, accuse the United States of "rejecting" or maintaining 
silence on the new proposal while plotting a "new invasion" of 
Laos. But a 20 May domestic service commentary by Professor 
Mikhail S. Kapitsa is somewhat less negative. It says the 
proposal "could serve as a stimulus for gPtting the whole 
problem of a settlement in Laos moving again and restoring 
peace and a coalition government in that country," and it 
concludes that "it is now up to the Vientiane authorities and 
the Administration of the United States."

PRC FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
MAJOR CAMPAIGN MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF MAO'S MAY STATEMENT 
Peking has marked the first anniversary of Mao's 20 May anti-U.S. 
statement with a major propaganda campaign, highlighted by a 
joint editorial calling the statement a "brilliant_document of 
historic significance" that "has become a program for the anti-
imperialist struggle" by the Chinese together with revolutionary 
people throughout the world. Against the background of recent 
moves to improve relations with countries which have been the 
targets of Chinese enmity, Peking has used the anniversary as an 
occasion to reaffirm its commitment to revolutionary causes and. 
to give ample airing to Maoist ideology on the international 
scene. 
In view of Peking's practice of using milestone occasions for 
reaffirming fundamentalist doctrines and commitments, the 
anniversary propaganda does not seem to signal a reversal of 
recent Chinese efforts to broaden international contacts and 
to enhance the PRC's diplomatic and political leverage. 
Though Peking has taken the occasion to play up "the revolu-
tionary mass movement" in the United States and communist-led 
insurgencies in Southeast Asia, it has steered clear of 
bilateral issues bedeviling Sino-U.S. relations and has 
avoided attacking the SoutheaJt Asian noncommunist leaders. 
Peking has also taken care, while viewing developments in the 
past year as confirming the tenets contained in Mao's 
statement, to avoid direct claims that Maoist ideology is 
the guiding force behind these developments. 
The propaganda campaign on the anniversary suggests Peking's 
judgment of a need to reassure its clients and allies that it 
is not abandoning their cause and to preserve its revolutionary 
assets. In addition to the joint editorial, carried in 
PEOPLE'S DAILY, RED FLAG, and LIBERATION ARMY DAILY, the 
anniversary material has included articles by workers, 
peasants, and soldiers in PEOPLE'S DAILY on 20 May and a 
stream of reports on the state of the revolution in various 
areas of the world. Accounts of this sort have been issued 
by Peking around the turn of the year in the past, but this 
year Peking has timed them for the anniversary of Mao's 
20 May statement. Also on the 20th, Peking issued the 14942d 
"serious warning" to the United States, the first since 
22 April (Lenin's birthday).

INDOCHINA Mao's statement, issued on the day on which a 
session of the resumed_Sino-U.S. talks in Warsaw 
had been scheduled to take place, was prompted by the U.S. 
incursion into Cambodia and the formation of Sihanouk's 
government in exile. (Peking's 19 May 1970 announcement of 
the postponement of the Warsaw meeting cited "the increasingly 
grave situation" caused by the Cambodian operation.) Indochina 
has been prominent in the arniversary propaganda, as exemplified 
in the joint editorial's asso.rtion that at present Indochina is 
"the main battlefield in tha world people's struggle against 
U.S. imperialism." The editorial's claim that Washington's 
strategic plans in Indochina "have failed completely" is 
spelled out in detail in a 20 May NCNA account of how the. 
Indochinese have proven the "brilliant thesis" in Mao's 
statement that "the people of a cmall country can certainly 
defeat aggression by a big country." 
The NCNA account, noting that President Nixon has been 
"steadily expanding" the war in Indochina behind "the smoke-
screens of his empty talk of 'peace' and 'troop withdrawal," 
displays the mood of buoyant confidence that has marked 
Peking's assessment of the military situation in Indochina. 
In the past year, according to NCNA, the three Indochinese 
peoples have formed "a solid anti-U.S. united front" which 
has enabled them to win "victories of enormous strategic 
significance." Indicating that Peking's prescription is for 
more of the same in Indochina, the account concludes by 
quoting from Mao's statement calling on the Indochinese-... 
peoples to strengthen their unity and to persevere in "a 
protracted people's war." 
An effort to reassure the Indochinese and other anti-U.S. forces 
of Peking's backing seems reflected in a passage in the joint 
editorial insisting on "high vigilance" and warning that the 
United States will "make desperate struggles and even embark 
on a hazardous adventure." Pointing out that the danger of 
a new world war still exists, the editorial offers a notably 
pointed warning against letting down one's guard: "It is 
dangerous if we see only the raging revolutionary flames but 
not the enemy who is sharpening his knife, and think that .in. 
view of the excellent situation we can lay our heads on our 
pillows and just drop off to sleep."

MIDDLE EAST 
FBIS TRENDS 
26 MAY 1971 
Moscow continues to give only sparse coverage to develop-
ments in Egypt in the wake of President as-Sadat's purge 
of leaders in the government and the Arab Socialist Union 
(ASU). But Soviet concern seemed underlined in the 23 May 
announcement of the "unofficial friendly" visit by a Soviet 
delegation headed by Presidium Chairman Podgornyy and 
including Ponomarev. The announcement has been accompanied 
by a spate of Soviet propaganda effusively praising Soviet-
UAR relations and publicizing as-Sadat statements and Cairo 
press comment to depict deep Egyptian gratitude for Soviet 
aid, support, and friendship. Reminiscent of comment 
following Nasir's death last fall, Moscow recalls that 
Nasir viewed Soviet-Arab friendship as a permanent factor 
in the struggle for peace and expressed boundless gratitude 
to the Soviet Union. 
With the propaganda focus on Arab-Soviet relations, there 
is little comment on the current status of the Arab-Israeli 
dispute following Secretary Rogers' visit to the Middle 
East. But Belyayev, in the domestic service commentators' 
roundtable on the 23d, did complain that the Jarring'mission 
has practically been torpedoed and that the Big Four 
consultations have to all intents and purposes become 
sporadic--all the fault of the United States. He outlined 
what he called a "certain American variant" of a Middle 
East settlement which would "isolate" the Suez Canal ques., 
tion from the settlement problem. Arab public opinion, he 
claimed, is actively nosing this idea, insisting that the 
Suez reopening be part an overall settlement which would 
provide for "liberation" of all Arab territories and for 
accommodation of the Palestinian Arabs' just demands. 
Speaking at an 18 May lunchem for Canadian Prime Minister 
Trudeau, Kosygin expressed support for programs for 
political settlement put forward by Indochinese patriots 
and--in unusual phraseology-by "Middle East," not Arab, 
states. Hil subsequent remark that such programs open up 
"realistic" ways toward restoring peace in these regions 
was in line with routine propaganda praise for Cairo's 
constructive and realistic peace initiatives. An article 
by Ovchinnikov in the 23 May PRAVDA quotes without attribu-

quit foreign territories and that the peoples' right to 
independent development and to organization of their own 
domestic affairs must be respected. PRAVDA explains that 
this applies equally to Indochina and to the Middle East, 
where "the United States is currently using all available 
means to exert pressure directly or indirectly on the Arab 
countries" and attempting to "speculate on the role of 
self-styled 'mediator" while in fact obstructing a settle-
ment. 
PODGORNYY VISIT HIGHLIGHTS COMMENT ON STRONG TIES WITH CAIRO 
Identical announcements from Moscow and Cairo radios on 23 May 
of Podgornyy's visit to Cairo "in the next few days" at.as-Sadat's 
invitation were followed on the 24th by a MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY 
(MENA) report that the Soviet delegation would arrive on the 25th 
for talks on "the latest developments in the Middle East crisis." 
Podgornyy would be accompanied, MENA said, by Ponomarev, Gromyko, 
Deputy Defense Minister Pavlovskiy, and several aides and advisers.* 
Reports of the vieit were circulated in advance by correspondents 
of Arab media in dispatches from Cairo to their home offices: A 
report on the 22d to AN-NAHAR in Beirut said that Soviet Ambassador 
Vinogradov, meeting with as-Sadat on the 21st, raised the question 
of a visit soon of a Soviet delegation, probably led by Podgornyy. 
And dispatches to Syrian media on the 23d, prior to the official 
announcement, reported that Podgornyy's visit, to start on the 
25th, was expected to last three days. 
According to the 25 May AL-AHRAM, as reported by MENA, the sides 
will make a comprehensive review of the results of contacts and 
consultations held recently on the Middle East crisis, discussing the 
situation from military and political aspects, and will also cover 
Soviet-Egyptian military, political, and economic cooperation. 
AL4tHRAM added that the Soviet delegation's visit will not be 
restricted to any timetable. The paper also reported that Gromyko 
and the UAR ambassador in Moscow met on the evening of the 24th 
to discuss some of the issues to be raised in the Cairo talks. 
Moscow radio on the 24th merely cited the Cairo press as saying the 
* Podgornyy was in Egypt as recently as 13-19 January, heading a 
delegation attending commissioning ceremonies for the Aswan hydro-
power complex. Ponomarev had led a CPSU delegation to Egypt

government delegation led by 'Ali Sabri.

present Middle East situation as well as further Soviet-Egyptian 
cooperation will be discussed. 
A "preparatory meeting," as AL-ABRAM described it, was held by 
as-Sadat and Podgornyy on the 25th in what TASS called a "friend-
ly, comradely atmosphere." Formal talks began on the 26th. 
SKACHKOV Another Soviet delegation, led by Semyon Skachkov, 
DELEGATION chairman of the S.viet State Committee for Exter-
nal Economic Relations, arrived in Cairo on 
20 May to attend the launching of the first ship at the Alexandria 
shipyards, according to TASS. MENA reported that the delegation 
would hold economic talks during its four-day visit. TASS only 
briefly reported Skachkov's remarks at the Alexandria ceremony on 
the 23d, but MENA cited him as pledging continued Soviet aseistance 
to Egypt in its struggle to liberate the occupied territory. He 
pointedly expressed Soviet confidence in Arab victory in the . 
struggle against "the Israeli aggressors and against U.S. imperial-. 
ism" as well as confidence in the people's "adherence to their 
freedom along the course" set by Nair. Judging by MENA'e account, 
Skachkov made no reference to as-Sadat's most recent speech to the 
People's Assembly on 20 May but praised his May Day speech for 
stressing the USSR's friendship and firm stand alongside the UAR. 
MENA on the 24th reported a meeting between Skachkov and. Deputy
Premier and Industry Minister Aziz Sidqi to discuss "continuation 
of implementation of projects" agreed on during Sidqi's March . 
visit to Moscow to sign an economic and technical cooperation 
agreement. There appears to have been no indication in-materiel 
on that visit of any planned Skachkov trip, although AL4tHRAM On 
17 March had cited Sidqi as saying that Novikov would cote to 
Cairo in ,TIme to sign another long-term agreement.

AL-ABRAM is repeatedly quoted as declaring that the permanent 
and firm UAR-Soviet relations will remain unaltered in spite 
of efforts "in certain Western quarters" to drive a wedge 
between the two states. In the most explicit reference thus 
far to Western press reports of the pro-Soviet leanings of the 
dismissed Egyptian officials, TA9S on the 25th attributed to 
AL-AKHBAR the observation that "allegations of the Western press 
that 'supporters of the West won over supporters of the Soviet 
Union in the UAR' are nothing but an absurdity." 
BROADCASTS TO Prior to the announcement of Podgornyy's 
MIDDLE EAST visit, Moscow broadcasts in Arabic were 
already replete with assurances of Soviet 
friendship and support, depicting the Arab countries as con-
vinced that friendship and cooperation with the USSR are a 
"vital necessity" for them. A broadcast on the 17th claimed 
that Arab papers "stress the idea" in Brezhnev's 14 May Tbilisi 
speech that the Soviet Union is and will continue to be the 
"sincere and loyal friend" of the Arab peoples--a remark that 
Brezhnev in fact did not make in that speech. 
A commentary in Arabic on the 21st provided the first rebuttal, 
against the unspoken background of the events in Cairo, of 
Western and Zionist "clamor over the so-called Soviet influence 
on the Arab countries." It insisted that in offering great 
political backing and material assistance to the Arabs the 
Soviet Union does not set any prior conditions that might affect, 
even remotely, the national sovereignty" of the UAR. This line 
has been reiterated in other broadcasts to the MIddle East: A 
commentary in Persian on the 25th stressed.. that the Soviet Union 
is not seeking to obtain unilaterally any advantages for itself 
in the Middle East or any other part of the world since it har-
bors no covetous designs. And Turkish listeners were told on 
the same day that the USSR has given extensive political, military, 
and economic aid to the UAR without imposing conditions "and 
without intervening in its internal affairs." Podgornyy's visit, 
the commentary added, will undoubtedly help strengthen "peaceful 
and progressive forces" in the Middle East.

have underlined the role of the president, noting in an account 
of the first new cabinet meeting that governmental and ASU 
changes have been carried out "in keeping with decrees" issued 
by the president and mentioning that the ASU interim committee, 
meeting to discuss measures for reorganization, "was guided by 
the directions" of as-Sadat. On the 25th TABS reported that 
"in conformity with a decision" by President as-Sadat,.Aziz Sidqi 
will be acting ASU secretary general until the ASU's general 
national congress, scheduled to open 23 July. 
Journalists were told, PASS said, that as-Sadat at the cabinet 
meeting "touched on several questions of the country's internal 
situation" and again stressed that the country's foreign policy 
rests on no concessions regarding territory. or regarding 
Palestinian rights. TASS has also briefly reported the presi-
dent's decree on reorganization of all ASU organs on the basis 
of elections and his message empowering the People's Assembly 
to draft a permanent constitution of the Egyptian Arab Republic. 
PRAVDA's Cairo correspondent Glukhov, reporting on the UAR draft 
budget on the 23d, concluded that "progressive forces" in the 
UAR regard cuoperation with the Soviet Union as a guarantee of 
further successes on the road of progress. 
POLISH While available East European propaganda has.been 
COMMENT reticent with regard to the events in Cairo, one 
forthright assessment of the developments did 
appear in the Polish weekly POLITYKA, reviewed by PAP. on 
21 May. The paper observed that as-Sadat's present policy 
suits the aspirations, generally speaking, of all those who 
want to end the war with the help of the Americans or anybody 
else. Without explaining the current status of Jum'ah and 
'Ali Sabri, POLITYKA said it is not known what, forces they 
still have at their disposal; the article added that with AST?' 
influence still strong among the town population and students, 
"it cannot be precluded that counter..ction might be launched." 
Listing the aspirations of various segments of Egyptian society, 
POLITYKA concluded that as-Sadat has no easy. problem. 
practically everybody would like something else, and it pre-
dicted that, like Nasir, he would try to keep a balance which 
would satisfy each social group. One thing is certain, it 
said: The country has entered a period of "sharp internal 
struggle" which could have a great impact on its 'political 
and social system.

POLICY as-Sadat's 20 May speech to the National Assembly--
now People's Assembly--to his remarks on the Middle 
East conflict, predictably highlighting his statement that the 
UAR would never have made progress if it were not for aid and 
support "from our honest and sincere friend," the Soviet Union. 
Where as-Sadat reviewed the positions of the Big Four, TASS 
focuses on his remarks regarding the United States, noting in 
passing that he "went on to speak about the recent visit to 
Cairo by Secretary Rogers" and then quoting him as saying that 
Washington supplies the "Israeli aggressors" with everything 
from bread to Phantoms. TASS reports Egypt's reply to the 
United States on the reopening of the Suez Canal as outlined by 
as-Sadat, citing him as saying that Cairo has asked the United 
States to define its pouition and that if the U.S. Government 
really wants peace, pressure must he put on Israel if the cause 
of peace demands it. 
DOMESTIC The TASS account brushes off the second half of 
AFFAIRS the speech, on domestic affairs, with the obser-
vation that as-Sadat "indicated that he would not 
dwell on the events of last week, when several ministers and 
top officials of the ASU resigned." TASS does note that much 
of the speech concerned the drafting of a permanent constitution 
which as-Sadat said must lay stress on Arabism and defend the 
gains of socialism, and must envisage broader representation of. 
peasants and workers in all government bodies. The account does 
not, of course, refer to his statement that "currents are now 
sweeping this world under the guise of science and dragging 
peoples to fearful materialism in which all values and morals 
are lost; we cannot live without values and morals because this 
would be tantamount to not believing in our religion," 
ASU TASS does report that in concluding his address 
AFFAIRS as-Sadat said the ASU would be reorganized from top 
to bottom, with the People's Assembly performing 
the functions of the ASU Central Committee until its new member-
ship is elected. Moscow has naturally failed to make any mention 
of the ASU "secret organization" referred to by as-Sadat in both 
his 14 and 20 May speeches and reported in Cairo media as the

focal point of the "plotters." MENA on the 23d revealed that 
Jum'ah,"who was running the ASU secret organization," order-
ed the destruction of the organization's files. 
It may be recalled that Moscow for some years has referred 
sporadically to the need to create a "vanguard" grouping 
within the ASU composed of "progressive" Egyptians to guide 
the organization in the proper socialist, mass-oriented 
direction. An article in the March 1970 issue of the Russian-
language journal PROSPER, published in Alma-Ata, had.cited 
Jum'ah as saying it was necessary to have "an ideological 
framework, a form of political vanguard inside the ASU in 
the person of the apparat and activist group of the party," 
and that "the political apparatus is assigned the role of 
a vanguard political party of a socialist nature."** 
As opposed to Moscow's reticence on the status of Egyptian 
leftists, the British CP organ MORNING STAR addresses itself 
directly to the situation of the Egyptian communists in the 
course of a 21 May article listing "dangerous moves" against 
Middle East communist parties. In Egypt, the paper says, 
"communists are not at present being persecuted, bdt they 
have no legal right to form a communist party." It recalls 
that the former communist organizations dissolved themselves 
and that after release from prison, the "former communists" 
were allowed to play a part in building the new Egypt, but 
only as individuals. 
* LE MONDE's Eric Rouleau in a 15 May article said that Jum'ah 
made a secret trip to the USSR--in early February, according to 
a Lebanese press account of the incident--and that as-Sadat took 
this initiative "very badly," the more so since the Soviet lead-
ers had complained to Jum'ah that as-Sadat took diplomatic 
initiatives without consulting them, contrary to a gentleman's 
agreement concluded with Nasir.

TRUDEAU IN USSR

26 MAY 1971 
MOSCL4 REGISTERS SENSITIVITY TO IMPACT ON RELATIONS WITH MI 
Soviet publicity for Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau's 12-day 
visit to the Soviet Union, which began on 17 May, reflects 
evident sensitivity on the question of how developing Soviet-
Canadian relations may affect the USSR's relations with third 
countries, primarily the United States. Kosygin's speech on 
the 19th, the day the Soviet-Canadian protocol was signed, 
and subsequent Soviet commentaries have underscored the 
shared concern of hosts and guest expressed in the protocol, 
which provides for bilateral consultations at least once a 
year on "important international problems of mutual interest 
as well as questions of bilateral relations." These 
consultations, the document stipulates, have "no bearing on 
the earlier commitments of the sides in regard to third 
countries and are not aimed against any one of them." 
Speaking at a Canadian Embassy luncheon on the 19th, Kosygin 
declared that Soviet-Canadian cooperation in areas of mutual 
interest can be extended as a result of the "businesslike 
and friendly" talks, then hastened to add that this coopera-
tion "is not directed at anyone." It not only meets "the 
national interests of both sides," he said, but "simultaneously 
helps ease international tension and preserve peace." TABS 
gave prominence to this passage in reporting Kosygin's remarks. 
In a similar vein, in a Moscow radio talk broadcast widely 
beginning on the 20th, commentator Belobrov declared that the 
"important steps" taken by Canada and the USSR in the sphere 
of bilateral relations will not only promote the welfare of 
the two peoples but will "also help improve relations among 
all countries." This, Belobrov emphasized, is "a very 
important consideration." Other Soviet comment has made 
substantially the same point, though less sharply--for example, 
in likening the USSR's relations with Canada to relations with 
France in the interests of mutual advantage and the cause of 
peace. 
Soviet media's accounts of the Canadian Prime Minister's 
20 May press conference registered Moscow's sensitivity on 
the score of how the results of the visit could affect 
relations with the United States. A TASS account on the 20th

and a TASS-attributed report appearing in the central press the 
next day entirely omitted Trudeau's several remarks on the 
subject. According to Western news agencies, Trudeau said his 
visit had been prompted in part by a judgment that it will be 
increasing4 important for Canada to diversify its contacts 
with "significant world powers" because of the "overpowering 
presence" of the United States. This judgment, he said, is 
reflected in a "growing consciousness among Canadians of a 
danger to our national identity." Pointing to Canada's 
independence in foreign policy, he reportedly commented that 
the Soviet-Canadian protocol on mutual consultations does not 
imperil Canada's relationship with the United States through 
membership in NATO and NORAD, and he found an analogy to 
Canada's approach to the Soviet Union in Bonn's Ostpolitik 
and the U.S. negotiations with the Soviets in SALT. He 
also denied that he was acting as an intermediary for the 
United States in Moscow. 
The Soviet accounts of the press conference reported only 
Trudeau's explanations of certain aspects of the newly 
signed protocol, his reference to Kosygin's acceptance of 
an invitation to visit Canada, his remarks on his discussion 
with Brezhnev and Kosygin of the Soviet proposal on 
reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, 
and his expression of interest in developing and exploring 
the Arctic regions. TASS quoted him to the effect that 
Canada and the Soviet Union "see eye to eye" on the last 
point. 
While Moscow would nave been expected to defer to Trudeaut.-. 
concern for the U.S.-Canadian relationship, it might also 
have been expected to capitalize on the visit in some measure 
to promote the stereotyped propaganda picture of Western 
disunity and alienation of the United.States' allies. But 
the thrust of Moscow's comment has been precisely to offset 
any view of Soviet courting of Canada as an exercise in 
traditional Soviet politicking designed to isolate the 
United States or to maneuver in the context of the Sino-
Soviet-U.S. triangular relationship. Viewed alongside other 
recent Soviet moves, notably in.SALT and.in connection with 
possible negotiations on force reductions in Central Europe, 
the treatment of the visit emerges rather as an effort to 
.enhance an image of Soviet readiness to negotiate .across a 
broad front--bilaterally and.mult:laterally--with "business-
like" objectives in view.

STRATP3 IC ARMS LIMITATION 
MOSCOW PLAYS MI-SOVIET ANNOUNCEMENT IN LOW KEY 
Moscow's domestic service at 1600 GMT on 2( May carried as the 
third item in its newscast the text of the ;joint U.S.-Soviet 
announcement t,nat the two countries have agreed to concentrate 
their efforts this year at the strategic arms limitation talks 
(SALT) on an accord limiting the deployment of antimissile 
defense systems and to work toward "certain measures" limiting 
strategic offenz.ive arms. TASS subsequently trensmitted the 
announcement, and PRAVDA carried it on an inside page on the 
21st. 
Initially, in releasing the announcement, Soviet media did 
not mention that President Nixon read it in Washington. The 
next day, however, a TASS roundup of favorable foreign 
reaction noted that the President "in his radio and TV 
speech" called the agreement "a very important event." The 
same TASS item--which appeared in PRAVDA on the 22d--reported 
that U Thant said the agreement "can prove to be an important 
step forward in the complex and prolongEd talks" ad that 
numerous U.S. Senators had reacted favorably. 
On the 23d, participants in the domestic service commentators' 
roundtable show reviewed the joint announcement and described 
foreign reaction as "overwhelmingly" positive. Commentator 
Belyayev linked the results at SALT with Brezhnev's 14 May 
initiative on force levels in Europe, saying that these 
developments show the beneficial nature of the USSR's 
suruggle for peace and against war. Beyond this obse vation, 
Moscow has not originated any comment. 
EAST EUROPE All of Moscow's East European allies have 
reported the announcement, and comment is 
available from all but Sofia and Bucharest. Warsaw domestic 
service commentaries on the 20th noted the relative speed 
with which an agreement was reached, and a TRYBUNA LUDU 
article reviewed by PAP on the 22d challenged Washington to 
match its words Iiith deeds. PAP also quoted GLOS PRACY for 
the observation that "the fairly optimistic initial views" 
on SALT were not unfounded, with the "impasse" on the talks 
now broken. A 25 May TRYBUNA LUDU article reviewed by PAP 
observed that missile-equipped submarines, nuclear-armed

stage of negotiations, adding that.in this connection "some 
experts point out that even in the event of a possible 
conclusion of initial agreements, the arms race and the 
perfecting of armaments will go on." 
Prague's CTK on 21 May, noting that the House Armed Services 
Committee has approved funds for further development of the 
Safeguard ABM system, complained.that-this action is "in 
contrast to the recent Soviet-American announcement on 
progress" at SALT. A Budapest broadcast to Westerh Europe 
on the 21st viewed the U.S. acquiesence in the announcement 
as an effort to quiet domestic opposition. In the words of 
the commentary, the domestic opposition to the Nixon Adminis-
tration is exerting such pressure that the President, "to 
strengthen his position, definitely needs to show progress 
in a question of decisive importance." SiMilarly, an East 
Berlin domestic service commentary on 21 May said that the 
United States accepted the "Soviet initiative" only because 
"it had become aware of the changed power ratio in the 
nuclear field and because of increased public presSure."

USSR CLAIMS SUPPORT FOR BREZHNEV PROPOSAL, IMPUGNS U.S. STAND 
Moscow continues to claim widespread favorable reaction to the 
Brezhnev proposal of 14 May to "start negotiations" on the 
reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. A 
domestic service commentary on the 21st, for example, said 
that "the world public is devoting a great deal of attention" 
to the proposal and that "not a single newspaper" has opposed 
it. The commentary also noted Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau's 
remarks at a Moscow.press conference the previous day that 
Canada "will carefully weigh what can be done" to implement the 
proposal. A participant in the 23 May domestic service 
commentators' roundtable show cited AFP for the report that the 
foreign ministers of 10 West European countries,meeting.in 
Paris on 18 May to discuss Common Market.questions, "expressed 
satisfaction with Brezhnev's initiative .and characterized 
it as a gesture of good will." The panelist went.on to cite 
Senator Mansfield as believing that the United States, 
instead of merely studying this "significant" proposal, "should 
react to.it.in a positive manner and set a concrete date for 
a start of the talks." 
Soviet commentators have taken note of West German Chancellor 
Brandt's initial reaction to the Brezhnev proposal. Among others, 
a Grigoryev article in PRAVDA on the 23d said Brandt has declared 
that the proposal "merits great attention." FRG resistance to 
the proposal, according to Grigoryev, "is to be observed, as 
always," in the ranks of the CDU/CSU and among the Bonn generals. 
Soviet media have not so far been heard to mention FRG spokesman 
Ahlers' 21 May statement that Bonn believes talks on.force 
reductions "could not be independent of the negotiations over 
Berlin." 
Consistent with Moscow's failure to acknowledge that Ambassador 
Beam had met with Gromyko on.17 May to explore.the Brezhnev 
proposal, low-level propaganda has pictured the United States 
as reluctant to engage in serious.talks. Thus a 20.May TASS 
report concluded that Administration pressure to.block Senate 
passage of the Mansfield resolution calling for a 50-percent 
reduction in U.S. troop strength in.EUrope "cannot but call 
into question the sincerity of statements of American .leaders 
concerning their interest in a reciprocal reduction of armed

forces in Europe," A domestic service report on 23 May declared 
that the United States "not only does not wish to reduce its 
troops in Europe, but is also bringing pressure to bear on its 
NATO partners with a view to forcing them to increase military 
preparations within the framework of the bloc." And a foreign-
language commentary by Glazunov on the 24th questioned the 
sincerity of U.S. interest in talks when Secretary Laird has 
indicated he will raise the issue of NATO's military capa-
bilities at the Ministerial Council session in Lisbon on 3-4 June. 
Reporting the opening on 25 May of a two-day meeting.of.NATO's 
Nuclear Planning Grour (NPG) in Mittehwald, West Germany, a 
Moscow domestic servi6e.talk asserted that .the alliance is "not 
only not rejecting the wild .plans kr making use of weapons of mass 
destruction in Eurole, but is.interding .uo give an even more 
dangerous.character.to these.plans." The broadcast called 
such plans particularly "absurd" when the European public "has 
given broad approval to the important initiative" of the USSR. 
PEW DEPARTURES FROM SOVIET LINE IN EAST EUROPEAN COMMENT 
All of Moscow's East European allies have essentially followed 
the USSR's lead in treating the Brezhnev proposal. With the. 
notable exception of Romania, they have stressed widespread 
favorable responses and in varying degrees.have cast doubt on 
U.S. sincerity. Bucharest, which reported the proposal in a 
straightforward manner, has so far offered no comment but has 
continued to press its own call for withdrawal of troops from 
foreign territories. 
Unlike Moscow, some East European sources hsl-e acknowledged the 
17 May meeting between Ambassador Beam and Foreign Minister 
Gromyko to discuss the proposal. A Bratislava radio commentary 
on the 17th, for example, said .Bam has been instructed "to 
start soundings" on the Saviet initiative. And Budapest's 
NEPSZAVA on the 19th said that the United States has not 
openly rejected Brezhnev's proposal, instead resorting to the 
"diplomatic step" of having Beam request a meeting with Gromyko. 
Pointing to Senator Mansfield's support for the proposal, some 
East European comment has gone beyond Moscow's in noting that 
he has suggested that talks could begin as early as June. 
NEUES DEUTSCHLAND on the 20th, for example, said Mansfield has

urged the President to accept the proposal "and to begin talks 
as early as June." Prague's ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY said on the 17th 
that Mansfield has indicated the talks could start "at the 
beginning of June." 
At least one East European commentary has brought up the question 
of an asymmetrical reduction of U.S. and Soviet forces in Europe, 
a long-standing NATO proposal which Moscow has opposed. An 
article in the Bratislava PRAVDA on the 18th said this "maneuver" 
is based on the claim that U.S. forces would have to withdraw 
across the Atlantic, whereas Soviet troops would remain closer 
to Europe because of geography. Such a "trick" involving a 
disproportionately large Soviet troop reduction would in fact 
strengthen the position of both NATO and the United States, 
the paper argued.

ROMAN IA 
CEAUSESCU TO VISIT ASIAN CONMUNIST CAPITALS IN JUNE 
The Romanian press on 20 May frontpaged an announcement that 
President Ceausescu will lead a party and government delegation 
to Peking, Pyongyang, and Hanoi in June. As if to avoid giving 
unduly provocative prominence to the Peking leg of the tour, 
the announcement contained three paragraphs of equal length 
on the projected visits, each noting Ceausescu's acceptance 
of an invitation from the respective cJpital. The order of 
the paragraphs--the PRC first, North Korea second, and North 
Vietnam last--may indicate the order of the itinerary. 
No specific dates were cited; the announcement said Ceausescu 
will go to China "early in June," to North Korea "in the first 
half" of June, and to North Vietnam "soon." It mentioned no 
other visits or stopovers, but Ulan Bator's MONTSAME news 
agency reported on the 24th that a delegation lad by Ceausescu 
will "arrive in the MPR in the second 10-day period of Juno." 
The vagueness about the timing may indicate that some details 
have yet to be arranged or that Ceausescu wants to maintain 
as much flexibility in his itinerary as possible. 
The groundwork for the tour was evidently laid by Deputy 
Premier Radulescu, who visited Peking and Hanoi In November 
1970 and made a trip to Peking in March of this nazi Apart 
from the bilateral aspects of the visits, the inclusion of 
both the DPRK and the DRV on the itinerary--both neutrals 
In the Sino-Soviet dispute--will enable Bucharest to underline 
its policy of good relations with "all" the socialist 
countries, to mute any appearance of capitalizing on Sino-
Soviet rivalry, and to enhance its image as honest broker 
in the cause of unity. 
So far, Soviet media have not mentioned the announcement of 
the tour.

and technological aid to Chile. Almeyda is currently on a 
tour of the Soviet bloc seeking closer cooperation with the 
socialist countries. According to AGERPRES, the Chilean 
minister was received on the 21st by President Ceausescu 
and Premier Maurer; he later had talks with his Romanian 
counterpart, Manescu, as well as with Foreign Trade Minister 
Burtica and Minister of Mining, Oil, and Geology Almasan. 
Also on the ?1st, Ceausescu gave a dinner in Almeyda's honor 
and stressed the common goals of the two countrieo in seeking 
"national independence and cooperation among all states." 
In response, Almeyda was effusive.in his thanks for Romania's 
"generous receptivity" tm 'hile's problems and expressed 
confidence th....t the twt tries are on "an ample and 
promising road toward . -*hening their relationship on 
the basis of mutual adT . 
The communique on the v carried.by AGERPRES, registers 
similar warm sentiments : yting that the talks were 
"conducive to full under E 4ding" and.expresses the two 
sides' "determination to develop relations on all levels--
political, ewnomic, technical-scientific, and cultural--
based on full equal rights and mutual esteem, trust, and 
advantage." It adds that "concrete projects of industrial 
cooperati-n" were agreed upon and that the two sides are 
working out the details "by which Romania can grant Chile 
loans for some of these projects as well as for the purchase 
of Romanian equipment and machinery." The two parties 
defined "concrete domains" in which Romania will grant Chile 
technical assistance that will contribute to Chilean develop-
ment on a mutually advantageous basis, the communique says, 
noting that cooperation in the mining.and copper industries 
will continue. The results of the talks are in keeping with 
Almeyda's definition of the purpose of his Soviet bloc tour, 
as quoted in an AGERPRES account of a press conference for 
Romanian and foreign correspondents.on the 22d: He hoped, 
he said, "to define the domains of cooperation in the common 
interest." 
On more general topics, the joint document upholds each 
country's sovereign right to. dispose of its natural.resources 
and emphasizes a need to eliminate discriminatory practices 
from economic relations between states. It also calls.for 
the PRC's.admission to the United Nations and points to the 
importance.of the establishment of diplomatic relations between

The communique makes no mention of either the Soviet Union or 
the United States. It does, however, condemn "the aggression 
in Southeast Asia" and call for the withdrawal of "aggressor 
troops." And AGERPRES, reporting the 22 May press conference, 
quoted one passage in which the Chilean foreign minister took 
a direct swipe at the United States. Answering a question on 
the political situation in Latin America, according to 
AGERPRES, Almeyda said that "the principle of noninterference 
in the internal affairs of other states is gaining ground 
while the interventionist policy.as practiced by the United 
States against Cuba and the Dominican Republic has fallen 
into disrepute." He reportedly.added that "an external 
military intervention in Chile is.impossible, but economic 
and financial pressures might occur." 
BACKGROUND Against the backdrop of continuing efforts to 
lessen its dependence on the Soviet Union for 
its raw materials and to resist Soviet pressures for CEMA 
integration, .Romania has been cultivating good relations with 
Chile since the reestablishment of.full diplomatic relations 
in June 1965. Vice Premier Radulescu visited Chile in 1968. 
In the past few years the two countries have been cooperating 
in the mining industry, and last September they concluded an 
agreement to create a joint stock company for constructing 
two copper refining plants. According to the agreement, one 
plant would be built in each country and each would have a 
51- to 49-percent holding in the company on its own territory. 
Romania moved to capitalize on possibilities of further 
improving its ties with Chile aftce Allende's advent to 
power, sending Radulescu and Deputy Foreign Minister 
Macovescu to Santiago for the inaugural ceremonies in November. 
An article in the party daily SCINTEIA on 12 April, hailing 
the victory of Allende's Popular Unity coalition in the 4 April 
municipal elections, pointed to "the significance of this success 
f5r Chile's economy and for the nationalization of Chile's basic 
resources.

CZECHOSLOVAK PARTY CONGRESS 
HUSAK THANKS SOVIETS. ALLIES FOR 1968 INTERVENTION 
In his most abjc:, puL.,:ic gesture to date, Gustav Husak used 
the occasion of his rejort to the opening session of the 14th 
Czechoslovak Communist Party Congress on 25 May to thank 
Brezhnev by nrnA and the other visiting Warsaw Five leaders 
collectively for invading the country in August 1968. At 
the same time, the CPCZ leader characteristically discoursed 
at length on the culpability shared by Novotny's pre-1968 
leadership for the problems that developed after Dubcek's 
takeover as First Secretary--an aspect of the Czechoslovak 
situation that has consistently been played down in Soviet 
propaganda. 
The congress was opened with a brief, general speech by 
President Svoboda, and the honor of welcoming the visiting 
party delegations by name and conducting the procedural 
voting.fell to CPCZ Presidium member and secretary Vasil 
Bilak. The ultraconservative Bilak, who had preceded Husak 
as Slovak CP first secretary in the preinvasion period and 
was the target of liberal attacks for allegedly colluding 
in the invasion, was singled out for lavish praise by both 
Husak and Slovak CP First Secretary Lenart at the congress 
of that party on 13-15 May 1971. 
Heretofore, Husak has shown notably less zest for the 
subject of the invasion than the ultraconservatives of Bilak's 
stripe. He did not publicly endorse the intervention as a 
positive phenomenon until his speech on a visit to Moscow in 
October 1969--six months after his election as CPCZ First 
Secretary. He did not express public gratitude for the

A lengthy TAGS summary of Husak's.speech on the 25th followed. 
the lines of past Soviet treatment of his speeches by ignoring. 
his remarks on the pro-January 1968 period,.focusing.instead 
on the Dubeek.era and the achievements under Husak's.stewardship 
since April 1969 in "normalizing" the situation. TAGS reports 
in detail Husak's personal thanks.to,Brezhnev and the other 
visiting East European leaders for the invasion and also singles 
out his attack on "the Chinese leadership," leveledin_connection 
with praise for the results of the 1969 Moscow international 
party conference. 
The initial TABS report of Brezhnev's speech. to the Prague 
congress on the 26th puts the CPSU leader on record as "fully 
sharing" the appraisal of the 1968-69 events set forth in. the
"Lessons" document and the CPCZ Central Committee report. 
delivered by Husak the day before. Citing "the high prestige 
now enjoyed in the world communist movement by the CPCZ and its 
leaders--comrades Gustav Husak, Ludvik Svoboda, and other 
unbending fighters for the. causo. of socialism," Brezhnev 
declared that "no one will be able to sever Czechoslovakia 
from the socialist camp." 
WARSAW FIVE SEND TOP LEADERS, ROMANIA LESSER FIGURE 
The Warsaw Five demonstrated.their.solidarity in the 19.68. 
intervention, and. endorsement of Husak's leadership by all 
sending their party first secretaries to the Czechoslovak - 
congress, where only the CPSU and SED.were represented at.. 
tWtlevel at the 13th CPCZ Congress in 1966. The Polish, 
Hungarian, and Bulgarian parties were represented only by 
Politburo-level figures--Ochab, Nemes, and Velchev, 
respectively--in 1966. 
Romania and Yugoslavia underscored their disapproval_of the 
Czechoslovak "normalization" by.lowering the level of their 
representation from that of 1966. Romania sent Popescu, a 
member of the RCP Executive Committee but not of the elite 
Permanent Presidium. Yugoslavia sent Gazi, a member of the 
45-member LCY Presidium, equivalent to only a Central Committee 
member. In 1966, Bucharest sent Permanent Presidium.member 
Birladeanu (since purged), and Belgrade sent LCY Executive 
Committee member and Premier Stambolic.

While the French CP is again represented, as in 1966, by a

demonstrated its.hostility.to_the Czechoslovak events by 
lowering its representation, from Politburo. to Central 
Committee level. The Cuban.party and.the-NFLSV raised the 
level of their delegates this. time from. Central Committee. 
to Politburo members--Blas. Roca and Nguyen Van Hieu,

SOVIET COMMENT ENVISIONS FURTHER "NORMALIZATION" 
Comment in Moscow media on the. eve of.. the Czechoslovak party 
congress credited Husak with having achieved a degree of . 
normalization" and expressed confidence that he would 
intensify the.process. The.day before the congress opening,. 
a Volgi_ mmentary in the Moscow domestic service noted 
that after Husak's leadership was elected in April 1969, 
"the communists- , . managed.to.normalize the situation. 
in the social life of the country," consolidated the economy, 
and "reestablished relations. of mutual. trust and cooperation 
with the CPSU." It said the congress, "completing a 
complicated and difficult period.", in the.CPCZ's life, 
would "analyze the past stage," make an "all-round examination 
of the present level of development of the socialist society," 
and work out "a real program for the further successful 
development of the CSSR." 
An article in PRAVDA on.22.May.by Chief Editor Valenta.of 
the CPCZ journal ZIVOT STRANY recalled that "party training 
in 1969," after Huaak's takeover,."did_not embrace the_whole

CPCZ plenum had stressed that "the rightists, who have not

the main political danger." This. fact, the article added, 
"presupposes well-thought-out offensive political and

"Czechoslovakia has paid_dearly in the recent past for

USSR INTERNAL AFFAIRS 
HONORARY POLITBURO NOMINATIONS TO REPUBLIC SOVIETS ANALYZED 
In late April and early May, the republican newspapers reported 
on nominc5.tions for deputies to the supreme soviets of the union 
republics, to be elected 13 June. All Politburo members except 
the five who hold regional posts--Grishin, Voronov, Shelest, 
Kunayev, and Shcherbitskiy--were given honorary nominations in 
most of the republics. Many of the press reports of such 
nominations included standardized epithets of praise such as 
"prominent state figure" and "true son of the party"; the 
application of these epithets varied considerably in different 
republics, suggesting preferences for individual leaders. 
The pattern of preference, both in regard to epithets and 
number of nominations, tended to remain the same as for the 
April-May 1970 nominations in the union republics for the 
USSR Supreme Soviet, with no significant change in Brezhnev's 
favor. In fact, Armenia is the sole republic reporting praise 
only of Brezhnev this year; Kirgizia and Azerbaydzhan, which 
last year reported praise only of Brezhnev, this year provide 
epithets for Podgornyy and Kosygin as well. 
Georgia and Tadzhikistan seem to slight Brezhnev. The 
Georgian press accounts of local nominations report less 
praise for Brezhnev than for Podgornyy and Kbaygin. 
Podgornyy is called an "important party and state figure" 
and "skilled, energetic leader," while Kosygin is termed 
a "prominent state and party figure." The most complimentary 
thing said about Brezhnev is that he is a "brilliant example 
of serving the cause of Lenin, the Communist Party, and the 
interests of the people." (Gec-gian First Secretary 
M6havanadze is himself portrayed as a "glorious son" of 
the people). In 1970 also, Brezhnev had been slighted in 
Georgia. While all three leaders had been named "true 
Leninists" (as was Mzhavanadze), Kosygin had also been 
termed an "important political and state figure," 
Podgornyy a "prominent state figure," and Brezhnev a 
"brilliant example." 
Tadzhikistan rates both Brezhnev and Kosygin as "prominent 
figures of the Communist Party and Soviet state" and 
Podgornyy and Shelepin as "true sons" of the party, while

others recPive no epithets. In 1970 the Tadzhiks had appeared 
to rate Shelepin even higher, calling him a "true son of :the 
party and people, a prominent state figure," while Brezhnev 
was termed a "true son of the Communist Party and Soviet 
people" and Podgornyy a "true son of the party and people." 
Podgornyy appears to be downgraded in Kazakhstan and Lithuania. 
The Kazakh reports reserve the titles of "true Leninist" and 
"outstanding figure" for Brezhnev and consistently attach 
lengthier, higher ranking epithets to Kosygin than to Podgornyy. 
While Podgornyy is given credit only for being a state figure, 
Kosygin is occasionally labeled a state and political figure. 
Podgornyy's highest tribute ("prominent state figure") is no 
higher than that applied to Polyanskiy ("prominent state and 
party figure") or Pelshe ("prominent party figure"). Kirilenko, 
Suslov, Kunayev, and Kulakov are each categorized as "one of 
the prominent figures" of the party. The lineup in 1970 
was similar: Brezhnev was the only "outstanding" leader, 
while Kosygin and Podgornyy were "prominent state figures" 
(with Kosygin receiving slightly more extensive descriptions). 
Suslov was a "true Leninist," Voronov "a prominent figure of 
the party and Soviet state," and Pelshe and Kuuayev "oue of 
the prominent" party and state leaders. 
Lithuania rates Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Kirilenko as "outstanding" 
political and state figures and Podgornyy only as a "prominent 
political and state figure." It did not report epithets in 1970. 
As it did in 1970, Belorussia appears to discriminate against 
Kosygin, who is praised less often than Podgornyy and credited 
only with being a state leader. Brezhnev is called an 
"outstanding party and state figure" four times; Podgornyy 
is labeled an "outstanding party and state figure" twice and 
a "prominent party and state figure" three times; Kosygin is 
called an "outstanding state figure" once and a "talented 
-state figure" once. Suslov, Polyansk!y, and Mazurov are 
labeled "prominent" figures, while Kirilenko is called a 
"true sor of the party." In 1970 Brezhnev had been a 
"prominent figure of the international Communist movement" 
and "true Leninist," Podgornyy a "prominent figure," Suslov 
a "brilliant example," and Mazurov a "principled leader." The 
highest compliment Kosygin had rated was as an "example" in 
serving the cause.

Latvia appears to place Podgornyy and Kosygin, ab best, on a par 
with Suslov and native son Pelshe. Brezhnev is repeatedly 
labeled an "outstanding" figure and a "true Leninist," Suslov 
a "prominent political and state figure" and "true Leninist," 
and Pelshe a "prominent party figure" and "staunch Leninist"; 
Podgornyy and Kosygin are called "prominent political and 
state figures." Brezhnev had also been the only "outstanding" 
figure in 1970, while Pelshe was a "true Leninist" and "prominent 
figure" of the party and state, Kosygin a "prominent Soviet state 
figure," Kirilenko a "true Leninist," and Podgornyy only a 
"brilliant example." 
Reports on nominations from the Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Moldavia, 
and Turkmenia contain no epithets for the Politburo members. 
'BREZHNEV TREATED WITHOUT 'EFFUSION AT GEORGIAN FETE 
At Georgia's 50th anniversary ceremony on 14 May, Brezhnev was 
treated with proper respect but not as effusively as at the 
August Kazakh anniversary, the October Azerbaydzhan anniversary, 
or the November Armenian anniversary. Georgian First Secretary 
Mzhavanadze--who has displayed coolness in the past - -introduced 
Brezhnev with far less enthusiasm than the Kazakh, Azerbaydzhan, 
and Armenian first secretaries had at their ceremonies. Instead 
of labeling Brezhnev an outstanding figure of the party, state, 
and international Communist movement, and heaa of the Central 
Committee, Mzhavanadze simply introduced him as "our good friend, 
our dear comrade, our militant party leader" (PRAVDA and ZARYA 
VOSTOKA, 15 May). He mentioned Brezhnev without praise a few 
times in his own speech, and at the end of Brezhnev's speech 
Mzhavanadze thanked him for his "very brilliant, deep, and 
comprehensive speech." Unlike the Azerbaydzhanis, the Georgians 
did not elect a presidium consisting of the Politburo "headed 
by" Brezhnev. 
The speeches by representatives of Moscow, Leningrad, and the 
other republics tended roughly to follow past patterns in 
their treatment of Brezhnev. The least enthusiastic about 
Bre7%nev were Estonian First Secretary Kebin (the only one who 
did not even mention Brezhnev), RSFSR First Deputy Premier 
Shkolnikov and Armenian First Secretary Kochinyan (both of 
whom mentioned Brezhnev's 24th congress report but without 
comment), and Lithuanian First Secretary Snechkus (who 
described Brezhnev's Tbilisi speech only as "penetrating").

Slightly warmer were Turkmen First Secretary Gapurov, who 
labeled Brezhnev's speech "deeply comprehensive," and Ukrainian 
First Secretary Shelest, who called it "remarkable." Half of 
the 16 regional speakers (the first secretaries of Moscow, 
Leningrad, Belorussia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaydzhan, 
and Latvia, as well ao Tadzhik President Kholov) used the term 
"brilliant" plus other adjectives for Brezhnev's Tbilisi 
speech or his 24th congress report. The most flattering to 
Brezhnev were the first secretaries of Uzbekistan, Azerbaydzhan, 
and Kirgizia, who described Brezhnev's 24th congress report as 
an important theoretical document of creative Marxism-Leninism, 
and the Moldavian first secretary, who spoke of Brezhnev as the 
"leader of the Communist Party and state." 
MENTION Apparently the Stalin issue could not be completely 
OF STALIN avoided in the dictator's Georgian homeland. 
Mzhavanadze mentioned Stalin's name twice, but 
without comment. Brezhnev steered a middle course, citing Stalin 
as one of Georgia's "prominent revolutionaries" but also 
mentioning the struggle against "the cult of personality" 
(PRAVDA and ZARYA VOSTOKA, 15 May). In the live Tbilisi broadcast 
of his speech, Brezhnev put Stalin at the head of the list of 
historical Georgian figures, and the mention of Stalin's name 
was greeted with prolonged applause; in the PRAVDA and ZARYA. 
VOSTOKA versions of Brezhnev's speech, Stalin's name came fifth, 
and it was followed by the same "applause" indicator as each of 
the other names. 
The only other speaker to mention Stalin was Azerbaydzhan First 
Secretary Aliyev, who declared that "we are proud of the fact 
that in the ranks of the glorious revolutionary army of Baku 
workers" there grew up as "Marxists-Leninists and organizers 
and political leaders of the masses the remarkable sons of the 
Georgian people Joseph Stalin, Alesha Dzhaparidze," and so forth. 
Aliyev had also invoked the name of Stalin--as one of the 
"pupils and comrades-in-arms" of Lenin--in his report at his 
own republic's anniversary (BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY, 3 October 1970). 
Armenia's Kochinyan in his Tbilisi speech also named several 
"outstanding sons" of the Georgian and Armenian peoples, but 
he did not mention Stalin.

Li Hsueh-feng, not named to the new secretariat, has not

celebrating National Day. Long a top CCP organizational 
specialist, he helped in organizing previous National People's
