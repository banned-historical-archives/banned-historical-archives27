 LEBANON
 Syria intervened: openly in the Lebanese
 crisis last weekend by sending Syrian
 regular forces across the border into
 Lebanon. Since April 9, approximately
 4,000 to 6,000 Syrian army troops have
 been moved into eastern Lebanon and an
 tUNDOF
 t - ZONE
 aotg?Ii
 area in Syria adjacent to the border along
 the Damascus-Beirut road.
 This. force consists of major elements, of
 three armored and, infantry, brigades?
 most of them apparently from the 3rd Ar-
 mored, Division. One of Syria's four SA.-6
 antiaircraft missile brigades, with about
 500 men, also has been. sent to the border
 area. The Syrian. forces inside Lebanon
 are positioned primarily in the Al-Masna
 area along the road to Beirut;: some have
 moved as far west as the Baylor, Pass, ap-
 proximately 15 miles from the capital.
 Israeli public reaction to: the Syrian
 troop movements has been. low-keyed.
 The government-controlled press has
 noted the entry of large numbers of
 regular Syrian forces. into, Lebanon, but
 has suggested that Israeli: forces will' take
 action, only if Syrian troops are sent. into
 the area south of the Litani: River on a
 scale that would alter the security situa-
 tion along Israel's northern border.
 Syria's move into Lebanon was intend-
 ed initially to force parliament to follow
 through with its plans to amend the con-
 stitution to permit the early replacement
 of President Franjiyah. In addition, it was.
 designed to force the leftists. to. extend: the
 truce, and to prevent any attempt by the
 leftist, Muslim, or Palestinian militias. to
 launch a new round of heavy fighting.
 Parliament on April 10 did approve the
 constitutional  amendment,  leading
 Lebanese leftist leader KamalJ-umblatt to.
 announce on April I I that the left had
 agreed to extend the truce until April 30
 Jumblatt, however, added to his con-
 ciliatory statement demands that Syrian
 forces withdraw from Lebanon and that a
 new president be elected within 10 days.
 Jumblatt and his major Palestinian
 backers appear for the moment to have
 been intimidated by the Syrian show of

 force. They will. work at least indirectly,
 however, to increase military pressure on
 the Christians if the current round of
 political negotiations stalls. (An. analysis  25X1

 The expected resumption of oil produc-

 Gulf Oil Company will probably initial-

 Residents of Bethlehem prepare to put up a banner for municipal elections in the West Bank
 Palestine Liberation Organization.
 Many of the victorious "nationalist"
 slates appear to be made up of politically
 diverse individuals ranging from members
 of traditionally conservative clan factions
 to radicals sympathetic to the PLO. These
 men appear to have little more in com-
 mon than their recent agreement to run
 together and to try to attract the widest
 possible spectrum of votes.
 Leftist-oriented slates won majorities
 on the councils of two of the West Bank's
 three most populous towns-Nabulus and
 Ram Allah-and in a number of smaller
 towns. In Hebron a mixed group of leftist
 sympathizers and conservatives gained
 control. Conservatives won in one major
 town-Bethlehem-and appear to have
 gained majorities in several smaller com-
 munities.
 The strong showing by candidates sym-
 pathetic to the PLO represents a protest
 against the continuing Israeli occupation
 and is a setback for Tel Aviv's policy of
 supporting traditionalist, pro-Jordanian
 council candidates.
 The election results also represent a
 defeat for Jordan's King Husayn, who
 had privately backed pro-Hashemite can-
 didates.  The new nationalist councilors
 will be more inclined to look to the PLO
 and its allies rather than Husayn for sup-
 port against the Israelis.
 During the next two weeks, the new
 SECRET
 councils will each convene to name one of
 their  members,  usually  the highest
 vote-getter, as mayor. A large number of
 nationalists will probably be chosen.
 Israeli occupation officials can veto these
 selections and appoint mayors more to
 their liking, but Defense Minister Peres,
 responsible for administering the West
 Bank, has said that the decisions of the
 councils would be accepted unless there
 was a "legal reason" for doing otherwise.
 Israeli intervention in the mayoral elec-
 tions could ignite a new round of an-
 ti-Israeli demonstrations in the West
 Bank similar to those that occurred in
 February   and   March

 USSR-US    21     3
 Moscow is clearly concerned about the
 heated debate in the US over "detente,"
 despite repeated professions of confidence
 in Soviet media that the US public
 overwhelmingly favors improved relations
 with the USSR. The Soviets are likely to
 show increasing caution on important
 bilateral issues until after the US election
 campaign is over and the direction of US
 policy is assessed.
 Although the Soviets continue to
 profess optimism that bilateral relations
 will improve after the US elections, a note
 of caution was sounded early this month
 by Georgy Arbatov, Moscow's most in-
 fluential academic expert on the US.
 Writing in Pravda, Arbatov warned that
 policy compromises made during the heat
 of a political campaign may persist
 beyond the elections and could "create
 serious difficulties." He joined other com-
 mentators in explicit criticism of Presi-
 dent Ford and his administration.
 The current campaign of harassment
 against Soviet citizens and installations in
 the US is one vexing irritant that has
 produced concern at top levels in
 Moscow. Soviet leaders have been
 somewhat mollified by vigorous official
 condemnations of anti-Soviet violence,
 but they  remain unconvinced that
 Washington is sufficiently serious about
 punishing culprits who "make no secret of
 their involvement."
 The Soviets decided to retaliate against
 US officials in Moscow despite the
 possibility that this might further damage
 "detente." In the last few days Moscow
 has reduced the level of harassment, but
 Soviet officials have indicated the practice
 will continue as long as the situation in the
 US remains unresolved.
 The generally gloomy cast of US-
 Page
 Soviet relations was somewhat relieved
 last week with completion of a joint
 draft text governing the detonation of
 peaceful nuclear explosions under the
 previously negotiated threshold test ban
 treaty. Conclusion of these lengthy
 negotiations indicates Moscow remains
 committed, despite current difficulties, to
 stabilizing its relations with the US, es-
 pecially  on  matters  relating  to  the
 strategic balance.
 On the other hand, the Soviets now
 appear to have less hope of early agree-
 ment on a new strategic arms limitations
 agreement or on other key issues such as
 the trade/emigration impasse. The latter
 is only infrequently mentioned in the
 Soviet media, while recent Soviet
 statements on SALT have avoided men-
 tion of a time frame or a possible summit.
 21-2
 Political maneuvering continues to
 point to an early parliamentary election,
 although all party leaders are trying to
 avoid responsibility for precipitating the
 contest.
 The Socialists, whose abstention in
 parliamentary votes permits the Moro
 government to survive, reaffirmed this
 week their demand for either an election
 or the replacement of Moro by an
 emergency government with an economic
 program that would be negotiated with
 the Communists. Socialist leader De
 Martino has failed, however, to muster
 broad support for his proposals, and the
 Socialists are hesitating to topple Moro
 on their own.
 The Communists, who have consistent-
 ly opposed an early election, are propos-
 ing an emergency program that would be
 supported by all the parties except the
 neo-fascists. They claim this approach
 would permit the present parliament to
 remain in office until May 1977, when
 elections would normally be held. If the
 contest takes place ahead of schedule,
 Communist chief Berlinguer will blame
 the Christian Democrats for failing to
 accept his offer to help solve the country's
 problems.
 At this point, the decision rests with the
 Christian Democrats, who, as usual, are
 divided over what to do. Party conser-
 vatives, who appear to favor an election,
 want Moro to pave the way by resigning
 immediately. The Christian Democratic
 left, led by Moro and party chief Zac-
 cagnini, prefers a parliamentary debate
 leading to a confidence vote on the
 government's economic program. This
 would force the Socialists either to aban-
 don their threat or to accept responsibility
 for the government's fall.
 The economy, meanwhile, continues to
 reflect the deteriorating political situa-
 tion, with the lira plunging to record lows
 this week. It has since rebounded slightly,
 but the currency will remain weak as long
 as political uncertainty persists. Inflation
 is running at an annual rate of 30 percent,
 and additional price hikes can be expected
 as the costs of imports rise.
 The austerity program that Moro
 proposed to deal with these problems has
 soured the government's relations with
 Italy's powerful labor unions.  In an
 emergency meeting last week, the govern-
 ment was unable to persuade labor to ex-
 ercise restraint in the current wage talks.
 CYPRUS  - C , - 2 7
 The search for a Cyprus settlement suf-
 fered a major setback last week with the
 resignation of Greek Cypriot negotiator
 Clerides. This in turn precipitated Turkish
 Cypriot negotiator Denktash's announce-
 ment that he would no longer participate
 in the talks.
 The immediate cause of Clerides'
 resignation was his admission that he had
 secretly agreed to give Denktash advance
 notice of Greek Cypriot proposals for a
 settlement. A more fundamental reason

 for his forced departure was the growing
 dissatisfaction of more intransigent Greek
 Cypriot leaders with what they considered
 to be Clerides' willingness to make con-
 cessions without reciprocal gestures from
 the Turkish Cypriots. Clerides' successor
 will be Tassos Papadopoulos, who is ex-
 derides    OC_T
 pected to be more responsive to the hard
 liners.
 Denktash contributed to Clerides'
 downfall by revealing the secret agree-
 ment and leaking the fact that Clerides
 hadgiven him a preliminary version of the
 Greek Cypriot proposals. The Turks may
 have concluded that if the seemingly con-
 ciliatory Clerides could be disposed of,
 their own basic intransigence would not
 stand out so starkly. Furthermore, any
 successor to Clerides would probably, in
 their  view,  more  accurately  reflect
 President Makarios' basic lack of give
 on the issues, thus justifying a slower
 pace in the negotiations.
 Following   Clerides'    resignation,
 Denktash  rejected Greek Cypriot
 proposals dealing with the territorial
 question and  said he would appoint a
 subordinate to represent Turkish Cypriots
 in future negotiations.
 Clerides may yet retain his position as
 president of the Cypriot  House of
 Representatives, but his public disgrace
 has made it easier for extremist leaders to
 reassert themselves. The latter lost little
 time sponsoring a series of anti-American
 demonstrations to protest the new US
 military assistance agreement with
 Turkey.  A  large and  potentially
 dangerous demonstration on April 12 was
 brought under control only by vigorous
 police action and after both Washington
 and Athens had warned the Makarios
 government of its responsibility for main-
 taining order.
 SPAIN  2   --- 3 )
 Efforts by Basque terrorists to bring
 pressure on the government by inten-
 sifying their campaign of violence appear
 to have backfired.
 The murder last week of a kidnaped in-
 dustrialist by Basque Fatherland and
 Liberty terrorists provoked a general out-
 cry, particularly in the Basque country,
 where some 15,000 turned out for the
 funeral service. There are, in fact, in-
 dications that the terrorists have damaged
 the Robin Hood image that had won for
 them at least the passive support of a
 large number of Basques.
 The Christian Democratic - oriented
 Basque Nationalist Party, which probably
 represents the majority of Basques, spoke
 out for the first time against the terrorists.
 The self-proclaimed Basque "government
 in exile"-composed of the Basque
 Nationalist Party and other regional
 groups-also condemned the murder and
 called  off anti-government protest
 demonstrations scheduled for Easter Sun-
 day.
 The government, meanwhile, struck
 hard at the terrorists. In a week of intense
 police activity, nearly 100 suspected
 members and collaborators of the
 terrorist group have been arrested, in-
 cluding several who have been charged
 with the murder of the kidnaped in-
 dustrialist. A dozen terrorist hideouts and
 large quantities of ammunition and
 propaganda have also been uncovered.
 The government may have further un-
 dermined  popular support for the
 Page             4
 terrorists by exercising restraint in con-
 ducting its anti-terrorist campaign and
 avoiding the harsh repressive methods and
 arbitrary mass arrests of the Franco era.
 The presence in considerable strength of
 the national civil guard, however, is
 resented by the Basques, who regard it as
 a virtual "foreign army of occupation."
 Two apparently innocent persons have
 already been killed by nervous civil
 guards, and more deaths could easily wipe       25X1

 WEST GERMANY
 The West German cabineftas decided
 to go ahead with production of the mul-
 tirole combat aircraft, now clubbed the
 Tornado. The cabinet's decision must be
 approved by the Bundestag, but passage is
 expected.
 Of the two other participating coun-
 tries, the UK announced its decision to
 produce the aircraft in late March, but
 there has been no formal announcement
 from Italy. The West German decision
 may speak for the Italians, however, since
 Bonn is already paying the relatively
 small Italian share of MRCA develop-
 ment costs.
 Rising costs and engine problems over
 the last few years raised doubts that the
 MRCA would ever reach series produc-
 tion. The huge investment already made,
 however, weighed heavily in the final deci-
 sion to produce.
 Bonn's share of the MRCA program is
 $6.2 billion out of a total cost of over $13
 billion. The unit cost of MRCA now is
 projected by the West Germans at $10.6
 million-more than double the original
 estimate in 1970 of $4.6 million-but even
 the new price is probably understated. We
 believe it does not include spare parts,
 ground support equipment, and research
 and development costs; these would bring
 the cost to over $19 million per airplane.
 The cost of the closest comparable US
 fighter, the F-I11, is about $15.6 million.
 The MRCA program is about four

 CIEC: THIRD ROUND PREVIEW
 The third round of the Conference on
 International Economic Cooperation that
 begins in Paris on April 21 will be the
 most difficult yet.
 The February and March sessions of
 the four working commissions, par-
 ticipated in by 19 developing and 8 in-
 dustrialized states, were largely
 procedural. Contentious issues were
 avoided. The Energy Commission will
 now examine the world-wide impact of oil
 prices,  something OPEC states have
 resisted, while the Development Commis-
 sion tackles the question of the debt
 burden of developing states.
 The Raw Materials Commission will
 discuss a series of papers drafted by the
 developing countries that reiterate the de-
 mand for an integrated commodity
 program, involving a common fund to
 support markets for various products.
 The Finance Commission will continue its
 examination of investment by OPEC
 states.
 The approach of the UN Conference on
 Trade and Development, which opens
 May 5 in Nairobi, will be in the back of
 everyone's mind. Both the industrialized
 and developing countries want to make at
 least a show of progress in Paris, before
 UNCTAD.
 Most EC members and Japan believe
 that a modicum of success in Paris would
 decrease the chances of a row in Nairobi.
 They fear a collapse of the Nairobi talks
 for a number of reasons, most immediate-
 ly because it might interrupt the talks
 between oil producers and importers in
 the Paris economic cooperation con-
 ference. Political and economic con-
 straints, however, will limit these in-
 dustrialized  states'  ability to  make
 specific concessions.
 Those among the 19 developing states
 in Paris that still feel there is some hope of
 eventually achieving developing country
 goals in Paris will want to convince the
 other developing states that the Paris
 forum, as well as UNCTAD, can be rele-
 vant to their interests.
 Others believe there is little hope left
 for progress in the Paris meetings and
 want to increase the concentration on
 UNCTAD. In any case, even those states
 that favor the economic cooperation con-
 ference will want to avoid giving the
 appearance that the Paris sessions are
 "settling" issues that will be covered by
 has taken over 20 lives.
 On April 13 and 14, terrorists set off a
 number of powerful bombs near the
 headquarters of the First Army Corps in
 Buenos Aires, killed one Argentine ex-
 ecutive of a US-based firm, and fired on
 the home of another, killing his two
 security guards.   In dealing with the
 renewed violence, the junta must walk a
 fine line between seeking to carry out
 Videla's pledge to keep the anti-terrorist
 effort within legal bounds and doing what
 is necessary to suppress the violence.
 The activities of the right-wing vigilante
 groups are particularly troublesome for
 the junta. It was widely believed that such
 actions were condoned, or perhaps even
 inspired, by the Peron administration.
 There is in fact no indication that the new
 government condones the killings of lef-
 ? tists by off-duty police and security of-
 ficials.
 Even so, the exploits of vigilante groups
 could quickly dissipate the relative good
 will the public has shown the military
 government. The junta needs all the sup-
 port it can muster at home and abroad to
 proceed successfully in critical areas like
 the economy.

 CUBA   4d -4
 An attack by Cuban exiles on two
 Cuban fishing boats last week has evoked
 a strong note of protest from Havana. It
 is likely to be the major theme of Cuban
 ceremonies on April 19, marking the an-
 niversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion in
 1961.
 The incident, in which one fisherman
 was killed and several reportedly were
 wounded, gives the Castro regime a
 nationalistic issue to exploit at a time
 when much of the population remains un-
 settled about the costs of the Cuban in-
 tervention in Angola.
 Castro, who has frequently taken ad-
 vantage of the Bay of Pigs anniversary to
 launch verbal attacks on the US, is not
 likely to pass up this opportunity to justify
 Cuban support for "anti-imperialist" ac-
 tivities anywhere in the world.
 He used a similar incident in May 1970
 to belabor the US and divert public atten-
 tion from his government's failure to meet
 an important economic goal.
 Much of what is said by Castro or other
 speakers on April 19 will probably be in-
 tended primarily for the Cuban people.
 Havana's domestic radio broadcasts, for
 example, have charged the US with "evi-
 dent complicity" in the exile raid, but the
 protest note to the US stopped well short
 of such an accusation.
 Its language, instead, suggests that
 while Cuban officials at the policy level
 may have dismissed US threats as mere
 saber-rattling, they are concerned that the
 threats might be interpreted by exiles as a
 license to carry out paramilitary activities
 against Cuba unham red b US law en-
 forcement agencies.

 Rallies marking the dismissal of Teng
 Hsiao-ping and the appointment of Hua
 Kuo-feng as premier and first vice chair-
 man of the party over the past week
 seemed designed to convey an image of
 popular support for the change in leader-
 ship. The Chinese people have not reacted
 enthusiastically to the changes, however,
 and some Chinese diplomats have ex-
 pressed uncertainty and concern.
 Many provincial officials who had not
 previously lent their public support to the
 anti-Teng campaign, including some who
 themselves were under attack, took part
 in the rallies. These officials doubtless are
 now anxious to disassociate themselves
 from Teng, but their prominent role
 suggests that they are not currently under
 serious political pressure and that the
 campaign will not spread to other political
 moderates.
 The military, which had earlier seemed
 to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, held its
 own rallies for the first time since 1971.
 The sudden emergence of the military in a
 political connection suggests that leading
 military figures may have played an im-
 portant role in piecing together the ap-
 parent compromise decisions. It is likely
 that political pressure against the
 military, a prominent feature of Chinese
 politics in recent years, will now case.
 The failure, on the other hand, of
 China's leading leftists to appear publicly
 since the announcements suggests they are
 not entirely satisfied with the outcome of
 the anti-Teng campaign and points to
 continued disunity in the upper echelons
 of the party.
 Hua Kuo-feng's ability to bring the
 divided leadership together and to head a
 coalition government effectively remains
 a question. He does not appear to have a
 power base of his own and lacks the ex-
 perience  and  long-standing  ties
 throughout the hierarchy that Chou
 hn-lai and Teng Hsiao-ping had.
 Although Hua's political roots are in
 Hunan, Mao's home province, he does
 not seem to be personally close to the
 Chairman.  Leading leftists, who may
 have hoped to win one or the other of
 Hua's new jobs, may now harbor some
 resentment toward him.
 Hua will have to strike a balance
 between  pursuing  relatively  moderate
 policies and giving sufficient weight to the
 left's interests, a delicate task for which
 Hua  is as yet untried.
 THAILAND     l7
 Intensive negotiations for a new
 parliamentary coalition government have
 dominated the Bangkok political scene
 this week. According to Democrat Party
 leader Seni Pramot, who is expected to
 head the new government, a tentative
 agreement has been reached between his
 center-based party and the rightist Thai
 Nation, Social Justice, and Social
 Nationalist parties. It is a coalition that
 would command a comfortable 74 percent
 of the seats in the lower house of the
 National Assembly.
 The announcement of a new govern-
 ment could come as early as April 16,
 when the newly elected National
 Assembly meets, but a number of hurdles
 remained to be overcome at midweek.
 There are indications, for example, that
 younger members of the Democrat Party
 oppose including the Thai Nation Party in
 the coalition. If they, or rank-and-file
 members of other parties, block formal
 party ratification of the coalition, the
 process of putting together a new govern-
 ment could drag on for several more
 weeks. (A projection of what diplomatic
 course a new government might take is in-
 cluded in a more general analysis of Thai
 foreign policy which begins on Page 9).

 The stakes for Asad in his Lebanese venture are
 high. Should he get even more bogged down in his
 mediatory effort than he is now, his power position in
 Syria itself could come under serious challenge.
 Syrian President Asad's prestige
 abroad and political strength at home
 appeared two months ago to have reached
 it new high as a result of his mediation in
 Lebanon.  Now, having used Syrian
 regular forces to rein in Lebanese leftists,
 Asad finds himself more vulnerable
 domestically than perhaps at any time
 since he came to power five and a half
 years ago.
 Ironically, Asad's Lebanese policy has
 drawn fire from both conservative Sunni
 Muslims and left-wing Baathists because
 he has been forced by circumstances to
 assume the role of protector of the
 Lebanese Christians. More importantly,
 his fairly evenhanded policy has en-
 countered at least some resistance among
 Syrian military officers, the mainstay of
 his regime. Many of the officers strongly
 sympathize with the Lebanese leftists and
 also fear Israel's reaction to a larger-scale
 Syrian intervention.
 Should Asad succeed in getting Syrian
 mediation back on track in Lebanon,
 much of the present opposition to him
 could quickly fade. By the same token,
 should he become mired down even more,
 his opposition would become correspon-
 dingly greater.
 The Opposition

 president, Asad has always had to con-

 elite.
 Many Sunnis also hold highly visible
 and  ostensibly important government
 posts. Prime Minister Ayyubi, Foreign
 Minister Khaddam, Minister of Defense
 Talas, and armed forces chief of staff
 Shihabi, for example, are all Sunnis.
 In 'fact, however, the Sunnis remain
 effectively cut off from real power and are
 resentful of the domination of Asad's
 small Alawite sect.
 It is not surprising that there is concern
 in the Asad government that the con-
 fessional strife in Lebanon might spill
 over into Syria.
 Several weeks ago a regional security
 chief, an Alawite with close ties to the
 Asad family, was assassinated in Harrah,
 apparently by members of the Muslim
 Brotherhood. Since then, there have been
 reports of other attacks on Alawites,
 possibly also by the brotherhood. That
 group serves as the cutting edge of conser-
 vative Sunni opposition to the regime. We
 do not know how many members the
 Muslim Brotherhood has.
 The government has moved quickly to
 avert the kind of serious civil unrest the
 brotherhood was able to touch off in

 several Syrian cities a few years ago.
 Several  hundred  people,  including
 members of locally prominent Sunni
 families, have reportedly been detained
 for interrogation. Sunni religious leaders
 have been warned not to stir up trouble
 with the Alawite community.
 Asad's handling of the  Lebanese
 problem appears to have raised the hopes
 of some of his staunchest opponents that
 he will give them an opening they can ex-
 ploit to bring him down. Doctrinaire
 Baathists, both within the Syrian party
 and in exile, for example, oppose Asad for
 deviating from Baathist ideology and for
 relegating the party to a secondary role in
 policy making.
 Asad also has enemies among the
 Alawites, a result of his manipulating
 rivalries among various Alawite factions
 in the army and Baath party to take
 power. He and his brother Rifaat are
 widely  believed  responsible  for the
 assassination in  1972 of Muhammad
 Umran, an influential leader of a rival
 Alawite group.
 External Subversion
 Another potentially serious threat to
 Asad conies from Iraq. The two rival
 Baath regimes have long been at odds,
 and the dispute between them has become
 more open over the past year.
 Some members of the Syrian Baath
 party, and doubtless some military of-
 ficers as well, would be willing to support
 an Iraqi-sponsored coup attempt against
 Asad.  Syrian  authorities  reportedly
 arrested several   hundred pro-Iraqi
 Baathists and some military officers a
 year ago, allegedly for plotting against the
 regime.
 Baghdad also maintains ties with exiled
 Syrian  Baathists in  Beirut,  including
 Salah Bitar, one of the founders of the
 Baath party. The exiles in turn maintain
 their own contacts inside Syria.
 We know little about either the Iraqis'
 or the Syrian exiles' activities inside
 Syria, but we believe they could not
 succeed in a coup against Asad without
 the support of powerful elements of the
 Syrian military.
 Asad's Strength
 Balanced against his opposition are the
 still formidable forces Asad can count on
 to protect his government.  Foremost
 among these are his brother Rifaat's
 Defense Companies, with 20,000 men and
 several hundred tanks. Asad's nephew
 also commands a militia of about 10,000
 men.
 Asad is a skilled political operator who
 would be difficult for even the most deter-
 mined opponents to outmaneuver. By ob-
 taining prior Baath party approval for last
 week's Syrian statement on Lebanon,
 Asad adeptly maneuvered the party into
 publicly supporting his policies in
 Lebanon and implicitly condemning the
 Lebanese leftists for perpetuating the
 fighting and undermining Syrian media-
 tion efforts.
 The continued incremental introduction
 of Syrian regulars into Lebanon and the
 recent Syrian naval blockade of Tripoli
 also seem carefully calculated to tighten
 Asad's grip on the leftists and Palestinians
 in Lebanon without provoking the kind of
 opposition from his senior military com-
 manders that a much larger, open in-

 With communist regimes now established in the
 three Indochina states, Thailand is slowly reverting to its
 traditional policy of balance of power diplomacy.
 Thailand: New Foreign Policy Directions
 With t e with rawal of US forces from
 Vietnam and the communist victories in
 Indochina, the Thai have concluded that
 the new power alignments emerging in
 Southeast Asia make it imperative that
 Thailand put its own foreign policy on a
 new footing. For much of the last two
 decades, Bangkok has relied almost ex-
 clusively on its close relationship with the
 US to protect its interests. Now, it is
 returning by fits and starts to something
 more like its traditionally neutral posture.
 Not all members of the Thai political,
 intellectual, and military elites are of like
 mind on how to proceed. Many civilian
 politicians, journalists, and intellectuals
 believe that, given domestic opinion in the
 US, Bangkok can no longer expect much
 assistance from the US if Thai security is
 seriously  threatened.  Relatively few
 among the military, on the other hand,
 seem to have seriously addressed the ques-
 tion yet, and many seem to cling instinc-
 tively to the hope that the US would come
 to Thailand's aid should the need arise.
 Different Perspectives
 Thai Foreign Ministry officials and
 military officers agree that Thai foreign
 policy must be reshaped to deal with a
 more powerful and assertive Vietnam.
 Where they part company is over the
 residual value of a continued military
 relationship with the US and over the
 speed with which Thailand should move
 to a more evenly balanced and neutral
 policy.
 To the civilians who inherited political
 power following the collapse of the
 military regime in October 1973, the US
 military presence not only served as a
 symbol of a policy that had outlived its
 usefulness, but also as an uncomfortable
 reminder of the extremely close US work-
 ing relationship with Thai military
 regimes during the 1960s. It was a
 relationship that effectively barred the
 Foreign Ministry from all important
 Thai-US security negotiations and in
 general relegated it to a back seat role in
 the foreign policy decision-making
 process.
 These bureaucratic jealousies apart, the
 Foreign Ministry does appear genuinely
 to believe that the continued presence of
 US security installations in Thailand
 severely undermines Thailand's ability to
 come to terms with Laos, Cambodia, and
 Vietnam. By asking all US military per-
 sonnel to leave Thailand, the Khukrit
 government was signaling Thailand's in-
 tention to accommodate, rather than con-
 front, the new communist regimes on its
 borders. At the same time, the Foreign
 Ministry-most notably Under Secretary
 Anan Panyarachun, who until recently
 was Thailand's ambassador to the
 US-has been recommending that
 Thailand begin hedging its bets by placing
 greater emphasis on its relationship with
 Peking.
 Anan and  others  in  the  Foreign
 Ministry argue that Peking is the only
 major power in a position to limit North
 Vietnam's influence and believe that
 Thailand can effectively exploit the
 animosity that has long characterized
 Peking-Hanoi relations. Anan came away
 from the talks in Peking last July con-
 vinced that the Chinese are prepared to
 try to limit Hanoi's influence in Southeast
 Asia.   Indeed,   Bangkok's  improved
 relationship with Peking has already paid
 a diplomatic dividend in the form of a
 generally improved atmosphere between
 Thailand and Cambodia, a development
 in which the Chinese played an important
 behind-the-scenes role.
 Even though military and civilian of-
 ficials share the belief that relations with
 China ought to be improved, few, if any,
 are willing to rely on China to protect
 Thai security. The military agree on the
 need to move Thai foreign policy away
 from its close identification with the US,
 but they balk over attempts to eradicate
 the security relationship entirely. In fact,
 the present US withdrawal has been a
 wrenching experience for the Thai
 military. Thailand will soon be without a
 major US military presence for the first
 time since 1961.
 The Thai military is concerned that
 with American troops gone, US interest
 in Thai security will fade, along with the
 US military assistance program. The
 military does not believe that China or
 any other major power is a practical al-
 ternative source of arms supply. Aside
 from this primary consideration, senior
 military leaders also maintain that a
 military relationship with the US, even if
 the US has ruled out further direct
 military involvement in Southeast Asia,
 gives Thailand important diplomatic
 leverage in dealing with essentially hostile
 Indochinese regimes.

 Implications of the Election
 The results of the national elections on
 April 4 suggest that the Khukrit
 government's policy of pushing for the
 withdrawal of all US military forces and
 installations will, at a minimum, be re-ex-
 amined. The political climate in Thailand
 would probably not allow any govern-
 ment, civilian or military, to seek a return
 to the days of a large US military
 presence, but there does seem to be grow-
 ing support for preserving at least vestiges
 of the US-Thai security relationship.
 A Seni Pramot - led coalition govern-
 ment would probably not turn Thai policy
 on a US military presence completely
 around-it was Seni who first called for
 their removal over a year ago. He has,
 however, indicated a willingness to recon-
 sider the military's  position before
 reaching any conclusions. Mindful that
 the military's estrangement from Khukrit
 over the US military presence issue cost
 Khukrit his seat in the parliament, Seni
 may at least keep the door open for a
 small US
 presence if it
 in Thailand's nationalistic political cli-
 mate.
 Such a policy would not rule out con-
 tinued efforts to improve relations with
 Hanoi, although Thai leaders probably
 realize that any apparent backtracking by
 Bangkok on the question of a US security
 presence would diminish the prospects
 of any early accommodation with Viet-
 nam.
 Whether or not the new Seni govern-
 ment chooses to take a different tack on
 the question of a US security presence,
 the long-term direction of Thai policy
 seems reasonably clear. Thailand is mov-
 ing step by step to put more distance
 between itself and the US, although there
 is considerable disagreement at each stage
 on how wide the distance should be, on the
 speed of the change, and on how it should
 be handled.
 The Thai will probably continue to
 move toward a closer relationship with
 China. There is little objection to this even
 from military conservatives, particularly
 when Peking is offering some support to
 Bangkok as it copes with pressures from
 Hanoi. The Chinese already have made it
 clear that a scaled down residual US
 security presence in Thailand would not
 stand in the way of further progress in
 developing relations between Bangkok
 and Peking.
 Finally, any new government in
 Thailand will continue to put its lines out
 in as many directions as practical,
 developing contacts with Europe, the
 USSR, Japan, and its ASEAN neighbors,
 hoping  that the multiplicity  of
 relationships will provide the necessary
 underpinning for a more balanced and
 neutral position.

 As the dispute over the future status of FTAI
 intensifies, Moscow is caught between protecting its
 substantial stake in Somalia and trying to improve its
 standing with Ethiopia.
 USSR-Somalia-Ethiopia: FTAI Policy
 The dispute between Somalia and
 Ethiopia over the French Territory of the
 Afars and Issas confronts Moscow with a
 policy dilemma. Moscow for long has
 been  Somalia's  principal military
 benefactor. At the same time, it has tried
 to get closer to Ethiopia, particularly
 since the late Emperor Haile Selassie's
 overthrow. Should war between
 Mogadiscio and Addis Ababa over the
 FTAI break out, the Soviets would be
 faced with some difficult policy choices.
 In order to preserve their signficant
 strategic stake in Somalia, they would
 probably have little choice but to support,
 albeit reluctantly, their clients in
 Mogadiscio.
 In the meantime, Moscow is attemp-
 ting to balance its relations with Somalia
 and Ethiopia by steering a careful middle
 course on the FTAI. In recent conver-
 sations with US embassy officials in
 Mogadiscio, Soviet Ambassador. Sam-
 sonov reaffirmed Moscow's desire for a
 peaceful resolution of the dispute. He said
 the Soviets favor self-determination for
 the territory and oppose outside in-
 terference by anyone, including Somalia.
 Moscow is said to have conveyed these
 views privately to Mogadiscio. The
 Soviets are cautioning the Somalis to
 limit their activities in the territory to in-
 surgency and political subversion, urging
 them to avoid rash actions that almost
 certainly would lead to war with Ethiopia.
 The Soviets have promised to work
 behind the scenes with Addis Ababa and
 Paris to fashion a satisfactory political
 settlement that would satisfy both Somali
 and Ethiopian interests.
 Such a peaceful settlement will be hard
 to achieve. Earlier this month, President
 Siad refused to give Paris a formal
 guarantee that Somalia would respect the
 sovereignty of the territory after it
 becomes independent. Mogadiscio has
 subsequently lambasted France for refus-
 ing to allow "genuine self-determination"
 in Djibouti and warned that Paris will be
 responsible for any deterioration of the
 situation in the territory, which is current-
 ly quiet. Anti-French forces might stage
 incidents to coincide with the visit to
 Djibouti of an OAU fact-finding com-
 mittee later this month. We expect

 crease as the decolonization process
 moves ahead.
 Siad attempted to use his recent
 month-long visit to the USSR to drum up
 Soviet diplomatic and military support
 for a more aggressive Somali policy
 toward the territory. Siad and his armed
 forces chiefs met with a number of senior
 Soviet military and political leaders in
 Moscow. The Soviets may have agreed to
 provide Mogadiscio with some additional
 military equipment, but the absence of a
 joint communique at the close of Siad's
 visit suggests that the Somalis may have
 received less than they wanted.
 Somalia's ambassador to France, said
 to be close to Siad, recently told US em-
 bassy officials in Mogadiscio that the
 FTAI issue had indeed been discussed
 with Soviet officials during Siad's
 Moscow visit. While shedding no light on
 the substance of the discussions, the am-
 bassador claimed that Somalia expects
 little diplomatic or military help from the
 Soviets because of Moscow's desire not to
 jeopardize its present good relations with
 either Ethiopia or France. The failure last
 week of Soviet Deputy Defense Minister
 Kulikov to visit Mogadiscio, after wind-
 ing up a six-day visit to neighboring
 Sudan, may have been another manifesta-
 tion of Moscow's displeasure with Siad's
 adventurism in the FTAI.
 The Soviets have apparently been more
 successful in convincing Ethiopia of their
 good intentions toward the FTAI than in
 restraining Somali designs on the
 territory.  Ethiopia's  ambassador  in
 Moscow recently remarked that the

 Soviets seemed to share Addis Ababa's
 desire for an independent FTAI and did
 not appear sympathetic to Somalia's am-
 bition to annex the territory.
 The ambassador also appeared con-
 vinced of the sincerity of Moscow's desire
 for better relations with Ethiopia. He
 cited a major Pravda commentary highly
 favorable to Ethiopia, which appeared
 while Siad was in Moscow. He interpreted
 it as a signal that the Kremlin did not
 want Siad's unusual month-long stay or
 his saber-rattling speech at the Soviet par-
 ty congress to damage Soviet-Ethiopian
 relations.
 Despite the USSR's close military,
 economic, and strategic ties with Somalia,
 the Soviets realize that Ethiopia is poten-
 tially the strongest power in the Horn.
 Moscow has avoided following a policy
 line that would deny to the Kremlin the
 possibility of making substantial inroads
 in Ethiopia.
 Political developments in Addis Ababa
 over the past year, particularly the ruling
 military council's recent sharp tilt to the
 left, have only served to give the Soviets
 more interest in not foreclosing options.
 Moscow clearly regards the military
 regime in Addis Ababa as being on a
 "progressive"  course  and as  holding
 Two months after the abortive coup by minority
 tribesmen, Nigeria's national leadership is virtually para-
 lyzed by mutual suspicions and renewed ethnic and re-
 gional tensions. There is a danger of a repetition of the
 bloody upheavals of the 1960s.
 Two months after the abortive coup
 that resulted in the death of the head of
 state,  Nigeria's  national  leadership
 appears more fragile and in greater dis-
 array than at any time since 1966. Mutual
 suspicions among members-based large-
 ly on a resurgence of ethnic and regional
 sentiment-have almost paralyzed the
 ruling Supreme Military Council. The
 new chief of state, Lieutenant General
 Olusegun Obasanjo, is said to be concern-
 ed about his personal safety.
 The immediate cause of the preoccupa-
 tion with security is the recent coup
 attempt, but its origins lie in the bloodless
 coup last July that toppled the nine-year-
 old regime of Yakubu Gowon, who
 ran the government by consensus. Gowon
 and other minority tribesmen from cen-
 tral Nigeria became arbiters between the
 large and powerful ethnic groups of
 northern and southern Nigeria that had
 Nigeria: Renewed Ethnic Tension
 vied for control of the country since in-
 dependence.
 The second half of the Gowon
 era-after the end of the civil war in
 1970-was a period of ethnic peace. It
 was also a time of unfulfilled promises
 and increasingly blatant corruption at all
 levels of government. The country was
 burdened with a bloated and expensive ar-
 my-some 250,000 strong-that had little
 headroom for ambitious and increasingly
 restive young officers.
 The group of younger, middle-grade,
 mostly staff-level officers that ousted
 Gowon in July 1975 promised to get
 Nigeria moving again. They acted firmly
 against corruption and adopted a
 nationalist foreign policy. Led by Murtala
 Mohammed, they gave Nigeria its most
 active government since independence.
 The Mohammed regime ousted almost
 all military and government officials who
 had extensive political experience and
 sacked some 12,000 corrupt or incompe-
 tent civil servants. The government eased
 Nigeria's serious port congestion, created
 a number of new states, and set in motion
 a program aimed at returning the country
 to civilian rule.
 Most Nigerians applauded this ac-
 tivism; they had shown growing im-
 patience with the endless palaver of the
 Gowon regime and with Gowon's inability
 to take action on difficult problems. The
 new leaders could not have acted so
 forcefully without ignoring Gowon's
 carefully nurtured system of consensus
 and, in effect, ending the predominant
 role of the minority tribesmen.
 Under Mohammed, a small group of
 officers-mainly from the large Hausa
 and Yoruba ethnic groups-made the
 decisions. The new prominence of the
 Hausas awakened bitter memories among
 the minority tribesmen of how they were
 dominated by the Hausa aristocracy prior

 to 1966, when the Hausas controlled the
 northern three fourths of Nigeria.
 By early 1976, coup rumors were com-
 mon. At the root of the discontent was the
 disgruntlement of the minorities and the
 fears of junior army officers caused by the
 regime's frequently stated intention to
 reduce the army by 100,000 men.
 The coup that came on February 13
 was poorly planned and easily crushed,
 but it eliminated Mohammed, the
 regime's most forceful and effective
 leader. The Supreme Military Council has
 since backed away publicly from the ex-
 plosive army-reduction issue, but it has
 been unable to quell ethnic fears.
 The council's actions since the coup
 have, in fact, worsened ethnic tensions
 within the leadership and the army as a
 whole, particularly between the minorities
 and the Hausas. Officers from the minori-
 ty tribes are embittered by their loss of in-
 fluence and angry over the executions last
 month of a number of their fellow
 tribesmen for alleged involvement in the
 coup.  They have also  seen  the
 predominantly minority-manned brigade
 of guards-formerly the chief military
 security unit in the capital-virtually dis-
 banded and replaced by largely Hausa
 army units.
 For the moment, the sullen and angry
 minority officers are so cowed by the
 feelings against them aroused by the
 assassination of Mohammed that they are
 staying in the background. With a third of
 the army's total manpower, they cannot
 be ignored indefinitely.
 The new prominence of the Hausas
 holds the danger of a resurgence of the
 kind of violent competition between the
 major ethnic groups that led to the bloody
 upheavals of the 1960s.
 The new number two man in the
 regime, Brigadier Shehu Yar Adua-who
 was promoted two ranks and selected over
 a minority officer who seemed in line for
 the slot-is from a prominent Hausa
 family. Some Nigerians believe he is
 already calling the shots in the Supreme
 Military Council.
 Should Obasanjo-a popular wartime
 commander and Yoruba but essentially a
 Nigerian nationalist-leave voluntarily or
 be removed, the council would be hard put
 to find a replacement of equal stature.
 Some reports suggest Yar Adua would
 replace Obasanjo, which would confirm
 the worst suspicions of the minority tribes
 and might convince the important Yoruba
 group that a Hausa attempt to take over
 is under way.
 In the meantime, the regime is
 floundering. The military leadership ap-
 parently has not yet decided on the fate of
 the hundred or so persons still in custody
 on charges of involvement in the coup
 attempt. Some additional executions
 seem likely, despite a recommendation

 from important northern religious and
 ethnic leaders against further bloodlet-
 ting.
 Portugal: More Modern Armed Forces
 Although Portugal is planning to make
 more reductions in its armed forces, it
 wants in the process to create a modern
 force capable of dealing with the country's
 changed defense and security needs.
 Portugal's military leaders have in-
 dicated in recent statements that they
 have worked out a clearer conception of
 the military's new mission. Now that Por-
 tugal's involvement in colonial wars is
 over, the armed forces will be oriented
 primarily to domestic missions. They will,
 however, continue to make a small but
 politically significant contribution to
 NATO.
 Budgetary constraints and a shortage of
 foreign exchange will hamper Portugal's
 efforts to modernize and reorganize.
 Lisbon will almost certainly need finan-
 cial and technical assistance from the US
 or Western Europe to carry out its plans.
 Portuguese military spokesmen already
 have begun a campaign to convince the
 allies of the importance of such assistance
 in bringing Portugal back into full par-
 ticipation in NATO, both politically and
 militarily.
 The Army
 Army Chief of Staff General Eanes an-
 nounced earlier this year that the army
 would be organized into two major groups
 of forces having a combined strength of

 only about 26,000. Two years ago the
 army had over 200,000 men.
 One of the two groups, consisting of
 10,000 highly trained men, would defend
 Portugal's territorial borders and protect
 the country's interests abroad. The
 remainder would handle domestic train-
 ing and internal security matters. They
 would be available for combat operations
 if needed.
 Lisbon plans to designate a brigade-
 sized airmobile unit to replace the infan-
 try division that had been committed to
 NATO. Although a smaller contribution,
 the designated brigade should he able to
 react more quickly and more effectively to
 a threat than the widely scattered divi-
 sion.
 The military apparently has no plans to
 maintain more than a tiny elite force for
 other operations outside the country. Por-
 tugal will presumably rely on its NATO
 allies to help counter any major external
 threat.
 The Navy
 Portuguese naval officers reportedly see
 the navy's role to be primarily coastal
 defense and patrol of the sea lanes
 between the mainland and Portugal's
 island possessions in the Atlantic. The
 navy's ability to carry out this mission is
 seriously hampered by the advanced age
 and poor condition of many ships in the
 fleet.
 Naval officers are especially interested
 in  replacing  the  fleet's  obsolete
 minesweepers with 12 new ones. The navy
 is also interested in acquiring new British-
 or US-built guided-missile frigates as
 replacements for six of its seven aging
 destroyer escorts. For the near term at
 least, the navy plans to use its three
 French-built submarines for Atlantic
 patrol duty and its ten corvettes for
 coastal operations.
 Because of a shortage of foreign ex-
 change, the Portuguese may be forced to
 overhaul some of their older ships or refit
 them with more modern weapons rather
 than purchase new ones. Their decision
 will depend largely on the response of
 other NATO members to their calls for
 assistance.
 Army Chief of Staff General Panes (r) with President Costa Domes
 Lisbon reportedly does not plan to
 reduce the size of the navy below 12,000
 men, but will concentrate on making the
 force more efficient.
 The future of the small marine corps is
 uncertain. Even if it survives efforts by
 some officers to disband it because of its
 alleged political unreliability, it will
 probably be reduced in size and impor-
 tance. It could be relegated to an internal
 security role in the Azores or the Madeira
 Islands.
 The Air Force
 The Portuguese air force is making
 preliminary plans to modernize its equip-
 ment and set procurement priorities.
 Lisbon also plans to cut the manpower
 level of the air force from an estimated
 12,000 men to about 9,000.
 One of the most urgent needs of the air
 force is modern medium-range transport
 aircraft to support the army's NATO-
 committed airmobile unit. The air force
 reportedly would like to purchase three
 US-made C-130s. It hopes to raise cash
 for the purchase by selling its two Boeing
 707 transports.
 According to Air Force Chief General
 Morais Da Silva, Portugal considers the
 acquisition of fighter aircraft to be
 another priority item. Morais Da Silva
 has mentioned the F-4 or F-5 as a possible
 replacement for Portugal's old F-86
 fighters.
 Morals Da Silva says that he hopes
 eventually to replace Portugal's P-2E
 patrol aircraft-designated for antisub-
 marine warfare-with newer P-3s. Three
 of the P-2E planes are committed to
 NATO and are the only Portuguese force
 actually carrying out a NATO mission.
 These aging aircraft can no longer be
 relied on, however, to carry out their
 maritime patrol mission for the alliance.
 Although Lisbon's leaders recognize
 the need to modernize the armed forces
 and are seeking to do so, Portugal's
 military arsenal is years behind those of
 most other NATO members and has little
 prospect of catching up in the near term.
 Because of internal political problems
 and continuing financial restraints, Por-
 tuguese military leaders will probably
 have to accept only modest progress for  25X1
 the next several years unless they receive
 large-scale assistance from other NATO
 members.
