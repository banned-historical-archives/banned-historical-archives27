CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN 
23 October 1959 
DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Communist China - USSR: Recently available articles from 
Communist China's provincial press contain the most explicit 
admissions to date that Soviet disapproval of the communes con-
tributed to dissension among the rank and file in the Chinese 
Communist party. The articles attack as "right opportunists" 
party members who cite Soviet abandonment of communes in the 
1920s and who say, "If other socialist countries do not have com-
munes, we should not establish them." lihrushchev's failure to 
endorse even the limited concept that communes are good "for 
China" probably has added to difficulties the Chinese leaders are 
having with unconvinced party members. (Page 1) 
Communist China - India: LMao Tse-tung on 6 October sought 
to provide Indian Communist party leader Ajoy Ghosh with a dis-
play of Peiping's "reasonableness" which Ghosh could use in off-
setting Indian Communist party factional disputes arising out of 
the Sino-Indian border dispute. 
Mao admitted Peiping had "made some mistakes" by 
continuing to publicize its extensive border claims, but he assured 
Ghosh the Chinese would not press the full claims in any negotia-
tions over border outposts. Both Mao and Liu Shao-chi told Ghosh 
negotiations on the border could begin as soon as the "proper at-
mosphere" developed--suggesting the Chinese expect the Indian 
Government to adopt a more friendly tone in public:1 Nehru said 
on 21 October that he had received no reply to hfflatest letter to 
Chou En-lai and commented that the C11inPQP did nnt h nw thp same 
"eagerness for peace" as Khrushchev.

to Lebanon, S. P. Kiktev, the first ranking Soviet diplomat

UAR: Nasir's 21 October decree giving Vice President 
Marshal Amir broad executive powers in Syria apparently is 
a move to speed up economic and political reforms. Nasir 
will now almost certainly try to push ahead with activation of 
the representative "National Union"--the UAR's sole official 
political party--and toward completion of a shake-up in the 
Syrian Army. Cairo nevertheless still faces a prolonged peri-
od of parrying popular discontent until some real progress 
is made nartirtillnly in stabilizing Syria's dislocated economy. 
 (Page 4) 
Cameroun: bere are isolated acts of violence against 
Europeans in French-administered Cameroun, and the atmos-
phere is becoming more tense there and in the British Cameroons. 
Attacks by extremist members of the Union of the Cameroons Pop-
ulation (UPC) on British and American consular installations in 
Douala and Youandd�originally slated for 15 and 19 October--
are now scheduled for 1 November, 
The extremists presumably plan these attacks as a prelude 
to a new campaign of violence aimed at ousting the moderate 
Ahidjo government before Cameroun becomes independent on

L THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Chinese Deny Applicability of Soviet Experience With Communes  
The most explicit admissions to date that Soviet disapproval 
of the communes contributed to dissension among the rank and file 
in the Chinese Communist party are contained in two recently avail-
able articles in the Chinese provincial press. A Yunnan Daily  ed-
itorial on 1 September stated that some Chinese still point out 
that the USSR abandoned communes after a brief trial in the 1920s. 
Accusing these Chinese of calling for the study of Soviet experi-
ence as a pretext for criticil-iing the communes, the article warned 
that Soviet experiments must not be studied in a doctrinaire man-
ner. The editorial argued that while it was "completely correct" 
for the USSR to disband its communes and "establish collective 
farms universally," conditions in China were different from the 
situation in the USSR when communes were tried there. 
An article in the Szechwan Daily of 22 September quoted "right 
opportunist" critics in the Chinese party as stating flatly that "if 
other socialist countries do not have communes, we should not es-
tablish them." Deliberately avoiding any reference to Khrushchev's 
opposition to the communes, the article revived Stalin's statement 
that communes were a higher form of agricultural organization. 
The resolution adopted by the Chinese central committee plenum 
last August, strongly reaffirming the "superiority" of the communes 
over the former cooperatives, is an implicit rebuke to Moscow as 
well as a slap at Chinese opponents of the commune program. Khru-
shchev's and Suslov's recent failure to endorse even the limited con-
cept that communes are good "for China" probably has heightened 
Peiping's irritation and added to the difficulty the Chinese leaders 
are having in overcoming doubts among certain party members.

Mao Seeks to Reassure Indian Communist Leader 
tilao Tse-tung on 6 October sought to provide Indian Commu-
nist party leader Ajoy Ghosh with arguments to offset criticism 
of Communist China, which has split the Indian Communist party 
on the border dispute. Admitting that Peiping had "made some 
mistakes" in publicizing its border claims, Mao assured Ghosh 
the Chinese had no intention of pressing these full claims in ne-
gotiating with the Indians to settle disputes over the location of 
individual border outposts along the McMahon line4 
(-Mao did not abandon Communist China's claims, however, 
and stated it would be necessary to develop the "proper atmos-
phere" before any negotiations could be held. This suggestion 
that the Indian Government adopt a more friendly tone in public 
probably was intended to reach Nehru and, along with the other 
comments on the border, apparently was conveyed by one of the 
Indian Communists to the Indian ambassador in Peipingg 
14ao praised the Indian party for efforts to "overcome nation-
alist feelings" and conceded that, "under certain circumstances," 
public endorsement of Peiping was not feasible. Seconding earlier 
instructions from Moscow, Mao told Ghosh the Indian party should 
try to "save Nehru from the rightists" and side with him for the 
time being. Mao's alleged assurances should provide Ghosh with 
powerful ammunition in subduing "nationalist" and "international-
ist" extremists and restoring party disciplinIV 
&e.hru told the press on 21 October that he had received no 
reply to the letter he sent Chou En-lai three weeks ago, in which 
he said no negotiations could be held until China evacuates out-
posts it holds on the Indian side of the "traditional" frontier. His 
comment that the Chinese did not show the same "eagerness for 
peace" as Khrushchev apparently was designed to bolster his the-
ory that Peiping and Moscow are at odds over relations with India]

IL ASIA-AFRICA 
Jordanians Give CordihyReception to Sqyiet Diplomat  
Ctoviet Ambassador to Lebanon S. P. Kiktev has proposed to 
King Husayn that Jordan consider accepting possible military and 
economic aid from the USSR "with no strings attached," 
The King reportedly said Kiktev 
seemed principally interested in the establishment of Soviet-Jor-
danian relations, andhad suggested that Husayn follow the example 
of Afghanistan, which continues as a monarchy and receives as-
sistance from both the West and the USSR, including Soviet mil-
itary aid] 
British Ambassador Johnston in Amman is concerned over 
the cordial treatment being accorded Kiktev by the Jordanian Gov-
ernment. Neither Husayn nor Prime Minister Majalli has given 
any information directly to the British or American ambassador 
about the discussions with Kiktev-.7 
Eflusayn/ who is said to be discouraged and perplexed by West-
ern hesitance regarding future aid commitments to Jordan, prob-
ably would like to explore the Soviet offer, although he also pre-
sumably is wary of offending Great Britain and the United States 
by accepting it. He and Majalli may fear that a Western-Soviet 
rapprochement might result in reductions in Western aid to Jor-
dan which at some future time could, if necessary, be replaced 
by Soviet assistancej 
U_Jordanian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on 18 October 
that the Czech ambassador in Beirut is expected to visit Jordan

UAR Vice President Given Full Powers in Syria 
UAR Vice President Amir has been made virtual viceroy 
of the Syrian Region of the UAR in an apparent effort by Nasir 
to speed up urgently needed economic and political reforms. 
The Syrian executive council, which includes all cabinet mem-
bers for the northern region of the UAR, has been made di-
rectly responsible to Amir, and the first session under his 
guidance has been called for 24 October. 
Amir will probably lay before the council a blueprint 
for carrying out Nasir's long-promised program for rescu-
ing the stagnating Syriar economy--dislocated by drought 
and the consequences of union with Egypt last year. Amir 
will probably also supervise the completion of purging the 
First (Syrian) Army of its various dissident elements. 
There has so far been no mention of personnel changes 
in the Syrian ministries, except for giving Interior Minister 
Abd al-Hamid Sarraj the additional post of minister of prop-
aganda Sand news, formerly held by the recently discharged 
Baathist, Riyad al-Malki. 
Amir will probably follow through quickly with Nasir's 
plans for giving the Syrians at least a semblance of local 
autonomy by formation of local and provincial committees 
composed of individuals elected last July to the UAR's only 
legal political party, the National Union. Such a move, par-
ticularly if followed soon by selection of Syrians to participate 
in a UAR national assembly, should do much to forestall 
clandestine political party activity and mollify Syrian public 
discontent over Egyptian hegemony. 
The regime, however, will continue to face popular 
resentment of its restrictions on the once free Syrian econ-
omy. Cairo's grandiose plans for industrialization probably 
will not yield significant benefits for several years, and 
the prospects of a satisfactory agricultural comeback next 
year are not bright.

Terrorism in Cameroun  
(Sporadic acts of violence b3r extremist members of the out-
lawed nationalist movement/ the Union of the Cameroons Popu-
lation (UPC), are reported to be increasing in frequency both in 
the French-administered territory of Cameroun and in British 
Cameroons. Four isolated attacks were made against lone Euro-
peans in Cameroun by UPC terrorists between 15 and 20 October. 
During this period French forces are reported to have captured 
10 Czech automatic pistols and 1,200 rounds of 7.62 ammunition. 
These attacks on Europeans may have precipitated what appears 
to have been a counter-terrorist raid on 19 October by a group 
of 20 Africans and 14 Europeans against UPC supporters in Brit-
ish Cameroon_s_l 
[Local British authorities� disturbed over these raids, are 
reported to be reinforcing their border police with two Nigerian 
infantry companies. In addition, two Nigerian gunboats are pa-
trolling the coastal waters of the border area to prevent a move-
ment of forces by se_g].. 
attacks by UPC extremists on 
British and American consular installations in Douala and Yaotand6--
originally slated for 15 and 19 October--are now scheduled for 
1 November. The terrorists presumably plan these attacks, 
which allegedly include assassinating the American consul gen-
eral in Yaoundd and the British vice consul in Douala, as aprel-
tide to a new campaign of violence aimed at ousting the moderate 
government of Premier Ahidjo and forcing new elections in 
Cameroun before it becomes independent on 1 January 19q9.3 
Crhe UPC's capabilities probably are limited to increased 
guerrilla-type activity/ unless it receives significant outside sup-
port. Ghana, Guinea, the UAR, and the Communist bloc have 
provided the UPC with some limited support, 
but the movement continues to suffer 
from lack of good leadership, administration, and logistical sup-
port-.)

Afghan and Pakistani Leaders May Meet to Discuss  
Pushtoonistan Dispute  
Pakistani President Ayub has invited Afghan Prime Minister 
Daud to visit Pakistan to "discuss a settlement of differences." 
Ayub's invitation, extended on 19 October, is his first concilia-
tory gesture to the Afghans. After he took power in October 1958, 
Ayub generally ignored Kabul's Pushtoonistan propaganda, which 
became increasingly violent. Since early September, however2 
Pakistan has been retaliating with its own propaganda offensive. 
Daud has said he is willing to go to Pakistan if assured that 
the Pushtoonistan dispute will be the subject of discussion. He 
has suggested, however, that his brother, Foreign Minister Naim, 
might first talk with Ayub and learn whether conditions seem favor-
able to a solution of this problem. Daud probably does not want 
to return home from a trip to Pakistan with nothing to show for 
his trouble; if he should feel that Ayub had used a meeting for prop-
aganda purposes, his own Pushtoonistan propaganda would prob-
ably become still more violent. 
The willingness of both leaders to meet suggests they may de-
sire to halt the deterioration in relations resulting from heated 
propaganda exchanges. It is doubtful, however, that either side 
is ready to make sufficient concessions to secure a lasting settle-
ment.
