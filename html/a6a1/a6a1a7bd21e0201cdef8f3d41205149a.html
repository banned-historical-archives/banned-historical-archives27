 S.B. 344 (ch. 1852) Gasoline tax: This un-
 questionably was one of the most important
 measures for metropolitan cities considered
 during the 30-year period we are covering.
 City receipts from gasoline taxes were more
 than doubled and, as a result, critical de-
 ficiencies on congested city streets are now
 being corrected.  The measure will produce
 about $76 million annually, in addition to
 revenues already received by local govern-
 ment.

 It would have been impossible to continue
 to  operate  municpal  jails,  police  depart-
 ments; fire departments, and so forth, with-
 out such legislation.
 In the 1963 session, as well as others, there
 is no question but that bills beneficial to
 urban interests were initiated in a house
 (assembly)  districted largely on the basis
 of population but in every case these meas-
 ures had to be approved by the senate.  This
 was true of the State water program and
 the Rumford Fair Housing Act.
 In his Legislative Review, dated July 18,
 1961, the executive director of the League of
 California Cities concluded:
 "Both offensively and defensively the so-
 called  rural  senate  and  its - committees
 showed more understanding of and sym-
 pathy toward bills of interest to cities than
 did the urban assembly.  Contrary to pop-
 ular belief this is not unusual.                                                                                                                                          This year,
 more than ever before, the assembly showed
 an  alarming disregard  for  the  principles
 of home rule and the needs of cities.  This
 is not true of all assemblymen nor is the
 outstanding  senate  record true  as  to all
 senators but it is a completely accurate state-
 ment as to a majority of the members of
 each house.  The proof is in the final his-
 tory.,'
 On the negative side, we can only state
 that almost all bills which would infringe
 on the right of cities to control their own
 internal affairs originate in the assembly,
 and where successful, they have been de-
 feated in the senate where there is much
 greater recognition of  the  rights  of, city
 councils to control their own internal oper-
 ations.                                                                                                                                    One need only examine measures to
 decrease the hours of firemen, increase vaca-
 tion periods of firemen and policemen, pre-
 empt certain fields of taxation, preclude local
 exercise of the police power, and restrict the
 right of cities to enact their own land use
 regulations.

 use tax bases which are the principal source
 of revenue of local governriierit) originate in
 the 'assembly.  When successful in the as-
 sembly, they have been defeated by the
 senate.  There can be no greater threat to
 urban and metropolitan municipal home
 rule than to make our cities dependent upon
 the State for adequate revenues with which
 to provide a minimum standard of municipal
 services.
 In short, the record is clear that the con-
 centration of power in the State and the
 regulation of the right of cities to control
 their own affairs stems from legislators who
 represent metropolitan, areas.
 Finally, it should be noted that in the
 Senate of the State of California, as now
 constituted, 17 of the 40 senators represent
 metropolitan areas as listed by the U.S. Bu-
 reau of the Budget as standard metropolitan
 areas.  This means that 42 percent of the
 present senate represents the metropolitan
 or predominately urban areas of California.
 Because California  has grown so rapidly,
 senators representing once rural areas now
 represent  heavily  populated  areas  even
 though their   districts have    not  been
 changed.

 that this is a vote on a question which

 I further announce that the Senator

 the debate. Especially, I wish to single
 out for praise the two whips, who helped
 us very materially, the Senator from
 Wisconsin [Mr. PROXMIRE] and the Sen-
 ator from Maryland  [Mr. TYDINGSI.
 Their services were above and beyond
 praise.  We are deeply indebted to all
 those who worked hard and who stood
 firm amidst the tremendous pressures
 which were placed upon them.
 I also pay tribute to the minority
 leader, my colleague from Illinois [Mr.
 DIRKSEN I , with whom I differed very
 sharply on the question before the Sen-
 ate, but who was not only courteous, but
 also extremely fair in the allocation of
 time and in the conduct of the debate.
 I thank the majority leader also for
 his courtesy in the matter.
 In short, I believe this has been a
 good day for the      scan people.

 VIETNAM-TIE V    ACHMENT OF
 THE PRESIDENT
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, yester-
 day I said in a speech on the floor of the
 Senate :
 Mr. President, in my trip across the coun-
 try and back since I spoke on the floor of the
 Senate last Wednesday, I have been alarmed
 by the rising denunciation of the President
 and his administration for their Vietnam
 policy.  I have heard the word "impeach"
 used more often in the last week than I have
 heard   it  since  President  Truman  sacked
 General MacArthur.  I have been asked by
 more people than I would have thought pos-
 sible if there is not grounds for impeach-
 ment of the President, and how the process
 can be set in motion.  I have been advised
 about petitions that have been circulated
 and hundreds of people are signing asking
 for the President's impeachment.
 Much of this talk stems from objections
 to a war being undertaken without congres-
 sional declaration.  Most of these people see
 the President as waging an executive war,
 in violation of the Constitution.  They think
 the impeachment clauses of the Constitution
 must apply to such a case.
 Mr.  PROXMIRE.  Mr.  President,          I
 suggest the absence of a quorum.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER               (Mr.
 MONDALE in the chair).  The clerk will
 call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The question is on agreeing to Senate
 Joint Resolution 66, as amended by the
 Dirksen amendment, as modified.
 Mr.  MANSFIELD. Mr. President,
 have the yeas and nays been ordered?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 yeas and nays have been ordered, and
 the clerk will call the roll.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, a
 parliamentary inquiry.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Senator from Montana will state it.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. What are we vot-
 ing on?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  The
 Senate will be voting on Senate Joint
 Resolution 66 as amended by the Dirksen
 substitute, as modified.
 Mr. HOLLAND,  Mr. President, I sug-
 gest the absence of a quorum.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 clerk will call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. Without ob-
 jection, it is so ordered.
 The question is on agreeing to Senate
 Joint Resolution 66 as amended by the
 Dirksen substitute, as modified.
 On this question the yeas and nays
 have been ordered; and the clerk will
 call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. SYMINGTON (when his name was
 called).  On this vote I have a pair with
 the senior Senator from Minnesota [Mr
 MCCARTHY]. If he were present and vot-
 ing, he would vote "nay." If I were per-
 Then I went on to make a statement as
 to why, in my judgment, Congress should
 not adjourn sine the but should remain
 in session until January 1. I pointed out
 that we should remain in session and
 carry out our constitutional responsi-
 bility of serving as a legislative check
 upon executive action.
 There are those, judging from the in-
 terviews with the press today, and from
 telephone calls that the senior Senator
 from Oregon has received, who interpret
 my remarks as indicating that I advo-
 cate the impeachment of the President.
 Of course, such an interpretation is
 nonsense.
 Mr. President, I have been receiving a
 great deal of mail in regard to this mat-
 ter and many people have talked to me
 at meetings at which I have spoken in
 opposition  to  the  President's  war  in
 Vietnam.    I have been answering all of
 the mail on the impeachment matter
 with a letter that contains these two
 paragraphs.  I  read  two  paragraphs
 from a letter dated July 6, 1965. I have
 sent similar letters before and since that
 time:
 In your letter, you asked me for my views
 concerning your suggestion that steps should

 The VICE PRESIDENT.  On this vote
 the yeas are 57 and the nays 39.  Two-
 thirds of the Senators present and voting
 not having voted in the affirmative, the
 joint resolution, as amended, is rejected.
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  Mr. President, the
 vote today on the proposed constitu-
 tional amendment, was, I believe, a real
 vote for the American people.  It should
 enable the decisions of the Supreme
 Court to be carried into effect in the
 various States.  The result will be, I
 believe, a very healthy increase in the
 vigor of State legislatures and in the
 degree of actual representation which
 they will give to the people.
 It should also lead to less dependence
 upon the Federal Government and more
 work on the State level.
 I thank all those who participated in

 be takes, to impeach President Johnson and
 perhaps some other officials.  It 10 my view
 that such an impeachment attempt would
 be a very serious, mistake.  An It would. do
 would be to'divert attention away from the
 basic issues involved in American foreign
 policy in Asia and center attention on Presi-
 dent Jol.}nson, as an individual.              It would
 cause many people who disagree with his
 foreign policy to rally behind him, because
 they would consider such a movement to be
 an ad hominem approach.      Attacking John-
 son, personally, will not change his course
 of action, and it will not win supporters for
 a change of foreign policy in Asia, but to
 the contrary, it will drive supporters away.
 In my opinion, there is no question about
 Johnson's sincerity or his patriotism or his
 desire for peace. It is Johnson's bad judg-
 ment and mistaken reasoning in respect to
 the war in Asia that constitute the basis of
 the crucial problems that confront us in try-
 ing to get a change in Johnson's policies in
 Asia.  To attack him, personally, by pro-
 posing impeachment would be the most seri-
 ous personal attack that could be made upon
 him.   It would rally the Nation behind
 him and result in his policies being escalated
 into a major war at a much faster rate.
 Those of us who oppose Johnson's foreign
 policies must meet his views on their merits.
 We should never attack him, personally.
 -I wish the RECORD to show that this
 letter represents the position the senior
 Senator from Oregon has taken in. all
 correspondence on the subject.  Also it
 represents my answers to questions on
 impeachment at all rallies I have at-
 tended, and in all my conversations with
 those who urge impeachment of the
 President.
 Those that I have talked to and who
 have written to, me suggesting impeach-
 ment of the President are not extremists
 in the sense that they are irresponsible
 persons.  Many of them are on the fac-
 ulties of American universities.  Many
 of them are out of the professional life
 of our Nation.
 I have no intention of joining them in
 such a program.  Nevertheless, f be-
 lieve it is a significant fact that there
 is growing discussion in this country of
 an attempt to stop the President from
 his illegal war in southeast Asia, even
 to the extent of circulating impeach-
 ment petitions.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.. I believe it is inde-
 fensible and cruel for any person to talk
 about impeaching the President of the
 United States with respect to our part
 in South Vietnam.
 ',It has just been stated that professors
 are urging and circulating petitions for
 the  impeachment  of  the  President.
 What does that mean?
 Does that mean that professors of our
 universities are gifted with infallibility?
 The President has tried with all his
 might to bring about an understanding
 that would end the shooting and the
 carnage in South Vietnam,  Eleven im-
 portant measures have been proposed by
 him, any one of which, if it had been
 adopted, would have brought to an end
 the carnage.
 With respect to impeaching the Presi-
 dent, I have had letters. in the last 8
 years asking for the impeachment of
 President Eisenhower and the Impeach-
 ment of President Kennedy after the
 Bay  of Pigs  debacle.  Those . letters
 come to us and I do not attach signifi-
 cance to them.
 In my judgment, the President of the
 United States is bogged down by a
 weight so great that it has never been
 equal to that imposed upon any ruler
 in a republic or in a monarchy in the
 history of the world.
 The President of the United States is
 attempting to carry that burden cour-
 ageously.  He is trying to achieve peace
 by the proposal of negotiations to the
 extent that, rather than be attacked on
 the ground that he does not want peace,
 he ought to be attacked because he is
 going too far in surrendering to the op-
 ponents of our system of government.
 Mr. MORSE. I merely wish to say in
 reply to the Senator from Ohio that it is
 not at all surprising for people in the
 country who think the President is fol-
 lowing an unconscionable and illegal
 course of action in South Vietnam to turn
 to the Constitution and look for what
 procedural protection they have.  They
 have a perfect right to turn to the im-
 peachment procedure.  I believe that
 they are making a great mistake in judg-
 ment.  I, of course, would defend them
 in their right to exercise their constitu-
 tional rights. But, in one sense, I should
 like to say to the Senator from Ohio
 that until the President follows his con-
 stitutional obligation by coming before
 this body and ask for a declaration of
 war, the President is engaged in an illegal
 war.  It is a war now conducted by the
 Chief Executive, in South Vietnam with-
 out a scintilla of constitutional right.
 This Congress is likewise guilty of vi-
 olating its duties under the Constitution
 by seeking to delegate to the President
 a power that it cannot constitutionally
 delegate, It is the duty of the Congress
 under article I, section 8, either to de-
 clare war or to stop the President from
 slaughtering American boys in south-
 east Asia. I have no doubt that impeach-
 ment talk will increase if the President
 continues to conduct an unconstitutional
 war.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  I have had no letters
 asking for the impeachment of President
 Johnson; I have had a thousand letters
 asking for the impeachment of Chief
 Justice Warren. I have disregarded the
 latter. I think we ought not to be talk-
 ing about impeaching the President of
 the United States.
 On the face of the President's effort
 to achieve peace and the preservation of
 our country and his courageous handling
 of a most difficult challenge to our se-
 curity, we should not speak of impeach-
 ing but rather helping the President in
 the solution of a backbreaking problem
 that no individual ought to carry.
 The President needs and is entitled
 to help, but not to the cruel and shame-
 ful threat of impeachment.
 NATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHIC

 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I

 proceed to the consideration of Calendar

 There being no objection, the Senate

 Commerce with an amendment.
 VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965-
 CONFERENCE REPORT
 Mr.  MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 submit a report of the committee of
 conference on the disagreeing ? votes of
 the two Houses on the amendment of the
 House to the bill (S. 1564) to enforce
 the 15th amendment to the Constitu-
 tion of the United States, and for other
 purposes.  I ask unanimous consent for
 the present consideration of the report.
 The VICE PRESIDENT.  The report
 will be read for the information of the
 Senate.
 The legislative clerk read the report.
 (For conference report, see House pro-
 ceedings of August 2, 1965, pp. 18272-
 18275, CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.)
 The VICE PRESIDENT.  Is there ob-
 jection to the present consideration of
 the report?
 There being no objection, the Senate
 proceeded to consider the report.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 urge Senators to remain in the Chamber
 so that we may expedite action on the
 pending question if it is at all possible.
 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and
 nays.
 The yeas and nays were ordered.
 Mr. HART.  Mr. President, the con-
 ferees on the voting rights bill have, fol-
 lowing some six meetings, reported what
 I believe can be described as a strong
 bill.
 There would be 100, versions of this
 bill, I assume, if each of us were a czar,
 but I believe the conference recommen-
 dation will be regarded as an effective
 bill and one which will bear the test of
 time well.
 There were really two significant dis-
 agreements   and   attention-gathering
 features of the bill. I believe it fair to
 say, on both of these, that the Senate
 position is reflected in the conference
 report.
 The section on American-flag schools,
 the so-called treatment of Puerto Ri-
 cans, is as the Senate adopted it.
 The treatment of the poll tax, I believe,
 fairly could be said to be substantially as
 the Senate adopted the provision.  The
 conferees on the part of the House
 sought very strongly to retain-
 The VICE PRESIDENT.  Will the
 Senator withhold?
 The Senator is entitled to the consid-
 eration of the Senate.  This is a very
 important matter.  The Chair asks those
 in the rear of the Chamber to please re-
 frain from conversation and find them-
 selves comfortable chairs. If they can-
 not, please exit.
 The Senator from Michigan may pro-
 ceed.
 Mr. HART. It will be recalled that the
 House of Representatives treated the poll
 tax by outlawing it.

 "One of the most delicate and vexing social,
 economic and legal situations," Mr. Stein ob-
 served i4 starting the Cleveland hearing, "is
 to have one instrumentality of government
 telling another what to do, when the other
 one May not be ready to do it.  It presents
 some very awkward problems."
 Mr. Stein, a lawyer, copes with these prob-
 lems by radiating amiability, soft-pedaling
 the compulsory nature of the proceedings,
 and resolving contretemps with casual re-
 marks that end in a disarming chuckle.
 "We're dealing with facts subject to sci-
 entific measurements," is his watchword.
 "Once we get agreement on the facts the
 solutions will present themselves."
 He lets off steam at afterhours cocktail
 and dinner gatherings with associates, punc-
 tuating these sessions with such exclama-
 tions as, "We're certainly getting a lot of jazz
 from the so-and-so people," or "Did you hear
 what that son of a gun from XYZ Co. had the
 nerve to claim?"
 The net result of his onstage tact has been
 that in 34 enforcement cases to date, only
 one has reached the point of court proceed-
 Ms.                All have produced remedial programs,
 in about a dozen cases, pollution has
 been ended or significantly reduced.
 A FEDERAL CAREER MAN
 Mr. Stein has had only one employer in
 his life, the U.S. Government.  He was born
 in the East New York section of Brooklyn on
 October 17, 1916, the son of a food broker.
 He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High
 School and studied for 2 years at the College
 of the City of New York before seeking his
 fortune in Washington.
 There, he worked as a printer's devil in the
 Government Printing Office, served as an
 Army medical technician during World War
 II and worked as a clerk in the Federal Secu-
 rity Agency's law office while studying law
 at George Washington University.  On get-
 ting his degree, with honors, in 1949, he
 joined the staff of the security agency's gen-
 eral counsel.
 Since then he has dealt with most of the
 many health activities that are now under
 the Department of Health, Education, and
 Welfare, ranging from vital statistics, home
 accidents and poultry sanitation to radiation
 hazards, shell fish sanitation and mental
 health.
 He has been enforcement chief of the
 public health service's division of Water
 Supply and Pollution Control since the pres-
 ent pollution control law was passed in 1956.
 Mr. Stein and his wife, the former Anne
 Kopelman, also of Brooklyn, have two teen-
 age daughters.  His hobbies are hiking and
 surf-swimming. He has no middle name.
 The Steins live in Fairfax County, Va., in
 a conservative modern home.  As one who
 spends most of his time prodding authorities
 all over the country into installing modern
 sewage treatment systems, Mr. Stein con-
 fesses somewhat sheepishly that his own
 residence is served by a well and a septic
 tank.   But, he says, "we do have indoor
 plumbing."
 TRIBUTE TO ADLAI STEVENSON
 Mr, McGOVERN. Mr. President, Mr.
 Max Freedman, a recognized master of
 English prose,, provided what I think may
 very well be the most beautiful tribute to
 the late Adlai Stevenson.
 I ask unanimous consent that this
 masterful article,,from the Washington
 Evening Star of July 15, 1965, entitled
 "The Greatness of Adlai Stevenson," be
 printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was'ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

 Words were sacred to him because he re-
 fused to trifle with the truth.  That is why
 he polished his speeches to the last reluctant
 minute, to the despair of his friends and
 the torment of reporters.  He wished to say
 exactly what he meant.  He was not seeking

 epigram, the gaiety of a twinkling sarcasm.
 the sudden felicity of an inevitable phrase,
 or the exaltation of a moral appeal.
 He had a higher aim in view than his place
 as  America's prose  laureate.  He  wanted
 words on the political platform to be used as
 counters of truth and never as weapons of
 deception.  He has left us his example to
 shame those who fall below his standards.
 Was Stevenson, the master of noble words,
 also the servant of noble causes?
 His was the first prophetic voice in a na-
 tional campaign that dared to denounce Ne-
 gro wrongs as an outrage on American rights.
 There would never have been a Suez war if
 his advice had been followed in good time
 and if an international police force had been
 placed in the Gaza strip.
 No one can take from Stevenson the dis-
 tinction of being the first American states-
 man fully to recognize the definite end of
 the colonial era and the growing importance
 of the emergent nations.
 He pleaded for a nuclear test ban treaty
 when others denounced this advocacy as the-
 atrical folly.  He strove for an end to the
 arms race though he knew the barbed strat-
 agems of Communist power far better than
 most of his critics.
 He argued with a certain spacious courtesy
 that made him for some 15 years the most
 admired and trusted spokesman of American
 policy on the world scene.
 We have no way of knowing what leader-
 ship in the White House. would have done
 to Stevenson.  Lesser men have grown in sta-
 ture and in power of decision.  He, too, might
 have found resources of character within
 himself that would have provided the crown-
 ing proof of his greatness.  It is more than
 an act of faith, under the shadow of death,
 to. believe that this last felicity would have
 been granted to him.
 Almost from the first it has been common
 talk among his,friends that Stevenson's work
 as Ambassador to the United Nations was
 uncongenial to him.  No one an that position
 aces.  Mr. Kraft has written an excel-
 lent review of Mr. Lacouture's book
 which contains a comprehensive account
 of events in Vietnam for the last decade
 .
 Mr. Kraft concludes his review, entitled,
 "Understanding the Vietcong," by say-
 ing:
 Official apologists for our present policy,

 sist that there is no alternative * * * there
 remains an alternative well known to all
 politically alert Vietnamese. * * * It is the
 alternative  of  negotiations  between  the
 Saigon government and the Vietcong.    Such
 talks are an absolute precondition to any
 reconciling of local differences. However, dif-
 ficult to arrange they may now appear, direct
 discussions with the Vietcong will sooner or
 later have to take place if there is to be a
 settlement in Vietnam.  For a struggle that
 began locally-and this is the central point
 to emerge from Lacouture's book-can also
 best be settled locally.
 As one who has advocated discussions
 between the warring factions in Viet-
 nam, including the Vietcong, I ask unan-
 imous  consent to have  this  review
 printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the review

 VIETNAM:. STUCK TO THE
 TAR BABY
 Mr. CHURCH, Mr. President, Arthur
 Krock, one of -the Nation's most dis-
 tinguished political columnists, published
 a telling column entitled "Trying To Get
 Loose From the Tar Baby," in the July
 25 issue of the New York Times.  Mr.
 Krock retells. the fable, relating it to
 Vietnam,, and comments:
 Thus once more a fable serves as'an excel-
 lent means to . make a complex situation
 clear-in this instance one which could not
 even have been imagined at the time of
 the telling as a situation in which the United
 States would ever find itself.  Certainly it
 is stuck hard in a tar baby.    Certainly its
 own errors of foresight have stuck it deeper
 than was intended.  Certainly one of the
 responsible factors is the concept of the
 mission of the United States as morally and
 militarily obligated to oppose the spread of
 communism- anywhere in the world, single-
 handed if necessary, and whether or not be-
 yond  our  reasonable  sphere of  national
 security and interest.
 I ask unanimous consent to have this
 article printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 purpose by daily official emphasis on the
 secrecy by which the President has bound
 the participaiits to reveal no detail of the
 conferences.
 This elaborate public relations technique
 would lose its justification only if it should
 develop ' that ' the decisions of the confer=
 ences are not for the deeper involvement of
 the United States in the war, with the much
 graver portent the expansion would create.
 But the general impression among qualified
 observers is that that is the most unlikely
 outcome of the White House meetings.
 DESPERATE PROBLEM
 The decisions which have been in the
 making, or have been made, may be public
 property by the time this dispatch appears in
 print.  But while they may encourage, and
 eventually fulfill, hope of at least moderat-
 ing the desperate nature of the problem of
 Vietnam, their immediate product will be a
 more realistic coming-to-grips with its true
 magnitude than the administration has pub-
 licly conceded before.
 The ways and the plights of men and of
 nations have been recorded, examined, ana-
 lyzed and adjudged in countless works of
 history and fiction.  And, as in the instance
 of Vietnam, contemporary writings and ora-
 tory have dealt with them in millions of
 words.  But often the serious character of
 these plights has been made more compre-
 hensible to humanity by humorous  fable
 than by solemn exposition.  Such a fable,
 uncanny in the comparison it invites with
 the involvement of the United States in
 Vietnam, Is "The Wonderful Tar Baby Story."
 APT NURSERY TALE
 Like the other nursery tales Uncle Remus
 told to "the little boy" in Georgia long ago,
 this one concerned., the unending effort of
 Bier FOX to catch and eat Brer Rabbit.  An
 unusual series of errors of foresight by the
 rabbit had for the first time put him in a
 predicament from which no exit was in sight
 except down the fox's gullet.  This menacing
 situation arose after Brer Fox, smarting
 under Bier Rabbit's recent success in making
 him  look  foolish  in  the    matter  of  the
 "calamus root" hoax, fixed up a contraption
 of tar and turpentine that the fox named the
 tar baby, set up In the big road, and lay In
 the bushes to await developments.-
 He didn't have long to wait, as the tale was
 told, because very shortly 13rer Rabbit came
 pacing  down  the  road,  lippity-clippity,
 clippity-lippity, as sassy as a jay bird. Brer
 Fox lay low. When the rabbit spied the tar
 baby he reared up on his hind legs in aston-
 ishment, and then, remembering his social
 obligations, wished it the time of day, praised
 the weather and inquired how the tar baby's
 symptoms seemed to segashuate that morn-
 ing.  No reply was forthcoming, and Brer Fox
 winked his eye and laid low.
 At this point the offended Brer Rabbit lost
 his temper and proceeded on actions without
 looking  ahead  to  their  potential  con-
 sequences.  Continuing to get no response
 from the tar baby-to an inquiry whether
 deafness was the cause of its refusal to talk,
 or to information that Brer Rabbit could
 holler, louder if this was necessary, or to the
 stated conclusion that  the tar  baby was
 stuck up and the obvious cure was to bust
 him wide open-Brer Rabbit fit the action to
 the word.

 might not, was the reply: at any rate that
 was the end of the story for the present,
 though "some say" that "Jedge" Bear came
 to the aid of the rabbit, and some say he
 didn't.  Which pretty closely matches the
 conflict in speculations of the outcome of
 Averell Harriman's mission to Moscow.
 A FABLE CLARIFIES
 Thus once more a fable serves as an excel-
 lent means to make a complex situation
 clear-in this instance one which could not
 even have been imagined at the time of the
 telling as a situation in which the United
 States would ever find itself.  Certainly it is
 stuck hard in a tar baby.  Certainly its own
 errors of foresight have stuck it deeper than
 was intended.  Certainly one of the respon-
 sible factors Is the concept of the mission of
 the United States as morally and militarily
 obligated to oppose the spread of com-
 munism  anywhere  in  the  world,  single-

 yond                                                                                                                 our reasonable sphere  of national
 security and interest.
 But fables are not necessarily conclusive
 as analogies to the courses of men and na-
 tions, only of the durable origins of the hu-
 man tendency to err. If Brer Rabbit had
 been a real member of his species instead of
 the quasi-human Uncle Remus suggested by
 giving him speech, he would never have as-
 sumed the arrogant role of lord of the high-
 way in "The Wonderful Tar Baby Story."
 WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN WYOMING
 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, my State,
 Wyoming, is known far and wide as the
 Equality State.  It is a name we like,
 deriving as it does from the fact that Wy-
 oming was the first jurisdiction in the
 Nation to grant women equal suffrage.
 We took that step while still a territory
 in 1869.  When Wyoming entered the
 Union 75 years ago it became, also, the
 first State to accord women an equal
 right to vote and to hold public of-
 fice.
 Mr. President, Dr. T. A. Larson, a dis-
 tinguished western historian, who is
 head of the department of history and
 director of the School of American Stud-
 ies at the University of Wyoming, as
 well as a valued colleague of mine, has
 traced in definitive terms the history of
 this landmark legislation.  It appeared
 recently in the Pacific Northwest Quar-
 terly and is slated for somewhat fuller
 treatment in Dr. Larson's "History of
 Wyoming," scheduled for publication in
 the fall. I ask unanimous consent that
 Dr. Larson's article "Woman Suffrage in
 -Wyoming," be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the REC-
 ORD, as follows:
 WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN WYOMING
 (By T. A. Larson)
 (NOTE: T. A. Larson is head of the de-
 partment of history and director of the School
 of American Studies at the University of Wyo-
 ming.                                                                                                                 The present article is a condensation
 of parts of two chapters in his "History of
 Wyoming," to be published by the University
 of Nebraska Press in the fall of 1965.)
 In the preface to "Laws of Wyoming, 1869,"
 Territorial Secretary Edward M. Lee singled
 out one law for special attention: "Among

 other acts, a law was passed enfranchizing
 women; thus, by a single step, placing the
 youngest territory on earth in the vanguard
 of civilization and progress."  Lee was, of
 course, right In focusing attention on this act,
 for Wyoming was thefirst U.S. territory, and
 later would be the first State (1890), to give
 women full rights to vote and hold office?
 No other action of the 1869 legislature, or of
 any other Wyoming Legislature, has received
 so much attention.
 The  question  is  often  asked,  Why  did
 woman suffrage come first in Wyoming?  As
 might be expected, causation was complex,
 and the answer, if it is to be worth much,
 cannot be given in a few words.  It was cer-
 tainly not a bolt from the blue.                    Limited
 suffrage rights, for example in school elec-
 tions, had been given to women from time
 to time in various parts of the country ever
 since 1776 when a few women had voted in
 New Jersey.  Since the 1840's suffragettes had
 been campaigning vigorously in the East. A
 woman suffrage weekly, the Revolution, be-
 gan, publication in New York City in 1868.
 The Cheyenne Leader said In October 1868:
 "There are few of our weekly exchanges that
 we peruse with more interest than we do the
 Revolution. * * * The Revolution is bound
 to win."
 Woman suffrage amendments were pro-
 posed in both houses of Congress in 1868, and
 the American Woman Suffrage Association
 was organized in 1869. Woman suffrage bills
 had been introduced in several State and ter-
 ritorial legislatures.  One house of the Ne-
 braska Legislature had passed such a bill in
 11356, and the Dakota Territorial Legislature
 had failed by just one vote to pass a woman
 suffrage bill In January 1869.  Clearly the
 conditions were ripe for a legislative victory
 somewhere.   The Wyoming legislators had
 the option of jumping in at the head of the
 parade or of watching it pass by.   Had they
 failed to act as they did in December 1869,
 the honors would have gone to Utah Terri-
 tory, whose legislators were right at their
 heels; Utah adopted woman suffrage in Feb-
 ruary 1870.
 Apart from the national pressures which
 promised a breakthrough somewhere very
 soon, certain conditions made it probable
 that victory would come first in a western
 territory.  One factor was the scarcity of
 women.  With only one woman in Wyoming
 over -21 for every six men over 21 (1870
 census), adoption of women suffrage was
 less revolutionary that it would have been
 where there were as many women as men.
 Western territories were desperately eager
 for publicity which would attract population.
 Free advertising was a common explanation
 in the 1870's and 1880's for Wyoming's action.
 The Cheyenne Leader, for example, said, when
 the act was adopted: "We now expect at once
 1 The legislature was small, 9 in the upper
 house, which was  known as the  council,
 and 18 in the house of representatives.
 All legislators were  Democrats. On final
 passage they voted 6-2 and 7-4. The Repub-
 lican Governor, John A. Campbell, after 4
 days of indecision, signed the act, which
 reads as follows: "Female Suffrage, chapter
 31, An Act to Grant to the Women. of Wyo-
 ming Territory the Right of Suffrage andTo
 Hold Office.
 'Be it enacted by the Council and House
 of Representatives of the Territory of Wyo-
 r2ing:
 "SECTION 1. That every woman of the age
 of   21   years,  residing   in   this   terri-
 tory, may at every election to be holden un-
 der the laws thereof, cast her vote.  And her
 rights to the elective franchise and to hold
 office shall be the same under the election
 laws of the territory, as those of electors.
 "SEc. 2. This act shall take effect and be
 in force from and after its passage.
 "Approved, Dec. 10, 1869."
 quite an immigration of ladies to Wyoming";
 and it added in March 1870 that this legisla-
 tion was "nothing more or less than a shrewd
 advertising dodge.  A cunning device to ob-
 tain for Wyoming a-widespread notoriety."
 In the 1890's, the historian, C. G. Coutant,
 interviewed surviving members of the 1869
 legislature.  He reported that "One-man told
 me that he thought it right and just to give
 women the right to vote?  Another man said
 he thought it would be a good advertisement
 for the territory.  Still another said that he
 voted to please someone else, and so on." 3
 It was often said in the early days that the
 whole thing was done as a joke.  Strongest
 support for this interpretation lies in an edi-
 torial in the Cheyenne, Wyo., Tribune, Octo-
 ber 8, 1870, apparently written by Edward
 M. Lee, who had been secretary of the terri-
 toryin 1889:
 "Once, during the session, amid the great-
 est hilarity, and after the presentation of
 various funny amendments and in the full
 expectation of a gubernatorial veto, an act
 was  passed  enfranchising  the  women  of
 Wyoming.  The-bill, however, was approved,
 became a law, and the youngest territory
 placed in the van of progress. *  * * How
 strange that a movement destined to purify
 the muddy pool of politics * * * should have
 originated in a joke. * * * All honor to them,
 say we, to Wyoming's first legislature."
 Since Secretary Lee, himself a champion of
 woman suffrage, worked closely with the leg-
 islators, his testimony is important, although
 he did not say that everyone involved was
 joking, and William H. Bright, who intro-
 duced the bill, later denied that he had done
 so as a joke.
 Gov. John A. Campbell, of Wyoming, was
 reported to have said in Boston in 1871 that
 "no  public discussion preceded  passage."
 While the bill may not have been discussed
 much, the subject of woman suffrage was
 often discussed In the Cheyenne newspapers
 during the months  preceding the legisla-
 ture's action.  Much of the newspaper com-
 ment concerned the activities of Anna Dick-
 inson, a nationally known suffragette.  After
 reading about her in an Omaha paper, the
 editor of the Cheyenne Leader, Nathan A.
 Baker, proposed in June 1869: "Let's try to
 get her here."  Ten days later, June 17, Miss
 Dickinson passed through Cheyenne on her
 way to fulfill speaking engagements in Cali-
 fornia.  The Leader reported that when the
 "celebrated lady" stepped out on the plat-
 form for a breath of air, she was "surrounded
 by a crowd of staring mortals.  She sought
 refuge in a passenger coach.  She was then
 subjected to an enfilading fire from the eyes
 of those who succeeded in flattening their
 noses against the car windows.  * * * Anna
 is good looking. * * * " 4
 After it was announced that Miss Dickin-
 son would lecture in Cheyenne on her way
 east the Leader hailed her approaching visit
 as "quite an event in our city" and as "an
 opportunity to listen to one of the most- en-
 tertaining and graceful of female orators."
 On September 24, 1869, Secretary Lee intro-
 duced Miss Dickinson to "some 250 people
 whom curiosity had attracted," according to
 the report in the Leader the next day.  Gov-
 ernor Campbell was in the audience, but
 out-of-town legislators probably were not
 " This is the reason stated on various occa-
 sions by William H. Bright, who introduced
 the bill.

 Mondell, no date, on file in State archives

 4In several other articles in subsequent
 weeks, the Leader referred to Anna as "the
 female humbug," as one who lectured for the
 love of money and notoriety, and as "the
 pepper" of the women's rights movement as
 contrasted  with  "the vinegar,"  Susan B.
 Anthony.
 present, since the legislature did not meet
 until mid-October.  The editor of the Leader
 had little to say about Miss Dickinson's mes-
 sage, but he noted that "in person she is
 rather  below    medium  height,  and  well,
 formed; her face is rather of the oval type."
 Another  woman  suffrage    lecturer,  Miss
 Redelia Bates of St. Louis, spoke in Cheyenne
 on November 5, 1869, just a week before Wil-
 liam H. Bright announced that he intended
 to introduce a woman suffrage bill.    The
 house of representatives had voted to let
 her use its hall, which she did.  The Leader
 had made only a few comments about woman
 suffrage since Miss Dickinson's visit in Sep-
 tember, but in anticipation of Miss Bates'
 arrival, it reported that she was beautiful.
 and talented and that she had enjoyed a suc-
 cessful tour through Colorado.  Just how
 many paid the advertised price of 50 cents to
 hear Miss Bates is in doubt; the Tribune re-
 ported "a large and appreciative audience,"
 the Leader an audience "though not large
 * * * select and appreciative."
 The Leader praised the lecturer's charm, as-
 serting that "her presence would make any
 home a heaven," but it did not yet accept her
 argument.  The Tribune, on the other hand,
 found her both charming and persuasive:
 "Miss Bates is exceedingly prepossessing in
 personal appearance.  Her arguments were
 unanswerable, except upon the basis of prej-
 udice."  Probably the Tribune review was
 written by Edward M. Lee, for he was finan-
 cial backer of the paper and often wrote for it.
 After Miss Bates' visit to Cheyenne, the
 Leader refrained from ridiculing woman suf-
 frage during the legislative session.  When
 William H. Bright introduced his bill, the
 Leader, under the heading, "Interesting Ques-
 tion," assumed a position of neutrality: "It
 will be up for consideration tonight, at the
 evening session, on which occasion many of
 our citizens will doubtless find it convenient
 to attend."  When the bill passed both
 houses, the Leader's comment was noncom-
 mittal: "Ladies, prepare your ballots."
 While awaiting Governor Campbell's deci-
 sion, the Leader indicated qualified approval:
 "Although we have not yet been.fully con-
 vinced of the wisdom or necessity of the
 measure, yet we have something of a curiosity
 to witness its practical operation and results,
 and we hope, as we believe, that Governor.
 Campbell will approve the bill."   Nathan
 Baker, editor of the Leader, was never an
 ardent supporter, but he had come a long way
 since Anna Dickinson first visited Cheyenne
 In June.  And when the Governor signed the
 bill, Baker showed that, while he had been
 overcome  temporarily  by  the  charm  of
 Redelia Bates, he was still loyal to Miss Dick-
 inson: "Won't the irrepressible 'Annie D'
 come out here and make her home?    We'll
 even give her morethan the right to vote-
 she can run for Congress."
 Unlike the Leader, the Tribune needed no
 conversion.  It greeted passage of the bill
 with the accurate judgment that it "is likely
 to be the measure of the session, and we are
 glad our legislature has taken the initiative
 In this movement, which is destined to be-
 come universal.  Better appear to lead than
 hinder when a movement is inevitable."  The
 Tribune a week later hailed the Governor's
 signature with the headlines, "Wyoming Suf-
 frage: Wyoming in the Van, All Honor to the
 Youngest Territorial Sister."
 Although it is manifest that Baker, who
 was young (27) like most Wyoming men of
 the period, was attracted by Miss Dickinson
 (26)  and Miss Bates (age unknown but
 young), he was repelled by Susan B. Anthony
 (49), whom he described in February 1870 as
 l'the old maid whom celibacy has dried, and
 blasted, and mildewed, until nothing is left
 but a half crazy virago."  One must conclude
 that it was fortunate that Miss Dickinson
 and Miss Bates, rather than Miss Anthony,

 We are also enclosing an editorial from

 Internal Revenue Service would do to this
 man.  As far as we know, all the farmers in
 the and West have been deducting their
 entire water assessment as a business ex-
 p nse  and  this  procedure  was  never
 questioned.   .
 In our case the Internal Revenue agent
 had audited other returns on our own ditch
 and on similar ditches and allowed these
 people to deduct their full water assessment,
 but when he came to ours, he disallowed the
 Water assessment as expense.  When asked
 Why, we were told "he just smartened up
 when he came to ours."  After we refused
 to pay, this man began telephoning us long

 intervals and advised us that we should pay
 the amount owed, that it was small, only
 $135; and several times he stated that we as
 taxpayers had no rights.  Our statement of

 essary.  as would let enough time lapse be-
 tween calls until we would more or less put
 the matter out of our minds and then would
 call again and repeat his warning about our
 paying. We had paid the other part of the
 taxes we owed bit refused to pay, the part
 concerning the water assessment.
 It is our opinion that these calls only
 served to remind us how unfair we think our
 treatment by the Internal Revenue Service
 appears to be.  We are small farmers, whose
 income is not large and during the years for
 Which our returns were audited (1$60, 1961,
 and 190), we prepared our own income tax
 returns.  Our ditch, the Highland Irrigation
 Co., is a very small ditch.
 The latest development in our case is a
 request from the internal Revenue Service
 that we make a 400-mile roundtrip to Den-
 ver for another conference with them, al-
 though the trial date for our case is set up
 in Tax Court for about November 15.  It is
 very Inconvenient for a farmer to make a trip
 during the busy summer season, what with
 irrigating, haying, and other farmwork, for
 a conference at which no pretrial settlement
 would ever be reached. Yet this is what in-
 ternal Revenue Service requests of a tax-
 payer.
 It is also particularly galling to know that
 only ourselves and one other farmer around
 here are the only people to whom the Inter-
 nal, Revenue Service has disallowed the water
 assessment as expense, contrary. to its alle-
 gations otherwise.  This fact, along with the
 agent's treatment of us, makes us hope and
 pray that your investigating committee can
 bring to light the treatment that Internal
 Revenue Service seemingly gives to small
 people.
 Should  you be interested in  any other
 facts on this case, we would be more than
 glad to send them to you and sincerely hope
 that your committee can aid in improving
 Internal Revenue Service policies.
 Very truly yours,
 ROBERT L. and MAE V. HUNTER.

 U.S. TAX AGENTS DENY INTIMIDATION CHARGES
 WASHINGTON.-Internal ' Revenue  Service
 officials from Boston denied at a Senate hear-
 ing  Wednesday 'that they  intimidate                   or
 harass  individuals., "Such charges," they
 said, "are by people who are overemotional or
 trying to kill a case."
 The officials testified before a judiciary
 subcommittee which has heard that IRS
 agents used-electronic eavesdropping devices
 and ' questionable 'Investigative  methods.
 There was testimony, too, about a Treasury
 Department "snooper school,"
 COMPLETES 3-DAY INQUIRY
 The subcommittee completed a 3-day in-
 quiry into the Boston Internal Revenue Serv-
 ice office, after one involving Pittsburgh, Pa.,
 and Chairman  EDWARD  V. LONG, Democrat,
 of Missouri, said "any wiretapping or other
 use of listening devices was the fault of the
 Washington Internal Revenue Service head-
 quarters and not the agents."
 The "snooper school" and the furnishing
 of devices gave implied consent for their use,"
 LONG said, adding "he expects IRS headquar-
 ters to take note of this."
 Alvin M. Kelley, IRS director in Boston,
 said he could understand why some witnesses
 told the subcommittee they were harassed
 or Intimidated.  "But by and large," he said,
 "taxpayers cooperate with us and we with
 them."
 HARASSMENT NOT TOLERATED
 'I can understand, of course," he said,
 "why individuals who have been subjected to
 fraud investigations should subjectively feel
 that they have been harassed-but I assure
 you that our policy and general practice does
 not tolerate harassment."
 Kelley and George L. Wilson, group super-
 visor of IRS Intelligence in Boston, said wire-
 taps are used only in Isolated cases in coop-
 eration with other Federal agencies, and
 principally in security cases.

 ROBERT HUNTER HAS BEEN VICTIM OF
 HARASSMENT BY INTERNAL REVENUE
 (By Earl E. Asbury)
 The                   Internal  Revenue   Service's   case
 against Robert Hunter has dragged on for
 over a year and it is our opinion Mr. Hunter
 has been the victim of persecution, harass-
 ment, and Injustice.
 This is all the more unusual because we
 are used to seeing IRS operate in a coldly
 businesslike way, making its  moves with
 sureness, accuracy, and justice.
 The Hunter case started over a year ago
 when IRS Agent Virgil Richmond, in check-
 ing over Mr. Hunter's tax returns for the
 3 previous years, disallowed the expense de-
 duction Mr. Hunter had taken for that part
 of his Highland Ditch assessment that went
 toward paying for the Highland Dam that
 was installed after the old one washed out
 in the flood of 1955 on the Picketwire River
 12 miles south of Las Animas.
 We do not particularly criticize Mr. Rich-
 mond for questioning the expense initially.
 We do criticize IRS for not clearing up the
 issue cleanly and logically after it came up,
 and applying the same decision to all.
 As it is, Mr. Hunter has been assessed $130
 in back taxes (which he'still refuses to pay).
 He has had a conference with the chief of the
 Denver IRS office in La Junta, another con-
 ference with the IRS appelate division in
 Denver, and now has a hearing scheduled
 for this fall before a tax judge In Denver.
 Most people like to stay as far away from
 the income tax agents as they do from their
 undertaker.  To, have to spend some 2 years
 in the shadow of IRS as Mr. Hunter has had
 to do is unnecessary harassment.  Especially
 since he took the same kind of expense de-
 duction on his income tax form that other
 irrigation  farmers  in  Bent  County   have
 taken since the beginning of time, and are
 still taking.
 In brief, Mr. Hunter considered his whole
 irrigation assessment as a farming expense.
 But IRS contends the Highland Dam which
 was built 9 years ago was a capital improve-
 ment, owned jointly by all the farmers who
 own shares in the Highland Canal Co.
 Ordinarily, if you have a capital improve-
 ment, you can depreciate it.  And if it is
 18685
 destroyed by accident or an act of nature,
 you can benefit on your income tax return
 by claiming a capital loss.
 But IRS seems to feel the dam is so solid
 it isn't depreciating each year. And IRS
 points out the limit of years has passed so
 that farmers under the Highland Ditch can't
 go back now and claim a capital loss on the
 old dam when the flood washed it out.
 (Most local farmers feel building the dam
 wasn't a capital improvement anyway, but
 was merely replacing the old dam as you
 would a roof on your barn.)
 The issue has dragged on too long without
 being resolved.  If Mr. Hunter's expense de-
 duction is going to be allowed, IRS should
 allow it and get off his back.  If not, every
 other farmer under an irrigation ditch in the
 west should get the same treatment as Mr.
 Hunter and should have the portion of his
 ditch assessment that goes toward payment
 of his irrigation dam be disallowed as an ex-
 pense.  Only  one  other  farmer  in  Bent
 County besides Mr. Hunter reported a similar
 disallowment.
 It looks to me as If IRS is just looking for
 trouble. Because it will end up with approx-
 imately the same amount of taxes either
 route it takes.
 If paying for the dam can continue to be
 considered an expense, farmers, can take the
 whole ditch assessment as an expense deduc-
 tion as they have been doing.
 If IRS insists on counting the dam as a
 capital improvement, farmers should be per-
 mitted to take deductions for depreciation
 and capital losses when the dams wash out,
 so that their tax will balance out about the
 same either way in the long run.
 Senator GORDON ALLOTT has introduced a
 bill in Congress to permit farmers to count
 the payments toward the dams as expenses if
 they  choose  to.  It  would  probably  help
 break  the  impasse if  this  bill  would be
 approved.
 THE REBEKAH HARKNESS FOUN-
 DATION AND ITS CONTRIBUTION
 TO THE DANCE
 Mr. McGEE.         Mr. President, a society
 cannot ignore the arts, nor its artists.
 One that does is inevitably poorer and in
 danger of losing much more, indeed.
 Hence it is, Mr. President, that we should
 give honor to those who enrich our art
 forms.  It is with this in mind that I
 refer to an article from the July 28 issue
 of the New York Herald Tribune regard-
 ing Mrs. Rebekah Harkness' contribu-
 tions in time and in money to the dance.
 . Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that this report from the Herald
 Tribune be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE  HARKNESS  CREDO: TALENT  MUST  BE
 SERVED
 (By Walter Terry)
 "The people who stay in the middle don't
 interest me," said Rebekah Harkness, com-
 poser,                                                                                                                                       sculptor and patroness of the arts.
 "It is the artist or the delinquent I care
 about-the point is to do something for the
 two extremes: on the one hand, to give the
 artist opportunities to release his talent; and
 on the other hand, to help the delinquent
 find himself through the disciplines of art."
 To this end, Mrs. Harkness, through her
 own Rebekah Harkness Foundation and the
 foundation established by her late husband,
 William Hale Harkness, has provided des-
 perately needed funds (totaling millions of
 dollars) to the arts, and to dance in particu-
 lar.   Harkness  sponsorship  aided  Jerome
 Robbins' Ballets U.S.A. in a European tour,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE          August 4, 1965
 promoted the Robert Jogrey Ballet from a
 small national company to one of interna-
 tional stature, and made possible free dance
 events, in collaboration with the New York
 Shakespeare Festival, in Central Park's Dela-
 corte Theater.
 A year ago, the Harkness dance enterprises
 embarked on new and expanded programs.
 The Harkness Ballet, which now numbers ap-
 proximately 30 dancers, was founded with
 George Skibine and Donald Saddler as its
 artistic and assistant artistic director, re-
 spectively.  The initial tour, which began in
 1965, was booked in Europe and provided the
 new company with a sort of glorified New
 Haven in which to try out its new works and
 to discover its incipient strengths and pass-
 ing weaknesses.
 At the same time, Mrs. Harkness purchased
 the old  Thomas Watson townhouse and
 launched the long and expensive process of
 having it converted into the Harkness House
 for the Ballet Arts In New York City. When
 it opens in the fall, as the home of the
 Harkness Ballet and as a center for ballet
 seminars, workshops, lecture-demonstrations,
 art exhibits related to dance, its many
 studios will foster not only ballet but music,
 design and literature as they relate to ballet.
 "It has," says Mrs. Harkness of the new
 ballet house, "the airs and graces ofa palazzo.
 Maybe I'll be criticized for its elegance but
 I do think that beautiful surroundings are
 important to the working artist.  And I'm
 serious when I use the word 'working.'  I
 mentioned earlier, didn't I, that I'm not con-
 cerned with those individuals who stay in
 the middle?  Well, this means I'm interested
 in the.worker-artist.  For example, there is
 the professional-the real pro-who does a
 fine job on the equivalent of the good old
 9 to 5 basis. I care about the one that
 works to 5:45, that works extra. The former
 is a 90 percenter.  He rarely does anything
 memorable.   It's the extra 10 percent which
 counts. I guess it's the difference between
 the -adequate and the inspirational.
 "No, I'm not enough of a nut to believe
 that time heals all wounds nor that time
 creates talent.  I'm not even certain just
 what makes for talent in the individual-
 chemical factors?  Inspiration?  love?-but
 if' talent is there, it needs time to grow.
 Nobody can put talent into another being.
 My job, and my privilege, Is comparatively
 ,simple and that is to give release to talent
 that is already there.  Maybe it's a minor
 talent--although we pray it is major-rbut it
 too deserves a chance.  To put it bluntly,
 at our summer workshop at Watch Hill, R.I.,
 and, later, at our headquarters in New York,
 the plan is to give choreographers, composers
 and designers the time to work out their
 ideas and if they have that mysterious thing,
 if' they have something to say, this is the
 opportunity provided them in which to say
 it.   It  doesn't always  work out.   But it
 might.    And the 'might' is worth all the ex-
 pense and the effort."
 This summer, at Mrs. Harkness' arts center
 in Rhode Island-a, firehouse converted into
 two large studios, other studios in her own
 house, a complete inn for the many married
 couples in her troupe--the creative opportu-
 nities for a wide range of artists are being
 given the time and the release that Mrs.
 Harkness believes are the right of the poten-
 tial holder of talent.
 Donald McKayle (represented choreograph-
 ically on Broadway in "Golden Boy" is work-
 ing on a new ballet with an Israeli theme;
 Sophie Maslow is restaging her successful
 "The Dybbuk;" Alvin Ailey, who has already
 created two successful works for the Hark-
 ness Ballet, is at work on "Maeumba," with a
 score by Mrs. Harkness herself; and the Henry
 Street Playhouse's Alwin Nikolais is moving
 out of his own distinguished home for a rare
 occasionto create a new work for the Hark-
 ness Ballet.
 Other choreographic highlights of the sum-
 mer workshop at Watch Hill include a new
 version, by John Butler, of "Chan Carlo Men-
 otti's Sebastion"; Mr. Saddler's new American
 Indian ballet, "Koshari, " with a score by the
 Indian composer Louis Ballard;, a piece by
 Mr. Skibine to a new scare by Carlos Su-
 rinach; Stuart Hodes' "Free for All," to music
 of Paul Bowles, and other ballets by Mr. Sad-
 dler (an Alice in Wonderland Through the
 Looking Glass piece), William Dollar, Leon
 Fokine, Karoby Barta, Richard Wagner and
 others.
 The ambitious program-the Workshop at
 Watch Hill, Harkness House in New York,
 a second Harkness Ballet tour of Europe in
 19666,  a  Rebekah  Harkness  Foundation
 Dance Festival in Central Park this fall-are
 but a part--albeit major-of the Harkness
 plans. "I think it's important," says the
 slim, supple (she takes ballet class and yoga
 exercises daily), youthful mother of three
 grown children, "to help dancers develop sec-
 ondary talents. Why should dancers have to
 fear that awful moment when the muscles
 just won't do the job any more?  I'd like to
 see them ready with another skill-maybe
 design, perhaps music, teaching, therapy-
 whiCh will extend their earning capacities
 for many years."
 A long-range project has to do with men
 in the ballet.  Mrs. Harkness recognizes the
 fact that dancing for men in subjected to
 the incontrovertibly erroneous notion that
 dance is a feminine art but, more important,
 that the all-American "pop" is worried that
 his son won't make a dependable living. For
 this outmoded attitude, Mrs. Harkness has
 a. campaign in mind,
 "My idea," says Mrs. Harkness, "is to send
 lecture-demonstration programs out to as
 many schools as possible.  Whom do we want
 for male. dancers in American ballet?  We
 want the types you find in high school gym-
 nasiums.  We need to win them over at that
 vulnerable age-and their parents, too. For
 these boys from our gymnasiums, given the
 training, can do anything that the Bolshoi
 Ballet wonder kids can do.
 "And, I guess, this brings us back to where
 we started, my function.  I'm a composer
 and I work at it hard.  I'm also a sculptor-
 I've got a figure, in the next room, with all
 its muscles lying about and I'd better get 'em
 into place-but my own foundation and Bill
 Harkness' foundation have set out to help
 ballet in America.  Mistakes will be made,
 that is inescapable. But the artists of the
 ballet have, over the years, brought so much
 to us that I feel that my job is to bring to
 them -in time, in opportunity, in release, in
 encouragement, in financial help and stimu-
 lating surroundipgc..F?giat I cap."

 A GI'S
 There being no abjection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 A GI's LAST LErrms FROM VIETNAM
 (NOTE.-On Memorial Day, a widow shares
 her pride in a husband who went to a war-
 torn land where his beliefs were put to the
 ultimate test--but never faltered.)
 Mrs. Barbara Spruill, Suffern, N.Y.:
 "On April 22, 1964, I was at my sister's
 house, when the telephone rang.   I could
 hear  her  talking:  'Yes,  she's here. * * *
 Read it to me. * * * Yes, I'll tell her.'
 "She didn't have to tell me, though--I
 sensed that a telegram had been delivered to
 my home; a neighbor, guessing its contents,
 had phoned my sister.
 "My husband, Capt. James P. Spruill, had
 been killed the previous day in Vietnam.  I
 learned later that his jeep had struck a land
 mine.
 "Our daughter, Elizabeth, 4, cried when I
 told her that daddy would not come home.
 But our son, Mark, 7, understood and was
 a great comfort to me.
 "After the children were in bed, I took
 Jim's letters and sorted and typed them un-
 til the early-morning hours.  I had a reason.
 Some of the people who sympathized with
 me felt that Jim had died -without cause,
 that I had been widowed and my children
 left fatherless by a senseless death. We never
 believed this.  Jim was a selfless man dedi-
 cated to a great responsibility-a responsibil-
 ity to his country and to other people.  He
 loved the Vietnamese and, as you shall see,
 never doubted that the good he could do
 outweighed the risks he faced.
 "On this Memorial ' Day, I wish to share
 our pride in Jim's sacrifice with you. Here
 are excerpts from some of his letters."
 It Is a privilege to work with the Viet-
 namese (self-defense corps). Frustrating at
 times because he is backward, poorly trained,
 and-generally speaking--an amateur at al-
 most everything he does.  But in spite of his
 faults he is the most genuine and kind hu-
 man I have met.  Simple, humble, willing,
 and warm-they are wonderful people.  If
 the press judges them harshly at times, it
 would be well to remember that they have
 had their independence only 9 years, and
 they never have had the opportunity to de-
 velop leadership, civic and otherwise.
 It was brought to my attention last night
 that we were once inadequately equipped
 and  poorly  trained  and  that professional
 soldiers came from afar to aid the fledging
 American Army In Its fight for freedom and
 internal order.  Two of these "advisers" are

 only in a selfish way. In a better, more

 Christmases, for our little family is giving
 of itself to the world. We are sacrificing, you
 and, I, for the good of other people, and that
 is truly Christlike.
 Last night, on Christmas Eve, I went down
 town to a Catholic service.  There were
 Children everywhere, and there was a Santa
 Claus,. slant eyes and all.  I saw a small
 child that reminded, me of another child I
 know, and it was all I could . do to keep
 smiling.  But you know, the mother read
 what was in my eyes and brought the child
 over to me. 'I picked it up, sat it in my lap
 and held, it, and for a wonderfully warm
 moment East and West were one in heart.
 It was a wonderful Christmas. I want you
 to understand that.  Before I fell asleep, I
 had to cry a little. But even as.I did so, I
 knew I did not cry out of sorrow or self-pity.
 I cried because my heart was so full of hap-
 piness and gratitude that it could not hold
 it all. I was sublimely happy because I have
 had the three of you.
 However, my post Is a bit quieter than
 others. Last night, for example, we showed a
 movie in the market and that helps keep
 things quiet because the local VC (Viet-
 cong) like to see the movies, too.  Strange
 thing to sit there in the night, a pistol in
 your hand, and laugh at animated cartoons
 with members of the VC. ,
 At the moment, the war does not go well.
 You read- enough about that.  I feel that
 there is too much talk of despair.  I warned
 you of that before I left.  You may remem
 ber.  Above all, this is a war of mind and
 spirit. And it is a war which can be won
 no matter what present circumstances, are.
 For us to despair would be. a great victory
 for the enemy.  We must stand strong and
 unafraid and give heart to an embattled
 and confused people.  This cannot be done
 if America loses heart.
 At the moment, my heart is big enough
 to sustain those around me.  Please don't
 let them, back where you are, sell me down
 the river with talk of despair and defeat.
 Tall; instead of. steadfastness, loyalty, and

 I must admit that there are many mo-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE           August 4, 1965
 So I find it good-good indeed--to be with
 you in this place, at this time.  Thank you
 for inviting me.
 Four years have gone by since we were last
 together at an annual meeting of the Mis-
 souri Farmers Association.  Since 19611 have
 come to know the membership of this orga-
 nization better than I did then-many of the
 more than 150,000 of you personally-all of
 you through the quality of your organiza-
 tion and the character of the leadership you
 chose for it.
 These associations and observations have
 led me to two conclusions about the Mis-
 souri Farmers Association.
 One is that you do not accept progress as
 inevitable.  You look  upon progress as  a
 process demanding imagination and crea-
 tivity * * * sensitivity and sensibility * * *
 anticipation and dedication * * * and plain
 hard work.
 The other is that you consistently operate
 from the premise that what's good for the
 farm families of Missouri and the Nation
 Is good for the Missouri Farmers Association.
 I've seen you apply this principle internally,
 as you weighed possible immediate advan-
 tages for your cooperative enterprises against
 the potential for long-term gains and in the
 whole of agriculture; and I've seen you apply
 it in helping create and Implement national
 farm and food policies and programs.
 For establishing and following these com-
 mendable standards, you have my admiration
 and respect.
 This organization's spirit and Its concept
 of proper priority-as well as the personal
 philosophy and abilities you have recognized
 for a quarter of a century-have contributed
 to making your Fred Heinkel an internation-
 ally recognized agricultural leader.
 Fred Heinkel holds the dual role of  an
 architect, and a builder, in the food and
 agriculture policies and programs of the
 1960's.
 Few commodity programs, now or in the
 past, have records of performance and pop-
 ularityequalling that of our present feed
 grains program.  It was the first big step in
 bringing farm production policy into har-
 mony with the era of abundance.  The chair-
 man of the advisory committee which played
 a major part in the creation of the feed
 grains  program,  and  in  perfecting  it
 through the years since  1961, was Fred
 Heinkel.
 Fred, I want MFA members to know that
 no one has done more for American agricul-
 ture through this period of almost 5 years
 than you.  And if you will accept a personal
 tribute, I want to express my own high re-
 gard and warm affection.
 Earlier I recalled it has been,4 years since
 I attended an annual MFA meeting.  At that
 time we discussed what needed doing in the
 decade of the 1960's to correct inequities
 that were denying parity of income oppor-
 tunity to our farm families and threatening
 the destruction of the free enterprise family
 farm system.
 Since then, working together, we have cor-
 rected, and we have innovated.
 We have broadened the avenues of eco-
 nomic, educational and social opportunity
 for the people of rural America-farm and
 nonfarm.
 By combining the abilities, the knowledge,
 the resources and the purposes of people
 and government we have moved steadily
 upward on a number of fronts from the low
 levels of 1960.
 As Al Smith once said: "Let's look at the
 record."
 Farm earnings today are substantially bet-
 ter than they were. Realized net farm income
 in this year of 1965 is now expected to total
 $13.5 billion-the highest since 1953 and
 some $1.8 billion more than our farm fami-
 lies earned in 1960.
 Today's income is better than that of 1960
 because we've succeeded in moving to more
 equitable farm price levels.  In the early
 summer of 1960 the average return to farm-
 ers from soybeans was $1.94 a bushel.  This
 year it was $2.72-78 cents a bushel more.
 Here are some other early summer of 1960
 and 1965 comparisons:
 Corn: $1.09 a bushel, then $1.30 now.
 Hogs: $16.20 a hundredweight then, $22.70
 now.
 Cattle: $21.70 then, $23 a hundredweight
 now.
 Lambs: $20.10 then, $25 a hundredweight
 now.
 Wool: 45 cents a pound then, 49 cents a
 pound now.
 All hay: $15.90 then, $20 a ton now.
 Farm spending Is better than it was.  The
 income gains are reflected in improved rural
 town and city economies as sales of goods
 and services to farmers trend upward. Last
 year, when gross farm income was $4 billion
 over the  total  of  1980,  farmers increased
 their expenditures for automobiles by over
 $600 million and boosted other expenditures
 for capital goods and machinery by another
 $400  million.   Better  living on  the farm
 means better living in St. Louis, Kansas City,
 Detroit, and Rock Island.
 Food is a better bargain than it was.  For
 the millions of American consumers, food is
 the best buy they find in retail stores. This
 year, for the average family, food costs will
 take about 18.3 percent of income after taxes.
 In 1960, food required 20 percent-and the
 diet contained less beef.  If the same per-
 centage of income were being spent for food
 in 1965 as consumers were spending in 1960,
 they would have $7 billion less to spend on
 other things.
 Food distribution is better than it was.
 We're doing a much-improved job of making
 our food abundance cover the whole of our
 society-our  families requiring  public  as-
 sistance,  and  our  school  children.                                                                                    The
 USDA's food programs are now reaching over
 40 million American adults and youngsters
 each year.  The volume of food distributed
 through these domestic programs has in-
 creased from 900 million pounds in 1959-60
 to 2.1 billion pounds in 1964-65.  In addi-
 tion, a growing volume of food is moving
 into  the   homes  of  low-income  families
 through  commercial    channels  under  the
 food stamp program.
 Farm exports are better than they were.
 Sales of agricultural commodities overseas
 are expected to reach a new record of $6.1
 billion in the current fiscal year.  It will be
 the second year in a row with farm exports
 in excess of $6 billion, as compared with
 $4.5 billion in fiscal 1960.  This means more
 than better markets, better incomes, for farm
 families-it means expanded job and income
 opportunities in the areas of processing and
 shipping-and it makes a substantial contri-
 bution to a favorable balance of payments.
 From a humanitarian standpoint and from a
 commercial standpoint the expanded utili-
 zation of American food and fiber abroad
 contains the greatest opportunity for maxi-
 mum use of our great food production plant.
 In this effort there is need for the facilities
 and the skills of our cooperatives, and the
 interest  demonstrated  by  MFA  is  most
 welcome.
 The supply-demand relationship is better
 than it was.  Surpluses are down.  Carry-
 over stocks of grain by the end of the year
 will be at the lowest level since the mid-
 1950's, which means greater farm price stabil-
 ity and a cut in storage and handling costs
 for taxpayers.
 We can take pride and satisfaction in these
 achievements.
 What we've done in the past 4 years is
 proof it Is possible to base a reasonable,
 progressive, serviceable food and agricultural
 policy on a concept of abundance rather than
 scarcity, benefiting producers and consumer
 alike.
 That doesn't mean we have achieved full
 parity in income opportunity for our ade-
 quate; commercial family farms or that rural
 America as a whole is moving ahead In job
 and other opportunities as rapidly as it must
 to reach our goal of parity of opportunity.
 But we're on the right track.
 Whether we stay on it depends upon the
 decisions the Congress makes this month on
 legislation that will make it possible to con-
 tinue-with a variety of improvements-the
 policies that have provided fuel for the steady
 progress made since 1960.
 Let me emphasize that these legislative
 proposals are not designed to maintain the
 status  quo.  While  incorporating  the  dy-
 namic parts of our past experience, the om-
 nibus farm bill Is designed to encourage de-
 velopment of an agricultural plant and a
 family farm economy that will respond to
 the potentials of the future.
 The same mechanisms that made things
 better than they were are not necessarily
 sufficient to make them better than they are,
 Enactment of forward-looking legislation
 is mandatory  to  a  forward-moving  rural
 economy, a forward-moving national econ-
 omy.
 Failure to act will be catastrophic to both.
 Studies made by the Congress, by univer-
 sity economists, and others agree that if we
 fail to extend our farm commodity programs
 we will quickly experience a decline of as
 much as 50 percent from the current, still
 inadequate net farm income level.
 Anyone can understand a 50-percent pay
 cut, and its impact upon  the individual
 family directly affected.  But let me turn
 your attention, and the attention of the
 entire Nation, to what such a blow to the
 farm economy would mean to the whole of
 the country's economic well-being.
 A qui,k look at the farm credit situation is
 most revealing:
 On January 1, 1965, the total farm debt
 amounted to $36 billion.  That's 45 percent
 more than it was just 5 years ago.  It is
 nearly 200 percent over the farm debt total
 of 1950.
 It is a matter of L-cep, personal concern to
 the farm families who owe it. It should also
 be a matter of both humanitarian and eco-
 nomic concern to nonfarmers, because  if
 farm families cannot pay it, city families
 are going to be in trouble, too.
 The  debt  situation  in  agriculture is
 neither better, nor worse, than in other sec-
 tors of the economy.                                                                                                                                      Farm debt has in-
 creased at about the same rate as the debt
 of corporations, and at a somewhat slower
 rate than consumer debt and private non-
 corporate debt.
 Indications  are that the sharp  rise  In
 farm debt is not due to the use of credit as a
 substitute for income.
 Rather, the increase has resulted largely
 from borrowing by farmers to increase the
 efficiency of their operations, and borrowing
 by young farmers becoming established on
 adequate family farms.  And comparatively
 few of them are having debt difficulties so
 far-this fact is made clear by the excellent
 record made by farm lending institutions in
 collections from 1961 through 1964, and the
 near-record low levels of delinquencies and
 foreclosures.
 If we succeed in maintaining the farm in-
 come gains of the past 4 years; if we continue
 our already significant progress toward full
 parity of income opportunity for the oper-
 ators of the growing numbers of adequate
 family farms, the farm debt situation is not
 likely to cause serious difficulties for most
 farmers, for the communities which provide
 them with goods and services, or for the
 urban factory workers dependent upon rural
 markets  for  a substantial share of  their
 employment.
 However, a sharp decline in farm income
 resulting from failure to continue construc-
 tive farm and food policies and programs
 would, on the other hand, quickly upset the

 entire rural credit structure.  It would de-
 prive farmers of the ability to borrow or to
 repay the massive debt load they carry today.
 It would mean wholesale foreclpsure and
 liquidation. It would mean rural chaos that
 would quickly infect the entire economy.
 Once again newspapers would repeat, in
 headlines, the old adage that depressions are
 farm led and farm fed.
 The times of truly great tragedy in rural
 America have been the times of mass fore-
 closures.  In this community and in others
 across the land, scars still remain as a re-
 minder of the last time an accelerated down-
 grading of the value of a man, his family,
 and his farm made it impossible for the
 family farmer to make the payments on his
 mortgage.
 The stakes are big this month as the Con-
 gress prepares to act on the Great Society
 farm program.  If it is enacted into law,
 we can look forward to steady progress, and
 it wouldn't be unreasonable at all to antici-
 pate in the next 4 years a repeat of the thou-
 sand-dollay gain in realized net income. per
 farm of the last 4 years.
 But-if we fail to build upon. the experi-
 ence and the programs and the progress of
 the 1961-65 period, the outlook will be grim
 indeed.  If failure to adopt reasonable, pur-
 poseful legislation brings a drop in net farm
 income from the current level down to just
 $6 billion a year, every American will suffer.
 In that event the efficient family farm struc-
 ture that now ranks among the wonders of
 the modern world Would be wiped out.  No
 one can predict what might replace it, but
 the food abundan  r and fair prices con-
 sumers now accept as casually as the air they
 breathe would be gravely threatened.
 If we fail to respond to both the responsi-
 bility and the opportunity contained in the
 food and agriculture bill now before our
 Congress, we'll appear in the coloring book
 of history painted thoughtless and indiffer-
 ent-perhaps even ruthless.
 I believe in the positive approach-and so
 do you, or you couldn't face up to the year-
 after-year,  season-after-season  hazards  of
 farming.
 I can sense, a growing realization among
 all the people of our country that they have
 a good thing going for them in the, policies
 and programs that give rural America sta-
 bility and sound growth prospects; give ur-
 ban America an abundance of good food at
 fair prices;  and, give the hungry of the
 world not only, a source of food, but a
 fountain of know-how that can improve their
 ability to feed themselves.
 If that realization comes to flower in terms
 of constructive legislation this month, the
 prospects are excellent that the twin goals of
 parity of income for the adequate family
 farm and parity of opportunity for all of
 rural America can be reached by the end
 of the sixties,
 Let's keep our wa o.  hitched to that star.

 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, Life mag-
 azine has this week summed up the
 situation in Vietnam in an editorial,
 "Johnson Means Business in Vietnam,"
 which clearly outlines the nature of
 America's goal:
 Russian communism, a generation older
 than Chinese, was contained in Europe by
 20 years of Western force and firmness and
 is now beginning to look more like a version
 of Russian national interest than the un-
 appeasable firebrand it once was.
 The implication there is clear, but it
 is spelled out nonetheless;  Life points
 out that Asia's Red tyrants are aging
 and that their successors-
 will be inevitably influenced by the inherited
 structure of their world. If they see a string
 of victories behind the openings ahead, with
 the West in wavering retreat, they will be
 more revolutionary than their predecessors.
 If their prospect is instead one in which the
 rim of Asia is a strongly guarded homeland
 of free and prospering people, the younger
 Reds may choose to concentrate on their
 copious domestic problems and follow the
 Russian example of a mature revolution.
 It is possible, Mr. President, to con-
 tain Red Chinese imperialism. To those
 who doubt this, to those who raise the
 dogmas laid down by military leaders
 about wars in Asia, Life has an answer:
 If it is dogmas we need, America has some
 good ones:  The belief that America has a
 purpose as well as interests in the world,
 that the purpose and the interests are not
 regional but global, and that American free-
 dom cannot be protected at the cost of those
 whose freedom we have promised to defend.
 Vietnam is the place where these beliefs once
 more are put to the test.
 I ask unanimous consent that this edi-
 torial from Life be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 JOHNSON MEANS BUSINESS  IN  VIETNAM
 "This is really war," said President John-
 -son.                                                                        But not a "national emergency"; that
 he refused to declare. A similar ambivalence
 marked his whole report to the people on
 his  much publicized full-dress review  of
 our Vietnam policy last week.
 Vietnam is enough of a real war so that
 he has doubled the draft call to 35,000 a
 month and is now sending another 50,000
 troops to support the deteriorating Viet-
 namese resistance.  On the other hand, he
 rejected the immediate call up of reservists
 and saw no present need for civilian belt-
 tightening.  Our national war aim is per-
 haps more resolute but still defensive: to
 prevent  Communist  domination  of  Asia.
 Unchanged also, though more emphatic, is
 our readiness for "unconditional discussions
 with any government at any place at any
 time."   In sum,  the President's prescrip-
 tion for Vietnam is a marked intensifica-
 tion of what we are already doing-i.e., more
 of the same.
 "More" means deeper involvement in a
 remote and tragic land where an increas-
 ing number of Americans are in fact al-
 ready  dying-over  400  since  February  1.
 Their death places have names like Phu Bai,
 Danang, Ban Me Thout, Kontum, Pleiku.
 These place names may someday be chis-
 eled on monuments in Michigan and Kan-
 sas,                                                                        under those other names,  once also
 thought exotic,  like Chateau-Thierry, An-
 zio, Tarawa, Pusan.
 "The same" means that any further es-
 calation of the conflict will be by steps as
 carefully measured as in the past. We fight,
 says Johnson, to force or induce a negotiated
 settlement, not  to  invite  "an  expanding
 struggle with consequences that no one can
 perceive."  This caution, coupled with his
 renewed appeals for peace initiatives from
 other nations and from the U.N., may dis-
 arm some critics of the morality of Johnson's
 Vietnam policy, especially those from abroad.
 But while it leaves the President still in
 control of all the options on the escalation
 ladder,  it  does  not  answer  certain  other
 doubts about the practical effectiveness of
 that policy.  Some of the Congressmen who
 support it do so with more fatalism than
 conviction.   For in this kind of war, more
 of the same may not be enough.
 "Americans do not like long, inconclusive
 wars.  This is going to be a long, incon-
 clusive war. "  The words are Ho Chi Minh's
 in 1962.  "Son, don't ever get yourself bogged
 down in a land war in Asia."  The words are
 attributed to General MacArthur on his
 deathbed and often quoted by Lyndon John-
 son himself.  These two dogmas have im-
 planted a seed of defeatism in the American
 mind.
 It is part of the long-war dogma that you
 can't beat guerrillas  without  great  man-
 power superiority, the minimum ratio being
 something put as high at 10 to 1. The South
 Vietnamese Army, decimated by casualties
 and desertions, is now three times the known
 strength  (about 165,000)  of the Vietcong.
 if American troops were to redress the nu-
 merical ratio, it would take over a million of
 them.  Even if these troops were to pacify
 the entire surface of South Vietnam, so runs
 the long-war dogma.  Ho Chi Minh's "jungle
 Marxism" would go on burning underground
 like a mine fire.
 From this glum prospect the MacArthur
 dogma jogs loose a positive fear:  that the
 "bogging down" of American troops on the
 Asian mainland is an actual aim of Com-
 munist long-term strategy.  It would drain
 and pin down their No. 1 enemy and clear
 the  road  for   aggression  elsewhere.  As
 Walter Lippmann keeps arguing, the United
 States cannot police the entire world, and
 southeast Asia, where U.S. security is not di-
 rectly threatened, is a bad place to commit
 U.S. power. Says Senator RUSSELL, head of
 the Armed Services Committee and no ad-
 vocate of withdrawal, "I have never been
 able to see any strategic, political, or eco-
 nomic advantage to be gained by our in-
 volvement" in Vietnam.
 These dogmas, fortunately, have not gov-
 erned President Johnson's decisions.
 Ho Chi Minh's guerrilla tactics are indeed
 successful in the countryside, but they still
 require him to avoid pitched battles, which
 he would lose against superior United States-
 Vietnamese firepower.  They are much less
 useful against the big cities without which he
 cannot conquer South Vietnam.  Moreover,
 Ho's accumulation of small victories has been
 compounded by some Pentagon errors in the
 conduct of this war, particularly as to timing.
 Because of the reluctant and creeping pace
 of our commitment, we have generally op-
 posed Ho with too little and too late.
 The U.S. commitment in Vietnam is much
 deeper now.  Our men already have combat
 missions which they are rapidly learning to
 make more effective.  The buildup of five
 major bases, toward control of the entire
 east coast, is of dimensions not seen in Asia
 since the Korean war.   The air raids on
 North Vietnam have many scores of richer
 targets on their agenda before the possibility
 of Chinese intervention (or more Russian
 aid) need deter us.  Ambassador Lodge re-
 sumes his post with ideas for a new program
 than can rekindle both the villagers' military
 resistance and their political hope.
 As for Communism's grander strategy, it
 is of course impossible for the United States
 to fight tyranny at all times and in all places.
 But it is perfectly possible to contain Red
 Chinese imperialism if we so decide.
 Russian communism, a generation older
 than Chinese, was contained in Europe by 20
 years of Western force and firmness and is
 now beginning to look more like a version
 of Russian national interest than the unap-
 peasable firebrand it once was.  The Com-
 munist tyrants of Asia are now old men-
 Mao Tse-tung, 71; Ho, 75-soon to be suc-
 ceeded by a new generation.  The strategies
 of this  generation  will  be inevitably  in-
 fluenced by the inherited structure of their
 world.  If they see a string of victories be-
 hind the openings ahead, with the West in
 wavering retreat, they will be more revolu-
 tionary than their predecessors. If their pros-
 pect is instead one in which the rim of Asia
 is a strongly guarded homeland of free and
 prospering people, the younger Reds may
 choose to concentrate on their copious do-
 mestic problems and follow the Russian ex-
 ample of a "mature" revolution.
 However that may be, this is no time for
 defeatism about Asia,  China is not, either

 now or Inevitably, a superpower dominating
 her neighbors; only their fear, induced by
 American withdrawal, could make her so.
 The President refuses to speculate whether
 the Vietnam war will last for "months-or
 years---or decades," and such speculation is
 indeed bootless until our new commitment
 there has shown its military results.
 If it is dogmas we need, America has some
 good ones: the belief that America has a pur-
 pose as well as interests in the world, that the
 purpose and the interests are not regional
 but global, and that American freedom can-
 not be protected at the cost of those whose
 freedom we have promised to defend.  Viet-
 nam is the place where these beliefs once
 more are put to the test.
 THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY
 COAST GUARD
 Mr. PELL.   Mr. President, I am proud
 to endorse the resolution introduced by
 my distinguished  colleague,  Senator
 MAGNUSON, of Washington, establishing
 August 4 as U.S. Coast Guard Day in
 commemoration of the 175th birthday
 of this great armed force and humani-
 tarian service.
 The Coast Guard has always been of
 great personal interest to me.  Four
 months prior to the attack on Pearl Har-
 themselves in every theater of opera-
 tion.  Many a Coast Guardsman never
 returned to his home and loved ones.
 Some lie buried in lonely graves in the
 oceans of the world. They have left us
 a heritage of valor which will never be
 forgotten.
 For myself, I remember with pride
 that, in 1957, the Coast Guard cutter
 Spar returned to her home port of Bris-
 tol, R.I., after completing the first cir-
 cumnavigation of the North American
 Continent by an American vessel.  This
 was a significant event in the history of
 navigation. By her action, the Spar ful-
 filled the dream of navigators since the
 time of the Cabots to find an eastward
 passage across the-top-of the continent.
 Along with my fellow Americans I say:
 Congratulations Coast Guard on your
 175th birthday.  The prayers and best
 wishes of the American people go with
 you for many additional years of reward-
 ing service to country and humanity.
 NATIONAL TEACHER CORPS WILL
 USE  YOUTHFUL  COMMITMENT
 AND SERVICE
 Mr. NELSON.  Mr. President, a few
 days ago Vice President HuMPHREY de-
 livered a moving address to young Gov-
 ernment interns at the annual meeting
 of the White House seminar. He praised
 this new generation for restoring the ex-
 citement of dialog and questioning to
 America's college campuses.
 Large numbers of young people now
 are active in campus intellectual fer-
 ment, unselfish in commitments to social
 justice, and willing to devote productive
 years to service.  These youthful quali-
 ties, the Vice President concludes, create
 the climate for such national efforts as
 the Peace Corps, VISTA-and now the
 National Teacher Corps.
 In view of the timeliness of this excel-
 lent assessment of the state of America's
 young people, I feel all Members of the
 Congress should have an opportunity
 to read it. I ask unanimous consent that
 it be printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 I am honored to be with you this morning
 at the annual meeting of the White House
 seminar.
 I have had the privilege of meeting with
 this group for each of the past 3 years.
 First, let me say that we are pleased to
 have your services, if only for one summer.
 Even in so short a time you can make signif
 ioant contributions here in Washington. And
 I think you will gain, too-if only from see-
 ing just how things work here.  I hope you
 will put this experience to good use.  At the
 risk of  sounding  like  a  commencement
 speaker, I will say that your generation faces
 great tasks and that you will need all the
 experience and knowledge you can get.
 We are surrounded today by a technology
 which is still in its infancy.
 Information is already running ahead of
 our ability to use it.
 We have wealth and power to do great
 work-or to destroy ourselves.
 The point I want to make this morning
 may seem self-evident.  But it bears repeat-
 ing.
 The point is this: That this Nation and
 world will survive and prosper only if indi-
 vidual man  can control the great forces
 moving about us.
 As society becomes increasingly compli-
 cated--and, therefore, by necessity, increas-
 ingly organized-there is danger of losing
 sight of the individual.
 It is precisely in such a complex society
 that the individual's needs are greatest.  And
 it is in such a society that we need men and
 women able to exercise individual judgment
 and to take individual initiative.
 That is why this administration is com-
 mitted to giving each child entering life full,
 equal, and free opportunity for personal ful-
 fillment, while at the same time providing
 for the general welfare.
 We seek to create an environment where
 each American can contribute to and share
 in the betterment of the human condition.
 We seek to create an environment in which
 each man may and will be able to do some-
 thing for all men.  This is the goal of the
 Great Society.
 But we will not reach that goal by govern-
 ment  initiative  alone.   It  will  only  be
 reached, finally, by the commitment, involve-
 ment, and action of individual Americans,
 each working where he Is.
 Is our American society today a society of
 individual involvement? Or is it, as some
 have charged, a society of individual aliena-
 tion?
 The test is what is happening around us--
 by the signs and symptoms.  I think the
 signs and symptoms are positive.   I think
 they give us reason for hope and confidence
 concerning the fate of Individual man as
 well as our society In general.
 There is no question, In fact, in my mind
 that your generation is indeed a generation
 of Involvement.
 The best example of this is seen in ac-
 tivity and ferment on campuses across our
 country.  This should not be cause for worry.
 What is happening indicates that the excite-
 ment of dialog and questioning has returned
 to the campus.
 It was not so long ago that we had a
 college  generation  of  apathy  and  com-
 placency-a generation of people who simply
 didn't care about much except their own
 comfort and security, a generation moved
 by the herd Instinct.  But apathy and com-
 placency are not the- mark of your genera-
 tion.
 The fact is that more and more young
 Americans  are devoting  their productive
 years to service.
 Some people call this "do-goodism."  But
 let me say that I pray the day never comes
 in our country when a man's best efforts
 to aid his fellows-to. "do good"-are re-
 jected.
 Our young people are not selfish.    The
 young people of America know that life is
 better for them than it was for their par-
 ents.  They know for certain that it is much
 better than it was for their grandparents.
 But they are not saying to themselves and
 others, "Let's just keep it for ourselves."
 This generation, the President has said,
 may well become known as the volunteer
 generation.
 More than 10,000 young volunteers are now
 serving in the Peace Corps.  More than 3,000
 have already returned.  And more than 100,-
 000 have asked to participate in this bold
 bor I enlisted in the ,Coast Guard, my
 first duty being that of ships' cook. At
 the end of the war I held the rank of
 lieutenant and have now the honor of be-
 ing a captain in the Coast Guard Reserve.
 In the State of Rhode Island, we have
 long been aware of the beneficent pres-
 ence of the Coast Guard.  We know of
 its unceasing efforts to provide a greater
 measure of safety to all who travel on or
 over the sea,  Its extensive lifesaving
 network has saved many thousands of
 lives and billions of dollars in property.
 Thousands of Rhode Island boatmen
 have been the beneficiaries of the Coast
 Guard's work.  In the past year alone,
 the Coast Guard was responsible for sav-
 ing or rescuing from peril more than.
 130,000 persons and the value of ships
 and cargo saved was nearly $1 billion
 or approximately two and one-half times
 the Coast Guard's annual budget. That
 is a, very good return, indeed, for the
 American taxpayer's dollar.
 Besides serving the noble cause of
 safety at sea, the Coast Guard is hard
 at work expanding our knowledge of the
 sea upon which our future survival may
 depend. Its highly trained port security
 organization stands ready to protect our
 waterfronts and harbors from hostile
 action in the event of emergency, and
 its approximately 32,000 officers and en-
 listed personnel maintain themselves in
 a state of constant military readiness to
 serve with the Navy should the need
 arise.
 Several weeks ago, the Coast Guard
 demonstrated its readiness to respond to
 emergencies by dispatching, at the Navy's
 request, 17 of its 82-foot patrol boats to
 help counter North Vietnamese efforts to
 supply Communist Vietcong units in the
 Republic of Vietnam.
 As our country's oldest, continuous,
 seagoing military service,  the  Coast
 Guard has the distinction of having taken
 part in every major war in which our
 Nation has been engaged. In World War
 II, the Coast Guard's men, ships and
 planes gave an excellent account of
 International
 political crises can develop      and idealistic experiment.
 and involve the entire world in the time it          When VISTA-the volunteers in-service to
 used to take for an ambassador to a small            America-was launched, more than 3,000 in-
 country to draft his longhand report on a                                                                                           quiries were received from young people on
 local uprising.                                      the first day of business.
 Two-thirds of the world Is poor and seek-          These were volunteers for jobs  without
 ing to break through, by whatever means, to          great financial reward, for hard and often
 something better.                                    thankless service.

 credit on Larry O'Brien and the White
 House, Larry ,O'Brien is known to all of
 us here in Congress as a skilled tactician
 but a most reasonable and understand-
 ing man. He has always been willing to
 listen to the other man's point of view
 while carefully explaining the White
 House point of view to Members.  Larry
 O'Brien always remembers that he is
 dealing with elected Members of Con-
 gress, sent here by the voters,, and not
 appointed government officials.  He has
 .always understood the responsibilities
 that House and Senate members have to
 the electorate. This is one of the reasons
 why he has been so successful on Capitol
 Hill and why he is so genuinely liked and
 respected.
 Mr. Speaker, I ask permission to have
 William  S,  White's  column  entitled
 "O'Brien's Contribution," printed with
 my remarks, at this point in the RECORD:
 JOHNSON PROGRAM-O'BRIEN'S CONTRIBUTION
 (By William S. White)
 There are two incredible realities about
 President Johnson's program in Congress, and
 it is a close question as to which is the more
 improbable.
 One Is the profound and unexampled scope
 of the legislation that has moved so sedately
 and surely through the Senate and House.
 What Congress under Mr. Johnson's spur Is
 doing In all fields of social legislation is in
 depth and total meaning beyond what any
 Congress has ever done for any President in
 any like period-not excluding Franklin D.
 Roosevelt at the top of his power.
 The other unreal reality is that all this is
 being accomplished with so quiet, so casual,
 an air of professional competence that the
 country is hardly aware of the immense alter-
 ations being made in the whole fabric of its
 collective life.
 Five enactments of historic significance
 have already followed one another in orderly
 and  ordained  sequence,  as  steadily  and
 calmly as a trained squad of men filing by in
 quickstep.  Four of these-aid to the Appa-
 lachian region, Federal assistance to educa-
 tion in a fundamental way, medicare, and
 Negro voting rights-had been in one way
 or another sought for decades-for. 2 to 3
 decades in some Instances, for 10 decades in
 the case of civil rights.
 A fifth, the measure not merely to broaden
 Government-aided housing but also to pro-
 vide Government rent subsidies to tenants, is
 so far-reaching as never before to have been
 proposed at all. -
 In any Congress one had known in the past
 any one of these huge bills would have pro-
 voked a struggle to shake the very walls of
 the Capitol.  This time, each one has gone
 forward in about the atmosphere of strife
 and drama a postman might stir in making
 his rounds in the suburbs.
 Perhaps history will have to determine the
 ultimate degree of wisdom or unwisdom. in
 these unprecedented congressional actions.
 Some onlookers, including this onlooker, will
 not wait so long.  They cannot down grave
 anxieties as to whether we ought to have
 gone so far so quickly in some of these many
 directions.  Anyhow, we have gone there.
 Mr. Kennedy quite as well as the next fellow,
 also loved the causes and the country he was
 supposed to represent.  So those causes and
 that country-and President Johnson, too-
 he has served with signal loyalty and high
 competence.  If the record of the first session
 of the first Johnson Congress is extraordi-
 nary-and all can agree on that much, at
 least-extraordinary has been O'Brien's con-
 tribution to it.
 No man has so ably embodied the transi-
 tion from the Kennedy to the Johnson era.
 And no man has done his full duty with less
 cocktail circuit posturing and self-promo-
 tion.  The reason is not dreadfully hard to
 find. O'Brien is a true professional; he is
 concerned with results and not with doctrinal
 hairsplitting and ideological hissing matches.
 And so nobody has had to draw him a little
 map of the trails through that tough terrain
 where .the bureaucratic jungle merges with
 the legislative jungle up on Capitol Hill.
 MILITARY MEN PERFORMING CIVIL-
 IAN TYPE WORK IN THE ARMED
 SERVICES
 (Mr. HENDERSON asked and was
 given permission to address the House for
 1 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr.   HENDERSON,  Mr.   Speaker,
 there are today at least 50,000 active-duty
 military men in our armed services per-
 forming civilian-type work who could
 and should be moved into combat units.
 These are in addition to those under-
 going training or who have been rotated
 from overseas.
 The Subcommittee on Manpower has
 noted in the past few years an increasing
 number of combat-trained military men
 working as carpenters, painters, chauf-
 feurs, typists, stock clerks, statisticians,
 historians, and so forth.  We have also
 been told by Department of Defense of-
 ficials that the military men in these sup-
 port jobs are more.expensive than civil
 service employees.  This is due to the
 heavy turnover and training costs of the
 military men.
 Likewise, in view of the current crisis
 in Vietnam, with the need there for addi-
 tional military manpower, the subcom-
 mittee members join me in urging that
 the administration first bolster our com-
 bat units by taking the tens of thousands
 of seasoned, trained, active-duty military
 men out of civilian-type jobs in prefer-
 ence to untrained military just out of
 civilian life.  This move would not only
 Insure immediately a stronger military
 posture but would also save the taxpay-
 ers millions of dollars.
 The Assistant Secretary of Defense for
 Manpower, Hon. Norman S. Paul, indi-
 cated to the subcommittee on July 13,
 1965, tentative plans to move military
 personnel out of civilian jobs. The sub-
 committee plans to closely watch this
 important manpower program.
 So, how was it all done?  Primarily, of President Johnson this week has re-
 course, it was done by an occupant of the                      quested the Secretary of Defense to re-
 White House whose skill in leading and prod-                 view   the  utilization  of  active-duty

 This. No. 2. man is Lawrence O'Brien, the Today I sent a letter  o Secretary

 Congress, and before that, a member of what our subcommittee in this program and
 ,the eggheads around President Kennedy were urging that he move ahead.

 South Carolina, Hon. MENDEL RIVERS, has
 final authority in this particular area of
 military strength; but may I also add
 that the Subcommittee on Manpower for
 years has been studying the ratio of
 civilian employees to military personnel
 in support work. We have and will con-

 I am today sending a copy of my letter
 to Chairman RIVERS and also a copy to
 the chairman of the Senate Armed Serv-
 ices Committee, the Honorable RICHARD
 RUSSELL.
 Mr. Speaker, colleagues, now is a time
 for both action and cooperation by all.
 GIRLS NATION
 (Mr. GLENN ANDREWS asked and
 was. given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute and to revise and ex-
 tend his remarks.)
 Mr. GLENN ANDREWS.  Mr. Speaker,
 Washington today is host to some of the
 loveliest ladies  in the Nation.  Two
 members from most States are here to-
 day representing the Girls Nation. This
 is a project in citizenship sponsored by
 the American Legion National Auxiliary
 of which my State, Alabama, happens to
 have the president, Mrs. Walter Wilde
 Andrews and the director of the Girls
 Nation also comes from my State, Miss
 Dan Waite.
 I am Indeed glad to have visiting in
 Washington today also a young woman
 from my district, Miss Anthony. We are
 delighted to have them all, and it is with
 great pride that I welcome them to
 Washington.
 NORTH VIETNAM SHIPPING
 (Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker, I
 am deeply concerned about the volume of
 free world shipping that continues to
 supply North Vietnam. On July 22, as
 the RECORD will show, I called to the at-
 tention of my colleagues that during
 1964, 401 ships flying flags of the free
 world nations called at North Vietnam
 ports and that during the first 6 months
 of 1965, 74 additional vessels had carried
 cargoes to supply the enemy.  I further
 pointed out the almost unbelievable fact
 that 24 of the vessels that had called at
 North Vietnam during 1964 have sailed
 into the harbors of this country a total
 of 75 times since January 1964.
 I have just recently learned that in
 addition to these vessels, that have been

 THE "OTEPKA CASE-PART I"
 (Mr. HALL asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute, to revise and extend his remarks,
 and to Include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. HALL.  Mr. Speaker, I have re-
 cently called our colleagues' 'attention to
 the piecemeal release of the other body's
 Subcommittee on  Internal  Security
 concerning the "Otepka Case-Part I";
 and actually feel that this technique may
 be profitable, in that it will keep the
 thorn festering in the side of the State
 Department, if we will but pay attention.
 Many others have joined me, including
 members of the House Committee on
 Foreign Affairs, for its counterpart in
 the other body of the Congress.  The
 delay of the Otto Otepka case in the
 State Department, where it has been
 oftentimes postponed on the flimsiest of
 excuses by the Secretary himself; and
 particularly the appointment to a re-
 sponsible foreign service post of the dis-
 credited William Weiland in the face
 of this injustice, has brought response
 from many  readers  throughout  the
 country.  In the meantime the para-
 doxical situation persists, and freedom
 weeps.
 The second volume of the Senate In-
 ternal Security Subcommittee's hear-
 ings has now been released, and if one

 November  1963  (see   enclosure).   After  I
 wrote this letter, Edith and Otto came to my
 home to thank me, this was the first time
 I met Otto Otepka face to face.  He didn't
 impress me as a mutilator of documents, a
 conspirator, or a man who would exhibit
 conduct unbefitting a State Department offi-
 cial.  I felt my opinion of the hearings and
 Otto was justified.   Here was a man who
 clearly had the best interest of our country
 at heart.

 The 1,280,000 kilowatt mine mouth power-
 plant would be jointly owned by the two
 ,-utilities.  It would consume about 3.5 mil-
 lion tons of coal a year, most of which would
 be mined adjacent to the plant and delivered
 by conveyor belts-with the balance to be
 mined within a few miles of the site.
 Constriction of the plant would commence
 next March with the first 640,000-kilowatt
 unit in operation by May 1969 and the sec-
 ond unit of the same size to be completed
 about 18 months later.
 The plant site is in an area rich in bitumi-
 nous coal. deposits and about 20, miles north-
 west of Johnstown. . it is about 15 miles
 southeast of the keystone power project un-
 der construction near SheloCta and about 12
 miles northwest of the contemplated Cone-
 maugh powerplant near New Florence.  The
 installation of the Penelec-New York State
 Electric & Gas Corp. plant would mean, when
 all three are In operation in the early 1970's,
 that this 30-mile stretch, of central western
 Pennsylvania could produce over 5 million
 kilowatts, (including Penelec's existing. Sew-
 ard station)  one of the greatest concentra-
 tions of electric power production capacity
 in the world.
 New York State Electric & Gas Corp.'s
 share of the output of the station will be de-
 livered .by a 345,000-volt transmission line
 that will.run 170 miles from the site to the
 Elmira-Binghampton, N.Y., area and would
 be the fl;st extra-high voltage line to tie
 western Pennsylvania directly with upstate
 New Yor) . Penelec'e share.. of the station
 output will be taken into its transmission
 network near the site.
 Agreement to proceed with the joint con-
 struction of the plant was announced today
 by Penelec President Louis H..1i.oddis, Jr.,
 and New York State Electric & Gas Corp.
 president Joseph M. Bell, Jr.  The scope
 of ,the. project was cited by the utility execu-
 tives as `Illustrating the continuing com-
 mitment and ability of investor-owned elec-
 tric companies to finance and build the
 efficient large-pcale facilities that will assure
 consumers in the northeast of , dependable
 and low-cost electric,serivice."
 The New York utility serves over a half-
 million customers, principally in the south
 central portion of that State. Penelec serves
 420,000 customers-in about a third of the
 Commonwealth and including virtually the
 entire northern tier and in the central and
 couthwes?t$fn. - Parts of Pennsylvania.   The
 Johnstown, based utility is an operating
 company of General Public, Utilities Corp.
 and its generating operations are integrated
 with its.sister central public utilities com-
 panies; Metropolitan Edison Co, of Pennsyl-
 vania; New Jersey Power & Light Co. and
 Jersey Central Power & Light Co.
 Pennsylvania and upstate New York, Penelec
 and New York State Electric & Gas Corp.
 have maintained transmission connections at
 five points along the States' border for many
 years.  In addition, New York State Electric &
 Gas Corp. has  11 major transmission ties
 with 4 other utilities and Penelec is inter-
 cOs nected with 7 other companies at 13 other
 locations.
 Design details for the plant are still to
 be developed but would be similar In concept
 to the neighboring 9-mouth stations.  Cool-
 ing water for the plant will be continuously
 recycled from huge storage basins outside
 the  plant,  sent  in  to the  station's con-
 densors where it will pick up heat, returned
 outside and into 350-foot tall hyperbolic con-
 crete shell natural draft cooling towers and
 dropped back down to the storage basins.
 Additional supplies of water to make up
 for the amounts being evaporated in the
 cooling process will be withdrawn from Two
 Lick Creek and pumped uphill to the plant
 site about a mile away.  The creek's flow
 will be maintained at an adequate rate all
 year round for this purpose by construction
 of a reservoir further upstream with 13,000
 acre feet of water storage impounded by a
 concrete dam.
 The siting of the plant in the central
 western Pennsylvania soft coal region will
 allow the companies to take advantage of
 the substantial economies associated with
 using readily recoverable, run-of-the-mine
 coal with an average heat rate of 12,000 B.t.u.
 per pound and requiring minimal prepara-
 tion  and  transportation.  Studies  have
 shown about 125.million recoverable tons of
 coal within a_ few miles of the site. The
 officials reported that no contracts have as
 yet been entered upon with coal companies.
 Part of the economic impact of the project
 would lie in the fact that the character of
 the coal in the area, while suitable for this
 plant, is less in demand for other uses and
 much of it might not otherwise ever be
 mined.   It is predicted that operation of
 the plant at full capacity would mean 500
 or more mining jobs and a large number of
 trucking and other associated jobs.  Instal-
 lation of the plant will also mean a large
 number of temporary jobs and substantial
 local purchases of materials, supplies and
 services during the construction period-all
 of which should inject several million dol-
 lars a year of additional purchasing power
 into this region's economy.
 Another feature evaluated in the economic
 analysis of the site is its proximity to Pene-
 lee's network of 230,000 volt and 115,000 volt
 transmission lines leading to maior  local
 connections.                                      The Vallejo Times-Herald in my home

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROBERT L. LEGGETT
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 4, 1965
 Mr. LEGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
 can policy in Vietnam is really relatively
 simple as far as I see it.  We strongly
 support self-determination of govern-
 ment by people, and whereas the issue
 of people popularly supporting Com-
 munist causes has never arisen, I am
 sure that our policy is such that we would
 let any people determine their own fu-
 ture by majority vote whether it be Com-
 munist, Socialist, or democratic.
 The problem comes up wl.en one group
 seeks to impose a communist system by
 force in a protracted battle with outside
 interference.  The United States will
 equalize by force any situation that so
 arises in the world.
 Respecting Red China, undoubtedly
 she should be a member of the U.N. but
 sd also should Nationalist China and
 therein lies the current conflict.
 The President has again urged the
 utilization of the U.N. to terminate the
 hostilities in southeast Asia. The Com-
 munists have steadfastly refused to
 recognize this organization or its func-
 tion in any fashion in the danger area.
 We have offered to talk to anybody in
 the world to bring this matter to a con-
 clusion.  The Communists have refused
 to talk with anybody.  We are now in
 a situation where we are sending sub-
 stantial troops abroad, I hope for the
 purpose of maintaining the status quo
 allowing our technological superiority to
 bring the Communists to the bargaining
 table  without  inflicting  innumerable
 casualities in a large ground war.
 I am pleased to see the American pub-
 lic gradually recognizing that the truth
 and facts in Vietnam are really self-

 there.
 "The truth about Vietnam" is as evident
 to the ordinary citizen as it is to the man in
 the White House.
 It is that the Communists want to swallow
 up South Vietnam and we intend to stop
 them from doing it.
 it is that we face a long and increasingly
 costly struggle, with no certain prospect
 of victory or even some kind of peace that
 is neither victory nor defeat.

 The American resolve is further em-
 phasized and articulated by the follow-

 Woodland Daily Democrat on July 31,
 1965:
 As WE SEE IT:; HANOI DELUSION
 It has been more than a little baffling to
 Americans-and we suspect to citizens of a
 great many other nations-why Ho Chi
 Minh and his associates and advisers in the
 North Vietnam Government have shown not
 even a glimmer of interest in sitting down
 at a conference table to try to end the Viet-
 namese war.
 The United States has tried about every
 diplomatic trick in the book to bring about
 such discussions.
 President Johnson has offered publicly to
 hold unconditional negotiations.  Various
 and sundry mediators, including one of
 British Prime Minister Wilson's ablest far-
 left friends, have tried to reason with the
 Hanoi regime.
 Washington has turned on awesome mili-
 tary power in sustained attacks, and then
 turned it off.  Military establishments and
 facilities all over North Vietnam have been
 bombed, while Hanoi and other major cities
 have been conspicuously left alone.
 But nothing has worked.

 Wednesday, August 4, 1965
 Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama.  Mr.
 Speaker, today's Washington Daily News
 carries an editorial on the subject of leg-
 islative reapportionment and I believe
 it merits the attention of all.
 The editorial follows:
 THE PEOPLE ARE THE LAST WORD
 In our system of government, as spelled
 out by the Constitution and every other
 principle we go by, the people are the final
 word.
 But a substantial number of Members in
 the U.S. Senate, although generally classify-
 ing themselves as "liberals," are opposed to
 this system.
 They demonstrate this opposition by the
 bitter manner in which they seek to defeat
 the  so-called Dirksen amendment  to the
 Constitution.
 Last year, the Supreme Court, in an amaz-
 ing ruling, held that both houses of a State
 legislature had to be apportioned on a strict
 population  basis-the  so-called  one-man,
 one-vote proposition.  This   despite  the
 State-by-State apportionment of the U.S.
 Senate, despite the constitutions of most
 States, despite recent and specific approval
 by the voters in some States of a different
 system.
 Nobody wants to rip out the Supreme
 Court because of this airy decision, although
 the decision had the effect of ripping out
 most State legislatures.

 BRITIAN LOST IN SOCIAL MIST-ENCRUSTED OR-
 GANIZED LABOR TRYING To GET MORE FOR
 LESS
 (By Eric Sevareid)
 LoNDoN.-When I last departed England
 4 years ago, a tired Tory government was in
 power. Now the long-frustrated Labor Party
 has charge and very little has changed, save
 that prices are higher. It is as if the country
 were searching and searching for the magic
 button that would galvanize the people and
 move their potentially first-class industrial
 complex off dead center.
 It is ironic but not at all surprising that
 a Prime Minister ostensibly representing the
 working class spends his weekends making
 speeches insisting that the workers work
 harder.  The faults of management are ob-
 vious enough to any American businessman
 who does business here; but organized labor
 has become ever more encrusted, bureauc-
 ratized, reactionary, and spiritless.  Its en-
 ergies remain concentrated on getting more
 for less.

 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE-OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 4, 1965
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker, to
 all those who advocate we back down in
 Vietnam,; who believe that the price of
 standing up to Communist aggression in
 South Vietnam is too high, I commend
 for their deep contemplation the words
 which appeared in the Williamston,
 Mich., Enterprise on July 28, written by
 a young man who is actually on the firing
 line in this war-torn country.  Ron Ea-
 DEAR SIR: I realize how busy, and I also
 realize  that  this  will  probably  never  see
 your paper, but, I don't know how William-
 ston is reacting about our actions in Viet-
 nam, but I have heard about Michigan State
 University  and  the  sit-ins   and  teach-ins
 which have been going on, and it makes
 me disgusted as well as the rest of the men
 aboard Midway.
 I feel that these people just don't realize
 what they are doing, or else they are doing
 it just to be "part of the gang."  I know,
 for when I was attending Williamston High
 School, from 1959-63, I also did things that
 I really didn't have reason to do, just to
 be part of the gang.  What these people
 don't realize is that they are just lowering
 the men's morale, who are over here fighting
 for a cause that they believe in, and if it's
 one thing that we need it is morale.
 I for one, and I know that many are with
 me, feel that this mission is of great impor-
 tance to us and Vietnam.  If we were to let
 the Communists have Vietnam, then they
 would feel that they were obligated to keep
 on going and eventually take everything that
 they  could  get  their hands  on,  and  we
 wouldn't do a thing about it, because they
 have seen us pull out, and where would the
 United States be placed in the minds of
 the people?  The people of Vietnam right
 now have confidence, which they never had
 before, and they are realizing that we are
 there  to help them,  and they  are  doing
 better than ever.
 At present Midway has been on the coast
 of Vietnam since April 9, 1965.  We have
 had at-sea periods of better than 39 days
 each time.  We have hardly had any liberty,
 and our morales are low.  We have given
 air support to the Vietnamese, plus the vari-
 ous missions concerning bombing of bridges
 that are vital to the Vietcong for transpor-
 tation, Communist concentrations, and many
 other things that I cannot mention.
 So far, we have been successful, but if we
 do not have the people behind us, we feel
 that we are just doing something that is no
 avail, btxt if the people would get behind
 us and give us some kind of support and
 stop all of this "hogwash" of sit-ins, teach-
 ins and so forth, that we could do a better
 job and be proud of the fact that we are
 the men that are keeping the freedom and
 liberty for our loved ones and families in the
 great United States of America.
 I know that this is not a very well put
 together letter,_or,__opinion, but at least I
 have got it off my mind.  Maybe you can get

 Fortas and the U.S. Navy
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. H. R. GROSS
 OF IOWA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 4, 1965
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, among the
 many things that President - Lyndon
 Johnson and Abe.Fortas, the President's
 nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court
 bench, have in common is an uncom-
 monly short period of military service in
 World War II.
 Lyndon Johnson jumped in and out
 of uniform in about 7 months.  Fortas
 apparently made the change in consider-
 ably less time.
 The "Inside Washington" newspaper
 column, written by the veteran cor-
 respondents, Robert S. Allen and Paul
 Scott, sheds some interesting light on
 the subject.  It is reproduced herewith:
 INSIDE WASHINGTON
 (By Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott)
 WASHINGTON, August 4,1965.-Members of
 the Senate Judiciary Committee, who will
 pass on Abe Fortas' appointment to the Su-
 preme Court, are evincing much curiosity
 about a singular omission in his lengthy,
 self-written biography.
 While meticulously listing every public
 and private job he has ever held and nu-
 merous other details, there is not a single
 word about his World War II Navy service.
 Similarly, President Johnson, who left Con-
 gress to enter the Navy and proudly wears
 the Silver Star Decoration on his lapel, also
 was mute about the military service of his
 choice for a seat on the highest tribunal of
 the land.  While glowingly acclaiming Fortas
 as a "scholar, profound thinker, lawyer of
 superior ability, humane and deeply com-
 passionate * * * champion of our liberties,"
 the President said nothing about his being
 a veteran.
 In each instance, this remarkable silence
 was no oversight.  There was very good rea-
 son for it.
 Fortas' World War II naval service lasted
 less than 2 months-29 days of which he
 spent as a perambulatory patient in the hoe-
 pital of a New York training camp under-
 going tests and examinations.
 Their verdict was that he had an "ar-
 rested case of ocular tuberculosis"-and was
 forthwith discharged.
 Fortas immediately resumed his office as
 Under Secretary of the Interior.
 In welcoming him back, the late Secretary
 Harold Ickes proclaimed that a recurrence
 of Fortas' eye ailment "might have been at-
 tended  by  the  most  serious  permanent
 results."   In the 22 years since then, there
 is no known record of such a recurrence.
 In those two decades, Fortas has become
 a multimillionaire, the key partner of one
 of the largest and most influential law firms
 in Washington-and at 55, still does not wear
 glasses.
 TRANSIENT APPRENTICE SEAMAN
 A storm of caustic congressional and press
 criticism was largely behind Fortas' enlist-
 ment in the Navy on October 29, 1943.
 But the 33-year-old married but childless
 New Dealer was barely sworn in when he
 was out again.  On that same dav, he was

 and with the understanding that it would
 be quickly completed so  (he)  could enter
 the Navy."
 A world-known newspaper reported this
 remarkable episode as follows
 "Abe Fortas, former Under Secretary of the
 Interior was in the Navy today=for a few
 hours.
 "But almost as soon as he reported for
 duty as an apprentice seaman, he popped
 right out again * * * as the civilian head
 of an alphabetical Government mission to
 Arabia * * * to study facilities for the pro-
 duction and refinement of oil.  Upon his
 return, for which no date has been set, he
 will report to the board of directors of the
 Petroleum Reserves Corporation, consisting
 of the Secretaries of State, War, Navy, and
 Interior, and the head of the Foreign Eco-
 nomic Administration.
 "Meanwhile, he will swab no decks.
 "Announcement of this new assignment
 came just after the Navy recruiting station,
 asked where Fortas would be sent, had said
 that this was a troop movement and could
 not be disclosed.
 "Government service has been profitable to
 the Fortas family.  His wife, formerly an at-
 torney in the review division of the National
 Labor Relations Board, is now an attorney
 for the Justice Department at $5,600 a year.
 Her husband's induction, presumably, would
 cause her little hardship."
 Due  to  transportation  difficulties,  the
 Fortas mission never left the United States.
 On November 6, 1943, he again became an
 apprentice seaman and was sent to Camp
 Sampson, N.Y., for training.  There he was
 hospitalized for a series of examinations and
 tests that led to his discharge December 13
 for "an arrested case of ocular tuberculosis."
 Upon returning to Washington, Fortas
 joined a veterans' organization-from which
 he has long since dropped out.
 NO CHANGE
 Mrs. Fortas (nee Carolyn Agger) has no
 intention of giving up her highly lucrative
 law practice.
 A senior member of her husband's law firm,
 Mrs. Fortas, a leading tax specialist, heads the
 firm's tax division of some 50 attorneys and
 accountants. They occupy an office building
 of their own opposite her husband's office.
 Says Mrs. Fortas, "I have been in the law
 all my life, and I don't expect to give it up
 now.  Why should I?"
 This will make her the first wife in Su-
 preme Court history actively practicing law
 while her husband is on the august bench-
 deciding tax cases, among others.
 Mrs. Fortas is a cigar smoker; short thin
 ones in public, large rat ones in private.
 Small and slim, she enjoys cooking and loves
 calorie-rich dishes.  But she watches her
 weight carefully, and diets frequently to keep
 it down.
 She and her husband are poodle lovers; now
 Through  his  long  and  close  ties  with
 President Johnson, Fortas has influenced a
 number  of  key  appointments,                foremost
 among them Attorney General Katsenbach
 and Internal Revenue Commissioner Sheldon
 Cohen, former member of the Fortas law
 firm.  Before Fortas was named to the Su-
 preme                                                                  Court,  White  House  insiders             were
 saying he had been consulted by the Presi-
 dent on former Supreme Court Justice Gold-
 berg's selection as U.N. Ambassador.  If this
 is true, he had a hand in opening the way
 for his being named to Goldberg's seat on
 the bench.   .
 What Are They Afraid Of?
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CARLETON J. KING
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 4,1965
 Mr. KING of New York.  Mr. Speaker,
 one of the issues which disturbs the peo-
 ple of this country is the question of
 State reapportionment.
 We who have tried to have a Constitu-
 tional amendment submitted to the peo-
 ple have been blocked by the attitude of
 the so-called liberals of the Senate.
 They, for some reason, are opposed to
 letting the people express themselves at
 the polls. What are they afraid of?
 In an editorial in the Washington
 Daily News, our attention is called quite
 clearly to the attitude of these Senators.
 We should let the people have the last
 word.  To this end, yesterday I joined
 with the gentleman from Ohio, the rank-
 ing member of the Committee on the
 Judiciary, Mr. MCCULLOCH, in introduc-
 ing a revised proposal which I hope the
 Congress can and will pass and "let the
 people have the last word."
 The editorial follows:
 (From the Washington Daily News, Aug. 4,
 1965]
 THE PEOPLE ARE THE LAST WORD
 In our system of government, as spelled
 out by the Constitution and every other
 principle we go by, the people are the final
 word.
 But a substantial number of Members in
 the U.S. Senate, although generally classify-
 ing themselves as liberals, are opposed to this
 system.
 They demonstrate this opposition by the
 bitter manner in which they seek to defeat
 the  so-called  Dirksen  amendment  to  the
 Constitution.
 Last year, the Supreme Court, in an amaz-

 But the Senators opposing  the Dirksen
 amendment don't want the people to decide
 for themselves..   The plain implication  is
 that the  Senators know  better than     the
 people of the States what is a proper sys-
 tem for the States.   Since many of these
 Senators have been among the most zealous
 champions of civil rights, their inconsistency
 of the Dirksen issue is beyond comprehension.
 If the people in the States are not capable
 of deciding such basic questions as the man-
 ner in which they wish their legislatures to
 be organized, then it is valid to question the
 capacity of the people to decide other ques-
 tions-who, for instance, should represent
 them in the U.S. Senate.
 Maybe, if these anti-Dirksen Senators are
 right, we should go back to the old system
 of having U.S. Senators chosen by State legis-
 latures.   (We wouldn't  favor  that  for  a
 minute, but it is just as logical as the op-
 position to the Dirksen amendment.)
 There are many arguments favoring the
 Dirksen amendment.  But, regardless of all
 other arguments, the issue now before the
 Senate  is  fundamental-the  right of  the
 people of the States to decide for themselves.
 Despite all the windy debate, this is the only
 issue.

 dent Johnson.                                                                                                                                                                 spoke  yesterday-his  words
 carefully chosen to convey the full message
 of unflinching decision where national duty
 is concerned, measuring to the challenge of
 Communist aggression in and from south-
 east Asia.
 In a word, the choice is between holding
 there the gate against enemies of freedom--
 bent on conquest-and surrender.  "We will
 not surrender," said Mr. Johnson. "We will
 not retreat."
 It was a responsible assertion of policy
 enunciated clearly enough in previous public
 discussions, but-strengthened in this reitera-
 tion by the gathering weight of muscle readi-
 ness to enforce it.  It was Washington's re-
 sponsibility, with advisory consultations, to
 formulate that policy-as it is the responsi-
 bility of Armed Forces in the field to carry it
 out;  the latter needing only the military
 wherewithal and the "go" signal clearly given.
 In that connection, the President stated
 it succinctly:
 "I have asked the commanding general-
 Gen.                                                                                                                                    William  C.  Westmoreland-what  he
 needs to meet a mounting aggression.  He
 has told me.   And we will meet his needs."
 The Banner has said that coherent step is
 essential  to  victory;  heeding  the expert
 evaluation of need by the man vested with
 that military responsibility, and backing him
 with the resources it will take to discharge it.
