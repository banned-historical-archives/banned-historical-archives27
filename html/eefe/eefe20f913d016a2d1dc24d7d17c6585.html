 With this issue the Studies bids an offi-
 cial farewell to Sherman Kent, who some-
 what quixotically founded the journal in
 1955 and has been its prime sustainer for a
 dozen years.  The infusions of his vigor
 and polymath good judgment have been so
 much the wellspring of its life that it has
 reason to tremble a little at this severance.
 Yet he has borne himself the wise father,
 encouraging  spontaneity  and  initiative,
 nudging here and checking there but foster-
 ing the independent child; and he has thus
 brought it to a stature that can stand the
 shock.  It can take comfort, too, that he
 will not be altogether out of its reach for fatherly advice.  This is the
 end of an era, but the era's works go on.
 Succeeding Chairman Kent on the Studies editorial board, as on his
 more history-making Board of National Estimates, is Abbot Li;. Smith,
 long his deputy on the latter.
 My colleagues on the Board of Editors have asked that I mark my
 retirement from the Board with a backward glance at the beginnings
 of the Studies in Intelligence and a drawing of some sort of balance
 sheet.  What follows is, I trust, a minimally autobiographical, but
 nevertheless wholly personal appraisal of the journal's accomplishments
 and disappointments.
 First-about its establishment:
 When the National War College convened in January i4)4; after
 its Christmas recess, Bernard Brodie gave the morning lecture.  His

 topic was the Grand Strategy.  To the surprise of everyone, and the
 disquiet of some, his presentation was not about strategy but about
 how few Americans had interested themselves in the study of it.
 Citing the case of economics, he noted that a hundred and fifty years
 of study had produced from scratch a large library of highly enlighten-
 ing literature.  What had our military produced in the way of a
 literature regarding strategy, the heart of their profession? He
 answered this question by referring to Alfred Mahan, whose contribu-
 tion to this literature was unique in both senses of the word: out-
 standing and lonesome.  The speech came to a climax when Mr.
 Brodie identified a couple of strategic decisions of World War II
 which he held in low esteem and indicated that they might not have
 been made if Americans had devoted more time to thinking and
 writing about strategy.  The moral was pointed and purposefully so:
 strategy is your business, why don't you systematize your thinking
 about it and perpetuate your reflections in a professional literature?
 Sunday Before Christmas
 One of the reasons I so vividly remember Mr. Brodie's remarks was
 that I realized at the time that everything he was saying about strategy
 could be said with equal force about intelligence.  I had just com-
 pleted almost five years in the business and was poised to begin work
 on my book Strategic Intelligence.  In the next few months all that I
 had suspected regarding the absence of a literature of intelligence I
 was pretty well able to prove. Calling upon the library resources of
 the National War College and its able reference librarians, I believe
 that I read practically every printed document which our military had
 issued on the subject of intelligence and a number of typed student
 articles from the services' war colleges.  There was nothing from the
 pen of a civilian intelligence practitioner.  The collection was no
 better than I had anticipated, and going through it was a pretty shat-
 tering experience for an intelligence buff.                               Clearly the profession ought
 to put the talent of a lot of its devotees to the creation of literature
 of the trade.
 I did nothing much about the matter except for occasional broodings
 until one Sunday in December 1953.  I had the morning duty in
 Mr. Dulles's office and after reading the cables I still had time on

 my hands.  It was then that I wrote the memorandum that follows.
 The cover sheet of transmittal looked like this:
 (1) My general interest in the "Life."
 (2) A sense of disquiet at the realization that Intelligence is a non-
 cumulative discipline.
 (3) A sense of outrage at the infantile imprecision of the language of
 intelligence-I give you the NSCID's for a starter.
 (4) A desire to give Uncle Matt a Christmas gift.
 At the bottom of the copy I have is written, in Matt Baird's hand:
 To OTR Staff and Division Chiefs
 re parag. 4-I like to share my Christmas cheer; comments will be acceptable
 in return!
 SUBJECT: How a major flaw in the intelligence business (its lack of a
 serious systematic literature) might be corrected.
 1. Intelligence work in the US has become an important professional dis-
 cipline.
 2. It has developed theory, doctrine, a vocabulary, and a multitude of
 techniques.
 3. Unlike most other important professional disciplines, it has not developed
 a literature worthy of the name.
 4. Without a literature intelligence has little or no formal institutional memory.
 What institutional memory it does possess exists in (a) fragments of
 thousands of memoranda primarily devoted to discrete intelligence opera-
 tions, not to the theory and practice of the calling, and in (b) the living
 memories of people engaged in intelligence work.
 What kind of a way is this to run a railroad?  Where would the
 sciences and social sciences be, if their students had not systematically
 contributed to their literatures?
 A literature is the best guarantee that the findings of a discipline
 will be cumulative.
 A disaster to our unlettered intelligence service such as occurred with
 the budgetary cut-backs of 1946-7, or as might occur with an A-bomb
 on Washington, could put US intelligence back to the stone age where
 it so long dwelled.

 5. How do you produce a literature?
 Some answers.
 a. You pay for it.  That is, you offer a livelihood to the man who wants
 to write a book or an article during the time he requires to do the job.
 b. You make sure that the man who wants to write a book or article has
 something to say and a reasonable command of the art of verbal
 expression.
 c. You subsidize his publications. That is, you print at your own expense
 what your critics and editors think will advance the discipline.
 d. You circulate his publications and encourage comment thereon.  You
 may wish to publish the best written comment.
 Some answers.
 a. I would establish on a modest scale an "Institute for Advanced Study of
 Intelligence."
 h. I would have a Board of Admissions who would both (].) pass on the
 suitability of applicants and (2) actually invite likely candidates who
 did not apply.
 c. I would have no one eligible for admission who had not had a sub-
 stantial and varied experience in intelligence work and who was not
 capable of systematic thoughtful research, analysis, and writing.
 Further I would accept no one who did not have a well-thought-out
 project.
 d. The project would have to be in the field of intelligence work, overt
 and clandestine; not in the substantive findings of intelligence.  Ap-
 propriate sample projects might be:
 (1) Strengths and weaknesses of intelligence dissemination tech-
 niques.
 (2) An examination of the "third agency" rule.
 (3) The theory of indicators.
 (4) The intelligence service of country X.
 Inadmissible projects would be:
 (1) The Red Army
 (2) The Trieste situation
 (3) The Outlook in Liberia, etc.
 e. I would have no faculty as such.  I would have a director who would
 arrange for occasional meetings with outsiders and who would see to
 it that the students spent a few hours per week together in seminars
 at which the students would present papers and discuss them.
 I. The greatest part of the student's time would be his own to pursue his
 project through any means whatever with a view to publishing some-
 thing at the end of his fellowship.

 g. I would establish a journal-probably a quarterly-which would be
 devoted to intelligence theory and doctrine, and the techniques of the
 discipline. I would have an editor who fully understood the limits of
 his mandate.  The journal could be Top Secret; its component articles
 could be of any classification or unclassified. The editor would. provide
 for the separate publication of "reprints" for separate circulation where
 appropriate.
 h. Along with the journal I would establish an "Intelligence Series" for
 longer works.
 7. Some dimensions.
 a. As a starter I would have no more than 10 or 12 students.
 b. They would receive their regular in-grade pay if they came from the
 government; they would receive appropriate compensation if drawn
 in from the outside.  All would, of course, be fully cleared.
 c. They would be expected to be "in residence" at least 50 percent of the
 time; that is, at work in study or seminar rooms on the school premises.
 d. Although my major interest is in positive intelligence, I would always
 aim to have a few security intelligence students around.
 e. The duration of the fellowships would normally be one year.  If I
 found a Mahan of intelligence I would keep him as long as he would
 stay.
 There are hundreds of details beyond this rough outline.  If the idea were
 accepted, they could be easily worked out.
 What my school must never be is an intelligence equivalent of the higher
 service schools. If you feel the need of a model, study Institute for Advanced
 Study at Princeton-the Einstein school.
 True to his penciled promise, Mr. Baird did discuss the memorandum
 with his principal lieutenants in the Office of Training.  I can only
 surmise, for I was not present, that the founding of an Einstein school
 for research in intelligence method, doctrine, and history was put
 on a back burner and that my suggestion for the establishment of a
 journal was fetched up front over moderate heat. There followed,
 for example, a weekend conference at a country retreat sometime dur-
 ing 1954 and a good bit of general conversation about a journal-
 who should finance it, edit it, supervise it, and so on.
 Some time later I was asked to set forth orally my thoughts about
 the journal before an Agency gathering with the understanding that

 CONFIDENTIAL                                  Valediction
 the speech would be recorded and transcribed.  This procedure was
 Mr. Baird's artful way of inducing me to produce, in writing, the first
 article of the new journal.  When it appeared in print in September
 1955 it bore the title "The Need for an Intelligence Literature: Articles
 by Sherman Kent and the Editors."  My contribution was no more
 than an Englished version of the oral presentation, which in turn was
 an elaboration of the thoughts touched upon in the first five paragraphs
 of my Christmas memo to Matt Baird.
 Before the appearance of the first number of the quarterly proper,
 there were two other unperiodic issues with a couple of articles each,
 the first including Abbot Smith's disquisition on the matter of capa-
 bilities in intelligence publications.  This gave rise in the second,
 oddly enough, to a comment by the British intelligence officer then
 representing the British Joint Intelligence Committee in Washington,
 Alan Crick.  I say oddly, because soon after the journal began to
 appear in its present form, the Editors ruled that there should be no
 dissemination to friendly foreign services.  The main articles in the
 last issue in slender format dealt with economic intelligence.
 At the initiative of one of Matt Baird's able officers, James Lowe, the
 journal became a quarterly with the Fall issue of 1957, and starting
 in 1958 under the editorship of Philip Edwards it has come out four
 times a year ever since.
 Now for the balance sheet: what is there about the journal that we
 can regard with pride and happiness and what with regret?
 Let me begin with the good ones: our second five years of quarterly
 existence has produced a larger number of contributions and a
 larger number of good ones than did our first five.  In recent times
 there have often been many more pages of highly commendable
 manuscript than the editors wished to commit to a single number.
 It is not exactly that we are being lost in a blizzard of contributions,
 but compared to the bleak years of the fifties, we feel that we are
 doing very well indeed.
 As to the quality, we should have to do no more than to
 call the reader's attention to the list of winners of the annual $500

 prize 2 and advise him to reflect again on what whacking good articles
 they were and what a very substantial contribution to the lore of our
 profession they made.  That the Board has on two occasions been
 unable to distinguish between the two or even three best essays and has
 accordingly split the award is explicit testimony, at least, of the Boards
 awareness that it has just passed through a bumper crop year.
 That the Studies has in fact contributed to a richer understanding
 of the bones and viscera of the intelligence calling is beyond argu-
 ment.                             We have run dozens of articles on intelligence history, the
 range of which can be sampled in those of Arthur Darling on the
 early years of CIA, the half dozen on the early struggle between the
 Russian revolutionaries and the Tsar's Okhrana, and William Harris's
 two on the March 1948 Berlin crisis, in which intelligence played a
 pivotal role.  None of these articles required a high security classifi-
 cation and all of them could have been disseminated widely as long
 memos.  But who would have sponsored them, reproduced and cir-
 culated them if there had been no Studies to serve as a vehicle?
 The contribution of the journal to an appreciation of some of the
 aspects of intelligence theory and doctrine has been highly significant.
 I cite as outstanding examples the succession of articles by W. E. Seidel,
 George Ecklund, Clyde C. Wooten, and Julie D. Kerlin clarifying the
 proper role of economic intelligence in defense planning, the many
 articles that discuss problems of estimative intelligence,3 and the view

 Perhaps we have been at our best on intelligence method. Where
 else could a wide audience of professionals gain insight into such tech-
 niques as those illustrated in Thaxter L. Goodell's piece on cratology,
 Paul R. Storm's on Soviet gold, and C. N. Geschwind's comments on
 interrogation?  Increasingly, as intelligence itself turns more and more
 to science, we have featured new scientific methods, from David Brand-
 wein's "Telemetry Analysis" three years ago4 to the new infrared re-
 connaissance techniques recently explained by R. E. Lawrence and
 Harry Woo.
 The point is that as one looks back through a cumulative index
 (which one should do5) he cannot escape the belief that: the intelli-
 gence profession is indeed more professional and more durable
 now that it has the beginnings, at least, of this tangible institutional
 memory.
 Another cheering aspect is inherent in the widening spectrum of
 contributors. There is not a major component of CIA which has not
 by now produced at least one author and an interesting article.
 Furthermore we have had a good number of contributions from intelli-
 gence officers not associated with the Agency in any way. One of our
 prize winners, Colonel Hartness, four years back, was such a man.
 Lastly, we have had a heart-warming reaction from our consumers.
 The members of the Board are pretty well convinced that our fan
 mail represents a genuine appreciation on the part of scores, perhaps
 even hundreds, of readers scattered all over Washington, indeed all
 over the world. As old intelligence officers, we are naturally suspicious
 of a warm consumer reaction, for well we know how rare it is that
 a consumer receiving a piece of substantive intelligence will ever
 give anything except a "thank you." To be sure, some of the thanks
 are a good bit less fervent than others.  But what we have found
 particularly pleasant have been the requests from men running small
 intelligence units in large and small domestic and overseas commands
 asking permission to incorporate this or that article into one of their
 publications destined to circulate among their own people.
 Probably our nicest fan letter was one which Admiral B. E. Moore,
 then of the Cinclant headquarters, wrote to Admiral D. L. McDonald,
 the CNO, saying how he had come across our publication and sug-

 gesting that the CNO ask that it be sent to a good number of flag
 officers serving with major components of the Fleet. As a result we put
 some 40 or 50 additional addressees on our distribution list.
 A principal cause behind these good things has been our editor,
 Philip Edwards, whom we know to be the best in the business.
 When you read these words you must realize that he has been over-
 come by the Board's exercise of force majeure, and that the paragraph
 is appearing in print despite his efforts to kill it.  Mr. Edwards
 combines his great skill as a critic with a rare talent for writing, a
 world of patience, and a great ability to help authors help them-
 selves.  The journal's successes owe more to him than any other
 single person.
 Minuses
 And now for my regrets. The first has to do with the classification
 of the quarterly. The Secret stamp on the outside and what it means
 is obvious to all.  The most melancholy implication is that it must
 be given what we call Class A storage, something none of us has
 in his home. Accordingly, one has had to read the journal on business
 premises and perhaps in business hours. This means that it has been
 competing for attention with urgent professional matters.
 When I bespoke my hope for lots of unclassified articles in my first
 essay, I was clearly whistling Dixie.  What the Board swiftly came
 to realize was that unclassified articles by people outside the govern-
 ment or the intelligence community were by definition going to be
 a great rarity-principally because we were not going to advertise
 that we had a vehicle to publish such writings.  Even if we had
 successfully solicited, we would probably have had to reject most
 offerings on the grounds of quality or lack of sophistication.  There
 are after all very few outsiders who have been able to keep abreast
 of the extraordinary developments of the profession from the vantage
 point of private life. And not many have chosen to do purely historical
 pieces or notes of reminiscence.
 On the other hand, the very fact that an insider wrote such and
 such and that the Board thought it important enough to publish was
 oftentimes the prima facie reason to put some sort of classification
 stamp to it.  In actual fact, the Board has upon many occasions
 felt impelled to question sensitive topics discussed by an author and
 even to do a bit of sanitizing to get the contribution by as Secret.

 All this is the long way of saying that, regrettable as is the Secret
 classification, it is the very best that can be done.  We n re convinced
 that there is no way by which our publication can be made into some-
 thing which our readers can take home to read in the evening and
 which, at the same time, will have a content worthy of their attention.
 One reader wrote us a communication suggesting a common-sense
 method by which copies of the Studies could be kept out of the safe
 for an hour or so after close of business for people who wanted to
 stay after work to read them.  We thought he had something and
 passed the idea along, but nothing came of it.
 A second and last regret.  No matter that, as noted above, the
 quantity of contributions has increased and the quality improved, there
 are by no means enough people in our vast community writing articles
 and submitting them. The Board of Editors, at each of its weekend
 meetings, spends several hours on Saturday night discussing subjects
 which would make interesting articles and trying to figure out who
 would he the best author to undertake them.  Between meetings of
 the Board, members put in a good amount of time dunning their
 colleagues and acquaintances for an article of this or that :specification.
 I should imagine that we receive in finished form one article for about
 every ten we ask for. Some of the articles which have finally appeared
 have required almost as much suasion or browbeating on the part
 of a Board member as they did effort on the part of the composer.
 On the other hand, the number of high-quality walk-ins has been low.
 There are several reasons why this is so.  To start with, the ideal
 author or authors for such and such a piece are as a rule overextended
 with the primary tasks of their job descriptions and cannot take on an
 additional duty.  Nor do their supervisors by and large feel able to
 lighten their professional burdens for the two or three weeks which
 they would have to have to do the article in question.
 Not infrequently the right author could be given time, but just does
 not want to take it.  Maybe he has a quite understandable desire-to
 this writer, at least-to avoid the pain of literary composition at all
 costs.  Maybe also the man or woman whose job keeps driving them
 down into the present and forcing them to look into the murk of
 the future can be pardoned for an indifferent concern about: that which
 is over and done with. And many of the articles which we feel should
 be written are essentially historical in nature.  Some of these have
 an added built-in repulsiveness.  For example, who is naturally in-

 clined to go back over the history of an intelligence blooper? The
 fact that such a backward glance could be of immense professional
 importance does little to alleviate its essential unattractiveness.
 Though the so-called missile gap debate owed but little to the
 shortcomings of intelligence, getting an article going on the subject has
 so far been impossible. One reason-not the ruling one-has been
 a reluctance on the part of knowledgeable analysts to return to the
 agonies of our early estimating on the Soviet ICBM force and relive
 those days of groping around in the uncertainties of Soviet ability to
 build the missiles and the magnitude of the force which the Soviets
 would probably wish to deploy.
 No such Freudian explanation is applicable to our experience in
 getting the article which we published in the autumn of 1966 on
 "The Detection of Joe I," the first Soviet nuclear test. This piece, which
 recounted one of our country's truly great intelligence successes,
 required more effort in terms of false starts and carry-over from
 year to year than any other we have printed.  Here perhaps the
 issues of security and delicacy were important inhibitors.  Telling
 the story orally in a safe place to an inside group possessed of
 every clearance in the book would have been one thing, telling it in
 writing at the Secret level for publication to the community at large
 quite another. The stupid little mechanical difficulties of the latter
 course could and probably did very rapidly build up into a mountainous
 barrier.
 Whatever the difficulties and however overcome, the Studies in
 Intelligence venture has been eminently worth while.  The Board's
 celebration of its tenth anniversary a year ago presaged, I trust, not
 so much a ceremony of self-congratulation for a decade of past per-
 formance as an earnest of still other decades of good and useful work
 to come.

 INTERACTION IN WEAPONS R&D
 David S. Brandwein i
 Intelligence may be thought of as having two missions in relation
 to military planning and weapon system development.  The primary
 mission is to provide information on the weapon systems of potential
 enemies so that counterweapons may be developed.    That is, if we
 can gather valid and timely intelligence for projections of the capa-
 bilities and vulnerabilities of the opponent's military systems, we can
 develop weapons capable of penetrating his defense and blunting his
 offense. A secondary mission is to furnish information on the :foreign
 development of weapon system components which parallel our own
 designs.  Here, the objective is to take advantage of their R&D to
 produce better weapons for ourselves, thus gaining time and reduc-
 ing our own development costs.
 In what follows I will examine the way these intelligence missions
 are accomplished, primarily in the field of strategic attack and defense
 systems, and how the results affect U.S. research and development.
 I will try to point out the difficulties in generating satisfactory intelli-
 gence hypotheses on the basis of thin data, validating them by inde-
 pendent checkout on the part of the several analytic groups involved,
 and then feeding them back to the R&D community, difficulties which
 make the process less than ideally effective.  A few illustrative case
 histories will show just how it has or has not worked well and suggest
 where it might be tinkered with.
 Time and Pride
 The problem is time. Too much time is usually consumed in gener-.
 ating and validating intelligence on weapon R&D to feed it back into
 U.S. planning effectively. True, the weapon-counterweapon process is
 a sequential one, so that limited time lags in the feedback loop can be

 tolerated.  Intelligence output, however, is usually much too late to
 cause the initiation of counterweapon developmental programs or to
 affect them directly at their initiation.  While it may be frustrating
 to proponents of so-called interaction analyses, a look at the decision
 dates for some of our existing systems proves that almost all strategic
 counterweapons reflect recent advances in the state of the art rather
 than reaction to a specific opposing system.  They are designed ba-
 sically against hypothetical threats founded upon broad assumptions
 as to the capabilities of the adversary. Intelligence findings are more
 likely to be used to refine developmental programs already well under
 way, or sometimes as grounds for eliminating alternative lines of devel-
 opment previously undertaken to "cover all bets."
 With respect to the secondary intelligence objective, our parallel
 weapons development program has benefited only to a trivial extent
 from intelligence because of the truly crippling effect of the time lag
 coupled with a fundamental human barrier-"Thanks, but we are
 doing it better."  Generally, two systems being developed. in parallel
 by two countries, given about equal capabilities in both, are likely to
 mature at the same rate.  By the time Country A has discovered
 that some feature of Country B's system is superior to the correspond-
 ing one in its own, it has paid out its development money and concludes
 that it cannot make changes.  Convincing researchers that someone
 else has solved a problem in a better way is not easy; there is fre-
 quently the necessity to overcome an inborn chauvinism, or at least
 pride of invention, which blunts the feedback mechanism.
 Collection Difficulties
 The first problem is to collect the intelligence.  Ideally, we would
 like to know as soon as research and development starts on a new
 weapon system.  The fact is, however, that information is inadequate
 on Soviet military R&D programs and almost totally nonexistent on
 Communist Chinese programs.  While general information showing
 large increases in Soviet technical capability is available, as well as
 evidence of an expanding scope of military R&D, specifics are too
 fragmentary to allow a precise definition of the future threat.  Basic
 research can be followed in some detail through analysis of scientific
 papers published in the technical journals, but the possible final uses
 of the research in terms of weapon systems are many and nonspecific,
 and only trends can be detected. The end result is a lack of sufficient
 accurate intelligence on R&D projects in their early stages.

 Weapons R&D                                   SECRET
 In the face of these uncertainties, we usually credit the Soviets with
 the ability to solve many scientific or technological problems without
 specific evidence of this ability.  This may often be reasonable; the
 Soviets have the advantage of getting much information on Western
 advances, and their progress may well parallel ours in many instances.
 Nevertheless, there is a tendency to estimate greater Soviet progress
 as the West becomes more certain of success in the solution of corre-
 sponding scientific problems.  Our assessments of the status of specific
 R&D programs thus may be uncertain in the near term and increas-
 ingly tenuous as estimates are projected into the future.  The loss of
 lead time for U.S. planning of counterweapon development and an
 inability to present unanticipated alternatives to the U.S. R&D commu-
 nity is a serious consequence of these perpetual intelligence problems.
 Once the adversary has made a decision to capitalize on the results
 of basic research and build a specific new weapon system, he goes
 underground with the entire process of preliminary design, labora-
 tory test, and prototype construction up to flight (or other equivalent
 final) test, which is therefore secure from most forms of intelligence
 collection.  Indeed, a study of the technical literature to see when
 reporting on some particular area of basic research suddenly stops
 is advocated as a way of learning that a military development pro-
 gram has been started in that area. Proving an exclusion theorem
 is always a difficult matter, however, and even its proof would hardly
 be a clear signal as to exactly what was going on.
 In the development of some key weapons the final flight test phase
 is open to intelligence collection, but this is likely to take place three
 to five years after the start of preliminary design.  This is the lag for
 long-range ballistic missiles and space systems.      ABM systems, on
 the other hand, could well be flight-tested over a period of years
 without our knowledge.
 Analysis, Consensus, Feedback
 Let us assume that in spite of these difficulties we have finally
 collected a body of raw data on a new weapon system.  The next
 step, the analysis of the data, is likely to consume a large amount of
 time because it is a difficult process.  This is particularly true when
 the opponent has developed a system fundamentally different from
 our home-grown variety.  There is generally a lack of background
 data for the intelligence findings and a reluctance on the part of

 analysts and consultants to accept the idea that someo:ae else was
 able to solve the problem differently from our solution.  A short-
 circuit sometimes removes this obstacle when actual hardware is
 collected, but unfortunately this happens only very rarely, and when it
 does it seldom involves a major weapons system.
 After the analytic efforts seem to have generated satisfactory hypo-
 thetical conclusions, we still need to validate these by having inde-
 pendent researchers check them out.  The intelligence community
 needs to reach a consensus on their validity. Different analysts working
 separately on the same data are quite likely to come up with differing
 answers, particularly when the data base is thin to begin with.  While
 we would all probably agree on the desirability of having more than
 a single individual or a single group take a crack at the problem, we
 would also hope that they communicate with each other at frequent
 intervals.  I am encouraged by what seems to be a better rapport
 nowadays among the various analytical groups in the community and
 a greater speed in coming to an agreed conclusion than heretofore.
 Even so, the validation process still takes a significant length of time,
 in some instances as long or longer than the analysis p:rocess itself.
 Now let us engage the problem of feedback.  There are many
 channels through which this takes place.  The CIA and DIA put out
 reports and estimates to consumers on a regular basis, many of which
 contain details of weapon system developments.  These agencies also
 routinely brief officials in Defense, NASA, the Bureau of the Budget,
 and the White House, along with many other decision-making ele-
 ments of the government.  There are a number of key members of
 the scientific establishment, both industrial and academic, who par-
 ticipate in a variety of government-sponsored panels and committees
 and receive intelligence briefings in their fields of cognizance.  These
 people, however, are at the policy and top management: level; it is
 likely that little direct intelligence-derived guidance filters through
 them to the laboratories.
 Security restrictions inhibit wide dissemination of intelligence down
 to the scientists and engineers at the design level, but perhaps little is
 lost, as the briefings at the policy level are seldom detailed.  They are
 usually condensed to a point that a consumer would have difficulty
 detecting, say, a significant breakthrough in the development of a
 subsystem.  For instance, we are prone to tell policy-level audiences
 that a missile has a particular accuracy but are less likely to tell them

 why.  Finally, even if we could get around the security restrictions
 in our contacts with industry, we still need to be circumspect. In
 our capitalistic society we lay ourselves open to severe criticism if
 we provide information to industry in a way that gives one company
 a competitive advantage over others.
 Case History: ICBM Guidance
 Having reached the end of the process thus still beset with diffi-
 culties, I would now like to summarize briefly some case histories
 which illustrate them. The first one is of parallel development work
 in the United States and the USSR on the same problem, the guidance
 system for an ICBM.
 Solving this problem is one of the most difficult ingredients of an
 ICBM development program. It is clear now that we and the Soviets
 started in parallel, in about 1955, and arrived at strikingly different
 solutions.  The U.S. systems use a simple rocket engine operating at
 a fixed thrust but couple with this a very complex guidance system
 containing an airborne digital computer.  During powered flight the
 guidance system continuously computes the proper burnout position
 for the rocket so that the warhead will impact acceptably close to
 the target. The Soviets, on the other hand, fly their missiles on a pre-
 calculated trajectory with a somewhat more elaborate variable-thrust
 engine but a very much simpler guidance system having virtually
 no on-board computation capability.
 Both systems work fine; but we would probably now admit that
 the advantages inherent in the Soviet system, simplicity and quick
 achievement of satisfactory reliability, would have been very appealing
 to us had we considered such a system during the design phase. The
 fact is that we did not begin to collect useful flight test data on the
 Soviet system until 1959, that we did not really perform enough
 analysis work to understand it until 1963, and that the results of this
 analysis did not begin to be disseminated outside the intelligence
 community until 1965. By this time, of course, the U.S. ICBM guidance
 design had long since been completed. It may be said in all candor
 that this particular intelligence program had no effect at all on parallel
 systems at home.
 An interesting sidelight illustrative of our problems is that analysis
 of one aspect of the Soviet data showed that whereas all U.S. missiles
 use rate gyros or angular accelerometers to keep the control system

 stable, the Soviets devised a much simpler system that dispenses with
 these fragile and expensive instruments. The analyst whc made this
 determination was successful in getting a Soviet-style system in-
 corporated into a proposal to NASA for a new launch vehicle-only
 to have the feature rejected by that agency with the comment that
 although the scheme looked quite feasible, there hadn't been enough
 test experience to justify its adoption.  The NASA people were not
 aware of the fact that the Soviets had been testing it for many years
 because they had never received feedback in the detail required and
 at the right level in their organization.
 An interesting case history in the weapon-counterweapon field is
 the intelligence analysis of a large Soviet radar and its effect on the
 U.S. program for developing penetration aids.  When thought first
 turned in the United States to the problem of penetrating Soviet
 radar defenses with ICBM warheads, there immediately arose the
 question of the operating characteristics of these radars.  About the
 only contribution intelligence could make were some excellent U-2
 photographs taken in 1960 of some very large radars in the Sary
 Shagan area which seemed to be logical candidates for the role of
 spotting ballistic missiles as ABM targets.
 Unfortunately, deriving a radar's characteristics from a photograph
 of it is rather difficult. Various analytical groups looking at the same
 photos came up with different answers.  The consensus seemed to be
 that the largest radar-nicknamed Hen House-was the keystone of
 the defensive system, and that it would operate in a UHF frequency
 band, at about 1,000 MHz; after all, our developers were working
 on radars in the 1,000-2,000 MHz region in our equivalent programs
 at the time. This was the word that went out to U.S. agencies engaged
 in devising penetration schemes.
 Then in 1962 the Russians tested some nuclear warheads at high
 altitudes in the Sary Shagan region. Nature was kind, and we received
 radar signals reflected from the ionized cloud.  These included a new
 train of signals in the much lower VHF band, which it soon developed
 must have come from a very high-power radar in the Sary Shagan
 area.
 For a long time, however, there was a singular lack of interest in the
 peculiarity of these signals.  It may be that too many analysts had

 already decided that the Hen House frequency would be much :higher.
 It seems they had convinced themselves that there was no merit in
 a long-range radar operating at VHF because such a radar would
 be blacked out by a nuclear cloud. Nevertheless, analysis efforts did
 go forward, and two things became increasingly clear: first, the VHF
 signal characteristics were such as to prove that they could have
 emanated only from a radar with the physical dimensions and orienta-
 tion of Hen House; and second, that our work on nuclear blackout
 effects was based on tests in the tropics, whereas the Soviets were
 likely to deploy radars such as these in the Arctic, where the black-
 out problem was not nearly so severe.2
 A final impediment to the fast functioning of the system was the
 fact that the validation step took an unconscionably long time. Al-
 though by late 1964 most of the various analytical groups had arrived
 at the correct solution, there was one that was still unconvinced, and its
 opposition prevented the firm feedback of this information to the
 R&D community.  As a result, another two years went by before
 the message got back to the laboratories in an effective way.
 We are now finally on the tracks. A serious review of our offensive
 capabilities against VHF radars is now under way.  A VHF` radar
 has been built at White Sands to allow us to see what the Soviet
 radars will see.  Our own Nike ABM program is at the same time
 looking at ways of using VHF radars for our defensive systems.
 However, I would not begin to estimate the millions of dollars which
 could have been saved by a more speedy functioning of the intelligence
 process.
 To recapitulate, I have presented so far a rather pessimistic picture
 of our capability to influence weapons research and development, and
 I have given two examples illustrating how the long times needed to
 collect, analyze, validate, and feed back information serve to make
 our efforts ineffective. Ideally, this would now be the proper place
 to unveil a blueprint for the future, in which clear solutions to these
 problems are presented.
 I have no such blueprint.  I know of no way to collect intelligence
 on weapon systems at the early R&D phase except by clandestine deep

 penetrations of the adversary's laboratories and design bureaus. Those
 responsible for clandestine operations know this as well as we on
 the technical side do, and presumably they are doing the best they
 can. Similarly, I see no easy way of speeding up the analysis process.
 Massive infusions of people or computing machines are not likely to
 expedite the process. Key analytic breakthroughs will generally come
 from the application of brainpower by a few gifted and dedicated
 individuals working at their own pace.
 The last two steps in the process, validation and feedback, seem
 to me to be the places where we should focus our attention.  The
 effectiveness of these steps depends wholly on how we structure the
 setup so as to allow people to communicate and interact with one
 another.  Perhaps it is time to take a fresh look at the mechanisms
 by which intelligence information is provided to researchers, particu-
 larly in the final phases. This, it seems to me, is an area where no new
 inventions are required, no multimillion dollar expenditures are called
 for, and yet where there is promise both of improving our defensive
 and offensive capabilities and of saving millions of dollars.

 FORETESTING A SOVIET ABM SYSTEM
 Edward Tauss i
 The summary presentation of this particular case history in induc-
 tive analysis will show how a slim amount of data may give a basis
 for determining the general characteristics and net capabilities of a
 new Soviet system before the Soviets themselves have a firm prototype
 of it.  Such an accomplishment would not be noteworthy when U.S.
 R&D has already broken trail along the line of development in ques-
 tion, but when it is the USSR that is doing the pioneering it is much
 more controversial and difficult to foresee the outcome. The advan-
 tages of doing so, of course, are that it gives the U.S. developers a
 critical lead time in which to take countermeasures and a basis for
 objective planning-no small matters in the race toward Armageddon.
 Apparent Soviet Anomalies
 At first the theory of ICBM interception called for destruction of
 the incoming missile as far away as possible, while it was still out-
 side the atmosphere.  Then the development of chaff and decoys in
 increasing numbers and complexity led to a need for waiting until
 the atmospheric drag on reentry provided a way to distinguish the
 real warhead from the false images.  Endo-atmospheric interception
 thus became firm U.S. doctrine, absorbing an enormous investment
 in the development of terminal defense radars, exotic computers,
 new high-performance missiles, and solutions for the complex prob-
 lems of reentry physics.  For it was natural to assume that the
 Soviet defense system would be based on similar endo-atmospheric
 reasoning, in fact would be a mirror image of our own.  In con-
 sequence, U.S. ICBMs were designed to reenter and penetrate the

 atmosphere as rapidly as possible, leaving a minimum of time after
 target discrimination for the enemy's anti-ballistic-missiles to reach
 them.
 In the fall of 1961 and 1962, however, the Soviets performed exo-
 atmospheric nuclear experiments at their ABM research center near
 Sary Shagan.  There were never any atmospheric tests there.  U.S.
 intelligence had been aware of two new research radars, code-named
 lien House and Hen Roost, at Sary Shagan, but the first signals from
 either were intercepted only when some Hen House pulses were re-
 flected from the ionized cloud generated by a nuclear explosion during
 these tests.
 The intercepted Hen House signals had peculiar characteristics.
 Most notably, their carrier frequencies were in the VHF range, a very
 low frequency relative to the L and S bands normally used for U.S.
 long-range radars.  The Soviets had other VHF radars, for example
 the newly deployed Tall Kings for early antiaircraft warning; but
 the Hen House signals turned out to have much more :information
 content than is needed for mere early warning.  For ABM use the
 low frequency should have serious disadvantages, not only in track-
 ing ICBMs but even in their early detection.  Theoretically, uncer-
 tainties in propagation, both in the lower troposphere near the earth
 and in penetrating the ionosphere to the target vehicle, might create
 such errors in measurement as were thought to render VHF quite un-
 suitable for U.S. tracking applications.  Furthermore, it might be
 presumed that any nuclear explosion in the radar path would blind
 a VHF system.
 The longer wavelength does have its own virtues, however.  It is
 harder to jam or deceive with decoys, and it makes for a cheaper
 system.  It would maximize the radar cross-section of target U.S.
 [CBMs.   Such a system would be a natural extrapolation from previ-
 ous Soviet radar technology.  The logical interpretation of the Sary
 Shagan tests was that the Soviets were in fact exploring the feasibility
 of a new exo-atmospheric intercept system, using VHF radar, in de-
 fiance of our endo-atmospheric doctrine.
 Postulated Soviet System
 In 1963 the U.S. Army's missile electronic warfare organization at
 White Sands, under the stimulation of inductive argument from a
 CIA liaison officer (this reporter), became convinced that Soviet re-
 searchers had found, or were finding, ways to get around the diffi-

 culties both of exo-atmospheric target discrimination and of VHF
 radar in ABM systems.  Late that year, at about the same time that
 a "probable Hen House" signal from Sary Shagan was first intercepted
 via moon bounce,2 an Army contract was signed with Data Dy-
 namics, Inc., to study the potential of a broadly-postulated exo-
 atmospheric-kill ABM system based on such a radar.  The contractor
 was given intelligence support from both White Sands and CIA.
 The Hen House proved to be a large planar array of emitting ele-
 ments scanning electronically and having extremely high transmitted
 power.  Not only its peak power but also its average power was
 extraordinarily high, with a capability for a very high data rate.  Such
 a radar may be called range-dominant, in that it measures range more
 accurately than azimuth or altitude.  It had to be assumed that the
 Soviets were not trying to develop it for continuous tracking of
 ICBMs from the point of detection on the horizon to the point of
 interdiction; at high look angles in a wartime nuclear environment
 a VHF blackout would be virtually certain.  The Hen House would
 have to get its position-prediction data quickly at long range, near
 the horizon, and that would be the reason for its high power and
 data rate.
 At maximum range, however, it was calculated that no single
 range-dominant radar could determine target positions with suffi-
 cient accuracy.  Measurements of altitude, in particular, circum-
 scribed by the limited vertical dimension of the planar array, could
 not be made fine enough. To make the postulated system credible
 one had to assume a Soviet solution for this inadequacy, and one solu-
 tion might be the operation of several radars from different locations
 against the same targets to pinpoint them by the intersection of their
 fixes, a sort of continuous triangulation.  This would require reliable
 instantaneous communication among the several locations, along with
 computers to correlate in real time the multiple reception of target-
 reflected signals; and the Soviets had in fact installed microwave fa-
 cilities at Sary Shagan as though possibly in fulfillment of this need.
 A modificaton of the multiple-radar system so conceived would
 avoid the obviously inordinate expense of a large number of high-
 performance instruments like Hen House: several distant receivers
 could be grouped with each Hen House transmitter, all interlocked
 by real-time communications.  (For experimental purposes the Soviets

 could use the deployed Tall Kings as receiving sites in order to check
 out the feasibility of this idea.)  Such a multistatic radar system
 would have distinct advantages against the enemy's electronic counter-
 measures because of the difficulty of targeting the wide:.y dispersed
 receivers.  This model of an ABM radar system requires a reasonably
 high level of sophistication in processing data for long-range predic-
 tion, but one not inconsonant with known Soviet capabilities.  The
 important thing was that the range-dominant system model could be
 simulated and legitimately exercised to investigate its potentials and
 general vulnerabilities, even if the Soviets would not in the final
 analysis construct it to operate in quite this manner.
 From these basic postulates the contractor, who had earlier done
 work for the Air Force on the prediction of future positions for orbital
 vehicles, developed the technical details and worked out i:he complex
 equations for the multistatic system.  The mathematical simulations
 showed that such a system could have an accuracy in average target
 location within one nautical mile.  Maximum effective range from
 the transmitter could be increased, say from 600 n.m. to more than
 1,000 n.m., by forward location of the receivers.  Though not in-
 vulnerable, the VHF radar was in many ways not so vulnerable as
 conventional systems.  The enemy would have difficulty in horizon-
 to-horizon electronic jamming of a dispersed-receiver system, and
 requirements for high jammer power in the VHF frequency region
 would exact weight and size penalties.  VHF chaff dipoles, to be
 effective, would have to be more than 40 inches in length and rela-
 tively heavy.  The radar might not even register small objects, greatly
 easing the problem of target discrimination.
 Blackout from nuclear explosions in the radar path could be to
 some degree avoided by locating at least the receivers well to the
 side of likely ICBM targets.  Enemy interference with the radar by
 a nuclear detonation at a conjugate point on the earths magnetic
 lines of force would not be possible across the Arctic horizon.  The
 prognosticated degradation of the beam from low-angle anomalies
 turned out not to be prohibitive at long range.  The powerful VHF
 beam may even have the advantage of a "knife edge" effect, curving
 over the horizon for useful increases in unambiguous :range.     The
 USSR seemed to be about ten years ahead of the United States in
 developing such a VHF-oriented system, and it was reasonable to as-

 sume that their optimization of it through experimental development
 might be even better than any model we could conceptually imagine.
 A partial answer to the problem of discriminating between war-
 heads and decoys before reentry could be to design the ABM warhead
 to be effective, exo-atmospherically, against whole swarms of incom-
 ing targets, say by making its yield large enough to kill ICBMs at
 great distances.  Was it the Soviet premise that the problem of decoys
 is not a serious one if the ABM warhead has a large enough lethal
 radius? The intelligence-based postulate of a Soviet system which
 encompassed this possibility appeared to have been vindicated on
 7 November 1964 by the revelation of the large Soviet Galosh missile,
 which appeared capable of carrying a megaton-range warhead to
 fire at exo-atmospheric altitudes.
 Prospects
 Even if the Soviets had withheld the parading of the Galosh, it
 had been possible as early as the spring of 1964 to have, in the con-
 tracted study, a basis for ignoring the implications of their display,
 on 7 November 1963, of the aerodynamically-designed Griffon missile
 which did not fit the requirement for a long-range, high-altitude ABM.
 By that spring it had been possible to formulate computer sub-
 routines by which the contractor could continuously update simulated
 long-range Soviet ABM systems on the basis of the latest intelligence
 data.  In mid-1964 operational and planned U.S. attack models were
 "flown" (by the same contractor under different sponsorship) against
 the defensive model in mathematical simulation for purposes of net
 evaluation.
 Such very early postulation and analysis on the basis of scant data,
 something of a rarity in the intelligence community, may be viewed
 as a likely necessity now, at least in the electronic warfare field, to
 provide objective grounds for developmental decisions.  In this case,
 recognition of the feasibility of an ABM system using VHF radars
 established a need for electronic countermeasures in the VHF region
 and was followed by formal military requirements for new chaff and
 decoys, for high-powered jamming tubes with new long-term fuel and
 power supplies, and for horizon-to-horizon antenna pattern develop-
 ments.  It led the White Sands missile electronic warfare organiza-
 tion to build the first VHF measurements radar in the United States.

 The U.S.-USSR R&D contest, hopefully, will get beyond the ABM-
 ICBM confrontation.  The posture of all military, naval, air, and
 space forces will feel the impact of new strategic modes in which
 electronic warfare and net evaluations are controlling factors.  The
 moral of this case history is that countermeasures and counter-
 countermeasures must keep pace in real time with the development
 of the opponent's threat.  In order to achieve this, the intelligence
 community must commit itself, as indicated in the accompanying
 diagram, to designating the broad parameters of a threat at the earliest
 possible time. Research and Development must then use these broad
 parameters to initiate immediately the development of generally neces-
 sary counter-components and so at least move in the direction of
 readiness for the future threat.  It is not necessary to foresee just how
 the enemy will optimize his developmental designs, to flesh out our
 model in ultimate detail, or to obtain community agreement on all
 the refinements in order to institute these timely measures.

 Some lessons from case
 histories of misjudgment
 in the NIEs.
 HOW THREE ESTIMATES WENT WRONG
 Willard C. Matthias
 The procedure by which National Intelligence Estimates are pre-
 pared is designed to ensure that those responsible for policy decisions
 receive an agreed intelligence judgment (or a carefully delineated dis-
 agreement) based upon the best information and most thorough re-
 view possible.  But the procedures only provide the framework within
 which people function, and the estimates are only as good as they are
 made by those who operate the machinery.
 The Estimative Process
 In this machinery the Board of National Estimates plays the most
 important managerial and intellectual role.  The draft of the estimate
 is prepared by the Estimates Staff under the Board's direction; it
 is discussed with representatives of the USIB agencies and CIA com-
 ponents under the chairmanship of a Board member; and it is pre-
 sented by this Board member to the USIB.  The Staff member who
 prepares the initial draft also plays an important part: he is more
 familiar with the information than most Board members are, and if
 he is a skillful writer and convincing defender of his views he puts
 an ineradicable stamp on the estimate.  The Board chairman-par-
 ticularly if he has had a long familiarity with the subject and is
 temperamentally inclined to play a leading role-will likewise put
 a strong stamp on it.
 Nevertheless, it is the Board as a corporate entity which bears re-
 sponsibility to the DCI for the form and substance of the estimates.
 It is his Board, an instrument to formulate his views and to take account
 for him of the information and judgments applicable to the subject
 in question.  While he personally may rely upon some Board mem-
 bers more than others, in his official capacity he must have a Board
 sufficiently competent and balanced in composition and experience
 that he can be confident that all significant aspects of the subject
 have been weighed judiciously.

 SECRET                                      Three Estimates
 One cannot generalize about the method or technique Board mem-
 bers use in arriving at estimative judgments.  Each estimative situa-
 tion is unique, and the estimator must lean upon a variety of sup-
 ports: the amount and persuasiveness of the evidence; the methods of
 analysis used by the contributors; the judgment of others in whom he
 has special confidence, whether because of their study, experience, or
 sharpness of mind; his own background in the subject; and, for want
 of a better word, his hunches.
 By dictionary definition a hunch is a feeling or suspicion not based
 upon evidence but upon premonition.  1. do not believe in premoni-
 tions, but I admit of the hunch in some sense.  It must be compounded
 of something-a sense of the logic of a situation, a ring of authenticity
 in certain evidence, an uneasiness because some factor in a situation
 is unexplained or prima facie unexplainable, a sense of the general
 weight of evidence though no individual piece of it is sufficiently per-
 suasive, a feeling that some leader or group is likely to act in a certain
 way because of emotional or ideological predilections, however ir-
 rational or illogical the course.  Such factors enter in most Frequently
 when there is no solid factual base for conclusions or when the evi-
 dence is contradictory.  A most notable case of correct hunch oc-
 curred in 1962, when Director John McCone kept worrying the pos-
 sibility that the Soviets might put strategic missiles into Cuba despite
 the absence of reliable evidence to this effect and despite his Board's
 judgment that they would not do anything so foolish.
 In some ways the estimative job is easier than it was ten or fifteen
 years ago.  We have, for example, much more and better evidence
 on many aspects of Soviet military capabilities than we did then;
 collection methods have improved and analytical skills developed.
 But there are still many problems which strain the estimator's
 capacity. Some which cause the severest trouble are those predicting
 likely courses of events (a) in unstable areas or situations of tension,
 (b) in situations where the strengths of competing forces appear
 evenly balanced or are difficult to assess, and (c) where the evidence
 is contradictory, often through deliberate deception.  In each of
 these types of problems the Board of National Estimates has made
 misjudgments in which this estimator has participated.  I would
 like to describe as best I can recall how three estimates over which
 I presided came to render-if not explicitly, at least implicitly-
 judgments that were wrong.

 Three Estimates                                      SECRET
 Arab-Israeli Tensions
 Estimates of future developments in category a, in situations of
 instability or tension, are both the most challenging and the most
 discouraging kind. The first reaction is that one is being asked to do
 the impossible, yet this kind of task can be the most rewarding if
 done successfully (and although I speak here of a failure, it often
 is done successfully). Actually, it is impossible to predict the course
 of events; but one can describe how the parties involved apparently
 think about a situation, how they have so far acted toward it, and
 how they might act toward hypothetical changes.  The case I have
 in mind is that of an estimate entitled "The Arab-Israeli Dispute:
 Current Phase," published 13 April 1967.
 This estimate was undertaken in the context of an increase in tensions
 in the Palestine dispute and in the wake of an Israeli raid on Samu
 in Jordan in late 1966 which shook the monarchy in Amman. These
 developments raised the question of whether the modus vivendi that
 had prevailed between Israel and its Arab neighbors since 1957 was
 coming to an end. Most of what the estimate said was right:
 a. Rivalries and disputes among the Arabs reduce their chances of doing
 anything significant about their quarrel with Israel; these rivalries also create
 some danger of precipitating crises from which large-scale Arab-Israeli hos-
 tilities could develop.
 b. The Israelis seem likely to continue existing policies, including occasional
 retaliatory action; they would resort to force on a large scale only if they
 felt their security seriously endangered.
 c. [The Israelis] could best any one of their neighbors and probably all of
 them collectively.  Arab cooperation being what it is, Israel probably would
 not be obliged to take them on all at once.
 d. The Soviet leaders almost certainly view the Arab-Israeli dispute as
 promoting their interests.  ... But the Soviets do not want an outbreak of
 large-scale conflict in the area, since this would carry serious risk of a US-
 Soviet confrontation and thus threaten the positions which the Soviets have
 already won in the area.
 But the estimate had one final conclusion which, though it was
 technically correct, conveyed a sense of reassurance and was, in light
 of the events of May and June 1967, misleading.
 Although periods of increased tension in the Arab-Israeli dispute will occur
 from time to time, both sides appear to appreciate that large-scale :military
 action involves considerable risk and no assurance of leading to a solution.
 In any event, the chances are good that the threat of great power intervention
 will prevent an attempt by either side to resolve the problem by military force.

 SECRET                                      Three Estimates
 I say that this last conclusion was technically correct because the
 Six Day War was not an attempt to "resolve" the Arab-Israeli problem
 by military force.  It fits under the rubric of the conclusion (see a
 above) that rivalries among the Arabs created the danger of "pre-
 cipitating crises from which large-scale Arab-Israeli hostilities could
 develop" and that (in d above) "the Soviet leaders almost certainly
 view the Arab-Israeli dispute as promoting their interests." A review
 of the available information shows that the Soviets had a role in
 precipitating the crisis by passing intelligence information about Israeli
 plans for a punitive expedition against Syria to the Syrians and
 Egyptians.  Nasser, who had been accused in the past by his Arab
 rivals of hiding behind the skirts of the UN, this time sought to avoid
 the charge. His mobilization and the events which followed then
 led the Israeli leaders to conclude that their security was "seriously
 endangered" (b above).  Quite clearly, both the Soviets and the
 Egyptians made some miscalculations about the consequences of their
 actions.
 One can thus exculpate oneself by this kind of textual exegesis.
 But there was in the estimate a serious lacuna: we did not sufficiently
 treat the possibilities arising out of terrorist activities, border raids,
 troop movements, propaganda, political warfare, and the psychological
 effects of these in Israel and the Arab world.  Had we understood
 these better, we should have ended the estimate by noting the danger
 that they could lead to an explosion rather than asserting the unlikeli-
 hood of a deliberate resort to force.
 Why did we make this error?  I think we were under two mis-
 apprehensions.  The first was that we overestimated the Soviets'
 good sense, something we have done before (e.g., when The question
 was whether they would deploy missiles to Cuba, in 1962).  It is,
 1 think, a safe judgment that if the Soviets had thought in mid-May
 what they knew on 5 June, they would have kept that provocative
 intelligence information to themselves.  The moral is that how the
 Soviets may think about a particular area and what they may do
 tactically may not be entirely consistent.  We as estimators must
 recognize more frequently (as we often do in observing the tactical
 moves of governments regarding which we have more complete
 knowledge) that specific actions taken by the agents of a government
 do not always flow from the general policy objectives or posture of
 the leadership.

 Three Estimates
 The other misapprehension, I believe, was a failure to keep up
 with dynamic aspects of Near East politics.  We did not realize how
 much more confident in themselves both the Israelis and Egyptians had
 become.  We did not therefore realize how much lower was the
 threshold of Nasser's readiness to expose himself to danger, and how
 much lower was the threshold of Israel's readiness to fight against
 creeping threats to its existence.  I cannot say whether this was
 a failure in intelligence reporting or in analysis; I suspect it was
 a bit of both.  U.S. personnel abroad are often too much absorbed
 in the day-to-day business of their operations to detect a growing
 change of mood; analysts in Washington are too often cynically prone
 to think their foreign charges are the same feckless (or scheming)
 fellows they always were and that nothing much changes. I, for one,
 am prepared to be a bit more cynical myself about area specialists.
 Prospects in Vietnam
 The estimate illustrating misjudgment in category b, when the
 strengths of competing forces appear to be evenly balanced or are
 difficult to assess, is one which had a long and tortuous 'history.
 Initiated in October 1962, it was finally cleared by the USIB only in
 April 1963; it was entitled "Prospects in South Vietnam." At that
 time Diem was still president of South Vietnam and Madame Nhu
 was riding high.  The U.S. commitment was still in the form of
 advisers and logistical support. The estimate was to assess how things
 were going, what problems there were, what the prospects were.  I
 will not examine here all the conclusions of the paper, but only its
 general statements about how the war was going and what the pros-
 pects were for South Vietnam in the kind of struggle that was going
 on then.  I quote from some of the conclusions of the draft finally
 approved by the USIB:
 a. We believe Communist progress has been blunted and that the situation
 is improving.  Strengthened South Vietnamese capabilities and effectiveness,
 and particularly US involvement, are causing the Viet Cong increased diffi-
 culty, although there are as yet no persuasive indications that the Communists
 have been grievously hurt.
 b. Assuming no great increase in external support to the Viet Cong, changes
 and improvements which have occurred during the past year now indicate that
 the Viet Cong can be contained militarily.  . . . However, we do not believe
 that it is possible at this time to project the future of the war with any
 confidence. Decisive campaigns have yet to be fought and no quick and easy
 end to the war is in sight.  .. .

 c. Developments during the last year or two also show some promise of
 resolving the political weaknesses, particularly that of insecurity in the country-
 side, upon which the insurgency has fed. However, the government's capacity
 to translate military success into lasting political stability is questionable.
 The estimate thus rang no tocsin.  To put it in simpler language:
 things are not going to hell; we don't know how it will all come out,
 but the South Vietnamese are not doing so badly; Diem is improving,
 he might win the military struggle, though even if he does, don't
 think the political troubles of South Vietnam will be over.  Half a
 year later Diem was ousted, and the political and military situation
 degenerated to critical proportions by the end of 1964. What made
 the estimate so wrong?
 In this case the draft originally prepared by the Estimates Staff
 was essentially correct, but it was fatally weakened during, the process
 of review and coordination. This was a long and painful process for
 me as chairman, since I had helped the Staff prepare this draft.  Let
 me quote some of the original conclusions, c below being the final one:
 a. There is no satisfactory objective means of determining hz)w the war is
 going. The increased US involvement has apparently enabled the South Viet-
 namese regime to check Communist progress and perhaps even to improve the
 situation in some areas; however, it is impossible to say whether the tide is
 running one way or the other .. .
 b. On the South Vietnamese side, new strategic concepts, such as the
 fortified hamlet, and shifts in military and security organization, training, and
 tactics have strengthened the counter-guerrilla effort.  However, very great
 weaknesses remain and will be difficult to surmount.     Among these are lack
 of aggressive and firm leadership at all levels of command, poor morale among
 the troops, lack of trust between peasant and soldier, poor tactical use of
 available forces, a very inadequate intelligence system, and obvious Com-
 munist penetration of the South Vietnamese military organization.
 c. The struggle in South Vietnam at best will be protracted and costly.
 The Communists are determined to win control, and the South Vietnamese
 alone lack the present capacity to prevent their own eventual destruction.
 Containment of the Communists and reestablishment of a modicum of security
 in the countryside might be possible with great US effort iri the present
 political context of South Vietnam, but substantial progress toward Vietnamese
 self-dependence cannot occur unless there are radical changes in the methods
 and personnel of the South Vietnamese Government. Even should these take
 place without mishap, this would only be a beginning; the Communists retain
 capabilities and support which will require years of constructive effort to
 dissipate.
 Some of the process of dilution began in the Board itself.  The
 Board did not change the main thrust of the paper, or alter essentially

 the wording of the conclusions cited in a and b above.  But it did
 eliminate some of the prescient words both from the text and from
 the final conclusions cited in c. The final conclusion now read simply:
 With US help, the South Vietnamese regime stands a good chance of at
 least containing the Communists militarily.  However, the modus operandi
 of the Diem government, and particularly its measures to prevent the rise
 of contenders for political power, have reduced the government's effectiveness,
 both politically and militarily.  We believe that unless radical changes are
 made in these methods of government, there is little hope that the US in-
 volvement can be substantially curtailed or that there will be a material and
 lasting reduction in the Communist threat.
 The serious weakness of this change was that it shifted the emphasis
 from the inherent difficulty and long-term character of the problem
 (to which Diem contributed) to an indictment of the Diem. regime.
 This led us into trouble at the coordination meeting with departmental
 representatives.
 Some of the military representatives at the coordination meeting had
 served in South Vietnam and had been appalled at the South Vietnam-
 ese military performance. The emphasis in the paper on political weak-
 nesses as a major cause of the military failures quite naturally appealed
 to their professional instincts as well as confirmed their own observa-
 tions. The indictment of the Diem regime, however, no doubt because
 it called into question the existing U.S. policy of working with Diem,
 caused the State Department representative to reserve his position
 on this aspect of the paper. He also thought the estimate underesti-
 mated the prospects for gains through an improved military effort,
 although we had gone so far as to say, "With US help, South 'Vietnam
 stands a good chance of at least containing the Communists militarily."
 Thus the DCI and the USIB members were presented with a paper
 which, although the Estimates Board had eliminated reference to the
 gloomy long-term prospects, was still a fairly dolorous document.
 But it was encumbered with a departmental reservation, and this
 obliged the USIB to look at it carefully.  The DCI, then John
 McCone, was particularly uneasy about it, since it seemed to con-
 tradict the more optimistic judgments reached by those in policy
 circles who had been sent to Vietnam to make on-the-spot appraisals
 and recommendations.  He therefore decided to postpone USIB con-
 sideration and asked the Board of National Estimates to consult with
 some of those who had been on such missions.  The Board proceeded

 to meet with two high-ranking military officers and two civilians
 in key policy-making positions.
 None of these four consultations was particularly helpful.  The
 witnesses seemed reluctant to make a frontal assault on the judg-
 ments of the paper but equally reluctant to endorse it.  They showed
 a general tendency to take issue with a particular sentence purport-
 ing to state a fact, rather than an estimative judgment. This or that
 was "too pessimistic," but there was no clear line of argument why.
 All four held forth some degree of optimism, largely based upon the
 belief that things were better than they had been.  This indeed may
 have been true, but it was not established how badly things had
 been going before or how this degree of improvement stood up to
 the task, namely to deal with a determined and resourceful op-
 ponent who was immeasurably helped by the profound underlying
 political weaknesses of South Vietnam.  None of the consultants was
 attempting to mislead, but the simple fact was that each of them in
 some way and to some degree was committed to the existing U.S.
 policy, and none of them was intellectually free at that point or in
 those circumstances to stand back and look at the situation in its
 broadest aspects.
 The drafters then returned to their desks and prepared a revised
 draft.  The Staff members, although increasingly weary of the con-
 troversy, were nevertheless much inclined to stick to their guns.  I,
 however, had become inclined to shade the estimate in a more op-
 timistic direction.  I began to think that perhaps we had. been too
 gloomy; and at the same time I had to get an estimate through to
 meet the DCI's new deadline.  If we stuck to the original draft, the
 DCI and other CIA components might not go along with it; even if
 they did, this draft might now evoke still greater departmental dis-
 sent than it had the first time (since high-ranking personnel had now
 become engaged) ; in short, if we were so rigid that we invited debate
 and amendment at the USIB, we might find ourselves with a paper
 more offensive to our judgment than one which moved slightly to-
 ward a less pessimistic view.  What we now wrote, in spite of some
 staff objection, embodied approximately the conclusion first cited
 above.  The estimate rode easily through the USIB with the DCI's
 full concurrence.
 Even so, this estimate was not calculated to give anyone a sense
 of comfort.  Indeed, very recently a senior official closely associated
 with Vietnamese affairs, who had most likely seen only the finished

 product, remarked that it was too bad policy-makers had not paid
 more attention to it.  Nevertheless, it did not sound the alarm which
 it should have and would have if the first draft conclusions had been
 kept intact.  A year or so after the date of the estimate, Mr. McCone
 openly expressed regret for his own part in weakening what had been
 "right the first time."
 The lesson provided by this experience is to shun the advice of
 those who in one way or another are committed to or responsible for
 a particular line of policy.  They are no doubt well informed, but it
 is also theirs to be hopeful. Above all, their responsibility is to their
 policy-making chiefs, and they can hardly be expected to recite before
 an intelligence working group information or beliefs which implicitly
 or explicitly might suggest that established policy is based upon un-
 sound premises.  Study of the premises of national policy is the
 business of intelligence officers, and it is as unfair to ask the executors
 of policy to testify on the soundness of those premises as it is unwise
 to accord their views uncritical acceptance.
 The Goa Invasion
 The estimate that illustrates the difficulty of forecasting in cate-
 gory c-when the evidence is contradictory, perhaps because of delib-
 erate deception-was not very important in terms of its policy impact;
 its conclusion was so equivocal that it provided the warning needed.
 It was, however, wrong, and I who chaired it was among those who
 thought it wrong at the time.  It was a crash estimate, requested on
 the morning of December 12, 1961 and approved by the USIB on
 the afternoon of the following day, concerning the likelihood of an
 Indian attack upon Goa.  During the preceding few weeks Indian
 troops had been concentrating in the Goa area, public opinion-
 especially on the left-was clamoring for action, and a strong mo-
 mentum in favor of invasion had developed.  Yet the evidence was
 conflicting, and it was possible that these activities were designed
 purely to apply pressure and to bring about the incorporation of
 Goa into India by peaceful means.
 We thought that Nehru had not made up his mind and was being
 subjected to contradictory pressures.  We concluded:
 Clearly there is strong evidence pointing to an invasion-the military and
 political preparations have gone so far as to be difficult to reverse without
 some loss of prestige to the Indian government. Although the Indians perhaps
 still hope that their warlike activities will extract concessions from the Por-

 tuguese, we doubt that the Lisbon Government will move far enough-if at
 all-to meet Indian requirements.  However, relying chiefly on our judgment
 of what Nehru conceives to be India's basic interests and our assessment of his
 past behavior, we believe that the chances of a direct military invasion are
 still about even.
 Five days after this estimate was approved the Indians seized Goa
 by military force.
 The formulation in the final estimate was close to that of the staff
 draft. In a post-invasion memorandum to the Chairman of the Esti-
 mates Board, the head of the Near East Staff stated that initially he
 and his colleagues had rated the chances as less than even, "relying
 mainly on Nehru's restraint in previous crises over Goa and their
 estimate of his attitudes, objectives, and ability to control develop-
 ments," and that he had learned through informal contacts that the
 State Department people went even further, calling the odds "con-
 siderably less than even."  Nevertheless, impressed by the evidence
 of advancing preparations, the Staff was uncertain enough to qualify
 the chances as only "slightly less than even."
 The Estimates Board members, in their review, agreed generally
 with the experts.  It was difficult for me, as chairman, to dissent;
 but I was impressed more by the evidence of preparations than by
 the history of Nehru's political attitudes.  The reports from people
 who had seen the preparations and talked with the Indians sounded
 as if the latter meant business, meant to finish off the Goa affair once
 and for all.  Argument along these lines succeeded in moving the
 Board toward dead center-"The chances of a direct military inva-
 sion are still only about even"-and implying that as preparations
 continued and the Portuguese failed to give, the chances of invasion
 might rise.
 The coordination meetings did not help very much.  One depart-
 mental representative who wanted to raise the odds on invasion
 wanted also to add a paragraph about the threat to U.S.-Portuguese
 relations and U.S. base rights in the Azores if the Indians went ahead.
 It seemed to me that his position derived more from departmental
 interest than objective judgment, and this was not acceptable in an
 intelligence estimate.  We stayed with the Board's "still about even"
 formula, and the USIB also agreed to this without dissent.
 The day after the estimate was approved, the odds or. an invasion
 rose perceptibly in reports from New Delhi.  The Army attache said
 he believed invasion would "take place very soon."

 the country team believed that military action was
 imminent unless the Portuguese promptly folded.
 The only person who i not seem to thin
 an invasion was on was the U.S. ambassador in New Delhi, who
 expressed the belief that action was not imminent less than 24 hours
 before it began.
 The actual invasion gave a sense of vindication to those of us who
 had thought it likely, but it also raised the question of why the others
 had been wrong.  The evidence, though conflicting-the ambassador
 no doubt was the victim of some deceit-did include reports with a
 decided ring of seriousness.  Those who rated the chances of invasion
 as even or less than even of course read these reports.  They were
 relying on Nehru's high-mindedness, and since this did not jibe with
 the evidence, they had nowhere to go but to sit on the fence.  The
 lesson to be derived from this experience is not that one should look
 only at the evidence and disregard the doctrines and attitudes of
 leaders; that would be folly.  It is that one should try to reconcile
 the two; in so doing one might perhaps find that, as in the law, there
 is more than one line of precedent.
 Other Board members could, I am sure, make an analysis of how
 estimates in which they participated fell short and similarly draw
 lessons from them.  In time we could have enough lessons floating
 around to keep us tongue-tied.  We could fall into the tragic error
 of the young man whose aggressive and fast-moving brother killed
 himself by wrapping his car around a light pole; the surviving brother,
 having taken this lesson to heart and resolved to plod about on foot,
 was run over by a truck.  Our job is to make estimates; we have to
 take the plunge. This does not mean reckless diving, but it does not
 mean standing on the end of the diving board helpless with worry
 about every conceivable hazard to health and safety.
 There is no alternative to regarding each estimative problem as a
 new one and applying one's accumulated knowledge and experience
 to it. It helps to try to determine why we were right or why we
 were wrong and to use these determinations as signposts along the
 way, but we must also remember that the specialist who misled us
 on one estimate corrected our misapprehensions on another, that the

 INSURGENT COUNTERINTELLIGENCE
 Carlos Revilla Arango
 The leaders of an insurgent movement anticipate and counter efforts
 by established authority to acquire information about their organization
 and activities. The success of the Irish revolutionists must be ascribed
 in large part to the operational achievements of their security chief
 Michael Collins, who made it his job to know in advance what the
 British were going to do, on what information they based their action,
 and the identity of their sources.  He succeeded in this by gaining
 direct, personal access to metropolitan police records. A subject of
 his protective interest later wrote:
 About a fortnight after my return I received from him, not a copy, but the
 original of the report from the police of the districts through which I had
 passed.  . . . The fact that such an original document should have come into
 my hand was an example of the thoroughness with which Collins worked his
 intelligence system and enabled the I. R. A. to know what its enemy was
 thinking and often what the enemy proposed to do.'
 This is counterintelligence activity. The importance of a satisfac-
 tory counterintelligence effort is underscored by an instructor of
 Castro's Sierra Maestra guerrillas, General Alberto Bayo, who treated
 this subject in 23 of the 150 questions and answers he devised for
 guerrillas.  In his opinion a counterintelligence agent was of greater
 value than 50 machineguns: he could work among the security forces
 and keep one advised of all their intelligence and plans.2
 The insurgent organization's counterintelligence and security pro-
 gram must meet not only the threat posed by established governmental
 authority but that represented by competitive dissident groups, by the
 unilateral interests of third-country sponsors, sympathizers, and foes,
 and by disaffected members of its own organization.  It must do so

 through the acquisition and use of information on the personnel, or-
 ganization, modus operandi, assets, plans, and activities of those that
 seek to penetrate or compromise it. It must concern itself not only
 with an enemy's deliberate efforts but with chance crises of all kinds-
 some weak or careless act of an insurgent, an unannounced. curfew or
 document check, the compromise of a courier, or a natural disaster.
 Gompartmentation
 The leaders of an insurgency make every effort to win public recogni-
 tion for their cause and objectives.  One means they use is to carry
 out propaganda activities in large communities. They accept thereby
 the threat from urban police and security forces, who attend their
 public rallies and get copies of their flysheets and pamphlets. They
 anticipate the casualty list which follows from each night's wall-
 painting or window-breaking.  They sign petitions to parliament
 demanding redress of wrongs. They do not seek anonymity, but
 are eager to be heard and talked about in the market place.  They
 even lay claim to the achievements of competitive groups when these
 earn public approval.  They turn failure to advantage if it can serve
 to arouse the sympathy of the people, proclaiming their martyrs to
 the cause of freedom.
 They do these things because the future success of the insurgency
 depends on the establishment of a broad popular base, but there is a
 contradiction between the importance of security and this need for
 numbers.  Mao Tse-tung recognized the paradox but did not resolve
 it when he wrote that although closed-door sectarianism was im-
 permissible, vigilance against infiltration of the ranks was essential.;
 The contradiction is in practice resolved by compartmenting overt
 from clandestine activities, though coordinating the steps in each, and
 minimizing the possibility of compromise for the secret cadres.
 Because of the sensitive organizational knowledge held by an area
 coordinator, the fewer people who know his identity, functions, or
 business or home address, the better his security and that of the
 groups for which he is responsible.  "Street" and secret cells are
 established in both the city and the countryside.  The members of a
 street cell do not know the identities of their colleagues in the secret
 cell.  The members of the secret cell may learn the identities of those

 whose overt duties get their names into the papers, but the reverse
 should not be true.  The identity of the secret coordinator is similarly
 unknown to the leader of a street cell; each is required to report
 separately to a central committee.
 As a safeguard against possible compromises among the secret
 cadres General Bayo recommended that an urban underground be
 divided into cells of no more than three persons.  He warned against
 having cells of eight to ten men each, some of whom also served as
 chiefs of lesser units.4  His proposed figure, however, does not take
 into account the security hazard to an organization in which one
 of every three persons communicates with higher echelon.  Under
 this arrangement an urban coordinator must communicate with seven
 of every twenty-one persons working under his direction.  He can
 reduce these heavy communication needs by adopting a cell of seven,
 so that he deals with only three persons out of twenty-one.
 For field guerrilla units General Bayo proposed no more than ten
 to twenty men per cell: "The smaller the number, the greater the
 mobility." s  These figures are particularly applicable to the Andean
 regions of South America.  A larger group would find it difficult to
 conceal its members for any useful length of time from the gossips of
 the Indian communities.  The guerrilla chief would have difficulty
 controlling his group.  And forage is scarce and the Indians poor.
 Topography determines the size of field units in the Peruvian sierra.
 Security with Recruits
 In the field, in order to preserve the security of guerrilla camps,
 the initial training-assessment of guerrilla volunteers is usually carried
 out by street-type units which operate under the guise of sports clubs.
 Yet the security of these units is critical.  It is difficult to conceal
 the absence of young men from their villages or fields for any extended
 period of time.  Their lack of discipline, their status as weekend war-
 riors, and the possibilities of dissatisfaction or defection are matters
 of great concern.  Therefore instructors are brought to the training
 camps from the cities or from another country to work under aliases
 with students whose true names they do not know.  Classes are held
 at night in areas remote from main settlements.   The students are
 kept for one or two hours at the most, or only for as many minutes

 as they might spend away from their own villages visiting friends.
 The stated purpose of the instruction is training in guerrilla warfare,
 but at this stage the main aim is assessment of the student.
 The urgent task of a training cell coordinator is to satisfy himself
 about the reliability and personal security of a volunteer,  He tries to
 learn as much as possible' about the man during the few hours he has
 him under observation.  Might he really be working for the govern-
 ment?  In any case can one trust him with secrets?  With money-
 or the lives of others? What is his motivation?
 The coordinator's assessment constitutes the first line of defense
 against police penetration of the insurgent organization.  And if the
 police manage to penetrate his training group they will encounter
 many safeguards set up to limit damage to the movement.
 In advance of the training-assessment, investigation and surveillance
 are essential for checking the bona fides of volunteers.  For this work
 the organization selects individuals who have or can build a suitable
 cover.  They may work under the cover of beggars or in the guise
 of persons seeking employment.  The investigator asking questions
 about the candidate may do so under the pretext of collecting a debt
 or of selling goods or services to homes in the neighborhood.
 In a typical case an investigator who has the job of checking a
 volunteer's background will first find out where he lives and talk to
 shopkeepers in the immediate neighborhood, corner news vendors,
 barbers, and coffee boys in nearby cafes.  He tries to elicit com-
 ments that point to lines for further investigation: "The police often
 talked to him, though his mother says he has been in no trouble."
 "He applied for a government job and then went away."  "He owed
 me much money and ran off."  Then the investigator will report to
 his superiors and intensify his inquiry.  His search for information
 is no less thorough and frequently more so than that of government
 investigators.  The insurgent organization has more at stake.
 Communications Security
 Communications are the most sensitive element in any secret ac-
 tivity.  If an adversary gains control over one of the links in a com-
 munications net it can monitor or exploit a group's transmissions,
 rendering the work of the group hazardous or useless and collecting
 leads for further penetrations.  For this reason an insurgent organiza-
 tion must have arrangements whereby funds, material, instructions,

 and reports can be passed among its members with a high level of
 security.  It may use personal contact, mail, telephone, telegraph,
 newspaper advertisements, couriers, drops, and signs or signals con-
 cealed from the general public, but it observes the principles of
 communication which are gospel to illegal groups throughout the
 world.
 It uses codes and cover names in both oral and written comimunica-
 tions.                               It conceals the identities and missions of its couriers from
 echelons which have no need to know them.  The couriers use a
 cover which fits their background and skills. They set up alternative
 meeting sites in any plan for contact, and they give signals to indicate
 an absence of danger before going ahead with a meeting. Similarly,
 the organization may transmit a broader warning to its people by
 simply refraining from an otherwise indicated action. It may direct
 that compromising materials be passed by means of drops even when
 it has authorized a personal contact between the members in question.
 Or it may order that personal meetings be held to a minimum even
 when the participants have plausible social or business reasons to
 meet: what seem good ostensible reasons to them may not be readily
 apparent to a police observer.
 The significance of these precautions should be evident.  Unless
 the police get the details of a prisoner's safety signal, he can, when
 they release him under their concealed control, warn an approaching
 colleague of danger just by taking no action to indicate its absence.
 Or if the police do not learn in time about a prisoner's next regularly
 scheduled meeting, his failure to make it will warn his headquarters
 of trouble. Or failure of a scheduled safety check which requires his
 presence at a specified place and time for observation by insurgent
 surveillants may give the warning.
 Insurgents generally avoid the use of the mails for sensitive com-
 munications.  They may send innocuous messages by telephone or
 telegraph to signal the safe arrival of a member or to request a per-
 sonal contact, but they prefer to keep in touch by courier. A courier
 can see his contact, satisfy himself that the man is not in. custody,
 conduct a countersurveillance to ensure that he is "clean," assess his
 behavior for the enlightenment of the leaders, and give instructions
 orally in more detail than a letter can.
 The insurgents often use drops for the transmission of funds, in-
 structions, or material. These drops need not have a KGB sophistica-
 tion if they serve to conceal the act of communication. They may be

 a hole in a tree, a hollow under a stone, or a crevice in a wall.  Or a
 fruit jar buried in a field, a flower vase in a cemetery, or a. kilometer
 marker on a desert road. They need only to be places to which both
 parties have normal access and can devise acceptable cover stories
 to approach.
 Names and Identities
 It is a common practice for members of illegal groups to use war
 names to help conceal their true identities from colleagues and ul-
 timately from security forces.  Peruvian security police must have
 spent long hours in their analysis of a message they found among the
 personal effects of a prisoner:
 Tell D-1 that B-145 will arrive tomorrow morning at 12 noon en Canadian
 Pacific.  Tell him to alert Grity, Malla, Maruja, Pasch, Hilda that all is well."
 The war name is used in secret oral and written communications-
 in messages, in discussions at cell meetings or around campfires, some-
 times in formal reports in place of numbers.  It should not be on
 personal documents or in pocket litter. If compromised, it is changed.
 A war name may or may not match the sex of its bearer.  It should
 not link a man to a trade or a region. It may be a full name-Jose
 Armand Dubois-or simply Armand.  It may be "Saxon" only if its
 bearer is not from Saxony; "Quasimodo" if he is not a hunchback;
 "Stupid" if he is not.
 A change of war names creates problems for the police. They can
 learn of one name through penetration of enemy communications
 or from careless talk by members of the insurgency, record it, and
 begin to build a profile of the bearer.  But a change vitiates these
 records.  It leads to inaccurate estimates of insurgent strength or,
 more seriously, to confusion of identities.  The police find themselves
 wondering if Jose has replaced Juan as the leader of a unit, or
 indeed whether Juan was ever the leader, or if Jose and Juan are pos-
 sibly identical.  From this uncertainty the insurgents gain a measure
 of security.
 The insurgent organization, for its part, makes every effort to iden-
 tify individual police officers, police informants, and hostile installa-
 tions. It prepares lists of such individuals and installations and briefs
 its couriers and action units to avoid them.  It avoids putting a safe-
 site in the area of a police or security establishment.  It directs a

 threatened unit to move to a place more remote from such an establish-
 ment. A courier is given the physical description of a security official
 operating on his route so that if he is caught he knows whether he is
 in the hands of security personnel or less dangerous adversaries.
 Controls over Cadres
 The insurgent organization usually imposes travel restrictions on its
 cadres and couriers. It warns them against carrying documents which
 conflict with agreed cover stories. It emphasizes the value of story-
 confirming pocket litter, such as a letter from the family requesting
 that their son return home (a usual explanation for travel) or match
 boxes from a hotel where the traveller claims to have stayed.  It
 finances small purchases of hardware or food from the town in which
 he claims past residence, or of materials related to his professed
 occupation, and has him carry the receipts for these purchases.
 The organization creates a system whereby one member of a cell
 or guerrilla unit is responsible for knowing the whereabouts of a col-
 league at all times. On occasion it checks the whereabouts of some
 particular member.  It may send a coded telegram directing him to
 report to a specified address.  It may telephone his residence from
 a pay booth to see whether he is home. It may send a courier, if he
 lives in a distant province, with an order that he report to the capital
 city. If he is absent from his assigned post without cause, the leaders
 order an investigation.
 In an insurgency the problems of control are intrinsic, far surpassing
 those encountered by the government in its secret work.  It is part
 of the secret insurgent's business to know how to cover unauthorized
 or illegal ventures with plausible explanations. Before he opens his
 door to step forth on a secret action he has readied multiple cover
 arrangements.  (He is going to buy bread or pay an account at the
 cafe.  But on the way he passes an old wall, and if there is a sign
 on it he must service a drop a block from the town plaza. The way
 to this drop is fortunately also the way to an old friend's house, so he
 is covered at every point.) He lives in a world of security arrange-
 ments and survives by observing them.  If the police recruit him, he
 has only changed sponsors, not this security way of life.  The in-
 surgent leaders have a constant concern over this possibility-.  They
 cannot object to a suspect's covering his movements and engaging
 in practices they have taught him to be essential to good security.

 They must therefore refine their controls and devise tests to assess
 his reliability.
 Some tests are simple.  The leaders may give Jose letters to mail
 to Alberto.  By instruction Alberto returns these unopened.  Had
 Jose opened the letters? They may direct Jose to service a drop con-
 taining a specified sum of money.  Jose finds in the drop a sum
 far in excess of what he was told to expect.  Does he turn it all over,
 or only the specified sum? They may order Jose to take a trip. Dur-
 ing his absence a team searches his house or room for any records
 he may have kept in violation of secrecy rules. It also assesses his
 household possessions against his known income.  If it finds nothing
 it may leave some clear evidence of its search.  Does Jose report a
 suspicion that his quarters were searched in his absence?
 The leaders may write Jose a letter as though from the security
 police and ask his cooperation.  They include a sum cf money as
 evidence of good faith and give instructions for future contact. Does
 Jose report this attempt at recruitment?  Does he hand over the
 letter and the right amount of money? They may place him under
 carefully concealed surveillance for a period of time and then ask
 him to submit a written report on his activities and contacts during
 that time.  What items does his report omit? They may brief him
 on an impending violent action against the government and then
 surveil its site.  Have the police been warned? 7
 The courage, patience, and altertness of members can he tested by
 other devices.   But the all-important thing is reliability and honesty.
 In a sense, with this need to he sure of the full loyalty of its people,
 the insurgent organization thrives on suspicion. Yet the pressure of
 its controls breeds discontent among members. When malcontents or
 traitors are uncovered, the leaders reemphasize the rules of conduct
 and establish new levels of severity which further disgruntle the
 membership.  At the same time, however, these restrictions and con-
 trols do make the life of an agent who penetrates the group both
 difficult and hazardous, and his case officer must have a thorough
 knowledge of the protective tactics used by the dissident leaders.

 The Uninvited
 The insurgent takes measures to guard his camp or cell against
 those who come uninvited to the door.  He extends a cautious wel-
 come to any newcomer and examines the man's credentials with care.
 In the world of counterintelligence no one assumes he knows whom
 he is dealing with.
 When camp outguards intercept a newcomer they follow a pre-
 arranged reception plan.  They usually take him to a site removed
 from the main camp.  They get his full name, address, occupation,
 the route by which he came, the identity of anyone who may have
 directed him to the camp, and the whereabouts of his family.  They
 ask who knew of his intention to come.  They ask what his friends,
 family, or employer think he is doing now.
 The camp chief checks the man's biographic data against the
 knowledge possessed by members of his command.  If he claims to
 be a fisherman from a particular village, and if there is a guerrilla
 in the camp who knows the people and principal officials of that
 village, the story can be readily checked.  If he claims to have walked
 there by a particular route, his shoes are checked against that claim.
 If he says he was directed there by a friend sympathetic to the move-
 ment, the friend's identity will be checked by investigative personnel
 in the place concerned.
 Clothing is given the newcomer in exchange for what he wore
 when he came.  Guards check the latter for labels, quality, markings,
 wear, and travel stain as evidence to support or refute his story.  They
 check letters, identity or voter registration cards, matchbooks, and
 cigarettes.  They may check his health and appearance against their
 estimate ,of the wear and tear of his professed occupation and recent
 experience.  The guards who live with him at the processing camp
 make every effort to get him to talk freely. They talk about the area
 he came from, question him concerning his likes and dislikes, and
 comment on true and notional personalities in his home village..  Does
 he truly know the mayor of the village? Does he also know one
 Senor Gasco de Barmas--a creature of their imagination? Has he
 really been in that small bar to the right of the alley of women?
 Conversely, the guards avoid talking about the number, equipment,
 supplies, plans, activities, or true identities of the guerrillas. They
 use their war names in conversation.  They do not discuss other
 members of the group, their comings and goings, or their problems.

 The camp chief sends the details of the newcomer's story to an area
 coordinator for investigation.  If no information is turned up to refute
 the story he may then direct him to report to a training camp.  When
 the man is gone he moves his command to another site, since its loca-
 tion had become known to a person of unproved reliability.
 If the area coordinator concludes from his investigation that there
 is reason to doubt the volunteer's bona fides, he may order the camp
 chief simply to desert the suspect as he moves his group to the other
 site.  Or put him in charge of a remote, unused camp site and leave
 him there.  This is a very good thing to do.  If the boy works for the
 police he has no contact with them now and we can move freely
 out of the area.  The boy guards an old camp of straw- huts and
 latrines.  He believes that we will return and take him with us.  But
 the camp is very far away from any village.  He dares not leave to
 make contact with the police because who knows when we might
 return?    So he sits out the days.  Or the area coordinator may, finally,
 direct that the suspect be escorted to a point near the city, where he
 can be tricked into an overseas trip for "training," i.e., interrogation
 under control.
 A camp chief must be concerned about the presence in his area
 of any competitive groups of dissidents.  He remembers that Fidel
 Castro, as dictator, had some success in establishing state-controlled
 guerrilla groups which served as magnets to draw the discontented,
 the dissident, or the disillusioned to their graves.  Or he remembers
 groups which volunteered to join his own but then brought problems
 of command which he could not control.    If he discovers that he has
 a genuinely competitive though friendly group as a neighbor, his
 worries are not less.  It may not have good security, may not be
 careful in assessing its membership.  He cannot afford to be caught
 in a counterinsurgency sweep even though he may not be its target.
 Once, said the boy, some fishermen gave me a ride in their boat.
 did not know they were smugglers.     The police caught is all-but
 it was me they tortured.
 A camp chief must beware of hunters or zoologists who roam his
 area.  They may report his presence to the police.  He must also
 beware of the local peasants' penchant for gossip; the civil guard has
 long ears.  At the same time he must keep the peasants' favor, since
 he cannot survive their enmity.  In anticipation of the eventualities
 lie readies alternative camp sites for use by his group. At a time of

 danger he may move his people to one of these or, with central com-
 mittee approval, disband the force and direct its members to fade
 into the cities and villages.
 The Counterintelligence Organization
 The guerrilla chief and the area coordinator have prime responsi-
 bility for the counterintelligence effort.  General Bayo felt so strongly
 about the contribution of counterintelligence to the revolutionary
 movement that he recommended the second in command be put in
 charge of it.  The counterintelligence organization is responsible for
 the security of the movement's personnel, assets, and activities.  It
 acquires sources to report on hostile security organizations and com-
 petitive groups, maintains appropriate records, and isolates and in-
 terrogates hostile agents.  Ordinary members of the movement know
 that it has a counterintelligence capability, but not what assets are
 involved; the counterintelligence personnel are concealed from the
 rank and file.
 The counterintelligence program usually includes periodic lectures
 on security discipline, spot surveillance of personnel, and provocative
 tests of loyalty.  An effective program which can strengthen the
 group as a whole provides for each cell to appoint one of its members
 secretary for discipline.  This member is charged with enforcing
 the .decrees of the central committee and maintaining an acceptable
 level of security.  He gives lectures, ensures the security of cell
 meetings, reports secrecy violations to the cell chief for transmittal
 to higher echelon, and carries out other security and counterintelli-
 gence tasks as assigned by the central committee.
 The Tainted
 The insurgent organization also safeguards its security by taking
 prompt and effective action against suspect members and newly re-
 leased prisoners.  When a member is arrested it orders his immediate
 colleagues into hiding.  It seals off the activities in which he was in-
 volved, changes communication systems known to him, and sends
 his family to a safesite.  After taking these immediate protective
 measures it analyzes the circumstances of his arrest.  It investigates
 anyone who might for some reason have reported him to the police.
 It questions his wife to assess her attitude toward him.  It may, if
 time permits and a preliminary analysis does not warn against it,
 search his home and examine his personal effects to satisfy itself

 that no record of his activities is there.  If his knowledge includes
 matters of an unusually sensitive nature, it may take action to deny
 the government the advantage of it-a smash-and-grab raid, or pre-
 ventive executive action against the prisoner himself.
 Each member of an insurgency is instructed in advance on what
 steps he should take on release from prison.  He should make no
 written or oral contact with his group but proceed to a designated
 point at a time set for this purpose.  If countersurveilh.nce shows
 no hostile coverage of the former prisoner, the counterintelligence unit
 will pick him up and take him to a rendezvous from which a second
 group will transport him to a safesite for interrogation.  This pattern
 of countersurveillance and reacquisition is standard procedure.  The
 safeguards are obvious.
 At the safesite counterintelligence specialists question their colleague
 in detail.  When and where was he arrested?  Who were the arrest-
 ing officers?  What charges did they levy against him?  Was any-
 one arrested with him? Where was he taken?                                 What questions were
 asked? Was he shown photographs of individuals to identify?  Whom
 did he identify? Was he given maps on which to pinpoint facilities?
 What safesites or communications did he reveal?  Was he asked
 to cooperate with the police? What did the police promise him?
 Was he forced to cooperate?  (A man can be brave but need not be
 foolish, they tell him.  If he was forced to talk, they know he did
 so from prudence and not from fear or greed.)  But what did they
 promise him?  Where was he jailed?  How does he know? What
 were the names of his guards?  How does he know?  Was he in-
 deed tortured?                               Did he have a cell mate?  What was his name?
 O id they engage in conversation?  What was said? Now, where
 did he go upon release?  Whom did he talk to?  What did he tell
 the neighbors? Whom did he try to contact? How?
 It is important to know what the charges were against the member
 and who his jailor was.  If the charge is black market dealing and
 the arresting authority the financial police, the insurgent group's
 problems may be less serious than they might have been.  Although
 a member who deals in the black market for personal gain is not
 one to be trusted. financial police do not generally have the same
 level of competence as the security forces.  Their interests do not
 usually impinge on the very security of the state and they are not
 skilled interrogators-and only determined and experienced officers
 can get critical information from members of a well-run insurgency.

 Insurgent Counterintelligence            OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 It is also important that the group know what its colleague may
 have revealed of its interests.  Unless he is part of the central com-
 mittee, a member does not usually know how sensitive each item of
 information he possesses is.  He may, like Ito Ritsu, whose red-herring
 revelation ultimately led the Japanese police to Richard Sorge, give
 his captors the name of a person whom he believes is expendable.
 If the dissident movement believes its colleague behaved correctly,
 it will order him to return home and lie low for a period of time.  It
 may permit his family to rejoin him, since that would be normal.
 It will direct him to cease all contact with the movement until in-
 formed to the contrary, and it alerts its membership to this effect.
 It then checks the details of his story through various counterintelli-
 gence assets. If it comes to believe that the man has turned against
 the movement, it may redouble him, turning him back against the
 police, or order him to leave the country illegally and go to Cuba
 for "his own security," i.e. liquidation.
 General Bayo recommends the execution of traitors in these cir-
 cumstances.  Although this worked in Castro's insurgency it is not
 always the end of the victim's influence.  An execution in the home
 country leaves emotional scars and memories which return to haunt
 the executioner. But death by accident in another country, while
 on a mission for the movement, provides inspiration for those who
 remain behind.  Counterintelligence disposes of a threat and gains
 a hero.
 Instead of by killing, a police agent may be blocked by provoca-
 tion.  Once we learned that a shopkeeper in our city worked as an in-
 formant for the police.  We decided to destroy him But how?  To
 kill was easy.  But the police would investigate.  They would, of
 course, know why he was killed.  Some of our people would be picked
 up as suspects. They would be hurt.  They were brave, but they
 might talk.  It would be a mistake.  We thought of other things.
 One of us thought of something that was very good.  The informer
 was a good family man.  A bad person, but a good family man.  He
 had one child, a four-year-old girl. She had white hair and blue eyes.
 He loved her very much. We often saw him buy her ice cream, and
 then they would walk home together.  We bought a doll that had
 blue eyes and white hair. We dressed it in white.  It was very beauti-
 ful.  We crushed its head with a rock and put it on the doorstep
 of his house and rang the bell.  We ran off and into a building from
 where we could watch.   He came to the door. At first he looked

 around, I think a little afraid. And then he saw the doll. He shut
 the door very quickly.  The next day he left with his wife and child
 for the capital.  He did not return.  He did not pay his servants;
 they were very angry.   The police arrested no one.
 The insurgency makes every effort to place its informants as serv-
 ants in the homes of police officers, in police clubs, or with other
 hostile personalities.  The value of such plants is evident.  They can
 get useful information from dinner conversations or by answering the
 telephone in the absence of their master or by monitoring his mail.
 The movement also uses money or persuasion to acquire informants
 in opposition political groups or security organizations.   Since the
 conditions which give rise to the insurgency also affect the living
 standards and hopes of the noncommitted, opportunities for recruit-
 ment of sources in hostile groups are many.  A little money, a little
 uncertainty, a little fear-and we find friends. We. even make friends
 in prison.  If I am detained I am authorized to offer so many dollars
 to my guard.  If he doubts the validity of this offer, because I seem
 poor and dirty, I let him see a part of the sum.  Not from me, but
 from the committee.  That the committee can offer such a sum, small
 to us but great to him, makes an impression.  He leaves the question
 open and an open mind for the future. We do not press.  The next
 time he has more trust.
 You see, we build trust in people.  Only the police destroy; we
 build.  Soon this guard, because he likes money, and because he
 has learned to respect our work, and maybe because he fears us just
 a little bit, is cooperative.  He passes information which may or may
 not be important.  What is important is the fact that he passes it.
 To know that your family will be permitted to visit you in prison is
 not a great thing, for example.  But the fact that the guard tells you
 this is important. He has taken a step, a first step.
 Penetration of competitive political groups is not a major problem.
 Since these are aiming in part at the same goals, an organization which
 has contacts abroad and funds at hand finds congenial spirits among
 such competitors. An aggressive leadership, a record of publicly ac-
 knowledged accomplishment, or a known plan for the future often
 suffices to ease the conscience of selected competitors who cooperate,
 telling themselves that the means to an end are not important.

 Thus the insurgent organization takes certain protective measures
 to counter the espionage and disruptive efforts of opposing forces.
 These measures are designed to conceal its organization, plans, per-
 sonnel, assets, and activities from hostile penetration.  Since, how-
 ever, defensive measures cannot by themselves ensure security, it
 assigns counterintelligence personnel the task of learning about the
 plans, personnel, operations, assets, and organization of its adversaries.

 CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE UNDER SOUERS
 Arthur B. Darling i
 The first Director of Central Intelligence was well aware of the
 latent power bestowed on this office by the President's Directive of
 January 22, 1946.  Admiral Souers wished to see the functions of
 the Director mature under the guidance of the departmental secre-
 taries and the personal representative of the President who constituted
 the National Intelligence Authority.  But he also knew that many
 in the Army, the Navy, and the Department of State were still re-
 sisting every thought of a central intelligence organization which
 might overpower their own intelligence agencies. The Authority, the
 Director, and the Central Intelligence Group were bolstered by no
 supporting legislation from the Congress. They rested only upon this
 Directive by the President to the Secretaries of State, War, and the
 Navy.  And the President's legal authority to issue the Directive was,
 with the expiration of his wartime powers, at best questionable.  Souers
 appreciated that this was no time to foster misgiving or animosity.
 No rough waters should be raised as Congress approached a reorgani-
 zation of the national military establishment in which the central in-
 telligence system would have a part.
 Admiral Souers' immediate objective was to get the CIG estab-
 lished and in operation as a small body of experts drawn propor-
 tionately from the departments and serving the departments under
 supervision and control of the department heads in the National In-
 telligence Authority.  The power inherent in the DCI's duties and re-
 sponsibilities should wait until later for development.  Moreover,
 Souers did not accept Donovan's principle that the DCI should ever
 be independent of the departmental secretaries, equal if not superior
 to them, and responsible directly to the President .2   He believed that

 such independence would not place the Director close to the Presi-
 dent, but would tend in fact to isolate him from the President.  An
 independent DCI would discover that often he and his agency were
 shut off from the President by the interests and representations of the
 departments.  Through their prestige and functions they were likely
 to have greater power, at least of obstruction.
 As a practical matter, in politics and the science of government,
 such an extraordinary officer as the DCI needed, in Souers' view, the
 company of other officials.  On occasion he might find their opposi-
 tion almost as useful as their assent.  His position might become
 clearer and stronger, at least it would command attention, because
 it had to be formally opposed. An independent Director of eminence
 and exceptional force might realize Donovan's concept, by-passing
 the departments to deal directly with the President, regardless of
 obstruction.  But even such a Director would have to keep ever-
 lastingly at it, and he would always have a hidden war on his hands.
 The time for a DCI with those attributes was not at the start of the
 new organization in February 1946.  It might not survive the battle.
 A Cooperative Formed
 It was Admiral Souers' nature to remove issues rather than to create
 them.  And like Eberstadt, he was mindful of the benefits which might
 be obtained from "parallel, competitive, and sometimes conflicting
 efforts." 3  According to the President's Directive, which he himself
 had shared in writing, the persons assigned from the departments
 were "collectively" to form the Central Intelligence Group.  His draft
 on February 4 of the first directive to himself from the National In-
 telligence Authority, therefore, declared that CIG should be or-
 ganized and operated as "a cooperative interdepartmental activity."
 There should be in it "adequate and equitable participation" by the
 State, War, and Navy Departments and by other agencies as approved
 by the Authority.  The Army Air Forces should have representation
 on the same basis as Army and Navy; there was likely soon to be a
 Department of Air.
 Those in the Bureau of the Budget and the Department of justice
 who watched legalities were uneasy about the dubious validity of
 the President's Directive.  The draft of an executive order, approved

 Navy departments.  Souers had written the military intelligence section of this
 report. See ibid., p. 10.

 CIG Under Souers                         CONFIDENTIAL
 by Acting Attorney General J. Howard McGrath, was ready in Feb-
 ruary to replace the Directive.  The view of the National Intelligence
 Authority was that no impediment had so far been encountered in
 carrying out the Directive, but there was no objection to having an
 executive order as well, if its effect were to "confirm and formalize"
 the status of the Authority and the CIG as a "cooperative interdepart-
 mental activity, rather than a new or independent agency requiring
 legislation for its existence."
 The questionable rationale for regarding it as a joint activity rather
 than an agency rested on the fact that personnel and funds were to be
 contributed by the participating departments.  It should be noted,
 however, that administrative chaos would have been the result of
 trying to administer it on a joint basis.  The departmental secre-
 taries therefore had to empower the Director of Central Intelligence
 to exercise the same authorities over the funds made available to him
 as they themselves could exercise.  Thus the effect was to create
 an operating agency.
 Further discussion and study of the question continued through the
 spring.  By May 23rd all parties were willing to accept the above
 rationale and let the Directive stand for the time being.  No one in
 the Executive Branch was going to raise the issue publicly and
 formally; and the Comptroller General, who could have done so,
 agreed with the need for the organization and was willing to let it
 proceed until legislation could be obtained.  Until superseded the
 following year by the Central Intelligence Agency, established by act
 of Congress, CIG therefore rested upon the President's authority under
 the Constitution, with no particular reference to his war power, in
 the face of a statute that prohibited the establishment of an operating
 agency except by legislation.
 To satisfy President Truman's wish that CIG should bring all in-
 telligence activities into coordination and harmony, the first NIA
 directive constituted of the departmental intelligence chiefs an In-
 telligence Advisory Board, and Admiral Souers planned to keep its
 composition flexible.  Its membership, in addition to the chief in-
 telligence officers from the Departments of State, War, and the Navy
 and the Army Air Forces, should include representatives from other
 agencies of the government at the Director's invitation.  This gave
 room for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for example, to have a
 representative present on questions of internal security or the collec-
 tion of intelligence in Latin America.

 CONFIDENTIAL                            CIG Under Souers
 Having the same purpose of coordination in mind, Admiral Souers
 preferred in the beginning to name ad hoc committees to study and
 report on specific problems of interdepartmental concern.  The com-
 mittee members would represent the permanent departmental mem-
 bers of the Intelligence Advisory Board, with a chairman drawn from
 CIG to act as "coordinator." In theory this procedure promised the
 greatest cooperation and harmony possible.  The practical difficulty
 of obtaining the representatives from the departments to man the
 ad hoc committees and to accomplish their work in time, however,
 was discouraging.  Sowers soon turned to his Central Planning Staff
 to handle such problems.
 It was going to be none too easy to apportion out CIG appointments
 among the departments and secure persons both competent and in-
 clined to enter the central intelligence service.  But Admiral Souers
 did not find it hard to fill his top positions. Kingman Douglass, who
 had been a representative of the Air Forces at the Air Ministry in
 London and knew much about the British system, became Assistant
 Director and Acting Deputy Director.  Captain William B. Goggins
 came with intelligence experience from the Navy to head the Central
 Planning Staff.  In April Souers would appoint Colonel Louis J. Fortier
 Assistant Director and Acting Chief of Operational Services.  He had
 served on the Joint Intelligence Staff for the Army and had just
 finished chairing a study of the clandestine operational assets left
 by the OSS and now held in escrow in the War Department as its
 Strategic Services Unit.4
 Souers obtained James S. Lay, Jr., from the State Department to
 be Secretary of the Authority and of the Intelligence Advisory Board.
 Lay had been Secretary to the joint Intelligence Committee of the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Ludwell L. Montague also came from State
 to head the Central Reports Staff.  He had been Secretary of the
 Joint Army-Navy Intelligence Committee in the fall of 1941, then
 Secretary of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff and a senior Army member of its joint Intelligence Staff through-
 out the war.  Both Lay and Montague had participated in the dis-
 cussions which had contributed, along with Donovan's "principles"
 and Magruder's thinking, to the eventual formulation of the Presi-
 dent's Directive.  They had been chosen by Alfred McCormack for
 'In July, after General Hoyt Vandenberg took over as DCI, both Douglass and
 Goggins were transferred to positions under Fortier's successor, Colonel Donald H.

 his prospective central intelligence system under the State Depart-
 ment.6  Both were expert in the work which the new CIG was to
 undertake and qualified to aid Souers immediately, as they did, in
 writing the directives of the National Intelligence Authority. CIG
 had begun to take form on January 25.
 Operational Information
 The draft of the first directive to Souers in February followed the
 general design of the President's Directive of January 22.6  But there
 was one clause in the draft so filled with past controversy and indica-
 tive of more to come that it did not appear in the directive as finally
 adopted by the NIA.  Article 7 of the draft submitted by Admiral
 Souers stipulated that the DCI should have "all necessary facilities,
 intelligence, and information in the possession of our respective de-
 partments, including necessary information as to policies, plans,
 actions, capabilities, and intentions of the United States with reference
 to foreign countries." At Souers' own suggestion, the clause con-
 cerning the capabilities and intentions of the United States was stricken
 from the draft in the first meeting of the NIA on February 5, 1946.
 There was no explanation in the minutes, but one can reconstruct
 the reasons.
 It is easy to presume that those who had been so reluctant to
 give the Office of Strategic Services and its Research and Analysis
 .Branch access to strategic information 7 were no more willing now to
 supply to the new DCI knowledge of their own capabilities and
 intentions.  And at the first intimation that the specific inclusion of
 this provision might stir resistance in the armed services over their
 right to withhold "operational" matters, Admiral Souers preferred to
 remove the statement with no argument.  The beginning of the CIG
 was precarious enough without inviting trouble that could be post-
 poned.  According to Souers, the Army and the Navy both under-
 stood that he was entitled by the President's Directive to have all
 intelligence in their possession.  From their point of view, he said,
 information about "policies, plans, actions, capabilities, and intentions
 of the United States" was not intelligence.  In their thinking, the new

 Central Intelligence Group was expected to purvey all its knowledge
 to the departments, but the reverse was not entirely true, particularly
 with respect to "operational" information.
 Close examination of Article 7 as issued in final form by the NIA
 nevertheless reveals that the Authority gave to the DCI the right
 to have "as required in the performance" of his authorized mission,
 "all necessary facilities, intelligence, and information" in the posses-
 sion of the departments.  This distinguished "intelligence" from "in-
 formation" but applied to both the unequivocal "all," modified only
 by the requirements of the CIG mission.  That mission, as stated in
 Article 2 of the directive, included furnishing "strategic and national
 policy intelligence to the President and the State, War, and Navy
 Departments."  And knowledge of the nation's own capabilities enters
 into the intelligence which is necessary to determine the policy for
 maintaining the nation's security.  The requirement of an effective
 national estimate is that it shall be compounded from all facts to be
 had from every available source.
 Dissents
 Article 3 of the first directive to Souers stipulated that 'all recom-
 mendations" of the DCI should be referred to the Intelligence Advisory
 Board "for concurrence or comment" prior to submission to the Au-
 thority.  If a member of the IAB did not concur, the Director was to
 submit with his recommendation the member's explanation of his non-
 concurrence.  Only if the IAB approved the Director's recommenda-
 tion unanimously might he put it into effect without action by the
 Authority.
 The Lovett Committee 8 had proposed such a procedure for national
 estimates to safeguard the interests of the departmental intelligence
 services as they came under the coordinating power of the central
 intelligence organization.  William H. Jackson's letter to Secretary
 Forrestal contained a similar provision."  But this stipulation, which
 eventually became established practice in estimating, was to be, in
 its application to "recommendations," the center of controversy be-

 tween subsequent DCIs and the IAB over the administration of the
 CIG and its successor CIA.  The chiefs of departmental intelligence
 used it to try to make themselves the governing board of the "coopera-
 tive interdepartmental activity."  If they had their wish, it was not to
 be an independent agency.
 Secretary Byrnes, just returned from London, presided over the
 first meeting of the NIA on February 5, 1946.  Byrnes wished to make
 it clear at once that the Department of State was responsible for report-
 ing to the President on matters of foreign policy. And this included
 performing the service that the President himself had expressly desig-
 nated the first duty of the new CIG: Instead of the piles of cables,
 dispatches, and reports on his desk, President Truman wanted a daily
 summary that was comprehensive.  He wished to be rid of the
 mass of papers, and yet to be certain that nothing significant had
 been left out.
 Admiral Souers endeavored to reassure Secretary Byrnes that the
 President expected the DCI only to have the cables and dispatches
 digested; there was no intention that the information should be inter-
 preted to advise the President on matters of foreign policy.  The Sec-
 retary nevertheless pressed the point that it was his function to supply
 the President with information upon which to base his conclusions.
 Admiral Leahy entered the discussion as the personal representative of
 the President; information from all three departments, he said, should
 be summarized in order to keep the President currently informed.
 Byrnes replied that Admiral Souers would not be representing the
 viewpoint of any of the departments; any man assigned to GIG from a
 department would be responsible to the DCI.
 Secretary Byrnes felt so strongly about the matter that he appealed
 to the President personally on behalf of the Department of State.
 According to the recollection of Admiral Souers, his argument ran
 along the line that a digest of incoming dispatches was not intelligence
 within the jurisdiction of the CIG.  President Truman said it might
 not be generally considered intelligence, but it was information which
 he needed and therefore it was intelligence to him.  It was agreed in
 the end that the CIG daily summaries should be "factual statements."
 The Department of State prepared its own digest, so the President
 had two summaries on his desk.  From his point of view, that was at
 least some improvement.

 Central Planning, March-June 1946
 The Central Planning Staff, drawn from the department;, was to be
 sensitive to the interests of them all.  It should assist the Director in
 preparing recommendations with regard to policies and objectives for
 the whole "national intelligence mission," according to the second
 NIA directive of February 8.  Admiral Souers advised Captain Goggins
 on March 4 that "as a general rule, the Staff should take the active
 leadership in arranging and conducting interdepartmental studies."
 One of its members should participate and act as coordinator in all
 meetings concerning foreign intelligence related to the national security.
 As the use of ad hoc interdepartmental committees proved difficult,
 the Central Planning Staff was soon loaded with orders for investigation
 and report upon a variety of subjects that were intricate and sweeping.
 The Staff had a hand in preparing the executive order which was
 intended but not used to confirm the President's Directive.  On March
 21 it undertook a broad survey of all clandestine collection of foreign
 intelligence.  On March 28 it received instruction to make a survey
 of the coverage of the foreign-language press in the United States.
 The next day it was assigned an interim survey of the collection of
 intelligence in China.  On April 20 it was directed to examine the Joint
 Intelligence Study Publishing Board of the Joint Intelligence Com-
 mittee and determine whether there should be a change in its super-
 vision and control.
 The Central Planning Staff inherited a share in the steady of the
 Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service which the Federal Communi-
 cations Commission had organized to monitor foreign news and propa-
 ganda.  The Service had been taken over by the War Department on
 the preceding December 30 for the remainder of the fiscal year, and the
 War Department wished to have it placed in the new central intelli-
 gence organization.  But Souers was not eager to expand the opera-
 tional services of the Central Intelligence Group.  On the basis of an
 ad hoc committee's report he had recommended on April 26 that the
 War Department continue to operate the Service with a new organiza-
 tion, that is with personnel thoroughly screened for security.  The War
 Department had demurred, May 8, on the ground that the State Depart-
 ment was the chief user of this "predominantly non-military intelli-
 gence function."  The matter was discussed the next day by the IAB.
 It was at this point that members of the Central Planning Staff were
 directed to consult with representatives of the Assistant Chief of Staff

 (G-2) and the Special Assistant to the Secretary of State. The result
 was that the latter, now William L. Langer in place of Alfred Mc-
 Cormack, agreed on behalf of the Department of State that it should
 support the FBIS budget, while the War Department continued to
 operate the Service, at least during fiscal year 1947.  (This working
 arrangement was later superseded; eventually the opinion prevailed
 that CIG should take over the function as one of common concern.)
 On May 31 the Central Planning Staff was directed to make an in-
 formal survey of the intelligence available in the United States from
 colleges, foundations, libraries, individuals, business concerns, and
 other non-government sources.  On June 4 it received instructions to
 study explicitly the exploitation of American businesses with connec-
 tions abroad.  On June 6 it was told to look into the problems of
 psychological warfare.  And on June 7 it was called upon to make
 an interim survey of the adequacy of intelligence facilities related to
 the national security.
 The Central Planning Staff set for itself on the one hand the tre-
 mendous chore of elaborating a "complete framework of a system of
 interdepartmental intelligence coordination" to be contained in a series
 of studies for the DCI.  Subjects would include the "essential ele-
 ments of information" in a national system and the coordination of
 counterintelligence with security, of intelligence research with collec-
 tion of information, etc., by means of a coordinating board, a scien-
 tific committee, and other interagency committees on military, eco-
 nomic, political, and geographical matters.  At the other extreme it
 made an office space survey of the Central Reports Staff, allotting 90
 sq. ft. per person to it.
 The Defense Project
 In the meantime a substantive interdepartmental project was being
 organized.  Colonel J. R. Lovell of the Military Intelligence Service
 proposed on March 4 a plan for producing "the highest possible quality
 of intelligence on the USSR in the shortest possible time."  The in-
 telligence services of the Army, Navy, Air Forces, and State Depart-
 ment should have equal representation on the planning and working
 committees of this endeavor, soon to be known as the Defense Project.
 It should be subject to CIG coordination.  Admiral Souers accepted
 the offer at once.
 A Planning Committee drew up a proposal which on May 9 was
 incorporated into a CIG directive unanimously approved by the .IAB.

 The Planning Committee should choose its own chairman and secre-
 tary.                                  A coordinator from CIG should meet with the committee when
 appropriate; in case of disagreement within the committee he would
 submit the question to the DCI for decision.  This DCI responsibility,
 however, was more fearsome in prospect than in fact.  It would be
 some time before there could be any great decisions possible.  The
 evidence had first to be accumulated.
 It was the Working Committee, under the chairmanship of the sec-
 retary of the Planning Committee, with the CIG coordinator acting
 in advisory capacity, that had the first and most important job. It
 was to compile a veritable encyclopedia of "all types of factual strategic
 intelligence on the USSR." From this Strategic Intelligence Digest
 the member agencies would individually prepare Strategic Intelligence
 Estimates as required to meet their own needs or when requested by
 the DCI. Whenever "the national interest" required it, the CIG too
 could prepare estimates from the Strategic Intelligence Digest.  But
 there was no attempt to establish here a single national intelligence
 estimate which should govern the thinking of all agencies concerned.
 The CIG Central Reports Staff was still too small to undertake this
 extraordinary project, but it would not have been assigned it anyway.
 The plan originated in the Military Intelligence Service.  Its military
 advocates looked to CIG for a coordinator and for editorial assistance
 on the Working Committee, but they considered it primarily their
 own affair.  CIG had still to establish its right to means oil its own for
 procuring and processing the raw materials of intelligence.  Its cen-
 tral facilities had yet to become so useful to the departments that their
 intelligence officers would rely on it for services of common concern.
 The first task of the Working Committee was to review the papers
 of the Joint Intelligence Staff on the Soviet Union.  This took a couple
 of months. By June 4, however, an outline had been made and alloca-
 tions of the work planned.  The use of task forces, interdepartmental
 committees, was rejected on grounds of security; an agency's files
 would have to be opened to persons not under its control.  Instead,
 the work was assigned by subject to particular agencies, sometimes
 illogically.  For example, the Military Intelligence Service was charged
 at first with preparing certain economic and political data. Later
 the plan was revised so that the greater portion of the political
 material was allotted to the State Department.
 Colonel Lovell's expectations were not met; the project could not be
 finished by September. It was far from complete in December when

 work was stopped pending the decision of an interdepartmental com-
 mittee on a program of National Intelligence Surveys to take the place
 of the Joint Army-Navy Intelligence Studies.  This program changed
 CIG's attitude toward the Defense Project; it was no longer merely
 a question of coordination.  Though the most important, this Digest
 would be only one of several surveys to be produced by CIG/CIA.
 When resumed in April 1947, the project was still an interdepartmental
 activity, but it was no longer centered in the Pentagon as a major
 interest of the Military Intelligence Service.  The official date of pub-
 lication for the Strategic Intelligence Digest was March 1, 1948, but
 it was nearer the beginning of 1949 before all three bulky volumes
 were complete.
 Reports and Estimates
 By direction of the National Intelligence Authority on February
 8, a Central Reports Staff was to assist the Director in correlating and
 evaluating intelligence related to the national security and in dis-
 seminating within the government the resultant "strategic and national
 policy intelligence." Admiral Souers followed the directive with an
 administrative order dated March 4, though the Staff had already gone
 to work during February and had produced the first Daily Summary
 for the President.  There were in what was then called the Current
 Section seventeen persons seconded from the Departments of State,
 War, and the Navy.  They were established in the Pentagon under
 L. L. Montague, with the expectation that they would be joined
 shortly by other persons assigned from the departments to form an
 Estimates Section or Branch.
 The purpose from the start was to have the CIG take over the major
 function of producing the strategic estimates for the formulation of
 national policy, as Donovan had proposed.  But it was not yet de-
 cided that CIG should have a division comparable to the old OSS
 Research and Analysis Branch.  There was doubt that it ought to en-
 gage in initial research.  Many believed that it would do well to remain
 a small and compact body which should receive from the several
 departmental agencies the materials of intelligence and produce from
 them the "strategic and national policy intelligence" for the policy
 makers. The Department of State was still uncertain whether it
 should continue its own Office of Research and Intelligence as Mc-
 Cormack had expected to have it when he hoped to retain there the
 function of making intelligence estimates for the policy makers.

 Now on March 4 Admiral Souers' administrative order, prepared
 by Montague, elaborated the organization and functions of the Central
 Reports Staff.  There was in this administrative order a provision
 embodying ideas which are still of interest for the production of na-
 tional intelligence estimates.  As Montague wished to have the Staff
 constructed at that time, there should be four Assistants delegated to
 him, as Chief, by the permanent members of the IAB.  Their distinc-
 tion from other persons furnished by the departments for the Staff
 was to be that they should not be responsible to the DCI but to their
 parent agencies, although serving full time with the Staff.  The pur-
 pose was to have the Assistants represent in the Staff the interests of
 their respective departments and also to represent the Central Reports
 Staff in its relations with those agencies.  Montague had acquired
 these ideas from his experiences as representative of the Army on the
 Senior Team of the Joint Intelligence Staff.
 The Assistants would aid in directing the work of the Staff, review
 all its reports and estimates, make recommendations on the dissemina-
 tion of them, reconcile conflicting departmental estimates when pos-
 sible, and otherwise formulate dissents for their principals on the IAB.
 Thus Sowers and Montague hoped to establish a panel of intelligence
 experts drawn from the departments who would continue to under-
 stand and represent the interests of those departments but at the same
 time through their continuous work in the Reports Staff would be-
 come experts too in the business of central intelligence and the pro-
 duction of national estimates.
 The benefits to accrue from the continuity and momentum which
 might be gained from such an estimating board were left unknown.
 The ideas were put on paper but were not tested.  Difficulties in
 obtaining personnel and in meeting other more pressing demands in
 the new central intelligence organization prevented the establishment
 of such a board.
 Within a month of its formal activation, the Central Reports Staff
 entered another phase of its development.  Montague proposed on
 April 1 a revision of the administrative order to make possible two
 things.  First, experience with the allotment of personnel by the De-
 partments of State, War, and the Navy demonstrated that there should
 be more flexibility within the proportions agreed among the depart-
 ments. The right persons for particular positions were not to be had
 according to any predetermined ratio.  The difficulty grew worse with
 the necessity of apportioning within each grade.  Navy captains, Army

 colonels, and civilian "P-8's" were not equally available in number or
 competence.  The principle of proportion could be maintained, but
 deviations should be permitted so long as there was no substantial
 change in the budgetary obligations of the departments.
 We should note at this point the predicament of CIG as a whole
 with respect to personnel.  The departments had been directed by
 the President to assign personnel to CIG.  To make the general state-
 ment that they minimized the obligation to supply able persons, as
 soon as possible, is doubtless to do injustice in some cases, perhaps
 many. A reading of correspondence on this matter from the spring
 of 1946, however, and conversations with some who were present and
 responsible for recruitment at the time, lead to the conclusion that
 there were many recommendations for office in CIG that were not bona
 fide nominations.  Some nominees were not really available because
 they were headed toward more important positions in their own serv-
 ices and could not remain long in CIG if they came at all.  Six months
 was often the limit.  Some appeared on the lists because they had
 become surplus-good fellows, but with no future in the service to
 which they had given so much of their lives. The name of the best
 man available was often left off because he was wanted where he was.
 It was neither easy nor desirable to select the personnel of the new
 CIG staffs, branches, and sections from such lists. Admiral Souers
 and his successor, General Vandenberg, were not able to do much
 about solving this problem so long as they were obliged to request
 referrals from the departments and hope for the best. Whether or
 not they minimized their responsibility, the departments failed to pro-
 vide adequate personnel for CIG.  Why General Vandenberg sought
 an independent budget and the right to hire and fire his own per-
 sonnel is clear.
 The second change in the Central Reports Staff was intended to pro-
 vide it with area specialists as it set up its Estimates Branch.  The
 Estimates Branch itself was not to have geographical segments, but the
 plan was to have five such sections supporting it-Western Europe-
 Africa, Eastern Europe-USSR, Middle East-India, Far East-Pacific,
 and Western Hemisphere.  The staff of each section would be appor-
 tioned by grade and among the departments.
 The Central Planning Staff objected to so early a rewrite of the
 administrative order to effect these changes and formally disapproved
 the plan.  There ensued a test of strength between the two Staffs
 which Central Planning lost.  It was discharged from further con-

 sideration of the proposal, and the principle was established that the
 chiefs of the component parts of CIG should be responsible for the
 organization and administration of their respective domains as they
 deemed fit.
 Espionage and Counterespionage
 The remnants of the clandestine parts of OSS were being held in
 a Strategic Services Unit in the War Department.  By Executive Order
 9621 of September 20, 1945, the Secretary of War was to discontinue
 any of its activities whenever he deemed this compatib:!e with the
 national interest and was to wind up all affairs related thereto. The
 policy under this Order was to maintain those intelligence functions
 which would be required permanently in peacetime, such as espionage
 and counterintelligence, and to release personnel from other activities,
 such as sabotage and black propaganda, for which no peacetime need
 was seen and close them out.  General John Magruder, the SSU chief,
 kept at this task of liquidation through the fall of 1945 and into Janu-
 ary, until the number of military and civilian personnel had fallen
 from over 9,000 to nearly 3,000.
 On January 29, 1946, the Secretary of War directed that the Strategic
 Services Unit should be closed by June 30.  The SSU records, along
 with those of the OSS, transferred to the Office of the Secretary of
 War by the Executive Order, were "placed under the operational
 control of the Director of Central Intelligence." Title to these records
 remained to be settled later.
 General Magruder strove to make clear that the assets of the Strategic
 Services Unit were indispensable for the procurement of intelligence in
 peacetime.  In a memorandum of January 15 he detailed the irrepar-
 able loss that abandonment of the Unit's properties, plans, and person-
 nel would entail.  Its Secret Intelligence Branch, he said, had stations
 in seven countries through the Near East and four in North Africa
 that were already converted to peacetime work.  There were con-
 tinuing activities with the military commands in Germany, Austria,
 China, and Southeast Asia.10 Plans were being completed for opera-
 tions in the Far East, and studies were in progress elsewhere.  Se-
 lected persons from the old covert action branches had been trans-
 ferred into the Secret Intelligence Branch to be ready for the future.
 '? The military commands in Southeast Asia actually terminated on V-J Day.
 One or two SSU men were left in the area.

 The Counterintelligence Branch, X-2, had some 400,000 dossiers on
 individuals.  It was still at work against the operations of foreign in-
 telligence services and secret organizations.  This work was done in
 close liaison with other American agencies, and in military areas in
 cooperation with the Counter Intelligence Corps of the Army.. The
 two Branches were supported by components for communications
 (though reduced), technical services, special funds, a training pro-
 gram, and other elements of the old OSS still in operation.
 As the new Central Intelligence Group got under way, General
 Magruder sent a memorandum to the Secretary of War on February
 4, 1948, answering criticisms of the SSU and recommending immedi-
 ate action by the National Intelligence Authority to appraise its value.
 Again on February 14 he urged that the Authority place the Unit under
 the Director of Central Intelligence and set a date for transferring
 all its assets.  Had this been the only idea abroad in Washington,
 there should have been no further delay.  But there was more than
 one opinion on the matter.
 At a meeting held in the War Department on February 8, repre-
 sentatives of the intelligence services were still discussing which facili-
 ties and functions of the SSU should be kept, and which of these should
 be operated by CIG and which by the departments or other existing
 agencies. There was question whether the whole SSU belonged at
 the center of the national intelligence system.  There was strong
 doubt that CIG should have exclusive collection of foreign intelligence
 by clandestine means, as Magruder was advocating.  It was agreed
 in this meeting that "an authoritative group" should make a study and
 that prompt decisions should be reached.  On February 19, 1946,
 therefore, Admiral Souers, with the concurrence of the IAB, estab-
 lished an interdepartmental committee to study the SSU problem.
 The interdepartmental committee, with Colonel Fortier as chairman,
 met continuously until March 13.  It listened to General Magruder
 and his principal subordinates, inspected files, obtained opinions on
 the value of the Unit from agencies which used its product, and heard
 testimony from ranking officers with OSS service overseas.  The mem-
 bers made individual studies of the SSU branches and divisions.
 The Fortier Committee heard that the bulk of the information for
 intelligence purposes came from friendly governments.       A large
 amount of material, such as commercial and other economic statistics,
 was obtained from activities other than secret collection.   This testi-
 mony supported the opinion that the SSU should not be taken over

 whole by CIG.  Another reservation frequently expressed in the in-
 vestigation was that the SSU personnel had not been adequately
 screened, especially in the light of changes from wartime conditions
 and the new threat from the East.
 The conclusions of the Committee were nevertheless in favor of
 saving the SSU structure.  It was a "going concern" for operations in
 the field.  It should be "properly and closely supervised, pruned and
 rebuilt," and placed under the CIG.  The Committee proposed that
 the Secretary of State, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
 gation, and the Director of Central Intelligence should reconsider
 the existing division of "analogous functions" on a geographic basis-
 the FBI doing in the western hemisphere what SSU was doing in the
 eastern.
 The Committee suggested that the SSU as subordinated to CIG
 should concentrate on the current activities of the Soviet Union and
 its Satellites. Plans should be made to penetrate key institutions in
 support of possible U.S. military operations. Liaison with the in-
 telligence agencies of other countries should be developed for the
 same p.....
 ose
 Liquidation should continue substantially as proposed by General
 Magruder.  But at the same time such personnel and facilities as the
 DCI wished to have should be transferred to CIG on terms of new
 employment.  Until CIG should have an independent budget and
 funds of its own, the War Department should continue to supply the
 amounts needed.
 The Fortier Committee also proposed that there should be closer
 coordination of the SSU with research and analysis activities.  The
 OSS Research and Analysis Branch, which had been transferred to
 the State Department, was "closely geared to the secret intelligence
 branches as their chief customer and their chief guide" in the selec-
 tion of sources and the evaluation of intelligence.  Their files were
 interrelated, and their activities interwoven.
 Following the report of the Fortier Committee and agreement be-
 tween Admiral Sowers and Secretary of War Patterson, the National
 Intelligence Authority issued a directive on April 2, 19413, that the
 DCI take over the administration of the SSU pending final liquidation,
 which would be delayed another fiscal year, through June 1947.  The

 DCI (represented by his Acting Chief of Operational Services, Colonel
 Fortier) would determine which funds, personnel, and facilities of
 the Unit were required in CIG.  Secretary Patterson reserved the right
 to determine what portion of the funds, personnel, and facilities could
 be made available.
 These provisions, rather than a simple executive order, were :legally
 necessary to avoid shifting the SSU en masse from the War Depart-
 ment to CIG, in the way the OSS Research and Analysis Branch had
 been placed in State. It was necessary in dealing with personnel to
 bring to an end the appointment of everybody in SSU and give new
 appointments to those who were wanted in CIG.  Otherwise seniori-
 ties, preference for veterans, and the whole intricate mechanism for
 Civil Service reductions in force would have prevented a satisfactory
 screening of personnel for security and suitability for peacetime clan-
 destine activities.
 The plans, records, and properties of the Unit were to be handled
 differently.  There were funds, such as rupees in India, that were not
 to be turned back to the Treasury but retained like a stockpile for
 future use.       There were physical properties which could be trans-
 ferred to other agencies but which should be available first to CIG.
 The equipment, techniques, codes, and other facilities of communica-
 tion came through intact.  The legal question of title-the Economy
 Act of 1933 prevented the transfer of property without reimburse-
 ment-was bypassed in assigning control and use of the assets to GIG.
 Later, the National Security Act of 1947 would transfer the "personnel,
 property, and records" of CIG to the Central Intelligence Agency.
 Oversight
 After accepting Admiral Souers' program for the SSU on April 2,
 1946, the National Intelligence Authority did not meet again formally
 until July 17, when it conferred with General Vandenberg about his
 reorganization of the CIG.  It was content to rely upon the Intelligence
 Advisory Board and Admiral Souers, personal choice of President: Tru-
 man, to establish and activate the new central intelligence organization
 as a "cooperative interdepartmental activity."
 The IAB too held but occasional and desultory meetings. It dis-
 cussed on February 4 the proposed policies and procedures governing
 the CIG but made no important comment.  On March 26 the plan for
 liquidating the SSU interested but did not excite it.  The men who
 composed it had made their decisions elsewhere.  This session did

 touch upon one pregnant problem.  General Vandenberg, representing
 the Army, remarked that applications were coming in from persons who
 wished to be secret agents abroad. Admiral Souers preferred not to
 confuse the existing operations of the SSU with the permanent clan-
 destine program.  Until the latter was established, therefore, he
 thought the individual agencies should continue their own operations.
 He agreed with Vandenberg, however, that eventually "all such op-
 erations should be under a single directing head." Here was one
 opinion giving promise of more lively meetings of the IAB.
 At the third IAB meeting, on April 8 with Kingman Douglass in
 the chair as Acting DCI, Alfred McCormack reported that the Bureau
 of the Budget had reduced the amount requested by the Secretary of
 State for intelligence activity in 1947 and there was uncertainty in
 the Department whether to continue its work in research and analysis.
 Admiral Inglis for the Navy and General Vandenberg for the Army both
 favored transferring the function from the Department to CIG if the
 Department did not wish to retain it.  Here was another promise of
 things to come.  Some two weeks later, as Secretary Byrnes issued an
 order dispersing State's intelligence research among its geographical
 divisions, McCormack resigned, and within four months there was
 an Office of Research and Evaluation in CIG.
 The last meeting of the IAB before the end of Admiral Souers'
 tenure came on May 9.  There was discussion of the request from
 General Vandenberg that State take over the Foreign Broadcast In-
 telligence Service, and the matter was referred, as we noted above,
 to the Central Planning Staff.  The IAB listened to the plan for
 the Defense Project but made no suggestions worth mention.  Again,
 the intelligence officers present had done their deciding elsewhere.
 Then they considered methods of clearing personnel for duty with
 CIG.  The suggestion of Admiral Inglis that there should be an in-
 terdepartmental screening committee for the purpose (lid not meet
 approval, and each department was held responsible for clearing
 the persons it assigned to CIG.  The CIG security officer would have
 the right of review, and final decision would rest with the DCI.  (This
 method did not prove satisfactory; the directive was :rescinded on
 October 4, 1946, and CIG undertook full responsibility for clearing
 its personnel.)
 There was one more meeting of the Intelligence Advisory Board
 with Admiral Souers in the chair as General Vandenberg became
 Director of Central Intelligence on June 10, 1946.  Souers expressed

 his appreciation of the unstinted cooperation he had received. He
 took "great satisfaction" in turning his duties over to General Vanden-
 berg.  As he reminisced in 1952, there was no doubt in his mind that
 he did.  He had been reluctant to take the office. He had sought
 others for it in. his place at the start.  He had recommended a suc-
 cessor for his public appeal and personal attributes.
 The first Director of Central Intelligence left a progress report,
 dated June 7, 1946, to summarize his administration and point to
 the immediate needs of his successor.  Responsible officers in the
 departments had cooperated wholeheartedly in meeting his requests
 for personnel, he said, but the process had been slow because of
 demobilization in the armed forces and CIG's very specific require-
 ments.  He had given priority to the Central Planning Staff as a
 necessary "prelude to accomplishment." Concentration now ,should
 be upon the Central Reports Staff.
 The primary CIG function was to prepare and distribute "definitive
 estimates" on the capabilities and intentions of foreign countries.
 Since it required the best qualified personnel, it had been slow in
 filling the complement of the Reports Staff.  This had delayed too
 the solution of the relationship to be established with the departments,
 the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee, the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff, and other agencies in regard to the production of such "national
 policy intelligence." Listing the interdepartmental problems which
 the Central Planning Staff had undertaken to solve or study, Souers
 stressed in particular the CIG function of supporting the budgets
 for departmental intelligence.  "Coordinated representation to the
 Bureau of the Budget and the Congress," he said, promised to be
 "one of the more effective means for guarding against arbitrary de-
 pletion of intelligence sources at the expense of national security."
 It was an interesting suggestion, leading far into the future of the
 national intelligence system.  But it was not one to have smooth
 sailing.
 The final paragraphs of Admiral Souers' progress report came to
 vigorous conclusions for benefit of General Vandenberg.  CIE's re-
 lationship with the National Intelligence Authority and the Intelli-
 gence Advisory Board was sound.  But CIG was suffering from the
 departments' inability to give it the personnel and facilities it must
 have.  It could recruit no personnel from civilian life. Without
 enabling legislation, it could make no contracts for essential services.
 It was now ready to monitor foreign broadcasts, collect foreign iritelli-

 Ill Told Tales
 SPION VOOR NATO.  By Evert Reydon.  (Amsterdam: Polak & van
 Gennep.  1967.  330 pp.  f8.50.)
 Evert Reydon, an engineering officer in the Dutch merchant marine,
 was recruited by the Dutch Foreign Intelligence Service in 1957.
 From then until 1961 the Dutch Service, in conjunction with MI-6,
 used him primarily as an observation and Elint collection agent in
 Soviet ports at which his ship called.  In July 1961 he and a merchant
 marine colleague were sent as legal travelers by automobile on an
 observation mission to the USSR.  As they attempted to leave the
 country, on 20 August, they were arrested by the KGB.  In October
 they were tried, found guilty of espionage for NATO, and sentenced
 to 13 years in prison.  In November 1963, after considerable behind-
 the-scenes negotiations, they were released and returned to The Nether-
 lands.  Reydon's colleague, who had stood up nobly during his trial,
 telling the court he was proud of his services to his country and the
 West-something Reydon did not do-suffered a nervous breakdown
 soon after his return and has been in a Dutch mental institution ever
 since. Reydon found on his return that Dutch shipping companies,
 most of which do business with the Bloc, would not rehire him.  With
 official help he bought a gas station but failed to make a go of it; he
 was a taxi driver at the time he wrote this purported autobiography.
 The publication of the book in May 1967 created quite a stir in the
 Dutch press and was even noted by the Soviets in their domestic broad-
 casts.  This was understandable; Reydon was the first Dutchman to
 have written about his espionage exploits for his country and her
 allies since World War II.  But except for recounting the disclosures
 made at his Moscow trial, he offers the reader a story with little rela-
 tion to his actual activities.  The following caveat, which, in small
 print on the inside of the face plate, is calculated to be missed by most
 readers, betrays the real tone of the book: "All the situations and most
 of the persons described in this book live only in the imagination of the
 writer, and hopefully will live only in the imagination of the reader."
 The book is divided into three sections.  The first details Reydon's
 youth, his entering the Dutch merchant marine, and his recruitment

 the second tells of purported espionage activities, primarily for the
 British, in the Middle East, where he claims he was employed under
 a BOAC cover; and the third covers his training, dispatch, f=ancied ex-
 ploits, capture, interrogation, trial, and imprisonment in the USSR.
 He claims he dealt with George Blake in the Middle East and met
 Gary Powers, Greville Wynne, and others in his Soviet prison.  The
 book is filled with his adventures with women of various no.tionalities,
 including an American college girl in the Middle East.
 Facts are lost in fantasy, with great self-damage to the author, for
 he had served his country and the West well.  By making himself
 a junior James Bond he may have boosted the sale of his book, but
 this cheap, flamboyant story can only degrade his real contribution.
 THE BROKEN SEAL: The Story of "Operation Magic" and the Pearl
 Harbor Disaster.  By Ladislas Farago. (New York: Random House.
 1967.  439 pp.  $6.95.)
 It was perhaps inevitable that Ladislas Farago, veteran ;;ginner of
 espionage and other yarns, would sooner or later turn his attention to
 Pearl Harbor.  In The Broken Seal he has brought forth an untidy
 compilation covering the whole interbellum period, much of it ir-
 relevant to the problem of the Pearl disaster, all of it put together with
 approximately the care and perception we have come to expect in a
 routine espionage potboiler.
 The book is based on extensive research, however, and it claims a
 big purpose-to answer the question "Since we possessed this fantastic
 source of intelligence [the Magics] . . . why did we fail to anticipate
 the blow?" It had seemed unlikely that anyone would try to improve
 on Roberta Wohlstetter's answers to this question (in Pearl Harbor:
 Warning and Decision; 1962).  Evidently Farago was emboldened to
 try by the knowledge that there were several stockpiles of source ma-
 terial that had not been exploited.  These new materials made his
 book, but they also unmade it; they seduced him into admitting stories

 unrelated or only vaguely related to his stated object, to the point
 where he seems to have forgotten that object.  The Broken Seal is
 essentially not the analysis he promises but a long, shallow narrative;
 it makes several additions to the fund of information on the intelli-
 gence background of Pearl Harbor, but does so without improving
 our understanding of the surprise.
 Farago's biggest such addition-a real eyebrow-raiser-is his story
 of how the Japanese in the spring of 1941 came to suspect that we
 were reading their diplomatic traffic.  He reports that Under Sec-
 retary of State Sumner Welles, in attempting to convince the Soviet
 ambassador that the Germans were going to attack the USSR, showed
 him telegrams to this effect which the Japanese ambassador in Berlin
 had sent. This revelation then leaked to the Germans through an
 agent of theirs in the Soviet embassy in Washington, whence it passed
 to Berlin and on to Tokyo.
 Japanese suspicions of the safety of their cipher systems appeared in
 messages that we read.  The ciphers remained unchanged, but the
 Magic custodians, not knowing how the leak had happened, reacted
 with their near-boycott of the White House, where a couple of acci-
 dental mishandlings of Magics had occurred. The Magic service to the
 White House was not resumed until months had passed, and then
 only at the President's insistence.
 What Farago has contributed here is not simply an explanation of
 the military men's caution (which has been explained-with caustic
 comment-in practically every Pearl Harbor account), but a revelation
 that the leak was not where their suspicions pointed.  This part of the
 story does not lack for detail, but it does for documentation; it is at-
 tributed to anonymous sources.
 Another major finding of the author's is that the Japanese decision
 to attack Hawaii was influenced by indiscreet revelations of U.S. mili-
 tary information by Postmaster General Walker, the President's repre-
 sentative in the "John Doe" negotiations that were conducted in 1941
 outside regular diplomatic channels.  Like most of Farago's theses,
 however, this one loses something in the presentation-and if it is an
 intelligence story it is a story about Japanese intelligence, not U.S.
 intelligence that could have warned us.
 The most persistent of Farago's theses is the failure of the Magic
 producers and their customers to recognize the warning value in-
 herent in the traffic of the Japanese espionage agents in Hawaii.  But
 his chief example of this supposed blundering is the message available

 on December 6 that revealed a proposed shore-to-ship communication
 system so clumsy as to invite the belief that whatever it was the Japs
 had afoot in Hawaii, it was surely frivolous.  His explanation of the
 G-2 and ONI failure to appreciate the importance of these messages
 is that because they bore diplomatic addresses and signatures, their
 military significance was not evident.  Here Farago has added em-
 phasis, but not persuasiveness, to the testimony on this point in the
 Pearl Harbor hearings.
 One story clearly pertinent to Farago's announced purpose con-
 cerns the inability of G-2's Colonel Bratton to get an audience for the
 implications of the Japanese code-destruction message that reached
 the Washington embassy December 3.  This failure the author at-
 tributes to Bratton's misfortune in having stirred up the High Com-
 mand during the previous week with his conviction that the Japa-
 nese would open the war on the weekend of November 29.30.  What
 Farago contributes in this case is new appreciation of old information-
 and evidently some overplaying.
 Because he indicates that his sources included participants in the
 Pearl Harbor cryptologic events, the reader's expectations rise when
 he begins his chapter on "How the Japanese Fleet Was `Last"' by our
 interceptors before and during its voyage to Hawaii.  But this account
 is half-hearted-short and unsatisfying-and obviously garbled (for
 example, what presents itself to Farago's mind as radio camouflage looks
 like no more than ordinary radio security).  This reader, led to ex-
 pect an account of successful communications deception, was surprised
 to turn the page and learn that our interceptors realized, and reported,
 that they had lost the target fleet. That being the case, the loss was
 in itself an important piece of intelligence, which fact Farago does not
 appear to notice.
 He implies that the Purple cryptosystem may have been used for
 deception, but later we find that the only deception in these communi-
 cations that he is really prepared to accept is Tokyo's deception of its
 ambassadors in Washington.  This seems a correct analysis-but we
 have been led up and down several confusing layers of dissimulation
 to arrive at a point long recognized as absolutely basic to the whole
 story of the disaster: Nomura and Kurusu were being told as little
 as possible; their instructions from Tokyo could never have revealed
 to us where the blow would fall.
 Farago's conclusion on the question whether a "winds code execute"
 message was ever intercepted is simply that this remains an unsolved

 puzzle.  But he found, in the files seized by the FBI at the Honolulu
 consulate, a decrypted telegram whose text ("Relations strained be-
 tween Japan and the United States and Britain") is similar to the mean-
 ings assigned to two of the looked-for broadcast phrases.  This sug-
 gests that Tokyo sent telegrams in lieu of a broadcast that might be
 missed by some outposts-in other words, that the winds code scheme
 was left unused, presumably because it was never more than a pre-
 caution against the closing of the commercial radio circuits, and these
 remained open.  But Farago, overlooking this plausible but undra-
 matic conclusion, chooses to view the telegram as evidence support-
 ing in some measure those who contended that there was an execute
 broadcast message.
 One of The Broken Seal's main contributions, and it is no mean
 one, is its wealth of background on the Japanese preparations for war,
 especially their intelligence preparations-and especially Yamamoto's
 long-shot effort to sell his plan to attack Hawaii.  This story, how-
 ever, scarcely bears on the subject of our intelligence-unless Farago
 means to suggest that if we had had a Richard Sorge in Tokyo we
 might have learned these secrets, which were of course held within
 a very small circle.
 In dealing with the history of cryptologic operations Farago ac-
 quired just enough information, and possessed just enough technical
 knowledge, to entangle himself in a series of stories which are un-
 satisfying at best (e.g., the account of the "loss" of the Japanese! fleet)
 and badly misleading at worst.  Some of his blunders require no
 special knowledge to detect, as when he labels as "Magic's finest
 hour" the report by a Navy cryptologist (August 1941) that Japan
 was not going to attack Russia but instead would make her major move
 to the south.  Other errors are of a kind visible only to participants
 in the cryptologic events of the time, but these are massive ones--long
 accounts of cryptanalytic operations which Farago renders (a good
 word, renders) in such a way as to make them only barely recognizable
 to actual participants in the events, some of whom were interviewed
 for the purpose of this review.  Perhaps the key to Farago the cryp-
 tologist is his repeated references to "encoded cipher." The crypto-
 system he refers to in each case is enciphered code-but there's quite
 a difference.  Even a layman, if he stops to think, will see that if the
 Japanese had communicated by anything so cumbersome as encoded
 cipher (as Farago conceives it), Admiral Nagumo might still be lurk-

 ing in the western Pacific waiting for the communicators to finish de-
 crypting his orders to sail against Pearl.
 This complaint is no mere technicality; Farago's blundering signals
 a warning that as cryptologic and intelligence history The Broken Seal
 is altogether unreliable because the author went far beyond his depth.
 For the general reader the cryptologic matters pertinent to Farago's
 stated theme could be treated adequately at a completely nontechnical
 level; that he elected to do otherwise must be attributed to a belief
 that any reference to cryptology, however obscure or confused, lends
 a certain aura of mystery that can only further the sale of books.
 This is the most research-oriented of Farago's opuses, but the
 practiced spinner of popular spy stories still comes through.  We
 do not read far before we encounter the inevitable Nip agent
 peering quizzically through thick-lens spectacles, bowing, hissing, and
 emitting mysterious frozen smiles.  Even earlier comes that other
 stereotype, the U.S. diplomat wearing morning coat and affected man-
 nerisms.  Cryptanalysis, it seems, is the province of persons for whom
 there was no adequate one-word label until kook entered the language.
 On the attache circuit intelligence is obtained "by a judicious mixing
 of sensitive topics and powerful cocktails." A fair sample of Farago's
 idea of cryptologic "in" lingo is "the message that emerged from the
 crypt."  In his sentence "the strain became arrant" (during those
 months of brain-breaking work on the Purple solution) we detect
 the presence of Roget close by the author's side.
 But his offenses are against more than fact and style.  His docu-
 mentation, though lengthy, is generalized and slippery, with some key
 passages left undocumented (evidently not because of any desire to
 shun attribution to anonymous informants, for there are several in-
 stances of this). Another form of carelessness, constantly repeated, is
 the burial of significant narrative points in footnotes-which leaves us
 uncertain as to the author's view of their significance. The most setious
 violation of good practice, however, is the use of selective hindsight;
 the whole narrative, so far as it bears on the announced subject, focuses
 on Hawaii and on the pieces of intelligence that could have alerted
 us, to the exclusion of the pieces that drew attention elsewhere.
 Avoidance of this way of reading history was the essence of Mrs.
 Wohlstetter's study; Farago realized he was setting an easier dis-
 cipline for himself, but his awareness does not save him.
 This much derogation of a veteran author's big opus has to have
 a point, and it is this. The flaws in his treatment of his material are

 no less than tragic; for if a major addition to the Pearl Harbor litera-
 ture is possible at this time, Farago's material should have produced
 such an addition.  As a piece of research The Broken Seal is monu-
 mental.  Earlier authors must be devastatingly embarrassed at the
 amount of unused material he turned up in that out-of-the-way deposi-
 tory, the Library of Congress, which has harbored a stockpile of micro-
 filmed Japanese Foreign Office documents for now these two decades.
 His other documentary sources-in Hawaii, Japan, even Germany-
 also contain numerous surprises; equally surprising is the amount
 of hitherto obscure material he found in published sources.  Farago
 has given us all a lesson in Pearl Harbor bibliography.
 What may be only a minor tragedy for scholarship generally is a
 more serious one for the intelligence community, which must now sit
 back and watch a new spate of Pearl Harbor studies come out, touched
 off by Farago's discoveries.  Some of these will be improvements,
 where they mine Farago's documentary sources carefully and stick
 to the rules of the game.  But it is likely that all of them will be
 dependent on The Broken Seal itself for the long stretches of inside
 information Farago got from private sources; thus they will perpetuate
 and magnify his extensive distortions and errors.  It is becoming in-
 creasingly clear that if we want a straight story going beyond Mrs.
 Wohlstetter's-and that is surely a reasonable want-it is going to
 have to be produced by intelligence professionals.  This is true
 not only because of the unlikelihood of getting an adequate "outside"
 study but also because a really complete study involves information
 still classified.  Much of it does not even exist on paper; it consists of
 the recollections of cryptanalysts, translators, and other participants
 in the intelligence events.
 This is not the place to write a prospectus for such a study, but a
 few descriptive or prescriptive points may be suggested. For one, the
 participants' recollections, wanted for their answers to the present-
 day intelligence officer's questions, happen also to make the story
 several times as interesting as anything written on Pearl Harbor to
 date.  For another, the coverage of events before, say, 1939 need be
 of only the briefest and most prefatory character, if only to avoid
 burying the story under its own weight as Farago tends to do.  For
 a third, although only the cryptanalysts can explain some of the ins
 and outs of the intelligence events, it does not have to be, and should
 not be, a heavily technical story.

 ADVENTURE IN DIPLOMACY.  By Kenneth Pendar.  (London:
 Cassell.  1966. 382 pp. 42/-.)
 Early in 1941, an agreement was negotiated between Robert Murphy
 for the United States and General Weygand for the Vichy government.
 Under its terms we undertook to ship certain specified commodities
 for the benefit of the civilian population in French North Africa, and
 the French agreed to accept American observers to see that the supplies
 were used for the designated purposes and not reexported.  ]Pendar
 was one of the U.S. "control officers," and this book stems from his
 sojourn in Morocco and Algeria from June 1941 to July 1943.
 The assignment provided both an opportunity and a cover for travel
 throughout the area and the collection of information and impressions
 concerning the attitudes of French and Arabs and the degree of Ger-
 man influence.  Increasingly, it came to involve the clandestine gather-
 ing of military information in preparation for the Allied landings in
 November 1942.
 The account of these activities, however, takes up only the first
 hundred or so pages of this book.  It is a good picture of the field of
 play: the heritage of Lyautey, the nature of the French protectorate
 and the Frenchmen who served it, the stresses of conflicting loyalties
 to which French officers were subjected, the characteristics of the
 Moroccans and Algerians themselves.  Pendar, who before long was
 appointed vice-consul at Marrakesh, came to be a good friend of the
 legendary El Glaoui.  But there is not very much specific detail about
 the strictly intelligence aspects of the work of Pendar and his col-
 leagues.
 This is by design, not accident, as is shown by the book's subtitle,
 The Emergence of General de Gaulle in North Africa.  The last hun-
 dred pages of text, and thirty-four appendices which run to another
 hundred-odd pages, are largely given over to a persuasive exposition
 of Pendar's thesis that de Gaulle was from the start far more intent
 on securing his own political role in postwar France than in making
 a military contribution to the winning of the war.   Jean Monnet
 emerges as a subsidiary villain who, as a self-appointed adviser to
 General Giraud, effectively delivered that political innocent into de
 Gaull.e's power.

 In 1967 none of this is particularly novel. In fact, the publishing
 history of the book may at this stage be more interesting than its con-
 tent.  It was originally brought out in 1945 in a small U.S. edition.
 A larger edition was published in France in 1948.  Now comes the
 English edition, using the original text with only very minor changes
 and a fair number of footnote references, mostly to such later material
 as Murphy's own account of the same period in Diplomat among War-
 riors.  But about half of the documentary appendices are new since
 the first edition, as well as a Prologue and an Epilogue in which Pendar
 reiterates his disillusionment with de Gaulle. He can probably look
 for a more responsive readership now than in 1945.

 MY OWN RIVER KWAI.  By Pierre Boulle.  Translated from the
 French by Xan Fielding.  (New York: Vanguard Press.  1967.
 214 pp.  $5.95.)
 The outbreak of World War II found Pierre Boulle on a rubber
 plantation some 50 miles from Kuala Lumpur.  Other Frenchmen,
 as well as Danes, Britons, and Americans, were in Malaya as planta-
 tion managers and employees at the time.  Like Boulle, most of them
 tried to get into the war action in some form.  Some went into mili-
 tary organizations; a number were associated with British and Ameri-
 can quasi-military intelligence groups in the area.
 After reporting via Singapore to Indochina for mobilization, Boulle
 began a series of frustrations and hardships that lasted for over four
 years, two of them spent in prison.  His friends from Malaya were
 part of a group that identified with the Free French movement and
 so found themselves in opposition to the French colonial establish-
 ment and frequently treated as traitors.
 The story of Boulle's adventures in traveling to Indochina, then back
 to Singapore, then into Burma, and from there up into Yunnan in
 southern China makes up the early part of this book.  He then moved
 into northeastern Thailand and finally into Indochina where, after a
 horrendous trip via rivers and rapids, he fell into the hands of the
 Vichy-oriented French establishment.  He was condemned and spent
 two years in prisons, sometimes in solitary confinement and sometimes
 shackled in circumstances that clearly formed a basis for some of the

 fictional incidents related in his well-known "Bridge Over the River
 Kwai."
 There is not a great deal about intelligence in this book, but it does
 picture the process of gaining information from tribal groups in the
 Indochina, Chinese border, and Thai areas. The Westerner's exaspera-
 tion with the tribal social protocol through which he has to work, deal-
 ing with village head men, chance couriers, porters, and guides, is
 clearly reflected in the incidents of Boulle's journey. Withal, however,
 he tells the story without complaint and with some understated humor.
 It is interesting to remember, with respect to intelligence work, that of
 the previously mentioned plantation managers and experts there were
 a number who, trading on their experience with ethnic groups and
 knowledge of how to handle them, contributed a great deal to British
 and American intelligence activities in that part of the world through-
 out the years 1943-45.  This reviewer recalls in particular one man-
 ager who knew the Malaya countryside well from traversing most of
 it in his peacetime duties.  After the Japanese occupied the Southeast
 Asia peninsula down to Singapore, this man regularly flew on day-long
 trips, belly down in a B-24 bomber, scanning the roads and bridges
 to check on their state of maintenance and to spot vulnerabilities and
 other information needed at CBI and SEAC headquarters, as well as
 by British and American clandestine elements.
 Shortly after returning to Malaya at the end of the war, either
 through distaste for the problems of reconstruction in Malaya or be-
 cause there was at work in him the ferment of creative expression,
 Boulle took account of his assets, threw up all his Malayan plantation
 experience and future, and returned to France to begin a career as
 a writer of fiction. This particular book, he admits in an introduction,
 was undertaken out of some irritation at frequently being asked what
 background he had for writing The Bridge Over the River Kwai.
 While the setting of the book that became the famous motion picture
 was geographically well to the west of his own area and the incidents
 in it were based on prison experiences that were not his, still the river
 and jungle terrain of that part of Southeast Asia is sufficiently uniform
 and the true hardship conditions of his own confinement sufficiently
 similar to those that obtained in Thailand and Burma to give the
 novel authenticity.  If the author really needed justification, My Own
 River Kwai does the job.

 THE MAN FROM MOSCOW.  By Greville Wynne.  (London:
 Hutchinson.  1967.  222 pp.  $4.20.)
 When one writes of Greville Wynne, one must put first things first.
 The first thing is that Mr. Wynne, when confronted with a great chal-
 lenge and a grave threat not only to his livelihood but to life, responded
 with courage and intelligence.  Nothing he has said or done since
 meeting that challenge can detract from the honor due hint-not even
 this book.
 When reading it, I had to keep reminding myself of that first thing
 because, unfortunately, Wynne has not written a closely factual ac-
 count of his involvement in the Penkovskiy case, one which could have
 been the authentic statement of a man who was in his own way a hero
 of our time.  Instead he has chosen to record his fantasies of Greville
 Wynne as James Bond to a degree which largely vitiates the factual
 material his book includes,
 Wynne in reality had something in common with the seedy little
 men in Eric Ambler novels who suddenly find themselves thrust upon
 the stage of history in some dark scene of international intrigue.
 The fundamental difference between him and Ambler's antiheroes is
 that Wynne met the challenge and ultimately emerged from the dif-
 ficult situation with dignity and respect.  That story could have made
 a very moving book.  Instead, we have a novel about 008/ being set
 on the trail of Penkovskiy in 1955 and gradually circling closer and
 i.qoser to his target until the day-that London had foreseen from
 the beginning-when Penkovskiy turns to Wynne and confides to
 him not only his intentions to serve as a British spy, but his first photos
 Of classified Soviet documents.  Wynne depicts himself as a carefully
 selected and long-trained British undercover agent whose career in
 intelligence goes back to the beginning of the Second World War.
 The true Wynne, the indifferently successful salesman with a limited
 education and no serious experience in the kind of undertaking in
 which he found himself involved, is a much more sympathetic man
 and his role in the Penkovskiy operation much more deserving of our
 admiration.
 Wynne describes at length how he foiled the interrogators who
 pressed him for months to confess all the details he knew of the

 Penkovskiy case.  He also tells stories of involvement in other intel-
 ligence operations, information which he managed to conceal from
 the Soviets to the very end.  Unfortunately, neither as a record of
 what happened nor as a guide to defense against interrogation is
 Wynne's account very useful. There is not much point in going into
 the various absurdities of the story of his interrogation and imprison-
 ment as he relates it here.  In view of the arrest and confession of
 Penkovskiy and the evidence accumulated during the investigation
 prior to his arrest, Wynne's confessing to his own role with relatively
 little reticence is certainly understandable and would have made a
 more moving story than the months of clever repartee between him
 and his various Soviet adversaries in the Lubyanka.
 The same absence of fact irretrievably mars his account of the
 Penkovskiy operation.  I hope this book is not widely circulated
 among potential Soviet spies, or at least not believed by them if it is.
 Wynne's romantic and highly fictionalized view of intelligence: trade-
 craft is characterized by a neglect for the most ordinary security pre-
 cautions and compartmentation on the part of the British and Ameri-
 can services that would appall anybody with experience in clan-
 destine operations.  Wynne naively describes these things with pre-
 cisely the opposite intent.  In his imaginings he has used James Bond
 rather than reality as his guide.  For example, he portrays the de-
 briefing of Penkovskiy in London as conducted in an "operations
 center [where] . . . in place of the prim bedroom furniture, were
 installed typewriters, tape-recorders, coding machines, radio equip-
 ment, a private line to Washington, and a projector for slides and
 films.  Stenographers, typists and interpreters in case of technical
 language difficulties.  A doctor with stethoscope, syringe, and pep
 pills to keep Alex awake and alert; during his whole stay in Lon-
 don he never had more than three hours' sleep a night.  And
 relays of British and American Intelligence officers to question, ques-
 tion, question."
 Wynne also tells how American and British intelligence services
 rounded up from Britain and America a host of twenty Soviet defectors
 and introduced them to Penkovskiy to assure him that former Soviet
 citizens can succeed in life in the West.  Wynne says "the effect on
 Alex was electrical." If Penkovskiy had really been confronted with
 a room full of twenty defectors, the effect would almost certainly
 have been fatal.

 The whole story is skewed by Wynne's placing himself at the center
 of the operation when, in fact, both Penkovskiy and his British and
 American colleagues looked upon Wynne as a vehicle of opportunity
 for communication.  That role was, as Wynne's subsequent experi-
 ence proved, as dangerous and in its own way as demanding as that
 of anyone involved, with the sole exception of Penkovskiy.  It could
 have been told well and truthfully and the library of books on intelli-
 gence operations would have been enriched thereby.  But Wynne
 chose to cast himself in the role of Penkovskiy's closest friend and
 confidant, as a trained intelligence officer who in many ways directed
 the operation, and as a man skilled and educated to fit the public
 conception of the master spy.  Being in truth none of these things, he
 has written a hollow and unrewarding narrative.
 And yet in writing of Greville Wynne, one must also say last things
 last.  Who can say, without having undergone what Wynne experi-
 enced, how he himself would conceive of his own role and how he
 would go about exploiting it once he had managed to endure the
 mental and physical stress of being the courier, of being subjected to
 interrogation and trial, and finally of imprisonment?

 TOPAZ.  By Leon Uris.  (New York: McGraw-Hill.  19?7.  341 pp.
 $5.95.)
 Two interesting intelligence cases are recounted in Topaz.  One
 begins with the defection of a Soviet operative and ends with the
 discovery of a French officer spying for the Russians in an inter-
 allied headquarters.  The other describes how an agent of the French
 service observed a Soviet missile being moved along the streets of
 Havana and how his report triggered the final steps to the confronta-
 tion.  What is more, these stories are placed in the context of decision-
 making at the national level, in both the United States and France.
 A good deal is said about the immensely delicate situation which arises
 between two Western governments when one is known to have been
 penetrated by the Soviets.  There is also some well-informed writing
 about the way in which Soviet disinformation operations are carried
 out at the highest levels in the Western alliance.

 and overly emotional novel.  French hostility to the United States is

 the subject matter of the main plot, with the chief of French opera-
 tions in Washington billed as a tragic hero.  As the story moves
 toward its catastrophe this worthy returns to Paris burdened with the
 unwelcome news of a Soviet penetration at the top of his government.
 He also carries with him the knowledge that he has helped the
 Americans-a serious offense-by giving them the missile report.
 There, at headquarters, in an atmosphere laden with deceit and ten-
 sion, he spends his last days in the service of his country.
 Some years ago this kind of story might have been cast against the
 background of the cold war.  Here Soviet espionage and a Cuban
 missile crisis are but props in dramatizing the gradual disaffection
 of a senior French officer.  The inside view of a malevolent foreign
 service is not to be had in Moscow or East Berlin but in Paris.  This
 is not just innocent fun; Uris evidently let himself go writing about
 the French.
 At the popular level, Topaz has all the paraphernalia of a spy
 thriller. There is a love story, some sex, and a little sadism, all acted
 out by foreigners.  The American operators are tight-lipped, ded-
 icated, and competent, their tradecraft crisp and their operations
 sound.  It is a simple world of the good and bad, peopled with black-
 and-white characters whose doings have little meaning beyond the
 most obvious.
 For the reader who is looking for adult fare, Topaz must stand,
 then, on the appeal of the spy cases it incorporates.  On this basis it
 does quite well.  The stories have an authentic ring. They merit
 the reader's attention; and the rest of the book can be easily skimmed.

 The most that can be said of this interestingly organized and well
 illustrated volume is that it reveals a painstaking perusal of the con-
 temporary press and a soaring imagination.  One utterly delightful
 paragraph will show something of the spirit of the book:

 ease-can exploit the work of the satellites such as Midas II which detects
 missiles.  This enables them to count the number of intercontinental missiles
 the Russians have in stock at Sverdlovsk . . . and listen to the count-down
 of Luna No. Y. at Kapustin Yar in deepest Russia ... .
 It is a little bit premature to say that [CIA] is listening to the most intimate
 discussions held in the Kremlin-as in 1955 it listened to the telephone con-
 versations between East German authorities, natives as wel'. as occupiers,
 thanks to a tunnel which led right into the transmission center in East Berlin.
 We are treated to the inevitable bit of French hauteur in. the political
 realm, it being well known that all Americans-in rerum nature-are
 political cretins.  Messrs. Dulles and McCone "were politically fre-
 quently wrong." And "the CIA has done a great deal on the technical
 side in the secret war . . . The CIA is a machine perfectly adapted to
 scientific war . . . but politically it is weak."
 With respect to other agencies: "to become a member of the famous
 FBI, a G-man, one does not have to be a fine marksman or a judo
 expert-but one must absolutely be an expert accountant."
 The book is not pointedly anti-American.  It is like any French
 book on America. All Frenchmen know from birth that the American
 intellect ends at the flat end of a screw driver and that the world
 would be happier if the Quai d'Orsay were to run the Department of
 State.  As for its contribution of information, it has nothing to tell
 a dutiful reader of Ramparts.

 DER DEUTSCHE GEHEIMDIENST: Geschichte der Militiirischen
 Abwehr.  By Gert Buchheit.  (Munchen:  List Verlag.  1966.
 494 pp.    DM 29.80.)
 It may be that intelligence organizations are the most hazard-
 ridden of all possible subjects for historical description.                            Outsiders
 are strongly tempted to write sensational exposes, insiders to produce
 whitewashes and glorifications.  Sources are often mainly the per-
 sonal recollections of two or three individuals with strong prejudices
 about the organization and with personal interests to defend. Their
 memories are sometimes extended with a few documentary scraps,
 but the files of the organization usually remain closed-a state of
 affairs which, however excellent for security, poses a major obstacle
 to serious historical study,  Good history seems to require a sub-
 stantial volume of hard evidence worked over by a number of inde-
 pendent investigators who criticize each other and name their sources.
 If any secret services can be treated seriously in public print, it
 should be those of the Third Reich.  Here the files-to the extent
 that they have escaped destruction-are largely open, and officers
 of the several organizations still survive in some numbers, so that
 their accounts can be questioned and compared.  Much has already
 been published on the Nazi state and the Wehrmacht, and some of
 it treating subjects close to intelligence has been of high quality.
 Dr. Buchheit now makes the first serious attempt at a comprehensive
 study of the Abwehr itself; be covers a span from 1912 to 1945.  Al-
 though he succumbs to some of the hazards, he has made a real
 contribution.
 An ex-Wehrmacht officer with some intelligence experience, Buch-
 heit has also written books on Hitler and on General Ludwig Beck,
 to some extent glossing over the latter's less admirable characteristics.
 In the work under review here he was encouraged and assisted by
 Col. Otto Wagner, who has become a leader of the Abwehr veterans,
 so that the book might be considered a sort of authorized history
 of the organization.  It has an official history's virtues and faults.
 Almost invariably the Abwehr and its chief, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris,
 emerge as effective, upstanding, loyal to the Fatherland, and un-
 stained by Hitlerite crime.  (Since the work of this company of

 honorable gentlemen is contrasted with the misdeeds of the Sicher-
 heitsdienst, perhaps someone will undertake a rebuttal on behalf of
 that organization.)  In one area familiar to this reviewer, Buchheit
 plays down the role of the pre-Hitler Abwehr in some activities which
 might seem less creditable today-protecting the security of the
 Reichswehr's illegal rearmament preparations, or spying on politicians
 and diplomats for General Kurt von Schleicher.  More generally,
 given the documentary material available in German and American
 archives, much of which he used, he might have made a more detailed
 analysis of selected Abwehr operations.
 Two of the author's themes may especially interest readers of this
 journal.  One is the problem the Germans faced in intelligence col-
 lection and counterintelligence defense on the Russian front.  Before
 hostilities began, the military attache in Moscow told Canaris that
 it would be easier for an Arab wearing a flowing white burnoose to
 pass through Berlin unnoticed than for a foreign agent to escape
 notice in Soviet Russia.  After 22 June 1941 the mass executions by
 the SS Einsatzgruppen ensured the hostility of the people, prejudic-
 ing intelligence as well as operations.  Soviet partisan bands were
 rapidly mobilized and expanded under long-standing plans, harassing
 the German rear and sending intelligence to the Red Army; the reader
 will see the resemblances between these partisans and today's Viet
 Cong.  The French underground also became much more active
 after the Russians were engaged.  Buchheit makes no boner about the
 superiority of Soviet intelligence, claiming only that the Abwehr
 managed to mount a serious opposition. He says that the Abwehr suc-
 ceeded in recognizing 50,000 out of 130,000 Soviet agents and "mak-
 ing 20,000 harmless" (not necessarily executing all these; many were
 turned and played back).  German intelligence units on the front
 lost 30% of their strength to enemy attack.
 The other theme, one running through the whole book, is the in-
 telligence officer's problem of honesty and honor when his objective
 reports are considered "defeatist" at a high level, or when he is made
 a witness to or an unwilling participant in inhuman acts.  What is
 he to do when protests go unheard?  In early 1940 one high Abwehr
 officer, General Hans Oster, deliberately gave information on impend-
 ing German attacks to the Dutch, hoping to frustrate Hitler's plan.
 lie also conspired with other generals against Hitler.  Canaris did
 not go this far, but he did work to discourage a German attack on
 Gibraltar, and he warned the Swiss that Hitler intended to overrun

 their country.  Such extreme actions could only be justified under
 and against a Hitler.  But on a more ordinary level, we are con-
 stantly reminded that any intelligence officer in any service sometimes
 has a duty to speak unwelcome truths.  The Abwehr, at least as
 Buchheit describes it, had a good record for such Zivilcourage.

 THE MILITARY ATTACHE.  By Alfred Vagts.  (Princeton: Prince-
 ton University Press.  1967.                            408 pp.         $10.00.)
 This is a good book. It is well documented; it is interesting; it is,
 at times, humorous.  Additionally, it accomplishes what it intends
 to accomplish, i.e., to give the reader a history of the service attache
 post-as used by many countries-and to show the various fields of
 activity in which attaches have engaged.
 Professor Vagts has apparently elected to delve into this aspect of
 his continued field of interest, the history of militarism, with little
 updating as to source material.  He mentions a few New York; Times
 articles from the early 1960's, but of approximately 50 books and
 lengthy documents comprising his bibliography only one has been
 published in the past ten years. That one is the revised edition (1959)
 of his own A History of Militarism.  Also, to the best of my recollec-
 tion, none of his illustrative examples involve either an air attache
 or a marine attache.  It is true, however, that his well-selected quota-
 tions and incidents, though devoted to army or navy instances, make
 his point for all the military services.
 With respect to intelligence in particular, there is little that is in-
 structive in "Part I: Historical Outline." This first section does include,
 however, many not-so-well-known items for one's storehouse of anec-
 dotes-from the caning of a Roman army officer by an ambassador in
 the camp of Syphax (so as to protect the officer-spy's cover as a slave
 of the ambassador) to the freeing of a U.S. male attache for field
 duty in 1944 by the appointment of a WAC major as assistant mili-
 tary attache in London.
 Part II, which occupies about sixty percent of the book, is of more
 interest from an intelligence viewpoint.  Surprisingly, though, there
 is much more on intelligence in its Chapter 17, which deals with
 "Service Attaches and the Alliances"-in two sections, before and

 after 1918-than in those with the more likely intelligence titles of
 "The Attache as Observer" and "Spying Attaches and Diplomacy."
 This is not a book to be read through at one sitting.  There is an
 unexpected number of footnotes (1,040 of them), and these sometimes
 prove more revealing than the text proper. But even reading a bit
 at a time, one cannot avoid the cumulative thrust of the historical
 incidents which the author brings in again and again to show the
 conflicts that civilian-military relationships create for attaches from
 most nations at the various world embassies.  Vagts' quote from an
 instruction issued in Germany
 Since no mission can pursue two policies in its relations with a foreign state,
 every report of a military attache must be submitted to the Ambassador.
 highlights an attache problem of 1891-and of years before, and since.
 Several attaches-designate of my acquaintance have now read The
 Military Attache'.  They were distracted by its multitude of footnotes
 and disappointed by its almost total lack of reference to the past
 decade.  If neither of these peculiarities will unduly affect you, you
 will probably find in it a good deal to enjoy, stretching the reading
 out over a period of time.
 THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.  By Monro
 MacCloskey, Brigadier General, USAF (ret.). (New York: Richards
 Rosen Press.  1967.  190 pp.  $3.78.)
 This inept concoction will not do at all.
 Not that the book does great harm.  It bears no malice, grinds
 no axes, and seems to have no deeper purpose than to turn an honest
 dollar.  Its intended audience is no more exalted than, say, the reserve
 lieutenant who needs to eke out a point toward retirement by boning
 up on the book for a talk on intelligence to a meeting of his reserve
 unit.  But it is a thoroughly unsatisfactory job.  The reason for
 reviewing such a book here is twofold: to lessen the chance that,
 given the importance of the subject and the impressive military
 background of the author, some training establishment will put it on a
 list of required or recommended reading; and to discourage other
 amateur researchers from undertaking a subject so far beyond them.

 The book is apparently the eighth title in its publisher's "Military
 Research Series," of which the other seven entries were also by Gen.
 MacCloskey.  But military research is exactly what it is not.  The
 lieutenant boning up for his point could compile a more accurate and
 useful treatment of the subject by browsing for a few hours in any
 reasonably good public library.  He would be spared having to
 accept misinformation like this on the say-so of a retired general officer
 with some intelligence experience:
 The (US Intelligence] Board meets at least once a week at CIA headquarters
 to weigh the input from the operating agencies and to prepare a compre-
 hensive summary of secret information known as the National Intelligence
 Estimate. This report is sent to the President weekly and provides him with
 an excellent compendium of events and trends world-wide.  In addition to
 the weekly presentations, about twenty-five special reports are prepared each
 year.  ... The work of the Board is performed by about fifty special com-
 mittees.  . . . (p. 58)
 Those are four of the sixteen sentences on USIB, which take up rather
 less space than the author gives to a passage about diplomatic immu-
 nity quoted from a training manual for defense attaches.  On the other
 hand, he does give to USIB a little more space than to Mata what's-her-
 name, whose career he recounts in a couple of dozen lines that end
 with an erroneous date and a fearless judgment:
 ... executed by a firing squad on October 15, 1916.  Though much famed
 in fiction and motion pictures, her actual accomplishments in espionage would
 hardly be worthy of a footnote in military intelligence history.  (p. 31)
 In point of fact, the author treats his whole large subject as unworthy
 of footnotes.  The book has none of the elementary apparatus of
 scholarship which any serious reader has a right to expect, and which
 indeed the title of the series promises.  No citation of authority how-
 ever flimsy, except the two acts of Congress quoted in appendices and
 a training manual or two; no bibliography however fragmentary; not
 even an index.  The level of research is exposed most cruelly in the
 chapter on the defense attache system, which is the field of intelligence
 the author knows best:
 In late 1966, there were 168 Air Force officers and 260 enlisted airmen
 assigned to Defense attache offices. Strengths of the Army and Navy attache
 offices may be assumed to be roughly the same.  (p. 113)
 But what is most damaging is not the author's laziness, it is his
 total want of discrimination, judgment, ability to evaluate evidence.

 He read somewhere, no telling where, that Bismarck owed his quick
 successes over Austria in 1866 and France in 1870 to the clandestine
 operations of "the notorious Prussian spymaster, Wilhelm Stieber."
 So that goes into the chapter on "historical background" (p. 27), along
 with Christopher Marlowe and Mata Hari.  Then he read somewhere
 else that Bismarck owed those same quick successes largely to "the
 volume and accuracy of the intelligence information furnished by
 attaches." So that goes into the chapter on attaches. (p. 106).
 In short, this is a thing of shreds and patches; one of those books
 which string together threadbare assertions, unverified, unquestioned,
 unrelated to the subject at hand, often pointless, scavenged from other
 incompetent secondary sources which acquired the same shoddy goods
 the same way.  How many times have you read the flat assertion that
 in 1929 Secretary Stimson said.  "Gentlemen do not read each other's
 mail?" Dozens.  But have you ever seen one of these hacks make
 even the feeblest effort to document that assertion?  I never have.
 Here is one more publication on that low level of research and analysis.

 Intelligence and Policy
 THE ESPIONAGE ESTABLISHMENT.  By David Wise and. Thomas
 B. Ross.  (New York: Random House.  1967.  308 pp.  $6.95.)
 In this new book the authors have undertaken an ambitious forward
 step in exploitation of the groundwork laid in their earlier one. Where
 The Invisible Government capitalized on the dramatic effect of expo-
 sure, The Espionage Establishment represents a more serious and in
 many respects a more effective resort to analysis. This will offer little
 satisfaction to the professional intelligence officer who, taking his
 business seriously, strives to retain a general sense of proportion with
 respect to the nature and purpose of his endeavor.  Messrs. Wise
 and Ross frankly deplore its nature, although they will concede with
 some reluctance that it probably cannot be dispensed with in today's
 world.
 The concept of the intelligence community as a source of secret
 power threatening the freedom it is designed to defend remains the
 authors' basic premise, but they have now widened the arena. Focus-
 ing first on the intelligence services of the four major powers, they
 lay great stress on the institutional features of espionage.  They depict
 the parallel roles played by the major services in their respective
 countries.  That done, they launch a new thesis which in effect
 comprises the main thrust of the book.  The espionage revolution, as
 Ross and Wise term it, is predicated upon the mushroom growth of
 vast espionage "establishments" following World War II, and on the
 inevitability of open and spectacular collision between them.  Out
 of this collision Ross and Wise see emerging a new set of rules
 governing international espionage, unwritten but understood, which
 taken as a whole represent a new, permissive way of looking at the spy
 business on the part of governments and people.
 The authors naturally view this phenomenon with considerable
 alarm.  Reader reaction to it is likely to vary according to attitudes
 developed prior to perusal of the book.  Viewed charitably and with
 appropriate concession to the authors' premises, The Espionage Estab-
 lishment stands up under scrutiny as a better than average specimen
 of its genre.  It is superior in almost every respect to The Invisible
 Government.    The writing is good journalese, and the narrative flows
 smoothly with only moderate exploitation of the sensational potential

 of the subject matter.  While the cut-and-paste-approach is not en-
 tirely disguised, there is reasonable coherence and sustained momen-
 tum.
 Good marks are also in order for the authors' treatment of the Soviet
 intelligence system.  Drawing largely on factual data that have been
 in the public domain for some time, they have compiled an accurate
 and readable account of a subject that should fascinate but rarely
 does.  The espionage cases they feature are all Soviet operations
 targeted at the United States except for the Stashynsky assassination
 and the mustard gas attack on West German electronics expert
 Schwirkmann.  Soviet "illegal" operations are handled extremely well.
 With allowance for inaccuracies discernible to few outside of pro-
 fessional circles, this is probably the most lucid exposition of the
 subject currently available to the layman.
 Her Britannic Majesty's intelligence and security services are treated
 shabbily in what is certainly the most objectionable portion of the
 book.  The detailed exposure of MI-5 and MI-6 exceeds by far any-
 thing previously in print.  Undoubtedly Messrs. Ross and Wise have
 exploited information long available to the British press which it
 could not print in the face of the D-notice system backed by the Official
 Secrets Acts.  The extent and significance of damage thus inflicted on
 our British counterparts can better be judged by them.  The authors
 would certainly argue-as they did in the case of The Invisible Govern-
 ment-that all they have done by cooperating with British journalists
 to circumvent British security procedures was designed simply to tell
 the public what it had a right to know.  British Intelligence, they
 would contend, once it recovers from the shock, can go on to greater
 glory under the new ground rules.
 The chapter on Chinese Communist Intelligence has a dogmatic
 ring of authority, but it falls flat upon scrutiny.  Its dramatic case
 for Kang Sheng as the leading light of the Chinese intelligence service
 cannot be authenticated.  A number of factual inaccuracies and
 much dated information mark the sections dealing with the service's
 organization and distribution of responsibilities.   On the :Plus side,
 the authors present a reasonably accurate picture of the intelligence
 role of Peking's embassies and trade missions.  For reasons difficult
 to explain, they occasionally resort to such dubious generalizations as
 "in the rest of Asia, and in Australia as well, the KGB has become so
 bogged down in counterintelligence operations against the Chinese

 that its subversive activities had practically come to a standstill."
 Overt sources-Time magazine and other periodicals-would account
 for most of the material included in the chapter.
 The "establishment" motif is played for all it is worth in the chapter
 on the United States.  Ross and Wise appreciate the existence and
 scope of the rest of the intelligence community, but in their 44 pages
 devoted to the subject, CIA-clearly a source of better copy-receives
 their total attention. Names are named, some of them for the ump-
 teenth time, all designed to reflect the Agency's intimate partnership
 in the select circle of public figures presumed to be in control of
 national policy.  For background and color, all the old tales from
 the cocktail circuit are trotted out and replayed in apparent seriousness.
 A sense of humor, which the authors clearly lack, might have added
 some badly needed perspective and served to offset the superficiality of
 their approach.
 In their search for novelty Ross and Wise have now "discovered"
 the CIA Domestic Operations Division,  They make a good deal of
 it, and go to some pains to question the legality of the activity centered
 on 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue.  The net effect of the effort is to cast
 a hazy shadow over it all, without ever really coming to grips with the
 issue.  Specific data relating to Agency personnel and operations are
 taken from public sources.  In this sense they do no particular damage.
 The net effect, nevertheless, is bad.  The citizen reader in his :inno-
 cence, scanning these pages uncritically, will probably find what he
 bargained for at the counter-a bit of sex, a touch of murder, a power-
 ful agency relentlessly expanding, its soiled cloak and dagger only
 half concealed by its Madison Avenue style.  Some of this is  lain
 nonsense.  Some of it is patently irresponsible.  Regrettably, the
 specifics will escape rebuttal and the authors enjoy the last word.
 When all is said and done, it is obvious that although Ross and
 Wise have widened the scope of their interests to encompass the
 intelligence services of the other world powers, they have done so only
 as a tour de force.  CIA and all its works and pomps are their real
 concern.  The main arguments of The Invisible Government echo
 again and again through these pages.  They insist that the President,
 despite protestations to the contrary, is not informed of many of the
 Agency's important activities.  To support this they cite President
 Johnson's statement last February that he was "totally unaware"

 of the Agency's involvement with the National Student Association.
 They dismiss the various forms of control over the Agency, including
 congressional supervision, as inadequate.  Congress, they contend,
 has virtually abdicated its responsibility to act as a check on the vast
 hidden power of "the invisible government." They hold further, in
 reviewing the NSA "scandal," that the Special Group and the Agency
 violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the Agency's charter.  They
 conclude by urging that the "obsolete" machinery for control of the
 Agency be replaced by a visible and credible guardian, thus assuring
 the public that the secret instruments of government are the servants
 and not the masters of the national will.
 It is difficult to debate the Ross-Wise thesis, in part because they
 dismiss one's premises out of hand, and in part because of their re-
 luctance to accept at face value anything reflecting favorably on CIA.
 Their elaboration on the new role of espionage in world affairs,
 although contrived and specious, is not uninteresting. It will certainly
 help to sell the book.  Few readers can fail to react to the exhortation
 that espionage per se is a potential threat to world peace, "infinitely
 more dangerous" now than ever before.  Few can but be impressed
 by the authors' assurance that espionage today creates a:n atmosphere
 in which the veracity of government is questioned even when it is
 telling the truth.  The credibility gap, according to Messrs. Ross and
 Wise, arose out of the Government's need to hide and protect its
 espionage activity.  When they argue that the Government has no
 right to lie, few would disagree.  Concomitantly, they seem to imply
 that the Government has no right ever to remain silent.  The Press,
 by the same token, must ferret out the truth and force the Government
 to confirm its impressions.
 Ross and Wise allude frequently to the "literature of intelligence."
 In it they see the lamentable extent to which espionage has permeated
 the consciousness of modern society.  They deplore the genie's escape
 from the bottle.  Oh, for a return to a quieter agel  There is a tongue-
 in-check quality to all of this.  The genie has, after all, brought zest
 to the new journalism, and nobody knows it better than Messrs. Ross
 and Wise.

 for foreign policy planning and its illustration in application to U.S.
 policy in Iran.  The model comprises a statement of objectives, ex-
 plicit and detailed analysis of the situation and trends, formulation
 of a strategy for changing these trends in favor of our objectives, and
 selection, through an elaborate system of probes,. of tactical steps
 in pursuit of the strategy.  In Iran, for example-to simplify radi-
 cally-one of our objectives is a stable non-communist government,
 one of the trends is toward a concentration of power in the hands of
 one man who :might be assassinated, so part of our strategy should
 be to gradually broaden the base of the government, using our overt
 leverage and covert assets in specified tactical moves to that end.
 Intelligence comes into this not to make the required situational
 analysis-Professor Cottam despairs of the "bureaucracy's" ever doing
 such a careful and explicit job or being objective about it, and he would
 have scholars do it for the benefit of congressional critics of administra-
 tion policy-but by way of CIA's "other duties and functions," for
 covert political action.  It is artificial and old-fashioned, he says, to
 shrink from this kind of meddling in other countries' internal affairs;
 competitive interference is the very essence of foreign policy in the
 nuclear age.  But it should be done early, continuously, and unob-
 trusively, instead of waiting until unfavorable trends have taken their
 course and then having to do a crude thing like unseating Mossadeq.
 CIA should therefore not be thought of as merely a supportive arm
 of foreign policy, an instrument to be resorted to in crisis, but inte-
 grated functionally into all stages of policy formulation and execution.
 The new interdepartmental committees are a step in the right direction.
 Like most books on foreign policy, this one virtually ignores the
 role of intelligence proper, in planning and decision.  Otherwise its
 argument is logical, closely reasoned, and concretely illustrated, though
 not phrased for easy reading.  One suspects, however, that the "ideal
 type model" is all too ideal ever to be put into practice.

 WHITE TIE AND DAGGER.  By Andrew Tully.  (New York:
 William Morrow.  1967,  257 pp.  $5.95.)
 If this latest "inside story"-of diplomacy-is not a potboiler, it has
 all the disarming characteristics of one. Spy stories and diplomatic
 scandals from the Profumo affair to the Cuban missile crisis-in which
 latter it appears that the Briton Ormsby-Gore had the hidden guiding
 role-are dressed in inimitable graphic detail and verbatim quotations
 of the author's imagining and strung tenuously on a provocative theme
 addressed in the last chapter, "Is Embassy Row Obsolete?" This
 chapter offers food for pondering in a belief attributed to Dean Rusk
 that international "tensions will decrease if international relations can
 be kept in the background."
 In pursuit of this line Mr. Tully actually appears to have run out of
 material when he had only about half enough pages for a book, so
 he introduces a section on lobbying, a chapter each on Red China's
 effort to influence Washington, on the Formosa lobby, and on Julius
 Klein and sundry lobbyists; and then, since that added only about
 forty pages, comes a section on ambassadors of history at the threshold
 of U.S. wars-,Serurier in 1812, Lord Lyons in 1861, Von Bernstorff in
 1915-16, and Nomura-Kurusu in 1941.  But this cold outline gives no
 idea of the high humour with which the author writes.  Let him speak
 for himself, as he describes the practical joke of a "bibulous British
 diplomat" on a Soviet minister counselor:
 "It's not Johnson at all, you know," he told Zinchuk.  "He was assassinated
 (luring the campaign, but they kept it quiet and elected a double.  It was
 quite easy, with Goldwater running on the Republican ticket." Zinchuk, one
 of the more urbane Soviet diplomats, tore himself away as soon as it seemed
 safe, convinced the Englishman was mad.  But the British envoy later
 reported he had checked with "an intelligence bloke" and discovered that
 Moscow was making discreet inquiries about a reported "accident" to
 Johnson during the 1964 campaign.

 experience he has had or some role he has played.  These do have
 a wide range: war crimes trials; his defense of unpopular clients, as
 of Colonel Abel; the Cuban prisoner exchange after the Bay of Pigs;
 and a number of different episodes from his work with the public
 schools in New York.  Only one section, entitled "World Power and
 Strategic Intelligence," has to do with intelligence.  It is a rather simple
 outline of what the function is and how important it is in the modern
 world, with emphasis on the role of the Central Intelligence Agency.
 While it is nice to have such kind words appear in print, the discussion
 offers nothing instructive for intelligence officers, being probably well
 suited to the audience to which it was delivered at the Lake Placid
 Club in New York.

 THE YOUNG STALIN.  By Edward Ellis Smith.  (New York:
 Farrar, Straus, and Giroux.  1967.  470 pp.  $8,50.)
 This book is built around the thesis that Stalin was an Okhrana agent
 throughout his prerevolutionary career, and all the evidence pre-
 sented-the product of a very substantial research effort:-is shaped
 to fit this view.  The results are sometimes persuasive but frequently
 awkward and incredible, even to a reader who was originally pre-
 disposed toward the author's thesis.
 For Mr. Smith tries too hard.  All too often, when evidence is
 either lacking or completely ambiguous, he constructs a highly specula-
 tive and improbable hypothesis which he later alludes to as established
 fact.  (His depiction of Stalin's supposed conspiratorial relationship
 in 1913 with the Bolshevik leader and known Okhrana agent Ramon
 Malinovsky-at a time when by Smith's own showing Stalin was in
 very bad odor with the Okhrana-is an example of such a hypothesis.)
 More than once he sets forth an impressive generalization which he
 himself subsequently undermines, apparently unwittingly: thus he
 attaches (p. 59) tremendous sinister significance to the fact that
 Stalin "alone" escaped arrest in the Okhrana raids in Tiflis in March
 1901 but three pages later alludes in passing to a more important
 Georgian revolutionary, Ketskhoveli, who had similarly escaped. This
 overenthusiastic approach to the facts creates unnecessary distrust
 in the reader and weakens confidence in some conclusions which may
 nevertheless be correct.
 The author does best in the first third of his narrative: although he
 does not prove his thesis, there seems nothing inherently impossible
 and much that is reasonable in his suggestion that Dzhugashvili may
 have been tapped by the Okhrana as a low-level agent shortly after
 his expulsion from the Tiflis seminary in 1899, that he systematically
 informed on comrades in party organizations in Tiflis, Baku, and Batum
 over the next few years, that he acquired a highly unsavory reputation
 among the Social Democrats of each city in turn, that he was finally
 arrested for cover purposes in 1902 when revolutionary suspicions
 about him were about to boil over, and that the Okhrana furnished

 the otherwise invisible means of support for the family he acquired
 after 1904.
 It is after this that Smith begins increasingly to strain the evidence.
 He insists that the Okhrana was behind Stalin's masterminding of the
 particularly bloody and ill-fated Yerevan Square robbery in Tiflis in
 June 1907, although he is not consistent enough even to examine the
 question of whether the Okhrana endorsed all the other Caucasus
 "expropriations" Stalin is believed to have planned for the Bolsheviks
 in 1906 and 1907.  These operations were congenial work for Stalin,
 and it was through them that he first acquired importance in Lenin's
 eyes-surely sufficient motivation in itself for performing them.  From
 here on the effort to explain Stalin's behavior in terms of supposed
 Okhrana operations becomes ludicrous in the light of what both the
 Okhrana and Stalin actually did.  The Okhrana arrested Stalin five
 times in the nine years between March 1908 and the February Revolu-
 tion, and it left :him at large a total of 3 months in 1908, 6 months in
 1909, 3 months in 1910, 2 months in 1911, 6 months in 1912, 2 months in
 1913, and not at all in 1914, 1915, or 1916.  In September 1911 Stalin
 had barely been in St. Petersburg two days before he was picked
 up again and sent back to his term in exile.  This seems to go well
 beyond any conceivable requirements of cover.  For Stalin's part,
 when he was helping to run Pravda in St. Petersburg late in 1912 he took
 a temporarily conciliatory line toward the Mensheviks-which, as
 Smith admits, was precisely the opposite of what was wanted by both
 the Okhrana and Lenin.
 Smith recognizes that Stalin was not at all under Okhrana control by
 1912, yet stubbornly insists (p. 202) that he must have continued to
 have a regular contact in the Department of Police in St. Petersburg
 to whom he supposedly could plan to denounce Roman Malinovsky
 for disloyalty to the Okhrana.  One of the weakest aspects of the
 book is the failure to consider carefully when such links must have
 disappeared, at what point Stalin must have decided to opt for the
 Bolsheviks rather than the police.  The evidence provided in the
 book itself suggests strongly that this occurred much earlier than
 the author is willing to admit, and that if Stalin had once had a foot
 in the Okhrana camp it was probably withdrawn by 1907 or 1.908.

 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD ESPIONAGE.  By As^ye Hashavia.
 In Hebrew.  (Tel Aviv: Ledory Publishing House.  1967.  339 pp.)
 This is the title printed in English on one of the flyleaves.  The
 actual Hebrew title translates as follows:  "Espionage: Encyclopedia
 of Espionage and Spies." It covers the ambitious effort to present
 in one volume of 48 chapters a historical review of the development
 of espionage and a description of the structure of intelligence services
 in the West, of present-day political and economic intelligence, and of
 the essence of cryptology, secret writing, listening devices, and wire
 tapping, as well as summaries of some famous spy cases.
 Obviously, with such a wide range of topics, the author could give
 no more than snatches of tradecraft and some briefest synopses of
 case history.  But he is not interested in a serious analysis anyway.
 He is writing not for the professional but for the layman, and more
 specifically for youthful readers attracted to the glamor of cloak-and-
 dagger activities.  (Two previous books under his name, possibly a
 pseudonym, deal with exploration and discovery.)  For this audience
 he does very well. He writes in a light, entertaining tone which makes
 for easy reading, treats the actors in the case histories sympathetically,
 on the whole, and invests their exploits with an aura of romance.
 The book begins, predictably, with the reconnaissance party Moses
 sent into the Promised Land and Joshua's mission to Jericho; it ends
 with the U-2 flight of Francis Powers.  From U.S. history come
 also the stories of Benedict Arnold, the Civil War nurse Emma
 Edmonds, OSS's Dr. Stanley Lovell and his unconventional gadgets,
 and Yoshikawa, "Hero of Pearl Harbor."  Alongside these are ranged
 the internationally famous spy stories of Mata Hari and her daughter,
 "Cicero," Klaus Fuchs, Eric Erickson, Lonsdale, and others.
 Of especially Jewish interest are the case histories of the Dreyfus
 affair, the Nili spy net in Turkish Palestine during Word War I, the
 Israeli spy Ali Cohen, caught and executed in Syria, and Frances
 Hagen, the U.S. pro-Arab female spy caught and sentenced in Israel.
 There are no revelations about Israeli intelligence, :however; the
 author's principal source appears to have been the prolific writings
 of Kurt D. Singer, whom he specifically mentions in several places.
