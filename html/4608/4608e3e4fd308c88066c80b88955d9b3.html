 LIN PIAO AND THE GREAT HELMSMAN
 MEMORANDUM TO RECIPIENTS:
 Lin Piao, now 62 years of age, has long been Mao
 Tse-tung's favorite military leader.   It was not until
 1958, however,  that he became a major party leader, and
 he has been Mao's "closest comrade-in-arms" and designated
 successor as chairman of the party only since 1966.  Lin's
 unexpected rise to such eminence has evoked questions as
 to whether he should be taken seriously as a successor
 to Mao and as a true Maoist.
 For example, has Lin merely exploited Mao's vanity
 and the opportunities provided by the Cultural Revolu-
 tion for his own purposes, or is he fully faithful to
 Mao and committed to Maoism?  Was Mao's choice of Lin as
 successor a sudden and arbitrary decision which he may
 reverse, or was the act a culmination of years of growing
 confidence in Lin as a standard bearer for Maoist revolu-
 tion?
 This Intelligence Report gives the reader a sense
 of Lin's development and character and of his relation-
 ship over the years with Mao.   It concludes that Lin is
 a devoted Maoist, that he will probably take the helm
 from the Great Helmsman, and that he will attempt to fol-
 low the revolutionary course that has been charted by
 Mao.
 The larger question as to whether Lin Piao as The
 Chairman will be able to stay in power without modifying
 Mao's policies is the subject of future papers in a series
 of SRS studies of Lin Piao.
 This study was reviewed by the Office of National
 Estimates and the Office of Current Intelligence.   Both
 are in general agreement with its thrust and findings.

 LIN PIAO AND THE GREAT HELMSMAN
 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
 Lin's Support of Mao
 The detailed record set forth at Annex is one of
 Lin Piao's dog-like devotion to Mao over a period of
 at least 35 years.   While the story of Lin's relations
 with Mao in the early years of 1928-1934 has been sup-
 plied only recently and may be in part fabricated, the
 record is solid from 1935 to date.   It shows Lin stand-
 ing with Mao against three powerful forces:  Mao's rivals
 for leadership of the party, Lin's peers in the PLA, and
 a succession of Soviet leaders.
 Lin has given Mao important and sometimes crucial
 support against his rivals in the party many times:   in
 the January 1935 showdown which made Mao dominant in the
 party, in the 1942 "rectification" campaign, in the chal-
 lenge by Peng Te-huai in 1959, during the first stage of
 the challenge by Liu Shao-chi in 1962, throughout the
 prolonged struggle for power with Liu's party apparatus
 in the years 1962-65, in the autumn of 1965 as the Cul-
 tural Revolution was emerging, in Mao's operations out-
 side Peking in the winter of 1965-66, and throughout the
 tumultuous events of spring and summer 1966 that ended
 with the purge of Liu and the smashing of the party
 apparatus.  At each of these junctures, Lin risked his
 own position; he identified himself so completely with
 Mao that he would have been brought down if Mao had lost
 the battle.
 Similarly, Lin has supported Mao against one or
 another group in the Chinese Communist armed forces much
 of the time since at least 1935; and in the Cultural

 Revolution he has put heavy pressure on the PLA as a whole,
 thereby risking his own base of power.   Lin supported
 Mao against military as well as party leaders in the
 showdown of January 1935, helped to purge the PLA in the
 "rectification" of 1942, carried out the purge of 1959,
 and took the lead in purging the chief-of-staff and
 others in late 1965 in order to clear the way for Mao's
 Cultural Revolution.   During the Revolution, he has taken
 the lead in purging--or has acted with Madame Mao and
 others in purging--about half of the central military
 leadership and many regional and provincial leaders.  He
 has protected the young Maoist revolutionaries harassing
 the PLA while rebuking and punishing the PLA for retaliat-
 ing (spring 1967, summer 1967, and spring 1968).   He has
 soaked the PLA in Mao's thought and has consistently told
 his military comrades that the criterion for judging them
 will be their loyalty to Mao and Mao's thought--and he has
 acted on that principle.  He has repeatedly failed to in-
 duce Mao to give the PLA the authority commensurate with
 its responsibilities or to help his military subordinates
 to understand Mao's opaque "instructions", and he has
 conciliated the PLA only reluctantly and in periods of
 acute dependence on it.
 Despite his obligations to and good relations
 with the Russians in the years 1938-1942, Lin immediat-
 ely thereafter supported Mao against the Soviet-oriented
 Chinese leaders, and since 1959 has stood firm with Mao
 on the entire range of issues in dispute with Moscow.
 During the Cultural Revolution, Lin has spoken so offen-
 sively about the Russians--using Mao's harsh and derisive
 terms--that they appear to hate him almost as much as
 they do Mao.  As in his handling of'the PLA, he has
 joined a pullback only--as in recent stages of the border
 dispute--in period- of Preat danger.
 Lin's View of Himself
 Lin's own definition of his relationship with Mao
 is so extreme that it has sometimes been regarded as a
 hoax, a cynical exploitation of the old man's insatiable

 SLC.tET
 vanity.  For more than 25 years Lin has been upholding
 Mao's "thought" and urging absolute faith in Mao, and in
 recent years he has praised Mao--in terms reminiscent of
 Stalin's sycophants--as always correct, the greatest of
 all Communists, the supreme genius, the source of all
 light, the answer to every problem.   I,in has abjured any
 body of thought of his own, or even any identity of his
 own, apart from that of Mao.   He has presented himself
 as entirely Mao's instrument, the perfect servant, recog-
 nizing the distance between the law-giver and himself,
 doing his best to understand and carrying out with all
 his might what he could understand, while being prepared
 --as Mao's servants above all must be prepared---Ito take
 the responsibility for any action which Mao might later
 define as a "mistake".   In all of these respects, his
 record is much better than that of his predecessor, Liu
 Shao-chi.
 There is probably a degree of rhetoric in Lin's
 statements of his feelings toward Mao, but the record
 does seem to support Lin's account of himself as awed,
 dazzled, and in bond entirely.  He has proven his fidelity
 in the best possible way--that is, identifying. his own
 interest completely with Mao's, he has repeatedly risked
 his own position for Mao's sake, and has accepted the
 danger of retaliation--from the PLA and the Russians--in
 the future.   He has indeed been Mao's "best pupil."
 There seems very little chance that he will turn on Mao
 and refuse to carry out Mao's will to the best of his
 ability, or that he will try to hurry the old man into
 retirement or into the grave.
 Mao's Confidence in Lin
 The record also shows Mao to be responding to
 Lin's devotion by assigning Lin posts and tasks of
 increasing importance and trust.   This has been true in
 the military field, in the political field, and in
 recent years across the entire range of a party leader's
 concern.

 Lin's role in the years 1928-1934 is not entirely
 clear, but there is no doubt that Mao chose Lin for a
 curcial military role in 1935 during the Long March.   He
 gave Lin the command of a large part of the Chinese
 Communist forces in 1937, and gave him discretion in
 using them.   In 1945, as soon as Lin was well enough to
 handle the job, Mao gave him command of the best forces
 and assigned him the most important military mission, the
 contest for the Northeast.   This won, he gave Lin the
 most important role in taking the rest of China.   In 1952,
 when Lin was disabled, Mao named him to the MAC, and in
 1959, soon after Lin had returned to action, Mao named
 him to the two most important military posts, Minister
 of Defense and Chief of the MAC.
 Mao showed high confidence in Lin as a political
 leader as early as 1936, in naming him to head the school
 which was to train all Chinese Communist military leaders.
 He demonstrated this confidence repeatedly in 1942 and
 1943, when he used Lin--just back from the USSR--against
 the Soviet-oriented leaders in "rectification," named Lin
 to head the reorganized party school, sent Lin to Chung-
 king to negotiate with the Nationalists, and named Lin
 as his successor as political. officer and (again) presi-
 dent of the military academy.   In 1949, when Mao made
 Lin a regional party first secretary as well as regional
 military commander,  he was the, only person so honored.
 Lin was taken into the politburo in 1955 even when he
 was sick and out of action. Upon his return to limited
 duty Lin was made a vice-chairman of the party and a
 member of the politburo standing committee.   When Lin
 was named to head the MAC in 1959, this party organ for
 the control of the military establishment was subordinated
 only to Mao, not to the party apparatus.
 Mao may have begun to think of Lin as his succes-
 sor as early as 1962.  At that time Mao began to transfer
 his own base of power from the party apparatus to Lin's
 PLA, and to make the political work methods of the PLA
 and `hen the PLA as a whole the models for Chinese society.
 For the next three years, Lin and the PLA were increas-
 ingly presented as the best examples for every individual
 and every organization.   In 1965, Mao-.took Lin into his

 confidence in planning the Cultural Revolution and the
 great purge which was central to it, took Lin with him
 to his headquarters outside Peking, and gave Lin the lead-
 ing role in the first stage of the purge in late 1965.
 He assigned Lin the main speech at the party conference
 of May 1966 which officially launched the Cultural Revo-
 lution, and at the party plenum of August 1966 he revf:,.'1.ed
 Lin to be his choice as his successor, again assigning
 him the main speech.   He had Lin speak for him at the
 rallies of August and September which launched the Red
 Guards. and again assigned to Lin the main speech at
 the October work conference which revealed Mao's further
 plans for the Cultural Revolution.   While Mao then sup-
 plumented Lin with Madame Mao for the next stage of the
 purge of the PLA, from January 1967 Mao used the PLA
 as the rnain instrument of the Cultural Revolution, and
 he did not hold Lin responsible--as he held other mili-
 tary leaders--for "mistakes" in handling mass organiza-
 tions or for occasional acts of defiance by military
 leaders.   Nor did he hold Lin responsible--as he easily
 might have--for the offenses of his proteges Hsiao Hua
 (summer 1967) and Yang Cheng-wu (spring 1968).  On the
 contrary, the October 1968 plenum proclaimed Lin's
 conduct in the Cultural Revolution as "entirely correct,"
 and drafted a Constitution providing for him to succeed
 Mao without contest.   At the Ninth Congress in April 1969,
 Lin was again assigned the main speech and was given
 several places in the politburo for military men in whom
 he apparently had confidence.   Mao took Lin with him to
 a resort for the summer, and again on National Day in
 October assigned him the main speech.
 Although Mao is unstable, he will probably not
 change his mind about Lin.   Lin might need to improve
 his position--that is, install more of his own men--in
 certain central or gans of the party in order to be
 secure against any attempt to prevent him from succeed-
 in- Mao, but it is doubtful that Mao's other lieutenants
 would defy the old man's will and block Lin's way.   It
 is therefore likely that Lin will get his chance as the
 party's chairman.

 Lin's Saturation in Mao's Thought
 With regard to Mao's "thought," the heart of the
 matter is a belief in something close to the perfectibi-
 lity of the party cadre, !.lthough not the perfectibility
 of mankind.   There is to be a new, completely political,
 hypermotivated, selfless party worker who will direct
 imperfect men in the building of a new Chinese society.
 This society will be egalitarian, austere, and in a state
 of continuous revolution.   That is, the party and the
 society will continue to purify themselves through class
 struggle, through a series of Cultural Revolutions, crea-
 tive disorders.   This vision of the good society presumes
 a large, although perhaps diminishing, sector of society
 in labor camps and under other duress.   The party is to
 direct and control "mass" action in which the people
 participate in the formulation of policies devised for
 the common good. The society is to be the model for all
 peoples, and--as a political hyreractive, economically
 prosperous, and militarily powerful modern state--an
 instrument for their liberation.
 The new Chinese cadre is made possible by the
 availability of Mao's thought, embodied in Mao the per-
 fect man, who accepts deification not for himself, but
 on behalf of his "thought."   blao's "thought," in prac-

 all its might and fears "neither hardship nor death."
 This revolutionary will is to be produced in all cadres
 and in the masses so far as possible.   The "thought" calls
 for mobilization of the masses on a colossal scale, as
 in the campaigns against counter-revolutionaries, the

 Cultural Revolution.
 The military doctrine of the emerging Maoist society

 to survive a nuclear attack and to entice an invader to
 his doom.   Chinese offensive doctrine does not envisage
 taking high risks by invading other countries but rather
 encourages "people's wars" of the Chinese type, in which
 Communist-led for..es rely mainly on their own efforts
 and are assisted as practicable by Peking
 Mao's thought does not call for incessant, in-
 sensate militancy, in which no allowance is made for the
 limitations of the human material and the refractoriness
 of the environment; it calls for an adjustment to reality
 as nec.,~ssary.   Mao has been able to retreat in time to
 preserve his own position and to avoid a popular revolt.
 But his bias is militant. calling for the utmost effort
 on a revolutionary line before any slackening is per-
 mitted:   thus, in practice Mao's thought allows for a
 retreat when the real world compels a retreat, usually
 long after the time a non-Maoist would think a retreat
 advisable.
 Mao's "thought" has entailed a style of leader-
 ship which is similar in some respects to Stalin's but
 is identifiably Mao's.   Whether Mao's directives call
 for a revolutionary advance ("Bombard the headquarters")
 or for a period of retreat and consolidation ("We must
 have unity"), Mao's position is always the one correct
 position, the true Leftist center between the extremes
 of the Right and the Ultra-Left.   Mao's directives are
 sometimes clear ("People's communes are good," or "Those
 who attack the PLA will be suppressed") but, when he
 is; undecided about his policy, often vague (the PLA
 and mass organizations are to "cooperate", or the masses
 are to "take part" in party consolidation).   The party
 cadre is always the man in the middle, between the infal-
 lible Mao and the childlike masses, held responsible
 for errors in understanding Mao's will or for incompet-
 ence in carrying it out.   The failings of cadres are
 revealed by intensive and prolonged criticism; the un-
 repentant and incorrigible--willfully in error, like
 Liu Shao-chi--are purged, but most are redeemed by
 exhaustive self-criticism, repentance and reform.   Every
 campaign, no matter how ruinous in some respects, is
 held to result in great gains and only minor losses, and

 Mao's judgment, the people and the environment can stand
 it.
 Lin Piao has been fully identified with Mao's
 thought--not only in his formal speeches, which he has
 admitted he does not write, but in his informal talks
 and spontaneous remarks, which best reflect his true
 beliefs.   By the late 1940's he had accepted Mao's
 "thought" as a coherent body of doctrine, and in the
 years to come was to find it the only necessary doctrine.
 By 1959, he was on record as endorsing and defending
 Mao's radical domestic programs and the rationale for
 them, and Mao-'s application of his thought to the build-
 ing of the military establishment and the PLA's role in
 Chinese life.   By the end of 1960, he had associated
 himself firmly with Mao's strategic military concepts,
 and Mao's rejection of Soviet "revisionism."  In the
 next few years he applied strenuously to the PLA Mao's
 methods of remaking men.   In 1965 he spoke for the con-
 cept of "people's war" as both offensive and defensive
 doctrine in the most ambitious terms possible, and by
 early 1966 he was calling fo:::: an ideological revolution
 in China.   In the course of the Cultural Revolution he
 has stated repeatedly his beliif in Mao's vision of a
 new China, his faith in tr?a is:fo:rmi.n.g men on Mao's lines
 (in particular,, in spiritual ov.-,r material incentive),
 his devotion to "struggle" as the principle of all
 progress, and his wi.ll ingness to accept any costs to
 make Mao's vision actual.
 Lice Mao. Lin accepts the principle of making a
 strategic retreat when necessary, while hailing previous
 advances and planning another as soon as possible.   By
 1960 he was associated with a retreat in Mao's domestic
 campaigns, and was praising Mao's willingness to make it.
 Similarly, in the course of the Cultural Revolution he
 has joined Mao in pulling back from confrontations with
 the PLA as a whole in periods of great dependence on it.
 And he has been cautious in .recent; months on the Sino-
 Soviet border dispute.   Nevertheless his predisposition,
 like Mao's, is militant, forcing the human material to
 the limit.

 Lin as a Leader
 As a 1967 psychiatric assessment found, Lin gives
 an impression of rigidity.   He is austere, even bleak.
 Unlike Mao, he does not smoke, drink, or overeat, and
 lives much like a common soldier.   Like Mao, he speaks
 from dogmatic positions, and is self-righteous and
 punitive.   While advocating persuasion, his tendency is
 to deliver lectures and give orders, sometimes more
 harshly than Mao himself.   Like Mao, he can sometimes be
 influenced, but not until he is in trouble.  As the
 psychiatric assessment concluded, he is seclusive,
 suspicious, and distrustful; he believes that everyone
 should be watched all the time.
 Since Mao is always right, Lin is always right.
 While he has proclaimed himself prepared to accept re-
 sponsibility for "mistakes" as later defined by Mao,
 Mao has not in fact blamed him for anything, and Lin has
 held others sInarply responsible, even though they had
 been given impossible tasks or opaque directives.   Like
 Mao, he believes in spi.rit:ual. cleans;;ng--in putting cadres
 through criticism and self-criticism again and again in
 an effort to redeem them.   He himself has made self-
 criticisms, although not in recent years.   While he has
 shown some sympathy from time to time for his military
 comrades, because of the problems they face, like Mao
 he believes in the removal, confinement, or (sometimes)
 execution of those who cannot. be redeemed, and he has
 joined Mao in conducting such purges.
 Despite his role as the successor, he has been a
 generally unsatisfactory source of guidance to his sub-
 ordinates and to the people as a whole.   While this fail-
 ing is attributable in part to Mao's frequent failure tD
 provide clear guidance, Lin too often simply offers Mao's
 "thought" as a bag to find the answer in--"Apply Mao's
 thought in a living way," or "Judge all cadres by their
 adherence to Mao's thought."  Or he points in a given
 direction but does not tell his audience how to get
 there--"Support the Left."  Or he is silent--thus putting
 all of the burden of interpretation on his subordinates
 while he sits back to render judgment on them.

 The evidence, in sum, is that Lin is what Mao be-
 lieves him to be--a reliable "revolutionary successor"
 who will do his best to carry on along Mao's lines.  The
 evidence is not absolutely conclusive, because Lin has
 never operated apart from Mao, but what evidence we have
 points that way.  To conclude otherwise would be to
 judge that Lin for 35 years has been engaged in a com-
 plete deception.
 This is not to say that tin--without Mao--will
 be able to carry on for very long on Mao's lines.   He
 is totally without Mao's charisma while possessing simi-
 lar defects of character.   He lacks control of certain
 key portions of the structure of power while he has al-
 ready alienated some of the military leaders on whom he
 will depend.  Thus he might soon be deposed or at least
 forced to modify, substantially, Mao's policies.  But
 he will begin as a true Maoist radical.

 "In sailing the seas, depend upon the helms-
 man; in making revolution, depend on Mao's
 thought."
 --attributed to Lin Piao
 The Rise to Power, 1928-1959
 A student and protege of Chou En-lai's in the mid-
 1920s, Lin Piao apparently took Mao Tse-tung as his man
 from the moment of meeting him in 1928.   Commanding mili-
 tary units during the establishment and defense of the
 Kia ngsi Soviet (1928-1934), Lin employed the guerrilla
 tactics for which Mao is given credit.   Lin is said to
 have agreed with Mao in those years on the principle of
 party domination of the military and to have stood with
 Mao against other elements of the party and military
 leadership who questioned Mao's policies.  Early in the
 Long March of 1934-35, Lin was among Mao's supporters
 in the showdown with other party leaders which established
 Mao as the dominant figure, and Lin led the troops which
 were victorious in the most important engagement of the
 Long March, the breakthrough to the Northwest.
 Evidence of Mao's confidence in Lin's political
 reliability appeared as early as 1936, when Mao named
 Lin--together with himself--to head the military academy
 it: Yenan.   Early in the Sino-Japanese war, Lin's out-
 numbered forces defeated a good Japanese division in the
 largest engagement the Communists fought during the war.
 Wounded then or in early 1938, Lin was separated from
 Mao for four years while he was under treatment in the
 USSR.   Lin got on very well with the Russians, but, on
 returning to Yenan in 1942, he supported Mao strongly
 in the party "rectification" campaign--a purge and re-
 indoctrination--aimed at party leaders who were closer
 to Moscow than Mao was.  Mao's confidence in Lin in the

 early 1940s is evident in the assignments Mao gave him.
 Lin was an instructor in the "rectification" campaign;
 in 1942, with Mao, he headed the reorganized party school;
 in 1942-43, he was assigned, with Chou En-lai, to negotiate
 with the Chinese Nationalists in Chungking; in 1943 he
 was again made president, and replaced Mao as political
 officer, of the Yenan military academy; and he was elected
 the sixth-ranking member of the central committee in 1945.
 By 1945 Lin was sufficiently recovered from ill-
 ness to take command of the best of the Chinese Communist
 forces for a drive into the Northeast.   He again commanded
 brilliantly, and by 1948 his forces occupied all of the
 Northeast.   Again he got on well with the Russians, but
 his loyalty was still to Mao.   Mao's confidence in Lin
 was expressed again during the Communists' drive into
 South China in 1949, when Lin became the only regional
 military commander to be named concurrently the regional
 party chief.  Praised by the official party history above
 all other military leaders, Lin would probably have been
 named Minister of Defense in 1949 if his health had per-
 mitted.   By the end of 1951 he appeared to be totally
 incapacitated                                        Although          25X6
 he apparently did not return to full-time activity until
 1957, he was named a vice-chairman of the party's Military
 Affairs Committee (MAC) in 1952, and named to the party
 politburo in 1955.
 By spring 1958, when he was named a vice-chairman
 of the party and a member of the politburo standing com-
 mittee (the most important party organ), Lin stood higher
 in the central party leadership than did the then Minister
 of Defense and de facto chairman of the MAC, Peng Te-huai.
 By that time, capable of limited activity, Lin was prob-
 ably working with Mao in asserting some of the doctrines
 and shaping some of the policies which were to prove of-
 fensive to Moscow.   In Lin's field, this entailed a down-
 grading of Soviet military doctrine and prar.tice and the
 imposition of Mao's concepts from guerrilla days as the
 central concepts of strategic doctrine.   It also included
 assignment of major non-military tasks to the armed forces.
 In the summer of 1959 a group led by Peng Te-huai--which
 advocated more orthodox programs of military and economic

 development and compromise in the Sino-Soviet dispute--
 precipitated a showdown.   Lin stood firm with Mao.  Peng
 was purged in September and Mao named Lin Minister of
 Defense and de facto chief of the MAC with the task of
 getting the Ul tTary back into line.  His new assign-
 ments made Lin the regime's dominant military man: and
 one of the top five or six leaders of the party.
 The "Best Pupil," 1959-1965
 On his appointment as Minister of Defense, Lin
 published his first major article.   In it he made clear
 his identification with Mao, defending Mao's principles
 of army-building and army-party relations (especially
 party control and "politics in command"), and pledging
 the PLA's "unconditional" allegiance to Mao personally.
 As Lin was to prove in the Cultural Revolution, Lin's
 loyalty was to Mao personally, rather than to an abstract
 "party."
 Early in 1960 Lin instructed the PLA to memorize
 the most important passages in Mao's works, "even though
 you do not understand them."  (Lin was later, during the
 Cultural Revolution, to issue a similar order with
 respect to Mao's directives.)  Lin at this time began to
 be described as Mao's "best pupil."
 By autumn 1960 Lin was playing a major role in the
 campaign to defend Mao's abiding concepts and to relieve
 Mao of responsibility for the fiasco of the Great Leap
 Forward.  One of Lin's contributions was a review, pub-
 lished in September 1960, of some of Mao's writings, in
 which Lin defended Mao against domestic and foreign
 "revisionists."  Inter alia, Lin endorsed the "paper
 tiger" concept--that the West would be afraid to use its
 nuclear weapons and therefore could be aggressively op-
 posed--and the concomitant article of faith that the
 Communists could attain power in many countries through
 "people's wars" of the Chinese type.
 The strategy for preserving Mao,'s infallibility
 came through most clearly in Lin's military "rectification"

 campaign of 1960-61, in which he introduced a doctrine of
 the "four firsts" hailed as a "creative application" of
 Mao's thought.   These "firsts" made political indoctrina-
 tion the key to success, and made party cadres in the PLA
 fully responsible for transmitting Mao's policies to the
 "masses" and for interpreting the response.   In other
 words, Mao's policies were always correct, and failure
 could come only from stupidity, obstruction, or sabotage.
 This was to prove the rationale for the great purge of
 the party in the Cultural Revolution.
 During the retreat from the extremes of the Leap
 Forward and the commune program, Lin informed the troops
 correctly that Mao's doctrine and practice allowed for
 occasional retreats when forced by the real world to make
 them. He told them, indeed, to study Mao's way of holding
 hard to reality.   And in 1961, Lin himself showed an
 ability to take sensible steps to enhance the regime's
 military-preparedness and to restore PLA morale--such
 measures as giving priority to military training over
 non-military activities, increasing army rations, and
 improving the lot of servicemen's families.  Such adjust-
 ments to reality led some observers to think of Lin as
 a "pragmatic" leader.
 He was, however, a dedicated Maoist.    It was at
 that time (1961) that Lin compiled the selection of quota-
 tions from Mao's works that have since become famous as
 the Little Red Book.

 the "socialist education" campaign soon thereafter, Mao
 was applying to the Chinese society the extreme methods
 of political indoctrination perfected in the PLA under
 Lin since 1960.   And in December 1963 Mao issued his
 explicit call to "learn from the PLA," directing all
 non-military organizations in China to emulate the or-
 ganizational, operational and ideological training
 methods of the PLA.   Lin was out of sight for most of
 the period from 1962 through 1964, but apparently con-
 tributed to the emulation campaign.   By spring 1964 he
 was helping to establish military-type political depart-
 ments in government organs, and was telling the PLA that
 it was hard but essential to understand Mao's thought.
 In June 1964 Mao made known his concern with the
 problem of "revolutionary successors"
 E                    In other words, he declared his inten-
 tion to purge the party---but at a level then uncertain.
 He presumably felt able to do so because he now had a
 solid base of support in Lin's PLA.   Lin remained out of
 sight, reportedly sick, but the build-up of Lin in the
 Chinese press increased.
 It was apparent in early 1965 that party leaders
 had found renewed opposition in the PLA to the emphasis
 on "politics" and its expression in doctrine, organiza-
 tion, and training. Lin, apparently recovered, returned
 to the news in the spring of 1965, and his hand seemed
 visible. in some of the measures taken (e.g., abolition
 of ranks) against "bourgeois" military thought.   The
 task of publicly refuting this opposition was at first
 left to some of Lin's deputies in the MAC who were later
 purged as part of the opposition, but in a long article
 of September 1965 Lin came on strong as Mao's defender
 and exegete.   He again stated his personal identifica-
 tion with Mao's principles of army-building (especially
 the primacy of "politics") and of Mao's concept of "people's
 war" (luring the enemy in deep) for the defense of China.
 Lin also endorsed again the concept of "people's war"
 as an offensive doctrine, asserting that the developed
 areas of the world would eventually be encircled and
 dominated by the under-developed areas, as his own forces

 had surrounded and captured the cities of Northeast China.
 Lin may not have believed everything attributed to him
 in this article, but he was willing to identify himself
 so completely with Mao that he would be doomed if Mao
 were to lose the coming showdown in the party.   At about
 this time, Mao spoke of himself to visitors as a military
 man who took other military men--specifying Lin--as his
 lieutenants.
 The Designated Successor, 1965-66
 In autumn 1965, Lin was among the few party leaders
 informed of Mao's plans for an offensive against his op-
 ponents.   Lin's PLA newspaper took the lead in November
 in describing an anti-Mao play--used as the symbol of
 all opposition;to Mao--as a "poisonous weed," and Lin told
 the PLA that it must regard Mao's works as its "highest
 instructions" in everything.   Lin went south with Mao
 to an East China sanctuary in late November, and he is
 now known to have taken the lead in December in summoning
 there the first group of leaders to be purg;..d.
 In January 1966 Lin again told the PLA that Mao's
 works were supreme directives and that "everything he
 says is the truth."  In February Lin began what was to
 be an ambivalent and difficult relationship with Madame
 Mao as another watchdog over the PLA.   He invited the
 militant Madame to prepare a rationale for a  ur a of the
 PLA.   In the same month,                                 he        25X1
 moved troops into Peking to frustrate t e p ans o         suspect-
 ed conspirators.   Throughout March and April, Lin wrote
 and spoke on the need for an ideological revolution; in
 May, Mao in a letter to Lin ordered the PLA to "play a
 very great role" in this revolution, and revealed his
 concept of the new Chinese man as an omnicompetent':
 worker-peasant-soldier. Also in May Lin made the key
 speech at a party conference which officially launched
 the Cultural Revolution and confirmed that a purge of
 the party and of the PLA was underway.   Describing Mao
 as the greatest of all Communists, the man who "always

 understands" and is always right, Lin again threatened
 Mao's opponents, many of whom he knew to be present.
 In the early summer, PLA cadres were used to guide
 and incite extremist students conducting the "revolution"
 in the schools.  After Liu Shao-chi and others had fallen
 into Mao's trap by attempting to suppress this Maoist
 initiative, a central committee plenum met in August and
 under duress approved Mao's plans for an official Cul-
 tural Revolution and Mao's choice of Lin Piao as "deputy
 supreme commander of the entire party."  Again Lin made
 the main speed:, showing himself to be identified absolutely
 with Mao, to think of himself entirely as Mao's instrument,
 and to be ready to take the blame for "mistakes" that were
 really Mao's.   Lin called for all party cadres to be
 judged on the criteria of whether they were or were not
 avid students of Mao's thought, devoted to ideological-
 political work, and militant activists.   He said again
 that there was much in Mao's lofty thought he could
 not understand, but that he would nevertheless carry out
 Mao's directives, asking for clarifying "instructions"
 on everything but recognizing that he would inevitably
 make "mistakes" for which he must accept the responsi-
 bility.   This line soon appeared in simplified form as
 an exhortation to the PLA--to carry out Mao's policies
 "whether we understand them or not."
 In the same week, Lin told PLA leaders that the
 PLA was to be judged by the same harsh standards applied
 to the party.   In yet another speech, he associated him-
 self emphatically with Mao's long-range vision of "trans-
 forming men's souls," and of developing productivity by
 this means rather than by providing material incentive.
 He said he recognized opposition to this approach, and
 made clear that he was also prepared to use-force if
 necessary. On another occasion Lin defined political
 power as primarily the "power to suppress."
 Lin spoke for Mao at the mid-August rally which
 unveiled the Red Guards as an instrument for attacking the
 party apparatus, and spoke again at the next two rallies.
 Lin was militant on all three occasions, telling the
 revolutionary young to use Mao's thought as their guide

 for discovering Mao's opponents, whom they were then to
 strike down.   By mid-September, Lin was telling military
 audiences that Mao's works should constitute "99 percent"
 of Communist classics, and that Mao was the world's
 "supreme genius" and the greatest man known to history.
 Calling on military schools to purge themselves, he-again
 presented Mao's thought as the only beacon needed for
 such an exercise.   Events were soon to prove that such
 guidance was insufficient.
 Purging and Relying_ on the PLA, 1966-67
 In October 1966, Lin made further  re arations for
 a large-scale  ur a of the PLA.
 -At the
 same time, a special group was set up to conduct this
 purge, and Lin--again to please Mao--named or accepted
 Madame Mao as the dominant figure of this group.   Lin at
 this time, praised the accomplishments of the Cultural
 Revolution in intensifying Mao-study, exposing Mao's
 opponents, revclutionizing Chinese society on Mao's
 lines, and producing reliable "revolutionary successors."
 Lin in late October again made the main speech to
 a top-level party meeting.   Speaking authoritatively and
 without apology as Mao's first lieutenant, Lin again
 praised the Cultural Revolution and the role of violence
 in it, and outlined Mao's plans for continuing the revo-
 lution.   Lin again stated strongly his identification
 with Mao's longer term objective of creating a new, self-
 less party cadre to build a new Chinese society.
 In November, the militant Madame Mao began. to ques-
 tion whether Lin's PLA was "loyal" to Mao, and Lin allowed
 her to take the public lead at this time In purging the
 PLA.   She began by attacking Lin's senior deputy on the
 MAC, and Lin soon joined in.-,  In the next few weeks Lin
 and the Madame purged several high-ranking officers of
 the central military leadership--including the chief of

 the PLR's special group. for the conduct of the purge--and
 several of the top officers of the regional military com.
 mands.   Most of these men had probably resisted the Revo-
 lution as charged, and Lin proved willing to sacrifice
 them even though some were old comrades.
 In mid-January 1967 the PLA newspaper suggested
 strongly that the p4!r; a of the PLA still had a long way
 to go in order to make it "truly loyal" to Mao.  Within
 a week, however, Mao's recognition of the inability of
 the Red Guards to replace the existing party apparatus
 made it necessary to send the PLA into action as an in-
 strument of the Revolution and thus to postpone any
 further purge of it.
 On 23 January the PLA was ordered to support the
 "genuine" leftists and was authorized to use force against
 force.   In other words, t'-t.? PLA was to install the young
 Maoists as the supervisors of new revolutionary organs
 of power (first called "communes") and to restore order.
 Within a few days, Mao and Lin directed the modulation
 of the Cultural Revolution the PLA itself, clearly to
 avoid further disruption in their essential power base.
 Lin himself emphasized the task of supporting the
 Left, but he again, as with the Red Guards earlier, failed
 to provide clear guidance.   In practice, the PLA moved
 quickly to restore order and to become a de facto govern-
 ing apparatus in the name of the Left.   In February, Peking
 called for a new type of governing apparatus:  the forma-
 tion of "revolutionary committees" composed of PLA of-
 ficers, acceptable party cadres and representatives of
 mass organizations, which would act as provisional organs
 of power at all levels.
 By March, it was evident to Mao and Lin that the
 PLA had not, in general, acted as a revolutionary force.
 Lin himself apparently went on an inspection tour in
 March, and concluded that the PLA was mishandling the
 young revolutionaries.   In late March he again told mili-
 tary audien^es that great disorder was necessary to bring
 down Mao's opponents and produce reliable "successors,"
 and that authority was being withdrawn from the PIA; PLA

 units were to act only on orders from above.   This was
 the first of several times in the Cultural Revolution
 that Lin was to rebuke and restrict the PLA for taking
 conservative positions.
 Lin at this time first expressed displeasure with
 compilations of passages from his speeches on the ground
 that they falsely gave an impression that he had a body
 of thought apart from Mao's.  He also admitted that his
 health was bad and that neurological damage restricted
 his activity.   Peking no longer admits this.
 Durii.g the spring of 1967, a period of greatly
 increased disorder following the restriction of the PIA,
 Lin sometimes showed some sympathy for the military men,
 but he continued to make clear that his first loyalty was
 to Mao.  For example, he named to key positions some of
 his close military colleagues who had been denounced by
 radical Red Guard groups, and he defended others against
 Red Guard attacks, but he did not appoint or defend any-
 one in Mao's disfavor.   Similarly, he criticized the
 excesses of mass organizations as well as unauthorized
 actions by some military region leaders, and in June he
 gave the PLA responsibility for putting an end to various
 Red Guard offenses; but if he attempted to induce Mao to
 give the PLA authority commensurate with this respon-
 sibility, he failed.
 Lin and the PLA Crises, 1967-1968
 Lin responded quickly and harshly, in summer 1967
 and again in spring 1968, to two affronts to Mao by PLA
 leaders.   In both periods, renewed violence by mass or-
 ganizations and representations from PLA leaders caused
 Lin to moderate his threats to the PLA, but in both periods
 Lin made clear that he favored a hard, Maoist line in
 shaping up the military establishment and rebuilding the
 party.
 The first affront came in mid-July 1967, following
 a decision to send delegations around China to settle

 local arguments.  The Wuhan commander refused to accept
 instructions sent by Madame Mao and permitted certain
 mass organizations to beat and detain members of the dele-
 gation.   The central leaders recalled and purged the of-
 fending officers and called for the purge of an addition-
 al bad "handful" in the PLA.
 Lin was a part of this tough response.   In a speech
 to regional military leaders assembled in Peking in early
 August, he reiterated his favor for creative "disorder,"
 warned them against emulating the Wuhan commander, and
 called on all military leaders to admit and correct their
 mistakes.  He told them that mass organizations would be
 classified not in terms of their attitude toward the PLA
 but solely on the basis of whether they supported Mao or
 not.   He emphasized that the military were to get instruc-
 tions from central party leaders, not act on their own.
 On the same day, Lin acted on Madame Mao's call to "arm
 the leftists"--i.e., to give arms to selected mass or-
 ganizations which might use them against the PLA.
 In supplementary gestures of loyalty to Mao at
 that time, Lin ended press references to the "thought of
 Lin Piao," purged one of his own longtime proteges (Hsiao
 Hua) who headed the General Political Department, and
 made Mao's daughter the acting editor of the PLA news-
 paper.
 As mass violence rapidly increased, Mao and Lin
 were forced to retreat.   That is, they were forced to
 recognize again their dependence on the PLA, and they
 took measures calculated to please military leaders.
 They dropped Madame Mao--the worst friend of the .PIA--
 from the special group conducting-~the "revolution".in
 the PLA.   They formed another group to assist military
 units in handling mass organizations, and named a non-
 radical to head it.  They used Madame Mao to reverse
 and repudiate the line of late July and early August
 which had threatened the PLA with another large-scale
 purge.   They gave the PLA a new directive authorizing it
 to use force against some kinds of offenses.  And they
 purged some second-level civilian figures who had been
 heavily involved with radical mass organizations which
 had harassed- the PLA.

 By November, however, Mao had begun to worry again
 --as in spring 1967--about the fate cif his young revolu-
 tionaries, and Madame Mao made two speeches which were
 taken, not unreasonably, as justjif ying a resumption of
 violence and of attacks on the PLA.   Lin did not r'4rectly
 incite the young militants, but during the winter he
 reminded the PLA that he endorsed Mao's advocacy of
 "Struggle" in all aspects of life and that he would never
 let "personal friendships" stand in the way of the revo-
 lution.   He also told three new political security organs
 set up by the MAC that their tasks were to saturate the
 PLA with Mao's thought and to investigate the PLA's
 leaders once again, as the central party leaders did not
 know whom they could trust.   In this connection, Lin
 told another audience that they could trust nobody--that
 all cadres should be placed under constant observation.
 The second affront to Mao arising from the PLA
 came in March 1968. In a case which is still puzzling,
 Yang Cheng-wu, Lin's chief-of-staff and the MAC-level
 supervisor of all political security organs in the PLA,
 was suddenly purged as a "rightist".   The immediate cause
 of his fall was allegedly his effort to arrest some un-
 known persons whom Madame Mao put under her protection.
 Lin was again quick to throw his old comrades and proteges
 to the wolves when they had come into Mao's disfavor..
 Despite the overwhelming record of his fidelity to Mao
 and of Mao's confidence in him, Lin may have been worried
 about his own position.   In the late March meeting which
 surfaced the affair, Lin dissociated himself from Yang
 and was obsequiously deferential to Madame Mao.  Yang
 was replaced by another longtime protege of Lin's who,
 although representative of conservative military men, was
 regarded by both Mao and Lin as loyal.
 Following the purge of Yang and two other senior
 officers charged as confederates, Lin was prominent in the
 new offensive against the "rightists".   With Madame Mao
 and others, he sharply criticized certain military lead-
 ers for conservative attitudesrtbw&rd mass organizations.
 Lin even returned to the theme--discredited since the
 previous September--of the need for a further purge of
 the PLA.

 Again, however, as in January 1967 and spring
 1967, the young revolutionaries of mass organizations
 went too far.  By July, violence was so widespread, and
 the young were so scornful of directives, that Mao and
 Lin together--possibly pressed by PLA leaders--cracked
 down hard.  Lin relayed the order to PLA commanders
 which permitted them to suppress and dismantle the most
 violent and disruptive of the mass organizations.  Lin
 did not suffer, however, for having acted in general
 as a protector of mass organizations.   That had been
 Mao's position too.
 With the last of the provincial "revolutionary
 committees" formed rapidly, in orderly conditions, in
 August and September, Lin spoke for Mao on National Day
 (1 October).  He defined the main task of the next stage
 as that of carrying out "struggle-criticism-transforma-
 tion" throughout China.  Most important were the con-
 solidation of the "revolutionary committees," the con-
 tinuing purge of the lower levels of the party, and the
 rebuilding of the party in accordance with Mao's call to
 "take in new blood."
 Later in October, a central committee plenum pro-
 claimed that Mao's various guidelines and Lin's exegeses
 in the course of the Cultural Revolution had been "en-
 tirely correct."  Lin--again out-Maoing Mao--described
 the losses suffered in the Revolution as "very, very
 trifling, and the gains as "very, very great."  The
 plenum drafted a new party constitution which provided
 for Lin to become Mao's successor without an election,
 thus testifying both to Mao's continuing favor for Lin
 and to his lack of confidence that Lin could win the
 position through election.
 The Ninth Congress and-After, 1969
 In the early months of 1969, prior to the Ninth
 Party Congress, it became apparent that the Maoists in
 Peking were dissatisfied with the operations of the
 "revolutionary committees" throughout China.  The PLA
 commanders and political officers who dominated most of

 these committees were being excessively coercive toward
 the mass organizations and insufficiently attentive to
 the rehabilitated party cadres.  In other words, the
 military were mishandling both of the other components
 of the revolutionary committees, and the whole process
 of rebuilding the party was going badly.
 The Ninth Congress in April was billed as a con-
 gress for "unity and victory."                         Mao opened the session
 with a speech on the need for "unity."  Lin, as the
 designated successor, made the main report, expressing
 confidence that the great majority could be unified
 against a handful of enemies.  As Lin saw it, however,
 the main practical problem was to ensure that the re-
 constructed party leadership at all levels was in the
 hands of true Maoists.   It is uncertain whether Lin
 realized that his statement of the problem implied a
 renewed emphasis on the role of revolutionary mass or-
 ganizations at the expense of the PLA.   The published
 report did not indicate that he did.   In fact, the
 report as a whole was defensive, vague, and unhelpful,
 seemingly a poor show for the successor.
 The new central committee that emerged from the
 Congress was large and fairly representative of the new
 structure of power. It named Mao and Lin as its only
 officers and selected a new politburo.   The 21 full
 (voting) members of the new politburo seemed to fall
 into three groups:  "Mao's" group of eight (including
 Lin as the only military figure), all of them people
 who had been closely associated throughout the Cultural
 Revolution and identified with its excesses; a ".eilitary"
 group of six active military leaders, who could also be
 regarded as "Lin's" group because all six had long been
 given special signs of Lin's favor; and an "unaligned"
 group of seven government leaders and inactive elders
 around Chou En-lai.  Although Mao's group and Lin's mili-
 tary group dominated the politburo, there was a balance
 in the politburo in terms of predisposition to radical
 policies versus predisposition to conservative ones, with
 some of Lin's proteges among the conservatives.   The
 Maoist radicals had only a narrow edge if any.   The
 radicals did much better in the politburo standing com-
 mittee, charged with directing the party's daily work.

 It consists of four Maoist radicals (including Mao and
 Lin) and one relative moderate (Chou).
 There was room for improvement in Lin's position
 with respect to central party organs.  The politburo as
 a whole was hardly an embodiment of "unity"; apart from
 differences in temperament between the civilian radicals
 and the military men, organizations dominated by the
 civilians had often been in actual conflict with organi-
 zations dominated by the military, and there was bad
 feeling between them.   The politburo standing committee
 was dominated by radicals like Lin but Lin himself was
 the only Lin-mate on it, and it was the standing committee
 that was to set up the rest of the central party appara-
 tus, including the political security organs.  It was
 uncertain whether Lin could shape as he wished the party
 apparatus which he was to inherit.
 After the Ninth Congress
 Lin began to play a
 role in implementing a policy stated by. Mao to the first
 plenum of the new central committee.   In this late April
 speech, Mao in effect subverted the cause of "unity" by
 once again upgrading the role of revolutionary mass oi-
 ganizAtions, despite all the trouble they had got him
 into.  Mao apparently asserted that conflicts among mass
 organizations and among the leaders of revolutionary com-
 mittees could be resolved by more political indoctrina-
 tion, that the PLA component dominating most of the re-
 volutionary committees should not use coercion against
 the civilian components, and that more representatives
 of mass organizations should be taken into the committees
 and into their party core groups.
 While Mao and Lin were off together at a resort in
 summer 1969, re-emphasis on the role of the masses led
 again to an increase in factional violence and to the
 disruption of the revolutionary committees and the process
 of party-rebuilding.  In August and September, Peking's
 concern about the possibility of a Soviet attack apparently
 led to a decision to authorize the PLA to use the neces-
 sary force to restore public order.  However, the party
 press has since made clear that Mao and Lin remain deter-
 mined to upgrade the role of the revolutionary masses

 in the revolutionary (committees and their party core
 groups, despite the certainty of further disruption.
 In Lin's October 1 National Day pronouncement, he again
 called for carrying the Cultural Revolution through to
 the end, and made clear that he remained committed to
 the full range of Mao's objectives.
