 Hua Kuo-feng at the National Science Conference yesterday which '_s entitled:   "Raise the
 Scientific and Cultural Level of the Entire Chinese Nation":
 This National Science Conference convened by the Central Committee of our party has been
 in session for seven days.  At the opening session, Comrade Teng Hsiao-ping made a
 speech and Comrade Fang I delivered a report,, both' being very important and very good.
 Comrades attending the conference have discussed them in earnest and ha7e all expressed
 hearty support.  Everyone is greatly encouraged, in high spirits and free from anxiety.
 A national plan for the development of science and technology will be worked out and
 advanced collectives and individuals on the scientific and techn4cal front will be com-
 mended at this conference.  We are all fully confident that the conference will be a
 great success and have a tremendous and far-reaching impact on the development of our
 science and culture, the growth of our national economy and the building of a modern,
 powerful socialist state.
 The Central Committee attaches great importance to this conference.  Shortly after it
 smashed the anti-party "gang of four" of Siang Hung-wen, Chang Chan-chiao, Chiang Ching
 and Yao Wen-yuan, it convened the Second National Conference on Learning from Tachai in
 Agriculture and later the National Conference on Learning from Taching in Industry.  At
 the same time the Central Committee was considering the convocation of a science confer-
 ence after those on agriculture and industry.  We officially announced this decision in
 the political report to the eleventh party congress.  Then the Central Committee issued
 a circular on this to the whole party and the whole country.  This is the first time in
 the history of our party and our People's Republic that the party Central Committee con-
 vened a conference of such a gigantic scale and broad representation in order to mobilize
 the whole party, the whole army and the people of all nationalities throughout the country
 to march toward the modernization of science and technology.  It is an important measure
 adopted by our party to carry out the general task for the new period in our country's
 socialist revolution and socialist construction.  Ours is a conference of tremendous
 immediate and historical significance.
 Our country has basically eliminated the chaos created by the "gang of four" and is moving
 toward great order across the land.  This has come about through a great, deep-going
 political revolution aimed at exposing and repudiating the "gang of four''  during the last
 year or so, through the collective efforts of the party and the people on the political,
 economic, military and cultural fronts and through the several historic conferences for
 carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and forging ahead into the future--the eleventh
 party congress, the Fifth National People's Congress and the meeting of the Fifth National
 Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,  Now, the line and
 the general task for the new period have been clearly formulated.  The new constitution
 has been promulgated.  The fundamental tasks and policies for various areas of work, tip
 three-year and eight-year plans and a 23 year outline for the development of the national
 economy have been mapped out.

 NATIONAL AFFAIRS
 Although some detailed regulations, policies and plans still need to be worked out or improved,
 our major political guideline, namely, grasping the key link of class struggle to bring
 great order across the land, has in the main been set.  What is required at present is to
 follow the line, policies and plans already laid down and to do solid work, keep our shoulder
 to the wheel, eliminate interference, surmount difficulties and fulfill the tasks before us
 step by step.
 The general task laid down for the whole party and the whole people in the new period by
 the eleventh party congress and the Fifth National People's Congress has been written into
 the fundamental law of the state.  The task is:   Steadfastly continue-the revolution under-
 the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry on the three great revolutionary movements of
 class struggle, the struggle for production and scientific experiment, and transform China
 into a great, powerful socialist country with modern agriculture, industry, national defence
 and science and technology by the end of the Century.  It shows that we must follow the
 road of socialism unswervingly, grasp the three great revolutionary movements simultaneously
 and accomplish the splendid goal of the four modernizations.  The world has. witnessed different
 roads to modernization.  There is capitalist or imperialist modernization and revisionist
 or social-imperialist modernization.  What we want is socialist modernization, to be attained
 by steadfastly continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.  Only
 this kind of modernization conforms to the common aspirations and the fundamental interests
 of the people of all our nationalities.  Only this can bring genuine happiness to our people
 and cause people the world over to rejoice.
 Socialism is the only way out for China.  This was proved long ago by hard realities.  In
 old semi-colonial, semi-feudal China, many persons with lofty ideals sought to develop
 science in China and make the country independent, strong and prosperous, but they all
 failed.  Not until the Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country in
 winning complete victory in the new democratic revolution and in establishing the socialist
 system did China build a fairly modern industrial base, which provides the conditions for
 going on to the four modernizations.  The "gang of four" were sworn enemies of socialism.
 They opposed the four modernizations in a criminal attempt to subvert the dictatorship of
 the proletariat and restore capitalism.  If China were to follow the counter-revolutionary
 revisionist line of the "gang of four," the country could only degenerate into a colony
 or semi-colony of social-imperialism and imperialism.  To achieve the four modernizations,
 independent, socialist China must adhere to Chairman Mao's thought and steadfastly continue
 the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, which means sticking to the
 socialist road.  For us, socialism and the four modernizations are inseparable from each
 other.   Only by persevering in socialist revolution and continuing to transform that part
 of the superstructure and the relations of production not in correspondence with the growth
 of the productive forces can we constantly promote the four modernizations.  Only by building
 a modern agriculture, industry, national defence and science and technology can we provide
 our socialist system with a powerful material base, steadily consolidate and develop the
 system, effectively defeat capitalism at home and be in a stronger position to resist aggression
 by social-imperialism and imperialism from abroad.
 The general task for the new period calls for hard work in every field by the whole party,
 the whole army and the people of all our nationalities.  Here i would like to go into-one
 question in particular, namely, the necessity for greatly raising the scientific and cultural
 level of the entire Chinese nation.

 Ths people of all nationalities in our country are industrious, brave' and rich in
 creative talent.  Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought, our
 people have acquired many highly valuable capabilities in revolution and construction,
 performed great deeds and made tremendous progress in the course of their long and
 arduous struggle.. Now, we must start a new and sustained study movement in order to
 extend our bat 1.: with nature, march toward the four modernizations and fulfill the
 general task history has assigned us for this new period.  It is necessary to raise the
 study of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought to a new level and, at the same time,
 strive to improve our general educational level, acquire modern scientific knowledge
 and master the work skills and methods of management which are indispensable to modern,
 production.  Raising the scientific and cultural level of the entire Chinese nation
 is a colossal task facing all our people.  It is a task of strategic importance.  Unless
 it is accomplished, our general task for the new period cannot be fulfilled.
 The ?gang of four" willfully undermined our socialist undertakings in science and
 culture, even babbling such nonsense as "the more knowledgeable, the more reactionary"
 and "labourers with no culture are preferable".  They were'a fascist cultural autocracy,
 sinister and rotten to the core.  Their disruption dampened the enthusiasm of the
 scientific and cultural workers and the masses, so that our s- , ientific and cultural
 undertakings are far from meeting the needs of our socialist revolution and construction,
 and the gap between science and technology in China and advanced world levels, which was
 narrowing at one time, widened again.  This teaches us by negative example that raising
 the scientific and cultural level of the people is not a matter solely of imparting
 knowledge but is a great class struggle.  We must carry through to the end the struggle
 to expose and criticize the "gang of four", eliminate the pernicious influence of their
 counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and clear the way for raising the scientific
 and cultural level of the entire Chinese nation.                             -
 It is in the vital interest of hundreds of millions of people to raise the scientific
 and cultural level of the entire Chinese nation.  This can be achieved only by drawing
 in and relying on vast numbers of people, only by effectively organizing all the people
 on all fronts on a countryside scale.  What we need is thousands upon thousands of
 skilled workers, skilled peasants and other skilled working people with socialist
 consciousness and the ability to master modern production techniques, enon ous numbers
 of revolutionary intellectuals in all trades and professions and revolutionary cadres
 well versed in methods of management in the fields of modern economy and modern science
 and technology.  We need a mighty force in industry, agriculture, science and technology,
 culture and national defence--people who are both Red and expert and who can take on a
 good fight.  It won't do to have only a small number or a section of the people; hundreds
 of millions of people, the entire Chinese nation, must reach a much higher level.
 Obviously, workers who are lacking in scientific and cultural knowledge and who fail to
 learn new production skills can hardly master modern industrial production processes.
 Rural peoplets commune members who are lacking in scientific and cultural knowledge,
 who do not know how to use power, machinery, chemical fertilizer, insecticides, etc.
 or have no knowledge of scientific farming, cannot cope with modern agriculture.  PLA
 commanders and fighters who lack knowledge of modern military science and techniques
 cannot use modern arms and equipment and cannot succeed in organizing and directing
 modern war.   On the other hand, if hundreds of millions of people grasp such knowledge
 and skill, they will become competent workers, peasants and arymen, and moreover large
 numbers of technical specialists, innovators, inventors and scientists s--_11 emerge
 from among them.

 We should, therefore pay great attention to raising the scientific and cultural level of
 the whole nation.  The modernization of science and technology should not be regarded
 as a matter only for scientific and technological organizations, nor should it be left
 to a few people in research institutions or universities.  The most powerful base and
 inexhaustible source-of strength for the modernization of science and technology in
 our country is the masses of the people in their hundreds of millions who, fired with
 enthusiasm,  are determined to eliminate blind faith, emancipate their minds, cast off
 the sense of inferiority, call up the courage to break new ground, dare to think, speak
 and act, and exert themselves in study and work.
 While we stress the need to rely upon the masses in their hundreds of millions, we must
 also make vigorous efforts to expand our contingent of professional scientists and
 technicians. We already have a Red and expert contingent that belongs to the working
 class. We should unite all revolutionary patriotic scientific and technical workers.
 Effective measures should be taken to train new forces and expand the professional
 contingent quickly.  It is necessary to raise the level of the professionals and produce
 many scientists and technicians will keep raising their political consciousness, serve
 socialism wholeheartedly and integrate with the workers, peasants and soldiers while
 at the same time devoting themselves to their professional work, constantly improving
 their capabilities, combining personal effort with collective wisdom and striving to
 reach the summits of science and technology.  We also hope that more and more people
 will have a better understanding of Marxism and firmly establish a proletarian.,
 communist world outlook through studying Marxist theory and through class struggle and
 practical work.  When that happens, we will be speaking a common language, in terms
 not only of patriotism and the socialist system but increasingly of the communist world
 outlook.   The professional contingent is the vanguard and the core in raising the
 scientific and cultural level of the entire Chinese nation.  It has the duty of taking
 the strongholds of science and technology and popularizing scientific and technological
 knowledge among the people.
 Our people's armed forces have always had a system under which there is a "three-in-one"
 combination of the field armies, the regional forces and the militia, forming a great
 bastion in people's war.   This should be applied also in scientific and technical fields:
 The hundreds of millions of people who are making a serious study of science and culture
 can be likened to a vast militia force on the fronts of science and technology, while
 the ranks of professionals are like the field armies and the regional forces.  A general
 rise in the level of the masses will provide the base and conditions for growth for the
 professionals, who for their part, will guide the mass forces, crystallize their experi-
 ence and wisdom and raise it to a higher level.   This should be the system under which
 our country's scientific and technical forces operate; it is the road to victory through
 people's war on these fronts.  Advancing our science and culture is a people's cause.
 By spreading scientific and cultural knowledge to raise the level of the entire nation,
 combining popularization with the raising of standards and integrating professional with
 mass forces, we will form a mighty army for science and culture and greatly speed our
 socialist modernization.
 The education of young people is another very important aspect that merits special
 attention in connection with raising the scientific and cultural level of the entire
 Chinese nation.  The young people are our successors in the proletarian revolutionary
 cause.

 Stax'ting from an early age, they should develop themselves physically, establish communist
 values and work style and show heroism in the interests of the collective.  They should
 also cultivate, from an early age, the good habit of loving, studying and using science.
 J'=^  prrt;- and our state must show particular concern for the healthy growth of the young
 people, make a good job of running primary and middle schools, universities and other
 types of schools at various levels, open all kinds of new channels for study, create the
 conditions for bringing up the young people as labourers who have both socialist con-
 scienousness and culture, and constantly train from among them scientific and technical
 personnel who are both politically sound and profession-ally competent.  ".s talented young
 people appear in large numbers,  Our sc.znce and technology will flourish.
 The task of raising the scientific and cultural level of the entire Chinese nation
 involves higher demands on our cadres, first of all on leading cadres at all levels.
 Chairman Mao taught us   "Conditions are changing all the time, and to adapt one2s thinking
 to the new conditions, one must study..  Even those who have a better grasp of Marxism
 and are comparatively firm in. their proletarian stand-have to go on studying, have to
 absorb what is new and study new problems."  Leadingorgans and cadres at all levels
 should be good at adapting themselves to the requirements of our developing socialist
 modernization program3e and must improve their methods of leadership and of work.  Far
 from being weakened, political and ideological work should be strdngthem_ed in the new
 period of development in our socialist revolution and construction.  Our party has fine
 traditions in political .and ideologicai work; ?ro should carry them forward and eliminate ..
 the pernicic... influence of Lin Piao and z;he '-gang of four".  We should do our po'! _t;ical
 and ideological  :ork more carefully and precisely so that we constantly prevail over the

 an important guarantee for qur socialist modernization.' Politics is the commander, the
 soul in everything, and it won't do not to grasp political and ideological work; but
 neit.. r will it do if we concern ourselves solely with politics and rem: : 12ayme n, withcu;;
 any knowledge of technological and professional work. . Chairman Mao taught us in -'? 1
 earnestness in 1958:   "We must exert ourselves, we must study and carry through to the
 end this great technological revolution which history has assigned us,  this question
 should be brought up for discussion among the cadres, and a cadre conference should be
 called to discuss what else we have in the way of capabilities.  In the past we had the
 capabilities of waging war and carrying out land reform, but these capabilities alone are
 not enough now.  We must acquire new ones and achieve a real understanding of professional
 ~.ork, of science and technology, or we cannot possibly exercise effective leadership."
 Following Ct-iairman.Mao's instructions, quite a number of our comrades have pitched in
 and obtained very good results in their study.  On the other hand, there are scue co =ades
 who have failed to understand the profound significance of Chairman Mao's instructions.
 Moreover, when Lin Piao and the "gang of four" were engaged in disruption and sabotage,
 dishing up all sorts of fallacies and creating much confusion, they supp-essed or
 attacked all those who pay.-" attention to professional work or production, and it was out
 of the question for anyone  ericasly to tackle modern science or technology.  Now many
 cadres have emancipated their ninris and are diligently studying politics, economics, nil.tart-
 affairs, professional work and tr hnology, and the situation is most enzataraging.  Cadres
 at all levels in various professic:.- and '        should do the same.

 comrades must do well in all these respects and ensure the comprehensive and correct
 implementation of the party's line, principles and policies so as to make new contributions
 to our socialist revolution and socialist construction.
 In order to raise the scientific and cultural level of our nation, it is necessary to
 reiterate Chairman i?Iao's slogan on learning from foreign countries.  Our principle is to
 learn the strong points of all nations and countries, to learn from them all that is truly
 good in politics, economics, military affairs, science, technology, literature and art.
 While upholding independence and self-reliance, we shall learn from,other countries
 analytically and critically.  We have always opposed the slavish cq'prador philosophy
 which holds that anything foreign is good, while nothing Chinese is, any good, fancying
 that even the moon looks better over foreign lands and that China can only creep along
 in the wake of other countries.  The "gang of four," for their own reasons, slandered
 our effort to learn from foreign countries as "slavish comprador philosophy".  This was
 nothing but turning matters upside down and confusing right and wrong.  Their parpose
 was to create counter-revolutionary public opinion so that they could usurp all party and
 state power and overthrow the central leading comrades who correctly followed Chairman
 Mao's principle of learning from foreign countries.  If we indiscriminately refused to
 learn anything from foreign countries, China would remain backward forever.  What socialist
 thodernization could one speak of then?  It is obvious that all the world=s nations and
 countries have strong points and weak.   They should learn from one another, drawing on
 the strong points of others to make up for their own weak points, so as to make steady
 progress.  Can we refuse to study Marxism because its birthplace was in the West?  Can
 we refuse to learn from the Great October Socialist Revolution because it took place in
 Russia?  As for natural science and technology, we are behind advanced world level:.  We
 admit our backwardness but we refuse to stay backward.  We must catch up.  We must, therefore,
 be good at absorbing whatever is valuable in things foreign, take them and turn them to
 our own use, and combine our learning from foreign countries with our owr_ inventiveness
 so that we can catch up with and surpass advanced world levels as soon as possible.  We
 should learn from foreign countries now, but should we do so when we overcome our back-
 wardness and become advanced?  Yes, because even then other countries will still have
 points worth learning, and we should still study them.  What is wrong : rith that? After
 ten thousand years, we -must still learn from others!
 The first eight years are the key to accomplishing the four modernizations in 23 years,
 that is, by the year 2000.  This is true also for raising the scientific and cultural
 level of the entire Chinese nation.  We should draft plans for the next three and the
 next eight years and an outline for 23 years.  From now on, we should encourage diligent
 efforts throughout society to study politics, raise the level of education and learn
 science and technology.  Science means honest, solid knowledge and allo..rs no.hypocrisy
 and complacency.

 Only with honesty, modesty and perseverance can one learn something.   It is imperative
 that all our people develop the habit of studying hard.   Conscientious study should be
 regarded as an honour, and refusal to study, as shameful.   To be Red and expert should
 be regarded as an honour and refusal to make progress, as shameful.   Hard work and
 contributing more to socialism is honourable, while easy living, refusing to work and
 living off socialism are shameful.   Our entire country should be turned into a great
 school.
 A great rise in the scientific and cultural level of the entire Chinese nation is a
 prerequisite for the four modernizations. We should look at its significance in a wider,
 deeper and farther perspective.
 As the scientific and cultural level of the entire nation rises, we shall be able to use
 Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought still better to arm the cadres and the masses.   In
 natural science, neither theory nor experimentation can be cut off from materialism and
 dialectics. We should urge all research workers in natural science to matte conscious use
 of the Marxist world outlook to guide their work, and at the same'time to spread material-
 ism and dialectics far and wide among the masses through study or science and technology
 and participation in scientific experiments.   Marxism has its source in the totality of
 human knowledge.  Marx drew critically on all the knowledge provided by previous science
 to confirm his revolutionary conclusions. That is why raising the scientific and technical
 level is very important for studying Marxism well, and for a more profound comprehension
 and application of Marxism.
 Raising the scientific and cultural level of the whole nation will help activate the
 masses to participate in managing the economic, cultural and educational undertakings
 as well as affairs of state.   It will help extend socialist democracy in the political
 life of the country.   Lenin said on this point:   "We are perfectly aware of the effects
 of Russia's cultural underdevelopment, of what it is doing to Soviet power--which in
 principle has provided an immensely higher proletarian democracy, which has created a
 model of such democracy for the whole world--how this lack of culture is reducing the
 significance of Soviet power and revising bureaucracy. The Soviet apparatus is accessible
 to all the working people in word, but actually it is far from being accessible to all
 of them, as we all know.   And not because the laws prevent it from being so, as was the
 case under the bourgeoisie; on the contrary, our laws assist in this respect.  But in
 this matter laws alone are not enough. A vast amount of educational, organizational and
 cultural work is required."  How profound are these words of Lenin's:  The task we set
 today of raising the scientific and cultural level of the entire nation is closely re-
 lated to a full development of socialist democracy.
 In socialist society, we have to create the conditions for gradually narrowing the
 differences between town and country, between industry and agriculture, between manual
 and mental labour. From a long-term point of view, tremendously raising the scientific
 and cultural level of the entire nation means training hundreds of millions of working
 people who have both socialist consciousness and culture. They are the kind of working
 people  who are politically conscious and are educated too, who can combine mental
 labour with manual labour, who are both Red and expert, and who have an all-round develop-
 merit, people who are both worker-intellectuals and intellectual-workers. This is the
 direction for our advance.
 Comrades, on the eve of the founding of new China, our great leader Chairman Mao said:
 "We can learn what we did not know. We are not only good at destroying the old world, we
 are also good at building the new."   What we  are engaged in now is this great cause of
 building a new world.

 Our country has a long history of thousands of years.   Our nation once created a splendid
 science and culture.   In the last few hundred years, owing to the oorruption of the feudal
 system and aggression by colonialists and imperialists, science and culture fell behind
 in our country.   Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, with its advanced
 socialist system and under the leadership of the Communist Party, there has been rapid
 progress of science and culture in our country.   The economic and technical blockade
 enforced by imperialism failed to strangle us; the tearing up of contracts and withdrawal
 of specialists by Soviet revisionism failed to subdue us.   We have developed our science
 and technology independently through our own efforts.   Have we not made our own atom
 bombs, hydrogen bombs and man-made satellites?   Have we not trained a contingent of
 outstanding scientific and technological workers who are both Red and expert?
 Our people have deep respect for the many scientists who have made important contributions
 to science and technology in China, including the -late Comrades Li Ssu-kuang and Chu
 Ko-chen.   Facts past and present show that we Chinese have a head and two hands just ],ike
 others and are no stupider than they.   The key lies in the correctsline.   The develop-
 ment of science and technology in China has been delayed and frustrated owing to dis-
 ruption and sabotage by the counterrevolutionary revisionist lines., of Liu Shao-chi, Lin
 Piao and particularly the "gang of four".   Now that the two bourgeois headquarters of
 Liu Shao-chi and Lin Piao have been crushed and the "gang of four" smashed, Chairman
 Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can be implemented correctly and in an all-round
 way.   Of course, the class struggle is protracted and we will still have to remove
 obstacles from our path.   But the greatest hindrance to our advance has now been cleared
 away.   Several hundred million people are now marching ahead toward the modernization
 of science and technilogy and thousands of contingents of professional scientific and
 technological workers are sweeping forward without hindrance.   We are fully determined
 to accomplish the important tasks called for on the scientific and cultural fronts in the
 new period and we are entirely confident of success.   We will emerge as a nation with a
 high standard of culture.
 Comrades:  The comprehensive and correct implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary
 line can bring out fully the superiority of the socialist system, fire the enthusiasm
 of the masses of people to study new things and build a new world, unite and organize
 all possible forces throughout society and march forward under a unified plan to the
 common goal.   This is the basic guarantee for the sure triumph of our cause.  As we
 advance, we must study many things we do not know and overcome many difficulties.   We
 can learn anything, provided we rely on the enthusiasm of the masses.   No difficulty
 can stop us provided we rely on the united strength of the masses.   Our slogan is:  Study,
 study and once more study; unite, unite and once more unite.   Let the whole party, the
 whole army and the people of all our national!-ties hold high the great banner of Chairman
 Mao, rally closely round the party Central Cotmittee, make concerted efforts to raise
 tremendously the scientific and cultural level of the entire Chinese nation and successfully
 fulfill the great historic mission of building a modern and powerful socialist state.
