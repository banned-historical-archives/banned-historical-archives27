MEMORANDUM 
THE WHITE HOUSE 
WASIIINGTON 
SECRET INFORMATION  
MEMORANDUM FOR: THE PRESIDENT 
FROM: 
HENRY A. KISSINGER 
SUBJECT: Readings on Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai 
Attached is a book which we have prepared for r-111 r?eiritni14rIcrdircr  
on Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai. Included are 
and analytic reports on the political philosophies and current political 
status of Mao and Chou prepared by CIA and by an American lawyer 
who was born in China and lived there for many years. 
It is of course very difficult to draw a full or wholly accurate picture 
of personages as complex as Mao and Chou. The CIA contributions 
and those of the lawyer each have their strong points and perhaps 
certain less strong ones as well. For example, the lawyer seems to 
do better than CIA in assessing the romantic, revolutionary strain 
which runs through Mao, while CIA is much more up-to-date on where 
Mao stands politically today in China. CIA impresses me as being 
more perceptive in commenting on Chou, who emerges in the lawyer's 
study as a shallower personality than he was in his conversations with 
me. Where CIA lacks color, the lawyer has an abundance of it. 
In reading these materials, I believe that you should keep in mind that 
we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg. CIA has had no direct contact 
with the China mainland; the lawyer has, but in pre-Communist days 
when the Nationalists were in power. (The lawyer's main Chinese source, 
incidentally, falls into the same category.) But both are, in my opinion, 
pretty much on target.

Evaluations of Mao Tse-tung and Chou  En-lai  
by an American Lawyer 
Mao Tse-tung 
Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-tung without question has a deeply 
ingrained and implacable hatred for "imperialists" [the Western world], 
and he hates the United States more than all the rest. His is not a simu-
lated emotion, to be displayed to arouse his people against a "common 
enemy." It is a personal aversion to all of the nations who in his view 
misused China in the days of the unequal treaties and during the warlord 
period that followed the fall of the Ch'ing dynasty. Mao's intense dislike 
for us applies to our nation, our country, our government and our people, 
themselves. We are particularly singled out because we are strong and 
successful. If England, France, Germany and the other western powers 
were as strong as we, he would articulate his dislike for them more 
frequently and more strongly than he does. But that is a tactic. Apart 
from the tactic of singling us out for major criticism and attack, there 
is no doubt from studies of him, his life, his writings and his propaganda, 
and also from all of my interviews and conversations with informants, 
that Mao nurses a deep and permanent hatred for us. It was accentuated 
by Korea and by our 7th Fleet's presence in the Taiwan Straits, as it was 
by our support for Chiang during the Second World War, and after it. But 
Mao's personal antipathy for us was not caused by those events. He devel-
oped it in his childhood during the period in which China was powerless to 
expel the English, other western powers and us. And he will always feel 
hostile to us, regardless of his external appearance or his temporary 
tactic of cooperating with us as a hedge against USSR and Japan. 
Mao will be simulating when he treats President Nixon with courtesy, and 
when he welcomes the Nixon group into China. 
This basic attitude of hostility toward us is so great that Mao would con-
tinue.with it even in the illustrative and imaginary circumstance in which 
the United States is postulated as a communist nation. Even under that 
imagined circumstance, Mao would retain his dislike for America and 
would be hostile to it, unless it were subservient to China. 
In large measure, Mao's anti-American feeling is a manifestation of the 
hatreds felt by an inferior for one superior; by a slave for his master; 
by one who is poor for a rich man; by one who is crude for those who are 
genteel; and by the conquered for the conqueror. Mao's dislike for us

also is xenophobic, but unlike the classical Greek concept that it is 
strangers who may be disliked, 'there is a Chinese overtone here which 
would have Mao feel the same way even if he knew us better. That is 
because Mao is culturally and spiritually living in a Chinese fantasy 
which places him back in the days of the ancient dynasties, mentally and 
with respect to foreigners - and his view is not only that we hive harmed 
China, but more than that, that we are "outer barbarians," under his 
old China imperialistic and Sinocentrist mental outlook. Accordingly, 
we are to be controlled or pacified when we are strong, or conquered 
and driven away when he is strong. It is not a question of friendship 
or lack of it, because the ancient Chinese emperors and Mao, the modern 
Chinese emperor, could not possibly be friends with barbarians. That 
is the Chinese twist to xenophobia in Mao's case. So his hatred for 
America and the other western powers is in many layers, like an onion. 
And as one peels away each layer, underneath is a fresh stratum or fold 
of the onion. With Mao, at the heart center of his onion of Chinese-style 
xenophobia for America is the ancient Chinese emperor's view toward 
barbarians. Then, with the next outer layer, we have the supposed 
excesses of the equal treaty days and the warlord periods; next, moving 
outward, is the layer of resentment for our support of Chiang, the Korean 
war and the Taiwan straits and 7th Fleet period; and so on. 
Accordingly, when Mao Tse-tung permitted Chou En-lai to invite Presi-
dent Nixon to visit, and the new dialogue began to unfold, we may assume 
that Emperor Mao was controlling or pacifying, either the American 
"barbarians," or by using them in the traditional manner in which the 
Han Chinese used one barbarian tribe to offset another, the American 
"barbarianeare intended as a bulwark against the Russian barbarians or 
the Japanese barbarians, or against both. 
In Mao's mind, no permanent good relationship with America is either 
possible or desirable. He condones Chou's invitation to us for some self-
serving reason, either external or internal. And it is useless to expect 
Mao to keep his word or to develop any genuine warmth toward us. That 
is not at all to say that we should not act warmly with respect to him and 
China, at this time. By doing so, we too serve our own interests; adjust 
the Asian balance of power in a way we desire; 'and, most importantly, 
re-open communications with the Chinese people, who are not at all like 
Mao for the most part, and thereby we can eventually help them to resume 
their own basic characteristics, those of warmth, friendliness and indivi-
duality. In that manner, we have good and historical reason to expect, 
Chinese communism can be made to erode, and finally fall.

We can join Mao for a moment in his Chinese fantasy that we are back 
in the imperial era of China. Emperor Mao Tse-tung's predecessors 
in Peking, the Mings, in fear of a powerful brigand who was threatening 
the capitol and empire, invited a barbarian tribe (the Manchus) into 
Peking to drive out the brigands. The Manchus entered Peking in 1644 A.D. , 
and they drove out the brigand and his men, as promised. However, the 
Manchus refused to leave, and established the Ch'ing Dynasty in China. 
In our situation, our plan must be to attempt, once back in Peking (cultur-
ally, economically and through our dialogue and what we must work to 
make an exchange of news, students, scientists, doctors, businessmen 
and merchandise), we must emulate the Manchus of 1644 A.D. , and 
although we may help drive away the brigands Emperor Mao Tse-tung 
fears, let us hope we can remain in Peking in the ways described above, 
and thereby bring about the fall of the emperor. 
The example given is fanciful. But the inner feelings of Mao, as described 
here, are accurate. He shows those feelings in his own actions, his 
speeches, his own writings and in his choice of reading matter. We must 
not be deceived by Mao's simple dress, plain way of living, folksy talk 
and writing, or poetry writing. That may not look like an emperor's 
characteristics to an American, but China's classics and history reflect 
that Mao is living the legends of the ancient emperors, in each of those 
particulars. Such spartan and simple qualities were highly admired by 
the people in some of their emperors. The addition of such traditional 
imperial skills as poetry writing and military conquest are appropriate 
for a new emperor. 
Once we grasp that Mao's "revolution" and its Marxist phrases in some 
respects is a reversion to the concepts of some of the great Chinese 
emperors, it is useful to study what those great emperors did: Expand 
China's borders, in many instances; and expel the barbarians from within 
her boundaries, if they had enCroached; and close the borders to all 
foreigners, of course, excepting for a few trading outposts, traditionally 
in Canton and also at the borders to the north and west; and, on occasion, 
burn the books and, perhaps, use forced labor to build Great Walls; and 
put down any intellectuals who protest; and kill off or otherwise purge all 
internal rival princes; and war with the Khmer and the predecessors of 
the Thais, if they refuse tribute; and war with the barbarians in Japan, 
if they threaten; and seek to seize and control Taiwan and the Pescadores; 
and assume a god-like presence in the eyes of the people, with a prolifera-
tion of monuments and memorials; and, if too many barbarians threaten 
the distant borders, then call in some other barbarians to help cope with 
those who threaten.

Mao reflects all of the above, in his .choice of favorite novels; in his own 
writings; and in his conduct. It is helpful to keep that in mind. That 
"emperor syndrome" can be very useful to us "barbarians," particularly 
in that it is helping us to establish a dialogue with the Chinese. Mao is 
older now, and surely will pass away soon. That and his increasing age 
will help us to deal with the more moderate and reasonable Chou En-lai 
and, hopefully, others like him. J. 
A number of practical concepts flow from the realization that Mao is a 
neo-emperor: 
? To use Mao Tse-tung for our own purposes and interests [to 
balance powers in Asia; win an honorable and secure peace; 
maintain an honorable and secure peace; and open China, to 
the full extent possible, in order to have our dialogue and 
increased dealings with her erode Chinese communism, and 
so on], we must give him dignity and treat him with some 
degree of respect, in the eyes of his own people and in his 
own eyes. We must remember his is a form of god, and must 
not soil his pictures or degrade his many statues. 
-- We must not quarrel with Mao, himself, in our government's 
public statements and releases. If it becomes necessary to 
attack orally or in a release, we must direct the attack at 
the People's Republic, or at some lesser individual, but never 
against Emperor Mao. 
? Like Chou En-lai, we mast not praise Mao too much, if at 
all; and we must not blame him, as stated above. 
7- In our program to develop enough good will on the part of 
China to establish and maintain our dialogue, we cannot and 
will not praise communism, because it is alien and unacceptable 
to us. But we can safely praise the great accomplishments of 
China's ancient hero emperors, and Mao will feel praised. 
Although he gives lip service to putting p.side many old things, 
he himself praises the powerful old empires. We can safely 
praise China's art, paintings, architecture, and so on, and 
the qualities of her people (who do have excellent qualities, 
beneath the Mao-applied veneer of Marxism). It will please 
emperor Mao and tend to gain his cooperation, if we can praise 
China's history and ancient culture (and they are praiseworthy).

-5. 
-- Our President can, safely in China and also politically safely, 
in America, praise Mao's Chinese poems - at least, the non-
military ones, involving the beauties of mountains and clouds. 
That might seem odd here, but would be pleasing to Mao and 
his people, if it can be managed. Maybe a comment in a private 
talk would be safest. 
We need to get into a position, as to our own programs and 
national interests, to have our own plan be "blessed" by the 
semi-god neo-emperor Mao - because if he "blesses" any plan 
or program we want carried out, the "blessing" will carry 
most of the Chinese people with it, at least as of now, and will 
be something powerful to cite to the Chinese people after Mao 
dies. President Nixon's private talks with Chairman Mao will 
have such an effect, too. 
-- Mao inherently and also because of his historical bent, is and 
likes to be devious, -use artifice, guile and deceit, and show 
bravery. He would make a great poker player. He has shown 
a number of times, including many incidents in his intra-
communist fights, an ability to act unconcerned until ready to 
attack. And then his sudden attack is deadly. 
Mao's love of his country is genuine. He has real pride in China, 
its history, its accomplishments, its recent ejection of the 
foreigners, and the fact that he has restored a large part of the 
old empires. He is a patriot, but his patriotism sees a China 
led spiritually only by Mao. 
Mao fears (on behalf of his plans and for China's success and 
safety) Russia, at present; and he fears the eventual threat of 
Japan. However, Mao is enough of a fanatic as to his movement 
to order an attack on Russia even though China is much the weaker. 
The same would apply as to Japan, but Japan's threat to China is 
believed by China to be more remote in time than that of Russia. 
The moderating influence of Chou En-lai and his assistants has 
influenced Mao to hold back as to Russia, and Mao's personal 
day-to-day power in his own view and in fact are not sufficient 
for him to override that Chou moderating influence. In addition, 
although data is not complete, it is probable that Mao is allowing 
Chou to effect the present moderate program at least in part 
because Mao needed and needs Chou and Chou's old military 
friends; support against the adherents of Lin Piao's.

-- Mao is ill, but is in full possession of his mental faculties 
at this time. 
Mao occupies an almost legendary and god-like position with 
a large part of the Chinese population at this time, and is and 
will remain by invocation of his name by his successors, the 
spiritual symbol of China. Although there is a communist hard 
core of a few million in China, most of the Chinese revere Mao 
for uniting China and for driving out the foreigners. That great 
majority wishes in its secret minds that somehow they could 
enjoy and have those two advantages (unity and no foreigners) 
and also the at least relatively full bellies they now have most 
of the time, and yet be able to return to their traditional ways 
of family love, the family as the center of life, individuality, 
fun-loving ways and personal dignity. As Mao succeeds more 
in feeding the Chinese, this desire to regain their traditional 
character will grow. 
? Mao Tse-tung is convinced that if his people are exposed to any 
outside influences or any genuine news or conflicting opinions, 
they will lose their rote belief in his form of communism. He 
shows that conviction in a number of ways, but mainly in his 
fear of any outside news. Mao is astute and clever. He knows 
his peasant armies and his millions of peasants very well. He 
knows China's history, and the capacity on the part of the people 
to switch China's history, and the capacity on the part of the 
people to switch views in a flash, when they get tired of faking 
a view, or of going along with it, in effect, "for laughs." The 
Chinese for centuries have shown that if reasonably content 
(i. e., if left alone by government, and if with sufficient food 
and a life of relative dignity, peace and family relationships), 
they will act as if they are going along with the current big 
? movement. But if they are being bothered and interfered with, 
and if they feel oppressed, or if they are reaching those condi-
tions but have not yet gone over the edge, traditionally they can 
be aroused by speech, by word of mouth, or by news. Mao 
remembers the eruption of the Taiping Rebellion, and its sudden 
cessation. That episode has been often repeated in China's 
history. Mao also knows he is playing with dangerous things, 
in the following, which nevertheless he is doing because he is 
an emperor, and he "knows they are right:"

Mao is attacking family ties, many old traditions, and the 
individuality of the Chinese -- note, this does not refer to 
freedom, but to individuality. The Chinese does not have 
the fierce British and American passion for freedom, for 
example. To the Chinese, freedom is a form of "irresponsi-
bility," or "licentiousness." But the Chinese is an indivi-
dualist. For example, he does not like to be marched around, 
made to shout slogans in unison, made to listen to lectures, 
and otherwise restricted. The Chinese for thousands of years 
have prized highly the right to "do their own thing." Mao is 
restricting that, and trying to wipe it out. That and the 
attacks on family ties and old traditions are very dangerous 
acts on Mao's part. He fears free news, free ideas and 
communication, because they could fire up the Chinese and 
cause them to refuse to go through all of the rote drills. 
Mao is making the Chinese be too grim. They are not a 
grim people. Their natural need, to a very great extent and 
even more than with us Americans, is to have fun, to enjoy 
gracious living and hobbies, numerous holidays and celebra-
tions, gay colored clothes, especially for their children, 
leisurely chats as they rest after a hard day's work, and 
laughter. It is much more serious than we Americans usually 
imagine that Mao is making the Chinese grim. The Chinese 
reaction would be and I know is, on a widely shared basis: 
OK, we'll be grim to get rid of corruption, inflation, disease, 
starvation, and especially, the foreigners who have plagued 
.us with their superior rights for so long. When those have 
been accomplished, then OK, we'll still be grim because 
emperor Mao keeps telling us what terrible danger we are in 
from those insane, greedy and expansionist Americans, who 
hate and threaten us ,so. [That is the stage Mao has them in, 
at the moment.] 
Now, to bring President Nixon and his entourage into China at that stage, 
with many friendly Americans looking quite human and warm, and with the 
President expressing friendly sentiments, it is very hard for the Chinese 
to keep going long with the ogre removed. The Chinese will get sick of 
being grim, being drilled, being heckled constantly by the communist 
cadres, and will suddenly begin to long for the old traits and old proce-
dures, again. So our presence in China does two major things: it demon-
strates that the most useful ogre to Mao is quite human; and with us, 
hopefully, we bring the free contacts which will let in the news which, 
eventually will bring about the erosion of communism.

Mao knows all of the above. That is the reason for the fierce censorship 
and the severity of the anti-revisionist programs, and similar things. 
So why does Mao let Chou invite us in? Because Mao feels that the other 
barbarians, the Russians and Japanese, are now far more dangerous. 
So he will let the American barbarians come in briefly, just enough to 
offset the other dangers. Mao intends to repel us again sooner or later, 
and to close down the country, again. But we must work to give Chou 
En-lai and his supporters the support they need, and to remain in touch 
with China and her people, long enough (1) to have Mao's death occur; or 
(2) to have Chou En-lai and his supporters develop enough strength to open 
their doors wider; and/or (3) to have our dialogue and relationships with 
China become so extensive that the feeble Mao by that time cannot effect-
ively interfere. 
-- Mao is very shrewd. He is not widely educated nor has he traveled 
very much (just to Russia, and in China), but he has a shrewd mind, a keen 
intuition and a creative and poetic bent. He probably knows or infers all 
of our purposes, but still plans to play some poker with us. It is unlikely 
he will negotiate with our President, because (1) emperors do not nego-
tiate, and neither do gods - they leave that to their ministers; and (2) that 
is Chou En-lai's job; and (3) he will feel that negotiating at his and your 
high levels is not proper or dignified. Probably, in his bluff and some-
times somewhat crude peasant manner, he will do his best to entertain 
our President; will banter in his rough but smiling way; and will argue 
philosophies and ideologies. This can be done in a good-natured and 
pleasant way. 
? What will Mao be watching for and studying in our President, when  
they meet? Mao has a script from which he will play this meeting - his 
favorite stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms and in Shui Hu Chuan, 
or Water Margin (All Men Are Brothers). It is a safe assumption that 
Mao in his inner mind will pict.ure this meeting between himself and the 
President as a courteous and ceremonious meeting between great but 
opposing war chieftains, two enemy "kings" or "emperors," if you will. 
Mao will treat the President with courtesy, and ply him with Mao's favorite 
tea, the famous "Dragon Well" tea, the great green tea produced in the 
West Lake region of Hangchow, and wines, and:perhaps a boat ride around 
the lakes. Mao will act the gracious host, but this is what he will be 
searching in our President's face, eyes, bearing and manner: 
What, Mao will wonder, is this man Nixon really like, inside - 
is he strong (in the decisive, confident, spartan and erect 
military sense); does he have the courage to order his legions

to attack, or to keep fighting? If so, I must respect him and 
maintain peaceful relations ,with him. Or is he weak, so that 
I should attack him? 
? Mao-will study our President's mind, probe for its degree of 
determination and shrewdness, test to see how sturdy or weak 
is the American culture, as represented by this first important 
and powerful American he has ever met closely.

Chou En-lai  
Premier Chou En-lai is a more rational and less complicated figure than 
Mao Tse-tung, and can be evaluated from the Chinese standpoint and 
from ours, in much less space than is required as for Mao. Chou En-lai 
is a very loyal Chinese, intensely patriotic, ambitious for his communist 
party and true to its causes. But he is not a fanatic like Mao. He is 
rational, reasonable, cultured, informed, pleasant in manner when he 
wants to be, and an able administrator and statesman. 
He, himself, has said, "I am an intellectual, with a feudalistic family 
background." He enjoys good wines, and especially the famous Shao-hsing 
wine produced in his home town by that name. 
Regarding Chou's record in international affairs, we know that he shares 
with Mao and other Chinese communists a willingness to lie, break his 
word and otherwise violate the codes of ethics of our world, and of China's 
former world. But Chou does it with some grace, and one can believe 
that he may suffer a twinge or two, or at least does not enjoy breaches of 
ethics. In all events, he gives an appearance of rationality and at least 
logical thinking, in his worst periods even, with respect to America. 
Chou En-lai has been and still is our enemy. But he is an enemy with 
whom we can communicate. He is not filled with the hatreds and xeno-
phobic reactions of Mao Tse-tung. He does not harbor any terrible hatreds 
for Americans, and has some respect for us. Obviously, he is a Chinese, 
and also a Chinese communist. So he would make dangerous move against 
us if he believed it were in China's interest. But on the whole, his judge-
ments as to any such moves would be based on criteria not unlike those 
we consider in similar situations, with an additional touch of the old 
Confucian grace affecting Chou's manner of making his move. 
Chou En-lai can be exceedingly charming and persuasive. But he has been 
proven on a number of occasions to have been insincere in his protesta-
tions, and more than once has been charged with being "a complete fraud." 
Also, his acting ability in the course of diplomatic exchanges has been 
ironically praised. One close acquaintance of Chou's in the 1936-37 Sian 
period, has claimed emphatically that "Everything that appears to be human 
in Chou En-lai is false, absolutely false! And he is sharp and capable - 
that is what's terrible about him. He has too many tricks, and yet he can 
appear so touchingly innocent. He is the god of revolution, and the demon

No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
of bloodshed, but never a man! " However, Chou En-lai is a rational and 
educated man, without ungoverned passions. And he is a man with whom 
we can establish and maintain a dialogue. Also, he is capable of reason-
ably perceiving that a given course of conduct, such as increasing peaceful 
relations with us, may be in the ultimate interest of China, as well as in 
our interests. 
Chou is well known as China's great administrator, and the calming in-
fluence in many of the internal differences, as well as the Chinese foreign 
negotiator of the most ability and experience. It is noteworthy that the 
survival-oriented and remarkably surviving Chou En-lai, during the 1966.-
67 Red Guard tumult all around him, attacked nobody personally and 
pacified the mobs, on occasion, intervening in disputes. 
A number of Chinese sources have explained Chou En-lai's ability to 
survive in communist turmoil and among other sometimes violent rises 
and falls, because of the following characteristics and procedures identi-
fied with him: 
? Chou En-lai is exceptionally alert, charming both in the Chinese 
and in the Western cultures, and an able speaker. He catches nuances 
very quickly, and is capable of dropping skillful cl.plomatic hints and threats, 
himself. In debate, he relies on facts; precedents; logic; and the socratic 
device (questioning his opponent into a corner), and the syllogism (major 
premise, minor premise, and then conclusion). Chou is well educated and 
currently informed. He has a good and loyal staff, which he protected 
quite successfully during the Red Guard turmoil, even sending many away 
to remote-areas, to weather the storm. He is well briefed for negotiations. 
And his general style is pleasant. One of my Chinese friends with Western 
experience has indicated that Chou En-lai is a Confucian gentleman with a 
Frenchman's charm and quick perception, with very mean and tough friends. 
Choi:I was in France as a student, of course, and has been outside of China 
on a?number of occasions, in Europe and elsewhere, but never to the United 
States. Chou is reputed to be in the habit of trying to soften his debates by 
"seeing the other man's view," and similar devices, and then trying to 
demolish it. On the whole, he is a suave, clever and alert gentlemen with 
very mean and tough friends, as some Chinese have remarked. Chou, him-
self must be charged with involvement in some of the blood baths around 
him, but he always seems to have been "out for tea with a friend" when the 
shooting started. 
? Chou En-lai has avoided writing very many public articles, and so 
has not left the broad ideological trail which was left by other now departed 
colleagues of Mao Tse-Tung.

? Most important, according to Chinese sources, has been the fact 
that Chou En-lai since his return from the student days in France, had 
always been -the steady "gray" administrator for the communists. 
Obviously, he has competence in this field. Rather than taking part in 
the contests and battles, Chou En-lai has usually been the man who sold 
tickets, ushered, announced each fight, served as referee, announced 
the winner, comforted the loser (or buried him) and wrote up the fights 
for the Foreign Office archives. In his steady survivals as each new 
episode of disappearances occurs, Chou En-lai is very much like the 
nonchalant and ubiquitous Chinese prop man, who strolls around the stage 
of the traditional Chinese opera while it is going full blast, dressed in his 
plain blue work clothes. All the actors are in elaborate costumes, fully 
made up with gaudy paints reflecting their various characters, and impres-
sive head-dress, variously as ancient lords, warriors and ladies. The 
actors sing and shout loudly, as they bound about the stage, orating, fight-
ing and then collapsing in death. Whenever an actor is ready to die, the 
prop man strolls up and provides a pillow to soften the fatal fall. If a 
'warrior needs a spear, the prop man is there -with it. When lovers finish 
with a flute, it is handed to the prop man, who takes it backstage, often 
passing between the audience and the actors. The prop man is always 
there; the battles rage around him; men die; and he helps them be com-
fortable in their death, in all administering the wild and colorful action. 
The comparison is apt. Chou En-lai so far indeed has been the prop man 
in the Chinese communists' Chinese opera. As with the prop man who is 
not considered a part of the battles but is there, Chou has survived. 
Another fa.ctor which contributes to Chou's influence and security is the 
high regard felt for him by a large group of Liberation Army officers, some 
of high position [ranks were abolished, but "positions" remain high]. Chou's 
popularity with the officers stems in part from his early days as Political 
CoMmissar at Whampoa Military Academy, where the officers learned to 
know him and respect him. Some of those officers still survive, and by 
reputation, Chou's close connection with the army officers continues. 
Such friendships no doubt strengthen Chou's hand, today. There is no, 
certainty as to tomorrow. 
Chou En-Lai today probably is in some danger from any surviving colleagues 
of Lin Piao. just by counting names and noting who is no longer around as 
shown in the recent press photographs, a large number of highly placed 
communists are now missing and in trouble, undergoing "reform," or 
dead. It may be that Chou En-lai has sufficient support and enough of Mao's

blessings and approval to maintain a government stable enough to deal 
with us. But the potential for change in China is great, and it is difficult 
to estimate whether Chou En-lai can maintain a stable government; whether, 
if not, who might succeed him; and what will occur upon Mao Tse-Tung's 
death. If Chou En-lai remains and can hold the government stable, we 
should be able to work with him in our dialogue.

Chinese Principles and Assurutions  
Chinese operating principles for the manipulation of "barbarians"  
are not improvised like our policies of recent times, but are inherited 
from a great tradition that comes down from centuries even before the 
Mongols and Manchus conquered and ruled all China. From ancient 
times the sedentary Chinese farmers and bureaucrats have always had 
to deal from weakness with powerful, mobile, non-Chinese fighters 
and conquerors. Today, Chiang deals with us from weakness, while 
Mao deals with the Russians, also from weakness. Both are doing well. 
1. The cardinal Chinese principle in dealing with a non-Chinese 
is to use friendship as a halter. Admit the outsider to a guest member-
ship in Chinese society. Compliment him on his knowledge of aspects 
of Chinese culture or of the Chinese language. Entertain him with 
informality and frankness. Establish the personal bonds of friendship, 
which in the old China were stronger than in Western urban life today. 
Become really intimate friends and understand his unspoken assump-
tions and personal motivations. 
2. Ask the foreigner's advice so as both to ascertain his aims 
and values and to enlist his sympathy and support. (Both these prin-
ciples help to account for our Sinophilism. ) 
3. Disclose to him those Chinese vital interests which are allegedly 
more important than life itself, so as to preempt a position ahead of time 
and warn him it is. not negotiable. 
4. Build up the peculiar uniqueness of Chinese values and conduct 
(as I am doing here) so as to suggest the dangers of stormy unpredicta-
bility, preternatural stubborness, or other traits of the powerholder, 
which present the foreigner with insuperable difficulties. 
5. Find out the foreigner's friends, enemies, and other circum-
stances so as to avoid offense to him and also to know where to find 
allies if necessary to mobilize against him, and so on. 
6. Use the foreigner's own rules to control him, especially the 
Western legal concept of sovereignty, the idea that diplomats are accre-
dited to governments (not to the local people), that domestic matters 
are beyond foreign question, and so on.

7. Stir the foreigner's conscience and sense of guilt so that he 
hamstrings himself. 
8. Use some foreigners against others, to secure Chinese ends. 
Thus Chiang Hai-shek has cultivated American supporters of his own 
military doctrine, and by putting one third of his forces on Quemoy, 
with American help, he has made the defense of Quemoy probably neces-
sary to the defense of Taiwan. Meanwhile Mao Tse-tung has found a 
staunch ally against Moscow in the state of Albania. 
Behind these tactics, which are of course not really unique, lie 
certain  traditional assumptions of Chinese_politics  that are rather 
different from our own: 
1. China is a political and cultural universe. It cannot be divided. 
All Chinese belong to it. 
Z. There is only one Son of Heaven. He and his dynasty (or party) 
are the repository of final power. Popular consent is tacit. 
3. Majority rule is mere mobocracy. Men are not equally endowed. 
The elite should rule. Hence plebiscites are unsound and insulting to 
dignity. 
4. The ruler has a special virtue and prestige, which if maintained 
prolong his rule. Hence face is necessary to power holding, and criti-
cism (as by a free press) is at once subversive. 
5. Rule is personal. Law is not supreme, but a tool of adminis-
tration. It is loyalty that supports a ruler. Hence civil rights must be 
limited and law subordinated to personal relations.

INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM 
COMMUNIST CHINA: AN OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMY 
Conclusions  
In the 1 970s, Communist China's growing economic strength will be 
applied largely to industrial and military modernization, and its international 
economic role is likely to remain small. 
China's economic strategy for the 1970s calls for a strong push in 
domestic investment. Indeed, this program is well under way as evidenced 
by the surprising number of industrial projects at various stages of 
construction ? for example, iron and steel complexes, petroleum refineries, 
aluminum plants, and shipyards. Simultaneously, the leadership is faced with 
the high costs of serial production and large-scale deployment of missiles 
and other modern weapons systems. The agricultural sector, which must 
feed a growing population at gradually higher standards, needs additional 
support from industry and will be hard put to increase its volume of export 
goods in the next few years. Since China's exports consist largely of raw 
and manufactured agricultural products, the growth of foreign trade will 
be relatively slow. 
Japan will continue to be China's natural trading partner because of 
geographical nearness, cultural ties, and a suitable offering of goods and 
technology. If the Chinese become less sensitive to the presence of foreign 
technicians, the Japanese can supply on-the-spot assistance in building new 
industrial capacity and developing natural resources, notably petroleum. 
Such a development would underscore China's subordinate role in the 
international economic arena. 
As for the United States, the potential for US-China trade is limited 
by several factors. China's foreign trade is small in relation to total output

and is likely to grow only slowly because of Peking's policy of economic 
self-sufficiency, its conservative attitude toward foreign indebtedness, and 
its limited range of export goods. And China already has well-established 
trading relationships with low-cost suppliers of its major import needs --
grain from Canada and Australia; and capital goods, metals, and fertilizers 
from Japan and Western Europe. Despite these limitations there are obvious 
possibilities for growing US-China commercial relationships because of a 
US comparative advantage in high-technology industries -- such as aircraft, 
advanced computers, petro-chemical equipment, and offshore drilling 
equipment ? and the existence of a high-income US market for Chinese 
luxury items. 
In general, China will continue to depend on the outside world for 
new technology and modern machinery in the 1970s. China enters the 
international arena as a back runner in the technological race. To be sure, 
China will draw rapidly ahead of other large low-income nations, such as 
India and Indonesia, which lack internal momentum in investment and are 
burdened by crushing international debts. At the same time, China will 
be rapidly falling behind its neighbor Japan in total and per capita output 
since the Japanese economy is growing at least twice as fast on a far larger 
base. All the leading industrial nations will be devoting substantial resources 
to research and development and to the modernization of their industrial 
facilities. China with its heavy commitment to defense will be hard-pressed 
not to fall farther back of the international pace-setters. 
Purpose of the Memorandum 
The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth the strengths and 
weaknesses of the economy of Communist China as they affect China's 
ability to project its power into the international arena. The memorandum 
provides an overview of the Chinese economy ? its resources, its pattern 
of growth, and its place in the world economy. Appendixes contain a 
chronology of economic events in Communist China, estimates of key 
economic indicators, answers to questions frequently asked about the 
Chinese economy, and comparisons with other economies.

I. RESOURCES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Manpower Resources 
China's huge manpower resources are uniquely suited for both military 
and economic development purposes. 
The government needs to draft only 10% of the 10 million males reaching 
military age each year in order to maintain its three-million-man Peoples 
Liberation Army (PLA). Thus only males in prime health and of unques-
tioned loyalty to the regime are inducted. The proportion of active-duty 
military personnel in the total population is only one-quarter as great as in 
the USSR or the United States. 
China's abundant manpower is re- Estimated and Projected 
flected also in the availability of tens Midyear Population 
of millions of reservists, militia, and 
members of the paramilitary Produc- 
tion and Construction Corps, 
engages in construction projects and 
agricultural reclamation in frontier 
areas. 
In terms of suitability for eco-
nomic development, the basic char-
acter of the Chinese people is prob-
ably unsurpassed anywhere in the 
world. The average Chinese is quick to 
learn, industrious and frugal, reason-
ably healthy, and well-motivated to 
improve his material lot. The popula-
tion is homogeneous except for the 
6% made up of minority nationalities 
living in the border areas. Communist 
China for the most part has been 
spared the racial and religious blood-
baths of India and other less de-
veloped countries.

The geographical distribution of the population is extremely uneven, as 
shown on the map. The river valleys, coastal plains, and low hills of the 
eastern third of the nation contain 90% of the population. 
Although the quality of manpower is a distinct asset, China would be 
better off with fewer people. The enormous population growing at 2.2% per 
year poses formidable problems of feeding and clothing ? even at the austere 
levels which the Peking government has maintained over the past 20 years. 
Birth control measures have been sporadic and so far have made no 
appreciable dent in the population structure.

SEL_K.1-1, 
Agricultural Resources 
China's agricultural resources, while large in absolute terms, are small 
in relation to the population and to the needs of the economy for export 
goods and raw materials for industry. 
Because of rugged terrain and lack of moisture in the western 
two-thirds of China, cultivation is largely confined to the eastern third. 
The eastern portion is divided into the predominantly wheat areas of the 
north and the predominantly rice areas of the south, as shown on the map. 
Only about 415,000 square miles -- or 11% of the total land area of 3.7 
million square miles ? is under cultivation. The effective cultivated acreage 
is increased by 50% through multiple cropping. 
Additional land, perhaps 3% of the total land area, could be brought 
under cultivation, but only at tremendous cost. At the same time, the 
development of urban areas, new transportation routes, and military 
installations is nibbling away at existing agricultural acreage. 
Centuries of intensive agricultural use have resulted in the stripping 
of China's forest cover, the exhaustion of much of the land, and the drop 
in water tables and alkalization of extensive acreage through overuse of 
water supplies. This has left the land even more vulnerable to flood and 
drought. The Communist government has made substantial gains in 
afforestation, control of water resources, and restoration of the fertility 
of the land. Beginning in 1962, the government has provided increasing 
amounts of chemical fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation pumps and piping, and 
improved seeds to the agricultural sector. The recurring periods of political 
upheaval have prevented the government from reaping the full benefits of 
these policies. 
Because of the continuing growth of population and the importance 
of agricultural products as raw materials for industry and as export goods, 
the government will need an even stronger effort to improve agricultural 
resources in the 1970s. This effort will center on the increase in yields 
from existing land through more fertilizer, better water management, and 
improved seeds. These improvements in China's agricultural resources will 
be at a relatively simple technological level appropriate to China's needs; 
it may be a decade before China can achieve the more advanced technology 
and higher yields of, for example, Taiwan and Mexico.

Industrial Resources  
China has the energy resources and mineral deposits of a superpower 
but lacks the capital plant and technological skill to compete with the 
United States and the USSR on a global scale. 
In energy resources, China has huge coal reserves, the world's largest 
hydroelectric potential, and extensive oilfields which are being rapidly 
developed. In metals, China's reserves of tungsten, tin, and antimony are 
the world's largest; sizable deposits of iron, manganese, and aluminum ores 
also have been found. However, reserves of three key alloying metals --
chrome, nickel, and cobalt -- are inadequate, and supplies must be imported. 
Finally, China remains heavily dependent upon imports for its supply of 
natural and synthetic rubber. 
Most of China's modern capital plant is located in the major industrial 
areas shown on the map. The concentration of manufacturing capacity in 
the northeast (the former Manchuria) and in the eastern port cities is a 
carryover from the pre-Communist era. Peking's strategy has been to build 
upon this inherited base while at the same time developing -- for strategic 
and "local self-reliance" objectives ? new industrial areas in the hinterland. 
The region stretching northeastward from Shen-yang (the former 
Mukden) to Ha-erh-pin is China's largest producer of petroleum, coal, 
electric power, steel, aluminum, cement, trucks, and railroad equipment. 
It also is a major producer of machine tools and armaments. Shanghai, 
on the east coast, is the country's largest industrial metropolis and a leading 
manufacturer of textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemical fertilizer, tires, steel, 
electronic and electrical equipment, machine tools, and merchant and naval 
shipping. 
Peking has been extensively developed as a production base for missiles, 
land armaments, electronic equipment, machine tools, textiles, and 
agricultural machinery. West of Shanghai is the Wu-han area, important for 
steel, heavy machinery, and naval shipbuilding. The Ch'ung-ch'ing region 
produces steel, machine tools, and artillery. Representative of other 
fast-growing hinterland cities are Ch'eng-tu (jet aircraft, electronic 
equipment, and instruments) and Sian (jet aircraft, small arms, electrical 
equipment, and textiles). 
In addition to the large industrial plants controlled by central 
ministries, the Communist government has supported the development of 
small and medium-sized plants to serve local needs. These plants typically 
produce cement and other construction materials, low-grade chemical 
fertilizer, small motors and other simple equipment, and consumer goods.

II. THE PATTERN OF ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Trends in the Gross National Product  
Overall economic growth under Communist rule has been fairly strong 
but erratic. 
China's gross national product (GNP) has doubled since 1952, reaching 
a level of $119 billion in 1970, or $143 per capita. The severe economic 
damage resulting from the Great Leap Forward (1958-60) -- a disastrous 
attempt at instant industrialization ? shows up clearly on the top chart 
at the right. In contrast, the damage from the political upheavals of the 
Cultural Revolution (1966-69) was relatively mild. 
The long-term annual growth rate of GNP has been about 4%. Since 
population has gown at an average rate of slightly more than 2%, the growth 
in per capita GNP has averaged about 2%. Agricultural output since 1952 
has approximately matched the growth rate of population. In contrast, 
industrial production since 1952 has grown at an 8% average rate, or 6% 
if the larger 1957 base is used. 
China is no ordinary less developed country with a per capita GNP 
of $100 or less. Rather, it may be considered as an economy with, say, 
a $100 "basic maintenance" sector and a $43 "development thrust" sector. 
That is, $100 is needed simply to maintain the population at reasonable 
minimum standards, with $43 left over for industrial investment and 
development of advanced weapons. As the bottom chart shows, China moved 
well above the $100 per capita level by 1957, fell back precipitously as 
a result of the Leap Forward, and now is forging ahead with a slowly 
widening margin. 
Prospects for substantial economic growth in the early 1970s are good, 
assuming no new flare-up of radical economic policies or a prolonged spell 
of unfavorable weather in agriculture. Agriculture should stay abreast of 
population growth, and industrial production should increase in the range 
of 5% to 10% annually. The following favorable factors for growth have 
been clearly identified: 
O a vigorous program of construction of industrial facilities, 
many in the interior provinces; 
O a substantial flow of machinery and technology from Japan 
and the leading industrial nations of Western Europe; 
? a steady increase in chemical fertilizer and pumps and other 
equipment going to agriculture; and 
? the restoration of the purged administrative structure to 
normal functioning together with the return to comparatively 
moderate economic policies.

Agricultural Production

The Communist leadership originally counted on collectivization to 
boost agricultural production rather than on large-scale capital investment. 
A sweeping "land reform" program which parceled the land out to the 
peasants was only the prelude to forcible collectivization of agriculture, 
and by 1957 the countryside had been organized into 750,000 agricultural 
producer cooperatives. Collectivization was followed in 1958 by the 
formation of 26,000 supereollectives ? the so-called "communes" -- which 
were to mobilize China's vast labor force for industrial and construction 
tasks as well as for agriculture. 
The unwieldy nature of the commune plus three years of unfavorable 
weather caused agricultural production to plummet in 1959-61. By the 
winter of 1960-61, China was near starvation, and discontent had spread 
even to the armed forces. As suggested by the chart, the already meager 
ration was reduced by 25% or more over wide areas. 
Threatened with the loss of control over China, the Communist 
leadership moved quickly to restore the situation by:

? opening food stocks and arranging for the 
annual import of 4-5 million tons of grain, 
starting in 1961; 
? decentralizing agricultural decisions to smaller 
organizational units, i.e., the production bri-
gade and the production team; 
? restoring the small private plot and permitting 
small-scale private trade in rural products; and 
? initiating a program of investment which has 
greatly increased the flow to agriculture of 
chemical fertilizer, electric power, pumps and 
other equipment, and improved seeds. 
This dramatic turnabout in policy, together with favorable weather, 
led to record levels of production in the late 1960s. 
In addition to feeding the population, the agricultural sector is 
expected to supply raw materials for industry and for export. One result 
is a continuing competition between grain and cotton for the available 
acreage. At present, sufficient cotton is being grown to provide a basic 
ration of about five linear meters of cloth a year ? enough for a simple 
outfit of tunic and trousers -- and to furnish a substantial volume of cotton 
textile exports. As for food exports, China typically exports foods that 
have a high unit value while importing basic grains, primarily wheat. 
Over the next few years, agricultural production can continue to 
expand gradually under the present policy of increased inputs to agriculture 
and a reasonably permissive attitude toward private activity. Peking no 
doubt will continue its efforts to reduce the amount of centrally controlled 
resources used in agriculture by encouraging the growth of local industry, 
by strengthening the birth control program, and by resisting pressures for 
a higher payout to the peasants.

Industrial Production 
The volume and variety of industrial products have increased markedly 
since 1949, but China still is far behind the leading industrial nations in 
most branches of industry. 
In the 1950s, the new government gave priority to building up the 
capacity and output of basic industrial fuels and materials. This priority 
has been maintained up to the present as shown by the following estimates 
of the output of key industrial products: 
1952 
1957 
1970 
Steel 
(million metric tons)

The groundwork for large-scale production of machinery and 
armaments also was laid in the 1950s. Subsequently, the Chinese have 
mastered the production of several types of precision machine tools, a 
remarkable variety of electronics equipment (including computers, radar, 
and communications equipment), transportation equipment (including 
heavy-duty trucks and diesel locomotives), and modern weapons of both 
Soviet and Chinese design. The expansion of light industry -- which provides 
the Chinese with simple everyday consumer goods and is an important 
source of export earnings ? has proceeded at a slower pace. 
The organization of industry reflects the normal practices of a 
centralized" command economy." The State Council, the highest government 
administrative body, translates the policy guidelines of the Party into 
specific directives; these orders are then carried out through a bureaucratic 
hierarchy of planning commissions, industrial ministries and departments, 
and industrial enterprises. 
Large plants, controlled by the central ministries, account for most 
of China's modern industrial production. A host of medium-size and small 
plants, which process local raw materials at a simple level of technology, 
are controlled by local governmental units. Supplementing the efforts of 
the regular industrial plants is the activity of tens of millions of full-time 
or part-time handicraft workers, who fill the interstices of the industrial 
sector by satisfying those small needs that escape the planners' attention.

Iron and Steel 
The rapid development of the iron and steel industry has propelled 
China into eighth place in world steel production ? far behind the United 
States, the USSR, and Japan but well ahead of India. 
Soviet equipment and technical aid were instrumental in the rapid 
growth of steel capacity and production in the 1950s. During the Leap 
Forward (1958-60), however, over-intensive use of equipment and the 
commissioning of 650,000 primitive "backyard furnaces" brought the 
orderly development of the industry to a halt. Most of the "backyard" 
product was unusable, and by 1961 many of the industry's major facilities 
had to be shut down for extensive repairs. After the abandonment of the 
Leap Forward, capacity and production were built up in rational fashion, 
with output of steel reaching 13 million tons in 1966. Following another 
sharp but short-lived drop in output during the Cultural Revolution, the 
industry today is moving ahead with a vigorous program of expansion and 
modernization. 
The iron and steel industry is located primarily near major deposits 
of iron ore and coking coal, which are widely distributed throughout the 
eastern half of the country. The principal production facilities are located 
at An-shan ? the old Manchurian center which produces 30% of China's 
steel ? Shanghai, Wu-han, and Pao-t' ou. Other large facilities are being built 
or expanded mainly in interior industrial areas. 
China's capacity for finishing steel has grown more slowly than crude 
steel production and does not provide a full assortment of shapes, sizes, 
and qualities of product. China is particularly dependent on imports of 
some kinds of tubing, sheet steel, and alloy steels. Moreover, in the last 
few years China has changed from a net exporter of pig iron to a net 
importer, evidence that crude steel capacity has overtaken and surpassed 
its pig iron capacity. China also depends on imports for substantial amounts 
of scrap because its industrial sector is still too young to generate much 
scrap. 
Since 1965, when most of the Soviet-designed construction projects 
were finally completed, China has looked to the Free World for steel 
technology and has imported nearly $100 million worth of metallurgical 
equipment, including sheet and tube mills, heat treating and soaking 
furnaces, ore beneficiation plants, and equipment for basic oxygen 
converters.

Petroleum 
With the discovery and exploitation of large new oilfields, China has 
become self-sufficient in petroleum and may even be able to export 
appreciable quantities of crude oil by the mid-1970s. 
The priority growth of the petroleum industry has eliminated what 
was once believed to be a major vulnerability in China's strategic position. 
Whereas China could supply less than half its needs from domestic resources 
in the 1950s, by 1965 it was essentially self-sufficient in petroleum products. 
Output of crude oil has almost quadrupled over the last decade ? from 
4.6 million tons in 1960 to an estimated 18 million tons in 1970 ? and 
refining capacity has more than kept pace. In spite of this rapid expansion, 
China is not a major producer by world standards ? for example, China's 
total annual production would satisfy the needs of the Japanese economy 
for only about 28 days. 
The center of gravity of the industry has shifted markedly under the 
Communists from the remote northwest to the industrialized northeast. The 
Ta-ch'ing oilfield in the northeast now provides about 60% of China's crude 
oil. Other major producers are the older Karamai and Yu-men oilfields in 
the northwest and the Sheng-li oilfield in Shantung Province in the east. 
Offshore fields are under investigation or development in order to acquire 
new sources of supply. 
China now is able to produce a complete range of petroleum products 
and is moving gradually into the production of petroleum-based chemical 
products. The effect of all these developments on the rest of the economy 
has been most apparent in the substantial increase since 1965 in 
petroleum-powered vehicles for military and civilian use ? aircraft, trucks, 
tractors, and ships. 
Production of crude oil in 1975 could reach 40 million tons. After 
satisfying military requirements, as well as the needs of industry, agriculture, 
and transportation, the Chinese may have as much as 10 million tons 
available for export. At present world prices, this quantity would bring 
in $250 million a year, a useful addition to China's present limited array 
of exports and a substantial contribution to its earnings of hard currencies. 
Japan, with its skyrocketing need for raw materials, is a logical customer. 
Sales to various less developed countries also would be possible and would 
contribute to China's political stature. Western Europe is a less promising 
market because of high transportation costs.

Military Production 
The industrial sector is supplying a rapidly expanding volume of 
equipment to all branches of the armed forces. 
In addition to surface-to-air missiles and short?range naval cruise 
missiles, the Chinese have produced an unknown number of MRBMs and 
IRBMs. They are also working on an ICBM program. 
The Chinese are gradually strengthening their air force by the 
production of Soviet-designed aircraft as well as a native-design fighter 
bomber. Production in 1971 probably will include more than 500 MIG-19 
jet fighters, some MIG-21s, about two dozen TU-16 jet bombers, and more 
than 100 of the new F-9 jet fighter bomber. 
Construction of naval weapons to date has been largely based on Soviet 
systems. These include cruise-missile equipped destroyers, guided missile 
patrol boats, and torpedo attack submarines. The Chinese have constructed 
a large modern, native-designed attack submarine which is probably 
nuclear-powered. They may also be developing a ballistic missile submarine 
of their own design. 
Production of ground weapons includes substantial quantities of small 
arms, artillery, medium tanks, and ammunition. 
In addition to armaments production, the Chinese economy contributes 
a heavy volume of construction activity to the military effort, e.g., the 
construction of shipyards, missile test sites, military bases, and airfields --
many with extensive underground facilities; the strengthening and extension 
of road and rail transport routes in strategic areas; the building of costly 
nuclear weapons production facilities in remote areas; and the construction 
of air-raid shelters in the cities. 
The resources used in defense include a large share of China's top-level 
scientists, engineers, and plant managers and much of the modern machinery 
produced at home or imported from Japan and Western Europe. In turn, 
the armed forces provide support to the general economy by supplying 
men and trucks at harvest time, building roads and railroads, training a 
continuing stream of recruits in valuable technical skills, and growing much 
of their own food on army farms.

Industrial Technology 
China's rapid advance in industrial technology has still left China far 
behind the leading industrial nations. 
In the 1950s the USSR supplied the equipment and technical support 
for the construction of about 150 modern industrial plants, including steel 
mills, electric powerplants, machine tool plants, and armaments plants. 
About 10,000 Soviet engineers, technicians, and production managers served 
tours in China, and thousands of Chinese scientists and technicians were 
trained in the USSR. 
The abrupt withdrawal of Soviet technicians in mid-1960, combined 
with the calamitous Leap Forward (1958-60), brought to a halt this progress 
in industrial technology. After the Leap was abandoned, China turned to 
Japan and Western Europe for modern machinery and technology with 
emphasis on technology in the iron and steel, chemical, electronics, and 
machinebuilding industries. The subsequent advance in industrial technology 
was again delayed by the political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution 
(1966-69). 
In addition to the foreign sources of technology, China has benefited 
from the extensive training and on-the-job experience of tens of thousands 
of its own young scientists, engineers, and plant managers. Today, the level 
of industrial technology lags behind the technology of Japan and Western 
Europe from 5 to 20 years or more depending on China's industrial 
priorities. Furthermore, within each industry, there is a striking contrast 
between large modern plants and local plants which use primitive methods 
and large numbers of unskilled workers. Peking preaches a doctrine of 
self-reliance in technology, yet China must continue to rely on Japan and 
Western Europe for much of its modern technology in the 1970s. 
A special problem concerns the replacement of the 200 Western-trained 
scientists and engineers, now in their 50s, who have pioneered China's 
nuclear and missile and other high-priority programs. The on-going Maoist 
revolution in education, with its emphasis on manual labor and the 
curtailment of theoretical academic training, conceivably could block the 
development of the most promising young technical people. The 
government, however, is exempting a small number of talented youths from 
the manual labor requirements and is believed to assign these youths to 
technical institutes to work under top scientists.

Transportation 
Rail transport is predominant in the modern sector of China's 
economy, with water and road transport playing important supplementary 
roles. 
Railroads have borne the burden of increased economic activity, 
particularly in industrial areas such as northeast China. Since 1950 the 
Chinese have added more than 11,000 miles of main and branch lines to 
the railroad network, which now totals about 25,000 miles, as shown on 
the map. Chinese railroad construction has concentrated on correcting the 
uneven distribution of the rail system. A striking example is the line linking 
Ch'eng-tu in Szechwan directly with Klun-ming in Yunnan. This line was 
recently completed after more than a decade of high-cost construction 
through rugged mountainous terrain. Although China's railroad system is 
primarily steam-powered, diesel locomotives have been introduced at an 
increasing rate since 1965. China is presently experiencing the revolution 
in railroad motive power completed in Western countries more than 
10 years ago. 
The Chinese road network totals more than 300,000 miles, about six 
times the length of serviceable roads in 1949. More than half the system 
consists of natural earth roads; the remainder is made up primarily of gravel 
roads and a few thousand miles of bituminous-bound and hard-surface roads. 
In most sections, truck transport provides short-haul service to the railroads 
and inland waterways. Motor trucks are supplemented for local haulage by 
large inputs of such primitive native transport means as wagons, carts, pack 
animals, and coolie porters. The quality of China's roads does not permit 
extensive long-distance truck haulage, except in the west where railroads 
do not exist. 
China's navigable inland waterways total more than 100,000 miles; 
routes on streams suitable for modern motorized vessels amount to some 
25,000 miles. Inland waterways supplement the railroads and carry bulk 
cargoes for long distances when speed is not of major importance. Navigation 
on the Yangtze River ? historically the great commercial artery of China ? 
has steadily improved. Oceangoing vessels can sail as far inland as Wu-han, 
while junks, barges, tugs, and large river steamers sail as far as Chlung-ch'ing. 
The dense network of waterways in the populous eastern third of China 
provides low-cost local haulage for an infinite variety of foodstuffs and 
industrial goods. 
Civil aviation is of minor importance in China. Air cargo is 
characteristically made up of high-value, low-volume items such as expensive 
machinery needed at remote construction sites or medical supplies required 
on an emergency basis. Passengers arc mostly government officials and 
foreign visitors.

III. CHINA'S ROLE IN THE WORLD ECONOMY 
Foreign Trade 
China's foreign trade, rigidly planned by the central government and 
controlled through a handful of state trading corporations, effectively 
supports China's industrial and agricultural goals. 
The total trade volume of $4.2 billion is small in relation to domestic 
output, partly because a vast country such as China can produce a wide 
variety of products for its own use and partly because so much of China is a 
subsistence agriculture economy. Nonetheless, for some items ? grain, 
chemical fertilizer, steel, rubber, and certain nonferrous metals and transport 
equipment ? China ranks as an important purchaser; its practice of giving 
single large contracts increases the impact on individual Western firms and 
even individual countries. 
China has made selective use of trade as a political tool, most recently in 
placing all its wheat import business with Canada, leaving none for Australia. 
On the other hand, Japan -- China's largest, most convenient, and least-cost 
trading partner ? has been increasing its primacy in China's trade in spite of 
festering political problems. And West Germany sells more to China than the 
United Kingdom or France despite the absence of formal diplomatic 
relations.

In the first decade under the Com-

from $1.2 billion in 1950 to $4.3 billion in

been cyclical, with trade dropping off after 
the collapse of the Leap Forward and

in 1970. Trade in 1971 should move up to 
a new peak. Along with these fluctuations 
in the volume of trade there has been a 
dramatic shift in China's trading partners. 
In 1970, some 80% of China's trade was 
with the Free World; a decade earlier 
almost two-thirds was with the Communist 
countries, with the USSR being the pre-

Machinery and transport equipment for China's industrial modernization

Europe supply the more advanced technology and also most of China's 
imports of steel and chemical fertilizer. Canada and Australia have been 
China's grain suppliers, with occasional shipments by France. Principal 
imports from the Free World less developed countries include rubber from 
Malaysia, Singapore, and Ceylon; copper from Zambia, Chile, and Peru; and 
textile fibers from Pakistan, the United Arab Republic, and East Africa. 
Hong Kong and the countries of Southeast Asia with sizable Chinese 
populations buy large quantities of specialty foods, cotton textiles, and light 
manufactures. This area provides China with hard currency earnings to 
finance the substantial deficits in trade with the developed countries of the 
Free World. For example, China's trade surplus with Hong Kong was $355 
million in 1970. In addition, China obtained another $175 million from 
remittances handled by the Hong Kong banks from Chinese residing abroad 
and from business and investment profits remitted back to the Mainland. 
China has followed a conservative international financial policy and is free 
of long-term international debt. China's reserves of gold and foreign 
exchange now amount to more than $700 million. Short-term commercial 
credits have been extensively used to finance imports of Western grain and 
fertilizer. Repayments have been prompt and outstanding short-term 
indebtedness was about $350 million at the end of 1970.

Foreign Aid 
China maintains a sizable foreign economic and military aid program 
in selected Communist and non-Communist countries at an annual cost of 
roughly $400 million a year. 
North Vietnam is the largest single recipient of China's foreign aid, 
having received by the end of 1970 $660 million in military aid and $945 
million in economic aid. Military and economic aid to North Vietnam have 
each been running at about $95 million a year in 1968-70. Military aid 
is made up primarily of small arms and ammunition; economic aid of 
foodstuffs, clothing, coal, and trucks. 
China also is a source of aid to insurgent movements in Southeast 
Asia - for example, the Pathet Lao in Laos and the Communist guerrilla 
forces in northwest Thailand - but compared to its aid to North Vietnam, 
Chinese commitments to these other movements are small. In an endeavor 
to foster independence of the Soviet Union, China also has furnished 
large-scale economic and military aid to Albania since 1961 and has recently 
entered into aid agreements with North Korea and Romania. As for Cuba, 
China for the last few years has been buying Cuban sugar at a price that 
represents a subsidy of roughly $50 million per year. 
In the period 1956-70, China extended a total of $1.7 billion in 
economic aid to the Free World less developed countries, mainly in the 
form of long-term low-interest loans. Only about one-third of this amount 
has been actually drawn; thus the outpayments have been at an average 
rate of $40 million per year. The most spectacular single aid project is 
the $400 million railroad to connect Zambia's copper belt with the 
Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam. In addition to economic aid, China 
extended by the end of 1970 some $200 million in military aid to 
non-Communist countries, of which two-thirds went to Pakistan primarily 
in the form of jet aircraft and tanks. The chart on the facing page gives 
further details on China's aid to the less developed countries of the Free 
World.

US-China Economic Relationships  
Over the next several years, US-China economic relationships are likely 
to be overshadowed by the political issues between the two powers. 
The US embargo on trade with China was lifted in April 1971, 
permitting commercial transactions between US firms and Chinese trading 
corporations for the first time in two decades. US importers have moved 
quickly to initiate certain specialty imports through intermediaries in Hong 
Kong and other countries. But Peking has been in no rush to expand its 
trade ties with the United States, indicating that trade expansion with the 
United States would follow, not precede, the solution of the Taiwan 
problem, UN membership for Peking, and a US withdrawal from Vietnam. 
At the same time, China has not been penalizing itself by refusing to 
purchase equipment embodying advanced US technology. Where 
advantageous, it has been procuring American goods through subsidiaries 
of US companies or indirectly through third parties. It also is preparing 
for direct trade by hinting to US traders that they may be invited to the 
October 1971 trade fair in Canton. 
The potential for US-China trade is limited by several factors. China's 
foreign trade is small in relation to total output and is likely to grow only 
slowly because of a policy of economic self-sufficiency, a conservative 
attitude toward foreign indebtedness, and a limited range of export goods. 
And China already has well-established trading relationships with low-cost 
suppliers of its major import needs of grain, fertilizer, and machinery. 
Nevertheless, there are obvious possibilities for commercial relations 
between the two countries. Potential Chinese exports to the United States 
include specialty foods, crude animal materials such as bristles and feathers, 
and luxury products such as rugs, embroideries, silks, art objects, and curios. 
China would have difficulty in achieving large-scale penetration of US 
markets with its major exports of textiles and staple foodstuffs. 
For the near future, China is most likely to be interested in US 
industrial goods embodying advanced technology and not available from 
other sources. And the key question for any sale would be whether or 
not such goods would be licensed for export to China. Advanced computers, 
petrochemical equipment, and offshore drilling equipment are prime 
examples of such goods. China may also include US goods in its worldwide 
search for commercial aircraft, trucks, truck components, and scientific 
instruments. Finally, China may occasionally purchase US grain, steel, or 
chemical fertilizers if it wishes to make a political gesture or if it faces 
greatly increased domestic requirements for these items. 
In summary, political uncertainties make any estimate of the future 
volume of US-China trade highly speculative. Perhaps by the mid-1970s 
imports and exports might each be in the range of $100-$200 million 
annually.

1953-57: 
1958-60: 
1961-65: 
1966-69: 
1970-75: 
Rehabilitation: restoration of railroads, factories, and water 
control systems to operation; provision of stable currency; 
evening out of food supplies; establishment of economic law 
and order. 
First Five-Year Plan: successful Soviet-style plan for building 
up capacity and production in basic industries ? steel, coal, 
electric power, cement, simple machinery; good start on 
defense industries; collectivization of agriculture with 
emphasis on investment from local resources; import of 
machinery and technology from Communist countries. 
Great Leap Forward: attempt at instant industrialization 
through frenzied increase in tempo of industry and 
agriculture; backyard steel furnaces and other wasteful small 
industrial projects; unwieldy supercollectives (communes) in 
agriculture; ban on private plots; breakdown of planning and 
statistical system; withdrawal of Soviet technicians in 
mid-1960; poor harvests in 1959, 1960, and 1961; acute food 
shortages especially in the winter of 1960-61. 
Readjustment and Recovery: emergency measures to regain 
tolerable food balance, including annual import of 4-5 
million metric tons of grain beginning in 1961, restoration 
of smaller collective units in agriculture, permissive attitude 
toward private plots, and increase of industrial inputs to 
agriculture; shutting down of wasteful industrial production 
and concentration of industrial investment on weapons, 
petroleum, electronics, and fertilizer industries; shift of trade 
from Communist countries to Industrial West. 
Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: Maoist attempt to 
revitalize revolution by reversing trends toward 
bureaucratization, "expertism," and material incentives; 
unleashing of youthful Red Guards with subsequent 
assumption of power by army; damage to industrial 
production in 1967-68 (down 15%0-20%) and foreign trade 
(down 10% in 1967-68), but little damage to agriculture 
which had good weather and might even have benefited from 
lessened control. 
Resumption of Regular Planning: general trend to political 
and economic moderation and announcement of Fourth 
Five-Year Plan for 1971-75; record industrial and agricultural 
production in 1970; petroleum and armaments industries as 
pace-setters; release of a few national production figures, 
possibly foreshadowing lifting of 11-year statistical blackout.

QUESTIONS FREQUENTLY ASKED ABOUT THE CHINESE ECONOMY 
Q. Is China likely to spill across its boundaries to seize the "rice 
bowl" area of Southeast Asia? 
A. No. The rice surplus in this area at the most is 5 million tons, 
which is only 2%-3% of China's current grain production. Furthermore, if 
the Chinese took the area, the surplus could well vanish because of disrupted 
incentives; at the minimum, the surplus could not be procured and 
transported cost-free. Finally, China could obtain 5 million additional tons 
of grain at much less risk and cost by other means -- for example, by 
buying additional grain or fertilizer abroad or by reallocating resources at 
home. Of course, China's leadership could move into Southeast Asia for 
political or military reasons or because of an erroneous assessment of the 
economic issues involved. 
Q. Are the Chinese people better off economically under the 
Communist government than they were before 1949? 
A. Yes. With the exception of 1960-61, the Chinese have had enough 
to eat since the Communists came to power, and the stability of economic 
life has been greatly improved because of the elimination of large-scale 
famine, inflation, brigandage, civil war, and epidemics as well as of the 
marked reduction in the effects of flood and drought. The majority of 
the people lead more secure lives, economically speaking. The 5%-10% of 
the people at the top in pre-Communist days fled the country, were killed, 
or were dispossessed. 
Q. Is the distribution of income egalitarian under the Chinese 
Communists? 
A. Yes. The distribution of income and perquisites is more nearly 
equal than in any other major country. Distinctions in pay, dress, mode

of transport, and life style are surprisingly small between the average worker 
and the plant manager. Party members are enjoined to live frugally, and 
opportunities for conspicuous consumption are few. The Cultural 
Revolution was launched by Mao in part because he thought the cadres 
were losing this egalitarian spirit. 
Q. Does Communist China have an inflation problem? 
A. No. Prices, wages, and rents in the modern part of the economy 
are fixed by government fiat and effectively enforced. In the countryside, 
much economic activity is contained within the household and another large 
share is conducted on a barter basis. The "share-out" of the crop at the 
end of the harvest season is largely in kind. Still another part of rural output 
goes for taxes paid in kind to the government or as a quota sold to the 
government at fixed prices. Inputs of fertilizer and equipment are paid for 
by the collective unit at fixed prices. Local markets may have fluctuating 
prices, but buying for resale is prohibited and prices far out of line normally 
would be the subject of official action. 
Q. How do the Chinese manage to have a balanced foreign trade 
account? 
A. State foreign trade corporations are authorized to contract for 
only those goods which are covered by export earnings. When exports falter, 
as happened during the Cultural Revolution, imports are correspondingly 
tightened. The trade with individual nations does not necessarily balance --
for example, China uses its large trade surplus with Hong Kong and 
Southeast Asia to cover its trade deficits with Japan, Canada, and Western 
Europe. 
Q. How have the Chinese Communists eradicated the opium 
problem? 
A. Stringent controls over opium poppy production and use were 
adopted at the 21st session of the State Council on 24 February 1950. 
Basically the statute prohibited the private importation, processing, and sale 
of opium and other narcotics. However, government controlled production 
continues and is reflected in the small quantities of raw opium and poppy 
husks which are legally exported from time to time. The tight political 
control exercised by the government over its citizens has probably made 
the enforcement of these laws quite effective in most areas of the country. 
Control over production and trade in the southern border areas 
has probably been more difficult, and scattered reports in recent years 
indicate that small amounts of illicit opium are produced and traded in 
the tribal areas of the south.

The following descriptions of Mao's favorite novels reveal some of his 
character traits: The stories involve military heroes, who demonstrate 
acts of daring and cunning; a band of brigands who live in the mountains 
and in Robinhood style, prey on arrogant and corrupt officials and the 
wealthy, and are kind to the poor and helpless; wars and intrigue among 
noblemen and their cohorts, in the early days of China; and a large 
Chinese family, living in former days of the emperors, with all of its 
members' daily happenings, romances, quarrels, happy and sad events, 
intermixed with numerous mystical e,:rents and spirit interventions, 
replete with symbolism. 
Judging from the tales and from Mao's comments about them, from his 
youth and still [recently, he announced he had just completed a re-reading 
of one of the novels], Mao has been and is very much involved with: 
a) - China's military conquests and ancient military traditions; 
b) Physical bravery, especially in combat; 
c) Solutions to various problems through use of force or cunning; 
d) Robbing the rich and powerful and helping the poor and oppressed; 
e) Mystical happenings; 
f) Crude and often cruel humor, in human relations; 
g) Life in the days of the emperors; 
h) Merciless and hostile treatment of outsiders or foreigners; 
1) An appreciation for nature's beauty, especially in the mountains; 
j) Lust and lusty living; and 
k) Delicate and often poignant human relationships, especially 
between lovers. 
Whether Mao Tse-tung reads and re-reads his favorite novels because 
they are excellent Chinese "escape" entertainment and purely for 
entertainment, or because he, himself, identifies with the characters 
depicted, of course can be debated. However, when linked with his own 
comments about some of the novels and his own writings, including his 
writings about combat, and also in the light of Mao's record, we are 
justified in concluding that Mao is not reading solely for entertainment 
or to escape, but rather he identifies with the characters. As is true 
of everyone and usually to a greater degree in national leaders who 
have gained and held their power in large measure by force and device, 
Mao is a complex man. He has all of the characteristics suggested in 
the list of topics, a) through j), above. Of course, he has other 
characteristics as well.

No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
But it is clear not only from his record and his own writings but also 
from his favorite reading materials that Mao is a militant, devious 
and brave (to the point of being rash) man, utterly without scruples 
by western standards, and not only cannot be trusted to keep his word, 
but can be expected to use trickery and to do whatever he feels is in 
his or his side's interest and within their capacity. Mao not only is 
willing to indulge in artifice, both in human dealings and in combat--
he prefers to do so and considers tricks and devices as the best 
possible route to his objectives. 
One theme which runs through two of his novels, above all, is the 
winning of battles, cities or wenches, by trickery. Failing that, the 
central theme is sudden force. Judging from his reading materials 
and mainly from two of the favorite novels (Shui Hu Chuan, or Water 
Margin, called All Men are Brothers in Pearl Buck's translation; and 
San Kuo Chih, or Romance of the Three Kingdoms), it is fortunate for 
us from the long-range view that Mao Tse-tung is now well advanced 
in years. It may be hoped that the leaders of the People's Republic 
who succeed him may at least in degree be men of some personal honor 
by eastern standards. Of course, Mao's very traits described above, 
under pressure from Russia and Japan against China at this time, may 
be part of what has enabled him to turn to us for some sort of implicit 
or greater assistance, notwithstanding-the fact that ideologically we 
are not acceptable to him. In other words, the very traits in Mao 
which are dangerous to us also are dangerous to Russia and Japan. 
As with the heroes in the two novels mentioned, Mao will not permit 
any ideological differences to prevent him from temporarily cooperating 
with us. But we must not expect anything permanent from him in the 
area of cooperation, unless it lies in his own interests and those of 
China.

Description of the Novels  
a) Shui Hu Chuan (Water Margin or, All Men are Brothers. 
The book originated with a series of orally told tales, and evolved 
through many forms. In its present form it was probably written in 
the early or middle part of the Ming Dynasty, in the fourteenth or 
fifteenth century. However, written editions of portions of the book 
?,--existed in the twelfth or thirteenth centuries. 
The story is set in the thirteenth century at a period in Chinese history 
When the Sung Dynasty was falling into decadence and disorder under 
the reign of the Emperor Hung Chung. 
The characters are 138 men, thirty-six of whom are chief characters. 
For various reasons connected with unjust officials, oppressive 
government and evil social conditions, the men variously have been 
compelled to flee from society and take refuge on a great mountain 
(Liang Shan Pt()) set in a lake and surrounded by a reedy marsh. The 
mountain is situated in Shantung Province. Here the fugitives gather 
and join forces as an organized group. It is believed that the story 
is based on history, and that the thirty-six chief robbers were men 
who lived at the end of the north Sung Dynasty and ravaged central China 
and defied the state soldiers. They were popular with the poor people, 
whom they never harmed. 
The book was banned by the Chinese emperors, and its printing, sale, 
purchase or reading were forbidden, for example, in the written 
imperial mandates of the Ch'ing Dynasty. 
The episodes are entertaining and lusty reading. In addition to being 
good yarns, they manifest the traits and topics listed under the 
Introduction. 
1) Mao's Comments About the Story Shui Hu Chuan  
A number of comments about the story by Mao Tse-tung have been 
reported, all of course complimentary. Perhaps significant is the 
following: 
When Mao was a student in Changsha, and a group of his friends 
and he were discussing ways of saving China from its decadent 
conditions under the Ch'ing Dynasty and in a period involving 
No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
Western encroachments and internal disorders, a number of 
suggestions were made by the other students, including going into 
politics or teaching future generations of students to reform. 
Mao is reliably reported [by a former friend, who at the time of 
his report was on Taiwan] to have objected to the other methods as 
taking too long. Mao then offered his own solution: "Imitate the 
heroes of Liang Shan P'o." [the robbers' mountain hideout]1 The 
probable authenticity of that report tends to be confirmed by a 
similar report by Edgar Snow, who wrote that the fighting methods 
of the mountain robbers of Liang Shan P'o were being taught to 
recruits by Mao Tse-tung and his fellow revolutionaries, in their 
Yenan training area. 2 
2) Edgar Snow's Comments Abaat the Story Shui Hu Chuan  
Edgar Snow, in his book Red Star Over China, 3 describes an episode 
in Yenan, in which he was alarmed by sudden wild shouts near him 
and saw recruits brandishing spears, pikes and rifles and uttering 
fierce battle cries. He reported that later he learned that the 
curriculum for partisans included the rehearsal of ancient Chinese 
war cries, just as in the days of feudal tourneys described "in one 
of Mao Tee-twig's favorite books, the  Shui Hu Chuan. One is 
reminded, also, of the wild war cries and constant bugle calls 
reported of the Chinese communist soldiers in Korea during our 
war there. 
b) San Kuo Chili Yen-I, or Romance of the Three Kingdoms  
The novel began its existence more than one thousand years ago4 in 
the form of stories orally told. It progressed, in various segments and 
in various forms, through a number of increasingly lengthy versions. 
The one commonly read by the Chinese dates from the seventeenth 
century. The work is an historical novel based on the-wars of the 
Three Kingdoms which fought for supremacy at the beginning of the 
third century A. D.

No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
The three kingdoms were named Shu, Wu and Wei, and the period 
covered is from around 220 A. D. until 265 A, D., when the last ruler 
of Wei fell to the state of Chin (Tsin), and the China of that day again 
became united under an emperor. The main outline of the events 
related in the novel is historical, and the chief characters in the book 
are all historical figures from China's past. However, most of the 
hundreds of incidents are fictional, having resulted from centuries 
of slow accretion and collection. Even hundreds of years before one 
of the earlier written versions is reported to have circulated in the 
fourteenth century, generations of popular storytellers, dramatists 
and poets were adding to this epic. 
The chief characters in the novel include. Liu Pei, the legitimate 
heir to the fallen Han Dynasty throne, 'ho is idealized; Kuan Yu, a 
brilliant and learned man; and. Chang Fei, who is plebeian and unlettered, 
very human in the Chinese sense and, therefore, a man of warmth, 
gusto, energy and humor. Another important character is Ts'ao Ts'ao, 
the wily, cunning, treacherous and merciless "villain-hero" of the 
novel. The story begins with the prologue, "Empires wax and wane; 
states cleave asunder and coalesce." It then deals with the fall of the 
Chinese Han empire, the adventures of the three central characters 
(Liu Pei, Kuan Yu and Chang Fei, the wars among the three kingdoms 
for control, the defeat of the Shu and Wu kingdoms by the Wei kingdom, 
and Wei's eventual collapse before the emergent new Chin (Tsin) empire. 
1) Keys to Mao's Character Traits, and to Those of His  
Colleagues, Derived from This Novel  
Frequently, an attempt to read a man's character traits by examining 
his favorite books is a dangerous exercise. Many different motivations 
either control or at least affect choices of reading material. However, 
when it has been established that a particular book or group of books 
have been read and re-read by the subject of one's scrutiny, and when 
as in Mao's case the books are frequently quoted or discussed, the 
possibility that the book, its subject matter and its characters at least 
to some substantial degree mirror the reader's interests and leanings 
becomes stronger. 
Both novels illustrate a frank departure by their characters from the 
noble concepts of Confucius, and a lusty passion for artifice intermixed 
with violence, in dealings with all opponents, "allies," outsiders, and 
No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
even each other. In these novels, one finds echoes across the centuries 
of such modern-day People's Republic attributes and procedures, as 
? the sudden falls of Liu Shao-ch'i; Lin Piao; and others; and the Hundred 
Flowers episode, in which criticism was invited and then the criticisers 
were trapped and punished; and the sudden Korean attacks, with war 
cries and blowing bugles; and the techniques of warfare, involving 
extraordinary and dangerous night river crossings, attacks from 
_3impossibleu mountain peaks, and guerrilla tactics; and the use of the 
Red Guards to destroy or try to destroy a rival faction; and many other 
things we have seen the Chinese communists do. 
The difference between these novels and .our own approximately similar 
stories (e.g., King ArthurrCharlethaVie; Richard the Lion Hearted and 
the Crusades; John Paul Jones) involves two significant distinctions: 
(1) Our leaders do not almost worship and constantly read our legendary 
stories, and do not cite them and quote from them, at frequent 
intervals, but the Chinese communists do exactly that; and (2) our 
western such legendary stories stress courage, strength, the direct 
and usually frontal assault on the enemies, and honor, in the sense 
that artifice is not admired, but the Chinese heroes in Mao's favorite  
novels almost always use guile and artifice, and are greatly admired  
for using those devices. 
One example from Romance of the Three Kingdoms is typical of hundreds 
like it, and should be considered in connection with Mao Tse-tung's 
boasts that he equipped his armies, sometimes by feints and tricks, 
from the enemy armies. Consider this episode from Romance of the  
Three Kingdoms: [Paraphrased to avoid undue length] 
The great commander Chu-ko Liang's forces were short of arrows, 
and needed to replenish them. He sent a force of some twenty ships 
to feign an attack on the fleet of his powerful enemy; Ts'ao Ts 'ao. 
The decks of Liang's ships were apparently covered with large 
numbers of fighting men, but these in reality were only straw figures 
stuffed into soldiers uniforms. On each ship there were only a few 
sailors and some real soldiers with gongs and other noisy instruments. 
Reaching their destination, as had been carefully calculated beforehand, 
in the middle of a dense fog, the soldiers at once began to beat their 
gongs as if about to go into action; whereupon Ts'ao Ts'ao, who could 
just make out the outlines of the vessels densely packed with fighting 
men bearing down on him, gave orders to his archers to begin shooting. 
The latter did so, and kept on for an hour or more, until Liang on one 
of his ships was satisfied with the enormous amounts of arrows by 
then sticking in his straw soldiers.?So he passed the order to retreat, 
again fully equipped with arrows for his forces.

? 2) Contrast Between Confucian Teachings and the Views  
? Reflected in Mao's Favorite Novels, and by Mao and His  
Colleagues  
The practices of deceit, artifice, guile, military action, force and 
similar things so valued by Mao and his colleagues and with which his 
favorite novels are filled, all were looked upon with disgust by 
Confucius and most of China's other great philosophers and teachers. 
The traditional Chinese teachings stress the moral qualities we 
Westerners admire, although of course we ourselves are not wholly 
moral, by any means. We are talking about ideologies, and what we 
strive for, rather than perfect conditions. Under the teachings of 
Confucius and most of the other philoso_phers, and pursuant to our own 
Western codes of conduct, gie?characteristics shown in Mao's favorite 
novels and in the expressions and actions of the People's Republic are 
abhorrent. The People's Republic expressly and by its actions has 
made heroes out of the villains in China's history, under the teachings 
of Confucius and the other philosophers. And they have made heroes 
out of the men in Mao's favorite novels. One example of the People's 
Republic express and official reversal of a former villain into a hero 
is Ch'in Chili Huang Ti, who by force of arms and guile between 
255 B. C. and 214 B. C., unified China; re-established the empire, as 
the Ch'in Dynasty; burned all books, ad executed any scholars caught 
with the forbidden books; completed the Great Wall, with slave labor 
and the deaths at the Great Wall, of hundreds of thousands of such 
slaves; and ruled as a tyrant. Confucius held that emperor as an 
example of the worst possible kind of emperor; and Mao and his 
colleagues praise him, as an historic hero. He is praised for his 
military ability, for his administrative ability, for unifying China, and 
for his strength. His excesses are explained away, in effect as necessary 
under the circumstances and as acceptable in the light of what he 
accomplished. 
In understanding the pre-Mao Chinese and what Mao is trying to make 
them into, in the context of these novels and what they reflect, it is 
important to note that during the periods of the Confucius and similar 
impact on the Chinese, their ideals and goals involved a high order of 
morality. Tyrants existed, but they were held in contempt. Actually, 
as far as her rulers for the most part were concerned, during the 
periods guided by the Confucius and similar ideals, Confucianism was 
a noble procedural and ritualistic cloke, covering an absolute and often 
cruel and militant emperor (and his cohorts). But the point is, 
Confucianism had a moderating influence on the rulers, and did tend to 
guide and deeply affect the populace. And as for Mao's favorite novels, 
which also have been the favorites of most of the literate Chinese since 
No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
they were written, although they were read and hugely enjoyed, it was 
with a sense of "oh my, how terrible--but that was in the ancient days," 
and not with the Maoist sense of candid, even exultant, delight and 
admiration. The Maoists and especially Mao Tse-tung himself, recommend 
that the heroes of the favorite novels be admired, praised and emulated. 
c) Hung Lou Meng - Dream of the Red Chamber 
The English title for this novel, although effective, is not a correct 
translation. Actually, Hung Lou Meng literally translates as, "Dream 
of the Two-Storied Red Building, " which of course is a bad title in 
English, and not as romantically suggestive as the title, Dream of the  
Red Chamber. It is possible that the Chinese title is describing the 
home in which the family involved in the novel lived. 
The novel is semi-autobiographical, and was written around 1757 by a 
middle-aged gentleman named Tsao Hsueh-chin. He was a son of a 
man of wealth and scholarship, and his family for generations had held 
the Inspectorship of the Imperial Silk Factories in the Province of 
Kansu. The author in his early life enjoyed luxuries and similar 
advantages. Although apparently a gifted youth and an accomplished 
poet in later life, the author failed at the Imperial Literary Examinations. 
Without the political and financial success then going with success in the 
examinations, he suffered hardship when his family experienced financial 
and social reverses. He was in poverty when the novel was written, 
and died at the age of forty-five. 
Dream of the Red Chamber is extremely long, and in the Chinese usually 
is published in 24 volumes, each of about thirty pages, or approximately 
4,000 pages in all. Over four hundred characters are involved in the 
story. Basically, the story is that of the author and his family, and it 
is a panorama of life of a distinguished but increasingly troubled Chinese 
family. It depicts the members' and their friends', lovers', enemies' 
and servants' inter-reactions and daily relationships. The novel is also 
a love story, full of humorous and pathetic episodes of everyday human 
life, interspersed with short poems of high literary finish. The opening 
chapters deal with the world of spirits and the supernatural. Then the 
story unfolds on an everyday basis, but punctuated with the near 
presence of spiritual influences.

No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
The novel is a good and detailed report as to the Chinese customs, 
family life and thinking of the mid-Ch'ing dynasty. The People's 
Republic-approved commentaries describe the work as of historical 
interest, and as an example of the feudal and imperial periods. 
Certainly, it is both of the things it is stated to be, but it is somewhat 
difficult to understand the People's Republic's condonation of the 
publication of any novel containing so much of the magic, supernatural 
,and similar aspects of Chinese life in the "old days." Although replete 
with symbolism, magic, fanciful and spirit-world ideas, and although 
interesting at points in its depiction of what appears to be an almost 
word-for-word history of a well educated and formerly wealthy family 
in the recent imperial age, at least in the English version, the novel 
sometimes makes difficult ieading.. 
Moreover, the work does not seem to dovetail with Mao Tse-tung's 
other reading preferences, or with his speeches and writings, in that 
it portrays tragic failures; some individuals who are listless; and a 
sad spiral downward, on the part of the family and the two lovers. 
Perhaps, Mao wants his people to read a novel showing the decadence 
of the old system. Or perhaps, he himself enjoys the excellent 
poetry which occurs throughout the work, in that Mao, himself, in an 
accomplished poet. Or, perhaps,- it is-not a fact that this is one of 
his favorite novels, as has been claimed by authorized comments by 
representatives of the People's Republic. 
The book is included on the PRC's "approved list" because it does 
reflect against the way of life in the imperial days, because the Chinese 
regard it as fascinating to read, generally, and because Mao enjoys 
reading the story of a courtly family, within the imperial circle, in 
some measure because he, himself, was raised as a farm boy and the 
son of a peasant, and never experienced any of the gracious and courtly 
aspects of Chinese culture in his youth. I believe that -although Mao is 
against decadence and wealth, nevertheless he enjoys looking through 
the windowpane at what is going on inside, to stare in amazement and 
fascination before turning away in official disgust.

THE BANKRUPTCY OF? 
THE IDEALIST CONCEPTION OF HISTORY 
? 
September 16, 1949 
The Chinese should thank Acheson, spokesman of the U.S. bour-
geoisie, not merely because he has explicitly confessed to the fact that 
the United States supplied the money and guns and Chiang Kai-shek 
the men to fight for the United States and slaughter the Chinese people 
and because he has thus given Chinese progressives evidence with 
which to convince the backward elements. You see, hasn't Acheson 
himself confessed that the great, sanguinary war of the last few years, 
which cost the lives of millions of Chinese, was planned and organized 
by U.S. imperialism? The Chinese should thank Acheson, again not 
merely because he has openly declared that the United States intends 
to recruit the so-called "democratic individualists" in China, organize 
a U.S. fifth column and overthrow the People's Government led by 
the Communist Party of China and has thus alerted the Chinese, 
especially those tinged with liberalism, who are promising each other 
not to be taken in by the Americans and are all on guard against the 
underhand intrigues of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese should thank 
Acheson also because he has fabricated wild talcs about modern 
Chinese history; and his conception of history is precisely that shared 
by a section of the Chinese intellectuals, namely, the bourgeois idealist 
conception of history. Hence, a refutation pf Acheson may benefit 
many Chinese by widening their horizon. The benefit may be even 
greater to those whose conception is the same, or in certain respects 
the same, as Acheson's. 
What are Acheson's wild fabrications about modern Chinese his-
tory? First of all, he tries to explain the occurrence of the Chinese 
revolution in terms of economic and ideological conditions in China. 
Here he has recounted many myths. 
Acheson says:

MAO TSE-TUNG 
The population of China during the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries doubled, thereby creating an unbearable pressure upon 
the land. The first problem which every Chinese Government 
has had to face is that of feeding this population. So far none 
has succeeded. The Kuomintang attempted to solve it by putting 
many land-reform laws on the statute books. Some of these 
Jaws have failed, others have been ignored. In no small measure, 
the predicament in which the National Govern -nent finds itself 
today is due to its failure to provide China with enough to eat. 
A large part of the Chinese Communists' propaganda consists of 
promises that they will solve the land problem. 
To those Chinese who do not reason clearly the above sounds 
plausible. Too many mouths, too little food, hence revolution. The 
Kuomintang has failed to solve this problem and it is unlikely that the 
Communist Party will be able to solve it either. "So far none has 
succeeded." 
Do revolutions arise from over-population? There have been 
many revolutions, ancient and modern, in China and abroad; were 
they all due to over-population? Were China's many revolutions in 
the past few thousand years also due to over-population? Was the 
American Revolution against Britain 174 years agol also due to over-
population? Acheson's knowledge of history is nil. He has not 
even read the American Declaration of Independence. Washington, 
Jefferson and others made the revolution against Britain because of 
British oppression and exploitation of the Americans, and not because 
of any over-population in America. Each time the Chinese people 
? overthrew a feudal dynasty it was because of the oppression and ex-
ploitation of the people by that feudal dynasty, and not because of 
any over-population. The Russians made the February Revolution 
and the October Revolution because of oppression and exploitation 
by the tsar and the Russian bourgeoisie., not because of any over-
population, for to this day in Russia there is a great abundance of 
land as compared with people'. In Mongolia, where the land is so 
vast and the population so sparse, a revolution would be incon-
ceivable according to Acheson's line of reasoning, yet it took place 
some time ago.3 
According to Acheson, China has no way*out at all. A popula-
tion of 475 million constitutes an 'unbearable pressure" and, revolution 
or no revolution, the case is hopeless. Acheson pins great hope on

No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/01/14: LOC-HAK-115-10-1-1 
BANKRUPTCY-OF IDEALIST CONCEPTION OF II/STORY 453 
this; although he has not voiced this hope, it has often been revealed 
by a number of American journalists ? through the allegation that the 
Communist Party of China will not be able to solve its economic prob-
lems, that China will remain in perpetual chaos and that her only way 
out is to live on U.S. flour, in other words, to become a U.S. colony. 
Why did the Revolution of 1911 not succeed and .why did it not 
solve the problem of feeding the population? Because it overthrew 
only the Ching Dynasty but did not overthrow imperialist and feudal 
oppression and exploitation. 
Why did the Northern Expedition of 1926-27 not succeed and 
why did it not solve the problem of feeding the population? Because 
Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, surrendered to imperialism 
and became the chieftain of the counter-revolution which oppressed 
and exploited the Chinese. 
Is it true that "so far none has succeeded"? In the old Liberated 
Areas in northwestern, northern, northeastern and eastern China, 
where the land problem has already been solved, does the problem of 
"feeding this population", as Acheson puts it, still exist? The United 
States has kept quite a number of spies or so-called observers in China. 
Why have they not ferreted out even this fact? In places like Shang-
hai, the problem of unemployment, or of feeding .the population, arose 
solely because of cruel, heartless oppression and exploitation by 
imperialism, feudalism, bureaucrat-capitalism and the reactionary 
Kuomintang government. Under the People's Covernment, it will 
take only a few years for this problem of unemployment, or of feeding 
the population, to be solved as completely as in the northern, north-
eastern and other parts of the country. 
It is a very good thing that China has a big population. Even 
if China's population multiplies many times, she is fully capable of 
finding a solution; the solution is production. The absurd argument 
of Western bourgeois economists like Malthus3 that increases in food

refuted in theory by Marxists long ago, but has also been completely 
exploded by the realities in the Soviet Union and the Liberated 
Areas of China after their revolutions. Basing itself on the truth 
that revolution plus production can solve the problem of feeding the 
population, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China 
has issued orders to Party organizations and the People's Liberation 
Army throughout die country not to dismiss but to retain all former 
Kuomintang personnel, provided they can make themselves useful

and are not confirmed reactionaries or notorious scoundrels. Where 
things are very difficult, food and housing will be shared. Those who 
have been dismissed and have no means of support will be reinstated 
and provided with a living. According to the same principle, we 
shall maintain all Kuomintang soldiers who have revolted and come 
over to us or been captured. All reactionaries, except the major 
culprits, will be given a chance to earn their living, provided they show 
repentance. 
Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under 
the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, 
every kind of miracle can be performed. We arc refuters of Acheson's 
counter-revolutionary theory. We believe that revolution can change 
everything, and that before long there will arise a new China with 
a big population and a great wealth of products, where life will be 
abundant and culture will flourish. All pessimistic views are utterly 
groundless. 
"The impact of the West" is given by Acheson as the second 
reason why the Chinese revolution occurred. Acheson says: 
For more than three thousand years the Chinese developed 
their own high culture and civilization, largely untouched by out-
side influences. Even when subjected to military conquest the 
Chinese always managed in the end to subdue and absorb the 
invader. It was natural therefore that they should come to look 
upon themselves as the center of the world and the highest 
expression of civilized mankind. Then in the middle of the 
nineteenth century the heretofore impervious wall of Chinese isola-
tion was breached by the West. These outsiders brought with 
them aggressiveness, the unparalleled development of Western 
technology, and a high order of culture which had not ACCOM-
panied previous foreign incursions into China. Partly because of 
these qualities and partly because of the decay of Manchu rule, 
the Westerners, instead of being 'absorbed by the Chinese, intro-
duced new ideas which played an important part in stimulating 
ferment and unrest. 
To those Chinese who do not reason clearly, what Achcson says 
sounds plausible the influx of new ideas from the West gave rise 
to the revolution. 
Against whom was the revolution.. directed? Because there was 
"decay of Manchu rule" and because it is the weak point that is

attacked, it would seem that the revolution was directed against the 
Ching Dynasty. 13ut what Acheson says here is not quite right. The 
Revolution of 1911 was directed against imperialism. The Chinese 
directed the revolution against the Ching regime because it was the 
running dog of imperialism. The war against Britain's opium aggres-
sion, the war against the aggression of the Anglo-French allied forces, 
the war against the Ching regime, the running dog of imperialism, by 
the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom,4 the war against French aggression, 
the war against Japanese aggression and the war again ;t the aggression 
of the allied forces of the eight powers ? all ended in failure; hence 
the Revolution of 1911 broke out against the running dog of impe-
rialism, the Ching Dynasty. That is modern Chinese history up to 
1911. What is the "impact of the West", as Acheson calls it? It is 
the effort of the Western bourgeoisie, as Marx and Engels said in the 
Manifesto of the Communist Party of 1848,5 to remould the world after 
its own image by means of terror. In the process of this impact or 
remoulding, the Western bourgeoisie, which needed compradors and 
flunkeys familiar with Western customs, had to let 'countries like China 
open schools and send students abroad, and thus "new ideas were in-
troduced" into China. Concurrently the national bourgeoisie and the 
proletariat were born in countries like China. At the same time, the 
peasantry was bankrupted, and a huge semi-proletariat was brought 
into existence. Thus the Western bourgeoisie created two categories 
of people in the East, a small minority, the flunkeys of imperialism, 
and a majority which is opposed to imperialism and consists of the 
working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie, the national 
bourgeoisie and the intellectuals coming from these classes. Those 
in the majority group are all grave-diggers of imperialism, who were 
created by imperialism itself, and the revolution originates from them. 
It was not that the so-called influx of ideas from the West stirred up 
"ferment and unrest", but that imperialist aggression provoked 
resistance. 
For a long time in the course of this resistance movement, that 
? is, for over seventy years from the Opium War of 1840 to the eve of 
the May 4th Movement of 1919, the Chinese had no ideological weapon 
with which to defend themselves against iMperialism. The ideo-
logical weapons of the old die-hard feudalism were defeated, had to 
give way and were declared bankrupt. Having no other choice, the 
Chinese were compelled to arm themselves witli such ideological cap-
ons and political formulas as the theory of evolution, the theory of

natural rights and of the bourgeois republic, which were all borrowed 
from the arsenal of the revolutionary period of the bourgeoisie in the 
West, the native home of imperialism. The Chinese organized polit-
ical parties and made revolutions, believing that they could thus resist 
foreign powers and build a republic. However, all these ideological 
weapons, like those of feudalism, proved very feeble and in their 
turn had to give way and were withdrawn and declared bankrupt. 
The Russian Revolution of 1917 awakened the Chinese, and they 
learned something new, Marxism-Leninism. In China, the Com-
? munist Party was born, an epoch-making event. Sun Yat-sen, too, 
advocated "learning from Russia" and "alliance with Russia and the 
Communist Party". In a word, from: that time China changed her 
orientation. 
Being the spokesman of an imperialist. government, Acheson nat-
urally does not want to breathe even a word about imperialism. He 
describes imperialist aggression thus: "These outsiders brought with 
them aggressiveness...." "Aggressiveness" ? what a beautiful name! 
Having learned this "aggressiveness", the Chinese did not aggress 
into Britain or the United States but only created "ferment and 
unrest" inside China, i.e., carried out revolutions against imperialism 
and its running dogs. But unfortunately they never once succeeded; 
each time, they were defeated by the imperialists, the inventors of 
"aggressiveness". The Chinese therefore turned around to learn 
something else and, strangely enough, they immediately found that 
it worked. 
The Chinese Communist Party "had been organized in the early 
twenties under the ideological impetus of the Russian revolution". 
Here Acheson is right. This ideology was none other than Marxism-
Leninism. This ideology is immeasurably. superior to that of the 
Western bourgeoisie, which Acheson calls a "high order of culture 
which had not accompanied previous foreign incursions into China". 
The clinching proof of the effectiveness of this ideology is that Western 
bourgeois culture, which the Achesons can boast of as a "high order of 
culture" compared with China's old feudal culture, was defeated the 
moment it encountered the new Marxist-Leninist culture, the scientific 
world outlook and the theory of social revolution, which the Chinese 
people had acquired. In its first battle, this scientific and revolution-
ary new culture acquired by the Chinese people defeated the Northern 
warlords, the running dogs of imperialism; in the second, it defeated 
the attempts by another running dog of jrnperialism, Chiang Kai-shek,

to intercept the Chinese Red Army during its 25,0oo-1i Long March ;6 
in the third, it defeated Japanese imperialism and its running dog, 
Wang Ching-wei; and in the fourth, it finally put an end to the domina-
tion of China by the United States and all other imperialist powers 
as well as to the rule of their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek and all 
the other reactionaries. 
The reason why Marxism-Leninism has played such a great role 
in China since its introduction is that China's. social conditions call 
for it, that it has been linked with the actual practice of the Chinese 
people's revolution and that the Chinese people have grasped it. Any 
ideology ? even the very best, even Marxism-Leninism itself is in-
effective unless it is linked with objective realities, meets objectively 
existing needs and has been grasped by the masses of the people. We 
are historical materialists, opposed to historical idealism. 
Oddly enough, "Soviet doctrine and practice had a measurable 
effect upon the thinking and principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, particularly 
in.terms of economics and Party organization". What was the effect 
produced on Dr. Sun by the "high order of culture" of the West, of 
which Acheson and his like are so proud? Acheson doesn't say. 
Was it an accident that Dr. Sun, who devoted the greater part of his 
life to seeking from Western bourgeois culture the truth that would 
save the nation, was finally disappointed and turned to "learning 
from Russia"? Obviously not. Of course it was no accident that 
Dr. Sun and the long suffering Chinese people he represented were 
all infuriated by the "impact of the West" and resolved to form an 
"alliance with Russia and the Communist Party" in order to wage 
a life-and-death struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. 
Acheson dare not say here that the Soviet people are imperialist 
aggressors and that Sun Yat-sen learned from aggressors. Well, then, 
if Sun Yat-sen could learn from the Soviet people and the Soviet 
people arc not imperialist aggressors, why can't his successors, the 
Chinese who live after him, learn from the Soviet people? Why are 
the Chinese, Sun Yat-sen excepted, described as "dominated by the 
Soviet Union" and as "the fifth column of the Comintern" and "lackeys 
of Red imperialism" for learning the scientific world outlook and the 
theory of social revolution through Marxism-Leninism, linking these 
with China's specific characteristics, starting the Chinese People's War 
of Liberation and the great people's revolution and founding a republic 
of the people's democratic dictatorship? Can there be such superior 
logic anywhere in the world? .

Since they learned Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese people have 
ceased to be passive in spirit and gained thc initiative. The period 
of modern world history in which the Chinese and Chinese culture 
were looked down upon should have ended from that moment. The 
great, victorious Chinese People's War of Liberation and the great 
people's revolution have rejuvenated and arc rejuvenating the great 
culture of thc Chinese people. In its spiritual aspect, this culture of the 
Chinese people already stands higher than any in the capitalist world. 
Take U.S. Secretary of State Acheson and his like, for instance. The 
level of their understanding of modern China and of the modern 
world is lower than that of an ordinary soldier of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army. 
Up to this point, Acheson, like a bourgeois professor lecturing 
on a tedious text, has pretended to trace the causes and effects of 
events in China. Revolution occurred in China, first, because of 
over-population and, second, because of the stimulus of Western 
ideas. You see, he appears to be a champion of the theory of causa-
tion. But in what follows, even this bit of tedious and phoney theory 
of causation disappears, and one finds only a mass of inexplicable 
events. Quite unaccountably, the Chinese fought among themselves 
for power and money, suspecting and hating each other. An in-
explicable change took place in the relative moral strength of the 
two contending parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; 
the morale of one party dropped sharply to below zero, while 
that of the other rose sharply to white heat. What was thc reason? 
Nobody knows. Such is the logic inherent in the "high order of 
culture" of the United States as represented by Dean Acheson.

geometrical ratio ... [while] the means of subsistence ? could not possibly be made 
to increase faster than in an arithmetical ratio". Basing himself on this arbitrary 
assumption, he came to the conclusion that all poverty and all evils in human society 
are permanent phenomena of nature. According to him, the only ways to solve the 
problem of poverty of the working people were to shorten their life-span, reduce the 
population Of stop Es increase. He regarded famine, pestilence and war as means 
? to cut down population. 
1 The War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was a peasant revolutionary war 
waged against the ft udal rule and national oppression of the Ching Dynasty in the 
middle of the Toth century. Hung Ilsiu-chuan, Yang Hsiu-ching and others, the 
? leaders of this revolution, staged an uprising in Kwangsi in January 1851 and pro-
craimed the founding of thc Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. In 1852 the peasant army 
proceeded northward from Kwangsi and matched through Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi 
and Anhwei and in 1853 it captured Nanking, the main city on the lower Yangtse. 
Part of its forces then continued the drive north and pushed to the vicinity of Tientsin, 
a major city in northern China. Because the Taiping army failed to build stable 
base areas in the places it occupied and also because, after establishing its capital in 
Nanking, the leading group in the army committed many political and military errors, 
it could not withstand the joint attack of the counter-revolutionary troops of the 
Ching government and the aggressors, Britain. the United States and France, and 
suffered defeat in 1864. 
5 See Manifesto of the Communist Party, Chapter I, "Bourgeois and Proletarians". 
The bourgeoisie "compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois 
mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into their 
midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its 
own image". 
6 In October 1934 the First. Third and Fifth Army Groups of the Chinese Workers' 
and Peasants' Red Army (that is, the First Front Army of the Red Army, also known 
as the Central Red Army) set out from Changting and Ninghua in western Fukien 
and from Juichin, Yutu and other places in southern Kiangsi and started a major 
strategic movement. In traversing the eleven provinces of Fukien, Kiangsi, Kwang-
tung, Hunan, Kwangsi, Kweichow, Szechuan, Yunnan, Sikang, Kansu and Shensi, 
crossing perpetually snow-capped mountains and trackless grasslands, sustaining untold 
hardships and frustrating the enemy's repeated encirclements, pursuits, obstructions 
and interceptions, the Red Army covered 25,oco /i (xz,5oo kilometres) on this march 
and finally arrived triumphantly at the revolutionary base area in northern Shensi in 
October too.
