 Administration
 1.   Though $`inkiang Province declared its allegiance to the Chinese Communist
 government an 26 September 1949, the movement of Chinese troops into the
 Province was not completed until in January of the succeeding year.  Once
 the Chinese Communist army had arrived, -the provincial administration was
 taken over, and army officers were appointed to all civil departments.
 The former officials were placed in camps for ideological training, during
 which their past records were investigated in detail.  Those who were
 found satisfactory, by reason of their records and their performance under
 indoctrination, were returned to their posts.  Others were retained for
 further training.
 2e  New Officials were also recruited and trained.  Great care was taken in the
 selection of personnel for official posts, and preference was given to
 those who had pro-Communist leanings or had worked for Communism in the
 past.
 3.  At the same time, the Polioe Department was given great powers, and repre-
 sentatives of its Intelligence and.Security Section were assigned to every
 military and civil formation and department.  When army officers were
 removed from civil posts, about 1 August 1950, a system was evolved to
 coordinate the working of the police with all other departments, including
 the postal and telegraph offices.
 4.  Important developments during the first three years of Chinese Communist
 rule in Sinkiang included the abolition of the local 1slaanio courts which
 operated on the basis of the law of the Koran (1950),'the reokgttniiatioli
 of civil courts and the appointment of womeA as judges and magistrates,
 and the later establishment of people's courts in every mohalla.  There is
 no Codified law, and;,judges. i res.guided by Communist ideology.  In all

 important oases, sentences were approved and confirmed, or pronounced by the
 people themselves.
 Indoctrination of the Sinkiangese
 5. The people of Sinkiang did nothing to assist the Communist takeover of the
 Province.  They were without enthusiasm for the Nationalist regime, but were
 apprehensive of a change.  The Chinese Communists worked intensively, through
 propaganda, teaching, proper behavior, and example, to dispel the popular
 mistrust.  Groups of volunteers, mostly university students, usually numbering
 about one. hundred, went to Sinkiang to work, in hospitals, banks, and various
 government departments.   These groups included women, and mast of them stayed
 about six months, before returning to Central China.
 6.  The Chinese Communist army participated in the propaganda designed to win over
 the people.  Shortly after their arrival the troops started collecting dux' ._.
 in the streets, explaining that they did this at once to provide fertilizer
 for the fields and to improve the sanitary condition in the settled area.  In
 addition, the army took over fallow land and cultivated it, growing their own
 food.  They built their own barracks as needed.  The spectacle of an army
 engaged in productive work rather than in drills and tactical exercises did
 much to dispel the fear of the people of Sinkiang.
 7.   Intensive propaganda against the Nationalist regime was carried on, together
 with indoctrination in Communist ideology and explanation of the plans and
 goals of the new administration.  Schools were opened in important centers
 where people were indoctrinated before being assigned to positions in the
 government.  Within each department, an hour of ideological training before
 beginning the work of each day was compulsory;  later, another hour in the
 evening was also required.  In the schools, where education was free. and.-,.
 compulsory for persons under 14 years of age, much attention was given to
 training in Communist doctrines, and the children were expected to repeat
 their ideological lessons at home for the benefit of their parents.  The
 mullahs were required to praise the new government to their congregations.
 8.    In 1951 and 1952 every man and woman was required to sign a certificate of
 loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party, and of personal loyalty to President
 MAO Tse-tung.
 9.    In late 1952 there was no evidence that the people of Sinkiang were not
 happy under the new regime, or that the effects of their indoctrination were
 merely superficial.  The younger people, under 30 years of age, appeared
 thoroughly reconciled to the new government.  About ten percent of the people
 holding positions in the government were over 30'years of age, retaining a
 sympathy for the old order and its religious flavor., but they would do nothing
 to aid a counter movement unless they were sure they could do so in complete
 safety.
 Purges
 10.    In 1950 and 1951 the following oategories.gf peoplef known, oolleotivdly. ,as
 uimkdrs (cruel ' and rea9tionary persons), were arrested and tried by people's
 courts, which sentenced them to be shot, or to life imprisonments
 as  Those who, in the opinion of the army and security police, were guilty of
 acts prejudicial to the success of the revolution in Sinkiang.
 b.  Those who had personally participated in reactionary movements.
 o.  Those who had committed or instigated murders.

 d.  Those who offered physical opposition to the revolution in Ili, now
 linked with the movement which liberated the people of China from the
 Nationalist regime.
 e.  Those who had preached Pan-Islamism, or Fan-Turkism.  Both of these
 movements had touched the people but little, being confined to the
 leaders.  With the latter eliminated or in exile, these movements are
 quite dead.
 f.  Those believed to have connections with forei ners
 were charged as spies and saboteurs.
 11.    In 1951 some 175 Sinkiangese and Chinese were sentenced to death, including
 Pisar Akun of Yarkand, and Mohd Niaz of Kucha (N 41-43, E 82-54).  Forty
 former Uighur leaders were also tried in absentia, and death sentences were
 passed against them.  These included Amin Hazrat, former deputy governorl;
 Aisabek, former secretary general; Yasin Akhund, former shin-jang2;
 Uabidullah Akund, former joo-Tang, Kashgar3; and Alaf Shah, former shin-
 jang, P'uli (N 37-47, E 75-14}.  In 1952 there were 63 executed, including
 Nabi, the police joo-jang of P'uli; Ahmad Baig of Tash Malik (N 39-07,
 E 75-37);  and Maqsum Akhund.  After 8 March 1952 no one was shot.4  More
 than a thousand were serving life terms in various prisons in Sinkiang,
 with thousands more serving shorter sentences.  In the prisons an
 ideological education is given.  Out of the total number of people purged,
 70 percent were Chinese, 25 percent Uighurs, and 5 percent Tadjiks, Kirghiz,
 Kazakhs and Kalmuks.
 12.   After October 1951 the three-anti's and five-anti's movements, known in
 Turkish as Bish Akrari Majlis and Uch Akrari Mlajlis, were launched in
 Sinkiang, resulting in more arrests and imprisonments.
 Mili Mukhtariat (Provincial Autonomy)
 13.   Prior to 1949 there were two groups in Sinkiang, the first of which wanted
 .complete independence for the province, while the second desired separation
 from China and federation with the USSR as a republic.  This latter group,
 which is under Soviet control, was in power in Sinkiang in 1952, but had
 abandoned the idea of federation with the Soviet Union, since such a move
 would jeopardize Sino-Soviet relations.  Instead, the group favored making
 Sinkiang a republic within the Chinese framework.  As a start, the province
 had been granted a measure of autonomy on the condition that it receive
 guidance and instructions from the Chinese Communist army.
 14.  Minorities within the province, such as Tadjiks, Kirghiz, Kalmuks and
 Kazakhs, are permitted to establish self-governing bodies within their
 own areas.  In October 1952 the city of Kashgar was made a self-governing
 body, with the result that the administration of the area is in the hands
 of Tadjiks and Kirghiz, while Uighurs, the majority group, are not repre-
 sented in the security police or in any government department.  This
 situation tends to engender mistrust and division between the various
 races, rather than the understanding and fraternity it is supposed to
 create.
 Religion
 15. Although 80 percent of the population of Sinkiang is Moslem and Communist
 China's.asic program permits religious freedom, the practice of religion
 has declined.  No religious teaching is given, and religion is regarded
 as something outworn, ignored by the student class and despised by officials.

 Ideological teaching has replaced religious sermons in the mosques.
 Status of Women
 16. Women, who had had no status in society, wore given equal rights with men by
 the Chinese Communist regime.  They were also recruited for services of all
 sorts, even serving as polite officials.  Ill-treatment of women was declared
 an offense against society.  Concubinage was declared illegal, the custom of
 temporary marriages was given up, and men were permitted to have only one
 wife.  For both sexes divorce was possible, but only after establishment of
 sufficient cause-before a court of law.  The permission of a mohalla or village
 court is necessary before a couple can be married.
 Education
 17. A campaign to eliminate illiteracy was started in 1950, and wasLto be completed
 within five years.  Any literate person was obliged to teach his illiterate
 relatives and friends.  Since failure to do this was likely to be reported,
 compliance with the rule was general.
 18. The number of schools in Sinkiang was increased.  In 1951 some thousand
 teachers were trained at Darul Madraseen in Kashgar and sent to teach in
 soholls in hilly areas previously neglected.  In settlements of as few as
 ten families, schools were established.    Special schools for orphans and
 children from very poor families, providing acoomodations, food and
 .clothing for their pupils, were established.  Such schools are called
 Darul Yatama.5
 Morality
 19. Under the Chinese Commmunist regime in Sinkiang, drinking and card playing
 arec..diaoouraged.  Mie smoking of oharas is prohibited, and addicts are
 given medical treatment and assigned to forced labor as a remedial measure.
 Illicit sexual relations are regarded as an outrage of public morality and
 punished.  Eabit.sr?gf:ai.dd sts?y, courtesy and politeness are being instilled
 in the people.     Breach of promise and falsehood are punished.
 20. Official corruption, formerly prevalent, has in large measure been wiped
 out, partly by the example of the officials from Central China who have
 been working in Sinkiang, and partly by the devices of criticism and self-
 criticism and the three-anti's campaign.
 Soviet Influence
 21. In 1952, in ICashgar every twentieth man on the street was a Soviet citizen,
 and there were Soviet police in the city to look after their oo-nationals,
 most of whom were Turks, Uzbeks and Tadjiks from Russian Turkestan., A num-
 ber of Soviet Uzbeks who have resided in Sinkiang for some time were employed
 in the government.  Others were advisers, experts, teachers, artists, engio.
 nears, trading agents, and drivers.  Many of the newcomers are parrying on
 trade and working in the trade agencies.
 22. Soviet influence is more marked in northern Sinkiang than in the southern
 part of the province.
 Treatment of Foreigners
 28. The consulates general of Pakistan and India were closed on 17 November 1949.
 Shortly after the Chinese Communist army arrived, in late December 1949 and

 January 1950, restrictions were placed on the movements of people..  These
 were removed in 1951, except-for foreigners, who were still required to
 get a permit from the security police before moving from place to place.
 In 1950 there was an organized boycott of foreign traders.  In 1952 the
 Chinese wives of Indian and Pakistani nationals were urged to seek divorces.
 At the same time, Chinese nationality has been offered to foreign residents.
 24.~ The non-Soviet foreigners in Sinkiang include about 500 Pakistanis,, scattered
 through southern Sinkiang, Afghans, some Indians, and a couple of Germans in
 Urumchi.  Of the Pakistanis, only five percent were of the first and second
 generation in Sinkiang, the others being in the third, fourth or fifth gene-
 ration.  Some of those in Khotan (N 37-07, E 79-55), Keriya (N 36-52,
 E 81-42) and Guma (N 37-38, E 78-19) were reported to be giving favorable
 consideration to taking Chinese nationality in late 1952, as were a large
 number of Pakistanis in Yarkand.
 eestriotion of Kashgar
 27.    From 4 to 13 August 1952 the people of Kashgar were ordered to close the
 main gate, and to apply to the police for permission to go out for shopping
 or on business.
