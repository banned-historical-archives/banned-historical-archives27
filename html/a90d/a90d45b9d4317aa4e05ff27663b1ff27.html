Overview 
Chinese Defense 
Spending, 1965-79 
Estimated Chinese defense spending over the past 15 years shows two 
distinctly different trends. Spending rose rapidly from 1965 to 1971?at an 
average rate of about 10 percent a year?then fell sharply in 1972; and since 
then it has grown at an average rate of only 1 to 2 percent annually. The 
abrupt shift was associated with a policy change that gave greater priority to 
general economic development. 
The recent pattern of limited growth in defense spending may reflect 
technological constraints as well as government policy. Although China 
produces a wide range of weapons, they are mainly copies or adaptations of 
Soviet designs first developed in the 1950s. A shutdown of high-level 
education during 1966-76, which was associated with the Cultural 
Revolution, crippled the country's technological effort. As a result, China's 
military research and development program has so far brought only a few 
indigenous designs to full operational status. 
In the 1980s we expect defense spending to continue the slow-growth trend 
of the 1970s. China will continue to modernize its military forces, but 
economic and technological weaknesses will restrict the pace. The present 
leaders recognize that they cannot begin an extensive upgrading of defense 
capabilities until the economy is stronger. 
Even if China's military modernization received broad foreign support 
during the 1980s, that support would have little impact until late in the 
decade. The national military-industrial base and the military forces would 
need time to assimilate new foreign technology. 
General economic development will enhance China's ability to achieve its 
long-term defense goals, but the process will be slow. Defense modernization 
will be spread over decades rather than years because of the competing 
demands on the nation's limited resources. 
These conclusions are based on cost estimates derived by a building-block 
method similar to the one used by the Central Intelligence Agency for 
costing Soviet defense activities. This approach is necessary because the 
Chinese publish almost no information on their defense spending.

Chinese Defense 
Spending, 1965-79 
Introduction 
The building-block approach used in this paper con-
sists of identifying the various Chinese defense activi-
ties in as much detail as possible, estimating the cost of 
each, and summing these individual cost estimates for 
each year.' The activities covered are those which in 
the United States would be defined as national security 
programs. 
Our estimates differ markedly from those reported by 
the Chinese. In June 1979 they published in their state 
budget an entry for defense of 16.8 billion yuan for 
1978 and 20.2 billion yuan planned for 1979. Our 
analytical constructs suggest, however, that the com-
ponents of the Chinese defense effort, as defined in US 
terms, add up to about twice the published amount?
that is, to about 40 billion yuan for 1979. 
The Chinese did not explain what activities were 
covered by the reported figures?the first released 
since 1959?but they clearly represent only a part of 
the total. This would be analogous to the single-figure 
defense entry in the Soviet state budget, which also 
reflects only a portion of estimated total defense 
spending. 
The "direct-costing" methodology makes it possible to 
analyze expenditure patterns in a variety of different 
ways. For example, analysis of expenditures by re-
source category provides a measure of Chinese force 
expansion and modernization, whereas analysis by the 
individual force components can give an insight into 
Chinese defense priorities. 
These individual cost estimates have a margin of error, 
however, which could be substantial for some categor-
ies. We have greater confidence in our estimates of 
spending trends than in those for absolute levels, and 
for any given year we have more confidence in the 
higher levels of aggregation than in the lower ones. 
' For a brief description of this analytical approach, see appendix. 
1 
We have the greatest confidence in our weapons 
procurement estimates, which account for about 40 
percent of total Chinese expenditures for the period. 
We have less information about facility construction, 
personnel, and operations and maintenance and there-
fore have less confidence in our estimates for these 
activities?which together account for close to 45 
percent of our total estimate. Military research, 
development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) ac-
count for the remaining 15 percent. Because of our 
many uncertainties about Chinese military RDT&E 
programs and their costs, we have the least confidence 
in this part of our estimate. 
Background 
China is a large, slowly developing country, with at 
least three-quarters of its labor force engaged in 
agriculture and with a low level of output per capita in 
industry. Nevertheless, it maintains the world's largest 
Army 2 and manages to produce a wide range of 
weapon systems. The production technology used, 
however, and the military equipment produced are less 
advanced than those in industrially developed coun-
tries. The weapons are primarily copies or modifica-
tions of Soviet designs of the 1950s. 
The People's Liberation Army (PLA) emphasizes 
large conventionally equipped ground forces. The 
troops have a wide range of time-tested weapons such 
as tanks and tube artillery, but they have few modern 
weapons such as antitank guided missiles or short-
range tactical rockets. The air forces consist largely of 
air defense fighters capable of making intercepts only 
in good weather during daylight hours, and the naval 
forces are equipped primarily for coastal defense. 
China has 4.3 million men assigned to combat and combat support 
units and probably another 3 or 4 million uniformed personnel in 
administrative and service support units. As large as these forces are, 
they are less than 1 percent of the population, now estimated at one 
billion.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2014/04/18: CIA-RDP11S00229R000100230001-3 
China also has a small number of nuclear weapons and 
delivery systems?bomber aircraft, medium-range 
ballistic missiles (MRBMs), and intermediate-range 
ballistic missiles (IRBMs)?that can cover most 
targets in the Far East. It has only a few 
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs); these can 
reach the western USSR, but none currently oper-
ational can reach the continental United States. The 
development and manufacture of strategic nuclear 
weapon systems and reconnaissance satellites attest to 
China's desire to pursue military programs similar to 
those of a modern military-industrial power. 
Defense currently absorbs 5 to 10 percent of China's 
estimated GNP. It is in competition for economic 
resources, however, with the rest of the "four modern-
izations" areas, especially for the high-technology 
machinery and skilled managerial and technical man-
power which are already in short supply.' This 
competition will become more intense as China contin-
ues to implement its "four modernizations" campaign. 
Most of China's defense industrial base was developed 
during the late 1950s. It was developed largely with 
Soviet assistance and was seriously damaged by the 
withdrawal of that assistance in 1960. After a period of 
recovery (1961-65), China began a broadly based 
program to expand and disperse its defense industries. 
Several hundred factories have been built since 1965. 
about tripling Chinese defense plant capacity. Much of 
this capacity, however, uses antiquated production 
processes, and for unknown reasons much of it appears 
to be idle. Imports of special high-quality raw materi-
als, machinery, and precision instruments from Japan 
and the West continue to play an important role in 
China's production of its more advanced military 
equipment. 
Expenditure Trends 
The pattern of Chinese defense spending shows consid-
erable variation (see figure 1). Arms production 
virtually stopped in the early 1960s, as the effects of 
the Great Leap Forward (1958) compounded the 
decline following the cutoff of Soviet economic and 
military assistance. By the middle of the decade, 
however, the output of nearly all types of weapons had 
'The "four modernizations" (agriculture, industry, defense, and 
science and technology) aim at achieving developed-nation economic 
status for China by the year 2000. 
recovered. This recovery may have been stimulated by 
US involvement in neighboring Vietnam. 
In 1966 Mao Zedong launched the Great Proletarian 
Cultural Revolution. Although the central authorities 
tried to protect defense industries from the general 
disruption, the personnel purges at the local level and 
the political activities in factories and transportation 
centers took their toll. During 1967, the first full year 
of the Cultural Revolution, the value of output of new 
military equipment fell by about 20 percent. 
The worst effects of the Cultural Revolution on the 
weapons industries had passed by late 1968. 
Heightened tensions with the Soviet Union then began 
to spur defense expenditures, which rose rapidly to a 
peak in 1971. Growth in annual defense expenditures 
for the period 1965-71 averaged 10 percent. 
In 1972 defense procurement was again cut severely. A 
decline of about 70 percent in aircraft procurement 
was responsible for most of the drop; production of 
naval ships and land arms declined also, but its impact 
on total spending was less. Defense spending as a whole 
dropped 20 percent. Three factors apparently were 
responsible: a new emphasis on agriculture; reduced 
military influence in policymaking as the shattered 
Party and government apparatus recovered from the 
Cultural Revolution and the fall of Lin Biao;4 and a 
realization by the military that continued large-scale 
output of older weapons was at the expense of its long-
term efforts at defense modernization. 
Overall defense spending increased 1 or 2 percent per 
year between 1972 and 1978, but expenditures in 1978 
were still below the 1971 peak. 
In February and March 1979 (after an extended 
period of mobilization and force buildup beginning in 
late 1978) the Chinese engaged Vietnam in a month of 
intense fighting. We can estimate only generally the 
direct costs of that war, but we judge that their 
addition to ongoing defense expenditures caused a 
sharp increase in the total for 1979, a total which 
probably exceeds the calculated 1971 peak. 
4 Before his fall in late 1971, Lin Biao was Defense Minister and 
Mao's constitutionally designated successor. The growth in defense 
spending between 1965 and 1971 coincided with his rise in power.

Spending by Resource Category 
Chinese defense expenditures may be separated into 
three resource categories?investment, operating, and 
RDT&E. Investment expenditures reflect the flow of 
new or replacement equipment and facilities to the 
forces; operating expenditures are the costs associated 
with their day-to-day functioning; and RDT&E ex-
penditures support activities concerned with future 
force modernization. 
About 50 percent of the estimated spending over the 
1965-79 period went for investment in equipment 
(roughly 40 percent) and facilities (roughly 
10 percent). Operating costs absorbed about 
35 percent of the total and RDT&E an average of 
about 15 percent (see figure 2). 
3 
Investment Expenditures. Defense investment consists 
of both the procurement of weapons and equipment 
and the construction of military facilities. About 
80 percent of investment spending has been for weap-
ons procurement, with about one-half of this allocated 
for aircraft, missiles, and ships. 
The Chinese continue to procure large quantities of 
equipment that was first produced in China during the 
mid-1960s or earlier?items that were designed in the 
USSR in the 1950s. The weapons which the Chinese 
began to produce in the 1970s are still being procured 
in only small numbers. This pattern may reflect limited 
capabilities to mass-produce the more technologically 
advanced hardware.

Procurement is the category that largely determines 
the total Chinese expenditure trend. In addition to its 
sheer volume-40 percent of total outlays?spending 
for procurement of new equipment is the most volatile 
element of defense spending and the one most suscep-
tible to policy change. For example, the sharp drop in 
total spending in 1972 resulted mainly from the slash 
in the production of military equipment. 
Operating Expenditures. We estimate that operating 
expenditures between 1965 and 1979 grew at an 
average annual rate of slightly less than 5 percent. 
Operating expenditures include personnel costs and 
the cost of the operation and maintenance (O&M) of 
equipment and military facilities. Within this cate-
gory, O&M costs have grown somewhat faster than 
personnel-related costs?primarily reflecting a slow 
increase in the weapons inventory. 
RDT&E Expenditures. The Chinese have limited their 
RDT&E efforts to a few major projects. These have 
generally included one or two models in each major 
type of weapon system (such as aircraft, missiles, and 
ships). The systems being developed show a substantial 
technological improvement over those currently being 
produced, but they still only represent weapons tech-
nology of the early 1960s.

that were begun in the late 1960s are still under 
development. This difficulty in translating research 
into production may reflect limitations caused by the 
scarcity of trained scientific personnel and the under-
developed condition of China's technological base. 
Spending for the Forces 
Another way of analyzing our estimated cost data is by 
use. For the purposes of this paper, we have divided 
Chinese defense spending into six functional compo-
nents. Five are related to different types of combat 
forces: ground, naval, air defense, air attack, and 
ballistic missile. The sixth functional component in-
cludes activities?such as command and support and 
RDT&E?that provide common services to all the 
others. 
Ground Forces. With a population of 1 billion, China 
maintains an army that is huge in comparison with the 
armies of other countries. The costs of this force are 
small relative to its size because the Chinese troops are 
paid low wages and are lightly equipped. Spending for 
the ground forces has gradually increased, however, 
and since 1965 has averaged over 20 percent of total 
defense spending. 
Naval Forces. Estimated spending for China's naval 
programs (which include a small land-based force of 
naval aircraft used for fleet defense and maritime 
reconnaissance) more than doubled between 1965 and 
1972, primarily reflecting growth in the procurement 
of ships and boats. Since that time, the level of 
spending has been relatively constant, as a recent 
slowdown in the construction of submarines and small 
combatants has been offset by increased production of 
destroyers and frigates. Naval expenditures accounted 
for roughly 20 percent of military spending during the 
1965-79 period. 
Air Defense Forces. The overall level and trend of 
spending for air defense forces has been determined 
primarily by the rate at which Beijing has produced 
new aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. Spending for 
this component increased rapidly between 1965 and 
1971, decreased sharply in 1972, and then increased 
gradually through 1978. Air defense expenditures 
represent nearly 20 percent of China's total defense 
CDspending for the 1965-79 period. 
5 
Air Attack Forces. The spending pattern for air attack 
forces reflects the uneven nature of Chinese aircraft 
production. Expenditures rose steeply during 1965-71 
but began a decline in 1972. The trend continued 
slightly downward through 1974 and then followed a 
fluctuating pattern through 1979. Somewhat less than 
5 percent of cumulative defense spending for 1965-79 
has gone to these forces. 
Ballistic Missile Forces. The investment and operat-
ing costs for China's ballistic missile force (about 
100 MRBM and IRBM launchers and a few ICBM 
launchers) have amounted to less than 5 percent of 
cumulative defense spending since 1965. We do not 
include in this figure the considerable expenditures 
associated with ballistic missile RDT&E, which ac-
count for about two-thirds of our total estimate for 
Chinese RDT&E. 
National Command and Support Activities. About 
30 percent of Beijing's total defense expenditure was 
accounted for by the remaining activities, which 
include RDT&E and command and support compo-
nents. Command and support components include a 
variety of general rear-service functions such as 
logistics, security, intelligence, medical services, and 
administration. 
Relation of Defense Spending to National Income 
We estimate that military spending in China is taking 
a much smaller share of China's gross national product 
during 1970-80 than it did in 1965-71. GNP is now 60 
percent above the 1971 level and industrial production 
is 100 percent above, but military spending is only now 
reaching the 1971 level. Figure 3 shows how general 
industrial production has outstripped defense procure-
ment. A comparison of their respective trends shows 
that defense procurement growth conformed closely to 
the growth of industrial output through 1971. Since 
1972, however, industrial output has continued its 
upward trend while defense procurement has increased 
only slightly. 
Outlook 
China will continue to modernize its military forces, 
but at the conservative pace that has characterized 
expenditure trends since 1972. The current leaders, 
now more than ever, recognize that they must correct

the fundamental weaknesses in the economy before 
they can undertake an extensive upgrading of defense 
capabilities. 
The forces are unlikely to receive large numbers of new 
weapon systems. Although China's military RDT&E 
effort began in the 1960s, few new weapon systems 
were ready for large-scale deployment in the 1970s. 
This movement from research to production is unlikely 
to speed up until the Chinese overcome the limitations 
imposed by the weakness of their technological base. 
China has only a limited number of scientists, most of 
whom were trained abroad in the 1940s and 1950s. 
They are aging now, but because of the hiatus in higher 
education during 1966-76, the country has not trained 
enough scientists to replace them. The universities are 
only now beginning to reestablish their science curricu-
lums, and in the meantime, large numbers of scientific 
personnel are being sent to the United States, Western 
Europe, and Japan to update their scientific 
knowledge. 
For several years the Chinese have been surveying the 
technology and equipment of Western arms producers. 
They have expressed an interest in such defensive 
weapons as antitank and antiaircraft missiles, but they 
also appear to be interested in aircraft and electronic 
equipment. They have imported from the West some 
equipment and technology that could be modified for 
weapons purposes, but they have imported few, if any,

complete weapon systems. The Chinese apparently 
would rather purchase the complete technology of a 
particular weapon system, including the manufactur-
ing process, than large quantities of hardware. 
Even if China were to acquire foreign defense-related 
equipment or technology, the impact on force 
capabilities would not become apparent until the late 
1980s. Time is needed to assimilate new technology 
into the existing production processes, to develop 
associated maintenance and logistic structures, and to 
train military personnel in the use of the equipment. 
The Chinese might participate in joint ventures or 
coproduction programs with other nations, but assimi-
lation would still take time. 
Thus, the Chinese defense effort probably will be 
largely a continuation of the trend before the invasion 
of Vietnam. The major constraints on more rapid 
defense modernization are economic and technologi-
cal. Under the current, more pragmatic leadership, 
China is likely to make progress in these areas, and in 
the long run this progress will benefit the military. But 
unless Beijing receives large-scale foreign assistance?
which is unlikely?its limited resources and the 
competing demands throughout the economy will 
restrict it to gradual advances in military technology 
and defense modernization.

Appendix 
Costing Methodology 
Our estimates of Chinese defense spending are based 
on a building-block methodology similar to that which 
has been developed over many years to assess the 
defense costs of the Soviet Union. We compile a 
detailed list of the activities and physical components 
of the defense program for each year. This list includes 
data on order of battle, manpower, production of 
equipment, construction of facilities, and the operating 
practices of the military forces. 
These force components and activities are then con-
verted into monetary estimates. For some components 
we have yuan prices, and these components are costed 
directly in yuan. For each of the remaining compo-
nents, we estimate what it would cost if produced in the 
United States and then convert these dollar costs to 
yuan using suitable yuan-dollar ratios. 
We use several conversion ratios, which are con-
structed to reflect the relative differences in the US 
and Chinese price structures. They are based on an 
extensive sample of prices for comparable US and 
Chinese industrial products. For example, the price of 
a particular Chinese diesel engine or tractor is 
compared to the price of its closest US counterpart, 
and the dollar price is adjusted for obvious differences 
in quality and design. Using the yuan-dollar ratios 
derived from our samples, we then construct another 
set of ratios for converting the dollar cost of military 
activities into yuan. The ratios range from 8.5 to 0.6 
yuan per dollar; the ratio at the high end of the range is 
applied to some electronic equipment, and that at the 
low end to transportation services.
