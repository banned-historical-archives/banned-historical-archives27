 INDOCHINA
 Sihanouk resurfaced for the first  ime since mid-February when
 he arrived in Hanoi on the 6th after a visit to "the liberated
 zone of Cambodia."  His reported consultations with the
 in-country FUNK leaders underscored a differentiation of roles
 in which Sihanouk represents the FUNK on the international plane
 while acknowledging the insurgents' own leadership in conducting
 operations in Cambodia.  His visit also reaffirmed the FUNK's
 rejection of an accommodation or cease-fire with the Phnom Penh
 regime.  Hanoi and Peking have hailed his trip as a demonstration
 of the FUNK's unity.
 Speeches by Pham Van Dong, hosting Sihanouk, and Truong Chinh,
 hosting a visiting Czechoslovak delegation, reiterated Hanoi's
 line that the completion of U.S. troop withdrawal on 29 March was
 a great victory for the Vietnamese people.  Both DRV leaders
 charged the United States and Saigon with "gross and systematic"
 violation of the peace accord, and Truong Chinh scored the U.S.
 Administration for "hurling slanders and threats" at the
 Vietnamese people.
 Hanoi press comment on GVN President Nguyen Van Thieu's 2-7 April
 visit to the United States contained more direct reaction to the
 recent Administration statements warning of U.S. measures to
 counter communist violations of the peace accord.  Citing such
 statements by the President and by Defense Secretary Richardson,
 a NHAN DAN editorial pegged to the Nixon-Thieu communique argued
 that it is not the U.S. role to enforce the peace agreement.
 The Hanoi press comment viewed the joint communique as evidence
 of U.S. intent to pursue the Nixon Doctrine and thus impose
 "neocolonialist domination," and a Commentator article injected
 a polemical note when it revived the charge that the doctrine
 aims at dividing socialist countries.
 SIHANOUK VISITS HANOI AFTER REPORTED TRIP TO CAMBODIA
 Prince Sihanouk arrived in Hanoi on 6 April after what he said was
 a visit to "the liberated zone of Cambodia" that has produced a
 show of unity between Sihanouk's exile wing of the FUNK and the
 in-country insurgent leaders identified with the Khmer Rouge.
 Sihanouk's pilgrimage appears to have achieved an understanding
 based on a differentiation of roles within the FUNK, with the
 prince representing the movement on the international plane while
 acknowledging the insurgents' own leadership of operations inside

 Cambodia.  His consultations with the insurgent leaders also
 reconfirmed their rejection of an accommodation or cease-fire
 with the Phnom Penh regime.     Earlier, Sihanouk had drawn back
 from the more forthcoming approach to a Cambodian settlement
 that he had taken in the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam
 agreement.
 Speaking at an official reception in his honor in Hanoi on the
 9th, Sihanouk frankly acknowledged that for three years the
 FUNK has been afflicted with "a serious handicap" arising from
 his exile status, which has made the FUNK politically vulnerable
 to charges that it did not have a genuine domestic base, that
 the in-country insurgents did not recognize his authority,
 and that these insurgents were dominated by their Vietnamese
 allies.  Declaring that the time has come for his movement to
 demonstrate "its existence, its unity, its autonomy, and its
 legitimacy," Sihanouk insisted that the three Khmer Rouge
 "ministers in the interior"--Khieu Samphan, Hu Nim, and Hou
 Youn*--are alive and well and that they recognize him as chief
 of state.  He explained that the RGNU was not a government in
 exile because it is embodied in the three insurgent leaders and
 has established "the people's power" in 90 percent of Cambodia.
 In his insistent stress on the unity of the FUNK, especially
 between the royalist and the communist elements, Sihanouk
 indicated that there was an arrangement according to which he
 represented the continuity and legitimacy of the resistance
 movement on the international level while the insurgent leaders
 provided "a veritable national leadership in the liberated zones"
 of the country.  He explained, in an exercise of semantic
 gymnastics, that the RGNU will always call itself a royal govern-
 ment--"even if it is composed of a majority" of Khmer Rouge--but
 that as a regime it will always be "a pure people's democracy."
 He added that the monarchy has become purely symbolic, a
 conce:;sion that makes clear the effective control to be enjoyed
 by the communist elements should they oust the Lon Nol regime.
 On 8 April the FUNK radio began carrying a series of special
 programs of recorded reportage on Sihanouk's visit, including
 *  Sihanouk said he had gathered photographs, film, and record-
 ings of speeches by the three ministers as well as by Son Sen,
 the insurgent army's chief of staff.  Current references to the
 latter further reflect the deference being shown in recent
 months to the fighters on the front line.

 speeches by the prince and purportedly by the insurgent leaders.*
 As in his remarks in Hanoi, Sihancouk's speeches showed
 sensitivity to what he called "the degrading brand" of a govern-
 ment in exile, and his tributes to the leaders of the insurgent
 forces reflected the trend in recent months toward enhancing
 their authority.  He also took frank note of views that the FUNK
 is divided into four factions--the Khmer Rouge, the Vietnamese-
 dominated Khmer Rumdoh, pro-Sihanouk elements, and outright
 bandits--and that the three shadowy ministers in the interior
 had been murdered long before at Sihanouk's orders.  He expressed
 confidence that his visit and the evidence he collected will
 demonstrate to doubting Cambodians and to the world that the
 FUNK is united and that the insurgent leaders are alive and
 heading the struggle at home.  VNA has transmitted radiophotos
 with captions saying that they show Sihanouk with other FUNK
 leaders in the "liberated zone," including one purportedly in
 front of the Angkor Wat temple.
 REJECTION OF COMPROMISE     In his recorded speeches and in his
 9 April address in Hanoi, Sihanouk
 underscored the FUNK's adamant opposition to a compromise
 settlement.  Addressing would-be "Indochina peacemakers," he
 said in Hanoi that the insurgent leaders had asked him to tell
 the world that they would not accept any compromise or "any
 cease-fire whatsoever" with the Phnom Penh regime.  In a
 recorded speech broadcast by the FUNK radio on the 10th,
 Sihanouk declared that "we resolutely refuse to negotiate or
 compromise" and will continue the war until complete liberation
 of the country.
 On the question of aid from the Chinese and the North Vietnamese,
 Sihanouk said in Hanoi that they had provided a stock of supplies
 prior to 27 .January sufficient to carry on the fight until 1975
 and that large quantities of American arms are captured from
 Lon Nol's army.  He appealed to foreign governments seeking to
 bring peace to Cambodia to urge President Nixon to stop the T.S.
 air attacks.  Sihanouk indicated that the FUNK forces will not
 attempt to take Phnom Penh by force but will use "political and
 diplomatic means" to isolate the Lon Nol regime and cause its
 internal collapse.
 *  The first installment carried a recorded speech attributed to
 Hu Nim and the second a speech by Khieu Samphan.

 11 APRIL 1973
 SUPPORT FROM DRV     Hanoi took the occasion of Sihanouk's visit
 to reaffirm its support for his leadership
 while hailing his reported trip into Cambodia as demonstrating
 the unity of the resistance forces.  As in his previous visit in
 late January and early February, Sihanouk was hosted by Premier
 Pham Van Dong and Defense Minister Giap.  Unlike that visit,
 this time he met with party chief Le Duan, who along with Truong
 Chinh paid separate calls on Sihanouk and RGNU Premier Penn Nouth
 on 8 April.  (Penn Nouth had flown to the DRV from Peking on
 the 5th to join Sihanouk and his Khmer Rouge shadow, "special
 envoy of the interior" Ieng Sary.)  North Vietnamese comment,
 including editorials in the party and army dailies, reconfirmed
 Hanoi's backing of Sihanouk as the "representative of the
 legality, genuineness, and continuity of the Cambodian state."
 Speaking at the reception on the 9ch, Dong hailed Sihanouk's
 trip as "a new and still more moving and vivid manifestation
 of the militant solidarity" of the Cambodians and Vietnamese,
 who "are ready to give mutual wholehearted support and assistance."
 He said Sihanouk's visit to the liberated zone coincided with
 battlefield successes, "especially on the strategic communicatic .
 lines," which have tightened the siege on Phnom Penh and driven
 "the reactionary clique of Lon Noll' to the point of collapse.
 Dong reaffirmed Hanoi's support for Sihanouk's March 1970
 five-point declaration but did not directly address the question of
 a Cambodian settlement.
 RETURN TO CHINA     Sihanouk's party arrived from Hanoi in Peking
 on the 11th and was greeted by more than
 5,000 people headed by Chou En-lai and his wife, Yeh Chien-ying,
 Li Hsien-nien, and PRG Foreign Minister Binh, stopping over in
 Peking en route to North Korea from Mongolia.  A PEOPLE'S DAILY
 editorial trumpeted that Sihanouk's "inspection tour of the
 liberated zone of Cambodia" is having "a great impact" both inside
 and outside Cambodia by demonstrating anew his status as legitimate
 head of state and "the unbreakable unity" of the FUNK forces.
 Echoing Sihanouk's remarks, the editorial claimed that the trip
 has "shattered to smithereens" the objection that the RGNU is a
 gouk:rnment in exile.  The editorial heaped all the glory on Peking's
 client, Sihanouk, neglecting to mention by name the insurgent
 leaders to whom Sihanouk had paid repeated tributes.
 Observing that the Lon Nol regime is being isolated and that the
 flames of war are spreading, PEOPLE'S DAILY asserted that the days
 of "this handful of national scum" are numbered.  The editorial
 said Sihanouk's five-point declaration advanced "reasonable

 proposals" that are widely supported in the world, but it did
 not claim that these proposals provide the only basis for a
 settlement.  It also sidestepped the question of a cease-fire
 settlement while taking the occasion to condemn the U.S. air
 strikes in Cambodia as a violation of the Paris agreement on
 Vietnam as well as a futile attempt to "drag on the solution"
 of the Cambodian question.  The editorial concluded with a routine
 pledge that the Chinese will always "firmly support the Just
 struggle" of the Cambodians and other Indochinese people.
 Moscow, as the outside party in Sihanouk's dealings with the
 Asian communists, has not mentioned the prince's travels.
 THIEU'S UPS. VISIT PROMPTS DRV ANALYSES OF NIXON POLICIES
 In the wake of President Thieu's U.S. visit, a spate of authorita-
 tive comment in Hanoi's party paper NHAN DAN shows some variations,
 if not contradictions, in analyzing U.S. policies.  An editorial
 in the paper on 6 April is straightforward in citing the Nixon-
 Thieu communique as evidence of U.S. intent to continue its
 involvement in Vietnam and Indochina.  But a NHAN DAN Commentator
 article on the 7th and an editorial in the paper on the 9th
 take different tacks toward the United States, with the Commentator
 article carrying polemical overtones regarding U.S. intentions and
 great power detente and the editorial assuming a more sanguine
 stance regarding the President's professions of a desire to
 move from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation.
 DRV PRESS ON     Analyzing the 3 April Nixon-Thieu communique in
 U.S. THREATS     some detail, the NHAN DAN editorial of the 6th
 charged that the document provided further
 evidence of continuing U.S. involvement in Vietnam and Indochina
 and of Thieu's willingness to continue "serving as a U.S. lackey."
 The editorial focused particular attention on the communique's
 "slanderous" reference to North Vietnamese infiltration and its
 assertion that appropriate vigorous reactions would be necessary
 to meet any actions which threaten the basis of the peace agreement.
 Interpreting this passage as a warning that the United States
 would intervene, the editorial charged that Defense Secretary
 Richardson had indicated that U.S. action might include a resumption
 of the U.S. bombing of the DRV and even the reintroduction of
 American forces into South Vietnam.  Not surprisingly, Vietnamese
 communist media have ignorcd statement:; by Thieu--including those

 11 APRIL 1973
 In contrast to its previous stress on alleged U.S. responsibility
 for insuring Saigon's compliance with the peace accord, Hanoi
 now argues that the United States has no supervisory authority.
 Thus, the NHAN DAN editorial on the 6th said:      "Nobody has given
 the United States the right to set itself up as a judge and act
 whenever there are violations of the agreement."  An article
 in the 4 April QUAN DOI NHAN DAN had made a similar point in
 commenting on Secretary Richardson's 1 April Meet the Press TV
 interview.  The article paraphrased an editorial in the 1 April
 New York TIMES holding that President Nixon has no right to use
 force to ensure the implementation of the accord, that the peace
 agreement provides for the ICCS to deal with violations, and
 that the United States has acknowledged this control machinery
 and cannot now demand unlimited free action.  (QUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 excised the TIMES' additional observations cl.' acterizing the
 peace-keeping mechanism as unrealistic and ineffectual.)
 DIFFERING LINES IN     The NHAN DAN Commentator article on 7 April
 ARTICLE, EDITORIAL     levelled an unusually argumentative attack
 against the Nixon Doctrine.  Commentator
 blasted the Nixon-T;.ieu communique as a "concentrated expression"
 of U.S. intent to pursue the Nixon Doctrine in Vietnam and
 Indochina, and he went on to say:  "It is not that this scheme
 was divulged only now."  To buttress his point, Commentator cited
 a French press article, written before Thieu's trip, which
 maintained that the Nixon Doctrine remains unchanged and "is not
 a question of concessions."
 The likelihood that Commentator was directing his argument at
 Hanoi's detente-seeking communist allies is bolstered by the
 fact that in the course of attacking the Nixon Doctrine he
 revived the charge that the doctrine is aimed, among other things,
 at creating divisions in the communist world.  This charge, first
 voiced by Hanoi in connection with the July 1971 announcement of
 the President's planned trip to Peking, has not been pressed since
 it appeared in an unusually polemical 17 August 1972 NHAN DAN
 editorial.*  The current Commentator article claimed that
 *  The 17 August NHAN DAN editorial is discussed in the 23 August

 the December 1972 issue of the party journal HOC TAP had also
 accused President Nixon of attempting to cause communist disunity
 but had not claimed that this was part of the Nixon Doctrine.
 The article, by party Central Committee member Hoang Quoc Viet,
 is discussed in the 17 January 1973 TRENDS, page 6.

 the doctrine advocates strengthening U.S  power to "intimidate
 or purchase" other countries, to "provoke war," to force others
 to share U.S. responsibilities and oppose revolutionary
 movements, and "on this basis, to be ready to negotiate with
 an intention of dividing and provoking the socialist countries
 and other revolutionary forces in the world."
 The Commentator article seem3 the more noteworthy in that it
 marks the first appearance of this previously regular byline
 in NHAN DAN since 9 January--prior to the signing of the peace
 accord.  Over the years, KHAN DAN Commentator articles have been
 the consistent vehicle for Hanoi's comment on U.S. policy and
 mn major Presidential pronouncements.*
 Just two days after the Commentator article appeared, a 9 April
 NHAN DAN editorial paralleled it in reviewing U.S. strategies and
 in charging that Washingtcn has attempted to take advantage of
 "differences and dissensions among the revolutionary forces."
 However, the editorial was much more optimistic than Commentator
 about the prospects for future U.S. actions.  It maintained that
 the "complete defeat" of the Unite-!j States in Vietnam has created
 a new international balance of forces and a clear possibility for
 world peace to be maintained and consolidated.
 Without mentioning the President, VNA indicated by''internal c(t.LOt  tL"`.
 qy        marks that it was quoting from him in the course of the
 statement that U.S. losses have forced the United States to "change
 its policy, 'from the era of confrontation to the era of
 negotiation."'  The editorial expressed a standard line when it
 said:  "It is common knowledge that the nature of imperialism
 remains unchanged and the imperialists would launch the most
 frenzied counterattack wherever there is a relaxation of vigilance."
 But it went on to bolster the notion that the President could be
 expected to pursue his professed desire to shift from confrontation
 to negotiation:  "At the same time, the important fact must be
 recognized that nowadays the world's situation has changed"
 and the "imperialists" cannot "rule the roost."
 *  Three articles attributed to Commentator were published in NHAN
 DAN last December and articles with this byline appeared in the
 paper every month in 1972 except October.

 PRG PRESSES ROLE AS "SOLE" TRUE REPRESENTATIVE; USSR DEMURS
 PRG media have stepped up criticism of claims that the GVN is
 the only legitimate government in South Vietnam, and Joint
 communiques on PRG Foreign Minister Nguyen Thi Binh's recent
 afficial visits to the Soviet Union and Mongolia--as transmitted
 in Front media--have contained the counterclaim that the PRG is
 the "sole" genuine representative of the South Vietnamese
 people.  The timing suggests that this may be, at least in part,
 an ecfort to ::ounterbalance GVN President Thieu's visit to the
 U.iited States and other countries.
 The 2RG's sensitivity about its status was underlined in its
 1 Apr_,. government statement marking the completion of U.S.
 troop withdrawals.*  The statement denounced the GVN's claims
 to be the only legitimate government and charged that Saigon
 has denied the existence of the PRG and the role of the third
 force in South Vietnam.  And a 7 April LIBERATION PRESS AGENCY
 editorial on Thleu's visit took issue with the United States
 for considering the GVN the only legitimate representative of
 South Vietnam.
 The argument was also aired on 4 April in a Liberation Radio
 interv-ew with PRG Vice Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son, said to
 have just returned from Paris after participating as deputy head
 of the delegation to the Paris International Conference on
 Vietnam.  He said the United States and Saigon had been thwarte'
 in their efforts at the conference to gain recognition for the
 GVN as the only legal government.  He also repeated the '1aim
 made at the time of the conference that UN Secretary Gent:-1
 Waldheim had invited the PRG "to appoint an observer and ~b .offish
 a liaison office" at the United Nations.  However, the media have
 not mentioned a letter from Mme. Binh to Waldehim announcing the
 appointment of the PRG "observer."**
 *   Other aspects of the PRG statement are noted in the 4 April 1973
 TRENDS, pages 1-2.
 **  On its Paris-to-Hanoi service channel on 7 April, VNA transmitted--
 for PRG Vice Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son's attention--a 27 March
 letter from Foreign Minister Binh to Secretary General Waldheim
 informing him that Nguyen Van Tien had been named "permanent observer"
 to the United Nations.  Tien had served as deputy chief of the PRG
 delegation to the four-party Paris conference.

 DIFFERING PRG, USSR       The communique Issued at the conclusion
 VERSIONS Of COMMUNIQUE    of Foreign Minister Binh's official
 visit to the Soviet Union (26 March-
 2 April) bore the usual label "Joint" and thus would have been
 expected to reflect agreed positions.  However, there is one
 striking discrepancy between the texts carried by Soviet and
 Front media regarding the status of the PRG.  The texts transmitted
 by Liberation Radio and LPA refer to the PRG as the "sole
 legitimate representat've of the aspirations of the South Vietnamese
 peoples"; the text as carried by Soviet media omits the modifier
 "sole" and calls the PRG "the true spokesman of the aspirations
 of the South Vietnamese population"--a formulation consistent with
 other Soviet propaganda.  Such a discrepancy in versions of a
 communique labeled "Joint" is highly unusual, and the publicity
 surrouna'ng Binh's visit sheds no light on how it may have come
 about.
 That the PRG's concern to stress the importance of its role in the
 South may have been intensified by such recent developments as
 Thieu's trip is suggested by the past pattern of its propaganda.
 Thus, between the signing of the peace agreement at the end of
 January and the release of the communique in Moscow on 2 April,
 PRG media had on only two out of 10 occasions added the modifier
 "sole" to references to the PRG as the genuine representative.*
 Notably, since the peace accord joint communiques signed by Binh
 in Iraq, Syria, and Algeria have not referred to the PRG's
 "sole" legitimacy.
 Moscow's rendering of the formulation in the communique accords
 with Podgornyy's remarks when he awarded the Order of Friendship
 to Mme. Binh on 28 March; on. that occasion he referred to the PRG
 as the "lawful spokesman of the interests of all the South
 Vietnamese people."  Although Moscow has not gone as far as the
 PRG presumably would wish, Soviet commentators have shown some
 concern to demonstrate support for the PRG while stressing that,
 as the peace accord notes, there are two administrations in the South.
 For example, Mayevskiy ir an 8 April Moscow radio roundtable
 discussion assailed the United States for opposing and obstructing
 the idea of a PRG "observer" at the United Nations.  He argued
 that since there is a Saigon observer at the United Nations, the
 United States' stand in opposing a PRG observer is inconsistent with
 its having signed the peace accord.
 *  On the other hand, Hanoi had inserted "sole" in more than half of
 some 25 references to the PRG as the genuine representative since
 the peace agreement was signed.

 CZEChOSLOVAK ASSEMBLY DELEGATION PAYS FRIENDSHIP VISIT TO DRV
 Like an Laot German delegation's visit last month,* the official
 friendship visit of a Czechoslovak Federal Assembly delegation
 to North Vietnam from 4 to 11 April seemed designed chiefly as a
 show of solidarity and support in the wake of the peace agreement.
 A recent meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU)
 in Hanoi had seemed calculated to su-?:e a similar purpose.**
 Headed by the Czechoslovak assernbly's chairman, Presidium member
 Alois Indra, the delegation was hosted by Truong Chinh, Politburo
 member and chairman of the DRV National Assembly Standing
 Committee, and was received on the 5th by First Secretary Le Duan,
 Premier Pham Van Dong, and President Ton Duc Thang.  Truong Chinh
 and India spoke at banquets on thi 5th and 10th which were
 attended by Pham Van Dong, Hoang Van Hoan, Le Thanh Nghi, and
 other Han-.::f officials.  And a 9 April mass rally heard speeches
 by India, Truong Chinh, and Tran Duy Hung, administrative committee
 chairman of the DRV National Assembly.
 A joint !)RV-Czechoslovak communique, issued on 11 April, duly
 affirmed "the fraternal friendship and militant solidarity"
 between the two peoples and supported "strict respect and
 scrupulous implementation of the Paris agreement."  The communique
 also registered both parties' "severe" c-)ndemnation of the U.S.
 Government and the Saigcn administration for "deliberate, serious,
 and systematic violations."  The GDR-DRV joint communique on
 19 March had also placed some of the responsibility for alleged
 violations on the United States.  It has been Moscow's practice,
 by contrast, to focus its criticism on Saigon, and in apparent
 deference to the Soviets the PRG-USSR joint communique of 2 April
 limited its criticism to the GVN.
 The DRV-Czechoslovak communique put Prague on record with a pledge
 to "give all-out assistance to the Vietnamese people in solving
 the aftermaths of war, rehabilitating the economy, and building
 socialism."  But like the communique on the East German visit, it
 did not mention any new aid agreement.
 *   Discussed in the TRENDS of 21 March 1973, pages 5-6.
 **  The WFTU Bureau held its 7th session in the DRV on 29-30 March,
 attended by many foreign delegations, including E. Soviet delegation
 led by P. Piminov, secretary of the General Council of soviet trade
 unions.

 PRG SPOKESMAN DENIES COR4JNISTS DOWNED ICCS HELICOPTER
 VletnumUNe communIat react ton to the he.lteop ter downing on 7 Apr II
 In which I our members of the ICCS, two 1'RG off is tal.s, and three
 crewmen were killed,. progressed from initial stralghtfor.ward
 reports of the crash to statements seemingly designed to just .11'.y
 the communist nrtion in shooting down the helicopter, and finally
 to a statrmant by the PRG Foreign Ministry spokesman on the 11th
 denytng U.S. charges that the crash resulted from an attack.
 Thus VNA's initial report on 7 April noted that the ICCS
 helicopter, one of two scheduled to fly from Gio Linh to Lao Bao
 and back, had "crashed at Lao Bao" and that search-and-rescue
 operations had been ordered.  The effort to exculpate the communists
 began on the 8th, when Hanoi and PRG media publicized a statement
 by the Quang Tri Provincial People's Revolutionary Committee
 alleging that the two aircraft had deviated from the assigned flight
 corridor along Highway 9 and penetrated an area where the Saigon
 forces had "regularly carried out aerial reconnaissance and
 commando activities" and near an area where ARVN military operations
 have been conducted.  Documenting its charge that the helicopters
 strayed off course, the statement claimed that the crash site was
 25 kilometers from the assigned flight path and 50 kilometers from
 Lao Bao--not at Lao Bao as had originally been reported.  The
 statement went on to place the blame for the "regrettable mishap"
 squarely on the two aircraft's unannounced deviation from their
 flight plan, and subsequent reports repeated this version of the
 events.
 The U.S. and GVN statements blaming the crash on an attack were
 acknowledged for the first time in the PRG Foreign Ministry
 spokesman's statement of the 11th, which specifically rejected a
 9 April White House statement to that effect and complained that
 a State Department spokesman had "grossly offended the PRG by
 stating that this accident was an extremely brutal mockery of the
 cease-fire agreement."  Insisting again that the "mishap" was
 caused by the helicopter's deviation from ccu rse, and noting in
 passing that the aircraft was piloted by Americans, the statement
 charged Washington and Saigon with spreading their "false
 accusations and slandering arguments" in an effort to capitalize
 on the incident to stir up public opinion.  The ICCS, it concluded,
 should issue strict instructions to its pilots to "avoid similar
 accidents."

 North Korean troop reduction proposals had been linked to mutual
 cuts In the ROK armed forces to a strength of 100,000 men or
 less.  In a hl.ghly unusual move In parallel, with the new offer,
 Pyongyang has addressed an appeal to the U.S. Congress aimed at
 tapping sentiment favoring a reduction of Americnn troops overseas.
 At the same time, In n move looking toward support in the next UN
 General Assembly session, Pyongyang released an appeal to all
 parliaments and governments that calls tor a removal of the UN
 mantle from the U.S. presence in Korea.
 Pyongyang's new troop reduction offer was first contained in a
 report dellver.d by Premier Kim 11 at the opening day on 5 April
 of a session of the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA).  Kim's report,
 broadcast by Radio Pyongyang on the same day, consisted largely
 of a review of the DPRK's steps and proposals on opening contacts
 with the South.  Kim made a point, however, of identifying the
 United States as the main obstacle to the North-South dialogue and
 charging it with "taking advantage of its dominant position in
 South Korea" to "obstruct in every way possible the progress of
 dialogue between North and South Korea,"  It was in the context of
 expressing Pyongyang's readiness "for opening wider the door of
 dialogue that was first opened by our own initiative" that Kim made
 the offer to "voluntarily reduce the strength of our army to 200,000
 men or less if the U.S. forces withdraw from South Korea."
 *  Neither the political-level discussions nor the Red Cross discus-
 sions that took place in Pyongyang last month appear to have made any
 progress.  Apparently deadlocked over matters of substance, both
 meetings failed to produce even the standard joint statements that
 had marked all previous full-dress meetings in the series.

 Klm'N nppenl to other countries was also formulated in an SPA letter
 t-) nil foreign governments adopted on 6 April.  Reflecting Pyongyang's
 tnvtlral move toward spotlighting U.S. responsibility, the letter
 nvofded sharp criticism of the ROK in asserting that none of the
 DPRK'N reunification proposals "has yet been realized because the
 United Stated, still occupying South Korea, eggs the South Korean
 authorities on to make a military showdown by dint of its dominant
 position and obstruct the progress of the dialogue."  Sharpening
 the paint, the letter claimed that "the South Korean authorities
 say good words when they  it face to face with us for talks but,
 after going back, break them and reject our realistic proposals
 for putting the points of agreement between the two sides into
 concrete practice as 'premature."'  The letter reiterated the new
 troop reduction offer and stressed that if U.S. troops are with-
 drawn from South Korea "the dialogue will make fast progress, North-
 South relations will be radically improved, and the question of
 the country's reunification will be smoothly solved in a peaceful
 way on the principle of national self -dete ..ination."

 forthcoming posture on reunification by dec.lar.i.ng that "we are

 a step might be, NODONG SINMUN called upon the UN to take steps
 to correct its past resolutions on Korea and to contribute to
 the peaceful reunification of Korea by "taking the cap of the
 'UN forces' from the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, making
 them withdraw from there, and dissolving UNCURK."
 TREATMENT OF PAK     In a rather genli.e warning to the South
 Koreans, Pyongyang has breached its
 abstinence from direct personal criticism of ROK President
 Pak Chong-hui for the first time in six months.  But there has
 been no return to the malicious personal vilification of the
 past, as in the brief period last September and October when
 the North Koreans renewed the personal attacks, on Pak that had
 been suspended since the 4 July 1972 joint statement.  The attacks
 last fall ended on 8 October--two days before the announcement
 that the first meeting of the North-South Coordination Committee
 would be held on 12 October.
 The recent reference to Pak by name was contained in an 8 April
 NODONG SINMUN commentary mildly chiding him for recent speeches
 calling for military strength.  According to the commentary,
 Pak had revealed "the true nature of the South Korean authorities
 who want the maintenance of tension, not its relaxation, and dream
 of 'unification by prevailing over communism,' instead of peaceful
 reunification."  The commentary admonished Pak to "behave properly"
 and "affirmatively respond to the fair and aboveboard proposals
 of our side for national reunification."
 *  By contrast, a 30 January NODONG SINMUN editorial on the Vietnam
 peace agreement harshly attacked the United States in arguing that
 the settlement would not lead to a reduction of tension in Asia
 and in charging the United States with obstructing Korean reunifica-
 tion.  The editorial called President Nixon an ."imperialist war
 chieftain" and charged that "the U.S. imperialist murderers" had
 surpassed Hitler's war crimes.

 MOSCOW, PEKING    In keeping, with Its past treatment of
 REACTION          Pyongyang's initiatives on Korean reunifica-
 tion, Moscow has carried only low-level
 commentaries expresoing support for the SPA's letter to all
 governments cal.ling for help in ending foreign interference in
 Koroa.  Moscow has not commented on the letter addressed to
 the U.S. Congress.  The only available specific comment on
 the troop reduction offer came in a foreign-language commentary
 broadcast on 9 April. which said that "it is hard to overestimate
 the significance of this action" in view of the fact that South
 Korea has a "well-equipped army of 600,000."  Moscow pointed to
 the offer as showing the DPRK's br.aic "peacefulness" and argued
 that the time has come for the United States to "pull its troops
 out of South Korea."
 Peking, on the other hand, has again offered authoritative
 support for the North Korean moves.  A PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial
 on 11 April expressed Chinese support for Kim's report and the
 two SPA letters, but it failed to take specific note of the
 troop reduction offer.   In a similar show of reluctance to
 publicize the offer, an NCNA account of the 8 April NODONG
 SINMUN editorial omitted the latter's reference to the offer as
 well as the expressed readiness to take "any bold step" toward
 reunification.  In view of Peking's change toward countenancing
 if not indeed approving a continued U.S. military presence in
 Asia and elsewhere to counterbalance the Soviets, the Chinese
 may find it discreet to sidestep a proposal calling for a U.S.
 troop withdrawal.

 MANIFESTO ANNIVERSARY
 C01MUNIST CONFERENCE NOTES MOSCOW'S "VANGUARD" ROLE
 One of the features of the recently concluded 125th anniversary
 conference on the Communist Manifesto was the resurrection of
 the old formula--ignored at the la3t world communist conference
 in 1969--that Moscow plays the "vanguard" role in the world
 communist movement.  Although obviously relevant to the issue of
 Moscow's relations with its East European allies, the reiteration
 of the formula was probably intended to symbolize the distinction
 between the Moscow-oriented and Peking-oriented wings of the
 communist movement.  As such, it served to portray the Soviet
 party as the prime embodiment of the ideals of the Manifesto, but
 did not necessarily imply that Moscow wished to reassert a claim
 to be the model and leader of all other communist parties.
 Speaking for the host party at the 15 March opening of the East
 Berlin international conference, SED secretary Kurt Hager
 characterized the Soviet Union as "the center" of the socialist
 camp.  He declared that "the Soviet Union is and remains the
 center and main force of the socialist community," adding that
 history has shown that "in Lenin's party the Soviet Union
 possesses the most experienced and battle-tested party of the
 international workers class."  The Soviet Union, he said, is
 the revolutionary "vanguard" and heads the implementation of
 the Communist Manifesto principles, adding that a communist's
 attitude toward the Soviet Union and the CPSU is "the decisive
 touchstone" of his loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian
 internationalism.  He went on to score "the Maoists" as the
 arch-transgressors of proletarian internationalism.
 This phraseology was absent from the main document of the 1969
 world communist conference, presumably because of Moscow's
 desire to avoid stirring memories of the Czechoslovak episode
 and because of the attitudes of the Romanians and other
 independent-minded delegations.  Thus the document took the
 position that "there is no leading center of the international
 communist movement," and that the parties should coordinate
 their activities voluntarily.  In now identifying the Soviet
 Union as the center of the socialist camp, Hager in effect
 reverted to the phraseology of the 1957 and 1960 Moscow
 international party conference documents.

 11 APRIL 1973
 The declaration of the 1957 conference, attended by Mao Tse-tung,
 had identified the Soviet Union as the "head" of  the invincible
 camp of socialist countries."  It also stressed the need for
 international working class unity to defend "the historic
 political and social gains effected in the Soviet Union--the
 first and mightiest socialist power--as well as in the Chinese
 People's Republic, and in all the socialist countries."
 The 1960 conference statement, registering a compromise in the
 bourgeoning Sino-Soviet rivalry for leadership, adopted a diluted
 formula saying that'bommunist and workers parties unanimously announce
 that the generally acknowledged vanguard of the world communist movement
 has been and will continue to be the CPSU, as the most experienced
 and tempered unit of the international communist movement."
 Discrepancies between the formulations of the two earlier Moscow
 documents and the 1969 one were ignored by Hager in his remark that
 the SED would continue to be guided by "the general line of the
 international communist movement collectively worked out and
 adopted at the international conferences of 1957, 1960, and
 1969."
