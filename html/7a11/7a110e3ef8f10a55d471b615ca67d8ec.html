 SOVIET AND CUBAN MILITARY ACTIVITY
 At least some of the presumed military equipment
 delivered this month by the Transbalt was probably
 stored near Havana.   An assembled cruise missile
 noted at Tapaste may have been related to an ap-
 parent mobility exercise concluded early in May
 at nearby Campo Florido.
 CASTRO'S USSR TRIP
 The Cuban leader received red-carpet treatment
 throughout his tour of the USSR.   There is no
 reporting on what progress,  if any,  is being made
 in economic or military talks that may be under
 way in Moscow.

 SOVIET AGRICULTURAL INVESTMEFT RISES
 The large increase for agriculture in 1962's in-

 well, although Khrushchev's public statments still
 stress resource-cheap solutions for farm problems.

 The regime seems to be temporizing while it searches
 for a way to control its intellectuals without giv-
 ing the appearance of an oppressive crackdown.

 POPULAR DISCONTENT IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Although youth demonstrations have been effectively

 RUMANIAN DIFFERENCES WITH MOSCOW CONTINUE
 Speeches by regime spokesmen stress national sov-

 fidence in its representative to the bloc economic
 organization in which the dispute was sparked.
 COMMUNIST CHINA SEEKS NONBLOC OIL
 It imported about 30 percent of its oil in 1962
 .and relied on the USSR for these purchases.   Aside
 from the strategic advantage of an alternate source,
 Peiping might find oil cheaper elsewhere.
 OPPOSING MILITARY FORCES RESTIVE IN LAOS
 Kong Le apparently still intends to take some lim-

 Continuation of the center-left formula is favored

 The Communist World
 SINO-SOVIET MEETING DATE SET
 The Soviet Union and Com-
 munist China have finally agreed
 to hold bilateral talks in Mos-
 cow on 5 July.  The long series
 of proposals and counterpro-
 posals concerning the time and
 place for the meeting foreshad-
 ows  the intense wrangling cer-
 tain to take place there.
 Both sides give every in-
 dication  of preparing for ne-
 gotiations that will be more
 in the nature of a new con-
 frontation than an effort at
 accommodation.  The Soviet Union
 has not yet publicized the meet-
 ing Chou En-lai had with Soviet
 Ambassador Chervonenko on 9 May,
 during which the Chinese pro-
 posed sending a delegation to
 Moscow for bilateral talks on
 15 June.  The Chinese statement
 on the subject contained only
 three terse paragraphs and noted
 that a formal reply to a Soviet
 note proposing an earlier date
 for talks would be forthcoming.
 Peiping's announcement of the
 date finally selected was also
 direct and noncommittal,  with
 none of the usual expressions
 of hope for a successful outcome
 to the talks.
 Peiping's choice of dele-
 gates gives another indication
 of difficulties ahead.  Secre-
 tary General Teng Hsiao-Ping
 carried the brunt of the debate
 for the Chinese at the Moscow
 meeting of world Communist
 leaders in November 1960.  He
 will be matched, as before, by
 the leader of the Soviet delega-
 tion, M. A. Suslov, who ably
 presented the Soviet side in
 1960.   Aiding Suslov will be the
 USSR's top ideologists and
 specialists in'interparty af-
 fairs:   Ilichev, Andropov, and
 Ponomarev.
 The coleader  of the Chi-
 nese delegation, politburo mem-
 ber Peng Chen, was the head of
 the Chinese delegation to the
 meeting of Communist parties in
 Bucharest in June 1960.  After
 one of Khrushchev's personal
 attacks on Mao Tse-tung, Peng
 countered by calling Khrushchev
 a "revisionist" who was creat-
 ing illusions about imperialism.
 "We have no trust," Peng went
 on, "in your analysis of the
 world situation."
 The Chinese continue to
 indicate this lack of trust.
 On the very day of Chervonenko's
 meeting with Chou En-lai, Pei-
 ping broadcast several bitterly
 anti-Yugoslav commentaries.
 Izvestia  promptly printed a
 rebut to  applauding Belgrade's
 new constitution and contra-
 dicting Peiping's assertion
 that Yugoslavia was not a social-
 ist country.  Two days later,
 Tirana joined in. with a typically
 Albanian abuse of Tito which
 included explicit condemnation
 of "Khrushchev and his group."
 China's Chief of State Liu
 Shao-chi also kept the polemical
 pot boiling in remarks to a
 Hanoi rally on 12 May by urging

 the cause of revolutionary
 struggle and disparaging the
 principle of peaceful coexist-
 ence.
 While the Soviet Union has
 made clear that it will not
 compromise on its basic prin-
 ciples, its policy in Laos re-
 flects an unwillingness to give
 the Chinese an unnecessarily
 easy target for criticism.
 Moscow still appears to be a
 reluctant partner to the Pathet
 Lao's present aggressiveness,
 but it has stepped up its prop-
 aganda and diplomatic support
 in recent weeks.  As has been
 true in the past when the ground
 was being prepared for talks
 with the Chinese, Soviet policy
 in general can be expected to
 take on a somewhat harder cast
 as protection against Chinese
 attack.
 SOVIET AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT RISES
 Investment in Soviet agri-
 culture in 1962 registered the
 largest annual increase since
 1955.  This was probably the
 greatest investment gain al-
 lotted any major component of
 the economy.
 While there is no real
 basis for determining that this
 is a firm trend, the relative
 increase in priority for agri-
 culture in 1962 might be a fore-
 cast of the course of agricul-
 tural investment in 1963.  Dur-
 ing the first quarter, produc-
 tion of agricultural machinery
 was continuing to grow at a
 high rate.  There recently have
 been several regime statements
 pointing to the necessity of
 improving the investment posi-
 tion of agriculture as one
 remedy for the poor production
 of the last several years. The
 latest, by party bureau chief
 for agriculture Vasily Polyakov
 cites this as one of the most
 important problems now facing
 the party.
 Khrushchev, on the other
 hand, has been stressing the
 importance of resource-cheap
 expedients and has steered clear
 of new commitments.   Recent de-
 crees on certain aspects of
 farming--e.g.,  increasing potato
 output--have stressed the boot-
 strap approach for the current
 season.
 In any event, the needs of
 agriculture are clear.  Farm
 production has been virtually
 stagnant since 1958, but the
 population has increased by
 about 14 million.  The plowing
 up of millions of acres of fal-
 low and grass lands, a program
 introduced last year, has
 greatly increased needs for
 equipment and fertilizer.

 The Soviet leadership ap-
 pears to be temporizing in its
 cultural policy while it con-
 tinues its search for a way to
 control its restive intellec-
 tuals and at the same time avoid
 the appearance of an oppressive
 crackdown.   Invective directed
 against individual writers, art-
 ists,  and musicians which
 reached a peak in late March
 and early April has abated with-
 out the imposition of harsh pu-
 nitive measures.   The central
 committee plenum which was to
 be attended by the creative in-
 telligentsia, scientists,and
 educators has been postponed
 from 28 May to 18 June.
 Discussion of  plans for
 reorganizing the cultural un-
 ions and centralizing control
 of publications has also less-
 ened.   There have been no known
 purges of editorial boards, no
 expulsions from the unions, and
 no arrests.   The only signif-
 icant personnel shift to date
 has been the replacement of
 the moderate Stefan Shchipachev
 with the conservative Georgiy
 Markov as head of the Moscow
 branch of the Writers' Union.
 The regime not only has
 failed to follow through with
 threatened repressive measures,
 but reportedly has recently re-
 leased three of the four writers
 confined in insane asylums last
 year.   Their return home will
 probably lend further encour-
 agement to the liberal writers.
 Attendance at the Young
 Writers'Conference in Moscow
 from 7 ~'to 10 May was notably
 lackluster.   The prestige-laden
 names which would attract the
 attention of Soviet readers
 had recently been under heavy
 attack, and apparently none
 of the well-known young writers
 could be trusted to follow the
 correct line from a public plat-
 form.   Those who did were de-
 scribed as primarily factory
 and farm workers who wrote in
 their spare time, and the sec-
 tions offering advice on writ-
 ing techniques were chaired by
 conservatives who are not widely
 popular with the reading public.
 The speeches of Konstantin
 Fedin, who opened the meeting,
 and of Writers' Union Secretary
 Aleksey Surkov contained en-
 couragement to the liberals.
 Their moderate tone contrasted
 strongly with the harsh per-
 sonal attacks launched by
 Komsomol Secretary Sergey Pav-
 lov, who warned against tol-
 erance for the "germs" of
 bourgeois society in ideology.
 The central committee ses-
 sion, as originally announced
 on 9 April, was to hear a re-
 port on party tasks in the field
 of "ideology" from Chairman of
 the Ideological Commission
 Leonid Ilichev.   At that time
 it appeared that the plenum
 would further the attack on
 the dissident intellectuals.
 Its postponement and the abate-
 ment of the harsh propaganda
 campaign  suggest that the re-
 gime now will try some other
 approach, apparently realizing
 that its efforts to date have
 only muffled the dissident
 voices but have had little or
 no permanent impact.

 POPULAR DISCONTENT IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Continued popular dissatis-
 faction over the economic situa-
 tion,,ferment among the Czech and
 Slovak intellectuals, and signs of
 uncertainty in the party leader-
 ship suggest that the regime is
 faced with a potentially unstable
 situation.
 An antiregime demonstration
 attempted by young workers and
 students on 1 May has been followed
 by two other outbreaks.   Shortly
 after midnight on 11 May, 250-300
 youths beat up two foreign stu-
 dents--one African and one Arab--
 on Prague's central street, ap-
 parently without police interven-
 tion.   That evening, at the same
 spot,  a group of Czechs attacked
 two more African students, attract-
 ing  a crowd of several hundred
 ;persons.   After police broke up
 the fight, youths from the crowd
 slashed the tires on the car of
 an African ambassador who had ar-
 rived at the scene.
 Czech students,  like the
 public at large, are resentful
 of the regime's economic commit-
 ments to underdeveloped areas
 which they believe lower their
 own standard of living.   The stu-
 dents also are angered by the
 large number of scholarship stu-
 dents from these areas and by the
 favored treatment the government
 accords them.
 These conditions have been
 aggravated in recent weeks by the
 flood of rumors concerning the
 current  party  purges and the pos-
 sible rehabilitation of victims
 of the Slansky trials.                      25X1
 Although the public manifes-
 tations of discontent have been
 effectively controlled by the
 police,  they are likely to con-
 tribute to the pressure on Novotny
 within the party to pursue a
 more liberal policy and initiate
 effective de-Stalinization.

 The Communist World
 Rumanian-Soviet differences
 over bloc economic policies con-
 tinue unresolved.                       Recent speeches
 by regime spokesmen in Bucharest
 stressed the need for national
 sovereignty, and the regime has
 made gestures of confidence in
 Alexandru Birladeanu, its repre-
 sentative to the Council for
 Mutual Economic Assistance (CEMA),.
 Rumania's stand may have been a
 major reason for convening the
 CEMA Executive Committee in War-
 saw on 10 May--described by Bucha-
 rest as an "extraordinary" session.
 CEMA's apparent desire for
 abandonment of certain projects
 for the rapid development of Ru-
 mania's basic industries is re-
 gardedby 3ucharest as interference
 in its plans for a well-rounded
 economy.   Reportedly, CEMA also
 wants Rumania to redirect to other
 bloc states some agricultural and
 raw material exports presently used
 to purchase technical machinery
 in the West.   Although Rumanian
 officials favor closer cooperation
 within CEMA, they advocate it
 only on the basis of voluntary
 coordination of national economic
 plans and oppose establishment of
 a supranational  CEMA authority.
 During Rumania's celebration
 of Lenin's birthday on 23 April,
 the main speaker said "'relations
 of a new type (have been) estab-
 lished among the socialist states--
 relations whose immovable law is
 their complete equality in rights,
 strict respect for independence
 and national sovereignty .  .  .
 The principal May Day speech--
 stressing the need for "strict
 respect of national independence"--
 SECRET
 was delivered by Deputy Chairman
 of the Council of Ministers Emil
 Bodnaras, a politburo member who
 is considered Moscow's right-hand
 man in Bucharest.  His selection
 was probably designed to demon-
 strate that all elements of the
 party solidly support the regime
 in its opposition to Moscow's CEMA
 plans.
 The May Day celebrations
 made little reference to the USSR
 and, in contrast to past years,
 not one living Soviet leader was
 portrayed.   An editorial on 1
 May in the Bucharest City Party
 Committee Agitator's Notebook
 stated that "the sole basis for
 progress in the national economy,
 for continuous strengthening of
 economic and political independence
 of the country,, is the machine-
 building industry."  The reference
 to "political independence" in this
 context by a party publication is
 unprecedented.
 Birladeanu, although reportedly
 told by other CEMA representatives
 to relinquish his post, attended
 the 10-14 May Executive Committee
 session.   He was designated by
 the regime to meet UN Secretary
 General Thant when he arrived on
 4 May in Rumania.   Birladeanu
 has never before fulfilled such
 a protocol function.
 Peiping may plan to exploit
 Rumanian-Soviet differences.   On
 28 April People's Daily featured
 the entire textof    a communique
 issued after a 5-8 March Rumanian
 plenum which contained the first
 definite indication of the dispute.
 The paper also gave preferential
 reportage of May Day celebrations.

 Communist China apparently
 is seriously investigating non-
 bloc sources of petroleum prod-
 ucts to cover its import needs
 --about 30 percent of its total
 supply in 1962.
 Several motives might be
 behind such approaches.   Most of
 Peiping's petroleum imports now
 come from the USSR, and Moscow
 could cease or reduce deliveries
 if its dispute with Peiping
 worsens.   Nonbloc oil delivered
 by tanker would be cheaper than
 Soviet oil, most of which is
 brought in by rail--an extremely
 expensive  form of transport.
 In addition, strategic concerns
 might indicate development of
 several sources.
 China does not now pur-
 chase crude oil, but imports
 only petroleum products.   So-
 viet deliveries reached 3.2
 million tons in 1961 but fell
 to 1.9 million tons in 1962.
 Last year, domestic crude
 oil processed in Chinese re-
 fineries provided 4.3 million
 tons of petroleum products,
 70 percent of the total supply.

 Both the Kong Le and Pathet
 Lao military forces appear
 restive amid the continued po-
 litical stalemate in Laos.
 Kong Le apparently still
 intends to take some limited
 action in the near future to
 recoup some of his losses in the
 Plaine des Jarres.   The timing
 and scope of this action is in-
 definite, but recapture of Xieng
 Khouang town appears to be a
 primary objective.
 The Communists, meanwhile,),
 have reinforced Xieng Khouang
 and    other positions in the Plaine
 des Jarres.   Despite Meo efforts
 at interdiction, supplies con-
 tinue,to arrive from North
 Vietnam over Route 7.   In other
 areas also, particularly in
 south-central Laos and in the
 Vang Vieng area north of Vien-
 tiane, the Communists continue
 to improve their positions.   Al-
 though a limited offensive by
 Kong Le in the Plaine des Jarres
 might succeed, such action could
 result in sharp Communist coun-
 termoves and a serious escala-
 tion of the fighting.
 The USSR continues to re-
 sist efforts by the UK, the
 17 May 63
 other chairman of the Geneva
 conference in Laos, to secure
 Soviet cooperation in discharg-
 ing their responsibilities.
 On 10 May, for the second time
 in three weeks, Moscow ignored
 British objections and made
 public its own draft of a mes-
 sage it had proposed that the
 co-chairmen send to Premier
 Souvanna Phouma.   The message
 repeated Pathet Lao charges
 that the dispatch of Indian and
 Canadian representatives on
 the International Control Com-
 mission (ICC) to the Plaine
 des Jarres violated the Geneva
 agreements and argued that ICC
 activities require the unanimous
 consent of all three Laotian
 factions.   The Soviet draft also
 endorsed the Pathet Lao proposal
 to replace General Phoumi's
 security force in Vientiane
 with a tripartite police force.
 Moscow's support of Pathet
 Lao attempts to frustrate the
 ICC underscores the Soviet
 leaders' unwillingness to risk
 exacerbating their relations
 with the Chinese Communists
 and North Vietnamese before
 the Sino-Soviet negotiations
 in July.

 NASIR STILL EMBROILED WITH OTHER
 The Baathist-Nasirist
 struggle has intensified during
 the past week.   It continues
 to be centered in Syria, with
 side effects in Iraq.
 In Damascus, Salah al-Din
 Bitar's cabinet was reshuffled
 on 13 May, after an attempt to
 form a cabinet under moderate
 pro-Nasirist Dr. Sami al-Jundi
 had failed.  The new cabinet is
 even more strongly Baathist
 than its predecessor, with pro-
 Nasir elements largely replaced
 by nonpolitical civil servants.
 Army Chief of Staff Hariri, who
 opposes union with the UAR, has
 taken over the Defense Ministry
 in addition to his previous
 duties and seems on the way to
 becoming Syria's strongman.
 Cairo has promptly charged
 that the new cabinet is a set-
 back for Arab unity and has
 stated publicly that Egypt will
 not accept domination of Syria
 by the Baath.
 There have been riots in
 the northern Syrian city of
 Aleppo, which continues to be
 a pro-Nasir stronghold.   It is
 doubtful that any non-Nasirist
 government, even one strongly
 for union with Egypt, could
 maintain order there without
 severe repressive measures.
 Aleppo's large urban Moslem
 proletariat is almost solidly
 pro-Nasir; the city's Chris-
 tians, about 40 percent of the
 population, remain on the side-
 lines although they are bas-
 ically anti-Nasir.  The exist-
 ence of such a substantial
 Christian population helps en-
 gender strong pro-Nasir senti-
 ment among the Moslems.   Tradi-
 tional rivalry with Damascus,
 the capital, is an additional
 factor in Aleppo's dissidence.
 Although the Iraqi regime
 is as much under Baathist con-
 trol as that in Damascus, Cairo
 thus far has soft-pedaled its
 antipathy toward the new cabinet
 in Baghdad.
 The new Iraqi cabinet is
 essentially the same as the old
 one, except that Baathist leader
 All Salih al-Sadi has been shifted
 from the key Interior Ministry
 to the Guidance Ministry, while
 retaining the title of deputy
 prime minister.   His replacement
 is another strong Baathist.
 Two non-Baathist critics of the
 regime were dropped from their
 posts.  Their replacements were
 a non-Baathist civil servant
 and a Baathist former general.
 An innovation in both the
 Syrian and Iraqi cabinets is
 the appointment of ministers of
 state for "unity affairs" --an
 attempt to continue the fiction
 that the Baathists want to move
 further toward a real union of
 the two countries with Egypt.
 Syrian Prime Minister Bitar
 has used the creation of these
 posts to imply that it is Cairo
 that is lagging on unification,
 since Egypt has not appointed
 such a minister.

 Cyprus:  An early settle-

 less likely than ever.   Follow-

 Greece and Turkey, which
 together with Britain constitute
 the "guarantors" of the London-
 Zurich agreements which estab-

 be drawn further into the dis-
 pute.   Athens has already urged
 moderation on Makarios, but its
 influence on him appears to be
 waning.   The Turkish Cypriots
 are more responsive to Ankara,,
 but the Turkish Government feels
 itself under strong pressure to
 support them rather than hold
 them back.   One of the Greek
 Cypriot cabinet members has urged
 the US to intervene to "kee   us

 The "ecretement" (leveling-off) plan originated in Bonn, but has been
 most vigorously espoused by France as an alternative to the US proposal
 that -- with a limited number of exceptions -- all tariffs on industrial items
 be reduced by 50 percent. As now generally understood, "ecretement" is
 intended to achieve a harmonization of tariff levels by the major industrial
 nations -- e.g., 10 percent for finished goods, 5 percent for semifinished,
 and zero for raw materials. As a first step toward this, these nations would
 reduce by 50 percent the difference between their present rates and the
 suggested target rates, the remaining difference presumably to be eliminated
 Iater.
 The rationale for "ecretement" is derived primarily from the fact that,
 while the average levels of the EEC's common external tariff (CXT) and the
 US tariff schedule are about the same, there is a greater spread in the US
 tariff rates. Most of the CXT rates fall in the 15-25 percent range, largely
 because the high and low tariffs were eliminated when the EEC calculated the
 CXT by averaging the national rates of the six member countries. About 22
 percent of the US tariff rates, however, are above 30 percent, and these rates
 apply to about 7 percent of the total volume of US trade. Supporters of the
 "ecretement" plan have therefore alleged that the US would still retain
 substantial protection even after these high rates are halved.
 The US has vigorously opposed "ecretement" for a variety of reasons,
 among them the fact that it would not result in as great a reduction in tariffs
 as the US legislation proposes. Moreover, the US believes that certain low
 tariffs -- which would not be reduced under "ecretement" -- may be as great
 an obstacle to trade as high rates. Finally, "ecretement" would require larger
 tariff reductions from the US than the EEC, thus failing to assure the US of full
 reciprocity.
 Concerning agriculture, the US has proposed that agricultural trade be
 treated in the forthcoming trade talks in three categories -- those covered by
 tariffs, those covered by other restraints (such as the EEC's variable import
 levies), and those for which world-wide commodity agreements may be
 negotiated. The US has also sought interim EEC guarantees against diminution
 of its markets in the EEC for farm items. The EEC, however, has so far declined
 to make any specific commitments as to how agricultural products should be
 treated, because there are still major gaps in the EEC's common agricultural
 policy (CAP). For example, the organization of the EEC's internal market for
 dairy products, beef, and rice has yet to be decided, France and West Germany
 are at odds over financing the CAP, and these two countries are also at opposite

 Europe
 The 8-9 May meeting of the
 Common Market's Council did little
 to alleviate the problems facing
 the US trade expansion program.
 It authorized EEC participation
 in the tariff negotiations envis-
 aged by the Trade Expansion Act
 (TEA), but the two sides are still
 far apart on specifics.
 The Council's mandate regard-
 ing the TEA negotiations falls
 short of US hopes in two important
 respects.   With regard to trade in
 industrial items, it endorsed the
 idea of a "linear, automatic, and
 general" cut in tariffs, but
 avoided any commitment to an across-
 the-board reduction of 50 percent
 as proposed by the TEA.   Instead,
 the Council suggested that the GATT
 establish a working party to
 "evaluate" the US and "any other"
 proposals, referring specifically
 to the problem allegedly posed by
 the disparity between the US and
 EEC tariff schedules.   The effect
 of this is to keep alive the
 French-espoused "ecretement" plan
 for harmonizing tariffs among the
 major industrial nations--a plan
 which the US rejects but which is
 backed to some extent by France's
 EEC  partners. (See background data
 on facing page.)
 Although the Council agreed
 "in principle" with the US posi-
 tion that the GATT negotiations
 should deal with trade in agri-
 cultural products, this EEC com-
 mitment is also imprecise.   The
 Council rejected the French demand
 that GATT talks on agriculture
 must await the full elaboration of
 the EEC's common agricultural
 policy (CAP), but also stated that
 "thoroughgoing   agricultural nego-
 tiations will only be carried out
 to the extent that the EEC will
 have formulated common positions."
 In effect, therefore, the easing
 of trade restrictions in the ag-
 ricultural sector is contingent--
 as before--on the EEC's resolving
 its deep internal differences
 over farm policy.
 In view of these positions,
 it remains doubtful that prepara-
 tion for the TEA negotiations can
 be completed by early next year,
 nor is their success assured once
 they have been organized.   Some
 observers believe that France has
 seized upon the "ecretement" plan
 because it wishes only the minimal
 reductions in EEC tariffs in keep-
 ing with the objective of creating
 an autarchic community.   Neverthe-
 less, Paris has marshaled consider-
 able support among the other EEC
 members for the argument that a
 straight linear cut in tariffs
 would leave the US with substan-
 tial protection on certain im-
 ports and deprive the EEC of
 bargaining powers in any future
 tariff  negotiations.
 It has also long been evi-
 dent that France is tough on
 the TEA issue in part to per-
 suade the other EEC members to
 complete the CAP.   Protectionist
 sentiment among the West German
 farmers, however, is the main
 obstacle to agreement on the
 CAP, and France is not alone in
 pressing for early agreement on
 farm policy.  Moreover, a Com-
 mon Market restricted to free trade
 in industrial products only is
 neither the kind of community
 envisaged by the EEC treaty nor
 one which would likely prove to
 be viable.

 ITALY'S INTERIM GOVERNMENT
 The immediate problem fac-

 is the make-up of the interim
 government pending clarification
 --at a party congress set for
 18-21 July--of the Nenni Social-
 ists' future relationship with
 the government.   Continuation
 of the center-left formula is
 the aim of the cabinet parties

 The scene inside Haiti
 appears quiet and dictator Du-
 valier's position at least
 temporarily more secure than
 ever.
 The regime, meanwhile, is
 turning its efforts to rally-
 ing demonstrations of "popular
 support."  Presumably the stage
 is being set for the mass cele-
 bration  scheduled to take place
 in Port-au-Prince on 22 May.
 Duvalier on 15 May publicly
 denied he was contemplating
 leaving the country.  He said
 also there was no truth to
 reports he would declare Haiti
 a "socialist republic" on 22
 May.   The Haitian consul in
 Miami reportedly believes, how-
 ever, that if Duvalier remains
 in power through the end of the
 month, he will take his coun-
 try out of the Organization of
 American States and turn to
 Cuba or the Sino-Soviet bloc
 for aid.   Factors impelling
 him in this direction, accord-
 ing to the consul, include the
 urgings of his Marxist-inclined
 minister of public works and
 trusted lieutenant, Luckner
 Cambronnp, and the 12 May an-
 nouncemetht of the formation
 of a Haitian "government in
 exile" under politicians Louis
 Dejoie and Daniel Fignold.
 The Dejoie-Fignol6 organ-
 ization evidently constitutes
 an attempt by leading exile
 figures to bury differences
 temporarily and attract wide
 support from the Haitian people.
 Its two primary leaders have
 been political rivals at least
 since early 1957 and differ
 ideologically, although both
 used Castro's radio to prop-
 agandize against Duvalier in
 1959.   Dejoie is a conservative
 from the small, formerly dom-
 inant mulatto class, while
 Fignold is a demagogic non-
 Communist leftist who enjoys
 considerable support among the
 mass of Haiti's Negro laborers.
 Both men probably would attempt
 to overshadow the independents,
 leftists, and democratically
 oriented reformers they claim
 are associated with them now.
 There have been no indi-
 cations that any government

 will grant recognition to the
 Dejoie-Fignole group.   Dejoie
 told the press he expected rec-
 ognition  from                     Dominican Presi-
 dent Juan Bosch, but a public
 .statement by Bosch on 15 May
 appeared definitely to rule
 out this possibility.   The exiles
 may also have hoped for recog-
 nition by Venezuela, which of-
 ficially severed diplomatic
 ties with Haiti on 15 May, but
 Venezuelan officials have stated
 that recognition would not even
 be considered.
 Other Haitian exile groups
 have denounced the "government
 in exile."  Pierre Rigaud, a
 leader of the Dominican-based
 "Democratic National Union"
 organization, has asserted that
 the only "valid" Haitian govern-
 ment would be "the one that
 arises within Haiti."
 Bosch appears to be disen-
 gaging himself from events in
 Haiti and to be giving the ini-
 tiative to the OAS--for which
 he has little respect--and to
 the United States.   He told
 Ambassador Martin on 14 May he
 would "do nothing whatever about
 Haiti now," since the "psycho-
 logical moment" for acting had
 passed.   Dominican troops are
 withdrawing from the border area
 and can be expected to continue
 to do so if the situation re-
 mains calm.   All could be quick-
 ly redeployed, however.
 Dominican authorities ap-
 parently prevented a Haitian
 exile group in their country
 17 May 63
 from invading Haiti on the night
 of 14-15 May.   This group,  iden-
 tified as the "United Revolu-
 tionary Front" of Jacques and
 Raymond Cassagnol, may have
 intended to take over an area
 of Haiti in order to permit
 the Dejoie-Fignole group to
 establish itself there and
 press for recognition abroad.
 Raymond Cassagnol, obviously
 furious over the Dominican
 action, has charged US inter-
 ference and has threatened
 continued "sabotage and terror-
 ism" in order to topple Duvalier.
 Ambassador Thurston in
 Port-au-Prince suggests some
 dramatic new move in French-
 Haitian relations--possibly
 a French invitation to Duvalier
 to visit France in the near
 future--may be imminent.   He
 notes that Haitian officials
 have evidently been pleased
 with the contents of a recent
 letter from De Gaulle to Du-
 valier.   Duvalier had appealed
 to De Gaulle in March for eco-
 nomic aid, and this subject
 presumably was taken up in the
 French President's reply.
 The Liberian ambassador
 to Haiti, author of a recent
 proposal discussed with US
 officials to appeal to Duvalier
 to step down, now has changed
 his view.   He told Ambassador
 Thurston on 14 May that, since
 Duvalier may feel he has come
 through the recent crisis in
 relatively good shape, this
 would be the wrong psycholog-
 ical moment to make such a
 demarche.

 Western Hemispher
 Argentina's latest cabinet
 crisis is not likely to be resolved
 for at least several more days.
 Meanwhile, the intense political
 maneuvering before the 20 May dead-
 line for inscription of candidates
 for the 7 July elections is adding
 to the political unrest.
 President Guido has so far
 managed to replace half his eight-
 man cabinet, which resigned on 12
 May, but he will probably need an-
 other week or two to complete it.
 A major difficulty is probably the
 reluctance of those approached to
 accept short-term appointments
 during a period of political tur-
 moil that is likely to last until
 the inauguration of a new govern-
 ment, set for 12 October.
 Former Interior Minister Rauch
 precipitated the cabinet resigna-
 tions.  As part of his campaign
 against the "corrupt" influence of
 ex-dictator Peron, ex-President
 Frondizi, and Frondizi's adviser,
 Rogelio Frigerio, he published
 statements implying malfeasance in
 office on the part of four minis-
 ters.  While many military and
 civilian elements supported Rauch's
 general line, they considered his
 tactics clumsy, overdrawn, and a
 possible threat to the election
 schedule.
 Rauch's successor is Brig.
 Gen. Osiris Villegas, whom embassy
 officials consider an able officer
 and thoroughly pro-Western.   He
 strongly supports army commander
 Ongania, the dominant figure behind
 Guido, and is on record in favor
 of going through with the elections.
 Appointed labor minister was
 Bernardo Bas, lawyer and trade
 union adviser,
 was approved
 by Ongania.       Temporary appointments
 include Acting Foreign Minister
 Tiburcio Padilla, a former health
 minister, and former Public Works
 Minister Zubiri, who is handling
 the economy ministry.
 In the meantime, Peronist
 leaders are disturbing the polit-
 ical atmosphere by their deliber-
 ately two-sided electoral strategy.
 Peronist Coordinating Council
 President Matera declared in a
 radio and television address to
 his party on 13 March that their
 Popular Union (UP) party would not
 take part in any electoral fronts,
 The front's formation--by the
 UP, Frondizi's UCRI, and five'other
 small parties--is a matter of pub-
 lic record, but Matera's speech,
 guises Peronist intentions.

 SHOWDOWN IN BRITISH GUIANA
 ;25X6
 Neither the Jagan government
 nor the Trade Union Congress shows
 any disposition to make the com-
 promises necessary to settle British
 Guiana's general strike, now in its
 .fourth week.  The government's dec-
 laration            of  a state of emergency
 last week increased tension, and new
 disturbances could break out at
 any time.
 Premier Jagan, influenced by
 extremist advisers, refuses to with-
 draw the controversial labor legis-
 lation that caused the walkout.
 Japan on 15 May requested the
 legislature to extend the state of
 emergency for three months.   Despite
 some waverers, his small majority
 in the assembly is expected to hold
 firm.  This makes remote the possi-
 bility of a no-confidence vote on
 the way he has handled the strike
 situation.
 TENSIONS IN COLOMBIA
 The tensions and security build-
 up generated last week by the threat
 of demonstrations to promote the po
 litical comeback of ex-dictator Rojas
 Pinilla are symptomatic of the deep
 sense of uncertainty that now per-
 vades Colombia's political life.
 Bogota, on 10 May, was an armed camp.
 Up to 4,000 persons were detained,
 business activity was severely cur-
 tailed, and public transportation
 came nearly to a standstill.
 Underlying much of the current
 uneasiness is a widespread lack of
 confidence in President Valencia's
 administration stemming from dis-
 satisfaction with his failure to do
 Jagan's recent offer to re-
 sign and hold new elections was a
 ploy indicative of the tensions he
 is under, because the terms in
 which it was couched are not accept-
 able either to the British or the
 opposition partied.
 Meanwhile, the government, act- 25X1
 ing under its emergency powers, has
 started to take over the distribu-
 tion of food and fuel, both of whiff
 are in short supply.   Shortages may
 remain acute, however, if workers
 elsewhere in the Caribbean, not-
 ably in Trinidad, embargo shipments
 to British Guiana as a token of
 support for the strikers.  Govern-
 ment officials claim they have asked
 Cuba for petroleum products, a
 request Havana might honor as a
 gesture of solidarity with Jagan.
 anything about steadily deteriorat-
 ing economic conditions.   The cost of
 living, for example, is up 20 per-
 cent since December and still rising.
 Also, Colombia's poor foreign ex-
 change position could develop into a
 balance-of-payments crisis before the
 end of the year.
 The sense of futility created
 by these conditions is stifling
 business, prompting an increased
 flight of capital, and aggravating
 unemployment.   Valencia, by allowing
 the situation to drift as he has, is
