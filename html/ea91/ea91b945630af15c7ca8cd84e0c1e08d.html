 Soviet media have begun to send out mixed
 signals on the outlook for Soviet-US relations.
 The evidence is tentative, but there are signs that
 Moscow has some qualms about continuing to
 accord detente with Washington, the degree of
 pr eminence that has become commonplace over
 the past two years or so.
 A major article in Pravda on March 30,
 marking the third anniversary of the 24th party
 congress at which Brezhnev launched his "peace
 offensive," gave scant attention to US-Soviet ties.
 By contrast, last year's anniversary article placed
 considerable stress on the gains achieved in bila-
 teral relations.
 The recent article did take brief note of the
 "extremely important effect" improved US-
 Soviet relations have had on International affairs.
 The usual references, however, to meetings at the
 summit, SALT, and recent progress in bilateral
 ties were missing.
 In addition, the allusion to the US was fol-
 lowed by a reference to the "great complexity"
 of the current international situation. This situa-
 tion, said Pravda, is marked by the continuing
 military preparations of various capitalist coun-
 tries and by their counterattacks against Mos-
 c,-)w's efforts toward detente.
 Last year's Pravda article hailed the "para-
 mount international significance" of US-Soviet
 relations and praised the results of the May 1972
 summit. It listed he major agreements concluded
 between General Secretary Brezhnev and P,esi-
 dent Nixon, and it expressed optimism over
 prospects for SALT.
 Last week's Pravda article is not the only
 straw in the wind. Earlier this year, the Soviet
 Communist  Party's theoretical  journal
 Page
 Kominunist  gave a similarly perfunctory treat-
 ment to relations with Washington. Handling of
 this sensitive issue in the Soviet press suggests a
 more cautious attitude on Moscow's part, if not a
 slackening of enthusiasm on the part of some
 Soviet leaders.
 The Soviets have already found ways to
 demonstrate their displeasure with Washington's
 expanded role in the Middle East, with the delay
 in granting the USSR most-favored-nation status
 in trad3, and with US statements on nuclear tar-
 geting. These concerns, together with uncertainty
 over the political situation in the US, may have
 led the Soviets to pause and take stock of their
 own expectations with regard to detente.
 This has not prevented Moscow, however,
 from trying to counter what Soviet commentators
 have called "pessimistic" press accounts of the
 outcome of Secretary Kissinger's recent visit to
 Moscow.
 One commentator said that the Secretary's
 visit was a "new contribution" to relations and an
 "important step" toward guaranteeing the success
 of President Nixon's planned visit to the USSR.
 Taking issue with negative We:,tern press assess-
 ments of the progress made on SALT during the
 recent Moscow talks, the commentator contended
 that mutually acceptable solutions are possible
 despite the complicated nature of the problem.
 The Soviet international  affairs weekly, Life
 Abroad, went even further, asserting that "an
 agreement could be worked out in time for the
 planned summit meeting."
 A similarly positive portrayal of the Sec-
 retary's visit was carried by Tass, which noted
 that improvement in US-Soviet ties has allowed
 tangible results in several major areas, including
 arms control.  Refuting allegations about the
 "tough" position Moscow adopted on SALT dur-
 ing the Secretary's visit, Tass banded these idle
 speculation.

 Awaiting transportation
 An article in /zvesiiu took much the same
 line. It presented a more sober appraisal of the
 prospect for progress at SALT, however, pointing
 '.o the complicated nature of the problem and the
 alleged opposition of the Pentagon.
 There is increasing evidence that the Soviets
 have decided to cut back significantly on the
 number of Jews allowed to emigrate to Israel.
 This decision is probably related to the poor
 prospects Moscow sees for gaining most-favored-
 nation treatment from the US. During the first
 three months of 1974, Soviet Jewish emigration
 to Israel was about 22 percent less than the same
 period last year.
 The  Soviets contend disingenuously that
 there are simply fewer Jews who now wish to
 leave the Soviet Union. According to a Moscow
 radio commentator, applications for emigration
 decreased sharply as a result of the October war
 in the Middle Ease, and in January of this year
 applications were less than half the number of
 January 1973. The commentator claimed that
 educated Soviet Jews do not want to give up the
 advantages of socialism and are skeptical about
 the kind of treatment they would receive in
 Israel.
 It is becoming clear, however, that the
 authorities have deliberately put new bureaucratic
 obstacles in the way of prospective emigrants.
 These procedures have included greater police
 scrutiny of the applicant, the need to submit
 character references that go back at least six
 months, and a requirement that application forms
 be typed.
 In practice, a would-be emigrant must now
 quit his iob at least six months before applying
 for emigration, since upon applying he runs the
 risk of being fired and thus receiving a poor
 character reference. The requirement that applica-
 tion forms be typed is a lesser obstacle, although
 it does mean that a prospective emigrant must
 secure a permit-required of all private citizens-
 to purchase a typewriter, or find some other
 method of having the application typed.
 Such harassment has doubtless discouraged a
 great number of potential applicants but probably
 is not the only factor contributing to the decline
 in emigration. Despite persistent Soviet prot-
 estations that "practically any" citizen may go to
 Israel, there have recently been signs that Soviet
 authorities are simply refusing exit permits to
 large  numbers of Jews even  after they have
 managed to satisfy the bureaucratic requirements.
 Moscow's tougher policy can probably be
 attributed to the trouble the USSR is having in
 getting most-favored-nation treatment from the
 US. The message seems to be that if the US
 Congress is willing to turn down trade concessions
 to Moscow by linking the issue to Soviet emi-
 gration policy, the Kremlin is prepared to reverse
 this linkage and restrict emigration until most-
 favored-nation treatment is granted.

 Egypt: Countering The Critics
 President Sadat appears to be growing in-
 creasingly concerned that criticism of his foreign
 and domestic policies from the Soviets and Arab
 radicals will adversely affect the willingness of
 other Arab states to continue peace negotiations.
 He has begun counter-attacking and, in a major
 policy address on April 3, lashed out ai the USSR
 for being not the protector of Arab interests it
 claims to be, but instead a hindrance to the Arab
 cause.
 Sadat recited a long history of unfulfilled
 Soviet promises of aid and charged that Moscow
 had obstructed his efforts over the years to initi-
 ate hostiiities by consistently attempting to limit
 his focus to diplomatic rather than military
 action. At the same time, he implied, Soviet
 tactics virtually guaranteed that diplomatic action
 would be fruitless.  Largely because Moscow
 sought to keep the Arabs militarily weak, the US
 gained the impression that the Arabs were ineffec-
 tive "dead bodies" too weak to bargain with or to
 deserve diplomatic intervention to break the
 Arab-Israeli impasse.
 By emphasizing that the Arabs would still be
 in this stagnant situation had he heeded Soviet
 opposition to war, Sadat was telling the other
 Arabs, particularly Syria, that Moscow is an un-
 reliable ally and that dependence on Soviet advice
 in the current negotiations will alsc do the Arabs
 no good.
 In his speech, Sadat also implicitly criticized
 the Soviets in treating domestic matters, although
 in this case his approach was more in the nature
 of a defense of his own policies than a direct
 attack on the critics of those policies. Both the
 Soviets and  radical Arabs have weighed in
 strongly against the anti-Nasir propaganda cam-
 paign launched in Cairo newspapers two months
 ago by overzealous Sadat supporters. Moscow and
 the radical Arabs seized on the campaign as
 indicative of a general rightward drift in Egypt,
 and Sadat is concerned about the impact of their
 charges that he is selling our both Nasir's "revolu-
 tion" and general Arab interests for the sake of
 the US and of his own domestic power position.
 Sadat has attempted in recent weeks to
 backtrack from the blatant criticism of Nasir by
 noting that he shares responsibility for all of
 Nasir's policies and is attempting now not to
 "destroy Nasir's legacy" but to correct the "nega-
 tives" of his predecessor's regime. This oft-re-
 peated theme--emphasized again in his speech this
 week-reflects some misgivings that Soviet crit-
 icism on the issue might strike a responsive chord
 among Egyp; fans, as well as other Arabs.
 Although Sadat seems to  be somewhat
 defensive in countering Soviet propaganda on
 internal Egyptian affairs, his outspoken attack on
 Moscow's war and peace policy may herald
 har:Mer attacks in the future on Soviet interests in
 Egypt. The speech was preceded by an AI-Aliranr
 editorial questioning the continued value of the
 Soviet-Egyptian friendship treaty and, although
 Sadat himself did not mention the treaty, he laid
 the groundwork for a later call for its modifica-
 tion if the close relationship with Moscow that it
 symbolizes begins to rankle still more. Such a
 move would risk Egypt's major source of military
 aid, however, and Sadat will have to approach this
 issue cautiously.
 Moscow, which has not yet responded to
 Sadat's speech, announced on Wednesday that it
 is sending a new ambassador to Cairo-Vladimir
 Polyakov. Although he has less status than his
 predecessor, Polyakov is an expert in Middle East
 affairs and probably has the primary task of
 salvaging whatever  is possible of the Soviet-
 Egyptian relationship.
 Since the October war, Moscow has made
 energetic efforts to consolidate its relations with
 other Arab states-mainly Syria and Iraq-as
 alternative areas of influence. The Soviets will
 most likely, however, attempt to maintain their
 military aid program  in Egypt, where they
 undoubtedly want to protect their investment
 while waiting hopefully for the balance to again

 Israel-Syria: The Golan Front
 Military Tensions High
 A growing sense of crisis developed on the
 Golan front this week as shelling between Israeli
 and Syrian forces entered its fourth week. Tel
 Aviv demonstrated its concern on April 1 by
 sending more than 50 fighters over Syria, Leba-
 non, and the Mediterranean in a bold display of
 air power. The following day, it gave wide public-
 ity to its reinforcement of the front in a move
 apparently designed both to warn Damascus
 against any renewal of offensive action and to
 reassure the home front of  Israel's military
 preparedness. Late in the week, however, Israel
 reduced its level of military action, possibly to

 France: Vying to Succeed Pompidou
 The first round of elections to select a suc-
 cessor to President Pompidou will be held on
 April 28 or May 5-earlier than either the Gaull-
 ists or their leftist rivals would have preferred.
 Gaullist Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Socialist
 Francois Mitterrand are the main contenders, but
 there will be several other candidates; most will
 declare within a week.
 The Communists, Socialists, and left Radi-
 cals had hoped an election would not occur until
 at least next year. They wanted more time to
 develop an image of international statesman for
 their leader, Socialist Francois Mitterrand, 57.
 The leftist alliance also hoped for time to exploit
 popular dissatisfaction with the government's fail-
 ure to resolve the country's economic problems.
 One Socialist leader recently said, "If we believed
 in God, we would be in church lighting candles
 for Pompidou's health."
 The leaders of the leftist alliance are still not
 agreed on how to present their candidates. The
 Communists want Mitterrand to run as the sole
 leftist candidate fearing that one of their own
 would do poorly and expose the party's weak
 position. Mitterrand, however, wants his allies to
 field candidates so he can run on a moderate
 platform, rather than be associated with the more
 extreme portions of the alliance program. He is
 gambling that he will win enough votes on the
 first round to make it into the second, where he
 hopes to prevail with the additional support of
 Communist voters.
 The other main candidate, Jacques Chaban-
 Dalmas, 58, is a liberal Gaullist and a former
 prime minister. At a party congress last Novem-
 ber, his Gaullist colleagues indicated that they
 would support him as a successor to Pompidou.
 The governing coalition-Gaullists, Independent
 Republicans, and a small centrist group-is in
 some disarray however. One of their major prob-
 lems is that Giscard d'Estaing, the leader of the
 Independent Republicans, may choose to break
 coalition unity and  run in the first round.
 Giscard, 47, was thought to be Pompidou's favor-
 ite, but he faces serious opposition from ortho-
 dox Gaullists. Giscard is also hampered by his
 patrician image and his association with France's
 economic woes as Pompidou's economics and
 finance minister.
 First-round challenges would  also come
 from:

 ? Pierre Messmer, 58, the lackluster, or-
 thodox Gaullist prime minister. Messmer re-
 portedly was Pompidou's second choice to
 succeed him;
 ? Jean Lecanuet, 53, leader of one of the
 two center union factions. He won 16 percent
 of the first ballot in 1965 against De Gaulle.
 He may run to avoid having to associate him-
 self prematurely with one of the front run-
 ners;
 ? Edgar Faure, 65, the leader of the left-
 wing Gaullists and president of the National
 Assembly. He sees himself as a compromise
 candidate;
 ? Alain Poher, 64, the centrist who will
 act as interim president. In 1969, when he
 served in that capacity after De Gaulle's resig-
 nation, Poher won 42 percent of the second-
 round vote against Pompidou.
 Foreign Minister Michel Jobert is now re-
 ceiving considerable publicity for his aggressive
 foreign policy tactics, but he lacks a politic-I
 base-he is not even a member cf any party-
 which makes him an unlikely candidate.
 No president has been elected in the first
 round under the present system. In view of the
 many likely candidates, this election probably
 will be no exception. Uncommitted voters make
 up some 30 percent of the French electorate and
 usually determine the outcome. The French con-
 stitution provides that the Constitutional Council
 must set an election date within 20 to 35 days of
 the death of a president. Candidates must file by
 April 9 or 16. If no candidate receives an absolute
 majority on the first ballot, a second must take
 place two weeks later, with the two candidates
 who receive the most votes on the first ballot
 participating in the run-e`.. The law also allows
 the top candidates to withdraw in favor of one of
 the first-ballot losers. This can happen when a
 candidate is thought more likely to draw wide
 second-ballot support. On the second
 simple majority elects.

 CHINA: HARD LINE EXPECTED AT UN
 Peking is demonstrating the importance it
 attaches to the special session of the UN General
 Assembly next week by sending the highest rank-
 ing Chinese delegation ever to the UN. Vice
 Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, a member of the Polit-
 buro, will lead the delegation, with Vice Foreign
 Minister Chiao Kuan-hua, a veteran at UN meet-
 ings, as his deputy.
 The special session, which will deal with raw
 materials and economic development, affords
 China the opportunity again to champion efforts
 by the developing countries to control their own
 natural resources. The Chinese may also antic-
 ipate that they will have an opportunity to dis-
 cuss Taiwan and other issues with US officials.
 At the session itself, the Chinese almost
 certainly will criticize the US and USSR for
 "plundering" the economic resources of the
 developing countries. The Chinese, for example,
 probably will defend the pricing policies of the oil
 producing states and seek to blame high oil rites
 on the "exploitative" n'ture of capitalism and on
 manipulations by the large oil companies. Because
 of leftist pressure built up during the current
 anti-Confucius, anti-Lin campaign in China, Teng
 and Chiao probably will be much more critical of
 the international activities of US corporations
 than they have been in the recent past.
 Increased criticism of US business would be
 in line with the more militant note Peking has
 been sounding on several foreign policy issues in
 recent weeks. Speeches by Premier Chou En-Ii i
 have included reminders that China, as a socialise
 country, would continue to support revolutionary
 causes, and Chou's speech at a banquet on April 1
 for visiting Cambodian Communist leader Khieu
 Samphan was resolute in its reaffirmation of rev-
 olution  in the abstract. Increasingly militant
 rhetoric on some international issues has been
 accompanied by a harder attitude toward Taiwan.
 Page  8
 Chou seems to be holding firm on other
 foreign policy issues hearing on relations with the
 West. Western businessmen have encountered few
 delays in conducting business with the Chinese,
 and the volume r. Chinese imports from the West
 continues high despite criticism in the Chinese
 media of "over-reliance" on such imports. Despite
 the fact that Chou is under pressure-on Taiwan
 as well as other issues-there appears to be no
 alteration in the substance of Chinese foreign
 policy.

 Lao capital after an absence of some 11 years.
 Following a brief stopover in Hanoi, the Lao
 Communist leader-accompanied by a small
 entourage of senior officials-arrived by Pathet
 Lao aircraft in Vientiane on April 3. A crowd
 estimated at several thousand, including many
 students, welcomed the Prince from Sam Neua. In
 a prepared statement, ;ouphanolivong struck a
 positive note on the prospects for success of the
 new government, but he cautioned that on the
 basis of past experience-an obvious reference to
 the rapid collapse of coalition experiments in
 1957 and 1962-obstacles may yet remain in the
 search for peace and national reconciliation.
 After more than 13 months of hard bargain-
 ing, the two Lao sides are ready to form the
 nation's third coalition government in nearly 17
 years. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and his
 half-brother, Lao Communist chairman Prince
 Souphanouvong, are now expected to present
 their new coalition cabinet and advisory political
 council to the King for royal investiture on April 5.
 The final breakthrough in the protracted
 negotiations resulted from private discussions
 between Souvanna and Souphanouvong's personal
 emissary, Phoumi Vongvichit, who recently re-
 turned to Vientiane. The success of this dialogue
 paved the way for Souphanouvong's return to the
 Souvanna and Souphanouvong proceeded to
 the royal capital of Luang Prabang in preparation
 for the investiture ceremonies. They are to be
 joined there by the entire membership of the
 coalition cabinet and advisory political council.
 An official roster of the new coalition's
 membership has not yet been announced. It
 appears, however, that key individuals in Sou-
 vanna's present cabinet will continue to occupy
 important' portfolios-including defense, interior
 and finance-in the coalition cabinet, and that,
 for both sides, the new government will be a
 reflection of the remarkable staying power of the
 Lao ruling elite over more than a decade.

 Souphan-
 ouvong, instead of becoming one of the two
 deputy premiers under Prime Minister Souvanna
 may assume the chairmanship of the advisory
 council which will reportedly sit in Luang Pra-
 bang. This would indic?ie that the Pathet Lao
 attach considerable importance to the council.
 The protocol to the February 1973 peace agree-
 ment weights the leadership of the joint council
 in favor of the Pathet Lao, makes the council a
 policy-recommending body independent of and
 co-equal with the coalition cabinet, and gives it
 the responsibility for organizing general elections.

 After a long period of obscurity, Khmer
 Communist "defense minister" Khieu Samphan is
 having his day in the international limelight.
 When Samphan arrived in Hanoi on March 28, he
 received a warmer welcome than that accorded
 Sihanouk earlier on his way back to China from
 Laos. The Chinese staged another impressive
 reception when Samphan arrived in Peking on
 April 1. Samphan's next stop reportedly will be
 Pyongyang.
 In his major speech in Hanoi, Samphan
 emphasized that the only solution in Cambodia
 was for the US to end its "aggression" and ter-
 minate all forms of support to the Lon Nui gov-
 ernment. Samphan asserted that Cambodians
 would then be able to settle their own af'fairs. He
 did not repeat Sihanouk's recent call for direct
 talks with Washington. North Vietr,a;lnese leaders
 publicly assured Samph;,n that Hanoi could be
 counted on to re der full support to the Khmer
 Communists. They also indicated that they would
 resist any efforts to press the insurgents into
 negotiating.
 In Peking, Samphan stuck to his militant line
 and again denounced the US and its "lackeys" for
 alleged espousal of "sham cease-fire, sham talks,
 and sham peace." Premier Chou ' n-lai's public
 remarks reflected the cautious torn that has char-
 acterized Peking's statements on Cambodia over
 the past year. Although Chou made no specific
 reference to peace proposals, he implied approval
 of a negotiated settlement in Cambodia by citing
 the Paris and Vierstie ie cease-fire agreements as
 "victories" in Indochina.
 From the Khmer Communist viewpoint,
 Samphan's visits probably are intended to empha-
 size that the Khmer Communists are an inde-
 pendent force that must be reckoned with politi-
 cally before the fighting in Cambodia can end. In
 addition, his trip to Peking has served to identify
 the Chinese more closely with the Khmer Com-
 munist  leadership.  The  prominence  accorded
 Samphan also raises questions concerning Siha-
 nouk's (political future.
 Khmer Communist forces this week ap-
 peared intent on following up their recent victory
 at Oudong with another at Kampot. They kept up
 their pressure against the southwestern provincial
 capital,  pushing  government  defenders  back
 within a mile of the city at several points. Al-
 though Phnom Penh has sent more reinforce-
 ments to Kampot, the situation there at mid-week
 continued to deteriorate.
 Closer to Phnom Penh, lead elements of the  25X1
 Cambodian Army units participating in the effort
 to retake Oudong were still stalled a mile short of
 the town.
 A Change of Councils
 On the political front, President Lon Nol has
 scrapped the High Political Council. Ostensibly
 the country's ruling body, the council had
 become increasingly ineffective due largely to
 political frictions among its three members-Lon
 Nol, Republican Party head Sirik Matak, and
 former chief tf state Cheng Heng. In recognition
 of the need to maintain some sort of high-level
 advisory body, however, Lon Nol subsequently
 es.ablished an "executive council." Besides the
 President, the new council consists of Matak,
 Prime Minister Long Boret, and Cambodian Army
 chief General Fernandez. The inc!usion of the last
 two will allow the principal executors of gov-
 ernment policy to participate more erfectively in
 its formulation. Although Matak is likely to be
 pleased at the prospect of having morn responsi-
 bility, he is certain to remain sensitive to any
 efforts by Lon Nol to impose his will on the

 After nearly six months of mostly lackluster
 civilian rule in Bangkok, the first signs of restive-
 ness among the Thai military have begun to
 appear. Earlier attempts to develop a democratic
 system of government have almost invariably
 foundered for lack of strong leadership and have
 resulted in military coups. From the moment that
 Thanom Kittikachorn's military regime collapsed
 last October and he was replaced by civilians,
 local observers have been speculating as to how
 long the military, in control for most of the past
 40 years, would allow "democracy" to last this
 time.
 Krit apparently wishes to rain a
 larger political  role for the military, perhaps
 through the appointment of several top officers
 to the cabinet. Krit claims that it is becoming
 increasingly difficult to restrain his key troop
 comm iders, who are pressing for the reassertion
 of a strong military hand in running the country.
 For L"9 moment at least, Sanya appears to
 have rejected Krit's advice. On March 31 he issued
 a statement denying that the government would
 resign or that the cabinet would be reshuffled. He
 announced, however, that he was bringing four
 senior statesmen into the government as advisers
 to the prime minister, including former foreign
 minister Thanat  Khoman : d economist Puai
 Ungphakori. Sanya may hope that bringing the
 outspoken Than it and the capable Puai into Vie
 qovernment will enhance its image, if not its per-
 formance, until elections can be held later in tyre
 year.
 Krit's approach to Sanya-if it indeed took
 place-may have been simply a gesture aimed at
 keeping the troop commanders in line for the  25X1
 time being. Whatever his aims, Krit lacked the
 crucial support of the KinS. Krit, who has politi-
 cal ambitions of his own, remains skeptical of the
 durability of democracy in Thailand.

 Both British and French leaders played to
 opinion at home in their presentatirns at this
 week's EC Council meetings in Luxembourg. Paris
 made a concession only on US trade demands.
 The stiff positions of the two may preclude prog-
 ress for some time on almost all issues under
 consideration by the Nine. Over the next month,
 in any case, the attention of all the EC members
 is likely to be focused on the French elections.
 The initial reactions to Britain's tough tone
 in demanding new terms of membership in the EC
 have been generally negative, the prevailing senti-
 ment being that the implied ultimatum-better
 terms or UK withdrawal from the community-is
 not conducive to smooth negotiations. Britain's
 partners are virtually united against changes in the
 basic EC treaties. Concern over a serious clash
 between London and its partners is leading some
 officials of the Nine, especially from the sma;ler
 countries, to urge moderation and a matter-of-
 fact approach to Britain's stand. These officials
 take some comfort from London's pledge to con-
 tinue participation in community business while
 renegotiations are under way. They also hope that
 Britain's specific requests, when made, will prove
 amenable to compromises within existing EC
 structures and policies.
 Foreign Minister Jobert rioted pointedly,
 however, that applicant states had ample opportu-
 nity during the negotiations for membership to
 make their points of view known, and that it was
 necessary for the new members to adapt to com-
 munity  procedures. Jobert characterized as
 generally unacceptable the British intention to
 continue to participate in community activities
 while reserving the right to refuse further steps
 toward integr:.:on that would prejudge the re-
 negotiation issues.
 Italian  Foreign Minister  Moro disagreed
 entirely with Foreign Secretary Callaghan's state-
 ment except for its references to improving rela-
 tions with the US, and the Germans called on the
 British to relegate national interests to the back-
 ground.
 Britain and Fr-.ince took up positions at
 opposite ends of the spectrum of EC opinion over
 the extent to which consultations with the US
 should be a regular part of the Nine's political
 machinery. Callaghan told his EC colleagues that
 the UK would endorse the proposal for EC-Arab
 cooperadon if there were a continuous exchange
 of information on this project with the US.
 France refused to accept this condition, with the
 result that the UK reservation on EC-Arab co-
 operation remains in force.
 The distance between France and the other
 eight on a mechanism for consultation with the
 US may be less than is implied by their failure to
 agree on a procedure, however. The eight agree
 that consultations should be neither mandatory
 nor institutionalized as an organic part of the EC,
 but that they should be considered on a case-by-
 case basis. In addition, all EC members stressed
 the desirability of reciprocal US action in con-
 sulting on matters of common concern. What
 principally divides the eight from Paris is the
 point in the EC deliberations at which consul-
 tations with the US would be in order, with
 France hoping to keep the US at arm':. length for
 as long as possible.
 The EC took positive action only in the field
 of trade negotiations with the US. The foreign
 ministers-including the  French-agreed to
 improve the EC's offer of tariff reductions to
 compensate for the adverse effects on American
 exports of EC enlargement. Even the revised offer
 is still likely to fall short of Washington's de-
 mands, but it will probably meet the US deadline
 of May 1. Paris had insisted last November that
 the EC's offer on compensation at that time was  25X1
 "final," but apparently softened its position
 because  of recent US warnings of retalia-

 WESTERN EUROPE: AIRCRAFT TROUBLE
 The joint British, West German, and Italian
 project to develop a European Multirole Combat
 Aircraft (MRCA) continues to enc' unter delays,
 rising costs, and technological difficulties. The
 project is about six months behind schedule, and
 some of the more pessimistic European experts
 on the project speculate that the plane will never
 get beyond the prototype stage.
 Serious problems with the MRCA's engines
 have twice delayed plans for its first flight -now
 expected to take place in May or June. In Feb-
 ruary, British experts reported that most of the
 problems had been solved,
 over he
 ong errn, engine problems plus other difficulties
 with thr- airframe and avionics probably will cause
 the program to slide as much as two years. A
 decision to continue or terminate the program
 may rest on the results of this initial flight.
 The cost of the airplane already has far
 exceeded initial projections. The cost per aircraft
 was originally estimated at the equivalent of $2.5
 million.
 y the time it is scheduled to become
 operational-toward tl?.e end of the 1970s-the
 price may run as high as $22 million per aircraft.
 As a result, the West Germans and the
 Italians are seriously considering withdrawing
 from the project and have begun seeking aircraft
 elsewhere. The UK does not want to cancel the
 project, but budgetary constraints may force
 London to restrict its participation and reduce
 the number of planes it might purchase.
 The French suggested in March that the
 three participants scrap the project and join

 engined Dassault fighter aircraft which is sched-

 of ministers of the seven-nation Western Euro-
 pean Union reportedly will discuss the French
 proposal at a future meetinq.
 A similar French proposal several years ago
 was turned down by the British-West German-
 Italian consortium, and it is likely that Paris'
 current initiative will be rejected as well. A more
 likely alternative is that the countries involved
 will purchase less-expensive aircraft tailored for
 specific missions; West Germany and Italy have
 already expressed interest in this approach. Such
 aircra?` could include the US-built A-7 and F-4, as
 well as the Lockheed Lancer and the YF 16 and

 COMMUNISTS SEEKING OIL FOR AID
 The USSR and Eastern Europe are seeking
 more oil from the Middle East as well as increased
 cooperation with the national oil companies in
 producing countries. Eastern Europe is increasing
 its reliance on Middle Eastern oil-about one
 fourth of their imports is scheduled to come from
 Iran and the Arab producers this year.
 The USSR and Eastern Europe have pro-
 vide-] more than $1.4 billion of aid for the devel-
 opment of national oil industries in the less-devel-
 oped countries-almost half of which went to
 India and Iraq. Since 1969, the agreements in-
 creasingly stipulate repayment in oil. In February,
 Moscow was negotiating a contract with Iraq to
 accelerate development of the third and final
 stage of the North Rumaila oil field. This year,
 Romania extended the only new Communist aid
 for oil development-a $37 million credit for
 machinery and equipment to Argentina. More-
 over, Bucharest and Ecuador jointly announced
 plans for Romania to provide, probably on a
 commercial basis, technical services to Ecuador's
 petroleum sector.
 Although still less than 10 percent of total
 Soviet - East European aid undertakings in the
 Third World, oil development assistance in some
 countries has been a critical factor in establishing
 national oil industries. This was particularly true
 in India, where Communist assistance made pos-
 sible 50 percent of New Delhi's crude oil produc-
 tion and 60 percent of its refinery capacity. Iran's
 natural gas industry was encouraged by Soviet
 willingness to take gas, which had been largely
 burnt off in the past. Soviet-developed oil fields
 and a Czechoslovak-built refinery account for all
 of Syria's production capacity.
 The Communist countries have given aid to
 national oil industries in hopes of assuring a rauar-
 anteed oil supply for Eastern Europe, but this is
 not succeeding. In January, Iraq stopped oil ship-
 ments on Soviet account after Moscow refused to
 pay $17 per barrel, the price Baghdad was de-
 manding from Western  customers. Shipments
 under previous agreements apparently have re-
 sumed recently. Earlier Soviet plans to obtain as
 much as 300,000 barrels per day of Iraqi oil this
 year-three times the estimated 1973 level-may
 be scaled down. It also is doubtful that the two
 parties will agree to long-term deliveries at fixed
 prices. East European countries, often agreeing to
 pay the higher prices demanded for Middle East
 oil, nevertheless also had difficulty in buying oil
 this year. Libya, however, may become an im-
 portant supplier to Eastern Europe; agreements
 signed so far this year call for a doubling of oil
 exports.

 RESTRAINING THE CONSERVATIVES
 Senior party leaders are again warning neo-
 Stalinist zealots to fall into line with established
 party policy or face stern disciplinary measures.
 Some of the phrasing revives the question of
 Soviet intentions toward Yugoslavia, a rare occur-
 rence since Tito's rapprochement with Brezhnev
 hit full stride last fall.
 The warnings almost certainly reflect an
 emerging consensus in the leadership that conserv-
 ative elements are using Tito's drive to tighten
