 In doing battle with his opponents Deng was willing to trade concessions on
 policy for acquiescence on his personnel appointments. We believe the
 primary importance of power considerations over policy preferences-as
 demonstrated in the Hua-Deng quarrel-will continue to be the central
 theme of Chinese domestic politics.
 Nonetheless, this chronological account of Deng's defeat of his opponents
 provides few clues as to how well Deng's designated successors will be able
 to capitalize on his successes. We believe it would be wrong to conclude
 that Deng's ability to secure the top party and state posts for his followers
 means that he will be able to institutionalize a new political order in China.
 In our view, Deng's success in defeating Hua should not obscure the fact
 that their contest for power involved issues that were not resolved with
 Hua's defeat and that still set the parameters of Chinese domestic politics:
 ? How to gain and retain control of the key levers of power in the party,
 state, and military.
 ? How to justify the party's rule in face of growing public cynicism, past
 performance, rising economic expectations, and "de-Maoization."
 ? How to implement modernization without stimulating a breakdown in
 social order and a weakening of party control.
 In addressing these issues, Hua-representing ideological orthodoxy-
 appealed to deep conservative instincts in many of China's institutions,
 notably the military. He sought to solidify his power and maintain party le-
 gitimacy by emphasizing continuity with Mao's legacy, promoting rapid

 economic growth through personal sacrifice, and ensuring strict social
 control. He epitomized the concern of many over the threat wholesale
 modernization could pose to Chinese "socialism" and the credibility of the
 party's leadership. Hua, however, lacked the ability to translate his nascent
 support into political power by building a network of high-level supporters
 in the state, party, and military apparatus.
 Deng approached the core issues by seeking to capitalize on broad popular
 sentiment for undoing the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution and
 improving living standards. In attacking Hua, Deng enjoyed the unique
 advantage of operating in a political climate in which there was strong
 support for pragmatic policies rather than Maoist ideological exhortations.
 Thus, Deng sought to strengthen the party's appeal by promoting the party
 as an efficient agent of change, giving primacy to reforms that would
 improve living standards, and holding out the prospect of social and
 economic liberalization as a spur to productivity. Most importantly, he
 repeatedly outmaneuvered Hua in securing state and party positions for his
 own followers.
 The slow pace of Deng's efforts to unseat Hua and continuing compromises
 by the reformists on policy issues, however, suggest substantial reservoirs of
 resistance to the Dengists' approach. Deng's tactical adjustments subse-
 quent to Hua's downgrading, subtle challenges to the authority of his
 chosen successors, unanticipated tensions created by the drive toward
 modernization, and renewed fear over the credibility of the party's
 leadership all point to Deng's inability to resolve the core issues or to
 fundamentally alter the rules of the political game.
 On the eve of the 12th Party Congress, Deng's followers still face
 challenges from party and army conservatives who had looked earlier to
 Hua for leadership and who again are attacking basic elements of Deng's
 reformist policies. Ideologically orthodox leaders, for example, are criticiz-
 ing aspects of China's open-door policy, citing the potential dangers it poses
 to China's "socialist" system. We believe the persistence of such chal-
 lenges, despite the apparent political dominance of the Dengists since the
 fall of Hua, suggests that Deng's successors may have to operate within the
 confines of a collective leadership in which more cautious and conservative
 leaders will continue to exercise considerable influence.

 Leadership Politics
 in Post-Mao China:
 The Fall of Hua Guofeng
 0
 The struggle for power between party Chairman Hua
 Guofeng and Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping lasted
 five years. At first glance, it is difficult to imagine
 how the young, inexperienced Hua could have lasted
 that long against such a powerful adversary. The
 details of the conflict not only answer that question
 but illuminate the many forces at work in Chinese
 politics today and provide insights into how the post-
 Mao leadership contends for influence.
 Uneasy Heir
 Hua's chances for a successful tenure as party Chair-
 man were hampered from the outset by the highly
 factionalized state of the party in 1976 when he
 gained office and by the irregular manner of his
 elevation. He was not a core member of either of the
 two main factions-the radicals led by Mao's wife
 Jiang Qing and the moderates led by Zhou Enlai-
 although he was closer to the moderates. As a rela-
 tively obscure official in Mao Zedong's home province
 of Hunan, Hua had earned a reputation as a loyal but
 careful supporter of Mao's political initiatives and as
 a man of personal integrity. Like many minor provin-
 cial officials, he benefited from the turmoil of the
 Cultural Revolution, advancing rapidly as cadres
 above him were purged. He was transferred to Beijing
 in 1971 and in 1973 became a full member of the
 Politburo, with responsibility for such key policy areas
 as agriculture and public security. He had some
 agricultural expertise, but his selection as Minister of
 Public Security in 1973 seems more a reflection of his
 acceptability to mutually hostile factions than any-
 thing else.
 Following the death of Premier Zhou Enlai in Janu-
 ary 1976, the Politburo was deadlocked over the
 choice between Deng Xiaoping and the radical Zhang
 Chunqiao as Zhou's successor. Mao finally "recom-
 mended" that Hua serve as "acting Premier." Deng
 subsequently came under increasing criticism, culmi-
 nating in his suspension from duty after the anti-
 regime riots in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in April
 1976. At the same meeting that ousted Deng, the
 Politburo approved Mao's "recommendation" that
 Hua be officially designated Premier and "First Vice
 Chairman" of the party.' Hua's rise, then, was essen-
 tially a result of Deng's fall; although acceptable to
 both factions as a compromise candidate, Hua lacked
 the support of either
 Mao's death on 9 September 1976 allowed the moder-
 ates to move against the Gang of Four, who were
 arrested with Hua's backing on 8 October. At a
 hastily convened meeting of the surviving members of
 the Politburo, Hua was named party Chairman. All
 were determined to end the traumatic events of the
 preceding months, to prevent further confusion and
 struggle for the chairmanship, and to attempt to lay
 the foundations for a period of political stability and
 continuity.
 the People's Liberation Army      quickly
 began to organize mass support for Hua through its
 propaganda mechanisms. Party media soon followed
 suit.
 Both the senior party leaders and Hua himself saw his
 role, at least in part, as a symbol of continuity, and a
 personality cult was created around him modeled
 after Mao's. Hua exchanged his proletarian brush-cut
 hairstyle for the combed-back Mao look and traveled
 about the countryside, dispensing his rather ordinary
 calligraphy and bland inscriptions in the style of his

 Thought, and worthy successor to Chairman Mao."
 best, and, despite his impressive titles, he was a junior
 member of the leadership. Limited reporting leads us
 to believe Hua was rather passive in party councils
 and deferred to others. He attempted to act as a
 spokesman for the consensus and was cautious in
 expressing his own views.
 Deng Xiaoping was the preeminent leader-and the
 choice of many for the party chairmanship-but he
 still was technically in disgrace. Rehabilitating him
 presented a complex and delicate task involving the
 rescinding of a Politburo order, an instruction from
 Mao, and several Central Directives. Moreover, it had
 to be handled in such a way as not to discredit Mao
 and not to strain unduly the delicate unity of the new
 leadership.
 We believe Hua viewed Deng's return with apprehen-
 sion and was unsure how best to deal with this implicit
 threat to his authority. Initially he tried to stay above

 Through the end of 1977, both Deng and Hua took
 pains to assure all observers there was no conflict
 between them. Deng declared that he desired nothing
 more than to be "Chairman Hua's good assistant,"
 although it is unlikely that Hua took such sentiments
 at face value. Neither man apparently felt the time
 was right for a showdown. As the creature of other
 senior Politburo leaders, Hua exercised little power in
 his own right and in our view seemed primarily
 concerned with establishing his legitimacy. Deng's
 statements and activities after his rehabilitation lead
 us to conclude that he was more interested in consoli-

 restoring his power contacts than in contending for
 Hua played the role to the hilt, not only because the
 wearing of Mao's mantle enhanced his own uncertain
 prestige, but because in our view he and the rest of the
 Politburo believed China was best served by the
 continuation of the political principles set down by
 Mao. The apogee of this movement came in April
 1977, with the publication of Volume V of Mao's
 Selected Works (with a preface by Hua), the opening
 of the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall (bearing an in-
 scription by Hua) in Tiananmen Square by Hua, and
 the popularization of several fanciful paintings show-

 The Growing Rift
 By early 1978 it was no longer possible for both men
 to paper over their disagreement on a number of
 policy issues. Because of his strong interest in achiev-
 ing concrete results, Deng demanded in his speeches
 and statements that policies be based on a flexible,
 realistic ideology of "seeking truth from facts." This
 conflicted with Hua's desire-and need-to maintain
 an orthodox Maoist course. Hua's approach to the
 legacy of Mao was summarized in an editorial, pub-
 lished in China's three leading journals in February
 1977, that stated: "We must resolutely uphold what-
 ever policy decision Chairman Mao made and un-
 swervingly carry out whatever Chairman Mao in-
 structed." According to recently released party
 materials, Deng disputed this interpretation even be-
 fore he was rehabilitated and continued to criticize
 the "two whatevers" as an obstacle to the adoption of
 effective measures to promote China's modernization.
 Also early in 1978, Deng began to move against the
 so-called little Gang of Four. They were Politburo

 government and provincial party officials to examine
 their modernization plans and try to accomplish them
 in 10 to 15 years, rather than the 23 years proposed in
 1977. We believe there was an immediate and proba-
 bly unanimous negative response, particularly from
 seasoned economic leaders such as party Vice Chair-
 man Li Xiannian, but Hua persisted in promoting
 unrealistic goals until the end of 1978, damaging
 rather than enhancing his image in the process]
 Deng Takes Charge, Hua Retreats
 The 3rd Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, held
 in late December 1978, saw major gains for Deng and
 marked the beginning of the end for Hua. Among the
 meeting's public accomplishments were:
 Yaobang-to the Politburo.
 A decision to shift the party's "general line" from
 "class struggle" to economic modernization.
 The addition of two Deng allies-Chen Yun and Hu
 Creation of a Discipline Inspection Commission to
 monitor cadre compliance with central orders.
 The exoneration of a large number of old cadres
 (some deceased) purged in the Cultural Revolution.
 Partial approval of Deng's campaign to change
 Maoist ideology.
 Deng appeared at the peak of his power in late 1978
 and early 1979, but policy problems soon brought him
 under sharp attack from several quarters in the
 Politburo.                            he mixed
 results of the war with Vietnam, continued economic
 problems, and the increasing virulence of poster at-
 tacks on Mao and the party at "Democracy Wall"
 were used as ammunition to assail Deng's leadership.
 We believe his handling of the normalization accords
 with the United States the previous year and the
 Taiwan Relations Act may also have been at issue.
 Hua, while no doubt grateful that someone else was
 being held responsible for policy errors did not openly
 lend his weight to the criticisms
 Angered by the attacks against him, Deng stepped up
 his own campaign against leftism in China and
 brought more pressure to bear on key Politburo
 opponents. Prior to and during the National People's
 Congress (NPC) session of June 1979, wallposters
 went up denouncing Wang Dongxing for financial
 malfeasance and corruption.

 Perhaps buoyed by his own gains, Deng seemed

 once again took pains in his public statements to
 dispe         serious differences between the two
 men.
 By late 1979, Hua and Deng seemed to have worked
 out a modus vivendi. In conversations with foreign
 visitors, Chinese officials portrayed the relationship as
 sound and based on mutual respect. Some Chinese
 officials did see, however, serious disagreement brew-
 ing over how to handle the remaining leftists in the
 Politburo: Deng's public and private comments sug-
 gested he wanted them all sacked, whereas Hua,
 supported by Ye Jianying, urged moderation in the
 interest of stability and unit

 The Search for New Successors
 Outward signs to the contrary, we believe Deng in
 fact was maneuvering to advance his plans for succes-
 sion and party reorganization, which did not include
 Hua. The 5th Plenum, held in 1980, was touted
 correctly by Chinese media as the consolidation of the
 "organizational line" of the party and dealt a major
 blow to Hua's long-term leadership prospects:

 ing degrees to the Maoist status quo-were left very
 much on the defensive.
 ? The establishment of the Central Committee Secre-
 tariat, invested with important decisionmaking and
 enforcement powers, isolated Hua and other Polit-
 buro members from direct access to the party
 bureaucracy. Hu Yaobang's accession to the posi-
 tion of General Secretary of the party also created
 an alternative to the authority of the chairmanship
 and gave Hu control over important political
 resources.
 ? The rehabilitation of Liu Shaoqi, the criticism of
 lifetime tenure for party cadres, and the heightened
 attacks on the personality cult-all approved by the
 plenum-challenged Hua's legitimacy by publicly
 calling into question Mao's judgment in his later
 years and the legality of one individual passing high
 office on to another.
 Hua suffered another setback in April 1980, when
 Deng announced that Zhao Ziyang had been appoint-
 ed "executive Vice Premier" of the State Council in
 charge of its "day-to-day" work. Zhao's increased
 prominence, Deng's public declaration that he would
 soon resign his own Vice Premiership in the interest of
 separating party and government, and an active ru-
 mor mill denigrating Hua's reputation led to predic-
 tions that Hua would step down as Premier at the
 NPC session to be held in late summer.

 Hua also was weakened by the decreased activity of
 Ye Jianying, his strongest supporter from the outset.
 Because of declining health and criticism from some
 quarters for his extravagant lifestyle, we believe Ye's
 influence-although still considerable-began to di-
 minish, and he spent less time in Beijing.
 Hua Looks to the PLA
 Faced with an emerging and unfriendly majority in
 both the party and the government, Hua turned to the
 military for support. The PLA had its own reserva-
 tions about Deng's reform policies. Some were cen-
 tered on economic policy: the readjustment program
 cut deeply into military industries and clouded pros-
 pects for defense modernization; agricultural reform
 policies tended to penalize soldiers' families; job pros-
 pects for demobilized soldiers were diminished. Some
 doubts were political or ideological: reverence for Mao

 Although warmly received by the conservative mili-
 tary cadres, Hua's speech was not welcomed by
 economic and ideological reformers associated with
 Deng. The fact that the speech went unreported in the
 Deng-controlled media for more than a week, and was
 printed thereafter only in excerpt form, attests to its
 controversial nature. Soon afterwards, articles in Peo-
 ple's Daily and Guangming Ribao came to the de-
 fense of material incentives and accused unnamed
 critics of being shortsighted.
 In late June, as articles continued an oblique attack
 on his ideas, Hua made a sudden, but well-publicized
 inspection trip to Liaoning, where he appeared fre-
 quently in the company of Shenyang Military Region
 Commander Li Desheng. This action leads us to
 believe that Hua was seeking support from one of the
 most prominent-not to mention, few remaining-
 military leaders with a distinct leftist orientation.
 If Li did offer support, it was of little value to Huan

 Ye Jianying, one of Hua's
 staunchest supporters on the
 runs deep in the PLA, and Deng's campaign to
 denigrate Mao was resented; some military leaders
 also were suspicious of policies that seemed to "liber-
 alize" society; the weakening of social control mecha-
 nisms diminished the prestige of both the party and
 the military establishment by exposing them to criti-
 The official justification for Hua's resignation-a
 desire to separate party and government-was hardly
 plausible under the circumstances, and many party
 members in conversations with colleagues and for-
 eigners described it as an attempt to mask a complex
 political struggle. In any case, we believe Hua's turn
 to the PLA was the last straw insofar as Deng was
 cism and satire from disaffected youth and writers. concerned.
 In early 1980 Hua began to associate himself more
 openly with the PLA and its concerns, visiting mili-
 tary units and listening to soldiers' problems. Hua
 made a particularly bold bid for support at the All-
 Army Political Work Conference of April 1980,
 where his report to the assembled commissars proba-
 bly was intended to stress the importance of doing
 good ideological work in the Army to maintain its
 support for party policies. Hua, however, also enjoined
 the Army to resist "bourgeois ideology" and other
 incorrect ideas, and he cited as examples of the latter
 an overemphasis upon material rewards and economic
 means for promoting "socialist" modernization.
 Even before the NPC session convened to approve
 Hua's resignation as Premier, rumors arose that Hua
 also would be removed as party Chairman at the 12th
 Party Congress (then expected to be held in late 1980
 or early 1981). Party officials made some attempts to
 deny these stories, but political tensions were clearly
 growing. Party media attacked the prevalence of
 feudal ideology in China, in apparent rebuttal to
 Hua's warnings about bourgeois thinking. Criticisms
 also appeared against the advocates of heavy industry

 in the leadership, the so-called petroleum faction who
 were accused of using military tactics and slogans to
 solve economic problems-an approach close to
 Hua's. Attacks on Mao also escalated, with Hu
 Yaobang, Li Xiannian, and Deng all making public
 statements critical of Mao and the Cultural Revolu-
 tion and implicitly questioning his judgment in his
 final years.'
 Although details of the Standing Committee meeting
 are not available, we believe that Deng was supported
 by Chen Yun, Hu Yaobang, and Zhao Ziyang. Ye
 Jianying probably defended Hua, and Li Xiannian-
 under fire himself for economic mistakes-probably
 tried to remain neutral.
 Political infighting increased after the September
 NPC meeting as serious problems confronted the
 regime in rapid succession, forcing disagreements into
 the open. Poor economic performance-as evidenced
 by inflation, unemployment, and deficit spending-
 led to arguments in the media over causes and cures
 between reformers (associated with Deng and Chen
 Yun) and more traditional Marxist economists. The
 trial of the Gang of Four in December contributed to
 the heated atmosphere by exposing the party to Jiang
 Qing's publicly reported denunciations and by incul-
 pating Mao and other senior leaders-especially
 Hua-in the Gang's misdeeds. The party draft assess-
 ment on Mao and related ideological questions led to
 heated arguments as did issues relating to dissident
 literature and freedom to criticize the party. We
 believe that on nearly all these questions Hua and
 Deng were at odds.

 The Showdown
 We believe Deng became so frustrated with Hua's
 continued opposition that he advanced his timetable
 for Hua's removal and took the issue to the Politburo
 Standing Committee for resolution.

 Hua may have tried one last gambit to capitalize on
 the discontent over his ouster. Although suspended
 from substantive duties such as presiding over Polit-
 buro Standing Committee meetings, Hua was still
 expected to perform ceremonial duties as party Chair-
 man. One of these was to preside over the traditional
 New Year's Day tea party in Beijing. As Hong Kong
 media reported the story, Hua backed out of his
 commitment at the last moment, pleading illness. Hu
 Yaobang visited him to try and persuade him to
 reconsider, but Hua refused, and Hu himself presided
 at the celebration and delivered an impromptu ad-
 dress. Hua's petulance backfired, and his attempt to
 embarrass Deng and Hu in public apparently lost
 rather than gained support from party members. 1

 The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History
 of our Party," adopted by the 6th Plenum, dealt
 rather harshly with Hua. Although crediting him with
 contributing to the overthrow of the Gang of Four and
 doing "some useful work," it pointedly criticized his
 leftist ideological outlook and dogmatic promotion of
 Maoist ideas, his obstruction of the rehabilitation
 process for old cadres wronged by Mao, his attempt to
 form a personality cult, and his advocacy of impetu-
 ous economic policies. The Resolution concluded that,
 if Hua were to continue in office, the correction of
 past ideological errors and the restoration of party
 prestige would be "impossible." Subsequent press and
 party guidance on the Resolution further detailed
 Hua's mistakes and expanded the scope of criticism,
 even casting some doubt on his personal integrity
 (once considered one of his strong points).
