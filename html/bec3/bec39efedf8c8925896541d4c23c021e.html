INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM 
Some Reflections on Mao  
1. Any assessment of Mao Tse-tung begins with 
the obvious: he is a charismatic leader who has 
dominated nearly the entire history of Chinese Com-
munism and who views the Chinese revolution as his 
own creation. One cf the original founders of the 
Chinese Communist Party in 1921, Mao has been its 
sole chairman since 3935. He has guided all impor-
tant aZfairs of state since the founding of the Peo-
ple's Republic in 1949. At 
78, Mao can look back on a 
career in Caich he has been 
the Chinese Communists' 
principal ideologist, po-
litical organizer, military 
leader, and government 
chief. Mao clearly con-
siders himself a world 
historical figure, both in 
the Chinese context and in 
that of the Coomunist move-
ment, where the Chinese 
claim that Mao ranks in 
the pantheon of Communist 
immortals on a par with 
Marx, Engels, Lenin, and 
Stalin. 
2. Mao is, in a sense, 
a philosopher-statesman 
whose "thought," in his 
view, embodies the aspira-
tions of the majority of

Current Intelligence and coordinated with the Office

the people and provides China with a sure guide to 
national greatness. But Mao is also a hard-bitten 
politician constantly preoccupied with military, po-
litical, and economic realities not always easily 
reconciled with the major tenets of his ideology--
and with his own political survival as well. 
3. For most of his tenure as a revolutionary 
and national leader, Mao has been able to stay on 
top and to adapt his vision of what China ought to 
be to objective circumstances. Since the 1958-60 
Great Leap Forward era, the policies with which Mao 
has been most closely identified have in many ways 
hindered China's transformation into a modern in-
dustrial state, and his own power interests and 
ideological predilections have often proved a major 
disunifying factor in Chinese politics. It i6 
therefore possible tha' many of his ideas may not 
long survive him. Paradoxically, however, the lives 
of the Chinese people have been bound up with Mao's 
revolutionary vision for 22 years, and in a basic 
sense, no one can really replace him. 
Mao's Self-Portrait  
4. In his December 1970 interview with Amer-
ican journalist Edgar Snow, Mao characterized him-
self as essentially a simple man who wished not to 
be remembered as China's "Great Leader, Great Helms-
man" but rather as the "Great Teacher." This self-
assessment is less humble than it sounds. By arro-
gating to himself the title of the nation's "teacher," 
Mao is asserting that he knows better than any of his 
compatriots the path China should follow to achieve 
both the goals of national power and the "Maoist" 
vision of the good society--a selfless collectivity 
which will eventually surpass the advanced West with-
out losing egalitarianism and revolutionary elan. 
His Political Style  
5. We have some evidence of how Mao conducts 
himself from reports on small informal party meet-
ings prior to and during the Cultural Revolution.

--rryisrprrn444a 
These gatherings were, and presumably still are, 
the main arena of decision-making in China. Mao's 
talks frequently betrayed a didactic approach and 
a condescending air. Deliberately, he projected 
an image of a passionate, slightly humble, earthy, 
irascible, and shrewd man. As a good "teacher," 
Mao would often say that his "student-colleagues" 
could correct him if he were 'wrong. From what we 
know of such meetings, they were freewheeling, with 
hiuch blunt talk and ample policy debate in which 
opposition to Mao's view was indeed expressed, al-
though rarely in terms personally insulting to Mao. 
6. Nevertheless, Mao played more than the role 
of teacher and sometime pupil. His presence was in-
timidating, and he was a formidable adversary, fight-
ing cleverly and hard. Often he would employ sardonic 
humor and invective drawing on the strengths and weak-
nesses, past and present, of his colleagues. On the 
whole, the record shows Mao as a master of attack, 
retreat, and counterattack--in effect, a guerrilla 
strategist--in party debates. In addition to the 
forcefulness of his personality, Mao used various 
stratagems: manipulating rivalries among his asso-
ciates, attacking his enemies when he was politically 
secure, calling for his comrades to unite in a common 
cause when he was weak, and even threatening to with-
draw from the political system to build a new revolu-
tionary movement. 
7. Thus, in inner-party circles Mao brought 
his will to bear not merely as an elevated "teacher" 
but as a political antagonist ready to confront his 
colleagues and to intervene actively in day-to-day 
decision-making. Although in December 1970 Mao told 
Snow that he formulates policy guide2ines and issues 
general directives leaving the details cf execution 
to others, it is likely that he still frequently in-
terjects himself into the daily political process and 
attempts to exercise his personal authority in carry-
ing out given programs.

The Cult of  Mao 
8. A further illustration of Mao's personality 
and his political style is the manner in which he 
has employed his doctrine--"Mao Tse-tung Thought"--
and its attendant personality cult. As Mao has aged, 
he has been increasingly deified. In his 1970 con-
versation with Snow, Mao deplored the slogans and 
other forms of worship carried to excess by the Red 
Guards. He said there should be a cooling down. 
But Mao acknowledged that, because a great deal of 
party power had been out of his control in the early 
1960s, he had deliberately fostered the personality 
cult in order to stimulate the masses to dismantle 
the "anti-Mao" party bureaucracy. In short, Mao not 
only uses his personality cult as a device for en-
suring his political survival but in effect claims 
that he does personify the unity and hopes of the na-
tion. 
The Maoist Vision  
9. Mao's "thought," about which the Chinese 
speak so often, is a complex thing. Somewhere in 
tha "collected works" is a passage suitable to sup-
rt any cjiven policy. It is often contradicted by 
another passage. Certain recurring themes, however, 
do s;:and out. In general, Mao sees all social proc-
esses in terms of struggle, conflict, and combat. 
The concept of the law of contradictions--the dia-
lectical struggle between antithetical forces--is 
one to which he has given special emphasis. Mao 
sees China as progressing to its rightful place in 
the world by struggling constantly against its ene-
mies abroad, and progressing toward ideal communism 
by struggling constantly against enemies within. He 
seems to feel that progress stops when struggle ends, 
and he is suspicious of the motives of those who 
appeal for periods of internal peace and social har-
mony. Thus, ever since achieving power Mao has at-
tempted--when the traffic would bear--to contrive 
conditions of tension and struggle in order to create 
the type of man, preserve the sort of values, and 
promote the processes that are essential for con-
tinuing revolution.

10. Maoism also lays heavy stress on the crucial 
role of subjective factors in history, the role of 
the individual human will as a force capable of re-
shaping the material, objective environment. This 
attitude is obviously linked to Mao's guerrilla ex-
perience and to his conviction that men, not weapons, 
are the decisive factor in revolutionary war. Sub-
jective emphasis carries over into Mao's prescriptions 
for modernizing China and is expressed in his almost 
mystical faith that China's mobilized masses can 
transform their world through collective, labor-
intensive action. This also happens to be convenient 
theory for an underdeveloped, over-populated nation 
unable to motivate its people with substantial ma-
terialrewards,and Mao implicitly acknowledged as 
much some years ago when he declared the fact that 
China was "poor and blank" was a revolutionary virtue. 
11. These factors have led Mao to place a high 
value on ideological motivation--the "spiritual trans-
formation" of men. In Mao's ultimate vision, the 
good society is one united by something approaching 
total consensus and marked by radical collectivism. 
To oversimplify, men will be "freer" because they 
have submerged their individual selfishness in a kind 
of mystical collectivism. To achieve this internalized 
consensus, however, blind obedience is not enough. 
Instead, the spiritual transformation of the entire 
Chinese people is to take place through the study of 
Mao's works, thought reform, and education through 
labor. 
12. This emphasis on spiritual transformation 
is closely linked to a populist theme in Mao's 
"thought." For him, the masses of peasants and 
workers are the repository of the wisdom and inge-
nuity which will enable China to forge ahead in its 
economic and technical development without heavy re-
liance on specialists steeped in foreign knowledge 
and foreign theories (concessions being made in the 
fields of nuclear technology and advanced weaponry). 
In fact, in Mao's "thought" there is a definite anti-
intellectual bias and a fear that a bureaucratic and

Approved for Release 2018/08/29 002913946 
C 0 N ri) -A -  
technical elite will undermine his populist revolution. 
This element of his vision was a major factor in Mao's 
effort during the Cultural Revolution to undo bu-
reaucratic stratification by destroying respect for 
the special status of the party member or the special 
knowledge of the expert. The Cultural Revolution 
was a failure from most points of view, but Mao does 
not discourage easily and it may happen again. 
13. Although Mao's emotional commitment to the 
idea of continuing revolution is strong, he realizes 
that everything is not possible at a given time and 
that one must therefore distinguish between stages. 
Although he may find it increasingly distasteful as 
he grows older, Mao has certainly been known to com-
promise in both domestic and foreign policy when he 
finds it in his interest to do so. His imprimatur 
on the recent developments in Sino-US :c.lations, for 
example, shows that he can subordinate ideological 
considerations to the 1.,?.ed for a flexible diplomatic 
posture, in hopes of turning China's weakness into a 
strength in the triangular Sino-Soviet-US relationship. 
There is also no sign that Mao has lost his philosophic 
capacity to take the long view of China's destiny. 
His sardonic comment to Premier Kosygin in 1969 that 
Sino-Soviet polemics would be carried on for 10,000 
years if necessary conveys Mao's sense that history 
will favor China, that "good" will triumph over 
"evil." 
Mao's Current Role  
14. Mao remains the dominant political figure 
in Peking. Major changes in policy and personnel 
assignments require his approval, and no individual 
leader or combination of leaders appears able, or 
anxious, to overthrow him. But this is not the whole 
story. We now know, for example, that Mao's control 
over party affairs was seriously weakened in the 
early 1960s, and that he felt threatened prier to the 
Cultural Revolution because other leaders began to 
doubt the validity of his prescription for building 
a selfless and classless China.

(b)(3) 
15. Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to 
remove his dissident "revisionist" colleagues from 
power in the party, government, and military. In 
the process, he undermined the authority of the 
party, sat himself above the party as the incarnation 
of the will of the Chinese people, and came to rely 
on a small personal entourage of radical advisers. 
16. Mao's victory over his opponents was signif-
icant but far from complete. He intimated as much to 
Edgar Snow in December 1970 in acknowledging that the 
Cultural Revolution still continued in the form of 
the struggle for power at the national level. The 
struggle had been dramatically illustrated only a 
few months earlier by the purge of one of Mao's closest 
advisers, the radical Chen Po-ta. At the same time, 
Mao also indirectly admitted that he had serious res-
ervations about the success of the Cultural Revolu-
tion, particularly as it applied to the upper levels 
of the bureaucracy. This odd refusal to claim success 
suggests that Mao may feel that not all of those hold-
ing the principal levers of power in the country today 
are entirely responsive to him. 
17. The general failure of the Cultural Revolu-
tion has been underscored by the upheavals in China's 
leadership since the "revolution" was formally declared 
to be over at the Ninth Party Congress in April 1969. 
A considerable amount of maneuvering and purging has 
occurred within the 25-member politburo formed at that 
congress. About 11 members seem to have been shunted 
aside, although a few of these may eventually resur-
face. Some of the purges have involved relatively 
moderate civilian and military figures who were on 
record as opposing Maoist excesses in the Cultural 
Revolution, and their political demise may well have 
been instigated by Mao. But other victims, including 
Mao's chosen successor, Defense Minister Lin Piao, 
were in a broad sense members of Mao's entourage. It 
is possible that Mao--who has consistently recognized 
the necessity of periods of consolidation after up-
surges of radical change--decided to sacrifice his 
-7-

-0:711-11-D-ENTIAL._ 
closest colleagues because their usefulness to him 
was over. Nevertheless, the downfall of these men 
has diminished Mao's prestige and may increase his 
own vulnerability to a later attack. 
18. In short, Mao--for all his deification--is 
a political animal working amid shifting political 
sands to enhance his own power and make his will 
felt. For example, following the Cultural Revolution, 
Mao attempted to ensure his supremacy by rewriting 
China's party and state constitutions. Both the party 
constitution approved at the Ninth Congress in 1969 
and a draft ritate constitution drawn up in 1970 speci-
fied Mao's role as the personal ruler of the nation 
and, for the first time in any Communist constitution, 
named his successor. The latter provision, by denying 
the party its right to choose the next chairman, pro-
vided the ultimate proof of Mao's contempt for the 
party. 
19. Events since tho drafting of the two new 
constitutions, howeve.,� suggest that there has been 
strong resistance to Mao's hostility to the party. 
The draft state constitution has not yet been ap-
proved, Mao's personal heir has been purged, and 
there have been clandestine reports that there is 
strong sentiment in Peking for some formula for a 
"colleotive leadership" as the best device for 
handling the succession to Mao and, at least 
implicitly, for restoring the legitimacy of the 
party. 
20. The present drive to restore the party 
organization is almost certainly in part designed 
to reduce the excessive authority which the military 
acquired in civil administration as a result of the 
Cultural Revolution. As such, it may we'l have Mao's 
personal endorsement. He is, in fact, on record as 
early as 1967 in favor of a properly revitalized 
civilian party as a political instrument. Neverthe-
less, the current propaganda emphasis on the party 
does not depict it merely as an instrument of Mao'  
will. Indeed, 
-8-
ClircrrettiE4Nu-Lea,�:  
_Approved for Release: 2018/08/29 CO2913946 
Approved for Release: 2018/08/29 CO2913946 
some cadres abroad were told to note that recent 
propaganda formulations on the role of the party 
designated Mao as "comrade Mao" rather than the 
more usual "Chairman Mao." 
21. Even if it is assumed that Mao is not an 
all-powerful autocrat, we believe it would be a 
serious mistake to deny that he is still the man who 
makes the ultimate decisions in all key areas of 
China's domestic and foreign policy. Chou En-lai 
may be the chief architect of present Chinese policy 
toward the US, but his blueprint must have Mao's 
approval. Mao is a consummate politician who, if 
unable to hlve his way in all matters, is still able 
to retain considerable leverage by playing off op-
posing groups against one another. Indeed, much of 
the leadership uncertainty in Peking today may stem 
from Mao's devotion to this tactic, which avoids the 
risks of provoking any direct challenge to his pre-
eminence. 
A Final Word: Mao's Health 
22. A major problem in assessing Mao's polit-
ical situation is that we do not have an accurate 
reading on his health. Rumors in recent years that 
he is in poor health have not proved accurate, and 
we have serious reservations about diagnoses at long 
distance. Eyewitness accounts vary widely. In every 
public appearance he has made over the past two years, 
observers have described Mao as frail and tired 
looking. 
23. On the other hand, Mao has given at least 
five personal interviews ove_ the past two years 
ranging from one and one half hours to five hours. 
His interlocutors have all commented that he appeared 
well briefed and well informed, that his mental 
faculties appeared normal, and that his reactions 
were lively. In some of the interviews, he showed 
some preoccupation with mortality, but this is prob-

than to morbidity or mental deterioration. He oc-
casionally treats the subject of death with sardonic 
humor, as when he told Prince Sihanouk that he, Mao, 
"might soon be called to heavenly peace," adding 
with a laugh "for discussions only." 
24. It seems reasonable to assume that Mao has 
his good days and bad day q and that his working 
schedule must be carefully regulated. Mao may not 
read as many position papers as he once did, and 
he may no longer be able to devote considerable 
energy to retaining control of the bureaucracy and 
keeping himself informed Past experience suggests, 
however, that it would be a serious mistake to under-
rate his physical capacity for action and decision-
making. After all, he launched the Cultural Revolu-
tion at the age of 72, at a time when reports were 
widely circulating that his good days were fewer 
and fewer and that he was near death. 
25. There has been a noticeable absence of 
references to Mao's "excellent health" in Peking 
propaganda in recent months. On the basis of past 
practice, this can be taken as a sign that his con-
dition is good and that the regime is not particu-
larly sensitive on this subject.
