 CHINA: Peking Posters on Teng
 Two posters appeared in Peking yesterday weZcom-
 ing the 11 central decision" to restore Teng Hsiao-ping to all
 the positions in the Chinese party, government,  and military
 that he held before his ouster in 1976. There has been no
 of- ficial announcement from Peking on such a decision, in contrast
 with the announcement last year of Teng's dismissal, and it is
 not clear that the posters have official approval. A public
 declaration of Teng's return would probably be greeted with a
 rash of posters throughout the city.
 25X1                          There are indications that party leaders are now
 meeting Fn-  Peking,  and. presumably Teng's status is high on the
 agenda.  It is possible, as one poster claimed, that Teng has
 been "nominated" to return to his original positions.
 On the other hand, the poster-writers may either be
 jumping the gun on what they expect the meeting to decide, or
 they may be trying to boost Teng's cause. As early as last Jan-
 uary, poster-writers in Peking put up apparently unauthorized
 posters calling for Teng's return and for his appointment as
 premier.
 It is possible that Teng will initially be re-
 stored  to   is original positions but that adjustments will be
 made during the course of the meetings.
 The Peking press this month has defended Teng in all
 respects, omitting only the use of his name. This transparent
 support for Teng, and especially a statement in People's Daily
 four days ago that he held his positions because of a decision
 by Mao, stops just short of publicly reinstating him to his
 former positions and may have prompted the posters.

 UK: Crucial Wage Policy Vote
 //Britain's Labor government will probably win a
 key vote today following a special parliamentary debate on its
 pay policy.     With the House of Commons adjourning later this
 month, Prime Minister Callaghan will enjoy a four-month respite
 from the rigors of keeping a minority government afloat.  But
 in the interim, the outcome of 17 major wage discussions will
 indicate whether the trade unions intend to make responsible
 wage demands and whether the government is determined to hold
 to its pay guidelines, which call for holding wage increases
 to an average of 10 percent. The results of this testing period,
 plus CaZZaghan's ability to deal with the miners' demand for a
 90-percent pay boost in November, will determine the Labor
 government's chances of avoiding an early election.//
 //The government's Liberal Party allies are dis-
 appoints   t at no formal pay agreement was reached with the
 Trades Union Congress and probably doubt Labor's ability to
 stick to its unilaterally declared policy. Even so, the likeli-
 hood that the Liberals'  already small parliamentary delegation
 would be decimated in a general election this summer will
 probably keep them from abandoning their pact with the govern-
 ment.//
 //Callaghan has also cultivated the support of
 o  er minor party members of Parliament. Ulster Unionist leader
 James Molyneaux recently declared that the days when the Union-
 ist automatically supported the Conservative Party are gone.
 In fact, most Unionists are prepared to support the Labor gov-
 ernment in a vote of confidence because of government conces-
 sions in the area of local autonomy and in boosting the number
 of Ulster's seats in Parliament.//
 //Labor's plans to resubmit home rule legislation
 tor Scotland and Wales in the next parliamentary session might
 lead some nationalist members of Parliament to abstain rather
 than vote against the government today.  The nationalists could
 be damaged politically if Callaghan is forced into an early
 election that results in a victory for an anti-devolution Tory
 government.//

 of the Trades Union Congress reaffirmed its position that pay
 settlements should be concluded only every 12 months. The com-

 powerful unions, such as the miners', to seek pay increases
 before their current one-year settlements expire.//

 SPAIN:  EC Membership Application
 //Spain may apply for full membership in the Euro-
 pean               ommun2 y next week.  Such a bid would enjoy wide domestic
 support.  Last month's parliamentary election went a Zong way
 toward satisfying EC members that Spain has forsworn Francoism,
 but attaining membership is bound to be protracted and diffi-
 cult.//
 //Foreign Minister Oreja told the US ambassador

 submission of an early application.  If,  as he believes likely,
 the cabinet approves his proposal, he will travel to Brussels
 next Wednesday to make the formal submission.//
 //Earlier this month Spain notified the EC that
 it would extend its 1971) preferential tariff agreement with
 the original six EC members to include the three newer members.
 Under this agreement, the six EC members gave preferential

 similar treatment by Spain to their industrial goods.  Final
 negotiations for the expanded agreement are expected to be
 completed by the end of the month pending settlement on agri-
 cultural quotas for exports to the EC.//

 established Spain's democratic credentials. Since the election,
 frustration over growing EC concern about the possible costs of
 Spanish membership has resulted in some muted threats from
 Spanish officials to withhold application, but the government
 last week reaffirmed its intention to make a bid soon. If the
 application is not made this month, it will probably come in
 September.//
 I               //Oreja, in any case, said he does not expect the
 EC Counci  of Ministers to agree to consider Spain's bid until
 September. He envisages negotiations beginning in mid-1978 and--
 while not minimizing the difficulties Spain would face--spoke
 optimistically of 1980 as a possible accession date. EC offi-
 cials, however, expect accession to be delayed for at least
 several more years. Both sides envision a six- to seven-year
 transition period after entry during which Spain would adjust
 to EC requirements.//
 //EC members, France and Italy in particular, will
 want sateguards against Spanish agricultural competition,  and
 some parts of the Community fear that Spain would be a dangerous
 competitor in such items as steel, shoes, and textiles.//
 //Spain's motives for wanting to join the EC are
 in large part political.  To many Spaniards EC membership repre-
 sents acceptance, after 40 years of isolation, in a modern,
 democratic Western Europe.//
 //The Spanish government's commitment to full EC
 membership seems firm, and in this it has the support of all
 major political groups including the Communists and Socialists.
 Opposition in Spain to EC membership comes mostly from xenophobic
 extremists on the left and right and from those businessmen
 afraid of more dynamic European industries.//
 //EC membership will mean severe problems for
 Spain ,s many inefficient producers who now are shielded by the
 country's high protective barriers. At the same time, however,
 it will allow some producers to lower costs by broadening their
 market. Given a sufficient transition period--possibly six
 years--Spanish firms should be able to adjust to the more com-
 petitive environment.

 Turkish Prime Minister - designate DemireZ has ap-
 parent y reached agreement with two small right-wing parties
 to reassemble the "nationalist front" government that held power
 prior to the country's recent parliamentary election. In a press
 statement yesterday, DemireZ,  leader of the Justice Party, im-
 plied that the coalition parties have apportioned ministerial
 portfolios and that only the relatively straightforward matter
 of matching names and positions remained to be addressed. He
 said he hoped to present a cabinet list to President Koruturk
 later today.
 If events flow as smoothly as Demirel hopes, Turkey
 cou     ave a government by the end of the month.  Despite his
 dislike of National Salvation Party leader Erbakan, who will
 be part of the coalition, Koruturk would have little reason not
 to approve Demirel's cabinet because the three parties in the
 coalition control a majority of seats in the lower house. After
 receiving presidential approval, the government would then have
 a week to publish its program, and parliamentary debate and a
 vote of confidence would ensue.
 The major sticking point during the two weeks of tough
 bargaining among Demirel, Erbakan, and Nationalist Action Party
 boss Turkes was Erbakan's demand that his party receive seven
 cabinet posts, reportedly including the education and interior
 ministries.  Demirel doubtless took exception to this demand at
 least initially,  for the National Salvation Party had the same
 number of posts in the first "front" government at a time when
 it controlled twice as many parliamentary votes.
 I          I When a cabinet list is published,  it is likely to
 snow    a   the Salvationists have largely gotten their way.  De-
 spite heavy election losses, Erbakan and his party still hold
 the balance of parliamentary power and the key to Demirel's
 becoming prime minister.
 I           Turkey's closely divided electorate will not greet
 the announcement of a Demirel government enthusiastically. Many
 in Turkey have reservationsabout the country being governed
 again by a coalition that during more than two and a half years
 in power proved largely incapable of focusing on the country's
 many problems.

 SUDAN: Negotiations Publicized
 Sudanese President Numayri is apparently success-
 u  y concluding his effort to win over conservative opposi-
 tion groups, especially the Ansar Islamic Sect and the Muslim
 Brotherhood.  Reconciling these groups would largely neutralize
 Libyan and Ethiopian attempts to use exiled Sudanese dissidents
 to undermine the Numayri government.
 I    I In a nationwide address Monday evening, Numayri dis-
 closed                     at he met with Sadiq al-Mahdi, exiled leader of the
 Ansar dissidents and a former prime minister,  in Port Sudan on
 July 6. Although he gave no details of his contacts with Sadiq
 and other opposition leaders, Numayri said he had achieved
 "great success" and expressed hope that a general agreement
 on national unity will result.
 Numayri released over 800 political detainees last
 weekend,  presumably as a consequence of his negotiations with
 opposition leaders. According to press reports from Khartoum,
 those released included Muslim Brotherhood leader Hasan al-
 Turabi and some followers of Husayn al-Hindi, another prominent
 opposition leader who   like Sadig,  has received Libyan and
 Ethiopian support. r7                           I

 return to work as a precondition for further negotiations.
 These actions hardened the resolve of professionals
 to continue their walkout. While some professional groups re-
 turned to work in Accra on Friday, lawyers, doctors, and phar-
 macists continued their strike. Medical services had become so
 inadequate that Acheampong appealed to the US, Britain, and
 Nigeria for doctors.
 //The government's decision to move up the date
 tor a return to civilian rule was made to buy itself time. Pub-
 lic reaction to the two-year transition proposal was not enthu-
 siastic, and Acheamponcr was worried that if the strike continued
 into the fall, university students would join in the efforts to
 unseat the government./'/
 //With the commitment to a one-year transition,
 Acneampong will probably be able--at least temporaril
 --to de-

 that the striking professionals will return to work, he may be
 able to reduce public resentment toward his regime.//                 25X1

 PORTUGAL: Agrarian Reform Bill
 I            The Socialist minority government in Portugal faces
 hard bargaining this week to secure approval of key agrarian
 reform legislation.  The Socialists are angling to obtain the
 support of the centrist Social Democrats,  since the conservative
 Center Democrats and the Communists have already announced their
 opposition to the bill. Prime Minister Soares told the US ambas-
 sador in Lisbon that he is confident he has                       the backing of
 President Eanes and will survive any challenges to his govern-
 ment.
 The Socialist proposal is designed to hand back land
 illegally seized during the revolution by Communist-led groups,
 but not to sacrifice the principle of land reform.  Under the
 Approved For 9
 Approved For
 legislation,  less land would be eligible for expropriation;
 owners whose land had been taken would be granted some compensa-
 tion and would have a limited right to ownership in parts of
 their former holdings.
 I           IThe Communists have the most to lose if the legisla-
 tion is passed. In rallies throughout the country last weekend,
 they promised to fight to prevent enactment of the law or to
 force basic amendments. The Communists can make trouble for the
 Socialists in the streets, but probably do not have the means
 to thwart government plans.
 I            IThe Center Democrats, the most conservative of the
 tour major parties, oppose the bill because it recognizes some
 expropriations and does not return all of the seized land. The
 party announced last weekend that it would no longer cooperate
 with the government on a case-by-case basis, but would support
 Soares only if the Socialists accepted an overall political
 agreement. Center Democratic leaders are claiming that defeat
 on the agrarian reform measures could bring down the government.
 I           IThe centrist Social Democrats are the Socialists' best
 hope tor allies to assure passage.  They appear to be bargaining
 for concessions from the Socialists on other issues. Most Social
 Democratic legislators probably agree with the Socialist approach
 to agrarian reform and believe the Communist influence needs to
 be diminished if the agricultural sector is to get back on its
 feet.
 I             Soares realizes that Social Democratic leader Sa Car-
 neiro cou d still change his party's stance. The Prime Minister
 is confident he will survive the vote, however, and has taken
 several actions to minimize the risks:
 --The government postponed a vote on its mid-term economic
 program until the fall session of the legislature to avoid
 more problems with the Social Democrats and Center Demo-
 crats. The Socialists might have had to turn to the Com-
 munists for support on the program and thereby weaken their
 efforts on agrarian reform.

 --The Socialist leaders are easing leftist dissidents out
 of the party in order to keep internal party problems from
 overshadowing the parliamentary battle. The Socialists re-
 portedly plan to announce that the dissidents are not being
 expelled but have cut themselves off from the party.
 --Some Socialists are saying that they are planning to re-
 organize the government in the fall and will probably in-
 clude some independents.
 I             IThe biggest factor in Soares'  favor continues to be
 e support of President Eanes, who has shown no sign of want-
 ing a change in government. Eanes has been holding long meetings
 with the opposition leaders this week to discuss legislative
 issues.

 I                   J Sri Lankan voters may continue their tradition
 o   voting out incumbent governments when Prime Minister Bandar-
 anaike's Zeft-of-center Sri Lanka Freedom Party stands for re-
 election tomorrow. Neither domestic nor foreign policies are
 likely to change radically over the short term regardless of
 which of the two major parties forms the next government.
 Voter dissatisfaction with the country's 20-percent
 unemployment rate and 10- to 20-percent inflation rate could
 result in a victory for the major opposition party, the more
 conservative United National Party led by J. R. Jayewardene.
 The National Party governed from 1965 to 1970, when it was
 overwhelmingly defeated at the polls.
 Leftists, angered by Bandaranaike's relatively moder-
 ate an  o ten antilabor economic policies, will probably vote
 for the United Left Front, a coalition of leftist groups that
 allied with Bandaranaike in the 1970 election but then split
 from her. A leftist protest vote would siphon votes from govern-
 ment candidates and increase the National Party's chances of
 winning the 85 seats it needs in the 168-member Assembly to
 form a majority government.
 I            IShould the National Party win less than 85 but more
 an 65 seats, it should still be able to form a coalition with
 the 20 candidates certain to be elected as representatives of
 the island's major ethnic minority group--the Tamils. The Free-
 dom Party would have more difficulty winning the support of
 Tamil representives, but could possibly patch together another
 leftist coalition by making substantial concessions to the left-
 ist parties.
 I     I Since its defeat in 1970, the United National Party
 has trie   to shed its image as a fiscally conservative party
 of the wealthy for a more moderate image. While the party would
 be unlikely to return the industries and tea estates nation-
 alized by Bandaranaike's-government to private control, it would
 not permit further nationalizations.

 The National Party's foreign policies might be more
 openly pro--West than those of the present government, which
 pursues a neutral policy. Jayewardene, however, would not com-
 mand the respect that Bandaranaike has been accorded within the
 nonaligned movement. Sri Lanka's moderating voice in Third World
 forums--particularly the Nonaligned and Law of the Sea confer-
 ences--could thus be muted.
 The party that wins tomorrow may have little influence
 on the   ong-term problem posed by the island's largely unemployed,
 locally educated, and increasingly disaffected youth.  The coterie
 of older, Western-educated politicians and businessmen that has
 dominated Sri Lanka's established political parties and the
 economy for years has been unable to inspire or even control the
 youth, who see the economy as stagnant, society as decaying, and
 the leadership as lethargic.
 J When Bandaranaike suspended the national assembly in
 February in order to avoid an embarassing no confidence vote,
 the state of emergency that had been in effect. since an insur-
 rection of young Sri Lankan radicals erupted in 1971 automati-
 cally lapsed. Most of the former insurgents have since been re-
 leased from jail and are busily reorganizing their supporters.
 The principal insurgent organization, the People's Liberation
 Front, is running candidates for 15 assembly seats.

 duction costs. The decree probably is a sop to labor, which
 has criticized the government's recent 20-percent devaluation
 of the peseta as inflationary.
 The price control measure lacks stiff guidelines and
 will be difficult to enforce. The government has yet to announce
 details of its economic program dealing with inflation, includ-
 ing statements on wage policy. credit expansion, and money sup-
 ply.
 Prime Minister Lynden Pindling and his Progressive Liberal
 Party appear headed for a substantial victory in yesterday's
 parliamentary election, the first since The Bahamas gained in-
 dependence four years ago. With more than 60 percent of the
 votes counted, Pindling's party was on the way to retaining 29
 seats--and could win more--in the 38-member House of Assembly.
