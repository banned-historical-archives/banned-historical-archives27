 The fighting continued undiminished yesterday in most areas of Lebanon,
 despite a cease-fire arranged on Monday by President Franjiyah and Syrian President
 Asad. Both leaders met yesterday with representatives of the warring factions,
 presumably in search of acceptable terms for a new truce.
 he truce called for lifting the blockade of the camps in exchange for an
 end of the siege of Damour and several other Christian cities south of Beirut. Press
 reports from Beirut last night said Muslim leftists and Palestinians had captured
 Damour and a nearby Christian village.
 The Palestinians and their Muslim and leftist allies objected to halting the
 fighting in the face of new advances by the Christians on Muslim areas of Beirut.
 Christian militiamen took over a Muslim slum near the port area earlier this week,
 and yesterday they launched an attack on a Shia Muslim community.
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Karami has not pressed his threat to resign, despite
 the failure of the cease-fire to take hold. Prominent Sunni Muslims have made it
 clear that they would refuse to participate in the government if Karami submitted a
 formal resignation that was accepted by President Franjiyah.
 resident Asad talked with
 e is leader Kamal Jumblatt in Damascus yesterday and is scheduled to meet other
 leftist and Muslim leaders later this week.
 Syrian and Lebanese leaders, with the notable exception of Shamun, appear to
 have intentionally kept silent on political and military developments over the past
 several days. This silence and a breakdown in communications between Beirut and
 other areas of the country have prompted what appear to be exaggerated press
 accounts of sweeping attacks by Muslims and Palestinians in the north around
 Tripoli and in the Bekaa Valley region. Muslim and leftist forces have had the upper
 hand in the north for some time and may have increased their pressure on the
 predominantly Christian communities in Zahlah. They also may have launched a
 countrywide campaign against government facilities and military installations. There
 is no evidence, however, that they have gained control of the northern and eastern
 regions.

 The US defense attache in Damascus was told by the commander of the
 Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) that the Yarmuk Brigade-the military arm of
 Fatah-recently entered Lebanon and is now south of Zahlah. The Yarmuk force
 may include as many as 2,500 troops. The PLA commander also indicated that five
 of his army's seven battalions are now in Lebanon. No mention was made of the
 total number of men involved.
 The Israelis are monitoring developments in Lebanon very closely, but they
 continue to react in a low-key manner.
 Defense Minister Peres is the only top Israeli official who has commented
 directly on the Lebanese situation in recent days. Speaking to graduating Israeli
 army officers, last Monday, he explicitly directed his comments toward Syria,
 warning that if a "foreign army" intervened in Lebanon, Israel would be forced to
 take the "necessary defensive measures." Peres and the Israeli chief of staff
 yesterday toured Israel's border with Lebanon.
 Other Israeli officials are largely restricting themselves to background briefings
 for journalists. They are playing down the recent movement of PLA troops from
 Syria into Lebanon, suggesting only that Asad may be using the PLA to pressure the
 Lebanese factions to reach a political compromise.
 At the same time, however, the Israeli officials are echoing Peres' warning that
 Israel could not remain indifferent to Syrian military intervention. Israeli press
 commentators are also suggesting that Syrian forces on the Golan Heights might
 become more vulnerable if Asad should decide to divert Syrian forces to Lebanon.

 Shortly before it released the preliminary findings of an investigation into the
 abortive paratroop uprising of last November, the government yesterday ordered the
 arrest of Maj. Otelo de Carvalho, former Portuguese security chief.
 Carvalho reportedly turned himself over to military authorities in Santarem, 35
 miles northeast of Lisbon, where he will await formal charges. One press report said
 that 11 others named in the investigating commission's report were also arrested.
 Since the uprising, about 150 persons, most of them military officers, have been
 detained.
 The commission was careful not to portray Carvalho, one of the leaders of the
 coup that brought the military to power in April 1974, as a ringleader of the
 November plot. In fact, his refusal to assume a leading role was cited as one of the
 reasons the uprising failed. Carvalho was implicated, however, because of his
 knowledge of the plot and his dereliction in allowing those under his command to
 proceed with their plans.
 The Communist Party and the far left are blamed by the investigative team for
 creating the climate of instability that led to the uprising. The report describes the
 Communist strategy of instigating strikes and demonstrations prior to the paratroop
 rebellion, but concludes that the party withdrew its official support when it became
 clear the plot would fail.
 The unfavorable references to the Communists are likely to put the party even
 more on the defensive and will do little to enhance its chances in the legislative
 assembly elections to be held before April 25.

 Moscow continues publicly to attack the concept of a coalition government in
 Angola, as advanced by the Popular Movement's opponents at the Addis Ababa
 summit.
 Apparently buoyed by Cuban-assisted Popular Movement successes on the
 battlefield, Pravda's weekly international review on January 18, in its strongest
 statement on the subject to date, claimed that there is no "realistic" basis for
 forming a government of national unity.
 The Pravda article attributed such an idea to pressures from imperialist circles
 in the West-meaning the United States-and added that the results of the OAU
 summit had proven that imperialist forces cannot dictate the course of events in
 Angola. Progressive African countries, it insisted, will now more than ever rally to
 the support of the Popular Movement.
 A working-level Soviet Foreign Ministry official reiterated this position on
 Monday in a conversation with a US embassy officer in Moscow. According to the
 official, "Angolans" are now sorting out their affairs, and outside powers "such as
 the US and South Africa" should not interfere with this process. He also said that
 Moscow's frequent demand that foreign forces withdraw from Angola referred only
 to the South Africans.
 Meanwhile, Soviet media are continuing their efforts to play up the Popular
 Movement's claims to legitimacy as well as its military successes. Pravda on January
 17 reported that National Front leader Holden Roberto had deserted to Kinshasa,
 and on the following day it repeated the claim that most of northern Angola had
 been "liberated." Zaire has come under increasing attack for actively supporting
 anti-MPLA forces, and National Union leader Savimbi is said to have turned to the
 West with repeated calls for aid.

 Turkish Foreign Minister Caglayangil has announced that the intercommunal
 9:alks will resume in Vienna on February 17.
 The Turkish government presumably plans to press Turkish Cypriot negotiator
 Denktash to drop some of his conditions for resuming the talks. Denktash has
 stipulated that UN Secretary General Waldheim must play only a ceremonial role,
 rather than actively mediate as in previous intercommunal sessions. Furthermore,
 Denktash wants the talks to be conducted by working groups in which Turkish and
 Greek mainlanders participate. These terms are unacceptable to the Greek side as
 well as to Waldheim.
 Greek  Cypriot  negotiator Clerides' withdrawal of his resignation as
 representative to the talks removed one potential obstacle to getting them under
 way. Other obstacles, however, are likely to surface before February 17, and a
 concerted effort by all parties will probably be required to ensure that the

 Spanish police prevented leftists from holding the rally that was planned last
 night in Madrid.
 The government said the demonstration would disrupt public order and
 announced the police would take whatever measures were necessary to prevent it.
 Police did use tear gas and clubs to break up groups that were preparing to march
 toward the Prime Minister's office to demand amnesty and political reforms. The
 demonstrators, fewer than 8,000 of them, were diverted into side streets.
 The government was apparently able to prevent the rally without using extreme
 measures that would have brought accusations that it was reverting to the repression
 of the Franco era.
 The Communist-dominated Democratic Junta and the Socialist-led Platform of
 Democratic Convergence that planned the demonstration will now find it difficult to
 carry out other joint actions. Earlier, the Communist Party and several illegal labor
 organizations were calling for a general strike in January.
 Factories in Madrid's industrial area were shut yesterday, following an
 unsuccessful attempt to reopen on Monday. Subway workers, whose ultimatum on
 their wage demands expired Monday, decided not to strike again but to await a
 decision of the official syndicate provincial council. The return to work of
 construction and port workers after winning pay raises has eased some of the labor

 President Peron's cabinet shuffle last week reportedly has caused displeasure
 among labor chiefs, who claim they should have a voice in government.
 Argentina's two principal labor leaders were rankled because she failed to
 consult them. They are said to be considering a 24-hour general strike on January
 21. If it were to come off, it would be the second time within a year that labor has
 challenged the administration, and the President's primary power base could be
 further weakened.
 Some labor leaders see an increase in power for several figures associated with
 former social welfare minister Jose Lopez Rega. Both Raul Lastiri, Lopez Rega's
 son-in-law, and ex-foreign minister Alberto Vignes are again presidential advisers.
 Should the President move to replace the two remaining cabinet members important
 to labor's interests-Economy Minister Cafiero and Labor Minister Ruchauf-the
 battle lines would be drawn for a major confrontation with labor.
 The armed forces have not been willing to run the risk of an unfavorable
 reaction by labor to a military take-over. Although the services might interpret a
 strike as a signal that rank-and-file workers would support the President's ouster,
 there has been no suggestion that labor would in fact do so.

 President Geisel has openly challenged the conservative wing of the army by
 firing one of its principal figures.
 Geisel summarily replaced Second Army commander General D'Avila Mello,
 top officer in the Sao Paulo area, shortly after the death of a second civilian prisoner
 in an army jail. Sao Paulo newsman Vladimir Herzog died in his cell last fall, an
 alleged suicide.
 Since taking office two years agio, Geisel has been seeking to curb the vast
 powers of conservative military and security officials, many of whom, at the local
 level, operate almost independent of Brasilia. The President has had limited success
 and the effort has brought him into conflict with those officers who argue that
 strong measures are still necessary to safeguard national security.
 Geisel probably made the latest move to demonstrate to the conservatives that
 they cannot influence him unduly and to give substance to his promise last fall that
 he would not tolerate further incidents like the death of the newsman.
 Geisel immediately named a close associate, General Dilermando Gomes
 Monteiro, to take over the important Sao Paulo command. Dilermando, who has
 presidential ambitions, will be hard put to enforce Geisel's orders concerning
 security excesses and at the same time maintain his popularity within the service.

 While operating more smoothly in 1975 than in 1974, the economy did not
 produce the banner year with which Peking had hoped to end the fourth five-year
 plan.
 The Chinese press has reported only sparsely on economic performance in 1975
 and on the outcome of the five-year plan. For example, the New Year's Day
 editorial in People's Daily-normally the vehicle for economic stocktaking-claimed
 only that industry and agriculture had fulfilled the five-year plan goals; Peking has
 never made these goals public. Based on sketchy information, our preliminary
 estimates for 1975 are that:
 --industrial production rose about 10 percent, compared with only 5 percent in
 1974;
 --grain output was roughly the same as the record 255-260 million tons
 harvested the previous year;
 --imports remained at the 1974 level of $7.5 billion, while exports rose from
 $6.5 billion to $7 billion.
 The industrial advance was attributable largely to the easing of factional
 wrangling and labor unrest that had disrupted factories and mines in 1974. The
 fastest growth continued to be in the petroleum sector, with output of crude oil
 rising to 1.6 million barrels per day-a jump of more than 20 percent. Industrial
 performance was again marred, however, by persistent bottlenecks in the key steel
 and coal industries. Peking continued to add industrial capacity by commissioning
 major new plants of both foreign and domestic origin.
 The performance of agriculture was generally disappointing. Only soybeans and
 ;uch secondary crops as oilseeds, sugar, and tobacco showed gains. Grain production
 was about the same as in 1974, while cotton output was lower. Because of the
 record harvest of 1974, grain imports could be cut last year to less than 4 million
 cons from 7 million tons in 1974. Peking has given no indication that it will try to
 purchase more grain for 1976 than the 2.5 to 4.8 million tons already obligated
 under agreements with Canada and Australia.
 A curb on imports reduced China's unprecedented $1-billion trade deficit in
 1974 to about $500 million last year. Japan remained the top trading partner.
 Chinese imports from the US dropped from $949 million in 1974 to $320 million in
 1975, the result of reduced Chinese purchases of US agricultural products. Chinese
 exports to the US increased to $155 million from $115 million in 1974.
