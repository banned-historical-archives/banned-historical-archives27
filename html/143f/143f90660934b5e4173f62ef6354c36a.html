 Chinese Document Soviet Border Provocations
 Chinese officials in recent months have been unusu-
 ally precise in specifying to foreign visitors the nature
 of Soviet-instigated border incidents in the northwest
 and northeast regions of China.   The incidents report-
 edly have not led to armed clashes similar in size to
 the company-level firefights of 1969, but some shooting
 allegedly did occur in Sinkiang.
 Regional officials in Sinkiang recently told a group
 that "six Soviet spies on a special 25X1
 mission" had been intercepted in July by Chinese border
 guards at Kashgar.   The Chinese did not explain how the
 six managed to reach the city, which is 70 miles from
 the Soviet border in the Pamir Mountains area, without
 being detected.   In an ensuing clash, the Chinese killed
 one, one killed himself  (presumably to avoid being taken
 alive), and four escaped to Soviet territory.   The offi-
 cials went on to say that the Chinese are now holding
 the weapons and identification cards of the two dead men
 and have offered to return their remains on conditions
 that the Soviets admit that they had been engaged in a
 clandestine mission.   Local Soviet authorities are said
 to have denied the Chinese accusation, declaring the men
 to have been "bad elements who deal in opium"--an ex-
 planation the Chinese reject.   A Chinese "Dispute Settle-
 ment Committee"  in Sinkiang is said to be negotiating with
 local Soviet authorities on the matter.
 The Chinese further complained that the Soviets
 have organized three groups of anti-Chinese Muslims, who
 earlier had fled to the USSR, with the intention of in-
 filtrating them back into Sinkiang clandestinely to re-
 cruit agents.   The Soviets almost certainly are continuing
 their long-term effort to revive and exploit the sepa-
 ratist tendency among the Turkic  (primarily Muslim) ethnic
 groups in Sinkiang, and may well be Muslim refugees
 trained in the USSR to return and carry the message of
 resistance.   The longstanding hostility of the Sinkiang

 they are jamming incoming Soviet broadcasts,

 particularly those directed at the northern Sinkiang city
 of Altai.   However, the Chinese broke the back of orga-
 nized Muslim resistance between 1962 and 1967, and the
 Soviets probably do not have any significant assets or
 the capability to develop such assets among the unarmed
 and unorganized minority group.
 During Ambassador Woodcock's mid-September tour of
 the northeast region, a Chinese provincial official in
 Heilung-kiang complained about the problems the Soviets
 were causing in the border rivers.   He stated that the
 decline in the province's fishing industry was due to
 heavy Soviet catches in the Amur River and to harassment
 of Chinese salmon fishermen by Soviet gunboats in the
 Ussuri River..

 about harassment of their salmon fishermen, who report-
 edly are now restricted by the Soviets to a 15-day season.
 despite the current border-river talks on navigation
 matters, there is no possibility of an improvement in
 overall Sino-Soviet relations.
 The motivation of the Chinese in detailing these
 border difficulties                            has several as-
 pects,   First, the Chinese intend to support their charges
 that Soviet professions of goodwill toward Mao's suc-
 cessors are phoney and Hua Kuo-feng's recent complaint
 that Moscow "has not shown one iota of good faith" about
 improving Sino-Soviet relations.   Second, they intend
 indirectly to deny the Soviets any increased leverage in
 the Sino-Soviet--,US triangle despite the lack of progress
 in bilateral Sino-US relations.   It is unlikely, however,
 that Peking believes Moscow can be impelled by the pres-
 sure of international opinion to change its border poli-
 cies.               The most the Chinese hope for is some success in
 portraying the Soviet leaders as intransigent.

 A New Policy Toward Intellectuals
 RPA  25X1
 25X1
 Over the past few months, the Chinese Government
 has been reexamining its policy toward intellectuals, a
 group buffeted for two decades in shifting political
 winds.   Instead of denouncing their work and their lack
 of political commitment, the government has recently en-
 couraged them, been tolerant of their "ideological weak-
 nesses," and shown awareness of their importance to
 China's modernization.
 This new attitude has been reflected in a number
 of plans to improve the lot of intellectuals, and in
 particular,  scientists.   These include efforts to:
 -- Improve the working conditions of intellectuals.
 -- Reward intellectuals, especially scientists, who
 make contributions to China's modernization
 effort.
 -- Allow scientists to devote the majority of their
 time to professional work rather than to polit-
 ical study sessions and work in factories and
 communes.   The recent Central Committee
 circular on science and technology suggested
 that scientists spend at least five-sixths of
 their working hours each week on scientific
 work.
 -- Ensure that all scientists are given appropriate
 jobs in their field.   There has recently been
 considerable concern that the country has lost
 much badly needed talent since the 1960s by
 removing scientists from their jobs and sending
 them to work in factories and communes.
 -- Place people with some professional competence,
 "experts" or "near-experts," rather than party
 cadres,  in charge of professional work.

 One of the most significant aspects of the new pol-
 icy toward intellectuals is the plan to allow more free-
 dom of debate and discussion in the sciences.   Although
 this has been discussed in the press since at least
 March,  it has been treated with particular urgency in
 recent articles.   Thus,  the Central Committee circular
 announcing the coming national science conference stated
 that it was essential to encourage people to dare to
 think,  to speak, and to act, and that it was "criminal"
 to suppress free academic discussion.  Even more unusual
 was a KWangming Daily editorial on the circular, which
 abandoned the standard ideological tenet about the
 wisdom of the masses and instead urged individuals to
 think independently and be creative.   Individual effort
 and thinking,  it noted, were essential to the success
 of any research project.
 So far the call for freedom of discussion and de-
 bate has been limited to the sciences, whose develop-
 ment is directly related to efforts to modernize the
 Chinese economy.   For the time being,  it is unlikely
 that it will be extended to the more politically sensi-
 tive social sciences and humanities.                          Many of China's
 leaders probably remember that the last time the govern-
 ment called for more freedom of thought and discussion--
 during the "100 Flowers" campaign in 1957--China's in-
 tellectuals responded not only with more creative liter-
 ary and art works, but also with criticism of the gov-
 ernment and its policies.
 Most of the other specific plans to improve the lot
 of intellectuals have also been limited to scientists.
 There is more chance, however, that these will eventu-
 ally be extended to other intellectuals as well.   A
 number of recent articles have condemned past attacks
 on intellectuals and past efforts to stifle their work.
 In addition, the recent rehabilitation of a number of
 cultural figures, ranging from actors and actresses to
 the once controversial historian Lo Erh-kang,  suggests
 that the government is now more tolerant of such people
 and is actively seeking their support.
 The new policy toward intellectuals is clearly an
 effort to overcome the negative effects of the political
 pressures placed on them over the past 20 years.   Most
 Chinese intellectuals have been so intimidated and

 Cultural Returnees:   Better Late Than Never
 The public rehabilitation on 30 September of Chou
 Yang and Hsia Yen, major cultural figures who were among
 the earliest and most vilified victims of the Cultural
 Revolution, would appear to be a personal triumph for
 Teng Hsiao-ping.   Teng's efforts in 1975 to bring them
 back brought him into direct conflict with the "gang of
 four" and contributed to his own downfall.   Neverthe-
 less,                the fact that former deputy propaganda chief Chou
 Yang was widely attacked during the period between the
 fall of the leftists and Teng's return, plus the con-
 tinuing delay in identifying a new minister of culture,
 suggests that the rehabilitations were not without con-
 troversy and that personnel appointments may be at issue.
 Teng Hsiao-ping has been remarkably persistent in
 his efforts, now spanning more than two years,  to bring
 these cultural figures back into the limelight.   They

 editorial published on 4 September of that year virtually
 called a halt to the "Water Margin" campaign, however,
 and the central directive announcing the cultural re-
 habilitations was circulated the next day.   The leftists,
 however, redoubled their efforts and by year's end forced

 Despite the fall of the leading leftists, there is
 some evidence that surfacing Chou and Hsia last month
 was not an easy matter.                           Chou Yang,  in particular, was
 f(    attacked frequently after the fall of the "gang of four"
 for his opposition in the 1930s to the writer Lu Hsun.
 Lu,  in turn, was being praised for his attacks on Chang
 Chun-chiao's early writing.   Chou Yang was attacked by
 name as recently as April of this year, and his re-
 habilitation reportedly was being debated in Pekin
 Universit  the next month.
 The remaining leftists, in the universities and
 elsewhere, are one possible source of opposition to the
 return of people like Chou Yang, but it seems likely
 that such opposition is more widespread,   Leftist in-
 fluence in the propaganda apparatus has been virtually
 wiped, out, and the media attacks on Chou through last
 spring must have been coming from other quarters.   It
 seems more than coincidence that attacks on Chou occurred
 while the terms of Teng Hsiao-ping's return were under
 discussion, and it is possible that those in the leader-
 ship who were trying to delay Teng's return were like-
 wise opposed to Chou Yang's rehabilitation.
 25X1
 25X1
 The return of Chou Yang is further evidence, if any
 is needed, that Teng is practically surrounding himself
 with the "old boys" who held sway before the Cultural
 Revolution.   He is obviously more comfortable with them
 than he is with such second generation figures as Hua
 Kuo-feng and Wang Tung-hsing.   Teng may have in mind
 placing Chou Yang and Hsia Yen in important positions in
 the propaganda and/or cultural organizations, a move that
 conceivably could draw fire from others who would prefer
 to see fewer personnel appointments going to People with
 allegiances to Teng.                                                   25X1

 Overseas Chinese Scientists Provide Expertise
 As part of its effort to upgrade China's science
 and technology, the Chinese Government has recently
 begun to draw on the knowledge and experience of over-
 seas Chinese scientists, particularly those in the US.
 Over the past few months, a number of these scientists
 have been invited to China not only to tour the country
 and visit friends and relatives, but also to do re-
 search, consult with Chinese scientists, and deliver
 papers at academic conferences.   Between April and late
 August 1977, for example, a Chinese-American geneticist
 conducted research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
 with a prominent Chinese biologist.   In August, a noted
 Chinese-American astrophysicist delivered a paper at a
 symposium on astrophysics in Anhwei Province.   Another
 astrophysicist, on a visit to China to see relatives,
 was asked to give a series of lecutres to Chinese scien-
 tists.
 The Chinese Government favors working with such
 overseas Chinese for a number of reasons.   Most are
 prominent in their fields and have the expertise and
 mastery of scientific theory that many Chinese scien-
 tists lack.   They are thus potential sources of infor-
 mation about the advanced Western research techniques
 and scientific theories that China needs in order to
 achieve modernization.   Because all overseas Chinese
 invited to lecture or do research have been native-born
 Chinese who speak Mandarin, there is no language barrier.
 Many overseas Chinese scientists, moreover, are already
 well acquainted with some of China's most prominent
 scientists:   they were their schoolmates, friends, and
 in some cases, even students.   Finally, because over-
 seas Chinese scientists are ethnically Chinese, drawing
 on their expertise may be less of an affront to China's
 national pride and its policy of self-reliance than
 drawing on that of other foreign scientists.
 The degree of influence overseas Chinese scientists
 can exert is suggested by an incident which took place

 in 1972.  An eminent Chinese-American astrophysicist,
 on a visit to China, told Mao Tse-tung that-China's re-
 search and training in basic scientific theory was weak.
 Mao ordered Chou En-lai to take measures to correct
 this, and Chou in turn ordered Peking University to up-
 grade its teaching and research in basic theory.  Those
 efforts, of course, were subsequently undermined by the
 radical push to politicize China's educational system.
 The Chinese Government has shown no interest in
 arranging similar research projects and consultation
 for visiting overseas Chinese social scientists. The
 social sciences and humanities are far more politically
 sensitive than the sciences.  For the time being, the
 Chinese are likely to approve only those exchanges that
 make a direct contribution to China's modernization ef-
 fort.                                                         25X1

 Ranks Again For the PLA?
 China's armed forces may again be given military
 ranks.   Peking dropped ranks in 1965 after using them
 for 10 years and returned to the Chinese convention of
 addressing military officers by their position or func-
 tion rather than by a Western-style rank.
 Now   scientists and technicians are to be given
 titles,
 The purpose
 of this move, which flies directly in the face of Maoist
 egalitarianism, is to recognize the contribution of
 "technical personnel" to modernization.
 Military rank may also be an issue, at least among
 leaders of the People's Liberation Army                 (PLA).   It seems
 clear
 that military modernization will be a very gradual and
 expensive process.   Throughout this year, various low-
 cost methods of strengthening the PLA have been advo-
 cated,  including increasing training and improving dis-
 cipline. Those who favor reviving ranks could argue
 that it would be an important symbol of advancing mod-
 ernization of the PLA.
 Other military leaders, especially political com-
 missars, who are more concerned with ideology, may op-
 pose the restoration of ranks because of their past as-
 sociation with Soviet "revisionism."   Some civilian
 leaders may also resist any effort to bring back mili-
 tary ranks because it would tend to enhance the prestige
 of those military men who hold concurrent political po-
 sitions.

 means of strengthening military professionalism, ranks
 Sooner or later, ranks will probably return to the
 PLA.   Chinese leaders are strongly committed to improv-
