 only slightly. Since 1976, as a result of heavy government expenditures on
 consumer programs, personal incomes have risen and living conditions have
 improved. There are now signs, however, that Beijing regards this heavy
 spending as a short-term fix and considers its debt to the consumer as
 largely repaid. The leadership believes further improvements in living
 standards, if attempted too rapidly, will siphon off resources needed for the
 military and for building a strong heavy industrial base.
 Investment recently has rebounded, reducing the resources available for
 current consumption. Peasants are being told not to expect further large
 hikes in prices for their products, and urban workers are being advised that
 further wage increases must be based on gains in productivity. For the
 population at large, this means that, at best, living standards will improve
 only slowly.
 The leadership's attempts to regain worker and peasant confidence by
 raising wages and incomes appears to have met with only moderate success.
 Most workers and peasants can point to improvements in their living
 conditions; but we believe they remain dissatisfied with the extent of those
 gains and skeptical of government promises of further improvements.
 Beijing's measures have led to gains in agricultural productivity, but
 productivity in the industrial sector has responded little, if at all, to higher
 bonuses and wages. Moreover, these efforts have entailed considerable
 costs: defense spending has been squeezed; investment cuts have slowed
 growth in such vital sectors as energy and transportation; consumer
 subsidies have swollen budget deficits; inflation has accelerated; and
 consumer expectations have risen.
 We believe that sporadic attempts at economic reforms eventually will
 yield some gains in economic growth. But deep-seated problems of low
 labor productivity and inefficient use of capital defy easy solution and will
 continue to hamper growth in output and personal income. As a result,
 discontent among the population again may grow, creating further pres-
 sures on political leaders to change economic policy.

 China:
 Problems in Meeting
 Consumer Expectations
 China's Consumers Get Attention
 By investing heavily in some areas of the modern
 sector and using labor-intensive methods elsewhere,
 China attained high rates of economic growth, both in
 the 1950s and the decade that began in the mid-
 1960s. The investment was made possible at the
 expense of consumers, particularly since the mid-
 1960s. For the Chinese consumer in the mid-1970s,
 wages and living conditions were no better than they
 had been two decades earlier. There had been minor
 improvements-rural health services, for example-
 but gains were rare and it was far easier to point to
 evidence of decline. In the cities, public services had
 deteriorated, and to purchase food or get a haircut one
 had to wait in line far longer than in the 1950s.
 Official Chinese data show a 4-percent decline in real
 personal income per capita for urban residents be-
 tween 1957 and 1975. For peasants, the data suggest
 a 22-percent increase, however, that works out to only
 a 1.1 percent average annual growth (table 1).
 This prolonged stagnation of real incomes contrasts
 with the visible improvement in living conditions
 during the 1950s. During the years of the First Five-
 Year Plan (1953-57), urban real incomes grew at an
 average annual rate of 8.2 percent, peasant incomes at
 3.3 percent yearly.' In 1958 and 1959, however,
 Beijing embarked on the disastrous Great Leap For-
 ward, and then spent the first half of the 1960s
 recovering. During the 1958 to 1965 period, per
 capita real income for urban workers declined. Peas-
 ants fared better; by 1965 their real incomes had
 regained 1957 levels. During the Cultural Revolution,
 with its emphasis on egalitarianism and ideological
 incentives, Chinese data suggest that real incomes for
 both workers and peasants rose only slightly.
 Complaints by urban workers about wages and living
 standards during the late 1960s and early 1970s were
 symptomatic of serious morale problems and growing
 labor unrest. The general wage increase enacted by

 Beijing in 1971 and 1972 was an early attempt,
 largely ineffective, to placate an urban work force
 angry about the government freeze on wages and
 promotions. Similarly, recommendations in 1975 for
 regular promotions, wage increases, and a system of
 production bonuses-contained in a controversial
 State Council document-were aimed at redressing
 grievances and boosting morale.'
 Farmers also experienced financial difficulties, but 25X1
 politically they were less of a problem for the leader-
 ship than urban workers. Peasant protests about low
 farm prices, strictures on private enterprise, and
 meddling in farm operations by bureaucrats-major
 farm issues-were much less visible and less likely to
 gain momentum. Prior to the late 1970s, Beijing
 responded by gradually reducing the prices of indus-
 trial materials and equipment bought by rural collec-
 tives. These reductions were widely publicized, but
 their impact on personal incomes was slight.

 After Mao died, the new leaders thought that the
 settled political situation would allow a quick return
 to earlier high rates of growth. They developed ambi-
 tious plans for capital imports to modernize the
 economy-some US $7 billion worth of complete
 plants were ordered from the West. But it became
 evident that these plans, focused on heavy industry,
 would not work. Shortcomings in the system of eco-
 nomic management and serious bottlenecks in the
 economy stood in the way of sustained rapid growth.
 Increased Spending on Consumers
 In 1977 China's leaders took the first steps to improve
 worker morale by increasing wages and reintroducing
 bonuses. Then at the third party plenum in December
 1978, Beijing completely revamped its development
 strategy. One of the chief elements in the nets strate-
 gy was a focus on consumption (rather than invest-
 ment) so as to improve incentives (and productivity).
 Beijing hammered out the new development strategy
 in a series of lengthy bargaining sessions, where
 bureaucrats responsible for heavy industry, construc-
 tion, and the military establishment tried to minimize
 the damage to their own budgets. Eventual policy
 steps having a direct impact on consumers included:
 ? 1977: Promoting lower level employees one to two
 grades, thus raising the average wage for these
 workers by about 10 percent.
 ? 1978: Reinstituting production bonuses, abandoned
 during the late 1960s.
 ? 1979: (1) Raising procurement prices paid by the
 government for some farm products; (2) Simulta-
 neously, granting monthly food subsidies to all
 urban workers to offset increases in retail prices
 resulting from the increase in procurement prices;
 (3) Again promoting lower level employees one to
 two grades, thus increasing their average wages by
 another 10 percent.

 activities and collective production and enlarging
 the scope of free markets and private enterprise.F-
 Government Spending on Consumers,
 1978-81 (yuan)
 -44.2 billion for price hikes of farm products.
 -36 billion for price subsidies for agricultural inputs
 and foodstuffs.
 -7.8 billion in foregone agricultural taxes.
 -30 billion for wage increases and bonuses.
 -10.5 billion in wages for new entrants to the work
 force.
 -2.8 billion for improvements in urban services.
 -5 billion for the state's share of new housing
 construction.
 According to Chinese Government reports, some 140
 billion yuan were spent from 1978 to 1981 on various
 programs aimed at raising incomes and improving
 living standards (see box). By way of comparison, state
 budgetary expenditures in 1981 totaled only 109
 billion yuan.
 With more resources being channeled into consump-
 tion, other sectors increasingly have been squeezed.
 The impact on heavy industry has been the greatest
 but even the high-priority transport and energy sec-
 tors have been affected. Chinese data show that the
 share of national income allotted to investment has
 steadily declined since 1978, while the portion going
 into consumption uses has risen (see table 2). In 1981
 additional spending for consumption purposes exceed-
 ed in absolute terms the increase in national income,
 resulting in strong inflationary pressures and substan-
 tial redistribution of income.
 Official data on China's state budget also show the
 squeeze exerted on programs having little or no
 consumption components. Most notable have been the
 reductions in investment spending on new plant and
 equipment and additional restrictions on defense
 spending (see table 3).? Revenues and expenditures

 have declined since 1979, and, as mentioned, these
 fiscal pressures have increased bureaucratic infighting
 over budgetary matters. The inability to reach agree-
 ment on the cuts needed to accommodate new con-
 sumer programs in turn has been a major factor in
 China's series of budget deficits.
 Urban-Rural Differences
 The rapid gains in peasant incomes have only slightly
 narrowed the differences between rural and urban
 living standards. For many peasants, particularly
 those living in the suburbs of large cities, the urban-
 rural gap has closed markedly. Opportunities for
 earning money outside of agriculture-in commerce
 or other service jobs, for example-are greater in the
 suburbs, and incomes of enterprising peasants often
 surpass the earnings of factory workers. This compari-
 son of a prosperous suburban peasant to an urban
 worker earning an average or low wage is reflected in
 press reports of complaints by urban residents that the
 government has paid too much attention to rural
 living standards
 Nevertheless, for most of China's 800 million peas-
 ants the urban-rural gap remains essentially un-
 changed, as it has for generations (see figure 1). Rural
 incomes are roughly half urban incomes, and, of the
 four consumer durables shown in table 4, the rural-
 urban ratio showed a definite improvement only for
 bicycles during the 1979-81 period; for radios and
 sewing machines it changed very little; and for wrist-
 watches and clocks it deteriorated badly. Life for
 most peasants is still primitive and difficult, accompa-
 nied by supply shortages and inconveniences. City

 Of which:
 residents continue to earn larger incomes and receive
 preferential distribution of goods and services-in-
 cluding highly sought after items such as bicycles, 25X1

 more living space per capita than urban workers; but
 rural housing in general lacks the conveniences-
 indoor toilets, running water, and so forth-custom-
 ary in urban areas.
 Consumer Gains, 1979-81: A Summary 3                 25X1
 During the 1979-81 period, urban incomes grew by
 7.5 percent and rural incomes by 14.2 percent annual-
 ly in real terms. Urban gains came mostly through
 increases in wages and bonuses, without correspond-
 ing increases in productivity. Rural gains, on the other
 hand were from both price increases for agricultural
 products and higher productivity. The introduction of
 various types of responsibility systems, the expansion
 of private plots, and proliferation of free markets 25X1
 contributed to large increases in farm output and
 productivity.                               25X1
 Savings accumulated rapidly during the 1979-81 peri-
 od-the portion of income saved in urban areas
 quadrupled and in rural areas it doubled. Comments

 China: Rural and Urban Household Stocks
 of Consumer Durables
 In both urban and rural areas, consumption patterns
 are changing. Spending on consumer durables is
 rising rapidly because of pent-up demand, and the
 share spent on foodstuffs is staying even or declining.
 Expenditures on clothing are rising rapidly in cities.
 Peasants, on the other hand, are spending much larger
 portions of their incomes on new housing.
 Major Consumer Issues
 Although Chinese consumers are better off now than
 in 1976, the gains have not been without cost. Infla-
 tion has accelerated, investment cuts have slowed the
 elimination of bottlenecks in the energy and transport
 sectors, and defense spending has been further
 squeezed-to name only the major consequences.
 Opponents of post-Mao consumer programs thus have
 no trouble citing reasons why some of these programs
 should be scaled back, or even eliminated. We believe
 the following issues will continue to concern Chinese
 leaders over the next few years.
 Inflation. We believe that inflation is the principal
 consumer issue facing China in the 1980s. Our calcu-
 lations show that inflation during 1979-81 wiped out
 over one-third of urban and one-fifth of rural income
 gains, and inflationary pressures remain strong. Pub-
 lic sensitivity in China to price hikes runs high,
 particularly among those old enough to have vivid
 memories of the hyperinflation in the late 1940s.F_

 The leadership is concerned that persistent inflation
 could lead to public protests-especially in the cit-
 ies-if unchecked. This concern rests at least in part
 on the events of December 1981 when consumers
 reacted to rumors of impending retail price hikes by
 engaging in widespread panic buying. According to
 provincial broadcasts, panic buying of staple food-   25X1
 stuffs spread so quickly that within two days Beijing
 issued a directive that characterized panic purchasing
 as "detrimental to political stability" and demanded
 that local officials take immediate action. Concur-   25X1

 Congress, several delegates expressed dismay over
 Whenever possible, Beijing has increased subsidy
 payments rather than boost retail prices. Having
 decided to increase peasant incomes by raising the
 procurement prices paid for farm products, the lead-
 ership in early 1979 increased subsidy payments to
 the purchasing agencies. When forced to raise some
 retail prices for foodstuffs in late 1979, the govern-
 ment started paying an extra 5 yuan per month to

 urban workers as a food subsidy. According to official
 data, outlays for price and food subsidies in 1981
 exceeded 36 billion yuan-roughly equivalent to one-
 third of state budget expenditures and perhaps 5
 percent of GNP. The drain on revenues created by the
 subsidy program helped produce the largest budget
 deficit in the history of the People's Republic of China
 in 1979 and further deficits in 1980 and 1981. The
 government financed these deficits in part by issuing
 currency, which added to inflationary pressures al-
 ready present in the economy.
 Beijing has responded to the inflation challenge by
 ordering a freeze on most retail prices. Enforcing this
 freeze, however, poses a major problem for the gov-
 ernment with its inefficient and understaffed price
 inspection teams. The leadership is also trying to soak
 up excess currency in circulation and imposing re-
 strictions on' bonuses. Annual bonus payments are to
 be limited to the equivalent of no more than two
 months' basic wages; but evasion of this stricture is
 commonplace.
 Unemployment. The slower economic growth and
 stronger emphasis on cutting costs and improving
 productivity now forecast for the remainder of the
 1980s will make it more difficult for Beijing to create
 new jobs at rates comparable to those of the past few
 years. At the same time, the number of available new
 entrants to the urban labor force will be growing
 rapidly. We believe that Beijing will be hard pressed
 to keep unemployment from rising and consequently
 will find it even more difficult to maintain acceptable
 growth in real incomes.
 Wage Reform. Reforms in China's wage system-
 virtually unchanged since the 1950s-are vital to
 improvements in labor productivity. Wage reform
 would also help Beijing control bonus payments (and
 ease inflationary pressures), which in the absence of
 regular wage increases and promotions have become
 the primary source of income gains for workers. We
 believe that in the absence of wage reform, labor
 productivity will remain sluggish. Efforts' are. under
 way to tighten the link between bonuses and produc-
 tivity, but judging from China's experience thus far,
 these efforts are likely to falter.
 Agricultural Procurement Prices. While further in-
 creases in the prices paid by the government for farm
 products are unlikely in the early 1980s, the issue will
 almost certainly remain alive and a source of contro-
 versy among the leadership. At present, the consensus
 in Beijing appears to be that another round of price
 hikes on the order of those in 1979 would aggravate
 an already serious fiscal situation. Still, some officials
 are arguing that, because peasant living standards
 and productivity are so low, additional agricultural
 price hikes are necessary. On balance, we believe that
 pressures on the budget and complaints that Beijing is
 favoring peasants at the expense of urban workers
 make price hikes politically untenable in the near
 future.
 Scarcity of Consumer Goods. Shortages are a domi-
 nant fact of life for China's consumers; in many
 instances they are more important determinants of
 consumption patterns than are consumer preferences
 or incomes. And shortages often are not simply a
 result of the lack of raw materials or the inability to       25X1
 manufacture particular consumer goods. Frequently
 they are due to quirks in the system itself-to
 irrational prices, peculiarities in the incentive system,
 or simply organizational barriers
 Some of these factors are illustrated by a survey
 conducted in the large industrial city of Shenyang in
 China's northeast, where this past summer 10 percent
 of retail goods in department stores were out of stock.
 In 18 of the city's department stores, 453 kinds of
 consumer goods were out of stock. Among these, 176
 kinds, or 38.9 percent, were textile products. Woolen
 blankets have been unavailable for "quite a few
 years;" cotton ones for two years. Other unavailable
 goods were mostly small articles.
 The department stores cited several reasons for the
 shortages:
 ? Factories did not want to manufacture goods that
 bring in low profits.

 ? Wholesale departments mixed slow-selling goods
 with those in high demand, and they refused to
 break up large lots. In both cases, retailers would
 not buy for fear of overstocking, and this led to the
 unavailability of such goods as sheets, pillow cases,
 and children's blankets.
 ? Shops would not sell goods that earned little profit,
 therefore, small articles such as plastic buttons were
 hard to find.
 According to the Ministry of Commerce, these prob-
 lems exist throughout urban China.
 Shortages are particularly acute in rural areas. A
 recent article in the journal Economic Research
 illustrated the severity of this problem, especially with
 regard to consumer durables. A survey of one county
 showed that supply as a percentage of demand ranged
 from a low of zero for small electric fans to a high of
 44.3 percent for high-grade apparel. These data prob-
 ably are not representative of the situation in all of
 rural China, but they illustrate well a major difficulty
 facing Beijing: large increases in income unmatched
 by supplies of goods.
 Entrepreneurship. Expressions of private and collec-
 tive entrepreneurship, while welcomed by liberal ele-
 ments in China's new leadership, are mistrusted by
 others, particularly lower level cadre. An enlarged
 private/collective sector in China would create addi-
 tional jobs for unemployed urban youth and peasants
 and facilitate the expansion of neglected services, such
 as barbershops and restaurants, which are especially
 suitable for small-scale private or collective operation.
 Despite these obvious economic advantages, there are
 signs that local governmental restrictions are suffocat-
 ing entrepreneurial activity in many areas. The US
 consulate has reported that in the southern city of
 Guangzhou, for example, many private businesses
 have closed down in recent months as a result of
 excessive registration fees and overregulation. In ad-
 dition, private businessmen complain that they must
 compete with state enterprises for supplies and fuel
 and are frequently forced to locate their businesses in
 undesirable parts of town. The lesson of Guangzhou
 for the leadership in Beijing is that considerable local
 leadership resistance to private or collective entrepre-
 neurship must be overcome before those forms of
 economic organization can become significant sources
 of economic stimulus.
 Prospects: Benign Neglect?                   25X1
 There are signs that the leadership is easing up on its
 proconsumer policies and paying more attention to
 investment needs. Investment spending in 1982 is 25X1
 back up, after last year's cuts (which fell short of
 intended reductions). Reflecting this, heavy industrial
 growth has rebounded. And there are signs that
 military spending may receive a boost. Speakers at the
 12th Party Congress in September promised contin-
 ued stress on improvements in living standards, but in
 the next breath said that income gains must be   25X1
 smaller than gains in productivity.
 The policy that seems to be emerging is essentially the
 policy that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s until it
 was undermined by leftist influences: small but steady
 increases in personal incomes accompanied by in-
 creases in government spending on public services and
 housing-all tied closely to gains in productivity. For
 some time, productivity has stagnated. If Beijing is
 unable to resolve the productivity conundrum and 25X1
 must reduce consumption growth below the rates now
 anticipated, there is a very real possibility that later in
 the 1980s the government will face both a deeply  25X1
 discontented population and an economy capable of
 only slow growth-resulting in pressures and opportu-
 nities for changes in policies and policymakers.
 Beijing's primary objectives remain military strength
 and basic economic self-sufficiency; and we believe
 that the leadership believes any gains in living stand-
 ards above some minimal level will siphon off re-
 sources and slow the drive to reach these objectives.
 The new economic development strategy adopted in
 late 1978, with its emphasis on efficiency, necessarily
 assigns a higher priority to consumer interests and to
 industries producing consumer goods-through re-
 quirements for stronger incentives and exports. But

 the present view of the Chinese leadership appears to
 be that greater spending on current and future con-
 sumption reduces the resources that can be channeled
 into those industries that are basic to economic and
 military strength. As the Chinese succeed in placating
 consumers and redressing the imbalances in their
 economy, this view will grow stonger and will proba-
 bly ;predominate for some time to come. For the
 population at large, this means that, at best, living
 conditions will slowly and steadily improve. It also
 means that consumer programs will be accorded a low
 priority, and in a crunch will be sacrificed for higher
 priority goals

 Appendix A
 Urban and Rural Consumption
 Since 1978
 Urban Consumers
 Income Growth. While money incomes grew by an
 annual average rate of 11.9 percent during the 1979-
 81 period in urban areas, real incomes grew at a
 substantially lower 7.5-percent yearly rate (table A-1).
 Inflation sharply reduced gains in real income during
 1979-81-the official urban cost-of-living index
 shows a total increase of 12.9 percent for the period.
 A rapidly expanding money supply, widespread short-
 ages of consumer goods, and strong consumer de-
 mand-all contributed to the inflationary surge.
 Other data suggest slower growth.' More important,
 real incomes grew more slowly with each passing
 year. From a high of 12.3 percent in the base year of
 1978, real income growth declined slightly in 1979
 and again in 1980; then in 1981 growth was only 1.3
 percent. Real wages actually declined last year; had
 not a larger percentage of family members found
 employment, per capita real income would have
 fallen.
 Income Distribution. In its 1981 survey of the Chi-
 nese economy, the World Bank found an "extraordi-
 narily" low degree of urban inequality in comparison
 with other countries. A survey taken by the Chinese in
 early 1980 implies that the poorest 40 percent of
 China's urban population receive about 30 percent of
 total urban income, that the richest 20 percent receive
 about 28 percent, and that the richest 10 percent
 receive about 16 percent. The Bank economists attrib-
 ute this degree of equality basically to three factors.
 First, there is little private property income (rents,
 dividends, and profits), which tends to be very un-
 equally distributed in other countries. Second, there is
 little income from self-employment, which in other
 ' For a variety of reasons, we believe official price indexes under-
 state the rate of inflation. Data on commodity consumption (table
 A-2) seem to indicate real income growth lower than the 7.5-
 percent annual average derived by using the official cost-of-living
 index for urban workers. Per capita consumption of three of the
 four nondurables shown in table A-2 grew by less than 7.5 percent
 annually during the period 1979-81; as did per capita consumption
 of two of the four most popular durables.
 countries also has exhibited a high degree of inequal-
 ity. Finally, wages and salaries are comparatively
 equal, primarily because the relative pay of manageri-
 al, professional, and technical employees is much
 lower than in most other developing countries.
 China is similar to other developing countries in one
 important respect: differences in household per capita
 income are closely related to differences in the per-
 centage of family members employed. Thus, while the
 difference between the richest and poorest households
 in earnings per worker is only 9 yuan, the gap in
 household per capita incomes is 46 yuan. The employ-
 ment rates' for households in the poorest and richest
 categories are 25 percent and 85 percent. To a
 considerable extent these differences are due to varia-
 tions in the age and sex composition of households,
 but the differences are also partly explained by the
 existence of several million unemployed young people.
 Despite the rapid growth of incomes during the past
 several years, we believe that income distribution has
 remained relatively unchanged. Developments, which
 under other circumstances would have widened earn-
 ings gaps, have been offset by other factors. For
 example, the relatively high profitability of light
 industry could have led to rapid bonus and wage
 growth in that sector, but the addition of new, low-
 paid workers to the work force has restrained the
 growth of the average wage. Also, the institutions
 responsible for allocating bonuses have distributed
 them in an egalitarian way, diminishing any possibili-
 ties that bonus payments might have contributed to a
 less equal distribution of income.
 Some groups, however, by virtue of their occupations
 have either been ineligible for bonus payments or
 unable to earn very large bonuses. Teachers, govern-
 ment employees, and health personnel are among this
 ' Number of workers per household divided by total household
 members.

 group, and their real incomes have slipped relative to
 people in other occupations. Beijing finally responded
 to their complaints by raising wages for these groups
 last year.
 Perhaps most important among the factors preserving
 the existing income distribution has been the growth
 of employment. By encouraging early retirement
 among parents and promoting the establishment of
 collective and individual enterprises, Beijing has ac-
 celerated the growth of job opportunities for the large
 number of unemployed young people. Partly as a
 result, the overall urban employment rate rose from
 48.6 percent in 1978 to 56.4 percent in 1981-a
 substantial gain.
 Surge in Savings. Official statistics show that since
 1978 personal savings deposits in urban areas have
 grown at an average annual rate of nearly 32 percent
 (table A-3); and the share of urban incomes deposited
 in savings accounts has almost quadrupled (from 2.2
 percent in 1978 to 7.9 percent in 1981). In 1979, 54
 percent of each additional yuan of income went into
 savings. Increased supplies of consumer goods during
 1980-81, along with rising prices, caused savings from
 new income to fall, but savings still remain very high.
 Changing Patterns of Consumption. Patterns of con-
 sumption in urban areas-the result of consumer
 preferences, prices, and money incomes-are distort-
 ed in China by supply shortages and consumer subsi-
 dies. Shortages prevent consumers from buying the
 amounts and types of goods they would prefer, while
 subsidies tend to encourage greater-than-normal con-
 sumption of subsidized goods. Consumer surveys tak-
 en by the State Statistical Bureau show that per
 capita urban expenditures grew by a total of 46.8
 percent during 1979-81 (table A-4). Consumers spent
 relatively more on goods, less on services. Of the
 developments evident in table A-4, the relatively small
 decline in the share of spending on food and the sharp
 increases in spending on clothing and daily articles
 (miscellaneous household items and consumer dura-
 bles) are the most significant.                25X1
 By far, food remains the most important budget item,
 accounting for more than one-half of the average
 family budget. Although not shown in the table, we
 believe that the composition of foodstuffs purchased
 probably have changed since 1978. Consumers now
 probably purchase relatively more nonstaple food-
 stuffs (especially vegetables and fruits) and luxury
 food items (pastries, liquors) than in the past; and they
 probably eat out more frequently.
 Spending on the next largest categories-clothing and
 daily articles-now accounts for nearly one-fourth of
 the family budget. Per capita spending on clothing
 has risen by almost 60 percent since 1978, boosting its
 share of total purchases from 13.6 percent in 1978 to
 14.8 percent in 1981. Spending on daily articles grew
 by 67 percent, raising the share of spending in that
 category from 8.4 percent in 1978 to 9.6 percent in
 1981. Purchases of durable goods accounted for much
 of this rise. Consumer durables production has
 boomed, reducing-but not eliminating-shortages.
 Survey data on household stocks of durables (table A-
 2) show significant growth, particularly in radios and

 television sets. Although their output is extremely
 limited, washing machines and refrigerators have
 become popular items among high-income consumers.
 Occasionally media reports discuss consumer trends
 that are not apparent in the aggregate data on
 consumption patterns. Beijing Municipality authori-
 ties have noted a number of developments affecting
 their garment industry:
 ? While sales of manufactured garments in big de-
 partment stores were down by 30 percent this
 summer, the city's tailor shops had more work than
 they could handle. This was attributed to consumer
 desires for something new, something "with
 originality."
 ? Silk is in heavy demand. It, along with jersey, light
 woolen fabrics, and cream-colored polyesters, is
 selling fast. Flowery dresses are growing in popular-
 ity, but better fitting and more colorful slacks
 remain the favorite form of dress.
 ? The number of safari jackets is increasing, and men
 are buying more boldly patterned shirts.
 Rural Consumers
 Income Growth. Since 1978 money incomes of peas-
 ants have risen at an average annual rate of almost 19
 percent (table A-5). After discounting for inflation,
 using the official price index, gains have averaged
 over 14 percent annually in real terms. During the
 past two years, however, because of inflation, the rate
 of increase in real incomes dropped by almost one-
 third from the rate recorded during 1978-79. As noted
 above, we believe that official price indexes under-
 state inflation and therefore overstate gains in real
 income. Sketchy data on commodity consumption
 suggest that consumption (and real income) gains have
 averaged around 10 percent annually during 1978-81
 (table A-6), several percentage points lower than
 implied by official Chinese data.
 Income Distribution. Despite obvious gains, the living
 standards of most Chinese peasants are still very low.

 stocks of consumer durables in table A-6 portray an
 economic group that enjoys a barely adequate diet

 The share of spending going to housing should rise as
 incomes grow, but the reported increase seems larger
 than would be expected from gains in incomes alone
 and probably reflects a strong pent-up demand. Ac-
 cording to the State Statistical Bureau, 12 percent of
 all rural households built new houses in 1981. Rural
 households averaged 4.3 rooms per household, 17
 percent more than in 1978, and floorspace averaged
 10.2 square meters per capita-over twice the average
 for city dwellers.
 That consumer durables are included in daily articles
 helps explain why spending in that category grew by
 156 percent between 1978 and 1981. As in the case of
 housing, there is also pent-up demand. The daily
 articles category also contains a wide variety of
 common household items that are now, with the rapid
 expansion of light industry, much more readily
 available.

 and little in the way of household wealth. Income
 inequalities among rural residents remain large. Sur-
 vey data indicate that three-fourths of China's peas-
 ants earned less than 150 yuan in 1980, when
 average peasant earnings were 191 yuan. With such a
 wide variation in income, the statistically average
 peasant is hard to find.
 Savings Up Sharply. Nationally, rural savings have
 tripled since 1978 (table A-7), and the portion of
 income going into savings has doubled, rising from
 slightly less than 1 percent in 1978 to about 2 percent
 in 1.981. Peasants have reacted predictably; for exam-
 ple, in some areas they have declined to produce
 additional hogs for market because there is nothing.to
 buy with the extra earnings.
 Changing Patterns of Consumption. Survey data
 issued by the State Statistical Bureau show that the
 shares of rural spending on food, clothing, fuels, and
 cultural activities and services declined between 1978
 and 1981, while the shares spent on housing and
 miscellaneous and household articles (daily articles)
 rose markedly (table A-8). To a considerable degree,
 the large decline in the share for foods (from almost
 68 percent to less than 60 percent) reflects the lack of
 a variety of more desirable foodstuffs, if not outright
 shortages of basic items. We attribute the declines in
 spending for fuels, cultural activities, and services to
 continued shortages in supplies.
 In publicizing improved living standards, Beijing has
 noted some trends not apparent in the aggregate data:
 ? Peasants have started to abandon homemade and
 handmade clothing and shoes, now preferring fac-
 tory-made goods, "which they feel are better in
 appearance;" and there has been a gradual shift in
 purchases toward better quality clothing.
 ? Farmers prefer brand-name goods, just as city
 residents do; but relatively inexpensive wristwatch-
 es, for example, are also in great demand.
 ? Small items such as pans, cauldrons, bowls, chop-
 sticks, and straw and palm fiber products are selling
 well.
 ? Although there is a big demand for children's
 clothing, the demand for toys is relatively low in
 rural areas.

 Appendix B
 This assessment is based primarily on numerous bits
 of information from a variety of official Chinese
 sources. Whenever possible we have used data re-
 leased by the State Statistical Bureau, China's princi-
 pal statistics-gathering agency. Because China's sta-
 tistical apparatus is understaffed and its personnel
 largely undertrained, Chinese economic data are fre-
 quently contradictory, incomplete, or simply inaccu-
 rate. Some of our estimates-for example, those on
 personal incomes-are subject to a greater margin of
 error than others. As the Chinese release further data,
 those data may differ slightly from our estimates, but
 the major judgments presented in this paper should
 not be affected.
