 an office electric with 4t5o luxury featureSfor 2S0 (theprice o, f a manual)
 This is the new Smith-Corona 250.
 It's quite a typewriter. It may very well
 change your ideas about office type-
 writers. It's a full-featured office elec-
 tric priced like a manual-about half
 the price of conventional electrics.
 How can it be priced so low? Engi-
 neered compactness ... a new idea in
 for the professional buyer.  I_I  It makes
 12 carbons, more than most typewrit-
 ers. The Smith-Corona 250 also offers
 more bonuses than typewriters costing
 twice as much ..  a unique half-space
 key for spacing in corrections, elec-
 tric back space and 5 electric repeat
 actions-space bar, cross-out key,
 office typewriters. Naturally, it has the hyphen, underline and dot.  11 The com-

 The more profits, the more jobs
 More than 1,250,000 additional people want jobs every year.
 In manufacturing, $20,000 investment is needed to tool up for
 each new job. That $20,000 cannot be raised out of depre-
 ciation allowances-it has to come out of profits after taxes.
 Depreciation allowances only provide part of what is
 needed to keep tools modern for present workers. So to tool
 up for every new worker and his job, companies must
 make more profit-$20,000 more for every new worker you
 want a company to employ.
 Yes, profits make jobs, and more profits are necessary for
 the more jobs America must supply.

 Fleet Buyers :
 Here are 7
 reasons why
 Fords give
 you more for
 the money
 to fit every fleet need. Ford offers a total of 51 models, including sedans, hardtops and wagons.
 Fords, middleweight Fairlanes, compact Falcons, and for special prestige, the fabulous Thunderbird.
 2. Thunderbird Styling! Thunderbird styling
 is yours throughout the entire Ford line-plus
 Thunderbird's style of engineering! This year,
 the '63 Ford has the look, the power, even the
 feel of the Thunderbird. This trend-setting styl-
 ing pays off in added company prestige and
 increased employee morale.
 5. Twice-a-Year or 6,000-Mile Service! One
 stop twice a year or every 6,000 miles will
 normally take care of everything! All of the
 '63 Fords  (except Falcon Station Bus and
 Club Wagons) go 36,000 miles between major
 chassis lubrications and 6,000 miles between
 minor lobes.
 3. More  Savings! Ford's traditionally low
 purchase price is just the beginning of your
 savings-because  you  keep  on  saving  with
 twice-a-year or 6,000-mile service intervals and
 loss maintenance. For the biggest money savings
 of all, see the '63 Falcon, America's all-time
 economy champ.
 6. Improved Quality! A $100 million Quality
 Assurance Program has enabled Ford to extend
 the warranty on these cars to cover the first
 24,000 miles or 24 months of ownership', proof
 that Fords are built to stand up under thousands
 of extra miles of the toughest kind of wear-and-
 tear driving!
 For further details, see your Ford Dealer or write: Fleet Sales Manager,
 Ford Motor Company, 2750 W. Fort Street, Detroit 16, Michigan.
 *Ford Motor Company warrants to its dealers, and its dealers, in turn, warrant to owners as follows: That
 for 24 months or for 24,000 miles (6 months or 6,000 miles on 427-cu. in. high-performance V-8 engines
 and related power train components), whichever comes first, free replacement, including related labor,
 will be made by dealers of any part with a defect in workmanship or materials. Tires are not covered
 by the warranty; appropriate adjustments will be made by tire companies. Owners will remain responsible
 for normal maintenance services, routine replacement of parts, such as filters, spark plugs, ignition points,
 wiper blades, brake or clutch linings, and normal deterioration of soft
 trim and appearance items.                                                      PRODUCTS OF   Cf.(11~Q~   MOTOR COMPANY
 4. New Durability! The '63 Fords are rugged-
 they're the best built Fords in history! There's
 greater strength and durability, thanks to top-
 quality construction throughout. Hoods, doors
 and deck lids fit to more rattle-free tolerances
 even carpets are tougher, longer lasting!
 And, mufflers are fully aluminized for long life.
 7. Better Trade-in Value! It stands to reason
 that these Fords, engineered to deliver so much
 rugged dependability, will still have plenty of
 life left in them when it comes time to trade.
 This means that you can expect a higher resale
 value than ever before ... another saving grace
 from Ford!

 The union leader?
 His constituents benefit when busi-
 ness is profitable. Therc can be no col-

 The newspaperman?
 His personal welfare depends substan-
 tially on the profitability of his paper
 -ask any man who works on a heavy
 loser.
 The mayor?
 iM   He knows that civic development can
 be realized effectively only when local
 business is operating profitably.
 The family?
 The security of the employment of
 its wage earners depends on the prof-
 itability of the businesses they work
 for.
 The baby?
 Will its future be bright or dismal?
 Rising population demands vigorous
 economic growth, which in a free so-
 ciety can be powered only by profit
 incentives.
 Who cares? All of us. Whether we recognize it
 or not, we are all affected, seriously and personally,
 by the profitability of our business enterprises. In-
 decd, only irresponsibility or indifference could char-
 acterize those who don't care. For quest of profit is
 the essence of national growth and national survival
 and an inseparable characteristic of the free society.
 Who cares about Profits?
 The investor?
 His concern is obvious. Only hope of
 reward entices his dollars from safe,
 but unproductive, hiding places.
 The government employee?
 Government services come chiefly
 from taxes on profits of corporations
 and earnings of individuals. As profits
 go down, tax revenues feel the pinch.

 When you come to that management decision on

 to remember this big "A" for Allegheny Power.
 Why? Because this company, covering a five-

 The map shows the five-state region in the center of
 America's markets ... in the center of materials for industry.
 The area has skilled labor, and training pro-

 processing now ... and in 1980 or even 2000.
 The big "A" is also a symbol of a vital point:
 objective accuracy of plant location data from

 OF  THE  WEEK
 DEFICIT ADVOCATES
 Economists Heller and Gordon
 Lead-off men in the campaign to get
 the  Administration's  tax-cut  program
 through Congress were two New Frontier
 officials who helped formulate the theory
 that a federal deficit now means a bal-
 anced budget later-
 Walter W. Heller, Chairman of the
 President's Council of Economic Advis-
 ers.
 Kermit Gordon, former member of the
 Council who took over in January as the
 new Director of the Budget.
 As members of the Council, the two
 men helped write a report last year on
 which the Administration's tax and budg-
 et policies are based. A report on these
 policies appears on page 32. Mr. Heller
 and Mr. Gordon were first to testify
 when the joint Economic Committee of
 Congress began a study of the tax-cut
 proposals.
 Mr. Gordon, a 46-year-old former eco-
 nomics professor at Williams College,
 told the  Committee that a balanced
 budget now would lead to a general eco-
 nomic  decline, bigger deficits later.
 An increase in taxes to balance the
 1964 budget, he said, "would ... depress
 production, employment and purchasing
 power. . . ." And a cut in spending, he
 said, would "tend to produce a sharp de-
 cline in gross national product which
 might even get as high as 50 or 60 bil-
 lion dollars a year. . . .
 Either way, Mr. Gordon said, unem-
 ployment would increase-probably to as
 much as "10 per cent of the labor force."
 Mr. Gordon's testimony outraged Sen-
 ator Harry F. Byrd (Dem.), of Virginia,
 chairman of the Senate Finance Com-
 mittee. He called for the removal of Mr.
 Gordon. "A man who thinks a balanced
 budget would be a catastrophe does not
 have the frame of mind to direct the
 budget of the United States Govern-
 ment," Senator Byrd said.
 Mr. Heller said the key to faster eco-
 nomic growth lay in "a sustained rise in
 demand." The tax cuts, he said, would
 do this by putting 8 billion dollars per
 year back into the disposable income of
 individuals. By 1965 or 1966, he said,
 the increased consumer spending would
 add several times 8 billion to the gross
 national product.
 Cuts in U. S. spending, however, would
 wipe out the effect of the tax reductions,
 Mr. Heller declared. "A deficit is an in-
 evitable part of the stimulus," he said.

 Dean Harlan McClure of Clemson's school of architecture talks with Harvey Gantt
 A NEW SEMESTER-A
 In South Carolina, the last holdout
 against court-enforced school integration,
 a Negro has been admitted to Clemson
 College. He is 20-year-old Harvey Gantt
 of Charleston, who won a court order
 for his admission.
 Mr. Gantt registered on January 28.
 Heavy precautions had been taken by
 State officials against disorders and vio-
 lence. But the event was accepted calmly
 by the students, and the State. And in
 the spotlight of national attention that
 turned on Mr. Gantt, he was revealed as
 a tall, serious young man, intent on get-
 ting an education.
 Son of a civilian mechanic at the
 Charleston Navy Yard, young Gantt was
 NEW NEGRO STUDENT
 raised in a religious home. He is active
 in church work, as are both his parents.
 He graduated from high school with
 honors, was a star athlete, a competent
 musician. In two years at Iowa State
 University, before quitting to attempt
 to enter Clemson, he had a B average.
 Mr. Gantt has been active in the Na-
 tional Association for the Advancement
 of Colored People, but he is not regarded
 as a zealot. His decision to seek admis-
 sion to Clemson was a personal one.
 "I am happy," he told newsmen, "to
 know that this is going to give other
 Negroes an opportunity to go to Clem-
 son. But my main purpose here is to get
 an education."
 In Mississippi, James H. Meredith de-
 cided to stick it out for another semester
 at the State university.
 The  29-year-old  crusader  for  civil
 rights is the only Negro attending a pub-
 lic school for white persons in Missis-
 sippi. He was enrolled last September un-
 der court order, and to the accompani-
 ment of rioting. For four months, U. S.
 marshals and soldiers have guarded him
 on the campus. More than 300 troops are
 still stationed there. Officials estimated it
 costs the Government $4,500 a day to
 keep him in school.
 Mr. Meredith, shunned by most stu-
 dents, harassed by some, said early in
 January he might quit. And there were
 reports that he was in scholastic trouble.
 On January 30, he told a news con-
 ference he would return to "Ole Miss."
 "I see signs," he said, "that give me
 hope. . . ... Also, his grades were appar-
 ently adequate for readmission. Next
 day, he registered without incident.

 The Shah of Iran
 "LEGAL REVOLUTION"
 Voters Support Iran's Shah
 Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi of Iran
 is a new kind of royal politician. He out-
 promises  his  political  opponents  and
 beats them at the ballot box.
 On January 26. peasants, workers and
 women turned out in droves to endorse
 the Shah's program of "legal revolution."
 The program calls for breaking up feudal
 estates ;  an  end  to  serfdom ;   profit
 sharing by industry; a vast educational
 program, and new electoral laws.
 Landowners, businessmen, some Mos-
 lem religious leaders, and politicians of
 the National Front called for a boycott
 of the referendum. There were some riots,
 some arrests. But the boycott failed. Al-
 most 5.6 million Iranians voted for the
 program, fewer than 5,000 against it.
 The Shah came to power in 1941, when
 Britain and Russia occupied Iran, forced
 his pro-German father to abdicate. He
 has survived an assassination attempt, a
 coup by nationalist Mohammed Mossa-
 degh, and constant Soviet pressure.
 Many of the key reforms had already
 been decreed, were theoretically in effect.
 The Shah himself had given away most
 of his land to peasants, endowed a foun-
 mecicine and food. Communist fighters
 are defecting at the rate of 50 a week.
 ? The Diem Government now controls
 51 our cent of the population, compared
 with no more than 30 per cent at one
 time. Some river routes closed for years
 by the Communists now are being kept
 open, and Vietnamese rice exports are on
 the rise.
 The 60-year-old naval officer has corn-
 manded U. S. forces in the Pacific since
 1958. He is the man in over-all charge
 of U. S. military efforts in Southeast
 Asia. There still are serious problems in
 Vietnam, he said. But his was the most
 optimistic official report from there Amer-
 icans had heard in some time.

 SPLIT IN FEDERAL AGENCY
 Power Commissioner Leaving
 Howard Morgan has asked President
 Kennedy not to reappoint him  to the
 Federal Power Commission. Reason: Mr.
 Morgan, a former Oregon public-utilities
 regulator, finds himself too often at odds
 with a majority of his fellow commis-
 sioners,
 Mr. Morgan was named to the Com-
 mission in 1961 for a term that expires
 next June 22. He has frequently dissented
 from FPC rulings, and his opinions in
 those cases indicated he did not think
 consumers were getting enough protec-
 tion from the FPC.
 In his letter to the President, Mr. Mor-
 gan voiced some sharp criticism of the
 FPC-and regulatory agencies generally.
 Ile warned that only men of courage,
 character  and  broad  vision  should  be
 named to such agencies.
 "Ordinary       men    cannot  administer
 'hose laws today in the face of pressures
 generated by huge industries," Mr. Mor-
 gan said. "Utility regulation ceases to be
 or never becomes a protection to the
 ,onsuming public. Instead it can easily
 become a fraud upon the public and a
 protective shield behind which monopoly
 may operate to the public detriment."
 FPC Chairman Joseph C. Swidler de-
 fended the Commission, said it had been
 .,more active and worked more for the
 public benefit in the last year and a half
 . . . than any FPC in history."

 technicians were ousted long ago and
 Indonesian   administrators  failed   to
 maintain rubber plantations or tin dredg-

 there is a pattern of mismanagement,
 inefficiency and inexperience.
 Sukarno's Indonesia owes the Soviet
 Union about 1 billion dollars-mainly
 for arms. Even the arms-happy Sukarno
 is worried about this one-sided bill and
 has shown signs of cutting down on arms
 buying. The combined debts of hnlo-
 uesia to Western nations may total an-
 other billion dollars. Funding of these
 debts now cats up nearly one quarter
 of Indonesia's annual earnings of for-
 eign exchange.
 Inside Indonesia, and particularly on
 Java, Sukarno's personal prestige and
 popularity with the masses remain high.
 At 61 the President still is a spellbinder,
 capable of swaying great crowds as the
 self-styled  "Bung   (Brother)   Karoo,

 Again and again in crises past he has
 told his people, "We don't care about in-

 BFG to the rescue
 when rubber throats
 choked up
 That sea-going tanker gulps its 41/4-million-gallon
 cargo through rubber hose. The hose is so big and
 so much of it is used, the tanker can be fully loaded
 in less than a day. But with the hose previously
 used there were problems.
 The hose strangled on some of the stuff it had to
 handle. Benzene and toluene, for example. These
 petrochemicals attacked the inside of the hose.
 They made the rubber swell and blister, then buckle
 and crack. Before long, the hose had to be replaced.
 Then BFG engineers went to work on the problem.
 They analyzed and evaluated scores of ingredients,
 experimented with many rubber compounds, and
 made dozens of tests. The outcome? An entirely
 new compound forthe hose lining. But BFG product
 improvement didn't stop there. The rest of the hose
 was redesigned, too. Using nylon cord instead of
 stiff fabric made the hose stronger, yet about 20Jo
 lighter and noticeably more flexible. The big ques-
 tion: How would the hose react in service?
 No sore throat was the verdict. The improved
 B.F.Goodrich hose has been at work on the Gulf Oil
 Corporation's docks at Port Arthur, Texas, for two
 years without showing any sign of failure from
 the corrosive petrochemicals.
 Today, B.F.Goodrich makes hose to carry just
 about anything. Fact is, we make more hose and
 more different kinds of hose than anybody else.
 And, as in the case of Gulf, when a customer needs
 a special hose to solve a problem, we go all out to
 develop one that'll do the job.
 Putting rubber, plastics, textiles or metals to work
 to help make your business better is the business
 of B. F.Goodrich. If we can be of help to you please

 >11 Looks like a bad winter for people with "grand designs."
 President de Gaulle has blocked--possibly wrecked--President Kennedy's
 "grand design" for an Atlantic community with U.S. in the driver's seat.
 Simultaneously, De Gaulle knocked galley-west Prime Minister Macmillan's
 "grand design" to make Britain a major power on the continent of Europe.
 >> Then, while all this was going on in the West--
 Khrushchev's "grand design" of a Communist empire, with himself in charge,
 fell apart when Mao Tse-tung refused to take any more orders from Moscow.
 Castro, in addition, shows signs of bucking Khrushchev's "grand design."
 Castro wants to launch one of his own for the conquest of Latin America.
 > > Sukarno is another with big ideas.  His latest "grand design"  (see page 46)
 threatens islands and sea lanes vital to the Philippines and Southeast Asia.
 Nehru is in the market for a new "grand design."  His old one--a neutralist
 bloc headed by himself--collapsed when Red China swept into India.
 Nasser has revived his "grand design" of an Arab empire.   But this time he
 is moving cautiously, sending troops into Yemen first, maybe Saudi Arabia later.
 Nkrumah of Ghana is not to be overlooked, either.  His ambitions appear to
 involve a very large chunk of Africa, with himself at the controls.
 >> It's doubtful how far the minor-league "grand designs" will get.  Big
 powers, if they will, can upset the plans of a Castro or a Sukarno.
 De Gaulle is something else again.  He plays in the major leagues.  Critics
 can't see how Europe can go it alone without U.S. to defend it, as De Gaulle's
 "grand design" implies, but many Europeans are willing to overlook this point.
 Vision of a Europe for Europeans--free of U.S. leadership, with American
 investment and influence sharply reduced--has its appeal in Europe.   It may be
 De Gaulle has chosen just the right psychological moment for an anti-U.S.  move.
 >> For example: The Paris weekly "Express," often critical of De Gaulle, on
 January 31 asked if it wasn't about time U.S. got out of Europe.
 Here's the way "Express" reasons: "Times have changed.  Now it is not so
 much the Communists, but first of all, and much more strongly, the big bankers
 who are indignant about American investments in Europe... Since the Cuban affair
 ...the Americans and the Russians have understood that nothing... is more
 important than to avoid nuclear war.... Today the great alliance...is that of
 Moscow and Washington, to impose atomic peace on the world.   They can only do it
 together, keeping for themselves the power of decision...."

 In other words: De Gaulle is justified in opposing U.S. in Europe if U.S.
 and Russia are about to make the big decisions for the world, including Europe.
 > > A De Gaulle-Khrushchevv "deal," then?  It's just a rumor, that's all.
 Actually, what De Gaulle is busy doing now is making preliminary moves to
 pull the countries of Western Europe closer together--with Paris as the hub.
 Overtures have gone from Paris to detach Denmark and Austria from Britain's
 trade group, the "Outer Seven."  These overtures are on the economic front.
 On the military front, De Gaulle is sending a mission to Franco's Spain.
 The reason: De Gaulle regards Spain as "Europe's rear guard," therefore to be
 tied into De Gaulle's concept of European defense.   So, high-ranking officers
 from Paris are going to Madrid to plan co-operation with Franco's armed forces.
 Timing of this French mission can be expensive for U.S.   It is just about
 to renegotiate agreements with Franco for U.S. bases in Spain.  Franco may be
 encouraged by De Gaulle's sudden interest in Spain to raise the ante for U.S.
 Probably this wouldn't bother De Gaulle.  He has begun work on his plan to
 push U.S. out of the Continent, make it a Europe for Europeans only.
 > > The Congo is relatively quiet.    Now trouble is brewing elsewhere in Africa.
 Battle lines are being drawn between black-controlled Northern Rhodesia and
 white-controlled Southern Rhodesia.   Britain is giving up its attempt to tie
 them together.   As a result, the remaining white governments in Africa will tend
 to close ranks against a rising tide of African nationalism moving south.
 A white alliance is talked of.  Likely members: South Africa, Portuguese
 Angola and Mozambique, plus Southern Rhodesia.
 By cable from Salisbury: "White attitudes are hardening all along the line.
 Blacks north of the line have the support of most of Africa, plus that of U.N.,
 maybe U.S. as well.   The pressure on white-run southern Africa is mounting."
 >31 At the United Nations, diplomats got a sample of what is to be expected
 from De Gaulle's France from now on out.  De Gaulle dropped a monkey wrench into
 the machinery by which the U.N. hoped to pay for its armies abroad.
 U.N. bonds, you remember, were issued to pay the costs of keeping U.N.
 forces in the Congo and in the Mideast.  U.N. members would be billed for a fair
 share of principal and interest on these bonds.   But....
 De Gaulle refused to pay the French share.  Only $300,000 was involved, out
 of more than 5 million dollars, for the French share of U.N. costs.   French
 argument is that France doesn't think a U.N. Army should be in the Congo and
 therefore won't pay.  Russia, others are likely to follow De Gaulle's lead.
 Who then will back up U.N. bonds?  U.S. has done most of it so far.
 >> U.N. military operations in the Congo, said Secretary-General Thant, are
 now at an end.   The door is open, he said, for foreign aid to the Congo.
 Almost as a postscript to this announcement came another from Congo where
 U.N. experts are looking into the Katanga National Bank.   Books examined showed
 2.8 million dollars in hard currency.  Amount actually found in the bank's
 vaults:  116.28.   Shortage is "under investigation."
 Things like this Katanga incident make dispensers of aid uneasy.  Natural
 fear is that the open door for Congo aid may turn out to be a swinging door,
 one that lets the aid go out about as fast as it comes in.

 WHAT DE GAULLE SEES AHEAD
 Why did De Gaulle slam the
 door to Europe on Britain?
 From those close to him: The
 French President is looking far
 into the future. He sees changes
 coming-in Russia and in the
 U. S. So his goal is to build a
 "Europe for the Europeans."
 PARIS
 Charles de Gaulle, in the aftermath
 of his victory in repelling Britain's bid
 to join the European Common Market,
 is described as being "serene."
 France's President is said to be confi-
 dent that the crisis he set off will die
 down with time; that the Common Mar-
 ket may shudder but will not break up.
 In the end, De Gaulle feels, his position
 will be recognized as right and neces-
 sary for the creation of a truly united
 Europe.
 Many people ask:  "Why does De
 Gaulle seem bent on shattering the very
 unity in Europe that he claims to be
 working toward?" The answer you get
 from officials close to him is this:
 "You must understand that De Gaulle
 is not a wily politician. He could have
 let the negotiations in Brussels drag on
 indefinitely until Britain was forced to
 break them off. There still were enor-
 mous difficulties to solve which we be-
 lieve were insurmountable for Britain at
 this time. But De Gaulle decided to end
 it. That's his style-attributable, in part,
 to his military background."
 French officials emphasize that De
 Gaulle is not excluding Britain from the
 Common Market for all time. In his
 view, however, Britain is not ready eco-
 nomically or politically to participate
 without reservations in the building of
 the Europe that he has in mind.
 Moreover, he is convinced that Britain
 will not be ready for Europe until the
 British break off their "special relation-
 ship" with the United States.
 Pique over missiles. Britain's "spe-
 cial relationship" with the U. S. took on
 new meaning for De Gaulle when Prime
 Minister Macmillan at Nassau last De-
 cember agreed to accept American Po-
 laris missiles and put its own nuclear
 weapons  under  the  North  Atlantic
 Treaty  Organization. De  Gaulle was
 quoted recently as saying: "Britain has
 agreed to turn its nuclear force into the
 hands of the U. S. She could have given
 it to Europe. Well, she has chosen."
 Those close to the French President
 say he was struck by the fact that on a
 vital matter of defense Britain made a
 long-term commitment within a few
 days. Yet, Britain had been haggling on
 economic matters in the Common Mar-
 ket negotiations for 16 months without,
 in French eyes, much progress being
 made.
 Observers here get the impression that
 De Gaulle somehow expected Britain to
 offer to work with France in the creation
 of a purely European nuclear force out-
 side NATO. When Macmillan, instead,
 chose to intensity co-operation with the
 U. S. in the nuclear field, De Gaulle
 decided to act.
 There is an economic side to the
 French position, too. Long before Brit-
 ain made the Polaris deal with the
 U. S., French officials frankly said they
 preferred that Britain enter the Common
 Market at a later date. The reason: The
 sudden arrival of Britain, followed by
 other candidates, would in the French
 view wreck the careful structure of eco-
 nomic integration.
 French spokesmen talk about the
 "dilution" Britain's entry would have

 "U.S. GO HOME?" This ban-
 ner headline appeared in the
 Paris weekly "L'Express" on Jan-
 uary 31 over a full-page picture
 of President Kennedy. Editorial
 in "L'Express" said: "Let no one
 have  any  illusions  about  it:
 France ... is behind De Gaulle."
 caused in Europe. Thus, De Gaulle feels
 himself to be the defender of Europe
 against a Britain which would have been
 nothing more than a "Trojan horse" of
 American economic and political dom-
 ination.
 The upshot is that De Gaulle expects
 Britain to enter a period of great diffi-
 culty. He foresees a Labor Government
 returning to power-only to fall in a few
 years, proving that there really is no
 workable alternative to joining Europe.
 Then, as De Gaulle sees it, a govern-
 ment headed by progressive, young
 Conservatives  would  emerge-capable
 and willing to transform Britain and take
 it into a united Europe.
 A  U. S.  withdrawal?  Behind  all
 these Gaullist predictions is a long-range
 vision-10 to 15 years ahead-of the
 way the world is moving. De Gaulle be-
 lieves it inevitable that the U. S. will
 sooner or later disengage from its com-
 mitments in Europe. Ile believes the
 NATO alliance, created in 1949, is com-
 pletely out of date. Since then, the
 whole power relationship between Eu-
 rope and the U. S. has changed.
 De Gaulle has long insisted that Rus-
 sia will become more moderate, so that
 some kind of East-West agreement will
 become possible. That's what he means
 when he talks of a Europe "from the At-
 lantic to the Urals."
 Will De Gaulle now make a deal with
 Russia's Khrushchev? French officials
 point to his rigidly anti-Communist rec-
 ord, his support of the U. S. on Cuba, his
 opposition to concessions to the Russians
 in negotiations on Berlin. Ile  hasn't
 changed, these officials say.
 It's often asked where the U. S. fits
 into this Gaullist picture. The answer
 is that first priority in De Gaulle's mind
 is to get rid of American influence on
 the Continent so that Europe "can make
 itself." But he reportedly favors an alli-
 ance with the U. S. as long as it's under-
 stood that Europe-under French lead-
 ership-is free to go its own way.
 Right now, De Gaulle faces isolation.
 He does not believe it will last. If only
 for geographical reasons, not much can
 be done in Europe without France.
 For the immediate future there seems
 to be little that the U. S, can do to dis-
 suade De Gaulle. He regards U. S. ef-
 forts to form an Atlantic community as
 the "kiss of death" for a truly independ-
 ent Europe. If and when anyone can
 change De Gaulle's mind, it will be
 Europeans, not Americans.

 IF IT'S ROCKEFELLER
 VS. KENNEDY IN 1964
 Politicians already are counting the 1964 vote, State by State. They agree that
 Governor Rockefeller has a tall job ahead if he is to unseat President Kennedy.
 This analysis of trends in key areas shows why.
 ---Magnum Photo
 BEST BET for the Republican presidential nomination in 1964: Governor Nelson
 A. Rockefeller of New York. But it's almost certain that a fight will develop.
 more and more it's being taken for
 granted that in 1961, the race for the
 Presidency will be between: Nelson A.
 Rockefeller of Nev.- York for the Repub-
 licans and John F. Kennedy of Massa-
 chusetts for the Democrats.
 President Kennedy will be renomi-
 nated  without  challenge.  Governor
 Rockeleller's victory at the Republican
 Convention will not come so easily.
 Richard M. Nixon appears to have re-
 moved himself from the running. Gov-
 ernor George Homney of Michigan and
 Governor \Villiam \V. Scranton of Penn-
 sylvania have a scant year and a half in
 which to establish themselves, and Mr.
 Romncy in 1964 will have re-election
 problems of his own.
 That leaves only one Republican who
 might have' it chance to challenge Mr.
 Rockefeller for the nomination. Ile is
 Barry  Goldwater,  the  "conservative"
 Senator from Arizona.
 Senator Goldwater, however, comes
 up for re-election to the Senate in 1964.
 Under Arizona law he may not run for
 both the Presidency and the Senate.
 Mat iv Republicans keep referring to
 the Arizona Senator as the "ideal vice-
 presidential  nominee."  Senator  Gold-
 water, however, has said flatly that he is
 not interested in second place on a Rock-
 efeller ticket.
 A party trend?  Meanwhile, there
 are stirrings within the Republican Party
 which suggest to many of its leaders
 that it "conservative" trend may be run-
 ning within the party.
 Opposition to foreign aid is growing.
 There is little enthusiasm for constant
 expansion of Government spending, with
 budgets-and deficits-that do not stop
 increasing. Public opposition to big, long
 strikes scums to offer an issue to such a
 "conservative  as Mr. Goldwater.
 The Senator has cultivated the "con-
 servatives"  of  the  South.  Reportedly
 there is much support for him there and
 in the Border States. Goldwater enthusi-
 asts think that, running against President
 Kennedy, the Senator might pick up
 125 or so electoral votes in those areas.

 They see additional votes to be had
 in New England, the Middle West and
 Mountain areas. But even if the Senator
 should score heavily in these States, as
 neutral observers see it, he still would
 be short of the 270 electoral votes
 needed to win the election,
 "Big" States. The consensus is that
 Senator Goldwater would have to score
 in several of the big industrial States,
 with large electoral totals. It is in these
 States that Mr. Kennedy is strongest.
 All this, in any event, is conditioned
 upon Senator Goldwater's winning the
 nomination. Here, general opinion is, he
 would run into a formidable obstacle.
 The Republican Party and its conven-
 tions came under the control of Repub-
 lican "liberals" with the nomination of
 Wendell L. Willkie in 1940. Thomas E.
 Dewey and Dwight D. Eisenhower de-
 feated Senator Robert A. Taft. Richard
 M. Nixon became acceptable to the "lib-
 erals" and, in 1960, he adapted his pro-
 gram-over Mr. Goldwater's objections
 -to the ideas of Mr. Rockefeller.
 The latter now is acceptable to the
 "liberals" and also to numerous "con-
 servative" party leaders who might actu-
 ally prefer Senator Goldwater, but see
 the New York Governor as the more
 probable winner.
 Totting  up  figures-. Those close
 to Mr. Rockefeller, and the Governor
 himself, are busy figuring out a combi-
 nation of States that would give him the
 needed 270 electoral votes.
 Usually, they begin with Mr. Rocke-
 feller's own State, New York. It has 43
 electoral votes, biggest of all, The Gov-
 ernor, of course, is well known. He has
 been elected twice there.
 Now the Democratic organization in
 New York City is in disrepair, torn by
 internal feuding. The Republican or-
 ganization is firmly based on the party's
 control of the State government.
 Nevertheless, the expectation that Mr.
 Rockefeller would win in New York is
 firmly disputed in knowledgeable polit-
 ical circles. The State will be one of the
 great battlegrounds of 1964.
 Next, Rockefeller strategists turn to
 Pennsylvania and its 29 electoral votes.
 Mr. Kennedy carried the State in 1960
 by 116,326 votes, getting 51.2 per cent
 of the total cast-a close result.
 Governor Scranton replaced a Demo-
 cratic  predecessor  last  autumn.  This
 gives the Republicans an opportunity to
 beef up their organization with extensive
 State patronage. Democrats are feuding
 in Philadelphia, and a blowup is ex-
 pected.  Pennsylvania will be another
 battleground of 1964. With New York
 and Pennsylvania, Mr. Rockefeller would
 have 72 electoral votes.
 In Ohio, the Rockefeller forces have

 every reason to expect a victory. The
 State has 26 electoral votes. Richard M.
 Nixon carried Ohio by 273,363 votes in
 1960. Last year a Republican defeated
 the incumbent Democratic Governor,
 giving the astute Republican State chair-
 man, Ray Bliss, a base for strengthening
 his already strong organization. Add
 Ohio, and the Rockefeller total is 98.
 President Kennedy took Illinois in
 1960 with a bare margin of 8,858 votes.
 The big-city organization of Richard J.
 Daley in Chicago has weakened. Repub-
 licans are confident about 1964. The
 State has 26 electoral votes, which
 would give the Governor 124.
 Problem States. Rockefeller forces
 are aiming somewhat uncertainly at a
 prize of 21 electoral votes in Michigan.
 To win they would have to defeat the
 determined efforts of the United Auto-
 mobile Workers and the AFL-CIO. With

 Next year, they may be facing each other in the presidential election.
 labor's help Mr. Kennedy took Michigan
 by 66,841 votes in 1960. Mr. Romney's
 victory, by 78,500 votes, last autumn was
 considered more. personal than political.
 In the same election a Democratic
 Representative-at-large was elected. The
 consensus is that Mr. Rockefeller has his
 work cut out for him, but with Michigan
 his total would be 145.
 In California, with 40 electoral votes,
 both sides will go all out. Opinions differ
 as to which will win, but are dominantly
 pro-Kennedy.
 Mr. Rockefeller has problems in Cali-
 fornia, where he is not too well known.
 There is a continuing row between-Re-
 publican rightists and those who are
 more to the middle of the road. The
 Democratic organization, despite some
 bickering, is anchored to the Democratic
 State administration.
 Some suggest that Mr. Rockefeller
 might help himself by making Senator
 Thomas H. Kuchel, a popular figure, his
 vice-presidential running mate, or by
 turning to Governor Mark O. Hatfield
 of neighboring Oregon.
 California went to Richard M. Nixon
 by 35,623 votes out of more than 6.4
 million cast in 1960.
 These six big-city States will cast a
 total of 185 electoral votes in 1964. In
 all except Ohio and perhaps Illinois,
 there are serious doubts that Mr. Rocke-
 feller can defeat Mr. Kennedy.
 It is in these States that Mr. Kennedy
 perhaps is strongest. The electorate in-
 cludes millions of low-income voters, la-
 bor, Negroes, people of the Jewish faith,
 ethnic minorities to whom the Presi-
 dent's appeal is strong. There also are
 many Roman Catholics. Politicians ex-
 pect the latter to stand by the President,
 On the West Coast, Oregon, with 6
 electoral votes, has Republican tenden-
 cies in national elections. Washington
 State, 9 votes, veers from side to side.
 Hawaii, 4 votes, went Democratic in
 1960, and Alaska, 3 votes, went Repub-
 lican-both by a hair.
 Even if Mr. Rockefeller should take
 all six big-city States, the smaller States
 credited to him would leave his total a
 little short of the 270 needed for a ma-
 jority in the Electoral College. He would
 look to the South and the Border States
 to make up the deficiency.
 South: an enigma. What the South
 might do in 1964 is a politicians' enigma.
 Southerners like neither Mr. Rockefeller
 nor Mr. Kennedy because of their em-
 phatic stands on Negro rights.
 Nevertheless, expectations are that
 Virginia, 12 votes, and Florida, 14, might
 go to Mr. Rockefeller, with the possible
 addition of North Carolina, 13 votes.
 This would put him over.
 Politicians  say  that  Mr.  Kennedy
 could count on Georgia and Arkansas
 and that the Catholic vote makes him
 formidable in Louisiana. They also see
 his  strength  growing  in Tennessee,
 which he lost in 1960-mainly, politi-
 cians think, on the religious issue. Texas
 now is generally credited to Mr. Ken-
 nedy. The Texas Poll of January 20 gives
 Mr. Kennedy 60 per cent, Mr. Rocke-
 feller 29, with 11 per cent undecided.
 Along the border, Mr. Kennedy is re-
 ported well entrenched in Maryland and
 West Virginia and gaining strength in
 Kentucky and Oklahoma.
 Politicians,  studying  these  figures,
 think one conclusion is obvious: To win,
 Mr. Rockefeller must score somewhat

 KENNEDY'S LATEST PLAN
 FOR AID TO SCHOOLS
 What about the Kennedy Ad-
 ministration's omnibus education
 bill for '63-will it fare any bet-
 ter than last year's?
 Here's a look at the latest mul-
 tibillion-dollar aid plan, item by
 item, and how it is being received
 in Congress.
 As with his tax plan, President Ken-
 ncdv has thrown into his school-aid plan
 just about every idea his advisers have
 hoeii able to think tip.
 Many items of the President's school-
 aid program already are in trouble with
 Congress. Of two dozen-with a price
 tag of 5 to 6 billions over a three-year
 period-the big new item most likely to
 get approval is the one providing federal
 aid to build college classrooms.
 Rua down the list and you find few
 other school-aid ideas that are not in
 trouble. As key Congressmen see it-
 Aid for teachers' pay. This one faces
 intense  opposition  because  parochial
 schools would not benefit and for other
 reasons. Passage is highly doubtful.
 Aid for construction. Together with
 teacher aid, this idea would cost 1.5 bil-
 lions, making it the most costly of the
 new proposals.  Federal money would
 help build public elementary and high
 schools in needy areas. Again, the re-
 ligious issue is a factor. Parochial schools
 want to share. There's also pressure to
 tie on an amendment requiring inte-
 gration in the new schools. Seems dead.
 Help for equipment. Idea is to con-
 tinue  the present program  of subsidy
 for science, mathematics and language-
 teaching   equipment   for   secondary
 schools. Opposition unlikely.
 Aid for impacted areas. Extension of
 it current program to subsidize public
 schools in areas inundated by military
 families and federal workers seems as-
 sured. Cost: 1.5 billions over four years.
 But proposed changes, including addi-
 tion of Washington, D. C., to subsidy
 areas. are running into trouble.
 Grants for junior colleges. Outright
 federal grants are proposed here,  to
 pay up to half the cost of building and
 equipping new,  two-year "community
 colleges. The idea has considerable sup-
 port, but serious questions are raised as
 to why grants are involved instead of
 loans, as in the case of four-year colleges.
 l.'neertain as of now.
 College building loans. Proposed are
 I ederal loans of up to I billion dollars
 aver three years, to help finance aca-
 dcmic buildings.  Unless the religious
 ssue blocks it, this proposal appears to
 have a good chance.
 Loans to students. Idea is to expand
 v 50 per cent the present national de-
 -USN&Wtt Photo
 CAMPUS ADDITION-Congress may ap-
 prove loans to build college classrooms
 tense student-loan plan. Fair chance of
 passage, unless talk of adding free schol-
 arship grants adds controversy.
 Insurance for bank loans. This plan-
 for federal backing to underwrite pri-
 vate loans from banks or colleges to
 students-has  gotten  nowhere  in  the
 past. Its chances of being approved this
 time are uncertain.
 "Work and study" program. Thisisa
 new proposal. The U. S. would pay half
 of student wages for part-time campus
 jobs. Little enthusiasm sparked in Con-
 gress thus far.
 Graduate fellowships. Idea is to in-
 crease the number of federal fellow-
 ships from 1,500 to 10,000 annually,
 and add 2,000 summer-session fellow-
 ships. F.ach pays $2.000 to $2,400 a year.
 Has some chance, but considered too big
 a jump by many.
 Technical schools. Donations of fed-
 eral  money  are  envisioned  here,  to
 pay half the cost of building, equipping
 two-year, college-level schools to turn
 out technicians in engineering, science
 and health fields. Relatively new idea,
 its reception still uncertain.
 Aid for college libraries. A new Gov-
 ernment subsidy is proposed to build li-
 braries on campuses, stock them with
 books. Little reaction to this one.
 Graduate-school grants. Federal do-
 nations here would cover half the cost
 of  building  or  expanding  university
 graduate schools. First response in Con-
 gress: Why not loans, like those pro-
 posed for undergraduate buildings?
 Language centers. Proposed is a 50
 per cent increase in a current program
 for language studies in colleges. Both
 public and private institutions eligible.
 Approval likely.
 Community libraries. This one is a
 new idea: federal funds for new libaries
 in cities and towns across the U. S. No
 quick approval foreseen.
 More extension courses. Off-campus
 education would be expanded by financ-
 ing bigger extension-course programs by
 land-grant  colleges,  State  universities.
 Such a plan got nowhere last year, has
 an uncertain outlook now.
 Aid for adult education. Small fed-
 eral grants are proposed for programs of
 education up to the eighth grade for
 adults. Crowded out last year, proposal
 now has a 50-50 chance.
 Handicapped children. Grants of fed-
 eral money would provide special train-
 ing for teachers of deaf, blind, retarded
 and otherwise handicapped children. No
 real opposition; relatively little money
 involved.
 Vocational education. Half again as
 much federal aid is proposed to spur
 vocational training. Not controversial at
 this time.
 Teacher training. Several proposals
 are involved:  (1) Direct payments to
 teachers to help pay for further school-
 ing. (2) Grants to colleges to expand
 teacher-training facilities. (3) Some spe-
 cialized training programs. (4) An ex-
 panded  program  to help prospective
 teachers finance their education. Pros-
 pects seem to be tied in with bigger
 school-aid programs, now in trouble in
 most cases.                              [END]

 "Profit?
 .Who needs it!"
 T O MANY AMERICANS these days, `Profit' has become
 an almost evil word. Yet everyone in the country
 favors a fast rate of growth for the U.S. economy. This
 is like being for transportation but against the wheel.
 Under our system, you simply can't have economic
 growth or material progress without profits.
 T AKE UNION OIL'S CASE. During the last 10 years, the
 public. demand for petroleum products in our mar-
 keting territory has grown from 885,000 barrels per day
 to 1,215,000. To keep pace with these growing needs,
 Union Oil has had to invest some $280,000,000 in refin-
 ing, marketing and distribution facilities alone. To say
 nothing of the even larger amounts we have invested in
 the search for more oil and gas reserves.
 HERE DID WE GET THE MONEY to do this? Part of
 Wit came from funds set aside to replace worn out
 facilities. Part of it came from net profits - slightly more
 than half of which we customarily plow back into the
 business each year. And part of it we borrowed. But, in
 any case, these necessary facilities would have been
 impossible without profits.
 Union Oil Company of California
 SO WOULD A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. Taxes on profits
 of U. S. corporations provide our Federal Govern-
 ment enough revenue each year to pay the entire
 costs of operating the Departments of Agriculture,
 Commerce, Health Education and Welfare, Labor and
 State; plus the Atomic Energy Commission, C.A.B.,
 F.H.A., Veterans Administration and the National
 Aeronautics and Space Administration.
 W ITHOUT PROFITS, all our nation's research and
 development on new and improved products
 would falter. In fact, practically every product your
 family uses owes its existence to profits. And every one
 of the 681/2 million jobs in the country-public or
 private - is dependent on profits.
 O WHEN YOU'RE TALKING about our nation's eco-
 S nomic growth and welfare, profit is not just a part
 of the system, it is the very foundation of the entire
 American economy. You simply can't have one without
 the other.

 2300 N Street, N.W.
 Washington, D.C.
 Business activity is climbing, but slowly.  That's the latest report of
 the Commerce Department after scanning the record for December, early January.
 People's income continues to show gains.   In January there was a sharp jump
 because of payments of dividends on veterans' life insurance.
 Rising incomes, however, are about the only sign of substantial advance.
 Industrial production has been level for seven months.
 Factory shipments of durable goods showed little change.  Orders for
 durables, however, showed a dip in December.
 Retail sales are running at a record clip but show few gains.
 It's this sluggishness that the Kennedy Administration hopes to overcome by
 tax cuts and federal spending.   Improvement will not come quickly, however, as a
 result of these devices, even if Congress approves.
 Nonfarm employment in January totaled 61.7 million.  That was down a little
 more than seasonally from the December total of 63.5 million.  After seasonal
 adjustment, the Labor Department notes that nonfarm employment has shown little
 change since last May.   That's another sign of sluggishness.
 Unemployment in January was 4.7 million, against 3.8 million in December.
 Rise in number of jobless was a little more than usual for the season.
 Unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, was 5.8 per cent of the labor
 force, against 5.6 per cent in December--not a great change.               1962.
 Unemployment in January, 1963, was at the same rate as in January,
 As far as the problem of the jobless is concerned, there was no improvement
 over the year.  And little improvement is expected for the months ahead.
 Total output in 1962 came to 554 billions, up 35 billions or almost 7 per
 cent from 1961   Output this year is estimated at 578 billions, for a gain of a
 little more than 4 per cent.  That will not be enough to get the plant use,
 production and employment that the Kennedy planners want.  Official view, in
 brief, is that economic sluggishness will not be corrected this year.
 Moderate improvement in business is reported for January by the National
 Association of Purchasing Agents.  That is about what was expected.
 Production gained, but the purchasing agents said the advance slowed.
 New orders  however, are reported by the purchasing agents to be running
 ahead of production.  That's regarded as a healthy sign.   Orders had been
 smaller than production for three months.
 Order gains are a sign that plants will be kept busy in the future.  Drops
 in the backlog often signal drops ahead in output.
 Inventory trimming, which had been going on since June, came to a halt in
 January.  The purchasing agents said that, while some 23 per cent of firms

 reporting were still cutting back stocks, an equal number were building stocks.
 Chances are that more inventory building will be done as industrial buyers
 begin to hedge against the possibility of strikes.  Purchasing agents, however,
 still seem to be cautious in making forward commitments.
 Construction industry continues at near-boom levels.
 Total new construction in January ran at a rate of 62.6 billions a year,
 after seasonal adjustment.  That was a gain of 1 per cent above December and
 5.8 per cent above a year earlier.
 Private building activity accounted for the January increase.   The gain
 was sparked by a rise, seE-.sonally adjusted, in residential building.  Home
 building, in fact, was at a record for the month, 13.6 per cent ahead of a year
 earlier.  Other private building also gained in January, after slipping for four
 successive months.   Industrial building continued to decline.
 Public construction dipped in January for the third successive month.
 Activity in public building was down 10.6 per cent from the October record
 and 2.7 per cent below a year earlier.  Drop in highwa  building accounts for
 most of the decline in public works.
 Outlook is for declines in building activity over the next month or two
 because of the bitter winter.  Return of milder weather should bring a large
 gain in public construction and perhaps a moderate upturn in housing starts.
 Orders for cutting-type tools rose 10 per cent in December to the highest
 point in 13 months.   Shipments in fourth quarter were the highest since 1957.
 Bookings for fabricated structural steel also rose in December.   The
 American Institute of Steel- Construction reported the highest volume of orders
 since January, 1956.  December shipments were high.
 Rising orders for tools and structural steel may indicate that business
 firms are raising their sights on investments.   If so, the improvement in
 general business activity this year may be greater than now is expected.

 When Algonquin Marine found that the costs of shipping its wrap-around,

 Bostitch stapling for a solution. By using a flat, scored corrugated board
