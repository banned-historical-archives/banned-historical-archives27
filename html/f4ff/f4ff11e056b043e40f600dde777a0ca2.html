 Principal Developments in World Communist Affairs
 (14 December 1968-22 January 1969)
 1.   Czechoslovakia -- Unity vs. Division
 a.       Leadership vs. People
 Soviet strategy since the invasion has been to break up the powerful
 unity (unique in a Communist country) which had been formed between the
 Czechoslovak Communist leadership and the people during the first eight
 months of 1968.  By forcing the four most prominent and popular Czech
 leaders -- Party Chief Aleksander Dubcek, Premier Otto Cernik, President
 Ludvik Svoboda, and National Assembly (parliament) President Josef Smrkovsky
 -- to execute Soviet requirements, the Soviets are driving a wedge between
 leaders and people.   It weakens people and leaders alike and subjects the
 latter to manipulation, or removal, by the Soviets without serious reper-
 cussion.   It may be that these leaders are motivated by their same earlier
 objectives of achieving a "humane," progressive form of Communism, but
 this must seem an academic, unrealistic distinction to the increasingly
 disillusioned populace, which has seen the emasculation of the once prom-
 ising Action Program of reform.  Further, the Party Politburo and its Ex-
 ecutive Committee (a kind of super-politburo), on which all four of the
 main leaders sit, have shown signs of dissension, partly because some of
 their newer  members are better disposed toward the Soviets to begin with
 and push for more rapid and forceful measures to control popular opposition.
 b.   Federalization as a Divisive Issue
 One feature of the Action Program was realized on 1 January 1969:
 the federalization of Czechoslovakia, which divides the country into semi-
 autonomous Czech and Slovak states, each having several independent min-
 isterial powers, with key ministries such as foreign policy, defense, etc.
 remaining on the federal level.   The move.raises the prestige and stand-
 ing of the Slovaks vis-a-vis the Czech state of Bohemians and Moravians,
 who have traditionally evoked the envy and hostility of the Slovaks because
 of their higher standard of living, based on more advanced industrializa-
 tion.  While federalization, in principle, tries to "equalize" the two
 halves of Czechoslovakia, thus far it has merely resulted in highlighting
 the animosities between them.   Although in the long run it should serve
 its best purposes, at this important juncture it has served only to add
 another divisive note to the scene.
 c.   Unity of Workers, Students, and Writers
 On the occasion of federalization, the issue of a president for the
 new bi-cameral Federal Assembly came up, with the Slovaks insisting he be
 one of their own.   This meant that Smrkovsky, as head of the current Na-
 tional Assembly, would have to step down. Smrkovsky, being one of the
 last leaders still to speak out frankly on issues rankling in the public
 mind, was regarded as something of a hero, a symbol of liberalization
 and resistance to Soviet demands.   Mass support in the form of trade

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400020012-4
 unions representing more than a million workers, plus students and
 writers, rallied behind Smrkovsky, threatening a nation-wide strike if
 he were removed from his post -- a move which his supporters felt would
 be not only a demotion, but also a prelude to stripping him of all his
 important official positions.  The Czech leadership (and presumably the
 Soviets as well) took heed of the threat and found a satisfactory compro-
 mise solution whereby Smrkovsky is to occupy the newly created post of
 vice-president of the Federal Assembly and president of one of the two
 houses of the Assembly.   (Smrkovsky also made a personal plea to his
 supporters to refrain from demonstrating in his behalf.)  He also re-
 tains his important Party posts as member of the Politburo and its Ex-
 ecutive Committee.  It seems quite likely that this display of popular
 unity saved Smrkovsky's political life, and one can hope that the trade
 unions' new consciousness of their strength (especially in conjunction
 with students and other groups) will continue to find practical effect
 and means of expression.  The danger, of course, is that the Soviets will
 take whatever drastic measures they see fit in order to eradicate this
 new focus of competition to the Communist Party.
 d,  The Palach Incident
 On 16 January a young student, Jan Palach, set fire to himself in
 protest to the oppression of Czechoslovakia; he died the following Sunday.
 This tragic, desperate act gave rise to a new show of popular unity and
 a great crescendo of sympathy expressed by the quiet marching of more
 than 100,000 citizens, led by students and professors, in the streets
 of Prague.  The protest character of the demonstration was unmistakable.
 It prompted an impassioned plea by President Svoboda that young people
 of the country refrain from public demonstrations lest riots ensue,
 which could mean lives lost and the fall of the Dubcek regime.  It is
 not known whether Svoboda spoke as the result of a direct Soviet warning
 to him, but the disorder is so widespread that it could easily call
 forth more drastic measures by the nervous Soviets.  Some view the situa-
 tion as critical.
 2.  Some Mysteries of Communist China
 a.  Cultural Revolution Fading Away Violently
 While the Chinese Communist leadership tries more or less consist-
 ently to slow down the momentum of the "Great Proletarian Cultural Rev-
 olution" and its engine -- the youthful terrorist thugs known as the
 Red Guard -- violence and strife characterize much of the vast Chinese
 countryside, giving it an aura of anarchy, to a considerable degree
 beyond the control of Peking.  While information is increasingly diffi-
 cult to acquire, it appears that Mao and his group will continue to have
 difficulty in stopping the momentum of this lumbering Frankenstein
 monster,         if indeed the leadership is united on the desirablility
 of stopping it.  Having wrecked considerable segments of the Party in
 the provinces, it has set loose all kinds of violent struggles for

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400020012-4
 power throughout China among local Party leaders, army personalities,
 and Red Guardists.  It seems certain that this struggle is duplicated
 at the very center of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) around Mao,
 though exactly who is cutting whose throat is a matter hidden even more
 deeply from the world.
 China exploded its eighth nuclear device (three megatons) on
 27 December.  The last previous successful explosion (also three mega-
 tons) was in June 1967.  It may be that the Cultural Revolution even
 took its toll in this vital area inasmuch as December 1967 saw an un-
 successful attempt to explode a similar device.
 d.  Long Delayed Ninth Party Congress in the Offing
 Besides the signs that the Cultural Revolution is being bridled,
 there are a few other tenuous indications that the Chinese want a return
 to what passes for normalcy in that land.  The long-rumored (and ten
 years overdue) CCP Congress will be convened sometime in 1969.  The main
 objective seems to be to rebuild the wrecked Communist Party and restore
 it to itts, position of primacy in ruling China.  Timing of the Congress
 may also be intended to damage the effect of Moscow's World Conference
 in May.  A draft of the new Party Constitution has become available
 (see attachment).  Oddities in China are to be expected and the new
 draft fulfills expectations in this respect:  in an unprecedented pro-
 cedure, it names Mao's successor -- Lin Piao, Defense Minister and Mao's
 closest collaborator during recent years.  Also, it decrees that membership
 in various Party organs, including the Central Committee, will be de-
 cided not by election, nor even by appointment; members are to be "produced."
 Considering the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and the
 fierce factionalism it has caused throughout the Party from top to bottom,
 and further considering some of the oddities of the draft constitution,
 the unusually long absence of the top Party leaders from public view
 has fed speculation that a huge shake-up or change has taken place, or
 is taking place, at the very apex of the Party, and that the change
 could involve Mao Tse-tung, who at the age of 75 is at all times a
 candidate for physical or political demise.  In theilack of more evidence,
 only time will tell whether such speculation is justified.
 3.  Western CP's Accept Soviet Invasion
 The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia was condemned immediately and
 vigorously by most free world Communist Party leaders, and since then
 it 'has been an irritant between the CPSU and important parties, like the
 Italian Communist Party (PCI), and the French Communist Party (PCF).  Tht
 issue caused difficulty to Soviet efforts to convene their long-planned
 World Communist Conference and eventually caused its postponement from
 November 1968 to May 1969.  Gradually the righteous voices of indignation
 subsided under Soviet pressure.  N   the typical position of European
 parties, including the important PCF and PCT, is that they still

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400020012-4
 disapprove of the invasion, but by a curious form of doublethink approve
 of the CPSU and the Soviet Union!  It is as if the nasty Czechoslovak
 incident existed in a vacuum, a thing apart, with no implications
 whatsoever concerning the real nature of the CPSU.  These parties have
 all but knuckled under to the Soviet Union.
 They prefer to forget that the invasion of Czechoslovakia violates
 not only norms of international law, but the Communists' own laws and
 principles of independence, sovereignty, and non-interference in domes-
 tic affairs of others.  The Soviets, having recognized their own viola-
 tion, conveniently modified their basic principle by means of the no-
 torious Brezhnev-Kovalev doctrine of super-sovereignty, whereby alle-
 giance to the Soviet Union supersedes all other loyalties and principles.
 While the Soviets have at least tried to explain their invasion by re-
 course to new doctrine, the sycophantic Western CP's have not even
 bothered to uphold their stand, preferring to bury the contradictions.
 If these parties were to be as candid as they claim to be, they
 might add that they approve of the CPSU not just because it is Lenin's
 party and the power center of the World Communist Movement, but also be-
 cause it is the source of a substantial portion of the funds on which
 they subsist.  The virtually unanimous and unqualified approval of the
 CPSU by Latin American and Near East CP's has its explanation largely in
 the fact that they could not exist without Soviet money, and obviously
 they will not bite the hand that feeds them.  The practical matter of
 material support and financial solvency has overcome all ideological
 scruples, though the high-flown rhetoric continues.  Ultimately their
 existence depends on this Soviet material support, and in 'return the
 soviet Union receives their political support as tools bf Soviet foreign
 policy.

 feit all we have achieved since
 last January."
 As an example of something
 overstepping acceptable limits,
 Dubcek chose the campaign by
 progressives  and  others
 launched against the proposal
 of Gustav Husak, the First Sec?
 retary of the Slovak Communist
 Party,  that  Smrkovsky,  who
 headed the old unicameral Na-
 tional Assembly, be denied the
 presidency of the newly consti-
 tuted Federal Assembly. Itusak
 said one of the three top federal
 posts should be held by a
 Slovak.
 On Tuesday, the Czcchoslo
 vak  Party Presidium pro
 posed that Slovak  moderaU
 Petr Colotka become the presi-
 dent of the Federal Assembly
 and that Smrkovsky become his
 first deputy. This seemed to
 put an effective end to the pro-
 S m r k o v s k y campaign, al-
 though the two newly created
 houses of parliament must still
 vote on the leadership.
 Two Are Friends
 Dubeek himself pointed out
 that Colotka and Smrkovsky
 are close personally and would
 co-operate in the legislative
 work.

 L'
 st trade union in Czechoslo-
 vakia yielded today to pres-
 ?ures  from  the  Communist
 arty's leadership and decided
 gninst a 'strike in support of
 osef Smrovsky, an  active
 pf democratic re-
 upporter 'Po!'
 orms who is opposed by the
 oviet Union..
 The Union of Metal Workers,
 ith more than 900,000 meb?
 ers, tried one last tactic, how-
 ver, in an effort to save . Mr.
 mrkovsky, chairman of the
 utgoing  national  assembly,
 rom being demoted to a sec-
 nd-level post.
 After a two-day meeting, It
 tuggestcd a , "democratic elec-
 ton" In the two-chamber feder-
 al Assembly being formed here
 s part of the creation of the
 zech-Slovak federal republic.
 An election by the nearly
 50 Deputies would pit Mr.
 'mrkovsky a Czech, against
 )r. Peter Colotka. a Slovak
 :hosen by the party's Presidium
 o become the federal Assem-
 ly's chairman. As a compro-
 isc,                the Presidium recom-
 mended  that  Mr.  Smrkov-.
 ky he appointed first deputy
 hairman of the Assembly and
 hairman of one of its chambers.
 The decision of the metal
 orkers to forgo a strike was
 relief to the Prague leader-
 hip, which repeatedly warned
 hat finny such action might
 ring' political chaos and a re-
 urn of Soviet tanks to the
 treats of Prague and other
 flies. ,
 Careful  to  avoid  making
 ny new .threats, the union
 emphasized  that it viewed
 necessary.  Urged  by  Mn
 Smrkovsky   himself not to
 strike, the union said It did not
 intend to "support any efforts;
 that would weaken the confi-I
 dente in the leading role of thel
 party." But it added that the.
 tense   situation  had  bhen`
 created in part because '.of
 "insufficient information" frorni
 the Government.
 Free Choice Thought Unlikely-;
 It seemed extremely unlikely
 that the Communist leadership
 would go along with the pro-
 posal fora free election of the
 Assembly chairman even though
 the 'formal election procedure
 at a joint session of the Depu?
 ties is described as based on a'
 "'secret ballot." The two cham-
 bers will meet later this month,
 for the formalities.
 In the view of the party lead.:
 ership, the issue, in effect, i.l
 closed. The 21-member Presid-
 ium, the party's' highest organ,
 has made its decision. The Cen-
 tral  committee; ' which  will
 meet next week,, undoubtedly,
 will go along with it.
 Some  trade-union officials
 said in interviews today that,I
 despite the decision to back)
 down from the strike threat,
 the outspoken support of Mr.
 Smrkovsky by the. mcitat",work
 ers_ and other unions 'would
 have some nnsitive_'remilts

 "The next time," one'.union'
 official said, "I think we will

 more precision what the party:

 The  Central  Council  of
 `Trade Unions,  representin;
 more than five million' work-
 ers,' has drafted a resolution
 that says in part, that trade
