 CPW Report No. 16 -- COMMUNIST CHINA
 (Mar. 31-Apr. 6, 1952)
 Broadcasts to the C,,rinese people during the week ending Apr. 6 shoved unmistakably, both
 quantitatively and in subject matter, that the anticorruption drive was being brought to an end
 as rapidly as corruption cases could be settled.  A statistical survey of regional broadcasts
 disclosed that 703 news items were contained in the 1218 clear news programs monitored from 21
 regional stations.  Of this total, 162 items, approximately 23 percent, had to do with the
 anticorruption drivel.  This compares with 42 percent devoted to the drive in the week ending
 Mar. 9, with 58 percent in a survey made Feb. 24, and with 63 percent Feb. 10.  Another subject
 now has taken precedence over the drive, for during the week 232 news items, approximately 33
 percent of the total, were devoted to agriculture -- spring cultivation, drought prevention,
 production quotas, irrigation, insect control, and so forth.
 Reports of confession and accusation meetings still were broadcast.  However, the main purpose
 of the mleetingsapparently was to wring confessions from businessmen who already had been accused
 and therefore must confess in order to be pardoned.  Pardons were granted at most of the
 meetings, although many victims were arrested because they stubbornly refused to admit their
 guilt.  A secondary aim of the meetings seemingly was to get businessmen who had been pardoned
 or given lenient treatment to join more wholeheartedly in the five-anti's drive against bigger
 and more corrupt businessmen- -the 5 percent mentioned by the Shanghai Mayor the previous week.
 Promises of reward for all-out effort to expose corruption during the drive were being fulfilled.
 The special People's Tribunalce suggested the previous week by Peking were organized in numerous
 places for rapid adjudication of corruption cases.  The East China Military and Administrative
 Commit bee even wont further and set up a "Tribunal Inspection Committee" to supervise the work of
 the People's Tribunals.  Another new tool for rapid adjudication was adopted by Tientsin in the
 form of a "technicallcommittee" to study cases appealed from the Austerity Comittee, make
 recommlendations,,and assemble "technical data,"? such as "statements of accounts," to be used as
 evidence.
 In spite of severe punis,.ment meted out to some offenders, broadcasts also reported some astounding
 instances of Len agcy.  One Hangchow businessman was pardoned when he confessed to corruption
 amounting to 830 million yuan and refunded the money.  Other evidence of appeasement of

 /"capitalists" was apparent.  Tientsin Mayor Huang Chin in a public statement warned that the
 drive "wags not aimed to destroy private enterprise," spoke of the danger of "wounding friendships
 with heated accusations," and suggesited that corrupt merchants might even be friends rather than
 enemies.
 A new note injected into anticorruption drive broadcasts was the effort to regain funds taken from
 public organizations by corrupt elements.  Peking outlined a Central Government directive calling
 for "restitution in principle," and !repayment of funds, or even promises to repay, vent a long
 vay toward gaining lenient verdicts f or offenders.  Cadres were urged to see that corrupt elements
 repaid stolen funds, a new angle, for, as Wuhsi explained, "Many of the cadres had stopped when
 to ask for restitution."
 corrupt elements confessed, failingi
 Though concentration on businessmen was apparent, several important cases of corruption among
 officials were noted.  Hangchow told of a 10-year prison term for one official who embezzled
 Resist-America, Aid-Korea donations and relief allotments for Army dependents.  Wuhsi reported
 expulsion from the Party of a department head who had been a Communist for 10 years.  Peking
 said that Ho Heng-fu, high official in the Central and South China Government, had been
 dismissed for corruption.             I
 Complaints of economic dislocation as a result of the anticorruption drive were heard less
 frequently, and claims that the drive had promoted production were made more often.  However,
 there still was considerable evidence of dislocation.  Tsinan stated that the local Railway
 bureau had sent 1,500 cadres out to "solicit business" from merchants and cooperatives.  The
 Sangchow Austerity Committee was quoted as exhorting businessmen "to carry on business as usual
 regardless of their investigative status" and to "drop their wait-and-see attitude."  State
 trading companies still were reported placing orders with private business to revive trade.
 Famine and food shortages also were apparent, as well as a shortage of seed for spring sowing.
 Nanchang reported "1+0 percent of the villagers" in one Kiangsi hsien short of food, and Foochow,
 where evidences of trouble had beeninoted for weeks, said "relief had been rushed to 158 foodless
 'families" in the city's suburbs.  Worry over deficient warehouses and a resulting spoilage of
 scarce grain was reflected in several broadcasts.
 With promotion of spring farming now the chief concern of the broadcasting system, some difficulties
 .were noted.  Farmers in one area failed to take delivery of fertilizer they had ordered "because
 they had no money."  One office cor lained that the "peasants have not enough confidence."  Some
 farmers were "afraid to make loans for fear of being upgraded."  In one area of Fukien paddies
 were reported drying up, endangering the spring rice crop.
 Mukden reported a campaign to "popularize horse-drawn implements" on farms, and said that the first
 ones manufactured in China were now !in use.  Tsinan told of plans to develop a whale and seal
 industry off Shantung shores.
 Wuhan criticized land reform cadres in Hupeh for having no confidence in "poor and hired farmers,"
 and announced that a land reform exhibition in Wuhan would "demonstrate the leadership of the
 Communist Party in the rise of the farming class."  Resistance to the land reform program still
 was reported from Kiangsi and Yunnan, with Nanchang describing one Kiangsi community as a
 "reactionary stronghold."
 The propaganda campaign against American use of bacteriological warfare seemed to be dying out.
 Reports of protests broadcast by the, regional stations were few, and Peking made no new charges
 of germs dropped over China.  A new type of broadcast was heard from Chungking when the names of
 32 Szechwan soldiers in Korea who had been "gloriously martyred" were given, along with
 announcement of their awards and descriptions of their heroic exploits.

 their political consciousness, and "now realize the attacks of the capitalists upon the working
 class and are united in their support of workers' unions."
 Wuhsi claimed (Apr. 4) that the No. 1 Processing Mill of the South Kiangeu Food Company was
 establishing records in production as a result of the drive, as the workers "now realize the
 factory belongs to them, and they must not be wasteful."    Pan Chin-ho, who used to be a trouble-
 maker, now was leading the workers in increasing production.  Wuhan asserted (Apr. 5) that "to

 Shanghai reported (Apr. 4) that the Hangchow Austerity Committee issued a statement exhorting
 businessmen to carry on business as usual "regard-less of their investigative status."  The
 anticorruption drive "was not designed to eliminate the capitalist class," so businessmen should
 "drop their wait-and-see attitude."  The Shanghai Talien Machine Shop contracted to produce

 organize the farmers for relief work by making fishing nets, while 8,000 catties of relief grain
 had been distributed.  Kaifeng complained (Apr. 3) that 1,893 households in Pingyang Hsien, Honan,

 100,000 mou of ripe crops.  Nanchang said (Apr. 3) that the Party Committee of Shangjao Hsien,
 Kiangsi, had issued a directive calling upon cadres to save daily rice rations for relief of
 famine sufferers, and estimating they could save 450,000 yuan and 400 catties of rice by

 their misconceptions" of the Government fertilizer policy.  They had stopped the use of natural
 fertilizers and ordered farmers to buy fertilizers in accordance with the size of their farms or
 the number of persons in their families, with the result that orders for fertilizer had reached
 only 3.5 percent of the plan.  Hangchow said (Apr. 2) that 67 farmers of Wuchiatun village,
 Shouchang Hsien, Chekiang, had ordered 22,400 catties of fertilizer, but failed to go through
 with the transaction because they had no money.  The local Party secretary called a meeting and

 was being promoted by private borrowing and lending of grain, but that some farmers with
 surplus grain "went around complaining of poverty, and were afraid to make loans for fear of being
 upgraded."  Foochow complained (Apr. 2) that cadres in Yunhsiao Hsien, Fukien; "failed to show
 any solicitude toward the farmers..`When one peasant sought the help of a cadre in borrowing an
 ox for spring farming the cadre said to him:   "The Volunteers at the Korean front have overcome
