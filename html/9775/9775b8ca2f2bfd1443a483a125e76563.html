ants naqinY asMeled7IVelli. triereTrues o e gelitleman from meant young young men dragged off for train-
ing against their will. It meant the 
stealing of all village food and medical 
supplies in the name of liberation. It 
meant the displacement of hope with 
fear. An because the South Vietnamese 
find it objectionable that they surrender 
their- freedom to something called the 
liberation front, alias the Vietoong, alias 
the Communist army of North Vietnam. 
Mr. Mellen, in proclaiming himself a 
Marxist, would indicate that while he is 
an instructor of history,- he has not 
/earned well the lessons of history. Even 
the Russian leaders admit that pure 
Marxism is unworkable. And everyone 
knows that history has never disclosed 
one country that has chosen communism 
M a free election. 
It is common knowledge that the Viet-
cong are having some diMculty with their 
recruiting drive: Since Mr. Mellen has 
such strong convictions about welcoming 
a Vietcong victory, perhaps he should be 
given the opportunity to fight with the 
Vietcong and thus translate his words 
into a more meaningful note. I would 
be very happy to intercede in his behalf 
In making the necessary arrangements. 
Perhaps we could trade him for some of 
the American prisoners of war before 
they are murdered in cold blood by the 
Vietcong as were the two Americans last 
week. 
In fact, some of our protesting stu-
dents calling for a Vietcong victory could 
be included in such a trade and thus the 
Vietcong would have new recruits and we 
would save the lives of courageous Amer-
icans who are fighting to save the free-
dom Mr. Mellen and his ilk would have 
us abandon. 
The "global quota" arrangement of the 
present law would be eliminated. The "quota 
of any country with which the 'United States 
severs diplomatic relations would continue to 
be suspended. but would be allocated 
promptly to specific countries on a temporary 
basis. 
Because present sugarbeet growers will nec-
essarily have to reduce acreage further as a, 
part of the proposed new program. national 
acreage reserve provisions contained in the 
1962 act, under which new production areas 
were brought in. Would not be extended after 
1966. 
Mr. Speaker. the U.S. sugar industry of 
course is entitled to change its mind and 
perhaps has done so on the Question of 
the import fee, but it should be fair-
minded in contacting Members of Con-
gress and explain to them that the in-
dustry position has changed and why. 
It may also be that the U.S. industry 
was not fully united in its position March 
29 of this year on the import fee, and I 
daresay it is not united right now. 
In evaluating the attitude of various 
Interested parties, one should keep in 
mind the possibility that some U.S. sugar 
interests may also be heavily involved in 
foreign sugar, and vice versa. 
Mr. HARVEY of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. FINDLEY. I yield to the gentle-
man from Indiana. 
Mr. HARVEY of Indiana. Is not that 
fee the same as that which prevailed in 
prior sugar legislation? 
Mr. FINDLEY. It is very similar to 
the import fee which was assessed against 
the Dominican Republic during the 
Eisenhower administration and a as in 
effect In the legislation which operated 
In 1962, 1963, and 1064. 
INSTRUCTOR IN HISTORY WEL-
COMES VIETCONG VICTORY 
(Mr. GALLAGHER asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
have just read on the wire that an in-
structor In history at Drew University. 
James Mellen, has declared himself as 
welcoming a Vietcong victory in 
Vietnam. 
This despite over a hundred thousand 
American soldiers fighting to prevent 
such a victory. This despite American 
and Vietnamese being killed to prevent 
such a victory. It is just quite possible 
that this self-proclaimed Marxist is try-
ing to attract a little attention to him-
self. I am sure the Republic will survive. 
It has survived the early -Mellenheaded" 
thinking of Benedict Arnold who wished 
a victory for the other side when this 
country was engaged in another war. 
Having once served on the faculty at 
Rutgers University I believe completely 
In academic freedom, even the free and 
full expression of fools in and out of 
academic circles and, therefore. I recog-
nize Mr. Mellen's right to full expression. 
And I have a right to find his view ap-
palling and disgraceful as well as men-
lightened. He obviously does not know 
what a Vietcong victory entails. 
When I was in Vietnam I saw what a 
Vietcong victory meant in some villages.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON SHOULD:VETO; 
THE NEW IMMIGRATION .ACT .? 
(Mr. ooramaz asked and was given' 
permission to address the House for 
minute and to revise and Wend: his-
reinarks.) 
Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have 
long supported reform of our outdated 
immigration law and abolition of the 
In-
famous national origin system. When 
the Immigration and Nationality Act of 
1965 was before the. House ID August. X. 
voted for it and against sal oriesnline 
amendments. One of the crippling 
amendments that I. along with the - 
ership, opposed then was s propos&1 to 
place a- quota on immigration from the-
Western Hemisphere. The House wisely 
rejected this proposal.. But the Senate 
version of the bill contained an alma* 
identical provision, establishing a quota 
of 120.000 persons a year on immigration. 
from the Western Hemisphere. This 
was one of the most important differ-
ences between the two bills. In my 
opinion, it was the most important dif-
ference. The bills went to conferenee 
and, as we all know, the conference 
re-
port recommended adoption of the Sena_ 
ate provision. I offered a motion to: 
recommit the report back to the antere. 
ence with instruction to reject the Sen-' 
ate amendment establishing a quota for 
the Western Hemisphere. ? After memo!. 
non failed I voted, against adoption . of 
the conference report. I could not in 
good conscience vote for a so-caned ye-
form measure which merely transfers 
bad Practice from one part of the worht, 
to another. 
We who have justly criticised the Iron 
Curtain, Bamboo Curtain, and the Berlin 
wall have reason to ponder riboitt what, 
we have done to our own hemisphere, 
today. We have, in me Judgment, 
lowered a paper curtain and me red swill 
of redtape areernd mix horders; , What is, 
worse, these devices are aimed smith* 
the peoples of this hemisphere irith 
whom we claim to be partners, neighbor's, 
and even brothers. - ? ? 
The Western Hernisphere tiniest Is Ifl 
advised and unnecessary. Secretary 
Rusk expressed his strong opposition to 
It when he said that the amendment 
would, in effect, place obstacles in the 
path leading to cordial and harmonious. 
relations with Latin America. It' is no 
secret, for example, that under the lan-. 
guage of the amendment, any one coun-
try such as Canada could entirely pre-
empt the quota for any year by sending 
into ? the. United States ? 120.000 immi-
grants. Who is to say that the persons 
administering the new law -would not 
permit this? And what would be .the 
effects an the Latin nations? 
It 11) an. unnecessary Provision because 
under the present law Immigration from 
the countries of the Western Hemisphere 
over the past 10 years has averaged only 
110,000. With this new law we are thus' 
creating a problem where there, has been 
no problem in the past.

Septemler /ring CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 24805 
should continue our balance-of-payments 
deficit to maintain world liquidity, overlook 
two other basic points. First, the dollar can-
not continue to be a reserve currency if we 
Continue a balance-of-payments deficit of 
the magnitudes that have prevailed in the 
past. Sooner or later our liabilities will be-
come so large in relation to our gold reserves 
that foreign central bankers will no longer 
believe that the dollar is, in fact, as good as 
gold and they will not be willing to hold it. 
Second, a deficit in our balance of pay-
ments does not necessarily and automatically 
increase world liquidity if the countries 
which are receiving the dollars cash them 
in for gold. Their reserves go up but ours 
go down, and the world total remains the 
same.- To illustrate the point, in the first 
quarter of this year the deficit in our overall 
balance of payments, seasonally unadjusted, 
was $1130 million. But these dollars did not 
become new additions to total world re-
serves. Rather, they came right back to 
the U.S. Treasury Department to be ex-
changed, along with dollars accumulated in 
past periods, for some $800 million worth of 
gold. A continuance of the dollar outflow 
would lead to more of the same, a transfer of 
gold from the United States to the European 
surplus countries with little or no gain for 
world liquidity as a whole but with continual 
decreases in our liquidity. 
THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH 
The administration's approach to these 
twin problems is to move quickly and cer-
tainly to balance-of-payments equilibrium 
and at the 'same time to move forward in 
discussions on improving the world's mone-
tary system. 
I have pointed out why it is imperative 
for us to restore equilibrium in our balance 
Of payments. But what, it is asked, do we 
mean by equilibrium? Is it an exact balance 
or does it allow for some deficit, say $500 
million, $1 billion, or even more? 
Our feeling in the Treasury is that equilib-
rium cannot be defined solely in terms of a 
figure; it is importantly a matter of con-
fidence. Whether a given figure for the 
overall balance of our international transac-
tions represents equilibrium depends on the 
particular circumstances at the particular 
time. But while we may not be able to 
define in precise numerical terms what equi-
librium is, we can say that it does not exist 
when the United States is continually losing 
gold. Perhaps, then, the best indication of 
what equilibrium in the U.S. balance of pay-
ments is, is what the rest of the world thinks 
it is. The extent to which they cash in their 
dollars for gold is, in short, a very useful 
indicator. 
? We are seeking the long-run, basic solu-
tion to our balance-of-payments deficit 
through measures which are consistent with 
our domestic objectives and our foreign 
policy objectives, and consistent with a 
growing volume of world trade and capital 
movements. In brief, our longrun ap-
proach is to: 
1. Continue to minimize the balance-of-
payments impact of Government expendi-
tures abroad. 
2. Strive to increase our exports and 
receipts from foreign tourists. 
3. Encourage other developed nations to 
take on more international financing to 
relieve us of a disproportionate share. 
4. Take measures to encourage more for-
eign investment here. 
To gain the necessary time for these longer 
run measures, we have undertaken shorter 
run measures which President Johnson out-
lined in his message last February 10. These 
consist of efforts to reduce foreign travel 
expenditures by U.S. citizens; the extension 
and broadening of the interest equaliza-
tion tax; and, most importantly, the request 
that banks and corporations curtail or ad-
just their activities to lessen the balance-
of-payments impact of capital outflows. 
The key to success in this program, both 
In the short run and in the long run, is the 
business community. For the short run, we 
must have the effective cooperation of the 
business community to give us the time for 
our longer run measures to take effect. And 
in the long run, the competitive position 
of American business in relation to the other 
major trading countries will be critical. 
First of all, we must maintain our good 
record of relative price stability. Second, 
American business must become more en-
ergetic and effective in finding and exploit-
ing foreign markets for American exports. 
Shortly after President Johnson an-
nounced his new balance-of-payments pro-
gram on February 10, there was an encour-
aging swing to a surplus in our balance of 
payments. It is far too early, however, to 
conclude that this represents a permanent 
trend toward equilibrium. Some of the gains 
were due to special factors, some were one-
time gains. We are by no means out of the 
woods yet. But we do feel that we have a 
program which is sound and can bring us 
to equilibrium if all of us follow through 
on it. 
While the subject of world liquidity has 
only recently come into public prominence, 
the United States, several years ago, joined 
with other major countries in comprehen-
sive studies of the international monetary 
system, its recent evolution, its present ef-
fectiveness, and its future. On June 1 a 
this year,this multilateral study group issued 
a report which exhaustively examines the 
possible ways to strengthen the system. In 
July, Secretary Fowler announced that the 
United States stood prepared to participate 
in an international monetary conference 
that would consider what steps we might 
jointly take to secure substantial improve-
ments in international monetary arrange-
ments. 
On September 10, Secretary Fowler re-
turned from a 10-day trip to Europe during 
which he exchanged views with officials of 
seven countries on how we might move ahead 
to improve the workings of the international 
monetary system. Secretary Fowler had 
earlier conferred in Washington with Cana-
dian and Japanese officials. 
He found agreement that present circum-
stances call for a reexamination of the free 
world's monetary arrangements; that we 
should begin contingency planning for the 
possible time ahead when new ways of pro-
viding for growth in monetary reserves will 
become necessary; and that active discu 
sions on negotiations should begin in e 
near future at the level of policymaking 
officials. 
The annual meeting of the International 
Monetary Fund beginning next week offers a 
logical opportunity to start putting the ne-
gotiating machinery in motion. 
In both the case of the problem of the 
U.S. balance of payments and that of in-
ternational monetary reform, therefore, there 
are signs of progress. I would rather close, 
however, on a note of caution. A basic 
change in the world's monetary system will 
not come about quickly or easily. To reach 
agreement among all the nations involved 
on anything so basic will require time and 
enormous effort. 
A lasting improvement in our balance of 
payments?lasting enough to be meaningful 
in the context I have described?will also 
require time and effort. 
The President's program is broad aged, 
requiring some sacrifice of many elements 
of the population but no unreasonable sacri-
fice, in our judgment, of any one element. 
Of course, more tourists would like to bring 
back more goods duty free from abroad; of 
course, banks and other lenders would like 
to lend as freely as possible abroad; of 
course, businessmen would like to take ad-
vantage of every attractive oversea invest-
ment opportunity. Essentially, we are asking 
these groups to adjust?not halt?these 
practices, so that confidence in the dollar 
Will be sustained. 
If confidence in the dollar is sustained, if 
the international monetary system evolves in 
a sensible way, we will have created the best 
possible environment for the American econ-
omy--American businessmen?to demon-
strate their formidable competitive strength 
in the world at large, in the years ahead.

Mr. MARTIN of Alabama. Mr. Speak-

trict makes it imperative for me to be 
absent tomorrow when the vote will be 
taken on H.R. 10281, Government Em-
ployees Salary Comparability Act. If I 
were present I would vote for the bill be-
cause I believe that Federal employees 
are entitled to an increase in salary in 
order to keep pace with the inflationary 
cost of living, the large part of which 
is caused by Federal spending in other 
areas.

MADISON VIETNAM HEARINGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
GONZALEZ) . Under previous order of the 
House, the gentleman from Wisconsin 
[Mr. KssTENmEisa] is recognized for 60 
minutes. 
(Mr. KASTENMEIER asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks and include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Speaker, 
at the time that I conducted the hear-
ings on the war in Vietnam in my dis-
trict, I pledged that a report would be 
made on the hearings to Congress and 
the President. I am today presenting 
that report to Congress. 
At the Madison hearings, conducted in 
the straightforward format of a congres-
sional committee hearing, serious effort 
was made to analyze the war in Vietnam 
and possible future courses of action. 
At the outset I would like to emphasize

but were conducted by me as a Member 
of Congress. 
Today, as I make this report, condi-
tions in Vietnam show little prospect of 
change. The war promises to continue 
for weeks, months, and perhaps even 
years. The need to evaluate its causes 
and possible solutions remains as great 
today as it was at mid-stanmer 1965. 
In the give and take between constitu-
ents and their Representatives, it was 
obvious the citizenry of this country 
have given great thought to the war in 
Vietnam and that they individually have 
much to contribute to the national dia-
log from which the force and direction of 
our Nation's policy must emerge. 
Such contributions are an important 
part of the resources our system of gov-
ernment can bring to bear on the policy-
making procedure. In fact, one of the 
main sources of strength in a democracy 
Is criticism and the role it plays in pol-
icymaking. 
In the language of Adlai E. Stevenson: 
Criticism is simply the method by which 
existing ideas and institutions are subjected 
to the test of principles, ideas, ideals, and 
possibilities. Criticism in its fairest and 
Most honest form, is the attempt to test 
whether what is, might not be better. 
It was in this spirit that the hearings in 
my district were undertaken. 
The hearings conducted in the Sec-
ond Congressional District of Wisconsin 
were the first of their kind. They were 
held in Madison, Wis., on July 30 and 31, 
1965. Spectators of all ages and per-
suasions filled the 350-seat capacity hall 
of Madison's First Methodist Church to 
capacity at each of the three sessions. 
Applause greeted the remarks of almost 
every witness. Each witness submitted 
the text of his remarks to the chair 
immediately prior to testifying and in 
most instances adhered closely to it. 
Questions from myself, and the gentle-
man from New York [Mr. ROSENTHAL], 
who joined with me in conducting the 
first day of the hearings, sought to clari-
fy the statement of each Witness. No 
demonstrations occurred and the hear-
ings proceeded in an aura of mutual re-
spect. A verbatim record of the hearings 
was made from which this report was 
prepared. In addition to this report, I 
have also arranged for the publication of 
the transcript of the hearing in book 
form in the near future. 
This report represents a synthesis of 
the content of the statements of each of 
the 47 witnesses who testified. While 
every effort was made to emphasize the 
major points of each witness, in some 
cases the points drawn from a statement 
may not be the major point of a given 
witness' testimony. For purposes of this 
report, no effort was made to substantiate 
the facts alleged by the witnesses. 
A report of this hearing is being made 
available to the President and the For-
eign Affairs Committee of the House. 
A list of the witnesses in the order of 
their appearance follows. References in

REPORT ON THE MADISON VIETNAM HEARINGS?
WHY ARE WE THERE? 
The search for an answer to this question 
ran throughout the 2 days of hearings. In 
the simplest terms, we are there based on a 
commitment reinforced by a decade of in-
volvement'. However, the original Eisen-
hower-Kennedy commitment was limited to 
assisting the South Vietnamese fight their 
war? In the decade prior to 1954, the Viet-
minh emerged as the sole effective political 
force capable of defeating the French? Fol-
lowing the 1951 Geneva Accords, we under-
took to support the Diem regime. This ef-
fort which appeared to be paying off until 
Diem, with our concurrence, refused to hold 
the elections called for by the Geneva Ac-
cords.4 The failure to hold elections, which 
everyone, including then President Eisen-
hower, expected the Communists would win,B 
brought the Communists back into the south 
to renew the war they had left off in 1954,6 
The repressive policies of Diem led to local 
discontent and to military development of 
the National Liberation Front.' or the Viet-
cong as Diem labeled his opposition.B While 
the two developments give rise to both the 
contention that the war in Vietnam is not 
a civil war 8 and that the National Libera-
tion Front is not an arm of Hanoi lo but 
rather a "common front" for various indi-
geneous dissident South Vietnamese, includ-
ing Communist," the fact remains that 
Diem and successive Saigon governments 
have been unpopular dictatorships which 
have resorted to undemocratic means to 
maintain their p5wer.12 If the National Lib-
eration Front has legitimate complaints 
against the Saigon government, it would be 
tragic if Russia and China were the only 
ones to recognize them.13 In fact, assum-
ing for purposes of argument the achieve-
ment of an agreement between Hanoi and 
the United States to withdraw all outside 
forces from South Vietnam, South Vietnam 
would still be torn by revolution since the

guerrilla war is popular and has the sup-
port of 80 percent of the South Vietnamese." 
WHAT ARE WE ACCOMPLISHING THERE? 
Testimony divided sharply over the effect 
Of our presence in Vietnam. While the 
witnesses did not all address themselves to 
the same points, the ideas emphasized by 
each establlshed a clear disagreement be-
tween those who thought our presence in 
Vietnam served our national interests and 
those who thought otherwise. 
The witnesses supporting our presence as 
being in our national interest did so on the 
basis of power politics. 
The central theme running through their 
testimony was that we must seek a stable 
line of demarcation between the Commu-
nist and free world areas in Asia as we have 
in Europe?, 
Failure to maintain a defense line from 
Korea to Vietnam means we will face the 
enemy on an inner line from Alaska to 
Hawaii." 
In a detailed presentation several wit-
nesses made a compelling argument for 
American , involvement in Vietnam on the 
basis of various aspects of the Soviet-Sino 
split and the nature of wars of national 
liberation. 
Russia is cast in the role of the responsible 
power, which has not renounced wars of na-
tional liberation as a method of winning 
independence, but which has recognized the 
peaceful path to power as a viable alterna-
tive. It has tended to emphasize this as it 
recognized that limited wars might escalate 
Into a nuclear confrontation with the West." 
? Peiping, on the other hand, is very skepti-
cal about the peaceful or parliamentary path 
and has emphasized the role of liberation 
Wars and armed struggle as the best means 
of achieving national liberation." 
The path of Mao Tse-tung has set the 
exampfe for lio Chi Minh in North Vietnam. 
It includes the establishment (1) of a van-
guard party tied to peasant masses operating 
in rural, not urban areas, and (2) a libera-
tion army created for the guerrilla phase of 
a war of liberation. Such wars ultimately 
lead to conventional warfare with liberated 
areas serving as prototypes of the country 
once total victory is won. National fronts 
are established to join in opposition to what 
is labeled foreign imperialism and the reac-
tionary established regime. The party em-
phasizes land and other reforms without 
mention of socialist transformation and col-
lectivization of agriculture. It is a variant 
of this program which is reflected in the pro-
gram and tactics of the Vietcong in South 
Vietnam?' 
Efforts early in 1957 and 1958 by the Viet-
cong were aimed at eliminating, through an 
efficient and well-coordinated program of po-
litical assassination, village officials, school 
teachers and members of welfare teams. The 
total of these assassinations has exceeded 
15,000; 4,000 having been killed in a 12-
month period in 1960-61." In a number of 
villages a new mayor could not be obtained, 
after the first two or three were murdered; 
schools were closed in some areas for lack of 
teachers; and assassinations and kidnapings 
stopped the antimalaria campaign in 1961." 
While Diem was not a charismatic leader,

capable of welding his nation together or 
making the best use of aid moneys, this 
"Revolutionary Model or Terror" made social 
and economic reform difficult if not impos-
sible." 
The outcome of the current confrontation 
in South Vietnam will enhance or dampen 
the probability such Communist-inspired 
wars of national liberation will become the 
"wave of the future" throughout the under-
developed areas of the globe." 
The hard decisions President Johnson is 
making which close the alternative of vio-
lent change and open the opportunity for 
the emergence of stable, non-Communist po-
litical communities based on political free-
dom and social justice are in our national 
interest." 
? A Vietcong victory would be a success 
which would encourage Communists to use 
this kind of assault on governments in ad-
jacent countries." 
Others took more ideological positions. 
Since World War H, America has been found 
wherever freedom has been under attack. 
We face in Vietnam a new challenge to the 
determination of the United States to pre-
vent the expansion of Communist control 
around the world." 
"I am against the Communists wherever 
they may be. We are at war. Let's keep, 
America on her toes so she'll not get knocked 
down on her knees." " 
One witness expressed the view that the 
Vietnam war had polarized opinion between 
those individuals who are thoroughly con-
vinced of the peaceful nature of our Govern-
ment on the one hand and those idealists 
who see military action as a violation of the 
basic ideals of our country on the other. 
The former believe the Government of Red 
China should be destroyed. They turn on 
more accessible fellow Americans who ques-
tion the feasibility of that course of action 
and charge they are disloyal. The idealists 
would seek withdrawal as the answer, where-
as withdrawal would only convince the 
enemy of the value of its terrorist approach. 
The problem is to determine and to apply 
the optimum military force and political 
strategy required not to impose victory but 
to deny victory to the opponent-and do it 
decisively." 
The central theme of those who believe the 
nature of our involvement undermines our 
national interest, emphasized the irony of a 
country born of a nationalist social revolu-
tion should be fighting nationalist social 
revolutions just 200 years later." The effort 
we are making in Vietnam underscores OUT 
failure to recognize the fundamental validity 
of social revolution " and reveals that our 
policies are based on the false assumptions 
(1) that wars of national liberation are Com-
munist controlled, (2) that communism is 
monolithic and threatens the United States 
anywhere, and (3) that Communists must be 
confronted everywhere." It was contended 
that we must start supporting oppressed peo-
ples instead of driving them into the hands 
of the Communists." It was forcefully 
argued that we must honor in deed the prin-
ciple of self-determination even if we do not

like all the results. We must move 'toward 
a policy of codetermination and be willing to 
accept limits on our own egos." 
The life of the Diem regime illustrates the 
weakness of our policy in Vietnam. If we 
admit we deposed Diem, we admit we used 
murder to accomplish our ends. If we deny 
we deposed him, we admit his policies pro-
duced widespread and overt resistance in 
South Vietnam." 
Many other ways were cited in which the 
Vietnam war effort was considered to be a 
disservice to Our national interest. 
It was argued that the practical conse-
quences of the war are that it could escalate, 
by calculations" or mistake into nuclear 
war " or major land war in Asia." We, in 
fact, are driving North Vietnam into the 
embrace of China." 
The moral consequences of the war con-
cerned many witnesses." It was contended 
that our leadership of the free world is jeo-
pardized by support of dictatorships and that 
our support of such dictatorship is destroy-
ing the important "defender-of-the-op-
pressed" image of America in the hearts of 
oppressed peoples around the world." The 
war, in fact, is becoming one between Amer-
icans and Asians." 
Many witnesses expressed revulsion over 
the inhumanity of the war. One observed 
that three out of four persons seeking treat-
ment for napalm burns are women and chil-
dren." Another asked how long each of us, 
as individuals, can acquiesce in the killing on 
both sides." A mother asserted she taught 
her children the worth of every individual 
' human being but that this was being de-
stroyed by the Government." Another 
pointed out that an extended war in Vietnam 
would result in destruction of people we seek 
to protect." 
It was further contended that international 
relations must be approached from ethical, 
humanitarian, and religious points of view-
the worth of each person to be respected and 
his basic rights to self-fulfillment assured?, 
Resort to war was protested on the grounds 
that violence is contrary to the will of God." 
The costs of the war and the risks of 
escalation were cited as the basis for a con-
tention that we should take the same risks by 
seeking nonviolent solutions to the war." 
Critics of the war cited its domestic con-
sequences. It was asserted that war is alter-
ing the shape of domestic politics-jeopardiz-
ing the role of Congress in our Govern-
ment," and that anticommunism is becom-

ing as blind an emotion as the tragic anti-
semitism of the Nazis." Children Must 
morally choose betweefi-Tvnr as a way of life 
and disobeying the government', It was 
argued that we are following Goldwater 
policies rejected in 1964." 
Others cited the international con-
sequences of the war. Bypassing the peace-
keeping powers of the United Nations weak-
ens the U.N." and is as detrimental to the 
U.N. as bypassing the League of Nations was 
for it." Our longstanding commitment to 
world order under law requires us to give the 
U.N. primacy in foreign affairs.. We must 
stop relying on the self restraint and the 
rationality of the very men we damn as un-
reasoning fanatics to avoid a nuclear 
holocaust." 
The success of the Vietcong in destroying 
American aircraft and barracks, rather than 
discouraging the Vietcong, is demonstrating 
to them the great ease with which simply 
armed guerrillas can deal with the great 
power of America and it encourages guerril-
las in other lands to do their worst." Our 
action erodes international law since we have 
no legal right to intervene and force on 
them the form of government most bene-
ficial to us." We are waging an offensive 
military action which amounts to conducting 
a war without the required constitutional 
declaration of war by Congress." It is im-
possible to think the United States can play 
the part of solitary policeman to mankind 
or to fight guerrilla wars throughout Asia." 
We can win the war only if We are prepared 
to commit genocide on all the people who 
live there-the use of napalm in Vietnam 
and gas chambers in Germany are hard to 
distinguish." 
It was also contended that by the manner 
of our conduct in Vietnam we have virtually 
insisted that the enemy attack us so that 
we might justify our aggressive intentions 
not only toward North Vietnam but also 
toward China." 
ALTERNATIVES 
Several alternative courses of action are 
open to the United States. Alternatives fall 
roughly within six possible courses of action. 
1. Create a stable South Vietnamese Gov-
ernment before withdrawing our forces. 
2. Invade North Vietnam with or with-
out bombing Red China to achieve victory 
over the Vietcong. 
3. Hurt the Vietcong and North Vietnam 
sufficiently so that they will scale down their 
demands, making the negotiation of a com-
promise settlement possible. 
4. Unnegotiated, unilateral withdrawal of 
American. forces. 
5. Negotiated settlement leading ultimately 
to a united Vietnam under a coalition gov-
ernment. 
6. Intervention by the United Nations or 
other multilateral proposals.

First two alternatives: (1) Create stable 
South Vietnamese Government before 
withdrawing forces. (2) Invade North 
Vietnam with or without bombing Red 
China to achieve victory over Vietcong 
One witness cited the fact that premature 
negotiations with an enemy while his forces 
occupy South Vietnam serve only as tacit 
admissions that Communist North Vietnam 
had a right to invade and conquer South 
Vietnam. He contended that we must stand 
and fight until all North Vietnam forces are 
eradicated from South Vietnam." Similar 
views to the effect that only in a country 
free from Communist control can people 
achieve self-determination, self-sustaining 
economic growth and political freedom." 
Other witnesses countered with the con-
tention that the creation of a stable South 
Vietnamese Government would involve a 
force of up to one million American men with 
the prospects for success uncertain.'" 
Testimony in favor of the second alterna-
tive was only inferential. A single witness 
urged the employment of such military mea-
sures as would insure the destruction of the 
forces of agression-at both the place of their 
attacks and at the source of their power-
as military judgment decides.. 
Other witnesses shied away from endorsing 
such action on the grounds that it would 
involve too great a risk of a third world war 
and would involve too' much land to effective-
ly man against guerrilla attack," and that the 
over-commitment of American ground power 
would invite Communist mischief in other 
key areas of the world." 
Third alternative: Hurt the Vietcong and 
North Vietnam sufficiently so that they 
will scale down their demands, making 
negotiation of a compromise settlement 
possible 
Testimony on this alternative, which comes 
as close as any to characterizing present ad-
ministration policy, divided three ways. 
First. In terms of the Sino-Soviet split, 
our efforts are designed to demonstrate to 
Chinese-inspired advocates of wars that they 
are not the wave of the future." Witnesses 
supporting this alternative expressed the be-
lief that firmness is the only possible way 
to meet the Communist threat to our way of 
life 70 and that we must put forth great 
efforts there against the Reds to let them 
know we mean business." Another witness 
thought the symbolic value of the conflict 
had been set too high, that references to 
such phrases as "national honor," "defense 
of free people" and the unspecified "Com-
munist threat" frame the struggle in phil-
osophically rigid terms, that the people 
should be prepared to accept a stalemate, 
and that there is no need to win it but every 
reason to avoid ignominious defeat.," The 
same witness felt that our Nation's course 
was set: We must make the war costly 
enough for the Vietcong and North Viet-
nam to convince them a political settle-
ment must be accomplished while avoiding 
two dangers-(a) escalatory measures to

draw China and Russia into the fray and 
(b) signs of weakness that might convince 
the rest of southeast Asia we are weakening 
in our will to check expansion of Commu-
nist China." 
Second. In these same terms several wit-
nesses expressed grave concern that Russia 
and China would be drawn into the conflict 
before the United States can force negotia-
tion by escalation," that the current escala-
tion risks plunging the world into nuclear 
warfare," and that the American people want 
peace in Vietnam and are not willing to 
spend a great amount of lives and treasure 
for some dubious kind of success." 
Third. This policy was characterized as a 
gamble, at best, with no indication whether 
it will succeed in negotiation or that what 
is going to take place after negotiation will 
be a communistic system or not." Its feasi-
bility also was questioned. Although it 
could be expected to require a 300,000-man 
American garrison, that garrison would have 
to be maintained over a long period of time. 
It was thought to be theoretically possible, 
but not likely to achieve a permanent solu-
tion." 
Fourth alternative: Unnegotiated, unilateral 
withdrawal of American forces 
Some of the strongest testimony was given 
on the issue of unnegotiated, unilateral with-
drawal. A single witness flatly asserted that 
all combat units should be withdrawn but 
then only as rapidly as is feasible:" Other 
comments reflected a variety of views on the 
most desirable course of action but uniformly 
rejected immediate withdrawal as a feasible 
course of action. 
Testimony of several witnesses was prem-
ised on the erroneous assumption that other 
testimony at the hearing would advocate 
withdrawal. Against this strawman con-
siderable rhetoric was raised. 
The whole of Asia would soon be in the 
control of the Communists." 
''We strongly contest the morality of 
abandoning a free people, who lack the capa-
bility of defending themselves, to a ruthless 
invader." 
U.S. withdrawal-disastrous in much of 
Asia." 
American military presence (in Vietnam) 
lengthens freedom's duration in India." 
We have no choice, just as we had no choice 
fighting the totalitarianism of Hitler and 
Tajo." 
Withdrawal advocates are the intellectual 
heirs of Neville Chamberlain." 
Withdrawal would make self-determination 
unrealistic in view of terror, manipulation, 
and intimidation.5? 
Complete victory for Vietcong would be a 
sharp rebuff to American power and com-
mitment in Asia tending to undermine the 
security of all other non-Communist coun-
tries." 
Yet even strong critics of the underlying 
administration philosophy did not recom-
mend withdrawal as a psosible, feasible, or 
desirable course.

I not only consider it unrealistic in the 
sense of domestic American political con-
siderations, but I consider it psychologically 
01.11 of this world. No major nation involved 
in the predicament we are now involved in 
turns around and walks off." 
I don't wish to see South Vietnam com-
pletely overrun and those people who repre-
sent somebody down there killed, which I 
think is what would happen," 
I am opposed to plain withdrawal for such 
an effort would encourage other wars of 
liberation." 
It looks in terms of reality that negotia-
tions will have to come about before the 
United States even considers withdrawal." 
We do not advocate abandonment of the 
people of Vietnam, but a different kind of 
commitment to freedom dedicated to life on 
the land rather than death from the skies." 
The United States will not withdraw and 
leave South Vietnam to the Vietcong. Wars 
do not end that way." 
Fifth alternative: Negotiated settlement 
leading ultimately to a united Vietnam 
a coalition, government 
Aside from: the broad consensus against 
unnegotiated, unilateral withdrawal, the 
other area of strong consensus was in sup-
port of a negotiated settlement now with the 
frank acknowledgment that the result will 
ultimately be a united country under Com-
munist, but not Chinese, influence." Cen-
tral points of agreement were that even a 
Communist Vietnam would not be domi-
nated by Red China," that Ho Chi Minh 
could, in fact, become the Tito of this part 
of the world," that attempted Chinese mili-
tary intervention would face the same guer-
rilla war, we face," that such a result setting 
Up Vietnam as the Tito of Asia is not likely 
to be popular, but it is more in the real 
interests of the United States than hopes for 
establishing a viable non-Communist South 
Vietnam, notwithstanding that some active 
anti-Communists would actually be perse-
cuted," and, finally, that the administration 
will have to accept the need to negotiate 
with the Vietcong if such a political settle-
ment is to be achieved." 
Various detailed procedures within the 
general framework of a negotiated compro-
mise settlemen were put forward. Their 
principal provisions included: 
1. Stop bombing North Vietnam.' 
2. Establish a cease-fire.' 
3. Negotiations between two contending 
governments in South Vietnam' or between 
all involved governments including the Na-
tional Liberation Front., 
4. An American commitment to honor 
the results of that election,5 to withdraw its

5. Incidental variations offered by wit-
nesses include a great-power guarantee to 
Vietnam,' general amnesty for political pris-
oners:, and strict neutrality agreements from 
the reunited nation" 
Other support for this alternative came in 
more generalized statements. 
Negotiate with Nguyen Hun Tho, chair-
man of NLF; they may prefer a neutralist 
position." 
Never resist the call by the North Vietna-
mese, Red China or the Vietcong to the bar-
gaining table; never forget your promise, 
America's promise of assistance to both the 
aggressed and the aggressors." 
Reservations were expressed about recog-
nizing the Vietcong because that could be 
somewhat of a diplomatic defeat for the 
President 15 and other reservations were di-
rected against the cease-fire proposal in view 
of the aggressive response made by the ter-
rorists during an earlier suspension of 
bombing attacks against North Vietnam." 
Sixth alternative: Intervention of the United 
Nations or other multilateral proposals 
The belief that our efforts at negotiations 
needed increased emphasis, particularly with 
respect to the Vietcong, also was reflected in 
much of the testimony of those who felt 
the United Nations should be brought' into
conflict. 
Most felt the United Nations could serve a 
useful purpose in bringing about the end to 
hoStilities essential to any negotiations and 
observed that our efforts toward that end 
fell short of requesting U.N. intervention." 
Various witnesses expressed a belief the 
United Nations could-
1. Arrange a cease-fire 18 and maintain a 
truce." 
2. Enforce a truce for a reasonable cooling-
off period prior to elections." 
3. Manage free elections." 
4. Arrange an international guarantee of 
the borders of southeast Asian countries." 
5. Reinstitute a customs and payment 
'union between North and South Vietnam." 
6. Channel multilateral economic and so-
cial development programs for all southeast 
Asia." 
Arguments in favor of United Nations in-
volvement were expressed in a variety of 
ways: 
We believe the United Nations offers the 
best possibility for freeing the opposite side 
from its intransigent position and starting 
meaningful negotiations." 
It is essential that we get a third institu-
tion imposed between the United States and 
the Vietnamese on the one hand and be-
tween the United States and China and Rus-
sia on the other." -

vert the task to the United Nations now will

do more to enhance the real needs for peace

bombs the Pentagon has." 
As a signatory to the U.N. Charter, we are 
obligated to ask for 11N. intervention. It is 
a realistic and honorable way out of the hope-
less dilemma in southeast Asia." 
Some skepticism over the possible effec-
tiveness of any United Nations effort was ex-
pressed. Since the war is basically a clash of 
power, the United Nations is not likely to 
contribute substantially to finding a solu-
tion, although it might be useful in enforc-
ing a negotiated settlement." On the other 
hand, since the United States still has a lot 
to say about what the United Nations does, 
if the U.N. goes into Vietnam without full 
U.S. support, it wont settle anything." 
Others emphasized' the fact that Vietnam 
is one of a continuing series of problems for 
which the capabilities of the United Nations 
must be explored and developed. Detailed 
attention must be given U.N. peacekeeping 
responsibilities, powers, and authority." 
Other proposed courses of action emphas-
ized multilateral solutions. One witness pro-
posed a 14-nation conference to arrange a 
ceasefire and guarantee the borders of south-
east Asian countries and to establish a plan-
ning bank capable of including all southeast 
Asian countries." Others urged a multi-
lateral, international Federal Union for De-
fense designed to take on duties we have as-
sumed unilaterally in Vietnam and else-
where," and an international referendum on 
peace designed to elicit and concentrate the 
desire of individuals around the world for 
peace on the problems standing in the way 
of peace." 
The problems surrounding the war in Viet-
nam also evoked suggestions that our Asian 
policy and our China policy in particular 
need reassessment," ranging from opening 
negotiations with the Peoples Republic of 
China on a broad range of issues" to bring-
ing the Communist countries into the world 
community, admitting them to the U.N. to 
show them how we are working to solve the 
problems of our society." 
ASSESSMENT OF THE HEARINGS 
Mr. Speaker, each reader will, of 
course, come to his own conclusions on 
the success of the Madison Vietnam 
hearings. 
For my own part, it is not enough to 
say that the hearings provided an oppor-
tunity for differing points of view to 
present their ideas to their Representa-
tive and through him to the Congress 
and the President, although that is an 
important part of the hearings for the 
witnesses who testified. It is not enough 
even to say that the hearings increased 
public awareness and knowledge of the 
complex issues at stake in Vietnam, 
which certainly was accomplished by the 
wide attention given the hearings in the 
press and on television. Nor is it enough 
to say that the witnesses contributed to 
the building of a consensus on our in-
volvement in the war in Vietnam. 
Nor can the value of the hearings be 
judged by such ulterior considerations

as whether the dissent from administra-
Mon policy voiced at the hearings en-
couraged our enemies, or whether other 
grassroots hearings in the same format 
and serving the same purposes followed 
in other congressional districts. 
Much can be said on each of these 
points and while a reading of even this 
brief outline of the substance of the 
hearings shows that the interests of the 
United States and democracy were served 
by the hearings, one must judge these 
questions for himself. 
It is clear, however, that the people 
have given great thought to our involve-
ment in Vietnam and they do have a 
contribution to make to the development 
of policy on the basis of their expertise 
as well as their commonsense. The cata-
log of ideas this report contains em-
phasizes that even for the best-informed 
and firmly committed policymaker, 
there remains the challenge of the ideas 
and interpretations on policy of the 
electorate. For politicians experienced 
in the serious business of the day-to-day 
function of government, this should 
come as no revelation. 
The real test of the hearings, as I see 
Ii, is the answer it provides for this 
important question.: 
Can the main tenet of democracy, that 
of government by discussion, be brought 
to bear on questions of foreign policy in 
times of crisis? 
Needless to say, I believe the Madison 
Vietnam hearings effectively demon-
strated that free discussion and serious 
dissent can and must be heard, partic-
ularly when the institution of democracy 
Is being challenged at home and abroad. 
The hearings served to revitalize the in-
stitution of free speech and affirmatively 
demonstrated that free speech, rather 
than sapping our national strength, sus-
tains it. I believe that is true notwith-
standing the fact that some of the wit-
nesses expressed reservations about the 
hearings. 
Whether we are to abandon the basic 
strength of democracy in time of crisis 
Is a serious question for democracy which 
each generation must answer anew, both 
at home and abroad. While the true 
significance of this may be lost on our 
enemies, that fact should not deny a free 
society the full exercise of the principles 
it lives by. 
In a democratic sense, the validity of 
our policies and certainly the strength 
of the popular support for them is closely 
related to the extent of participation in 
their formulation by the electorate. 
In its own way the Madison Vietnam 
hearings provided Congress with an ex-
ample of the result which could be ex.: 
pected from full congressional hearings. 
It also provided Congress a clear indica-
tion of the problems posing the greatest 
challenge to the free world and the 
United States. The future hinges on how 
we respond to other Vietnams whether 
they arise as a result of national social 
revolutions or from wars of liberation. 
It merits congressional concern, full 
hearings, and full debate. 
Throughout the testimony runs a 
strong desire for peace. This was true 
of all the wtinesses, regardless of how 
they viewed the world, questions of war 
and peace, and the issues confronting 
us in Vietnam. If the hearings served 
only to reaffirm this strongly held belief 
they served a useful purpose. 
A COMMISSION ON THE ORGANIZA-
TION OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Gorr-
ZALEZ) . Under previous order of the 
House, the gentleman from Maryland 
[Mr. MArmAsl is recognized for 30 
minutes. 
(Mr. MATHIAS asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. MATHIAS. Mr. Speaker, the 
Congress now faces an unprecedented 
challenge: the challenge of channeling 
and containing our own Government, to 
insure that its operations are always in 
the public interest. As the executive 
branch has increased in size, complexity, 
and momentum, full congressional over-
sight of the bureauacracy has become 
more difficult. It is impossible for the 
535 Members and approximately 12,000 
employees of the Congress to keep up 
with all the activities of about 21/2 mil-
lion civil servants. Yet we must keep 
up with them, if we are to enforce econ-
omy, efficiency, and accountability on all 
those entrusted with the conduct of the 
public business. 
The two Hoover Commissions of 1947-
49 and 1953-55 demonstrated the tre-
mendous contributions to the reform 
and improvement of public administra-
tion which could be made by a blue-
ribbon commission with a broad congres-
sional mandate and wide public support. 
Twenty-three of my colleagues and I be-
lieve that the time has come for another 
comprehensive review of executive oper-
ations by an ad hoc agency of Congress. 
Thus we are introducing today HR. 
11366 and H.R. 23 identical bills to estab-
lish a new Commission on the Organiza-
tion of the Executive Branch to conduct 
a 2-year review of all executive branch 
operations and report to Congress recom-
mendations for change and reform. 
I am proud to announce that I have 
been joined in this effort by the follow-
ing Members: Mr. ANDREWS of North Da-
kota, Mr. CAHILL, Mr. CONTE, Mr. CURTIS, 
Mr. ELLSWORTH, Mr. HARVEY of Michigan, 
Mr. HORTON, Mr. KEITH, Mr. MCDADE, Mr. 
MIZE, Mr. MORSE, Mr. MORTON, Mr. 
MOSHER, Mr. REID of New York, Mr. 
REINECKE, Mr. ROBINSON, Mr. RUMSFELD, 
Mr. SCHNEEBELI, Mr. SCHWEIKER, Mr. 
STAFFORD, Mr. STANTON, Mr. TUPPER, and 
Mr. WIDNALL. 
Mr. Speaker, the need for an overall 
look at our Government is clear. First, 
Government operations cannot be po-
liced just once or twice. Waste, duplica-
tion, inefficiency, and bureaucratic con-
flicts must be constantly attacked. Pro-
cedures must be continually revised to 
incorporate the most progressive meth-
ods and technology. Administrative 
structures must be periodically adjusted 
to reflect the changing emphases of pub-
lic policy and the changing relationships 
among programs, personnel and govern-
mental units. Although some reforms 
result from congressional authoriza-
tions, appropriations and investigations, 
a comprehensive study has not been un-
dertaken for 10 years, since the second 
Hoover Commission ended its work in 
1955. 
Second, the tremendous administra-
tive growth of the past decade has never 
been reviewed fully and symtematically. 
Many far-reaching programs have been 
inaugurated, including the space pro-
gram, the national highway programs, 
the National Defense Education Act, 
more recent educational assistance pro-
grams, the wilderness system, air and 
water pollution programs, the Appa-
lachia program, the antipoverty program, 
the medicare program and many more. 
The Federal research and development 
effort has expanded enormously in cost 
and scope. New relationships between 
the Federal Government and State and 
local governments, private and quasi-
public agencies, business and industry, 
and individual citizens have developed. 
Earlier this year, while studying the 
proposed Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, the Congress be-
came fully aware of the urgent need for 
coordination of the vast number of pro-
grams in just one field, metropolitan af-
fairs, in order to cut costs, maintain con-
sistent standards, and provide coherent 
information readily to State and local of-
ficials. The need for reform and rear-
rangement in other areas is equally ob-
vious. 
Third, it is time to reassert a strong 
congressional voice in reform. The ex-
ecutive branch in recent years has not 
neglected its responsibility to reform it-
self. This year alone, we have seen the 
creation of a new Cabinet department, 
the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development; the consolidation of mete-
orological agencies into the Environmen-
tal Science Services Administration with-
in the Department of Commerce; the 
realinernent of functions within the Office 
of Education; and proposals for the re-
allocation of activities among civil rights 
units. 
Led by the Department of Defense, 
more and more Federal agencies are 
reassessing their administrative struc-
tures, applying new management tech-
niques, and subjecting their operations to 
systems analysis. For example, accord-
ing to a news item, the Department of 
State is now developing a means of 
cataloging all its expenditures by coun-
try, agency, and purpose. 
Most significant by far is the Presi-
dent's recent announcement of plans to 
extend a new planning and budgeting 
system throughout the Government. As 
the President told Cabinet members and 
heads of agencies on August 25, this new 
system will enable us to: 
1. Identify our national goals with pre-
cision and on a continuing basis. 
2. Choose among those goals the ones that 
are most urgent. 
3. Search for alternative means of reach-
ing those goals most effectively at the least 
cost. 
4. Inform ourselves not merely on next 
year's costs?but on the second, and third, 
and subsequent years' costs?of our pro-
grams. 
5. Measure the performance of our pro-
grams to insure a dollar's worth of service 
for each dollar spent.

TENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN A. BLATN1K 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 1965 
Mr. BLATNIK. Mr. Speaker, all of us 
are concerned about Vietnam. Much has 
been written about this most important 
matter but few have expressed them-
selves as well as Mr. Joseph Kraft in his 
Washington Post article of September 29, 
1965, entitled, "Defeat Through Victory." 
I am proud to make his views a part of 
the RECORD: 
DEFEAT THROUGH VICTORY 
(By Joseph Kraft) - 
Cynics in Saigon used to say that the only 
thing worse for the United States than losing 
the war in Vietnam would be winning it. 
Now the full truth of that bitter jest Is 
coming home. 
In the past few months, American military 
efforts have had an undoubted success. The 
true extent of that success is not yet known. 
The only certainty is that the other side has 
not mounted a major action since July 4. 
But already, thanks to the limited military 
improvement, a dark shadow has been cast 
on the prospects for the diplomatic settle-
ment that this country needs as its eventual 
exit visa from Vietnam 
The first political consequence of the rela-
tive military success has been a boost for 
the military junta comprising the Saigon 
regime. The Vietnamese generals have used 
their new strength against all moves for ne-
gotiating with the other side. 
All summer long, the generals have been 
successfully resisting American suggestions 
for an exchange of prisoners with the Viet-
cong rebels. The three prisoners executed 
in the stadium at Danang last week were not 
as widely reported in the American prep, 
even Vietcong terrorists. They were political 
opponents of the military regime who had 
led demonstrations in favor of negotiations. 
The attitude of the Saigon generals seems 
to be shared by many American officials in 
Vietnam. Military briefings have yielded a 
flood of optimistic accounts, accompanied by 
statements that, with the tide running so 
favorably, it would be a mistake even to 
talk about negotiating with the other side. 
That Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge op-
posed the almost innocuous mention of ne-
gotiations in Ambassador Arthur Goldberg's 
speech to the UN. General Assembly seems 
to be an apt expression of the mood in 
Saigon. 
The perceptible stiffening on the part of 
the Saigon regime and the United States 
finds its counterpart on the other side. The 
execution of two American prisoners by the 
Vietcong this week is only the most dramatic 
sign of increased Communist militancy on 
Vietnam. 
A far more important sign of the new hard 
line lies in a formal communique put out by 
North Vietnamese Foreign Ministry on Sept. 
23. In the communique, Hanoi, for the first 
time, denounced President Johnson's various 
peace offers in the accents of Peiping. 
Among other terms borrowed from the Chi-
nese, the communique uses the epithets 
"tricks," "maneuvers," and "mere swindle." 
At the same time, the communique does 
an about-face on the most hopeful note ever 
sounded by Hanoi on negotiations?the four-
point progi?am enunciated by Premier Pham 
Van Dong on April 8. At that time it was 
not clear whether the four points were to 
be conditions for negotiations, or merely a 
declaration of principles. But it has now 
become known that on May 18, just before 
the end of the pause in the bombing of North 
Vietnam, Hanoi officially told Washington 
through its representative in Paris that the 
four-point program was not to be considered 
as a set of preconditions for negotiations. 
In the communique of September 23, Hanoi 
pointedly reverses the May 18 position to 
make the four points an absolute pre-condi-
tion of any talks. The communique says: 
"The U.S. Government must solemnly de-
clare its acceptance of this four-point stand 
before a political settlement of the Vietnam 
problem can be considered." 
On both sides, in other words, progress 
toward negotiations has been braked. Be-
cause it seems to be winning militarily, the 
United States does not seem to be suffering 
from the new deemphasis on finding a diplo-
matic solution to the Vietnam problem. In-
deed, there are some American officials who 
believe that with a little more pressure, the 
Vietcong effort will lose momentum, and then 
collapse entirely. 
In my view, however, the United States, far 
from being the big gainer in the most recent 
developments, is the main loser. The history 
of guerrilla wars in China, in Vietnam, and 
in Algeria shows that the insurgents can 
sustain years of defeat, and still keep going. 
They have no need, accordingly, for a truce 
and then a treaty that spells out a settle-
ment. 
But this country, unless it is prepared to 
go on fighting in Vietnam year after year, 
does need such a treaty. More than any 
other par,ty to the conflict, in fact, this coun-
try has an 'interest in a formal settlement. 
For short of a very long war, that is the only 
way that American obligations to South Viet-
nam can be honorably met. 
The recent military ccesses, in other 
words, can serve the lo -run American in-
terests only if the vict es not belong 
to the spoils.

ON OF REMARKS 
OF 
T MAS C. 1V1cGRATH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 1965 
Mr. McGRATH. Mr. Speaker, every 
American, every civilized human being, 
should be deeply shocked, as I am, at the 
declaration by the Government of North 
Vietnam that they intend to execute 
American servicemen captured by them 
in the future in utter disregard of the 
Geneva convention, to which they are 
a signatory. 
It is already sufficiently shocking that 
the North Vietnamese have committed 
murder within the past week, executing 
without trials two captured U.S. serv-
icemen. They were soldiers following 
the orders of their superiors in war. As 
such, their execution in obvious reprisal 
for the executions?after trials?of three 
Vietcong members convicted by the 
South Vietnamese of being engaged in 
terrorist activities out of military uni-
form and among the civilian population 
of South Vietnam, can only be considered 
an act of wanton murder. 
The North Vietnamese announcement 
that uniformed American servicemen 
captured in the future will be similarly 
murdered is as great a shock to the 
sensibilities as were the grisly murders 
during the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya 
and the blatant savagery witnessed in 
the Congo. 
The idea of "civilized warfare" is, it 
seems to me, a contradiction in terms, 
yet there are rules by which warfare 
is conducted and the Government of 
North Vietnam, by signing the Geneva 
convention, has pledged itself to con-
duct warfare within these rules. The 
murders of uniformed soldiers without 
trials, and the threats to commit future 
murders as reprisals must place the Gov-
ernment of North Vietnam outside the 
group of civilized nations of our world. 
Just as disturbing to me, Mr. Speaker, 
as are the wanton murders of prisoners 
of war by the North Vietnamese is the 
complete silence with which the acts al-
ready committed and those threatened 
by that Government has been accepted 
by the world at large.

tical to make use of a gas which ren-

from Fort Bliss to Huntsville. Head of the 
group was Wernher von Braun. 
General Toftoy toured the Nation, with-
out much success, trying to lure industry 
to Huntsville. In the meantime a group of 
citizens organized to offer machine shop 
work to support the new Army Ballistic 
Agency. That was the birth of Brown En-
gineering. 
Redstone began moving into high gear in 
1956 when Gen. John B. Medarie was assigned 
its commanding officer. Huntsville, then 4.7 
square miles, annexed some 40 square miles 
that year, enabling extension of municipal 
services and opening the door for new 
growth. Gov. James B. Folsom held the 
legislature in session to allow advertisement 
of an annexation bill. 
Citizens built homes or apartments to rent 
and listed them with the chamber of com-
merce; and still do today. Another group 
of citizens bought a deserted textile mill 
near downtown to turn it into an office com-
plex that now houses 5,000 aerospace work-
ers. 
The city donated 300 acres for a University 
of Alabama Extension Center. The city and 
county each gave $250,000, or two-thirds the 
cost of the building. That building, Morton 
Hall, was dedicated in 1961. 
Alabama citizens also voted a $3 million 
bond issue that year to build a University of 
Alabama Research Center in Huntsville. 
Established at the request of Marshall Center 
and the missile command, it supports the 
graduate and undergraduate programs and 
received a $600,000 grant from the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
More land was needed for expansion. 
Again the city and county chipped in $200,-
000 each for the property and paid for site 
Improvements. Huntsville has contributed 
or pledged more than $2 million in the past 4 
years to higher education. 'The university's 
engineering graduate program is the South's 
largest in the number of students enrolled. 
To control land development near the 
research institute and university campus, a 
nonprofit corporation was formed and the 
area zoned as a research perk. The corpora-
tion bought $1y2 million worth of land and 
sells it to industry at cost plus interest and 
low development costs. The university gets 
any profits. Nerrin quotes leading U.S. busi-
nessmen as saying: "Without exception, this 
is one of the most amazing developments 
taking place in the Nation." 
The city is building an average of three 
schoolrooms a week to avoid double sessions. 
Last December another 5-mill property tax 
Was passed, 3 to 1, to finance school construc-
tion. Huntsville has 82 schools and 80 per-
cent of its 1964 graduates went to college. 
The 2-year-old art council held its second 
annual festival of arta in April. From Jan-
uary through March, 45 cultural events were 
presented in the area. 
Thrasher summed up the impact of Hunts-
villa last fall, telling NASA Administrator 
James E. Webb: "It is our firxn belief that 
no community in America has done more, 
or with greater enthusiasm and dispatch, to 
create a local climate designed to attract and 
keep the scientists and skilled personnel 
necessary for a successful space center." 
This is why Huntsville can justify a dif 
ferent tag every day of the week. This is 
why Huntsville haS growpawer. 
The Powerful Society 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. W. E. (BILL) BROCK 
OP TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 1965 
Mr. BROCK. Mr. Speaker, we are all 
aware of the President's role in averting 
an impasse between labor and manage-
ment in the recent steel case. While 
the short-term results of this action may 
be good, it is incumbent on us to ascer-
tain if his power- does not negate the 
Independence of free and collective bar-
gaining which I believe is a mainstay in 
our overall economic system. 
The role of government must not be 
to seek power for its own end, but to ex-
pand freedom. While the short-range 
use of power may be good, it has the 
effect, sometimes, of endangering initia-
tive, self-confidence, and self-reliance. 
In the October 4 Newsweek, Henry C. 
Wallich provides keen insight into the 
Power of the Great Society. Under 
unanimous consent I place his article 
"The Powerful Society" in the Appendix 
of the RECORD: 
TEE PoweRrut Socierr 
(By Henry C. Wallich) 
The President's masterful handling of the 
steel case has taken us a long step into the 
Great Society. While the imMediate results 
of the President's action are alitost wholly 
good, this is far from true of all that now 
seems to be taking shape farther down the 
road. 
What seems ahead is not the usual bug-
aboo of a drastically enlarged public sector. 
Instead, new powers are being generated 
within the existing scope of the public sector, 
some of which have nothing to do with public 
expenditures. Will the Great Society give 
the President intolerable amounts of power? 
The size of the public sector has been a 
test applied by the economists to measure 
the role of government in the economy. 
Measured by the ratio of government expendi-
tures to gross national product, the public 
sector doubled from 1929 to 1940. It gained 
moderately from 1940 to 1955, and surpris-
ingly little thereafter. Almost all the in-
crease since 1955, moreover, came from States 
and local authorities. The Federal Govern-
ment has kept its spending almost perfectly 
in line with the mounting gross national 
product. Great Society programs hereafter 
may help raise the ratio, especially if Viet-
nam pushes up defense as well. But so far 
the public-sector threat has been kept at 
arm's length on the Federal level, where it 
counts. 
THE MANIPULATED 
Something else, however is happening. 
Within the stable share of the Federal budget, 
new programs are coming in as old ones are 
shrinkage. Some of the old ones packed con-
centrated power in small sectors. One need 
only remember former President Eisenhower's 
concern at the time of his retirement over 
the unholy alliance of political figures, mili-
tary men and large defense manufacturers. 
The poWer relationships created by Great 
Society programs are much broader and more 
subtle. The poverty program, medicare, rent 
subsidies, aid to education reach vast new 
numbers of people. It seems as if in the Great 
Society everybody will be beholden to the 
government for benfits, privileges and favors 
through which he can be manipulated. 
A few examples suffice. If the people of a 
town don't want to handle their poverty 
funds according to the rules laid down by 
the director in Washington, he can hold up 
the money. Some low-income earner may 
not like the Government's policies in Viet-
nam?but part of his rent money comes 
from the present administration, and before 
he votes it out of office, he wonders whether 
another would continue the program. A 
physics professor wants to criticize the Gov-
ernment in public, but his research money 
comes from the Defense Department, and 
perhaps he is wise if he keeps quiet. At what 
point does a healthy preference for the side 
of our bread that is buttered begin.to smack 
of corruption? 
6 
A 552 5 
COSTLY POWER 
Powers unrelated to the budget also grow. 
A steel Strike is avoided, the inflation threat 
averted?but at what cost in terms of in-
dustry and labor's capacity to bargain? The 
balance of payments is saved, capital out-
flows curbed by the President's voluntary pro-
gram?but how long will it be till these con-
trols must be made statutory? Both uses of 
power have been good, in intention and in 
immediate results. The short-run cost of 
inaction would have been high. But each 
such tour de force threatens the long-run 
ability of the Great Society to handle its 
affairs-
I doubt that a realistic answer will be 
found in forswearing the President's meth-
ods_ It would be foolish to argue in the face 
of success. He probably will not be able to 
bequeath his power to his successor, although 
some of it may stick. Certainly it would be 
worse if Congress made the power statutory. 
But we must compensate for a greater role 
of government on some fronts by strength-
ening freedom on others. We must see to it 
that Federal money and Federal control do 
not become synonymous. States, munici-
palities, universities and individual recipients 
of Federal benefits must have the greatest 
independence in the use of Federal money 
assigned to them. No doubt this will lead 
to inefficiency and waste. But it will 
strengthen the people against their Gov-
ernment and it will help keep the Great 
Society a good society.

brates 25 Years on Federal Bench 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. FRANK ANNUNZIO 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 1965 
Mr. ANNUNZIO. Mr. Speaker, today 
Is the 25th anniversary of Chief Judge 
William J. Campbell's appointment to 
the Federal District Court of Northern 
Marking this milestone in his career, a 
reception and dinner will be held this 
evening in his honor by the Bench and 
Bar of Chicago. It is expected that, 
more than 500 persons will attend in-
cluding Governor of Illinois Otto Kerner. 
Mayor of Chicago Richard Daley, Chief 
Judge John S. Hastings of the U.S. Court 
of Appeals, and other judges from the 
Federal appellate and district courts. 
Judge Campbell, at the age of 34, was 
one of the youngest men ever to be 
named as a Federal judge. He became 
chief judge of the Federal district court 
In 1959, and today serves not only in 
that capacity, but alto as chairman of 
the Budget Committee of the Judicial 
Conference of the United States. 
I have known Judge Campbell for 
over a quarter of a century and first had 
the privilege of meeting him when he 
was U.S. district attorney for the north-

dered its Vietcong enemies ill at their 
stomachs for a brief period, the hue and 
cry around the world was deafening. 
This harmless gas?used by the police 
forces of many of the nations which were 
most vocal against our use of it in war-
fare?was not in contravention of any 
article of the Geneva Convention. 
Yet, the world?our friends as well as 
our enemies?literally "ganged up" on 
us, and we stopped using the gas. 
But in the face of wanton murder by 
the North Vietnamese, where are those 
voices of condemnation which felt no 
compunction about berating the United 
States for a harmless "legal" act of war-
fare? There has been no hue and cry 
over the murders of two captured Amer-
ican airmen. Neither our friends nor 
our enemies have seen fit to voice com-
plaint or protest. 
Is not murder an atrocity of higher 
magnitude than the causing of upset 
stomachs? 
Mr. Speaker, in the Philadelphia In-
quirer of Wednesday, September 29, an 
editorial entitled "Red Atrocities, Amid 
Silence," discusses this point eloquently. 
For the further edification of my col-
leagues, I insert that editorial from this 
outstanding newspaper in the RECORD: 
RED ATROCITIES, AMID SILENCE 
Where are all the protesters now? 
What has happened to the voices of the 
self-righteous critics of American policy in 
Vietnam? - 
Why are they not speaking out with wrath-
ful indignation against the latest atrocities 
committed by the Communists? 
How is it that no mass picketing has been 
organized at Red embassies and consulates 
in this country and abroad to demand an end 
to the brutal, coldblooded execution of 
American prisoners of war and South Vietna-
mese civilians? 
The Communists in Vietnam have boasted 
PO the world, by radio, that two U.S. service-
men captured in 1963 have been put to death. 
There was not even the pretense of a trial 
on any charges. The implication is unmis-
takably clear that the men, probably selected 
at random, were murdered for no cause ex-
cept as a brutal and totally irrational re-
prisal for death sentences imposed and car-
ried out by the South Vietnam Government 
against three Vietnamese terrorists who Were 
tried and convicted on capital charges in a 
South Vietnam court. 
As the U.S. State Department asserted, in 
its official protest of this outrage committed 
by the Communists, the execution of pris-
oners of war as an act of reprisal is specifi-
cally prohibited by terms of the Geneva con-
vention, which was signed by North Vietnam 
and most other countries. These executions 
of captured Americans were, in the State 
Department's well-chosen words, "two more 
acts of brutal murder" that "violate the 
sense of decency of all civilized men." 
On the heels of this atrocity against Amer-
icans comes word of an equally barbaric 
execution of a South Vietnamese village 
chieftain. Communist guerrillas who over-
ran the area tied him to the village flagpole 
and shot him. Two other South Vietnamese 
officials in the village and two South Viet-
namese women also were slain, according to 
official U.S. reports. 
Chronic critics of American policy in south-
east Asia are fast on the draw when it comes 
to condemning any and every act by U.S. 
troops in their efforts to hold the' line against 
Communist aggression. There is a strange 
silence among these same critics, however, 
when details of the incessant campaign of 
Communist terror are brought to light. They 
conveniently ignore, also, the fact that the 
Reds have rejected repeatedly U.S. offers for 
unconditional peace negotiations. 
Misguided advocates of retreat and ap-
peasement, who so glibly urge that "the 
United States get out of Vietnam," should 
give some thought to the horrible fate that 
would lie in store for the South Vietnamese 
after they were left, abandoned and defense-
less, to the not very tender mercies of the 
ruthless Red enemy. 
Reinforcing Civil Rights 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ROBERT N. C. NIX 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 1965 
Mr. NIX. Mr. Speaker, I wish to ex-
press my very favorable reaction to the 
President's reorganization of the Federal 
Government's civil rights activities. I 
deem the result to be one which exempli-
fies improvements both as to organiza-
tion and administration of these very 
vital operations. 
Until this change was made Federal 
civil rights activity was scattered about 
among a variety of departments and 
agencies in a rather haphazard fashion. 
Accordingly, responsibility was hope-
lessly divided and efficient enforcement 
of civil rights legislation and policies was 
seriously hampered. 
Consolidation of the apparatus for en-
forcing civil rights laws is, by virtue of 
reorganization, a giant step in the right 
direction. Noting this, the Philadelphia 
Inquirer commends the action under the 
President's,Executive order in these 
words whic I insert in the RECORD: 
REINFORCING CIVIL RIGHTS 
The effectiveness of civil rights legislation 
depends, naturally, upon enforcement. En-
forcement can be handicapped if responsibil-
ity is dispersed, authority is uncertain, and 
time and effort are wasted by duplication. 
President Johnson's reorganization order 
Is intended to achieve greater coordination of 
Federal measures to eliminate discrimination 
by "getting people out of other people's way," 
as Vice President HUMPHREY has expressed it. 
Getting civil rights laws on the books is 
one thing; making sure there is no delay or 
confusion in putting them to work, is an-
other. 
Under the reorganization plan there need 
be no speculation as to which Federal agency 
handles which phase of civil rights. Thus, 
the Civil Service Commission will make cer-
tain that the Federal Government has no dis-
criminatory personnel policies; the Secretary 
of Labor will insure compliance by Govern-
ment contractors with nondiscrimination re-
quirements; the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission will handle discrimina-
tion in private businesses. 
The Civil Rights Commission will become 
the principal factiinding agency in the civil 
rights field, and the Justice Department will 
be responsible for coordinating all the Fed-
eral enforcement policies in the civil rights 
area. 
The reorganization will do away with cer-
tain agencies and streamline others. It 
should bring about greater efficiency and less 
buckpassing, in Government efforts to pro-
tect and promote the civil rights of all 
Americans. 
Time To Close Job Corps 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. RICHARD L. ROUDEBUSH 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 1965 
Mr. ROUDEBUSH. Mr. Speaker, the 
$10 million Job Corps program at Camp 
Atterbury, Ind., has been an expensive 
failure thus far, and all indications are 
that the Government intends to plow 
more millions into the project. 
Controversy, dissension, turmoil, in-
excusable behavior and criminal charges 
have been the result of the project thus 
far. 
A total lack of discipline has been 
evidenced at the Atterbury Job Corps 
Center?a basic requirement for our 
young men in the armed services and in 
useful occupations. 
I was recently appalled to read a Job 
Corps newspaper publication which 
featured a story on the draft which was 
written from the standpoint that being 
drafted was unlikely and if one was un-
lucky enough to be drafted his chances 
of serving in a battle zone were remote. 
The article concluded that even if a 
Job Corps man should be drafted he 
would likely only be a replacement for 
some serviceman with more time in serv-
ice, on regular Army personnel, who are 
expected to do the fighting and dying in 
Vietnam. 
It has even been suggested by 
apologists for the administration that 
the Job Corps experiment in Indiana has 
not proved to be a success because 
Indiana is full of rightwing extremists 
and the people of the Hoosier State are 
hostile. 
This is utter propaganda, of the type 
we are accustomed to hearing, and the 
truth of the matter is that the people of 
Indiana have sought to make these boys 
welcome. 
An Indianapolis racetrack operator 
recently invited about 30 of the corps-
men as his special guests for an evening's 
racing, and they responded by shouting 
obscenities at women; creating a small-
scale riot and after being dispersed from 
the track, threw sticks and stones into the 
crowds, according to newspaper accounts 
of the incident. 
In an effort to whitewash the situation 
at Atterbury, where there are twice as 
many employees on the payroll as there 
are Job Corps men, the Job Corps heir-
archy has dispatched "inspection teams" 
to Atterbury. 
Glowing reports have been issued after 
these trips. My information is that One 
group of inspectors was comprised of 
sociology students just recently gradu-
ated from college. 
I have inspected the camp myself and 
found the vocational training facil-
ities woefully inadequate. Perhaps the 
theory behind such a program is good, 
but the administration in this instance 
has been poor. 
The Indianapolis News, the leading 
metropolitan afternoon newspaper in In-
diana, has done a fine job of reporting

the facts on the Atterbury Job Corps 
project. 
Mr. Ross Hermann, an editorial writer 
for the News, has visited the camp and 
interviewed many people connected with 
the project. His writing is informed, ac-
curate, and constructive. I offer for the 
RECORD, Mr. Hermann's latest story on 
the camp, and another article from the 
Indianapolis Star depicting the recent 
incident at the Indianapolis Speedrome. 
The articles follow:, 
[From the Indianapolis News, Sept. 28, 19651 
TIME TO CLOSE JOB CORPS? 
(By Ross Hermann) 
Official discussions of the ill-fated Job 
Corps center at Camp Atterbury have tended 
to ignore one of the more obvious solutions: 
Why not close Camp Atterbury and send its 
trainees to centers elsewhere? 
That suggestion is dismissed without seri-
ous consideration by Job Corps officials, 
among them Federal Project Manager Dr. 
John H. Kennedy, who says such action would 
be too expensive and politically explosive. 
The present state of affairs at Atterbury 
suggests, however, that it might be more 
expensive and politically embarrassing to 
continue operating the center. 
Atterbury's most recent crisis, which 
brought a three-man inspection team from 
Washington, centers on the lack of an ef-
fective vocational training program, a con-
dition which caused Federal officials to stop 
Bending Job Corps recruits to the local 
center. 
In the absence of new recruits, Atterbury's 
enrollment is dropping steadily, the victim 
of mass departures by disenchanted corps-
men and transferrals to other centers. At 
present, Atterbury has only 269 trainees?
down from 632 last spring. If the Federal 
ban on new assignments remains in effect 
for long the program could become extinct 
on its own accord. 
In contrast, Atterbury now has 498 em-
ployees?almost twice the number of corps-
men. 
Local Program Director Dr. James Bryner 
assures the press that development of the 
vocational program is progressing and the 
center will have a capacity enrollment of 
2,600 corpsmen by next May. The first of 
the new recruits, he says, will start arriving 
this November. 
Federal officials, however, are more guarded. 
The inspection team expressed favorable re-
action upon leaving the center, but no deci-
sion has been made yet on whether to resume 
assignments. Federal Director Dr. Otis 
Singletazy, who will receive the team's report 
tomorrow, will say only that the ban will 
remain in effect "until such time as they 
convince me beyond any doubt that a suc-
cessful vocational training program is in 
operation." 
With the ban in effect and enrollment 
dropping, program officials have continued 
spending money in an attempt to regain 
full Federal favor. With an estimated 43.4 
million already spent since the camp opened 
last spring, officials are now putting out 
another $1.7 million to renovate barracks. 
Another $7 million is expected to be spent 
in the next year?without definite assurance 
there will be any corpsmen around by that 
time. 
These facts suggest a conclusion from 
which Federal and local Job Corps officials 
shrink. More than $7 million could be saved 
if the camp were closed immediately and the 
remaining corpsmen sent to other centers. 
Events of the past 2 weeks indicate the 
center's troubles are tenacious, particularly 
in the absence of policy changes officials so 
far have been unwilling to make. 
A month ago, Director Bryner fired nine 
"resident assistants" (counselors) and de-
clared his action 'solved all personnel prob-
lems. Last week he dismissed Procurement 
Director Franklin B. Mitchum, charging 
"sloppy purchasing procedures." Mitchum, 
in turn, charges: "I was fired because I re-
peatedly questioned purchase orders which 
I thought were out of line. I tried to do my 
duty to the corps and the taxpayers." 
Similarly, Bryner stated recently that all 
troublemakers had been weeded out of the 
program. Shortly afterward, according to 
a sheriff's office report, corpsmen were in-
volved in a riot at the Indianapolis Speed-
rome, sparked when six of the youths shouted 
obscenities at women entering a rest room. 
What might have happened at the Speedrome 
if "troublemakers" had not already departed 
the program is a matter of speculation. 
Official policy toward discipline is un-
changed, despite Atterbury's periodic out-
breaks. Federal officials, mindful of their 
prerogatives, decline to give the local direc-
tor authority to dismiss delinquents from 
the program. Such a decision can come only 
from. Washington. And Director. Bryner says 
he is satisfied with present procedures and 
declines to seek such authority. 
These facts, in themselves, inspire little 
confidence in the corps' future, particularly 
if the ban on new recruits is lifted. Policies 
that fail to control 269 corpsmen can hardly 
be expected to do better with 2,600. 
RPEFDROME SPECTATORS, JOB CORPS MEN RIOT 
[From the Indianapolis Star, Sept. 20, 19651 
A woman was injured Saturday night when 
a riot broke out at the Speedrome, Kitley 
Avenue and U.S. 52, between members of the 
Federal Job Corps stationed at Camp Atter-
bury and spectators, a deputy sheriff said. 
The ruckus started when 6 Job Corps 
men, sitting at the south end of the race-
track with 29 other Job Corps members, be-
gan shouting obscenities at women entering 
a restroom, Deputy Sheriff D. J. Oberlies 
said. ? 
The Job Corps youths were special guests 
at the Speedrorae. 
When 15 of the youths went to stand in 
front of the restroom at the back of the 
Stands, continuing the vocal barrage, irri-
tated spectators sought to silence them, the 
deputy said. About 50 persons were involved 
in the fracas. 
After the Job Corps youths finally were 
ushered from the Speedrome, the six who 
had started the melee retaliated by throw-
ing sticks and stones into the crowd, the 
deputy reported. 
Arrival of police and deputies halted the 
melee. 
Mrs. Shirley McKinney, 37 years old, 1933 
Mann Drive, a waitress at a stand operated 
by her husband, George N. McKinney, 37, 
suffered lacerations on her arms when she 
tried to stop the fighting, the deputy said. 
Oberlies declared there was evidence the 
Job Corps Men who started the fight had il-
legally purchased beer. 
Oscar Brigenbine, 52, 2910 East New York 
Street, entertainment director of the camp 
who accompanied the youths, said he was not 
around when the fighting started. 
Speedrome owner Leroy Warriner, 48, 
former race driver, said the Jobs Corps Men 
would never again be invited back to the 
Spec drome. 
Instructions to Student-Instructors 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OP 
HON. SAMUEL L. DEVINE 
or onto 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 1965 
Mr. DEVINE. Mr. Speaker, the very 
able Novice G. Fawcett, president, the 
Ohio State University, delivered a very 
enlightening address to the town 
student-assistants in preparation to 
their welcoming the freshman ladies at 
O.S.U. 
President Fawcett's remarks were 
made on September 22, 1965, at Coltun-
bus, Ohio, as follows: 
AN ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT NOVICE G. FAWCETT, 
THE OHIO STATE 'UNIVERSITY 
If I were to give a title to my talk this 
evening, it would be "Why I Like Girls?Like 
You." 
This gigantic institution is like a mighty 
rocket whose fuse is being lighted this week?
a period in which all systems are checked 
and placed in a "go" position. I trust that 
the launching will go as smoothly as did that 
of Gemini 5 a few weeks ago. The success 
of our mission, of course, and the significance 
of the data to be retrieved will be determined 
primarily by the readiness of the university 
to receive its payload. 
And what is that payload? It is the stu-
dents?not simply because they want to make 
the journey, but rather because this uni-
versity is here as a vehicle through which 
the minds of men?and of women like you?
can find expression in all manner of form 
that keeps alive and growing a unique way of 
life; that champions freedom; that empha-
sizes compassion; that thrives on the love of 
one's fellow man; that places the honest 
quest for ;truth above all other values. 
I know I need not lecture you (you who 
are the vigorous and trusted student leaders 
on this campus) but permit me, please, to 
share with you an episode that I hope may 
come to your minds as you meet the quiet or 
noisy, timid or bold, frightened or overcon-
fident, plain or glamorous, introverted or 
intrepid freshman who may attempt to avoid 
you or who may seek your assistance. 
A traveler nearing a great city asked a 
man seated by the wayside, "What are the 
people like in the city?" and the response 
was: 
"How were the people where you came 
from?" 
"A terrible lot," the traveler replied. 
"Mean, untrustworthy, detestable in all re-
spects." 
"Ah," said the sage, "You will find them 
the same in the city ahead." 
Scarcely was the first traveler gone when 
another one stopped and also inquired about 
the people in the city before him. Again the 
old man asked about the people in the place 
the traveler, had left. 
"They were fine people, honest, industri-
ous, and generous to a fault. I was sorry to 
leave," declared the second traveler. 
Responded the venerable one: "So you will 
find them in the city ahead." 
Human nature, as you know, is a variable 
and unpredictable quality, but I shall be so 
bold as to predict that most of the new stu-
dents you meet will be endowed with a posi-
tive and enthusiastic attitude toward their 
exciting venture in higher education. You 
yourselves are aware of what an inspiring 
and enriching experience that venture can 
be, and I know that your own enthusiasm 
and sense of values will be communicated to 
all those with whom you have contact. 
What are some of the insights and atti-
tudes Which will help these young men and 
women orient themselves toward a new way 
of life and make this an eventful and mean-
ingful year for them? Certainly loyalty to 
their university and pride in being a mem-
ber of this community of scholars are among 
the important attitudes of mind with which 
to approach the enriching intellectual ex-
perience which awaits our new students. 
Again. I believe that most of our young schol-
ars will possess those attributes. 
As you well know, there is much to be 
proud of here--our position as one of the

and in this military disaster to bring about 
the overthrow of the goverionene in Sateen. 
There is reason to think that the 'mesa and 
power of the American Oates has dim* 
or prevented- the Vietcong'from' motiO 
big enough battles to win a victory over, 
Saigonese. 
? Yet, things have not come out as the ad-
ministration spokesmen hoped they WOuld, 
They allowed themselves to think theta 
demonstration of our ability to build up a 
great American force which could' not be de. 
tested would compel or persuade the Viet-
cong and Hanoi to agree to a negotiated 
settlement. Quite the contrary has hap. 
Petted. The position of the Vietcong and 
Hanoi today Is even harder than it was lama 
spring. 
Why? Why, as we have put mare and 
more of the beet troop; we have into South 
Vietnam, as we have escalated the violence 
or our attacks, have our adversaries become 
ever more scornful or our propotabl to ne-
gotiate? 
My own belief Is that they are convinced 
that, while the Americans cannot be de. 
tested, the Americans cannot win the MSC 
on the ground. nue, however, la where the 
war has to be won, in the villages of South 
Vietnam, and that is where the struggle, will 
In the end be decided. The essential fact, 
which Is beginning to seep through the die. 
patches of some of the American correspond-. 
enta. Is that while the Americans can seize 
almost any place they choose to attack, the 
Vietcong will almost surely come back once 
the ASTIOTICSHS leave. 
The war in Vietnam is like punching a tub 
full of water. We can make a hole with our 
powerful fist wherever we punch the water. 
But once we pull back our hand, possibly to 
punch another hole in the water, the first 
hole disappears. In theory, the Slavonia 
army ought to fill the hole, ought to occupy 
and pacify the places we seize. But the Sed-
goneee army is not able to do this because It 
le too small and too war weary. 
It is too small because the villages, which 
are the reservoir of available manpower are 
for the most part Vietcong in their antipa-
thies or are terrorized by the Vietcong. The 
rialgonase army is too disillusioned and has 
too little morale to occupy territory which 
the Americans have seized. What remains 
of , the flalgonese army has little enthusiasm 
for the revolving politicians in Saigon. 
There are some Republican politicians who 
think that this znesween be temente:eel* 
or ended by bombing the industrial. end

Haiphong. The President, fortunately, has

win a victory. But neither can the guerrillas

If we cannot or will not escalate the war
