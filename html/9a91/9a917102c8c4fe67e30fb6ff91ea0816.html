 China's Cultural Imbroglio
 After a year of wrangling, party leaders have agreed
 on a tough, nes' stance on cultural Policy  one that
 sNriters and artists seem determined to resist. In
 attempting to develop an acceptable and effective
 policy, party leaders Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang
 have been caught between the demands of two key
 constituencies: liberals who seek a moderate policy
 permitting greater freedom of expression, and party
 and Army conservatives who argue for strict limits on
 the arts.
 The Attack on Writers
 The party tightened its guidelines on the arts follow-
 ing the December 1980 Work Conference, where
 conservative leaders lashed out at writers who had
 openly disputed the basic tenets of party rule during
 the fall. Military leaders, including General Political
 Department Director Wei Guoging, were incensed at
 writers like Nanjing's Gu Ertan, who had urged
 writers not to be afraid to question socialism and who
 had called for an end to party interference in the arts.
 At the conference, Deng warned writers that ques-
 tioning the party's policies and actions would no
 longer be permitted.
 The military, supported by party conservatives, took
 the lead in the postconferencc campaign to silence
 outspoken critics. In late April, the Liberation .-lrnrt'
 Dui/r (LAD), published a scathing critique of author
 Rai Ilua and his filmscript "Bitter Love." The LAD
 attacked the film for its lack of patriotism, its implied
 criticism of Mao, and its indictment of the party for
 the widespread suffering of intellectuals during the
 Cultural Revolution.
 Stunned by the LAD attack, which had been approved
 in principle by Deng but had not been cleared with
 the party's propaganda department where many op-
 posed it, the party's cultural and propaganda a  ara-
 tus firmly supported dissenting, writers.
 Deng's Predicament
 The battle between these two groups has continued
 unabated since the December 1950 \W ork Conference.
 Deng Xiaoping, vkho has sought to reconcile the
 demands of Army and party conservatives for a
 tougher stance in culture with his earlier promise, to
 intellectuals of relative freedom of expression, re-
 mains in a difficult position. I Ic needs the support of
 both groups to advance his economic and political
 reform program. Thus, Deng has permitted criticiser
 of some writers but has sought to restrain their more
 zealous critics, stressing the importance of correct
 "method" in dealing s%ith errant writers. He approved
 the PLA's decision to criticize "Bitter Love  after-
 viewing the film himself, but rebuked the :Army for
 the intemperance of the I,. 1I) article.
 Although Deng has sought to assure intellectuals, ssho
 were frightened and angered b\ the Pl A's attack,
 that the party sill not abandon its earlier conunit-
 ments to them, he is clearly upset about their refusal
 to abide by party strictures. Deng is concerned most
 of all that infighting betsseen liberals and conscrvu-
 tives not interfere with the difficult policy compro-
 mises that he has crafted since December I9SO. I Ic is
 also concerned that the actions of writers will reflect
 badly on Party Chairman Hu Yaobang, vsho has been
 the leadership's spokesman on cultural affairs arid
 who is already regarded with suspicion by the mili-     25X1
 tars. Moreover, Deng and other party lc;idcrs are
 aware that the controversies of the spring, replete k%itli
 lurid reports in the Hong Kong press of feuding
 among party leaders, project an image of political
 instability to the world.

 Initial efforts to secure compliance with the Decem-
 ber line and to put an end to the bickering between
 liberals and conservatives failed. After the Sixth
 Plenum in June I98I, Deng once again took up the
 issue: he rebuked military critics but reserved his
 strongest language for liberals. In his speech, Deng
 directed sonic of his harshest comments at writers
 who despite party membership have pilloried the
 leadership. According to the leftist Hong Kong press,
 he singled out Ye Wenfu, whose poem "General, You
 Must Not Do This" greatly angered military leaders.
 Deng also criticized another poem in which Ye por-
 trayed Chairman Mao meeting Hitler in the under-
 world. Hitler shook Mao's hand and patted him on the
 shoulder, telling him, "You did a good job."
 A Modicum of Compliance
 Since the August conference, top leaders have stepped
 up efforts to bring about closer compliance to the new
 line throughout the party. In Beijing, Dengist party
 theoretician flu Qiaomu castigated Bai Hua for
 soliciting the support of intellectuals for "Bitter Love"
 the previous spring. Senior cultural figures identified
 with the liberals, including Zhou Yang and Acting
 Minister of Culture Zhou Wcizhi, made self-criti-
 cisms at an early September forum, and provincial
 leaders who had resisted the new line in the spring
 prominently endorsed it this fall.
 Most important, the People's DailI, acknowledged in
 an editorial published on 18 August that it too had
 erred in supporting liberals last spring; the literary
 Wen-vi Bao did the same in early October. Wenvi Bao
 criticized "Bitter Love'' for its deleterious "social
 impact"; the journal claimed that "Bitter Love"
 contributed to youthful nihilism and the "doubt ev-
 erything, negate everything" methods of the Cultural
 These efforts have muffled but have not ended the
 debate. Liberals, in particular, continue to resist the
 new line, albeit not as openly as in the spring. They
 have been able to marshal the quiet support of some
 provincial party first secretaries, including Guang-
 dong's Ren Zhongyi, who has told party cadre that he
 is opposed to the new policy. Moreover, IN Qiaomu,
 in a speech that has appeared recently in Hong Qi, the
 party's theoretical journal, upheld the new line but
 criticized some aspects of Mao's "Talks at the Yanan
 Forum on Art and Literature," which conservatives
 regard as the cornerstone of orthodox cultural policy.
 Conservatives, too, have resumed their attacks on
 writers. Despite Deng's injunction to exercise tact in
 criticizing writers, the LEAD continued to employ
 virtriolic and inflammatory language, accusing Ye
 Wen fu of launching "screaming bayonet attacks" on
 China and declaring that his work was "unbridled
 calumny" of the socialist system. Moreover, conserva-
 tives have challenged party theoretician flu Qiaomu's
 assertion that Mao's literary policy was badly flawed.
 Army cultural czar Liu Baiyu declared at a literary
 forum held days before flu gave his speech last
 August that Mao's "Talks at the Yanan Forum'' were
 entirely correct. More recently, party leaders in Zhe-
 jiang Province have disputed Hu's contention that
 literature should not be subordinate to politics.
 Outlook
 In contrast to the past three years, when the tough-
 ness of' party policy toward intellectuals waxed and
 waned in a cyclical manner, the top leadership now
 seems united on the need to draw the boundaries
 defining orthodoxy much more tightly and to hold to
 them. Party leaders have indicated that writers, par-
 ticularly those who are party members, will be disci-
 plined if they do not adhere to the more orthodox
 notion of "upholding the four basic principles," that
 is, no questioning of socialism or the leadership of the
 party. Recent articles in the national press demon-
 strate that the party dictum of "emancipating the
 mind," cited by liberals in support of their positions, is
 now limited to economic problem solving.

 Secret
 The vehemence of liberal resistance continues to
 surprise party leaders. Writers like Bai Hl-1a, Liu
 Binyan, Wang Mcng, and others have served notice
 that they will not back down in a confrontation with
 their critics and that they will resist policies that
 threaten their new freedoms. Moreover, the support
 for liberal policies among some propaganda officials
 and provincial leaders also suggests that the writers
 will continue to press their case.
 Continued controversy further complicates Deng's
 relations with party conservatives and provides his
 opponents, particularly those in the military, with
 grounds to attack his unorthodox economic policies as
 well as his personnel choices
 Despite the efforts of Deng, Hu, and other top
 leaders, cultural policy will remain a source of conten-
 tion in the party and in Chinese society. Whereas
 senior leaders have reached an agreement on the need
 fur a tougher stance toward intellectuals, opinion
 remains deeply divided at the middle and lower levels
 of the party. The skirmishes of the last year, more-
 over, have heightened the tension that has always
 existed between liberals and conservatives in the
 bureaucracy. Party leaders are justifiably concerned,
 too, that fractious disputes over cultural policy could
 mar or even delay important meetings set for this
 year, such as the 12th Party Congress, and complicate
 efforts to reach compromises on other issues.

 China: Correcting the Course in
 Economic Policy
 As a prelude to 1982, the Chinese leadership has
 reaffirmed the consumer-oriented policies of the past
 three years and has ordered slight adjustments to deal
 with current economic difficulties. At the December
 sessions of the National People's Congress, the leader-
 ship rejected arguments for further reductions in
 investment and resisted pressures for significantly
 raising the priority of heavy industry. For the time
 being, Beijing appears willing to accept another bud-
 get deficit this year and an uncomfortably high rate of
 inflation as part of the price that must be paid for
 continuing the economic readjustment. Further, the
 leadership now seems to be following consensual
 policies that recognize the complexity of economic
 problems and reject the dramatic, single-solution ap-
 proaches that have marked Chinese economic policy
 for most of the past three decades.
 Beijing Reviews Its Problems
 The decision to continue current economic policies
 with only minor adjustments came after a series of
 national conferences in late 1981 in which a number
 of government actions came under fire. Conferees
 generally supported consumer-oriented programs as
 well as the fight to end inflationary deficit spending.
 But a sizable minority, perhaps even a majority,
 criticized the massive investment cuts (adopted earlier
 in the year to close the growing budget gap) as too
 harsh and misguided. Some funds were subsequently
 restored, but the 30-percent reduction in investment
 spending sent shock waves through the economy. In
 practical terms the cuts meant drastic reductions in
 planned output from factories producing investment
 goods.
 Beijing used the cutbacks to discipline inefficient
 enterprises. Plant managers were told that if they
 wanted to maintain production levels they themselves
 must find customers for production in excess of
 (greatly lowered) state plans. Many managers did so
 by shifting product lines to consumer durables, for
 example, and by improving existing products or re-
 ducing prices. Others were less successful and had to
 trim production, idling machines and workers. Pro-
 duction was further depressed by the confusion caused
 by the lack of detailed guidance. Because Beijing was
 late in passing along production plans, many plant
 managers waited far into the year to make the
 required adjustments.
 Managers resorted to tactics common within the
 "socialist" system whenever quotas to expand or
 maintain output, profits, and worker incomes become
 difficult to meet. Production leaders allowed quality
 to slip, surreptitiously shifted production to other
 goods when higher profits could be earned, and
 overlooked or illegally padded costs.
 Other problems cropped up as a result of the unex-
 pectedly sharp downturn in heavy industry. Because
 nearly half of the state's total budget receipts come
 from heavy industry, the slowdown there resulted in a
 larger-than-anticipated decline in revenues. Increas-
 ingly, Beijing had to shift its attention away from the
 larger issues such as energy and the Sixth Five-Year
 Plan to deal with these short-term, tactical problems.
 By the end of September, as the decline in heavy
 industry continued, policy discussions became more
 intense. Three general lines of argument became
 apparent:
 ? Further Investment Cuts. Some in the leadership
 argued that, because the investment program was
 still too large, further cuts were necessary to reduce
 the budget deficit and counteract strong inflation-
 ary pressures.

 Approved For Release 2007/07/10: CIA-RDP03TO2547R000101140002-4
 ? Increased Investment Spending. In contrast, propo-
 nents of a high-investment, heavy-industry policy
 maintained that the earlier cuts were too severe and
 the planned shift in investment away from heavy
 industry had damaged growth prospects. Invest-
 ment, particularly in producer goods industries,
 should be increased.
 ? Slight Adjustments, No Major Initiatives. Many
 retained a belief that existing policies were essen-
 tially correct but did require adjustments.
 Zhao's Report to the NPC
 The third approach prevailed and was reflected in
 Premier Zhao Ziyang's work report to the congress.
 He acknowledged difficulties but described them as
 only temporary and cautioned against two erroneous
 tendencies: pessimism about prospects for the mod-
 ernization program and unrealistic expectations of
 quick results. Zhao's guidelines for economic work
 essentially reaffirmed Beijing's proconsumer policies
 with their emphasis on agricultural development, light
 industry, housing, and higher incomes for workers and
 peasants. But Zhao also introduced significant new
 elements:
 ? Investment spending will be raised, but most of the
 increase will go for new and better machinery and
 equipment for existing enterprises. To help carry
 this out, the state will raise depreciation rates for
 fixed assets and further centralize control of invest-
 ment funds.
 ? To make better use of raw materials, energy, cap-
 ital, and labor, Beijing will send out inspection
 groups to examine enterprise management systems
 and practices. Enterprises failing to meet new stand-
 ards for productivity, consumption of raw materials,
 and quality control within a given time period, will
 be forced to suspend operations temporarily or close
 down altogether
 In his speech, Z,hao also made it clear that Beijing
 intends to continue to pursue economic reform, but in
 a cautious way that would cause minimal economic
 disruption. Nevertheless, he also announced a policy
 that potentially could be very disruptive. /hao said

 remedy the intolerably low efficiency resulting from
 an overlapping and overstaffed bureaucracy, it had
 decided to restructure and streamline the government,
 beginning with the departments directly under the
 Council itself.
 The Economy in 1981-82
 Zhao pointed to a number of economic gains in 1981
 ? Despite severe flooding and drought, agriculture did
 well. The grain crop, up by 7.~-10 million tons
 according to preliminary estimates, may reach 328
 million tons  China's second largest.
 ? The budget deficit was reduced from 12.7 billion
 Yuan in 1980 to 2.7 billion yuan.
 ? Growth in worker and peasant incomes continued at
 near double-digit rates, as did retail sales.
 ? Preliminary data indicate a foreign trade surplus
 that niay exceed $1 billion. By August, a growing
 surplus had already boosted Chinas foreign ex-
 change reserves to a record $4.9 billion, almost
 double holdings at the end of 1980.

 South Korea: Economic Recovery
 Stalling
 Iollmking a strong showing in the first three quarters
 of I e>8 I, the South Korean economy is slumping at an
 inopportune time for the Chun government. Export
 growth, which had fueled recovery, is faltering as a
 result of xveakening demand in the developed coun-
 tries and an overvalued South Korean currency. The
 dimming economic outlook coincides with rising stu-
 dent-government tensions and increasing dissatisfac-

 groups. Continuing weak economic performance in

 Economic Readjustment
 South Korea is going through a difficult adjustment
 period stemming from overstinmulation of the economy
 during the late I 970s. 13y 1978, expansionary govern-
 ment policies and a headlong rush into heavy industry
 had created serious bottlenecks and an acceleration in
 inflation. The result was a serious erosion in competi-
 tiveness. The loss in export strength, combined with
 government stabilisation policies introduced in April
 1979 and the runup in oil prices, brought the fast-
 growing Korean economy to a halt in mid 1979. In
 1980 the economy plummeted; real GNP declined 6.2
 percent %~hile wholesale prices increased 39 percent. A
 disastrous agricultural performance and the disrup-
 tions caused by the political transition after Pak's
 assassination exacerbated the slump.
 Rcaliiing that the unchecked expansionary policies
 during the mid-1970s were largely responsible for the
 country's economic difficulties during 1979-80, Seoul
 has maintained more restrictive policies over the past
 two years. The government put top priority on slowing
 inflation s hilc aiming for moderate GNP growth, a
 gradual reduction in unemployment, and it manage-
 able current account deficit. The growth in the money
 supply xvas reduced from 16 percent in 1980 to 3
 percent in 1981, and depreciation of the won relative

 Getting Back on Track
 Backed by the government's austere policies and
 benefiting from an aggressive overseas sales effort,
 the South Korean economy began to pick up in late
 1980 and registered a stronger-than-expected perfitr-
 nmance in 198 I. Real GNP increased an estimated 7
 percent and unemployment fell slightly to 4.8 percent.

 An extremely strong export sector was the leading
 edge of this recovery. A 27-percent depreciation of the
 won in 1980 enabled Seoul to regain markets lost to
 its East Asian competitors in 1978-80. Private con-
 sunmption, on the strength of increased employment
 levels, provided an additional, albeit moderate, boost
 to the economy. Private investment, however,
 remained depressed. Capacity utilization stayed below
 levels needed to encourage spending on new facilities
 and business confidence failed to recover.
 Outlook for 1982
 Seoul had envisioned a continued strengthening of the
 economy in 1982. Strong export growth was expected
 to boost capacity rates and stimulate investment while
 the government maintained its tight rein on the
 money supply and spending. The end result, according
 to Seoul's projections, was to have been real GNP
 growth of 8 percent.
 In recent weeks, however, the government has come to
 realize that the growth projections for 1982 are
 unattainable, and its statements have become more
 cautious. The South Korean economy has weakened
 in the past three months and prospects for any real
 improvement in the first half of 1982 are dim. For the
 year, real GNP growth will probably fall to about 5
 percent with almost all the growth coming in the
 second half of the year, economic activity will be
 especially weak during the first quarter. Inflation will
 drop below 15 percent, provided the government
 maintains its austerity program.
 The Factors at Play
 The US economic slowdown will contribute to sharply
 reduced export growth in early 1982; the United
 States accounts for 26 percent of South Korean
 exports. The pace of South Korean overseas shipments
 began to slip in August and letters of credit have
 fallen sharply in recent months. The Chun govern-
 ment's policy of keeping the won closely tied to the
 appreciating dollar in 1981 has compounded the
 problem by reducing the competitiveness of South
 Korean products. On a trade-weighted, price-adjusted
 basis, South Korea's exchange rate appreciated 14
 Prospects for sales in developed-counts markets over
 the next six months are especially poor. Demand for
 manufactured goods is slowing in the United States
 and Japan, and protectionist pressure is mounting in
 Western Europe. The flexibility and aggressiveness of
 South Korean entrepreneurs, however, should enable
 Seoul to continue to expand its markets in the Third
 World. A record $10 billion in construction contracts
 garnered in 1981 in the Middle Fast, Africa, and
 Southeast Asia will ensure strong demand for South
 Korean construction materials in these ntarkets~
 Investment spending will probably remain depressed
 through at least the first half of 1982. Inventories,
 which had been reduced to normal levels, are again
 increasing and the improvement in capacity utiliza-
 tion rates has been reversed. Businessmen have re-
 mained skeptical about the durability of the recover,
 and the recent slump in exports has bolstered that
 feeling. According to a recent business survey, only I I
 percent of the respondents are optimistic about busi-
 ness prospects over the next several months. Iligh
 interest rates and weak sales have caused several large
 firms to go bankrupt over the past two years and cash
 flow problems are widespread. Even in areas Mhcre
 sales have been strong, such as shipbuilding, where
 South Korea boosted overseas orders by 02 percent in
 1981 and ranked second only to Japan in winning new
 orders, profit margins appear to be extremely low F
 The well-defined government business relationship
 that existed during the Pak years has yet to be
 reestablished under the Chun government, and a
 recently announced reorganization of the bureaucracy
 has further unsettled both domestic and foreign busi-
 ness confidence. Economic functions have been shift-
 ed from the once powerful Economic Planning Board
 to the more conservative Ministry of Finance, and the
 number of senior-level officials has been reduced.
 Businessmen are concerned about the short-term dis-
 array caused by the reorganization and the possibility
 of a longer term deterioration in the county 's eco-
 nomic policy making apparatus

 One bright shot is consumer spending, which should
 provide a small boost to the economy. Despite govern-
 ment efforts to hold increases to 10 percent, wages
 %N ill probably increase about 16 percent next year.

 Seoul's Reaction
 In an effort to restore the earlier vigor, the govern-
 ment has taken a number of steps since November to
 stimulate the economy. Interest rates have been re-
 duced three times in the past two months, additional
 financial support has been provided to the business
 community, and the won has been allowed to depreci-
 ate more rapidly since early December. The Chun
 government has given no indication that it will aban-
 don its anti-inflationary priority, however. Interest
 rates have been lowered by only about 3 percentage
 points, and Seoul remains committed to holding down
 the growth in the money su  Iy and to seeking wage
 moderation from labor                                                                                                25X1
 Political Implications
 The downturn in economic activity coincides with
 rising student-government tensions and growing dis-
 satisfaction with Chun among intellectuals and reli-
 gious groups. The rapid economic expansion of the
 Pak years is the yardstick bs which many South
 Koreans are evaluating the government, and their
 judgment of Chun will depend heavily on his ability to
 get the economy back on track. The uncharacteristic
 emphasis in the press on the gloomy economic pros-
 pects for 1982 probably reflects Seoul's efforts to
 lower these expectations. A slumping economy, nonc-
 thcless, could make the public more sympathetic to
 student criticism of the government. A downturn in
 the economy in mid-1979 contributed to the political
 instability in South Korea prior to Pak's assassination.
 Serious dissatisfaction could at the very least force the
 government to abandon its anti-inflationary policies.

 The Chinese are continuing to emphasize the manufacture of civilian goods in
 military factories. Civilian production is expected to account for alnio,t 4  percent
 of the total 198 I output from military plants as compared to only Ift percent in
 1979 and 20 percent in 1980. The most publicized products include hievclcs,
 sewing machines, electric fans, cameras, and radios. 1lilitar  plants arc also
 turning out such industrial items as mining and chemical equipment, machine
 tools, earthmovers, and production-line equipment. Moreover, the Chinese claim
 that 80 percent of' all military plants now produce some civilian good,.
 With a smaller budget at its disposal, the militar  has elected to reduce the

 national headquarters for the ground forces and as the high command for all the
 military services. The reorganization would adopt the Western model of equal
 status for the ground, naval, air, and strategic missile forces as ~~ell as the capital

 Taiwan opened a "Free China Information Office" in Copenhagen in December,
 bringing the number of its offices in Western Europe to 12. Taiwan continues to
 make progress in building what it calls "substantive relations" with countries that
 recognize Beijing. These offices, staffed by foreign ministry personnel and funded
 by Taipei, take a variety of forms, depending on what the host government will
 permit. Besides information offices, Taiwan also maintains trade and cultural
 offices: in some countries, news or airline offices serve the same purpose.

 In addition to its 22 remaining embassies, Taiwan has 36 informal representations,
 including nine in East Asia, six in the Near East, and seven in Latin America, as
 well as those in Tokyo and Washington. Apart from providing trade and
 commercial assistance and issuing propaganda, sonic offices also perform consular
 functions, including the issuance of visas. Beijing, usually consulted by the host
 government before Taipei receives permission to open an office, has never objected,
 so long as the offices remain informal.
 Ten West European nations have opened similar offices in Taipei, three of them
 during 1981. Switzerland reportedly plans to open its office early this year, leaving
 only Finland and Portugal with no offices whatever. Taiwan has only one embassy
 left in Europe, in the Holy Sec.
 Northeast Asia             Japanese Outline Trade Surplus Policy
 Tokyo's recently announced policy to promote imports will have only a marginal
 impact on Japan's expected huge trade surplus in 1982. The package includes:
 ? An acceleration of tariff cuts agreed to in the Tokyo Round.
 ? Subsidies for raw material stockpiling even though Japanese companies probably
 would have rebuilt inventories anyway.
 ? $330 million in funds already in the budget for increased oil reserves.
 ? A maximum of $500 million in foreign currency loans for emergency imports on
 the condition that the yen appreciates.
 ? A reported $90 million could be available to purchase foreign grain to be used as
 The plan also makes some vague promises for long-term solutions to the trade
 problem, such as improvements in import inspection procedures. Details of these
 proposals are expected in late January but will not include substantial changes in
 Japan's agricultural quotas.
 Exports of South Korean goods and services, including military equipment,
 dominate Seoul's growing relationship with Tripoli. This year, South Korea
 increased its sales in dollar terms to Libya more than to any country other than the
 United States, and Tripoli is now Seoul's seventh-largest export market. Sales in
 1981, primarily textiles and construction materials, probably reached $600
 million, up from $174 million in 1980. More important, South Korea won about $3
 billion in Libyan construction contracts in 1981 and has more than 10,000 workers
 There is also a small but growing trade in military vehicles and uniforms, with
 some of the latter probably being transferred by Libya to foreign subversive

 Diplomatic ties, upgraded to the ambassadorial level in 1981, facilitate the
 grossing economic relationship. Though Seoul is interested in using these tics to
 advance its diplomatic competition with the North, diverging political and
 ideological outlooks of the two countries make a more substantial relationship
 unlikely.
 South Korea Making Gains With the Nonaligned Movement
 South Korea may gain a better hearing within the nonaligned movement (NAy1)
 as a result of Iraq's chairmanship of the movement from 198_' to 1985. Baghdad
 invited Seoul, an increasingly important source of Iraq's militarN supplies, as an
 observer to a NAM-sponsored conference of labor ministers that it hosted in mid-
 December- the first time the South Koreans had attended a ministerial-level
 NAM meeting. As conference host, Iraq could invite a nonmember nation to this
 session as an observer, but North Korea  a full member since 1976  and its
 supporters would veto any formal attempt to make Seoul a permanent observer or
 member. Seoul will continue to court individual NAM members to further its
 economic interests and its diplomatic competition with P'yong>ang. South Korea
 already has official tics with 64 of the 94 NAM members; Pyongyang has official
 As part of an overall plan to meet the challenge of North Korea's superior armor
 strength, Seoul is augmenting its forward armor forces at the expense of its
 second-echelon reserves. Over the past several months, South Korea has deployed
 one tank battalion each to four frontline divisions north of Seoul. l his redistribu-
 tion will increase the capability of the ROK Army to meet localized break-
 throughs, a threat that concerns Seoul because of North Korea's ncarly three-to-
 one lead in tanks. The ROK Army's capability for neutralizing penetrations larger
 than battalion size will be diminished, however, because the only remaining sizable
 armor force in reserve is the Capital Mechanized Division, which cannot
 simultaneously cover the two most likely avenues of attack

 Southeast Asia           Thailand Shuffles Cabinet Again
 The shuffle of 19 December gives Prime Minister Prem's coalition a slight
 majority in the National Assembly and will help him defeat future challenges from
 former Prime Minister Kriangsak's newly formed National Democracy Party. It is
 the third cabinet shuffle since Prem took office in 1980 and probably will not sub-
 stantially increase the regime's effectiveness.
 Prem agreed to take the Social Action Party back into his government. The party,
 Thailand's largest, withdrew 10 months ago after being implicated in an oil
 purchase scandal. Nevertheless, other major parties in the Cabinet have retained
 most of their portfolios, with Social Action members taking over positions at the
 expense of nonpartisan technocrats and a few controversial figures. This politiciza-
 tion of the Cabinet has already led to increased infighting among competing
 coalition members and promises to draw their attention away from Thailand's
 pressing economic and social problems
 In an effort to lessen Lao dependence on Vietnam, the Thai Government is
 considering opening a third trade crossing point along the Mekong River and is
 planning further commercial initiatives. These moves follow from the Lao Foreign
 Minister's visit to Bangkok in November. The two countries also agreed to set up
 provincial consultative bodies and to cooperate more closely on refugee matters.
 The Thai Army is also attempting to undermine Vietnamese control by supporting
 cross-border insurgent operations into Laos, although the potential remains high
 for serious military clashes that could abruptly reverse the warming trend in Thai-
 Lao relations. Hanoi appears willing to tolerate increased trade between its client
 and Thailand because it makes up for supply shortages the Vietnamese would be
 hard pressed to fill.
 Prime Minister Mahathir's visit to Singapore in mid-December restored an
 amicability in relations that has eluded the two countries since their separation in
 1965. He and Lee Kuan Yew resolved several bilateral irritants and agreed to try
 to settle several others. Even before this, Malaysia's permission for Singaporean
 Air Force overflights of Malaysian territory over the past year testified to a better
 working relationship. Malaysia's lingering wariness of its ethnic Chinese and more
 aggressive neighbor was reflected, however, in Mahathir's statement that Malay-
 sia was still not ready to agree to joint military exercises on Malaysian soil.
 An apparent difference over supplying arms to non-Communist resistance forces in
 Kampuchea was downplayed by both Singaporean and Malaysian officials. They
 attribute Mahathir's statement against supplying arms to Malaysian reluctance to
 be as public about its intentions as Singapore.

 Indonesia's displeasure over Singapore's recent public initiative to keep a Kampu-
 chean "loose coalition'' going may result in a downturn in their bilateral relations,
 historically prickly in the best of' times. Indonesia is miffed because Singapore did
 not request previous consultation before airing the proposal, especially since
 Jakarta regards Singapore as too inclined toward a confrontational approach
 toward Vietnam. Jakarta will express its pique by quietly torpedoing an embryonic
 plan for bilateral use of the strategic Natuna Island group, which straddles the
 South China Sea (see map on page 21(.
 Dialogue betskeen senior military officials from both countries had gradually
 reached the point of active planning for joint military operations and sharing of fa-
 cilities on the recently upgraded base. Some consideration had also been given to
 expanding cooperation to the Malaysians as well, but if Indonesia decides other
 ASEAN members are ignoring or sidestepping its views on Kampuchea it may
 keep all neighbors off the Natunas.
 To aver! a further worsening in the trade balance without slashing imports,
 Jakarta will require foreign companies awarded government contracts valued at
 $790,000 or more to export an equivalent value of Indonesian goods. Such
 contracts have amounted to about $4.5 billion annually during the past few years.
 Trade Minister Prawiro recently announced that successful bidders on major
 government contracts will be given lists of Indonesian suppliers of processed
 rubber, plywood, other wood products, pepper, coffee, and other items currently hit
 by weak foreign demand, from which they can choose to meet the new export rc-
 quirements.
 Ixemptions will be granted to foreign companies engaged in joint ventures with
 Indonesian partners, for contracts involving concessionary financing, and for local
 purchases. The new policy could give Japanese firms an advantage over US and
 European firms. The Japanese are partners in more joint ventures, and many
 Japanese firms also have corporate ties to the giant Japanese trading houses, which
 should make it easier for them to export Indonesian products.
 In separate efforts that will hasten the promised normalization of Philippine
 politics, two new opposition parties were formed last week: the Social Democratic
 Party (SDP), led by a coalition of national assemblymen, and the Philippine

 The two new parties underscore longstanding divisions among opposition ranks and

 becoming a major uranium exporter. Australia has one-fifth of known world
 reserves.
 The action reflects a growing feeling among Australians that the economic
 benefits of uranium mining outweigh the dangers of nuclear proliferation.
 Uranium exports remain an emotional issue, however, and the decision could be
 challenged and reversed by an ACTU conference in Februar
 In 1978 the ACTU had endorsed the mining and export of uranium if the
 government negotiated adequate safeguards agreements but reimposed its ban on
 shipments a year later on the grounds that this condition had not been met.
 Flouting of the ban by some unions involved in uranium production has permitted
 a trickle of exports in the meantime.

 In a surprise move seen as a political gamble, Jakarta is cutting fuel subsidies and
 raising domestic oil prices by an average of 60 percent. The World Bank and other
 aid donors have been pressuring Jakarta to cut subsidies for over a year, but
 observers had expected the Soeharto government to maintain artificially low prices
 until after the general elections on 4 May. Stagnating oil revenues and a sharply
 weakening balance of payments forced the move. Petroleum prices have been
 frozen since May 1980 at roughly one-third world levels and will cost Jakarta $2.4
 billion for the fiscal year ending March 1982, 10 to 12 percent of government bud-
 get outlays.
