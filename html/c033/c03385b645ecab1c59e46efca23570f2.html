 FAR EAST
 Indochina:  Withdrawal from Laos
 North Vietnamese infantry regiments along
 with armor and artillery units pressed South Viet-
 namese forces hard on several fronts as the allied
 forces wound up their operations in Laos this
 week. Fighting was heavy around each South
 Vietnamese strongpoint abandoned between Ban
 Dong and the border. Intense enemy antiaircraft
 fire continued to hinder air support of embattled
 South Vietnamese forces and impeded the with-
 drawal of many of the last units.
 Communist pressure in northern South Viet-
 nam picked up sharply during the week with
 steady shellings of Khe Sanh and other allied
 positions, as well as occasional ground probes and
 sapper attacks. Thus far these attacks have in-
 flicted more materiel damage than casualties, pri-
 marily because of the heavy concentrations of
 supplies at forward bases in northern Quang Tri
 Province.
 It is not clear whether the North Vietnamese
 plan to pursue the Saigon forces past the border
 and continue their counterattack into the allied
 support complex just inside South Vietnam. Here,
 of course, they would run into American forces as
 well as fresh South Vietnamese troops.
 Near-term enemy intentions should be re-
 flected soon in the movements of the enemy units
 that have been deployed in eastern Laos to thwart
 the South Vietnamese operation. Some of these
 came from North Vietnam while others were
 pulled out of South Vietnam. Where they go from
 here may provide some clues to how they weath-
 ered recent fighting, as well as some indication of
 the enemy's present supply situation. F_

 Spring Phase of Enemy Action
 Within South Vietnam itself, signs of Com-
 munist planning for an intensification of military
 and propaganda activities have been cropping up
 regularly. Most of the current evidence points to
 more shellings and sapper probes, beginning late
 this month. Allied targets in the central highlands
 and in the area around Da Nang will probably
 come under the strongest pressure, but there may
 be more  limited actions farther south. The

 Communists near Da Nang also are planning an
 especially vigorous propaganda campaign to play
 up the recent fighting in Laos as a major South
 Vietnamese defeat.
 The weakened condition of many Commu-
 nist units in South Vietnam and their relatively
 modest activities during the past year or so sug-
 gest that any new phase will not be strong enough
 to cause any great damage to the allied position.
 Nevertheless, the South Vietnamese drive into
 Laos has given the Communists added incentive
 to demonstrate that they are still capable of
 bringing significant pressure to bear in the South.
 This factor could lead the Communists to try for
 a few attacks inside South Vietnam that will have
 a more dramatic impact than those of recent
 months.
 South Vietnam: Public Relations and Politics
 Like the enemy high command in Hanoi,
 Saigon government leaders recognize that how the
 South Vietnamese people and armed forces view
 the operations now being concluded in Laos may
 be as important as the physical damage suffered
 by both sides. With this in mind, the government
 has taken steps to mute criticism of the opera-
 tion.
 Government censors have removed offensive
 news articles even from papers generally con-
 sidered friendly to the government. Although
 there was some more or less open criticism during
 the early days of the attacks into Laos, even
 opposition  politicians have remained  publicly
 silent in recent weeks. Only Vice President Ky
 voiced a generally criticial view during the past
 week, telling the press that the troops needed
 relief and calling for an end to the operation.
 Although  Communist agitators are being
 instructed to convince the South Vietnamese
 people that the Laos fighting has resulted in a
 government defeat, the government hopes that 25X1
 the people can be persuaded to admire the fight-
 ing qualities of their forces operating in a center
 of enemy strength.
 The government is also en-
 couraging  emonstrations by a newly formed
 "Movement for Rear Support of Soldiers at the
 Front." Most South Vietnamese normally give
 first consideration to the probable effects of an
 operation directly on themselves and their fam-
 lies, and it seems likely that the government will
 emphasize that the Laos fighting has reduced the
 :nemy's capability to attack within South Viet-
 nam.
 Strange Bedfellows
 Minh and Ky are potentially Thieu's chief
 rivals for the presidency, and their joining forces
 against him would hurt the President's bid for
 re-election. The differences between the Minh anc25X1
 Ky camps over what the two men have agreed to,
 however, suggest that each is hoping to use the

 other to further his own presidential campaign.
 This casts doubt on their ability to plan any joint
 action to oppose Thieu.
 Laos: Action Up North
 The government suffered some sharp set-
 backs in the Luang Prabang area on 21 March,
 losing a number of defensive positions northeast
 ,of the city to well-coordinated  Communist
 ground attacks. Luang Prabang's threadbare outer
 defenses caved in before small elements of the
 North Vietnamese 335th Independent Regiment,
 which has traditionally operated in this area. As
 part of the pressure campaign, the Communists
 hit the Luang Prabang airfield for the first time in
 two years. Rockets damaged several aircraft and a
 headquarters compound and destroyed an ammu-
 nition dump.
 The government moved quickly to mitigate
 both the psychological and military damage.
 Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and Defense
 Minister Sisouk visited the royal capital on 22
 March. Dismayed at the performance of govern-
 ment troops and displeased with the performance
 of the commanders of Military Region 1, Sisouk
 ordered senior officers from the Vientiane Gen-
 eral Staff to move to Luang Prabang and to
 assume control of tactical operations. Some 850
 reinforcements have been brought in to shore up
 the city's defensive line, and some positions close
 to' the airport are now back in government hands.
 As a means of bringing some international
 pressure to bear, Prime Minister Souvanna called
 on the Geneva Co-chairmen to help alleviate the
 threat to the city. The King canceled his tradi-
 tional appearance at Army Day in Vientiane in
 order to remain in the royal capital. The town's
 citizenry believes that his presence affords the
 town itself-if not its airfield and military facili-
 ties-immunity from Communist attack.
 This is not the first threat to Luang Prabang,
 although the Communists are closer to the city
 and in larger numbers than they have been before.
 As in the past, the Communists could move al-
 most at will into the city, but such a step would
 be a major departure in North Vietnamese strat-
 egy in Laos. Almost without exception, the North
 Vietnamese have refrained from direct attack,
 harassments, or terrorism against major popula-
 tion centers, and Luang Prabang-because it is the
 residence of the  King-has been considered
 uniquely inviolate. It seems more likely, there-
 fore, that the current campaign near the city is
 intended to further Communist objectives in the
 countryside and to demonstrate once again to the
 Lao leadership the town's vulnerability and the
 essential precariousness of their country's situa-
 tion.
 Status Quo at Long Tieng
 The pace of military activity in the key Long
 Tieng area has been relatively high for the last
 week, but the Communist offensive west of the
 Plaine des Jarres is now two months old and has
 yet to make any substantial gains.

 On 21 March a heavy Communist bombard-
 ment forced irregulars from their positions at
 Phou Pha Sai, on the eastern approaches to the
 Long Tieng valley. The North Vietnamese are
 close enough to the main base at Long Tieng to
 harass it on a regular basis, and incidents such as
 rocketing, shelling attacks, small-unit clashes, and
 probes are a daily occurrence.
 No major enemy offensive has yet devel-
 oped, however, and since their sapper attack on
 Long Tieng in mid-February, the North Vietnam-
 ese appear to have concentrated on resupplying
 and repositioning their units, the bulk of which
 now appear to be shifting east of Long Tieng. The
 Communists have largely avoided costly, large-
 scale ground assaults against fortified positions.
 Nevertheless, some of their units have suffered
 substantial casualties from air strikes and govern-
 ment artillery bombardments. The government
 has significantly reinforced the Long Tieng area,
 and  aggressive patrolling  in  recent weeks has
 helped to keep the Communists off balance.
 Although their offensive has lost some of its
 momentum, there is no evidence that the North
 Vietnamese are disengaging. As in the past, they
 have the ability to strike swiftly and in force with
 little warning. There are now, however, only
 about two months of good weather remaining,
 and if the North Vietnamese intend to try to take
 Long Tieng, they will have to begin to push
 harder in the near future.
 The Cambodian War Drags On
 For over two months now, the Communists
 have been lying low in Cambodia. Except for the
 occasional effective sapper attack, such as the one
 that put the Kompong Som oil refinery out of
 business in early March, Communist activities in
 the Cambodian countryside have been limited to
 the kind of small-scale harassments whose im-
 mediate impact is strictly local and which, even in
 their cumulative effect, do not add up to very
 much. It is too early to tell whether this is only
 an interregnum or, in fact, the emerging pattern
 of the war in Cambodia.
 Last week, the Communists stepped up the
 action somewhat. A series of Communist harass-
 ing attacks near a small government-held town
 astride Route 5, some 25 miles north of Phnom
 Penh, caused the temporary closure of that im-
 portant highway. Government reinforcements,
 backed by air strikes, soon forced the enemy
 away from the town, but Communist troops re-
 main in the area. A few miles away rocket fire
 damaged the government's only river ferry at Prek
 Kdam, the gateway town to Route 6. This action
 apparently was designed to hinder the northward
 movement of Cambodian troops and supplies to
 Kompong Cham Province.
 An attack by Vietnamese and Khmer Com-
 munist forces on a sugar refinery 25 miles south-
 west of Battambang city caused some heavy
 damage to the facility. A large number of civilian
 dependents of the Cambodian troops assigned to
 defend the refinery were also killed. Enemy leaf-
 lets scattered during the attack threatened a simi-
 lar strike against Battambang's textile factory
 soon. Jittery government officials in that city
 have taken the warning seriously and have re-
 quested  additional  troops-possibly  including
 some who are patrolling Route 5-to strengthen
 the city's defenses. Such a pullback may have
 been one objective in the Communists' warning.
 The government is not leaving the military
 initiative completely to the enemy, however.
 Twelve Cambodian battalions, half of which are
 crack Khmer Krom units, are trying to drive
 north of Route 7 up to the Communist-controlled
 Chamcar Leu rubber plantation. The operation
 has made little headway thus far, and the force
 has reported only a few skirmishes with enemy
 troops.
 With the bulk of the Vietnamese Commu-
 nists' main-force units tied down defending their
 base areas east of the Mekong against the South

 Vietnamese dry-season offensive, Phnom Penh has
 had a good chance to breathe new life into last
 year's campaign to clear Route 6 between the
 village of Tang Kouk and Kompong Thom city.
 But Phnom Penh evidently still fears that it can-
 not  undertake any major military operations
 without the help of South Vietnamese ground
 forces and allied air support.
 The South Vietnamese in Cambodia
 No significant ground fighting was reported
 in eastern Cambodia during the week, as South
 Vietnamese forces there paused to receive fresh
 supplies and troops. The Communists carried out
 several mortar attacks against South Vietnamese
 positions near the town of Krek, on Route 7 in
 Kompong Cham Province, and near Snuol, in
 southern Kratie Province. The South Vietnamese
 suffered only light casualties as a result of these
 attacks. The enemy mortar barrage in the vicinity
 of Krek caused the destruction of approximately
 48 tons of South Vietnamese munitions, how-
 ever.

 Communist China: A Shift to the Right?
 The regime's announcement last week that
 one of China's missing politburo members has
 acquired a key party post attests to the complex-
 ity of the current infighting within the political
 cockpit in Peking. The unexpected "election" as
 first secretary of the Peking municipal party com-
 mittee of Hsieh Fu-chhih, who has been out of
 public view for nearly a year, suggests that a shift
 has occurred in the balance of forces within the
 politburo.
 Hsieh Fu-chih:
 In from the Cold?
 China's  present  polit-
 buro is composed of individ-
 uals who were often bitter
 rivals during  the  Cultural
 Revolution and who must
 necessarily  be    concerned
 with securing tenable politi-
 cal positions for themselves
 and their followers in antici-
 pation of the death of 77-
 year-old Mao Tse-tung. In-
 direct evidence suggests that
 these rivalries have been re-
 newed and extended by the
 process of rebuilding the nation's party and gov-
 ernment apparatus.
 Hsieh Fu-chih, who concurrently served as
 public security minister, was the first of a trio of
 important politburo members to have dropped
 from sight in the past year. Although the regime
 never openly acknowledged that he was in dis-
 grace, there were a number of strong indications,
 including persistent rumors that he had been cen-
 sured at a secret, high-level meeting last April,
 that Hsieh was involved in behind-the-scenes in-
 fighting within the politburo. Hence his new
 appointment suggests that he has been rehabili-
 tated politically, even though some of the circum-
 stances related to his appearance may indicate
 that he is not yet completely out of the woods:
 he did not, for example, address the municipal
 party congress; he has not yet been reidentified as
 a politburo member and minister of public secu-
 rity; and he has not appeared with other polit-
 buro members at several receptions held since his
 election.
 Hsieh's previous disappearance may have re-
 sulted from "leftist" pressure within the polit-
 buro. In his position as head of public security he
 was almost certainly involved in an investigation
 that began in January 1970 to ferret out officials
 who had supported the "May 16 Corps"--an
 ultraleftist organization that had attacked Premier
 Chou En-lai and a number of other senior leaders
 at the height of the Cultural Revolution. Accord-
 ing to Red Guard accounts, the "corps" was
 backed by a number of members of the present
 politburo, including standing committee members
 Chen Po-ta and Kang Sheng. Consequently, Chen
 and  Kang  may  have  felt  the  investigation

 threatened their political positions. Since then,
 they too have dropped from view amid rumors
 that Chen was censured at a stormy party plenum
 last summer for organizing the "May 16 corps."
 The apparent eclipse of Chen and Kang and
 the confirmation of Hsieh in an important party
 job therefore suggest that the balance within the
 politburo has now swung in favor of a loose
 grouping of relative moderates that includes Chou
 En-lai and some powerful central and regional
 military  leaders.  This  tentative  conclusion  is
 supported by other evidence indicating that in the
 process   of  reconstructing  the party and the
 government    some  of  the   militant   ideologues
 closest to. Mao appear to have been losing ground.
 These militants seem to have been unable to form
 many bases of power in the reconstructed local
 party organs, most of which are led by military
 men and veteran officials, many of whom were
 once victims of political attacks inspired  by
 radical  leaders such as Chen and  Kang. The
 formation of party committees at the important
 provincial level did not in fact begin until after
 the disappearance of Chen and Kang.
 Kang Sheng
 Neither of these two has been publicly de-
 nounced, and it is possible that they also may
 eventually be "rehabilitated." Nevertheless, even
 their return to the limelight would not erase the
 impression that the "leftists" on the politburo
 have lost a round in the ongoing struggle and have
 even less chance than before to carry much politi-
 cal clout in the post-Mao era. Indeed, this latest
 development seems to tarnish Mao's image be-
 cause of his close personal and philosophical ties
 with Chen and Kang, and suggests that there are
 constraints on Mao's authority.
 Peking Reiterates Ideological Criticisms of Moscow
 On 17 March a long, authoritative editorial
 by the major Chinese propaganda organs surfaced
 Peking's strongest polemic against Moscow since
 last April. This new blast seems intended to drive
 home the point that, despite recent improvements
 in state-to-state relations, Peking has not kow-
 towed on the fundamental ideological differences
 between the two parties and has no interest in a
 resumptionof party contacts. The Chinese clearly
 wish to set the record straight on that point
 before the 2',4th Soviet party congress begins on
 30 March and, in a sense,, the editorial can be
 taken as their response to the invitation to attend
 the congress, which the Soviets claim to have
 proffered.
 Page 7
 The attack, woven around a eulogy of the
 Paris Commune on its centenary, reiterates Pe-
 king's  long-standing  criticisms  of  the  Soviet
 ideological position and of Soviet policies, both
 domestic and foreign. In contrasting Chinese ad-
 herence to revolutionary violence with the Soviet
 brand of revisionism, the editorial accuses Mos-
 cow of going all out in the arms race while op-
 pressing people at home and abroad, and repeat-
 edly denounces Soviet party leader Brezhnev by
 name. Specific grievances against Moscow, such as
 the putative threat to Chinese territory-which
 were raised in last April's attack-are avoided,
 however, presumably because the occasion calls
 for a more theoretical or ideological statement of

 Peking's position. Indeed, the article appears to
 have been drafted with a view to avoiding insofar
 as possible language that would hamper Peking's
 diplomatic offensive in both the Communist and
 non-Communist worlds.
 Moscow on 21 March made an initial re-
 sponse to the Chinese attack in a brief TASS
 rejoinder accusing Peking of new anti-Communist
 actions and noting that the editorial was wel-
 comed by the "imperialists" because it coincided
 with the intensified fighting in Indochina and
 could  aggravate Sino-Soviet relations. Moscow
 may hold off any detailed, authoritative rebuttal
 until after the party congress in order to avoid
 dramatizing its differences with Peking and di-
 verting attention from the conclave. Meanwhile,
 in an apparently coincidental action, Moscow
 released a book by nine Soviet Sinologists that
 attacks Peking for obstructing aid to Indochina,
 attempting to reach a detente with the US, and
 seeking to foment a Soviet-US war. Although
 these are standard themes in Moscow's propa-
 ganda arsenal, press accounts suggest that the
 book developed them in an unusually explicit
 manner. Nevertheless, Sino-Soviet relations over
 the past year have been characterized by a lack of
 sustained public quarreling, and it is likely that
 the current exchange will cease once Moscow
 feels the Chinese charges have been properly re-
 futed.
 Peking has already moved to soften the mili-
 tant impression created by the polemic. Accord-
 ing to press reports, on 21 March Chou En-lai met
 for four hours with Soviet Ambassador Tolstikov
 and chief border talks negotiator Ilichev to dis-
 cuss questions of interest to both sides. Although
 details are not available, Chou may well have
 attempted to separate the problem of continuing
 fundamental ideological differences between the
 two parties from that of improving state-to-state

 USSR: Final Preparations Set Stage for Party Congress
 Soviet leaders have completed preliminaries
 to the party congress that opens on Tuesday in a
 manner suggesting that they are working to make
 it a routine and undramatic occasion. Procedural
 anomalies and undercurrents of disagreement dur-
 ing the preparations, nevertheless, are a reminder
 of the always-present possibilities for political
 clashes along with their unpredictable results.
 On  22  March  the  central  committee
 approved party chief Brezhnev's report on the
 leadership's activities since the last party congress
 as well as Premier Kosygin's report on the new
 five-year plan. Both of these will be presented to
 the congress. Consideration of Kosygin's report at
 this stage is unusual and appeared designed partly
 to make up for the central committee's failure to
 meet in February to approve the draft directives
 of the plan. A central committee plenum would
 normally act on Brezhnev's report about three
 days before the congress. Calling its members to
 Moscow this far ahead raises suspicions of in-
 tensive politicking behind the scenes.
 The last of the republic congresses-that of
 the Ukraine-closed on 20 March. There was con-
 siderable confusion in the scheduling of these
 congresses, but their proceedings were short on
 polemics. Efforts at the republic congresses to
 enhance Brezhnev's public stature followed the

 secretary evident in recent months but no band-
 wagon movement emerged. He received special
 attention and occasionally was referred to as
 "head of" the politburo at the Kazakh, Kirgiz,
 and Uzbek congresses in Central Asia, at the
 Armenian and Azerbaydzhan congresses in the
 Caucasus, and at the Moldavian congress. On the
 other hand, he was not mentioned in Estonia, and
 the first secretaries of (Latvia, Lithuania, and
 Belorussia stressed the theme of collective lead-
 ership.
 Party secretary Suslov won considerable per-
 sonal credit last week by persuading the Japanese
 Communist Party, which boycotted the last con-
 gress, to attend next week's conclave. Suslov is an
 important counterweight to Brezhnev in the polit-
 buro, and his continued activity somewhat offsets
 frequent conjectures by observers about his possi-
 ble retirement because of age and ill health.
 Discussion of political issues was muted at
 the republic congresses, and foreign policy ques-
 tions received a minimum of attention. The issue
 of Stalin's rehabilitation, raised in 1966 in Belo-
 russia, Moldavia, Azerbaydzhan, and Georgia, was
 conspicuously avoided. An anti-Zionist theme was
 evident only at the Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and
 Turkmen congresses.
 The economy will apparently be the major
 topic at next week's congress. Omission of key
 investment and other figures in the draft direc-
 tives suggests that important decisions on the
 five-year plan are still to be made. The economic
 reform of 1965 found a handful of defenders at
 the republic congresses, as did some other in-
 novations in economic management, and these
 Poland's Provincial Party Conferences Promote Renovation
 The key themes stressed by Poland's top
 leaders in recent weeks--renovation and dis-
 cipline-are now being hammered home at pro-
 vincial-level  party conferences throughout the
 country. Everyone subscribes to the concept of
 renovation, which is now holy writ, but the re-
 peated calls for discipline suggest that neither the
 workers, who want rapid change, nor the middle
 levels of party leadership, who fear for their jobs,
 are yet satisfied with the course and speed of the
 renewal process.
 When addressed to the workers, exhortations
 on discipline are more like an appeal; when di-
 rected to party members, however, they have a
 commanding ring. The leadership wants the work-
 ers to know that they have no reason to fear
 repression, but they also want them to under-
 Page  9
 stand that the country cannot afford any further
 concessions. The constant need to reinforce these
 points indicates that worker unrest, which is still
 being reflected in small-scale strikes, continues to
 give the new leadership anxious moments.
 Meanwhile, the party leadership is insisting
 on action from its local organizations. Politburo
 members attending provincial party conferences
 as guest speakers have cited the policies that party
 leader Edward Gierek developed at the central
 committee plenum last month as guidelines for
 rapid renovation and modernization. In a hard-
 hitting address to the Warsaw city party conclave,
 Gierek made clear that only qualified candidates
 who can implement modern management prac-
 tices should be elected. All others, he implied,
 have lost touch with reality.

 About half of Poland's 19 provincial-level
 organizations have now c,omp!eted their confer-
 ences, and it is already apparent that Gierek's
 message is being heeded. In some cases the entire
 secretariat-except for the first secretary-was re-
 placed. Some regions report dramatic increases in
 the number of workers and peasants elected to
 regional  central committees. The inclusion of
 authentic workers in local party organizations will
 not only reinforce Gierek's doctrine of more
 party contact with the masses, but in some cases
 it will have the added value of incorporating the
 leaders of the workers' revolt into the estab-
 lishment.
 Gierek  is determined to keep renovation
 from becoming an empty slogan, and more per-
 sonnel changes may be necessary to overcome
 passive resistance in local organizations. Not all
 the replacements will be "Gierek men" but they
 will owe their jobs to Gierek's program for change
 and they probably will give him the endorsement
 he needs at the next party congress.
 Yugoslav Emigres Increase Terrorism in West
 There seems to be an element of desperation
 in the actions of the more radical anti-Communist
 Yugoslav emigres around the world. There are
 recurrent attacks on Yugoslav installations abroad
 and last month some terrorists seized the Yugo-
 slav Consulate in Goteborg, Sweden. They at-
 tempted to ransom its occupants for $100,000
 and the release from a Yugoslav jail of convicted
 terrorist and murderer Milijenko Hrkac.
 Emigre attacks on Yugoslav installations in
 the West have been frequent over the years, and
 only recently has Belgrade had success in per-
 suading host countries to clamp down on those
 responsible.  Organizations  such  as the           anti-
 Communist, Croat nationalist Ustashi find it more
 difficult to operate, for example, in West Ger-
 many where the government, because of excellent
 relations with Yugoslavia, keeps close tabs on
 their activities. With their freedom curtailed and
 sanctuaries in jeopardy, the emigres have become
 bolder. Last year witnessed bombing attacks on
 the Yugoslav mission in Brussels and the Yugoslav
 Consulate in Melbourne, and a fire at a Yugoslav
 exhibit in Frankfurt. Early this month several
 persons were arrested in Vienna for smuggling
 arms to the Ustashi in West Germany.
 Mindful of Tito's plans to visit the US this
 year, officials in Belgrade are concerned that such
 terrorists, finding it increasingly more difficult to
 operate in Western Europe, will target Yugoslav
 personnel and installations in the US. Yugoslav
 officials claim to have reports of a plot to kidnap
 their ambassador in Washington and their consul
 in Cleveland.

 The Changing Yugoslav Reform
 Speaking on 16 March to a conference of the
 mass organization SAWPY, President Tito pub-
 licly admitted that his proposed reorganization of
 the Yugoslav federation was proving more com-
 plicated than first envisioned. Tito conceded he
 originally had in mind the creation of a collective
 presidency and only later did the need for federal
 reorganization and constitutional change become
 apparent.
 A lively debate, invited by Tito himself, has
 forced some alterations in the proposed collective
 executive body's makeup. Gone is the idea of
 including representatives of the party presidium
 and mass organizations, and at this stage it looks
 as if they will be replaced by republic and pro-
 vincial assembly presidents. This is supported in
 the Belgrade daily Politika, which reports "ru-
 mors" that the proposed collective presidency
 will be eight men larger than originally planned.
 Interrepublic rivalries, disagreements over the dis-
 tribution of power between the republics and the
 federal government, and the need for the federa-
 tion to retain the power to intervene in the econ-
 omy have caused a major slowdown of plans for
 far-reaching decentralization.
 For the same reasons that political reforms
 are in difficulty, Belgrade has been unable to
 move decisively in tackling the country's eco-
 nomic problems, and there continue to be serious
 disagreements over the federal budget and stabili-
 zation program.
 The tone of the current arguments indicates
 that differences are likely to continue until basic
 constitutional questions are resolved this summer.
 One of the more explosive problems surfacing
 during the reform debate is regional chauvinism,
 and public recriminations have recently broken
 out between Serbian party officials and promi-
 nent  Croatian  political  figures.

 France-USSR: Political Consultations Intensify
 France and the USSR have moved toward
 holding more frequent political consultations, as
 agreed during President Pompidou's visit to Mos-
 cow last October. Results so far, however, have
 been more in the nature of form than of sub-
 stance.
 Over the past month, Kosygin and Pompi-
 dou have exchanged messages through their am-
 bassadors on the Middle East, and Deputy For-
 eign Minister Kozyrev has visited Paris. Foreign
 Minister Schumann will visit Moscow early in
 May, at which time the French hope to settle
 plans, long under discussion, for a summit-level
 Soviet visit to France in October.
 The protocol signed provided for consulta-
 tions between the foreign ministries twice an-
 nually as well as for emergency sessions when
 situations arise that threaten the peace. The
 Schumann visit to Moscow is presumably to be
 the first of the semiannual political meetings, and
 the first special consultations were held at Soviet
 request in February following President Pompi-
 dou's public disapproval of the South Vietnamese
 move into Laos. The Soviets, evidently interested
 in giving the impression of coordinating with Paris
 on the subject, announced the consultations in
 Pravda.
 Since the De Gaulle trip to Moscow in 1966,
 France has sought to play up its contacts with
 Moscow to enhance its influence and to demon-
 strate its independence from the West. The es-
 sentials of that policy remain the same. An in-
 tensification of the dialogue with Moscow, how-
 ever, is especially useful at this juncture. France
 recently has been moving closer to its Western
 allies on such issues as increased cooperation with
 NATO, and frequent contacts with the Russians
 are a reminder to the West that France intends to
 maintain a balance in its relations with the two
 sides. In Paris' view, an ongoing dialogue with
 Moscow increases both its policy options and its
 leverage.
 Moscow, for its part, has evidently seized
 upon the latest developments in Indochina and
 the Middle East as an excuse to intensify its
 "special" relationship with France. Soviet cultiva-
 tion of President Pompidou during his visit to the
 USSR made it clear that France and West Ger-
 many share pride of place in Moscow's efforts to
 expand its influence in Western Europe. Moscow
 undoubtedly hopes to use its relationship with
 Paris as a lever to slow progress toward Western
 European integration. Although the Soviets have
 been unable to crown their efforts with concrete
 agreements, they probably are satisfied with the
 pattern of bilateral consultation that has been

 I n  foreign  policy,  the  new  government
 pledges to continue membership negotiations
 with the European Community (EC) and to keep
 the parliament and public thoroughly informed
 on the course of the talks. The government has
 also promised to protect the special interests of
 the farming and fisheries sectors in the negotia-
 tions and to hold a national referendum before
 parliament makes its final decision. On other is-
 sues, the government has endorsed continued
 membership in NATO, the convening of a confer-
 ence on  European security, cooperation with
 other Nordic countries, and increased aid to de-
 veloping countries.
 Following through on a commitment in the
 Labor Party program drawn up prior to the 1969
 parliamentary election, the Bratteli government
 has announced that it will "take steps with a view
 to seeking to establish mutual diplomatic rela-
 tions with North Vietnam." It is generally be-
 lieved that the commitment to recognition was
 the price Bratteli had to pay to his party's left
 wing for the strong EC and NATO planks. Ameri-
 can officials in Oslo have been assured that the
 government will not move precipitately, and there
 is some speculation that the act of recognition
 may be postponed until after the beginning of the
 new parliamentary term next October.
 The government's domestic policy planks in-
 clude such noncontroversial proposals as balanced
 economic growth, a more just tax system, special
 economic assistance to the more remote areas of
 Norway, state management of the oil industry
 based on the new finds in the North Sea, en-
 hanced environmental protection, and liberaliza-
 tion of the social welfare system. The government
 has also pledged itself to decentralizing the deci-
 sion-making process by giving more authority to
 the county councils, and to redistributing the
 responsibilities of the ministries to accord with
 the needs of modern society.
 Reaction to the government's program has
 for the most part been positive. Leaders of the
 bourgeois parties have, however, taken some ex-
 ception to the government's announced intention
 to recognize Hanoi.
 Despite these objections the probability that
 the bourgeois parties will unite to overthrow the
 government on this or any other part of the
 program is slight at this point. The bitterness
 between the Center and other bourgeois parties
 engendered by the fall of the Borten government
 remains, but all parties will probably wait until
 after the nationwide local elections next Se tem-
 ber before making new political moves.  - p~  25X1
 West Europeans Press Studies on Uranium Enrichment

 participate, the French insist that, if necessary,
 Paris will consider constructing the facility alone.
 In publicizing the feasibility study at this time,
 France is no doubt aware that the US is currently
 considering an offer to share gaseous diffusion
 technology with acceptable foreign partners. In
 addition, the French proposal is clearly intended
 to compete with the tripartite (Dutch-British-
 German) project launched last year for producing
 enriched uranium by the gas centrifuge technique.
 This intensifying rivalry for the European
 market has already attracted the attention of the
 Soviet Union as well as certain non-European
 countries possessing native sources of natural
 uranium and cheap electric power. The USSR has
 discussed the provision of enrichment services to
 Western Europe, and an enrichment contract with
 France was announced last week. France has
 already suggested to Australia the possibility of
 jointly constructing an enrichment plant there or
 in  France. The Australians are known to be
 interested in exploring various possibilities, in-
 cluding eventually  purchasing centrifuge tech-
 nology from the tripartite arrangement.
 The tripartite centrifuge project is the only
 multinational production arrangement presently
 under way, but data on whether it will be feasible
 to proceed beyond the pilot-plant stage will not
 be available before mid-1973. The Italians and
 Belgians are unhappy with terms offered so far
 for "junior partnerships" in this effort and pre-
 sumably are still candidates for participation in
 other schemes.
 Meanwhile, the initial report of a EURA-
 TOM study group commissioned last December to
 collect comparative data on projects for diffusion
 and centrifuge, as well as "jet-nozzle," separation
 is expected to be ready late this month. Whether
 this report will end support to the EC Commis-
 sion's earlier call for the establishment of an en-
 richment facility under the aegis of a presumably
 enlarged Community remains to be seen. The
 huge investment costs, the difficult problems in-
 volved in managing such a partnership arrange-
 ment as the tripartite scheme, and the commit-
 ment to a common energy policy argue for a
 Community approach. On the other hand, EURA-
 TOM has long suffered from national rivalries that
 are likely to be aggravated as the market for
 nuclear  energy  gains in  importance.
 Discussions of CES on Upward Swing
 Preparations for the NATO ministerial meet-
 ing in Lisbon in June and renewed overtures from
 the Warsaw Pact side are provoking increasingly
 active consideration by the European NATO allies
 of the possible modalities of a conference on
 European security (CES). Although the position
 the NATO countries will eventually adopt is far
 from clear, the drift ol: opinion in Europe seems
 to be toward one less skeptical than that ap-
 proved by the Alliance Mast December.
 Moscow clearly wants to sustain this inter-
 est. Following up the Pact foreign ministers' con-
 ference in Bucharest on 18-19 February, Soviet
 ambassadors  last  week  delivered  "informal"
 papers on the CES issue to the US and other
 NATO capitals. These papers reiterated Soviet
 support for such a conference, blamed Washing-
 ton for obstructing it, and repeated standard So-
 viet objections to Western demands for linkage of
 CES preparations to a Berlin settlement.
 Most NATO allies now accept the inevitabil-
 ity of a security conference, and assume that an
 initial conference probably would be only the
 first of a series. Many allies also think that some
 permanent institutions for dialogue with the East
 will be established. Although the British are still

 taking a comparatively hard line in NATO discus-
 sions of CES, Foreign Secretary Douglas-Home
 recently said that he also regarded a CES as inevit-
 able. Moreover, a British position paper has sug-
 gested that the participants at an initial CES es-
 tablish permanent machinery-possibly along the
 lines of the Conference of the Committee on
 Disarmament. Although the British say they will
 not press this point, they have in effect breathed
 new life into a project originally initiated by the
 Labor government.
 The UK and the six members of the Euro-
 pean Communities (EC) are convinced that the
 Soviets hope to use the CES process to slow the
 pace of West European integration. As a conse-
 quence, the British paper suggests a CES role for
 an enlarged EC-an idea that might also emerge
 from the newly initiated EC consultations on
 CES. The Six are taking these consultations very
 seriously, and the timing of their study suggests
 that they may come to the June NATO minis-
 terial with similar views on a number of CES-re-
 lated questions.
 In the near term, the active discussion of
 CES in Western Europe is not likely to undermine
 NATO's requirement that a Berlin settlement pre-
 cede multilateral East-West CES preparations. But
 some allies might wish in June to leave Berlin as
 the only prerequisite, dropping  insistence on
 progress in other "on going talks." Given the
 favorable inclination of many of the allies toward
 a CES, it might in the future become increasingly
 difficult even to make multilateral preparat

 some way to keep about: half of the NRP from
 joining the opposition even to gain Knesset ap-
 proval for a settlement such as that outlined in
 the Times interview. The implication in her inter-
 view that Israel would give back much of the West
 Bank to Jordan presented the NRP with a major
 crisis of conscience. For the moment, the NRP
 has been mollified by Mrs. Meir's protest that her
 statement did not constitute official policy. Also,
 the value the party places on its alliance with the
 dominant Alignment and its politically profitable
 ministerial portfolios will continue to exert a
 strong pull. Nevertheless, future government com-

 certainly raise a similar crisis, and perhaps a split
 Cairo Publicizes War-Readiness
 Cairo media this week focused on a series of
 Egyptian political and military meetings designed
 to increase the state of war-readiness in the coun-
 try. President Sadat had held daily conferences
 with various groups of military commanders ear-
 lier in the week, ostensibly for the purpose of
 clarifying the current phase of the confrontation
 with Israel.
 In discussing action on the diplomatic front,
 Egypt's press played on the theme of increasing
 US-Israeli differences and termed Foreign Minis-
 ter Eban's meeting with Secretary Rogers last
 week "chilly." The Egyptians' belief that they
 had made a significant move by agreeing to enter
 into a peace settlement with Israel and that the
 Israelis now must act was expressed in an al-
 Ahram article that stated, "The ball is now in
 Israel's court." The press also continued to stress
 the need for the US to prove its sincerity in
 wanting a peaceful settlement in the Middle East
 by pressing Israel to withdraw from occupied
 Arab territory.
 Egypt's continued diplomatic efforts were
 emphasized  by the announcement of Foreign
 Minister Riad's projected trip to Rome and Paris
 at the end of the month for discussions with
 Egypt's ambassadors to Europe. In an interview
 aired on French television, President Sadat reit-
 erated his continued adherence to the proposal he
 made on 4 February to reopen the Suez Canal in
 return for a partial Israeli withdrawal from the
 Sinai.
 Some division of opinion was evident in the
 Cairo press over the current course of national
 action. The prestigious al-Ahram  gave consid-
 erable treatment to diplomatic moves as well as to
 various  military  developments, while  Egypt's
 other newspapers adopted a more pessimistic and
 somewhat more militant tone. There also was
 more evidence of the feud over the state of the
 country's military preparedness between the chief
 editor of al-Ahram, Muhammad Haykal, and the
 more hawkish press influenced by Egypt's sole
 legal  political organization, the Arab Socialist

 More Soviet Economic Aid for Egypt
 Moscow's recent extension to Egypt of sub-
 stantial new economic assistance reinforces its
 influence in Cairo and in the country's long-range
 economic development. As in the past, however,
 the aid will have little early impact, and Moscow
 will continue to avoid becoming involved in day-
 to-day problems that plague the Egyptian econ-
 omy. The 1971 trade protocol, also agreed to last
 week, calls for a continuation of trade at roughly
 the same level as in recent years.
 The new Soviet aid package worked out with
 an   Egyptian economic delegation headed by
 Minister of Industry Sidgi apparently amounts to
 as much as $200 million for various projects. In
 addition, the discussions covered certain other,
 unspecified projects valued at more than $200
 million. These may have been included under past
 aid pacts: about 75 percent of a $324-million
 credit extended in 1964 for project assistance
 remains unused. Total Soviet economic assistance
 to Egypt so far has amounted to more than $1
 billion.
 Included in the nearly $200 million in new
 aid is a rural electrification program for which the
 Soviets have agreed to provide almost $70 million
 worth of equipment. This project will use elec-
 tricity generated by the Aswan Dam and the total
 cost is expected to be more than $250 million. In
 addition, the Soviets agreed to provide $40 mil-
 lion to cover the reclamation of an additional
 100,000 acres of land. Although the USSR ex-
 tended about $67 million for reclamation of
 200,000 acres in 1964, little information on the
 progress of this project has been reported. The
 Soviets also agreed to provide more than $30
 million for the construction and expansion of
 cement factories and for building a ceramics
 plant. In addition, $55 million in Soviet credits
 will be allocated for construction of silos and
 flour storehouses.
 The Soviet economic aid program in Egypt
 has slowly been moving ahead despite the prob-
 lems generated by the Arab-Israeli conflict. In-
 auguration ceremonies for the Aswan Dam, a So-
 viet showpiece, were held in mid-January, and
 work is continuing on the expansion of the
 Helwan iron and steel complex. Planning has been
 substantially completed on several other plants
 that will consume electricity from the Aswan
 Dam. The Soviets continue to explore for oil in
 the Western Desert although they have had little
 success thus far.
 Trade this year will remain at about its cur-
 rent level of roughly $470 million. The protocol
 specifies that Egypt will ship primarily consumer
 goods to the USSR and that Moscow will furnish
 crude oil, petroleum products, fertilizer, and cast
 iron to Cairo. Bilateral commercial trade is ex-
 pected to continue to be far more advantageous
 to Egypt than to the Soviet Union. The USSR
 and Eastern Europe probably will continue to
 serve as dependable markets for surplus Egyptian
 cotton. The USSR probably will again purchase
 Egyptian crude oil for shipment to other Com-
 munist countries and to buy much of the excess
 output of Egypt's manufacturing industries.
 Moscow's support for Cairo is also being
 manifested in the diplomatic and propaganda
 fields as well.  Israel's reply to the Jarring

 memorandum gave Soviet propagandists a new
 opportunity to press the line that the US has no
 intention of exerting pressure on Israel.
 Moscow's desire to respond to Cairo's need
 for progress in the diplomatic arena is probably
 behind the abandonment of its usual propaganda
 reticence on the Four Power talks. On several
 occasions in recent weeks, the Soviets have pub-
 licly castigated the US for its "obstructionist"
 behavior in this forum. Soviet media, however,
 have generally evaded any discussion of guar-

 Sierra Leone: Stevens Regime Shaken by Coup Attempt
 An abortive coup attempt this week by the
 commander of Sierra Leone's badly factionalized
 army has plunged the country into new political
 turmoil that may yet bring down the civilian
 government of Prime Minister Siaka Stevens. Al-
 though some of the army elements that prevailed
 over the commander proclaimed their loyalty to
 Stevens, other soldiers have apparently been urg-
 ing his removal. As of noon on 25 March no one
 had emerged in clear command of the army, and
 its squabbling factions were still trying to reach
 some agreement.
 Political tensions it Freetown had been ris-
 ing in recent weeks as Stevens renewed active
 consideration of his controversial plan to trans-
 form Sierra Leone into a republic. Army chief
 Bangura had voiced growing disaffection with
 Stevens' highhanded methods, particularly his at-
 tempt to involve the army in support of his politi-
 cal  objectives.  Increasingly  distrustful  of the
 army, Stevens had last week arranged for military
 support from his political mentor, Guinean Presi-
 dent Toure. Over the weekend, an initial con-
 tingent of some 40 Guinean soldiers arrived in
 Freetown to serve as a special security unit for
 Stevens. Their arrival probably triggered the move
 on 23 March by an army contingent to kill or
 capture Stevens,  during  which  Bangura  an-
 nounced that he was taking power. In the face of
 opposition by other-apparently more powerful-
 army  elements, however,  Bangura's support
 quickly evaporated and he himself was arrested.
 Stevens, in a recorded speech broadcast on
 24 March, claimed that he was again in full con-
 trol. In fact, however, he appears to have retired,
 accompanied by his Guinean bodyguard, to a
 sanctuary where he is awaiting a decision by the
 military. Since Wednesday the army's officers
 have been conferring among themselves and with
 the lower ranks of the 1,500-man force to settle
 on a new leader and to decide whether to allow
 the Stevens regime to continue. Deep tribal divi-
 sions, conflicting loyalties, and personal rivalries
 are all contributing to the soldiers' indecision. To
 some extent, at least, Stevens' cause has been
 damaged by his reliance on Guineans, a move
 particularly resented by many enlisted men.
 In neighboring Guinea, meanwhile, President
 Toure continues to broadcast statements pro-
 claiming his "unreserved solidarity" with Stevens
 and pointing, characteristically, to "imperialism"
 as the source of the trouble in Sierra Leone. I n an
 even more direct effort to influence the outcome,
 Toure has since 23  March  periodically sent
 Guinean MIGs on low overflights of Freetown. He
 has also kept Guinean Army units on alert, con-
 tributing to fears of a Guinean "invasion" in

 Pakistan:  East-West Talkathon
 Some progress apparently has been made in
 negotiations between President Yahya Khan and
 political leaders, but a final solution may con-
 tinue to prove elusive.
 Yahya and East Pakistani leader Mujibur
 Rahman made enough headway in their talks,
 which began on 16 March, to enlarge their meet-
 ings to include top aides on both sides. Zulfiqar
 Ali Bhutto, whose party holds a majority of seats
 from West Pakistan in the national assembly,
 arrived  in  Dacca on 21  March to join the
 discussions.
 On 22 March Yahya announced that he was
 again    postponing-this  time  indefinitely-the
 opening of the national constituent assembly in
 order to "facilitate the process of enlarging the
 areas of agreement among the political parties."
 Because he made the announcement after con-
 sulting with both Bhutto and Mujib, the post-
 ponement this time aroused little negative reac-
 tion in East Pakistan and was apparently taken as
 a sign of progress in negotiations.
 Although Bhutto claimed on 22 March that
 he was studying an agreement already reached
 between Yahya and Mujib, the latter publicly
 denied that any agreement existed.
 Yahya in his message to the nation
 on 23 March, Pakistan's National Day, asserted
 that "the stage is now set" for the politicians to
 achieve a "smoothly working, harmonious sys-
 tem." The next day leaders of several minor West
 Pakistani  parties who had just returned from
 Dacca claimed that Yahya and Mujib had reached
 "complete agreement" on a solution to the crisis.
 The seemingly contradictory assessments by
 the three principal figures could stem from their
 differing views of what remains to be  accom-
 plished. Mujib may think that details yet to be
 worked out are so important as to preclude any
 statements at present about a solution. Bhutto,
 by alluding to his role in reviewing the alleged
 agreement, may be trying to ensure his position as
 principal spokesman for West Pakistan. Although
 some press reports at midweek claimed that plans
 for an interim government had virtually collapsed,
 Bhutto affirmed there was a 50-50 chance that
 such a government would be formed.
 Occasionai incidents of violence have con-
 tinued in East Pakistan, the most serious on 24
 March when several East Pakistanis were killed in
 clashes with West Pakistani troops. National Day,
 celebrated in East Pakistan as "Bangla Desh Re-
 sistance Day," was generally peaceful, but unsuc-
 cessful attempts were made in Dacca to firebomb
 two offices occupied by US firms.

 Turkey: The Long Road Back
 The threat of a military take-over hung
 heavily over Ankara for two critical weeks, but
 Turkey's constitutional system now appears to be
 gradually headed back toward normal. The basic
 terms of the military ultimatum have been met-
 Prime Minister Demirel has resigned and a non-
 partisan government, pledged to restore order and
 undertake a broad program of reforms, is about
 to be announced. Although Turkey's political life
 can never be quite the some as before this military
 "coup by communique," the new regime may,
 initially at least, be an improvement over its
 predecessor, which had been dogged by inter-
 minable delays, frustrations, and increasing ter-
 rorism.
 During the two weeks since the military
 leaders forced. Demirel to step down in favor of a
 nonpartisan  coalition   government,  President
 Sunay has held meetings with the leaders of all
 political parties, including the Marxist-oriented
 Turkish Labor Party. On 19 March he requested
 political  moderate, to
 head a new government.
 Nihat  Erim,  a  well-
 known  and                                              respected
 By training, experience,
 and temperament, he ap-
 pears to be a reasonably
 good choice for the as-
 sign ment.  Like                                            many
 Turks, however, Erim re-
 portedly sees Turkey as
 being in need of another
 Ataturk  or of  a  De
 Gaulle and believes that
 a clever and able politi-
 cian might be able to play that role. As yet he
 has refrained from casting himself in the part.
 Erim has received the necessary pledges of
 support from the major parties and has moved
 ahead with the formation of his government.
 Although it will consist mostly of political tech-
 nicians  from  outside Parliament,  it will also
 include several ministers from three of the four
 largest political parties. Some cabinet posts re-
 portedly will soon be abolished and their func-
 tions absorbed by others. Three new ministries
 may eventually be created, including one for
 foreign trade. Although no top party leaders will
 be  included  in  the  cabinet,  their continued
 support will be essential. The political situation
 will  remain  tense until the new government
 receives a vote of confidence, probably in about a
 week. The government's program must first be
 submitted to Parliament for debate. Meanwhile,
 the predominant Justice Party continues to press
 for national elections by October 1971.
 The purge of known and suspected plotters
 within the armed forces, including several general
 officers, has been accomplished with no serious
 disruption.  Purges  of  lower  echelons  may
 continue in low key for some time as the military
 tries to weed out dissidents and to justify its
 intervention.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Argentina: Military Junta Assumes Power
 The commanders of the three armed services
 assumed power in Argentina on 23 March follow-
 ing President Levingston's abortive attempt to
 remove army  commander  General  Alejandro
 Lanusse. The junta claims this represents no inter-
 ruption of the Revolutionary Government in-
 stalled by the military in 1966. Most Latin Ameri-
 can governments accept this interpretation and
 see no problems involving recognition.
 Levingston's power play came the evening of
 22 March following a meeting in which he appar-
 ently was taken to task by Lanusse for the firing
 of the chief of the joint general staff, Air Force
 General Martinez. General Lanusse was briefly
 held under house arrest but was released when
 word began reaching Buenos Aires that troop
 commanders 'throughout the nation rejected the
 President's action. The commanders of the navy
 and air force expressed their support for Lanusse
 and even the general narned to replace him re-
 jected Levingston's authority. There was a brief
 show of force by the presidential guard, but
 Levingston soon recognized that his gamble had
 failed and he submitted his resignation.
 The  final  rift  between  Levingston  and
 Lanusse apparently was sparked by the Cordoba
 riots of the previous week for which Levingston
 sought to blame General L.anusse. The President's
 removal, however, was the culmination of a slow
 deterioration in his position brought on by popu-
 lar unrest over economic problems and by the
 President's  increasing  proclivity  to  act  inde-
 pendently of the service commanders.
 The junta of commanders-in-chief opted to
 take direct control of the government this time
 rather than name a figurehead president as they
 did nine months ago when they selected General
 Levingston to replace President Ongania. General
 Lanusse, the strong man of the junta, is known to
 favor  an  accelerated  return to constitutional
 processes; moving the country toward elections
 undoubtedly will be one of the high priorities of
 the new government. This, of course, will be
 tempered by a desire to ensure that the Peronists
 cannot regain control of Argentina.
 The junta will be faced with the same do-
 mestic problems that contributed to Levingston's
 downfall including growing inflation, rising un-
 employment, and continuing labor unrest. The
 junta has probably bought some time on the labor
 front with its removal of the wage ceiling imposed
 by Levingston, but the large wage increases the
 unions will  now demand will complicate the
 over-all economic problems.
 General Lanusse appears to have broad sup-
 port within the armed forces at this time, but the
 military now will bear direct responsibility for
 governing and will view any failures as a blow at
 its institutional prestige. Thus, the junta is likely
 to experience considerable pressure from all sides
 and growing dissension within the armed forces in
 the  weeks  and  months  to  come-F---]     25X1

 Bolivia:  The New Cabinet
 President Torres' long-expected cabinet re-
 organization has not produced a notable shift in
 the group's political orientation and is not likely
 to lead to a significant change in the government's
 avowedly revolutionary policies. None of the
 seven new ministers is a significant political per-
 sonality. The appointments of a well-known
 Marxist and several leftists were balanced by the
 removal of several other leftists. The military rep-
 resentation was reduced from seven members to
 four. This move meets with the approval of the
 armed forces, which have been pressing for a
 reduction in the number of military officers in
 political positions.
 The most significant omission is that of lead-
 ing members of the moderate leftist Nationalist
 Revolutionary Movement (MNR), the country's
 largest political party. Their absence could indi-
 cate that Torres made a sincere but unsuccessful
 attempt to convince them of the benefits of co-
 government. It appears more likely, however, that
 Torres concluded that there were no significant
 political gains to be made by public cooperation
 with members of this broadly based but internally
 divided political force.
 Ousted Minister of State Jose Ortiz Mercado
 had participated in several meetings with MNR
 leaders over their possible participation in the
 government. His removal from the cabinet indi-
 cates that these negotiations did not meet with
 Torres' approval. In his resignation statement,
 Ortiz said that the government requires the par-
 ticipation of the most important political par-
 ties-a seeming reference to the MNR. If he
 chooses, Ortiz now is free to try to weld the
 divided MNR into a unified group that could
 attempt to seize power by force. The factions'
 history of internal disagreement, however, makes
 it unlikely that a successful coup could be
 mounted in the near future.
 Torres has also announced plans to establish
 a Political  Secretariat for  Revolutionary Co-
 ordination. Although its role was not specified,
 the President said the new group would co-
 ordinate the country's revolutionary forces in
 support of the revolutionary process. Such a gov-
 ernment-sponsored organization has been under
 discussion for several months. This new group is
 probably seen by Torres as a more pliable instru-
 ment than the labor/student dominated Popular
 Assembly, which was created by leftist groups in
 the aftermath of Torres' seizure of power in Oc-
 tober and which has only recently received his
 grudging approval.
 The probable infighting among leftist groups
 for domination of the new group may take some
 of the pressure off the government for the next
 few months. The formation of the new organiza-
 tion also will enable the government to select the
 political groups that are most amenable to govern-
 ment direction and to try to gain some measure
 of badly needed popular support.
 Colombians Propose Hemispheric Arms Control Measure
 Colombia has proposed that the Organi-
 zation of American States (OAS) consider a study
 of  "unnecessary  and  disproportionate" arma-
 ments in order to eliminate by common agree-
 ment superfluous military expenditures by mem-
 ber states. The suggestion avoids discussion of
 disarmament, but envisions a progressive cutback
 in military spending. The Colombians are sound-
 ing out hemispheric opinion, and if they can
 obtain the necessary two-thirds support, they will
 enter the proposal on the OAS agenda at the
 opening General Assembly session on 14 April.

 The Colombians may be successful in bring-
 ing the question before the OAS, as most Latin
 American states are unlikely to take a strong
 stand against the principle of arms control. Costa
 Rica and Chile have already indicated their whole-
 hearted support. Few, however, appear ready to
 move beyond general discussion and toward any

 as its sensitivity to any proposal that might in-

 Political Affairs
 Attempts by Chile's political  parties to
 strengthen their positions for the municipal elec-
 tions on 4 April are beginning to affect the gov-
 erning Popular Unity (UP) coalition in several
 potentially unsettling ways, but President Allende
 is not likely to be weakened by these develop-
 ments.
 The Christian Democratic Party (PDC) has
 belatedly challenged the Allende. government in
 Congress and, the press, seizing on issues such as
 the involvement of administration officials in a
 shady copper sales maneuver on the world
 market. These actions indicate that the PDC lead-
 ership may have realized at last that its accom-
 modating attitude has only helped to strengthen
 Allende and the UP's steady consolidation of
 power, and that by continuing to play the govern-
 ment's game the PDC could only damage its slim
 chances in the elections.
 Strains are also showing within the UP itself.
 Radical Party (PR) leaders suspect that their weak
 attempt by Bogota to freeze arms purchases. The
 Venezuelans believe that their neighbor, which
 recently signed a contract for Mirage aircraft, now
 has an edge, and they are therefore unlikely to
 support the measure. In indirect reply to the
 Colombian  initiative Venezuelan  President
 Caldera has reiterated the need to "renew armed
 forces equipment."  I n  Central America,
 moreover, mutual suspicion still persists as a
 result of the 1967 Salvadoran-Honduran war, and
 both countries remain interested in acquiring
 further armaments. Also, the Guatemalan foreign
 minister, because of his government's intention to
 increase the country's arsenal, has indicated he is
 opposed to the Colombian plan, although he
 professes to  support  arms  control  in
 theory.
 role in the coalition is threatened by hard-line
 Socialists (PS). For one thing, the latter are the
 source of charges that Mines Minister Cantuarias,
 a Radical, is involved in the copper scandal. All
 coalition candidates in the election must run on
 their own party tickets, and the PR is particularly
 eager to make a good showing. The Communist
 Party (PCCh), meanwhile, is determined to win
 the largest vote of any UP party, but is concerned
 that the PS might surpass it. PCCh leaders are
 irritated over the increasing and outspoken oppo-
 sition to the government, and it plans to counter-

 mass exhibitions of popular support for the

 their shares to the government mean that eight
 private banks, including one of Chile's largest, will
 soon be under state control. Thirteen remain in
 private Chilean hands. Two textile mills have been
 expropriated and a third soon will be. The govern-
 ment claims that production has increased in the
 seized plants as well as in the nitrate, coal, and
 other expropriated  industries; financial diffi-
 culties, however, persist in all of them.
 Administration efforts to blame copper pro-
 duction shortfalls on US management have been
 rebutted by PDC members. One has cited steeply
 rising absenteeism and lack of discipline amonq
 copper workers, a high turnover in supervisory
 personnel, and the use of informers, threats, and
 political pressures by UP labor leaders as the real
 causes. Increased sales of consumer goods in the
 first quarter of 1971 have not been reflected in
 industrial production, which has declined. On 20
 March Allende probably reflected government
 concern when he announced that "committees
 for the defense of production" would be set up.
 Strikes by bus drivers and bakery workers in
 Santiago were settled quickly this week by the
 government, probably because both had immedi-
 ate impact on the daily lives of most work-
 ers.
