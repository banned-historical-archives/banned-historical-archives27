NATO: Ministerial Aftermath in Review 
The Allies, during the traditional spring 
meetings of defense and foreign ministers, 
launched the most thorough examination of the 
Alliance since the 1967 "Harmel Exercise." The 
NATO members, through a study of Allied De-
fense Problems in the 1970s (AD-70), will 
attempt to determine how the Alliance should 
manage its defense in the coming decade. At the 
same time, they will weigh the prospects for de-
tente by assessing the reception in the East to 
their initiatives on European security and on 
mutual and balanced force reductions. 
The AD-70 study was given an official go-
ahead by the defense ministers last week in Brus-
sels, and the European members of NATO appar-
ently believe that the study may well imply an 
increase in their share of the defense burden. The 
European defense ministers seem convinced that 
their countries cannot stand by passively in the 
event the US reduces its presence in Europe. 
Despite their view that it would be impossible to 
increase their own defense budgets, they decided 
to examine how, through better allocation of 
expenditures, they could ease the cost to the US 
in order to forestall or limit possible US troop 
cutbacks. 
Apparently on the initiative of West German 
Defense Minister Schmidt, the group agreed to 
explore the possibility of taking over part or all of 
the US portion of NATO's infrastructure expendi-
tures. Schmidt reportedly told the others that the 
issue was one of "cash from our budgets." British 
Defense Minister Healey suggested that the Euro-
peans could be more helpful to the US by financ-
ing the local costs of US forces. Schmidt appar-
ently will be pressing the Europeans to come up 
with some concrete proposals by late September 
in the context of the AD-70 study for a more 
effective European defense commitment. 
The European defense ministers also dis-
cussed possible intra-European cooperative arma-
ment programs as a way of getting more for their 
money. Dutch Defense Minister den Toom argued 
that European political cohesion as well as mili-
tary and cost effectiveness required such coopera-
tion. The ministers made no firm decisions, but 
they reacted favorably to a number of potential 
programs�including exchanges of information on 
long-term weapons programs and cooperation in 
training. They also agreed that although there was 
no hope of winning the early return of France to 
NATO's integrated command structure, Paris 
could be brought closer to the Alliance through 
involvement in such cooperative ventures. 
A number of NATO members already are 
following up the agreement of their foreign min-
isters in Rome to multiply exploratory conversa-
tions with the East. The Rome communiqu�
stated that one of the main purposes of such 
contacts would be to determine when one or a 
series of conferences on European security and 
cooperation would be fruitful. The initial Soviet 
reaction to these initiatives has been predictably 
negative, although less shrill than usual. Nonethe-
less, there is already speculation that the major 
detente issue at the next meeting of the foreign 
ministers in December will be whether enough 
progress has been made on Germany, Berlin, and 
other specific issues to justify undertaking the 
more extensive multilateral contacts foreseen in  
the communidue.I

Vietnam 
Swinging into Summer 
The Communists' summer campaign is set to 
get under way in the near future, possibly this 
weekend. Captured documents and agent report-
ing strongly suggest that some sort of stepped-up 
action is scheduled to begin on or around 20 June 
in several sectors of South Vietnam, particularly 
in the northern provinces. 
The enemy's summer campaign will prob-
ably be similar to the relatively low-key spring 
campaign, which was marked by three brief up-
surges of enemy attacks in the opening days of 
April, May, and June. There are some indications, 
however, that this time enemy forces may try to 
sustain some of their shellings and limited sapper 
and guerrilla actions over a longer period of time 
for greater impact. It is also likely that the Com-
munists may try to hit hard at South Vietnamese 
forces in certain localized areas, especially in 
southern I Corps. 
Enemy forces in the two northernmost prov-
inces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien may also be 
getting set to take advantage of improving 
weather conditions in the coastal regions. North 
Vietnamese forces in the western reaches of these 
provinces presumably are fully equipped, rested, 
and ready for combat Combat-related activity, 
such as reconnaissance and movement of supplies, 
has picked up sharply in recent weeks, but these 
could be partly defensive measures prompted by 
growing enemy apprehensiveness over possible al-
lied incursions into Laotian border redoubts. 
Saigon Agitation on Upbeat Again 
The Thieu government is once again faced 
with increasing protest activity despite its efforts 
to appease the various groups involved. After sev-
eral weeks of relative quiet in Saigon, students 
have renewed their protests by staging some of 
the most violent antigovernment demonstrations  
experienced so far this year. \ 
(b)(3) 
(b)(1) 
 / The government had at-
tempted to defuse the situation through a series 
of conciliatory gestures including personal meet-
ings between Prime Minister Khiem and student 
and veteran leaders, but so far its efforts have not 
borne fruit. 
The new student demonstrations, which 
broke a temporary truce arranged by relatively 
moderate student leaders, suggest that militants 
have taken over leadership of the protests. The 
government had provisionally released some of 
the arrested student leaders whose imprisonment 
has been a primary issue in the protests. The 
militants, however, may regard government at-
tempts at conciliation as a sign of weakness and 
an opportunity to press for further concessions. 
The demonstrators, whose mood has become 
clearly anti-American and antiwar, are now pro-
testing on a wide range of issues, including the US 
presence in Vietnam and the government's alleged 
failure to move toward peace.

Altholinh rtivist elements  
would like to intensify their 
antigovernment campaigns, the situation appears 
fluid. The ability of these more militant leaders to 
carry out their plans will depend partly on how 
well they succeed in mobilizing their followers, 
including elements that have heretofore been 
more moderate, and partly on the effectiveness of  
government countermeasures. 
 / If they should join forces, however, the 
government would be faced with a much more 
serious situation. (SECRET NO FOREIGN

Laos: Portents of a Greater Communist Presence 
Laotian Army forces have so far been unsuc-
cessful in fulfilling Vientiane's pledge to retake 
Saravane. During the past week the Communists 
have turned aside repeated government probes in 
and around the town. On 16 June they spiked the 
first coordinated effort to recapture the pro-
vincial capital by seizing the base camp where 
government units were assembling. 
The Communists' apparent determination to 
hold on to Saravane�despite its relatively minor 
military significance�raises questions about the 
enemy's current goals in the Laotian panhandle. 
Beginning with the seizure of Attopeu on 30 
April, North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces 
have been unusually active in what has generally 
been accepted as a campaign to gain additional 
supply lines to Cambodia and South Vietnam. 
There is no question that full control of the road 
and river systems between Muong Phine and 
Attopeu will provide the Communists a useful 
alternative to the Ho Chi Minh trail system to the 
east. It is not certain, however, that the enemy's 
continuing high level of military activity has been 
based on logistic considerations alone. 
In gaining control of the supply corridor via 
Routes 23 and 16, the Communists did not need 
to attack either Attopeu or Saravane. These pro-
vincial capitals, which had been in government 
hands since the Geneva Accords were signed in 
1962, have for some time been bypassed by 
enemy truck traffic. Their seizure represents a 
clear break�calculated in Hanoi�with the long-
standing, rules of the game in southern Laos. It is 
possible that the North Vietnamese may have 
intended to indicate that they are no longer con-
strained by the Geneva Accords and that they feel 
free to pursue territorial ambitions in southern 
Laos that go beyond controlling a supply conduit 
to Cambodia and South Vietnam. 
the Cornmu-
nists have been making a determined effort since 
seizing the town to win over the population by 
improving economic conditions, maintaining basic 
government services, and taking a low military 
posture. An extensive political indoctrination 
program for Attopeu residents has included 
propaganda statements that the Communists in-
tend to take all of southern Laos in the next six 
months. 
Northern Laos Quiet 
(b)(1) 
(b)(3) 
In northern Laos, meanwhile, adverse 
weather conditions have brought military activity 
to a virtual standstill. With the advent of the rainy 
season, the civilian population of the Long Tieng 
area apparently has become convinced that the 
Communist threat has receded. As of mid-June, (b)(3) 
more than half of the inhabitants of the Long 
Tieng Valley had returned to their homes and 
resumed normal commercial activity.

Cambodia: After After Angkor, What? 
In Cambodia, the Lon Nol government's 
position in the countryside continues to deteri-
orate rapidly in the face of increasing Communist 
military operations. Since late March, for 
example, the Communists have attacked 15 out 
of 19 provincial capitals, and they still occupy 
lour of these key population centers in the north-
east (Stung Treng, Kratie, Lomphat, and Sen-
monorom). The government's position in the 
northeast has been reduced to two beleaguered 
outposts in Ratanakiri Province, and these are 
under continuing Communist harassment. 
There are indications that the Communists 
already are exploiting their de facto control over 
this zone to develop a huge new base area. 
West of the Mekong, the Vietnamese Com-
munists are making bold inroads in the northern 
provinces of Siem Reap, Kompong Thom, and 
Preah Vihear. The government apparently has 
stabilized the situation at Siem Reap, but an 
unknown number of Communist troops are re-
ported to be moving into the ruins at Angkor 
Wat, seat of the ancient Khmer empire. If the 
Communists succeed in maintaining a presence in 
this area, it will constitute an important propa-
ganda and psychological gain for them. 
In the eastern border province of Kompong 
Cham, enemy activity appears to be rising again. 
The province capital is defended by Khmer Krom 
forces�ethnic Cambodians who had been fighting 
under allied command in South Vietnam. 
In the border provinces to the south and 
southeast, the Communists continue to attack 
and harass government positions despite the fre-
quent proximity of South Vietnamese troops. 
Svay Rieng and Prey Veng cities are frequent 
targets of such harassment, and large concentra-
tions of Communist forces are being reported in 
Kandal Province. 
West of Phnom Penh, the Communists have 
attacked the capitals of Kompong Speu and Kom-
pong Chhnang provinces. The tenacity of their 
attack on Kompong Speu suggests that they place 
considerable emphasis on blocking Route 4, 
which runs through the city and serves as Phnom 
Penh's main overland access to the seaport of 
Kompong Som�formerly Sihanoukville. 
Enemy attacks in Kompong Chhnang prob-
ably also are directed primarily at key lines of 
communications. On June 14 the Communists cut 
Route 5, Phnom Penh's last remaining road link 
to the Thai border. The parallel rail line to Thai-
land was also blocked by a Communist attack on 
17 June. 
Vietnamese Communist objectives in Cam-
bodia still remain open to speculation. Hanoi 
clearly considers South Vietnam the main theater 
in Indochina, but the speed and scope of Commu-
nist military operations in Cambodia since early 
May suggest that Hanoi has decided attractive 
opportunities for major gains have presented 
themselves there. Although Hanoi obviously 
would like to topple the Lon Nol regime, it is also 
possible that�short of this�the spectacular at-
tacks west of the Mekong are designed to drama-
tize Phnom Penh's impotence, and to detract 
from the success of US and South Vietnamese 
operations against the border sanctuaries. 
Hanoi may conclude that the early restora-
tion of Sihanouk is sufficiently essential to justify 
all-out military operations in Cambodia, possibly 
including a direct attack on Phnom Penh itself.

  They might also consider 
the risks justified by the chance to undermine US 
policy in Southeast Asia, intensify the antiwar 
sentiment in the United States, and increase pres-
sures on Washington to negotiate on terms more 
acceptable to Hanoi. 
Whatever the case, it appears certain that at 
a minimum the Vietnamese Communists are 
determined to stay in Cambodia and to continue 
using Cambodian territory to support their war 
effort in South Vietnam. This is evident in the 
determined efforts they are making to keep the 
supply lines from North Vietnam open during the 
rainy season, to launch an effective Cambodian 
insurgent movement, and to keep the Cambodians 
at bay while they Proceed with surh activi-
ties.

Asian Group Consults on Cambodia 
The three-nation task force (Japan, Indo-
nesia, Malaysia) delegated by the mid-May Dja-
karta conference on Cambodia to seek support 
for reactivating the International Control Com-
mission and for convening a broadly based confer-
ence has conferred so far at the United Nations 
and in Moscow. 
Results to date have been meager. U Thant 
received the envoys sympathetically and promised 
to support their efforts when he visits Moscow in 
a few days. In Moscow, where the delegation 
talked with Gromyko on 17 June, reaction was�as 
expected�negative. Soviet officials continued to 
oppose the convening of a Geneva conference or 
any other kind of international gathering on the 
subject of Cambodia. 
From Moscow, the task force goes to New 
Delhi, where soundings indicate the atmosphere 
will be cool. It will then go to London and Paris, 
where the three envoys may try to contact Com-
munist China and North Vietnam through the 
French Government. Visits are also scheduled to 
Warsaw, Ottawa, Washington, and again to the 
UN. The task force expects to conclude its con-
sultations by 4 July.

Communist China: Where's Old Hsieh? 
Politburo member Hsieh Fu-Chih's three-
month sojourn in the shadows suggests that some 
unpublicized maneuvering has been under way 
within China's ruling hierarchy. Hsieh, who also 
serves as a vice premier and as boss of the Peking 
municipal government, had been among the most 
publicly active members of the Politburo until he 
suddenly slipped from view after a brief appear-
ance on 19 March. His absence was all the more 
remarkable when he failed to accompany the 
other top leaders who attended the major rallies 
and receptions held in Peking last month�
occasions when his presence would seem almost  
obligatory. 
 / There remains a measure of 
doubt, however, as Canton television recently 
showed an old film including shots of Hsieh, a 
highly irregular practice if he is in political dis-
grace. 
The suggestion that Hsieh's disappearance 
may be related to political maneuvering at the top 
is bolstered by an unexpected reversal in ranking 
between two other Poliburo members. Until he 
disappeared from view last March, Hsieh had al-
ways been sandwiched between Vice Premier Li 
Hsien-nien and Air Force Commander Wu Fa-
hsien on the relatively small number of occasions 
when China's top leaders have been publicly listed 
by rank over the past year. On five separate 
occasions in the past month, however, this peck-
ing order has been reversed and Wu has been 
listed ahead of Li. Wu's sudden apparent gain in 
political stature may be related to a change in 
that of Hsieh Fu-chih. Politburo listings, unless 
given in alphabetical order, are deliberately de-
signed to display relative power rankings. 
Plausible explanations as to why Hsieh Fu-
chih may have fallen into political hot water are 
still scarce, but the longer he is out of the lime-
light the more the Peking rumor mill rinds. 
Explicit signs of such leadership squabbles 
over the past few months have been only tenuous 
at best. One diplomat in Peking recently claimed, 
however, that the more radical elements in the 
Politburo are currently intriguing in order to gain 
increased representation for their followers in 
various government and party organs. Muted 
struggles of this nature have been almost a con-
stant in Chinese leadership politics since the 
Ninth Party Congress, and it is possible that, in 
the positional jockeying between political rivals 
on the Politburo, Hsieh has fallen back in the 
race.

If Hsieh has suffered more than a temporary

what would be the first major break in its ranks 
since the stormy 1968 purge of acting army chief

Communist China: Playing Its Cards Adroitly 
In the past several weeks Peking has been 
pushing hard to improve its position among 
independent-minded Communist states in an 
effort to gain important political leverage against 
the USSR. In particular, Peking has focused on a 
strongly militant anti-US posture in support of 
the Communists in Southeast Asia and has re-
asserted its firm backing for the sovereign rights 
of Soviet bloc states. In so doing, the Chinese 
believe they have been able to capitalize on Mos-
cow's cautious approach toward recent US 
actions in Indochina and to play on anti-Soviet 
feelings in Eastern Europe. 
The most striking example of this approach 
was the reception accorded a high-ranking 
Romanian Government delegation that visited 
Peking last week. Although the Romanians appar-
ently had planned only a short stopover in 
Peking, the Chinese offered an effusive welcome, 
including a reception with Mao and Lin Piao�an 
unusual accolade. Following this, Chou En-lai in a 
speech to the visitors pointedly underscored 
China's support for Bucharest's independent 
posture within the Soviet bloc and indirectly 
swiped at Moscow's disrespect for the political 
and economic rights of East European states. 
At the same time, the Chinese used the 
occasion of the Romanian visit further to enhance 
Peking's effort to build its influence among Asian 
Communist states at Soviet expense. In an obvi-
ous attempt to exacerbate Soviet - North Viet-
namese friction over Moscow's failure to break 
with the Lon Nol government in Cambodia, Polit-
buro member Kang Sheng in a speech on 9 June 
pointedly praised the Romanians for their quick 
recognition of the Sihanouk government-in-exile. 
In addition, Kang voiced strong support for North 
Korean charges that a US "spy ship" violated 
North Korean waters in early June�charges that 
Peking recognizes are false but which have been 
repeated to please Pyongyang. 
Complementing this approach, Peking since 
early May has generally avoided direct polemics 
against the USSR in order to soothe sensitivities 
regarding the Sino-Soviet dispute, particularly in 
Hanoi and Pyongyang. For example, Peking has 
not responded to a series of vituperative Russian 
attacks, including one on the extremely touchy 
issue of China's relations with Hong Kong. This 
discreet tack was dramatically underlined last 
week when Chou En-lai countered attacks from 
the three top Soviet leaders against alleged Chi-
nese "intransigence" toward the USSR by ex-
pressing Peking's "sympathy" over recent natural 
disasters in the USSR. 
This grandstand gesture clearly reflects 
China's judgment that its anti-US line is currently 
scoring important political points against Moscow 
and that it has no need to engage in unproductive 
polemical exchanges. Indeed, the recall of se-
lected Chinese chiefs of missions to Peking over 
the past week almost certainly was designed to 
bring Peking's diplomats up to date on its present 
line of march. There is no sign that the Chinese 
are about to alter their strategy; on the contrary, 
they seem confident that they have a number of 
high cards and are apparently quite willing to play 
out their present hand.

Philippines: Student Unrest Brewing 
President Marcos' inept handling of student 
unrest portends a resurgence and an intensifica-
tion of the protest movement with the opening of 
the new school year. His most recent action�the 
jailing of the head of the militant Kabataang 
Makabayan (KM-Nationalist Youth) on the charge 
of subversion�is certain to infuriate the KM's 
members, who were in the forefront of the vio-
lent student demonstrations early this year. The 
KM, along with other student organizations, has 
been conducting teach-ins in the provinces in an 
effort to win broader support from the public, 
which had been alienated by the KM's frequent 
resort to violence. 
The arrest will probably more than outweigh 
Marcos' effort to meet student objections to a 
sharp rise in the over-all cost of education, espe-
cially at private schools. Marcos has delayed the 
opening of the school year for nearly a month�
until the end of July�and has ordered a halt to 
price increases on textbooks and supplies. He also 
is trying to persuade private schools to rescind

USSR: Out of Step on Indochina 
Moscow's decision not to recognize Siha-
nouk and to retain its presence in Phnom Penh 
has been accompanied by a number of less signifi-
cant moves that indicate continuing differences 
with Hanoi over current tactics in Indochina. The 
decision, which marks the first time in years that 
the two countries have been openly out of step 
on a major policy issue was taken principally 
because of Sihanouk's sponsorship by Peking. 
Subsequent Soviet moves indicate that Sino-So-
viet considerations will continue to dominate 
Moscow's thinking on Indochina and that ma-
terial support for North Vietnam will continue. 
At the same time that North Vietnam and 
China have been denouncing all efforts to achieve 
a negotiated solution in Indochina, the Soviets 
have let it be known that they think this is the 
� 
increases in school fees. Marcos probably hoped 
that he could soften student hostility toward him 
and give himself time to prepare for the antici-
pated renewal of the protest movement. 
Another reaction to the arrest has come 
from Congress, where questions have been put as 
to whether a violation of civil liberties has oc-
curred. The arrest may also heighten popular dis-
gust over Marcos' increasing attraction to dicta-
torial methods. A furor was created last month by 
the high- handed deportation to Taiwan of two 
Manila-born Chinese newspaper editors on flimsy 
charges of subversion. 
Even though the student movement remains 
sharply divided into moderate and radical wings, 
students will view the detention of the radical 
leader as reflecting Marcos' lack of sympathy for 
all students and will sharpen their focus on him as 
the source of all Philippine Ms.(

Soviet material support for the North Viet-
namese. The Soviet-DRV aid agreement signed in 
Moscow early this week served to underscore 
Moscow's long-standing commitment to the DRV 
and at the same time balanced a similar agreement 
concluded in late May between Hanoi and Peking. 
  There is little question, 
however, that Moscow would agree to an in-
USSR-Romania: Victory for Whom? 
creased aid program if it believed the situation 
required it. 
For the present, Moscow has clearly decided 
upon a course of action that involves providing 
Hanoi with substantial�but not unlimited�
political, economic, and military support while 
gambling that, under the pressure of arduous 
fighting and the prospects of increased depend-
ence on Peking, Hanoi will again see the advan-
tages of negotiating, and the Soviets will have an 
opportunity to restore their influence. The 
USSR's tactics will continue to be designed to  
minimize Peking's gains. 
� � � 
Moscow and Bucharest announced on 12 
June that Soviet party leader Brezhnev will visit 
Romania early in July to sign a long-delayed 
treaty of friendship and mutual assistance. Agree-
ment for this trip was probably reached during 
Romanian party boss Ceausescu's trip to Moscow 
In mid-May. 
The Romanians have implied that the treaty 
is the one drafted and initialed in 1968, when the 
old 20-year treaty expired. If so, it will not in-
clude the opprobrious language of the recently 
signed Soviet-Czechoslovak treaty, which incor-
porated the essence of the so-called Brezhnev 
doctrine of limited sovereignty and implicitly 
broadened mutual defense commitments beyond 
Europe. 
Obtaining signature of the treaty on Ro-
manian terms will be a victory of sorts for Buch-
arest, but it may have been gained at the expense 
of concessions in other areas. Romania, for ex-
ample, may have agreed to closer economic and 
military cooperation with Moscow. According to 
various reports, the USSR is continuing to put 
pressure on Bucharest to participate in Warsaw 
Pact maneuvers, but the issue of maneuvers on 
Romanian soil in 1970 apparently is still unset-
tled. At any rate, the two sides apparently are 
playing down their differences for the moment. 
Nevertheless, the Romanians are taking steps 
to bolster their policy of independence. Earlier 
this month a high-level party and government 
delegation to North Korea and Communist China 
was feted in Peking with great ceremony. More-
over, Ceausescu's trip to France this week and 
Premier Maurer's scheduled visit to West Germany 
later this month are being touted as evidence of 
Romania's wide-ranging friendships, with the im-
plicit hint that these governments might be 
counted on for political support vis-a-vis the 
USSR.

Yugoslavia Seeks Seeks US Private Investment 
In an effort to expand trade with the US and to 
attract more American investment, a Yugoslav 
delegation is currently negotiating the establish-
ment of a joint corporation with US industrialists 
and financiers. Yugoslav Government agencies 
and some 90 firms reportedly responsible for one 
fifth of Yugoslavia's total trade will participate. 
The organization is to be the exclusive agent 
for sales and purchases in 1:he US by participating 
members. It also will secure advanced technology, 
provide funds for plant expansion in Yugoslavia, 
and arrange for the joint exploitation of ventures 
in third countries. Belgrade believes that, with 
Yugoslavia's "prestige in the third world" and US 
financial resources, third-country ventures could 
be particularly profitable. President Tito stressed 
such possibilities in recent talks with President 
Kearns of the US Export-Import Bank in which 
he sought more US investment. The Yugoslays 
rolled out the red carpet for Kearns, who re-
ported that talks with the Yugoslav premier, 
cabinet officers, and leading businessmen had laid

Yugoslavia, up to its ears in debt payments, 
may hope that a large expansion in direct private

to benefit greatly from more efficient manage-

western stake in the success of Yugoslav enter-

Yugoslav goods in international markets. 
Belgrade recently has instituted legislation 
protecting western ownership rights and profit

but more than a dozen Western companies are

USSR: Leaders' Speeches Wind up Election Campaign 
The elections to the Supreme Soviet on 14 
June climaxed over two weeks of "campaign" 
speech making by Soviet leaders. Their review of 
the past and future offered nothing dramatic but 
presented quite an orderly picture of collective 
leadership. 
The final week was devoted to addresses by 
the four senior leaders: Suslov, Kosygin, Pod-
gorny, and Brezhnev. Earlier speeches were not 
delivered in strict order of precedence, and party 
secretary Ustinov was unable to meet his con-
stituents because of illness. The occasion of Brezh-
nev's speech at the Kremlin Palace of Con-
gresses on 12 June was attended by the other 
leaders and carried in full by the major news-
papers. 
The leadership recounted the economic suc-
cesses achieved under the present five-year plan 
but noted the need for increased labor produc-
tivity, speedier construction, and greater "scien-
tific-technical progress." Vague allusions to the 
forthcoming plan (1971-75) indicate that major 
guidelines are still being hammered out. Brezhnev 
hinted, however, that 1he main beneficiary would 
be heavy industry, at the expense of the con-
sumer. Brezhnev, President Podgorny, and Polit-
buro member Polyansky all promised that the 
agricultural sector would receive "increased capi-
tal investments" during 1971-75. 
Premier Kosygin's address included the most 
comprehensive treatment of the economy as well 
as the most spirited defense of the reform. He 
said a reorganization of administration is under

Italy: Center-Left Optimistic 
In the wake of the regional, provincial, and 
municipal elections of 7-8 June, center-left politi-
cal leaders are showing increased optimism. The 
prospect that parliament will be dissolved and 
national elections held earlier than 1973 now 
seems remote, although party differences or per-
and to improve specialization in industry. He 
called for more discipline but did not lean as 
heavily on this theme as did Brezhnev. 
As he did at his press conference on 4 May, 
Kosygin discounted Western press speculation 
that an "internal struggle" was under way in the 
USSR. Brezhnev noted that foreigners had seized 
upon the exercise of criticism and self-criticism to 
allege that an economic crisis exists in the USSR. 
These references to Western commentary may be 
the outgrowth of debate on such issues among the 
leaders and their concern over the interpretation 
given Soviet political and economic decisions 
abroad. 
The leaders addressed foreign affairs in 
broad and generally moderate terms. Kosygin and 
Podgorny spoke in more rigid and stereotyped 
terms while Brezhnev allowed himself more flexi-
bility. All three offered strong backing for the 
Arab cause in the Middle East and criticized US 
policies in Indochina. They were milder, however, 
in treating US-Soviet relations and West Germany. 
Brezhnev's speech contained one minor in-
novation in Moscow's European policy. In what 
may be intended as a counter to the NATO pro-
posals made at the Rome ministerial in May for 
talks with the bloc on European security matters 
and on mutual force reductions, he suggested the 
creation of "some sort of permanently operating 
mechanism" to carry out agreed measures aimed 
at European detente. He did not flesh out this 
idea and made no specific reference either to the 
Rome 7 ronosals or to a mite similar Rritish nro-
posal.

misplaced optimism inspired by apparent Com-

believes the Communists will start now, probably 
with increased Soviet financial support, to pre-

encourage increased labor violence this summer to 
arrest Italy's steady economic progress. Rumor

Jordan Still Verges on Disaster 
King Husayn's capitulation to fedayeen de-
mands has partially defused the situation, but it 
could be reignited by the activities of extremists 
on either side. 
After a succession of abortive cease-fires had 
failed to put an end to last week's heavy fighting, 
King Husayn bowed to fedayeen insistence that 
he dismiss the commander in chief of his army 
and the head of his third armored division�both 
particularly detested by the fedayeen. The deci-
sive factor appears to have been the seizure of 
two Amman hotels by the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which dissociated 
itself from the earlier attempts at cease-fires 
arranged by the King and Fatah's Yasir Arafat 
and held out for the dismissal of the two com-
manders. 
According to Iraqi press reports, the cease-
fire agreement contains five points: the with-
drawal of Jordanian Army forces to their previous 
positions; the return of all fedayeen to their 
former positions; the immediate formation of a 
commission to investigate the causes of the crisis; 
the dismissal of the two army leaders; and the 
formation of a committee to oversee implementa-
tion of the agreement. The composition of the 
two committees, which included representatives 
from both sides, was promptly announced. Sub-
sequent incidents appear to have been minor, 
with joint army-fedayeen patrols successfully 
keeping the lid on in Amman. 
One of the results of the crisis so far has 
been an upsurge in the prestige of the PFLP and 
its leader, George Habbash. Arafat has already 
taken some steps to respond to Habbash's chal-
lenge: in a press conference on 14 June, he retro-
actively approved of the PFLP's seizure of foreign 
hostages, thus taking partial credit for the action 
generally thought to have turned the tide in favor 
of the fedayeen. 
� 
Meanwhile, bitterness is said to be wide-
spread among army units over the firing of its two 
leaders. 
  the danger remains that at least some of the 
military, unable to swallow the King's capitula-
tion and refusal to crack down on the fedayeen, 
could reach the point of actual mutiny. This pos-
sibility will be increased if Husayn is forced to 
make further concessions. 
At the same time, there are indications that 
the fedayeen may be stepping up their demands. 
An unidentified Fatah leader, writing in the 
group's newspaper, which has begun publishing in 
Amman since the cease-fire, called for the trial of 
those responsible for the outbreak�presumably 
the two army leaders�and for the dissolution of 
Jordan's internal security apparatus "and other 
suspicious groups." A spokesman for one of the 
more extreme fedayeen groups has issued similar 
demands. Should the fedayeen stiffen their terms 
in the negotiations now taking place in Amman, 
Husayn's dilemma will grow still more acute. If he 
backs down yet again before the fedayeen, he 
could face serious disaffection within the ranks of 
his army. A refusal to concede, however, could 
result in renewed fighting with unpredictable con-
sequences.

Middle East 
Israel:and the Fedayeen 
The Israelis last week cast a wary eye over 
developments in Jordan, watching the renewed 
struggle between King Husayn and the fedayeen. 
They fear the emergence of a more radical Jordan 
through a take-over by fedayeen or by more 
direct involvement of Syrian and Iraqi military 
personnel ,or even of the Soviets. Government 
leaders in Tel Aviv have issued warnings that 
Israel could not sit idly by and permit a change 
"in the balance" in Jordan. 
Although Husayn is still on the throne and 
Damascus and Baghdad did not get militarily in-
volved, Tel Aviv almost certainly estimates that 
the fedayeen have increased their power and that 
most of the curbs Husayn was able to impose on 
the feda een now have Drobablv disaoneared. 
Israel and Egypt 
Tel Aviv's main concerns at the moment, 
however, are forthcoming decisions in Washington 
regarding future supplies of aircraft and develo - 
ments on the EclvDtia 
Tel Aviv con-
tinued to avoid any deep penetration raids, and 
Soviet pilots kept out of the Suez Canal area. 
Egyptian aircraft, however, went into action 
briefly on Tuesday for the first time in some two 
weeks, attacking Israeli military positions in the 
northern sector of the canal. 
Israel and Syria 
An Israeli commando force on 16 June 
struck deep into Syria, mortaring a military camp 
some 40 miles northeast of Damascus and striking 
a bridge about 30 miles south of the Syrian 
capital. A spokesman in Tel Aviv said the raid was 
in retaliation for Syrian and Arab guerrilla attacks 
over the past month against Israeli troops and 
settlements in the occupied Golan Heights area. 
Lebanon 
An anticipated clash between government 
forces and the fedayeen failed to materialize this 
past week. In late May the government an-
nounced that after 15 June it would no longer 
allow the fedayeen to fire into Israeli territory 
from southern Lebanon or to carry arms within 
Lebanese cities and villages. It had been feared

that fighting might erupt if the government at-

senting most of the moderate and conservative 
blocs within the ruling Destourian Socialist Party. 
The 16-man government will probably serve in a 
caretaker capacity until the party congress is held 
this fall, at which time more extensive changes 
may be announced. Meanwhile, a special com-
mittee appointed by President Bourguiba to plan 
the party congress is also charged with drafting 
important revisions to the country's constitution. 
The deliberations of the new government 
and of the special committee�which Ladgham 
will chair�are likely to be marked by friction. Six 
of the eight members of the committee are also 
the strongest and most influential members of the 
government. Two of the six are political rivals of 
the prime minister and have long had close per-
sonal ties to Bourguiba. At least one of these men 
sparked the President's public rebuke to Ladgham 
last March, an incident that aroused speculation 
that the prime minister was about to be replaced. 
The committee's proposals for constitutional 
revisions will concentrate mainly on the problem 
of succession. President Bourguiba, who recently 
returned from a lengthy convalescence in France, 
is again preoccupied with ensuring an orderly 
succession to the presidency. One proposal he has 
already proffered to the committee would make 
the government responsible to the national 
assembly as well as to the president. This would 
establish a better balance between the currently 
powerful presidency and the essentially advisory 
assembly. The committee's recommendations will 
be submitted to the party congress for approval. 
The committee's other role�preparation for 
the party congress�may be the more time con-
suming. Local party units have already elected 
their representatives to the congress, but the na-
tional committee will probably want to ensure 
that these representatives have been properly 
"instructed" before the congress con-
venes.

Are Nue 
India and Mrs. Gandhi 
Recent meetings of high-level committees of 
the ruling Congress Party further indicate that 
Mrs. Gandhi plans to base her political strategy on 
attacking the right, while avoiding issues that 
could endanger her support among leftist opposi-
tion parties. Although there are a number of 
problems involved, such an approach has been 
one of the reasons her minority government has 
survived since the Congress Party split last 
November. 
The main issues discussed at the meetings, 
which ended last weekend, were communalism, 
regionalism, and extremism, all of which were 
used primarily as vehicles to attack the right. The 
most popular target was the Hindu nationalist 
Jana Sangh Party, which Congress has tried to 
blame for recent communal riots. 
In attacking the right, Mrs. Gandhi is prob-
ably trying to set up a favorable framework for 
any future elections, and she may even hope that 
in such an atmosphere some of the right-wing 
parties will not risk going to the polls. In the 
budget session of Parliament this spring, an im-
portant factor in her government's survival was 
the reluctance of any opposition party to risk 
bringing down the government and forcing early 
elections. 
Mrs. Gandhi has relied on votes from the 
left�including moderate Communists�for her 
programs, and in the Congress Party meetings 
only the most extreme Communist faction came 
in for criticism. Moreover, the party's leadership 
gave in easily to demands that the foreign-policy 
resolution call specifically for the withdrawal of 
American troops from Vietnam as the first step 
leading to evacuation of all foreign troops from 
that country. 
The party gatherings revealed no substantial 
opposition to Mrs. Gandhi, and no dissension 
among party leaders. This might have been due, 
however, to the careful avoidance of a number of 
issues�such as the ending of subsidies to India's 
former princes and the question of nuclear weap-
ons�that could be divisive for the party. Mrs. 
Gandhi promised to speed up economic progress, 
but made no specific proposals, thus avoiding 
controversy. 
Despite the difficulties of maintaining a 
minority government, a multitude of issues that 
could divide her supporters both within and 
outside the party, and the threat to her from 
other potential party leaders, Mrs. Gandhi has not 
only survived for over seven months, but her 
position  appears stronger than it was last No-
vember.

Diplonapings Continue in Latin America 
The kidnaping in Brazil last week of West 
German Ambassador von Holleben, coming 
shortly after the abduction and murder of Argen-
tina's former president Aramburu, has raised once 
again the specter of further "diplonapings" in 
Latin America. The fact that the Brazilian opera-
tion occurred despite increased security precau-
tions and a roundup of subversives heightens the 
anxiety being felt in Latin American capitals. 
Even as normally tranquil a place as Costa 
Rica has not been spared. High-ranking govern-
ment officials there, including the second vice 
president, have been threatened. The government 
is considering sending an imprisoned, pro-Castro 
Nicaraguan guerrilla leader to another country so 
terrorists will no longer have a motive for action. 
In addition to "diplonaping," the hoary tac-
tic of kidnaping to obtain ransom money is con-
tinuing. Such instances have occurred recently in 
Colombia, Guatemala, and the Dominican Re-
public. In Uruguay a pro-Castro group raided the 
Swiss Embassy, locked up the ambassador and his 
staff, and stole mimeographing equipment.

Argentina: General Levingston, I Presume? 
Brigadier General Roberto Marcelo Leving-
ston, a 50-year-old ,officer who has been Argen-
tine military attache to Washington since January 
1969, was installed as president on 18 June by 
the military junta. 
In plucking Levingston out of obscurity and 
thrusting him into the presidential palace, the 
junta members have made it clear that they, not 
Levingston, will make all the major decisions in 
the new administration. 
New Argentine President 
He is reported to be close to the 
junta strong man, Army Commander General 
Alejandro Lanusse, and is regarded as a political 
liberal and strongly anti-Peronist. 
 apparently ha no part in 
events leading to the move against Ongania on 8 
June.

economic views, and he is relatively unknown to

the Argentine people. This lack of political iden-
tification with any particular group probably was 
a major factor in his selection. 
Perhaps in an effort to counter the widely 
held view that Levingston will be no more than a 
front for Lanusse and other junta members, Ar-
gentine officials are emphasizing the strong will 
and stubbornness of the new president. He is said 
to be pro-US but has criticized this country for 
not helping Argentina more at a time when "Chile 
is going red and Brazil is going black." He report-
edly favors a reunification of the Argentine labor 
movement and winning over the Peronist-
dominated workers through positive reforms. He 
is said to support the economic policies of former 
economy minister Krieger Vasena, the author of 
the Ongania government's stabilization and devel-
opment program. 
Not surprisingly, Levingston is said to favor 
General Lanusse's plan for a phased return to 
democratic, representative government. Junta 
members have generally committed themselves to 
restoring some of the democratic processes sus-
pended since the June 1966 coup. Their com-
mitment is general enough, however, to permit 
modification at any time. 
Levingston now is conferring with junta 
members to fill government posts. Six of the 
seven cabinet members have already been named. 
The key economy and labor post went to Carlos 
Moyano Llerena, an adviser to a former minister, 
Krieger Vasena. The defense minister in Ongania's 
government, Jose Caceres Monie, retains his port-
folio, and- Eduardo McLoughlin, former ambas-
sador to Britain, becomes interior minister. The 
Foreign Ministry post went to Luis Maria de 
Pablo Pardo, a professor of international law and 
former ambassador to Chile. The junta also an-
nounced the selection of a newspaperman, David 
Kaplan, as interim information secretary. Kaplan 
is the first Jew to hold a major position in the 
government. He is a highly respected journalist 
and a close friend of Lanusse's, and his appoint-
ment may prove permanent. 
While the new administration is settling in, 
there is already some speculation as to how long 
Levingston will remain in the obviously secondary 
role which the junta has assigned to him. The 
1966 Statute of Revolution�the basic law of the 
land�is now being amended to make the military 
junta a co-governing partner with the new chief 
executive. His tenure will obviously depend on 
the extent to which his personality will conform 
to or conflict with the views of the junta and 
especially with those of General Lanusse.1

CUBA-PERU: Castro is still going to great lengths 
to publicize Cuba's role in Peruvian earthquake 
relief and to promote international aid commit-
ments. On 14 June he sent Cuban minister Carlos 
Rafael Rodriguez to Geneva to solicit reconstruc-
tion funds from the UN Development Program. 
Rodriguez also plans to attend the 22 June ses-
sion of the Economic Commission for Latin 
America in New York, where he will probably 
submit the same proposal. The Cuban airlift to 
Peru has brought at least 18 planeloads of aid to 
Lima, and more flights are expected. In addition,

Peru-US: Earthquake Disaster 
The warm official Peruvian response to US 
assistance in the earthquake disaster area has 
quieted anti-US feeling among some groups in the 
country, at least in the short run. The quake, the 
most disastrous recorded in the Western Hemi-
sphere in recent times, affected nearly 800,000 
Peruvians, including dead, injured, and homeless. 
Latest government estimates place the number of 
dead at more than 50,000. 
President Velasco and other high-ranking 
government officials have expressed their appreci-
ation and gratitude for the help provided by the 
US, stating that without it Peru "would not have 
made it" through the first tragic days or have as 
much hope for the future. The normally critical 
Lima daily, El Comercio, praised US relief efforts, 
singling out President INlixon's "Declaration of 
Solidarity," grant aid totaling $10 million, heli-
copter assistance, and the arrival of high-ranking 
US officials to supervise relief efforts in the quake 
area. El Comercio's laudatory comments were 
particularly significant not only because they 
were Peru's first and most complete recognition 
of US relief efforts but also because they came 
from a newspaper that is usually highly national-
istic and generally suspiciious of or hostile to US 
interests in Peru. 
The US response to the disaster has generally 
dissipated the atmosphere of suspicion and re-
crimination generated by the Peruvian regime's 
disputes with US companies. The disaster also has 
brought Peruvians together and at least tempo-
rarily quieted much of the criticism directed at 
the government from both right and left. 
The quake could swell the flow of rural 
people to urban areas, particularly to Lima. The 
influx will add to the problem of inadequate 
housing and facilities, fueling the present dis-
content in the country's urban slums. 
The earthquake's immediate impact on the 
economy is not likely to be serious. The most 
severely devastated area, the Callejon de Huaylas, 
was not an important producer of minerals or 
export crops. Although the coastal area around 
Chimbota was also severely damaged, the area's 
most important industries�steel, sugar, and fish-
meal production�should not suffer major set-
backs. Initial reports indicate that the damage to 
the steel mill�Peru's only steel facility�although 
extensive, should interrupt production for only 
six to nine months. The fishing season is closed, 
and the loss in output of the fishmeal industry 
thus should be minimal. 
Initial reports indicate that damage to irriga-
tion canals, reservoirs, and hydroelectric facilities 
could depress output. Moreover, land trans-
portation routes in the region should be repaired 
at least temporarily in the near future. The great 
bulk of the losses suffered were to housing, 
schools, and public buildings. 
Expenditures for relief and rehabilitation 
could be beneficial to the economy. Peru has 
been suffering from an inadequate rate of eco-
nomic growth and widespread unemployment, 
largely because its economic reform and stabiliza-
tion programs have discouraged both public and 
private investment. The expected large increase in 
public expenditures should stimulate the de-
pressed construction industry and lead to a re-
surgence of economic growth. 
Because the disaster relief efforts have im-
proved US-Peruvian relations, they may also have 
been instrumental in bringing about better rela-
tions between the regime and foreign investors 
such as Cerro and I PC, which have been conspicu-
ous for their contributions to relief efforts. A 
better investment climate could also spur eco-
nomic growth.

A RURAL FERTILIZER FACTORY AND ITS PRODUCT ON WAY TO CONSUMERS 
CHINA STAYS EVEN IN FOOD/POPULATION RACE 
China enters the 1970s with its food problems more or less under control. Current food supplies 
appear adequate, whether measured by annual production of grain or size of the average diet. Peking 
sees availability exceeding current needs to such an extent that it has launched a national campaign to 
increase grain stocks for the first time in many years. 
In 1960, the collapse of the Great Leap i=orvvard was accompanied by a drastic fall in grain 
production. Peking was forced to abandon its rather utopian programs for restructuring rural institu-
tions to tackle the fundamental problem of feeding the population. Aside from concern for human 
misery, there was the overriding consideration that mass starvation could undermine the viability of rhe 
Communist regime. By importing grain and by reversing collectivization policies that had sapped 
incentive and public morale, the government arrested the decline in food supplies. During the last half 
of the 1960s, food production was nursed back to pre - Leap Forward levels by the regime's increased 
allocation of resources to agriculture. 
The food problem has not been solved, however, and China apparently still is far from achieving a 
breakthrough similar to the "green revolution" that has occurred elsewhere in Asia. Food supplies 
exceed the needs of the population by so slight a margin that bad weather alone could start a new 
downward trend. Moreover, the possibility that Mao Tse-tung may again attempt to introduce radical 
changes in the countrystle that could lead to agricUltural problems similar to those of the early 1960s 
continues to loom as a threat to China's modest agricultural achievements.

(b)(3) 
Agricultural Crisis 
Agricultural output fell drastically during 
1959-61, confronting the regime with one of its 
most serious economic crises. The crisis, although 
precipitated by almost catastrophic weather con-
ditions, was also the outgrowth of the regime's 
earlier policies toward agriculture. During the 
1950s the regime had looked to collectivization 
and to the exploitation of existing resources in 
the countryside for rapid agricultural growth 
rather than to infusions of scarce capital and 
technology. Such efforts, moreover, were either 
"once and for all" types of improvements or were 
subject to increasingly severe diminishing returns. 
Agricultural output did increase in the 1950s, but 
the surpluses that could be converted to capital 
for investment became smaller and smaller as the 
population continued to grow. Three consecutive 
years of poor weather in 1959-61 forced food 
production far below the minimum levels re-
quired to sustain the population. 
Change in Agricultural Policies 
In September 1962 the "agriculture first" 
policy was adopted, which provided a somewhat 
larger share of state investment as well as greater 
industrial support for agriculture. By 1964 chemi-
cal fertilizers, mechanical water pumps, and farm 
tools and equipment had become available in suf-
ficient quantities to make an impact on agricul-
tural production. These inputs were allocated 
primarily to commercial grains (rice and wheat), 
corn, and cotton, andwere concentrated in areas 
capable of returning high yields despite flood or 
drought. Such areas constitute only a minor share 
of China's farmland; the bulk of the country's 
farming areas were left more or less to fend for 
themselves. Nevertheless, changes in management 
practices were made�notably in regard to crop 
rotations and the substitution of grains for indus-
trial crops�that affected most of China's culti-
vated areas. Corn, for example, has been popu-
larized for cultivation in areas with marginal 
water supplies, chiefly because corn is more re-
sponsive to fertilizer than is wheat or rice. In large 
Special Report 
- 2 - 
areas of north China, a single crop of spring-sown 
corn, heavily fertilized, has been substituted for 
the traditional rotation of winter wheat followed 
by a summer-sown grain crop. Under favorable 
conditions, the single crop of corn has yielded 
more than have wheat and a summer-sown crop 
combined, thus increasing grain available in these 
areas. 
Grain and Fertilizer Imports 
Among the policies adopted during the 
1960s to cope with food exigencies was the im-
port of food and chemical fertilizers. Of the two, 
the import of grain has attracted more attention 
from the West, which considers this trade the 
bellwether of the Chinese food situation. When 
China in the 1960-61 food year broke precedent 
and began importing grain from Canada and Aus-
tralia, the need was clearly desperate. 
Net imports reached 5.5 million tons in 
1961 and since then have averaged a little over 
five million tons annually despite improvements 
in cereal grain harvests. They have become an 
important element in stabilizing levels of cereal 
consumption in the urban areas of East and North 
China and in maintaining adequate levels of Chi-
nese grain stocks. These imports are also useful in 
reducing the volume of internal transport needed 
to distribute food to cities. 
Chinese imports of chemical fertilizer, which 
increased only gradually during 1961-64, began to 
expand rapidly in 1965. By 1969 these imports, 
combined with the slowly expanding domestic 
fertilizer industry, had more than doubled the 
total amount of fertilizer available in Communist 
China, and have been the key factor in agricul-
tural performance. Nevertheless, the regime still 
has not allocated sizable resources to the develop-
ment of the chemical fertilizer industry, and im-
ports continue to provide the bulk of available 
fertilizer. In 1969, for example, they constituted 
more than 60 percent of the total fertilizer avail-
able. Given the lagging development of the do-
mestic fertilizer industry, China is likely to

Noel gre-R-E-T.  
remain dependent upon imported fertilizer for 
some time to come. 
The Food Situation 
On a purely bulk basis, the Chinese are not 
eating as well as they did in 1957 or 1958. Never-
theless, food supplies have clearly been adequate 
for the past several years. A representative ration 
before the Leap Forward was between 2,200 and 
2,300 calories a day. Rations fell to a low of 
about 1,400 calories during the disaster years of 
1960 and 1961, but by 3.965 they had recovered 
to a level of about 2,000 calories. This level has 
since been maintained. 
Although some Western nutritionists con-
sider 2,000 calories a day short of minimum re-
quirements for an adequate diet, the Chinese ap-
pear to be living reasonably well at this level. 
In terms of the amount of cereal grains in 
the individual rations, there is still a gap of about 
20 percent as compared with the 1957s. This gap, 
however, has been norrowed on a caloric basis by 
the inclusion of larger quantities of potatoes in 
the ration and on a quality basis by an increase in 
the availability of fruits, vegetables, eggs, and 
meats. Relatively small increases in eggs and 
meats significantly offset the nutritional defi-
ciencies inherent in an overwhelmingly grain diet. 
An important share of the potatoes and most of 
the fruits, vegetables, eggs, and meats  are pro-
duced on the peasants' private plots./ 
 ]since 1967, some 20 to 25 
percent of the peasant's consumption, by weight, 
has originated from these plots. 
The government has openly acknowledged 
that it cannot reform rural institutions radically 
Special Report 
until a satisfactory substitute for private plots is 
found. The provincial press has categorically 
stated that the plots will continue to play a role 
in the foreseeable future. The national press in-
directly endorses this line by banning articles con-
demning the plots. The five-percent limit placed 
on the arable land devoted to these plots con-
strains their growth, however, and there has been 
a leveling off of production on private plots over 
the past two years. 
Impact of New Policies 
Stabilization policies since 1962, together 
with restoration of the private plot, have eased 
the food situation. The infusion of large quanti-
ties of items such as chemical fertilizer and im-
proved tools has enabled the Chinese to increase 
grain output at a much higher rate than could be 
achieved with traditional inputs alone. Finally, 
the Chinese have been favored by six years of 
normal or above-average weather conditions. This 
has meant that the average grain harvest level in 
China has increased from the 180 million metric 
ton level of 1957 to as much as 205-210 million 
tons in 1967. Grain production since 1967 has 
probably been somewhat lower. Production 
dropped in 1968 as the result of interruptions 
caused by the Cultural Revolution to the flow of 
industrial goods in support of agriculture. Produc-
tion in 1969 suffered from a deterioration in 
weather conditions that was only partially offset 
by increased supplies of chemical fertilizers and 
other inputs. 
Peking seems only mildly aware that the 
present breather in the food population race must 
be used to make fast progress in food-raising 
technology. Thus, the regime still appears unwill-
ing to provide the increased resources necessary 
to bring about a technological breakthrough. 
Prospects for Growth 
China's agricultural development program 
lacks a key element of the approach that has led 
to the so-called "green revolution" from which 
other Asian countries have benefited. The

introduction of new high-yielding varieties of seed 
has been the key to recent agricultural growth in

improved its water control and has increased the 
availability of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, 
electricity, and agricultural machinery, but the 
development of new seeds capable of producing 
very high yields under Chinese conditions has not 
been emphasized. China could import Mexican

but these have been developed for tropical or

PEKING STUDENTS ON WAY TO RESETTLEMENT IN COUNTRYSIDE 
In the short run, China may be able to 
achieve annual increases in grain production to 
match or slightly exceed population growth. Even 
Sc), however, any progress toward a more comfort-
able margin between the availability of food and 
consumption requirements is likely to be small at 
best and would only extend the hiatus inthe food/ 
population race. Although Chinese agriculture ap-
pears generally stronger now than in the late 
1950s, it remains to be seen whether it will be 
able to withstand successive years of bad weather 
such as that in 1959-61.

Over the long run, higher rates of agricul-
tural growth will hinge on the ability of the 
Chinese to develop food-raising techniques suited 
to their conditions. In time, irrigation can be 
expanded and chemical fertilizers of suitable 
types and quality could be made available if the 
regime chooses to allocate more resources to this 
effort. But the development of high-yielding seeds 
will remain a serious problem. Possibly the most 
serious impact of the Cultural Revolution on 
agriculture will prove to be the disruption of 
plant breeding programs. Not only have the sci-
entific methods most instrumental in the success 
of the "green revolution" in other countries been 
rejected, but many Chinese breeding programs 
have been terminated and the scientists running 
them dispersed throughout the country. 
Instead of capital investment, the regime is 
relying increasingly on investment in human tal-
ent, which is not likely to bring dividends for 
�many years. The transfer to the farms of excess 
urban population, consisting mostly of students, 
has been pursued with unusual vigor and con-
Special Report 
sistency since the Cultural Revolution subsided. 
These transfers serve multiple purposes, including 
making available to communes literate, relatively 
trained, manpower suited for professional, techni-
cal, medical, and other tasks. Educated youths, if 
they can be persuaded or forced to settle per-
manently in the communes, could potentially up-
grade all but the purely physical work being per-
formed and could gradually heighten the respon-
siveness of the entire rural population to new 
ideas. Although some of these youths reportedly 
have been assigned managerial and accounting 
tasks, the regime so far appears to be emphasizing 
their reform-through-labor, and little of their po-
tential value to the communes has been realized. 
Lastly, the stability that has marked Chinese 
agriculture for the past few years is fragile. Aside 
from the hazards of weather, doctrinally moti-
vated measures to increase the degree of collec-
tivization in rural areas and to eliminate "revi-
sionist" phenomena such as the private plots 
could lead to agricultural  problems similar to 
those of the early 1960s.

NEW' 
POLITICAL CHANGE IN GUATEMALA: ORDER vs. VIOLENCE 
The inauguration of Carlos Arana as president of Guatemala on 1 July will mark both a 
high point in the country's feeble democratic record and a test of the forces of orderly 
process. 
Arana will be Guatemala's first freely elected president to receive the office from the 
political opposition. Outgoing president Mendez Montenegro will be the first president to 
have completed his term since 1951 and only the third in the country's history to have done 
so. All legitimate forces have displayed a conOrnitment to set new constitutional political 
patterns and to break the country's traditional antidemocratic habits. 
Arana's victory, hovvever, represented a demand for greater governmental effectiveness 
against Communist terrorism; Arana came to nAitional prominence by decimating terrorists in 
the northeast a few years ago. Communists have long anticipated that popular aversion to the 
expected excesses of a right-wing government would provide them their greatest opportunity. 
The re-emergence of a rightist terrorist force in the past month provides a grim backdrop to 
the coming political change and has already dimmed hopes for peaceful progress. 
A Background of Terrorism 
The electorate, wearied by years of Commu-
nist terrorism and disillusioned by the bland 
government of the Revolutionary Party, turned to 
the anti-Communist champion, Colonel Arana, 
whose promise of peace and order won him a 
plurality in the elections on 1 March. Arana's 
reputation as an effective lawman rests on his 
eradication of guerrillas in the northeast between 
1966 and 1968. In that operation he turned 
armed rightist civilians against the guerrillas and 
their suspected supporters, effectively ending the 
strong Communist influence in the area. During 
the same period, special units of the army and 
police also launched an all-out attack on the sub-
versives, employing clandestine groups as assassi-
nation squads. The program of counterterrorism 
was highly effective in disrupting the Commu-
nists' networks and bases and in inhibiting sup-
port from their sympathizers. The attendant wave

of violence, however, also victimized many in-
nocents and evoked an international and domestic 
outcry. Stung by widespread publicity and criti-
cism, President Mendez halted the campaign in 
March 1968 and sent Colonel Arana to Nicaragua 
as ambassador. 
Communist activity during the following 
months was mostly organizational, although 
sporadic hit-and-run terrorism created a con-
tinuing security problem. Beginning last Decem-
ber, the Communists stepped up their efforts at 
sabotage and assassination in an abortive attempt 
to disrupt the elections. During the campaign 
period the terrorists, with virtual impunity, at-
tacked and killed more than a dozen security 
officials, a candidate for mayor of Guatemala 
City, and a highly regarded editor of the coun-
try's largest newspaper. They caused damage 
estimated in the millions of dollars in a series of 
fire-bombings in the capital. On the eve of the 
elections in March, they secured the release of a 
guerrilla by kidnaping the foreign minister, and a 
week later obtained the release of two others in 
exchange for the US labor attache. In these cir-
cumstances, the electorate gave the incumbent 
Revolutionary Party a no-confidence vote; it ran 
second to the rightist coalition backing Arana. 
Post-Election Violence 
The popular euphoria that resulted from fol-
lowing democratic processes and experiencing an 
unprecedented opposition victory in an honest 
election was short-lived. The nation was embar-
rassed and the world was shocked by the Com-
munists' brutal murder of the kidnaped West 
German ambassador on 5 April after the govern-
ment refused to ransom him. Even the Guate-
malan public, which might have been inured to 
brutality after a decade of terrorism, was stunned 
by the event. 
Mendez imposed a state of siege. Beyond 
press censorship designed mainly to squelch criti-
cism of the government, however, only token 
security measures were taken. Clearly Mendez had 
Special Report - 2 - 
decided that it was not in his interest to tackle 
the security problem. The security forces have all 
but suspended their normal activities, construing 
the administration's release of prisoners and other 
measures that undercut their efforts as Mendez' 
withdrawal from the battle against insurgency. 
Mendez' overriding desire has been and remains 
survival in office through his entire term, and he 
is a practiced advocate of sitting tight to ride out 
the storm. His motive for suspending animation 
may also be political, as Arana and his followers 
believe, because any successful anti-Communist 
activity would ease the insurgency problem for 
the new government. 
The unwillingness of the Mendez govern-
ment to move against the extreme left goaded the 
right again into wreaking its own vengeance. In 
late April, the extreme right's response to the 
violence of the left and the apathy of the govern-
ment was revealed by the discovery of the first 
mutilated victim of a new counterterror organiza-
tion. The new group, calling itself "Ojo por Ojo" 
(Eye for an Eye), appears to be made up of some 
former members of the army's clandestine assas-
sination squads as well as extremist civilians in 
Arana's camp. Ojo por Ojo has been responsible 
for as many as a dozen recent murders, whose 
victims had been tortured before death. 
The rightist revenge for Communist ter-
rorism, directed partly against the leftist intel-
lectual community, has evoked outraged denunci-
ation from university and other liberal circles. 
Following the assassination of an economics 
professor early this month, the university's 
governing council issued a declaration attacking 
government security forces for their passivity in 
the face of continuing violence. It called on the 
army to fulfill its constitutional role and to put 
an end to the terrorist acts. Other organizations 
associated with the left have issued similar state-
ments condemning threats by Ojo por Ojo re-
ceived recently by a number of their members. 
The obvious concern in these liberal circles is 
that the current wave of rightist terrorism is a

prelude to the policies of Arana's government. 
Arana apparently condones the Ojo organization's 
actions as a necessary expedient now but claims 
he will implement a strictly legal assault on the 
terrorist problem after his inauguration. Although 
he probably can rein in most of his extremist 
associates, his willingness to do so probably will 
depend on the level of Communist activity during 
the first days of his administration. 
Arana vs. the Insurgents 
Arana takes seriously his mandate to elimi-
nate the insurgency problem, and his enemies as 
well as his supporters expect a full-scale anti-
Communist campaign after he takes office. His 
more rabid backers and his opponents assume 
that Arana will pursue the same program against 
the Communists that he used earlier, that is, more 
widespread employment of Ojo-style tactics. 
Arana repeatedly has forsworn illegal meth-
ods and has assured the public that he has a plan 
of action within the law, although he declines to 
reveal it. In his contacts with US officials, the 
president-elect has discussed the need for better 
training for the security forces, better police 
laboratories and technical equipment, more per-
sonnel, better maintenance of arms, and improved 
communications and coordination of intelligence. 
He is contemplating the establishment of an "elite 
police corps," a small, trained outfit whose work 
would focus exclusively in the terrorist field. His 
advisers have spoken of using military tribunals to 
try accused subversives in order to bypass legally 
the established judicial system, which is weak and 
corrupt. 
Arana feels under great pressure to produce 
immediate results, but transforming the present 
security forces and judicial system into com-
petent, efficient organizations is at best a long-
range process. His major assets on 1 July when he 
begins his presidency are the good will of the 
armed forces and their desire to cooperate with 
him. Their past performance, however, has 
demonstrated their limited abilities. Moreover, 
Special Report 
continual personnel shifts and enforced inaction 
during the preinaugural period have thrown the 
security organizations, particularly the police, 
into administrative chaos. 
It seems unlikely, Arana's statements not-
withstanding, that he or his advisers have as yet 
constructed a legal plan for quick results. Arana's 
directness and his evident earnestness may lead 
him to make an immediate appeal for public 
support for, and patience with, his administra-
tion. Since entering politics last year, Arana has 
observed and commented on Guatemala's serious 
deficiencies in the social sphere. He promises to 
fight ignorance, poverty, and disease, so as to 
remove the causes of violent political dissidence. 
He probably hopes to play on these themes to 
gain acceptance and cooperation among those 
sectors of the public that are apprehensive and 
fearful that his may be a tyrannical regime.

Fear on the Left 
The moderation and social concern dis-
played by Arana as candidate and as president-
elect have not erased his image as "the butcher of 
Zacapa" held by many, and the Ojo's activities 
have added to the fear among the leftist opposi-
tion. Even the vice president elect, one of Arana's 
closest advisers, has expressed concern over the 
rightist terrorism and the characterization in the 
international press of the new leadership as 
"assassins." 
The presentiment that the Arana administra-
tion is a threat prevails in the intellectual com-
munity, the opposition political parties, the press, 
and labor organizations, as well as among Arana's 
obvious targets, the guerrillas and terrorists. Their 
foreboding will lead them to interpret Arana's 
actions and policies in the worst light, and if he 
proves thin-skinned, the gap between the opposi-
tion and the government will grow. 
The Communists 
Communist terrorism since the murder of 
the West German ambassador in April has con-
tinued at a relatively low level. The Ojo murders 
have claimed no victims among the hard-core ter-
rorists and therefore have probably only a mar-
ginal relationship to the Communist pull-back. 
The Communists may have an arranged or im-
plicit "deal" with the Mendez government to hold 
off terrorism in exchange for the virtual retire-
ment of the security forces for the rest of his 
term. 
It is clear that the insurgents hope to prove 
that the vaunted anti-Communist Arana can con-
trol them no better than past presidents. It seems 
likely that they will attempt to challenge him in 
the first days of his presidency and that they will 
attempt a terrorist act aimed at gaining wide 
publicity, such as the kidnaping or assassination 
of a prominent Guatemalan or a foreign diplomat. 
Unless the Arana administration can achieve an 
unprecedented breakthrough against the clan-
Special Report 
- 4 - 
destine terrorist organizations, this kind of hit-
and-run action will be almost impossible to stop. 
The Communists are believed to have the assets 
for a fairly prolonged period of terrorist activity 
in Guatemala City. 
The bulk of leftist terrorism is perpetrated 
by the fanatical Rebel Armed Forces (FAR), 
which is made up mainly of young, rabid leftists 
who consider violence the only method of un-
doing Guatemala's feudalistic socioeconomic 
structure. They are said to believe that their per-
sistent provocation of the security forces will lead 
to a bitterly harsh repressive period, which in turn 
will so alienate the general public that active 
popular support for the revolutionaries will result. 
The appearance of Ojo and the public outrage and 
revulsion that its activities have provoked are 
probably seen by the FAR as encouraging de-
velopments. 
Less devoted to violence but hardly averse to 
it, the Guatemalan Communist Party (PGT) has 
been under pressure for some weeks to avenge the 
recent deaths of two party members. The PGT, 
reportedly with some cooperation from the FAR, 
has been concentrating on US targets, and clan-
destine sources indicate that plans to assassinate 
US Embassy officials have failed only because of 
increased security measures in effect at the 
Mission. The Communists identify US representa-
tives with the Guatemalan security forces and 
with the "repressive" government policies because 
of US military training of and aid to the security 
forces. 
Arana's Dilemma 
If the Communists launch a terrorist 
campaign early in July, Arana is likely to find the 
legal weapons at his disposal as ineffective as they 
have been in the past. In office, as now, he may 
find it difficult to resist reverting to methods he 
has seen work well in the past. In any event, the 
strength of his resolve to resist it should become 
apparent soon after he takes office.

The brutal cycle of score-settling between
