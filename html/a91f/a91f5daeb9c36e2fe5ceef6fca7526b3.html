 SEVERAL QUESTIONS ON CURRENT ECONOMIC WORK
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 2-10
 [Speech by Zhao Ziyang at the national industrial and communications work
 conference on 4 March 1982]
 [Text]  The current national conference of industry and communications has
 discussed and studied measures for such issues as improving the economic
 results and doing a good job in this year's industrial production, communi-
 cations and transport.  Experiences in this regard have also been exchanged.
 According to everybody's view, the meeting is a successful one as it is held
 at an early date and it has a clear and definite guiding thought and a
 prominent central theme. Everybody maintains that this meeting will give a
 great impetus to this year's industrial and communications work.  Now I
 would like to talk about the following questions:
 I.  On the Question of Raising Economic Results
 On the basis of last year's remarkable achievements, our country has made
 further progress in industrial production since the beginning of this year.
 Judging from the results of January and February, the trend in production is
 good, and it is completely possible to fulfill this year's target of ensuring
 a 4-percent increase and striving for a 5-percent increase in total indus-
 trial output over last year.  What we are afraid of this year is not about
 the problem of growth rate but about the failure to pay attention to economic
 results.  It has been reported that there are still many cases of raising the
 quotas of output value at each level.  While presenting the target of ensuring
 a 4-percent increase and striving for a 5-percent increase, the central
 authorities have already taken into consideration the speed of growth plan-
 ned by various provinces and have incorporated this factor in the state's
 unified plan.  However, certain. localities and departments, while handing
 down the quotas, have raised the quotas at each level regardless of possi
 bilities.  Everybody wants to achieve a greater output value and speed up the
 growth.  This is beyond reproach.  During the period of readjustment, our
 country's national economic development must maintain a steady speed and we
 must not think that the slower the speed, the better.  The issue is:  We must
 unify speed with results.  We must strive to attain the goal of having good
 results as well as a rapid increase in output value.  It is certainly a good
 thing if such speed can be further accelerated; but if we only pursue output

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 value and pay no attention to results, such a "speed" will do us more harm
 than good. Rather we should work in a down-to-earth manner so that our work
 will not be hindered by our seeking false reputation.  The main problem now
 is not negligence of output value, but negligence of results.  Certain
 localities and units have made much greater efforts to increase output value
 than to raise economic results, or they have only verbally claimed to raise
 economic results but have taken no practical and effective measures to attain
 the goal.  The State Council maintains that it is necessary to emphasize
 correcting the guiding thought in industrial production.  This is to say that
 we must stress economic results and a solid, not inflated, speed.  This issue
 of having a correct guiding thought applies not only in industrial produc-
 tion, but also in capital construction, circulation and other fields of the
 national economy.
 For a long period, we ignored benefits in blind pursuit of increased output
 in industrial production and did a great many foolish things.  In the years
 after 1958 and during the "Great Cultural Revolution," the output figures
 were considerably inflated and waste was quite serious.  The lessons in this
 respect are very profound.  This problem continued after the smashing of the
 "gang of four."  Although last year the figures were less inflated than in
 the past, many localities reported sharp increases in output values during
 the fourth quarter.  This also caused some problems.  Various provinces
 should figure out the extent of exaggeration in their growth rates in order..
 to be sober-minded.  Blind pursuit of increased output will necessarily
 result in the stockpiling of large quantities of goods.  According to the
 data of the State Statistical Bureau, 58 major products were excessively
 stocked by commercial departments at the end of 1981.  Output increase of
 certain products may be advantageous from the view of the part, but the
 result may be completely opposite if seen from the whole.  For example, in
 east and northeast China where energy was already in short supply, some
 localities greatly overproduced for export ferroalloy and other products
 that consume large amounts of energy.  This forced the east and northeast
 China power systems to generate more electricity than their capacity, or "eat
 their corn in the blade," as the saying goes, in order to meet the power and
 energy requirements.   Such practices, if continued, will not only aggravate
 the dislocation but will also result in the recurrence of the past phenomena
 when "industry reported good news, commerce reported bad news, warehouses
 became overstocked and the financial revenue was zero."  In the end, the
 banks were asked to issue notes to cover the deficits and the state and
 people suffered from it.  If it was inevitable for us to do some foolish
 things in the past because of our lack of experience, we should have learned
 from them and become wiser.  We must not repeat those foolish things of the
 past.  Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out that to pay attention to economic
 results is an extremely important policy in all work.  We should tap our
 potential and quicken our pace in raising the economic results.  Last year
 at the Fourth Session of the Fifth NPC, the State Council put forth 10
 principles for economic construction.  The key point of these principles is
 to raise the economic results.  Now that the NPC has approved these prin-
 ciples, we must fulfill them by our actions; they must not remain just words.
 This year we must have a major change and open up a new phase in raising
 economic results.

 When we talk about economic results, it is first of all necessary to make
 clear one main point, that is, that we should spend as little living labor
 and as few materials as possible to produce still more products that meet
 society's needs.  The first part of this sentence means that it is necessary
 to be as economical as possible and to reduce as much as possible the
 expenditure of living labor and materials.  The second part of the sentence
 means that it is necessary to create more property for society, the key here
 being that the products must "meet the needs of society."  It is not suffi-
 cient just to talk about producing more products, since that would not affect
 economic results.  If the products are not what society needs, then the more
 we produce of them, the greater waste there will be.  Therefore, the products
 we produce, including their quality, color, design and quantity, must meet
 the needs of society and be readily marketable.  These needs are realistic
 and coincide with the actual 'level of investment and purchasing power.
 Society's needs are many-sided; they include the production needs and con-
 sumption needs and consist of demands in both of these two major categories.
 These needs change continuously with the development of production and con-
 struction and the improvement of the people's livelihood; there are different
 needs for different stages and each individual locality has its special needs.
 Whether we produce medium- and high-grade products or popular goods of
 dependable quality, we should always meet the needs of society.  Only when
 the products meet the needs of society can the labor expended for these
 products win society's approval and can we have valuable and useful products
 instead;of having wasted labor and useless articles.  Our plans should pro-
 ceed from the overall situation and take into account the future and the
 past; they should.reflect as accurately as possible society's demands and
 meet the needs in the development of society.  Only thus can we enable the
 national economy to develop in coordination with plans and in a proportional
 manner.  If the products do not meet society's needs and are not readily
 marketable, there can be no proportionate and coordinated development.  In
 our economic work in the past, what we neglected was exactly this fundamental
 point; consequently many problems arose.  Producing more products that meet
 the needs of society with the expenditure of as little living labor and as
 few materials as possible is precisely what basic socialist economic law
 demands, and what the law of developing the national economy according to'
 plans and in a proportional manner calls for.  A socialist country should
 study the needs of society well and continually satisfy the needs of society;
 this is the aim we communists strive for.  This guiding ideology must be
 firmly established.  In handling economic work, the whole party should con-
 centrate its efforts on  saving as much living labor and as many materials
 as possible and on meeting the needs of society.  It should make efforts to
 find new ways of raising economic results.
 The question of raising economic results involves various aspects and is a
 considerably difficult question.  As to why it is not easy to succeed in
 meeting the needs of society, there are two main reasons:  One is limited
 understanding.  Society's needs cannot be seen clearly at once, and it is
 especially difficult to see them clearly beforehand.  It is usually when
 commodities go out of stock in the markets that their shortages are noticed,
 and it is usually when the warehouses are filled with stockpiled commodities
 that their excessive quantities are discovered.  This demands timely

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 understanding of the needs of society, understanding of market changes and
 trends, and improvement and enhancement of the level of planning work.  The
 other reason concerns the question of interest relations.  We should
 ascribe definite interests to enterprises and recognize and take care of
 the definite interests of localities.  Failing to recognize such interests.
 will result in eating "in the same canteen as everyone else," in which
 situation anyone can become irresponsible.  When definite interests are
 ascribed to them, it will be easy for departments, localities and enter-
 prises'to determine their economic activities according to their interests.
 Some of the policy decisions of departments, localities and enterprises meet
 the needs of society, but others run counter to these needs.  Although some
 products may not meet the needs of society, their production is carried on as
 usual; the plants share profits as usual; the localities receive a greater
 percentage of the profits and the commercial and supplies departments do not
 have to worry about overstocking of these products in the warehouses after
 their purchases because in the end they are completely taken care of by state
 finance.  Consequently, falsehoods about output value continue. protractedly
 without ever being resolved.  Therefore, fundamentally, besides the demand
 that enterprises improve their business management and raise their scientific
 and technological level, raising economic results involves the questions of
 economic systems and economic structures and depends on the readjustment of
 economic structures and the reform of economic systems; there is no other
 way out.  However, we cannot just wait and hold off our actions until the
 economic systems have been reformed and the economic structures have been
 readjusted.  To solve this problem under the present situation in which
 system, structures and prices are all irrational, it is necessary to bring
 into full play the role of the leadership, namely, by strengthening guidance
 in planning and administrative intervention and strengthening supervision and
 inspection.  An important task of the planning and economic commissions at
 various levels is to find out the extent of stockpiling, make a concrete
 analysis and seriously deal with it.  If the products are needed by society
 but are stockpiled due to problems in the circulation of commodities, efforts
 should be made to actively strengthen marketing work and especially to open
 up rural markets or, in some cases, international markets.  If the products
 are clearly not needed by society and are in the category of impractical
 goods from the view of the whole, administrative and economic measures should
 be applied.  In such cases, administrative intervention should be firmly made
 without any fear of giving offense.  If certain products are indeed over-
 produced, their production should be restricted.  If certain products are
 temporarily in short supply, there is no need for us to rush headlong into
 producing them all at the same time.  In stressing economic benefits, we
 should not only keep sight of the immediate benefits and the benefits to the
 part, but more important, we should not lose sight of the long-term benefits
 and the benefits to the whole.  To make products meet society's needs--in
 addition to readjusting plans in a timely manner in light of market changes
 and intervening administratively and applying economic measures--it is neces-
 sary to strengthen market forecasting and improve planning work.  At the same
 time, it is necessary to formulate and publish the economic and technical
 criteria for products and the criteria for factory construction as quickly
 as possible and strictly enforce this criteria in order to stop blind fac-
 tory construction and blind production.

 Bringing economic work to the path of raising economic results is the key to
 achieving a fundamental improvement of the financial and economic situation.
 We should spare no efforts to produce results in this regard.  This is a new
 task for the vast number of cadres and workers on the economic front.  It is
 also a new test for us all.
 In the current industrial and communications work, the people's concern, as
 reflected in their reports, is concentrated mainly on energy and transporta-
 tion issues.  I will make three points:  First, the coal, railway and com-
 munications ministries should make further efforts in carrying out the pro-
 duction, allocation and shipment of coal.      Coal production was not bad in
 the first 2 months of this year and coal transportation was also good.  But
 the implementation of the allocation plan was rather poor.  Earnest measures
 should be taken to change this situation.  Second, all localities should
 arrange their production in light of the energy supply situation.  They
 should balance their industrial growth rates with the local energy supply;
 otherwise their goals will fall through.  There are at present some locali-
 ties that set very high targets for themselves and then ask the state to
 allocate more coal.  This cannot be done.  Third, energy supply cannot be
 expected to increase at present.  The primary way out is to economize.  It
 is necessary to save energy by every possible means.  The energy shortage
 will not be resolved if we do not work to economize.
 II.  On the Question of Adhering to the Principle of Giving Highest Priority
 to the Planned Economy and Taking the Whole Country and the Overall Situation
 Into Account
 Comrade Chen Yun recently made a series of important instructions on
 economic work.  He once again stressed:  Our country must adhere to the
 principle of giving highest priority to the planned economy with market
 force playing a subsidiary role.  In national construction, the whole country
 and the overall situation must be taken into account.  The fundamental policy
 that "first we must eat, second we must construct" must be implemented.  He
 also pointed out that the first priority task of the special economic zones
 is to seriously sum up experier}ces.  These instructions all concern the major
 questions of principles and policies in economic construction and were put
 forward in light of the questions existing in our present economic life.
 They are of great immediate importance.  They are in keeping with our
 economic policy of the recent years that calls for opening up our country
 externally and enlivening our economy internally.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, under the
 unified leadership of the state and the guidance of state planning, we have
 enforced the policy of opening up our country externally and enlivening our
 economy internally.  Our orientation is correct and our achievements are the
 main aspect.  Without these reforms, we would not have the good situation we
 have today.   This we must first affirm.  However, in implementing the policy
 of opening up our country externally and enlivening the economy internally,
 we must be sober-minded and adhere to the aforementioned several principles
 put forward by Comrade Chen Yun, which are also the fundamental principles
 and policies our party has upheld for years.  They must not be forsaken or

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 be weakened.  At present, while keeping sight of our achievements in opening
 up our country and enlivening our economy we must also be soberly aware that
 our opening up and enlivening will inevitably bring a number of problems.  In
 this regard, we should have the courage to use the current favorable inter-
 national and domestic conditions and continue to uphold the policy of opening
 up our country externally and enlivening our economy internally in order to
 promote our economic development.  We must not waver over the established
 correct policy.  At the same time, we must adequately recognize the problems
 brought about by this policy.  We must not turn a blind eye to them or leave
 them alone.  Today in stressing the need for giving highest priority to the
 planned economy and taking the whole country and the overall situation into
 account, our purpose is precisely to keep us sober-minded so that we can
 adopt measures to prevent the emergence of problems or resolve them if they
 have already emerged; to correctly and soundly implement the policy of open-
 ing up our country externally and enlivening our economy internally; to
 strengthen the position of planned economy; and to create conditions for
 further reforming our economic structure.
 The purpose of our open-door policy is to introduce into our country foreign
 advanced technology and administrative knowledge as well as capital, which
 is useful to us in spurring our country's socialist construction.  Because
 of the open-door policy, certain bad influences from capitalist countries
 will inevitably find their way into our country.  Smuggling, peddling smug-
 gled goods, speculation, swindling, corruption and accepting bribes have
 become rampant in certain localities and units; the capitalist living style
 and decadent ideology will corrode our party; certain weak-willed cadres
 will succumb to "sugar-coated bullets"; and our party members' work style
 and the people's habits may be contaminated.  Our party, on several occa-
 sions in the past, when it carried out important new policies and faced new
 historical turning points, raised the issue that it was necessary to guard
 against capitalist inroads.  One example was during KMT-CCP cooperation
 at the initial period of the war to resist Japanese aggression.   The main'
 problem needing to be resolved in those days was to combat factionalism and
 closed-doorism and open a new situation for the united front.  At the same
 time, the party Central Committee explicitly pointed out that the CCP must
 maintain its ideological, political and organizational independence, adhere
 to the stand of acting independently and, keeping the initiative in our own
 hands, guard against problems generating from within our party.  We did a
 very good job at that time.  We took advantage of the favorable situation-
 and, greatly expanding our strength, created a new situation.  Instead of
 being corroded, our party become stronger.  The second example was after
 victory in the liberation war..  After acquiring national political power, our
 party members entered the cities from the rural areas and faced a dazzling
 world of humanity with its myriad temptations.  In those days, the party
 Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong quickly reminded the. whole party
 that it was necessary to guard against the attack of "sugar-coated bullets."
 Later, movements against the three and five evils were carried out.   In
 those days, our party's political, ideological and organizational situation
 was very sound and we withstood the test.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 Now we are taking advantage of the favorable international and domestic
 situation and are carrying out the policy of opening our doors to foreign
 countries and enlivening the economy at home, and we are facing another
 rigorous test.  This time our party is confronting a much greater and more
 serious influence from decadent capitalist ideology at home and abroad,
 particularly the influence of international capitalism, than on the previous
 two occasions.  Moreover, after a decade of turmoil, our party's fine tradi-
 tions and work style have been impaired.  Therefore, during this new his-
 torical period, it is all the more necessary to quickly alert all party
 members to the questions of capitalist inroads.  By sounding this alarm
 we hope we can help our party members come to their senses, heighten their
 spirit and strengthen their will to withstand the test.
 Today, smuggling, peddling smuggled goods, speculation, swindling, corrup-
 tion, accepting bribes and other crimes in the economic sphere are much more
 serious than during the movements to oppose the three and five evils in 1952.
 The inroads of such crimes on our party organizations and cadres' contingents
 and their pernicious influence on the entire society are quite serious.  This
 situation, if not struggled against immediately with determination, will
 develop from bad to worse in certain localities and will be unstoppable in
 2 or 3 years.  This is a prominent expression of the inroads of capitalist
 ideology under the new historical conditions--conditions of externally carry-
 ing out an open-door policy and internally enlivening the economy--and our
 struggle against all sorts of crimes in the economic sphere, is an important
 part in our allout struggle against capitalist inroads.  This struggle is
 inevitable and is a protracted one.  Just as Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out:
 This is an extremely vital issue, which has an important bearing on our
 party's survival and on our country's prosperity or decline.
 We must be fully aware of the seriousness, harmful effects and danger of the
 various crimes in the economic sphere and raise our consciousness of waging
 this struggle properly.  If we fail to resolutely and powerfully strike at
 such crimes as smuggling, peddling smuggled goods, speculation, swindling,
 corruption and accepting bribes, not only will our building of a material
 civilization, be seriously undermined, the building of a spiritual civiliza-
 tion will simply fail.                   Now the activities of rebuffing economic crimes are
 going on simultaneously with the "courtesy month" activities and the masses
 have acclaimed these activities and said our country is hopeful.  All units
 on the economic front must resolutely carry out this struggle through to the
 end:  By no means should they act perfunctorily or superficially.  Of course,
 when we carry out this struggle we will not resort to the method of handling
 legal cases and exert special efforts to deal with major cases.  This
 struggle will be carried out along with the overall reorganization of our
 enterprises and the general examination of financial affairs.  We must,
 through reorganization and examination, find the clues, strengthen investi-
 gation, and track down and seriously handle the problems so as to strike at
 the criminals and educate our cadres.  At the same time, we must establish
 and improve various rules and regulations and plug loopholes so that the
 criminals will not be able to avail themselves of them.  Doing this will
 spur our efforts to improve management, economic accounting and economic
 results.

 Another conspicuous problem is the recent growth of the trend toward depart-
 mentalism, decentralism and liberalism in the economic sphere.  This is
 another major problem which has cropped up under the new historical condi-
 tions.. We have domestically implemented the policy of activating our
 economy, delegated some powers to the local authorities and enlarged the
 enterprises' decisionmaking powers for the purposes of whipping up the
 enthusiasm of the local authorities, the various departments and enterprises
 and the masses, turning human talents and land and other material resources
 to good account and vigorously developing China's national economy.  Efforts
 to expand decisionmaking powers and activate the economy are also apt to
 foster the trend toward departmentalism, decentralism and liberalism, to
 weaken and depart from the state's unified plan, to interfere with and break
 up the unified market of socialism and to affect our efforts to take the
 whole country and the overall situation into consideration.  Instead of
 surveying and dealing with problems on the basis of the overall interests of
 the state, some localities and units take into account the local as well as
 their own interests.  In dealing with the higher level, they disobey the
 unified plans of the state and seek private gain at public expense.  In deal-
 ing with the units and other localities concerned, they shift their troubles
 onto others and harm others to benefit themselves.  In conducting foreign
 trade, they refuse to implement the policy of unifying as one and joining
 efforts to deal with foreign countries, and jostle against each other.  As a
 result, the foreign countries reap the benefits.  There are presently still
 many signs of people carrying out construction and production blindly in
 disregard of the needs in society as well as the overall and long-term
 interests of the state.  In some localities, the tasks for state monopoly and
 compulsory purchase have been shirked.  Economic blockade between one dis-
 trict and another is fairly serious.  There are many examples in this respect.
 Ours is a unified socialist nation.  We must have a unified plan and unified
 domestic market.  We must not allow one market for one province.  If this
 practice is permitted, its political and economic consequences to our nation
 will be unimaginable.   Also, for example, in the field of foreign trade,
 there is evidence of various districts, departments and enterprises vying
 with each other in cutting prices and counteracting each other's efforts.
 This has caused considerable damage already.  The result is that by counter-
 acting each other's efforts, the local authorities and enterprises reap some
 small benefits while the state suffers a great deal.
 In order to strengthen centralization and unification in economic work, we
 must adhere to the overall plan on major issues while allowing freedom on
 minor issues.  We must advocate centralism on major issues while allowing
 decentralism on minor issues.  We must also correctly handle the relations
 between the practice of taking the whole country and the overall situation
 into account and the practice of whipping up local enthusiasm.  The state
 must interfere with these erroneous practices and issue orders to eliminate
 them.  It must not allow each one to pursue his own course.
 1.  In foreign trade, we must adhere to the policy of unifying as one and
 joining our efforts in dealing with foreign countries.  After expanding the
 powers of the local authorities and various departments in conducting
 foreign trade, we must resolutely adopt effective measures to eliminate the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 erroneous practice of vying with each other in dealing with foreign countries
 and in cutting prices.  In foreign trade, it is necessary to appropriately
 expand the powers of the local authorities.  However, at the same time, we
 must thoroughly solve the problem of selling products of the same category
 abroad in a unified manner.  With a main port as a center, we must form a
 joint administration in exporting products of the same category in order to
 strengthen our coordination and management.  After the powers in foreign
 trade are expanded according to district, the nine coastal provinces and
 municipalities in particular must exert still greater efforts in strengthen-
 ing their unity in selling the products of the same category abroad, and
 thoroughly prevent each of them from forming an individual system in foreign
 trade so as to avoid disrupting their traditional and historical relations in
 coordination.  The departments concerned must formulate necessary measures to
 strengthen coordination and unity with the support of central cities and main
 ports.
 2.   The products to be transferred according to state plans, including farm
 and sideline products, must be transferred strictly according to such plans.
 No one is allowed to retain them for his own use or to utilize them as a
 means of cooperation with others or to sell them at a negotiated price.
 3.   We must resolutely correct the practice of enforcing economic blockade
 between one district and another.  Except for those to be allotted or
 delivered according to state plans, all products which have met the standards
 set by the state and those products produced in accordance with state plans
 are permitted to be marketed throughout the country.  The enterprises are
 authorized to select and purchase the products themselves.  The party and
 government organs in various localities must not interfere with the enter-
 prises.  If they do, the enterprises have the right to resist such inter-
 ference.
 It is necessary to care for old base areas, the regions inhabited by
 minority people and remote areas.  It is necessary to provide technology and
 equipment to help these areas turn out products suited for local production
 and achieve even greater economic development.
 4.  The commodity price and revenue system must be centralized and unified.
 Without the approval of the State Council, no locality, department or unit
 is allowed to change a tariff rate or reduce or increase taxes.  Without the
 approval of the State Council, the price of any product within the limits of
 state commodity price control must not be increased or decreased.
 Comrade Chen Yun said:  The task of top priority in the special economic
 zones at present is to summarize experience.   I think the question of
 earnestly summarizing experience not only prevails in the special economic
 zones or in the two provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, but also in the whole
 country.  All these reforms aimed at activating the economy at home and
 those within the foreign trade system must be reviewed and summarized to
 help us remain sober-minded and thoroughly solve the problems which have
 cropped up so that the reforms within the economic system will be healthily
 and extensively developed.  For example, we must advocate the expansion of'

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 the enterprises' decisionmaking powers and the implementation of the
 economic responsibility system.  However, we are indeed faced with the
 question of how to divide profits.  We must carefully study how to take
 into account the interests of the state, the collective and the individuals
 simultaneously and to determine the share belonging to the state, to the
 enterprises and to the individuals as well as the most appropriate form of
 distribution.  After the expansion of the enterprises' decisionmaking powers,
 we must.. also strengthen the management and supervision over such enter-
 prises accordingly.  To let the local authorities adequately share some
 powers is necessary.  However, we must study how to avoid setting up
 economic blockades between one locality and other, and keep from following
 the trends of departmentalism and decentralism that may possibly prevail and
 how to prevent such trends from affecting the necessary practice of central-
 ism and unification in China's economic work and to keep them from influ-
 encing the country as a whole.  On the one hand, the foreign trade departments
 must pay attention to bringing into full play the enthusiasm of the units at
 all levels.  On the other hand, they must also prevent themselves from com-
 peting against and undermining each other in front of foreign businessmen.
 In this respect, we must also earnestly sum up our experience.  In short,
 the open-door policy in foreign trade and the policy of enlivening the
 economy domestically will not change, and the orientation for carrying.out
 reforms remains firm.  However, we must pay full attention to existing
 problems and sum up our experience and lessons.  We are doing this pre-
 cisely because we seek to do a still better job in enforcing reforms from
 now on.
 The tentative plan for reform is:
 1.  The economic policies that have been put into practice generally will
 not be changed this year in order to maintain their stability and continuity.
 As far as the policy on economic results is concerned, the practice and
 level prescribed by the government last year should be generally maintained
 in terms of economic relationships between the state and the enterprise, and
 between the state and the enterprise on the one hand, and the individual on
 the other.   However, extreme irrationalities in some individual units
 should be appropriately readjusted.
 2.  This year we should also consider what is to be done next year.  By
 summarizing our experiences, we should put forward our views on how to
 complement, perfect or readjust the implemented policies and measures for
 next year.   There appear to be three situations in this regard, one being
 that in which policies and measures which are effective and correct in
 orientation should be upheld.  Another situation is that in which some
 policies and measures are correct in orientation but have side effects.
 These policies and measures should be continuously carried out if such
 effects can be eliminated by strengthening management.   In this case, it is
 necessary to strengthen management in order to consolidate and improve the
 policies and measures.  Some policies and measures are basically correct in
 orientation, but their side effects cannot be eliminated for a fairly long
 time because management cannot keep up with the situation.   In this case, an
 appropriate readjustment should be made.   The third situation is one in which

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 improper policies and measures should be corrected next year.  No matter
 what reform is to be carried out, the general guideline is to combine the
 strengthening of centralization and unification with the activation of the
 economy and to bring into full play the initiative of localities, depart-
 ments, enterprises and people under the guidance of state planning and the
 principle of taking the whole country into account.
 3.  It is necessary to work out as soon as possible an overall plan for
 reforming the economic system so that we shall have a long-term plan for
 reform.
 III.  On the Question of All-Round Consolidation and Readjustment of
 Enterprises
 Efforts must be made to consolidate enterprises in order to achieve better
 economic results.  Otherwise, there would be no foundation for all other
 work.  The party Central Committee and the State Council have clearly
 defined the purpose and requirements of enterprise consolidation and have
 laid down explicit principles and policies in this regard.   Now I will
 particularly discuss the following several points:
 1.  The first group of enterprises selected for consolidation this year
 should be big- and medium-sized key enterprises with more problems and a
 great potential and which urgently need to be consolidated.  Many in this
 group should not be good enterprises; enterprises with more problems should
 be consolidated first.  When these enterprises are consolidated well, their
 results will be raised quickly.  Some enterprises that have a strong leading
 body and have done basic work well may carry out their consolidation by
 themselves or may be consolidated later.  In this spirit, the lists of
 enterprises selected for consolidation in various localities should be
 adjusted.
 2.  Special attention should be paid to staffing enterprise leading bodies
 and reforming the leadership system.  Judging from the streamlining of the
 State Council, the readjustment and strengthening of enterprise leading
 bodies can be carried out at a faster pace and they can become compact and
 efficient leading bodies.  When the central administrative structure is
 streamlined, it will give a tremendous stimulus to enterprises in this
 regard.  Enterprises have many qualified cadres and technicians in their
 thirties or forties who are well versed in their fields of work and who have
 both ability and political integrity.  A number of them should be selected
 and promoted to positions in leading bodies so that great progress can be
 made in having leading bodies consist of revolutionary, well-educated,
 professionally competent and young cadres.  In this way, it will be possible
 to bring about a noticeable change in this regard.  To achieve this purpose,
 there should be an age limit in selecting and appointing managers and
 assistant managers of enterprises and directors and deputy directors of
 factories during the consolidation.  Except for such exceptionally big
 enterprises as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and such national corpora-
 tions as the China Shipping Corporation, it is necessary to select as far as
 possible personnel below age 50 and no older than 55 for managers, assistant

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 managers, factory directors and deputy directors.  Party committee secre-
 taries and responsible persons of workers congresses may be a little older
 but not too old.  Some comrades in enterprises who have not reached the
 retirement age and are still physically fit may go to the second line to
 serve as staff officers or advisers to do counseling work.  Some comrades
 have suggested that personnel with an educational level equivalent to that
 of a college graduate and with practical experiences be selected for
 directors of big key enterprises.  This is a good suggestion.  If it is
 difficult for some enterprises to select personnel with the educational level
 equal to that of a college graduate for their directors, they should at least
 select persons who have the educational level of a polytechnical school
 graduate or those who have become qualified through self-study to be their
 directors.  Only by properly staffing enterprise leading bodies during the
 consolidation will it be possible to bring about a big change in the outlook
 of the enterprises.
 3.  It is imperative to staff various units according to their fixed number
 of personnel and to train workers and staff members in rotation.  After
 streamlining the administrative structure, a large number of cadres of
 central organs should be organized for study and training in rotation.  This
 is a matter of strategic significance.  During the enterprise consolidation,
 coupled with the institution of the economic responsibility system, it is
 necessary to be determined to get the surplus workers and staff members out
 for study and to persevere in doing so.  Then, there will be a change in the
 educational level of all workers and staff members after a few years.  If the
 surplus personnel should be allowed to remain in workshops and sections and
 on shifts, many malpractices will occur.  This situation must be corrected.
 People in all localities should work hard in order to gain experiences in
 this regard.
 4.  We must strengthen leadership in a conscientious way.  Party committees
 and governments at all levels must place the overall reorganizations of
 enterprises on their agenda and leading comrades themselves should take
 charge of this task.  Economic commissions at all levels as well as all
 industrial and communications ministries, departments and bureaus must
 carry out this task in a practical way, and those teams assigned to work
 at selected units must carry out their assignments in earnest.  The central
 authorities have decided that the organizational reform will not be
 initiated in provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions this year so
 that energies can be concentrated on enterprise reorganization and other
 tasks.  All ministries under the State Council must assign someone to be
 especially in charge of this task and changes in the organs should not
 interfere with this task.  All ministries concerned are requested to
 immediately hold meetings to study this task, work out plans and send out
 teams to work at selected units.  The State Economic Commission is to be
 responsible for inspecting and supervising this task.  We must carry out the
 task of reorganization in a down-to-earth manner for 2 or 3 years, promote
 all fundamental work at enterprises to meet the demands set by the central
 authorities, and greatly enhance their economic results so that there will
 emerge an entirely new look at the enterprises.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 In connection with the enterprise reorganization, there is another problem,
 namely, readjustment of enterprises.  Those industrial enterprises that turn
 out products not meeting social demands, that consume too much energy or that
 have long operated at a loss should be shut down, and have their operations
 suspended; they should be amalgamated or switched to the manufacture of other
 products and the practice of blindly setting up new industrial enterprises
 should be stopped.  This is a positive measure taken to enhance the overall
 economic results of the society and to make the lineup of enterprises as
 well as the geographical distribution of industries become rational.  Taking
 into consideration that enterprise reorganization has to be carried out as a
 major task, that cases of violations in economic fields have to be handled
 and that the reform of organs has to be promoted this year, we should be
 aware that a lot of work has to be done this year.  In this connection,
 enterprise readjustment can be carried out only within a certain limit in
 1982.  Among those enterprises that have to be closed down or have their
 operations suspended first are metallurgical plants and chemical plants con-
 suming much energy, machine-building plants and electronics plants turning
 out products of very poor quality, oil refineries achieving very poor
 economic results and some industrial enterprises run by communes or produc-
 tion brigades that contend with advanced enterprises for the supply of raw
 materials, fuel and power.  Efforts should also be made to arrange their
 problems in order of importance and urgency, and to work out plans for enter-
 prise readjustment as well as practical measures to deal with those enter-
 prises that have to be closed down or have their operations suspended so as
 to be well prepared for promoting this task in a planned way next year.
 At the same time, we must also pay attention to the promotion of major tech-
 nological reforms at enterprises in a planned way.  During the current period
 of economic readjustment, many machine-building plants are seriously in need
 of tasks to achieve while over 20 million dun of rolled steel is stocked in
 warehouses and the contingent of capital construction teams does not have
 much work to do while wages have to be paid and management expenditures
 have to be spent.  On the other hand, plant facilities have become out of
 date and some of them have to be replaced with new ones.  Can't we think of
 some way to "make a start" somewhere and activate work in various fields??
 We must consider the possibility of banks issuing loans to machine-building
 plants in the form of credit loans to sellers, of alloting rolled steel to
 these plants for the manufacture of new highly efficient equipment and of
 selling the equipment to those enterprises that need it to replace old
 equipment that is low in efficiency but high in energy consumption.  It will
 not cost too much to carry out this task, for in promoting technological
 reforms, funds spent on equipment account for about 85 percent of the total
 investment under general circumstances.   Some civil engineering projects
 have also to be completed.  Since these projects will not need much funding,
 preparations for such projects can be made by either local units or enter-
 prises themselves.  Once this measure is taken, overstocked rolled steel
 will have an outlet, machine-building industry will be reactivated, the
 amount of waste iron and steel that can be supplied for remelting in
 furnaces will be increased, metallurgical industry will be given an impetus,
 tax revenues for the state will be increased and a new outlook will be
 brought about to the technology and equipment at various plants.  This was

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 tried out at the No 2 motor works with good results last year.  We must make
 a start'in technological reform and renewal of facilities this year.  In
 promoting the technological reform centering on energy conservation, we must,
 first of all, reform technology in turning out several major products,
 including boilers, motor vehicles, transformers, water pumps and fanning
 machines [feng ji 7364 26231 as well as a number of basic parts for machines.
 We must do a good job in promoting technological reforms at such large enter-
 prises as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Nanjing Chemical Indus-
 trial Company, acquire some experience in this concern and then popularize
 their experiences.
 IV.  On the Question of Finance
 The readjustment work was carried out conscientiously in 1981 by imple-
 menting the guidelines of the central work conference held in December 1980.
 As a result, the financial situation in 1981 was better than expected.
 Revenues totaled 102.8 percent of the annual plans.  There was a deficit of
 less than 2.7 billion yuan, the figure mentioned in the report to the Fourth
 Session of the Fifth National People's Congress.  However, we are still con-
 fronted with considerably great difficulties in finance.  As stated in the
 1982 state budgets, we anticipate the expenditures to exceed revenues by
 3 billion yuan this year.  Therefore, while noting the excellent situation
 we must also anticipate latent dangers in financial work this year.  If we
 fail to achieve a balance between financial revenues and expenditures in the
 main, the deficit will increase and it will lead to issuance of more cur-
 rency.  This will affect not only the basic stability of commodity prices at
 markets but also the situation of stability and unity.
 The general guideline for this year is to consolidate and stabilize the
 economic achievements and march forward steadily on this basis.  Whatever
 happens, we cannot lower our guard after having initially stabilized the
 economy and thus aggravate the latent danger again.   To this end, the
 Central Committee and the State Council have asked for efforts to further
 implement the policy of readjustment, restructuring, reorganization and
 upgrading and to continuously maintain a basic balance of revenues and
 expenditures and of credit receipts and payments together with a basic
 stability of commodity prices.  This is not only an economic question but
 also a political one.
 Fundamentally speaking, to resolve a financial question, it is necessary to
 develop production in earnest, improve economic results and do a good job in
 increasing revenues and cutting expenditures.   Besides continuously and
 energetically developing the production of consumer goods as planned, chang-
 ing the service orientation of heavy industry and conscientiously
 reorganizing enterprises, efforts should be. made to grasp the following
 well:
 1.  The purchase price of agricultural and sideline products should be
 stabilized.  The financial burden has become very heavy as more money is
 put into circulation and many different kinds of subsidies are offered.  In
 1981 the state gave subsidies of 32 billion yuan for more than 30 kinds of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 commodities, of which over 80 percent had something to do with the prices
 of agricultural and sideline products.  Although agricultural and sideline
 product prices have increased very little in the past 2 years, the propor-
 tion of increased and negotiated prices is growing bigger and bigger and the
 actual purchase price for agricultural and sideline products is still rising
 steadily.  Generally speaking, to solve this question we must have a stable
 policy and readjust measures that exceed the limit of policy and those that
 are drastically irrational.  We must refer to the method used by Zhejiang
 and other places of fixing the basic figures for planned purchase and .
 apportioned purchase of agricultural and sideline products by the state;
 places that had abandoned this method should restore it.  By now, 3 years
 have passed for some new producing areas; next year they should think about
 fixing a rational purchasing task or the purchase proportion.  The increased
 and negotiated prices for purchase exceeding the planned quota should also
 be readjusted and controlled.
 2.  The granting of bonuses should be controlled.  In general they should be
 stabilized at last year's level within the scope of provinces, municipalities
 and autonomous regions this year with emphasis on doing away with egali-
 tarianism in bonus-granting and on distribution according to work so as to
 make the bonuses work effectively.   Indiscriminate granting of bonuses
 should be firmly corrected.
 3.  Efforts should be made to tighten financial discipline, intensify super-
 vision and inspection and plug loopholes.  At present, many enterprises have
 indiscriminately assigned production cost, evaded tax and rationed profits-
 which ought to be delivered to the state. All this has reached a fairly
 serious degree.  We must pay attention to this and solve it.  The financial
 inspection carried out early this year which achieved good results should
 be continued.  Problems once discovered should be dealt with expeditiously;
 we should not turn big problems into small ones and small problems into no
 problem at all.
 4.   Investment in capital construction must be controlled. While there is
 no possible major breakthrough in capital construction, an expenditure item
 under plan, the amount of funds raised on one's own, the funds the enter-
 prises themselves have and the fixed capital investments made with bank
 loans have grown into a considerably large sum.  There are many problems in
 this also.  Various provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions should
 check on them. For those projects that should go on, we should study how
 to put the funds to good use.  Another problem is that some places have set
 up their own investment trust companies taking away bank deposits to do con-
 struction.                         To summarize, the amount of money available is limited and
 establishing an investment trust company here would mean reducing bank
 deposits there.  This in fact amounts to diverting a part of the credit
 originally being used as current capital to capital construction, thus
 extending the capital construction line and hampering the improvement of
 economic results.  I now reiterate that with the exception of those invest-
 ment trust companies approved by the State Council or designated departments
 concerned, all other investment trust companies should'be turned over to the
 banks.  The job of raising and using funds should be handled exclusively by
 the banks and should not be done independently without them.

 In short, our entire economic situation has come out of the "bottom of the
 pot," but the latent danger has not yet been basically eliminated.  We rather
 assess the problem more seriously; we should never lower our guard or become
 unrealistically optimistic.
 V.  On the Question of Intensifying Ideopolitical Work
 Under the new situation, ideopolitical work should not be weakened but
 intensified.  Over the years, our political organs have been busy launching
 mass movements but they still lack an integrated set of experiences in doing
 ideopolitical work well in the economic sphere.  We should make an effort to
 study and summarize experience in this area.   Ideopolitical work should be
 based on the demands of the four modernizations and integrated with economic
 work and with the state of the mind of workers and staff in order to have a
 definite object in view to truly solve problems.  In discussing how to
 intensify ideopolitical work, this conference has introduced the Daqing
 oilfield's experience of strengthening the building of contingents of work-
 ers and staff and the experience of the Tianjin caustic soda plant in carry-
 ing out education on the love of the party, the motherland.and socialism
 through studying history and Chinese modern history.  All this is more vivid,
 more realistic and convincing.  We must, through meticulous and careful
 ideopolitical work, make the fundamental guiding principles of taking equal
 consideration of the interests of the state, the collectives and individuals
 and.of "first, the people must have sufficient food; second, socialist con-
 struction must be carried out," take root in the minds of workers and staff
 and in work implementation as well.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, the party
 and government have made maximum efforts in improving the people's liveli-
 hood in the rural areas and cities and the great majority of the masses are
 satisfied.  The state of mind of the people in the cities at present is
 stable and upward looking on the whole.  It should also be noted that a
 small number of people in the cities are still not too satisfied and are
 grumbling.  Among them there are also elements with ulterior motives who
 desire to stir up trouble.  It seems that there is a necessity for choosing
 a suitable time this year to universally carry out a vivid education on the
 economic situation.  We should, through this education, reckon an overall
 account with the urban people and let the broad masses understand under what
 conditions the state solved the question of the people's livelihood since
 the downfall of the "gang of four," especially in the past several years
 since the third plenary session.  The account would cover the increase in
 commodity prices, people's income, state subsidies to the urban people,
 employment, in the total amount of wages and bonuses, in housing for work-
 ers and staff, in the sale of durable consumer goods, and in urban savings
 deposits.  All accounts should be brought into the open.   The country has
 an account book.  In the 3 years from 1979 to 1981, jobs were found for
 26 million jobless young people who returned to the cities and towns;
 housing covering 220 million square meters in floorspace was newly completed
 for workers, staff and the people in the cities.  The state increased sub-
 sidies of the selling price of agricultural and sideline products annually
 to more than 20 billion yuan.  The total amount of wages for workers and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 staff in 1981 was 25.1 billion yuan greater than in 1978 or an increase of
 44 percent; the average annual wages of workers and staff increased from
 614 yuan in 1978 to 772 yuan in 1981 or an increase of 25.7 percent and so
 forth.  Every city, every enterprise and every unit has such an account book
 and we should speak up with facts and figures.  We must also make clear the
 existing problems in the spirit of seeking truth from facts.  For example,
 for some party and government cadres, personnel engaged in scientific
 research, teachers and workers and staff of collective enterprises, their
 actual income has not been raised much and has even dropped.  We should let
 the masses voice their opinion openly so as to help us carry out education
 about this situation and improve our work.  Judging from results of educa-
 tion conducted in Shanghai, Liaoning and Xuzhou, in so doing, most of the
 people have come to. know the truth and eliminate misunderstanding; they have
 realized that the party and the state have indeed made utmost efforts in the
 interests of the.people.  By reckoning accounts, workers and staff of the
 Shanghai No 2 weaving plant who used to grumble about their livelihood prob-
 lems have become even-tempered and good-humored and vigorous in work.  A
 party branch secretary of the Ningbo municipal clothing embroidery factory
 made some most profound and objective remarks.  She said:  According to the
 workers, over the past several years, they have found:  1) they have more
 money in their pockets; 2) commodity prices have also risen; 3) they still
 have more money in their pocket after carefully figuring out income and
 expenditures; 4) the young people have higher demands.  The masses of workers
 are very reasonable.  So long as we earnestly carry out education on the
 economic situation, a healthy atmosphere will prevail more promisingly and
 there will be no room for rumors and slanders.
 We should, through education on the economic situation, further lead the
 people to fully understand our national conditions and to foster the idea of
 building our country through thrift and hard work and of arduous struggle.
 Ours is a developing socialist country with a huge population, a weak founda-
 tion and a very burdensome construction task in all fields.  Livelihood
 improvement can only be materialized gradually with the development of pro-
 duction.  It is therefore wrong and unachievable to put forth impractical
 and excessive demands.  As to livelihood problems, we should not simply
 compare with the developed capitalist countries, nor should we compare with
 those oil-rich countries or certain countries and regions which have become
 prosperous by relying on processing.  We have to go through a protracted
 hard struggle in order to build our great motherland into a more prosperous
 and strong country and to make all our people "comparatively well-off" for a
 more prosperous life later.  This requires us to earnestly implement the
 principle of "first, the people must have sufficient food; second, socialist
 construction must be carried out."  The people's livelihood needs to be
 improved gradually, but there is also a problem of doing things according to
 one's own capability.  We still have to allocate some funds, goods and mate-
 rials for construction and for continuously enlarging reproduction in order
 to advance toward the four modernizations.  This is where the fundamental
 interests of the people of the whole country lie.  A prosperous life will
 never become a reality if we only strive for enjoyment of life and divide up
 and eat up everything instead of carrying out construction.  We must, through
 education, make the people correctly understand and handle well the relations

 between construction and livelihood and between accumulation and consumption
 and integrate the immediate with long-term interests.
 We are deeply convinced that by striking at lawbreaking and criminal activ-
 ities in the economic sphere and promoting the building of spiritual civili-
 zation together with education on the economic situation this year, the
 people's spirit will be greatly enhanced and the social mood will take a
 turn for the better.

 BE A CLEAR-HEADED, STAUNCH AND PROMISING MARXIST
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 11-14
 [Article by Editorial Department]
 [Text]  We are going through a historical stage of great changes and develop-
 ment, from chaos to order and from poverty to abundance.  The task of the
 party during this stage is to lead our 1 billion people to gradually build up
 the country into a modernized, highly democratic and highly civilized social-
 ist power.  Faced with this new situation and new task, party members and
 cadres, especially high- and middle-level leading cadres, must strive to
 become clear-headed, staunch and promising Marxists.
 In order to be staunch and promising, one must first of all be clear-headed.
 As a Marxist, in order to be clear-headed, the most fundamental question is
 to have a farsighted and comprehensive view and accurate analysis and assess-
 ment of the present situation.
 In the more than 5 years since the smashing of the "gang of four," espe-
 cially since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, our
 party has reestablished the Marxist ideological, political and organizational
 line; formulated a series of principles and policies for socialist moderniza-
 tion that are suited to our country's national conditions; adopted many
 effective measures to improve the party's work style, enforce party dis-
 cipline and restore the party's fine traditions; completed the task of
 bringing order out of chaos in guiding ideology; and made tremendous achieve-
 ments in practical work.  Our party and country have thus passed through the
 crisis caused by the decade of disorder of the "Great Cultural Revolution"
 and embarked again on the road to prosperity.  This is the mainstream of the
 present situation and is a basic fact that no one can write off.  If we take
 a wavering attitude or have doubts in this assessment of the present situa-
 tion or if we take the nonessentials of the present situation for the essen-
 tials, we will commit grave mistakes.  Does this mean, however, that other
 than war, there are no major dangers to our party, our country and our
 socialist cause and that we can sit back and relax?  Of course not.  Dangers
 exist even in time of peace.
 Lawbreaking criminal activities in the economic field are now much more
 widespread than they were during the movements against the "three antis and

 the five antis" 30 years ago.  Corrupted by capitalist ideas, some party
 members and cadres and even party organizations have degenerated.  Of course,
 this phenomenon is only relatively more outstanding in a small number of
 localities and among a small number of cadres.  It is only a countercurrent
 in the constant advancement of our party and country.  If the whole party
 unifies ..ts understanding and action and is united in waging an unremitting
 struggle, this countercurrent will certainly be overcome.  However, if the
 whole party does not pay sufficient attention to this countercurrent and
 does not wage a resolute struggle against it, this countercurrent will
 undoubtedly exert a serious corrosive influence on the ranks of our party,
 undermine our social values and destroy the cause of socialist moderniza-
 tion.  This clearly shows that other than war, there are dangers that will
 cause the decline of our party and country.  We must have a clear-headed
 understanding of this important question which concerns the future and
 destiny of the party and country.
 What do these dangers. stem from?  It goes without saying that we must main-
 tain vigilance against the aggression and subversion of imperialists and
 social imperialists.  Neither must we lower our guard against the activities
 of the remnants of the counterrevolutionary cliques headed by Lin Biao and
 Jiang Qing.  But we should be even more aware that fortresses are most vul-
 nerable to attacks from within.                    Our party is the vanguard of the working
 class.  As long as the body of our party is healthy, maintains the purity of
 communism and is always linked with the people, no enemy forces will be able
 to defeat it.  In this sense, the main danger lies within the party itself
 and in the possible moral degeneration of wavering members.
 As to the party itself, the key is held by its high- and middle-level lead-
 ers, its principal leading cadres.  In the article "The Role of the Chinese
 Communist Party in the National War" written in 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong
 said, "So far as shouldering the main responsibility of leadership is con-
 cerned, our party's fighting capacity will be much greater and our task of
 defeating Japanese imperialism will be more quickly accomplished if there
 are 100 or 200 comrades with a grasp of Marxism-Leninism which is systematic
 and not fragmentary, genuine and not hollow."  This passage correctly and
 clearly states the position and role of leading cadres with a good grasp of
 Marxism in the revolutionary cause.  In leading a population of 1 billion
 people toward socialist modernization, our party now needs 10,000 or 20,000
 such Marxists instead of 100 or 200.  If our leading cadres at high and
 middle levels are clear-headed Marxists, are staunch Marxists and are
 promising Marxists, the party will be built better and its fighting capacity
 will be greatly increased.  Thus, our party will be able to correct all
 mistakes and overcome the phenomenon of corruption.
 At present, we are faced with a fierce struggle between the corrosive influ-
 ence of capitalist ideas and the resistance of socialist ideas to this
 influence.   Viewed from what has already been exposed, a relatively serious
 tendency of bourgeois liberalization has emerged in many areas of China's
 social life.  Decadent capitalist ideas and ways of life have exerted a
 rather serious corrosive influence on the ranks of the Communist Party and
 are rather seriously poisoning the general mood of society.  Indeed, many

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 party members and cadres have been roped in within a very short period.  Some
 old cadres who were not conquered by the enemy's force of arms or the sup-
 pression of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques have
 been conquered by the bourgeois "sugar-coated bullets" in the past few years
 and have become captives of the bourgeoisie.  That capitalist ideas have
 intruded into the militant Communist Party is a fact that brooks no neglect.
 Facts have clearly shown that bourgeois liberalization is not just a ques-
 tion of the cultural and ideological fronts but is a common question facing
 all fronts.  On the economic front, phenomena such as smuggling, selling
 contraband, offering and accepting bribes, corruption, theft, speculation,
 swindling and appropriating large quantities of state property are not iso-
 lated or accidental occurrences.  They are outstanding expressions of
 bourgeois liberalization under new historical conditions, that is, at a time
 when an open-door policy and a policy to enliven the domestic economy are
 being implemented.  They are also an important manifestation of class
 struggle under socialist conditions.  These facts have proved that under the
 new historical conditions, if we do not strengthen ideological and political
 work, do not establish and perfect corresponding management systems, do not
 adopt effective management measures and do not wage a struggle to resist the
 corrosive influence of capitalist ideas, we will not be able to smoothly
 carry out modernization.  In the face of the serious corrosive influence of,
 decadent capitalist ideas and ways of life, we must have the understanding
 that the present struggle against the corrosive influence of capitalist ideas
 and bourgeois liberalization, including the struggle to hit out at crimes in
 the economic field, is a protracted struggle that concerns the success or
 failure of China's socialist modernization and the prosperity or decline of
 the Communist Party and the country.  The whole party must attach great
 importance to this struggle.
 However, we must not forget historical experiences and lessons.  Although
 the question of corrosive influence of capitalist ideas and bourgeois
 liberalization is rather outstanding at present, it is not after all the
 principal contradiction in our country.  The principal contradiction in
 China is the contradiction between the people's growing material and cul-
 tural needs and the backward social production.  This contradiction must be
 resolved by means of socialist modernization.  The political line formulated
 at the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee is precisely to
 unite the people of all nationalities throughout the country to gradually
 build our country into a modernized, highly democratic and highly civilized
 socialist power.   This is a Marxist line.   It reflects the common desire and
 demand of the people of all nationalities throughout the country and repre-
 sents the greatest interests of the masses of people.  We must resolutely
 implement this line.  The reason why we wage the struggle against the
 corrosive influence of capitalist ideas and bourgeois liberalization is also
 precisely to promote a fundamental change for the better of the party's work
 style, the people's practices and social order, to eliminate all interfer-
 ences and obstacles in implementing the party's political line and to ensure
 smooth progress in our efforts to achieve socialist modernization.  There-
 fore, if we want to be staunch Marxists, we must first firmly adhere to the
 line.  We must not obscure the orientation of our advancement, must not
 shift the focus of our work and must not repeat the mistake of "taking class
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 struggle as the key link."  For over 20 years after the socialist transforma-
 tion of the private ownership of the means of production had basically been
 completed, we did not shift the focus of our work to socialist construction.
 We thus regarded class struggle as the principal contradiction and committed
 the mistake of magnifying class struggle, causing the country and the people
 to suffer a lot.  We should not do such foolish things again. In his report
 "The Present Situation and Tasks" given on 16 January 1980, Comrade Deng
 Xiaoping said:  "Starting from the new year of the first year of the 1980's,
 we must 'not waste even one single day.  We must concentrate all our atten-
 tion on building the four modernizations."  "Unless a large-scale war breaks
 out, we must be determined to persist on doing this.  Everything should center
 round it and it should not be interfered in any way.  Even if a large-scale
 war breaks out, we must continue to do it or begin our efforts again after
 the war is over.  Our whole party and all the people must set this as the
 high aim and lofty aspiration.  We must grasp it firmly, be more 'stubborn'
 and not be irresolute."  We must always bear these words in mind.
 Some people attribute the emergence of capitalist corruption and bourgeois
 liberalization to the party's open-door policy and the policy to enliven the
 domestic economy.   This is totally wrong.  We must make it explicit that  .
 such policies are firm and unshakable and introduced in accordance with the
 needs of our socialist modernization and with the international situation.
 It is of great strategic significance to implement such policies because our
 country is a big country which has a vast population, a poor foundation to
 start with and a relatively backward economy.  In order to change this back-
 ward situation, we must make breakthroughs and learn the skills to manage
 the domestic economy and devglgp economic relations with foreign countries.
 We must devise a path of socialist construction which suits actual Chinese
 conditions and must never again take the old road which adopted a closed-
 door policy toward foreign nations and rigid management of the domestic
 economy.  These correct policies of an open-door policy and policy to
 enliven the domestic policy will still be enforced even after our economy
 is developed.  We should realize that there are numerous factors accounting
 for notable criminal activities in the economic field in some areas.  For
 instance, there are still remnants of the ancient society and ideological
 influences of the exploiting class in our country; the pernicious influence
 of anarchism and extreme individualism which had been instigated by the Lin
 Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques during the 10 years of
 disorder is far from being eliminated; while implementing the open-door
 policy and the policy to enliven the domestic economy, we have not been able
 'to keep pace with the ideological and political work and with some necessary
 systems and measures of management, with the result that the influence of
 decadent capitalist ideas and the bourgeois way of life has multiplied, and
 so on.  These are very important reasons.  How can we attribute the rampancy
 of illegal and criminal activities in the economic field to the implementa-
 tion of the open-door policy and the policy to enliven the domestic economy?
 Our party has drawn a clear demarcation line regarding these policies.  The
 criminal activities in the economic field have nothing to do with these
 policies.  In view of our party's principles, all these evil deeds have
 always been considered as illegal and are impermissible under party dis-
 cipline and state law.  All practices under the pretexts of being "special

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 and flexible" which distort such policies and which are divorced from the
 socialist orientation, divorced from the communist stand and are contrary
 to party spirit and the party's principles, can only sabotage such policies.
 What we should do now is to sum up past experiences, carry forward the
 achievements obtained, overcome shortcomings and correctly and healthily
 implement the policies which have been formulated.  We absolutely should not
 change the policies.  Regarding this question, we must not waver in the
 least extent.
 The revolutionary history of our. country has shown that both the question
 of upholding the proletarian stand and maintaining the party's communist
 purity and the question of taking precautions against and opposing class
 capitulationism exist whenever we make contact with the bourgeoisie.  Chen
 Duxiu's class capitulationism was manifested during the period of the great
 revolution.  Wang Ming's class capitulationism was manifested in the early
 years of the war of resistance against Japan.  In the early years since the
 founding of the country, it was perfectly correct and extremely necessary
 for us to cooperate with the national bourgeoisie.  It also proved to be a
 complete success.  However, some of our party members and cadres were hit by
 the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie despite Comrade Mao Zedong's
 warnings released on the eve of the liberation to the whole party against
 the attack of the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets."  We are in a poorer
 situation at present compared to the situation then.  Such circumstances are
 unavoidable in the new historical era.  We must not lose our confidence in
 the party's policies because of the launching of the anticorruption struggle;
 similarly, we must not neglect, or slacken our efforts or be afraid to whole-
 heartedly launch the anticorruption struggle because we want to uphold and
 implement the party's policies.  All our party members and cadres, and par-
 ticularly the high- and middle-level party cadres, must have a firm prole-
 tarian stand, bear in mind the party's fundamental aim of wholeheartedly
 serving the people, bear in mind the party's ultimate goal of realizing the
 communist ideals, bear in mind the party members' vocation of maintaining
 the party's communist purity, and must always guide our actions with the
 communist ideological system during this struggle.
 The present period we are in is a historical period of great significance,
 and also one in which there is plenty of scope for our talents.  We should
 not be satisfied in being mediocre, decrepit and muddleheaded, but try our
 best to become useful and promising people.  At present, the most important
 thing for us to do is to combine political steadfastness with scientific
 foresight, proceed from the higher plane of strategic ideology, shore our-
 selves us, be bold and resolute in our work, and try our best to create in
 the next few years a really new situation in various fields of our construc-
 tion, including the development of our economic relations with foreign coun-
 tries.   In order to fulfill these targets, we must uphold the four basic
 principles, correctly carry out the line, guiding principles and policies of
 the party, go deep into the reality of life, strengthen investigations and
 studies, repeatedly study the new situations and solve new problems.  We must
 master two skills:  the skill of managing construction at home and that of
 developing our economic relations with foreign countries.  We must carry out
 our work in two ways:  developing the material civilization and improving the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 spiritual civilization, while correctly understanding and handling the rela-
 tionship between the two civilizations.  We must carry out reform and
 readjustment to eliminate the irrationality and shortcomings existing in the
 production relations and in the superstructure, resolutely carry out the
 streamlining of administrative organs and reform the cadre system with revo-
 lutionary spirit.  We must regard opposition to the bourgeois liberaliza-
 tion tendency as an important part of party building and of consolidating
 political power for a certain period in the future, and attach importance to
 it.  On,.the other hand, we must unswervingly carry on the struggle to seri-
 ously crack down on illegal and criminal activities in the economic field.
 We must fix our attention on and seriously and speedily handle those severely
 illegal and criminal activities, such as smuggling and selling contraband,
 bribery, corruption and theft, speculation and swindling, appropriating
 state and collective properties, and so on.  We must punish those cadres who
 engage in serious crimes, especially those who are occupying important posts,
 and should never hesitate in taking actions against them, and not appease or
 shield them.  With this struggle, we not only can resolutely stop unhealthy
 tendencies in the economic field, but also give the vast number of party
 members and cadres a profound Marxist education on party character, party
 work style and party discipline.
 If we recall our party's militant course over the last 60-odd years, we can
 see that our proletarian revolutionaries of the old generation headed by
 Comrade Mao Zedong and others never failed to put forth to the whole party
 the task of strengthening studies whenever the revolution arrived at a turn-
 ing point.  Now, as the vast number of party members and cadres are to make
 themselves clear-headed, staunch and promising Marxists, they have to
 strengthen their studies in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  Some
 articles written by Comrade Mao Zedong during the period of the anti-
 Japanese war, such as "The Situation and Tasks in the Anti-Japanese War
 After the Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan," "Introducing the Communist,"
 "Preface and Postscript to Rural Surveys," and so on are especially worth
 being reviewed.  Although all of them were aimed at the concrete circum-
 stances of the time, and our situation today is quite different from the
 historical conditions then, the basic standpoint, points of view and methods
 embodied in these articles remain very educational to us.  All of our party
 members and party cadres, in particular leading cadres at middle and high
 levels, have to study anew and solidly master Comrade Mao Zedong's theory and
 tactics of the dual nature of the united front which promoted unification
 along with struggle.  Under all circumstances we must resolutely safeguard
 our purity as communists, and we are not allowed to lower our ideological
 understanding and political consciousness as communists.  All communists
 should never be corroded by the bourgeoisie.  Under the new historical con-
 ditions, we must creatively apply this magnificent thought to developing our
 economic relations with foreign countries, to carrying out the policy of
 enlivening the domestic economy and all fields of social life, so as to over-
 come the tendency of bourgeois liberalization, to resolutely resist and
 oppose the corrosion of capitalist ideas.  Thus, we will be able to stand
 invincibly and be unremitting in our advance toward winning new victories.

 READJUST THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, IMPROVE ECONOMIC RESULTS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 15-19
 [Special commentary by Bai Rubing [4101 1172 0393]]
 [Text]  How to accelerate the development of agricultural production, improve
 the commodity turnover rate and improve economic results is a problem of
 strategic importance which should be solved in readjusting the agricultural
 structure of Shandong Province.  Here I would like to discuss some of our
 methods and theories for readjusting agricultural structure.
 I.  Rationally Readjust the Overall Crop Pattern Under the Guidance of State
 Planning
 To readjust the agricultural structure, it is first necessary to satisfac-
 torily handle the proportional relations between grain on the one hand and
 cotton and edible oil on the other hand.  Since liberation, Shandong
 Province's agricultural production has developed considerably.  Calculated
 in terms of 1970 prices, the total agricultural.output value increased from
 3.28 billion yuan in the early days after the founding of the PRC to 11.35
 billion yuan in 1978, an increase of 2.5 times.  However, owing to the
 "leftist" influence, the agricultural structure has been irrational and the
 economic results of agricultural production have been very poor over a long
 period of time.  In the 22 years  between 1956 and 1978, the average per
 capita income from distribution of the commune members throughout the
 province increased by only 16.5 yuan, an average annual increase of 0.75
 yuan, of which the average per capita income from distribution of one-fourth
 of the basic accounting units was below 40 yuan.  Particularly between 1959
 and 1978, the four relatively poor prefectures of Heze, Liaocheng, Dezhou
 and Huimin consumed 11.07 billion jin of state marketing grain, spent 628
 million yuan of relief funds and owed the state 517 million yuan in loans.
 Thus the problem of providing adequate food and clothing to commune members
 has remained unsolved for long years.
 In the past, one of the important reasons for the poor economic results of
 our province's agriculture was that the ratio and distribution for grain and
 industrial crops, such as cotton and peanuts, were irrational.   The climate
 and soil of Shandong Province are relatively suitable for the growth of
 multifarious crops.  Historically, it had a tradition of growing grain,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 cotton, peanuts, soybeans and flue-cured tobacco.  While getting a good grip
 on grain production, vigorously developing such industrial crops as cotton
 and peanuts is not only the strong point of the province's agriculture but
 also the needs of the state and the people's livelihood.  However, owing to
 the quite serious one-sidedness in the guiding ideology in our agricultural
 production, in agriculture, exclusive stress would be put on grain at,the
 expense of industrial crops.  Of the 40 million mu of farmland of the four
 prefectures in northwestern Shandong Province, 10 million mu of farmland is
 saline-alkali soil.  The per mu yield of grain on such soil is 200 or 300
 jin, the low yield being no more than 100 jin.  If it is sown with cotton
 and things go well, every mu of such farmland will yield about 100 jin of
 ginned cotton and the income from it is largely equal to 300 percent of that
 from sowing grain crops.  But, in the past, one-sided emphasis was put on
 the practice of "taking grain as the key link," the minimum acreage under
 cotton totaled only over 3.8 million mu, over 5.6 million mu less than the
 1956 figure.  In Jiaodong and central and southern Shandong Province there
 are several tens of millions of mu of sandy land which is suitable for grow-
 ing peanuts.                Previously, an area of 9 million mu of land was sown with
 peanuts.  But later the minimum acreage under peanuts was reduced to over
 3 million mu.  As the result of the failure to bring the strong points into
 play,  this subjective practice ended up with the production avenues becoming
 narrower and narrower.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, we have
 implemented a series of the CCP Central Committee's principles and policies
 concerning agricultural matters.  While enthusiastically introducing various
 forms of the production responsibility system, in the light of the province's
 actual conditions, we have readjusted overall crop pattern to ways suitable
 to local conditions and have achieved remarkable successes.  Over the past
 3 years, the average annual increase in the total agricultural output value
 of the province has been 7.3 percent; that in grain, 0.3 percent; that in
 cotton, 63.3 percent; that in peanuts, 13.9 percent; the yearly increase in
 the income from the diversified economy has been 22 percent; and that in the
 income of the commune members from collective distribution, 19 yuan.  Thus
 the income in 1 year equals that of over 20 years.  To develop industrial
 crops, we have adopted the following measures:  1) We have earnestly carried
 out the state's regulations concerning the readjustment of prices for the
 agricultural and sideline products and aroused the enthusiasm of the peasants
 for growing such industrial crops as cotton and peanuts.  2) In 1979, we
 began practicing "linking the purchase and marketing of grain with that of
 cotton," ensuring the grain ration for cotton growers, raising the standards
 for selling chemical fertilizers and grain as rewards to the cotton growers
 and encouraging the cotton-producing areas to grow more cotton.  3) In the
 concentrated cotton-producing areas, the principle of "ensuring cotton with
 grain and promoting grain with cotton" and that of "simultaneously grasping
 grain and cotton, with the stress on cotton" has been practiced.  4) We have
 summed up and spread, in real earnest, the typical experiences in effecting
 the double good harvest of grain and cotton and that of grain and edible oil
 and popularized such fine varieties as "Lumian No 1."  5) We have appro-
 priately expanded the acreage under such industrial crops as cotton and
 peanuts, turned a considerable amount of saline-alkali land which is

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 unsuitable for growing grain crops into land sown with cotton and turned por-
 tions of hilly areas into land sown with peanuts, and the greater part of
 the newly reclaimed "three wastelands" (sandy land, farmland running to weeds
 and alkaline land) have been sown with cotton and peanuts.  Over the past 3
 years, the acreage under such industrial crops as cotton and peanuts has been
 expanded by more than 7 million mu.  The strong point of the northwestern
 areas of Shandong Province--cotton--and the strong points of the Liaodong
 peninsula and the central and southern areas of the province--peanuts, flue-
 cured tobacco and others have been brought into fuller play.  The total out-
 put of cotton in 1981 was 13.5 million dan, 10.41 million dan more than the
 figure in 1978 or an increase of 337 percent and that of peanuts in 1981,
 27.78 million dan, 9 million dan more than the 1978 figure or an increase of
 47.9 percent.  The ratio of the output value of industrial crops all over the
 province to the total output value of the planting industry increased from
 15.7 percent in 1978 to 27.6 percent in last year.  The commodity turnover
 rate of agricultural and sideline products has increased year after year.
 The commodity turnover rate for grain between 1978 and 1981 increased from
 13.6 percent to 14.5 percent; that for cotton, from 87.4 percent to 95 per-
 cent; that for peanuts, from 57.3 percent to 60.2 percent; and that for flue-
 cured tobacco, from 95.7 percent to 97 percent.  At present, the needs of the
 province for cotton, edible oil and tobacco have been ensured and, moreover;
 cotton, edible oil and tobacco can still be exported to earn funds to support
 state construction.  In the fiscal year 1980, a net amount of 180 million jin
 of edible oil and of 960,000 dan of flue-cured tobacco was exported, an
 increase of 80 percent and 27 percent over that in 1978 respectively; and
 1.36 million dan of cotton was.imported from other provinces in fiscal year
 1979, but in fiscal year 1980, 4.95 million dan of cotton was exported and in
 fiscal year 1981, 7.7 million dan was expected to be exported.
 After the expansion of acreage under cotton. and oil-bearing crops and the
 reduction in acreage under grain crops, will grain output fall?  This is a
 question which quite a few comrades worry about.  The results of practice
 show that grain output has increased rather than dropped.  Grain, cotton and
 edible oil have promoted one another.  Along with the development of indus-
 trial crops, the income of collective, communes and individual commune
 members has increased by a big margin, thus providing more funds for expand-
 ing reproduction and also large amounts for purchasing cottonseed-based
 fertilizer, peanuts and soybeans.  This has played an important role in
 restoring and developing soil fertility and ensuring an increase in grain
 production.  In the past, the four prefectures in northwestern Shandong
 Province concentrated on grain alone and, as. a result, cotton production
 was not promoted and grain output was both.low and unstable.  Over the past
 few years, acreage under cotton has been expanded in line with specific
 local conditions and, as a result, cotton output has doubled and redoubled
 and grain output has also increased satisfactorily.  Despite a reduction of
 nearly 2 million mu of farmland under grain in 1981, grain output registered
 an increase of 1.65 billion jin and cotton output registered an increase of
 more than 2.7 million dan over those in 1980.  The masses say:  "Particular
 attention has been paid to both gold (grain) and silver (cotton) and life
 has-thus become increasingly more gratifying."

 However, the acreage under industrial crops must not. be expanded blindly.
 After the prices for agricultural and sideline products were raised, the
 peasants vied with one another in growing more industrial crops such as
 cotton and peanuts.  Some concentrated grain-producing areas also reduced
 the farmland under grain crops and expanded the farmland for growing cotton,
 peanuts and tobacco and thus emerged the contradiction that industrial crops
 and grain are vying with each other in competing for farmland.  In order to
 solve this problem, we have paid attention to the following things:
 1) Priority must be given to planned economy in agricultural production.
 Full play must be given to the strong points of every province and locality
 on the one hand, and agricultural production must subject itself to state
 plans and the needs of the people's livelihood on the other.  We must not
 indiscriminately grow whatever crops promise more income.  Seen from the
 conditions of the province, the present acreage under industrial crops
 constitutes 25.63 percent of the total area of cultivated land.  The propor-
 tions of the acreage under grain, cotton and oil-bearing crops are already
 largely rational.  The acreage under industrial crops must not, in general,
 be expanded any more on a large scale.  Shandong Province has a population
 of more than 73 million, and the area of farmland sown to grain crops must
 be kept at a level of over 70 million mu, averaging 1 mu of farmland sown
 to grain crops per capita.  Before there is a breakthrough in agricultural
 science and technology, without maintaining so much farmland for growing
 grain crops, it will be difficult to be self-sufficient in grain.  2) Assum-
 ing full responsibility for grain purchase, marketing and allocation under
 a contract has been practiced.  In order to ensure the decisionmaking power
 of the units at lower levels in planting and to enable them to uphold state
 planning and guidance, we have clearly pointed out that, under the premise
 of being self-sufficient in grain, the concentrated cotton-producing areas
 are allowed to go all out to develop cotton production; under the condition
 of ensuring the fulfillment of grain purchase tasks and ensuring the grain
 ration of the commune members, the concentrated grain-producing areas are
 allowed to appropriately develop industrial crops.  Assuming full responsi-
 bility for grain purchase, marketing and allocation under contracts between
 the province and prefectures, between the prefectures and counties, and
 between the counties and communes and their subdivisions has been widely
 practiced.  The contracts will not be changed once they are fixed.- 3) It is
 necessary to reform the cropping system, make farming scientific and inten-
 sive, and constantly increase the yield of each unit area.  Special stress
 should be put on doing a good job in intercropping and interplanting grain
 and cotton and grain and oil-bearing crops and improving the multicrop
 index.   Last year, Wenshang County intercropped and interplanted wheat and
 cotton on 70,000 mu of farmland, resulting in an average per mu yield of
 310 jin of wheat and 130 jin of ginned cotton.  Calculated in terms of the
 acreage under practical cultivation,  the per mu yield of wheat was equal to
 1,033 jin, an increase of 470 jin compared with the output resulting from
 the method of single-cropping wheat; the per mu yield of ginned cotton was
 equal to 185 jin, 57 jin more than the output resulting from the method of
 single-cropping cotton.  The potential for intercropping and interplanting
 grain, cotton and oil-bearing crops is enormous.   In the future attention
 must be paid to promoting the intercropping and interplanting grain, cotton
 and oil-bearing crops.

 II.  Gradually Shift the Focus of Readjustment to the Overall Development of
 Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations and Fishery
 Grain, cotton and edible oil constitute an important part of agriculture
 but are far from the whole of agriculture.  Only when agriculture, forestry,
 animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fishery are developed in an over-
 all manner, can agricultural production be put on a foundation of ecological
 balance, and a benign cycle ensured and reliable conditions created for
 steady increases in grain, cotton. and edible oil production.  For a long
 period of time, we have not had a profound understanding of the dialectical
 relationships among agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occu-
 pations and fishery, and more often than not regarded agriculture as the
 "principal occupation" and forestry, animal husbandry and fishery as "side-
 line occupations."  This one-sided argument has bound us hand and foot and
 obstructed the development of forestry,, animal husbandry and fishery.
 Practice has given us an increasingly clear understanding of the fact that
 forestry and animal husbandry occupy an extremely important position and
 play a unique role in ensuring a benign cycle in agriculture.  Afforestation
 can conserve headwaters as well as water and soil, prevent wind and fix sand,
 and regulate climate.  Rainfall in areas covered with forest in the province
 is 15 to 20 percent more than that in areas without forest, and water reten-
 tion in the former is 20 to 30 percent more than in the latter.  After a  .
 forest net was established in 95 percent of the farmland of Yanzhou County,
 wind speed within the forest net was reduced on the average by 38 percent,
 air humidity increased by 6 percent and annual evaporation decreased by
 375 mm.  Developed animal husbandry can provide large quantities of organic
 fertilizers, ameliorate the soil, improve soil fertility, promote planting,
 and promote fulfillment of the target of "more livestock, more fertilizer
 and more grain."  The high-quality barnyard manure provided annually by
 .Rongcheng County's animal husbandry is equal to 100 million jin of compound
 chemical fertilizer.  According. to calculations, 36 percent of the nitrogen
 content, 56 percent of the phosphorus content and all the potassium content
 of the soil of this county at present are derived from applied barnyard
 manure.
 Over the past years, we have consistently deepened our understanding of
 developing forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, adopted some measures and
 attained relatively satisfactory successes.  However, last year's output
 value of forestry, animal husbandry and fishery amounted to only 14.4 per-
 cent of the total agricultural output value, of which the output value of
 forestry accounted for 1.1 percent; that of animal husbandry, 11.2 percent;
 and that of fishery, 2.1 percent.  This shows that the province's structure
 of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery is still quite
 irrational.  This state of affairs requires that we further emancipate our
 minds, broaden our horizons, and effect an upswing in the production of
 forestry, animal husbandry and fishery as quickly as possible while paying
 close attention to the production of grain, cotton and edible oil.
 Shandong Province has quite rich favorable natural conditions and enormous
 potential for developing forestry, animal husbandry and fishery.  Apart from
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 110 million mu of cultivated land, the province has 56 million mu of barren
 hill land, beach wasteland and parcels of land scattered around villages,
 at both: roadsides and along riverbanks, lands which are suitable for
 forestry and animal husbandry and are equal to half of the area of the
 existing cultivated land.  The province has over 3,000 kilometers of coast-
 line and more than 3 million mu of shallow sea and sandy soil which are
 available for breeding but only one-tenth of which has been utilized; it
 has over 4 million mu of freshwater composed of reservoirs, lakes, streams
 and ponds as well as river courses which are available for breeding and the
 greater part of which has not been utilized.  The initial plans of the
 province in this respect is that a good foundation for the production of
 forestry is to be laid down within 3 years and all land suitable for forestry
 is to be planted with trees within 5 or 7 years, both in mountainous areas
 and hills as well as on plains.  In the production of animal husbandry, while
 ensuring the steady increase in pigs, it is necessary to substantially
 develop plant-eating animals, such as cows, sheep, rabbits and geese.  In the
 production of fishery, while appropriately controlling the gathering of fish
 and improving the quality of fish products, it is necessary to lay stress on
 seawater and freshwater breeding.
 Judged from the conditions of the province, to speed up the development of
 forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, first, the leadership at various
 levels must raise their understanding, help the vast numbers of cadres and
 masses realize the important economic and social significance of grasping
 forestry, animal husbandry and fishery through various ways and means, put
 forestry, animal husbandry and fishery in the same important position as
 agriculture and grasp well forestry, animal husbandry and fishery as we have
 done with grain, cotton and edible oil.  Second, the party's policies must be
 implemented.  It is necessary to assign the barren hills, beach wasteland
 and all land suitable for planting trees to the production teams and
 peasant households under contracts as quickly as possible, and in addition
 assign part of the barren hills to the commune members for their sideline
 production.  In animal husbandry, while upholding public livestock breeding,
 it is necessary to formulate and implement the relevant policies and vigor-
 ously encourage the peasant households to engage in livestock breeding.
 The main problem at present is that the level of pig breeding is decreasing.
 This has come about as a result of the fact that after the introduction of
 the production responsibility system, many communes and their subdivisions
 abolished some past effective regulations concerning pig breeding and, as a
 result, the enthusiasm of the masses was dampened.  We are restoring, accord-
 ing to different specific conditions, the regulations concerning land for
 growing fodder, fodder rations, workpoints for collected manure, and the
 measure of 1 jin of pork for 1 jin of grain and so on, regulations which are
 aimed at encouraging commune members to breed more pigs.  The units intro-
 ducing the system of fixing output quotas for individual households and that
 of assigning land to each household in exchange for fixed levies are prac-
 ticing the assigned purchase of pigs and have signed contracts related to
 this.  Third, attention must be paid to the use of science.  In paying close
 attention to the science and technology of forestry, special stress should
 be put on doing a good job in the breeding of fine varieties, the prevention
 and cure of plant diseases and the elimination of pests, and in the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 popularization of the already proven scientific and technological results.
 Take apples for example.  The per mu yield of apples in the province is
 1,000 jin, with the maximum per mu yield being 2,000 or 3,000 jin and the
 minimum per mu yield being 400 or 500 jin.  With the spread of some common
 techniques for increasing production, the total apple output will increase
 from the present 2.4 billion jin to 3 billion jin.  Fourth, it is imperative
 to grasp management.  The key to grasping management lies in widely estab-
 lishing and perfecting the production responsibility system in forestry,
 animal husbandry and fishery, doing a proper job of business accounting, and
 trying hard to reduce costs and improve economic results.
 III.  Take the Road of Comprehensive Operations Combining Agriculture,
 Industry and Commerce
 To modernize agriculture and help the peasants to become prosperous as soon
 as possible, it is necessary to step out of the narrow scope of operation
 where efforts are concentrated on agriculture alone without paying attention
 to processing and commerce, to take the road of comprehensive operations
 combining agriculture, industry and commerce, and to improve the commodity
 turnover rate for agricultural and sideline products.  Most of the raw mate-
 rials of light industry in cities come from the countryside, which consti-
 tutes the main market for processed commodities.  Therefore, doing a good
 job in locally processing agricultural and sideline products (including the
 semiprocessing of raw materials for light industry) will lessen the pressure
 on transportation and eliminate stockpiling, and economize on the time and
 expenses needed to transport materials and to help the peasants double and
 even triple their income by providing other ways than solely depending on
 the income from supplying raw materials.  It must still. be realized that the
 so-called rational agricultural economic structure must be an economic
 structure under which labor power is rationally distributed and time for
 labor is sparingly used.  Shandong Province has a population of more than
 73 million, of which 66 million are peasants.  Along with the universal
 adoption of the production responsibility system and the constant improve-
 ment in agricultural mechanization, the surplus labor in the countryside
 will grow and grow.  By developing commune- and brigade-run enterprises and
 carrying out a diversified economy in a big way, we will be able to fully
 utilize the labor resources of the countryside.  This will not only provide
 more commodities and boost the income of peasants, but also be of far-
 reaching significance to the building of small cities and towns and to the
 lessening of the differences between city and countryside, between industry
 and agriculture.  The labor power poured into industry, sideline occupations
 and the diversified economy last year by Yantai Prefecture constituted
 54.8 percent of the total agricultural labor power; the income from industry,
 sideline occupations and the diversified economy made up 60.3 percent of the
 total agricultural revenue, and the average income of every commune member
 from collective distribution was 206 yuan.  Looking at the province as a
 whole, the production brigades whose average per capita distribution is above
 400 to 500 yuan are exclusively, apart from the solely fishing teams and
 cotton-growing teams, brigades whose industrial and sideline production and
 diversified economy constitute a considerably large proportion of their
 economy.

 Shandong Province has quite rich resources for engaging in the processing of
 agricultural and sideline products, and the commune- and brigade-run enter-
 prises'have broad prospects.  Last year the province produced over 13 million
 dan of cotton, of which a considerable part of the cottonseed could not be
 shelled and extracted into oil, and oil extraction alone produced an income
 of over 60 million yuan.  The province has an annual yield of over 3 million
 tons of cotton firewood, those of which were used in processing totaled only
 20,000 tons, comprising no more than 1 percent.  The total output of fresh
 and dried fruit in the province is over 3 billion jin, of which the defec-
 tive and substandard fruit which should be processed annually is about 400
 million jin, but at present only about 4 million jin can be processed,
 accounting for 1 percent.  The potential for processing straw articles and
 wickerworks is fairly large.  The annual yield of corn husks which can be
 used for straw weaving is 300 million jin, of which only 100 million jin
 has been utilized; of the more than 57'million jin of wheat stalks, only
 over 10 million jin has been utilized; and of the more than 90 million of
 reeds, only 15 million jin has been utilized.  Of the 4.7 million pieces of
 goat skins purchased by the province, only 290,000 pieces have been processed;
 of the purchased 170,000 pieces of cowhide, only 60,000 pieces have been
 processed; and of the 23 million pieces of other furs, only 5 million pieces
 have been processed.  It can thus be seen that there are bright prospects for
 the vigorous development of the processing of agricultural and sideline
 products.  If'things are done well in this respect, it will bring about
 enormous economic results.  For instance, processing sweet potatoes into
 starch will increase income from this produce by 80 percent and further
 processing of it into vermicilli will boost income from it by another 55
 percent.  The province has an annual yield of about 50 billion jin of sweet
 potatoes, and if 5 percent of this yield is processed into vermicilli, an
 additional more than 200 million yuan can be obtained.
 To develop the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products, it
 is imperative to study and find solutions to the problems of relevant poli-
 cies and structures, gradually bring the industry into line with state plan-
 ning, and provide it with support and assistance in materials, funds and
 technical force.  Besides first fulfilling the needs of the processing of
 state enterprises, the communes and their subdivisions should be organized in
 a big way to process those agricultural and sideline products which are
 suitable for local processing.  Regarding some processing of agricultural and
 sideline products, the practice of establishing joint operations between the
 state on the one hand and the communes and their subdivisions on the other is
 encouraged.  This practice will not only be conducive to finding a solution to
 the problem of being insufficient in processing capacity and to improving
 product quality and economic results, but also to resolving the contradic-
 tion of collective and state enterprises competing with each other for raw
 materials and tasks.   It is necessary to provide reinforced planning and
 guidance and to make overall plans and rational arrangements for the
 processing orientation and processing quotas of a locality or a unit by
 taking all factors into account and to guard against blindness.
 With the development of agricultural production, and particularly the develop-
 ment of industrial crops and a diversified economy, the existing commercial

 channels have more and more seriously failed to meet the needs of rural
 commodity circulation.  At present, there exists the widespread phenomenon
 of "it is difficult to buy what we want to buy, and difficult to sell what
 we want to sell" in the rural areas.  Some agricultural and sideline
 products are stockpiled in one place and are out of stock in another place.
 Not to reform the existing rural commercial structure will seriously inter-
 fere with agricultural production and the development of the entire agri-
 cultural economy.  Apart from grasping well the experiment of the structural
 reform of supply and marketing cooperatives, to develop rural collective
 commerce, it is still necessary to develop brigade-run commerce in an active
 and orderly way, to turn the purchasing and marketing agencies of the supply
 and marketing cooperatives into collective commerce in which the brigade is
 taken as the basic accounting unit and assumes full responsibility for its
 own profits and losses, and to set up production and marketing service com-
 panies in charge of the commune's diversified economy and of organizing
 production, purchasing raw materials, promoting the sale of products,
 importing improved varieties from other places, directing and popularizing
 new technology and signing contracts on behalf of the collective and the
 commune members.
 Readjusting the agricultural structure and improving economic results is an
 extensive and profound change in the rural economy.  In the course of this
 change, we will constantly encounter some ideological obstacles, and some
 new conditions and new problems will crop up.  This requires the party com-
 mittees at various levels to provide more effective and practical leader-
 ship, to forcefully conduct ideological and political work, and to lead the
 peasants in persevering on the socialist road.  Seen from the present situa-
 tion, in carrying out ideological and political work in the rural areas,
 efforts should be concentrated on the following matters:  It is necessary to
 correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective and the
 individual, and earnestly give simultaneous consideration to the interests
 of the three parties and not concentrate on one aspect alone.  It is neces-
 sary to correctly handle the relationship between state planning and guidance
 on the one hand and respecting the decisionmaking power of production teams
 and peasants on the other.  Both the production teams and peasants must have
 "small freedoms" in planting, operation and handing over to the state or
 selling their products, and at the same' time subject themselves to state
 planning and guidance.  It is necessary to correctly handle the relationship
 between the multifarious sectors, forms and channels of rural commerce and
 the strengthening of market control and to enthusiastically carry out various
 activities of transportation and sale, so as to enliven the market on the
 one hand and to observe the state's policies and decrees, strictly forbid
 smuggling, speculation and profiteering as well as dishonest practices on
 the other.  It is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between
 accumulation and consumption.   Since their income has increased, apart from
 improving the conditions for their livelihood, the peasants are encouraged
 to boost accumulation which is to be used in expanding reproduction.  We
 encourage hard work and frugality and oppose extravagance and waste.  The
 key to doing a good job in ideological and political work in the rural
 areas lies in strengthening the building of the party basic organizations
 and political power.  After the implementation of the production

 responsibility system, the party and government work in some units was
 weakened. This is a problem which warrants close attention and urgently
 requires solution.  It is necessary to give full play to the role of the
 party branch as a fighting bastion and to the exemplary vanguard role of the
 communists, to strengthen the functionary role of the basic political power
 and to guard against separating oneself from collective affairs, and to
 overcome weakness and laxity in leadership.  So long as the work of the
 party basic organizations and political power is strengthened and done
 successfully, the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the healthy
 progress of all rural work will be ensured of developing on a sound basis.

 MR LI DINGMING AND THE IDEA OF BETTER TROOPS AND SIMPLER ADMINISTRATION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No T, 1 Apr 82 p 19
 [Historical note by Huang Zheng [7806 1513]]
 [Text]  During the anti-Japanese war, our party launched a large-scale
 campaign for better troops and simpler administration throughout the
 liberated areas in accordance with the suggestion put forth by.Mr Li Dingming,
 a patriotic personage in northern Shaanxi.  In his article "Serve the People"
 of September 1944, Comrade Mao Zedong said:  "The idea of 'better troops and
 simpler administration' was put forth by Mr Li Dingming, who is not a com-
 munist.  He made a good suggestion which is of benefit to the people, and we
 have adopted it."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 3, p 954)
 Li Dingming, born in Mizhi County, northern Shaanxi, in 1880, was a Hanlin
 Academy degree holder of the Qing dynasty and served as section chief in the
 government of Yulin Prefecture.  He also had been a middle school teacher
 and a-primary school principal in Yulin, Shaanxi Province.  After that, he
 earned his living by practicing medicine and farming in his native place.
 After the establishment of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia revolutionary base area,
 he acted as the head of the Finance Committee of Mizhi County and was elected
 as the chairman of the county's Consultative Council in 1941. On 7 November
 1941, he was elected vice chairman of the Consultative Council of the
 Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region at its second session.  On 20 November
 of the same year, he was also elected vice chairman of the border regional
 government.  Mr Li Dingming held the CCP in great regard.  While working with
 CCP members, he made efforts to closely coordinate. and cooperate with them.
 He also enjoyed high prestige in the border region.
 It was at the beginning of November 1941, when he attended the second session
 of the Consultative Council of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region that
 Mr Li Dingming put forth his suggestion for better troops and simpler admin-
 istration in order to improve the situation in the administrative organs of
 the border region that was not appropriate to the state of the war at that
 time.  He said:  "At a time when the people are undergoing hardships and the
 natural resources are in short supply, if we do not want to restrict military
 and administrative development owing to economic exhaustion, and if we do not
 want to harm our economic lifeline as a result of our military and adminis-
 trative development, the government should make overall plans for the economy

 and apply the principle of better troops and simpler administration.  It
 should keep its expenditures within the limits of income and draw up a
 budget so as to maintain a good balance."  "Militarily, we should make our
 troops better and intensify their combat strength in line with the principle
 of every man being able to fight and help to win battles.  We should avoid
 having the old and weak in the armed forces just to maintain a certain
 number..  Meanwhile, the government should practice simple administration
 and streamline its organs.  It should pursue a policy of limited staff with
 high efficiency and proficiency in order to avoid the existence of unwieldy
 organs with redundant staff and the waste of manpower and financial
 resources."  On 18 November, the session passed Mr Li's proposal by a
 majority of 165 votes, and it was to be "submitted to the government for
 immediate action."  In its declaration., the session formally proclaimed that
 "the government must practice simple administration and streamline its
 organs."  In accordance with the opinion of the Consultative Council of the
 Border Region, the government made a decision to act accordingly and at the
 first government administrative meeting, it set up a special committee for
 this purpose.
 Comrade Mao Zedong attached great importance to the suggestion made by Mr Li
 Dingming.  He underlined in red the essential paragraphs and jotted them in
 his notebook with this comment:  "This is a good method, which serves as an
 effective cure for our red tape, bureaucratism and formalism."  At the
 beginning of December 1941, the CCP Central Committee decided to popularize
 this method adopted in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.  It issued
 the instruction for "better troops and simpler administration" to all anti-
 Japanese base areas, calling for overhauling organizations at all levels,
 streamlining organs, strengthening grassroots units, enhancing efficiency
 and practicing economy in manpower and materials.  Following that,.the CCP
 Central Committee issued some further instructions and decisions on the
 issue of making troops better and simplifying administration.  Yanan's
 JIEFANG RIBAO repeatedly published editorials and sponsored discussion
 meetings on this subject.
 When he was vice chairman of the border regional government, Mr Li Dingming
 earnestly carried out all the instructions issued by the CCP Central Com-
 mittee.  At that time, he was already over 60, and though in poor health,
 he was still very resolute in his work.  In his inaugural address, Mr Li
 Dingming said in all sincerity:  "After having read and studied some differ-
 ent books about socialism, I have come to understand that socialism is the
 only doctrine which is absolutely fair.  In the world today, all countries
 are bound to follow the road of socialism.  Now, China is besieged by a
 formidable enemy and is short of natural resources.  There are numerous
 difficulties in pursuing socialism.  Nevertheless, at this juncture of life
 and-death, we must endeavor to carry forward socialism."  Through three
 streamlinings, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region achieved great suc-
 cesses in its work.   In his report "Summary of Streamlining the Border
 Regional Government" at the fourth meeting of the border regional government
 on 7 January 1944, Mr Li Dingming pointed out:   "The border regional govern-
 ment has merged and reduced its internal offices by one-fourth.  The organs
 directly under the government have been reduced from 35 to 22.  The number

 of their staff has been cut down from 469 to 279.  The counties in the
 border region have also been greatly restructured. We have attained our
 goals in five aspects--streamlining, unifying, promoting efficiency,
 practicing economy and combating bureaucratism."
 The streamlining carried out in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and
 other anti-Japanese base areas played an important role in overcoming the
 severe economic difficulties at'that time, continuing the protracted war
 and winning final victory in the anti-Japanese war.  We should never forget
 the important contribution made by Mr Li Dingming in this respect.

 IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UPHOLD THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MARX' THEORY OF
 REPRODUCTION--PART THREE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 20-25
 [Article by Deng Liqun [6772 0550 5028]]
 [Text]  III.  Giving Priority to the Growth of the Production of the Means
 of Production Is the General Law of Expanded Reproduction
 As we mentioned before, during the period of readjustment, it is inevitable
 for heavy industry to grow a little bit slowly or even not to grow tempo-
 rarily.                    But can we conclude that the growth rate of heavy industry should
 always be lower than the growth rate of light industry and the proportion of
 heavy industry output value should always be smaller than that of the light
 industry output value?  Should we take this as a policy to be adopted in our
 long-term planning?  Some comrades hold this view.  I deem that this view is
 inadmissible and we will make big mistakes if we accept this view.  The
 comrades holding this view do not distinguish provisional measures from
 long-term policies and do not understand that, generally speaking, during
 the period of readjusting the economy, heavy industry should develop a little
 bit slowly while the production of light industrial products in short supply
 should grow faster, for it will be impossible to implement the policy of
 readjustment if we do not do our best to look after the industrial depart-
 ments producing products in short supply, especially when energy supplies are
 limited.  Yet while elaborating long-term plans, we still must uphold the
 principle of giving priority to the growth of the production of the means
 of production.   Giving up this principle will result in the prolonged back-
 wardness of heavy industry, stagnation of our light industry, agriculture and
 even of heavy industry itself (especially transportation and the energy
 industry) because of a lack of an increasingly perfected technology and
 equipment, and because of the permanent strain on our raw material and
 energy supplies, and thus give rise to very great adverse effects on the
 development of the national economy.  Therefore, although we are temporarily
 reducing the proportion of heavy industry, we should not regard this as a
 long-term policy.   In the long run, it is still necessary to increase the
 proportion of heavy industry gradually and appropriately.   Even during the
 period of readjustment, energy and transportation are still regarded as key
 sectors when we arrange capital construction.  This is indispensable for
 ensuring smooth expanded reproduction.  This is all the more so in the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 process of industrialization, during which machines are to replace manual
 labor in production.
 Not long ago, some comrades from theoretical circles put forward the formal
 proposition that we should build our society into an industrialized society
 with a light industrial structure.  We adopted this proposal while drafting
 a document in April 1979 pursuant to the Central Committee's instructions.
 The document has not been completed and this proposal has consequently been
 given up.  We might enquire into this proposal while conducting research.
 But taking this as a policy to be implemented deserves much debate.  We want
 to substantially develop the production of consumer goods for daily use, and
 especially the production of consumer durables, so as to increase the sup-
 plies of these products continuously.  But if there is insufficient energy,
 no new types of materials, and no modern technology and equipment, it will be
 impossible to produce consumer goods in such a way that the growing demands
 of the broad masses, both quantitatively and qualitatively, can be met.  It
 is impossible to carry out modern construction without giving priority to
 the growth of the production of the means of production.  There is no doubt
 that we must grasp light industry.  We have not done enough in this regard
 and we still have to make great efforts to boost light industry.  But we
 ought to be more far-sighted.  That is the very reason why we should study
 economic principles and far-reaching policies.  We still must uphold the
 principle of giving priority to the growth of the production of the means
 of production.  In other words, the growth of heavy industry still must take
 priority.  In the past, Comrade Mao Zedong always said that heavy industry
 should be the center of our economic construction, and he did not deny this
 even when talking about arranging the national economy according to the order
 of agriculture, light industry and heavy industry.  Here the point is to have
 a clear idea of the direction in which heavy industry should render its
 services.  In 1979, pointing to the metallurgical departments' blindness in
 respect to both output and quality, Comrade Chen Yun proposed that the
 metallurgical industry change its service orientation.  He cited housing in
 the countryside as an example.  Peasants were having difficulty in erecting
 houses for lack of timber in the countryside.  The metallurgical departments
 could have produced some metal parts and supplied them to the countryside.
 This applies not only to the metallurgical departments, but also to all other
 heavy industry departments, which should orientate their services correctly,
 always bear in mind the needs of developing agriculture and light industry
 and the needs of the people's livelihood, and serve agriculture, light indus-
 try, the market and the people's livelihood.  At the same time, they should
 bear in mind the needs of national defense.  In addition, they should heed
 the demand of the international market so as to increase exports and help
 develop the domestic economy.  In the past, we exported more semifinished
 products, such as tungsten ore, than finished products and even had to
 import many finished products, such as tungsten filaments, and thus suffered
 great losses.  Heavy industry now has the task of readjusting its service
 orientation and should consider what to do in the light of the needs of
 agriculture, light industry, the market, the people's livelihood and exports.
 Meanwhile, the internal structure, or the internal proportionate relations
 of heavy industry, should be streamlined so that heavy industry can adapt
 itself to the readjustment of its service orientation.  In the past 30 years,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 we have laid down quite a sizable foundation for construction, building up
 fixed industrial assets amounting to over 410 billion yuan and erecting
 over 400,000 industrial and communications enterprises.  Now a very urgent
 and important task is to carry out, step by step, technological transforma-
 tion on the foundation of modernization that we have built.
 If we fail to carry out gradual technological transformation, the equipment
 in these enterprises will become more backward in a few years, and still
 less will they be modernized.  If heavy industry's service orientation is
 correct, and plans and restructuring are carried out according to this
 orientation, there will be ample scope for it to play its role, its output
 value can be raised, its proportion can be increased, and its position and
 role in the national economy will become more important.
 We propose that now, and for quite a long period in the future, on the
 industrial side, the development of the production of the means of consump-
 tion should occupy an important place.  We should first ensure fulfilling
 the needs of developing industries producing consumer goods whether in
 respect to energy and material supplies, investment and allocation of
 credits, arrangement for the use of scientific and technological forces, and
 selection of research topics, or in respect to the introduction of technology
 and equipment from abroad.  Does this contradict the principle of giving
 priority to the growth of the production of the means of production?  There
 is no contradiction as long as the departments producing the means of pro-
 duction follow the correct service orientation, because the production of
 consumer goods cannot develop without the supplies of the means of produc-
 tion, or to put it the other way around, only if the production of the
 means of production grows first, will it be possible to meet, promptly and
 sufficiently, the needs of the departments producing the means of consump-
 tion in respect to machinery, equipment and newly discovered industrial
 raw materials.
 Some comrades refute the principle of giving priority to the growth of the
 means of production from the viewpoint of policy while some refute it from
 the viewpoint of theory.  The arguments of the latter are, in summary:
 According to one argument, this principle is theoretically unsound; accord-
 ing to another argument, it plays its role only under certain historical
 conditions and is therefore not a universal law.
 Why is this principle theoretically unsound?  The following arguments
 deserve to be brought up for discussion.
 First, giving priority to the growth of the means of production is not Marx'
 viewpoint and Marx' opinion.  Giving priority to the growth of the means of
 production is not the condition for expanded reproduction in the capitalist
 society.  What are the facts?  Marx in fact did not make such a generaliza-
 tion.           It is Lenin who did so.        But Lenin entirely followed Marx' theory
 when making this generalization.  While interpreting Marx' theory concerning
 the condition for realizing expanded reproduction, Lenin included techno-
 logical progress in the formula, made a detailed analysis by means of charts,
 and then concluded:  "Thus, we have seen that the production of the means of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 production which manufacture the means of production grows fastest, then
 follows the production of the means of production manufacturing the means
 of consumption, the production of the means of consumption grows most slowly.
 Even without the study that Marx made in his 'Das Kapital,' volume two, it
 would be possible to come to the above conclusion by referring to the law
 according to which constant capital tends to grow faster than variable capi-
 tal, because the statement that the means of production grow fastest is
 merely another way of saying that this law applies to the total social
 product."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 1, p 7)  Under the capitalist
 system, technological progress and replacement of manual labor by machines
 find expression in a high growth rate of constant capital in comparison with
 variable capital.  So whether Lenin is right in including technological
 progress (constant capital grows faster than variable capital) in his analysis
 depends on whether what "has been included" represents Marx' viewpoint.  Who-
 ever has read "Das Kapital," volume one, knows that in the chapter "The
 Process of Capital Accumulation," Marx demonstrated by detailed discussion
 that under the capitalist system, technological progress finds expression in
 the downward tendency of the ratio between variable capital and constant
 capital.  As a matter of fact, Marx expressed this opinion on many occasions.
 For instance, in "The Theory of Surplus Value" he said:  "With the develop-
 ment of capitalist production, the part of capital invested in machinery and.
 raw material grows while the part of capital spent on wages decreases.  This
 is an. irrefutable fact."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 26,
 p 402)  All this proves that the argument that Lenin's generalization is not
 Marx' viewpoint is without foundation.
 Second, technological progress can also be achieved through economizing on
 means of production and, under this condition, technological progress will
 not find expression in the downward tendency of the ratio between variable
 capital and constant capital; according to the same argument, what has just
 been said is not covered by the analysis of Marx and Lenin.  But, as a matter
 of fact, while analyzing the reproduction of capital in a society, Marx and
 Lenin never neglected to consider that more advanced and more perfect tech-
 nology and equipment would replace backward ones.  We know that while
 analyzing simple reproduction in "Das Kapital," volume two, chapter three,
 Marx expounded on how the two kinds of constant capital were replaced,
 including the replacement of value and physical replacement, which, besides,
 should correspond to one another; he also expounded on how additional con-
 stant capital was derived while analyzing expanded reproduction.  As he said
 .in the above-mentioned chapter, for replacement and addition alike "most of
 the means of production undergoes continuous renovation as a result of
 industrial progress.  Therefore, instead of in the original form, replace-
 ment takes place in the form of renovation."  ("Collected Works of Marx and
 Engels," Vol 24, pp 190-191)  That is why he divided expanded reproduction
 into extrinsic expansion and intrinsic expansion.  So-called intrinsic
 expansion means raising the efficiency of the means of production.
 Of course, the point is not what Marx' and Lenin's views were, but whether
 their views are out of date.

 It is true that since the middle of this century, especially since World
 War II, the developed capitalist countries have been increasingly resorting
 to economizing on the means of production for achieving technological
 progress. As a result, the capital component tends to decrease.  For
 instance, in the United States, the ratios between capital and wages for
 the processing industries were:  4.12 in 1909, 3.26 in 1919, 3.67 in 1929,
 3.51 in`1937, 2.49 in 1948, 2.36 in 1953 and 2.45 in 1968.
 Does this mean Marx' principle that with technological progress, the ratio
 between variable capital and constant capital tends to decrease, and that,
 therefore, the argument that the growth of the means of production takes
 priority is no longer valid?  We should admit that under the condition of
 achieving technological progress through economizing on the consumption of
 the means of production, this process, although not as evident as when manual
 labor was being replaced by machines, is still taking place.  Let us make
 some simple analyses.  What has constituted the economies of the means of
 production realized by the industries in the capitalist world in recent
 years?  Lower consumption of raw materials and other material inputs, mainly
 owing to newly discovered raw materials and improvements in technology and
 equipment; lower expenditure on the so-called negative part of fixed assets,
 that is, buildings and projects.  Here, many factors are effective only for
 a short period and will not be able to play a role forever.  As regards the
 so-called positive part of fixed assets (or to cite Marx, "the skeleton
 system and muscle system of production"), the proportion of machinery and
 equipment has been increasing.  Taking the major material production depart-
 ments of the United States as an example, the ratios between their capital
 value and wages were:  1.06 in 1929, 1.1 in 1937, 1.12 in 1940, 1.07 in
 1950, 1.27 in 1958 and 1.27 in 1968.  While demonstrating that "in the
 process of capital accumulation accompanied by capital buildup, variable
 capital decreases relatively," Marx said:   "With the lapse of 'time, one day
 old capital will be renewed from head to foot, will cast off its skin and
 will regenerate in the form of better technology, under which form, a smaller
 amount of labor will suffice for operating a larger quantity of machines and
 raw materials."   ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 23, p 689)  Have
 the facts in the past decades refuted this thesis of Marx' or further
 corroborated it?   Evidently, they have corroborated this thesis.
 Third, the production relations in capitalist society are the condition for
 the law of giving priority to the growth of the means of production to
 operate, and this law ceases to exist under the socialist system.  What
 should be our view of this argument?  Of course, there is an acute contra-
 diction between accumulation and consumption under the capitalist system,
 'where constant capital grows faster than variable capital.  In other words,
 more and more newly formed capital shifts into the production departments
 manufacturing the means of production, even to the extent that the two
 major categories become disproportionate.  This has already become an objec-
 tive law of economic development in capitalist society.   But, just as Lenin
 pointed out, "Replacement by machines of manual labor is not 'absurd' at all,
 on the contrary, this reflects the role of all technological progress made by
 mankind."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 1, p 88)  In "Das Kapital,"
 volume three, chapter two, which was rewritten by Engels according to Marx'

 manuscript, there is a passage which reads:  "Labor productivity rises just
 because: the share of living labor decreases while the share of past labor
 increases; but since the total amount of labor embodied in commodities
 decreases, the decrease in living labor exceeds largely the increase in
 past labor."  However, "as regards capital, the law of raising labor produc-
 tivity does not operate unconditionally.  As regards capital, this kind of
 productivity may be raised not when living labor can be saved in general,
 but only when the economy in paid living labor exceeds what is added to
 past labor."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 25, pp 290, 292)
 A very clearcut distinction has been made:  the decrease in the share of
 living labor and the increase in the share of past labor, and the resulting
 decrease in the total amount of labor contained in products, is a universal
 law which operates in societies with any social and economic structure; the
 feature peculiar to capitalist society is that instead of seeking to econo-
 mize on living labor in general, capital seeks to economize on the part used
 for remuneration of living labor.  Just because of this, under the capitalist
 system, giving priority to the growth of the means of production is related
 to the phenomenon that the production of the means of consumption falls
 behind that of the means of production.  But the production of the means of
 production cannot be separated too far and for a long period from the
 development of the production of the means of consumption.  So when the
 production of the means of production has developed to a certain extent,
 there will be fluctuations and even crises, after which the lost equilibrium
 will be restored.
 Production in a socialist society is, by nature, not for seeking profits but
 for meeting the needs of workers; it does not develop blindly but according
 to plan.  We are absolutely in a position to ensure, by consciously observing
 the law of giving priority to the growth of the means of production, timely
 and sufficient supplies of the means of production to the two major cate-
 gories so as to expand reproduction smoothly, and at the same time to ensure,
 by consciously observing the law of coordinated development of the two major
 categories, a correlative development of the production of the means of
 consumption and the production of the means of production while enhancing
 the development of the production of the means of production.  Opposing the
 aim of production and the planned and proportionate development of produc-
 tion in socialist society to giving priority to the development of the
 production of the means of production, and asserting that giving priority
 .to the development of the production of the means of production will cause
 the two major categories and even the entire national economy to become dis-
 proportionate and will make it impossible for production to meet the workers'
 needs in their material and cultural life, are views which do not have any
 foundation.  For instance, under the capitalist system, a relative population
 surplus, or a huge contingent of jobless people, will inevitably appear in
 the course of capital accumulation, as the capital component increases.   This
 is not only the inevitable consequence of, but also the condition for, pro-
 duction in a capitalist society.  We also want to continuously replace back-
 ward equipment by more advanced equipment.  That is why we must give
 priority to the growth of the production of the means of production and
 would otherwise be unable to realize modernization.  But while determining
 the spheres and steps of the modernizations, we must give due consideration

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 to the employment situation.  In our country, which has a large population
 and an unfavorable starting point, employment is a great issue.  Therefore,
 it is impossible to modernize our country quickly, and for a long period of
 time, manual labor and semimechanized production on the one hand and
 mechanized and automated production on the other hand will coexist.  This is
 not only because it is impossible to accumulate so much capital overnight,
 but also because only in this way can more jobs be created.  Since the 3d
 Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, we have arranged jobs for
 over 26 million people while readjusting the national economy at the same
 time.  Would capitalists have done the same thing?  They definitely would
 not, for their method is to lay off as many people as possible.  It is not
 only out of economic considerations but also out of political considerations
 that we have been doing so, because in this way we can in return secure
 social stability and unity, which are the indispensable conditions for build-
 ing a modernized socialist country.  In order to realize modernization as
 well as to arrange for employment, we must appropriately resolve the con-
 tradiction between the level of employment and the raising of labor produc-
 tivity.
 In the past, our national economy became disproportionate more than once.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, investiga-
 tions and summarization of past experiences have been making it more and
 more clear to everyone that the policies guiding our economic work which
 were of the "leftist" ideological persuasion were the main causes.  Policies
 of the "leftist" ideological persuasion included blindly pursuing high
 targets., biased interpretation of the giving of priority to the growth of
 the production of the means of production, and stressing the development of
 the steel and iron industry alone.  As a result, the two major categories
 became disproportionate.  Misinterpretation of the principle and the prin-
 ciple itself are two totally different matters, which should not be mixed up
 in our discussions.  In the past, things went wrong in this regard, not
 because we upheld the principle of giving priority to the growth of the
 production of the means of production, but, on the contrary, because we
 acted against this principle, because correctly applying this principle
 requires us that we maintain a. harmonious correlation between the two
 major categories.
 Some comrades fail to make this distinction and ascribe the disproportion
 to the principle of giving priority to the growth of the production of the
 means of production, and even say that if this principle is alleged to be
 a law, then it can only be a law disrupting the overall equilibrium and a
 law disrupting the national economy.  Other comrades even say that if we
 had started our industrialization from light industry, we would have accumu-
 lated much more capital and would have avoided the drastic ups and downs in
 our economic development.   Thus, they have brought up an issue to be treated
 very seriously:  Was the policy during our first 5-year plan ultimately
 right or wrong?  As everybody knows, the industrial foundation in old China
 was very weak.  Before the war of resistance against Japan, modern industry
 only represented slightly over 10 percent of the total industrial and
 agricultural output value, while heavy industry represented 23 percent of
 the total industrial output value.  In 1949, steel output was only 158,000

 tons, while most of the machine-building enterprises were small factories
 capable of carrying out repairs only.  Under such circumstances, if economic
 construction had not been centered on heavy industry, it would have been
 impossible to equip light industry and agriculture with comparatively
 advanced technology so as to realize industrialization.  Just because our
 party adopted the correct policy of taking heavy industry as the key sector,
 we were able to quickly establish our own modern machine-building industry,
 power equipment industry, metallurgical industry, mining equipment industry,
 high-alloy steel industry, important nonferrous metals industry and other
 burgeoning industries, and thus remarkably change the backward outlook of
 our industry as well as lay a solid foundation for further developing our
 national economy.  During the first 5-year plan, while ensuring that the
 development of heavy industry remained the first priority, we also succeeded
 in developing light industry and agriculture.  During these 5 years, the
 growth rate of the total industrial and agricultural output value averaged
 10.9 percent per annum with the total heavy industry output value growing
 at an average rate of 25.4 percent per annum, the total agriculture output
 value growing at an average rate of 4.5 percent per annum and the total
 light industry output value growing at an average rate of 12.9 percent per
 annum.  Facts have proved that the policy of giving priority to the develop-
 ment of the production of the means of production implemented during the
 first 5-year plan was correct.  What we need to correct now is the misinter-
 pretations of this policy, instead of the policy itself, which we can by-no
 means give up.
 Let us now discuss whether giving priority to the development of the produc-
 tion of the means of production is a law common to all forms of expanded
 reproduction, or a law which operates only under certain historical condi-
 tions.
 First, as some comrades put it, let us have a look at "real economic life."
 Nobody denies that in the 19th century and in the first few decades of the
 20th century, the production of the means of production took priority in
 capitalist industrial development, and only since the middle of the 20th
 century, especially in the decades after World War II, have the first cate-
 gory and the second category on the whole developed in parallel, with the
 growth rate of the second category exceeding that of the first category
 occasionally.  This means that, as regards the development of capitalism,
 the latter situation has a shorter history than the former one, and that
 even the latter situation needs to be analyzed in detail.   If we take the
 machine-building industry alone, which is the most important production
 department of the means of production, and compare it with light industry
 (the textile, garment, footwear, foodstuffs industries and so on), we see
 that the growth rate of the former has still been higher than that of the
 latter.  From 1955 to 1974, the growth rate of industry in the developed
 capitalist countries averaged 5 percent per annum, with the growth rate of
 the machine-building industry averaging 5.6 percent per annum and that of
 light industry 3.8 percent per annum.  The proportion of the machine-
 building industry in industry as a whole rose to 36.2 percent in 1974 from
 31.3 percent in 1955, while that of light industry declined to 27.7 percent
 in 1974 from 31.5 percent in 1955.  In the United States, from 1955 to 1977,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 the average growth rate of the total national product was 3.2 percent per
 annum, that of industry as a whole was 3.6 percent per annum while the
 average growth rate of the machine-building industry was 5 percent per annum,
 that of the electrical engineering and electronics industries 5.2 percent per
 annum, that of the precision machine-tool industry 6.7 percent per annum;
 the only, exception was the industry manufacturing means of transportation,
 recording a lower-than-average annual growth rate, that is, 3.5 percent.  In
 the case of Japan, between 1951 and 1974, the average growth rate of the
 national product was 9 percent per annum, that of industry as a whole was
 13.7 percent per annum, while the average growth rate of the machine-
 building industry was as high as 19.1 percent per annum.  In West Germany.,
 England and France, the machine-building industry has also grown more or less
 faster than industry as a whole and than the national product.  These figures
 show that we cannot simply deny that in the past few decades priority has
 been given to the growth of the means of production.
 Of course, in addition to machinery and equipment, the machine-building
 industry also produces a part of the consumer goods for daily use.  Yet, even
 taking into account this factor, the above judgment remains valid, because on
 the one hand the machine-building industry mainly produces machinery and
 equipment rather than consumer goods for daily use, and on the other hand,
 the textile industry, which falls under the category of light industry, also
 produces a part of the products used in production.  Based on data published
 in the July 1981 issue of the American periodical "Manual of Basic Economic
 Statistics," some comrades have used the end-products on the market to calcu-
 late the growth rates of the industrial consumer goods and equipment in the
 United States from 1947 to 1980.  The results are:  the consumer goods
 increased by 341 percent while the equipment increased by 489 percent.
 These are very convincing data.
 In the second place, even without making the above detailed analysis, there'
 still remains the problem of how to grasp the relationship between economic'
 laws and economic phenomena.  While speaking of "the law of decreasing
 profitability," Marx said:   "Some reactions will necessarily produce their
 effects to resist and counterbalance the effects of this general law, making
 it a law of tendency.   Therefore, we call the decline in general profitabil-
 ity a downward tendency."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 25,
 p 258)  While analyzing the general tendency of raising the agricultural
 component in the capitalist countries during the 19th century, Lenin also
 said:  "We lay stress on the word 'general,' because both Marx and his
 disciples have always regarded this law as a law of general tendency in the
 .capitalist world rather than a law operating under every particular circum-
 stance."   ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 4, p 93)  No economic laws (in
 fact even no laws in general) exist in isolation without encountering the
 reactions of the factors which obstruct and resist their effects.  Therefore,
 they can only be "laws of general tendency," and "real economic life" can by
 no means always correspond to economic laws without the slightest departure
 from them.  Taking the law of giving priority to the production of the means
 of production as an example, in the past few decades, this law has encoun-
 tered many factors obstructing and resisting its effects in the major
 capitalist countries.  What we mentioned before while talking about the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 changes in the capital component was this factor.  As a matter of fact, there
 are many other factors.  For instance, depreciation of the means of produc-
 tion, increase in staff and workers' nominal wages, development of service
 industries and so forth.  The development of service industries will boost
 the demand for consumer goods on the one hand and does not generate a great
 demand for the means of production on the other hand.  This cannot but be
 reflected by the ratio between the growth rates of the two major categories.
 It is particularly worth pointing out that since World War II, the growth
 rates of the production of minerals and fuels in the major capitalist coun-
 tries have been noticeably lower than the growth rate of industry as a whole.
 Why could this situation exist?  This is because these countries have become
 more dependent on imports for these products.  According to statistics, the
 energy output of the United States in 1950, calculated on the basis of
 standard fuels, was 1,165,060,000 tons while the consumption amounted to
 1,139,880,000 tons.  Output exceeded consumption.  But in 1958, consumption
 started exceeding the output, and in 1975 the consumption amounted to
 2,349,550,000 tons while output was only 2,036,670,000 tons, the difference
 being 312,880,000 tons.  In England, the standard fuels output in 1950 was
 219.88 million tons while consumption amounted to 221.03 million tons.  So
 the difference was not very big.  But in 1975, the consumption rose to
 295.33 million tons while output declined to 183.99 million tons, the dif-
 ference being 111.34 million tons.  The following data well illustrate the
 degrees of dependence on imported minerals and fuels on the part of the
 major capitalist countries.
 The amount of products imported as a percentage of domestic supplies for
 some products in 1975:

 Raw materials and fuels account for a very large share of the means of pro-
 duction.  If this part of the means of production is not produced inside the
 country, this cannot but be reflected in the growth rates of the means of
 production.
 Economic life in a society is always related to political life.  Therefore,
 in addition to economic factors, internal and external political factors
 also affect the effects of economic laws.   This has to be taken into account
 while investigating how economic laws operate.  We will not discuss this
 point here.
 Factors counterbalancing the effects of the law of giving priority to the
 production of the means of production definitely exist in the socialist
 economy.  For instance, although the socialist economy is basically an
 economy which develops according to plan and therefore does not have economic
 crises owing to overproduction as does the capitalist system, the production

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 of the means of consumption and the production of the means of production
 will become seriously disproportionate for various reasons, especially
 because' policies guiding economic work inappropriately and unilaterally
 emphasize the growth of the production of the means of production.  Then,
 it will be necessary, as well as possible, to take the initiative in
 readjusting, suitably slowing the growth rates of the production of the
 means of production and substantially accelerating the development of the
 production of the means of consumption.  Therefore, even under socialist
 conditions, it is impossible to permanently give priority to the production
 of the means of production.
 Many people have enumerated and analyzed the factors which resist and
 obstruct the effects of the law of giving priority to the production of the
 means of production, yet have concluded that this law is not a universal
 law.  This conclusion cannot be approved.  We ought to pay attention to the
 "particular circumstance" arising from the obstruction of and resistance to
 the effects of economic laws.  But this does not permit us to deny the
 existence of economic laws.  If we adopt this method of analyzing problems,
 we may, I am afraid, deny any economic laws.  (End)

 ON GOAL, BASE AND SPEED
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 26-27
 [Article by Jin Wen [6855 3080]]
 [Text]  In reforming society and pushing it forward, the proletariat always
 maintains a clear goal.  Our long-range goal is to realize communism.  And
 our present goal is to build a modernized and powerful socialist country
 with high degree of democracy and civilization.  In order to attain this
 goal, we have to start from the base of actual national strength.  In the
 course of working toward this goal, we have to maintain a certain speed.
 Then, how should we decide on a really suitable speed?  There are two
 methods.  The first is to draw up a plan for capital construction based on a
 "high speed," which would be the product of subjective thinking; and the
 other is to draw a plan based on the present national strength.
 From the statement "The scale of construction must conform with national
 strength" by Comrade Chen Yun, we see that he opposes the former and advo-
 cates the latter.  He said:  "The scale of construction must conform with
 the financial and material resources of the country.  Whether it conforms
 with the latter is the criterion for judging whether the economy is stable.
 In a big country like ours with a population of 600 million, economic
 stability is extremely important.  If the scale of construction is beyond
 the limits which financial and material resources can meet, then it is
 simply a rash advance and it will give rise to economic disorder; if the
 former and the latter are in balance, the economy will remain stable.  Of
 course, it is no good to be so conservative that a reasonable speed of
 construction is not maintained."  Initially, it would seem that it is not
 economic development but "economic stability," and it is not speed but
 "conformity," that was emphasized here.  But actually this is not the case.
 All people who support the socialist cause hope that our country's construc-
 tion can be pushed forward more rapidly.  Their hope is reasonable.  The
 point is that development cannot emerge out of a void, and the speed must
 be subject to the limitations of the base. The reason is that the develop-
 ment of material productive forces is a continuous process.  Marx pointed
 out in a letter to P. V. Annenkov:   "Men are not free arbiters of their
 productive forces--which are the basis of all their history--for every pro-
 ductive force is an acquired force, the product of previous activity.  The
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 productive forces are, therefore, the result of practical human energy; but
 this energy is itself circumscribed by the conditions in which men find
 themselves, by the productive forces already acquired, by the social form
 which exists before they do, which they do not create, which is the product
 of the preceding generation.  Because of the simple fact that every suc-
 ceeding,generation finds itself in possession of the productive forces
 acquired by the preceding generation, which serve as the raw materials for
 new production, a cohesiveness arises in human history, which is the basis
 of man's history."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 4, p 321)
 Similarly, in marching toward the goal of socialist modernization, we cannot
 do without a starting point, but the starting point is not up to us to
 choose.  It can only be the existing base, the existing national strength,
 which mainly means the present productive forces.  How and at what speed
 we approach our goal are not decided by people's will.  Although a social
 movement is a process of material movement with the people's participation,
 and man's subjective initiative is by no means negligible, the social move-
 ment can never be freed from the limitation of national strength.  The
 favorable factors embodied in national strength, at present or in the future,
 are helpful to us in raising the speed of development;.. meanwhile, the
 unfavorable factors will always affect it.
 Economic development, being the growth of material force, must be handled
 with meticulous care.  Only a solid, steady and substantial speed of develop-
 ment with good economic results will be good for our work of approaching the
 goal.  And those "high speeds" with great fluctuations and bad economic
 results will be detrimental to both the country and the people.  They can
 never speed up construction; in fact, they actually slow progress.
 The lessons we have learned over the past years show that one-sidedly pursu-
 ing "high speed" and "high standard" and disregarding the compatibility
 between the construction scale and national strength will inevitably give
 rise to serious imbalances among various sectors of the national economy,
 production of substandard goods, tremendous waste of material resources, an
 upsurge of unhealthy tendencies in the economic field and an upsetting of the
 normal socialist economic order.  In other words, they will bring about
 economic unstability or economic disorder.  A country whose economy cannot
 be developed steadily will never be able to make remarkable and substantial
 progress although it puts both time and effort into this.  Then what is meant
 by stable development?  It means that every step is a substantial move for-
 ward.   The speed, though not so "splendid" on an annual basis, will be
 marvelous in the long term.  That is what we call striving for "stability"
 on the basis of "compatibility," and in turn, striving for development on
 the basis of "stability"; taking the whole situation into account and paying
 attention to real effect.  Therefore, striving for stability can by no means
 be regarded as a rightist practice.
 It is quite obvious that the idea of compatibility between the construction
 scale and national strength does not mean to oppose the demand for raising
 speed.  On the contrary, it should not obstruct the achieving of a "reason-
 able speed."  In his article "The Present Financial and Economic Situation
 and Certain Methods To Overcome Difficulties," Comrade Chen Yun said:   "The
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 basic idea of our work should be:  striving for high speed while being well
 prepared for stagnation.  We should try our best to achieve anything which is
 favorable to the increase of agricultural production.  However, we must be
 aware that we will probably not reach the ideal speed although everything has
 been done.  Therefore, we have to be well prepared for stagnation."  Despite
 the difficulties caused by the "leftist" guiding ideology and rash actions
 at that time, Comrade Chen Yun remained in favor of maintaining a certain
 speed.  "Striving for high speed" means to reach a relatively high speed;
 while being "well prepared for stagnation" means taking into consideration
 the minimum speed which we could reach with our "very best efforts."  Here
 the "stagnation" owing to standing idle is intolerable, and it has nothing
 ,to do with that "stagnation" we mentioned in the idea of being "well prepared
 for stagnation."  Similarly, although today we have suffered much from left-
 ist rash practices in economic construction, we should never go to the other
 extreme and think that it is better to develop the economy as slow as possi-
 ble.
 Starting from and keeping compatible with the national strength is the mate-
 rial prerequisite for us in determining the speed of development..  To do so
 is not a negative but positive act.  However, there is emerging an idea in
 some places that gives no importance to speed in the present period of
 readjustment.  Naturally such an idea leads to slackness and low efficiency.
 It is true that we started the economic readjustment in the beginning of the
 1980's mainly because we had promoted the "high speed" and "high standards"
 in the past under the guidance of the "leftist" thinking which brought about
 a serious imbalance among various sectors of the national economy and
 severely undermined the national economy.  Of course, the economic readjust-
 ment has to clear away the "leftist" guiding ideology, and lower the imprac-
 tical "high speed" and "high standards" to a practical level in actual work.
 Therefore, some units have to be "closed, suspended, merged or shifted."
 What are all these measures for?  They are intended to completely get rid of
 the "high speed" which caused great fluctuations and disregarded economic
 results in the past, and to replace it with a steady speed of development
 which will produce good economic results.  Therefore, readjustment does not
 mean that we do not pay any more attention to the speed of development, but
 that we are to achieve an integration of speed and results, so that we can
 take a firm stand and advance in a better way on a more concrete basis.
 Thus, we will be able to turn the impractical "high speed" into a solid and
 substantial speed.
 Such a speed can be reached and is bound to produce prominent results in the
 period of economic readjustment.  This readjustment will on the one hand
 readjust the proportionate relationships between industry and agriculture,
 between light industry and heavy industry, and between accumulation and con-
 sumption; and on the other hand, readjust product structure, technical struc-
 ture, enterprise structure and organization structure, and rationalize
 economic structure.   If only we can conscientiously carry out these tasks
 the national economy will be able to maintain a certain growth in the
 readjustment which will bring substantially more benefits to the people.  In
 the future, following the successful completion of economic readjustment and
 reform, our country's economic construction will surely achieve higher speed

 on the road of steady progress and healthy development.  However, we should
 never forget the truth that "the scale of construction must conform with
 the national strength."  Only by'doing things in a practical and realistic
 way and making progress in solid steps can we reach real speed on the road
 toward-achieving our goal.

 WHAT IS CREDIT INFLATION, AND IS IT THE SAME AS CURRENCY INFLATION?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 p 28
 [Article by Chen Wenlin [7115 2429 2451] in "Questions and Answers" column]
 [Text]  Answer:  Credit inflation refers to the volume of credit exceeding
 the sources of credit.  In this case, the corresponding supply of goods and
 materials cannot keep pace with the growth of loans.  The function of credit
 is to regulate social funds.  In general, the volume of credits created by
 banks is based on the amount of deposits they have on hand.  For example, if
 loans exceed sources and the state does not control marketable goods and
 materials, credit funds will be used to cover financial deficits or an
 excessive number of long-term construction loans will be made (these loans
 cannot supply marketable products in a short time), and then the phenomenon
 of the supply of money in circulation exceeding the supply of goods and
 materials will arise as a result of the new purchasing power derived from
 these loans.  As a result, commpdity prices rise and money is devaluated.
 Does this mean credit inflation will certainly arise whenever banks make
 loans in excess of the sources of these funds without a guarantee of goods
 and materials?  I do not think so.  In my opinion, only when the volume of
 credit expansion exceeds a certain limit does credit inflation occur.  Last
 year, a basic balance was maintained between revenue and expenditure and
 between inflow and outflow of credit funds in our country.  But there was
 not a complete balance, so the possibility of credit inflation still exists.
 We should never ignore this fact.  In his government work report, Premier
 Zhao Ziyang said:  "We should keep fund raising under control and prevent
 credit inflation.  And the banks' role of accumulating, transferring and
 controlling credit funds must be strengthened."
 Currency inflation refers to an excessive amount of paper money circulating
 in society--exceeding normal needs in commodity exchange and labor payment,
 and followed by devaluation.   One of the inevitable results of inflation is
 a rise in commodity prices.  But not all price rises occur because of infla-
 tion.  China has incurred financial deficits for several years running.  The
 supply of money has grown faster than the demand for money in circulation.
 An excess of banknotes exists in the market.  Commodity prices have risen,
 but only by a small margin, because ours is a planned economy.  1) Purchasing
 prices of grain and other agricultural products are higher than their selling
 prices, and the difference is subsidized by the state.  Thus, prices of
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 people's daily necessities are basically stable and the stability of people's
 livelihood is guaranteed.  2) Generally, there have been no major price rises
 throughout the country, but have been some price increases and decreases.
 The extent of a price rise is limited by the state planning mechanism and
 administrative intervention.  The workers' standard of living might be
 affected by a price rise.  However, their standard of living is not only
 based on the level of prices but also on the level of their wages.  In China,
 owing to adjustment of wages, issuance of bonuses, increase in employment and
 other factors in recent years, the growth of the-per capita wage income of
 workers' families is higher than the growth of commodity prices.
 Since 1979, we have raised the prices of agricultural and sideline products
 in a planned way.  This was done in order to achieve price parity between
 industrial and agricultural products.  It was not prompted by an excess of
 circulating money.  These price adjustments are beneficial to rapidly
 recovering and developing agricultural production and to improving supply to
 urban residents and is of positive significance.  Therefore, while observing
 and determining whether the amount of money circulating in market is reason-
 able, it is unadvisable to only examine the increase and decrease in the
 volume of money supply.  This should be concretely analyzed by linking pro-
 duction with circulation.
 Credit inflation is closely related to currency inflation.  In Western capi-
 talist countries, currency circulation includes two aspects--cash circula-
 tion and noncash settlements.  There are no limits to the settlements of
 capital by account transfer or cash payments.  So, credit inflation and cur-
 rency inflation are, in fact, one and the same.  Currency circulation in
 China only refers to cash circulation, and does not include noncash settle-
 ments.  However, because money is put into circulation through credit pro-
 cedures,  the balance between the amount of cash put into or withdrawn from
 circulation depends on the balance between the inflow and outflow of credit
 funds. On a nationwide level, withdrawal of money from circulation means
 that the credit inflow volume is larger than the credit outflow volume; put-
 ting money into circulation means that the credit outflow volume is larger
 than the credit inflow volume.  The balance of inflow and outflow of credit
 coincides with the balance of inflow and outflow of cash.  In the past,
 owing to the interlocking of finance, credit and cash, capital construction
 pressed for finance and finance pressed for credits, so deficits in credit
 funds were covered by increasing the amount of currency issued.  Under this
 system of fund management, if credit inflation occurs, currency inflation
 will certainly follow.   But credit inflation and currency inflation are two
 different concepts.  On the credit balance sheet, the volume of credits is
 equal to the volume of deposits plus the volume of currency issued.  The
 increase and decrease in the volume of credits reflects the increase and
 decrease in the volume of deposits and the withdrawing and depositing of
 cash.  Therefore, credit inflation might simultaneously take'the forms of
 account transfers and cash payments, while currency inflation generally
 refers to an excessive increase in cash payments.  In order to prevent credit
 inflation, the relationship between credit and currency should be properly
 handled, and the comprehensive balance of finance, credit, materials and
 foreign exchange should be maintained.

 SEVERAL QUESTIONS WHICH CALL FOR ATTENTION IN LITERARY AND ART CREATION AT
 PRESENT
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 29-31, 43
 [Article by Wen Hua [5113 6895]]
 [Text] Socialist literature and art must be improved and developed through
 a continuous process of practice and summing up of experience.  In recent
 years, literary and artistic creation has flourished, bringing about a
 situation that has rarely been seen since the founding of the PRC.  In the
 second half of last year, comrades in literature and art circles began to
 study and implement the spirit of the Central Committee's forum on ques-
 tions on the ideological front, earnestly carrying out criticism and self-
 criticism in a comradely and realistic manner.  In addition to affirming the
 achievements and mainstream of this development in literature and art, on
 the question of overcoming and preventing the mistaken tendencies of bour-
 geois liberalization, they reached a basically unanimous understanding,
 exchanged ideas and strengthened unity, creating conditions that are con-
 ducive to the further flourishing and healthy development of literature and
 art.
 These studies and discussions have played an important role in the develop-
 ment of our country's socialist literature and art.  One of the most out-
 standing results is the fact that we have had to draw a clear distinction
 between right and wrong on certain basic questions of literary and artistic
 creation.
 1.  A number of literature and art works describing social life during the
 "Great Cultural Revolution" have appeared since the smashing of the "gang of
 four."  These works have played a positive role in understanding this
 internal disorder that brought serious calamity to the party, the state and
 the people of all nationalities and in understanding the essence of the Lin
 Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques.  However, an outstanding
 problem that exists in a few of these works is that they are unable to draw
 a clear distinction between, on the one hand, Lin Biao and the "gang of
 four," and on the other hand, the party, the state and the socialist system.
 As a result, objectively they have varying degrees of bad effects on the
 party, the people's regime, and the socialist system.

 It should be noted that, although Lin Biao and the "gang of four" seized a
 considerable amount of the state's and party's power during the "Great
 Cultural Revolution" and invariably waved the banner of the party and social-
 ism to justify their perverse acts, they were in fact a diseased growth on
 the body of the party and the socialist system.  Lin Biao and the "gang of
 four,"along with the serious calamity they brought on the people, were
 certainly not products of the party and the socialist system itself.  On the
 contrary, they were the enemies of the party and socialist system of the
 working class.  While they may have prevailed for a while, in the end they
 did not and could not escape the punishment of history.  Once the victory
 against them had been achieved, it was inevitable that our party and social-
 ist system should move rapidly into a new historical period.  This is the
 true face of Chinese history during and after the "Great Cultural Revolution"
 and is also something that our party, and the people of all nationalities,
 including workers in literature and art, have come to understand through the
 summing up of the experiences of this historical period.  As the "Resolution
 on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the
 PRC" pointed out, "Although we suffered from sabotage by the counterrevolu-
 tionary cliques during the 'Cultural Revolution,' we won out over them in the
 end.  The party, the people's political power, the people's army and Chinese
 society on the whole remained unchanged in nature."  These highly complex
 social and historical phenomena occurred under very special conditions and
 some authors have failed in their efforts at artistic condensation and judg-
 ment, believing that the "Great Cultural Revolution" represented 10 years of
 fascist dictatorship, during which time the state's political power was com-
 pletely in the hands of the "gang of four."  This mistaken understanding has
 meant that their works paint a very dark picture of the social reality during
 that time, giving no hint of either the reactionary nature of the Lin Biao
 and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques or the historical trend which was
 to result in their eventual downfall and offering no insight into either the
 struggle of the party and the people of all nationalities or the inevitability
 of their final victory.   The inability to grasp the true nature of society
 in a correct and comprehensive manner has prevented a small number of authors
 and artists from correctly understanding and expressing the most profound and
 inherent truth of the age that "our people are a great people and that our
 party and socialist system have enormous vitality."  It seems that a summing
 up of both the positive and negative experiences and lessons of literary and
 artistic creation and a deep study and appreciation of the "resolution's"
 scientific analysis of the "Great Cultural Revolution" will contribute sig-
 nificantly to the improvement of artistic and ideological standards in this
 type of creative activity.
 2.  Practice has proved that pursuit of special privileges and bureaucratism
 are, in the entire ranks of revolutionary cadres, only partial and temporary
 phenomena which can certainly be overcome by the forces of the party and the
 people's regime themselves.   In observing life, selecting material, refining
 plots and portraying characters, writers and artists should take a stand
 that conforms to the basic interests of the party and the people.  Moreover,
 through their own creative work they should be able to playa positive role
 in improving party work style and work and in promoting socialist moderniza-
 tion.  However, an important point that needs to be put forward here is that
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 it is essential to clearly distinguish the fundamental differences between
 the old and new social systems and between the party's cadre force and the
 very small number of degenerates and speculators who have worked their way
 into it. The socialist system is incompatible with the phenomena of pursuit
 of special privileges and bureaucratism.  Our cadres are certainly not
 bureaucrats of the old system; they are the people's servants and communists
 who devote their all to the cause of liberating the whole of mankind.  Other-
 wise, there could be no new China in which the people are masters, and there
 could be no victory for socialism in China.  It is absolutely essential to
 mercilessly expose the small number of degenerate elements and speculators.
 However, there is no basis at all for maliciously uglifying and launching
 unbridled attacks on good comrades who have shortcomings or going so far as
 to paint a dark picture of the entire party and cadre rank.  There is a
 school of thought which believes that those within the party have come to
 form a "privileged class"; maintaining that only artists have a "conscience"
 and that politicians have no "conscience."  No matter what an individual
 author's motives may be, any work which is written on the basis of such
 thinking will be basically contrary to historical facts.  Our party and the
 people of all nationalities earnestly hope that writers and artists will be
 able to shift the focus of their creative activities toward the ongoing
 struggle, to build a new life.  To say that this represents a ban or a dis-
 guised ban on any writing dealing with privilege and bureaucratism reflects
 a serious misunderstanding of the situation.  There is still a dark side to
 our life and not a single day passes without the party and the people having
 to struggle against these dark aspects, including privilege and bureaucrat-
 ism.   The task put forward by the Central Committee of struggling against
 corruption is further proof of this.  Two years ago, Comrade Hu Yaobang's
 "speech at the playwright forum" clearly pointed out that "our party has
 already resolved to solve the problems of bureaucratism and privilege and
 is currently adopting measures to this end.  The party dearly hopes that
 comrades in literary and art circles will join us in adopting the correct
 policy, using literary and artistic creation to expose and overcome bureau-
 cratism and privilege seeking."  This is both the sacred right and the
 unshirkable responsibility of socialist artists and writers.  Faced with the
 various problems for which the party and people show concern, our writers
 and artists must not close their eyes to any of the backward, negative and
 ugly phenomena that confront them.  Rather than.remaining silent, they
 should bring the indispensable critical functions of socialist literature and
 art into play in a real and effective manner.  In fact, in all areas of
 artistic creation--novels, films, plays and poetry--there have been a con-
 siderable number of successful works which have had the correct ideological
 viewpoint, shown great artistic creativity and adopted the correct method in
 exposing and opposing all types of unhealthy trends, including privilege-
 seeking and bureaucratism.  The party and the people have, of course, shown
 great interest in and welcomed these works.
 3.  Since the smashing of the "gang of four," we have sharply criticized all
 kinds of expressions of the personality cult in the literature and art field.
 Take the ideological stand of Marxism, for example.  A number of writers and
 artists have used the form of literature and art. to expose the complex,
 multifaceted political and historical causes of "overconcentration'of party

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 power in the individual, and the growth of autocracy in the party and of
 personality cults," to help people to draw the necessary lessons.  This is
 very significant.  But of course, not all works which deal with this subject
 and theme have the correct stand, viewpoint and method, nor do they all
 expressea rigorous creative attitude and a sense of revolutionary responsi-
 bility.  Certain works take a one-sided and vulgar view of the problem and
 use insinuations and satire to describe the proletarian revolutionary
 leaders', especially Comrade Mao Zedong, as symbolizing "monarchical power"
 and "divine rights."  This leads to distortions of history.  "Comrade Mao
 Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist
 and theorist.  It is true that he made gross mistakes during the 'Great
 Cultural Revolution.'  But, if we judge his activities as a whole, his con-
 tributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes.  His merits
 are primary and his errors secondary.  He rendered indelible meritorious
 service in founding and building up our party and the Chinese people's
 Liberation Army, in achieving victory in the cause of liberation of the
 Chinese people, in founding the People's Republic of China and in advancing
 our socialist cause.  He made major contributions to the liberation of the
 oppressed nations of the world and to the progress of mankind."  Every
 writer and artist who seeks to express this solemn and important theme and
 subject should use the "resolution's" scientific and factual assessment of
 Comrade Mao Zedong's historical position as an ideological guide.  Several
 writers have recently tried to sum up lessons and experience in this area
 in the light of their own creative practice.  This has been of enlightening
 significance in the question of how our literary and artistic creation
 should solve the relationship between opposition to personality cults, on
 the one hand, and correct treatment of revolutionary leaders, on the other.
 4.  In the past there was a simple tendency among our creators of literature
 and art to completely ascribe a person's social nature to his class nature.
 This tendency has been criticized and has started to be corrected in practice.
 In recent years bringing order out of chaos on the theoretical level has led
 to the appearance of a group of successful works guided by the Marxist world
 outlook which express concretely the richness and complexity of human
 society.  However, a number of works preaching abstract human nature have
 also appeared.  This is mainly expressed in the following ways:  1) observing
 life and history from the viewpoint of abstract human nature and defining
 the struggle between the masses under the Communist Party's leadership and
 the "gang of four" as a struggle between human nature and antihuman or animal
 nature; 2) making vigorous efforts to seek beautiful human nature in class
 enemies or. reactionaries, blurring the distinction between the enemy and
 ourselves and even making "human nature" and "human feeling" an excuse for
 defection to the enemy, treason and other treacherous acts; 3) preaching that
 abstract human nature is the lever of history and the motive force by which
 mankind can hold together and society can develop; 4) holding that the revo-
 lutionary war and land reform waged under party leadership and even the
 socialist system itself depress and ruin human nature; 5) in theoretical
 circles, confusing a person's nature with his natural properties and abili-
 ties.  As a result of this, people have begun to believe that "writing about
 emotion means writing about love, and writing about love means writing about'
 sex." Such a viewpoint and tendency has, in reality, only opened the way

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 for vulgar works advocating "sexual emancipation" and promising sensual
 excitement. There is an urgent need for further analysis, study and criti-
 cism of such a viewpoint and tendency.
 5.  Serving the masses and socialism is the fundamental orientation of our
 literature and art.  The reason that literary and art creation has been able
 to achieve such outstanding results and to win the support and praise of the
 broad masses of the people in recent years is that, through the accurate
 portrayal of people's lives, this creation has expressed the thinking, the
 emotions, the aspirations and the demands of the people.  Serving the people
 means regarding the people as an entity and as a decisive factor stimulating
 the advance of history, and means serving the people's fundamental interests
 and desires.  Hence we certainly cannot separate serving the people from
 party leadership and the socialist system, nor can we set them against each
 other.  However, certain literature and art workers claim to be the people's
 spokesmen on the one hand and adopt a posture of opposing "the politics of
 government" and "official politics" on the other.  There are others who
 announce that they will stand on the side of the people whenever any con-
 flict emerges between the party and the people.  However, it can be said with
 certainty that any attempts to drive a wedge between the party and the
 people or any attempt by the so-called representatives of the people to
 deviate from the party and the socialist system will inevitably come to
 naught.  We can also say with certainty that the people have no need for such
 representatives.  The ideological sentiments expressed in the works of those
 writers who profess to "stand resolutely on the side of the people" are
 invariably those of individualism and anarchism.  The people openly decided
 long ago whether such ideological sentiments are beneficial or damaging.
 There are also some writers who regard "box-office value" as the sole
 criterion for judging whether the masses are being served well or badly.  In
 fact they are just catering to and satisfying vulgar and backward emotions
 and interests not yet overcome by a part of the masses.  This is quite differ-
 ent from truly serving the people.  Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out 40 years
 ago that, "undertakings which truly serve the masses of people are now cer-
 tainly under the leadership of the proletariat."  History has borne witness
 to the truthfulness of this judgment. Only those writers and artists who
 uphold the four basic principles will ever become true representatives of the
 people's interests and will ever be able to create good works that suit the
 basic interests of the broad masses of the people.
 6.  In literature and art creation, reflecting the essence of life should be
 the meaning of the task "writing about the truth."  So-called artistic truth,
 however, does not refer to the simple copying of the phenomena of life, but
 to using living artistic images to expose the inherent connections and
 objective trends that exist in and. between objects.  In literature and art
 theory and practice, some people set "writing about truth" against "writing
 about the essence" and confuse "writing about the essence" with embellishing
 life and advocating "hiding the truth and deceiving people."  This both vio-
 lates the Marxist theory of cognition and also belittles and twists the
 truth of literature and art.  Just as the affirmation of simple facts cannot
 be termed "truth," the naturalistic portrayal of the daily phenomena of life
 cannot be called "artistic truth."  Artistic truth should be the reproduction

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 of the teal essence of life.  The most essential things, however, are always
 concealed by the superficial phenomena of daily life.  Therefore, in order to
 achieve artistic truth one must explore and uncover the details and true
 meaning of life and condense them artistically.  If one is incapable of
 seeing the "deep currents" of life and notices only the froth on the surface
 and the dress, and if one does no more than list life's phenomena, exag-
 gerating catastrophic scenes and displaying only ugly phenomena, this will
 not only distort the true face of life, confuse people's understanding and
 create bad social effects but will eventually also bring into question the
 artistic content of the things described.
 Our socialist literature and art are developing healthily.  We firmly believe
 that so long as efforts are made to study, and regular attention is paid to
 guarding against and overcoming bourgeois liberalization and other unhealthy
 trends, our socialist literature and art will certainly be able to achieve
 even greater success.  As a crude outline of several questions concerning
 creation, this article provides reference material for further discussion
 among comrades in literature and art circles.  If there are places where
 the wording or analysis is either imperfect or simply erroneous, we sin-
 cerely hope that readers will offer their criticism.

 A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE THEORY OF 'NATURAL RIGHTS'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 32-36
 [Article by Gu Chunde [6253 2504 1795]]
 [Text] Not long ago, the theory of "natural rights" established by the bour-
 geois thinkers became one of the most important "theoretical" bases of the
 bourgeois liberal trends prevailing in Chinese society.  Therefore, it is
 absolutely necessary to conscientiously observe and study the theory of
 "natural rights," expound the historical process of its emergence, develop-
 ment and progressive role, and point out its hypocritical and limited nature
 and its class essence.
 The theory of "natural rights" was a product of historical development.  It
 sprouted during the Renaissance in Europe.  The 14th-and 15th centuries
 marked the darkest period of feudal and autocratic rule in Europe.  The
 feudal production relations severely hampered the development of the capi-
 talist economy, and the feudal lords and churches brutally exploited the
 broad masses of serfs.  The feudal state rule and the shackles of the church
 were unprecedentedly strengthened and class contradictions became increas-
 ingly acute.  Under the trammels of the feudal production relations and the
 heavy oppression of the feudal hierarchy and church privileges, the oppres-
 sed classes were not treated as human beings.  In particular, the bourgeoisie,
 which had emerged, did not possess any human rights.  Those who were the
 representatives of commodities and currency lacked the freedom of carrying
 out commodity exchange and circulation, those who amassed enormous wealth
 were not allowed to enjoy comforts, and the masters of science and tech-
 nology were brutally ruined.  Hence, humanity, human rights, freedom and the
 emancipation of individual character naturally became the basic demands of
 the bourgeoisie.  A fierce struggle between the bourgeoisie, feudal class and
 churches occurred in the ideological field.  The Renaissance in Europe,
 which started in the 14th century and reached a high tide in the 15th cen-
 tury, was a concentrated manifestation of this struggle.  Some early bourgeois
 thinkers ruthlessly attacked and repudiated Roman Catholicism and its deca-
 dent feudal ideology comprising mainly scholasticism and theology.  They
 began to express their views on the rights of individuals from the angles of
 the reason, dignity and happiness of man.  The ideological "natural rights"

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 had already murkily developed, although they were not explicit.  They ushered
 in the dawn of capitalism.
 The theory of "natural rights" was formally established and developed during
 the period of bourgeois enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Those
 who initiated the theory included Hugo Grotius of Holland, John Locke of
 England and Jean-Jacques Rousseau of France.  Proceeding from the rationality
 of mankind, they put forth for the first time the idea that the rights of
 individual freedom, individual happiness, acquisition of property and self-
 defensewere innate and inborn in mankind, which even God could not deny, to
 counter feudal autocracy, feudal hierarchy and the theological concept that
 "power is granted by God."  Grotius said that mankind was entitled to
 "natural rights."  According to his interpretation, the contents of such
 "natural rights" included "life, freedom and property."  Rousseau stressed
 that "every human being is born free and equal."  They maintained that
 feudal rulers violated and sabotaged these rights of man and that people had
 the right to overthrow the feudal rule.  According to inferences and hypo-
 theses made by bourgeois thinkers, the so-called "natural rights" were
 nothing but basic rights enjoyed by people as human beings, that is, the
 rights of man.  Their main contents included the right of existence, the
 right of freedom, the right of equality, the right of property, the right
 of self-defense, the right of resistance, and so forth.  These rights are
 natural, eternal, universal, untransferable and inalienable and would never
 change regardless of time, place, nationality, background or environment.
 They came into being prior to the establishment of the state and law, or even
 the existence of mankind.  The state and law could neither fix nor change
 them.  This was the initial meaning of the theory of "natural rights."
 The theory of "natural rights" reflected the characteristics of the capital-
 ist production relations and represented the interests and demands of the
 bourgeoisie.  Therefore, once it arose, it was accepted and welcomed by the
 bourgeoisie and became the theoretical basis of the bourgeoisie for repudi-
 ating the old order of feudalism.   In the 17th and 18th centuries, the
 bourgeois revolution erupted in-England, America and France.  "Natural
 rights" became the basic contents of the political program of the revolu-
 tions.  The "Declaration of Independence" of the United States and the
 "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" of France, issued in
 1776 and 1789 respectively, were permeated with the principle, spirit and
 contents of the theory of "natural rights."  The "Declaration of Independence"
 explicitly says:   "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
 created equal, that they are endowed by their 'creator' with certain inalien-
 able rights, and that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
 happiness."  The "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen"
 explicitly proclaimed:  "All men are born free and equal in rights," "The
 purpose of any political integration is to preserve the natural and unshak-
 able rights of man.  These are rights of liberty, property, safety and
 resistance to oppression."  The "declaration" particularly emphasized:
 "Property is a sacred and inviolable right."  After the victory of the French
 bourgeois revolution, a number of constitutions were drawn up.  Each consti-
 tution continued to affirm the principle of "natural rights" and stated that
 the principle of the "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen"

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 should be "scrupulously observed."  At present, the basic rights of man and
 citizens have been stipulated in the constitutions of a number of bourgeois
 countries in the world.  Hence, "natural rights" not only originated from
 natural law, but were also recognized and affirmed by substantive law.  At
 that time, the implications and contents of "natural rights" were more
 extensive than when they were first established, because they actually
 included various basic rights of, the citizen.
 It is obvious that the theory of "natural rights" has become not only an
 important content of the bourgeois democratic system, but also its theoreti-
 cal basis and the dogma which the bourgeoisie believes.  In spite of the fact
 that the specific implications and contents might change in this way or that,
 its bourgeois character will never change.
 The theory of "natural rights" in opposition to theocracy and monarchical
 power did play a fairly great progressive role in opposing the rule of
 feudal autocracy.   However, we should realize that although the theory of
 "natural rights" flaunted the banner of the interests of common people, it
 actually represented and reflected the rights and interests of the bour-
 geoisie.  Marx pointed out sharply that "natural rights" were actually the
 privileges of the bourgeoisie because their nucleus was the right of
 property.  In a capitalist society, such rights can only be monopolized by
 the owners of capital.  Marx also profoundly stressed: "Equally exploiting
 labor force is the main human right of capital."  ("Collected Works of Marx
 and Engels," Vol 23, p 324)  He affirmed that the relations of exploitation
 between capitalists and laborers, safeguarding the bourgeois rights of
 private property, and ensuring the capitalists' rights of freedom in trade
 and exploitation were the class essence of the theory of "natural rights."
 Furthermore, the theory of "natural rights" is an out-and-out bourgeois
 idealist conception of history because, first of all, this theory regards
 human rights as "natural."  This has distorted the historical cause for the
 formation of human rights.  The Marxist theory of the state and legal
 theories tells us that the so-called rights refer to certain rights and
 interests which law bestows on people and that those who enjoy these rights
 are entitled to act in a certain way and demand that other people react
 accordingly.  Rights and duties complement each other and are closely
 related.  "There are no rights without duties nor duties without rights."
 ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 2, p 137)  They emerge, exist and
 develop simultaneously.  Rights are neither innate nor exist naturally, nor
 are they created or bestowed by God.  The establishment of rights is closely
 connected with the formation of class, state and law.  Before the occurrence
 of class, state and law, no such thing as the exploitation of man by man
 could or would exist in primitive society.  Therefore, the situation of some
 people having rights and some others not having rights could never occur.
 Just as Engels said:  "Within a clan system, there was no difference between
 rights and duties."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 21, p 180)
 It was only after the occurrence of the exploiting and exploited classes and
 the formation of state and law that rights and duties were differentiated and

 set against each other.  "It seems that all rights have been bestowed upon
 a class and that all duties pushed on another class."  (ibid., p 202)  It is
 obvious that no human rights are innate, but are all recognized, stipulated
 and endowed by the state and law.
 Moreover, owing to the fact that the theory of "natural rights" regards
 human rights as "eternal" and "fixed and unalterable," it negates the
 objective law of the development and changes of the rights of man.  Dialec-
 tical materialists maintain that all things in the world are constantly on
 the move, developing and changing.  Nothing is eternal, fixed, unalterable
 or absolutely static.  Rights as social phenomena are no exception.  It is
 absolutely impossible for "eternal" and "fixed and unalterable" rights to
 exist.  Man is neither isolated nor unrestrained.  Man is a summation of
 social relationships.  In a class society, any man as a member of a class
 finds himself in such a social relationship.  The position of "man" in the
 social relationship is constantly changing.  In the meantime, the nature,
 contents and scope of rights are also continuously developing and changing.
 The development and changes of rights are determined by economic conditions
 and the nature of the social system.  Rights of a different nature will
 occur under different economic conditions and sociopolitical systems.  At
 the same time, the scope and contents of rights of the same social nature
 will also change.  "Natural rights" are rights of a capitalist nature, and
 their contents and scope are not the same in different stages of capitalist
 development.  Negating the changes and development of the contents and scope
 of rights is a metaphysical view.  Rights belong to the category of super-
 structure, and their existence and development cannot be separated from or
 exceed the material conditions and scientific and cultural level of the
 society.  Just as Marx pointed out, "Rights can never exceed the economic
 structure of the society or the cultural development of the society
 restricted by the economic structure."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels,"
 Vol 3, p 12)  If we talk about rights without taking into consideration the
 nature of the political system or the economic conditions and scientific and
 cultural level of the society, we will not only fail to truly bring to light
 the objective laws governing the development of rights, but also obliterate
 the class nature of rights and are. liable to lapse into the quagmire of
 idealism.  The stipulations of law on rights cannot be arbitrarily decided
 by legislators, because economic and cultural conditions, class contradic-
 tions and class struggle have to be taken into account.  The exercise of
 rights has to be guaranteed not only by a constitution and laws but also by
 fundamental material conditions.  If we only proclaim or stipulate certain
 rights in a constitution and laws without reliable economic and cultural
 conditions as a basis and guarantees to ensure their realization, all these
 rights can only be empty phrases which cannot be realized.
 Furthermore, the theory of "natural rights" regards the rights of man as
 "absolute" and "unrestricted."  Such a view distorts the characteristics and
 attributes of the rights of man.   Facts have proved that absolute and
 unrestricted rights never occur.   Even the founders of the theory of
 "natural rights" could not deny this.  Spinoza admitted that people's free-
 dom of speech should not go beyond the limit of disturbing the tranquility
 of society and harming the authority of the rulers.  Montesquieu said more

 directly:  "Political liberty does not mean that people can do as they
 please," "Liberty means that people can only do what is permitted by law."
 ("On the Spirit of Law," Vol 1, p 154)  While proclaiming "natural rights,"
 the "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" also restricted
 these rights, saying:  "Liberty refers to all acts which do not harm other
 people," "The enforcement of each individual's natural rights should be
 confined within the limits that other members of the society can also enjoy
 the same rights."  All these expositions and stipulations show that rights
 are neither absolute nor unrestricted.  They always have strings attached
 and restraints.  In a capitalist society, rights are limited to the scope
 of the interests of the bourgeoisie and the "scope permitted by the law" of
 the bourgeoisie.  They are not allowed to hamper the bourgeois rights of
 property, rights of politics and ruling order.
 Lastly, it is because of the fact that the theory of "natural rights"
 regards the rights of man as "universal" that it conceals the class nature of
 the theory.  Since the establishment, existence and development of rights
 are connected with class and they are bestowed by the state and law, they
 cannot be "universal" and treat all classes equally without discrimination.
 In a class society, "man" does not transcend classes and national boundaries,
 but belongs to a certain class and nation.  Any rights of man are rights of
 class, which are characterized by a distinctive class nature.  The theory of
 "natural rights" replaces man belonging to a class with abstract "man" and
 the class nature of rights with the "universality" of rights.  All this fully
 exposes the hypocrisy of this theory.   In a capitalist society, rights are
 based on the antithesis between classes.  The bourgeois state and law pro-
 tect the rights of the bourgeoisie, and restrict and expropriate the rights
 of the proletariat.  The rights of man and other democratic rights stipulated
 in the constitutions and laws of bourgeois states are true for the bourgeoisie
 and can be realized.  The reasons are simple.  It is because the bourgeoisie
 controls state power, wields the power for formulating and enforcing the law
 and possesses the means of production and all material conditions for exer-
 cising democratic rights.  It relies on the state power to maintain its
 property relationships and rule of capital.  Owing to the fact that the pro-
 letariat and the laboring masses do not possess any of these things, to them
 rights stipulated in laws are no more than empty talk which cannot be
 realized.  The reason why bourgeois countries contain such high-sounding
 stipulations in their constitutions and laws is to deceive the proletariat
 and the laboring masses, mitigate the contradictions between the proletariat.
 and the bourgeoisie and do some window dressing for the democracy and freedom
 of bourgeois nations.  In the final analysis, their purpose in doing so is to
 maintain the reactionary rule of capitalism.  Right from the first day when
 the bourgeoisie made its promise to the proletariat and the laboring masses,
 it never intended to make good this promise.  On the contrary, it tried by
 hook or by crook to restrain and prevent the proletariat and the laboring
 masses from exercising their rights of democracy and freedom by utilizing its
 constitutions and laws.  More and more such restrictions have been imposed.
 For example, the present U.S. federal law explicitly stipulates that nobody
 is allowed to use freedom of speech and of the press to "harass society"
 and propagate "violent revolution."  With regard to the right to vote, many
 restrictions have been imposed, including the level of education, property

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 conditions, length of residence, and so forth.  The government can at any
 time use administrative orders to deprive the laboring people of their basic
 rights.'  Under such circumstances, it is difficult for the proletariat and
 the laboring masses to exercise their democratic rights which will protect
 their class interests, but also harm the interests of the bourgeoisie.
 Therefore, while using the rights of democracy and freedom and various civil
 rights stipulated in the constitutions and laws of the bourgeois countries
 to carry out "legal" struggle against the bourgeoisie and strive for the
 improvement of their political status and living conditions, the proletariat
 and the laboring masses should not be misled by the false appearances of
 bourgeois democracy and freedom.  They should constantly raise their class
 consciousness and carry out their struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule
 of the bourgeoisie.
 In a word, the rights of man are not "natural," but conferred and stipulated
 by the state and laws; the rights of man are not universal, but characterized
 by distinct class nature; the rights of man are not abstract,.but specific;
 the rights of man are not absolute, but restricted by laws and ethics; the
 rights of man are not eternal, fixed and unchangeable, but their nature and
 applicable scope change as man's role in the material productive conditions
 and position are constantly changing.  Different countries with different
 social systems have rights of different class characters.  This is the basic
 viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism on the rights of man, which is sharply antago-
 nostic to the theory of the "natural rights" of the bourgeoisie.
 It is true that Marxists do not deny human rights altogether, but adopt an
 attitude of historically and specifically analyzing them.  In the present-
 day world, "human rights" have become a popular slogan which is widely
 accepted by various countries and a tool for carrying out modern inter-
 national and political struggle.  With the progress of history, the concept
 of human rights has also undergone a new development.   For example, in the
 past 10 or 20 years, the newly emerging countries--the Third World--have put
 forth a series of rights upholding national self-determination, defending the
 independence and sovereignty of nations, developing the national economy,
 freely dealing with various countries' wealth and natural resources, opposing
 foreign aggression, oppression and plunder, and demanding that a rational
 and new order based on the equality of various nations be established in
 international economic relations.  All this has infused new contents into
 the concept of human rights.  It has occurred as the opposite of imperialism,
 colonialism, racism and hegemonism and marks an important development of the
 traditional concept of human rights.  This has further developed the concept
 of human rights.  Of course, we agree to such a progressive concept of human
 rights and support the international struggle based on it.
 In building socialist democracy, we should adopt an analytical and critical
 attitude toward the traditional concept of human rights, which was smashed
 by the emerging national and democratic movement as early as after World
 War II.  We should interpret human rights in a way which conforms with
 Marxist principles.  Moreover, we should use more scientific and truthful

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 concepts--the rights of citizens--to expound our country's view on human
 rights. However, some people appreciate the theory of "natural rights" as
 a gem, saying that "man is born with the right to democracy and freedom" and
 that "absolute freedom of thinking and speech should be guaranteed."  Some
 people even advocate that the bourgeois multiparty system and parliamentarism
 and election system be introduced to socialist China.  They believe that the
 "socialist system is not as good as the capitalist system" and that "social-
 ist democracy is inferior to bourgeois democracy."  To them, Marxism-
 Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought no longer works and what they do is seek help
 from the bourgeois theory of "natural rights."  The reason for the occur-
 rence for this ideological trend is:  During the 10 chaotic years, the Lin
 Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques sabotaged the socialist
 democratic system and this ideological trend is a kind of historical punish-
 ment.  Apart from that, in recent years, some people have been influenced by
 bourgeois ideology from abroad.  Actually, the Chinese people had experience
 of the theory of "natural rights" long ago.  Early this century, when Marxism
 had not yet been disseminated in China, Chinese bourgeois thinkers introduced
 the theory of "natural rights" to China from Western countries as a "new
 learning."  They tried to use this theory to rescue old China, which was dark
 and backward, and establish a bourgeois republic.  What was the result?
 Their efforts ended in failure.  People who know a bit about modern Chinese
 history have probably not forgotten this.  The theory of "natural rights" did
 not work in old China, let alone in the new period of socialism.  If the
 theory of "natural rights" is preached again, does that not mean a great
 retrogression of history?
 It is undeniable that there is room for improvement in our country's social-
 ist superstructure and there are some shortcomings in certain aspects of our
 state system.  However, what strength should we rely on to eliminate these
 defects?  We should only rely on the strength of the socialist system and
 the broad masses of people and the leadership of the Communist Party and the
 guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, bring into full play the
 role of socialist democracy and,improve the socialist legal system.  We
 should on no account seek help from the bourgeois theory of "natural rights."
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, the party and
 government have adopted a series of effective measures and done a lot of work
 to carry forward socialist democracy and improve the socialist legal system.
 We have reexamined and redressed throughout the country a great number of
 false charges, wrong sentences and frame-ups; implemented policies for cadres,
 intellectuals and nationalities and other policies; and strengthened the work
 of the people's congresses at all levels, established permanent organs for
 the people's congresses at the provincial and county levels, and established
 direct elections for people's deputies at and below the county level.  We
 have restored and improved staff members' representative assemblies and drawn
 the masses to participate in state affairs, economic and cultural affairs and
 the affairs of social development.  We have carried out criticism and self-
 criticism in the press and strengthened the masses' supervision over the
 organs of the party and government and their working personnel.  We have
 strengthened legislative and judicial work and enacted a series of basic
 laws, including criminal law,.law on criminal procedure, law on civil
 procedure, law on economic contracts and so forth.  Our country's legal

 system is being gradually improved.  The execution of these measures has
 guaranteed people's democracy and expanded their rights of being the masters
 of their own affairs.  In particular, the "Guiding Principles for Inner-
 Party Political Life," adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CCP
 Central Committee, has stressed that our country "will gradually build a
 highly democratic socialist political system" and that the building of the
 state organs at all levels should be strengthened in accordance with the
 principle of democratic centralism so that people's congresses at all levels
 and their permanent organs will become authoritative organs of state power
 of the people.  We should gradually promote people's direct democracy in
 basic-level organs of state power and social life and exert great efforts to
 develop the laboring masses' democratic management in production.  All this
 incontrovertibly proves that only the socialist system can ensure the full
 exercise of the people's various rights.  It will not work and can only
 become frivolous and fantastic talk if we deviate from socialist democracy
 and the legal system and socialist modernization to talk about the problem
 of human rights.
 Our country's socialist democracy is being strengthened and developed.  It.
 is, in essence, far superior to bourgeois democracy.  It ensures the
 democracy of the majority of people to be the masters of their own affairs.
 Socialist democracy is democracy in both name and reality.  The idea that
 "socialist democracy is not as good as bourgeois democracy" is a groundless
 bias.  We firmly believe that in the struggle of the people of the whole
 country for building socialist material and spiritual civilization, our
 country will continue to expand the people's democratic rights and establish
 the most extensive and-beautiful socialist democracy of mankind.

 STRENGTHEN SOCIALIST EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 37-40
 [Article by Fan Kang [5400 1660]]
 [Text]  In the rural areas of our country, the implementation of the prin-
 ciples and policies worked out since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP
 Central Committee, and particularly the recent years of extensive practice
 of the various forms of production responsibility system, has aroused the
 enthusiasm of the masses of peasants; grain production and the diversified
 economy have been rapidly revived and developed and the livelihood of the
 overwhelming majority of the peasants has been improved in varying degrees.
 This is a situation that has not been seen for many years.  However, at the
 same time we must see that this is just a beginning, the foundation has
 still not quite been consolidated, and quite a few new contradictions and
 new problems have surfaced.  Therefore, it is imperative to continue to
 exert arduous efforts, strengthen investigation and study, work in a down-
 to-earth manner, and especially give more effective leadership to the
 ideological position and do more extensive and thorough ideological and
 political work among the broad peasant masses.
 What is the basic task of the ideological and political work of the CCP in
 the rural areas at present?  Briefly, it is to persevere unremittingly in
 carrying out socialist education among the peasant masses.
 The vast numbers of peasants have consistently held an important position in
 the Chinese revolution and construction and have made and are continuing to
 make their unique important contributions.  Since the founding of the PRC,
 our party has adopted a series of correct policies and measures and led the
 hundreds and millions of peasants in taking the socialist road.  There is no
 doubt that the broad peasant masses have a reservoir of enthusiasm for
 socialism.  Then does this mean that we need no longer carry out socialist
 ideological education among the peasant masses?  That is really not so.
 China is a big country with a history of more than 2,000 years of feudalism.
 The influence of the ideology and habits left over by the age-old mutually
 separated individual economy is deep-rooted in the rural areas.  At the same
 time, because of the "leftist" mistakes committed in our guiding ideology in
 the past, and particularly the sabotage carried out for years by the Lin Biao
 and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques, egalitarianism, poverty, unitary

 system of the means of production and the single-product economy, excessively
 rigid control, and so on, were regarded as the so-called essential properties
 of socialism and the peasants were forced to accept them, thus bringing about
 great confusion in people's minds.  Over the past few years, in encountering
 this state of affairs, our party has resolutely brought order out of chaos
 and established the production responsibility system, a new form of operation
 and management, in the light of the need for reviving and developing, produc-
 tion.  This is a great change in the countryside.  Quite a few people have
 failed to follow up ideologically, or they have misunderstandings, doubts and
 misgivings in one respect or another, which can be summarized in incisive
 questions:  Is what is being practiced now aimed at practicing socialism?
 Do we still need to practice socialism?  Practice demands the party of the
 working class to frequently give ideological and political education and
 provide correct guidance to the peasants.  The rural party committees at
 various levels must frequently imbue the peasant.masses with correct but not
 distorted socialist ideas (including the socialist road, socialist policies
 and the future of socialism) with specific objects in mind and help them
 more conscientiously continue to forge ahead along the path charted by the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee.
 In the light of the actual situation at present, in carrying out socialist
 education, we must concentrate on the following tasks:
 First, extensively and thoroughly propagate the correctness, great signifi-
 cance and socialist nature of the principles and policies of the CCP Central
 Committee since its third plenary session.
 The vast numbers of peasants all understand that the improvement of their
 livelihood over the past few years is the product of the party's principles
 and policies since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee.
 During the 10-year turmoil, there was a peasant in a rural area of north-
 western Shandong Province who toiled all the year round without enough to
 eat and wear.  He sought divine advice and promises year after year, but
 life for him still did not show the slightest improvement.  The new policies
 formulated by the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee,
 especially after the implementation of the production responsibility system,
 enabled his family to come into their own economically at a rapid pace and
 to embark on the road to prosperity.  After the autumn harvest last year,
 seeing that their house was full of grain and cotton, his daughter-in-law
 teased him:  "Dad, are you still going to seek the advice and help of gods
 this year?"  The old man cheerfully answered:   "Oh, no, no.  We must
 attribute all we have today only to the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP
 Central Committee!"  Look, the old man in a remote district also knew that
 his prosperous life was the result of the correct policies of the CCP.  The
 "leftist" rural policies practiced during the "Great Cultural Revolution"
 brought about one result, and today's correct rural policies have produced
 another result.  Contrasting these two results, the peasants have a very
 clear idea in their minds.  We must firmly grasp this favorable opportunity
 and adopt various vivid and vigorous as well as concrete and effective forms
 to propagate the party's rural policies, and particular stress should be put
 on the socialist nature of these series of policies so that the peasants can

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 see through their own immediate interests the brilliant prospects of the
 socialist collective economy and have a deeper love for socialism.
 At present, because the remnants of "leftist" ideology are still playing a
 role, some cadres of the communes and their subdivisions regard one or two
 concrete forms of the production responsibility system (such as the system
 of fixing output quotas for individual households and that of assigning the
 households full responsibility for task completion) as the practice of
 'dividing the fields and working alone and as retrogression to the old
 society and oppose and obstruct them as a result.  Owing to the ideology and
 habits left over by the old society, some peasants consider the production
 responsibility system as a practice of "everyone looking after himself" and
 as nothing to do with socialism.  Although these two kinds of erroneous
 ideas vary to some degree, they all stem from the misunderstanding of our
 policies.  Our party's ideological work must have a definite object in view.
 At present, efforts must be concentrated on eradicating these misunder-
 standings.   The overwhelming majority of the peasants are very happy about
 the present policies, but at the same time, they are afraid that the poli-
 cies might change at any time.  So, some of them go to the entrance of their
 villages to wait for newspapers every day.  This idea of being afraid that
 the present policies might change at any time is, of course, related to the
 mistakes existing in our work on the one hand and is caused by the fact that
 they have an insufficient understanding of the socialist nature of the
 present policies, do not feel secure about the present policies and thus
 lack the proper steadfastness on the other hand.  We must clearly state that
 the production responsibility system is only a change in the operation and
 management of the socialist agricultural collective economy and it does not
 touch on the system of collective ownership of the basic means of production.
 Take, for example, the system of assigning to the households full responsi-
 bility for task completion.  It is a relationship of a contract between the
 peasant households and the collective, a relationship which is based on the
 system of public ownership of land.  This system puts land, large-scale farm
 machines and tools and water conservancy facilities under the unified admin-
 istration and use of the collective, accepts state planning and guidance, has
 certain public deductions, arranges the livelihood of the families of armymen
 and martyrs, the households enjoying the "five guarantees" and the families
 with material difficulties in a unified way, and in some cases it carries
 out agricultural capital construction in a unified plan.  So it is a compo-
 nent part of the socialist agricultural collective economy rather than the
 individual economy of small private ownership existing before cooperativiza-
 tion.  Along with the development of the productive forces, it will develop
 and become a more perfect collective economy step by step.  We must still
 clearly state that our party and government will uphold that the road of
 socialist collectivization, and that the system of public ownership of the
 means of production such as land will not change for a long period of time
 and that the implementation of the production responsibility system in the
 agricultural collective economy will not change for a long period of time.
 So, the peasants can set their minds at rest.
 The rural grassroots party organizations generally attach importance to
 carrying out ideological and political education among the peasants.  The

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 problem is that some localities regard this ideological and political educa-
 tion only as a means of bringing a certain concrete policy into force (it is
 necessary).  They more often than not judge the case as it stands and
 neglect to carry out such education on the higher plane of the whole social-
 ist education.               The purpose of any work we communists do is both to attain
 the current concrete goal and to fundamentally enhance the socialist con-
 sciousness of the masses.  Putting one-sided emphasis on concrete work at
 the expense of the big goal of educating the peasants in what is of funda-
 mental importance is a tendency of routinism, which we must take care to
 guard against and overcome.
 Second, carry out the education of correctly handling the relations of the
 state, the collective and the individual in a regular and sustained way.
 In the rural collective economy, the relations of the state, the collective
 and the individual are more distinctive than those in the national economy
 and are more fully manifested in the various aspects of production and live-
 lihood.  This requires us to constantly pay attention to studying and
 readjusting it.  Practice has consistently put these problems before the
 party's ideological and political work and has demanded that we adapt our-
 selves to different conditions and adopt different forms to find correct
 answers. The introduction of various forms of the production responsibility
 system in the rural areas, and particularly the. form of fixing output quotas
 for individual households and the form of assigning the households full
 responsibility for task completion, has all the more made the correct under-
 standing and handling of the relations of the state, the collective and the
 individual become a fairly striking problem.  Take, for example, the form of
 assigning the households full responsibility for task completion.  It raises
 the formula:  "Hand over the amount originally agreed upon to the state,
 reserve the full amount for the collective and the rest is all one's own."
 This is a formula for handling the relations among the three parties.  There
 is inevitably a struggle of different ideas in this respect.  The other forms
 of the production responsibility system put solutions to the problem of the
 relations of the state, the collective and the individual in their own ways,
 and there are also ideological contradictions of one kind or another in this
 respect.  This is not in the least strange.  This is because putting prin-
 ciples into effect invariably requires a complicated process and is usually
 not as direct and smooth as one would wish.  In addition, people's ideologi-
 cal consciousness is not uniform and in this respect there is a distinction
 between the advanced and the backward; in terms of people's vision, there is
 a difference between the farsighted and the shortsighted.   There is a lot of
 work to do in unifying people's understanding.  Therefore, we must conduct
 ideological work in a thoroughgoing manner.
 In order to educate and lead the vast numbers of peasants in correctly
 handling the relations of the state, the collective and the individual, it'
 is necessary to uphold the principle of simultaneously taking the interests
 of the state, the collective and the individual into account and not to con-
 centrate on one thing only.  At present particular stress should be put on
 the following tasks:  1) Take the planned economy as the dominant factor and
 regulation by market mechanism as the supplementary factor.  This, fundamental
 72

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 principle is also applicable to the countryside.  Giving play to the deci-
 sionmaking power of communes and their subdivisions must be carried out
 under the state's unified planning.  Going beyond the orbit of state plan-
 ning will directly or indirectly infringe on the interests of the state.
 That is entirely wrong.  One of the important reasons for some localities
 unrestrictedly expanding the area sown to tobacco and reducing pig breeding
 is that the peasants do not pay proper attention to ensuring the fulfillment
 of state plans.  We must repeatedly emphasize to the peasants that the
 economy can be reinvigorated only under the guidance of state planning.
 It is wrong to impose excessively rigid control over everything, but any-
 thing which should be carried out in a centralized way must be properly put
 under unified administration.  The peasants are only allowed to carry out
 their activities within the bounds of state planning.  This will be conducive
 to the long-term interests of the peasants and the state can smoothly carry
 out its construction as a result.  Departing from the guidance of state plan-
 ning to seek the development of the small collective and even that of the
 individual will inevitably damage the interests of the entire people includ-
 ing the collective and the individual.  Naturally, it is essential not to
 indulge in harmful directives, but correct state planning is absolutely
 indispensable.  Therefore, while implementing the production responsibility
 system, it is imperative to strictly observe state planning, resolutely per-
 form production contracts in full and not to violate them in any sense of. the
 term.  To ensure the interests of the state, it is essential to strictly act
 according to the guidance of state planning and carry out the state purchases
 and assigned quotas without fail.  Correctly handling the relations of the
 state, the collective and the individual must first find expression in this
 respect.  2) At present, some peasants are not so enthusiastic about making
 deductions to the collective and even refuse to fulfill their obligations.
 It is obviously wrong for them to lump together the practice of some cadres
 taking more than their share with collective deductions.  The collective
 deductions we have referred to here partially include various fields, such as
 accumulation funds and public welfare funds.  The necessary subsidies for
 cadres constitute only a tiny amount of collective deductions.  All this is
 indispensable for consolidating the socialist collective economy.  If the
 socialist collective economy is fundamentally shaken, the whole interests of
 the state will not be ensured and our personal interests will lose their
 backing.  Therefore, we must never set the interests of the individual
 against those of the collective.  The vast numbers of rural cadres assidu-
 ously serve the people and a considerable number of them are so devoted to
 public service as to forget their own interests.  There does exist the
 phenomenon in which a tiny number of cadres take more than their share.  Our
 party resolutely opposes this practice.  It confuses right and wrong to
 equate collective deductions with the practice of cadres taking more than
 their share.  Using opposition to the practice of cadres taking more than
 their share as an excuse to refuse to provide deductions to the collective is
 in fact the reflection of the selfish mentality of small production.  People
 with these erroneous ideas are expected to make amendments through education.
 Concerning oneself with the interests of the collective and safeguarding
 collective property are the basic requirements for the socialist collective
 peasants.  Particular attention should be put on this point.  3) At present,
 a small section of peasants concentrate only on personal gains.  Consciously

 or unconsciously, they seek one-sided development of themselves by trying to
 separate the personal interests from the relations of the state, the collec-
 tive and the individual, a relationship which is inseparable.  Some of them
 even harm the collective or use the pretext of boosting the interests of the
 collective to fleece the state.  This is a harmful tendency.  We must adopt
 effective measures to correct it rather than let it go unchecked.  The pro-
 duction'responsibility system is a means of socialist operation and manage-
 ment.  In both the system of fixing output quotas for individual households
 and that of assigning the households full responsibility for task completion,
 there are both unified administration, and contracting rather than exclusive
 contracting.  What is fundamental and plays a decisive role is the socialist
 economy.  This is a major premise which brooks no violation.  It is inevitable
 that differences will emerge, in that some commune members will become pros-
 perous earlier and some later and that there will be differences in varying
 degrees among commune members.  People who have now become prosperous or
 highly prosperous must enthusiastically help, on their own accord, those who
 have material difficulties for the time being.  They must only look after
 themselves, still less infringe on the interests of. others and the state.
 The relations of mutual aid in unity between the people is one of the
 important indications of socialist society.  Opposing selfishness and
 encouraging the idea of doing everything for the country and the public are
 precisely an important content of socialist education.  We must consistently
 pay close attention to it.
 Third, carry out education in maintaining social public security and improving
 social customs in a big way.
 Over a period of time, in some places in the countryside there have been
 various disputes and contradictions and a strained relationship among a sec-
 tion of people.  What brooks no neglect is that some phenomena of breaking
 laws and violating discipline have developed.  While rejoicing at the develop-
 ment of production and the improvements of livelihood, the broad masses of
 peasants feel anxious only about the worsening social public security.  We
 must not treat the voice of the masses with indifference.  The rural basic
 organizations must give full play to the role of political power inherent
 in them and adopt effective measures in maintaining social public security.
 Of course, it is first necessary to carry out education in a widespread way,
 mobilize men and women, old and young in the countryside to bring the
 superiority of socialism into play and to wage resolute struggle against the
 crimes of a handful of people by relying on organized forces.   In some
 places, and particularly in some coastal rural areas, where there is no regard
 for productive labor, some peasants engaged in speculation and profiteering
 and even smuggling, thus committing economic crimes.  We must oppose the
 corrosive influence of bourgeois ideas and deal blows at all offenses against
 the law, which endanger the socialist system.
 With regard to the various conflicts of interests.among the peasant masses,
 we must widely build socialist spiritual civilization through activities
 such as the "rules and regulations for villagers" and "five-good families."
 Everybody is encouraged to foster good ideology and good work style, such
 as loving the country as one's own family, putting other people's interests

 ahead of one's own and helping each other in unity to build a new socialist
 countryside.  Some of our comrades more often that not have a one-track mind
 and concentrate on one thing only when they begin to work.  When they are
 called on to grasp production, they exclusively concentrate on production.
 They do not attach proper importance to the building of socialist spiritual
 civilization.  They little imagine that without the building of socialist
 spiritual civilization, production will certainly suffer.  Therefore, the
 education in maintaining social public security and improving social customs
 should also be taken as a consistent basic task of our party's ideological
 work in the rural areas.
 It cannot be denied that the introduction of the various forms of the pro-
 duction responsibility system in the rural areas has caused some new prob-
 lems, both in organizational forms and work methods, for the party's ideo-
 logical and political work.  Now, with regard to propaganda and education
 work among the peasants, we must do it in a more thoroughgoing, solid and
 practical way, with the aim of really seeking solutions to the various prob-
 lems to which the peasants pay close attention and about which they have no
 idea.  Ideological and political work like this will be really welcomed by.
 the peasant masses.  In some places in the countryside, cadres of certain
 production teams refused to take further part in collective affairs.  Such
 being the case, the commune members organized themselves spontaneously and
 had "team activities" at a fixed time (say, a month or half a month) to keep
 abreast of state affairs and study the teams' own affairs.  Facts have proved
 that the peasants concern themselves with state affairs and need ideological
 and political work.  The problem is that we must find a new method suited to
 the new conditions.  After substantially reducing the interference in economic
 matters, the rural party branch committees must exert more energy and effort
 on studying the ideological conditions of the peasant masses, studying the
 party's principles and policies and carrying out ideological education among
 the peasants in a way that suits the remedy to the case.  After diverse forms
 of the production responsibility system were introduced, we had more, rather
 than fewer, backbone elements whom we could rely on.  The basic party organi-
 zations must establish various forms of relations with them and arouse them
 to carry out vivid and vigorous socialist education among the peasant masses,
 closely centered on the main subject of continuing to implement the party's
 rural principles and policies and making further advances amid the already
 very good rural situation and prospects.  In carrying out socialist educa
 tion among the peasants, it is first necessary to strengthen the party ranks
 and rely on them in carrying out vivid and vigorous propaganda and education
 work among the broad masses.
 Our party has accumulated rich experiences in the mass work which the party
 has carried out in the countryside for long years, the most important of
 which is the pressing need to give play to the exemplary role of party mem-
 bers and the vanguard role of rural youth.  At present, some rural party
 members ask the party branch committees for assignment of tasks to carry out
 ideological work among fixed households of their own accord.  With a sense
 of pride rarely seen"for many years, some veteran party members who were
 enthusiasts in the years of the land reform and are now already 50 or 60
 years old contracted to contact and arouse large numbers of peasant

 households to help the poor become prosperous and to foster healthy prac-
 tices and drive out unhealthy ones.  They have done their work successfully.
 By working independently, they have enhanced their ability and won the
 respect of the masses.  Young people invariably constitute a dynamic force.
 They are highly energetic and full of vigor, and they are the ones least
 influenced by old conventions.  Party organizations must organize them
 through the CYL and help them to give full play to their proper and great
 role in carrying out socialist education and in building a new socialist
 countryside.  So long as the leading members of the rural grassroots party
 organizations take the lead and closely rely on the two forces--the vast
 numbers of party members and young people--and create various effective
 methods in practice, rural ideological work will certainly be carried out in
 a vivid and dramatic way and will bring about incalculable material results.

 CHANGE HABITS AND CUSTOMS AND MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT MORE BEAUTIFUL
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 41-43
 [Article by Yang Rupeng [2799 1172 7720]]
 [Text]  In carrying out courteous activities of the "five stresses and four
 points of beauty," the leading comrades of the CCP Central Committee have
 taken the lead and set good examples by participating in cleaning up and
 public health activities as well as by planting trees.  But some people
 regarded these activities as a trifling matter and thought that it was
 unnecessary for leading comrades to take the lead and mobilize the masses.
 Are tree planting and public health activities important matters, and do
 they have any social significance?.
 The beautification program and public health activities are in the interest
 of improving the health of the entire nation. An environment that is
 covered with trees and shrubs, that is clean and beautiful, will help
 people to get rid of dirt, diseases, pollution, noise, and certain miseries
 and annoyances caused by natural calamities, and will improve people's
 physical well-being and make them happy and vigorous.  The influence of the
 hygienic environment on the health of people is easy to understand.  Marx
 said that public health work was important because this work would "protect
 the health and well-being of the labor force which is the basic source of
 all value."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 26, p 159)  Comrade
 Mao Zedong also said that public health work was important because it was in
 the interest of production, work and study and in the interest of transform-
 ing the weak physiques of the Chinese people and making them healthy.                  This
 is an important matter directly related to the physical condition of the
 people, the strength or weakness of the country and the continuation of the
 nation; it is also related to maintaining social material production and
 spiritual production.  Therefore, it is only natural that health be an
 important aspect of spiritual civilization.  Under the cruel exploitation
 and suppression of the ruling classes before liberation, many of the urban
 and rural areas in our country were dirty and disease-ridden, and the
 people's physiques were very weak; the nation was called by some foreigners
 the "sickman of Asia."  Following the establishment of the PRC, and owing
 to the concern of the party and the government and the efforts made by
 various health departments and medical personnel, health and disease preven-
 tion networks were set up at various levels and patriotic public health

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 campaigns were.carried out in depth.  As a result, the health of our people
 has improved considerably, the average lifespan has increased, and the
 hygienic conditions in both rural and urban areas have been drastically
 improved.  The great contributions of public health work in promoting the
 health of people across the country would have been unimaginable in the
 old China. But, at the same time, we must understand that it is a very
 arduous task to create a clean and hygienic environment and change the
 habits of paying no attention to health and courtesy.  Therefore, it is
 necessary for us to carry out the "five stresses and four points of beauty"
 activities, carry out ideological education, and popularize knowledge about
 health and science so that people will be aware of the significance of pay-
 ing attention to hygiene and of the serious hazards of not doing so.  People
 must be mobilized to disseminate and persuade others to pay attention to
 hygiene--coupled with necessary and strict punishment measures--so that the
 good habit of "everyone is paying attention to hygiene, every household is
 clean and everyone is active in preventing pollution" will gradually become
 widespread, coupled with the building of a strong momentum of public opinion.
 The masses must be mobilized to clean all places, improve hygienic condi-
 tions in both rural and urban areas, and improve the hygienic environment
 in big and medium-sized cities.
 In the past, we did not do much work to publicize the importance of planting
 trees for the health of the people, and the broad masses of people still do
 not have a necessary understanding of its importance.  Enormous scientific
 research work and statistics on experiments have shown that forests and
 trees keep the air fresh, improve the climate, prevent blowing dust and
 lower noise pollution.  Some trees, shrubs and flowers produce elements that
 kill bacteria and thus prevent some diseases.  Other trees are helpful in
 detecting the extent of environmental pollution.  Many areas of the world
 where people are living longer lives are characterized by mountains and
 rivers, and quiet and beautiful environments.  To cover soil with green
 plants is not only in the interest of people's health, but also beautifies
 the environment; it is in the interest of the people that this work be
 done in a big way.
 The campaign for planting trees and paying attention to public health is of
 great significance for the development of the national economy.  When Lenin
 referred to industrial production, he said that it was necessary "to make
 labor conditions more healthy, to enable tens of millions of workers to
 work in hazard-free areas by eliminating smoke, dust and mud and to quickly
 transform the dirty and disgusting workshops into clean, bright and com-
 fortable laboratories."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 19, p 42)  As we
 know, men are the most important and active factors in the productive force.
 To change the dirty and chaotic environment is in the interest of promoting
 people's physical conditions and of improving work, labor and study effi-
 ciency and is consequently in the interest of promoting the development of
 productive force.   Furthermore, modernized mass production depends on
 equipment, instruments and meters and other advanced equipment with very
 high precision and sensitivity.  In order to ensure smooth operation of this
 equipment and enable them to be used for the longest possible time, it is
 necessary to carry out civilized production.  Paying attention to hygienic

 conditions and keeping the environment clean and beautiful is an indispen-
 sable condition and important part of such production.
 Planting trees is very important in developing the national economy, and
 this work must be particularly stressed at the present stage because it is
 not only important but also urgent.  Developed forestry is a criterion for
 state wealth, national prosperity and social civilization.  Forests are
 valuable resources for the national economy because they provide us with
 timber and various forestry sideline products, but what is more important
 is that forests have a very important role of maintaining natural ecological
 balance.  They constitute a very important condition for ensuring high and
 stable yields in agriculture and animal husbandry.  In fact, forests'play
 many roles in this respect.  For example, they retain water resources,
 weaken surface and underground currents, preserve soil and water, act as
 windbreaks and sandbreaks, reduce pollution and partially regulate the
 climate.  Therefore, to plant trees and develop forestry is a basic aspect
 of farm capital construction, a strategic measure in transforming nature,
 and a great cause that will benefit present and future generations.
 People's understanding of the role of forests gradually deepens with the
 development of society and science.  In ancient times, people were only
 aware of forests from the angle of their direct interest, which meant that
 forests provided them with timber and various forestry sideline products.
 They understood very little or did not understand at all the indirect inter-
 est they could get from forests.  Following the development of agriculture,
 animal husbandry and industry, people began to reclaim lands and herd their
 animals in a way that damaged forests and to fell trees excessively.  In
 addition, forests have been damaged by wars, fires.and pests.  As a result,
 the acreage of forests has decreased and the supply of timber is decreasing,
 and at the same time there have appeared natural calamities such as floods,
 drought, winds, sand and environmental pollution.  When Marx was referring
 to the influence of the activities of mankind on the natural environment,
 he said:  "It is only men that leave their own imprint on nature.  That is
 because they have not only changed the position of plants and animals but
 also changed the outlook and climate of the places where they are living."
 ("Collected Works of Marx," Vol 20, p 373)  That is to say, on the one hand,
 mankind has made increasing achievements in understanding and transforming
 nature, but on the other hand, he has caused a series of environmental
 problems.  Therefore, "we must in no way become intoxicated with our vic-
 tories over nature.  Nature has taken its revenge on us for each of our
 victories.  There is no doubt that we achieve the anticipated results in the
 first step of each victory, but the situation is always quite different in
 the second and third steps.  It is often the case that the initial results
 are offset by unexpected influences."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels,"
 Vol 3, p 517)  Engels pointed out that in the mid-19th century, the Russians
 recklessly felled trees and caused serious consequences that "have impov-
 erished the soil in many regions."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels,"
 Vol 22, p 457)  In our country, the loess plateau along the middle reaches
 of the Huanghe River was originally covered with forests and grasslands;
 it was a zone with prosperous agriculture and animal husbandry and the cradle
 of the Chinese people.  The forests were later seriously damaged, which

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 caused numerous calamities following big-scale construction undertaken by
 various rulers in history, damage during various wars and reckless logging
 of trees. In the contemporary era, the region has been subject to frequent
 natural calamities such as floods and droughts, and the river now contains
 more silt than any other river in the world.   This problem is not just con-
 fined to the Huanghe River.  We have made certain achievements in forestry
 construction over the past 3 decades and more since the founding of the PRC,
 but because of the very weak forestry foundation and the interference of
 the "leftist" guiding ideology, the situation of our forests is still
 lagging behind and they are far from meeting the needs of the development
 of the national economy as well as the people's livelihood.  Our country is
 still one of the countries in the world with very low forest coverage.  In
 addition, the distribution of our forests is not balanced, while many
 regions are characterized by serious ecological imbalance and soil erosion
 which have seriously affected the development of agriculture and animal
 husbandry.  To make our country green and restore and develop forests is a
 very arduous and urgent strategic task of the whole nation.  We must be
 clearly aware of this situation, take active measures and respond to the
 "Resolution on Unfolding an All-People Voluntary Tree-Planting Campaign"
 passed by the 4th Plenary Session of the 5th NPC and contribute to making
 our motherland green.
 The tree-planting and hygiene campaign is a matter of changing habits and'
 customs, and an important aspect of beautifying the environment and building
 spiritual civilization is that this will help promote the development of the
 political consciousness of the broad masses of people and form good social
 practices.  These benefits can be said to be the basic spirit for our waging
 the tree-planting and hygiene campaign.   Lenin once termed pernicious and
 infectious diseases and typhus as "bad consequences of Russians' uncivilized-
 ness, poverty and ignorance."   ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 30, p 198)
 He also pointed out that to eliminate these diseases and the louses that
 spread them "is our first measure for civilization."  (ibid., Vol 30, p 160)
 Consequently, he personally signed the decision to allot fees for cleaning
 works in Moscow and meticulously inspected the nationwide activities of
 "hygienic environmental week" and advocated that "Moscow must set an example
 in cleanliness."  (ibid., Vol 35, p 528)  Planting trees and paying attention
 to hygiene is the common cause of hundreds of millions of people and such a
 campaign can draw the broadest masses of people to participate.  This
 campaign cannot make achievements in a short time.   Therefore, we must per-
 sist in tirelessly carrying out ideological education, hard work and manage-
 ment for years in succession.  Comrade Hu Yaobang has pointed out that the
 campaign is closely related to the spiritual outlook of the entire Chinese
 people.  To have done a good job in planting trees and paying attention to
 hygiene means to have demonstrated our organization and discipline, and
 this achievement represents our civilization, which arouses people's vigor.
 The CCP Central Committee has highly valued the great political and economic
 significance of the tree-planting and hygiene campaign and considered the
 present national conditions and the ideological situation of the broad
 masses of people, and consequently it calls for doing a good job in cleaning,
 hygiene and tree planting to change the dirty environment as a breakthrough

 in building socialist spiritual civilization.  It is not an easy job to
 change the habits and customs of tens of millions of people and overcome
 the difficulties that have accumulated for many years, nor can this work
 be completed at a stroke.  But the Chinese people have a good tradition of
 paying attention to hygiene and planting trees, we have the powerful leader-
 ship of the party and the superior socialist system, excellent national con-
 ditions and industrious people.  Therefore, as long as the party and govern-
 ment organizations at all levels are able to step up their ideological and
 organizational leadership, make overall arrangements, and mobilize the
 masses and are persistent in carrying out their work in a down-to-earth way,
 a clean and beautiful environment covered in green is sure to emerge in our
 urban and rural areas.

 FALSE HISTORIOGRAPHY SERVING REGIONAL HEGEMONISM--COMMENTING ON SOME
 FALLACIES IN THE HISTORIOGRAPHY OF VIETNAM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 pp 44-48
 [Article by Dai Kelai [2071 0668 0171] and Xu Yongzhang [6079 3057 3864]]
 [Text]  Ever since the unification of the northern and southern parts of
 Vietnam, the Le Duan clique has been frenziedly pushing regional hegemonism
 in a vain attempt to dominate Southeast Asia.   It has published numerous
 volumes of so-called historical works which, meeting the needs of its policy
 of aggression, distort historical facts, confuse right and wrong, make
 malicious remarks by innuendo and even go to the extent of openly spreading
 slander.  In Vietnam today, historiography has actually become an instrument
 used by the Vietnamese authorities to push regional hegemonism.
 A Fabricated "Van-Lang State"
 To put Vietnam in a higher historical position, some Vietnamese historians
 have put back the date of the ancient history of Vietnam to an even earlier
 period.  They assert that the Vietnamese "established the Van-Lang Society
 with a unique Bronze Age culture 3,000 to 4,000 years ago and that the
 Vietnamese nation was obviously extraordinarily strong."  (Nguyen Linh and
 others:  "The Question of the Hung-Vuong Kings and Archaeology" carried in
 Vietnam's HISTORICAL RESEARCH, March 1968, No 108, p 23)  They even say that
 in ancient Southeast Asia, "a representative culture stemmed from the ances-
 tral home of the Vietnamese" and ancient Vietnam was "a unique center of
 Southeast Asian culture."   (Dang Nghiem Van:   "The Course of Formation and
 Development of the United Vietnamese Nation" carried in Vietnam's HISTORICAL
 RESEARCH, March-April 1978, No 179, p 10)  They also boasted that ancient
 Vietnam "was an agricultural center of the world."  (Pham Huy Thong:  "Bronze
 Drum" carried in Vietnam's SPECIAL ISSUE ON BRONZE DRUM, Vol 1, p 10)   In
 short, they seemed to say that everything Vietnamese was the "best" in
 Southeast Asia so that Vietnam should naturally be the overlord of the
 region.
 Anyone with rudimentary historical knowledge knows that the authentic
 recorded history of Vietnam could not possibly be dated back to earlier than
 China's Qin dynasty.  In 207 B.C., Zhao Tuo, a Qin official in charge of the
 border area, founded a local independent state of Nanyue with the city of
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 Guangzhou as its seat of government.  He established Jiaozhi Prefecture in
 the northern part of today's Vietnam and Jiuzhen Prefecture in the northern
 part of today's central Vietnam.' This was the first Vietnamese political
 power recorded in history.  In the ancient history of Vietnam, the Nanyue
 State was considered an orthodox governmental state and named the Trieu
 (Zhao) dynasty, and Zhao Tuo was called the founding ruler of the state of
 Vietnam.   (Le Van Huu, a scholar specializing in ancient Vietnamese history,
 said:  "Emperor Vo of the Trieu dynasty opened up the land of Vietnam and
 founded his empire there....  He?rendered immortal contributions to the
 founding of an empire in Vietnam!"  ("Complete History of Great Vietnam:
 Supplement," Vol 2)  He regarded Zhao Tuo as the founder of Vietnam.  In
 his "Binh Ngo Imperial Mandate," Nguyen Trai said:  "Ever since our country
 was founded by the Trieu, Dinh, Ly and Than families...."  He regarded the
 Trieu dynasty as the first political power of Vietnam.  Neither of them
 mentioned the "Van-Lang State.")
 Not only foreign scholars studying Vietnamese history but also Vietnamese
 historians doubt the existence of the "Van-Lang State."  According to the
 ancient history of Vietnam, the "Van-Lang State" existed for 2,622 years
 from 2879 B.C. to 258 B.C., during which time 18 Hung-Vuong kings reigned.
 Vietnamese bourgeois historian Tran Trong Kim pointed out:  "Each of the
 Hung-Vuong kings was on the throne for an average of about 150 years.
 .Though they lived in ancient times, it was hardly possible that such a
 great number of people would live such a long life."  (Tran Trong Kim:
 "General History of Vietnam," Vietnamese version, p 25)  This remark alone
 showed that the existence of the "Van-Lang State" was unbelievable.   French
 Sinologist Henri Maspero also doubted the "Van-Lang State."  (H. Maspero:
 "Van-Lang State," carried in "Collected Papers of French Institute of Far
 East Ancient Studies," No 18)  Dao Duy Anh and some other Vietnamese
 historians shared his doubts.  Dao Duy Anh said:  "The Van-Lang State can
 only be a fabrication."  "We should not rigidly hold that the word 'quoc'
 (state), being the area ruled by Hung-Vuong kings, meant a state in the
 sense that it does today."  (Dao Duy Anh:  "King of An-Duong and the State
 of Au-Lac," Hanoi, 1975, Vietnamese version, pp 37, 35)
 What was especially absurd was that for the purpose of proving the existence
 of the "Van-Lang State," some Vietnamese historians had the effrontery to say
 that the "An (Yin) bandits" whom the "Van-Lang State" fought against were
 troops sent by China's Yin dynasty to attack Vietnam.   (Phan Huy Le and
 others:  "Several Decisive Strategic Battles in the History of the Viet-
 namese Nation," Vietnamese version, p 10; see also "General History of
 Vietnam," p 26)  We may well imagine:   The Yin dynasty was located in the
 central plains of China.  It was so far away from the "Van-Lang State" that
 there were no relations whatsoever between the two.  What caused a war
 between them?  Under the technical conditions at that time, how could the
 Yin troops cross the Changjiang River and the mountain ranges and invade the
 "Van-Lang State"?  Who else besides the fabricators would believe in this
 "invasion"?
 Some Vietnamese historians not only went all out to collect myths and
 legends to fabricate history, but also adopted a capricious, pragmatic

 attitude toward archaeological finds.  For example, they repeatedly said that
 the Dong-Son culture could "testify" to the existence of the "Van-Lang State."
 However, the report on the findings of the Dong-Son culture revealed that
 some copper coins of China's Han dynasty were among the relics unearthed at
 Dong-Son. This revelation was a far cry from their wishful thinking.  There-
 fore, they arbitrarily repudiated the report under the pretext that "the
 method of unearthing the relics was not scientific."  This resort to decep-
 tion was indeed appalling!
 "National Hero" of Aggression and Expansion
 Some Vietnamese historians wildly exaggerated the "military achievements" of
 the Vietnamese feudal kings and generals in wars with foreign countries,
 extolling them to the skies and making them more perfect and taller figures
 than proletarian revolutionaries.  An outstanding example is their extolling
 of Ly Thuong Kiet.  They said:  "In Vietnamese history, Ly Thuong Kiet
 proved himself a man of moral integrity and great ability....   Many people
 were astonished by his achievements in the war against China's Song dynasty."
 (Van Tan:   "In Commemoration of the 900th Anniversary of the Victory of the
 Battle of Nhu Nguyet Giang:  Ly Thuong Kiet and the Cause of Defending and
 Building the Country During the 11th Century," carried in Vietnam's
 HISTORICAL RESEARCH, March-April:1977, No 2, p 7)   "He was a devoted patriot
 cherishing a strong desire for national independence.  He was also an open-
 hearted statesman and able militarist."  They described Ly Thuong Kiet's
 "war of resistance against foreign aggression" as "a great, earthshaking
 war of resistance with many unique characteristics in the Vietnamese history
 of national defense over the past 4,000 years."  They even praised a poem by
 Ly Thuong Kiet as the "first declaration of independence of the Vietnamese
 nation."  ("Several Decisive Strategic Battles in the History of the Viet-
 namese Nation")
 Ly Thuong Kiet was prime minister during the reign of Emperor Nhan-Ton of the
 Ly dynasty in Vietnam.  The Ly dynasty was a rather powerful period in
 Vietnamese history, whereas the contemporary Song dynasty in China was a
 period of weakness in Chinese history.   The Song dynasty was engaged in
 internal struggles against the Liao and Jin local governments of minority
 nationalities in the north and against the Xixia local government in the
 northwest.  Being unable to handle affairs in the south, it adopted an
 "appeasement" policy toward the Vietnamese Ly dynasty in order to keep
 everything "peaceful."  However, cherishing the ambitions of aggression and
 expansion, the Ly feudal rulers took advantage of the weakness of the Song
 dynasty to "match their strength with that of the Song dynasty" and "repeat-
 edly dispatched invading troops to occupy territory."  (Zhang Jingxin:
 "Resistance Against Vietnamese Aggression," Vol 2)  Because Vietnam con-
 tinually sent its troops to invade China and seize Chinese territory by
 piecemeal encroachment, the local officials of the Song dynasty were com-
 pelled to take measures against the Vietnamese invasion.  At this juncture,
 seeing that the Song dynasty was facing many difficulties in carrying out
 the reform put forward by Wang Anshi, the Vietnamese rulers took the oppor-
 tunity to launch a large-scale war of aggression against China under the
 pretext that local Chinese officials were strengthening border defenses.

 Ly Thuong Kiet was supreme commander of this war of aggression.  During the
 time from the end of the 8th year to the beginning of the 9th year of the
 Xining period of the reign of Emperor Shezong of the Song dynasty (1075-
 1076 A.D.), Emperor Nhan-Ton of the Vietnamese Ly dynasty dispatched a large
 army led by Ly Thuong Kiet to invade the border areas in China's Guangdong
 and Guangxi and occupy Qinzhou,'Lianzhou and Yongzhou.  The invading Viet-
 namese troops wantonly burned, killed and looted wherever they went.  In
 Yongzhou alone, because a local official, Su Jian, led the people in a
 dogged resistance, the invading troops commanded by Ly Thuong Kiet perpe-
 trated a massacre, killing "more than 58,000 residents."  In Yongzhou,
 Qinzhou and Lianzhou, they "killed more than 100,000 people," "retreated but
 took with them captives from these three places" and caused great damage.
 ("Complete History of Great Vietnam:  Biographies of Emperors," Vol 3;
 "Outlines of Vietnamese Comprehensive History," Vol 3; and "Continuation of
 'Zi Zhi Chronological History of China,"' Vol 272)  The invading army led by
 Ly Thuong Kiet openly interfered with our country's internal affairs by
 opposing the reform carried out by Wang Anshi.  In every city or township
 which it had invaded, it put up notices stating that the reform would
 "afflict people with suffering, and our army has come to rescue the people."
 ("Outlines of Vietnamese Comprehensive History," Vol 3)  These deeds of naked
 aggression against our country and interference in our country'.s internal
 affairs were historical facts of Ly Thuong Kiet's "punitive expedition to
 China during the Song dynasty."' However, some Vietnamese historians por-
 trayed Ly Thuong Kiet's invasion of our country as a preemptive strike of
 "active self-defense" and "a unique creation" by him.   ("Several Decisive
 Strategic Battles in the History of the Vietnamese Nation")  What absurd
 logic!
 Owing to Ly Thuong Kiet's invasion, the Song dynasty was compelled to launch
 a counterattack and send Guo Kui and Zhao Xie to lead an expedition to Viet-
 nam.  Therefore, the Song dynasty's counterattack in self-defense was a just
 war. According to the historical records of China and Vietnam, when the Song
 army crossed the border and marched to Phu,Lang Giang, which was 35 li from
 the capital,  the Vietnamese army could not resist it and "Emperor Nhan-Ton
 of the Ly dynasty was so daunted that he approached the Song army and nego-
 tiated a surrender, in which he conceded the territories of To Mao Chau, Tu
 Lang Chau, Mon Chau, Lang Chau and Quang Nguyen Chau and returned the cap-
 tives who had been taken from China."  Consequently, "Guo Kui withdrew his
 troops."  ("History of Song Dynasty:  Biography of Emperor Shenzong";
 "Continuation of 'Zi Zhi Chronological History of China,"' Vol 279; "Com-
 plete History of Great Vietnam:  Biographies of Emperors," Vol 3)  After
 suffering this defeat, the "Vietnamese lived in peace" and "did not make
 trouble again, so that it was quiet on China's southern borders for a
 century thereafter."  ("Vietnam" in "General Study of Historical Documents,"
 Vol 330)
 Obviously, the Vietnamese feudal ruler at that time had overestimated his
 strength.  He sent an army to invade China but eventually surrendered when
 the Vietnamese army was defeated by the Chinese army's counterattack.  How-
 ever, this battle was exaggerated by some Vietnamese historians as a "deci-
 sive strategic battle" of resistance against China's "invasion," and called

 it "a battle of great victory at Nhu Nguyet Giang."  Based on the single
 sentence "Ly Thuong Kiet put up defensive works along the river" carried
 in volume three of "Complete History of Great Vietnam," they set up for Ly
 Thuong Kiet, who lived during the 11th century, a rather modernized "defense
 line at Nhu Nguyet Giang" and drew a "sketch of the situation of the Nhu
 Nguyet Giang counterattack."  They also described the troop dispositions and
 movements, the rear services, the joint operations of military and naval
 units, and the leadership given by the supreme command, and summarized Ly
 Thuong Kiet's "strategic thinking," and so forth.   ("Several Decisive
 Strategic Battles in the History of the Vietnamese Nation")  They displayed
 nothing but a sandtable illustrating the military operations of the National
 Defense Ministry of the Le Duan clique against China.  What sort of "histori-
 cal works" these were!
 Ly Thuong Kiet, who was an aggressor, was disguised by some Vietnamese
 historians as a "national hero."  Was this not an attempt to call up the
 soul of a deceased person to serve the Vietnamese authorities' policy of
 aggression and expansion?
 True Features of the Theory That "Vietnam Does Not Have a History of
 Aggression"
 Some Vietnamese historians said nothing about the aggression and expansion
 of the Vietnamese feudal rulers against neighboring countries.  They tried
 in every possible way to defend and exonerate the feudal rulers and describe
 Vietnam's aggression against Kampuchea and Laos as "special friendship."
 According to them, Vietnam was invaded and had never been an invader.  This
 was an out-and-out alteration of history.
 An important characteristic of the feudal Vietnamese society was that rem-
 nants of serfdom prevailed.  Slave labor was widely employed on the large
 farms owned by bureaucrats and aristocrats.   The seizing of slaves was a
 dominant motive of the Vietnamese feudal aristocrats in going in for aggres-
 sion and expansion against another country.                  (Hisanori Wada:  "Ancient
 History of Southeast Asia," chapter 2, section 1)   In the past, they not only
 caused trouble to Chiem-Thanh and other neighboring states but also often
 intruded into Chinese border areas to kidnap local residents, whom they sold
 as slaves.   ("Major Events During the Song Dynasty:  Barbarians"; and "Gen-
 eral Study of Historical Documents," Vol 330)  Territorial expansion was
 another motive of the Vietnamese feudal rulers in invading other countries.
 When the feudal state of Vietnam was founded in the 10th century, its
 territories included only the middle and lower reaches of the Hong Ha River
 and the northern part of today's central Vietnam and was equal to one-
 quarter of today's Vietnamese territories.  The other territories were
 acquired later by encroaching on neighboring countries.
 Chiem-Thanh was the state which bore the brunt of the southward aggression
 and expansion of the Vietnamese feudal rulers.  Also called Champa, it was
 a civilized ancient state different from Vietnam as a nation and in its
 history and culture.  It was founded in the 2d century, much earlier than
 Vietnam.  Its territories lay approximately in the central part of today's

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100270001-8
 Vietnam. All its territories were gradually annexed by Vietnam through con
 tinuous wars of aggression during the period from the middle of the 10th
 century to the end of the 17th century.  The Chiem-Thanh people were cul-
 turally developed and ardently loved freedom.  After losing their country,
 some of them preferred to go to remote mountain areas to live with the
 primitive tribes there than suffer the brutal rule and oppression of the
 Vietnamese.  With regard to the Vietnamese feudal rulers' annexation of
 Chiem-Thanh, some Vietnamese historians called it a "southward advance."
 They also described the wiping out of the Chiem-Thanh nation as "taking in
 a neighboring nation which had a greater enterprising spirit."  (Dao Duy
 Anh:  "Vietnamese Territories in Past Ages," Vietnamese version, p 182)
 They sang the same tune as the old colonialists and imperialists!
 Laos is Vietnam's neighbor on the west.  In ancient times, it was called
 Ai-Lao by the Vietnamese.  There were many small states and tribes in the
 territories of Laos before the 14th century.  They were the objects of
 Vietnamese expansion.  According to the "Complete History of Great Vietnam,"
 during the 3 centuries and more from the Ly dynasty to the Tran dynasty,
 Vietnam launched 13 wars on a considerably large scale against Laos.   In
 August 1479, Vietnam dispatched 180,000 troops to invade Laos, capturing and
 looting its capital Luang Prabang.  In December of the same year, it again
 amassed troops to attack Ban-Man (which is now the Xieng Khouang area in
 Laos).  Cam Cong, chief of Ban-Man, was killed in battle.  The Vietnamese
 aggressor troops destroyed the city of Xieng Khouang by burning it and
 massacred its residents, causing a famine in the area.  "At first, there
 were 90,000'households in Ban-Man.  They were starved.  Only some 2,000
 households survived."  ("History of the Le Dynasty" in "Complete History of
 Great Vietnam")
 At the end of the 17th century, with Vietnam eventually subjugating Chiem-
 Thanh, Trinh-Lap (Kampuchea) became its neighbor to the south.  "Trinh-Lap
 was Chiem-Thanh's neighbor to the south."  (Zhao Rushi:  "Laws of the State
 of Zhenla (Trinh-Lap)" carried in "History of Vassal States," Vol 1) That
 is to say, the southern part of Vietnam today was Kampuchean territory.
 During the "period of the Nguyen princes" preceding the Vietnamese Nguyen
 'dynasty, the Nguyen feudal ruling clique gradually nibbled on Kampuchea and
 by the second half of the 18th century had already annexed half of the
 Kampuchean territories.  After its establishment in 1802, the Nguyen dynasty
 turned the remaining part of Kampuchea into a "protectorate" under Viet-
 namese military occupation.
 While committing aggression against Kampuchea, the Nguyen dynasty continued
 its expansion in Laos.  It dispatched an army to Laos in 1827 and annexed
 two-thirds of the Lao territories in more than a year's time, thereby
 extending Vietnam's western boundaries to across the Truong Son Mountains
 and further to the Mekong River, with Siam on the other side of the river.
 Anti-Chinese Slander Aimed at Altering History
 The Le Duan clique regards socialist China as its biggest obstacle in push-
 ing its regional hegemony.  Therefore, some Vietnamese historians, using the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 past to satirize the present, attack China by every possible means and create
 anti-Chinese public opinion.  Ignoring the facts, they deny that the
 friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples were the
 mainstream in the history of Sino-Vietnamese relations.  They exaggerate
 the contradiction between the Chinese and Vietnamese nations to be the
 principal contradiction in Vietnamese history.  They hold that the contra-
 diction and struggle between the Chinese feudal dynasties on one side and
 the Vietnamese ruling classes and people on the other side were the main
 aspects of Vietnamese history.  They say that Vietnamese history is a
 history of continuous struggle against China.  With utter absurdity, they
 regard opposition to China as the most essential motive force in the
 development of Vietnamese history.
 Contradictions and struggles often occurred between slaves and their owners
 and between peasants and feudal landlords in Vietnam.  According to prelim-
 inary statistics, peasants revolted on more than 300 occasions during the
 period of the feudal society in Vietnam.   It was precisely the struggle for
 production and class struggle waged by the peasants that promoted the
 development of the Vietnamese feudal society and formed the main content of
 Vietnamese history.  However, owing to their eagerness to oppose China, some
 Vietnamese historians have even ignored this rudimentary historical
 knowledge.
 Taking the development of the history of Sino-Vietnamese relations as a
 whole, it was undoubtedly the working people, and not the feudal rulers,
 of China and Vietnam,who played the decisive role.  In ancient times,
 China's advanced production skills and cultural knowledge including the Han
 written language were brought to Vietnam and played a positive role in
 developing the productive forces in Vietnamese society, wiping out the
 surviving elements of the primitive society and pushing the feudal society
 forward.   On the other hand, some farm products and fruits such as sweet
 potato, longan and litchi were brought from Vietnam to China, enriching the
 lives of the Chinese people.  As a result of their long-term contacts, the
 Chinese and Vietnamese people have some common habits and customs.  For
 example, they observe the same traditional festivals, such as the Spring
 Festival,  the Tomb Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival and the Moon Festival.
 What especially cannot be forgotten is that the Chinese and Vietnamese people
 voiced support for each other in their struggles against feudal oppression.
 During the past century in particular, they sympathized with and supported
 each other in their common struggle against colonialism and imperialism.   In
 the hard years during the Vietnamese wars against France and the United
 States, the entire Chinese people gave strong backing to the Vietnamese
 people, the vast Chinese territories became the reliable rear base of the
 Vietnamese people, the Chinese people aided the Vietnamese people in many
 ways, and the struggle of the Vietnamese people also aided the Chinese
 people.  The revolutionary friendship of the Chinese and Vietnamese people
 was indeed cemented with blood.
 With regard to the wars launched by the Chinese feudal rulers against
 foreign countries, it must be admitted that since ancient times, China has
 been a united, multinational country with a large population and vast

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 territories.  Contradictions between nationalities and classes were very
 acute and complicated.  The peasant uprisings and peasant wars in feudal
 Chinese society had few parallels in frequency and scale in world history.
 The resistance put up and struggles launched by the people of various
 nationalities tied the feudal rulers' hands, preventing them from engaging
 in foreign aggression and expansion.  This was also true of China's rela-
 tions with Vietnam in ancient times.
 In the long history of contacts between China and Vietnam, real wars between
 the two countries were very Short in duration and occurred only occasionally.
 Compared with the historical' mainstream of friendly contacts between the
 Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, they were just like a few small tributaries.
 For almost all the time, the Chinese and Vietnamese people maintained
 friendly contacts and got along well with each other.
 We respect historical facts.  We do not deny that some Chinese feudal rulers
 launched wars of aggression against Vietnam; neither do we defend them.
 Historical research should not be separated from concrete historical condi-
 tions.  The Chinese people at that time were powerless because they were
 oppressed by feudal rulers.   The Chinese feudal rulers launched wars of
 aggression against Vietnam and drove large groups of soldiers and workmen
 to "brave the heat of the sun and the attack of miasma" and to die for them.
 Fundamentally, this ran counter to the wishes and interests of the Chinese
 people.  The Chinese people were against it.  Therefore, the Chinese people
 at that time should not be held responsible for this; nor should the Chinese
 people today be required to take historical responsibility for what the
 feudal rulers did.  Similarly, the Vietnamese people should not be held
 responsible for the foreign aggression and expansion launched by the Viet-
 namese feudal rulers in the past.   However, some Vietnamese historians do not
 like this.  They try to seize on the launching of wars against Vietnam by
 Chinese feudal rulers and make an issue of it.  They want the Chinese people
 today to pay the debts of the past feudal rulers..  In this way, they can
 create a historical basis for the Vietnamese authorities' policy of opposing
 and hating China.
 From the several points mentioned above, we can see that with the Le Duan
 'clique embarking on the road of political degeneration, historiography in
 Vietnam today has degenerated into false historiography serving regional
 hegemonism.

 IT IS NECESSARY TO PAY SIMULTANEOUS ATTENTION TO PLANTING AND PROTECTING
 TREES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 7, 1 Apr 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Li Mingfu [2621 2494 4395]]
 [Text]  "The Resolution on Unfolding an All-People Voluntary Tree-Planting
 Movement" adopted by the 4th Session of the 5th NPC points out:  "Planting
 trees everywhere in the country is a great cause for building socialism and
 for benefiting future generations, and is a major strategic measure for
 regulating mountains and rivers and protecting and improving the ecologic
 environment."  In recent years, the broad masses of cadres and people have
 realized, to a certain extent, the significance of planting trees and carry-
 ing out afforestation.  Every year a great deal of manpower and financial
 resources are spent on this task.  The current problem lies in the fact that
 a large number of trees have been planted, but only a small number of them
 survive.  As the masses summed up, no trees can be seen after planting trees
 and no forests can be formed although afforestation has been carried out.
 Luannan County in Tangshan Prefecture, where a good job of planting trees
 was done, is an example.  There, 2.68 million trees were planted in 1977,
 1.34 million of which survived, giving a survival rate of 50 percent; 1.5
 million trees were planted in 1978, 820,000 of which survived, giving a
 survival rate of 54.7 percent; 1.82 million trees were planted in 1979,
 690,000 of which survived, giving a survival rate of 37.9 percent; 2.34
 million trees were planted in 1980, 710,000 of which survived, giving a
 survival rate of 30.3 percent; 1.66 million trees were planted in 1981,
 659,000 of which survived, giving a survival rate of 39.7 percent.  A total
 number of 10 million trees have been planted in the last 5 years in this
 county, 4.219 million of which have survived, giving a survival rate of 42.2
 percent.  Besides the low survival rate, the conservation rate and the rate
 of growth into useful timber were even lower.  This mainly resulted from the
 tendency of laying stress on planting trees but, neglecting tree protection.
 The neglect to tend trees can be found in the following three aspects:
 1) Owing to the view of putting,. completion of assignments above everything
 else, some localities are only concerned about the number of trees planted
 and disregard the survival of these trees.  2) Perfected measures are not
 taken to protect trees.  The seedlings are eaten by pigs and goats, but no
 one assumes responsibility.  3) The responsibility system in forestry pro-
 duction has not been established in many localities and the forestry

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 policies have not been put into effect.  The initiative of the masses in
 planting trees has not been aroused.  Unless the above problems are solved,
 forestry production can never be rapidly developed.
 Practice in many localities shows that, as in developing agricultural pro-
 duction, success in planting trees and conducting afforestation must rely
 on implementing correct policies and making use of science.  In order to do
 a good job of planting trees and carrying out afforestation, to effectively
 raise the rates of survival, conservation and timber formation and to
 realize the goal of making the land of our country green, we should, first
 of all, take further steps to implement the forestry policies that trees
 planted by the state are owned by the state, those planted by communes or
 production teams are owned respectively by them, and those planted in com-
 mon are owned in common.  The trees planted by commune members around their
 houses or at places designated by production teams should always be owned by
 individual members. Wherever the policies of fixing farm output quotas for
 each household and assigning the households full responsibility for task
 completion are implemented, those scattered trees and forest belts near farm
 fields formerly owned by collectives can all be contracted to households or
 individuals.  No matter what kind of production responsibility system is
 adopted, the'ownership of trees cannot be changed, tree farms'and seedling
 nurseries owned by communes or production teams cannot be broken up or
 weakened.
 Second, various forms of the responsibility system in forestry production
 should be conscientiously implemented.  Attention should be paid to local
 special conditions and the responsibility system should take a form that
 most of the masses are willing to accept.   It is necessary to contract out
 the existing forests owned by collectives, particularly forests stretching
 over a wide area and backbone forests, to full-time personnel specially
 assigned to protect trees.  Small areas of scattered trees and forests can
 be contracted out by fixing a price for households or individuals.  Measures
 can be taken to preserve the value of forests, to fairly dividing benefits
 in proportion to the increase in value.  In the future, trees can be planted
 in a unified plan, afforestation work can be divided and assigned to each
 household.  While leaving the ownership of forests with production teams,
 responsibility for forest management should be assigned to individuals, with
 profits shared by the production team and the individual.  It is imperative
 to lay emphasis on the quality of planting trees.  Survival should be
 actually guaranteed as a part of the assignments for planting trees.
 Third, perfected organizations should be established and scientific measures
 should be taken for protecting forests and planting trees.  The past experi-
 ence and lessons whereby a large number of trees were planted, but only a
 small number survived, and an even smaller number grew into forests with
 useful timber, should be conscientiously summed up.  Great efforts should be
 made to carry out afforestation scientifically and to take good care of
 forests.  In particular, we should do a good job in selecting tree strains
 suited to the land, nursing good and strong seedlings, preparing the soil
 with sufficient base of fertilizer, planting trees carefully and in rational
 density, and tending and protecting trees for a long time.  Organizations for

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100270001-8
 tending forests should be established and perfected in places where such
 organizations do not exist.  Systems of rewards and penalties should be
 laid down on a feasible basis, so as to fully arouse the initiative of the
 personnel in charge of tending and protecting forests and to actually
 guarantee the survival and growth of trees.  At the same time, rewards
 should,be granted to people who plant a large number of trees with high
 rates of survival, conservation and timber-formation.
 Fourth, in the future, while counting numbers of trees planted, the depart-
 ments concerned should pay more attention to counting the number of trees
 that survive.  Assignments in tree planting and methods of rewards and
 penalties should take the number that survive as the standard.
