 The central goals of China's leadereh'p are stabilization of the economy
 and pursuit of the "four Modernizations," and stabilization demands an
 austerity that appears to rule out large purchases of military equipment and
 technology over the next few years.  Moreover, because the military has the
 lowest priority within the modernization program, we expect that purchases of
 military-related items will be few and highly se-ective during the early
 1980s.  Those items that China actually buys `ror. the United States will be
 only a tinny fraction of her "shopping list" and of the lists of items proposed
 for sale by US companies.
 Cbine's Limited Objectives for Acquiring Military Technology
 China's strategy for developing a science and technology base for
 military applications continues to emphasize indigenous efforts, supple-dented
 by selected application of Western design features and engineering practices
 and by Judicious acquisition of critical Western technologies for, speciric
 applications.  This approach has been dictated by constraints in China's
 financial, technical, and resource bases, and by the leadership's, desire to
 avoid recreating that dependency upon outside powers that bound China in the
 1950s.
 REVIEW IN MAY.2001
 DERIVED FROM 9D(3.3)
 The mpst recent phase of China's quest for modernization began following
 the fall of the Gang of Four in 1976 with ambitious plans for rapid growth in
 industry and agriculture.   5y late 1978, it became apparent that such plans
 exceeded the physical and economic resources available, and many programs were
 cut back or cancelled.  In 1979, China entered a "Period of Readjustment"--
 originally to last three, but now lengthened to five or more years--intended
 to provide the basis upon which a more measured modernization pr9gram could
 succeed.  The goal of the readjustment is to increase production of electric
 power, expand the number of competent technicians, and limit spending of
 foreign exchange so that critical technologies from abroad can be more readily
 absorbed and production put on a more test-efficient basis by the mid-1980s,
 Finances always have been one of China's weakest links.   Even before the
 readjustment period, deals under negotiation with the West often were delayed
 or broken off by Chinese inability to pay.   The, economists in China's top
 leadership realized in 1979 that even the relatively limited purchases from
 abroad could not be absorbed successfully within the economy and were
 depleting the PRC's modest foreign exchange assets.   For these reasons, the
 leadership has tightened its control over economic activities previously
 decentralized and has cancelled long-term projects and expensive deals that
 will not contribute to China's ability to produce exportable items.  Moreover,
 reduced the military's budget for 1981 by a similar or higher percentage.
 We do not yet know whether the PLA's share of the budget cut will affect
 Spersonnel, operations and maintenance, training, construction, procurement, or
 RDT&E.  If the cuts fall most heavily in the last category, we can expect
 defense modernization to assume a very slow pace indeed.  China's leaders
 probably intend to invest as much as possible-in their industrial and
 technical base over the next three to five years with the hope that, by the
 late 1960s, Chinese indus    will be able to supply some pieces of new
 equipment to the PLA. 77
 Despite China's continuing budgetary and financial problems, the PRC will
 maintain interest in advanced foreign technology Iliac meets its highest
 priority military needs.  Chinese "interest," however, does not necessarily
 indicate a willingness to buy.  As a general framework for understanding PRC
 needs and ability to pay for military items, we note that China generally
 prefers:
 ?  Acq firing technology rather than end-items.
 ?  Purchasing items that have civilian as well as military use.
 Gaining an ability to produce items that can be exported to earn
 hard currency or reduce dependence on imports.
 The Chinese will not buy items of solely milita' ' value unless they:
 ?  Help fill one of China's major defense gaps.
 ?  Far exceed China's ability to manufacture or develop, or
 Can be used as prototypes for later serial production. F
 Priority of Chinese Needs And Potential Soviet Responses
 China's military deficiencies are many and its need for new and improved
 equipment is great, but civilian economists in China's top leadership
 emphasize the need for belt-,tightening in the procurement of weapons and
 equipment to achieve a more balanced economy.  Accordingly, the Chinese high
 comm4nd is concentrating on felling only the most serious gaps in PLA
 capabilit,es.
 The Soviets would engage in "worst case" analysis of any military-related
 sales to China and would interpret any US move, however modest, to help China
 strengthen its defense as further "proof" of a de facto "alliance" between
 Washington and Beijing.  The degree of outrage in the Kremlin would depend on
 The site of the sale.
 ?  The nature of the equipment or technology to be transferred. and
 Soviet options in response to transfers are, however, limited so long as US-
 Soviet relations remain strained and the Soviets consider military action
 The sale of any equipment that--to the Soviet mind--could be used by the
 Chinese to upgrade their strategic forces would be of the greatest concern to
 the Kremlin.  Examples range from components that could conceivably be used in
 an ICBM guibance system to equipment that might enhance Chinese ASW        '
 capabilities an& thus allow China to better protect its SSBNs.  To attempt to
 forestall US wles to China, the Soviets will warn of "dire consequences" and
 encourage media coverage characterizing such sales as destabilizing.     The
 intent will be to induce US allies--some of whom are uneasy about the budding
 Sino-US security relationship--to dissuade us from engaging in such
 transactions." Moscow also will claim that thq United States has much more to
 gain by cooperating with the USSR than by selling arms and defense-related
 technology to China.
 If any major sale occurs, the Soviets will choose one of two broad
 options: to redouble. their initiatives for arms control talks with the West,
 ,or to increase their 'defense effortsand militancy on the assumption that a
 S.ino-US "alliance" isI unavoidable.  The USSR might well adopt amore truculent
 attitude toward the Chinese while pressing harder for arms cont*ol agreements
 with the West, hoping that such initiatives would complicate US efforts to
 work outa closer relationship with China and make Beijing unhappy w{th the
 limited results of itt opening to the West.  The Soviets presumably w,iuld
 iesitate h close out options for bargaining on arms control, particularly in
 view of their strained economy and present preoccupation with events in Poland   --?~
 and Afghanistan..   In any event, the Kremlin's primary interest will be tc

 in relations with the West,
 The Soviets are most likely to take strong negative action--rather than
 merely to protest-if they believe that the ::5 is assisting  :r z..ina's    ?,.    -
 strategic, weapons development.  The most likely response in this case wouAd'be
 a harder line in strategic arms negotiations--claiming that Soviet
 considerations are nod greater due to the enhanced Chinese threat--accompani?1&
 by a further buildup of the USSR's strategic forces facing both East and
 West.  A.more extreme action would be to threaten to'break.off existiagrarm"s
 control negotiations with the US, including an unwillingness to resume SSALT
 negotiations.  Though somewhat less likely, the Soviets could declare previous
 ?US-Soviet agreements on arms control issues--for exampl@, the ABM treaty
 signed in }972-null and void under the present circumstances.  Then, to,), the
 Soviets mht conclude, that they? now had less reason to avoid direct conflict
 with the  nited States, and stamp their aldto revolitibnary forces--
 especially in Centrpl America.
 Second on the list of Soviet concerns would be US sales of any materiel
 that-the Chinese could use to significantly offset the USSR's advantages
 gained through strengthening its conventional forces opposite China over the
 past 15 years.  Many of the items being considered--if not already approved--
 come under this heading.  The most ominous examples from the Soviet point of
 view are among ground forces eouipment--such us an infantry fighting  ve!:itle
 and armored personnel carrier--but the USSR prdoably woald.be almost as upset
 over the sale of radars, communications geat.for improving China's battlefield
 management capabilities, or materiel that enhanced its ability to collect
 int?.lligence by technical means.  Moscow would vehemently protest the sale of
 such major items to China, and it probably would both take enhanced Chinese
 military capability into account in future force deployments in Siberia and
 seek to ?strengthen its military relatit.ship with Hanoi.  The Kremlin also
 would redouble its efforts to convince China, Japan, ar.d other interested
 parties to adopt the Soviet proposal on confidence-building mers-res for the
 Far East, though the Soviets would not want to be seen as barrajning from a
 The Soviets would be less concerned about other sales--of general
 industrial items or equipment that, while having some indirect military value,
 would have no immediate, direct impact on the Sino-Soviet military balance.
 Nonetheless, Moscow would be apprehensive about the cumulative effect of such
 sales, particularly those that eroded its technological edge over Beijing, and
 about how general modernization might add to the threat that China could pose
 by the year 2000.  Consequently,. the Soviets would protest e*en sales of
 general dual-use items, if only to dissuade other Western countries from
 proceeding with similar transactions.   The Soviets also might invoke
 sanctions against US companies--provided that the USSR had access to a%ernate?
 sources of supply and markets elsewhere in the world--to make the US more    (
 aware of the economic and political cost of selling arms and defense-related
 technology to Ch..na.   Finally, Most iw probably would be more upset by grants

 seems relatively small, and we believe that sales will be few.   We judge that
 China's interest in purchasing US space technology also is slight.
 Aircraft and Avionics
 From the "B" list. From ~hina's perspective, the most advantageous deal
 is McDonnell's offer to coproduce the PC-9/80.   In addition to developing an
 ability to produce a modern and urgently needed transport aircraft for
 domestic use, China would acquire an FAA-certified production facility and
 much new technical and managerial expertise in the production of aircraft.
 The, deal evidently has been approved by the highest officials in China but.is
 being held in abeyance due to lack of funds.   If and when the necessary $300
 million becomes available, we believe that China will proceed with this
 program.  F--]
 Other deals in the "approved" column include technical data,
 specifications, and turboshaft engines for use in helicopters.  China needs
 turbine-engine helicopters--it can produce only the piston- n  ne Soviet
 MI-4--for both commercial and military purposes.
 Helicopters are not as urgently needed as?are fixed-win   r      rt

 Moscow would be upset about sales of most of the aircraft and avionics
 items.  It would worry about the long-term impact of the DC-9/80 deal but
 would be even more apprehensive about the implications of a few of the other
 items in this category, such as helicopter engines, C-130 aircraft, and CH-47
 or 500}O helicopters, because of their piny nilal contribution to China's
 only to a long-term improvement in pilot skills.
 The Chinese appear to have an insatiable appetite--arising from a great
 need--for US compbters and computer technology.  Many US manufacturers have
 China has a high priority for acquiring turnkey plants, equipment, and
 processes for producing integrated circuits (iCs).  The low yields of Chinese-
 madie ICs hinder progress in the computer field and adversely affect. China's
 ability      ass produce critical, military-related microelectronics
 items.
 Moscow almost certainly suspects that China will use some of the
 computers obtained from the United States to improve the command and control
 of its strategic missile force and ocher. elements of the military arsenal.
 Soviet "worst case" analysis, presumably would not allow the Kremlin to be
 "misled" by the relatively. small size of the deals under consideration or by
 US references to the limited capabilities of the items in question.   Even if
 the Soviets accept such statements, they will worry that China will find a way
 to upgrade the computers and use them to support the strategic weapons
 Ra dares
 Provision of radars to the Chinese would help to improve their air
 defense capabilities, which now are seriously deficient.  Low altitude air
 surveillance within China is spotty, and coverage beyond the northern border

 products are as much as can be hoped for now.  If Beijing purchased in
 quantity both radars and data handling systems to process information acquired
 Also on the "offered" list were several sets of ground surveillance
 radars (GSRs).  The Chinese do possess an early model Soviet GSR--the PORK
 TROUGH--which can detect vehicles at several thousand meters and is used
 mainly as a spotting device for artillery units.  The PORK TROUGH is only
 sparsely deployed,
 US sales of radars to China would provoke an intense protest from Moscow,
 because the Soviets know that such equipment will offset some of the progress
 that the Soviets have made over the past 15 years in improving their ability
 to strike China from the air.  Ground surveillance radars might draw a more
 subdued response, although the Soviets will be concerned that such equipment
 would help improve China's readiness against a conventional ground attack.
 The Soviets will protest vehemently if the US sells China any EW equipment,
 because the Soviets wouldceive-such equipment as enhancing China's overall
 Weee strong prospects for a PRC attempt to arrange a licensing or
 coproduction deal in communications equipment.
 Moscow would be very udhappy about the sale of military communications
 gear to China because, such sales would help the PLA improve its battle
 management capabilities significantly.  Although such sales might not, by
 themselves, make, the Soviets more apprehensive about the danger of a Chinese
 attack in the Soviet Far East, they would add to concern. about a second
 Chinese attack on Vietnam, which could--in turn--involve the USSR in an
 Ground Forces Equipment
 Serious, Chinese attempts to purchase--at least in quantity--items listed
 in this category seem unlikely.  We note that the only approved ("B" list)
 items for China include infrared detection equipment and presumably some
 technology,
 significantly mechanizing its huge (3.5 million) ground forces, China almost
 certainly will show greater interest in heavy trucks--for moving troops,

 equipment that could support the ground forces.
 counter superior Soviet armored units.   The Soviets might respond. by further
 strengthening their military forces in Siberia and the Soviet Far East.
 Space Technology and General Industrial Items
 China's interest in, and ability to pay for, these two categories of
 items are mixed.  Although the Chinese may have a genuine interest in advanced
 space technology for applications beyond communications or intelligence
 collection, Beijing recently announced that China's manned space program will
 have to wait until the.1990s.
 ,
 Despite the recently-announced cancellations of whole-plant purchases and
 related tilt away from heavy industries and metallurgy toward light industries
 and export activities, we see most items on the General Industrial list as
 remaining attractive to the Chinese.
 Major Soviet concern will stem from Moscow's view that any sales
 involving space technology probably will help China develop a reconnaissance
 satellite system.  General industrial items, however, will be viewed as having
 no direct impact on the present military balance in East Asia and thus
 probably draw only mild complaints.  However, even sales of general items will
 cause some apprehension in Moscow, mainly concerning the cumulative
 contribution to helping China develop its economy so that it eventually could
 support. a thorough modernization of the armed forces.  Moreover, Moscow's
 eagerness to dissuade other-countries from following the-US lead in sales to
 China probably will motivate it to threaten trade sanctions against U5
