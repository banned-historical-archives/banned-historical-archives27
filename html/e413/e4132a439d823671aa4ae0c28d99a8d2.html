 Spain:  Talking Points for the DCI
 Felipe Gonzalez and his Socialist Party won a landslide victory in the
 legislative elections in 1982 (202 of 350 seats) by campaigning on a centrist
 platform that drew support from moderate constituents.  After a year in power,
 Gonzalez shows every sign of holding to the moderate course he charted shortly
 after taking office.  Many of the Socialists' domestic goals -- curbing
 terrorism, strengthening public education, reorganizing the military, and
 completing the regional autonomy process -- involve Iona term programs, and
 Madrid is tackling them slowly and deliberately.
 In dealing with Spain's economic problems, the Socialists are following
 conservative policies aimed at lifting the economy out of a five-year slump.
 Madrid reckons that if it can achieve an average rate of real GDP growth of
 about 3 percent over the next three years, it can make some headway in
 lowering its 17-percent unemployment rate.  The high level of unemployment may
 prompt calls by the Communists and some labor unions to reflate the economy,
 but we think Gonzalez is strong enough to resist.  Since exports must provide
 most of the impetus for economic growth, Madrid has focused its export
 promotion campaign on the US rather than Western Europe, where only an anemic
 recovery is likely.  US.protective measures against Spanish exports are thus
 likely to draw more critical attention than in the past.  Meanwhile, the
 Minister of Economics and Finance has blamed US monetary policy for high
 Spanish interest rates and sagging investment in order to deflect criticism
 away from domestic policies.  In fact, Madrid began to boost interest rates
 last year as a means of stimulating capital inflows, promoting saving, and
 reducing inflation.
 Foreign policy is still in flux.  Gonzalez emphasizes that Spain is in
 the Western camp, but he also places somewhat more emphasis on independence
 than previous Spanish leaders.  The government is negotiating membership in
 the EC, and wrestling with its status vis-a-vis NATO.  Gonzalez acted on his
 campaign pledge and froze NATO military integration pending a referendum on
 the issue.  He now appears inclined to remain in NATO, but faces the difficult
 task of convincing the majority of Spaniards who remain wary of membership.
 Gonzalez has made clear that failure to get into the EC would make it
 extremely difficult to sell NATO in Spain.  Latin America and the Middle East
 are areas of special concern to the Socialists for historical and ideological
 reasons.  Gonzalez's analysis of the situation in Central America differs
 somewhat from the US, but his public criticism is tempered by his strong
 desire to maintain smooth relations with the United States.  Although the
 Spanish are pro-Arab, they are looking for a way to establish relations with

 I                                         I
 The Prime Minister still retains a relatively large base of support, but
 there are signs that the honeymoon with his traditional rivals may be coming
 to an end.  Since September, the government has clashed with the Church over
 abortion and education reform, heard grumblings from the military over
 continuing terrorism and government meddling in military affairs, and faced
 some unrest from farmers and workers (mostly Communist inspired).  None of the
 problems are insurmountable, but they signal increased trouble ahead for a
 government that so far has led a charmed existence.
 1.  The Socialist government avoided comment on the INF issue until last
 May, when Prime Minister Gonzalez visited Bonn and publicly supported
 deployment.
 --  Gonzalez's remarks were made in return for Kohl's agreement to
 support Spanish entry into the EC.
 --  In recent weeks both Gonzalez and Foreign Minister Moran have
 reaffirmed their "understanding" of the decision to deploy new
 missiles, with Moran adding that the current disequilibrium favors
 Status of Relations with NATO
 1.  Despite the Socialists' opposition to NATO during the election
 campaign, Gonzalez has slowly come to appreciate the political and military
 benefits of membership and personally favors continued Spanish
 participation.  However, he must overcome substantial political obstacles
 before the government can reaffirm Spanish membership in NATO.  Participation
 in NATO's integrated military command is a more remote prospect.
 --  The Spanish electorate is largely uninformed about NATO and Western
 defense issues, and a substantial proportion of Socialist party
 members oppose ties to the Alliance.  We believe Gonzalez and Vice
 Prime Minister Guerra are pursuing a policy of deliberate ambiguity
 on relations with NATO, both to buy time and to enable the government
 to conduct an educational campaign prior to the long-promised
 referendum.
 --  The first test of Gonzalez's ability to sway his party's opinion will
 come in October 1984 with the Socialist Party congress.  He expects
 strong opposition from party members.
 --  Next, the Prime Minister will face the.referendum on NATO, which will
 not be held until at least mid-1985.  There are signs that Gonzalez
 may try to blur the issue by phrasing the referendum question in an
 ambiguous way.  In any event, he probably will not confront the issue
 of military integration.  Gonzalez has said the essential issue is
 membership, and he apparently believes military integration can
 evolve over time

 2. We think Gonzalez's ability to turn the public and his party around
 on NATO will depend in part on where Spain's application to the EC stands at
 the time of the referendum.
 Talks have dragged on for four years and further negotiations have
 become linked to EC efforts to reform Community spending on
 agriculture and the EC budget in general.
 The linkage of Spain's NATO membership to its drive for EC membership
 presents problems for the US.  For the past two years, some EC
 members have maintained that because it is in the US interest to have
 Spain in NATO and the EC, Washington should forego compensation
 demands for any loss of trade incurred as a result of Spain's entry
 into the EC.
 --  The political will exists within the EC to bring Spain into the
 Community, but even a prolonged delay could damage Spain's ties to
 NATO.  We believe that in the unlikely event Spain fails to get into
 the EC, Gonzalez might consider withdrawing from NATO.
 Gibraltar
 3.  The UK-Spanish dispute over the sovereignty of Gibraltar is also a
 factor in the NATO and EC equation.
 --  Gonzalez linked progress on Gibraltar with NATO membership early in
 his tenure, trying to bring Allied pressure on Britain to resume
 negotiations.
 The Thatcher government says that Spain cannot join the EC unless it
 removes all restrictions on movement between Spain and the Rock.
 The Spanish are reluctant to lift restrictions either without a
 guarantee that Britain will negotiate the issue of sovereignty, or
 before Spain joins the Community.  Once in the EC, the restrictions
 will have to be removed.
 Resolution of the sovereignty question is unlikely in the short term,
 but the two governments appear to be on warmer terms recently and
 have set up committees of experts to discuss the areas of
 disagreement.  The talks may provide a face-saving way for Spain to
 open the border, thus removing one of the sticking points in the EC
 Central America
 1.  Cultural, linguistic, and historical ties make Latin America an area
 of special concern to Spaniards.
 --  Both the right and left in Spain desire expanded cultural and
 commercial links to the region.

 In addition, the Socialists' ideologically-rooted beliefs lead them
 to also champion human rights and national liberation movements.
 They believe that a more assertive Spanish-speaking bloc of nations
 can help end bipolarity in international politics and ease East-West
 2.  Central America has proved a vexing problem for Gonzalez, who had
 hoped to play a more active role in the region both to bolster support at home
 for his government and to burnish his credentials as an international
 statesman.
 Most Spaniards believe the conflicts in the area stem more from
 indigenous social and economic inequalities than from foreign
 intervention.
 The government's interest in the area stems largely from Gonzalez's
 participation in the Socialist International.  In addition to
 numerous visits to the region, Gonzalez played an intermediary role
 in 1981 between then Secretary of State Haig and various regional
 leftist groups.
 Gonzalez has called for the withdrawal of both US and Cuban military
 advisers and has given strong support to the Contadora peace
 initiative.
 --  The government still formally supports the Sandinistas but Gonzalez
 has a realistic appreciation of the situation in Nicaragua
 --  Moreover, recent revelation of Basque terrorist links to the
 Sandinistas has created public pressure in Spain for a weakening of
 ties to Managua.  Gonzalez reportedly may move in that direction, but
 he will want to avoid the impression of being stampeded by foreign
 and domestic pressure.  We therefore doubt that he will move until
 the current publicity dies down.
 3.  We doubt that Spain's involvement in Central American affairs will go
 much beyond the rhetorical level.
 --  Gonzalez recognizes that an overly ambitious diplomacy could invite
 embarrassment.  For example, he will not offer to serve as a mediator
 unless all the parties involved in the conflicts agree.
 --  He also does not want to damage Spain's carefully cultivated
 relations with the US.  After publicly criticizing US policy during a
 visit to Latin America this spring, Gonzalez suggested publicly and
 privately that he would avoid getting in Washington's way in the
 region.

 Terrorism
 1. Many observers in Spain thought that the new Socialist government
 would be better qualified than its predecessors to resolve the country's
 terrorist problem, which revolves largely around the Basque terrorists' (ETA)
 24-year-old campaign for independence from.Spain.
 -- The assumption was that only the Socialists, who sympathized with the
 anti-Franco motives of the pre-1975 ETA, could successfully negotiate
 with the terrorists.
 Gonzalez fed these hopes indirectly by citing resolution of the
 Basque problem as one of his government's top priorities.
 2. The optimism was soon shattered by stepped up terrorist violence that
 led the Socialist government to launch an all out offensive against ETA.
 -- Basque Regional President Carlos Garaicoechea's attempt to bring all
 parties together  -- the Socialists, the. Basque Regional Party (PNV),
 and terrorist-linked Herri Batasuna (HB) -- failed when HB refused to
 participate unless there was live press coverage of the
 proceedings.
 Garaicoechea tried to revive the discussions, but the Socialists
 demanded a cease fire by with ETA before talking.
 ETA responded with more violence, and Garaicoechea -- lambasting both
 the Socialists' alleged intransigence and ETA's provocations --
 3.                      The government in the meantime has enjoyed some notable successes
 against ETA, but the recent killing of a kidnapped Army captain, following the
 murders of three civilians, has raised new questions about the effectiveness
 of the government's program.
 Massive demonstrations were held throughout Spain opposing terrorism
 and calling for tougher government action.
 Tension in the military was reportedly high over the incident.  The
 military has been grumbling louder recently about the ineffectivness
 of the government's program but, when pressed, admits the government
 is doing about as much as it can.  The government is hampered by
 legal restrictions and lack of support from the Basque regional
 government (which faces regional elections next year  and France
 which is a safehaven for the terrorists).

 4.  Recognizing that repeated terrorist attacks against the military
 could spur some officers to take matters into their own hands, the government
 has just announced some stiffer measures.
 Interior Minister Barronuevo asked the courts to be more aggressive
 in prosecuting terrorist-related offenses, including harboring,
 protecting, defending, or in any way showing favoritism toward
 terrorist organizations.
 --  The government has beefed up security at prisons where terrorists are
 held.
 --  Security has been improved for armed forces personnel and
 installations.
 --  Madrid is also likely to renew efforts to tighten movement across the
 French border to prevent Basque terrorists from taking sanctuary so

 Canada: Trudeau's Peace Initiative
 Summary
 Prime Minister Trudeau says his peace initiative is designed
 to give a "jolt of political energy" to disarmament negotiations
 between the United States and the Soviet Union.  Trudeau's plan
 includes a Five-Power Disarmament Conference, a new Western
 proposal at the Mutual and Balanced'Force Reduction talks,
 revitalization of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, emphasis
 on high level attendance at the Conference on Disarmament in
 Europe in January, and several confidence building measures.  All
 these measures are directed toward improving channels of
 communication between Washington and Moscow, but Trudeau is
 seeking to involve other countries, especially Canada's smaller
 NATO allies and Third World nations and organizations, in the
 disarmament process.
 Since beginning his peace campaign in late October, Trudeau
 has presented his proposals to the leaders of France, Belgium,
 the Netherlands, the Vatican, Italy, West Germany, Great Britain,
 Japan, China,  as well as to a Commonwealth Conference.   His
 personal envoy has briefed Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on the
 plan in Moscow.  Trudeau's initiative has elicited a sympathetic
 hearing from all quarters but has won no specific commitments.
 Trudeau professes to be satisfied with the results, but admits
 that the only consensus he has discovered is a general belief
 that the superpowers must take the first steps toward
 disarmament.
 Despite the lackluster response, we believe that Trudeau
 will press forward with his initiative.  He has been an outspoken
 advocate of disarmament for more than 20 years, and his present
 campaign reflects a personal commitment to arms control.  He may
 also be interested in boosting the popularity of his government
 and party, but we believe he will persist even if polls show no
 improvement in the Liberal Party's electoral prospects.

 Trudeau believes that Washington and Moscow each have some
 responsibility for the recent breakdown of the Geneva talks and
 thinks that both will have to alter their bargaining position
 before arms control negotiations can be resumed.  We expect,
 therefore, that in the period before the CDE convenes, Trudeau
 will try to orchestrate "an elaborate exercise in global public
 pressure" on Moscow and Washington in an effort to get arms
 control talks started again.
 Background
 Trudeau's current peace initiative probably had its
 beginnings at the Williamsburg Summit last Ma
 Following the KAL shootdown on
 1 September, Trudeau created a high-level government task force
 to review existing peace plans and draft a disarmament scheme
 that he could present when he felt the time was right.  The task
 force apparently finished its work in early October and Trudeau
 sketched out the resulting plan in a speech on 27 October.
 Major Aspects of Trudeau's Peace Plan
 1.   Five Power Conference on Limiting Nuclear Weapons -
 Trudeau believes, according to US Embassy officials, that a
 conference involving the United States, the Soviet Union, France,
 Great Britain, and the People's Republic of China should be held
 to establish fixed ratios -- similar to those created by the
 Washington Naval Conference of 1921-22 -- for national strategic
 forces.  Fixed ratios, he argues, would lend overall
 predictibility to the international strategic balance, make it
 easier to set quantitative ceilings and increase chances for arms
 reductions. Trudeau views a Five-Power Conference as a
 complement to INF and START talks.   Such a conference would
 include the following specifics:
 A.  Procedural
 --  The conference would be preceded by working group
 consultations to set an agenda, terms of reference,
 and guidelines.
 --  Working group meetings would be convened without
 substantive preconditions.
 --  The conference would be conducted on a state-to-
 state and not a bloc-to-bloc basis with each nation
 retaining a veto over any substantive matter.

 '                I                     I
 B.   Substantive
 --   The conference's overall goal would be to establish
 "fixed ratios" for the national strategic forces of
 the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain,
 France, and China.  To accommodate ongoing arms
 control efforts, the creation of "precise ratios"
 may have to await the outcome of the INF and START
 talks.
 --   To secure superpower agreement, the ratios
 established by the conference must reflect "de jure
 equality" of the strategic forces of the US and the
 USSR.
 --   The "unit of account" for the conference probably
 would be "warheads and strategic nuclear
 vehicles." This would:
 Correspond to Western and Soviet practice in
 START and INF.
 -       Encourage a move to single warhead systems and
 prevent countries from placing larger numbers
 of warheads on launchers to circumvent the
 agreement.
 Avoid handicapping the British, French, and
 Chinese strategic forces which currently have
 less MIRV potential.
 --  All parties would be entitled to withdraw from the
 agreement given adequate notification in situations
 of perceived threat to their national security   .
 --  Qualitative modernization would be allowed if it did
 not violate the negotiated ratios or subsequent arms
 control agreements coming out of the START or INF
 talks.
 --  Specific numerical totals probably would be attached
 to the agreed ratios to preclude quantitative
 increases.
 --  All land, sea, and air-based systems deemed by the.
 negotiators to be strategic in nature should be
 included.

 Forces of less than intercontinental range
 could be deployed wherever the parties
 desired, subject to restrictions imposed by
 other arms control agreements.  Such an
 arrangement would force a tradeoff between
 intercontinental and theater forces.   In
 Trudeau's view, this might dampen incentives
 for an arms race in the European Theater,
 while allowing some asymmetries in theater
 deployments.
 2.  Conventional Forces - Trudeau proposes a positive and
 innovative response to the MBFR proposal put forth by the Soviets
 in June. The West's response, he believes, should be followed by
 ministerial level talks in Vienna,  Trudeau has been vague about
 the content of the response, but he has expressed interest in the
 ideas for tradeoffs (data versus verification)  recently developed
 by the West Germans.  The Prime Minister apparently does not
 accept the argument that conventional capabilities will increase
 as progress is made toward nuclear disarmament.  Trudeau recently
 said in the Canadian Parliament, for example,  that the purpose of
 nuclear disarmament "is not to make the world safe for
 conventional warfare."
 3.   Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  (NPT)  - Trudeau is
 seeking to add additional signatories to the NPT by creating a
 strong link between disarmament and development aid to the Third
 World.  This follows the lead taken earlier this year by French
 President Mitterrand who suggested that the resources saved
 through disarmament should be directed toward providing economic
 aid to the Third World.
 4.   Conference on Disarmament in Europe  (CDE)  - Trudeau
 views the CDE scheduled to begin in January in Stockholm as an
 important first step in creating an atmosphere conducive to
 disarmament in Europe.  The Canadian position at the CDE probably
 will focus on promoting the full implementation of the confidence
 building measures NATO has agreed to sponsor.
 5.   Confidence Building Measures - Trudeau is advocating a
 ban on high altitude anti-satellite systems because they could be
 used to attack global communications essential for crisis
 management.  He also is seeking an agreement to improve
 verifiability by limiting the mobility of present ICBMs and
 requiring all future weapons systems to be fully verifiable by
 national technical means.

 International Reactions to Trudeau's Initiative
 Since his speech in October, Trudeau has carried this plan
 to the leaders of six West European nations, Pope John Paul II,
 the Commonwealth Conference in New Dehli, and top Chinese leaders
 in Beijing.   In addition, Trudeau's personal disarmament envoy,
 Geoffrey Pearson, has discussed the plan with Soviet Foreign
 Minister Gromyko in Moscow.
 Although Trudeau has attempted to put the best face possible
 on the reactions, he and his aides have been extremely closed-
 mouthed about the details of discussions to date.  US Embassy and
 media reporting from the various capitals indicates that, in
 general, Trudeau was politely received but the leaders avoided a
 commitment to his plan.
 France          President Mitterrand and Foreign Minister
 Cheysson, although critical of the initiative's
 timing, volunteered moral support for Trudeau's
 plan but did not endorse any of its
 specifics.  The French did indicate they might
 consider attending Five-Power "discussions" to
 explore the idea of a formal conference.
 Mitterrand also repeated his previously stated
 conditions for French attendance at a formal
 conference.
 Netherlands       Prime Minister Lubbers supported the thrust of
 Trudeau's plan, but urged him not to
 concentrate on the Five-Power Conference
 idea.  Lubbers advised Trudeau to focus instead
 on "improving the climate in the conventional
 arms field" by stressing the importance of a
 new MBFR proposal.
 Belgium           The Belgians were the most enthusiastic West
 European supporters of Trudeau's initiative.
 Belgian Foreign Minister Tindemans said his
 .government was "extremely pleased" by the
 effort and described Trudeau's plan as "the
 best means" the West now has for reopening a
 serious dialogue with Moscow.
 Italy and         Prime Minister Craxi apparently was the least
 the Vatican       forthcoming of the West Europeans and did
 little more than listen politely.  According to
 US officials, Craxi and Foreign Minister
 Andreotti regarded the Canadian proposals as
 "unrealistic" but welcomed Trudeau's effort to
 reestablish dialogue between the superpowers.
 Pope John Paul II, on the other hand,
 wholeheartedly endorsed Trudeau's effort.

 West Germany     Chancellor Kohl reportedly showed considerable
 interest in Trudeau's ideas.  Canadian Defense
 Minister Blais recently told US officials that
 Trudeau was pleased by Kohl's receptiveness,
 and the New York Times reported that the
 Chancellor's security advisers are actively
 studying the plan.
 Great Britain Prime Minister Thatcher gave Trudeau's plan a
 lukewarm reception and told him the idea of a
 Five-Power Conference was premature.  Foreign
 and Commonwealth office officials apparently
 were more receptive and Mrs. Thatcher also
 seemed a bit more supportive of the Canadian
 initiative at the Commonwealth Conference.
 "Increased contact," Thatcher said regarding
 Trudeau's plan, "does not of itself guarantee
 results, much less quick results.   But it can
 ward off the worst dangers and for that reason
 alone is worth pursuing."
 Japan             Prime Minister Nakasone welcomed Trudeau's
 efforts and said that Japan would unequivocally
 support his ideas regarding the NPT.   Nakasone
 was non-committal on the other aspects of the
 Canadian plan.
 Commonwealth      The Conference's final communique gave
 Conference        general support to Trudeau's plan but refrained
 from endorsing the specifics.  Prime Minister
 Gandhi of India led those Commonwealth nations
 opposing Trudeau's plan to expand the number of
 NPT signatories.
 China             Trudeau received a polite reception in Beijing
 but little specific support from the top
 leaders.
 USSR              Trudeau's personal envoy received some limited
 encouragement from Gromyko, Korniyenko, and
 Arbatov.  He told the Soviets that Trudeau
 would discuss the plan only with Andropov, and
 Gromyko hinted that a.response regarding such a
 meeting might be forthcoming by 20 December.
 Subsequently, Izvestiya political commentator
 Aleksandr Bovin wrote in the Toronto Star that
 Moscow supports Trudeau's plan and is "ready
 for an exchange of opinion at the forum of the
 five."

 Canadian Domestic Reaction
 At home, Trudeau has received substantial approval for his
 initiative.   Some press articles have accused him of using the
 peace plan as a ploy to revive the Liberal Party's flagging
 political fortunes -- the Liberals trailed the Progressive
 Conservatives by 29 percentage points in a Gallup Poll in
 October.   On the whole, however, Trudeau's recent efforts have
 been applauded by the public, the media, and the leaders of both
 opposition parties.  According to US officials, Trudeau
 apparently has struck a responsive chord among Canadians by
 reminding them of the "golden age" of Canadian diplomacy, the
 period during the 1950s and 1960s when Canada, as a leading
 middle power, played the role of "helpful fixer" in such
 international disputes as the Suez Crisis.
 Trudeau's initiative apparently also reflects the concerns
 of a substantial portion of the Canadian electorate.  The
 Progressive Conservative Party's pollster, Allan Gregg,  said
 recent polls show that an unprecedented proportion of the
 Canadian population has put the status of international affairs
 at the top of their list of worries.   Gregg estimates that in his
 next poll 20 to 25 percent of Canadians will list international
 relations as their top concern;  the previous Canadian peak in
 this category was 11 percent in December 1980 after the invasion
 of Afghanistan.   In addition, the Toronto Globe and Mail has
 quoted polls showing that among citizens of all the Western
 countries Canadians are the most fearful about world peace and
 that their confidence in Washington's ability to deal with world
 affairs has declined in recent years.  Paradoxically, however, a
 recent poll conducted by the Canadian Institute of International
 Relations showed that while a majority of Canadians supported the
 current thrust of the Liberal government's external policy, they
 still intend to vote for the Progressive Conservatives in the
 next election.
 We believe that Trudeau's initiative is not primarily an
 attempt to find a way to remain party leader and prime
 minister.  Trudeau has been an outspoken advocate of disarmament
 for more than 20 years and, in our judgment, his present effort
 is inspired predominantly by intellectual commitment rather than
 political pragmatism.   Some slow, or even sporadic, progress
 toward the reopening of a positive US-USSR arms control dialogue
 may, however, encourage Trudeau to seek reelection in the general
 election now expected in the fall of 1984.   Trudeau pledged, in'
 1980, to retire before the next election.

 Next Steps in the Initiative
 In our opinion, Trudeau will in the near future seek to put
 increased public pressure on Washington and Moscow to renew and
 expand arms control negotiations.   Such pressure might include
 the following specific moves:
 Take an activist position within the NATO caucus at the
 CDE in Stockholm.  We believe that the Canadians will be
 very active within the NATO causus and most unwilling to
 back away from any of the confidence building measures
 it now plans to introduce. Both Trudeau and External
 Affairs Minister MacEachen have stressed the importance
 they attach to the CDE and we cannot rule out the
 possibility that the Canadians may urge the caucus to
 make additional substantive recommendations should the
 conference appear headed for a stalemate
 Seek to restart the MBFR talks.   We believe that Canada
 may suggest that a ministerial level meeting be held in
 Vienna as a means of getting MBFR talks started again.
 Trudeau believes that a high-level "political impulse"
 is needed to improve the prospects for an MBFR
 agreement; he has described those talks to date as "a
 silent exercise in which the technocrats were in
 control."
 "Fundamental debate" in the North Atlantic Council  (NAC)
 on NATO's dual track policy and force structure.   During
 his recent visit to Japan, Trudeau told Nakasone that,
 while Canada remained commited to NATO's dual track
 policy, INF "had failed" and that the alliance had
 "crossed a dangerous threshhold" with deployment.
 Trudeau also told the Dutch that he is skeptical, even
 cynical, about the ability of the other NATO allies to
 influence US policy and that he believes the deterrent
 side of the dual track policy now far overshadows the
 negotiating.  We believe he may seek common ground with
 the smaller NATO allies before urging debate in the NAC.
 Seek additional moral support for his initiative from
 Third World nations.  Trudeau has indicated that he may
 seek the support of the G-77 group of non-aligned
 nations in the United Nations to complement the general
 support he received at the Commonwealth Conference.  He
 also will continue to urge the-LDCs who have not signed
 the NPT to do so.

 Increased public emphasis on confidence building
 measures, especially a ban on ASAT.   In a speech in
 1978, Trudeau called for the "suffocation" of the
 nuclear arms race through the halting of "the
 technological momentum ... freezing at the initial,
 testing stage the development of any new weapons
 system."  We believe that Trudeau's call for a ban on
 high altitude anti-satellite systems,  for limits on ICF3M
 mobility, and for verifiable weapons systems fits within
 the framework of his "suffocation" plan and that he will
 push hard for their adoption.
