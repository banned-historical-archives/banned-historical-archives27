clerks, many of whom refrained from going home during the spring festival Vacation so that they 
could complete their investigations and bring charges against merchants, usually their employers. 
Merchants were warped repeatedly not to try to punish the clerks for these charges, and regulations 
Were promulgated forbidding merchants to fire or punish, reward or change the status of shop 
employees for the duration of the drive. Increasing resistance to the campaign was noted, with 
industrial and commercial circles pointed out as the chief antagonists. There also was noted a 
growing concentration on the "big corrupt elements," with a complaint that Most of the crimes 
confessed have been insignificant. Cadres were frequently blamed for laxity, but more often 
were warned to beware of dishonest businessmen who would seek to corrupt them. 
Economic weaknesses aSide from corruption in official and business circles were admitted, 
expecially in the old revolutionary bases, where a picture of bleak desolation was painted. 
Ideological adjustment received little attention because of the heavy concentration on the 
anticorruption drive, but continued steps to bring thought reform to teachers and students, 
especially in the higher institutions, were reported. At least one new move to destroy 
foreign influence in the Catholic Church was broadcast. Considerable attention was devoted 
to preferential treatment for families of Army men, with some -censure for lack of interest in 
the movement and Oonsiderable evidence that the burden is growing heavy. There was a 
noticeable drop in the time devoted to suppression of counterrevolutionaries, tp the new 
marriage law, and to the national minorities.

ANTI WASTE, ANT/CORRUPTION, ANTIBUREAUCRACY 
Development of Drive. The drive to eliminate waste, corruption and bureaucraty continued to 
monopolize Chinese Communist broadcasts to the Chinese people during the period Jan. 21-Feb .3, 
1952. So heavy was the concentration on this drive that some other subjects formerly 
considered important were almost entirely neglected. Rallies and meetings were reported 
4eily. Some of these were confession and accusation meetings called to arouse the 
enthusiasm of the people, while others were organizational meetings. 
Stages in the progress of the drive vere not similar throughout all China. Sian announced 
(Yeb. 1) that "Party cadres in Yenan, Shensi Province, had called a meeting Jan. 28 to 
ernmote the delve vhile in the Weiyang Special District, Kansu, the confession stage was 
Ilust being reacheci following a Party cadre meeting Jan. 29. Kunming reported (Jan. 21) 
that in Chiupei, (Ssutsung), Kuangnan, and Wenshan Hsien, Yunnan, Party cadres started

groups would get under way in February. Wuhsi announced (Jan. 31) that the South Kiangsu 
Celounist Party Committee had set up inspection teams to check on the progress of the drive. 
Meanwhile the effort to persuade the people to report all cases of graft and corruption anus 
.not relaxed. Antung announced (Jan. 22) that the local People's Supervisory Committee had 
set up an office for the convenience of informers, with the telephone number 2115. The same 
radio said (Jan. 28) that the Antung Bureau of Trade would promote the drive by offering 
rewards to informers. Chungking announced (Jan. 23) that the Yunnan People's Government 
? and the Kunming People's Govermient had set up informers' boxes on the main streets of 
Kunming, while the Yunnan People's Supervisory Committee and the Yunnan branch of the 
People's Bank, had prepared similar boxes, with 1,000 reports already received and 
committees to encourage informers organized on the hsien level. 
Bangchow announced (Jan. 26) that the local clerks' union had set up boxes for informers at 
the following places: Clerks Union premises; Garment Workers Ball, Sanchiang Chu; 17 East 
Taiping Alley, off Bofang Street, Shangcheng Chu; Jewelry Workers Ball and Trade gall,

langchas also announced (Jan. 23) that a special broadcast had been arranged for Jan. 25, with 
'on-the-spot confessions and accusations." Chungking reported (Jan. 26) that a rally of 65,000 
persons at Chungking was broadcast for the benefit of 30,000 more radio listeners, who heard 
reports of 3,298 cases of corruption and 9,500 investigations. Peking announced in numeral code 
(Jan. 29) that the Peking Film Producing Company had produced a newsreel on the anticorruption 
!rive, while Bangchow said. (Jan. 30) that in Chekiang Province art and culture circles were 
preparing propaganda materials in the form of articles, pictorials, and plays. Anshan. announced 
(Feb. 3) that the local Bureau of Propaganda had called a meeting of seven city departments to 
crianize an anti-corruption-drive publicity committee. Wuhsi reported (Feb. 3) that Wuhsien high 
school and college students held a rally Feb. 1 under the leadership of the Youth Corps to 
Nape out remnant capitalistic thought* by attacking corrupt elements, "including those in their 
ARM fannies." Kunming announced (Jan. 23) that the Chuching Special District, Yunnanlwas now 
making progress in the drive following the removal of several cadres for laxity. 
Ibinaphow (Jan. 30) reported successful efforts in the Hangchow Railroad Bureau, where concentra-
tion was nov centered on getting the "big corrupt elementr," a process known as "tiger hunting." 
AXWmagking said (Feb. 2) that the Southwest Military Control Commission had organized a "tiger 
hunt team" and designated February rs the month to hunt "big corrupt elements," several of 
whom already were awaiting trial. Wuhan announced (Feb. 3) that the Wuhan Joint Inspection 
Committee began work Feb. 1 by announcing a campaign against major corrupt elements under the 
leadership of Major Wu Te-feng, chairman of the committee of 22. Sian said (Feb. 3) that in the 
Northwest the major Government organs had reached the stage for a drive against major corrupt 
ale -nts, many 0 which still remained to be wiped out. None of these broadcasts mace clear 
whether the big corrupt elements against whom the drive is to be focused are in Government or 
builiness. 
Concentration on Merchants. There was noted a growing tendency to overlook or sidetrack 
corruption in Government offices and center attention on the evil acts of business and 
industrial circles, especially merchants. Even when bribery of Government etployees was involved, 
chief blame was placed on the businessmen, who were accused of corrupting Government officials. 
Shanghai clarified this tendency in a broadcast (Feb. 3) by announcing a new campaign--a 
"campaign against the practice of graft, tax evasion, pilferage of State property, cheating on 
labor and materials, and filching of information on the state of our national economy." The 
broadcast made clear that the new campaign is directed against private business concerns, and 
outlined regulations forbidding "managers, submanagers, and other responsible persons in private 
shops" from taking leave, closing shop, discharging employees, suspending payments, refusing to 
? provide food for employees, beating or cursing shop clerks, assigning workers to other positions 
or other cities, or hindering employees from attending meetings. Thus a drive which started out , 
to increase national production and prevent waste, first became a drive to eliminate vaste? 
corruption, and bureaucracy in all offices and establishments, and now has become a direct 
attack on corruption among private businessmen, especially merchants. 
Anshan announced (Feb. 3) that a rally was attended by youths, workers, and Government cadres to 
"discuss the drive against corrupt merchants who have refused to make a full confession." 
Tsinan reported (Feb. 3) that the city People's Consultative Council met to promote the drive 
"among the city's businessmen," who were called upon to "change their thinking and wipe out the 
last vestige of capitalism." The Tsinan Government has organized an inspection team of 1,000 
cadres to check the local shops for corruption, tax evasion, cheating, and so forth. Earlier 
Tsinan had reported (Jan. 21) that Youth Corps members in Chu.2? 3 and 4 had reported. 200 cases 
of corruption among local merchants. Liu Chi-shun of the Yung Using Tea Store, Chu 6, had 
talked the manager into confessing to tax evasion on 50 million yuan, and Liu Chang-shan of the 
Wanchuan Medicine Shop had persuaded his manager to denounce Wu Shou-chang, section chief in 
the city Bureau of Trade, for accepting a bag of flour and 100,000 yuan. Tsinan said (Jan. 24) 
that most of the corrupt elements in local government circles were leftovers from the former 
regime, or had "corrupted cadres and infected them with bourgeois thinking," and added:

In addition unscrupulous merchants have cempromised 
apTight Government officials and bribed them into 
engaging in corrupt dealings at the expense of the 
Government. Their tactics are not only shameless, but 
also Tel"- thorough. For example, a comrade in the Tax 
Bureau who was an honest and upright official became 
corrupted and accepted bribes amounting to more than 4 
million yuan by permitting the merchants to evade the 
payment of more than 20 millions in taxes. Although 
this comrade was forced into a compact of secrecy by 
? the merchants, yet he was brave enough to make a 
Confession and denounce the corrupt merchants. Other 
comrades followed him and exposed 17 other unscrupulous 
merchants. These unscrupulous merchants now are forced 
to make their own confessions. (Tsinan, Shantung Regional, 
Jan. 24) 
atukden announced (Jan. 22) that Party cadres were making an inspection of the city's mercantile 
establishments to find unreported cases of corruption.. Hofei said (Jan. 23) that in Pengpu 
Youth Corps cadres were organizing teams to check on local merchants. Taiyuan announced (Jan. 21) 
that the local People's Consultative Council had met and issued a call for the masses to make 
accusations against businessmen. The SHANSI PEOPLE'S DAILY carried an article on the corruption of 
Government officials by merchants, who had bribed 22 officials with 20 million yuan, causing a loss 
to the Government of 1.27 billions, and who had refused to confess "in the face of irrefutable 
evidence." 
Wuhan reported (Jan. 22) that merchants in the Huangkang Special District had defrauded the 
.lovernment of 350 million yuan. Another Wham broadcast (Jan. 25) reported 6,,000 cases of bribery, 
profiteering, tax evasion, and fraud among local commercial circles. Wuhan said (Feb. 2) that 
40,000 workers in 55 when factories had launched a drive by exposing 17 corrupt merchants who had 
Led factory cadres into corruption. Wang Kuo-chang? a factory manager with a brilliant 
revolutionary record, was "corrupted by bourgeois ways" and "fell for the blandishments of 
2apitalistic merchants," with the result that the Government lost 60 million yuan. Wuhan 
reported (Jan. 29) that in Canton the merchants held a rally Jan. 23-24, at which Deputy Mayor 
7phu Kuang pointed out 41 illegal trade practices, 39 methods of tax evasion, and other corrupt 
activities of the 998 merchants present. Canton announced (Feb. 2) that the local Bureau of 
:haror had exposed several clothing shops for cheating on labor and materials. Mayor Yeh 
:hien-ying spoke to businessmen at another meeting, urging them to confess their corrupt acts. 
Damning reported (Jan. 23) a local rally attended by 5,000 at which Wang Shih-ming, chairman of 
;he Kunming Retail Clerks Union, exposed businessman Liu I-chieh, "who utilized the charms of his 
Laughter to corrupt his employees." At the meeting 3,778 letters were received denouncing 9,500 
:orrupt elements. 
'eking announced in numeral cede (Jan.- 29) that in Chungking the "struggle against dishonest 
terchants has become a mass movement." Women's study groups among commercial and industrial 
irclea had increased from 200 to 800l and more than 10 cases of lawbreaking merchants reported 
y the people were described in the newspapers each day. The Chungking Economy Investigation 
ommittee had Sent out more than 20 teams to investigate, with threats and bribery gaining the 
4rchants nothing. On Jan. 231 44 merchants whose crimes were fairly serious and who "declined 
to confess" were arraigned by the People's Court. Chungking said (Jan. 25) that five Important 
arty officialshad issued a statement praising the local government for the arrest of the 44 
erchants and demanding severe punishment. Another broadcast (Jan. 26) said the local People's 
cinsultative Council had passed a resolution "supporting the arrest of the 44 corrupt merchants." 
Peking numeral code transmission (Jan. 30) accused managers of the State-controlled Dairen 
epartment Store nf "bureaucratic methods," but placed all the blame for actual corruption in the 
tore on local merchants. It was said that 92 percent of the store's business personnel had been 
Irectly or indirectly recommended through the plans of the dishonest merchants, and they included 
professional thieves, Kuomintang members who were put under control, prostitutes, vagrants, 
ad dishonest merchants."

Efforts of Shop Clerks. It is apparent that no Party or Government officials are in as good a 
position to know what goes on in a business house as are the employees of the individual 
merchant or businesaman. Therefore a widespread effort has been made to mobilize business 
employees, especially shop clerks, as the main weapon to be used in attacking private 
merchants. This not only is effective in exposing the illegal activities of the merchants, 
but also it promotes class strife, or "struggle." Also; it is quite probable that a large 
percentage of shop clerks are easily induced to turn against their employers, especially 
when promised rewards and protection.

Hankow said (Jan. 30) that in the No. 3 office of the No. 1 suboffice of the Tax Bureau, located 
in a cigarette factory area where merchants and officials gather to wine and dine together as 
a matter of course, a merchant tried to bribe tax official Chu Su-ping with 100 million yuan. 
When Chu refused the bribe he was told to keep the matter secret, but when he transferred to the 
central office he "felt it was his duty to report the case." Chungking reported (Jan. 22) that 
Tai Pu-chll owner of the Chunghua Auto Repair Shop on Hanchung Road, had been handed over to the 
People's Court for bribing Government officials to accept poor work and sell him Government

?Kunming announced (Jan. 21) that (Hsu Kuo-mi)? head of the material sales department of the 
Yunnan Finance Office, cost the Government 1,326,000,000 yuan through corruption. Kunming said 
(Jan. 25) that railway guards of the Kunming Railway Administration had held a meeting to indict 
/ao I-cheng, Peng Te-hual Liu Ming-i, King Te-seng, Chi Chung, and Tieh Ko-seng, all former 
Kuomintang reactionaries who had disgraced the guards by their corrupt practices. King was a 
former gangster who solicited bribes from merchants. Kunming reported (Jan. 26) that in Pinning 
? two Government employees stole Government property and mnney. 
Tax Evasion. While not numerous, some of the tax evasions reported in radio broadcasts involved 
large sums of money and reflected considerable resistance to Government levies. Chungking 
announced (Feb. I) that in Kunming tax evasions over the past 2 years would total 300 billion 
yuan, with 95 percent of the businessmen guilty of evasions. Taiyuan said (Jan. 21) that the 
International Pharmacy in that city had dodged taxes to the amount of 70 million yuan. Shanghai 
reported (Jan. 23) that Chao Chang-chi, Shanghai merchant, had been remanded to the People's 
Court for tax evasions of a million yuan in 1951. 
Wuhan announced (Jan. 30) that in Nanchang one tax evasion amounted to 500 million yuan, while 
20 others reached 100 million yuan earth. Wuhan said (Feb. 1) that a local clerk reported his 
store manager, (Kuo Peng-chen), who evaded taxes totaling 5 million yuan by bribes of watches, 
fountain pens, medicine, and so forth. In Changsha 8,600 tax evasions for 1951 had been 
discovered, along with an additional 1,026 for January 1952. Wuhan also announced (Jan. 23) that

evasions will not have to repay those taxes, "while those who refuse to confess will be fined 
when they are denounced." 
Hangchow announced (Jan. 24), quoting the municipal Tax Bureau, that in 1951 tax evasions by 
local merchants totaled 14,300, involving 7,439,000,000 yuan. Hangchow said (Jan. 29) that in a 
meeting of 65 cashiers of Hsiacheng Chu, many reported that they had talked their employers into 
confessing to tax evasions. Hangchow reported (Feb. 1) that one branch of the Hangchow Tax 
Bureau uncovered tax evasions of 44.3 million yuan among the paper and stationery trades. Another 
Hangchow broadcast (Feb. 2) reported that the Shanghang suboffice of the Hangchow Tex Bureau had 
estimates indicating that 11 paper merchants in the district had evaded 14.3 million yuan in 
business iicenses; 65.6 millions in fees; and 9 millions in stamp taxes. The Hangchow branch of a 
Shanghai paper firm reported its business at 321 million yuan, when in reality it amounted to 
4,861,000,000 yuan. 
Laxity, Waste and Extravagance. Reports of laxity on the part of leading cadres still were 
frequent, coupled with the regular explanation that the entire problem was solved through a short 
indoctrination program. Reports of waste and extravagance were less common, perhaps because of 
the concentration on actual corruption. 
Dairen reported (Jan. 22) that in the Dairen Oil and Fat Company many cadres among the workers

were lax, bureaucratic, undemocratic, and "fearful of the workers." Dairen said (Jan. 23) that th 
Dairen-Port Arthur Party Committee called a meeting of cadres Jan. 19 in an attempt to build up 
their enthusiasm. Another Dairen. broadcast (Jan. 31) told of a meeting of police cadres: who were 
told by Deputy Director Chen Chung-hsing of the Public Safety Bureau that many of them were lax in 
leadership and "vague as to the objectives of the drive." Dairen said (Feb. 3) that the Party 
Committee in the Dairen Railway Workers Union had started a campaign among the cadres, %s many 
of the workers kept aloof from confessions and accusations and thought some waste was necessarily 
apart of railway operation." Antung reported .(Jan. 24) that at a Party 'meting cadres had been 
charged with laxity. Another broadcast (Jan. 29) said that cadres in the Liaotung Department of 
Trade were lax, with the result that "corrupt elements have avoided confession, or have made 
unsatisfactory confessions." Director Liang of the Liaotung Cooperative Bureau also attacked the 
"hypocritical attitude" of some cadres, who considered themselves free from corruption, and thus 
"paid no attention to the drive." 
Tainan Announced (Jan. 23) that there had been no progress in the drive in the Shantung Health 
Department because of the lassitude of leading cadres. Kaifeng reported (Jan. 23) that 
Commissioner Tao of the Huaiyang Administrative District pointed out existing laxity at a meeting 
Jan. 17, and declared that all cadres who think that no corruption exists among them because 
they are honest "should reexamine their thinking." Wuhan reported (Jan. 22) that in the China Food 
Company Party and Youth Corps cadres have taken over direction of the drive because the managers 
were lax in slating confession and accusation meetings, and instead of accusing employees of 
corruption, "stressed only the evils of their riotous living." Sian said (Jan. 22) that several 
offices still were lax in supporting the drive because they thought they were free of corruption. 
Kunming reported (Feb. 3) that the Light Industry Workers Union held a rally at which cadres were 
charged with laxity and with permitting the drive to end after desultory confessions and accusa-
tions. The Knrming mayor warned of the "dangers of the capitalistic attack," and urged greater 
efforts. The unsatisfactory progress of the drive in Chaotung Hsien, Yunnan, was demonstrated 
by the laxity of Public Safety Department cadres, who allowed one person to spend 5 hours 
confessing "without telling anything concrete." In the Grain Bureau confessions were dispensed 
with entirely. 
Peking reported in numeral code (Jan. 22) that in Tientsin 700 billion yuan had been wasted through 
the tying up of capital and through the manufacture of inferior goods. Dairen announced (Feb. 1) 
that Dairen-Port Arthur Communications Company workers agreed at a meeting Jan. 31 that waste in 
the organization had reached 1.2 billion yuan, and corruption had cost 9.5 billions. Wham 
reported (Jan. 22) that at a Hainan rally it was disclosed that the Hainan Miscellaneous Goods 
:!ompany wasted 100 million yuan because of poor management, while waste in all financial and 
sconomic units of the Hainan Administrative Office amounted to 630 millions. Hangchaw said 
:Jan. 31) that in the Hangchaw railroad station of the Shanghai Railway Control Bureau the loading 
potas had been filled 53 days ahead of time. "However, as a result of their unrationed work they 
..oaded only two or three tons to the standard 30-ton baggage car," causing a waste of 2,628 
-aggage cars-8,958,000,000 yuan. 
:ekden announced (Jan. 22) that local trade unions had called a meeting of workers' families to urg< 
.at they refrain from extravagant spending during the spring festival. Wuhan announced (Jan. 30) 
hat Mayor Li KUo-ming of Kongmoon, KWangtung, had been removed from office because "he did not see 
he error of his ways." He had proposed to the Government that 10 percent of the taxes be retained 
Cor his grandiose capitalistic construction projects." When his request was rejected he "openly 
apressed dissatisfaction with the Government," aad started his scheme anyway. In 1951 he illegally 
ellected 1.8 billion yuan from merchants to build a hall of culture, after already having spent 
D millions on a model. He angered the local populace with his luxurious construction projects 
; the expense of mass education projects. "Hisagarage is more elaborate than most houses, and his 
lime is fitted with dancing floors and swimming pools." 
.nchang reported (Jan. 21) that in Ihuang Hsien, Kiangsi, cadres thought the drive did not concern 
-mu: as they considered themselvea honest and the countryside too poor to corrupt them. However, 
was found that the Youth Corps cOmmittee was living extravagantly: so now all cadres are regaire4

Committee has looked into the matter and ordered that such extravagance be stopped. 
Resistance to Drive. Whether or not resistance to the antiwaste? anticorruption, antibureaucracy 
drive is growing, broadcast reports of outright opposition have increased. Most of these broad-
'casts are from the Northeast and Southwest, while none are fram the Central and South China area. 
Peking reported in numeral code (Jan. 27) that in kden 17,225 illegal acts of business concerns, 
such as graft, tax evasion, and stealing of Government property, had been exposed, with an 
.estimated loss to the Government of 200 billion plan. Yet only a little more than 2,000 
confessions had been made, most of them "elusive in substantial facts, touching upon only the 
past, and leaving present implications unmentioned." Many merchants had sought to threaten or 
discharge employees, close shop, close accounts ahead of time, prolong the spring festival 
vacation, or pay off workers, in order to hide their evil practices. As a result new regulations 
were to be enforced forbidding merchants from exercising undue influence on employees, signing 
mutual alliance pacts, or keeping their shops closed for the spring festival any later than Feb. 1. 
Anshan announced (Feb. 2) that on the evening of Jan. 27 Manager Fang Yu-ming of the Chienkuo 
Metal Factory, Nhnager Yuan Hao liang of the Anshan Vacuum Bottle Works, and Manager Cheng 
Kuo-ching of the Wuchia Hardware Company, opposed the anticorruption drive by refusing to permit 
examination of their books. All of these companies had profited at Government expense. The 
Chienkuo Metal Factory used 26 million yuan for speculation, causing the Government huge losses, 
and increased its capital from 300 millions in 1949 to 3 billions at present, and its workers from 
8 in 1949 to 156 at present. The Wuchia Hardware Company grew from an 80-million to a 300-million-
yuan concern. Though confessions by merchants in Anshan had reached 966, many of the "big 
merchants" still were trying to obstruct the drive. Mayor Fang threatened them with dire punishmad 
gave them until Feb. 7 to make confessions, and declared he would not extend this deadline. Anshan 
said (Feb. 3) that three leading cadres in the Anshan Trust Company, the manager and two deputy 
managers, had hindered the drive through their "self-conceited attitude," and had aroused 
dissatisfaction among the masses of the company. 
Dairen announced (Jan. 21) that 440 local merchants had made confessions, "but a majority still 
have not done so." Wang Chi-shan, manager of the Kungyi Electrical Supply Shop, made a public 
confession, but did not report all his corrupt acts in the hope that they would not be discovered. 
Others have made charges against him. "so his confession obviously was incomplete." Ho Te-chien 
stfused to confess orally but promised to write a letter, which he did not do. A meeting of the 
businessmen was called for Jan. 22 so they "can be told their responsibilities." The same radio 
said (Jan. 23) that Deputy Chairman Yeh of the trade groups declared at a meeting of businessmen 
that commercial circles actually had supported the drive, but 'm'y still retain feudalfstic and 
capitalistic thought." Dairen reported (Jan. 25) that students, youths, workers, and clerks had 
talked to Dairen authorities, denouncing "many recalcitrant merchants who have refUsed to confess." 
he WORKERS DAILY attacked the leading cadres in the North Sea Marine Transport Bureau, declaring 
the drive was "'making no headway in that organization." 
Dairen said in a later broadcast that to admit minor charges and avoid the serious ones had 
Decome the common practice. Commercial circles were denounced as follows: 
The movement against bribery, tax evasion, profiteering, 
and theft among industrial and commercial circles of this 
city has made no progress at all. Up to Jan. 24 incomplete 
statistics show that cases of confession and accusation on 
hand totaled 493, most of them trifles. What we cannot 
tolerate is that the guilty will not confess and admit their 
guilt, but stall and remain stubborn. Most of the houses handed.'

obliged to comply." Broker Chang Yu7chuan wrote at length,

done with persons receiving bribes, attempting to shun 
respOnsibility. Proprietor Shang I-ye of the Chieh-ho 
Colliery used the mean trick of saying that the Govern-
ment should maintain secrecy in order to get his con-
fession, thus threatening the Government. Hou Cheng-chu, 
chairman of the Fur and Hide Trade Union, who had cried 
about turning over a new leaf almost every day, led other 
members to play poker in the study meeting. The proprietor 
of the Whim Photograph Shop openly revolted in the meeting. 
(Dairen, Dairen-Port Arthur Regional Service, Jan. 26) 
Dairen reported (Feb. 3) that the chief of the production department in the No. 18 Machine Works 
knew of waste in the mill, but refused to expose it through fear of losing his job. The head of 
the transport section was quoted as saying that "if there were no corruption there would be no use 
working in the transport section," and that he certainly would not advise his son to take up the 
work. The foreman of the shop was voted as saying that the drive was causing him too many 
headaches; if it continued he would quit. Even the cadres were said to be advising workers "not 
to be too energetic in stirring up trouble." 
Tsinan reported (Jan. 23) that the local Austerity Committee had accused businessmen of obstructing 
the drive by threatening workers. The Tsinan businessman called an emergency meeting, at which an 
effort was made to shift the blame onto the cadres who accepted bribes. Some merchants said that 
"since they paid out the money, why should they suffer?" Tsinan said (Feb. 3) that the drive had 
made little progress in the Shantung Construction Company because the cadres had "refused to take 
the lead" in making confessions and accusations. One cadre even was quoted as saying that "he was 
not corrupt under the Kuomintang regime; he learned it after he started to work for the Shantung 
Construction Company." Shanghai reported (Jan. 22) that at a rally of the Shanghai Railway 
Administration those who were in the process of making confessions were "warned not to leave town." 
-Director Yu Hsi-chang expressed dissatisfaction with the drive because the "major corrupt elements" 
:remained free. He urged that the broad masses go after big game, and warned that it takes brains, 
:patience and determination to catch big game. At Nanking a special meeting was called to urge lax 
cadres to work harder, and they were warned especially against corrupt merchants who offer bribes. 
Hangchow declared (Jan. 21) that in the Chekiang Grain Bureau confessions were obstructed by the 
bureaucratic attitude of department heads, who suppress accusations because they want to avoid 
aonfessions. Great emphasis must be placed upon the assault by capitalistic forces upon the 
people's movement. For example, merchant Chang Yung-fa sent his wife to live with Government 
pfficials Chang Knng-yuen and Chen Shou-shen in order to connive with them to steal Government 
property. Hangchana reported (Jan. 30) that in Wenchow Trade Association leader Ling Yu-chi was 
arrested for "bringing pressure" on the wife of Wang Su-te, who had reported him for corruption. 
Iangchow said (Jan. 31) that the Chekiang Party cadres had attacked the bureaucratic attitude 
:till existing among Government officials, and the "fear of the people in exposing powerful corrupt 
lelnents." Deputy Party Secretary Tan Su-lung pointed .out that "capitalistic forces have been able 
o establish a foothold in the bastions of Communism," and warned cadres not to become "too 
Hangchow announced (Feb. 1) that in the Chinhua Special District, Chekiang,

aiyuan (Jan. 31) quoted from the SHANSI JIH PAO in "attacking the obstructionist attitude of 
archants and warning them to change their thinking or suffer the circumstances." Taiyuan

corrUpt elements, or "they would be subject to punishment." Sian announced (Jan. 25) that a 
meeting of city shop clerks had been told that many merchants were obstructing the anticorruption 
drive. Sian said (Jan. 30) that in Tihua a number of confessions had been made, but "still the 
merchants have proved evasive and stubborn." Mayor Yao addressed a meeting of merchants in 
Tihua Jan. 15, telling them they would support the drive with confessions and accusations "if 
they were patriotic." 
Chungking reported (Jan. 29) that in Chengtu some merchants maintained an "obdurate attitude" 
and used underhanded methods to undermine the drive against corruption. During a confession 
rally of the piece goods trade a number of petty merchants wanted to accuse other merchants, 
but the presidium of the rally denied them the floor on the pretext they would disturb the 
rally. Members of some trades objected to Government cadres participating in the rallies "on 
the pretext the matter was one of internal relations." At some confession rallies the subject 
under discussion was deliberately shifted to "investigation of unrecorded property." The 
proprietor of the Liutseming Automotive Parts Company tried to evade confession by increasing 
his employees' salaries and. offering them free movie and bath tickets. 
Kunming announced (Jan. 23) that Sze Te-lih, chief of the material section of the Yunnan Departmen 
of Finance, had organized corrupt elements in his office to obstruct the work of the inspection 
committee. The same radio said (Jan. 25) that 1,500 shop clerks heard Party Secretary Ma Su-cheng 
warn them of attempts of the bourgeois to corrupt them with bribes and threats, and called 
especially on shop accountants and cashiers to resist. Kunming reported (Jan. 26) that the city 
government had issued a statement to industrial and commercial circles which declared that lawless 
elements still existed among the merchants, and laid down rules to prevent sabotage of the 
anticorruption drive. The drive was said to be progressing in the Yunnan Trading Company, with 
"confessions forced from its corrupt elements." KunnIng explained (Feb. 1) that the drive had 
been delayed in the city because of the laxity of the chairman and vice chairman of the Austerity 
Committee; suppression of democracy by cadres in the Public Safety Bureau; and refusal of the 
merchants to assume leadership. Chungking said (Feb. 1) that in Kunming commercial houses 
increased from 7,549 in 1950 to 12,500 in 1951. Profits for industrial concerns had been 20 
to 30 percent, and for commercial firms 40 to 50, and even 70 percent. Yet merchants had 
continued to use rebates, gifts, and entertainment to corrupt Government officials into 
permitting tax evasions, smuggling, and speculation. Large trading firms had spent tens of 
millions to bribe officials; smuggling of gold bars was estimated at 50,000 ounces; and illegal 
native banks numbered more than 30, with a capital of 10 billion yuan. 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
Weaknesses And Failures. Because of the heavy concentration of the Communist Chinese radio on. 
the drive against corruption among businessmen and Government officials, little was said about 
the efforts to increase production and to solve China's economic ills. However, a few weaknesses 
were uncovered. 
Peking reported in numeral code (Jan. 21) that the Northeast Industry Department had passed an 
ordinance aimed at promoting economy in the use of cement. The plans are to cut down the use of 
cement in basic construction by 30 percent in 1952. No cement is to be used on the roofs of one, 
story or two-story buildings, but limestone, sand, and clay are to be used instead; lime and sand 
are to be used. in finishing walls; and roads and pathisin factory areas are to be built of 
crushed stone, cinders, or pebbles. No cement is to be stored for more than 3 months. Peking 
said in numeral code (Fells 2) that at a meeting of the Northwest Transportation Company the 
attitude of cadres was attacked who want to lower gasoline and mileage standards because "road 
surfaces of highways in the Northwest are bad, and raw materials as well as parts are not up to 
standard," A Peking comment on the old revolutionary bases offers some interesting information. 
Some quotes from the article follow: 
A part of these bases have recovered in production, 
.even exceeding the prewar level in certain localities, 
but production in a large part of the old bases is too 
difficult to be restored.... A number of localities 
which also were attacked by flood and drought, old bases

in the South in particular, which were liberated 
somewhat later, still show principally desolation, 
and the livelihood of the people in these localities 
is exceedintly hard.... In Ningtu Helen, Kiangsu, 
8,334 families were exterminated. In Pingchiang Helen, 
Hunan, 14,000 cadres were killed, together wiuh 120,000 
people.... Many districts have become no man's lands.... 
Losses of draft cattle and farm tools, as well as people, 
have not been replaced. Some districts have become 
deserted land, infested with wild animals (Peking, 
Numeral Code, Feb. 1) 
Antung announced (Jan. 23) that outbreaks of cattle disease had become serious late in December 
in the Hsifeng and Tunghua areas, where cadres had been instructed to set up quarantine stations. 
Mukden said (Jan. 24) that the hoof and mouth disease had broken out in Harbin, the Fourth 
District of Shuangcheng, the Second District of Lalin, and several other places in Sunekiang 
Province, and was spreading. Prevention committees had been set up, restrictions on entry and 
exit of cattle and sheep had been carried out, and teams had been organized to go deep into rural 
areas to study prevention and cure. 
Mukden announced (Jan. 24) that the labor section of the Northeast Planning Committee had made 
public a daily wage index in various cities. The rate announced was 1,950 jen min piao in 
Mukden, 1,800 in Harbin, and ranged from a low of 1,770 in Kiamusze to a high of 1,950 in 
Shanghaikuan. Presumably these are weekly rates, and should be equivalent to about 2 to 2.50 
dollars in American money. Mukden said (Jan. 31) that the Northeast Government had issued a 
direr.tive increasing wages for workers in "unhealthy occupations" from 30 to 6o units, effective 
Feb. 1. 
? 
Wuhan reported (Jan. 31) that inventory checks showed the Chengchow Railway Control Bureau 
holding circulating capital for 11 different control bureaus. They also showed that the Kiangsi 
Nonferrous Metal Bureau had stored materials, including much that is rarely used, valued at 6 
billion yuan. Chungking said (Feb, 1) that tab little attention had been given to the protection 
and management of public granaries, with the result that losses in granaries of Wan:luau, Kiangtsin, 
and Tachu Haien, Szechwan, had been heavy from rats, fire, and fermentation. Kunming complained 
(Jan. 30) that 4 cadre meeting Jan. 21 to 24 revealed that 140,000 transport and construction 
trade workers "still operate under the feudalistic boss system." Kunming reported (Feb. 2) that 
in the Yunnan Textile Mills the dyeing vats had to be torn out and rebuilt twice before they 
could be used, and more than 20 million yuan was spent remodeling the plant before it could be 
used. 
Claims of Success. Nanchang claimed (Feb. 1) that in one village of Kiangsi the peasants saved 
a large sum of money during the spring festival by refusing to buy, superstitious articles or 
burn incense. Shanghai announced (Jan. 22) the spring festival austerity plan among farmers: 
Not to gamble, not to waste food?tobuy more work tools and cattle. Mukden reported (Jan. 21) 
that the Northeast Department of Industry was cutting down on documentary red tape, changing 
the bureaucratic attitude of officials, and was thus reducing office expenditures 62 percent. 
Hangchow said (Jan. 21) that the Shao-yao Engineering section of the Hangchow Railway 
subbureau had launched a drive to make sure that each locomotive runs at least 500 kilometers a 
day, in this way increasing freight transportation and shortening the rate of turnover of 
locomotives. 
Wuhsi announced (Jan. 22) that the Shop Clerks Union of Changchow had negotiated a working 
contract with shop owners to limit the working day to 10 hours in January, February and March; 
11 hours in April, May, October, November, and December; and to 12 hours in June, July, August 
and September. The number of work days in a week was not mentioned. Chungking announced 
(Jan. 23) that in the Changtu factories the struggle against reactionary forces had advanced 
from the democratic struggle stage to the democratic unity stage with outstanding achievements 
In increased production reported by the Tunghsing Textile Mills and Qhengtu Rubber Factory.

However, "factory cadres still are lax in supporting the democratic struggle, and in fact several 
factories have not even begun the democratic struggle." Sian reported (Jan. 22) that in Sinkiang 
the People's Liberation Army last year created wealth amounting to one trillion yuan. They 
cultivated 960,000 mou of farmland, producing 108 million catties of food, raised hoo,000 head 
of livestock, planted 1.9 million trees, completed five big irrigation projects and Ito all  
ones benefiting 540l000 Mou of farm land. All economic gains in Sinkiang Province seem to be 
Credited to the work of the People's Liberation Army, indicating that a large force is kept 
in that region. 
IDEOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT 
Schools and Teachers. Thought reform, like most other subjects usually considered important by 
the Communists, received little attention during the period under study. Many regional stations 
scarcely mentioned the question. Hangchow reported (Feb. 2) that 1,500 representatives of school 
administrators, teachers and students were meeting in Hangchow to promote thought reform. 
Wuhsi announced (Jan. 25) that the Wuhsien Normal School, the Chien Hsing High School, and other 
Klangsu high schools, had organized thought reform study groups. Wuhsi reported (Jan. 30) that 
17 delegates were attending a meeting of technical school administrators to discuss expansion of 
the technical training program to meet the growing needs of China. Sian reported (Jan.31) that 
2,000 representatives of higher educational institutions in the Northwest met Jan. 22 to discuss 
thought reform. Shanghai announced (Jan. 30) that the-Fifth Session of the Students Federation 
of Shanghai had ended at Chiaotung University with 737 regular delegates and 891 present by 
invitation, presumably Government and Party leaders in the main. The role of the students in 
the first half of 1952 is support of the economic and defense program, and the theme of the 
conference was thought reform. Shanghai said (Feb. 1) that 200 East China professors met in 
Shanghai Feb. 1 to plan for carrying out the thought reform movement. Aside from these 
scattered reports of meetings the regional broadcasting stations said little about bringing the 
school into line ideologically. 
Peking in numeral code (Jan. 22) reported an effort to convince college professors of the 
righteousness and accuracy of Soviet policies, and admitted some resistance to these efforts. 
The professors of the Physics Department of Chinghua University were said to have "greatly 
improved their understanding of the Soviet Union in their thought reform movement." Before 
studying, "because of insufficient understanding of the nature of the Soviet Socialist State, 
many of them were doubtful of the USSR." However, they had learned that past study methods 
would not solve the basic problems, so they -made an intense study of such documents as 3talin's 
"The International Nature of the October Revolution," and Liu Shao-chi's "Internationalism and 
Nationalism." Then they realized that the "past patriotic thoughts in doubting the Soviet Union 
were actually the narrow-minded thoughts of nationalism and of the bourgeois class, and that the 
past thoughts of purely relying on the Soviet Union were reflections of the national inferiority 
sentiment." After study they "realized that the Soviet Union would not invade us, but would 
always help us." 
Religious Countermeasures. Only one report was monitored showing the continued Communist drive 
to rid China of foreign influence through religious organizations. Peking reported in numeral 
code (Jan. 28) that in Kweisui, Sahsien: and Shanpa, Suiyuan Province, the Provincial Government 
seized principals in the Legion of Mary. Among those arrested were the Belgian director of 
Kweisui 2arish, Tai Mai-te; the Dutch director of Shanpa Parish, Te Lung-chiao; Belgian director 
of the church in Hsincheng, Weisui Parish, Ko Wei-te and Ko Shao-po; and KO Tien-min, director of 
the 0-erh-ko-hsun. These Catholics were responsible for setting up the Legion of Nary, which 
absorbed refugee landlords, special agents, and ruffians, spread rumors and influenced youth. When 
the reformation campaign started, they stepped up their sabotage activities, associated with 
bandits and special agents, and spread propaganda literature. They delivered intelligence reports 
to bandit Cheng Tien-ching, special representative of the Shansi-Chahar-Siuyuan-Shensi border of 
bandit Chiang's anti-Communist, self-defense, and National Salvation Army. More than 30 representa-
tives of the 130,000 Catholics in Suiyuan and of the Protestant churches, held a symposium Dec. 30 
to pledge their support of the Government, and fellow Catholics wno joined the Legion of Mary 
have registered to give up their membership.

Special Programs. Wuhsi announced (Jan. 23) that teachers in the winter schools of Kiangsu were 
organizing 337 newspaper reading classes in Changchow to study issues of the MEAN JIH PAO. 
Wuhan reported (Jan. 24) that 150,000 civil workers on the Paisha Reservoir, upper Thai River, 
had organized a political and cultural study program to be carried out immediately after lunch 
each day. Antung said (Jan. 24) that the Tunghua People's Government Labor Department began 
basic classes for construction workers in December. The classes, which are attended by 80 
workers, meet 3 hours each night, will last 3 months, and "will help the workers to understand 
their patriotic duty." Hangchaw announced (Jan. 29) that the Chekiang Government was organizing 
thought reform committees to work with worker and educator groups. 
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT 
Spring Festival. The program of preferential treatment for families of servicemen was 
practically the only subject not slighted because of the anti-corruption drive. This might 
be an indication of the urgent need for this program in the various localities. Virtually all 
broadcasting stations gave considerable attention to the preferential treatment program for the 
spring festival, or Chinese New Year, which started Jan. 26. The broadcasts followed pretty 
much the same pattern: Before the festival school children, Youth Corps members, women's 
groups, and some other smaller units were organized to visit families of servicemen during the 
festival. During the festival these groups called on dependents, left gifts, including food 
and money, wrote letters, and helped with farm and house work. Some radios prepared special 
broadcast programs. After the festival the success of the program was reported, including a 
number of letters of thanks written by dependents to Mao Tse-tung. Numerous broadcasts also told 
of visits by officials to wounded service men in hospitals. Most radios reported that inspection 
teams had been organized to check on the success of preferential treatment during the spring 
festival. 
A few novel features were reported. Canton announced (Jan. 24) that food kitchens would be set up 
in various parts of the city to aid unemployed dependents. The Canton branch, China Moving 
Picture Company, announced free shows for servicemen and dependents during the festival. Free 
tickets to the South China Native Products exhibition were offered. Wuhan reported (Jan. 27) 
that the local Civil Administration Bureau had distributed 48,200 catties of grain to 3,100 
families at the rate of four catties per family for martyrs' families and two catties to families 
of Korean war veterans. Wuhan announced (Jan. 21) that the Honan Government had issued specW, 
instructions for the organization of inspection committees, meetings of veterans and dependewls 
and selection of model dependents and model preferential treatment workers. Shanghai reported 
(Jan. 31) that in 1951 East China contributed 137.76 million catties of grain and 12,665,0000u00 
yuan to dependents, whose "political consciousness, living conditions, and social status" had been 
raised. In Shanghai jobs were found for 8,287 dependents, but it was admitted that this 
? represented only 60 percent of those applying for jobs. Shanghai announced (Jan. 25) that? a 
special program for soldiers and dependents would be broadcast Jan. 31. All Resist-America, 
Aid-Korea committees were required to organize listening groups for this broadcast, and report the 
results to the Shanghai Broadcasting Station) No. 2 Peking Road East. Sian announced (Feb. 3) 
that in Sining minority groups carried out the preferential treatment program. 
General Program, Further evidence that care for dependents of war victims is becoming a serious 
problem is found in a number of transmissions from the Central Broadcasting Station at Peking. 
A numeral code transmission (Jan. 23) said that street unions and suburban areas in Shanghai last 
year gave jobs to representatives of 100,000 members of service men's families, "five times as 
many as in 1950." Ten sewing, box making and handicraft factories were started with public funds 
to create jobs, while three blanket factories, laundries and rabbitries gave employment to 860 
and part-time employment to 1,000. Another numeral code broadcast the same day said that in 
Changsha a preferential treatment program had been implemented with a policy of "organizing the 
dependents of. martyrs and military personnel in production and using material relief only as a 
supplement, thereby basically solving the livelihood of 2,000 families." Since the material 
relief program came first) some cadres thought that preferential treatment consisted only of 
handing out relief during holidays, while some dependents had developed the "wrong attitude of 
relying solely on the Government and sitting and waiting for preferential treatment grain." In 
5 months in Changsha the program "solved the livelihood of 970 dependents of martyrs and 
soldiers and found jobs for 489 others."

Peking reported in numeral code (Jan. 30) that in the Jo-oda League, Jehol, Inner Mongolian 
Autonomous Region, living conditions had been improved in 10,000 homes of dependents. The tendency 
toward "unplanned labor coordination and decentralized farming services was corrected, and a system 
of vide-range collective farming was implemented." The program consisted of collective farming in 
the spring, collective harvesting and assessment of production in the autumn, specified 
responsibility and the signing of contracts. Preferential grazings were set up for the cattle of 
dependents, averaging 300 to 600 cattle each. At the League's First People's Conference of All 
Circles, 11 percent of those attending were dependents of servicemen. Thus the problem of 
providing for dependents, and the launching of a collective farm enterprise) seem to have been 
solved simultaneously. Peking said in numeral code (Feb. 1) that concerning the old revolutionary 
bases, "In the past some of these localities have done quite poorly" in preferential treatment. 
MUkden reported (Jan. 28) that in the Northeast dependents' harvests showed a general increase 
following preferential treatment aid in tilling. Dependents and disabled veterans in the towns 
and cities were given employment in the handicraft industries, "thus lessening the burden of the 
Government and the masses in solving their problem of living." Of the able-bodied males among 
the dependents, 70 to 80 percent have received jobs. Living standards have been raised to the 
extent that "in many places" they are buying carriages, horses, new clothes and houses, while 80 
percent of the children are able to attend school. "The social status and political consciousness 
of Army dependents have been greatly elevated." Tainan said (Jan. 22) that during 1951 jobs had 
been given to 700 dependents, with 3,700 engaged in handicrafts. Relief grain of 222,700 catties 
had been distributed, 1,000 women were given family grants, and 68o farms had received free labor. 
Kunming reported that in Menghua Hsien, Yunnan, dependents were so well pleased with preferential 
treatment that one woman promised to write her son in Korea to "kill a few more American devils." 
Sian announced (Jan. 24) that the Kansu Government had designated February as preferential treatment 
month and called upon all groups to implement the program. Chungking said (Jan. 25) that in 
Mingshan Hsien, Szechwan, 520 servicemen's families had been given assistance, but the caares were 
so lax that "assistance was given to landlords before it was given to dependents." In Wan Hsien 
89,000 catties of relief grain was distributed and 8,102 days of labor contributed to plow 
921787 MOU of land. Hangchow announced (Feb. 2) that the Hangchow medical group which left for 
Korea in June "has asked to be permitted to remain at the front," indicating that there may be a 
shortage of such gioups. 
RURAL REFORMS 
New Marriage Law. Radio stress on the new marriage law has continued to decline. During the 
period Jan. 21 - Feb. 3 only six brief items concerning the subject were monitored. Tsinan 
announced (Jan. 22) that in Wedshan Hsien, Shantung, 189,460 of the 333,823 population had 
"learned about the law." In the last half of December the hsien reported 100 marriages, 35 
engagements, and 26 divorces under the law. This high ratio of divorces to marriages, in a 
country where divorces have been practically unknown, might be significant. Dairen reported 
(Jan. 31) that 13,000 saw the exhibition "clearly demonstrating the advantages" of the new 
marriage system, and rural cadres had requested that it be shown in their areas. Wuhsi reported 
(Jan. 30) that 36 cotiples had registered with the marriage bureau for mass weddings. They were 
happy, because they could pick their own spouses and at the same time "save money on dowries and 
weddings." Hangchow announced (Feb. 1) that Fan Liu-chun was held for trial on a charge of 
knifing his wife, who had divorced him under the new law to marry another man, since She had 
been married to Fan at 17 through an arranged marriage. Nanchang said (Jan. 21) that in a 
discussion of the marriage law by a women's group in Tanyi Hsiang, Shangyao Hsien, Kiangsi, 
many "spoke of their happiness in securing divorces under the new law." Chungking announced 
(Jan. 24) that a check on marriage law observance showed good results in Santai, Wusheng, 
Nanpu, Nanchung, Kuhn, and Chienyang Haien, all in Szechwan. 
Land Reform. Considerably more broadcast time was given to land reform than to the new marriage 
law, with an apparent deemphasis on the crimes of landlords, and more stress on cadre failures and 
on the reinvestigation program. Kunming announced (Jan. 25) that in Chiangchuan Hsien, Yunnan, 
the landlords had been given a "death blow." All the goods they had stored away had been reported, 
and farmers associations had been organized. Chungking said (Jan. 24) that in Yuchi, Chinning,

and Chengchiang Hsien, Yunnan,land reform was progressing gradually, and that by "inflicting blows 
on the landlords the farmers line-up had been strengthened." Chungking reported (Jan. 30) that i 
Chaochin, Chintaag Hsien, Szechwan, 624 families harvested 64,800 catties of grain from newly 
allocated land; 17 landlords had been liqaidated; 2,000 farm laborers had gained higher living 
standards; and trade had increased from 2.5 billion yuan to 8 billions, with 12.5 billions in 
prospect by spring. 
Kanming reported (Feb. 1) that in Hsiafangtung Hsiang, Chinning Haien, Yunnan, "struggle meetings" 
revealed the attempts of landlords to scatter properties, but as a result of the meetings these 
properties now are being confiscated or requisitioned. Nanchang reported (Jan. 24) that in 
Liuchia Hsiang, Hsinkan Hsien, Kiangsi, poor farmer Liao Chung-hsiang had lost his fear of 
landlords to the extent of delivering to authorities 17 cases of silver dollars, white fungi, 
cloth, and other valuable articles that landlord Liao Liang-mo had hidden in his house. 
Nanchang said (Feb. 3) that 10 farm families in Tenglung Hsiang, Nankang Hsien, Kiangsi, hid 
more than 7 million yuan worth of cloth for landlords. They decided to divide the cloth, but 
when they learned of the increased production and austerity program they sold it instead, buying 
10 head of oxen, 12 water machines, and a large amount of fertilizer. ? 
Peking reported in numeral code (Jan. 29) that in all parts of Central and South China rural 
cadres would start during the spring festival to prepare for a "full-scale reexamination" of land 
reform, in view of reports that "a growing lack of enthusiasm in the work prevails among rural 
working cadres," who "always lost their zeal" when it became necessary to "further mobilize the 
masses and organize their ranks to initiate the fierce struggle against the landlord class." 
Wuhan announced (Jan. 23) that a reinvestigation of land reform "to mobilize the broad masses to 
struggle against landlords" had been started in 3,780 hsiang of Klangsul 350 hsiang of Hunan, and 
in parts of Bonen Nanchang reported (Feb. 3) that in Wuhsing Hsiang, Kueichi Hsien, Kiangsi, 
a cadre, Li Ko-jena received land under the land reform program. He immediately started to live 
a "lavish life," was accused of extravagance by the farmers, and was removed from his position. 
Shanghai announced (Feb. 1) that distribution of land had been bstsically completed in 1,569 
hsiang of north Anhwei) but had been "delayed until spring" in 109 hsiang. No reason for the delay 
was given. Chungking reported (Jan. 30) that landlords had been liquidated and farmers associa-
tions organized in 20 hsiang of Yuchi Haien, Yunnan, in the past 2 months. However, the hsien 
Party Committee had to send inspectors to the villages, as reports were received that the cadres 
were confiscating land for their own use. 
-Peking announced in numeral code (Feb. 2) that in North China this year the peasants will increase 
their mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and "march in the direction of a preliminary 
collectivization." Already 55 percent of the households in Worth China are organized, and many 
short-term mutual-aid teams have become permanent, with collectively-owned equipment. However, 
this organization was not obtained without resistance, as the broadcast adds that the hesitancies 
In the minds of the peasants, "such as the fear that they will be required to eat meals cooked in 
a big pot for everybody, or that it is better not to display or sham one's wealth," have been 
:leered away. 
:OUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES ? 
'he suppression of counterrevolutionaries was almost entirely neglected by the Chinese radio during 
-he past 2 weeks. Dairen announced (Jan. 23) that 10,000 persons saw the public trial of counter-
-evolutionaries in Hanchia village, Chu 4, Dairen, Jan. 21. Liu Hsing-wen? Liu Te-tai, Han 
wang-fu, and Chiang Chi-i were summarily executed, and others were sentenced to prison. Dairen 
dded (Feb. 2) that in Chin Hsien counterrevolutionaries have been basically cleared out, with the 
ast group captured Dec. 26 and tried by the People's Court. Mukden, however, announced (Jan. 30) 
nat cadres in Chinchow, Dairen, and Port Arthur were intensifying their instruction in the 
appression of counterrevolutionaries, with 64o teachers engaged in the work in the Dairen-Port 
ethur area. Nanchang reported (Feb. 2) that farmers of Yunghsiu, Kiangsi, had signed a mutual 
rotection and aid pact to guard each other's property and jointly suppress counterrevolutionaries. 
masking announced (Jan. 25) that in the first half of December there were nine murder cases in 
Tahsien and Chienko Special Administrative Districts, north Szechwan, resulting in the death of 
JC revolutionary markers, village cadres, and progressive peasants, as well as a number of arson 
xi poison cases.

NATIONAL MINORITIES 
Only a few claims of progress apiong the national minorities were monitored. Sian reported (Jan. 25 
that the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee had called the Second Annual Animal 
Husbandry and Veterinarian Work Conference, which would devote its efforts to improving livestock, 
and would send 300 cadres of all nationalities to work in the grazing areas. Sian said (Jan. 30) 
that Ma Wen-ling and Ma Ching-shan led Moslem groups in Yinchuan in writing a letter to Mao Tse-tunl 
pledging the cooperation of Moslem groups in the anticorruption campaign. Chungking announced 
(Jan. 26) that minority training classes and minority government councils had been set up in Ipin, 
Mapien? Leipo, Loshan, and Lu Hsien, south Szechwan, with 470 cadres from minority groups in 
important positions and many others at the village level. In Lu Hsien there now were 2,000 Miao 
students, while special educational and health facilities had been provided for minority groups 
in Leipo Rsien. 
Kunming announced (Jan. 30) that cadres in minority training classes at Paoshan sent a letter of 
thanks to Mao for the fact that this year, unlike former years, minority groups were allowed to 
participate in spring festivities. Minority groups contributed 478,854,941 yuan and 169,304 pieces 
of clothing to Lichiang earthquake victims. One woman in Chu 5, Kunming, had only two suits of 
clothing, but was willing to Contribute one of them. Kunming said (Jan. 25) that the Paoshan 
democratic comfort teem had arrived at the Yunnan border, where "tribal minorities expressed 
their full support of the Government and swore to defend its borders against any invasion." 
SINO-SOVIET FRIENDSHIP 
The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association designated February as "Soviet Friendship Month," and 
launched a campaign for publicizing good relations between China and the USSR and the debt of 
China to the Russians. Through Feb. 3 the Chinese radio gave surprisingly little response to 
the program, though it had been announced several weeks earlier. 
Mukden outlined (Jan. 25) the program, instructing all organizations to "publicize that the USSR is 
the strong fortress of the World Peace Democratic Front, that the USSR is the strongest and most 
progressive Nation of the world, that Soviet achievements have increased the strength of the Front,
