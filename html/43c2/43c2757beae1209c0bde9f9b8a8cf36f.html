 Sept. 16, 1954
 Liu Shao-chi described the adoption of the Constitution as the
 primary task of the present session of the Congress and a great
 historic event in the life of the Nation.  The Draft Constitution
 would become the fundamental law of the State after adoption by the
 present session, he said.
 The Committee for the Drafting of the Constitution, headed by Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung, had been formed in January 1953 by the Central People's
 Government Council.  In March this year the Committee had received
 a Draft Constitution from the Central Committee of the Communist
 Party of China.  After thorough discussion for 2 months by 8,000
 representatives of democrattc parties, popular organizations, and others,
 a draft had been published for public discussion on July 14.
 The present amended draft now before the session of the Congress was
 the result of more than 2 months of keen Nationwide discussion in which
 150 million people participated and took into consideration the
 numerous proposals and amendments that had been sent in and had
 been approved by the Central People's Government Council on Sept. 9.
 Liu Shao-chi first outlined the historic significance of the Draft
 Constitution.
 The Draft Constitution, he said, rested on the foundation of the complete
 victory won by the Chinese people in their prolonged struggle against
 imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.  It rested on the
 firm establishment of the People's democratic State led by the working
 class and based on the worker-peasant alliance.  It rested on the
 powerful Socialist economy which is playing a leading role in China's
 economic life, and the fact that theprocess of transformation has begun
 in the gradual transition toward Socialism.  Based on these facts, Liu
 Shao-chi went on, China's Constitution was a Socialist, not a bourgeois
 type of constitution.
 The Present Draft Constitution embodied the historical experience both
 of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and the constitutional
 movement of China in the modern period.  It embodied the interests and will
 of the Chinese people and of the great changes in the country.  It also
 drew from the experience of other countries, especially from that
 of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.
 The struggle between revolution and counterrevolution had never ceased
 during the past 100 years or more.  It was reflected, on the question
 of the State system, in three different constitutional forms demanded by
 three different social forces.

 Page 2--First, there had been the bogus constitutions drawn up by
 the rulers of the Manchu Dynasty, the northern warlords and the
 Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang, who were opposed even to bourgeois democracy
 and never really wanted a constitution,  When these were on their
 last legs, they schemed to save themselves with the help of such bogus
 constitutions.  They failed. and all their "constitutions" became mere
 scraps of paper.
 Secondly, as regards the. constitution of a bourgeois democratic republic
 which the Chinese national bourgeoisie in past years used to yearn for,
 Liu Shao-chi said that no such constitution had ever been established in
 China except for the provisional constitution that arose  out of the 1911
 revolution.  This was immediately scrapped by warlord Yuan Shih-kai.
 Many nations did become bourgeois republics after throwing off
 feudalism, Liu Shao-chi pointed out.  However, this was a mere illusion in
 semicolonial and semifeudal China because the Chinese bourgeoisie was
 unable to lead the people to defeat the combined forces of foreign
 imperialism and domestic reactionaries.
 Thirdly, there is the constitution of a people's republic, led by
 the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, which
 the present session of the National People's Congress had before it for
 enactment,  This democratic and Socialist constitution conformed to the
 interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people.  It
 would be the only genuine constitution China had ever had, Liu Shao-chi
 stated,
 The Draft Constitution also summed up the new historical experiences
 since the founding of the People's Republic of China 5 years ago, during
 which period the common program adopted by the Chinese People's Political
 Consultative Conference in 1949 acted as a provisional constitution.
 In these 5 years, China had ended her former position as a colony or
 vassal state under the rule of foreign imperialism, and because an
 independent State.  She had emerged as a great power in the world.
 Together with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, she
 had become a bulwark in the defense of world peace.  She had put an end
 to feudalism and long years of chaos and had achieved unprecedented
 unification over the entire mnainland and unity among the nationalities.
 Where before the people had no political power, now in the main democracy
 had been built up.  In 5 years, China had rehabilitated a national
 economy ruined by the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries
 and started Socialist construction, thanks to the enthusiasm and
 initiative of the people and to the assistance of her great ally, the
 Soviet Union.

 Page 3--The great changes during the past 5 years provided a vivid
 answer to a fundamental and repeatedly debated question in modern
 China--which way to go, capitalism or Socialism?  The past 5 years had
 provided that the'only correct road forward for China was to attain
 Socialism--in which the economy is single and unified--from the present
 society, in which the economic structure was complicated, Liu Shao-chi
 stated.
 In fact, China had entered on the road to Socialism and as from 1553 had
 entered into planned economic construction, with Socialism as the objective.
 Therefore it was necessary to take a step forward, on the basis of the
 common program, and make a constitution to affirm in legal form the central
 task of the State during the transitional period, which called for the
 step-by-step Socialist industrialization of the country, the gradual
 Socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist
 industry and commerce.
 Liu Shao-chi then gave some explanation of the basic content of the Draft
 Constitution.
 On the character of the State in China, Liu Shao-chi said the fact that
 it was led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance
 indicated that China was a country of people's democracy in which the
 overwhelming majority were the true masters of the State, in sharp
 contrast with capitalist countries, in which the ruling bourgeoisie
 formed only a minority.
 He described the broad people's democratic united front in China, and stressed
 the continuous strengthening of the worker-peasant alliance which also
 included the alliance with individual handicraftsmen and other
 individuals engaged in nonagricultural labor.  This was the basic
 guarantee for the successful leadership of the working class, he said.
 The People's Democratic United Front, he added, led by the working class
 and composed of all democratic classes, democratic parties and people's
 organizations--based on and broader than the worker-peasant alliance--
 was playing an important role in China's transition period to Socialism.
 Liu Shao-chi said that a national bourgeoisie continued to exist in
 China during the transition period.  But due to the specific historical
 conditions of China's oppression by foreign imperialism, there hay:
 been not only struggle but also alliance between the working class
 and the national bourgeoisie.  The State also united patriotic people
 of all other class forms in society, especially those of the various
 national minorities.

 The great revolutionary unity of the entire Chinese people, led by the
 working class, Liu Shao-chi pointed out, was necessary not only to the
 Chinese People's Revolution, but also to the realization of Socialism
 since imperialism still existed.  Our Constitution must therfore be one
 ,or the great unity of the people of the entire country in building a
 Socialist society, Liu Shao-chi declared.
 Dealing with the problem of building a Socialist society in a peaceful
 manner, Liu Shao-chi enumerated the forms through which Socialist trans-
 formation would be carried out.  The cooperatives--a partial collective
 ownership by the working people--was the main form of Socialist
 transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, while capitalist industry
 and commerce were being transformed through State capitalism.
 Liu Shao-chi pointed out that as distinct from the capitalist countries,
 in China Socialist revolution could be achieved not through the overthrow
 of the capitalist State system but through step-by-step Socialist
 transformation.  This was because China was a people's democratic
 country led by the working class, because the Socialist economy owned
 by the State had already become the leading force and the capitalist
 sector was not dominant in the national economy.
 Liu Shao-chi particularly referred to the Socialist transformation of
 capitalist industry and commerce that would take place step by step
 over a considerable period through the-various forms of State capitalism.
 Any member of the national 'bourgeoisie world have appropriate work, and
 the livelihood and work of any member of the national bourgeoisie who was
 willing to accept the Socialist transformation, observe the laws, and not
 undermine the people's property would be appropriately arranged by the
 State.  They would not be deprived of their political rights.
 Our policy and methods in building Socialism were perfectly correct, Liu
 Shao-chi said, referring to the clamor by China's enemies, who had a?great
 dislike for her Socialist principles, and the disappointment..of sections
 of the foreign capitalist press that China had taken the road traversed
 by the Soviet Union--the road that all human societies would inevitably
 take according to the laws of historical development.
 Liu Shao-chi next spoke on the Chinese people's democratic political
 system and the rights and duties of the people.

 The people's congress system was the political syzter which conformed
 to the nature of the State. The Draft Constitution stipulated that
 all State organs, from the State Council to the Local People's
 Councils at the lowest level, were established, supervised, or removed
 from'office where necessary by the National People's Congress or the
 Local People's Congresses elected by the people.
 The Standing Committee elected by the National People's Congress and'the
 chairman of the People's Republic of China would jointly
 perform the function and exercise the power of the head of the State,
 but neither of them had powers above those of the National People's
 Congress.
 Important State affairs were not decided by a single individual or a
 few individuals. Important affairs affecting the whole Nation had to be
 discussed and decided upon by the National People's Congress, or its
 Standing Committee, and important local affairs had to be discussed
 and decided upon by the Local People's Congresses.
 China's political system had a high degree of centralization, Liu
 Shao-chi stated, but it was based on a high degree of democracy.
 Criticizing some foreign bourgeois press comments on the Draft
 Constitution, he said these people measured China's political system
 by bourgeois standards and missed the biggest and most fundamental point--
 the fact that the Chinese people, led by the working class, had become
 the masters in their country.
 Liu Shao-chi enumerated freedom of speech, the press, assembly,
 association, procession, and demonstration, enjoyed by the Chinese people
 and materially facilitated by the State as established in the Draft
 Constitution, in addition to a number of other rights including the
 freedom of religious belief. The broad masses of the people in any
 capitalist countries, he said, had not enjoyed and could not enjoy such
 broad individual freedom as the Chinese people enjoy.
 Our State gives every consideration to individual interests, he went on;
 the public interests of our State and society cannot diverge from
 individual interests. The State also gave every protection to the public
 interests of the country and society, which were the very foundation on
 which to satisfy the individual interests of the masses of the
 people.
 On the  duties of the people, he said that the Chinese people have both
 full democratic power and full obligations toward the State.

 Page 5--Liu Shao-chi then noted that the age-old system of national
 oppression had been abolished.     Since the founding of the People's
 Republic of China, China had become a great family of free and equal
 nationalities, he declared.
 The Draft Constitution reflected the common interests of all the nationalities
 in China.  It stated that China was a unified, multinational State and that
 all the areas of national autonomy were inseparable parts of the People's
 Republic of China.
 The Draft Constitution also insured that all the national minorities
 were genuinely able to exercise their right of autonomy wherever they
 li;e in numbers.
 Liu Shao-chi emphatically pointed out that the Han nationality, who were
 more advanced than the other nationalities in political, economic, and
 cultural development, had the special obligation of helping the
 development of the fraternal nationalities.
 Building a Socialist society was the common objective o; all nationalities
 of China, he went on.  In v,,riew of the different historical conditions of
 the nationalities, the question o" when and how the Socialist transforma-
 tion would be carried out would vary.  The people of the various nationalities
 must ':.e free to follow their own desires in making their decisions, he
 stressed.
 The Constitution, reflecting the experience and aspirations of the
 people would be a great, active factor in the life of the Chinese
 state, Liu Shao-chi stated.  It would be an inspiration to the mass of
 the people in their struggle to safeguard and develop the fruits of
 China's victory, to smash all schemes of enemies who attempted to under-
 mine China's social and State systems, and to strive for making China's
 construction more perfect and quickening its tempo.
 Liu Shao-chi said that the passage of the Constitution would bring joy to
 the Chinese people and to China's friends throughout the world.e
 Constitution established China's fundamental policy in international
 affairs as that of working for the cause of world peace and the progress
 of humanity.
 What China had achieved and would achieve would be helpful to the common
 cause for peace and progress of the people of the world, Liu Shao-chi
 said, and to strive for lasting world peace was a necessary condition for
 China's Socialist construction.
