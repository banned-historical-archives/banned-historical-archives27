 TIME TO STOP OUR ALLIES FROM
 AIDING OUR ENEMIES
 (Mr. GURNEY (at the request of Mr.
 GRoss) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 . Mr. GURNEY.  Mr. Speaker, I am in-
 troducing a bill to prohibit any vessel or
 shipping line doing business with the
 Communists in North Vietnam from
 carrying U.S. cargoes.  The shocking
 fact, that in 1965 there were more free
 world ships than Communist ships en-
 gaging in trade with North Vietnam,
 makes the legislation which I propose to-
 day of vital concern to every American.
 The bill I propose today amends the
 Merchant Marine Act by providing that
 no article shall be transported aboard
 vessels of any shipping interest which
 allows vessels under its control to be
 used in trade with North Vietnam.
 The exact figures for free world ship-
 ping into Haiphong are classified infor-
 mation which the State Department will
 not release to the American people. Ho
 Chi Minh, Mao Tse-tung, and Kosygin
 all know, but it is top secret information
 to be kept from the American people.
 But through the fog that surrounds the
 issue, it is clear that our allies are giving
 invaluable aid to the Vietcong-107 of
 the 119 allied ships known to have en-
 tered the port of Haiphong in 1965 flew
 flags of NATO countries.
 The State Department claims that be-
 cause much of the material traded is not
 strategic,  this  doubledealing  by  our
 allies is somehow all right. It seems to
 me that one does not have to be a trained
 diplomat to see beyond that argument.
 The more nonwar goods that are carried
 on free world ships, the more Communist
 ships are freed for war materials.  It
 seems equally obvious that to a war econ-
 omy such as North Vietnam's, the pro-
 vision of any goods, whether they are war
 supplies or domestic necessities, is giving
 them aid and comfort.
 Those shipping lines which pick up
 cargoes in American ports would either
 have to give up their Vietcong business
 or ours.   Great Britain, probably the
 worst offender, claims that it has no con-
 trol over its private shipping lines except
 in wartime.  They have made no move
 to comply with the official requests of
 our Government that they cease their
 North Vietnam trade. My bill would take
 the problem out of the hands of the
 diplomats and the British Government
 and let us deal directly with the offend-
 ing shippers.
 It is no wonder that Hanoi thinks it
 can scare the United States out of Viet-
 nam.  Although we fight on land, we
 make no effort to blockade or otherwise
 prevent our own allies from loading and
 unloading merchandise in Haiphong. If
 this would not convince Ho Chi Minh
 that our involvement there is a half-
 hearted one, nothing would.
 We already have a similar cargo ban
 on those ships trading with Cuba, and
 we are not at war with them.  Why
 ,should we not operate such a blacklist
 against ships aiding a regime that is daily
 killing our American boys?
 I call upon the Johnson administration
 for immediate passage of this bill. We
 are engaged in a major war. We should
 take the necessary actions to conclude
 this war. This action is simple, easy, and
 long overdue. Let us do it.
 (Mr. SCHWEIKER (at the request of
 Mr. GRoss) was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 [Mr. SCHWEIKER'S remarks wi   p-
 pear hereafter in the Appendix.
 THE REASON WHY  THE       7NITED
 STATES IS IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.   Under
 a previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from Illinois [Mr.  PUCINSKII                                                 is
 recognized for 15 minutes.
 Mr. PUCINSKI. Mr. Speaker, yester-
 day the President of the United States
 addressed the school administrators con-
 vention in Atlantic City and put into its
 proper perspective the whole question of
 why the United States is in Vietnam. He
 also stated unequivocally that the United
 States will not be driven out of Vietnam.
 It is my hope that those who have been
 carrying on the vendetta against Amer-
 ica's participation in the struggle for
 freedom in Vietnam will heed what the
 President said yesterday and will study
 carefully the testimony presented by
 General Taylor today before the other
 body.
 The President quite properly pointed
 out that the issue in Vietnam is not a
 struggle over a piece of real estate known
 as South Vietnam but, rather, a struggle
 in support of a fundamental question
 as to whether we will give the Commu-
 nists an opportunity to develop this en-
 tirely new type of warfare all over the
 world.
 In order to understand our involve-
 ment in Vietnam we must understand
 several other things.  This country has
 built up an awesome Defense Establish-
 ment, so awesome that it has made major
 war totally unthinkable for the world.
 There is no question that our fleet of
 Polaris submarines and our Strategic Air
 Command with its B-52's and our guided
 missiles; which are capable of sending
 nuclear warheads across continents and
 oceans, have certainly helped us finally
 to reach that point in the world's cross-
 road when the major powers realize that
 any major military confrontation will be
 too costly and too devastating for all
 sides involved.   We have made world
 holocaust too costly for anyone to seri-
 ously consider a major nuclear third
 world war.   There can be no question
 that our vast Military Establishment is
 today proving itself the very deterrent it
 was designed to be against a third world
 war.  The fact that neither the Soviet
 Union nor China have joined Hanoi on a
 major scale proves conclusively that
 major war would appear to be out of the
 question at this time.
 So the Communists have now gone the
 other way. They have developed a new
 technique, a technique which they call
 wars of liberation but which are noth-
 ing more than wars of subversion and
 terrorism against the established order
 in nation after nation; small, dirty wars,
 but no less devastating to the institu-
 tions of freedom where they are not
 stopped.
 Two weeks ago I described here on
 this floor-and my remarks appear in
 the RECORD of January 20, on page 822-
 the blueprint that the Communists have
 spelled out for similar wars such as they
 are waging in Vietnam today to be
 waged on three major continents of the
 world, that is, in Asia, in Africa, and in
 spelled out their blueprint for world con-
 quest through terrorism and subversion
 during their Tricontinental Congress
 which was held in Havana, Cuba, from
 January 1 through January 15.
 Now, how foolish could we be to walk
 away from South Vietnam today when
 the  Communists  have  publicly, an-
 nounced that they intend to proliferate
 this new concept of terror and subver-
 sion in every single nation on three con-
 tinents if they get away with such sub-
 version in South Vietnam?
 How can anyone fail to see what
 devastating plans the Communists have
 for a whole series of "Vietnams," when
 they have boldly, brazenly, and arro-
 gantly told us-in public-of their new
 attacks on the institutions of freedom
 on three continents?

 of the help we are receiving in Vietnam,

 Zealanders, as well as the South Koreans
 and the United States, who else is shed-

 killed in Vietnam?
 Mr. PUCINSKI. May I say to my very
 distinguished colleague, the gentleman
 from Iowa LMr. Gaoss], who is a mem-
 ber on the Committee on Foreign Af-
 fairs-and I respect him for his good
 and sound judgment-I know that the
 gentleman knows perhaps better than
 most Members of Congress, by virtue of
 the fact that he is on the Committee on
 Foreign Affairs and is privy to many
 things that. perhaps the rest of its do not
 have-that  this  is  a  troubled  world.
 There  are many  trouble  spots.     Our
 allies are making their contributions in
 various parts of the world.      Perhaps
 they cannot be with us in Vietnam to the
 extent we would like to have them par-
 ticipate.  Take the British, for instance.
 They are holding Malaysia.  Also there
 are other places around the world in
 similar situations.
 Mr. GROSS.  I did not know there
 was a war going on in Malaysia.
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  There  is not, but
 there certainly would be war if we did
 not have the forces over there to main-
 tain  peace.  Take,                                                                                                                 for  instance, the
 Middle East, and take many other parts
 of the world. We have a peacekeeping
 force now  in the Middle  East.  The
 gentleman from Iowa knows the situa-
 tion is not that simple.  One cannot say
 that we have a problem in Vietnam and,
 therefore,  that we must  concentrate
 every effort there on the part of our
 allies, because that in itself would be an
 invitation to other aggressors, other ag-
 gressions, and other upheavals which
 would only confront us to a greater de-
 gree at other places.
 Mr. Speaker, the pattern is very clear.
 I certainly would like to see more of our
 allies assist us in Vietnam.  I join the
 gentleman from Iowa in that expression,
 if that is what the gentleman is sug-
 gesting.  I join him in that hope.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr. Speaker, if the gen-
 tleman will yield further, the gentleman
 well knows that from 139 nations in the
 world we are receiving no assistance,
 no help at all with reference to the war
 which is going on in North Vietnam.
 This is what requires the drafting of the
 youth of this country.  I do not like it a
 bit.
 Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from
 Illinois will come to my office I will show
 the gentleman a complete rundown com-
 piled by the Department of State in the
 last few days, showing just how little the
 rest of the world is helping us in North
 Vietnam.
 Mr. PUCINSKI.   I  agree  with  the
 gentleman from Iowa, and the gentle-
 man knows that I have taken the floor
 many times urging that our allies give
 us greater support.  But, having said
 this, I am sure the gentleman is not

 APPLAUDING RECENT ACTIONS BY
 BUREAU OF THE BUDGET
 (Mr. HENDERSON (at the request of
 Mr. DE LA GARZA) was granted permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in
 the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. HENDERSON. Mr. Speaker, it is
 indeed timely and fitting that the Direc-
 tor of the Bureau of the Budget, Hon.
 Charles Schultze, and his Deputy, Hon.
 Elmer Staats, be complimented on recent
 manpower  management  improvement
 actions by these able administrators.
 I have been advised by Mr. Staats that
 the Budget for the Department of De-
 fense provides for 58,000 additional ci-
 vilian spaces for the military services to
 replace able-bodied military men now in
 such support jobs as:  chauffeurs, car-
 penters, painters, office equipment oper-
 ators, and budget analysts with civil
 service  personnel.    These  military-
 trained men, by returning to their com-
 bat units, will not only bolster our de-
 fense posture but also in time this pro-
 gram will save the Government several
 million dollars annually. This action by
 Bureau of the Budget officials is in ac-
 cord with a request of the Manpower
 Subcommittee last August to the Secre-
 tary of Defense and to the Director of
 the Bureau of the Budget.
 Mr. Staats also indicated that the Bu-
 reau's personnel ceiling control policy
 has been revised so that temporary, part-
 time, and intermittent employment are
 no longer under a specific numerical
 ceiling. This change will give the Gov-
 ernment's managers some greater flexi-
 bility in handling their personnel prob-
 lems.  In a request to the Director of
 the Budget last April, I indicated that
 a change in personnel ceiling controls
 would also save the Government money.
 Several departments and agencies have
 so indicated this to the Manpower Sub-
 committee.
 The Deputy Director of the Budget
 stated that action has also been taken in
 Defense, Post Office, and the General
 Services Administration to use Federal
 employees in lieu of contracting out for
 personal  services.  The  subcommittee
 ,has determined from the experience of
 several Government activities that the
 use of contractors to perform work nor-
 mally handled by civil service workers is
 often more costly than in-house opera-
 tions, but also the Government loses a
 definite control over the work.  Fre-
 quently the subcommittee has been told
 by management officials of departments
 and agencies that limited civilian per-
 sonnel ceilings have in the past been a
 Mr. WHITE of Texas.  Mr. Speaker,
 today, the organization popularly known
 as LULAC, the League of United Latin
 American Citizens, observes its 37th an-
 niversary.  Organized in Corpus Christi,
 Tex., February 17, 1929, the league has
 become one of the outstanding groups of
 our Nation for the fostering of good citi-
 zenship.
 . Because the national headquarters of
 the League of United Latin American
 Citizens is located in my city, El Paso,
 Tex.; because five of its past national
 presidents have been residents of my
 district; and because I have personally
 seen the results of this organization's
 many contributions toward good citizen-
 ship, I would like to call the attention of
 the  House  to  LULAC's  outstanding
 record.
 The league carries on a constant pro-
 gram of citizenship classes, to aid pros-
 pective citizens of Latin American birth
 to become well grounded in fundamental
 principles of our Government before be-
 coming naturalized.  It conducts annual
 campaigns of voter registration and
 voter qualification.
 In the field of education, the League
 of United Latin American Citizens did
 some important pioneering from which
 the whole Nation is today reaping re-
 wards.  In 1956, the LULACS initiated
 what was called "The Little School of the
 internationally noted news commenta-
 tor, reporter, and author, substituted for
 ABC Commentator Edward P. Morgan on
 February 11, 1966, and gave one of the
 finest interpretations I have yet to read
 in cogent form of the role of our country
 in Vietnam-why we are there, and why
 we must be there for our own good and
 that of the free world. It is truly a su-
 perb presentation, and I am pleased to
 offer it to my colleagues.
 Mr. Smith, a native of my State of
 Louisiana and a fellow student at Tulane
 University 30 years ago, takes up the of t-
 quoted cliches of the opponent's of our
 policy and actions in Vietnam, and re-
 futes them with logical clear analysis-
 -analysis based on the experience of his-
 tory.
 Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased
 to insert into the RECORD this fine news
 commentary by my good friend, Howard
 K. Smith.  The commentary, broadcast
 on February 11, 1966, follows:
 EDWARD P. MORGAN AND THE NEWS,
 FEBRUARY 11, 1966
 (Howard K. Smith substituting for
 Edward P. Morgan)  .   .
 The chief event in Washington this week
 has been the hearings on Vietnam in the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   The
 committee, and the public, have heard two
 witnesses fairly critical of what we are ac-
 tually doing in Vietnam.  Next week, Secre-
 tary of State Rusk and Gen. Maxwell Taylor
 will appear before the committee and refute
 some of the points made this week by Gavin
 and Kennan.  But a long weekend will have
 passed.   The North Vietnamese  will have
 time to nourish a little more the only be-
 lief sustaining them-that America is ser-
 iously split; and the administration has no
 answers to critics' points.  As many of the
 points made by critics are extremely doubt-
 ful, I beg to suggest the case against them.
 One statement, made so often in the hear-
 ings, that it is becoming an accepted cliche
 is-America is trying to police the whole
 world, and we can't do it.   The truth is,
 America's  actions have been highly selec-
 tive.  There was for some years a war in
 the Congo.  We took no part.  There was a
 severe crisis in Cyprus that nearly sent our
 allies Greece and Turkey, to war.  We took
 no leading part in it.  The Rhodesian crisis
 is being left to Britain, though as a loyal
 ally we give moral support.   There is a
 threatened crisis between Israel and Jordan
 over use of Jordan river waters.   We have
 said no word and are in no way planning to
 intercede.   The  list could  be lengthened.
 There is simply no evidence whatever for
 the cliche that we are being the universal
 policeman.
 Another proposition stated so often that
 people are tired questioning it is-It was
 a tragic blunder to get committed in South
 Vietnam in the first place.  Well, take your
 mind back to when we did, 1954, and think
 about it.  A war by a minority of Communist
 guerrillas was raging in Malaya, south of
 Vietnam.   Nearby in Burma guerrilla raids
 from China were being made.  Had we re-
 fused to intercede and give South Vietnam
 help, Malaya might might well have gone
 Communist, Burma as well-and the small,
 weaker countries in Asia.   India would be
 In much greater peril and the world situa-
 tion much more unstable and dangerous
 than it is.  And, incidentally, an American
 administration that refused to face up to
 a responsibility that important would have
 had a hard time from the American voters.
 Both General Gavin and Mr. Kennan ques-
 tioned that South Vietnam is an important
 commitment at all.  They are certainly right
 400"-to teach a basic 400 English words
 to 5-year-old children whose native lan-
 guage was other than English.  The
 Texas State Legislature made the pro-
 gram statewide and appropriated funds
 for its financing.  Today, a similar pro-
 gram, nationwide in its scope, is known
 as Project Head Start.
 In  the  1950's,  the  LULACS  also
 launched their      nationwide campaign
 against the high school dropout problem.
 Coupled with this, they initiated an im-
 pressive program of college scholarships
 for promising youth of Latin American
 ancestry.  The roll of young men and
 women who  have completed  college
 under this program is long and growing.
 The LULACS, through their many cul-
 tural events, fiestas, concerts, and folk
 dances, have taught all of us the graceful
 charm of Spanish America; and in doing
 so, have enriched our own culture to the
 benefit of all.
 Mr. Speaker, the League of United
 Latin American Citizens, through its
 actions, has proved that racial prejudice
 disappears as education and good citizen-
 ship advance.  For 37 years of solid
 progress  in  promoting  these  worthy
 aims, the League of Untied Latin Ameri-
 can Citizens deserves the gratitude and
 major reason for contracting for wor
 normally  done  by  Government  em
 ployees.
 I applaud these progressive and real-
 istic manpower moves by the Director of
 the Bureau of the Budget.

 that it does not rank with, say, Japan, or
 with Berlin.   The loss of either of those
 would truly carry the cold war to dangerous
 new dimensions. But South Vietnam re-
 mains very important indeed.  The struggle
 going on Is actually for all the southeast
 Asian  peninsula, which  is  of  great  im-
 portance.
 Next to South Vietnam, Laos and Cam-
 bodia are both riddled with guerrilla bands,
 passive, waiting for victory in South Viet.
 nam before they take over those countries.
 In Thailand, south of them, the Vietcong are
 not hiding their preparation.  Peiping radio
 announces once a week its plans to secure the
 takeover of 'T'hailand.  If we were not resist..
 Ing in Vietnam, we would certainly soon have
 to fight in those other places, deep inland,
 with long supply routes, and at every disad-
 vantage.  By resisting where we are we have
 the 7th U.S. Fleet, the world's strongest, able
 to give constant artillery and air support to
 troops-which it could not do inland-and
 we  have short  and  well-protected  supply
 routes from the coast.  There is no doubt
 that we have chosen the, for us, most ad-
 vantageous, least costly, place to make the
 stand.  So, Vietnam is a very important com-
 mitment indeed.
 Botk witnesses have vigorously disagreed
 with the domino theory-the idea that if one
 nation falls, the others topple in a long line.
 But nobody has refuted the facts of political
 life: Success at conquest is infectious among
 greedy dictators.  They need foreign success
 to divert attention from the fact that they
 do very badly at home.  There is no doubt
 that a triumph in one place stimulates the
 urge to try it elsewhere, and if we leave
 Vietnam to them, it can lead to setbacks
 nearly as great as China turning Communist
 In the first place.
 One of the strongest myths of the time is-
 let South Vietnam go to the Communists.
 It will not be China's puppet.  It will be as
 independent of China as Russia's satellites
 are of Russia.  The answer to that is-do not
 overestimate the independence of Russia's
 satellites.  Hardly one of them can fire 10
 rounds without ammunition from Russia, or
 fix a tank or plane without parts from Rus-
 sia.                 What independence they have is very
 modest and very limited.
 In the one important case where a satellite
 flouted  Russia  outright-Tito-the  prime
 condition for success was-America was near-
 by, dominating the Mediterranean and would
 equip Tito fur a mountain war of infinite
 duration.  Those who assure us if we let
 Vietnam go it will be independent, also in-
 sist that we eliminate the one condition that
 makes a degree of independence possible-
 American resistance.
 Senator FUi.narcxr's office anonunced today
 he had received 5,000 letters  due to last
 week's hearings.  He interpreted that to mean
 a vote of confidence in him.  In a nation of
 195 mililon, there is a different way of in-
 terpreting that.                             It may mean there are 194

 SUPPOSE-OUR  RESPONSIBILITIES
 IN VIETNAM
 Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, there
 has come to me from Mr. Tedis Zferins,
 of Chicago, Ill., a copy of a poem written
 by Pfc. Robert E. Blankenship 3 days be-
 fore he was killed in action in Vietnam.
 The poem was sent to the Chicago
 American by someone in the 1st Marine
 Aircraft Wing in Da Nang in Vietnam.
 It will certainly give anyone who will
 take time to read it pause to think about
 our responsibilities.
 I ask unanimous consent, therefore,
 that the poem be printed in the RECORD
 at this point.
 There being no objection, the poem
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 SUPPOSE
 (By Pfc. Robert E. Blankenship)
 Suppose this Sunday morning
 The church bell didn't ring,
 And as you paused upon the step,
 The choir didn't sing.
 Suppose the door was padlocked
 Or maybe nailed up tight.
 Suppose a guard was standing
 There to stop you day or night.
 Suppose you saw Old Glory,
 A dirty, tattered rag.
 And floating high above your town
 Another country's flag.
 Suppose the only sound you heard
 Was soldiers' marching feet
 Suppose the army near your home
 Was of some foreign power
 Sent to march along your streets
 Instead of boys of ours.
 Suppose your friends were carried
 Off to prisons or their deaths
 And all their pleading for a trial
 Was just a waste of breath;
 You say this couldn't happen here,
 We'll pray to God it can't
 For if everyone prays earnestly,
 We must believe it shan't.
 SCHOOL MILK PROGRAM COMBATS
 MALNUTRITION IN THE YOUNG
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, the
 administration's recent decision to cut
 the school milk program by 80 percent
 is going to have a serious effect on teen-
 age America.  The morning and after-
 noon milk breaks which are so common
 in schools across the Nation will largely
 be a thing of the past.
 Many of my colleagues may say that
 malnutrition among teenagers is not a
 serious problem in this, the most pros-
 perous Nation in the world.  Yet an
 article published in 1960 in the New York
 Times indicated that "6 of every 10 teen-
 age daughters suffer serious diet deficien-
 cies."  Research showed at that time
 that more than 5 million girls between
 the ages of 13 and 19 exist mainly on
 snacks, soft drinks, French fries, pizza,
 candy, hamburgers, and waffles.  I seri-
 ously doubt that this problem has solved
 itself in the interim.
 This is- the principal reason for the
 existence of the school milk program.
 The Federal  Government encourages
 young men and women to drink milk--
 nature's perfect food-by helping them
 to pay the costs of morning and after-
 tration has decided that this school milk
 program is not necessary for young peo-
 ple unless they are selected by the school
 administrator as charity cases.
 The Times article goes on to point out:
 Starving teenagers come from rich, poor,
 and middle-class homes.  At a junior high
 school here [Washington], morning hunger
 headaches are common and valuable class
 time is lost when youngsters are sent to the
 nurse. At a senior high school, when break-
 fastless boys fainted at early-morning cadet
 drill,  authorities began a better breakfast
 campaign.
 Mr. President, that morning milk
 break under the school milk program is a
 3215
 way to combat this malnutrition. How-
 ever, unless Congress decides to reject the
 80-percent cut proposal put forth by the
 administration, morning milk breaks will
 be the exception, not the rule.
 I ask unanimous consent that the New
 York Times article be printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 YOUTHS SUFFERING FROM POOR DIETS-SCIEN-
 lusTs FIND MOST ARE MALNOURISHED AND
 NEED ADVICE IN EATING HABITS
 WASHINGTON, March 26.-While Mom and
 Dad are setting the world's best table and
 running up a $78 billion annual food bill,
 6 of every 10 teenage daughters suffer seri-
 ous diet deficiencies.
 Most of the future wives and mothers in
 the United States are so poorly fed that
 scientists call them malnourished.
 Teenage boys are close behind in this
 deficiency.  But nutritionists worry mostly
 about 9 million girls between the ages of 13
 and 19.  More than 5 million exist mainly
 on snacks, soft drinks, french fries, pizza,
 candy,  hamburgers,  and  waffles,  research
 shows.
 Americans are taller, live longer and eat
 15 percent more than they did a half a
 century ago.  But unless the younger gen-
 eration learns about nutrition and fills dan-
 gerous diet gaps with  milk, meat, fruits,
 and vegetables the pendulum could swing
 backward.
 BENSON CITES NEEDS
 "Never have young people been more in
 need of wise advice and guidance on food,"
 Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson said
 this week.
 "Replacing their present faulty food hab-
 its with good ones will take the full cooper-
 ation of parents, teachers, and teenagers
 themselves."
 Schoolwork and alertness suffer when the
 teenage body is lacking in vital food elements.
 It shows up in bad temper, acne or loss of
 stamina. Too often pimples are borne pa-
 tiently as "part of growing up," when they
 are a sign of poor diet.
 A teenage girl, obsessed by beauty, may
 out her intake so drastically that her au-
 thentic long-range glamour is undercut.
 "in her concern for a slim figure," a nu-
 tritionist said, "a girl may gamble with her
 health  by making total  war  on  calories.
 She plunges into a hippo-to-slimmo routine,
 inventing her own reducing diet.
 "Too often she skips valuable potatoes,
 bread, and milk, bypassing entire meals,
 then cancels it out with gooey sweets.    A
 low-calorie diet, if properly planned can in-
 clude every nutrient.  If it doesn't, it's dan-
 gerous."
 CRITICAL YEARS
 The long-term results are impaired health
 and  a  weakening                                   of  future  generations.
 Malnutrition is sometimes connected with
 juvenile delinquency.
 At about 11, a girl's growth spurts, and for
 the next 9  years her body burns a life-
 time high in food energy.  By 16, she should
 reach  her maximum height.   By  18, her
 weight probaby will level off as nature turns
 to firming muscle, bones, and tissues-in
 short, building an adult body.
 The food she eats must fuel this growth,
 at the same time providing teenage energy
 for  jitterbugging,  softball,  hockey,  and a
 hectic school calendar.
 But at the time her body demands a peak
 intake of calories, vitamins and minerals,
 her parents relax discipline over her food
 habits.  Even if they did not, the young
 lady, proudly wearing her first pair of 2-
 inch heels, would issue her declaration of
 diet independence.

 .,No time." she shouts sprinting past the
 breakfast table, or "not hungry."
 The starving teenagers come from rich-,
 poor-, and middle-class homes.  At a junior
 high school here, morning hunger headaches
 are common and valuable classtime is lost
 when youngsters are sent to the nurse.
 At a senior high school, when breakfast-
 less boys,  fainted at early morning cadet
 drill, authorities began a "better breakfast"
 campaign.
 The food habits of these youngsters mirror
 a nationwide teenage famine amid plenty.
 For lunch a girl selects a luscious wedge of
 pie from the cafeteria line.  Watching the
 trays go by, dietitians who plan balanced
 hot meals  see many nutritious, energy-
 packed dishes ignored.
 "They'd  eat three desserts if we didn't
 have a rule against it," one commented.
 Arresting this trend which is rooted in
 ignorance, indifference, or poverty, will take
 a shift in food habits.  In the average home
 a nutritious diet may be had for much less
 than the family spends, but it takes know-
 how.
 FEDERAL  ON-THE-JOB  TRAINING
 PROGRAM EXCELLENT TAXPAYER,
 INVESTMENT
 Mr.  PROXMIRE.  Mr.  President,  I
 have been. one of those Members of the
 Senate who has criticized wasteful Gov-
 ernment spending.  I have introduced
 amendments to reduce proposed spend-
 ing programs in the past. I intend to do
 so in the future.
 But when the Government can show
 that  its  programs not  only  achieve
 social results in improving human wel-
 fare, but also save money for the tax-
 payer, they deserve our audible and en-
 thusiastic support,
 Yesterday, the Secretary of Labor Wil-
 lard Wirtz appeared before a subcom-
 mittee  of the Senate  Education  and
 Labor Committee.
 Mr. Wirtz proved that the Govern-
 ment's on-the-job manpower develop-
 ment training program has helped do a
 superb job of putting unemployed, un-
 skilled workers back to work.  By itself
 this is a worthy goal; but the program
 has also succeeded in paying back to the
 Government and the taxpayer its total
 cost in full within 2 years-simply based
 on the Federal income taxes paid by the
 newly employed workers.
 Of course free enterprises which em-
 ploys these workers in partnership with
 the Government program deserves great
 credit too.
 Here is an example of Government and
 business working together through train-
 ing unskilled workers to achieve three
 mighty important goals: First, to put
 unemployed unskilled men and women
 to work in skilled jobs that pay well;
 second, to reduce the inflation threat by
 bitting the toughest inflationary prob-
 lem-our shortage of skilled workers;
 and, third, to return to the Government
 the full cost of the program within 2
 years with the taxpayer reaping rich
 dividends in subsequent years.
 I ask unanimous consent that a brief
 excerpt from Secretary Wirtz' testimony
 be printed in the RFCOan.
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 NATIONAL TEACHER CORPS WOULD
 ELIMINATE TEACHER SHORTAGE
 IN LOW-INCOME AREAS
 Mr. HART.  Mr. President, few ap-
 propriation requests will come before us?
 during this session, of greater importance
 than the President's recent request for
 funds to support the National Teacher
 Corps.
 Today, our national shortage of ele-
 ]mentary and high school teachers is
 estimated at 100,000 a year, and there
 are about 80,000 teachers in the Nation's
 school systems with substandard cre-
 dentials.
 In the Nation's poverty pockets, where
 there are 5 million schoolchildren whose
 families earn under $2,000 a year, the
 teacher situation is even more grave.
 School budgets in these poverty areas
 cannot be stretched to attract or hold

 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION
 SUPPORTS LIBERALIZATION AND
 EXPANSION  OF  INTERNATIONAL
 TRADE
 Mr. HART.  Mr. President, a distin-
 guished member of the economics de-
 partment of Michigan State University
 and a noted scholar in the field of anti-
 trust and monopoly, Dr. Walter Adams,
 has called to my attention a petition
 signed by 100 members of the American
 Economic Association.
 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400030007-8
 In my considered judgment now, however,
 the controlling consideration is that the on-
 the-job training program has supplied us-
 as a lesson. of proven experience-with the
 answer we were looking for.
 It puts the training almost entirely in the
 employer's hands.
 It has become an effective ineerument for
 implementing national policies which em-
 ployers share with the entire community.
 And it is proving to be an almost histori-
 cally economic program.
 Let  us look  at  thi   program  in hard-
 headed, dollars, and cents terms--in terms of
 who the trainees are, what it costs to train
 therm, what their earning power becomes,
 and what the Government        (which is the
 country) gets back on its investment.
 Here are some of the key facts
 Most of  the OJT trainees  (about two-
 thirds) were unemployed before they joined
 the program.
 We estimate that the average Manpower
 Development and Training Act on-the-job
 tarinee earns $59 a week during 19 weeks of
 training, and $80 a week as a full-time work-
 er after                                                                        his  training.   Thus  the average
 trainee earns $3,761 the first year.
 The cost to the Government of on-the-
 job training averaged a'reout $405 a trainee
 in 1965.  Some cost more, some less.
 According to the Internal Revenue Service
 the average Federal income tax for married
 workers with one child who earn $3,761 a
 year is $211.
 Thus, in the first year, a typie d on-the-
 job trainee repays the Federal Government
 about 43 percent of its total investment in
 him.  Before the second year is over, the
 Government has been repaid in full.
 It is difficult, of course, to and the "aver-
 age" illustration.  Programs vary from the
 most expensive, during which 52 weeks of
 training is provided, to those lasting only 3
 weeks.
 Those trainees already approved will earn
 almost $392 million during their first year
 of training and work.  Their training will
 cost the Federal Government $51 million, of
 which about $20 million will be repaid in
 taxes during the first year, and the remain-
 der the second year.
 On-the-job training programs are a sound
 investment.
 These programs have been warmly received
 by American employers,  who, in the long
 run, must provide the jobs for American
 workers.  The  business community,  along
 with American labor, has cooperated in mak-
 ing manpower Development  and                                                                                     Training
 Act on-the-job training an exciting and suc-
 cessful program.
 ers.  Competing  with  the  wealthier
 school districts for the limited number
 of new and replacement teachers avail-
 able each year, the poverty schools in-
 evitably lose out. Each fall, slum schools
 open with too few good teachers, too
 many  substitute  teachers,  too  many
 temporary teachers, and too many teach-
 ers whose qualifications are far below
 minimum standards.
 The very youngsters who are culturally
 handicapped to begin with-those who
 come  from  families  where  parents,
 brothers, and sisters make up the one-
 fifth of America that has not finished
 elementary school-are being educated
 today by some of our least gifted teach-
 ers.  No wonder that, after 6 or 8 years
 of listless schooling, these boys and girls
 join the ranks of the undereducated un-
 employables-the underprivileged of our
 Nation-who contribute little to our so-
 ciety or our economy.
 Teaching children of the poor takes
 dedication? talent, and  training.   To
 reach a child whose concept of books is
 limited to the comic strips, whose ear is
 attuned only to the simplest verbal ex-
 change, requires a very different ap-
 proach from that used in our schools to-
 day, where every child, regardless of his
 background and abilities, is taught ac-
 cording to standards suitable only for
 the middle-class child whose :home is
 comfortably furnished with books and
 art and conversation. The need, then, is
 not simply one of numbers, but also of
 kind.
 To break out of the tradition of pov-
 erty, disadvantaged youngsters must re-
 ceive the best-not the least-in educa-
 tion.  The Elementary and Secondary
 Education Act of 1965 is a giant stride.
 But although it provided over a billion
 dollars in aid to low-income areas, it does
 not provide the means to attract the
 thousands of men and women with the
 enthusiasm, the dedication, the under-
 standing, and the talent that are essen-
 tial to make effective use of the newly
 available Federal funds.
 The National Teacher Corps will do
 this.
 If we had to single out the most im-
 portant available tool in combating pov-
 erty, it would have to be education.
 This program is perhaps not nearly
 as dramatic as Vietnam, but it is equally
 essential to the well being of the country.
 Our survival in this world depends
 heavily on how well our citizenry flour-
 ishes.  And this, clearly, is one of the
 most effective devices we can employ
 toward the conservation of this Nation's
 human resources.

 February 17, 1966       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 A native of Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., Alex-
 ander Francis Jones attended the University
 of Wisconsin from 1911 to 1914, and began
 his newspaper career as a reporter on the
 Madison State Journal.  One of his early
 assignments was  to travel  with  Senator
 Robert (Fighting Bob) La Follette, the elder.
 He joined the staff of the Minneapolis Jour-
 nal in 1916.
 Casey volunteered for service in World
 War I and was an Army stretcher bearer in
 France.
 STAR UP REPORTER
 After the war, he was a star reporter for
 the "night side" of the old United Press.  He
 covered the Black Sox scandal that shook
 organized baseball in 1919, and he used to
 recall writing about the little boy who ap-
 proached Shoeless Joe Jackson, the great
 outfielder, and pleaded "Say it ain't so, Joe."
 In 1923 Casey returned to the Minneap-
 olis Journal, where he served as sales and
 promotion manager and city editor.
 The late Eugene Meyer, who bought the
 Washington Post at auction in 1933, hired
 Casey as managing editor in  1936.  The
 paper, although bearing a famous name in
 journalism, had gone into a serious decline.
 Jones pitched in to help publisher Meyer
 rescue and rehabilitate it.
 "UPHILL YEARS"
 When Jones left to go to Syracuse in 1950
 after 15 years with the Washington Post-
 12 as managing editor and three as assistant
 to the publisher-the paper said  in an
 editorial :
 "It is hard for us to lose the services of a
 man who has endured the heart and burden
 associated with the creation of an institution
 out of 'a bankrupt property.  Most of his 15
 years were uphill years.  His devotion to his
 responsibilities was catching, his interest in
 his work unflagging."
 When Casey first came to Washington in
 1935, he was introduced to the late Sir Will-
 Mott Lewis, distinguished correspondent of
 the London Times.  Lewis, on being told that
 Casey was the new managing editor of the
 Post, shook his head and said; "Don't you
 know, old boy, that Pennsylvania Avenue is
 paved with the bones of former managing
 editors of the Post?"
 "JUST A GYPSY"
 But Casey stayed around a long time.  His
 brown hair turned gray, and then white, as
 he guided the news department in the Wash-
 ington Post's great comeback period.                         When
 he left, after 15 years, he said he guessed he
 was "just a gypsy."
 He was managing editor throughout World
 War II, and many stories were told about
 him in that tumultuous period.  On the day
 the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, Sunday,
 he rushed from his Wesley Heights home to
 his office, and began rounding up reporters,
 desk men, printers, and pressmen so that the
 Washington Post could get out an extra.
 The extra was about to go to press when
 Robert Tate Allen, then the paper's church
 editor and known to the staff as "Bishop,"
 burst into Casey's office.
 "Hold it, hold it, Mr. Jones," Allen cried,
 "The Reverend * * *, pastor of the George-
 town * * * Church has resigned."
 MURROW "SCOOP"
 Later that night Casey dropped in on a
 party at the home of Harry Butcher, who
 was to become an aid to Gen. Dwight D.
 Eisenhower in. the war.  Among others at the
 party was Edward R. Murrow, the radio com-
 mentator  for  the  Columbia  Broadcasting
 System.
 Murrow had been a dinner guest of the
 Roosevelts at the White House earlier in the
 evening. He had herd of the terrible dam-
 age done at Pearl Harbor-the sinking of the
 Arizona and the Oklahoma and all the rest-
 but he couldn't use it in a broadcast.   He
 had been a guest, and therefore he felt that
 he was "sewed up."
 Casey Jones was under no such inhibition,
 and he saw to it that what Murrow picked
 up at the dinner table got into the Post's
 news columns next morning.  Murrow used
 to carry the clipping of the. story in his
 wallet.  It was a sad reminder of how he got
 the biggest story of his career and could do
 nothing about it.
 FLAG-WAVING PATRIOT
 Fortune. magazine once described Casey
 as "cyclonic, convivial, incurably romantic
 about his profession."
 He was all these, and also an unabashed
 patroit-the flag-waving kind.  In 1942 he
 became impatient with what was being called
 the "war effort," especially with what the
 Government was doing or not doing.
 In 1943 Casey was elected to membership
 in the Gridiron Club, made up of 50 Wash-
 ington newspapermen.  He became one of
 the  club's most  accomplished  performers,
 being possessed of the necessary ham quality.
 Some of his reporters who never saw him
 in a Gridiron skit agreed that he had great
 ability as an actor.  He used to put on his
 most dramatic performance when a reporter
 hit him up for a pay raise.  He would slump
 in his chair and a look of pain would appear
 on his face, causing the reporter to feel that
 he had landed a foul blow.
 Jones is survided by his wife, the former
 Edna Schultz, a daughter, Mary Will of West
 Palm Beach, and two sons-Richard, of Or-
 lando, Fla., and Compton, of Bethesda, Md.
 RITES IN SYRACUSE
 A funeral service will be held in the Park
 Central Presbyterian Church of Syracuse at
 11 a.m. Saturday, after which the body will
 come to Arlington Cemetery.
 Katharine Graham, president of the Wash-
 ington Post Co., said yesterday that Jones
 was "a valued friend and colleague," and
 added:
 "For 15 years he shaped the news policies
 of the Washington Post under my father
 and, later, my husband In an original, ag-
 gressive and exciting manner.  He was the
 model of the tough reporter with a heart
 of gold."
 Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, Democrat of
 New York, said that Jones represented "the
 quest for excellence in American journalism,"
 and added that his "imprint will long sur-
 vive."

 VIETNAM REPOR
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, in a Feb-
 ruary 9, 1966, column published in the
 New York Times, C. L. Sulzberger sup-
 ports a point which I made in my Viet-
 nam report.  He argues that American
 liberals have been much more inclined to
 make concessions to the Communists in
 Europe than in Asia, without realizing
 that the main thrust of the Communist
 threat today is in Asia and that this
 threat must be met where it is posed.
 I ask unanimous consent to have Mr.
 Sulzberger's  article  printed  in  the
 RECORD,
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 FOREIGN  AFFAIRS:  ROOTS  or BEFUDDLEMENT
 (By C. L. Sulzberger)
 PARIS.-International opinion is quite as
 bewildered as American opinion concerning
 U.S. policy in Vietnam.  This Is as true for
 adversaries  of  the  United  States  as  for
 friends.  Senator  FULBRIGHT  was referring
 only to Americans when he said he had never
 seen "such dissent, reservation, groping and
 concern."   But he might just as well have
 been referring to the outer world, choosing
 Russia and China for a start.
 The                    Chinese  proclaim  our  Vietnamese
 policy is part of a Russo-American global
 conspiracy to encircle China. Moscow's friend
 Castro throws the ball back into China's
 court, likening Peiping's actions to those of
 "Yankee   imperialism."  No   wonder   the
 average American gets mixed; Uncle Sam
 can't win.
 NUCLEAR ESCALATION
 The southeast Asian conflict is the first
 since 1945 that contains an implicit danger
 of nuclear escalation-which was never a
 serious threat in Korea.  This implicit dan-
 ger adds a muddled element to political
 thinking on Vietnam.
 Since Hiroshima many U.S. liberals and
 intellectuals have been increasingly reluc-
 tant to endorse Washington's diplomatic ac-
 tions,  especially if they are tough.  Such
 groups have unconsciously developed a mood
 of appeasement especially in Asia, that con-
 trasts with the attitude of liberals and in-
 telectuals toward Europe before World War
 IL
 This pattern is confused by the tradi-
 tional  U.S.  policy  conflict  between                                                                                                                                       "Asia
 first" and "Europe first" schools.  Broadly
 speaking,  American  liberals  have  always
 tended to belong to the latter group.  Fol-
 lowing World War II, U.S. foreign policy
 focused primarily on  European     matters;
 Korea being an exception.
 The "Europe first" school has never been
 happy about accepting risks in the East. It
 took dramatic aggressions like Pearl Harbor
 or the invasion of South Korea to produce a
 consensus on our foreign policy between
 liberal "Europe first" and conservative "Asia
 first" groupings.  The gradual intensifying
 of the Vietnam crisis by disguised aggression
 never achieved the same result.
 Foreign opinion is bewildered for different
 reasons by American involvement in Viet-
 nam.  When the United States was firmly
 wedded to a "Europe first" policy it spurned
 General de  Gaulle's request for a three-
 power committee, the United States, Britain,
 and France, to coordinate global strategy.
 This request, made in 1958, was never seri-
 ously pondered in Washington although De
 Gaulle made it clear that if no such arrange-
 ment were devised he would reduce French
 participation in NATO.
 We have come full circle.   The United
 States now urges its allies to help us in Viet-
 nam but Europe, stripped of its Asian colo-
 nial possessions, is content to pursue its own
 version of a "Europe first" policy.  Europeans
 want to avoid taking sides in communism's
 intramural  dispute  between  Peiping      and
 Moscow.  They are more concerned with the
 problems of German unification than that
 of Vietnam; the present emotional atmos-
 phere of the United States is not felt here.
 DOUBLE SWITCH
 Many Europeans, led by the French, were
 once extremely eager to attract Washington
 into Far Eastern. commitments and an "Asia
 first" policy, a prospect then welcomed by
 American conservatives and opposed by lib-
 erals,  But now that Washington- has moved
 in the direction formerly desired by such
 Europeans, they in turn have shifted to our
 own previous position.
 The "dissent,  reservations, groping,  and
 concern" noted by FULBRIGHT can thus be
 detected abroad also-but for entirely dif-
 ferent reasons.                                                                                                                                          The odd thing is that when

 Both Americans and Europeans who now
 criticize us have been on the same side of
 the policy fence-in fact on both sides--but
 of different times.  Each has managed the
 strange feat of simultaneously reversing its
 position.
 AMERICAN  LIBERALS
 For a third of a century American liberals
 and intellectuals have been more inclined to
 endorse ,appeasement in Asia than in Europe.
 The nuclear danger in Asia has only rein-
 forced this traditional position.  But the U.S.
 Government has shifted the emphasis of its
 policy interests from West to East.
 Some 20 years of hegemony in world power
 politics have apparently persuaded Washing-
 ton that its views always represent the gen-
 eral  Interest--even  when  such  views  are
 switched. Trouble comes when some Amer-
 icans can't get used to the switch and some
 foreigners can't get used to its timing.
 THE PEOPLE'S WAR LAND REFORM
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, I invite
 the attention of Senators to a series of
 four articles which were published in the
 Washington Star, written by Richard
 Critchfield, explaining the war for land
 reform and the problems of pacification.
 Critchfeld details the Saigon land re-
 form program, its failures, and most
 importantly  its  importance  for  the
 masses for Vietnamese peasants. Critch-
 field also argues convincingly that the
 key to future reelections in Vietnam and
 the success of democratic institutions
 hinges upon land reform and the need
 for a pacification program that educates
 and cares for the people and gives their
 a sense of participation as well as pro-
 tects them.  Mr. Critchfield's analyses in
 these respects confirms my own observa-
 Lions from my recent trip to Vietnam.
 I ask unanimous consent to have Mr.
 Critchfield's articles  printed  in  the
 RECORD.
 'T'here being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the REcoac,
 as follows:
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Starl
 TNI'. Psoii,E's WAR:  PEASANTS Tom von THE
 EEART FT, NOT FOR A GOVERNMENT
 (7iy Richard Critchfield)
 (NoTE.--This is the first of four articles on
 the Mekong Delta, South Vietnam's rice bowl.
 Critchfield recently completed an extensive
 tour there.)
 TAN  AN,  SOUTH  VIETNAM.--"This  earth
 which formed their home and fed their bodies
 and made their gods * ? ? "
 The Asian peasant's deep attachment to
 the soil he tills and in which his ancestors
 arc buried, described in Pearl Buck's "The
 Good Earth," is strongly evident here in the
 Mekong Delta rice bowl of South Vietnam.
 It is harvest time now.  The golden fields
 of the great fertile plain between the Me-
 kong. Bassac, and Saigon rivers are dotted
 with men and women winnowing the pre-
 cious rice against tall, curved shelters of
 plaited bamboo so as not to lose a grain.
 In black pajama and pointed strawhats,
 barefoot, bronzed by the January sun, the
 peasants have the sturdy look of men and
 women  who  can  endure  disease,  natural
 disaster, and war so long as they have some
 land to farm.
 But very few have land of their own.    In
 Long An, one of Vietnam's most fertile prov-
 inces, more than 85 percent of the peasant
 population are tenants.
 This landownership pattern may help ex-
 plain why, despite a tremendous cost in lives
 and material, the war in Long An is no
 closer to being won than It was several years
 ago.
 Last year, the heaviest fighting raged in
 the jungles and rubber plantations north of
 Saigon, the rain forests and grasslands of
 the high plateau and in the swamps and
 rice paddies of the narrow central coastal
 plain.
 But if the main theater of war lay else-
 where, the rice-rich heartland of the Saigon
 region and the upper Mekong Delta, linked
 together by Long An, remains the prize for
 which the war is being fought.
 Here, in less than 14 provinces, live almost
 two-thirds of the 15 million South Vietna-
 mese.
 In June 1964, the summer before the Viet-
 cong began massing multibattadion forces
 for pitched battles, Long An was held up as
 the showplace of how a combined Vietna-
 mese-American military and economic pa-
 cification effort could defeat a Communist
 insurrection.
 Visitors went to Long An if they wanted to
 see how the protracted, guerrilla war was
 going on in the countryside.
 But  now,  18  months  later,  little
 has
 changed.
 There
 has been no dramatic turn in
 the
 guerrilla
 fighting; the government has
 won
 some villages and lost some.
 There arc no signs of any serious; deteriora-'
 tion.  But there has been no real improve-
 ment either; since it is primarily a war of
 subversion in Long An, the creeping Com-
 munist initiative simply has crept further.
 Other peasants have replaced the hundreds
 of Vietcong killed in battle, and American
 military  and civilian advisers  agree  there
 are many more Vietcong than a year ago.
 OPPOSING  SIDES
 Most Important in Long An, hr,wever, the
 government and the mass of peasantry still
 seem to be on the opposing sides of the fight.
 None of the successive Saigon governments
 has succeeded  in                        analyzing the  peasants'
 grievances  and  then  tried  to right these
 wrongs,  though  there   are  sign:;                      Premier
 Nguyen Cao Ky's regime is moving in this
 direc Lion.
 Land is of such paramount importance
 here that the Vietcong allow only the land-
 less or very poor farmers in the delta to com-
 mand  guerrilla  units or qualify  as party
 members.
 The provincial government's social order
 is the exact reverse.  Most of the military
 officers, civil servants and community leaders
 come from the landowning gentry.
 The same is true in Saigon, here only 1
 of the 10 generals now sharing power has
 any rapport with the masses.  He is Central
 Vietnam's erratic Maj. Gen. Nguyen Chanh
 Thi, who also is the only one of peasant
 origin.
 The traditional Mandarin ruling class fell
 from power with Ngo Dinh Diem, ''aut their
 political heirs  are  the  nonpeasaut  urban
 middle clasties and their relatives.
 Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge and his
 top aids have made it clear that the United
 States regards major land redistrihkstion as
 essential in successfully prosecuting the war.
 Ky recently announced a land reform pro-
 gram that will initially convey 700,000 acres
 to 180,000 peasants.
 Eventually, the program will be expanded
 to encompass  over  500,000  acres  of  land
 formerly owned by the French, 660,000 acres
 now farmed by "squatters" and 300,000 acres
 where :free titles will be awarded in resettle-
 ment areas.
 The crux of the problem, however, has yet
 to be  tackled.   This is the redistribution
 from big to small owners of more than 2
 million acres in the Mekong Delta.
 Good delta land is worth about $50 an acre;
 it is roughly estimated by the South Viet-
 namese generals that it would cost between
 $150 and $200 million to carry out equitable
 reform programs here.
 Land reform under Diem left a bitter after-
 math, since 2,279 dispossessed landlords were
 paid only 10 percent in cash as compensa-
 tion and given low-interest, nontransferable,
 12-year bonds for the rest.  The bonds since
 have plummeted in value.
 U.S. GENERATING MONEY
 The United States could solve this problem
 by generating $150 million in local currencies
 so that an outright compensation could be
 made.
 It already is generating plasters to pay for
 the Vietnamese share in the war- to the tune
 of  $350  million  this  year--by  giving the
 Saigon Government imported commodities to
 sell to local merchants.
 Both North  Vietnam's Gen. Vo Nguyen
 Giap and the U.S. commander Gen. William
 C. Westmoreland describe the Vietnam con-
 flict as "a people's war," and not "a war of
 attrition."
 Since the emphasis, first, Is on converting
 and, second, on killing, the investment of
 $150 million in land reform to undermine the
 Vietcong's peasant support would seem like a
 bargain in a war that is costing $16.5 million
 a week.
 During the early days of the Diem regime,
 the United States spent $4 million on land
 reform.  From 1961  through 1965 nothing
 was spent. And $1.1 million is budgeted for
 the current fiscal year.
 PROBLEM NOT UNIFORM
 The problem is not uniform throughout
 the country.                              With the  exception  of  the
 Saigon area, the upper Mekong Delta and a
 thin, populated strip along the  coastline,
 South Vietnam                                 is  mostly  empty terrain.
 More than 85 percent of the land total is
 covered with jungle, swampland, or dense
 foliage.
 Along the                                  overpopulated  coastal fringe,
 now heavily burdened with refugees, roost
 farms are small and owner operated and there
 is real land hunger.
 In the, highlands, the problem could be
 solved  siply  by  giving  the  Montegnard
 tribes clear title to land they have farmed
 for centuries.
 The real problem is in the delta.
 Out of 1.2 million farms, only 260,000 are
 owner Operated; 520,000 are rented and 330,-
 000 more are partly rented.
 There are '71 farms of more than 250 acres
 and 85,000 more over 12 acres (though all
 one peasant family can reasonably handle is
 5 to 7 acres).
 Some 3,000 rich Saigon families still are
 the big landlords.
 In Long An, the pattern is even more lop-
 sided.  According to one official U.S. survey
 made last July, 65 rich landlords, 3,000 farm-
 er-owners and 28,000 tenant families com-
 prise the population.
 COULD INFLUENCE ELECTION
 The landownership   pattern   probably
 would significantly influence the outcome of
 a free election, such as envisaged in the 1954
 Geneva agreements.
 Lodge has observed the Communist prom-
 ises of land to the tiller is "perhaps the great-
 est appeal the Vietcong have."
 Why there is so much opposition to sweep-
 ing land reform among some Saigonese is
 suggested by the tremendous wealth of a
 delta Province like Long An.
 In a good year, such as 1963-64, Long An
 produced 320,000 tons of rice (Saigon's an-
 nual requirement is only 600,000 tons.)   It
 also sold that year 10,000 tons of pineapple,

 70,000  tons  of  sugarcane,  plus  chickens,
 ducks, pigs, and other cash earners.
 The legal land ceiling is 220 acres.     Even
 so, a Saigon landlord who charges double the
 legal rental rate of 25 percent, as he can do
 if the land is fertile enough, stands to profit
 as much as $40,000 in a single-year on 220
 acres.
 This compares with a Vietnamese police-
 man's monthly wage of $25, or the monthly
 cash allotment of a Vietcong guerrilla, which
 is 40 cents.
 POLITICAL ATTITUDES AFFECTED
 More important, perhaps, is how this un-
 equal distribution of land affects these po-
 litical attitudes of the Vietnamese.
 What seems to be absent here is the kind
 of political code that Theodore H. White has
 described as President Johnson's "grassroots
 liberalism" :
 "You get yours and he gets his and we
 all share what there Is to share."
 In Long An, this gets no further than
 you  get yours" and he, the peasant, can
 either lump it or try to get his by joining the
 Vietcong.
 But most of the peasants have learned by
 now that under the Vietcong nobody keeps
 his.
 This has created the kind of political
 vacuum where many Vietnamese peasants re-
 gard the war as a pointless slaughter.  They
 still feel they stand to be the losers no
 matter who wins,
 CAUGHT IN VISE
 Caught between. bloodsucking landlords,
 many of whom charge double the legal rents,
 and  pitiless            Vietcong  tax  collectors,  who
 shoot first and talk later, the peasants appear
 ready to call a plague on both sides of this
 indecisive struggle.
 Yet there is an appeal to the Vietcong's
 three main propaganda themes: "Land to the
 tiller," "The soldier helps the peasant," and
 "The government exists for the people,"
 These are novel and explosive ideas to a
 man who works knee deep in mud 14 hours a
 day, growing half his rice for somebody else,
 whose idea of government may be a venal
 local tax collector, and whose chickens and
 ducks may have disappeared when the last
 militia patrol passed through his village,
 If his home has been destroyed or rela-
 tives killed by ill-directed bombs and shells,
 he might make a ready Vietcong convert
 without knowing what for.
 V.H.  MILITARY  FRUSTRATED
 Within the American military command in
 Saigon, there is widespread frustration over
 the failure of pacification efforts in the delta
 provinces like Long An.
 One hears talk that the only way the Viet-
 cong fish can be deprived of the, water in
 which they swim is to make things so hot in
 Communist-held zones that the peasants will
 come over to the government side as refugees.
 Others argue there is no substitute for
 thoroughgoing land reform.
 One veteran American adviser in Long An
 said :
 "These people have country that doesn't
 need a government.  They could go back 2,000
 years and they'd be happy, fish in every pond,
 crabs in every paddy, bananas, coconut, and
 ducks.  All they need is a little land of their
 own to be happy.    Five percent of the Viet-
 namese in this province are honestly pro-
 government by their own personal beliefs and
 ideology, 5 percent are with the Vietcong for
 the same reason and the other 90 percent are
 right."

 THE PEOPLE'S WAR: MILITARY ACTION VERSUS
 LAND REFORM
 (No'E-This is the second of four articles
 on the Mekong Delta, South Vietnam's rice
 bowl.  Critchfleld recently completed an ex-
 tensive tour there.)
 (By Richard Critchfleld)
 TANAN, SOUTH VIETNAM.-A respected Viet-
 namese journalist, when asked why Saigon's
 generals temporized on enacting the kind
 of land reform that most people' agree is
 needed to win the war, replied:
 "They're still convinced it's winnable their
 way, and if not, it's not worth winning."
 This harsh judgment may have more than
 a grain of truth in it.
 Here in Long An Province, in the rice-rich
 heavily populated upper Mekong Delta, the
 Vietnamese officials and Army officers seem
 as fiercely determined as ever to defect the
 Vietcong eventually.
 The Vietnamese still are fighting their own
 war here.
 But local leaders become curt and evasive
 when questioned about land reform or other
 innovations to improve the peasant's lot.
 "All the land we can distribute in secure
 areas, we have distributed already," said one
 senior Vietnamese official.
 Most of these local leaders are reserved,
 sensitive,  French-educated  men,  generally
 respected   by  their  American  advisers as
 "very competent" and  "fine people."     All
 have lived amidst war and violence since
 1939.
 Yet most of the higher ranking ones see
 South Vietnam's salvation in terms of mili-
 tary action rather than political remedies,
 A typical response on how to win the war
 came from a civilian administrator in his
 midthirties:
 "We don't have enough toops.  If the free
 world would go to war with China, then
 OK.  The unique way to win is to attack
 North Vietnam and China.  If not, the war
 of subversion will last another 5 years."
 Asked about the fate of the 3,000 Viet-
 cong of South Vietnamese origin in Long
 An in the event of a cease-fire, the official
 said, "They all must go back to Hanoi."
 His opinion was seconded by a Vietnamese
 officer, "Once the fighting stops, it will take
 us another 2 years to pacify. Long An.  We
 must throw the Vietcong forces out and de-
 stroy the Communist infrastructure."
 A year ago, the U.S. mission in Saigon
 agreed to finance grievance committees in
 each of Long An's six districts in an attempt
 to analyze and then to right the wrongs that
 turn the peasants into Communist guerrillas.
 One Vietnamese officer explained how the
 committees were working out:
 "Each cadre has a small room.  Everybody
 must come in for 5 minutes so as to keep
 security for the man who seeks to tell some-
 thing.  The cadre asks, 'How is your family?
 How is your life?'  In this way, we get infor-
 mation on the Vietcong political organiza-
 tion and make our intelligence net.  The
 grievance committees are the eyes of the
 Province chief,"
 Other officials praised the committees as a
 good way of learning the peasantry's edu-
 cation needs, getting military intelligence,
 controlling the population's movements and
 detecting secret Vietcong cells,
 No one mentioned the genuine grievances
 that the peasants presumably voiced.
 3223
 ATTITUDES DIFFERENT
 Going down the ladder one rung to the
 district officials, however, there seems to be a
 distinct difference in attitudes,
 While most senior Provincial officials are
 from Saigon and make no secret of their per-
 sonal ambition to be transferred back there
 some day, the district officials seem to identify
 themselves much more closely with the local
 peasantry.
 Typical of this group is Nguyen Van Dhien,
 in Long An's most  pacified  district, Thu
 Thua.  A goateed former Vietnamese ranger
 with a reputation as a tough fighter, Dhien
 writes poetry and has let his fingernails grow
 half-an-inch long to show he has risen above
 manual labor.
 Dhien does not think that an invasion of
 North Vietnam would solve anything-and
 he Is a strong advocate of land reform.
 Asked what might happen if there were a
 free election contested by the Communists
 and the Saigon regime in Thu Thua, he said
 that if the Communists promised land re-
 form, they might get the votes of 85 percent
 of the 45,000 who are landless peasants.  In
 contrast, he said, the 8,000 refugees who have
 poured into Thu Thua in recent weeks from
 Vietcong-held territory probably would vote
 for Saigon since most are bitterly anti-Viet-
 cong after experiencing Communist rule.
 Twenty percent of Thu Thua's land, he
 said, is owned by rich absentee landlords
 who live in Saigon and Tan An.
 Unlike the provincial leaders, Thien does
 not think the protracted guerrilla war will
 last long.   "There is a big flame in the
 lamp just before it goes out," he said.
 A third distinct Vietnamese attitude is
 moral indifference to the war, typically ex-
 pressed by the bonze superior of Tan An's
 towering Nguyen Thuy Pagoda.
 During a  conversation  marked  by long
 silences, distant gongs, and burning incense,
 the bonze, a shaven-haired intelligent-look-
 ing man in his midthirties, had no opinion on
 land or any other concrete reform to help
 the peasantry.
 "The Buddhist doctrine is tolerance, not
 violence," he said.   "People move to town
 because they are afraid of bombing and ar-
 tillery.                                                                                                                                   I hope it is possible you can cease
 the  bombing  and     shelling.   Even  where
 there is no engagement made with the Com-
 munist forces, the Americas still bomb, caus-
 ing much harm to the people."
 Most of the refugees, however, do not as-
 sociate airstrikes with the Americans since
 they have seen few foreigners.
 One refugee, Mau, a 49-year-old tenant
 farmer who fled to Tan An with his wife
 and five children a month ago, said his
 hamlet, An Nhut Tan, had long been un-
 der Vietcong control,
 "At home I rented a hectare of rice land
 from a landlord who lived In Lac Tan vil-
 lage.   The VC promised to give us land;
 they called the village chiefs together last
 year to make a land reform plan, but they
 didn't do anything."
 Asked what he thought of the Vietcong,
 Mua stuck his tongue out and made a face
 as if he had bitten into a sour pickle.
 "They usually shoot artillery around my
 house 30 I must move.  Too much bomb-
 ing also since November."
 Since he had no identity papers, he said,
 he could not qualify for refugee relief and
 instead was earning 50 cents a day as a
 construction laborer in Tan An.  "It's easy
 to get work now; many rich men building
 houses."

 Asked what; he thought of Americans, be
 had to ask the Interpreter what Americans
 were.
 After a pause, he shrugged, "The Govern-
 ment used to help more with rice and money.
 Why doesn't Mr. Diern. come back?  When he
 was there we got bank loans."
 A 25-year-old Vietcong defector, who used
 to lead a 37-man guerrilla platoon, explained
 why peasants like Mua were turning against
 the Vietcont>.
 In his area,, he said, the Vietcong initially
 redistributed  land.   But  now  they have
 raised taxes 300 percent.
 "Tile more air strikes, the more people
 moved away and the heavier taxes became,
 he said.   "The National Liberation Front
 (the Vietcong's political arm) failed to solve
 anything.  ']'here was no security to work in
 your field. An F-105 jet got there too fast,
 there was no time to run for cover.  Those
 and 250-pound bombs were most feared."
 He said it he were directing the war in
 Saigon he would intensify air and artillery
 attacks on the Vietcong villages, and then
 would offer the peasants amnesty and safe
 harbor elsewhere.
 Ile suggested the offers be broadcast via.
 heliborne loudspeakers by people who previ-
 ously had left the Vietcong held villages.
 He said he had joined the Communist
 Party 2 years ago.
 "Everyone wants to join because it is an
 honor,   You are known everywhere."
 the platoon, he said, was assigned the
 military  mission  of  "destroying  strategic
 hamlets, building roadblocks, and encircling
 and inflicting casualties on the enemy" and
 the political task of "visiting farmers to in-
 quire about their poverty and ask about
 their sufferings."
 He said the Vietcong's motto was  "Eat
 together, live together, and work together,"
 meaning the soldiers and peasantry.
 "The people liked us until our presence
 began to attract bombs and artillery to their
 villages," he said.

 Tim PEOPLE'S WAR: THE BATTLE To WIN
 i'EASANT'S LOYALTY
 (NOTE.-This is the third of four articles
 on the Mekong Delta, South Vietnam's rice
 bowl.  Critchlield recently completed an ex-
 tensive tour there.)
 (By Ctichard Critchfleid)
 'VAN   AN,   IiOTTTTI   VIETNAM.-"Vietcong?"
 said the teenage American corporal, shov-
 ing a magazine into his carbine.  "Hell, half
 the people walking by could be Vietcong.
 flow you gonna tell Charlie from the friend-
 lies?"
 here in Long An Province in the densely
 populated Mekong Delta, as most everywhere
 else in Vietnam, it is Impossible to tell "our
 side" from  "their side."  A grin Or a wave
 means nothing it all.
 The corporal is one of about 60 Americans
 who are spending a year in the province, ad-
 vising its military officers and civil servants
 on how to destroy Vietcong units, counter
 political subversion, and win over the loyalty
 of the peasantry..
 it is no easy task, since an unrecognizable
 minority of the people the advisers are try-
 ing to befriend are trying to kill them.
 And unless they befriend and convert more
 people than they kill, the fighting accom-
 plishes nothing.
 This  is  the basic difference between the
 "people's war" in Vietnam and more familiar
 "wars of attrition" elsewhere.
 AWAERNED BY MORTARS
 That night the Americans at Tan An were
 awakened at 1.,30 a.m. by incoming mortar
 bursts.  Fnr some minutes the night was full
 of whirring, shrieking explosions.
 RECORD -- SENATE        February 17, 1.966
 Then  the  Vietcong  firing  stopped  as
 abruptly as it had begun.
 Out along a fence where men Sn pajamas
 and underwear and others in full combat
 fatigues had taken their positions, everyone
 listened.
 When  the  night stayed  quiet,  someone
 muttered, "Well, I'll live to see another day."
 A garrison radio crackled to life and a voice
 reported two  30-man  Vietnamese militia
 posts had been attacked, one less than 2
 miles away.
 Flareships and "razorbeck" arm'?at helicop-
 ters were soon circling the northern horizon;
 the tracer bullets looked like a man on a
 rooftop sprinkling firewater from .,, hose.
 The commanding officer sent word from
 the province command post, tellin;;: everyone
 to go back to bed and gel; some sleep.  They
 would need it in the days and we ?ks ahead.
 SUSPECT BIG ASSAULT
 The night mortar barrages have become a
 routine in Long An Province.  Either Tan
 An or one of the six district capita is gets hit
 at least once a week.
 And many of the American advisers, air-
 men, and technicians suspect a b,g assault
 on one of the district towns sometime this
 winter.  Most are convinced such an assault
 can be turned back with Saigon's armed
 hueys, jets. flareships, and Long An's artil-
 lery.
 It is rough for the five-man American ad-
 visory teams stationed in the si:  district
 towns..
 One major said that eveiytime hi:: garrison
 has been mortared, he has gone out and
 found the outside gate open, unlatched from
 inside the compound.
 "If the Vietcong ever get inside hat gate
 there's no place to go but down.  At that
 point, I take off my flak vest, 'cause if they're
 going to get me, I don't want it to the alive."
 A captain in Tan Tru, Long An':: hottest
 district since it straddles the main Vietcong
 supply route between the South China Sea
 and base camps along the Cambodian border,
 says the morale of the Vietnamese militia
 he advises is "the damndest thing I've ever
 seen.  I don't see how they can continue to
 smile and joke all the time; but they do."
 He said his 2 months at Tan  Tru  has
 felt  "like  a  lifetime;  something happens
 every night."
 He added, "We also have to keep the 12-
 mnile road to Tan An open three times a
 week and it seems like every time v e go to
 clear it we lose one man, either killed or
 wounded."
 One major  described  a recent  daylight
 operation to clear a Vietcong roadblock off
 Highway 4. He said his driver, while wait-
 ing in the jeep, was shot between the eyes
 by a sniper.
 I-IARASSMENQT RISING
 After nearly a year of ccmparativ:? peace
 and quiet in Long An, the Vietcong moved
 a second mainforce battalion into the pro-
 vince in November and the pace of am hushes,
 attacks, and mortar harassment  has;  risen
 steadily ever since.
 This climaxed at 1:30 a.m. on December
 26 when the Vietcong chose to break the
 United States-South Vietnamese Christmas
 truce by firing 40 mortar shells ini o Tan
 An, while simultaneousy laying down mortar
 barrages on all six district towns.
 They inflicted heavy casualties and even-
 tually overran two company-sized outposts
 and beheaded one Vietnamese soldier's wife.
 Twenty-five militiamen were missing after
 the attack; an American captain speculated
 they "either bugged out, were carried off or
 directly hit by a mortar shell and blown to
 bits."
 Many of the ill-equipped militia, or pop-
 ular forces, as they are officially called, fight
 with  only  carbines  and  shotguns  while
 wearing floppy hats, swimming trunks, pa-
 jamas or a scrounged uniform.
 Recently a four-man outpost held off a
 company-sized Vietcong attack for 6 hours;
 when morning came two militiamen were
 dead and two were wounded, but the post
 had not fallen and they had managed to
 capture six Vietcong weapons.
 One hamlet of 300 people, deep withi r
 Vietcong territory, recently pacified itself by
 erecting fortifications and passing the hat
 to buy a 60-mm, mortar to scare off the
 Vietcong.  So far the Communist guerrillas
 have let the village alone.
 Many of the American advisers believe the
 pattern  of  Vietcong  attacks  on  isolated
 outposts and newly fortified hamlets along
 Saigon's defensive perimeter and Long An's
 northern boundary suggests that the Coin-
 munists may be trying to sever Highway No.
 4,  and cut off Saigon from    the  rice-rich
 Mekong Delta.
 COUNTER STRATEGY
 To counter this strategy, Long An's Gov-
 ernment forces, composed of two South Viet-
 namese regular army regiments and several
 thousand more locally recruited militiamen
 and police, have tried to fix the two Vietcong
 battalions with ground action. and destroy
 them with heavy artillery and airstrikes.
 Long An is so short of troops, however,
 that most operations must be stopped at
 sunset so the militia and police can return
 to guard their homes and families.
 Despite  this  troop  shortage,  both  the
 American    advisers  and  Vietnam.eee   com-
 manders oppose bringing American combat
 units into the delta where the war is still
 almost entirely a Vietnamese fight, except
 for U.S. air support.
 The Americans seem to feel that moving
 more U.S. troops into the delta would lead
 to  a  put-down-tools  attitude  among  the
 Vietnamese forces.   Vietnamese officers em-
 phasize that the local economy would be
 disrupted and that the Vietcong could ex-
 ploit a foreign invasion propaganda earn-
 paign among the local peasantry.
 American combat soldiers in Vietnam are
 always amazed  to  hear the U.S. advisory
 teams live in scattered groups of four and
 five, wholly defended by Vietnamese troops.
 The advisers   themselves  often wouldn't
 have it any other way.
 Says Capt. Maurice H. Krause, 31, of Wah-
 peton, N. Dak., Long An's pacification ad-
 viser:
 "This is an extremely nice country.  What
 happens if you get assigned to a big unit is
 that you're close to a conventional war en-
 vironment, moving with the troops.                                                                                                                                                Down
 here in Long An we see people getting schools
 and medicine, see the spontaneous expres-
 sions of loyalty to this side and dissatisfac-
 tion with the Vietcong."
 Two enlisted. men in Long An. have ex-
 tended their tours for a second year and one
 will  marry  a  local  Vietnamese  girl  next
 month.
 The biggest problem for the advisory tram,
 as the fighting intensifies in Long An, is how
 to avoid inflicting casualties on the civilian
 population.
 "HAVE TO GET CALLOUS"
 Half of the patients at Tan An's new 155-
 bed hospital are civilians wounded in  the
 fighting.
 "Usually you can count on receiving at
 least a couple a day," says an Americana doc-
 tor on the hospital staff.  "They mostly step
 on grenades or mines or get shot by stray
 bullets.  But we do get some bombing and
 napalm victims.  You have to get callous or
 you'd drive yourself crazy worrying about it."
 A U.S. Air Force forward air observer, one
 of a team who flys reconnaissance and com-
 bat support missions over Long An every day
 and knows it terrain by heart, says, "If I go

 over a village and see women and kids, I
 flatly refuse to call in an airstrike."
 Another American, after many months in
 Long An, says, "No one who goes to indemni-
 fication meetings where they pay war victims
 can be morally callous.  No one can say a 2-
 year-old child or a 90-year-old grandmother
 is a Vietcong.  But I think we should and
 must continue the bombing.
 "It's effective. It kills Vietcong and inter-
 dicts their nypvements.  I think care is taken.
 There are instances where American forward
 air controllers have refused to call in strikes
 or when the province chief has ordered heli-
 copters back home that were ordered out.
 "What you've always  got to  remember,
 though, is that the people are the key to win-
 ning the war.  There's no reason to go out in
 the woods and kill lots of people unless it
 helps in pacifications."

 THE PEOPLE'S WAR: AND Now ANOTHER Tay
 AT PACIFYING LONG AN
 (NOTE.-This is the last of four articles on
 the Mekong Delta, South Vietnam's rice bowl.
 Critchfield recently completed an extensive
 tour there.)
 (By Richard Critchfield)
 TAN AN,  SOUTH VIETNAM.-After months
 of reappraisal and careful preparation, South
 Vietnam has launched its fourth pacification
 plan since 1961 to win back the loyalty of
 the Vietnamese peasantry.
 It differs hardly at all from the old plans
 on the two key issubs involved-land reform
 and  military against civilian rule  in the
 countryside.
 As a result, many observers fear it will
 be no more successful than former President
 Ngo Dinh Diem's Operation Sunrise, Gen.
 Nguyen Khanh's Chien Thang plan or Gen.
 Maxwell D. Taylor's Hop Tac plan.
 Nor is anybody predicting spectacular suc-
 cess.
 After a brief tour. of Vietnam recently,
 David Bell, Director of the Agency for In-
 ternational  Development,  said,  "We  don't
 except large areas to be cleared, but they
 will be significant."
 It has never been so much a question of
 devising a successful  pacification program
 as applying it and redressing the genuine
 political grievances of the peasantry.
 In essence, all the programs have been de-
 rived from the tache d'huile or "oil slick" or
 "ink  blot" theory,  first  developed by the
 French Foreign Legion in Morocco in the
 1920's.  It was a method of securing some
 solidly held, key centers from which "pacifi-
 cation" forces could spread out in an ever-
 widening perimeter  against rebellious na-
 tives.
 PHILIPPINE SUCCESS
 After being humanized and refined with
 civic action, most notably land reform, the
 method worked against Communist insur-
 gents in the Philippines.  And by added em-
 phasis on promises of independence, police
 methods, strict population control, and for-
 tified villages, the British made it work in
 Malaya.
 Land reform or the promise of independ-
 ence,  however,  provided  the  psychological
 impetus in both of these successful efforts.
 As U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge
 puts it, the people "must adhere to the gov-
 ernment because they like it before it can
 win."
 It was not until March 1962 that Diem,
 with the help of Malayan-experienced Brit-
 ish advisers, launched the first attempt at
 Vietnamese pacification, Operation Sunrise.
 Diem misused the program by making it
 an instrument of his personal rule.  But even
 so, it was far more successful than any of the
 efforts that followed it.
 For instance, here in Long An Province,
 Diem succeeded-in just a little over 1
 year-in regrouping 1,000 hamlets into 220
 strategic hamlets and isolating the Vietcong
 into the remaining 35.
 Diem had three things his successors lack-
 ed-a functioning countrywide rural admin-
 istrative  system,  an  efficient, tightly con-
 trolled political apparatus,  and  a  civilian
 chief in each Province whose authority was
 absoluete and who superimposed a political
 judgment  over military  actions in  his
 Province.
 DIEM AIDS  PURGED
 The wholesale purge of public servants
 and other Diem appointees, whatever their
 personal record or reputation, and the de-
 struction of his Can Lao Party left the Viet-
 namese Army as the only countrywide orga-
 nization.
 Colonels and captains took over the job of
 running South Vietnam's 43 Provinces and
 240 districts.
 It soon become apparent, however, that
 these men were not subject to Saigon's direct
 administrative control, rather they were re-
 sponsible to the commander of the nearest
 Vietnamese Army division and through him
 to the local corps commander.
 Seen in retrospect, the three successive
 military coups  of Minh,  Khanh  and the
 Young Turks were in large part supported
 by the officer corps to enable them to con-
 solidate the administration in the country-
 side.
 Thus, beginning with Diem's fall, govern-
 ment was made incidental to waging the war.
 On the Provincial  level, meanwhile, the
 army, jealous of its powers, exempted Viet-
 namese soldiers from the civilian penal code,
 even in crimes involving civilians.
 Since the army lacked the judicial appara-
 tus and military police to control its troops,
 the net effect was to turn loose in the coun-
 tryside 550,000 young soldiers who had little
 reason to fear being arrested or prosecuted
 for crimes such as rape or petty theft.
 The  Vietcong  leaders,  meanwhile,  were
 concentrating on getting their men to "eat,
 live and work" with the peasants. The Viet-
 cong helped the peasants till their riceflelds
 and sweep their houses, while through terror-
 ism, they were eroding law and order in gov-
 ernment-controlled areas.
 Two months after Diem's overthrow, an
 American-Vietnamese factfinding team, was
 sent to Long An Province.
 The team uncovered an alarming Com-
 munist advance.  By then the Vietcong had
 overrun and burnt down all but 6 of Diem's
 220 strategic hamlets.
 After interviewing 1,500 peasant families,
 the team concluded  the war against the
 Vietcong "cannot ever be won" unless Saigon
 carried out drastic reforms at the village
 level.
 Its conclusions were:
 Land  must  be  distributed.   The  local
 militia must be paid regularly. The use of
 artillery and bombs against villages must be
 limited.
 Forced labor had to be stopped. Army ex-
 tortion and food thefts must be prevented.
 Corruption and bribery must be elimi-
 nated  among local  officials.   District and
 provincial forces must send reinforcements
 when they were sought by village outposts
 under attack.
 These conclusions were pretty basic, yet
 today most of the troubles remain largely
 unremedied.
 Local militia are a little better paid and
 housed, but still not adequately.   Forced
 labor has been eliminated in most of the
 country.  The introduction of more armed
 helicopters, flareships, high-speed jets and
 more artillery  has  reduced  the  need for
 ground reinforcements.
 But there has been no serious land reform.
 Bombing and shelling of villages has multi-
 plied tenfold or twelvefold.  Army extortion
 and food thefts as common as ever and cor-
 ruption is still endemic.
 LODGE SHOCKED
 When the report on Long An was origi-
 nally published in early 1964, it had the im-
 pact                                                                                                                             of  a  bombshell  in  Saigon.   Lodge,
 shocked at the seriousness of the situation,
 urged General Khanh to launch a crash pilot
 pacification program in the province. If the
 Communists could be turned back in Long
 An, Lodge argued, it would be shown they
 could be turned back everywhere.
 Khanh agreed.  Economic aid was stepped
 up, U.S. heliborne flights deployed for stop
 attacks, the military advisory team was ex-
 panded and more men were assigned to dis-
 trict                                                                                                                                  and  mobile  units  operating  in  the
 Province.
 A Vietnamese airborne brigade was flown
 in to start operations to clear lost territory.
 Maj. Gen. Richard Stilwell, now U.S. Com-
 mander in Thailand, told newsmen Long An
 would be "pacified" and cleared of Commu-
 nists within 6 months.
 But the following July, 6 months later, the
 government held only 25 hamlets, mostly
 clustered around Tan An and the six district
 towns.  Khanh's "Chien Thang" plan had
 been a fiasco.
 Partly, this was because Khanh's heart was
 never in pacification.  He weakened pacifica-
 tion efforts from the start by leaving it up to
 his province chiefs to proceed as best they
 saw fit in their own bailiwicks.
 After Maxwell Taylor arrived in Saigon
 that summer as Ambassador and surveyed
 the wreckage of years of costly trial and error,
 he developed a pacification philosophy call-
 ing for giving the peasants military security
 while demonstrating to them the revolu-
 tionary idea in Vietnam, that Government
 exists for the people.
 By then, one of the main Vietcong slogans
 had already become: "The government exists
 for the people."
 URGES  CONCENTRATION
 Taylor pushed for concentrating the gov-
 ernment's resources on a small area,  the
 seven provinces encircling Saigon, hoping for
 visible results.  This was the "Hop Tac" plan
 (which roughly means "togetherness.")
 Taylor also urged a return to civilian gov-
 ernment.  This was not simply to have Viet-
 nam's leader a man in mufti instead of uni-
 form, but because Taylor saw it was the way
 to restore a workable administration and law
 and order in the countryside.
 Lodge's strong advocacy for a return to
 civilian rule, no matter who the man on top
 is, is based on the same reasoning.
 Yet now, almost 18 months since Hop Tac
 got underway, Long An still has only 76 of
 its 252 hamlets anywhere near pacified.
 The cost of men and material has been
 heavy; four of the young American officers
 who pointed out shortcomings in the paci-
 fication effort to me an previous visits since
 have been killed in action.
 Since June 1964, there have been four dif-
 ferent American province advisers and eight
 different American pacification advisers in
 Long An, although the Vietnamese provincial
 officials have stayed the same.

 NEWSWOMAN  MAY  CRAIG  SLATED  To  RETIRE
 DECEMBER 31
 WASHINGTON.--May Craig, one of America's
 most famous newspaperwomen and for more
 than 30 years the capital correspondent for
 the Guy Garnett Newspapers of Maine, will
 retire at the end of the year.
 Mrs.  Craig,  who  combined  penetrating
 questions with pert hats, for more than 3
 decades has been the most widely read col-
 umnist in Maine.  She covered Washington
 and the world for Guy Gannett newspapers in
 Portland, Augusta, and Waterville.
 Por thousands of Maine families her daily
 column "Inside in Washington" was must
 morning breakfast table reading.  Although
 little read outside Maine, Mrs. Craig became
 nationally famous as a, panelist on the radio
 and television program "Meet the Press."
 Millions o1 Americans came to know her
 as the Washington reporter who could be
 counted upon to enliven Presidential press
 conferences with the pointed question, the
 incisive query.
 Yet,  though  her  questions  occasionally
 rankled the famous, she was a close friend
 of every President from Franklin D. Roose-
 velt to Lyndon Baines Johnson.
 And, though she asked literally thousands
 of questions, "I never asked a question I
 later regretted," she noted as her retirement
 neared.
 Her column reflected the same penetrating
 quality that punctuated her questions.  One
 column  in  1964,  "Decline  of  the United
 States--And Fall" attracted nationwide at-

 correspondent during the Korean war, and.
 to Africa as the continent merged during
 the early 1960's.
 Maine readers followed her byline around
 the world as she reported the great events of
 more than 3 decades.
 Yet May Craig also kept a close finger on
 the pulse of the Maine delegation in Wash-
 ington as she furnished readers with the
 news that most closely affected then.
 Mrs. Craig said that, when she retires at
 the end of the year, "I'm going to take a
 little time off to do nothing," but few readers
 will believe that she'll remain inactive long.
 She's been under contract for some time to
 write a book, so there's the strong likelihood
 that the typewriter, which for a third of a
 century had recorded the events thot shaped
 the world, will not long be stilled.
 Millions of Americans who have seen Mrs.
 Craig On "Meet the Press" and at Pr' sidential
 press conferences, have come to think of her
 as a Maine native.  It comes as a shock to
 learn that she's a native of Coosaw, N.C.,
 who moved to Washington as a young girl.
 No matter.  She remains Maine in Wash-
 ington to many.  She knows Maine intimate-
 ly and news of a postmaster's appointment
 in Waterville received the same close  at-
 tention as a Washington national ,story.
 Now in her seventies (although she main-
 tains that she'll be 50 until she dies), Mrs.
 Craig :never slowed down.  Her columns from
 the beginning reflected her intense interest
 in  almost everything and  anything, from
 renovations of the White House to the war
 in Vietnam.
 For years she was up and on the go at
 6 a.m., and Maine Senators and Congress-
 men quickly learned to become accustomed
 to a telephone call from May Craig long be-
 fore they had risen from bed.
 She became in time almost as famous as
 some of the officials she covered; more fa-
 mous than most.
 Married to a newspaperman, the late Don-
 ald Alexander Craig, the Washington bureau
 chief for the New York Herald, as well as
 for the Guy Gannett newspapers, Mrs. Craig
 became the Washington correspondent for
 these newspapers In the early 1930's after the
 death of her husband.  She has two children,
 a son and a daughter, and several grand-
 children.
 She maintains a home in Washington close
 to the Capitol.
 During her career Mrs. Craig covered the
 V-bomb raids in London during World War
 II, the Normandy campaign, the liberation
 of Paris, and the Korean war.  Her travels
 for these newspapers have taken her to al-
 most every point on the globe.
 She was made a doctor of human letters
 by the University of Maine in 1946.  She is
 a member of the Women's National Press
 Club, the Overseas Press of America, and
 Theta Sigma Phi.
 PRAISE FRoM L.B.J.
 President Johnson, learning in Texas of
 May Craig's retirement, sent her the follow-
 ing telegram Friday:
 "It's a long time from May to September,
 but May will always be May to me."

 TRIBUTE FROM PUBLISHER
 Mrs. Jean Gannett Arnzen, president and
 publisher of the Guy Gannett Publishing
 Co., issued this statement of tribute to May
 Craig:
 "May Craig has for many years been as in-
 separable from our papers as their name-
 plates.   She has made  them  known, not
 only in Maine but in the Nation.  Competing
 in an environment of top talent and strong
 personalities, she has had the vigor and the
 ability to be outstanding.
 "Obviously her retirement, so richly de-
 served cannot be treated casually   It will
 leave a lonesome place in our columns.  Her
 departure is too close to me, personally, to
 be dismissed in the course of business.
 "She was employed by our papers by my
 father, the late Guy P. Gannett, when he
 was-establishing them and laying the found-
 ations for their success.  He always believed
 that one of his most important contributions
 was employing May Craig to represent his
 papers in Washington.
 "I shall always remember my :father's great
 pride in his Washington correspondent and
 the delight he had in her success."

 "NATION  Is  13ETTER  FOR  THIS  OUTSTANDING
 WOMAN"-FROM           PRESIDENT    JOHNSON'S
 TRIBUTE TO MAY CRAIG
 (By Donald E. Hanson)
 To imagine a presidential press conference
 without May Craig is like imagining the Cap-
 ital without the Washington Monument.
 For May Craig,  to  thousands of Maine
 newspaper readers, is Washington. For more
 than three decades she's been an indelible
 fixture on the Washington scene.
 Presidents  came  and   went.   Elections
 changed the faces in the city and altered
 the complexion of the Nation.   May Craig
 remained.
 Now that too changes, for May Craig, who
 with pert hat and pointed question became
 one of America's most famous newspaper-
 women, retires at the end of the year.
 Presidents from Franklin Delano Roose-
 velt to Lyndon Baines Johnson came to know
 and respect--and occasionally chafe at one
 of her barbed questions-the little and un-
 questionable First Lady of the 'Washington
 press corps.
 Although for thousands of Maine readers
 her column "inside in Washington" has been
 daily must reading for years at the breakfast
 table, Elizabeth May Craig was comparatively
 unread outside the State, except on occa-
 sions when her comments were reprinted in
 other newspapers and magazines.
 Her face, however, became almost as fa-
 mous as those of the personages she covered.
 Visitors to Washington have, after view-
 ing the landmarks of the city, often inquired
 of their host: "All this is fine, but where's
 May Craig?"  And a Sunday Telegram re-
 porter, traveling in California, had only to
 mention that he worked for the Portland
 papers to receive the reply, "Oh, you mean
 May Craig's papers."
 To millions of Americans she became fa-
 mous as a fixture on the radio and television
 program "Meet the Press."  She once made
 President Jim Carey, of the Electrical Work-
 ers Union, gulp visibly by asking: "Don't you
 think it un-American for a man to have to
 belong to a union to earn a living?"
 STO ONE IMMUNE
 No President was immune from the sharp
 May Craig  question.   President Roosevelt,
 after fielding a sharp one on. three hops,
 asked May if she stayed awake all night
 thinking it up.  "As a matter of fact," shot
 back May, "I did."
 Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy,
 and Johnson all came to expect the unex-
 pected from May.  President Kennedy was
 wise enough to realize that when a press
 conference began to take a dull turn that
 it was probably time to recognize Mrs. Craig.
 Yet, if Presidents occasionally rankled at
 a May Craig question, none was ever able to
 harbor a grudge.
 She was often a visitor at the Hyde Park
 home of President and Mrs. Roosevelt. Presi-
 dent  Johnson, perhaps  better  than most,
 came to realize  the many  facets  of  May
 Craig.  In 1956, when the then Senator John-
 son suffered a severe heart attack, each day
 to his hospital room was delivered a private
 letter from May, cheering him and Informing
 him of the activities in the Senate.
 If the pointed questions, the unusual hats
 or the familiar features made May Craig a
 celebrity, they may also to some extent have
 obscured her real ability as a member of the
 Washington press corps.

 ful of the fact that the percentage of the
 Negro population in' these surrounding po-
 litical subdivisions is so small as to fore-
 stall prompt passage of such, legislation.
 The legislative remedy must be applied in
 the areas where the social sickness is most
 apparent.  This means, of course, that Bal-
 timore                 City must take the leadership in
 providing metropolitan-wide open occupancy
 legislation. If  each  political  subdivision
 were to await the action of the other, the
 mounting   tensions    brought    about  by
 crowded conditions may possibly explode be-
 fore a common consensus is arrived at.                 Ac-
 cordingly, I call upon this body to enact into
 law the Fair Housing Ordinance before you.
 I am mindful of the pressures under which
 you find yourselves.  I know that there
 exists within your body a desire for states-
 manlike leadership.
 I pledge you my support and the support
 of the Archdiocese of Baltimore in assisting
 and encouraging the passage of similar leg-
 islation in  the political subdivisions sur-
 rounding our beloved city.  I am aware of
 the arguments that are made about the pos-
 sibilities of a population which may desert
 our city, and I am equally aware of the
 inequity that may be visited upon some of
 those developers who have made their com-
 mitment to build within Baltimore City and
 who may find themselves placed at a great
 economic  disadvantage  in  the event that
 some of the dire predictions about urban
 flight to the suburbs should come to pass.
 The heart of the race problem is a moral
 issue.  Even if the percentage of the Negro
 population in Baltimore City were extremely
 small, rather than in excess of the one-
 third figure, the justice of the proposal be-
 fore you would be unaffected.   The argu-
 ment for justice, however, coupled with the
 practical consideration of tensions, uneasi-
 ness, and potential massive resort to law-
 breaking, give added impetus to the critical
 nature of the proposal before you.
 I pledge you that this fight for social jus-
 tice will not be placed upon your shoulders
 alone, but that the teaching and pastoral ca-
 pacities of the Catholic Church will support
 you in what I ask you to do.
 I call upon you, then, to make this a mat-
 ter of civic and social responsibility so as to
 render to the minorities their rights, and to
 assist Baltimore in the growth which we
 mutually desire to see.
 ALASKA THANKS MR. SHRIVER
 Mr.   BARTLETT.  Mr.   President,
 about 5 years ago, the American foreign
 relations took on a new image. Begin-
 ning in the West African Republic of
 Ghana, then spreading to East Africa
 in Tanzania,  and outward to Latin
 America, Asia and the Far East, the
 finest concept of the New Frontier has
 taken American educational and tech-
 nological know-how to 46 countries of
 the world.
 I am speaking, of course, about the
 Peace Corps, now more than 10,000
 strong-the  grassroots  diplomats  per-
 haps closest to American hearts.
 I say they are the diplomats closest
 to American hearts because there's an
 inherent remoteness about the fellow
 who wears a frock-tailed coat and striped
 pants.  But the Peace Corps volunteer
 in Ecuador, in his jeans and sweatshirt,
 is a fellow with whom we all can identify.
 Last year, he may have gassed your car
 at the corner service station.
 Now, all of this may sound like apple
 pie, and the Peace Corps may have some
 of that too, but the U.S. Senate has to
 be concerned with hard-nosed results.
 Well, the Peace Corps, in my estimation,
 .has delivered those results.  And my
 State of Alaska also is getting a return
 from the Peace Corps budget.
 Alaska is getting a direct dividend from
 the Peace Corps because three returned
 volunteers, two young men who served in
 Ecuador and one who was a beekeeper
 in Guatemala, are key people in the
 Alaska poverty program. Mr. President,
 I rise today to salute these young people,
 Mike Valentine of Ogden, Utah, and Ger-
 ald Miller of Ceresco, Nebr., who did rural
 community action work in Ecuador; and
 Don Johnson, also of Ceresco, who served
 the Peace Corps in Guatemala.
 Alaska Gov. William A. Egan recently
 paid tribute to the trio when he said:
 These Peace Corps returnees have made the
 most constructive impact upon poverty in
 Alaska in its 100 years under the American
 flag.
 Gerald, Mike, and Don are working
 out of Fairbanks, Anchorage, and Bethel.
 Ninety percent of their time is spent liv-
 ing with Eskimos, Aleuts, and Indians in
 remote villages.  These men are using
 Peace Corps skills and the Peace Corps
 concept of self-help to give Alaska's na-
 tive People a new sense of personal dig-
 nity and value as human beings.
 For instance, Gerald Miller, who was a
 horse trader in Nebraska before he en-
 tered the Peace Corps, is working with
 VISTA volunteers to establish a pre-
 school program in the Eskimo village of
 Hooper Bay, whose population of 560 in-
 cludes only 5 persons with salaried jobs.
 Gerald also has organized adult educa-
 tion classes at Hooper Bay, community
 action programs at Barrow, Fort Yukon,
 and Arctic Village.
 Don Johnson, working with the Eski-
 mos of Emmonak, has developed a saw-
 mill industry there which will provide
 paying jobs for people who historically
 have eked out a subsistence living by
 hunting and fishing and trapping.
 Mike Valentine is working on a pro-
 gram to electrify the Kodiak Island vil-
 lage of Old Harbor.  Electrification of
 the village may help attract a canning
 plant.
 Alaska's 48,200 native people want to
 pull their share of the load in develop-
 ing our abundant resources.  But in or-
 der to fulfill this responsibility, the Eski-
 mos, the Aleuts and the Indians need
 technical know-how, not how-to lectures
 from a remote podium.  They need dem-
 onstrations and examples from people
 such as our returned Peace Corps vol-
 unteers who live in the villages with the
 people.
 That is what Alaska is reaping from
 the Peace Corps.  Now, the real fruits
 of Sargent Shriver's inspired overseas
 organization are being harvested in my
 State, although the seeds were planted
 in Guatemala and Ecuador.
 I want to take this opportunity to
 thank Sargent Shriver for developing
 the U.S. Peace Corps into one of Amer-
 ica's most effective agencies for inter-
 national aid, and wish him well in his
 new full-time assignment as head of the
 Office of Economic Opportunity.
 3235
 To Jack Vaughn, the Peace Corps di-
 rector-designate, I say, I hope that more
 of your returned volunteers will journey
 to Alaska, where there is great opportu-
 nity for those who want to serve their
 fellow man.
 DEATH OF ALEXANDER F. "CASEY"
 JONES
 Mr. KENNEDY of New York.  Mr.
 President, the death of Alexander F.
 "Casey" Jones in Florida on February
 15 was a great loss not only to American
 newspapers but also to his many friends
 and admirers.  "Casey" Jones repre-
 sented the quest for excellence in Amer-
 ican journalism.  Both the newspapers
 he managed-the Washington Post and
 the Syracuse Herald Journal-and their
 readers benefited from his forthright and
 fearless direction. He was properly in-
 sistent on the people's right to know
 about the operation of their government
 whether Federal, State, or local.  His
 sure and distinctive touch will be missed.
 His imprint, however, will long survive.

 THE BASE FOR VIETNAM'S GREAT
 SOCIETY
 Mr. HARTKE.  Mr. President,  the
 declaration of Honolulu has placed the
 economic resources of this Nation behind
 what may well be called a great society
 program for South Vietnam.
 Public attention has been almost ex-
 clusively focused in the past year or more
 on the military situation we face in
 South Vietnam, and continues to pay
 little attention to developments within
 the economy of that country and its in-
 ternal government structure and opera-
 tions.  The truth is that even though
 there have been no recent coups it is
 reported the local nonmilitary situation
 has continually deteriorated.
 Two articles appeared in this morn-
 ing's Washington Post, written by two of
 that paper's skilled and experienced for-
 eign service reporters, on the spot in
 Saigon, under a joint headline: "Vietna-
 mese Skeptical of Pledges; Economic Sit-
 uation Is Worsening."  They deserve
 universal and careful reading.  Some
 may say these analyses are frightening,
 and they are. But they are also realis-
 tic, and we must be realists in the
 approach we make to our Vietnam in-
 volvement.
 Our own Great Society is starting to
 build upon a stable, steady base of grow-
 ing prosperity over the past 5 years,
 prosperity which is unprecedented.  We
 are not trying to overlay it on a society
 shot through and through with ineffi-
 ciency, corruption, and apathy toward
 the central government.  We are doing
 it by our own efforts, from the inside, not
 by a largess stultifying to initiative and
 involvement imposed from the outside.
 But here are some of the conditions
 reported by the Post reporters.
 First, they say that South Vietnam has
 not as yet established any effective poli-

 ties of its own to fight the war on the
 homefront. Writes Ward Just:
 't'here is no incomes policy, no price policy,
 only the bare beginnings of import policy,
 very little control over hoarding.
 Yet we, who are talking of taking on
 what amounts to the major responsibility
 for South Vietnam's domestic economy
 as well as for its war, are beginning to
 think in terms of the rearranging of our
 own domestic policies, in order that we
 may shoulder this tremendous and dubi-
 ous burden.  We are told that we are
 threatened with inflation, and we are
 rightly concerned by the possibility that
 the economy of the United States may
 creep upward in that direction by as
 much as 2 or 3 percent. But there, where
 the Government is not controlling infla-
 tion, and where we are feeding it daily
 with our massive injections of funds,
 prices rose 10 percent last month alone,
 and nearly 50 percent in the last year.
 The prediction is that the rise will be an-
 other 35 or 40 percent in the next year.
 This means that by 1967 it will cost us $2
 for each dollar it was costing us a year
 ago
 Think of it-10 percent in 1 month.
 Do we have any assurance at all, any
 commitment. from the Government of
 General Ky that measures will be taken
 to halt such terrible economic erosion?
 And even if we get such assurances, will
 there be any possibility that they can be
 carried out?
 Second, it is very dubious whether
 controls will be accepted in South Viet-
 nam.  It is quite possible that attempts
 to achieve them will merely result in
 bringing down the Government. Far too
 many people  in  South  Vietnam  are
 caught up in making a good thing of
 this war.  Here is Mr. Just's account:
 But there is no enthusiasm for the war
 in this dazed and weary country, and the
 population is in no mood to accept stiff con-
 trols.   While  ARVN  privates  die  In  the
 swamps of Haunghia Province, well-off Viet-
 namese sun themselves at the swimming pool
 at the Cercle Sportif.
 While Americans struggle through the rice
 fields of Binhdinh, landlords refuse to sell
 land to the ITS. Government on which to
 build tent cities to relieve the acute housing
 shortage in Saigon.
 "There is no patriotism here," said one offi-
 cial.                  "I am not being negative.  I am being
 realistic."
 Third, they report that the black mar-
 ket is running away, and a major in-
 gredient in that occurrence is the vast
 atmount of cash, of U.S. dollars, with
 which we are now flooding the country.
 Black markets mean corruption, and I
 raise the question, what assurance have
 we that we will not spread and com-
 pound the corruption now existing as we
 pour into South Vietnam not only the
 27 percent of the fiscal 1967 AID budget
 earmarked  for  Vietnam,  but  further
 sums--much as they may be needed-
 for education, health, schools, farm de-
 velopment?  Says Mr. Just:
 It Is understood that the United States
 itself will undertake to increase imports of
 consumer goods like radios, bikes, and tele-
 vision sets.  But complicating that problem
 is an antique import licensing law.
 The report by Mr. Just's colleague,
 Stanley Karnow, elaborates and points
 up more clearly what this means:
 Economic disruption is naturally accom-
 panied by corruption, which is regarded here
 as almost as great an enemy to the country
 as the Communists.  Nearly everything, from
 construction  contracts to the  delivery  of
 motor scooters, which are rationed by the
 Government, is said to require a payoff.
 Import licenses are being bought and sold,
 and it is feared that when the U.:. com-
 mercial import program is accelerated-in
 order to absorb the surplus currency in cir-
 culation-the traffic in licenses will b: om.
 We are not without guilt in this situa-
 tion.                                                   It is obvious that we have not re-
 quired  rigorous  preconditions  cif  eco-
 nomic controls and reforms from the
 Saigon government before committing
 our own funds, without which that gov-
 ernment could not exist.
 Further, the impact of the "massive
 infusion of U.S. funds, estimated to total
 $600 million in 1966" has aggravated the
 black market in money and contributed
 to the runaway inflation.  We have evi-
 dently not put restrictions on ourselves,
 have not used the kind of self-restraint
 which  the  situation  demands.   Mr.
 Karnow, for example, cites the case of
 the landlady wife of a prominent Viet-
 namese general who is turning out a
 Vietnamese civil servant in order to rent
 her property to an American who is will-
 ing to pay $600 per month.  A barmaid,
 it is reported, can earn more in a day
 than a, longshore worker in a month,
 more in a year than a Cabinet official
 on American money tossed her way. Our
 employment of 100,000 Vietnamese at
 high rates has further thrown the local
 economy into dire straits.
 A construction program at $400 million
 a year is making an impact of $100 mil-
 lion on. the Vietnamese economy.  With
 a total population of 15 million at a gen-
 erous outside figure, this is equivalent
 to an impact about equal to that of our
 own poverty program-$1.3 billion. :Even
 10-year-old boys are getting into the act
 as construction workers.
 Finally, there is the very serious matter
 which Mr. Karnow raises of skepticism in
 Vietnam over our Great Society program
 for them:
 By and large, the promise of new social
 and economic programs has not aroused dis-
 cernible enthusiasm, largely because the his-
 tory of recent years is crowded witlL-. unful-
 filled plans.
 "We"ve heard it all before," said a
 prominent trade union leader yesterday.
 "We are weary of words."
 This skepticism seems to permeate the
 local view of the Honolulu meeting of
 President  Johnson  and  Premier  Ky,
 which is seen "as primarily an American
 exercise in bulwarking the local govern-
 ment.  And it is believed that another
 Honolulu meeting this summer, as an-
 nounced by the President, will repeat
 that exercise.
 "It's like doping horses," commented
 an irreverent young Vietnamese Army
 officer the other day.  "They run for
 awhile, and then you've got to give them
 another shot."
 In what I have said, I am not decrying
 our aims and. our good intentions.  But
 if it is essential that we move into a
 Great Society program in Vietnam, it is
 essential also that we secure the active
 cooperation and participation of the
 Saigon Government. It is futile and self-
 destructive if we go through the pangs
 of wrenching our own economy into line
 for these great efforts, at the expense of
 serious wounds to our own Great Society
 program, only to have it fail.  Failure
 is inevitable, however, if we do not take
 into account the total situation and look
 realistically at the shaky structure and
 the limited possibilities of the South
 Vietnam Government to command the
 wholehearted  cooperative  support  of
 those now fattening from the situation.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the two articles to which I have
 referred may appear in the    CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 SAIGON BOOM CAUSES PROBLEMS: VIETNAMESE
 SKEPTICAL OF PLEDGES; ECONOMIC SITUATION
 IS WORSENING
 (By Stanley Karnow)
 SAIGON, February 16.-President Johnson's
 meeting with  South Vietnam's  leaders in
 Honolulu  last week, followed by visits to
 Saigon by Vice President HuMPIIREY, Secre-
 tary of Agriculture Orville Freemnan, and as-
 sorted  other American  dignitaries  drama-
 tized the U.S. commitment to South Viet-
 nam.
 Now that the  fanfare  has  faded away,
 however, Vietnamese are feeling somewhat
 bewildered and more than a little dubious
 about the administration's dazzling perform-
 ance.  Their opinions vary, of course, accord-
 ing to their social backgrounds.
 Predictably, the educated, articulate civil
 servants, lawyers, schoolteachers, and oth-
 er "intellectuals" here in the capital seem
 to take a skeptical view toward Washing-
 ton's hopes of helping to build a Great So-
 ciety in Vietnam.
 Some  of  them  were comforted  to hear
 HUMPHREY speak of satisfying popular as-
 pirations and rising expectations-a. refresh-
 ing antidote to much of the military jargon
 heard here.   Many others were pleased to
 hear, through the local grapevine, that Free-
 man had intervened to save one of the coun-
 try's leading agronomists from being drafted
 into the army.
 By and large, however, the promise of new
 social  and  economic  programs  has  not
 aroused discernible enthusiasm, largely be-
 cause the history of recent years is crowded
 with unfulfilled plans.
 "We've heard it all before," said a prom-
 inent trade union leader yesterday.                                                                                                                                 "We are
 weary of words."
 Doubts about the future are reinforced,
 moreover, by a, fairly pervasive lack of faith
 in the ability of the South Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment headed by Premier Nguyen Cao Ky.
 In his speeches and statements, Ky pro-
 jects an image of himself as an honest, sim-
 ple soldier dedicated to promoting "social
 revolution."  That image has reportedly cap-
 tivated the White House, where Ky's state-
 ments are said to be on the required read-
 ing list.
 But to Vietnamese here in Saigon--and to
 many American officials, too-Ky is far from
 the hero he is made out to be by his publi-
 cists.
 The Ky government is stable largely be-
 cause it is immobile, explain Vietnamese.
 In fact, they add, it is not really Ky's govern-
 ment but a junta of generals who, for the

 sake of their own survival, have tacitly agreed.
 not to disagree-at least for the present.
 In the view of Vietnamese here, moreover,
 the Saigon government hangs together be-
 cause it is supported by the United. States,
 which would not tolerate another succession
 of coup d'etats and uprisings such as fol-
 lowed the downfall of the Ngo Dinh Diem
 regime in November 1963.
 ANOTHER MEETING
 Thus President Johnson's personal iden-
 tification with the Saigon leaders in Hono-
 lulu last week has been seen here as pri-
 marily an American exercise in bulwarking
 the local government.  And it is believed
 that  another Honolulu meeting this sum-
 mer,                        as announced by the President, will
 repeat that exercise.
 "It's like doping horses," commented an
 irreveren, young Vietnamese army officer the
 other day.  `Tbey run for awhile and then
 you've got to give them another shot."
 Much of this criticism reflects uneasiness
 with  the degen,-,rating economic situation
 here. Tremendows  infusions  of  American
 money have simpl} unhinged and disrupted
 the local society tv the point at which a
 bargirl can earn in a, day what a longshore-
 inan makes in a month.
 Soaring  prices  ham  especially affected
 fixed-income  groups-civil  servants, army
 ofin.^ers,  schoolteachers and  other profes-
 siouals-who are the intelligentsia of any
 underdeveloped country.
 TENANT BEING EVICTED
 A middle-level civil servant is being evicted
 from his house this week, for example, be-
 cause his landlady can find an American
 tenant willing to pay $600 per month rent.
 The landlady, incidentally, is the wife of a
 prominent Vietnamese general.
 Economic disruption is naturally accom-
 panied by corruption, which is regarded here
 as almost as great an enemy to the country
 as the Communists.  Nearly everything, from
 construction  contracts to  the  delivery of
 motor scooters, which are rationed by the
 government, is said to require a payoff.
 Import licenses are being bought and sold,
 and it is feared that when the U.S. com-
 mercail import program is accelerated-in
 order to absorb the surplus currency in cir-
 culation-the traffic in licenses will boom.
 Characteristically, most of the critics of
 conditions here can offer. little in the way
 of constructive suggestions for handling the
 situation  more  effectively.  It  can be re-
 called that several of those in positions of
 authority today were themselves last year's
 critics, fulminating against the regime then
 in office and vowing to perform honestly
 and efficiently if they took power.
 FEAR OF ABANDONMENT
 Underlying this every-man-for-himself ap-
 proach, however, is perhaps the one feeling
 that touches nearly every Vietnamese.  it is
 a fear of being abandoned, forgotten, sold
 out.
 Over  the  past  generation,  Vietnamese
 hopes were buoyed up and then betrayed by
 the French, the Japanese, the Communists
 and by successive Saigon leaders.
 Despite  the  gallant  words  uttered  at
 Honolulu, the Vietnamese are not at all
 sure how much trust they can place in the
 United States-which in turn prompts some
 Americans here to wonder how much trust
 can be placed in the Vietnamese.
 (By Ward Just)
 SAIGON, February 16.-Saigon's economic
 situation, serious for the past year, is becom-
 ing critical, and diplomatic sources late it
 as second only to the Vietcong as "the most
 important political problem we have."
 According to government figures released
 yesterday, prices rose 10 percent last month
 over December and nearly 50 pereirt aver
 the year 1965.  There is an acute shortage of
 skilled labor, imports, and consumer goods.
 A flourishing black market and official cor-
 ruption add to the difficulties.
 Overhanging all is the massive infusion
 of U.S. funds, estimated to total $600 million
 in 1960.
 The problem is shot through with para-
 dox.  Vietnam, a country at war, has a boom-
 ing economy-but, informed economists say,
 it is an almost classic example of a sellers'
 market run riot.
 U.S. officials have made it clear to the
 government that they regard the situation
 with the utmost seriousness, and President
 Johnson  himself  reportedly  told  Premier
 Nguyen Cao Ky at the Honolulu conference
 last week that even if the military struggle
 is won, the gain would go up in smoke if the
 economic situation  deteriorates  further.
 The government, preoccupied with the war
 and lacking the competence to deal with
 economic complexities, has not been quick
 to confront the crisis.
 The black market, in money and in goods,
 has swollen.  There is no incomes policy, no
 price policy, only the bare beginnings of an
 import policy, very little control over hoard-
 ing.
 One key suggestion has been to increase
 taxes on "the winners" here-bar owners,
 landlords, hotel keepers.
 What the boom has done is throw the
 economy out of proportion, creating an eco-
 nomic problem first, but bringing social and
 political problems along with it.
 This is a country where a bar girl can
 make more than a Cabinet minister, where a
 cyclo driver in Saigon can make a killing a
 day if he caters to the Americans, where the
 labor shortage is so acute that the gigantic
 U.S. construction company, RMK, recently
 pirated a Vietnamese driver employed by the
 U.S. Embassy.
 Not all these effects are bad.  The boom
 has tended to get money into the hands of
 the urban poor, where it is most needed (as
 well as into the hands of the Chinese busi-
 nessmen, where it is not).   Farm income
 rose by an estimated 25 percent last year.
 But the pressure has been on prices: Milk,
 rice, and cloth have all gone up dramatically.
 Pork has risen, by one estimate, 200 percent
 in a year.
 Many of the goods people want can be pro-
 duced locally, but because of the war effort
 it is practically impossible to increase pro-
 duction.  The United States employs 100,000
 Vietnamese, for example.
 MORE CONSUMER GOODS
 It is understood that the United States
 itself will undertake to increase imports of
 consumer goods like radios, bikes, and tele-
 vision sets. But complicating that problem
 is an antic import licensing law and the
 difficulty of moving goods into Vietnamese
 ports.
 Officials here are frantically trying to open
 up the port of Saigon (where turn-around
 time for a vessel is frequently 2 to 3 weeks)
 to imports, to turn the sellers' market into a
 buyers' market.  But the heavy importation
 of military hardware makes it a difficult task,
 despite the improvements to the harbors of
 Danang and Quinhon and the Brobding-
 nagian effort at Camranh Bay.
 Rippling beneath the surface is the gov-
 ernment's refusal-or inability-to do any,-
 which many prices are tied.  The official rate
 is 73 piastres to the dollar. The black mar-
 ket rate was 135 piastres to the dollar in
 August and 170 last week.
 Sources here say that the gigantic U.S.
 construction effort must also be cut back.
 The U.S. Investment in construction is now
 estimated at $400 million a year, $100 million
 of which has a direct effect on the economy.
 AIRPORTS BEING BUILT
 The United States is. building everything
 from airports to billets, with a resulting
 pressure on iron, steel, and cement.  As one
 example of the social and political implica-
 tions,  10-year-old boys are becoming con-
 struction workers.
 The best that can be hoped for this year,
 economists say, is that the inflation rate will
 be held to 35 or 40 percent.
 Experts say that by the adroit use of a
 fiscal and monetary policy, a savings-bond
 campaign, for example, and a conscious effort
 at  belt-tightening,  the  crisis  might  be
 averted.
 But there is no enthusiasm for the war in
 this dazed and weary country, and the popu-
 lation is in no mood to accept stiff controls.
 While ARVN privates die in the swamps of
 Haunghia Province, well-off Vietnamese sun
 themselves at the swimming pool at the Cer-
 cle Sportif.
 While Americans struggle through the rice
 fields of Binhdinh, landlords refuse to sell
 land to the U.S. Government on which to
 build tent cities to relieve the acute housing
 shortage in Saigon.
 "There is no patriotism here," said one offi-
 cial.                                                                                             "I am not being negative.  I am being
 realistic."
 LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY
 Mr. KENNEDY of New York.  Mr.
 President, yesterday was a day of re-
 membrance for Lithuanians around the
 world. On February 16, 1918, this small
 but heroic country located on the rim of
 the Baltic Sea declared its independence
 from the great Russian State.  But the
 taste of freedom was short-lived for dur-
 ing the chaotic turmoil of World War II,
 this Baltic nation was absorbed into the
 vast Soviet empire. Since that time the
 Lithuanians have experienced the cold,
 driving demands of Communist control.
 Independent Lithuanian organizations
 around the world, however, have tried to
 keep alive the fire of freedom and inde-
 pendence which burned so brightly dur-
 ing the 1920's and 1930's.
 And the spirit of the Lithuanian peo-
 ple has not been dominated. For several
 years. following World War II, a coura-
 geous Lithuanian freedom freedom army
 actively resisted Soviet authorities. To-
 day, Lithuanians everywhere look to a
 time when their people will be once more
 able to follow their daily pursuits in free-
 dom.  Thus Lithuanian Independence
 Day has become an occasion not only for
 anguished rememberance but also for
 renewed hope. The people of this coun-
 try share the ideals of the people of
 Lithuania.  It is only appropriate that
 now and throughout the year we recall
 and record our admiration for the in-
 domitable                                                                                                         spirit  of  the  Lithuanian
 people.

 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. STENNIS.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for
 the quorum call be dispensed with.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 In accordance with the previous order,
 the Chair recognizes the Senator from
 Mississippi [Mr. STENNIS].
 WE  MUST  START  FROM  WHERE WE  ARE
 Mr. STENNIS.     Mr. President, on yes-
 terday, following the remarks by the
 distinguished Senator from Georgia [Mr.
 RUSSELLI, I made a few remarks on the
 pending bill, with reference to the money
 figures in it.
 This is an authorization bill, but it
 is certainly a money bill, and almost the
 same as an appropriation bill.  In a few
 days after this bill passes, we shall have
 an appropriation bill before us.
 I point out, in addition to the points
 I made about the money yesterday, that
 a substantial part-at least 30 percent,
 perhaps--of the funds provided in this
 bill has actually already been spent be-
 cause of the war in Vietnam.  At least
 that much will be used, after we appro-
 priate it, to replace the funds that have
 been used during the first, second, and
 third quarters of the current fiscal year,
 expenditures that have been made as
 part of the expenses of that war.  The
 money provided by this bill will replace
 those funds for the fourth quarter.
 There is nothing illegal about that. It
 was authorized by the bill. However, the
 fact that it was necessary is one of the
 main reasons why I called attention last
 year, when we were considering the bill,
 and I was handling it at that time, to
 the fact that the Defense Department
 should have requested more money than
 was being requested at that time.
 At that time only $1,700 million was
 expressly earmarked for southeast Asia.
 It was generally known that it would
 require much more money than that.  It
 has taken money out of the "hide" of
 the military budget.  As I have said, we
 are spending fourth quarter money be-
 cause we are running out of items for the
 first, second, and third quarter. This
 money will be used to replace the money
 that has been used for that purpose.
 February 28 is about the critical date
 when these funds should be available to
 keep the accounts in the Defense Depart-
 ment from being embarrassed.
 Mr. President, I wish to give a special
 tale to the remarks I shall make today
 on the bill as a whole and the questions
 involved.  That title is that we must
 start from where Nye are with reference
 to the war in Vietnam.  This question is
 not one of how we got there.   That
 question has  long  since passed. We
 have been in Vietnam since 1954. The
 question is not why we went over there.
 We can argue that question endlessly.
 It may be relevant, but it :is not in issue
 now, because we have been there all this
 time.  So the title of my remarks is,
 "We Must Start From Where We Are."
 I said yesterday, and I repeat today,
 that I shall not vote for any amend-
 rnent to the bill, unless error should be
 shown in the figures, even though such
 amendment may sustain my policy views
 on the question of the war and what
 should be done about it.  I would cer-
 tainly vote against any that was drawn
 to endorse an apposing policy.  Such a
 proposal or argument can be made to ter,
 in a proper manner. The real point is
 that our men are fighting, bleeding, and
 (lying.  The war goes on.  The !ships,
 planes,  carriers,  and everything  else
 must move.  The money must be appro-
 priated for those purposes.   Our men
 must have more than they need; nut the
 minimum of what they may need.
 Mr. ROBERTSON.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator from Mississippi yield"
 Mr. STENNIS.  I am glad to yield to
 the distinguished Senator from Virginia,
 a member of our subcommittee.
 Mr. ROBERTSON.  I wish to be asso-
 ciated with the fine patriotic sentiments
 which have been expressed so well by the
 distinguished Senator from Mississippi,
 who has for years handled the military
 construction authorization bill, and for
 It or 2 years handled the total appropri-
 ation bill.
 This bill provides an authorization for
 war material, where needed, by those who
 are committed to the war.  As the Sen-
 ator has said, this is not the time for an
 argument about how we got there or why
 we got there, or to put in this particular
 bill policy statements. I assure him that
 if share those sentiments, and I shall so
 vote.
 Mr. STENNIS.  I thank the Senator
 ;Prom Virginia for his remarks and for his
 solid support, which is always forthcom-
 ing.  He is a member of our appropria-
 Lions subcommittee, and is unusually
 well informed.  I repeat, we must; start
 from where we are.
 Mr. President, I wholehea.rtedl,  sup-
 port S. 2791 and the $4.8 billion of sup-
 plemental  military  authorizations                                                                       for
 southeast Asia which it provides.   Sen-
 ators may recall that during considera-
 Lion of the southeast Asia $1.7 billion
 addendum to the fiscal year 1966 mili-
 tary budget last August, I predicted that
 a much greater amount would be re-
 quested of the Congress in January.  It
 was clear to me then that the appropria-
 tions requested were entirely inadequate
 to fund our expanding operations in
 Vietnam.
 No one has a greater or more sincere
 desire than I for halting the war in Viet-
 uam and ending the sacrifice of vauable
 American lives.  I have supported and
 will continue to support every construc-
 tive effort seeking an honorable solution
 to this tragic problem and an honorable
 end to our involvement.  Bringing this
 tragic war to an honorable conclusion is
 the first order of business with me and
 should be the first order of business with
 all patriotic and thoughtful Americans.
 That means to me that this takes a
 high and top priority over any domestic
 program; both the old ones and the new
 ones, call theme Great Society or what-
 ever they may be called.
 The first order of business of Congress
 is to try to bring this war to an honor-
 able conclusion with the least possible
 loss of life and expenditure of funds.
 The American people, both in and out
 of the Congress, are rightfully concerned
 about our involvement in South Vietnam
 and about its implications for the fu-
 ture.  They want to know and are en-
 titled to know just what our policy is
 and where we are headed.
 This is as it should be.
 That is why I believe these bills should
 be considered now on a first priority
 basis.
 However,  devisive  criticism  which
 gives to the world and our troops in
 the  field  the  impression the United
 States is a divided Nation working at
 cross purposes and lacking in unity is
 an entirely different question. This
 serves to reenforce the belief of the
 Asiatic Communists that we are lacking
 in national purpose, determination, and
 moral strength, and lowers the morale
 of our troops in the field.
 There are those who insist that we
 should undertake meaningful negotia-
 tions at the conference table to bring
 this war to an end.  They overlook the
 very clear fact that we have made every
 effort to achieve this result and that the
 recent unprecedented diplomatic effort
 to open the door to negotiations was un-
 productive.
 There are those who say that the en-
 tire matter should be turned over to the
 United Nations to work out a just settle-
 ment.  We have now gone to the United
 Nations with this problem and there ap-
 pears to be no evidence that the United
 Nations is capable of achieving any sig-
 nificant or dramatic results.
 There are those who insist that we
 limit the war as much as possible and
 make every effort to avoid a wider war.
 This has been our policy and purpose.
 No right thinking person in America
 desires an escalation of this war or the
 loss of American lives.  However,  we
 have been compelled to meet aggressive
 force with the force which is necessary
 to contain and repel it.  To do otherwise
 would put victory in doubt and raise the
 possibility that we might be driven into
 the sea.  At best, it would mean a long
 and bloody stalemate of 10 to 15 years or
 more, which, in the long run, would be
 the most costly in blood and money.
 Mr. President, that is a very substan-
 tial point in my mind.  I hope that we
 are not at the point where we must en-
 gage in a long and bloody stalemate year
 after year. This has been the policy of
 other nations in Asia in decades past but
 it certainly must not become our policy.
 I do not believe the American people
 wish to approach it in that way.  I do
 not believe that they would endorse such
 a policy.
 Debate, of course, is useful and should
 not be curtailed.  I do believe, however,
 that in this difficult time debate should
 be helpful, constructive, and positive,
 rather than negative and divisive.  We
 had a very good debate here yesterday
 afternoon. However, in all of the recent
 debate and criticism, so far as I can see,

 er and deeper, we shall certainly be con-
 fronted with the problem of controls.
 Tragically, the toll of American casual-
 ties will go even higher, and additional
 thousands of American fighting men may
 be called upon to lay down their lives in
 defense of their country and the cause
 of freedom.
 After soul-searching and conscientious
 analysis of the entire situation and its
 implications for our future, I have come
 to the conclusion that the one course that
 we should and must follow is that of
 bringing sufficient military might to bear
 to force our Communist enemies, to the
 conference table or, failing that, to de-
 feat them on the field of battle.  Only
 this alternative, in my judgment, offers
 us a chance to peace with honor. I be-
 lieve that the sooner we undertake this
 and get about doing the job, the less
 will be the cost in lives, time, and money.
 Where I have use the term "war" in
 this speech, I have done so advisedly.
 We all known that we have been carrying
 a major part of fighting the bloody war
 in South Vietnam for many months.
 That does not discredit in the least the
 South Vietnamese soldier.  Under our
 training and with our, equipment-and
 they themselves have many good of-
 ficers-they have developed into excel-
 lent soldiers. But the push, the aggres-
 siveness, and the offensive part of the
 battle, and much of the manpower, of
 course, is provided by the United States.
 We are having to carry a great part of the
 We have put our men and our flag on
 the field of battle and both have been
 fired upon.  We now have more than
 200,000 fightingmen actually deployed in
 South Vietnam and many thousands
 more directly support them in south-
 east Asia.                   When I say "many thousands
 more," I mean perhaps 40,000 or 50,000
 more, at the very least; including our
 naval forces and carriers and more mem-
 bers of the Air Force, in addition to the
 200,000 who are on the mainland of Viet-
 nam  itself.  More than 2,000 young
 Americans have already been called upon
 to make the final and greatest sacrifice
 for their country.
 I am making this enumeration to place
 before the people what I believe will be
 the cost of this policy; but I believe it is
 necessary, and the quicker we face it, the
 better.
 Our commitment in South Vietnam is
 constantly growing in terms of men,
 material and money.   Barring a com-
 pletely unexpected and unforeseen de-
 velopment, it will grow even more before
 we reach the end of the road.
 Informed sources tell me-and they
 are speculating-that we may very well
 have 350,000 to 400,000 troops in the field
 before the end of this year.  Those are
 not my figures.  I do not know; those
 who- tell me do not know either.  But
 informed sources give this as their
 :speculative judgment.
 Let me give one further word of warn-
 ing before  conclude.  Today, we very
 properly concentrate our attention on
 southeast Asia. However, in so doing we
 must not overlook the very real pos-
 sibility that our Communist enemies may
 undertake additional' adventure andI ag-
 gressions at other, places around the
 world where our vital interests are in-
 volved.  Therefore, we must be certain
 that we do not let the drain which Viet-
 nam  imposes  u  n  our  manpower,
 material and resources impair the readi-
 ness of our remaini g forces to meet ag-
 gression at other potential hotspots
 around the world. We must spend the
 necessary money to supply the shortages
 which the requirements of Vietnam have
 created.
 We must face the fact that until re-
 cently we have been trying to operate on
 a peacetime budget, in fighting what was
 a very expensive an  growing war exactly
 halfway around the world.
 Some of the funds involved in the
 pending bill will be used to replenish the
 materiel, the military hardware, and like
 supplies which have been burned up and
 used up from the regular resources of
 our armed services.   We must procure
 the necessary arms and equipment sup-
 plies, and ammunition.  We must re-
 cruit and train the necessary man-
 power.
 Our manpower has been drained from
 other units in order to meet the demands
 of the situation in Vietnam.
 We must not be found wanting or be
 unready  to  respond  to  aggression in
 other areas in which our vital interests
 are involved, if it should occur.
 I do not believe I am an alarmist, but
 if we should let this war drag on, on just
 a holding basis, and fight it as a kind
 of diplomatic war, I believe we would be
 inviting smaller wars to break out by
 this or another aggressor, in one,form or
 another, in other places.
 The only reason why they have not
 broken out in other places, such as in
 Central and South America, is that there
 is our growing power.
 I close this statement by paying a
 special tribute to our brave men who
 fight and sometimes die in Vietnam.
 They are doing a tremendous job under
 very difficult circumstances.  They fight
 for the cause of freedom with the same
 high morale, courage, valor, and skill
 which have distinguished the American
 soldier, sailor, airman, and marine in all
 past battles and wars of our history.
 .I believe it has already been demon-
 strated that we have sent much of the
 cream of the manpower crop to Vietnam.
 That is not to speak disparagingly of any
 man who has not been sent there. How-
 ever, the corporals, sergeants, and spe-
 cialists in certain fields are among the
 best men in our military forces. We have
 also sent our best lieutenants, captains,
 and majors, and right up the line in rank.
 That is true of our Army, our Naval
 Forces, of the Marine Corps, and of the
 Air Force.
 These men prove again that a properly
 motivated American is the finest fighting
 man the world has ever known.  They
 deserve the gratitude and unstinting sup-
 port of all Americans and freedom-loving
 peoplesw everywhere.
 Let us pass this `bill with dispatch.
 Debate and discussion are a part of, our
 system of government.  But with men
 fighting, bleeding, and even dying on the
 battlefields, it is time to act in voting
 funds to insure the .equipment, the sup-
 plies, the military hardware, and other
 tools of war necessary to enable them to
 carry out their missions, protect them-
 selves, and insure a positive victory.
 Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, will the Senator yield?
 Mr.. STENNIS.  I yield.
 The PRESIDING_ OFFICER (Mr. BYRD
 of Virginia in the chair) .  The Senator
 from Georgia is recognized.
 Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia.  Mr. Pres-
 ident, I congratulate the distinguished
 Senator from Mississippi upon the very
 able address he has just delivered.
 Mr. STENNIS.  Mr. President, I thank
 the Senator.
 Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia.  The Sena-
 tor from Mississippi is familiar with
 every aspect of this matter, particularly
 the military one, in view of the fact that
 he presides over the very important Pre-
 paredness Investigating Subcommittee
 of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
 I well remember that when the ques-
 tion first arose of sending men to Viet-
 nam, it was proposed that we send some
 200 men to assist the French to prepare
 and maintain and keep in the air the
 planes that the French had in Vietnam.
 Most of the planes there were American
 planes.  I believe we gave the French
 approximately $3 billion to support them
 in their abortive effort to hold on in
 Vietnam.
 The distinguished Senator from Mis-
 sissippi is entitled to great praise as a
 prophet.  I remember that the Senator
 from  Mississippi  made  one  or  more
 speeches at that time in opposition to
 sending men into Vietnam, because of the
 lack of congressional approval and also
 because of the geographic disadvantages.
 I discussed this subject with the Sen-
 ator from Mississippi on many occasions
 in 1954.  On one occasion when we had
 a conference at the highest echelons of
 the executive branch we were informed
 of a proposal to send 200 men to Vietnam.
 I made a serious understatement by pre-
 dicting, "If we send 200 men there now,
 it will not be long until we will have
 20,000 men there."  Today we find that
 we have closer to 300,000 men in Viet-
 nam, and the waters and lands adjacent
 thereto.  We hardly could have let the
 Communists euchre us into a more diffi-
 cult position. It is one of the most dif-
 ficult and unlikely spots in the world in
 which to fight a war.
 I have had many reasons to think
 about that position.
 In Vietnam there are the valleys of the
 Mekong and the highlands of the north.
 As a rule, we associate malaria with the
 lowlands, but it so happens that in Viet-
 nam malaria is found in the highlands.
 The malaria found there is of a type for
 which we now have no completely satis-
 factory medications.
 I have almost concluded that perhaps
 the only other area of the world in which
 it would be more difficult to engage in a
 war would be Afghanistan or in the
 mountains of Tibet. It would be more
 difficult to get to those areas; and there
 would also be the matter of logistics.
 I am particularly impressed by the
 cogent reasoning of the Senator from
 Mississippi that, if this war were not
 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400030007-8
 February 17, moved Fortg1019ft9RP~7QQ?4000400030007-8
 going on in Vietnam, we might have a
 military confrontation somewhere else.
 The  Communist- world' has  never
 deviated from its purpose, its drive, and
 its determination to achieve world dom-
 ination,  It will.,be probing everywhere
 on earth for weak spots. If the Commu-
 nists are unable to find weak spots in
 Asia or in Europe, they will then come
 to this hemisphere, and we shall have
 rash of wars of national liberation or
 wars of some other nomenclature, and
 we shall have some slogan other than
 the one now being used in Vietnam.
 I am glad that from his knowledge of
 military affairs the Senator has pointed
 out' that we are spread rather thin all
 over the world today.
 We have highly trained and well-
 equipped forces in Germany and Korea.
 A part of the force we had held in re-
 serve in the continental United States
 has had to be moved to Vietnam and to
 the Dominican Republic.
 Ours is a rather farfiung battleline,
 Mr. President, when we consider the
 widely separated areas where our troops
 are stationed. It certainly behooves us
 to be more insistent than ever before
 that our allies, for whom we have done
 so much, make a larger contribution to
 the defense of freedom throughout-the
 world.
 There is no parallel in all human his-
 tory to what this country did at the end
 of World War II. We not only bound up
 the wounds and rebuilt the edifices and
 the homes of our allies; we went to those
 with whom we had been only recently
 engaged in mortal combat, the Germans
 and the Japanese, and expended billions
 of dollars to revive their economies and
 enable them to stand on their own feet
 again.
 Countries like these, which have re-
 ceived benefits that are without parallel
 in all of history, should be willing to
 make a larger military contribution to
 preserving the cause of peace.
 We shall not have complete peace in
 this troubled world any time soon, but
 we. can at least contain this Communist
 problem.  Would that 'we had cleaned
 up Cuba of Castro and the Communists
 there at the time we discovered that
 missiles had been placed in Cuba.  As
 Senators will recall, we had passed a
 joint resolution, approved by the Presi-
 dent of the United States, which said in
 essence that any offensive weapon in
 Cuba would be considered an act of ag-
 gression against the United States.
 We had the means to destroy the ene-
 my in Cuba, and to eliminate Castro and
 communism. We had marines at sea,
 just out of sight of land.  We had the
 necessary air support at bases in Florida.
 We had moved an armored division from
 Port Hood, Tex., to Camp Stewart, Ga.,
 ready to load on ships so that it could
 follow the marines in.
 But we settled for something less than
 that; and it may well develop in the fu-
 ture that we settled for a great deal less.
 The Russians did not complyt with the
 original assurances they gave President
 Kennedy when he wrote them that fa-
 mous message demanding that they pull
 out of Cuba and give us the right to in-
 spect, to see that they had removed those
 weapons.  That was a right that was
 promised us; but was later denied and
 refused.
 We shall continue to be troubled, as
 the Senator from Mississippi has so well
 indicated, by the threat of communism.
 I think we can handle it better than it
 has been handled, in many instances.
 We can achieve more of our objectives
 by methods other than engagement of
 armed forces and the loss of blood that
 is occurring this very moment in Viet-
 nam. But there will be no time, I fear,
 in my life, or even in the life of my
 friend from Mississippi-who is, much
 younger and stronger than I-when the
 threat of Comumnist aggression will be
 absolutely allayed and destroyed all over
 the world.  We shall be compelled to
 bear a heavy burden to maintain a force
 for freedom-which is an insurance pol-
 icy.  The huge amount that we spend is
 the premium on the insurance policy
 which insures the most valuable thing
 on earth: the American way of life, and
 the individual rights, liberties, and dig-
 nities of the citizen in this land of ours.
 I feel better when men who are as
 dedicated as the Senator from Missis-
 sippi are willing to apply themselves to
 this .very onerous task.
 Senators who have not served on the
 Preparednes Subcommittee can hardly
 imagine the extent of the efforts by that
 subcommittee on the Senate Armed
 Services Committee, in our attempts to
 keep America strong.  Despite the very
 best we can do, and despite the most ef-
 ficient administration of the Depart-
 ment of Defense, there will be some over-
 sights; there will be something lacking.
 The Senator from Mississippi, as chair-
 man of that subcommitee, has done a
 fine job in pointing out such deficiencies
 and correcting them. He stands here to-
 day making his statement in the great
 tradition  of  American  freedom  and
 American statesmanship, and I com-
 mend him for his remarks.
 Mr. STENNIS.  I thank the Senator
 from Georgia very much for his most
 generous remarks.  In all the years I
 have been in the Senate, the wise counsel
 of the Senator from Georgia and his ad-
 vice on military matters and other mat-
 ters has been of great value.  He has
 always been up at the front where the
 decisions were made.  I think he has
 given as little consideration to himself
 personally, in his advice and counsel, as
 any person I have ever known.
 I remember the occasion in 1954 when
 the Senator from Georgia helped turn
 the balance against a proposal that
 would have gone a great deal further
 than the involvement of 200 Air Force
 mechanics in Vietnam. I remember well
 how President Eisenhower sent for him
 time and again.  He and the present
 President of the United States were both
 opposed to our involvement in the situa-
 tion as it stood then.
 I am delighted to have been associated
 with, the Senator from Georgia in the
 matters to which he has referred.  He
 taught me all I know on the subject;
 and I thank him for that.
 Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, to the Senator's very generous ob-
 servations, I wish only to add that when
 someone brings forward some alternative
 to the present program, some proposal of
 a method for our disengaging ourselves
 in Vietnam in an honorable fashion,
 without turning' tail and running like a
 whipped puppy, I shall be happy to sup-
 port such aproposal, because I deplore
 what is going on in Vietnam today, with
 the loss of human lives, as much as any-
 one possibly can. In the absence of such
 an honorable solution, I have no alter-
 native to supporting the President.
 Mr. STE1 NIS.  I am glad that the
 Senator from Georgia referred to our
 stretched-out position.  He is as quali-
 fied to speak as any living person on the
 subject of our extended efforts all around
 the world, and how the time of peril and
 trouble in which we are living will con-
 tinue for awhile.
 I am sure that in his references to our
 allies, the Senator does not wish to dis-
 credit any of them.  I know he is not
 quick to "pop off," if I may use that term,
 on such matters. But what he says is
 very timely and very true.  Our allies
 have, in effect, turned their backs upon
 us in this distressing situation. Many of
 them, for whom we have done so much,
 could help with manpower; and even
 those who could not help us with man-
 power could stand up for us in the diplo-
 matic circles of the world, take our side,
 and let it be known that this is a matter
 of first priority with them.  Instead of
 that, some of them are actively opposed
 to our position.
 I yield to the Senator from Montana.
 Mr. METCALF.  I thank the Sena-
 tor from Mississippi for clarifying many
 of the issues involved in this bill.
 I marched with the 1st Army, in the
 9th Infantry Division.  I served under
 General Westmoreland, who was then a
 lieutenant colonel, my regimental com-
 mander.  I have great confidence in him.
 I have watched his career since that time
 as an artilleryman, as an infantryman,
 as the superintendent of West Point, and
 as a paratroop officer.  In my judgment
 he is the finest commander in the Ameri-
 can Army.  He has one of the hardest
 jobs that any American general ever
 faced.  I feel that, even as I had confi-
 dence in him when I marched with the
 9th Division, the men who are fighting
 under him in Vietnam today have confi-
 dence in him.
 The point that the Senator from
 Mississippi has made is that we must give
 to him, his staff, his junior officers, his
 noncommissioned officers, and every man
 who is serving in Vietnam, as well as
 every one of the Vietnamese and every
 one of our allies, all the materials of war
 that they need. If they need a missile, if
 they need a helicopter, if they need addi-
 tional artillery, if they need more ammu-
 nition, we must give it to them; and that
 is what the pending bill would do.
 As was pointed out yesterday by the
 Senator from Georgia  [Mr. RUSSELL],
 this bill does not determine foreign
 policy.  It does not ratify decisions made
 in the past. It does not endorse new
 commitments.  It merely provides that
 whatever we do, we are going to give our
 boys who have volunteered out of a sense
 of patriotism, as well as boys who went
 into the Army as a result of the Selective

 Service System and were compelled to go
 over there, the fullest kind of support,
 the kind of weapons, the kind of anks,
 and the kind of materiel wluch they need.
 Mr. President, I Intend to vote for the
 bill wholeheartedly because I feel that we
 are committed to _a war that is one of the
 most difficult ever to be fought, as has
 been pointed out by the Senator from
 Georgia. We must wholeheartedly sup-
 port every one of the soldiers whom we
 have sent over there. That is what this
 bill would do. If -we are to debate policy
 on Vietnam, if we are to debate what we
 are to do in Vietnam, let us debate it on
 the kind of issue which does not mean
 denying our troops over there, or General
 Westmoreland, and his fine staff, the kind
 of support which they need.
 Mr. STENNIS.  I thank the ' Senator
 from Montana very much for his fine
 remarks.
 I yield now to the Senator from Ten-
 nessee [Mr. GORE].
 Mr. GORE.   Mr. President, I join in
 the sentiments expressed with respect to
 the character 'of service and leadership
 provided, and the wisdom exemplified by
 the able Senator from Georgia [Mr.
 RUSSELL].
 I recall that as a junior Senator I,
 along with the Senator from Mississippi
 [Mr,  STENNIS],  and  other  Senators,
 awaited the return of the Senator from
 Georgia and the then Democratic leader,
 Senator Lyndon Johnson, from a confer-
 ence which was called at the White House
 prior to the tragedy of Dienbienphu for
 the French,
 I believe that I correctly recall the re-
 port we received from the late Secretary
 of State John Poster Dulles, and Admiral
 Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
 of Staff, and perhaps others, urging
 President Eisenhower to send American
 troops to Vietnam to assist the French.
 I recall that upon the return of the
 Senator from Georgia and the Senator
 from Texas, we were advised that they
 had strongly advised against it.  I do not
 believe that we got the report from them
 as to what President Eisenhower's de-
 cislon was, but later the President fol-
 lowed that advice.
 I recall one.further point, that when
 the question of the 200 men to whom the
 Senator from Mississippi had made re-
 ferenee-the first American military men
 sent there-was under consideration, the
 Senator from Georgia advised that if 'we
 sent 200 men, they would be followed by
 200,000.  Let me ask the Senator from
 Georgia whether that statement is cor-
 rect.
 Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia.  The Sen-
 ator gives me too much credit.          I believe
 I said that if we sent 200 troops over
 there, 20,000 would have to follow in the
 very near future.  I believe that was my
 prediction at that time.
 Mr. GORE.  Perhaps, that is typical
 of the creeping escalation we have ex-
 perienced on this issue, but 20,000 still
 makes the ,point. The case of the mili-
 tary forces was the event from which
 have flowed many other problems. I in-
 vite the attention of the Senate to this
 point, because of the pertinent remarks
 which the junior Senator from Missis-
 sippi has made.
 I wish to say to him that I am grate-
 ful for the candor which he has displayed
 on this bill.  Not from his lips have come
 denunciation of Senators who have ques-
 tions in their minds, who are troubled
 by the, vexatious predicament in which
 we find purselyes,  Instead, the Sena-
 tor. from Mississippi has invited debate.
 It seems to me that our aim must be to
 contribute to the formulation of policy
 for the enlightenment of the people with
 respect to that policy in a manner which
 will bring unity to the people, which is
 so badly needed.
 As the war has been widened, the gap
 between the President and Congress
 seems also to have widened.  Unrest
 among the people has increased.
 This morning, I thought that General
 Taylor did an excellent job in presenting
 to the Committee on Foreign Relations
 the administration's policy in this re-
 gard.
 There Are many questions left to be
 asked, of course. But, if, out of all this
 debate and an examination of policy can
 come enlightenment of the people and
 Congress, and perhaps a modification of
 policy on the part of the administration
 and some limitations of objectives which
 the people can understand and support,
 then perhaps we shall have achieved a
 degree of unity which I believe is badly
 from Tennessee very much for his very
 fine comments.
 I am now glad to yield to the Senator
 from Alaska [Mr. GRUENING].
 Mr. GRUENING.  First, let me con-
 gratulate both the chairman of the Pre-
 paredness Subcommittee and the chair-
 man of the Armed Services Committee
 for their great wisdom-when the issue
 of first invading Vietnam militarily by
 our forces came up--in opposing it, and
 for saying that it would be unwise policy,
 that it would lead to a much deeper in-
 volvement than appeared to be contem-
 plated at that time, and that they joined
 in their counsels to the President and
 others in, opposing this involvement.
 I believe that their wisdom was pro-
 phetic and very great. It is to be regret-
 ted that their wisdom at that time did
 not prevail, because I believe we might
 have put across the thought which would
 have prevented many things which have
 happened since that time and which are
 leading us down a tragic path, the end
 of which no one can foresee.
 I find myself in thorough agreement
 with some of the very fine sentiments
 which the Senator from Mississippi has
 expressed, and which the chairman of
 the full committee, the Senator from
 Georgia [Mr.  RUSSELL]  has also ex-
 pressed, when he said a few moments
 ago that he would join in supporting any
 solution which would give us an honor-
 able way out and stop the needless
 slaughter, not only of our own boys but
 also of all others.  I know of no Member
 of Congress who would not share that
 view.  Although there may be differ-
 ences of opinion as to how that way
 should be found, no one in Congress and
 no one in the United States would dis-
 sent from that statement, and I applaud
 it most heartily.
 17, 1966
 The Senator from Mississippi says:
 No one has a greater or more sincere desire
 than I for halting the war in Vietnam and
 ending the sacrifices of American lives.
 I applaud that sentiment, and I share
 it. I believe that we must all work to-
 gether to that end, although some of us
 may differ in details, and some of us will
 differ on the future.
 It is extremely important and fortu-
 nate that this debate has at last come to
 pass.  Out of the discussions more wis-
 dom may emerge, and we may be able
 to arrive at a better solution than that
 which we are now embarked upon.
 We do not know where this debate is
 going to lead, but certainly we shall find
 agreement on the desire to find an hon-
 orable way out of the situation at the
 earliest possible moment. I support that
 view 100 percent.
 Mr. STENNIS.  I thank the Senator
 from Alaska very much.
 Now I am glad to yield to the Senator
 from Wyoming [Mr. McGEE].
 Mr. McGEE.  Let me add my voice to
 those of my colleagues in commending
 the Senator from Mississippi, as well as
 the Senator from Georgia for the hard,
 bedrock stand which they have taken on
 this difficult question. What we tend to
 do, sometimes, is to reduce the question
 to overly simple terms, as though we had
 decided we were going to risk a war or
 live in peace, when that really is not the
 alternative which faces this country.
 We are living in a troubled world in
 which almost every day the risk of war
 is imminent.  When the Senator titles
 his comments the way he did, he puts his
 finger on the nub of the question;
 namely, that we have to begin where we
 are at present.
 It is water over the dam. We cannot
 do it over.  History does not afford us
 the luxury of waiting 5 years before we
 make up our minds. We have to decide
 these issues now. When the Senator re-
 minds us that here is a beginning, here
 is where we must start, he is rendering a
 great service to the dialog.
 I should like to refer to the suggestions
 that have repeatedly occurred here on
 the part of my colleagues about our hav-
 ing to carry a disproportionate share of
 the burden in South Vietnam.  I think
 occasionally we forget that a great pow-
 er is not usually loved, and we sometimes
 tend to think, in affairs around the
 world, that we can put love on a prior-
 ity.  We have to put necessity, our own
 needs, the need to rise to our commit-
 ments and the demands of those com-
 mitments, on a priority. If someone will
 love us in the process, that is merely a
 fringe benefit.
 Nobody loved the British when they
 kept the peace of the world for almost
 100 years. In fact, the perfidious Albion
 was the object of much attack.  So we
 must not judge of our actions an whether
 or not we shall be loved for them.  We
 may hope that those we help will be
 grateful, but we may also be kicked In
 the face for our efforts.
 We must keep the situation in per-
 spective as to what is happening in var-
 ious parts of the world.

 mitted in other areas of the world. Ger-
