 March 7, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 We might go through a long hassle.
 But the fact has been accomplished. The
 lawsuit has not been filed for the pur-
 pose of destroying that accomplishment.
 Even though I object to it very strongly,
 I think we would approve it when it came
 here, and that is the whole purpose.
 Mr. GLENN. That is my understanding
 of the r,:-ocedure that would have to be
 employed. I misinterpreted what was
 said earlier.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I thank my friend
 for calling my attention to it.
 ORDER FOR RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
 TOMORROW
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent that when the
 Senate completes its business today, it
 stand in recess until 10 o'clock tomorrow
 morning.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 ROUTINE MORNING BUSINESS
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the
 previous order, there will now be a period
 for the transaction of routine morning
 business, for not to exceed 10 minutes,
 with statements therein limited to 2
 minutes each.
 APPOINTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT
 PRO TEMPORE
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Chair, on behalf of the President pro
 tempore, pursuant to Public Law 93-568,
 appoints Ms. Marian G. Gallagher, of
 Seattle, Wash., to the Advisory Commit-
 tee to the White House Conference on
 Library and Information Services, in lieu
 of Mr. J. C. Redd, of Jackson, Miss.
 MR. SCHLESINGER AS SECRETARY
 OF ENERGY
 Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, on
 February 5, 1978, I publicly called for
 the resignation of James Schlesinger as
 Secretary of Energy. A few days later,
 in a meeting at the White House, I re-
 peated the request personally to the
 President. At the time, I said that Dr.
 Schlesinger had lost his credibility with
 the American people and was a distinct
 handicap to the President.
 In nearly 13 months since then, much
 has happened on the energy scene, but
 nothing has happened to change my orig-
 inal opinion. In fact, virtually every
 action taken by the Secretary of Energy
 has only reinforced my feeling that
 nothing major will be accomplished in
 our energy situation until we have new
 leadership at DOE.
 Dr. Schlesinger's latest effort to secure
 higher gasoline prices for the oil industry
 is just one more example of how the
 American consumer is being held hostage
 by the Department of Energy.
 Nearly 3 months ago, Dr. Schlesinger
 began his campaign to effect decontrol
 of gasoline prices. At a hearing of the
 Senate Energy and Natural Resources
 Committee, the Department of Energy
 was given a clear message that the Con-
 gress would not give its approval to such
 a request. With our soaring rate of in-
 flation, it is patently obvious that it is
 the duty of every branch of the Govern-
 ment to do its utmost to lessen the bur-
 den on the consumer.
 Somehow, however, that message has
 not gotten through to the Secretary of
 Energy. Or, possibly, the Secretary feels
 that his Department has a special im-
 munity or dispensation that allows him
 to exercise his own prerogatives, even
 though they are in direct contradiction
 to the will of the Congress.
 Knowing that there is no way that
 Congress will approve the decontrol of
 gasoline prices. The Secretary of Energy
 is now using the Iranian situation as a
 rationale to give administrative approvals
 to higher gasoline prices by changing
 some of its regulations. By invoking a
 "tilt pricing concept," the Department of
 Energy expects to be able to allow the oil
 companies to get what they wanted any-
 way-higher prices.  '
 In a March 5, 1979, article in the New
 York Times by Steven Rattner, the latest
 Schlesinger move is correctly labeled
 "surreptitious decontrol." in part, the
 article reads:
 Although the Iranian crisis has at least
 temporarily ended plans to seek gasoline and
 crude oil decontrol, the energy officials are
 engaged in what one called surreptitious de-
 control. That means arcane changes in reg-
 ulations on gasoline to increase incentives for
 refiners and higher prices for various types
 of crude oil that' will bring the price of a
 quickly increasing percentage of oil to world
 levels.
 How the Secretary of Energy can jus-
 tify increased incentives for an industry
 that keeps reporting astronomical record
 profits is beyond me.
 Almost daily we can read in a maga-
 zine or newspaper a new criticism of Dr.
 Schlesinger. Last week, in a syndicated
 column appearing in the Washington
 Post, Marquis Childs had this to say
 about the Secretary:
 In Congress he is considered arrogant, over-
 bearing, bent on setting his own course re-
 gardless of what anyone else may think. The
 latest irritant is an interview in which he did
 a gloom-and-doom act predicting higher gas-
 oline and fuel oil prices and long lines at the
 gas pumps as a result of the loss of Iranian
 oil. He failed, however, to come down hard
 for any course that might conserve gasoline
 and reduce the flow of imports.
 His recent actions in our negotiations
 with our neighbors in Mexico have
 brought us embarrassing problems and
 could cause irreparable harm to our fu-
 ture plans for decreasing our dependency
 on Mideast oil.
 Mr. President, the American people are
 well aware that we have serious energy
 problems and I believe they 'are willing
 to make the necessary sacrifices to help
 solve them. But they are confused and
 frustrated because of the constantly
 changing signals they are receiving from
 their Department of Energy. Until they
 are convinced they can rely on what they
 are hearing from Washington, it is going
 to be extremely difficult to motivate them
 to act.
 I do not believe that motivation is
 going to come until there is new leader-
 ship at the Department of Energy. Once
 S 2121
 more, for the good of the Nation, I urge
 Secretary Schlesinger to perform the
 highest in public service and submit his
 resignation to the President.
 CONCLUSION OF MORNING
 BUSINESS
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 morning business? If not, morning busi-
 ness is closed.
 TAIWAN ENABLING ACT
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the
 previous order, the Senate will now re-
 sume consideration of the pending busi-
 ness, S. 245, which will be stated by
 title.
 The assistant legislative clerk read as
 follows:
 A bill  (S. 245)  to promote the foreign
 policy of the United States through the
 maintenance of commercial, cultural, and
 other relations with the people of Taiwan on
 an unofficial basis, and for other purposes.
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest
 the absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will call the roll.
 The assistant legislative clerk pro-
 ceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 PRYOR). Without objection, it is so
 ordered.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I hope that Senators will come to the
 Chamber with their amendments.
 We started on the legislation on Mon-
 day. There was little time taken on Mon-
 day. I believe only Senator GLENN and
 Senator JAVITS made speeches that day,
 and those statements were not lengthy.
 There may have been other statements
 that I am not aware of. We certainly did
 not stay in long Monday. Senators had
 an opportunity to make statements on
 the measure. Those Senators who have
 amendments I hope will get to the Cham-
 ber and call them up so we can begin to
 move on this legislation. I hope we will
 complete action on the bill by tomorrow
 evening.
 I suggest the absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will call the roll.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 proceeded to call- the roll.
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for
 the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the bill we
 take up today, S. 245, the Taiwan en-
 abling legislation, has been significantly
 modified by the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee to correct deficiencies in the orig-
 inal administration proposal. The revised
 bill clarifies many ambiguities regarding
 trade, legal, and economic issues, in addi-
 tion to inserting a specific security clause
 designed to reassure the people on
 Taiwan and alert the PRC to our ex-
 pectations concerning the future.
 Many Members share my dissatisfac-

 its hope to become strong enough to face
 its major adversary, the Soviet Union.
 Hence, the PRC began to demonstrate
 greater flexibility on Taiwan.
 The PRC began to speak of "reunifi-
 cation," rather than "liberation" regard-
 ing-Taiwan. Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-
 ping and other Chinese leaders said that
 after reunification Taiwan would be al-
 lowed to retain its higher living stand-
 ards, its economic and social system, and
 even its armed forces. Declatory policies
 can change, of course, but nonetheless,-
 these are encouraging signs.
 Events moved rapidly late in 1978, and
 on December 15, President Carter an-
 nounced that the United States would
 recognize the PRC and withdraw recog-
 nition from the Republic of China on
 January 1, 1979. Unfortunately, during
 the negotiations the administration, from
 my perspective, and I believe that of
 many other Members, made no effort to
 obtain a PRC pledge not to use force
 against Taiwan. It apparently believed
 that  no  Chinese  Government  could
 pledge itself not to use force against what
 it claimed was one of its own provinces.
 Yet, the administration states that it has
 made clear to the PRC that U.S. recog-
 nition was based upon the expectation
 that the issue would be resolved peace-
 fully. The United States also insisted
 that the Mutual Security Treaty not be
 abruptly abrogated, as the PRC had pre-
 viously demanded, but ? by being ter-
 minated after 1 year's notice as fully
 provided for in the treaty itself.
 Finally, the United States insisted
 that it would continue to sell selected
 defensive arms to Taiwan after normal-
 ization of relations with the PRC, al-
 though it would agree not to make any
 new sales during 1979. The PRC ob-
 jected to such arms sales, but agreed to
 normalization despite the U.S. position.
 On the basis of these understandings,
 the United States agreed to the PRC's
 original three conditions.

 and foreign trade continued to expand
 rapidly-tripling, as a matter of fact.
 More native Taiwanese were brought
 into important government positions by
 the mainlanders who control the island,
 -and the two groups have drawn closer
 together in the face of a common dan-
 ger. The United States continued to pro-
 vide arms to Taiwan, and its military
 capabilities remain sufficient to defend
 itself against any foreseen PRC threat.
 Yet the December 1978 decision of the
 United States to shift diplomatic rec-
 ognition from the Republic of China to
 the People's Republic of China created
 anger and anxiety on Taiwan. Taiwan
 had long feared and expected such
 moves, but their impact was made more
 severe by the failure of the Administra-
 tion to consult a long-time ally-or even
 to inform it of the impending change
 until the last moment. Nonetheless, Tai-
 wan has once again demonstrated its
 fortitude and its resilience. Economic
 activity continues at a fast pace, and
 despite their worries the people on Tai-
 wan are adapting to their new situation.
 American interests and our moral ob-
 ligation demand that we assist Taiwan
 in adapting to these changed conditions.
 Our trade with Taiwan was $7.2 billion
 in 1978, and is expected to reach $9-10
 billion in 1979. We should make sure
 that trade can continue to grow. We
 have more than $500 million in direct
 private investments in Taiwan, $3 bil-
 lion in loans from U.S. private institu-
 tions, and almost $2 billion from the
 Export-Import Bank. The island's con-
 tinued access to both public and private
 American capital should therefore be
 assured. Taiwan is one of the few places
 in the world which has undergone rapid
 .economic growth while reducing income
 disparities. Such a rare achievement
 should be encouraged by our policies.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield at that point?
 Mr. GLENN. Yes.
 In considering this legislation, the
 committee heard a balanced and large
 number of witnesses. These included
 administration witnesses, such as the
 Secretary of Defense and the Deputy
 Secretary of State, a number of Mem-
 bers of the Senate, and public witnesses
 representing a wide variety of views. We
 also heard testimony in executive ses-
 sion dealing with Taiwan's security from
 the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff and other senior Defense Depart-
 ment officials. We also consulted many
 specialists in the fields of trade, banking
 and law. Their assistance was invaluable
 to us in dealing with the unique situa-
 tion we faced.
 When the administration recognized
 the People's Republic of China as the
 sole legal government of China, it also
 acknowledged the Chinese position that
 Taiwan is a part of China. However, the
 United States has not itself agreed to
 the PRC position, nor has the United
 States contested it. Neither the bill sub-
 mitted by the administration nor the
 amended bill as approved by the com-
 mittee takes a position on the extremely
 complex issue of Taiwan's status under
 international law. No such determina-
 tion is necessary. For the bill treats
 Taiwan as a country for purposes of
 U.S. domestic law. It is based on the view
 that any benefits the United States de-
 cides to confer on Taiwan by statute can
 be conferred without regard to Taiwan's
 international legal identity. The com-
 mittee consulted several eminent legal
 scholars, and they supported this view.
 Thus the bill sets forth the specific man-
 ner in which relations between the
 United States and Taiwan will be main-
 tained.
 The bill submitted by the administra-
 tion provides for U.S. relations with the
 people  on Taiwan to be conducted

 funded by the U.S. Government and

 ators and their staff. However, I do want
 to point out those changes that involve
 major policy issues.
 One central difference between the bill
 submitted by the administration and the
 bill approved by the copnmlttee concerns
 the matter of specificity. Many matters
 in the administration's bill were dealt
 with implicity or in very general terms-
 if they were dealt with at all. The ad-
 ministration apparently believed that
 the intent of the various sections of the
 bill was clear enough so that a combina-
 tion of administrative regulations and
 court decisions would provide an ade-
 quate framework for continued relations
 with Taiwan. The committee regarded
 such an approach as risky at best. Trade
 and investment do not flourish in an
 unknown and unpredictable environ-
 ment. Billions of dollars in trade and
 financial assets are involved, and the
 laws that govern commercial activity
 between the United States and Taiwan
 must be clear.
 Likewise, legal issues must be recog-
 nized and dealt with to insure minimal
 disruption. The committee was con-
 vinced that a definition of the phrase
 "the people on Taiwan" which appears
 throughout the bill was required. One was
 added, and the meaning of the phrase as
 defined includes the governing authority
 as well as the people governed by it. The
 continued validity of treaties and other
 international agreements made while
 the United States still had diplomatic
 relations with the Republic of China
 was thus affirmed. Matters involving the
 legal standing of the people on Taiwan
 to sue and be sued in U.S. courts, and
 the protection of the property rights of
 organizations and persons in both coun-
 tries were dealt with through other
 amendments.
 The bill as amended authorizes the
 President, on a reciprocal basis, to ex-
 tend extensive privileges and immunities
 to the appropriate members of the orga-
 nization established by the people on
 Taiwan to conduct their relations with
 the United States. The premises and
 organization itself will be accorded the
 same-privileges and immunities as are
 accorded to foreign missions, and the
 privileges and immunities accorded the
 employers will be complete for all actions
 taken in the performance of their duties,
 but will not be as absolute as those
 granted diplomats. Anything less would
 seriously limit the effectiveness of the
 instrumentality. Anything more would
 have involved treating it as if it were
 an official government organization.

 (2) to make clear that the United States'
 decision to establish diplomatic relations
 with the People's Republic of China rests on
 the expectation that any resolution of the
 Taiwan issue will be by peaceful means;
 (3) to consider any effort to resolve the
 Taiwan issue by other than peaceful means
 a threat to the peace and security of the
 Western Pacific area and of grave concern
 to the United States; and
 (4) to provide the people on Taiwan with
 arms of a defensive character.
 (b) In order to achieve the objectives of
 this section-
 (1)  the United States will maintain its
 capacity to resist any resort to force or other
 forms of coercion that would jeopardize the
 security, or the social or economic system,
 of the people on Taiwan;
 (2) the United States will assist the peo-
 ple on Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-
 defense capability through the provison of
 arms of a defensive character;
 (3) the President is directed to inform the
 Congress promptly of any threat to the se-
 curity of Taiwan and any danger to the in-
 terests of the United States arising there-
 from; and
 (4) the United States will act to meet any
 danger described in paragraph (3) of this
 subsection in accordance with constitutional
 processes and procedures established by law.
 I want to make several point about
 this section of the bill, and the problem
 it is designed to deal with. First, the pro-
 visions should be read as a unit in order
 to be aware of their full force. Second,
 there were members of the committee
 who would have liked somewhat different
 language, on one point or another, but
 the committee believed it was important
 to have as broad a consensus as possible
 on this central issue. The same is true
 regarding the Senate as a whole. I believe
 that both China and Taiwan will be more
 impressed with a statement that has ex-
 tensive support, rather than one that is
 approved by a small majority.
 Finally, we must keep in mind the ac-
 tual military balance in the area today,
 which is likely to prevail some years
 hence. The military forces on Taiwan are
 well-equipped, well-trained, and strongly
 motivated.  U.S.  sales  of  defensive
 arms can assure that these capabilities
 remain intact. The PRC has no amphibi-
 ous capacity, nor is it moving to develop
 one, and such developments would be de-
 tectable well before any invasion could
 be mounted. It has a major adversary on
 its northern frontier, and it has recently
 acquired a small but powerful enemy on
 its southern border. In these circum-
 stances its ability and inclination to move
 militarily against Taiwan will be quite
 limited.
 But in this section of the bill, we have
 also addressed external coercion directed
 against the island's economic or social
 system. Thus' the United States will
 maintain its capacity to resist any boy-
 cotts or blockades directed? against Tai-
 wan.
 In conclusion, the committee has ex-
 pr,essed in strong terms the U.S. interest
 in the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan
 issue.
 The committee believes that the pro-
 visions we have added to the bill will
 reassure Taiwan without undermining
 the new relationship between the United
 States and the People's Republic of
 China. Based upon this conviction, we
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE           . March 7, 1979
 urge the Senate to approve this bill.
 Prompt passage will provide the con-
 tinuity crucial in existing laws, treaties,
 and agreements.
 Indeed, rapid passage is crucial for an
 additional reason-by passing a congres-
 sionally refined bill, we can symbolically
 manifest the American commitment to
 old friends and reassure our allies in
 East Asia.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, on Mon-
 ? day, I laid out what I consider to be
 the background against which we legis-
 late in terms of the security of the area
 and the relationship of that security to
 the security of the United States. Sen-
 ator GLENN has, in my judgment, very
 accurately developed exactly what the'
 committee did and why it did it. I shall
 not endeavor to retrace that ground, ex-
 cept to say that I have sought personally,
 based upon my own professional abilities,
 to examine with care all elements of this
 particular bill in order to see that it
 would do what we wish it to do; to wit,
 within the limitations allowed to us by
 diplomatic practice, to continue the same
 relations in every respect with Taiwan
 and the people of Taiwan as we had be-
 fore, save only formal diplomatic recog-
 nition of Taiwan that we had up until
 the time that we terminated this recog-
 nition and terminated the mutual secu-
 rity agreement. This mutual security
 agreement, by the way, will run through-
 out this year, which none of us should
 forget.
 I was especially concerned with the
 legal questions which related to the lat-
 ter-that is, the termination of the mu-
 tual security agreement which we had
 with Taiwan. I know that that subject
 is being litigated. It is my professional
 judgment that this is a proper course
 and that, in the absence of any con-
 trary action by the Congress, the Presi-
 dent is the only authority which can ac-
 tually terminate that agreement. How-
 ever, it is far from an open and shut
 proposition.
 In subsequent colloquy which I shall
 have with Senator GOLDWATER, I expect
 to make clear that there is absolutely
 nothing in this legislation which, in any
 way, prejudices, one way or another, the
 claim which is being made in our courts
 that the President does not have this
 authority. My opinion was solely direct-
 ed to the fact that, in my judgment, the
 committee could and should proceed to
 report out favorably this piece of legis-
 lation-which is, of course, based upon
 the theory that the mutual security
 agreement will be terminated according
 to its terms as of the end of this year.
 That concept does not, in any way,
 change, affect, or invalidate any chal-
 lenge to the President's authority.
 Second, I have spent a good deal of
 time, as is pretty well known, trying to
 deal with the security situation on Tai-
 wan. Whatever may be the great politi-
 cal and historic consequences of our ac-
 tions in respect of the recognition of the
 People's Republic of China, like, I think,
 practically every other Member of this
 body, I have the deep conviction that we
 ought to do nothing in this matter which
 would expose the economic and social
 system new existing on Taiwan to .being
 eliminated by force, directly or indirect-
 ly, or otherwise suppressed or suffocated
 by the action of the People's Republic of
 China. I believe in the essentiality of this
 protection to the people on Taiwan-and
 now I use that term not only as it is
 used in the statute but in its literal
 sense-who have established the second
 highest standard of living on the conti-
 nent of Asia. They are a shining exam-
 ple of what can be done economically in
 the Asian complex, notwithstanding the
 traditional poverty which has surround-
 ed hundreds of millions of people in
 Asia, including the hundreds of millions
 in the People's Republic of China.
 I believe that the provision which we
 have now agreed upon-and I emphasize
 that phrase, "agreed upon," because I.
 intend to stand by it, notwithstanding
 that it may use in some respects some
 other words than those I originally
 drafted-must have enough balance to
 have a broad consensus and willing par-
 ticipants, including those who will carry
 this out among the executive branch of
 the United States. I do not believe that
 any change whatever has been made in
 the substance of this security provision
 by what has been changed between the
 amendment's original submission and
 the amendment as finally agreed upon.
 The only real change, Mr. President,
 occurs at page 14, lines 7 to 10, in section
 114(a) (3). The words in question are as
 follows :
 consider any effort to resolve the Taiwan is-
 sue by other than peaceful means a threat
 to the peace and security of the Western
 Pacific area and of grave concern to the
 United States.
 When I wrote my amendment, I had
 in mind the security interest of the
 United States as to that particular
 phrase. Mr. President, it was felt that
 that may be committing the United
 States in advance to a far broader reac-
 tive position than it should have in a
 very long-term commitment of this kind,
 considering my own War Powers Resolu-
 tion and the normal stance we take re-
 specting our "constitutional processes"
 provision -in every U.S. mutual defense
 treaty, including the NATO treaty. We
 couple that with the fact that we state
 very clearly that we would consider such
 a breach of the condition on which we
 established diplomatic relations with the
 People's Republic. That is contained in
 this same section, paragraph 2 of section
 114(a). We expected that any resolution
 will be only by peaceful means. We
 couple that with the commitment to
 supply arms to the people on Taiwan,
 and we couple it with the finding that a
 threat to the peace and security of the
 Western Pacific area will be involved.
 I do not think there is any question
 about the fact that that actually repre-
 sents a very serious threat to the secu-
 rity of the United States. We couple it
 with our commitment to maintain our
 capacity to resist any resort to force, et
 cetera, should it be tried against the peo-
 ple on Taiwan-not only force but coer-
 cion that would jeopardize the security
 or the social or economic system of the
 people on Taiwan; and that we will
 assist them to maintain a sufficient self-

 defense capability through the provi-
 sion of arms.
 It seems to me, Mr. President, that we
 have really locked this in as well as any
 nation ,can lock it in without assuming
 postures which would truly sound bellig-
 erent. Therefore, I concurred in what I
 really  consider  to  be  very  modest
 changes. I hope that the Senate will sus-
 tain us in this effort to attain a broad
 consensus. At the same time, we say
 everything that we ought to on our
 determination to protect the security
 and the integrity of Taiwan from the use
 of force, direct or indirect, or the use of
 coercion, or what, in any other way, will
 suppress its economic and social system.
 Finally, Mr. President, I believe this
 bill serves the high objectives which we
 have set for ourselves in respect of Tai-
 wan, as well as the high objectives which
 we have set for ourselves in respect of the
 People's Republic of China.
 It is a fact that the People's Republic
 Invaded Vietnam, which we thoroughly
 disapprove of, notwithstanding the fact
 that only a brief time before, we had
 agreed to recognition.
 So it is very important to restate what
 is recognition; recognition is to take a
 nation with all its warts as well as with
 all its virtue and to regularize and nor-
 malize our contacts.
 Just think, Mr. President, if we with-
 drew our ambassadors from Moscow
 every time the Soviet Union did some-
 thing we really did not like, or something
 which was inimical or harmful to the
 United States, those ambassadors would
 be yo-yos. They would be coming back
 and forth about every Wednesday.
 So that cannot be our criteria. We can
 disapprove thoroughly of what the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China may do. There
 may be a day when we will prefer to
 withdraw our ambassador and protest.
 That is our privilege, just as it is theirs.
 But that does not, in my opinion, change
 the necessity for a decision which regu-
 larizes our contacts and gives us the best
 means-I  emphasize  that,  the  best
 means-for maintaining a peaceful rela-
 tion with the most populous nation on.
 Earth and one which we all know is des-
 tined to be the third of the superpowers
 on this Earth.
 So I believe that while it is an act
 which we protest and regret and could
 tgce whatever posture we wanted, we are
 not in any way inhibited from recogni-
 tion. It should not be considered some
 argument why we should not have rec-
 ognized the People's Republic.
 On the contrary, the fact that the
 People's Republic felt free to take this
 overt and hostile action in that area of
 the world is exactly the reason why we
 should try to have as much opening into
 that society as we can, considering its
 secrecy, in order to know in advance
 what are the movements, governmental
 or social or political, which are going on
 in that country, which is one of the pur-
 poses of having an ambassador and an
 embassy there.
 So, Mr. President, I believe that this
 is the right way to do what is right for
 our country. I hope the Senate will ap-
 prove this bill as we have submitted it.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Will the Senator
 yield for a question?
 Mr. JAVITS. Of course.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. President, if
 the senior Senator from New York (Mr.
 JAVITS)  would give me his attention, I
 would like to raise with him a mattter
 that he and I have discussed previously.
 As the Senator, who is the ranking mi-
 nority member of the committee, knows,
 I have filed a lawsuit, with 25 other
 Members of Congress, seeking to obtain
 a court determination of the legality of
 President Carter's attempted unilateral
 termination by notice of the Mutual De-
 fense Treaty with the Republic of China.
 It was, my understanding that the com-
 mittee did not address the merits of he
 legal question in the bill, which is now
 pending before us, but was willing to see
 what happened to the lawsuit before de-
 ciding whether or not to resolve it by
 legislation.
 If that is what the committee in-
 tended, then that is fine with me. But I
 am disturbed at certain statements made
 in the committee report at pages 18 and
 19, as they may relate to section 104 of
 the bill. The report seems to be of/two
 minds on the issue.
 First, at the top 'of page 18, it states
 that the answer "is unclear." This seems
 to support the willingness of the com-
 mittee to allow the question of law to be
 answered in the courts.'
 But, then the report goes on to discuss
 the legal issue and states at page 19 that
 it appears the constitutional prerogatives
 of the Congress and the Senate have not
 been invaded.
 Now, this second statement contra-
 dicts the first one, and may have a bear-
 ing on what interpretation is given to
 section 104 of the bill. -
 Section 104 provides that all treaties
 entered into between the United States
 and the government we formerly recog-
 nized officially as the Republic of China
 shall continue in force, "unless and until
 terminated in accordance with law."
 On its face, the provision does not take
 any position as to whether President
 Carter's unilateral action in giving notice
 to the Republic'of China is, or is not, in
 accordance with law. The section appears
 completely neutral on this issue.
 But in view of the statement gratui-
 tously inserted in the committee report
 at page 19, it is conceivable a wrong in-
 terpretation may be given to section 104
 that does not appear in the text of the
 provision itself. Therefore, I seek to have
 some assurance from members of the
 committee that the provision does not
 mean something it does not say.
 All I ask for is fairness: An opportu-
 nity to ask the court to say what the law
 is-under the Constitution and under the
 defense treaty. So long as the committee
 can assure me that nothing in the pend-
 ing bill is to be construed as either ap-
 proving or disapproving of the legality of
 President Carter's action regarding the
 defense treaty, I believe that will pro-
 tect my right, and the rights of the many
 other Members of Congress who have
 joined me, to pursue this matter in the
 courts.
 As the Senator from New York knows,
 he very graciously agreed to discuss this
 with me and make any clarifications he
 might be able to.
 52125
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, it is my
 judgment, and I sat through all the ses-
 sions of the committee, that the com-
 mittee did not intend to approve or dis-
 approve of the legality of President Car-
 ter's action.
 The reason for the statements in the
 report which the Senator considers "in-
 consistent" is the fact that the committee
 had to consider not just whether this
 statute would affect the President's pow-
 er; we could have passed on the Presi-
 dent's power in it; we could have said
 that we confirm the President's power to
 terminate the agreement with the Re-
 public of China on Taiwan.
 We said no such thing. That was be-
 cause, as I just answered, we did not
 intend to affect that. Therefore, we said
 at page 18:
 Although the Committee thus recognizes
 that any firm conclusion is impossible, it
 inclines to the belief that the President has
 not, in giving notice of termination pursuant
 to the Treaty itself, exceeded his constitu-
 tional authority.
 We had to say that for the second rea-
 son, which was our question, should we
 pass this at all; are we engaging in a
 vain act? If we believed that the Presi-
 -dent had no authority and could not give
 notice of termination of the treaty, then
 what are we doing confirming Woodcock
 as ambassador? What are we doing mao-
 iiig Taiwan a new and unique entity in-
 stead of the. government it was that we
 dealt with for 30 years?
 We had no business doing anything.
 So what we said in effect is, we do not
 want to effect any challenge to his power
 in the courts. That goes on.
 The answer is unclear as to that. We
 will hear from the courts. They may take
 jurisdiction, they may not. They may
 pass on the question, they may not.
 But we consider there is enough to
 the President's authority in this regard,
 so we ought to go ahead and confirm
 Woodcock and pass this law.
 The courts have overridden us many
 times before and the court may say, "We
 are sorry, Mr. Congress, you thought you
 were doing something for which a condi-
 tion precedent had been fulfilled; we are
 sorry to tell you it has not, and we will
 have to worry about that and do some-
 thing about it."
 So we were not in any way trying to
 foreclose the Senator's challenge, nor do
 the words of the statute foreclose him by
 changing in any way the constitutional
 authority of the President, whatever it
 may be.
 But we give enough credence to the
 fact that we think what he is doing is
 probably OK, so that we should go ahead
 and pass this law and confirm Woodcock,
 and we are not going through some sham
 or charade.
 That is the whole story.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I thank the Sena-
 tor from New York very much for that
 clarification.
 I now intend to vote for this, because
 I think it is a vast improvement.
 As I mentioned to the Senator from
 Ohio this morning, if the court happens
 to take this under consideration and de-
 cides in my favor, I do not think it will
 have any bearing on the recognition of
 the People's Republic of China. We will

 do anyway.
 0 Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I agree
 with the distinguished Senator from
 Arizona in his belief that we should clear
 up any ambiguity that may result from
 either the committee report on S. 245 or
 section 104 of the act with regard to the
 President's unilateral termination of the
 Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan.
 It is important, Mr. President, because
 the Senator has a lawsuit pending in
 Federal court which challenges the au-
 thority to terminate treaties without the
 consent of the Senate or the approval
 of the Congress.                   .
 It is the view of this Senator, as a
 member of the committee, that it was
 not the intent of the committee to pre-
 judge or prejudice the outcome of a law-
 suit pending in Federal court.
 More to the point, ' the question of
 whether the President was acting within
 his authority in the termination of the
 treaty was not before the committee,
 was not considered by the committee,
 and neither the report nor the act should
 be construed as a committee position on
 the question.o
 O Mr. HAYAKAWA. Mr. President, as a
 member of the Foreign Relations Com
 mittee who attended most of the markup
 sessions, I wish to clarify that in acting
 on the bill, the committee did not take
 any position on the legal question of
 whether the President may, without the
 advice and consent of the Senate or the
 approval pf the Congress, terminate the
 Mutual Defense Treaty with the Re-
 public of China.
 - It is my view that the committee did
 not take up that issue. Nothing in the
 committee report or the bill itself may
 be construed as approving or disapprov-
 ing of President Carter's action.
 Mr. President, I know the Senator
 from Arizona has filed a lawsuit in Fed-
 eral court seeking to obtain a judicial
 decision on the legal question involving
 termination of the defense treaty. In
 fairness to my colleague, I believe his
 right to pursue the case should be pro-
 tected.
 Accordingly I will repeat that nothing
 in the report or the bill shall be con-
 strued as either ratifying or disapprov-
 ing of President Carter's action in giv-
 ing notice to the Republic of China that
 the treaty will expire, without joint ac-
 tion by the Senate or Congress.O
 (The following colloquy occurred later
 in the proceedings and is printed at this
 point by unanimous consent.)
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I would
 like to go back to a colloquy earlier to-
 day between the distinguished senior
 Senator from New York (Mr. JAVITS)
 and the distinguished senior Senator
 from Arizona  (Mr.  GOLDWATER)  with
 reference to the intent of the Commit-
 tee on Foreign Relations with respect to
 the suit brought by Senator GOLDWATER
 and the Senator from North Carolina
 and others on the question, on the con-
 stitutional question, of the President's
 abrogation of treaties.
 I confess that prior to this colloquy I
 was most surprised and concerned to
 read in the committee report on page 19
 D - SENATE
 that the committee had concluded that
 the constitutional prerogatives of the
 Congress and the Senate had not been
 invaded by the unilateral action of Presi-
 dent Carter in giving notice of the abro-
 gation of the Mutual Defense Treaty with
 the Republic of China.
 Now, I realize that this is an issue on
 which reasonable men can differ. As I
 said earlier, I am a coplaintiff with the
 distinguished Senator from Arizona in a
 lawsuit to establish-this precise point of
 law.
 I recall further that this issue was
 raised in committee. But to the recollec-
 tion of this Senator, I want the record to
 show that no conclusion was reached by
 the committee, no resolution was offered
 on the subject, and no vote was taken
 and, therefore, I was concerned to read
 on page 19, and I quote:
 It appears to the Committee, therefore, that
 the constitutional prerogatives of the Con-
 gress and the Senate have not been invaded
 in that neither the Congress nor the Senate
 has elected to exercise the powers granted it
 by the Constitution to participate, in the
 process of treaty termination. Had either
 done so, a different conclusion would likely
 obtain.
 Mr. President, I note further that this
 statement, indeed, the whole committee
 report, was not circulated among com-
 mittee members before printing. At least
 it was not circulated to this Senator.
 In my opinion, the observations I have
 just quoted have no status as a report
 or a conclusion of the committee but con-
 stitute only staff observations. Other
 members of the committee have the right
 to endorse them if they choose to do so.
 But it appears to this Senator that it is
 inappropriate for the committee to in-
 vade with premature conclusions a field
 that is the subject of controversy before
 the courts by a substantial number of
 our colleagues.
 As I understand the comments of the
 distinguished Senator from New York,
 this was the position he took in his state-
 ment to Senator GOLDWATER, and I ask
 him now if that is not essentially correct.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
 Senator repeat the position that he feels
 I took? I was listening to my assistant.
 Mr. HELMS. Yes. As I understood the
 Senator's comment to Senator GOLD-
 WATER, nothing done or said by the com-
 mittee had any intent to affect one way
 or another the suit brought by Senator
 GOLDWATER and others.
 Mr. JAVITS. That is what I said, and
 that is what I mean.
 I also said the committee had another
 question, to which the Senator has also
 addressed himself, and that is, would it
 legislate in this field at all, and obviously
 if the committee challenged the right of
 the President to abrogate, then it would
 not have dealt with this legislation, and
 that was discussed, Senator. The tran-
 script of the committee will show that
 because I remember speaking to it my-
 self. I said, and I think I will refresh the
 Senator, it does not affect the suit, and
 it does not in any way modify what I
 said before. That stands.
 But the other question is I, as a Sen-
 ator and a lawyer, had to decide if I
 March 7, 1979
 wanted to legislate at all, because, if the
 President has no right to terminate this
 agreement, then why do we need this
 section that I had so much anguish over
 in writing to protect the people on
 Taiwan?
 For myself, I concluded that I believed
 that under the circumstances he did have
 the right to terminate, and therefore
 that I was willing, to legislate. That was
 discussed openly. I said that myself, as a
 matter of fact. I said I had trouble over
 the question of taking jurisdiction, be-
 cause the courts have so often said they
 would not decide such matters. I am sure
 I said that.
 I did not read the draft, but I am sure
 the minority staff director did, and knew
 my views, so I make no complaint about
 it. But I felt that adequate discussion
 within the committee, by me and others,
 confirmed that they were willing to act
 on the legislation because they did not
 feel that there was a bar to terminating.
 But in no way do I change or dilute my
 fundamental statement, to wit, that there
 is no effect on the Senator's litigation by
 what the committee did.
 Mr. HELMS. Well, . Mr. President, of
 course the Taiwan Enabling Act has
 nothing whatsoever to do with the
 mutual defense treaty and its abrogation
 by the President. And even if the Presi-
 dent is right, the treaty continues in
 force for a year, as the 'distinguished
 Senator knows, whether or not this bill
 becomes law. The bill turns upon the
 rupture in diplomatic relations. The In-
 stitute is to take the place of the U.S.
 Embassy. So whether or not the Senate
 acts on this bill is irrelevant to the treaty
 issue.
 I am sure my friend from New York
 is aware that other Senators have the
 same concern that I have just expressed.
 I have here a letter written to the dis-
 tinguished  chairman of the Foreign
 Relations Committee by the junior Sena-
 tor from Florida. (Mr. STONE). It is an
 eloquent and very interesting letter, ex-
 pressing very clearly his concerns, which
 are identical to my own. The distinguish-
 ed Senator has kindly consented to have
 me put his letter in the RECORD, which I
 will do at. this time.
 Mr.  President,  I  ask  unaniimous
 consent that Senator STONE's letter be
 printed in the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection,' the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 tee, Dirksen Senate Office Building.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN:  I am writing to ex-
 press my deep concern and strong objections
 to certain language in the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee Report on S. 245. Beginning
 on page 17 and continuing for several pages
 thereafter, there is a discussion of "legal
 issues" relating to the termination of the
 Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic
 of China and other legal issues regarding
 the Republic of China. On page 19, in con-
 nection with a discussion of the termina-
 tion of the Mutual Defense Treaty, a Para
 graph is included which reads,
 "It appears to the Committee, therefore,
 that the Constitutional prerogatives of the
 Congress and the Senate have not been in-

 vaded in that neither the Congress nor the
 Senate has elected to exercise the powers
 granted it by the Constitution to partici-
 pate in the process of treaty termination. Had
 either done so, a different conclusion would
 likely obtain."
 I do not believe it was the intention of the
 Committee and certainly it was not author-
 ized by the Committee, to take a position
 as to whether the President's manner of
 terminating the Mutual Defense Treaty in-
 vaded the prerogatives of the Congress or
 not. While there was discussion during the
 course of the Committee's hearings, I am
 not aware of an attempt 'by any member of
 the Committee urging the Committee to take
 a position such as described by this para-
 graph.
 I am particularly concerned about the im-
 plications which this paragraph may have for
 future decisions in the foreign policy area by
 the Executive Branch. It expresses the no-
 tion that when Congress, for whatever rea-
 son, chooses not to exercise certain Consti-
 tutional powers, that Congress has endorsed
 a particular Constitutional theory. I strongly
 disagree with any such theory of Consti-
 tutional interpretation. Finally, I am con-
 cerned about the inclusion of this paragraph
 inasmuch as Committee members were not
 given any opportunity to review the report
 before it was filed. Where it is necessay for
 the Committee and Senate to move as quick-
 ly as possible on important legislation such
 as this, I believe it is particularly important
 that the Committee report language be as
 carefully developed as possible and limited
 as much as possible to an explanation of the
 bill which the Committee has agreed to
 report.
 I would appreciate your consideration of
 appropriate stelis to eliminate the para-
 graph to which I have referred, from the
 Committee report, or to have a statement by
 the managers of the bill which would cor-
 rect the gross misimpression. which I believe
 will result if this language is incorporated
 in the Committee Report.
 Warm personal regards.
 Most cordially,
 RICHARD "DICK" STONE.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on Decem-
 ber 22, 1978, our distinguished colleague
 from Arizona, Senator GOLDWATER, filed
 a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for
 the District of Columbia challenging the
 constitutional  authority  of President
 Carter to terminate this country's Mutual
 Defense Treaty with the Government of
 Taiwan. The suit asks the court to
 declare the President's unilateral action
 "unconstitutional and illegal," and "to
 set aside his purported notice to cancel
 the treaty as having no effect."
 ,in an article published in the Febru-
 ary 1979 issue of the American Bar As-
 sociation Journal, Senator  GOLDWATER
 perceptively defines the court role of the
 Senate in foreign policy. He outlines the
 arguments for his position that the
 power to terminate a,treaty-such as the
 Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan-
 does not rest with the President alone,
 but rather is a power to be exercised
 jointly by the executive and legislative
 branches of Government. The article
 strongly supports the contention that the
 President's unprecedented claim of un-
 checked power ought not be upheld in
 light of historical and legal precedent.
 Mr. President, allow me to quote two
 ey paragraphs from the distinguished
 In 1858 the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 ittee had unequivocally found that lan-
 will of the treaty-making power," which it
 defined as "the President and Senate" The
 Senate, together with the President and often
 with the House of Representatives, had par-
 ticipated in the termination of nearly 40
 treaties by 1955, virtually all of which con-
 tained duration provisions similar to Article
 X of the R. O. C. defense treaty. From this,
 if any understanding could be attributed to
 the Senate when the treaty, was ratified, it
 was that the term "party" meant the Presi-
 dent and Senate jointly
 But the State Department would not only
 attribute a meaning to the R. O. C. defense
 treaty of which it never informed the Sen-
 ate. It would put the same meaning on dozens
 of other major treaties that contain similar
 provisions. For example, the North Atlantic
 Treaty Alliance and our security pacts with
 South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines in-
 clude articles allowing either "party" to with-
 draw after one year's notice. The Nuclear
 Test Ban Treaty, the Statute of the Inter-
 national Atomic Energy Agency, the Nuclear
 Nonproliferation Treaty, the Biological Weap-
 ons Convention, the Universal Copyright
 Convention, and the Outer Space Treaty,
 among others, each provide by their own
 terms for termination after one year's or less
 notice to the other parties. The consequences
 of accepting the State Department's inter=
 pretation of these provisions is far reaching
 indeed.
 I wish to commend the senior Senator
 from Arizona for his leadership in chal-
 lenging the attempted usurpation of con-
 gressional power by the President. His
 article should be read by everyone who
 believes in the integrity of the constitu-
 tional doctrine of separation of powers.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the text of Senator GOLD'
 WATER'S article be printed in the RECORD
 at this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the REc-
 ORD, as follows:
 TREATY  TERMINATION  IS  A  SHARED  POWER
 (By BARRY M. GOLDWATER)
 On December 15, 1978, while the Congress
 was out of session, President Carter an-
 nounced that the United States would rec-
 ognize the People's Republic of China as the
 sole legal government of China as of Janu-
 ary 1, 1979. At the same time the president
 also made known, through informal briefings
 for the media his unilateral decision to ter-
 minate the defense treaty with the Republic
 of China, claiming authority to act udder
 Article X of that treaty, which states "either
 party," not "either president," may cancel
 it after giving one year's notice. Without
 public announcement, the actual notice of
 termination of the defense treaty was sent
 by diplomatic note to the Republic of China
 on December 23, 1978, to be effective on and
 as of January 1, 1979.
 The president's decisions were shrouded in
 secrecy and contrary to the purpose of Sec-
 tion 26 of the International Security As-
 sistance Act of 1978, a law enacted by Con-
 gress just three months preceeding his an-
 nouncement,  which  specifically  called  for
 prior consultation with   the legislative
 branch.
 On December 22 I filed suit in the United
 States District Court for the District of Co-
 lumbia, with 15 of my colleagues from both
 houses of Congress, challenging the validity
 of the president's attempted termination of
 the treaty without any supporting legisla-
 tive authority. We asked the court to declare
 the president's action unconstitutional and
 illegal and to set aside his purported notice
 to cancel the treaty as having no effect.
 It is the premise of our case that in act-
 to make a self-serving interpretation of the
 constitutional allotment of powers among
 the executive and legislative departments,
 President Carter has not only usurped pow-
 ers conferred on the Congress, but has at-
 tempted to exercise a function the Supreme
 Court has said is clearly reserved to the ju-
 dicial branch, the power "to say what the
 law is." United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683
 (1974).
 The question is not whether any past
 precedents justify the president's 'assertion
 of independent power, although I believe the
 weight of historical evidence proves that
 treaties are normally terminated only with
 legislative approval. The true question is
 whether his action represents the original
 intent of the people who drafted the Con-
 stitution.
 This is a legal and historical question,
 and the hard fact is that nothing in the
 records of the federal convention or in the
 explanations at the state conventions on
 ratifying the Constitution confirm in any
 way the president's sweeping claim of un-
 checked power. To the contrary, contem-
 porary materials and the text of the Con-
 stitution show that the termination of a
 treaty, involving as it does the sacred honor
 of the country and serious policy interests,
 is a decision of such major importance that
 the framers required the joint participation
 of both political departments, the executive
 and legislative, in making that decision.
 if left unchallenged, the president's uni-
 lateral action will set a dangerous precedent
 that would enable him or a future president
 to terminate any defense treaty at will. In
 fact, the precedent could be used for the
 presidential termination of any treaty to
 which the United States may now be a party
 or become a party in the future-for in-
 stance, with Israel. This unchecked concen-
 tration of power is totally inimical to our
 democratic, representative form of govern-
 ment.
 However one may feel about the wisdom
 of independent presidential termination of
 the defense treaty as a step required to com-
 plete full normalization of relations with
 Peking, we each should remember the ad-
 monition of Chief Justice John Marshall:
 "The peculiar circumstances of the moment
 may render a measure more or less wise,
 but cannot render it more or less consti-
 tutional." In filing suit, it was my purpose
 to defend the legislative function conferred
 by the Constitution, not to contest the
 rightness or wrongness of his policies, which
 can be debated in other forums.
 The Constitution is silent as to how a
 treaty shall be terminated. It is also silent
 on how a statute or any other law shall be
 cancelled. Yet no one makes the argument
 that the president alone can repeal a statute.
 In fact, in The Confiscation Cases, 20 Wal. 92
 (1874), the Supreme Court expressly said that
 "no power was ever vested in the president to
 repeal an act of Congress."
 It is my belief that by placing treaties
 among "the supreme Law, of the Land" in
 Article VI, clause 2, and by requiring an Ar-
 ticle II, Section 3, that the president "shall
 take care that the Laws be faithfully exe-
 cuted,"  the framers  meant,  and expected
 without  saying  more,  that the  president
 would carry out a treaty in good faith. This
 is exactly the opposite of giving him an im-
 plied authority to cancel any treaty at will.
 It is also well known that the framers were
 concerned with restoring dependability to
 treaties made by the United States. They
 were anxious to gain the respect and confi-
 dence  of  foreign nations  by keeping  our
 treaty commitments.
 For example, in the preface to his notes
 on debates in the Constitutional Convention,
 James Madison singles out the lack of obedi-
 ence to treaties as one of the conditions the
 federal Constitution was intended to correct.
 Our  unfaithfulness  to  treaties,  Madison-

 wrote, is among "the defects, the, deformities,
 the diseases and the. ominous prospects for
 which the' Convention were to provide a
 remedy, and which ought never to be over-
 looked in expounding and appreciating, the
 Constitutional Charter. the remedy that was
 provided."
 In a similar vein, James Wilson, who signed
 the Constitution and sat on the first Supreme
 Court, lectured his law students that a coun-
 try "which violates. the. sacred faith of trea-
 ties, violates not only the voluntary, but also
 the  natural  and  necessary  law  of  na-
 tions... l' He added: "As the United States
 have surpassed others, even other common-
 wealths, in the excellence of their constitu-
 tion and government; it is reasonably to be
 hoped, that they will surpass them, like-
 wise in the stability of their laws, and in
 their fidelity to their engagements."
 Would the framers who regarded violation
 of "the sacred faith of treaties" as "wicked,"
 "dishonorable," and contrary to the best in-
 terests of the country in acquiring respect in
 the community of nations, have contradicted
 these purposes, by making it as easy under
 the new Constitution for a single officer
 of the government to repeal a treaty as it
 had been for individual states to nullify a
 treaty under the Articles. of Confederation?
 We should also remember the concern of
 the framers with sectional economic inter-
 ests. Many of them hoped for advantageous
 commercial treaties that would open up trade
 for their sections with other nations: The
 framers also had extensive discussions about
 treaties of peace as being included within
 the treaty clause, in recognition of the fact
 that those treaties would be the normal
 method of terminating a war. Without any
 supporting textual evidence to show it, it
 is inconceivable that the framers, assigned to
 one person power to denounce a commercial
 treaty that would be highly beneficial to the
 interests of a particular geographic region or
 a peace treaty that had formally concluded
 ca. war and whose faithful adherence would
 presumably advert the chance of resumption
 of hostilities, however slight that chance may
 be.. As. the language of the Constitution does
 not  distinguish  commercial  and  peace
 treaties from other treaties, such as a secu-
 rity pact, it is obvious that all treaties share
 the same protectvie ramor.
 JOINT PARTICIPATION NEEDED FOR ANY
 "GENUINELY CRITICAL DECISION"
 In his landmark work on the subject in
 5 Seton Hall Law Review 527' (1974):, Prof.
 Arthur Bestor persuasively, shows that the
 doctrine of separation of powers is "pre-
 scribed as explicitly for the conduct of for-
 eign relations as for the handling of domes-
 tic matters" and explains: "The purpose and
 effect of any such arrangement is to require
 the joint participation-the co-operation and
 concurrence-of the several branches in the
 making and carrying' out of any genuinely
 critical decision."
 Justice Joseph Story, one of the foremost
 scholars to sit on the Supreme Court, con-
 firms this statement. In his Commentaries on
 the Constitution, Story writes, in connection
 with the decision of the framers to allot the
 treaty authority jointly in the president and
 the. Senate, "his joint possession of the power
 affords a greater security for its just exercise,
 than the separate possession of it by either"
 and that it "is too much to expect, that a
 free people would confide to a single magis-
 trate, however respectable, the sole authority
 to act conclusively, as well as exclusively
 upon treaties."
 Story adds, in words having equal relevance
 to making or unmaking a treaty: "The check,
 which acts upon the mind from the consid-
 eration, that, what is done is but preliminary,
 and requires the assent of other independent
 minds to give it a legal conclusiveness, is a
 restraint which awakens caution, and com-
 pels to deliberation."
 This is what the, framers had in mind in
 establishing a system of checks and balances.
 They sought to protect' the security of the
 people by making the president and the Sen-
 ate, checks on each other in the exercise of
 the full treaty power. By providing for the
 added deliberation and attention to the sub-
 ject that would be required by vesting the
 full treaty power jointly with the president
 and at least one branch of the legislature, the
 security of the people would be far better
 protected than it, would be if the power were
 conferred on a single officer. The security that
 follows  caution  and - added  deliberation
 would be lost if no check had been put on
 the unmaking, of a treaty-
 Why the framers would want to offer the
 people security in the making of treaties, but
 not in their termination, is unexplained by
 those who argue this difference exists. I be-
 lieve there is. no difference and that the
 checks and balances called for in the separa-
 tion of powers is equally as applicable to the
 critical decision of casting aside our formal
 treaties with. other nations as it is in mak-
 ing those treaties originally.
 The. early,  authorities,  including  some
 among the Founding Fathers, saw the repeal
 of a treaty in. the same light as they saw
 the repeal. of a. statute. It would have been
 strange to hear anyone. argue that the presi-
 dent, by his sole authority, could terminate
 whatever treaty he wished, whenever he
 wished. James: Madison for one, believed
 that "the same authority, precisely," would
 be "exercised, in annulling as in making a
 treaty."  Thomas Jefferson,  when  he  was
 Washington's first secretary of state, wrote a
 report in which he reasoned that the same
 authority who possessed the power of making
 treaties consequently had the power of de-
 claring them dissolved. And, when he was
 vice president, Jefferson. compiled the first
 manual of rules of the Senate, in. which he
 wrote: "Treaties being declared equally with
 the laws of the United States; to be the su-
 preme law of the land', it is understood that
 an act of the legislature alone can declare
 them infringed and rescinded."
 Further evidence. that the framers linked
 the repeal of treaties to the repeal of statutes
 appears in. John Jay's brief analogy in
 The Federalist, Number 64: "They who make
 laws, may, without doubt, amend or repeal
 them, and. It will not be disputed that they
 who. make treaties, may alter or cancel
 .them..... .
 Justice Iredell,, who, served on the first
 Supreme Court;, shared the views of Madi-
 son and Jefferson as, to the legislative role
 in terminating treaties. In an opinion ac-
 companying: Ware, v.. Hylton, 3 Dall.  199
 (1796), he twice stated his belief that Con-
 gress alone has "authority under our govern-
 ment" of declaring a treaty terminated, even
 In. circumstances, where the other country
 has first violated it.
 Another authority who believed the leg-
 islature must act before a treaty is termi-
 nated                                                                     Is  James'  Buchanan.  In  writing
 about the anicipated cancellation of a com-
 mercial treaty' with Denmark                                                                        considered
 damaging to our exports, then Secretary of
 State Buchanan wrote that "an act must
 first pass Congress' to enable the president
 to give the required notice...." His official
 concession of the joint possession of power is
 especially noteworthy' since that treaty con-
 tained a provision similar to the one in the
 R.O.C. defense treaty so heavily relied on by
 President Carter.
 Each treaty authorizes termination after
 notice being given to the other party. How-
 ever,  Secretary  Buchanan  obviously  be-
 lieved the. sovereign authority who could
 make the decision to give notice was not the
 president alone, but the president together
 with the authority of a law enacted by
 Congress.
 When the United States finally cancelled
 the treaty with Denmark? it. was' accomplished
 by a Senate resolution of March. 3, 1855, pas-
 sed unanimously; which advised. and con-
 sented. to authorizing President. Pierce to give
 notice of its termination.-The president had
 requested. the' authority, thereby giving some
 indication. Of. his, belief that. the decision-
 making authority was' jointly possessed by
 him and the legislature;, or at least one
 branch of it,, and was not. vested in him alone.
 The incident led to an authoritative re-
 port by the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee in 1856. In response to public discus-
 sion over whether' the. Senate had acted prop-
 erly in authorizing, presidential action with-
 out the concurrence of the House of Repre-
 sentatives, the committee concluded that the
 Senate and president. jointly possessed col,-
 petence to) terminate a treaty "without the
 aid or  intervention of. legislation" by the
 other house:. Speaking. precisely to the same
 issue presented by Article: X of the R.O.C.
 defense treaty, the, committee decided that
 "where, the, right to terminate a treaty at
 discretion. is. reserved in the: treaty itself, such
 discretion resides in President and Senate."
 The, committee explained:.  "The  whole
 power to bind the government by treaty is
 vested in the president. and Senate, two thirds
 of the senators present concurring. The treaty
 in question was' created by, the will of the
 treaty making, power; and, it contained a res-
 ervation. by which that, will should be revoked
 or its, exercise cease on a'. stipulated notice.
 It is thus the will, of the. treaty-making power
 which is; the subject, of revocation, and it fol-
 lows that the revocation is. incident to the
 will." Thus,, the, committee. clearly took a
 position at odds with the novel theory as-
 serted by President. Carter today.
 LODGE  TFIOUGFIT' CONGRESS' COULD  DISAPPROVE
 TAFT'S NOTICE:
 Henry Cabot Lodge, when he was chair-
 man of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee in 19T'1',, also believed' the power of
 treaty termination was j'ofntiy possessed by
 the president and' legislature: In response to
 a question in the Senate whether notice,
 given Russia by, President Taft to terminate a
 commercial treaty because of Soviet viola-
 tions;, would be: l'egal' in the absence of con-
 gressional ratification, he replied, "Of course,
 Congress. can disapprove his action and then
 I take it, the notice fails...." Senator Lodge
 added' his opinion that the power to termi-
 nate that treaty by' notice; as' authorized in
 such a treaty the., Senate and the presiden
 represent the high contracting party."
 Lodge was. then acting as, floor manager
 of legislation. that did. ratify, the president's
 action, said his statements clearly express his
 interpretation  of  Lire  term  "contracting
 party," used in a treaty' provision, as meaning
 the Senate and president jointly.

 one of the leading authorities- on the Consti-

 Another official, admission of the necessity
 for legislative concurrence in the decision
 to provide notice in. circumstances in which
 a treaty itself authorizes' the giving of notice
 comes from an attorney general's opinion.

 not alone in giving notice. In fact, the lan-
 guage of the defense treaty differs in a sig-
 nificant way from the text of the related
 Formosa Resolution, which did specifically.
 authorize the president to cancel it. Thus,
 similar language was not used in the treaty.
 The Formosa Resolution and the defense
 treaty both came before the Senate at the
 same time. The treaty was first considered
 in committee concurrently with the resolu-
 tion in January, 1955.. The resolution was
 reported to the. Senate on January 28 and
 signed into law on. January 29. The treaty
 was reported. on February 8 and approved
 by the Senates an February 8.
 IF THE TREATY MEANT "PRESIDENT," WHY DID
 rr SAY "PARTY"?
 The Senate had each measure before it for
 immediate comparison. In this setting, it is
 striking that the Formosa Resolution, by its
 own language, expires "when the president
 shall determine that the peace and security
 of the area. is reasonably assured by interna-
 tional conditions created by action of the
 United Nations or otherwise, and shall so
 report to the Congress." The treaty, on the
 other hand, provides for termination on one
 year's notice by "either party."
 Why, if the treaty meant to authorize "the
 president" of either party to terminate it by
 giving notice, did it not say so? The Senate
 had before it language of the specific kind
 in the Formosa Resolution, which it could
 have substituted for Article X, if it meant to
 .approve  independent  presidential  action.
 When it advised and consented to a treaty
 containing an entirely different term, with-
 out any explanation in the papers sent to it
 by the executive branch or in its own hear-
 ings, report, or floor debate, indicating that
 the term meant something other than what
 it said ("party"), this is surely conclusive
 that it did not understand "party" to mean
 "president."
 In 1856 the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee had unequivocally found that lan-
 guage similar to Article X referred to "the
 will of the treaty-making power," which it
 defined as "the president and Senate." The
 Senate, together with the president and often
 with the House of Representatives, had par-
 ticipated in the termination of nearly 40
 treaties by 1955, virtually all of which con-
 tained duration provisions similar to Article
 X of the R.O.C. defense treaty. From this, if
 any understanding could be attributed to the
 Senate when the treaty was ratified, it was
 that the term "party" meant the president
 and Senate jointly.
 But the State Department would not only
 attribute a meaning to the R.O.C. defense
 treaty of which it never informed the Sen-
 ate. It would put the same meaning on dozens
 of other major treaties that contain similar
 provisions. For example, the North Atlantic
 Treaty Alliance and our security pacts with
 South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines in-
 clude articles allowing either "party" to
 withdraw after one year's. notice. The Nu-
 clear Test Ban Treaty, the Statute of the In-
 ternational Atomic Energy Agency, the Nu-
 clear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Biological
 Weapons Convention, the Universal Copy-
 right  Convention,  and  the  Outer  Space
 Treaty, among others, each provide by their
 own terms for termination after one year's
 or less notice to the other parties. The con-
 sequences of accepting the State Depart-
 ment's interpretation of these provisions is
 far-reaching indeed.
 No matter that the Senate was not clearly
 informed of what the language meant when
 hidden from public discussion. After having
 exploited the use of executive agreements to
 the point where the president can make vir-
 tually any treaty he wants by calling it a
 mere executive agreement, now the State
 Department is ready to usurp the power of
 unmaking treaties as well.
 Events in the year ahead may well deter-
 mine whether the executive succeeds or fails
 in this historic power-grab.
 Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent
 also that this colloquy between the Sena-
 tor from North Carolina and the Sena-
 tor from New York appear in the RECORD
 immediately following the colloquy be-
 tween the Senator from New York and
 the Senator from Arizona (Mr. GOLD-

 (Conclusion of later proceedings.)
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, will the
 ,Senator yield?
 Mr. JAVITS. I yield.
 Mr. GLENN. I concur completely with
 the recollection of Senator JAVITS as to
 the action taken by our committee, in
 this regard; because when this came up,
 we deliberately did not, try to deal with
 the constitutionality of the President's
 authority to deal with treaty situations
 or whether the. Senate should or should
 not have become involved in that issue.
 We separated that question from his
 specifically mandated authority on how
 to go about negating this relationship
 with Taiwan-so far as the old treaty
 was concerned.. He did adhere to the
 letter of how to, do that. He did not
 abrogate the treaty;. he went by the
 treaty provisions. We separated that is-
 sue from the constitutionality question
 that the distinguished Senator from Ari-
 zona has raised.
 So my recollection coincides with that
 of the Senator from New York. We did
 not attempt to deal with the court suit
 at all.

 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-

 Committee for  the  measure it has
 brought before the Senate.
 In my judgment, this measure will go
 a long way toward reducing the clear
 threat to the security of Taiwan caused
 by the precipitate action of the President
 in announcing his intention to break
 our defense treaty with the Republic of
 China.
 On balance; the pending legislation

 State Department unveils a doctrine it has                 fully to the presentation and comments
 of' the able seni'or' Senator from New
 York. (Mr: JAVrrs)' in discussing the
 pending l'egislation.. I- commend both of
 them and the committee for what they
 have brought before the Senate.
 It is a much better proposal than I
 had anticipated would be brought to the
 Senate: It mitigates some. of the con-
 cerns that the Senator from Virginia
 had on the opening day of Congress,
 dealing with' the issue of Taiwan and
 mainland China.
 Frankly, I favor establishing full dip-
 lomatic relations with. the People's Re-
 public of China. It is one of the great
 nations of the world; it has a population,...
 larger than that of any other country.
 It is important that our country and
 the People's Republic have contact, that
 there be a dialog between our countries.,
 So I look with favor upon the establish-
 ment of diplomatic relations..
 What I do not favor, however; is that
 -in bringing this about, the President of
 the United States threw overboard a
 longtime friend and ally. The Senator
 from Ohio (Mr.. GLENN), in his presen-
 _ tation, pointed out that the treaty of
 friendship between, the. United States and
 Taiwan was abrogated by the President
 without consultation with the other
 partner to that treaty, the Republic of
 China; that, in fact, the first the Re-
 public of China knew about the proposal
 to terminate the treaty was when it
 learned such fact, on television or over
 the radio. So, that aspect of it has con-
 cerned me a great. deal.
 The second aspect of'this action taken
 by the President late last year is much
 broader than the question of Taiwan.
 It seems to me that it. is important. to
 establish for the future whether a Presi-
 dent may unilaterally terminate a Mu-
 tual Defense Treaty with other nations.
 Our country has many such treaties.
 Some of them are extremely important,
 in the. view of the Senator from. Virginia,
 to the welfare. of the United States.
 I believe that a President alone does
 not have the authority to terminate such
 treaties. In the research that my staff
 has been able to do, no case has been
 found in which a major treaty with
 another nation, of a. defense nature,
 ever has, been. abrogated unilaterally by
 a President of the United States. There
 have been cases, of course, in which
 minor treaties have. been set aside ; there
 have been cases in which, with the out-
 break of war, the treaty became, ipso
 facto, nonexistent. However, so far as
 I can determine, this, is the first time
 that a treaty of this' consequence has
 been. set. aside by unilateral action of
 the executive, branch of Government.
 It occurs to, me,. Mr.. President, that
 before the debate on the pending legis-
 lation. concludes;, the, Senate should ex-
 press itself as, to what, the situation
 should. be in the. future in regard to other
 mutual defense treaties which our Na-
 tion has throughout: the world.

 view that the Executive may mo
 or a provision thereof only by the conclu-
 sion of another treaty entered into by and
 with the advice and consent of the Senate.
 This is also the view of my advisors who
 are fully aware of my position and fully
 share my views.
 That is the end of the quotation from
 the statement of then Secretary of State
 John Foster Dulles, in 1954.
 I am aware, of course, that there are
 many able and outstanding lawyers who
 take a different view from that expressed
 by the Secretary of State in 1954. I am
 aware that this is a gray area, so to
 speak, and that nothing really conclu-
 sive is set forth in the Constitution, that
 I can find, specifically denying.to the
 President such a right.
 On the other hand, it does seem rea-
 sonable to me that when the Senate of
 the United States must advise and con-
 sent in the approval of a treaty, the
 Senate should have some participation
 in the termination of such a treaty.
 I have presented a Senate resolution,
 which is on the calendar, and inciden-
 tally this resolution was presented by
 me for myself and for Mr. THURMOND,
 Mr. WARNER, Mr. HELMS, Mr. HAYAKAWA,
 and Mr. GARN. That Senate resolution
 states this:
 It is the sense of the Senate that approval
 by the Senate of the United States is re-
 quired to terminate any mutual defense
 treaty between the United States and an-
 other nation.
 Before the debate on the pending legis-
 lation concludes, I likely will present this
 as a proposed amendment to the legisla-
 tion reported to the Senate by the For-
 eign Relations Committee.
 As I indicated earlier, the question is
 much broader, as I see it, than just the
 question of Taiwan. The question is,
 What is going to happen in the future
 to the many other mutual defense agree-
 ments and treaties which we have with
 other nations?
 In summary and in ending, Mr. Presi-
 dent, I again commend the Foreign
 Relations Committee for the legislation
 it has brought before the Senate. I think
 this legislation will go a long way toward
 correcting and improving some of the
 problems  created by the President's
 action.
 I commend the committee and I com-
 mend the manager of the bill Senator
 followed the arrangements that had been
 devised within the treaty for termina-
 tion of the treaty.
 We used that as a difference to set it
 apart  from  the  use  of  the  word
 "abrogate."
 I just wanted to spell out that clarifi-
 cation because I think the way the dis-
 tinguished Senator used the word "abro-
 gate" was not in the same sense in which
 we used it in the committee.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. May I say
 to the Senator from Ohio that I in-
 tended to use it, or intended it to be
 construed, in the same sense that the
 Senator from Ohio construes that term.
 Mr. GLENN. All right.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Under the
 treaty either country, or the way it is
 expressed, either party, either party to
 the treaty has the right to terminate the
 treaty by giving a 1-year's notice.
 Mr. GLENN. That is correct.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. The way
 I construe the word "party," I construe
 that to mean either Government.
 Mr. GLENN. That is right.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. When we
 speak of the U.S. Government, I con-
 strue that to mean the executive branch
 and the legislative branch acting to-
 gether.
 Mr. GLENN. We did not address that
 question of constitutionality. I think
 the courts are going to be called upon to
 decide that issue as has been indicated
 to Senator GOLDWATER a short time ago
 here in the Chamber.
 I thank the distinguished Senator.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Mississippi.
 Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I cer-
 tainly thank the Senators who are floor
 managers of the bill, and also the Sena-
 tor from Kansas (Mr. DOLE).
 Mr. President, the purpose of my brief
 remarks, and I shall not detain the Sen-
 ate over 4 minutes, is to endorse section
 114 of S. 245 that affirms a continuing
 interest of the United States in the
 future security and well-being of Tai-
 wan.
 I was a cosponsor of a resolution on
 this matter. The compromise language
 before us today was approved by a unani-
 mous vote of the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee. I hope the Senate will give its
 approval to this provision by a solid vote.

 irginia.                             need to establish some form of diplomat-
 ic relations with them so that we could
 at least have ongoing communitions be-
 tween our two nations. This is extremely
 important  since  China  has  nuclear
 weapons and the capacity to deliver
 them on target.
 Mr. President, I notice that emphasis
 is not given to that point as much as I
 think it should.
 They also appear to be intent on mod-
 ernizing their country, and that means
 expanded trade opportunities in future
 years where they will doubtless be pur-
 chasers of grain, soybeans, cotton, and
 other agricultural products and techno-
 logical products from us.
 Mr. President, this Taiwan provision
 pledges that any nonpeaceful efforts to
 reunite Taiwan with China would be
 viewed as a matter of grave concern to
 the United States. There is also a com-
 mitment to provide Taiwan with defen-
 sive weapons.
 The United States has a moral obliga-
 tion to the people of Taiwan and we
 must maintain our commercial, cultural,
 and other relations. Since the early
 1950's, the United States has provided
 $5.5 billion in military and economic aid
 for Taiwan. I think that this was money
 wisely spent. With our assistance, Tai-
 wan used its industriousness and creativ-
 ity to transform their country into a
 modern and flourishing economy. I think
 it is important that we continue military
 and economic aid, as we.have done for
 the past several years, on a credit basis.
 This provision maintains that right.
 I gave my fum support to the Mutual
 Defense, Treaty with Taiwan 24 years
 ago:. That treaty served a useful purpose
 then, but. the time ' has come for the
 United States to review its overall policy
 in the Pacific. And I have thought this,
 since we got into the war in Vietnam.
 Under the terms of the treaty the United
 States has notified Taiwan of its inten-
 tion to terminate that treaty, but we are
 certainly by no means breaking off re-
 lations or turning our backs on Taiwan.
 This bill is not part of a weak or mod-
 erate policy in the Pacific area. To the
 contrary, it states a positive policy to the
 effect that we shall maintain a capacity
 to resist and resort to force, if neces-
 sary, in the area of Taiwan. I favor an
 extension of the scope of this policy in
 the Pacific area and seek allies for this
 purpose.
 Today we are debating important leg-
 islation that reaffirms our commitment
 and friendship with Taiwan while allow-
 ing us to undertake a new relationship
 with China. While this is an important
 first step in formulating a post-Vietnam
 Pacific policy, the time has come for the
 United States to go forward with a new
 Pacific policy which I think should in-
 clude an expanded role for Japan.
 For the past 14 months, several mem-
 bers of the Armed Services Committee,
 at my suggestion, have been reviewing
 the future military policy of the Pacific
 region. The Pacific study group, consist-
 ing of Senators NUNN, HARRY BYRD, HART,
 and TOWER are still gathering facts from
 government and foreign leaders here
 and abroad. The late Senator Bartlett of
 Oklahoma was an active and valuable
 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050011-0
 S 2132
 member of this group. They have so far
 reached the following conclusions:
 After their review of the Korean sit-
 uation, they recommended that U.S.
 troop  withdrawals  from  Korea  be
 suspended.
 Japan, an economic giant, now stands
 on the verge of making a willing con-
 tribution to East Asian security more
 commensurate with its economic stat-
 ure. There are major real increases-
 recent and planned-in Japan's defense
 spending. Thee is a growing Japanese
 willingness to assume a larger share of
 the costs of stationing U.S. forces in
 Japan. I recommend that my colleagues
 in the Senate review the reports sub-
 mitted to the Armed Services Committee
 by the Pacific study group.
 There will be other reports that, I
 think, will also be important, to be filed
 soon.
 So, Mr. President, I support this bill as
 a new start, in a way, of a new policy in
 the Pacific, and as a renewal of certain
 protection and aid to Taiwan.
 Again I thank the leaders.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. STENNIS. If I have time.
 Mr. JAVITS. I just want to say to the
 Senator that I think this statesmanlike
 attitude toward this matter is so much a
 part of his support for the war powers
 resolution which made it possible. I wish
 to say that, again for history, I am deeply
 grateful to him and it shows the fact that
 Senator STENNIS understands the rela-
 tionship between military power and
 diplomatic effort.
 Mr. STENNIS. Well, I appreciate the
 Senator's remarks very much, and I
 commend him again for his valuable,
 highly valuable, contribution in the pas-
 sage of that so-called War Powers Act.
 Mr. JAVITS. I thank the Senator.
 Mr. STENNIS. He was the kingpin.

 TAIWAN ENABLING ACT
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would like
 to compliment the members of the Com-
 mittee on Foreign Relations on the fine
 product of their labor in considering the
 Taiwan Enabling Act, S. 245. This was a
 bill whose inauspicious conception fol-
 lowed the administration's untimely an-
 nouncement of the normalization of
 relations with the People's Republic of
 China on December 15, 1978.
 SENATE NOT CONSULTED
 The legislation proposed by the Presi-
 dent in the wake of that announcement
 was woefully inadequate in addressing
 the needs of the people of the Republic
 of China and the important strategic
 and economic requirements of the people
 of the United States. If the administra-
 tion had consulted with Congress, as it
 was bound to do byrthe terms of the leg-
 islation cosponsored by' Senator STONE
 and myself last summer and signed by
 President Carter on September 26. 1978,
 the period of uncertainty and tension we
 and the people on Taiwan have passed
 through over the last 3 months would
 never have occurred. Many Senators. in-
 including myself, felt constrained to
 challenge the administration's bill and

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE           March 7, 1979
 its apparent intent to obliterate any ves-
 tige of the valuable and trustworthy alli-
 ance the United States maintained with
 the Republic of China.
 S. 245, WORTHY OED CONSIDERATION
 The changes and modifications which
 we advocated for the Taiwan Enabling
 Act, after many hours of, hearings and
 much labor by the members of the Com-
 mittee on Foreign Relations, resulted in
 a complete rewrite of the bill, including
 the title, which immeasurably enhances
 the safeguards for security and con-
 tinued excellent relations between Amer-
 ica and Taiwan. My own particular con-
 cern was for the safety of Taiwan from
 attack or any aggressive reprisal from
 the People's Republic of China, and for
 the danger this would. cause to U.S.
 affairs and strategic interests.
 SENATE RESOLUTION 13
 For that reason, I introduced Senate
 Resolution 13 to assure the Republic of
 China that the United States would not
 turn its back on a longtime ally. It was
 vital, I felt, to convey that assurance in a
 measure that specifically spelled out our
 Nation's commitment to aid the Repub-
 lic of China in resisting aggression.
 Vaguely worded statements about gen-
 eral interests of the people concerned
 were not sufficient. We cannot rely on
 a leadership in mainland China that
 may prove to be unstable and transitory,
 nor on unofficial declarations about in-
 tentions that come only at politically
 opportune times. That is why the much
 more specific language of the Senate's
 version of S. 245 is so gratifying and
 necessary.
 I especially would like to mention the
 effort of the distinguished Senator from
 Florida (Mr. STONE) to make certain
 that  America's  strategic  needs  and
 Taiwan's  defense  requirements    were
 spelled out in this bill.
 A NORMALIZATION THAT PROVIDES PEACE
 None of the changes in this bill were
 made with    an untoward motive of
 hindering the.normalization process with
 the People's Republic of China. They
 were meant only to recognize the simple
 reality of U.S. concerns in the Asian-
 Pacific region and our desire for peace
 for an old and faithful ally. If the
 -Taiwanese- question is not resolved in
 favor of freedom and independence, then
 none of our allies, none of the people
 facing oppression in the world today,
 none of the nations who rely on the
 strength of America and the good faith
 of our commitments to dissuade stronger
 and more aggressive alliances-none of
 these can hope for freedom of choice
 in a secure and stable future.
 Mr. President, I believe, as I have in-
 dicated, as ,the Senator from Kansas has
 indicated, at the outset that S. 245 rep-
 resents an excellent attempt to come to
 grips with the concerns I have just men-
 tioned.
 I do have a series of eight amendments
 which, I hope, can either be accepted or
 adopted on rollcall votes which, I believe,
 will further clarify and specify our good
 intentions on the issues of security and
 justice for the people of Taiwan and for
 congressional oversight.
 If these changes are adopted-and I
 am not suggesting that everyone must
 be adopted or that they cannot be fur-
 ther modified-it would seem to me that
 we should then go ahead and approve
 the legislation.
 I think, just to summarize the amend-
 ment so that there might be some dis-
 cussion, that I will offer one of the
 amendments before I yield the floor, that
 the first two amendments would remove
 the more obvious and unnecessary word-
 ing about the unofficiality of the rela-
 tionship of Taiwan. They also follow the i
 more direct language of the House ver-
 sion.
 The third amendment would clarify-
 the. meaning of "threat" What is "a
 grave concern" used in the legislation?
 What is grave concern to the United
 States? It would include various eco-
 nomic and trade practices along the lines
 of the original resolution on security,
 which the Senator from Kansas intro-
 duced.
 The fourth amendment would prevent
 Taiwan from being expelled from inter-
 national organizations. If the United
 States can do anything about it. That
 was also a provision in one of the orig-
 inal resolutions. .
 The fifth amendment would make
 specific that in accordance with the
 Security and Assistance Act arms re-
 quests from Taiwan must be reported to
 the Committee on Foreign Relations,
 and the status of those sales must be
 reported to the Committee on' Foreign
 Relations and also to the Speaker of the
 House.
 The sixth amendment is one that I
 understand I may be cosponsoring with
 other Senators, the Senator from South
 Carolina  (Mr.  HOLLINGS),  the Senator
 from North Carolina (Mr. HELMS), and
 the , Senator   from  Oklahoma  (Mr.
 BOREN), ' and it strikes a section that
 specifically encourages the People's Re-
 public of China to take Twin Oaks and
 the embassy property away from Taiwan.
 So the Senator from Kansas would be
 joining in efforts on that amendment.
 The seventh amendment would follow
 the same reasoning of the first two
 amendments in changing the title.
 Finally an amendment to provide Sen-
 ate oversight on' the selection of the
 American Institute's Director who is now
 chosen by the Secretary of State.
 Mr. President, with reference to the
 reporting amendment, many of us in the
 Senate are concerned about continuing
 the sale of arms to Taiwan. We are cop-
 vinced that without such sales it would
 be impossible for Taiwan to survive.
 The President's action in putting a
 moratorium on arms sales this year, per-
 haps the most critical in our new.rela-
 tionship with Taiwan, requires a great
 deal of clarification.
 The amendment that I plan to offer
 initially would clarify the intent of the
 International Security Assistance Act of
 1978 with respect to Taiwan. It specifies
 that the President will not only report to
 the Committee on Foreign Relations all
 proposed arms sales to the Government

 Taipei authorities. So we will know to-
 tally in the Senate and in the House just
 what the status is and not just the sale
 itself. In this way it will be clear to the
 Senate and to the American people just
 what the United States is prepared to do
 to help insure the security of Taiwan.
 It seems to me this is an amendment
 that I think would have the approval of
 the administration as well as the man-
 agers of the bill, and I am prepared to
 offer that amendment at this time.
 TIP AMENDMENT NO. 26
 (Purpose: To require the President to trans-
 mit to the Congress a report on certain
 arms sales proposed for or requested by the
 people on Taiwan)
 Mr. President, I send an unprinted
 amendment to the desk and ask for its
 immediate consideration.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will report.
 The assistant legislative clerk read as
 follows:
 The Senator from Kansas (Mr. DOLE) pro-
 poses an unprinted amendment numbered 26.
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
 mous consent that further reading of
 the amendment be dispensed with.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The amendment is as follows:
 On page 14, line 24; strike out "and". '
 At the bottom of page 14 insert the fol-
 lowing:
 "(4) the President shall transmit to the
 Speaker of the House of Representatives and
 the chairman of the Committee on Foreign
 Relations of the Senate on or before Novem-
 ber 15 of each year a report on the status of
 arms sales of major defense equipment of
 $7,000,000 or more or of any other defense
 articles or defense services for $25,000,000 or
 more, which are considered eligible for ap-
 proval during the fiscal year beginning on
 October 1 of such year and which are pro-
 posed for or requested by the people on
 Taiwan; and
 On page 15, line 1, strike out "(4)" and in-
 sert in lieu thereof "(5) ".
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I do not see
 the-inanager of the bill on the floor, but
 it is my understanding that this amend-
 ment has been agreed upon. I also un-
 derstand that there is no objection from
 the State Department, and it is my hope
 that the amendment might be accepted.
 If the Senator from California would
 prefer to wait-
 Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, If the
 Senator will yield, I think we would be
 prepared to accept this amendment, pro-
 vided we renumber it to go into a differ-
 eht part of the bill. The language where
 the Senator seeks to place it has been
 very laboriously worked over. The pro-
 posed language is perfectly acceptable,
 but we would just like it placed in a
 different place. If you will let the clerk
 renumber it in the bill, it will be accept-
 able.
 Mr. DOLE. The Senator from Kansas
 has no objection to that. We could make
 it a new section.
 Mr. CRANSTON. Yes.
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would so
 amend the amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. To place
 it at. the end of the bill?
 Mr. DOLE. Yes, as section 115.
 Mr. CRANSTON. With that under-
 standing, we are now prepared to accept
 it.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  This
 would be section 115?
 Mr. DOLE. Yes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection? Without objection, it is so
 ordered.
 The amendment, as modified, was
 agreed to as follows:
 On page 15, after line 4 insert a new sec-
 tion 115, as follows:
 ' "The  President  shall  transmit  to  the
 Speaker of the House of Representatives and
 the chairman of the Committee on Foreign
 Relations of the Senate on or before Novem-
 ber 15 of each year a report on the status
 of arms sales of major defense equipment
 of $7,000,000 or more or of any other defense
 articles or defense services for $25,000,000
 or more, which are considered eligible for
 approval during the fiscal year beginning
 on October 1 of such year and which are
 proposed for or requested by the people on
 Taiwan."
 UP AMENDMENT NO. 27
 (Purpose: To substitute "Taiwan" for "the
 people on Taiwan")
 Mr. DOLE. I send another amend-
 ment to the desk and ask for its imme-
 diate.consideration.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 amendment will be stated.
 The assistant legislative clerk read as
 follows:
 The Senator from Kansas (Mr. DOLE) offers
 an unprinted amendment numbered 27:
 On page 8, line 18, strike out "the people
 on".
 On page 8, line 20, strike out "people on".
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
 mous consent that further reading of
 the amendment be dispensed with.
 The PRESIDING 'OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The amendment is as follows:
 On page 8, line 18, strike out "the people
 on".
 On page 8, line 20, strike out "people on".
 On page 9, line 6, strike out "the people
 on":

 On page 19, line 6, strike out "people on".
 On page 20, line 17, strike out "the people

 On page 22, line 22, strike out "the people
 on".
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would
 point out that all through S. 245, the lan-
 guage "the people on Taiwan" is used re-
 peatedly. It seems to me that we could
 simplify that language by striking those
 words wherever they appear and have it
 read simply "Taiwan."
 This would not affect the meaning or
 intent of the legislation in the sense that
 our relations with Taiwan would not, in
 practice, be any more or less official than
 they are proposed to be. It would bring
 the language in S. 245 into line with the
 terminology used in the house version
 of this legislation. This language has
 been accepted by the Department of
 State.
 Mr. 'CRANSTON. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. DOLE. Yes.
 Mr. CRANSTON. What is the basis of
 the Senator's statement that the lan-
 guage has been accepted by the Depart-
 ment of State? It is not my understand-
 ing that that is the case.
 Mr. DOLE. I am-not suggesting that
 this amendment has been accepted, but
 I think the language in the House bill
 has been accepted.
 Mr. CRANSTON. I see. I thank the
 Senator.
 Mr. DOLE. I cannot give the Senator
 assurance that that will be forthcom-
 ing, although I think that is the case.
 The present language presents the
 prtense that we are not dealing with a
 legal entity or government on Taiwan,
 and is an unnecessary slight toward the
 authorities with whom we must work on
 Taiwan. Taipei has insisted that its re-
 lations with the United States have the'
 qualities of officiality and are controlled
 by the Government of the Republic of
 China. Any other language is both
 clumsy and uncalled for.
 It seems to me that this is an amend-
 ment that does not require a great deal
 of debate. Since I know other Senators
 are wanting to speak-both the Senator
 from North Carolina (Mr. MORGAN) and
 the Senator from Florida (Mr. STONE)
 have indicated a desire to speak-I am
 prepared to vote now, or to set the
 amendment aside temporarily and have
 the vote follow their remarks.
 Mr. President, I suggest the absence
 of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will call the roll.
 The assistant legislative clerk pro-
 ceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. STONE. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for
 the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. STONE. Mr. President, I under-
 stand that the Senator from Kansas,
 who has an amendment pending, does
 not object if I make a few remarks at
 this point.
 Mr. DOLE: Mr.. President, I ask unani-
 mous consent that the amendment be

 temporarily laid aside so that the dis-

 Mr. STONE. I thank the distinguished
 Senator.
 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 44
 Mr. President, the Orient has never
 been something well-understood by Oc-
 cidential man, from the time Columbus
 stepped out of his ship and thought he
 was in the East. In evolving American
 foreign policy over the past 200 years,
 our country's leaders have been only
 slightly more certain of their steps.
 When the bill now before us first
 reached the Senate, it went only halfway
 along the path that the overwhelming
 majority of the American people think
 we should follow. It effectively formalized
 relations with Peking and shifted the
 dealings of our country with the govern-
 ment in Taipei to an unofficial, nongov-
 ernmental relationship, but it left un-
 clear exactly what that unofficial, non-
 governmental relationship is and how it
 will work.
 After the Republic of China on Taiwan
 has stood by the United States for 30
 years, following our lead and supporting
 our foreign policy even when others
 claiming to be our friends did.not, it was
 wrong for the United States, in a pell
 mell rush to offset the Soviet Union in
 Asia, to leave the Government and peo-
 ple of the Republic of China on Taiwan
 hanging onto their relationship with the
 United States by only a thin, vague
 thread of off-the-record assurances that
 no matter what the Department of State
 said in public, things would stay as they
 had always been.
 We have seen in the last month or so
 that is not the case. Representatives of
 the Republic of China on Taiwan have
 been heavily pressured into agreeing
 with the Department of State's demands.
 They have been pushed into giving up
 some of their offices in this country
 through which they do business with us
 in excess of $7 billion a year. They have
 found themselves this week unable to
 get even a piece of paper signed and
 notarized. No visas are being issued in
 Taiwan because the Department of State
 does not want to send an official U.S.
 Government check through' the banks on
 Taiwan.
 Mr. President. I ask unanimous con-
 sent to submit a joint resolution at this
 point.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The resolution will be received and
 appropriately referred.
 Mr.. STONE. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the joint reso-
 lution be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the joint
 resolution was ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:
 S.J. RES. 44
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
 resentatives of the United States of America
 in Congress assembled, That, notwithstand-
 ing  the  exchange of ambassadors or the
 establishment of embassies by the govern-
 ments of the United States and the People's
 Republic of China, the President shall con-
 tinue to carry out programs, transactions,
 and other activities with respect to the
 people on Taiwan to the same extent and in
 the same manner as provided in the memo-
 randum of the President, dated December
 30, 1978, relating to relations with the people
 on Taiwan, except that no program, trans-
 action, or other activity with respect to the
 people on Taiwan may be carried out through
 the American Institute in Taiwan or any
 other instrumentality designated by the
 President, until the Congress enacts legisla-
 tion specifically providing for such program,
 transaction, or activity to be carried out
 through  such  Institute  or  other  instru-
 mentality.
 SEC. 2. For purposes of the resolution, the
 term "people on Taiwan" shall mean and
 include the governing authority on Taiwan,
 recognized by the United States prior to
 January 1, 1979 as the Republic of China, its
 agencies,  instrumentalities,  and  political
 subdivisions, and the people governed by it
 in the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores
 on December 31, 1978.
 SEC. 3. This joint resolution takes effect
 on January 1, 1979.
 Mr. STONE. Mr. President, I also ask
 unanimous consent to have printed in
 the RECORD a letter dated March 6, 1979,
 which I addressed to Senator FRANK
 CHURCH, chairman of the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee, and a telgram which
 I received from Frank P. Parker, presi-
 dent, American Chamber of Commerce
 in the Republic of China.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 U.S. SENATE,
 Washington, D.C., March 6, 1979.
 Hon. FRANK CHURCH,
 Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee, Dirksen Senate Office Building
 DEAR MR.-CHAIRMAN: I agiwriting to ex-
 press my deep concern and strong objections
 to certain langauge in the Foreign Relations
 Committee Report on S. 245. Beginning on
 page 17 and continuing for several pages
 thereafter, there-is a discussion-of "legal is-
 sues" relating to the termination of the Mu-
 tual Defense Treaty with the Republic of
 China and other legal issues regarding the
 Republic of China. On page 19, in connection
 with a discussion of the termination of the
 Mutual Defense Treaty, a. paragraph is in-
 cluded which reads,        '
 "It appears to the Committee, therefore,
 that the Constitutional prerogatives of the
 Congress and the Senate have not been in-
 vaded in that neither the Congress nor the
 Senate has elected to exercise the powers
 granted it by the Constitution to participate
 in the process of treaty termination. Had
 'ther done so, a different conclusion would
 .:kely obtain."
 I do not believe it was the intention of
 .the Committee and certainly it was pot au-
 thorized by the Committee, to take-.'s :posi-
 tion as to whether the President's manner of
 terminating the Mutual Defense Treaty in-
 vaded the prerogatives of the Congress or
 not. While there was discussion during the
 course of the Committee's hearings, I am not
 aware of an attempt by any member of the
 Committee urging the Committee to take a
 position such as described by this paragraph.
 I  am particularly  concerned  about the
 implications which this paragraph may have
 for future decisions in the foreign policy
 area by the Executive Branch. It expresses
 the notion that when Congress, for whatever
 reason, chooses not to exercise certain Con-
 stitutional powers, that Congress has en-
 dorsed a particular Constitutional theory. I
 strongly disagree with any such theory of
 Constitutional interpretation. Finally, 'I am
 concerned about the inclusion of this para-
 graph inasmuch as Committee members were
 not given any opportunity to review the
 report before it was filed. Where it is neces-
 sary for the Committee and Senate to move
 as quickly as possible on important legis-
 lation such as this, I believe it is particularly
 important that the Committee report lan-
 guage be as carefully developed, as possible
 and limited as much as possible to an ex-
 planation of the bill which the Committee
 has agreed to report.
 I would appreciate your consideration of
 appropriate steps to eliminate the paragraph
 to which I have referred, from the Com-
 mittee report, or to have a statement by the
 managers of the bill which would correct
 the gross misimpression which I believe
 will result if this language is incorporated
 in the Committee Report.                  --
 Warm personal regards.
 Most cordially,
 RICHARD (DICK) STONE.

 maintaining business relations on as usual

 ROBERT P. PARKER,
 President.
 Mr. STONE. When I first saw this bill
 and objected to the vagueness of its origi-
 nal language, I was told the vagueness
 was necessary, that I should not worry
 about it, that things would continue as
 they always had. I did not think that
 would be the case, and that suspicion
 has been proved correct. The bill as
 originally written would have left the
 Government of the Republic of China in
 some dim nether world, neither country
 nor ally.  '
 Throughout the committee hearings
 and the markup sessions, I worked with
 others on the committee-the chairman
 and the ranking minority member in
 particular-to remove the vagueness, to
 make sure it was clear exactly how the
 relationship between the United States
 and the Republic of China on Taiwan
 would continue. Our committee rewrote
 this bill, providing numerous guarantees
 which were not in the original version.
 In some areas, particularly the area of
 military security for the Republic of
 China, I feel our language falls short,
 and, when offered, I intend to support
 amendments strengthening our commit-
 ment to the future security of the Repub-
 lic of China on Taiwan.
 In the area of our economic commit-
 ment to Taiwan, I think this bill, now
 that the committee has worked on it long
 and hard, effectively assures that the
 commercial ties between the Republic of
 China and the United States can remain
 strong.
 The first thing that had to be done to
 guarantee that was to define exactly who
 it is we are dealing with. Under Japanese

 March 7, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 law, it was possible for the derecognition
 of the Republic of China, the recognition
 of the People's Republic of China, and
 the establishment of an unofficial rela-
 tionship between Japan and the Repub-
 lic of China to be done by executive flat.
 That cannot work in this country. It
 may be all well and good to want an un-
 official  relationship  with  something
 called the people on Taiwan, but some-
 where along the line American law must
 spell out exactly who are the people on
 Taiwan.
 This bill now does that by defining the
 people on Taiwan as the governing au-
 thority on Taiwan, recognized by the
 United States prior to January 1, 1979,
 as the Republic of China. That tells
 Members of the Senate, the business peo-
 ple and the U.S. courts exactly who it is
 we have this unofficial relationship with,
 and it does not breech the agreement
 reached with the People's Republic of
 China that the United States and the Re-
 public of China would not officially have
 direct government-to-government status
 in their future dealings with each other.
 While I still think it is not the business
 of the United States to tell any country
 what to call itself and we should call the
 Republic of China by the name it has
 chosen for itself, the language of this sec-
 tion of the bill is a good compromise. The
 Department of State says it can live with
 it. The Republic of China can live with
 it. The People's Republic of China can
 live with it, and, even though it is not
 what I would most like to see the United
 States do, I can live with it.
 Another key part of the bill comes in
 sections, 102, 103, and 104. There the
 committee spells out in clear, legal terms,
 the intention of the United States to con-
 tinue unchanged the economic relation-
 ship and treaties we had with the Re-
 public of China before the first of this
 year. The new committee language spe-
 cifically continues, in the absence of for-
 mal diplomatic ties, the standing of the
 Republic of China, its agencies, its corpo-
 rations, and its citizens to sue and be sued
 in U.S. courts. Without that guarantee,
 there would be real questions as to the
 validity of contracts, and the continua-
 tion of American investment and trade in
 the Republic of China would be imperiled.
 I would also call attention to section
 111 of the committee bill. The two sub-
 pections there make it clear that the
 property and assets of the Republic. of
 China in the United States remain under
 the control and ownership of the Repub-
 lic of China and would not be open to
 attachments or claims by or against the
 government on the mainland. A major
 aim of this provision is to protect bank
 deposits of the Republic of China in U.S.
 commercial banks-some $4 billion in
 New York City banks alone.
 Without this protection, the economies
 of both countries would be threatened.
 When Fidel Castro came to power in
 Cuba, I recall all sorts of claims against
 the Cuban Government established by
 Castro and the assets of others from
 Cuba were attached in attempts to gain
 compensation for losses incurred by .
 Americans in Castro's takeover. The
 same thing happened earlier in U.S.
 courts when the People's Republic of
 China sought to gain control of assets
 held in the name of the Republic of
 China by the Wells Fargo Bank.
 For the same kind of legal battles to
 take place now over the cash reserves of
 the Republic of China held in the United
 States could mean an economic disaster
 for the United States. The stock market
 would fall, and interest rates would soar.
 The language adopted in committee
 avoids all that.
 There is one other section I would like
 to comment on. That is section 113 deal-
 ing with privileges and immunities for
 the representatives of the Republic of
 China who are assigned to the offices of
 that country's institute in the United
 States. The bill simply says those repre-
 sentatives shall enjoy the privileges and
 immunities comparable to those provided
 to missions of foreign countries while
 carrying out their official duties. I sug-
 gested this language to the committee,
 and the members adopted the language,
 following the lead of many Senators who
 cosponsored my bill on privileges and
 immunities.
 The extension of these standard diplo-
 matic privileges and immunities means
 the representatives of the Republic of
 China will be able to do their jobs in this
 country, and it also manifests our inten-
 tion to be as fair as possible to the Re-
 public of China in this whole difficult
 situation. When we granted the People's
 Republic of China a liaison office in this
 country prior to the extension of diplo-
 matic recognition, its representatives re-
 ceived these privileges and immunities
 on a diplomatic basis. Since it was agreed
 by the Department of State that there
 would be no formal diplomatic recogni-
 tion of the Republic of China, the privi-
 leges and. immunities extended to the
 members of Republic of China offices in
 this country are not fully diplomatic.
 They do parallel the diplomatic privi-
 leges and immunities granted other for-
 eign missions, however, and they do show
 clearly the United States does recognize
 the Republic of China is to be repre-
 sented as if it were a foreign country.
 There are other important parts of this
 bill-not the least of which are the sec-
 tions relating to security-but the sec-
 tions I have outlined are those on which
 I worked during the committee hearings
 and which I think are absolutely neces-
 sary if this new arrangement is to work.
 As I said, I would like to see stronger
 language on the security question-as-
 serting, perhaps, that an attack on the
 Republic of China would be considered a
 threat to the national security of the
 United States rather than simply a mat-
 ter of grave concern-but on the whole,
 this bill is much better than it was origi-
 nally. It is not perfect, but it will work.
 And under 'its provisions I am sure the
 United States and the Republic of China
 can continue to be close friends and will
 remain profitable trading partners for a
 long time.
 Mr. JAVITS. Will the Senator yield?
 Mr. STONE. I yield.
 Mr. JAVITS. I thank the Senator very
 much for his fine statement and also for
 the very fine work which he did on this
 52135
 bill, particularly in respect of insuring
 the assets of the people of Taiwan here
 in this country. The Senator mentioned
 New York City where the banks are very
 heavily involved. He joined very effec-
 tively in fashioning what was needed to
 deal with that situation.
 I might say, too, that my agreement
 between the Senator and myself, I will
 propose an amendment to section 111
 which will make it clear that organiza-
 tions and other entities formed under
 the laws of Taiwan will also be included
 within the purview of the rights which
 are preserved.
 That is necessary, as the Senator and
 I understand, because section 101(b) de-
 fining people on Taiwan speaks of the
 governing authority on Taiwan, its agen-
 cies, instrumentalities, and political sub-
 divisions.
 That may or may not include corporate
 entities or comparable entities organized
 under the laws on?Taiwan.
 To make that certain, with the Sena-
 tor from Florida I will propose an
 amendment which will make that sure
 in section 111.
 The reason I am not doing it this
 minute I would like to explain to the
 Senate. It is because Senator DOLE is
 raising the whole issue as to whether
 we should call it the people on Taiwan or
 Taiwan. So in order to have our amend-
 ment technically correct we have to wait
 until that is decided.
 Mr. STONE. I think that is quite valid.
 I thank the distinguished Senator from
 New York, the ranking member of our
 committee, not only for his very kind
 words about my efforts at the commit-
 tee level, but I want to thank him for
 his terrific leadership on this issue. From
 the very first day the committee started
 to consider this bill, it was wonderful.
 When I offered one of the clarifying
 amendments to the effect that the Re-
 public of China ought to be preserved in
 its ownership of its assets, it was the
 Senator from New York who correctly
 pointed out that we needed additional
 provisions, taking care not only of the
 Government and its agencies but the
 individuals, the corporations, the trusts,
 all of which the Senator's and my
 amendment, which he will offer, would
 address.
 Mr. JAVITS. Right.
 Mr. STONE. Mr. President, the pur-
 pose of the proposed amendment of sec-
 tion 111 is to insure that the objectives
 of the Congress, as set forth in Senate
 Report 96-7, are fulfilled and to avoid
 any ambiguity or potential litigation.
 Senate Report 96-7 makes clear the Sen-
 ate's intent that the rights and obliga-
 tions of natural persons, juridical en-
 tities and the authorities on Taiwan are
 not affected by the normalization of
 relations with the People's Republic of
 China. Section 111,. as reported by the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
 already deals with the rights and obli-
 gations of natural persons and the au-
 thorities on Taiwan. Section 111, as
 amended, would make clear that the
 term "people on Taiwan" as used in sec-
 tion 111 would also include organiza-
 tions and other entities formed under

 CONGRESSIONAL- RECORD - SENATE           March 7, 1979
 the law applied on Taiwan as well as
 natural persons and the authorities on
 Taiwan covered by the definition in sec-
 tion 101(b). The result of the proposed
 amendment is thus to avoid any impli-
 cation of a diminution of the rights and
 obligations  of  juridical  entities  on
 Taiwan, including corporations and all
 other  nongovernmental  organizations
 and entities.
 Let me close by saying that if the
 Congress  does not rapidly complete
 action on this bill before us, we are,. at
 this moment and for the days to come,
 in a very difficult and dangerous situa-
 tion in terms of the commerce and trade
 between   the Republic of China  on
 Taiwan and the United States. We are
 in a hiatus, we are in a gap, which has
 been brought about ' by the normaliza-
 tion of relations and official recognition
 of Peking without the establishment of
 the institutions to carry on our commer-
 cial relationship with Taiwan.
 This is not the purpose of the Gov-
 ernment or the people of the United
 States. Therefore, earlier in my remarks,
 I had unanimous consent to introduce a
 joint resolution and a statement clarify-
 ing the purpose of that resolution which
 would authorize and direct the President
 of the United States to continue in effect
 the temporary actions justified and au-
 thorized by his Presidential memoran-
 dum in effect, temporarily continuing the
 relationships in order to keep validating
 papers and visas and the consular and
 other efforts that have to be made if
 trade and commerce are to continue. I
 hope this bill can be enacted swiftly
 enough so that we do not get into a
 commercial crunch. If this does not
 happen, then, week after week, the more
 than $7 billion worth of trade between
 the Rdpublic of China on Taiwan and
 its citizens and firms and our own.U.S.
 Government and our citizens and firms
 get to be a little bit shaky. That is a
 situation which we cannot tolerate for
 too much longer.
 Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?
 Mr. STONE. I yield.
 Mr. GLENN. We are already in a
 crunch. We do not have an American
 Institute on Taiwan and we do not have
 any money appropriated for such. an
 entity. We have no authority to transfer
 the embassy funds over for that purpose.
 As of this moment, the things we speak
 of in the U.S. Senate are in limbo in Tai-
 wan until this bill is passed and until we
 get the authorization and appropriation
 transfererd over from the embassy to the
 new American Institute on Taiwan.   .
 ' Mr. STONE. The Senator from Ohio,
 the distinguished floor manager of the
 bill, is correct. If that happens rapidly,
 that is fine. The resolution, though, that
 I have introduced would, if passed, allow
 and direct the administration to con-
 tinue, on an informal, unofficial, and
 temporary basis, the actions of our rep-
 resentatives who are still in Taiwan and
 the representatives of the Republic of
 China who are still in Washington and in
 this country so that we do not get into a
 commercial crunch.
 After all, if you lose 1 month out of a
 year and the year's trade is $7 billion,
 query: How much of that can we afford
 and can Taiwan afford to lose? Up to this
 point, it has not manifested itself too
 severely, although I have received a wire,
 a cable, from the American Chamber of
 Commerce on Taiwan complaining and
 expressing concern about this situation.
 If, in the next few days, we do not get
 a move on, I am afraid that we are
 going to have to consider some kind of
 temporary relief of the sort that I have
 introduced because it is of vital economic
 interest to both countries that we con-
 tinue this trade.
 Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator
 yield on that point?
 Mr. STONE. I yield.
 Mr. SARBANES. I think the point the
 Senator is making is a good one. I think
 it is one of the strongest arguments for
 expeditious action on the legislation now
 pending before the Senate.
 Mr. STONE. Quite right.
 Mr. SARBANES. It would, of course,
 meet in every respect that at least the
 committee has been- able to shape the
 legislation, all of the various problems
 to which the Senator has addressed him-
 self. This legislation is very important in
 order to enable the long-standing eco-
 nomic and cultural relationships which
 have existed to continue to exist. I
 think the committee has acted with ex-
 pedition and we are hopeful now that
 we shall be able to move here, in the
 Senate, on this matter in the next day
 or two and complete this legislation, re-
 concile our position with the House, and
 place it into law. That, of course, would
 then meet, in ' the most fully developed
 sense possible, all of these problems.
 Mr. STONE. The distinguished Sena-
 tor from Maryland is correct. I just want
 to say, in conclusion, that I think that
 my colleagues on the Committee on For-
 eign Relations were careful, were con-
 structive, and were very responsive to
 the business community of the United
 States as well as the people and the busi-
 ness community and the Government of
 the people on Taiwan, the Republic of
 China. We made good strides in this bill.
 I am sure there will be some strength-
 ening amendments offered on the floor
 and that we will rapidly enact this leg-
 islation so that our friendship and trade
 with the Republic of, China on Taiwan
 and the people of Taiwan can continue
 and even increase.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
 tion occurs on the amendment of the
 Senator from Kansas.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I yield
 to the Senator from Ohio.
 Mr.  GLENN.  Mr.  President,  the
 'amendment suggested by the Senator
 from Kansas goes right to the very heart
 of what we have attempted to do in the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We
 have endeavored to make the American
 Institute on Taiwan an acceptable entity
 that could exist with the normalization
 of relations with the People's Republic
 of China. We have tried to make sure
 that the American Institute on Taiwan
 is acceptable to both parties-acceptable
 to the people on Taiwan and acceptable
 to the People's Republic of China. I think
 we have reached that balance. There
 have been those, of course, who have
 suggested that the people on Taiwan
 could declare their immediate independ-
 ance, a move to be a separate entity en-
 tirely. I do not think that would be pos-
 sible now. Some years ago, that might
 have been one of the options that the
 Republic of China might have wished to
 consider. But I think the situation now
 would be very muddled if that were the
 direction in which they were to go.
 As I see it, the amendment by the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Kansas would
 try to push a little bit in that direction.
 It tries to establish a separate entity by
 changing the language only this slight
 amount. Both sides of the street on Tai=-
 wan-the People's Republic of China
 and the Republic of China representa-
 tives-have said throughout the many
 years past that they are all part of one.
 China.
 One of the few things they have agreed
 upon has been that it is truly all one
 China. I think it would be a drastic mis-
 take if we went ahead and indicated it
 was other than the one China that both
 sides have said all along is the case.
 So I hope, Mr. President, that my
 colleagues in the Senate will sle fit to
 vote against this amendment.
 The committee, on page 8, already de-
 fines the inclusion of the governing au-
 thorities on Taiwan.
 I read that section which starts on
 line 19 of page 8 of the bill, as follows:
 (b) Except as provided in section 205(d)
 of this Act, the term "people on Taiwan",
 as used in this Act, shall mean and include
 the governing authority on Taiwan, recog-
 nized by the United States prior to January
 1, 1979 as the Republic of China; its agen-
 cies,  instrumentalities,  and political  sub-
 divisions; and the people governed by it in
 the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores.
 I think that is as clear a definition of
 the people on Taiwan and as meaningful
 a definition as anyone could come up
 with.
 To try to alter that to some piece
 of geography, to try to redefine it at
 this point, would really do gross violence '
 Co the bill-the normalization process
 we have brought forward.
 Mr. STONE. Will the Senator yield?
 Mr. GLENN. Certainly.
 Mr. STONE. Was it not the intention
 of our committee in this definition not
 to exclude the islands of Quemoy and
 Matsu for commercial purposes, but to
 exclude 'them for purposes of security,
 supporting assistance and security ques-
 tions?
 Mr. GLENN. It is my recollection that
 that type of situation which did not
 wish to give any military security guar-
 antees to Quemoy and Matsu, from which
 there have been artillery fire exchanged
 for many years with the mainland. We
 did not intend to inject ourselves into
 that type of situation which did not
 seem to be called for.
 But we did not preclude there being
 commercial arrangements with those
 islands as part of Taiwan's operation, if
 that was what they wanted.
 Mr. STONE. As the Senator from Ohio
 might recall, it was at that point in
 our discussion when I referred to the
 excellent pottery that is done on thel

 island of Quemoy and the great covered
 teapot with the handle I brought back
 from that island.
 Mr. GLENN. I recall the conversation.
 I would not vouch for the quality of the
 Senator's teapot.
 Mr. STONE. Not only that, but the tea
 it produces is excellent.
 I thank the Senator.
 Mr. JAVITS addressed the Chair.
 The  PRESIDING. OFFICER  (Mr.
 ExoN). The Senator from New York.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, first let
 it be noted, in respect to the previous
 colloquy, that the Mutual Defense Treaty
 'between the United States and the Re-
 public of China on Taiwan did not in-
 clude Quemoy and Matsu. So even if we
 sought to recreate it, we would leave
 'them out.
 The important point here is, question:
 It avails us nothing, why should we pro-
 voke the People's Republic of China
 when we are just trying to get started
 on some kind of better, more normal
 relationship?
 Yet that is exactly what this amend-
 ment, unfortunately, would do.
 I know my friend from Kansas and he
 will tell us that all he is doing is calling
 a spade a spade. But sometimes it is
 unnecessary to call a spade a spade,
 everybody knows it is a spade, everybody
 understands and sees it, why rub it in?
 That is all this is about.
 Our definition includes every human
 being, every corporation, every trust,
 everything that will be included if the
 amendment is approved, except that it
 does not irritate the People's Republic
 of China.
 Now, I would protest, I' would irritate
 them until the cows came home, if it
 meant anything. But it does not, so why
 do it?
 Second, if there is such a thing as
 propaganda in respect of these interna-
 tional affairs, and I believe there is a
 great deal of that, I think we are much
 better off dealing with the people on
 Taiwan than we are with Taiwan per se,
 for this reason: If Taiwan were governed
 by the people on Taiwan, then I would
 say, "Well, there's a lot to that case, but
 it is not." There are a good many Tai-
 wanese in that government now, but it is
 still governed essentially by the appara-
 tus that came over from the mainland
 in 1949.
 Therefore, when the issue is dealing
 with substantive questions and piercing
 the artificialities of legal concepts, and
 so forth, we really are dealing with the
 people on Taiwan. Therefore, that is, in
 my judgment, a far more accurate pic-
 turization of the intention and design of
 the issue than if we said Taiwan alone.
 So, in addition to the other arguments
 which have been made about the Shang-
 hai communique, which of course is a
 fact, the fact is that both Chiang Kai-
 shek and Mao Tse-tung agreed on one
 thing, that there is one China.
 The important point here is that we do
 not do anything for ourselves, and we
 unnecessarily irritate the other side.
 Last, and perhaps more decisive than
 anything else, this really is a more ac-
 curate description of what we are doing
 in this bill.
 Mr. STONE. Will the Senator yield?
 Mr. JAVITS. Yes.
 Mr. STONE. The Senator will recall
 that the Senator from New York and I
 made quite a fight in the committee early
 on to get a definition into this bill which
 said the Republic of China, because the
 bill that we were considering when.it
 came to us never said it. The most that
 was offered was some explanatory notes
 down in the committee report some-
 where, which would not have done it,
 which would not have carried it, and
 would have caused our friends on Taiwan
 unnecessarily to lose face for no purpose.
 So the Senator from New York, the
 leadership of our committee, and I
 worked very hard to get a definition that
 would do the job, and we have done that.
 Therefore, to alter it at this point might
 well just push the situation over the edge
 to the point where the .purpose to be
 served by friends of Taiwan might not
 practically be served.
 Now, I intended to support some of
 the strengthening amendments to our
 bill, such as I did when Senator PERCY
 offered his security amendment to the
 security issue at the committee level. But
 to tamper with this carefully drafted and
 redrafted and re-redrafted definition is
 at the root of this bill, I think, and I think
 the Senator from New York probably
 agrees with this, it would be a bad
 mistake for the friends and supporters
 of Taiwan.
 Mr. JAVITS. I agree.
 For the reasons which I have stated
 and which have been stated, Mr. Presi-
 dent, I hope the Senate will reject the
 amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Kansas.
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just
 take a minute.
 As I have said earlier, in compliment-
 ing the committee, I appreciate the ef-
 forts by all three Senators who have
 spoken.
 Certainly I would not want to provoke
 anyone or anything, but it seems to me
 it is just a matter of judgment.
 Their judgment has been quite good
 in some areas and perhaps it could be
 perfected by those of us who are not
 privileged to sit on the Committee on
 Foreign Relations.
 I noticed that the House version treats
 it differently. I do not know that any-
 body has been provoked by the action on
 the House side.
 It seems to me that we could adopt
 this amendment without doing violence
 to either our friends on Taiwan or the
 People's Republic of China. It does bring
 the language into -somewhat more line
 with the terminology used in the House
 version. It seems to me that it is sort of
 a clever way to pretend that we are not
 really dealing with a legal. entity or Gov-
 ernment on Taiwan.
 I have no further points ti make. It
 might be a good first vote, to see what
 the temperature is in the Senate with

 therefore I ask for the yeas and nays.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there

 The yeas and nays were ordered.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 question is on agreeing to the amend-
 ment of the Senator from Kansas. On

 CONGRESSIONAL RIECORD- S7ENAT]E           Alarch. 7, 1979
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will report.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 read as follows:
 The Senator from New York (Mr. JAVrrs)
 for himself and Mr. STONE proposes an un-
 printed amendment numbered 28:
 On page 12, at the end of line 12. insert
 the following:
 For the purposes of this section 111, the
 term "people on Taiwan" includes organiza-
 tions and other entities formed under the
 law applied on Taiwan.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I believe
 this amendment will be acceptable, and
 I would like to explain it to the Senate.
 The purpose of the amendment is to
 make clear that the term "people on
 Tah7an" as used in section 111 includes
 organizations and other entities formed
 under the law applied on Taiwan, as well
 as natural persons and the authorities on
 Taiwan. The result of the proposed
 amendment is thus to avoid any implica-
 tion of a diminution of the rights and
 obligations of corporations and other
 nongovernmental entities on Taiwan.
 Section 101(a) was adopted in order
 to make it clear that the power of suing
 and being sued in the courts of the
 United States-
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, may we
 have order?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ate will be in order. We will have order
 in the Senate.
 The Chair recognizes once again the
 Senator from New York.
 Mr. JAVITS. Shall not be affected by
 the fact that the United States has recog-
 nized the People's Republic of China, and
 the right of action in all of these cases
 is already preserved both by the defini-
 tion of what we mean by "the people on
 Taiwan" contained in section 101(b) , and
 also by other provisions of this act which
 relate to the preservation of all rights in
 both people on Taiwan as defined to
 mean the "governing authority on Tai-
 wan recognized by the United States prior
 to January 1, 1979 as the Republic of
 China; its agencies, instrumentalities,
 and political subdivisions; and the people
 governed by it in the islands of Taiwan
 and the Pescadores."
 This amendment is intended to make
 it clear that, in section 111 when we
 speak of agencies, instrumentalities, and
 political subdivisions, we not only refer
 to the governing authority on Taiwan,
 heretofore known as the Republic of
 China, as well as the people governed
 by it but we refer also to all forms of
 nonofficial, nongovernmental artificial
 persons,  legal  entities,  corporations,
 trusts,  and  other  entities   organized
 under the law applicable on Taiwan.
 In order to make that crystal clear, the
 banks and other enterprises which hold
 important assets of those entities believe
 that this particular provision should be
 included, to remove any possibility of
 wrong inferences being drawn in respect
 of any potential actions at law.
 I think the amendment only buttresses
 what we have already said, and I hope
 it may prove acceptable to the other
 manager of the bill.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ate will please be in order. The Chair
 recognizes the Senator from Ohio.
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the Sena-
 tor from New York and the Senator from
 Florida, in proposing this amendment, I
 think, have done an excellent job in
 bringing to our attention a fact on
 which the committee probably did not
 put sufficient stress, American interests
 in Taiwan. Our trade with Taiwan was
 $7.2 billion-last year, and it is expected
 to reach $9 billion to $10 billion in 1979,
 $500 million in private investment in
 Taiwan.
 So I think, in advancing this in the
 interests of financial stability and in the
 interests of the banking community that
 deals back and forth on a daily basis in
 these huge numbers in Taiwan, I am
 quite willing to accept this, and I think
 it is a good addition to our legislation.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, may I
 say that Senator STONE made his argu-
 ment for this amendment when he made
 his speech a little while ago, which im-
 mediately preceded action on the preced-
 ing amendment.
 We are ready to vote.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
 tion is on agreeing to the amendment
 of the Senator from New York.
 The amendment was agreed to.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I move
 to reconsider the vote by which the
 amendment was agreed to.
 Mr. HELMS. I move to lay that motion
 on the table.
 The motion to lay on the table was
 agreed to.
 Mr. JAVITS. I thank the Chair.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I believe
 the distinguished Senator from New
 Hampshire  (Mr. HUMPHREY)  has an
 amendment, and I will yield to him.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
 recognizes the  Senator  from  New
 Hampshire.
 UP AMENDMENT NO. 29
 Mr. HUMPHREY. I thank the Senator
 from North' Carolina.
 Mr. President, I send an amendment
 to the desk and ask that it be stated.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will report.
 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr.
 HUMPHREY)  proposes an unprinted amend-
 ment numbered 29.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that further reading
 of the amendment be dispensed with.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 'The amendment is as follows:
 On page 8, line 19, strike out "section 205
 (d)" and insert "subsection (c) :
 "For the purpose of applying section 102
 of this Act to the Internal Revenue Code of
 1954, and to any regulation, ruling, decision.
 or other determination under such Code,
 the term "people on Taiwan" shall mean the
 governing authority on Taiwan recognized
 by the United States prior to January 1,
 1979, as the Republic of China and its agen-
 cies, instrumentalities, the political subdivi-
 sions; except that when such term is used
 in a geographical sense it shall mean the is-
 lands of Taiwan and the Pescadores."
 On page 10, strike section 106(a) and in-
 sert the following new subsection (a) :
 "Programs, transactions, and other rela-
 tions conducted or carried out by the Presi-
 dent or any department or agency of the
 United States Government with repsect to
 the people on Taiwan shall, in the manner
 and to the extent directed by the President,
 be conducted and ,carried out by or through
 the Liaison Office to the Republic of China
 (hereinafter 'the Liaison Office'). Under such
 terms and conditions as are consonant with
 the purposes of this Act, the President shall
 extend, or enter into an agreement extend-
 ing, to the Liaison Office to be established in
 the United States of America by the Republic
 of China, and to-the members thereof, the
 same privileges and immunities subject to
 the corresponding conditions and obligations
 as are enjoyed by diplomatic missions ac-
 credited to the United States and members
 thereof, upon the condit'lon that privileges
 and immunities are extended on a reciprocal
 basis to the United States, Liaison Office on
 Taiwan at no less than the level etablished
 herein.'.'
 Strike "Institute" wherever it shall appear
 and insert in lieu thereof "Liaison Office".
 On page 10, strike out section 106(b).
 Beginning on page 16, line 1, strike all
 through page 20, line 6.
 On page 20, line 17, after the word "Tai-
 wan", strike out "on an unofficial basis".
 Beginning on line 18, strike all through page
 21, line 4.
 On page 22, strike out subsection (b) and
 insert in lieu thereof:
 "(b) For purposes of subsection (a), the
 term 'agreement' includes any agreement
 entered into between the Liason Office and
 the Taiwan authorities or the instrumen-
 tality established by the Taiwanese author-
 ities."
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, may we
 ask the Senator a question in connection
 with this amendment? I note the Sena-
 tor's amendment affects different parts
 of the bill. Is it all one idea or are they
 different.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. It is one idea, one
 field.
 Mt. JAVITS. I thank the Senator.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
 recognizes  the  Senator  from   New
 Hampshire.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, over
 the years, many polls have been taken
 on the attitude of the American people
 toward the China issue. One consistent
 result has been opposition by a majority
 of Americans toward the recognition of
 mainland China at the expense of the
 Republic of China. Flying in the face of
 the will of the people, the administra-
 tion has taken just this action, and we
 have been brought here now, not to put
 the finishing touches on the policy that
 will best protect the security of the west-
 ern Pacific area, but to salvage what-
 ever is possible to insure the survival of
 the Republic of China as a free nation.
 Next to the question of recognition
 itself, the most important matter to be
 determined is the legal nature of our new
 relations, given the absence of recogni-
 tion. Thus, today I am introducing an
 amendment which would eliminate the
 While House's planned American In-
 stitute on Taiwan  and establish in-
 stead government-to-government rela-
 tions through an official U.S. Liaison
 Office in Taiwan.
 Mr. President, there are a -number Of
 reasons which can be given in favor o$
 this change, and which I will describe
 during the course of my remarks. But
 the first and most powerful argument
 is that of simple fairness.

 China were conducted through a liaison

 Prof. Ray Cline of the Georgetown In-
 stitute on Strategic and International
 Studies, in his testimony before the Sen-
 ate Foreign Relations Committee, de-
 scribed the President's proposal as "a
 Chinese fortune cookie baked by Com-
 munist Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
 It is being handed to you by the White
 House and the State Department, but
 the message inside was written by
 Peking." it is preposterous that we would
 be allowing the People's Republic. of
 China to dictate our policy toward Tai-
 wan; to say that we have no recourse as
 the President seems to imply, is a sad
 statement on our national decline from.
 power.
 In many ways it is particularly unfor-
 tunate to make Taiwan the victim of our
 deteriorating foreign policy. The Repub-
 lic of China has been an unswervingly
 loyal ally of the United States, dismissing,
 the benefits which might have accrued
 to, it from an informal alliance with the
 Soviet Union against the Chinese main-
 land.
 I might add, Mr.. President, that while
 I was in Taiwan some weeks ago, some
 of us asked a. high official of the Republic
 of China why they had not played their
 "Russian card."
 Their answer was, "You may have
 given up your principles, but we have

 they now enjoy.. It would be reprehen-
 sible for the United States to take any
 actions that endanger. the benefits they
 have worked so long to reach.

 It can be argued that the Republic of      Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and
 China's recent acceptance of the Ameri-
 can Institute on Taiwan obviates any
 need for further discussion of govern-
 ment-to-government relations. Such a
 position, however, ignores many of the
 facts. From the time of the President's
 announcement on December 15, the Re-
 public of China Government took the
 firm position that nothing less than rela-
 tions at an official level would be ade-
 quate. It continued to hold staunchly to
 this position for 2 months. When it
 finally softened its stand, it was only
 days away from the March 1 deadline
 for the old relations to lapse. With so
 much at stake, including the possibility
 that the old ties would be replaced by an
 absolute vacuum, it is safe to presume
 that the Republic of China was in no
 position to bargain. Even now, however,
 its official position remains that govern-
 ment-to-government relations would be
 preferable.
 Mr. President, all this amendment
 seeks to do is insert some degree of fair-
 ness in our future relations with Taiwan.
 If it was proper to have government-to-
 government relations' with the People's
 Republic of China at a time when we did
 not recognize its government, it can be
 no less proper to have such ties with the
 Republic of China now that we have
 withdrawn recognition from it. To have
 an agency that in every way acts like a
 government agency but which we are
 supposed to pretend is a private entity is
 a sham, and a slap in the face at a loyal
 ally. We should not let the concerns of
 mainland China establish the priorities
 for American foreign policy.
 Mr. President, the essence of S. 245 is
 the acknowledgment by this body of
 Peking's claim to Taiwan. Those who

 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair

 Mr. HELMS. What the Senator is say-
 ing, in effect, is that we had a liaison of-
 flee previously in Red, China, and that
 was at the time we were recognizing Tai-
 wan. Now it is -just why not the reverse?
 Mr. HUMPHREY. That is correct. We
 had a liaison office in Peking. Now the
 question is why should we do less for our
 friends than we did for our Communist
 adversaries.
 Mr. HELMS. I will say to the distin-
 guished Senator that a great many
 Americans are asking that question today
 in connection with the legislation pend-
 ing before the Senate. Again, I commend
 the Senator from New Hampshire for
 his amendment.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I believe
 the first thing to be said about the
 amendment is that we cannot force the
 Taiwanese to say that there are two
 Chinas. They have consistently held to
 their view that it has been only one
 China, although they were on the island
 and there were some nearly 1 billion
 other people of Chinese heritage on the
 mainland. They have consistently agreed
 that there were not two Chinas.
 The difference between the situation
 with the liaison office in Peking and the
 liaison office on Taiwan is very simply
 one of acceptance by boah parties. In
 the previous situation, when we have
 maintained an Embassy on Taiwan and
 a liaison office in Peking.
 linating Council on North American Af-
 fairs, and which will also serve as coun-
 terpart of our American Institute on
 Taiwan.
 I think that the bill we have here, Mr.
 President, has achieved everything short
 of the official ? relations that the distin-
 guished Senator might wish to provide.
 We are providing immunities and arms
 sales. At this point, it seems to me that
 to upset it by mandating a liaison office
 on Taiwan would only rupture the entire
 agreement and, in fact, work to the detri-
 ment of the people on Taiwan.
 We had a discussion earlier this after-
 noon of the current status of the people
 on Taiwan. They are in limbo of sorts be-
 cause we do not have a replacement for
 the embassy, we do not have the Ameri-
 can Institute, and we do not have the ap-
 propriations or authorization to trans-
 fer the formal embassy funds over to op-
 erating that institute. In fact, our trade
 and commerce that we have right now is
 in fact in limbo and operating on a day-
 to-day basis until we get this new in-
 stitute established.           -
 I would hope that we would not see fit
 to take a chance of rupturing this entire
 agreement. I think it would stand an ex-
 cellent chance of not only being vetoe&
 once we finish our work on it, but I think
 it would stand an excellent chance of
 being turned down by the People's Re-
 public of China-even perhaps the peo-
 ple on Taiwan.
 I have had two groups visit me in the
 last few weeks from Taiwan and they are,
 very much concerned that we begin to
 make this new relationship work, and
 that our trade patterns not be unduly in-
 terrupted with Taiwan.
 I am sure that the people of Taiwan
 would not agree with upsetting things
 any further than they have already been
 upset.
 Furthermore, one last argument I
 think is key. U.S. interests have to come
 to the fore today. Our best interests in
 this country are certainly not served by
 twisting the tail of the PRC or furthering
 any disagreement with them., Since the
 people on Taiwan have accepted this new
 relationship and are trying to make it
 work, I think we would be well advised to
 go along with. what has been provided in
 this bill and not upset it by trying to re-
 establish an official diplomatic relation-
 ship, even. at the low level of a liaison of-
 fice, which this amendment would do.,,
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
 recognizes the Senator from New York.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, naturally,
 this amendment could be divided. It is
 perhaps improper to apply it to the whole
 act.
 For example, it has within it the state-
 ment, "strike 'institute' wherever it shall
 appear and insert in lieu -thereof 'liaison
 office.' " I assume that means through-
 out the bill. It could be objected to as to
 form and so forth, but I have no desire to
 do that, and I will not. That is why I ask
 the Senator if it is one idea. If it is, we
 will vote on it as one concept and there
 is no point in fractionating it.
 I am opposed to the concept because,

 lion people in the world with whom we
 enjoy no effective relationship except by
 sufferance of a liaison office, which was
 understood to be a threshold proposition
 leading toward a normalization of rela-
 tions which was so established. Indeed, I
 wish to refresh the Senate on a little bit
 of that history.
 The fact is that this subject of a re-
 view of our policy with the People's Re-
 public of China was first broached in
 1970. I had the honor in that year to
 be the delegate from the Senate to the
 United Nations General Assembly. The
 speech which I wrote on that occasion
 called for review of our China policy.
 President Nixon endorsed that speech.
 He then went further in 1971 by seeking
 normalization with the People's Repub-
 li0 of China, and then making his fa-
 mous trip to Peking preceded by that of
 Dr. Kissinger, which first opened the
 door to the possibility of normalization.
 The liaison office was a step in that
 process. It was not an isolated thing, nor
 was it a post script to another relation-
 ship, like what it would be with Taiwan.
 (Mr. TSONGAS assumed the chair.)
 Mr. JAVITS. It was an original action
 leading up to another state of relation-
 ships between us and. the People's Re-
 public of China, which has now been
 consummated. So let us not live in a
 dream world. We have decided not to
 butter up the People's Republic. They
 could not care less whether we-butter
 them up or not. I think we will be treat-
 ing them rather roughly in days ahead,
 just as they will be treating us. I assure
 you, you will not see the end of acerbic.
 criticism in the United Nations or else-
 where by the People's Republic of us, nor
 by us of them, any more than you see it
 with the Soviet Union.
 But any illusion that we are in some
 alliance with the People's Republic of
 China is, in my judgment, out of the
 question.. I would not be for it if that
 were the case. I do not want an alliance
 with the People's Republic of China, but
 I want access to them and I want an op-
 portunity to deal with them as I would
 deal with any other country. And I want
 a representative in Peking with as much
 standing and authority as the Russian
 ambassador has.
 I should like to open up China to jour-
 nalists, travelers, trade and cultural in-
 terchange in a way that is only halting
 and inadequate when it is left. to the liai-
 son office concept. That is why we are
 doing this. We are not doing this to suit
 them, we are doing it to suit us.
 It was clearly written into the contract
 which we are now making in terms of
 recognition that we would accept the
 special status of Taiwan as they would.
 This is not a one-way street. There is
 nothing that would prevent the People's
 Republic of China from trying to suffo-
 cate Taiwan tomorrow, causing us to in-
 voke the mutual defense treaty, I think
 every Senator who wants to vote for this
 had better understand that this calls off
 the deal. That it is not the deal we made.
 It could be right, it could be wrong. It
 could only be semantics or it might be
 rear. But that is the deal we made. So
 if you want to normalize relations with
 the People's Republic of China, you can-
 not vote for this amendment. If you do
 not, vote for it, by all means.
 I think it is very unwise. I think we
 should normalize. I think that is essen-
 tial to our own future. in the world. But
 if you do not want to do it, this is an
 ideal opportunity to dump it. That is the
 realistic part of this equation.
 As to the mechanics of the liaison
 office, I think it is very clear that we have
 had a liaison office with the People's Re-
 public by arrangement. That arrange-
 ment was a step in the direction of nor-
 malization. That does not equate with a
 liaison office with Taiwan, because as
 far as Taiwan is concerned, that would
 be substituted for an embassy, which is
 what we had before. That would really be
 an artificial smokescreen. It would have
 the same rights, the same privileges, the
 same duties, except we call it a liaison
 office. So it defies the whole objective,
 which is to recognize what both Chiang
 Kai-shek and Mao Tse-tung always con-
 tended-that is, that there is one China,
 and Taiwan is a province of China-
 but, at the same time, to protect the eco-
 nomic and social and, indeed, political
 system. on Taiwan.
 I think it is. a fair settlement and a
 settlement highly in the interests of the
 United States. We feel just as strongly,
 and we made it clear to the People's Re-
 public when we did the deal, that we are
 going to supply them with arms, but we
 are not going to let them be subdued by
 force, direct or indirect. We told the
 People's Republic, "If you try it, you take
 us on." Would they not have the right to
 say the same thing to us? It is not up to
 us to say that they are arbitrary in not
 tolerating this as an amendment to the
 deal, which they will not.
 So, in my judgment, we have to make
 the fundamental decision. That is the
 fundamental decision. That is their part
 of the bargain. We are getting our part
 of the bargain. We are getting in there
 on a. reconized and established basis.
 Their part of the barain is that we
 should not have an official relationship
 of an embassy or what is tantamount to
 an embassy with the people on Taiwan.
 In my judgment, we have very carefully
 architected a bill which does everything
 in substance that we need to do without
 invalidating the deal. I think the deal is
 so desirable in the national interests of
 United States that I do not want to see
 it invalidated.
 Therefore, Mr. President, I am against
 this amendment and I hope very much
 that it will be rejected.
 Mr. HATCH and Mr. GLENN ad-
 dressed the Chair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Ohio is recognized. .
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, at the ap-
 propriate time, I shall move to table the
 amendment. I do not want to shut off
 debate now. I just want to notify my col-
 leagues that I shall move to table it.
 Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to
 compliment the distinguished Senator
 from New Hampshire for. his approach
 here. Frankly, one of the arguments
 which has been used by proponents of
 normalization-and I should set the rec-
 ord straight; I am for normalization of
 relations with mainland China, but not
 S 2141
 at the cost of abdicating our responsibili-
 ties to the people of Taiwan. I think it
 is a failure on our part- not to recognize
 900 million people in this World. But I
 think there is a way of doing that with-
 out necessarily kicking our friends in the
 teeth or acting in ways which some peo-
 ple in our society, and throughout the
 world have considered to be dishonorable.
 As I understand it, all the distin-
 guished Senator from New Hampshire is
 asking is that we have a very simple
 process of a liaison office in Taiwan to
 show that we have not totally rejected
 these people;, that we have not, in our
 abrogation of the treaty with them, for-
 gotten that. they exist;, that we do have
 respect for them and that we should, at
 least, give them some benefit when you
 consider that we have done the same for
 the mainland Chinese for some years
 since President Nixon allowed it to occur.
 I do not think establishing a liaison
 office necessarily, has, to destroy the rela-
 tionship with mainland China. I am not
 sure that that argument, really should be
 offered.. But if that is: the way it is, then,
 as far as I am concerned,, sa be it, because
 that is not too much to ask of this great
 Nation, to recognize that we do have a
 moral commitment, to the people on Tai-
 wan and that a. liaison office may help us
 to keep, those moral commitments alive
 and the trade relationship which has ex-
 isted in response to those moral commit-
 ments and many promises through the
 years in a good legal status.
 I should like to join as. a. cosponsor in
 this amendment. It is not with a desire to
 scuttle any reasonable recognition of the
 mainland Chinese; it. is with a, desire not
 to scuttle the moral commitment that we
 have to the people on Taiwan, and our
 desire to recognize that we have entered
 into some 59. trade agreements with them
 in response to., many moral commitments
 by many Presidents of this country who
 have indicated that we will not let them
 down, that they will always be our
 friends, and that we will always be com-
 mitted to them.
 In my humble opinion, we have let
 them down, and to not even have a liai-
 son office,. it seems to me;. in our fear that
 we might not be able to sell Coca-Cola or
 have business, or even have a political
 relationship, which would be higher than
 the prior two categories with the people
 of mainland China would be, I think, is
 pretty shortsighted. on our part.
 Ihave also been interested in the argu-
 ment which has always been made by
 those who are proponents of recognition
 of mainland China that both Taiwan
 and mainland China want a one-China
 policy. Well, that is hardly the way to
 put it. I think that that is. an overglossing
 of what both of them want. Taiwan
 wants a one.-China policy as long as Tai-
 wan controls that. one. China. Mainland
 China wants a. ones-Chin& policy so long
 as mainland China controls that one
 China. As I view it ethically, philosophi-
 cally, and mathematically, that means a
 two-China policy, because there are two
 different entities: here who. want to be
 dominant and who- want. to control that
 one China.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE           March 7, 1979
 that they would be dissatisfied with this
 amendment. As.a matter of fact, I had
 great reason to believe that they would
 be very pleased, under present circum-
 stances, that we would favor them to this
 limited extent, especially since we have
 disfavored them to such a great degree.
 I do not care what anybody says about
 this issue; we all have to look at it with,
 at least a certain degree of shame-the
 way it occurred, the timing in which it
 occurred, the process in which it oc-
 curred, the zealous approach to achiev-
 ing economic advantage, and the loss of
 prestige which has inevitably resulted.
 I would like to see this simple amend-
 ment passed. I do not think it would de-
 stroy our relationship with Teng Hsiao-
 ping. If it does, then it seems to me that
 relationship is too tenuous to begin with.
 I do not think the U.S. Senate needs to
 clamor after it, the satisfactions desired
 so much-by Teng Hsiao-ping and other
 leaders on mainland China. Nor should
 we ignore the responsibilities we have,
 perhaps, to recognize mainland China
 just because some people on Taiwan feel
 that that should never have occurred.
 I think there has to be balance in this
 matter and the problem, as I see it, is
 that we do not have a balance. We have
 a one-sided view, a one-sided philosophy,
 controlled by those who are, it seems to
 me, desirous of establishing this relation-
 ship at ? all costs under the present
 circumstances.
 Who am I to criticize that viewpoint
 because my fellow Senators did not
 create these circumstances?
 We now have to resolve what has been
 a fait accompli by an administration
 which disregarded the prestigious Sen-
 ators on the Hill and the prestigious
 Members of Congress who had made a
 very important request prior to our ad-
 journment of the 95th Congress, and that
 request was simply to be consulted before
 the President normalized relationships
 with mainland China.
 What bothers me is that not only were
 we not consulted, but it was so flagrant
 in the way we lacked consultation, and,*
 in process, we have fallen all over our-
 selves to support this one-sided approach,
 to the  detriment  of  our long-term
 friends, and I think to the greater detri-
 ment of ourselves, in the spirit of world
 peace.
 I really believe the Senator from New
 Hampshire, for his first amendment on
 the floor of the Senate, can be very proud
 as he stood up for principle, albeit a very
 reasonable, modest request, after the fait
 accompli has occurred.
 I think he deserves praise for that and
 he deserves, I think, support for that.
 As a freshman Senator, I know, how
 difficult it is to stand up and bring forth
 a first amendment.
 This is no earth-shaking amendment.
 All it is, is a simple recognition that we
 have to continue business, we have to
 continue a modest relationship, we have
 to continue to try to be moral with regard
 to the people on Taiwan. Perhaps the
 best legal way to do it without totally
 slapping mainland China in the face, be-
 cause nobody wants to do that, is to have
 a liaison office, a simple liaison office
 which we have already established a
 precedent for in mainland China.
 I commend the Senator from New
 Hampshire. I hope this will be the first in
 a great number of well thought-out
 amendments which may very well do a
 great deal to help our country to be
 morally secure and more acceptable in
 the world of nations and among our fel-
 lowmen, especially in this country, send-
 ing a message to both Taiwan and Main-
 land China, which I consider to be not
 only a reasonable message, but an es-
 sential message.
 I ask unanimous consent that I be
 added as a cosponsor on this amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.

 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, what we
 are doing in this Senate is this: we are
 playing a game with Taiwan. It is called,
 "Heads Peking wins, tails Taiwan loses."
 No other face can be put on it.
 I say that with all due respect to my
 friends who differ on this issue, but I
 think there are several things that need
 to be clarified. There has even been an
 attempt to blame Taiwan for the intem-
 perate actions of U.S. policy.
 For  example,  some  administration
 apologists have glossed over history with
 respect to the diplomatic history of Tai-
 wan and asserting that Taiwan has been
 "adamant" with respect to the one-China
 concept.
 Now, historically, the position that
 Taiwan has been taking is that there is
 one China with two governments claim-
 ing to be sovereign. But from a practi-
 cal standpoint Taiwan has tacitly ad-
 mitted that the Government of the Re-
 public of China does not control the
 mainland. If we forget that, then we
 are implicitly saying, "Well, there is
 nothing to this business of East Ger-
 many and West Germany, there is noth-
 ing to this business of North Korea and
 South Korea," and so forth. The impli-
 cation of that is very clear, I think, to
 millions of Americans who are already
 concerned about the sell-out of Taiwan
 and the failure by the President of the
 United States or his advisers-and I hope
 it was the latter-even to have the cour-
 age to negotiate on the question of our
 relationship with both Chinese Govern-
 ments.
 Mr. President, I had the unpleasant
 duty of voting against Mr. Woodcock as
 first Ambassador to Peking. I did that
 out of no personal aversion to Mr. Wood-
 cock. He is a very pleasant gentleman,
 very intelligent. But he sat in my office
 and he made clear that the judgment
 had been made not even to raise the
 question of the use of force against Tai-
 wan, let alone the continued recognition
 of Taiwan.
 But does any Senator on this floor
 know how such a negotiation would have
 come out? Just suppose we had main-
 tained the integrity of our commitment
 to our friend and ally, Taiwan? I am con-
 cerned that there was no need, let alone
 any moral excuse, for selling out our
 friend and ally. Moreover, nothing could
 be clearer than the fact that China-Red
 China-needed us-not the other way
 around.
 But a more important question is, how
 timid are we going to be as a Nation?
 Have we reached the point that we are
 trembling and fearful in a diplomatic
 confrontation with a Communist country
 that we do not even bring up the issues
 we consider important, no matter how
 much morality is involved in it, no mat-
 ter how much obligation we have to a
 loyal friend and ally?
 My own gut instinct about it, Mr.
 President, is that America has shamed-.
 itself before the world, and I do not blame
 the few remaining friends that we have
 for wondering what will happen to
 them-and I include Israel and Lebanon,
 South Africa, Japan, and even Europe7
 in that.
 But this glossing over of Taiwan's
 position with respect to "one China"
 needs to be examined a little bit more
 closely than it has been on this floor.
 I have at hand the November-Decem-
 ber issue of a publication known as
 "Asian Affairs and American Review."
 The edition is dated November-December
 1977, a year before the ill-considered de-
 cision by President Carter to break rela-
 tions with Taiwan.
 Like the Senator from Utah, I have
 no objection to recognizing the reality of
 Red China. I do not know of any Senator
 who does. My problem is what the Presi-
 dent has done to Taiwan.
 In this issue of "Asian Affairs and
 American Review," is an article entitled
 "Normalizing  Relations  with  China:
 Some Practical and Legal Problems,"
 by Hungdah Chiu, who is a professor of
 law at the University of Maryland School
 of Law. On page 72, Professor Chiu has
 this to say, with respect to the position
 that Taiwan has taken concerning one
 China :
 Now let us turn to the PRC's claim to
 Taiwan. While the legal  arguments sum-
 marized above would support the ROC's
 claim to Taiwan, the same arguments would
 not support the PRC's claim to Taiwan, for
 several reasons. In the first place, the PRC
 has denied the validity of both Japanese
 peace treaties mentioned above. On August
 15, 1951, before the San Francisco treaty was
 signed, Premier Chou En-lai denounced the
 proposed treaty as "illegal, and therefore null
 and void." On May 5, 1952, after the treaty
 entered into force, Chou again repudiated
 it as "completely illegal." Peking can hardly
 claim any benefit from a document which
 it considers to be "illegal and void." More-
 over, after Japan's renunciation of its claim,
 to Taiwan, the PRC could not acquire title
 over the island through the international
 law principle of occupation, because it had
 no. physical  control  over  the  island.  Nor
 could the PRC act through the ROC occupa-
 tion to claim title over Taiwan because it
 considers the ROC government to be an "il-
 legal group" or even "bandits." Clearly, a
 government    can  no  more  claim    benefits
 through a regime which it does not recog-
 nize as legal than it can through a docu-
 ment which it has declared illegal and void.
 Some PRC writers have argued that be-
 cause Taiwan was originally Chinese terri-
 tory, a peace treaty is not necessary to trans-
 fer title back to China, especially since the
 Treaty of  Shimonoseki ceding Taiwan to
 Japan was abrogated as a result of the out-
 break of the Second Sino-Japanese War in
 1937. International practice, however, does

 March 7, 1979
 not support the Chinese position. The pro-
 vinces of Alsace and Lorraine, for example,
 were originally French territory, but were
 ceded to Germany in 1871. Subsequently,
 they were returned to France through the
 Treaty of Versailles signed between the Allied
 and Associated Powers  (including France)
 and Germany on June 28, 1919. In other
 words, French sovereignty over its former
 territory did not automatically revert after
 World War I, but required the formal treaty
 mechanism. There does not appear to be any
 precedent or principle of international law
 supporting the PRC position that on Octo-
 be 25, 1945, Taiwan was restored to China
 de jure and de facto.
 If this is correct, then the PRO's claim
 is primarily based on the theory of historical
 irredentism. PRC writers and officials have
 frequently argued that Taiwan is historically
 Chinese; and that during the Japanese oc-
 cupation (1895-1945), the people of Taiwan
 longedo for reunification with China. But
 while this is an undoubted historical fact, it
 can hardly support the PRC's claim to Tai-
 wan today. In the first place, during the
 period of Japanese occupation, China was
 run by a government which permitted a free
 enterprise economy, and society was rela-
 tively free. If the people of Taiwan had
 known at the time that mainland China
 would become the totalitarian, highly regi-
 mented society it is today, it is unlikely that
 they would have longed so fervently for re-
 unification. The fact that very few people
 from Taiwan participated in the Communist
 movement in China during the Japanese oc-
 cupation period seems to support this point.
 And today, it seems abundantly clear that
 the vast majority of the people on Taiwan
 do not want to be united with the PRC.
 Second, according to Edgar Snow, who was
 a close friend, Mao Tse-tung himself did not
 include Taiwan among China's "lost terri-
 tories" to be regained from Japan. In an
 interview at Yenan on July 16, 1936, Mao
 said: "If the Koreans wish to break away
 from the chains of Japanese imperialism,
 we will extend them our enthusiastic help
 in their struggle for independence.  The
 same thing applies for Formosa." Third, the
 doctrine of self-determination is now an
 accepted principle of international law, and
 one that has not been opposed by the PRC.
 This principle would certainly overrule any
 historical claim of the PRC toward Taiwan,
 since the great majority of. the people of
 Taiwan now clearly oppose unification with
 the PRO.
 In the 1972 Shanghai Communique, the
 United States declared: The United States
 acknowledges that all Chinese on either side
 of Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one
 China and Taiwan is a part of China. The
 United States government does not
 chal- lenge that position.
 Some people have argued that the United
 States has thereby accepted the PRO's claim
 to Taiwan in the Shanghai Communique.
 But this is certainly not true. The phrase
 "does not challenge" is not equivalent to a
 recognition of the PRC claim. This interpre-
 tation was also confirmed by a high official
 of the US government. Soon after the issu-
 ance of the Shanghai Communique, Assist-
 ant Secretary of State for East Asian and
 Pacific Affairs Marshall Green denied that it
 represented any change in the position held
 by the United States since 1950, namely, that
 the status of Taiwan was as yet undeter-
 mined. Moreover, it was disclosed recently
 that at the time of negotiating the Shanghai
 Communique, then Secretary of State Kissin-
 ger wanted to accept the PRC's position on
 Taiwan by stating in the Communique that
 the United States "accepts" rather than
 "does  not  challenge"  the  belief of "all
 Chinese" in one China. But he was rebuffed
 in that attempt, possibly by President Nixon.
 A question closely related to the legal
 CONGRESSIONAL RIECOR
 - SENATE
 status of Taiwan is the ROC's claim to the
 mainland of China. If the ROC continued
 to make an unconditional claim to sov-
 ereignty over the mainland now controlled
 by the PRC, then, despite the special legal
 status of Taiwan, there would be no reason
 to question the PRC for making a similarly
 unconditional  claim  to  sovereignty  over
 Taiwan.
 I interject to say that that is merely
 plain  commonsense.       Professor    Chiu
 continues :
 Since its removal to Taiwan, however, the
 ROC has gradually imposed important limi-
 tations on its claim to the mainland. In the
 first place, treaties which were formerly ap-
 plicable to all of China were tacitly revised
 to limit their application to Taiwan. For in-
 stance, the 1946 treaty of friendship, com-
 merce, and navigation between the United
 States and the Republic of China has not
 been applicable to mainland China since the
 early 1950s.11 Similarly, new treaties or agree-
 ments concluded since 1950 have all been
 limited in their application to the Taiwan
 52143
 history proves what Taiwan's position
 has been.
 No matter what we do about the Tai-
 wan issue, let us at least be fair to Tai-
 wan. Let us be historically accurate as
 to Taiwan's position. We have done
 enough to a great ally by the abrogation
 of the mutual defense treaty. We have
 done enough to the people on Taiwan by
 turning our backs on them. Let us not
 compound the problem by misrepresent-
 ing the history of Taiwan's position.
 So again I compliment my friend from
 New Hampshire for submitting this
 amendment, his first amendment in his
 career as a U.S. Senator and his en-
 lightening elucidation of it. It is a good
 amendment; it is a simple amendment.
 The amendment simply says, "Let us
 treat one government as we have treated
 the other. We had a liaison office in
 Peking when we  did not  recognize
 Peking. So now that the President, in
 area. For example, the 1954 mutual defense . his wisdom-or lack of it-has broken
 treaty with the United States provides in - relations with Taiwan, let us at least be
 Article VI: "For the purposes of Articles II
 and V, the terms 'territorial' and 'territories'
 shall mean in respect of the Republic of
 China, Taiwan and the Pescadores."
 Second, the ROC has pledged, in an ex-
 change of notes accompanying the 1954 mu-
 tual defense treaty, not to use force against
 the mainland without the consent of the
 United States. Third, in a joint communique
 issued by President Chiang Kai-shek and
 US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
 on October .23, 1958, the ROC publicly made
 a more general pledge not to use force
 against the mainland. It states:
 The government of the Republic of China
 considers that the restoration of freedom to
 its people on the mainland is its sacred mis-
 sion. It believes that the foundation of this
 mission resides in the minds and the hearts
 of the Chinese people, and that the principal
 means of successfully achieving its mission
 is the implementation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's
 three   people's  principles   (nationalism,
 democracy, and social well-being), and not
 the use of force.
 This pledge of the nonuse of force to
 achieve national unification was confirmed.
 recently by a statement of the ROC Foreign
 Minister, Shen Chang-huan, on July 1, 1977,
 in which be said:
 It has been the consistent position of the
 government of the Republic of China to carry
 out its responsibility of delivering our 800
 million   compatriots   from   Communist
 tyranny by political means, while the Chin-
 ese Communists have never given up their
 design to "liberate" Taiwan by force. The
 "peace settlement" theme being harped on
 on by the Chinese Communists is but an at-
 tempt on their part to forcibly impose their
 tyrannical rule on the 16 million Chinese
 on Taiwan.
 In view of the above analysis, it seems
 clear that the ROC has, in fact, suspended its
 claim to the Chinese mainland by renounc-
 ing the use of force to achieve unification.
 The PRC, however, still insists on the use of
 force to "liberate" Taiwan-a territory to
 which it does not have a clear legal title.
 Such "liberation" by force is prohibited by
 international law, and by the Charter of the
 United Nations, as an attempt to vindicate a
 claim to territory by the use of force.
 So I say to the Senator from New
 Hampshire: How does any Senator in
 this body get away with saying, "Oh,
 well, Taiwan was adamant that there
 would be one China and so there had to
 be one China or nothing"? The trouble
 with that is that it simply is not so, and
 as fair to our friends on Taiwan, and
 have a liaison office there."
 What is wrong with that? Who really
 can argue with that-unless we want to
 continue this posture of timidity, this
 business of trembling so fearfully in con-
 frontation with a Communist country?
 Do we really want to stop being Amer-
 icans?
 I do not know about other Senators,
 but this Senator thinks it is time for the
 Senate to demonstrate a willingness and
 the backbone to stand with our friends.
 At a very minimum, surely we must re-
 fuse to participate in selling our allies
 and friends down the river.
 I compliment the Senator from New
 Hampshire. I hope that the distinguished
 managers of this bill will change their'
 minds about a tabling motion and let
 there be an up and down vote. But in the
 event there is a motion to table, I hope
 Senators will reject the motion.
 Mr. MORGAN. Mr. President, it is with
 considerable reluctance that I am par-
 ticipating in the discussion of S. 245, the
 Taiwan Enabling Act. My reluctance is
 predicated on two reasons: First, our act
 postpones but nevertheless formalizes the
 demise of Taiwan as a free and dem-
 ocratic nation,  and second,  we are
 forced to react to a situation that could
 have been avoided.
 We should be under no illusion that,
 however well-intentioned our bill is, it
 acknowledges the fact that Taiwan is an
 integral part of Communist China, and
 that Taiwan's own communication is
 only a question of time. There is no his-
 torical evidence to indicate that a Com-
 munist and a democratic-capitalist re-
 gime can coexist within one state. The
 history of the Soviet Union and of Viet-
 nam points to absorption; the continued
 separation of the two Germanies, the
 two Koreas and the two Yemens points
 to the unbridgeable gap between the two
 systems. Consequently, when S. 245 seeks
 to insure a continuity in the relations
 between two democratic nations, it is
 merely attempting to achieve the desira-
 ble goal of postponing the inevitable: the
 eventuality of a Communist Taiwan. Let
 us not be deluded but that we are only
 gaining a temporary respite with this bill

 situation which by no means was un-                              tion of Taiwan's economy toward a

 ing to accept Peking's so-called com-
 promise of letting us live in a make-be-
 lieve world for a little while longer while
 they are reaping the benefits of recogni-
 tion far in excess of their own gesture.
 The PRC's four modernization goals
 need American investment, trade, and
 technical know-how. Their present hos-
 tility toward the Soviets demanded a
 closer association with the United States,
 easier access to military equipment and
 the neutralization of our 7th Fleet in the
 Taiwan  Straits.  The  antihegemonial
 clause served the same purpose, as did
 the premature visit of the Vice Premier
 to Washington and American forbear-
 ance of the Chinese invasion of Vietnam.
 In all honesty, Mr. President, what we
 have gained with our recognition of the
 PRC at this time aside from some mone-
 tary rewards and the potential of future
 trade is nil. We did not bargain for Tai-
 wan's independence or at least auton-
 omy, we lost a friend, we lost credibility,
 and we lost a useful ally and an island
 of strategic importance. The entire evo-
 lution of this matter must be character-
 ized with what Evans and Novak de-
 scribed as "diplomatic masochism."'
 These are the reasons, Mr. President,
 why I am reluctant to engage in this de-
 bate. We seem to have no choice if we
 value our friends in Taiwan but to agree
 to the Enabling Act which, let me em-
 phasize again, can create only a rather
 transient facade of normalcy. Our recog-
 nition of the PRC acknowledges that
 Taiwan is a mere province of China, and
 its ultimate fate is inextricably linked to
 that of Peking. Under these circum-
 stances, it appears to me that we must
 seek to accomplish three objectives: se-
 curity for Taiwan, protection of Ameri-
 can economic interests, and mainte-
 nance of Asian-Pacific stability. Are the
 provisions of S. 245 the best contribution
 toward these goals?
 In section 101 of the bill, we are in
 effect saying that we will accord to
 Taiwan all the sovereign privileges, short
 of- diplomatic recognition, as if it were a
 state. Since our administration acknowl-
 edges Taiwan to be a province of China,
 we are placing ourselves in a rather un-
 tenable position that can easily be chal-
 lenged by .Peking and the international
 community. It also creates a questionable
 precedent. Given the facts as they are,
 however, I cannot see a viable alterna-
 tive. But let us not deceive ourselves, we
 are establishing a legal anomaly that
 can only be sustained as long as we are
 prepared to back it up.
 Section 112 of the Enabling Act seeks
 to secure continuity in our economic re-
 lations with Taiwan by maintaining the
 services of. the Overseas Private Invest-
 ment Corporation. This is a laudable
 objective as long as Taiwan can maintain
 its free market society and can protect
 the mainland expands and Pekmg de-
 mands ideological concessions in return.
 For this reason, Congress and the Ameri-
 can business community may require
 more frequent analytic reports from the
 President than the 5 years stipulated in
 section 112(c).
 Can Taiwan's security be assured with
 the delivery of some defensive weapons?
 Again, Mr. President, we are conjuring
 an illusion of security that cannot really
 be taken seriously. Shipment of arms to
 enhance a self-defense capability, as re-
 quested in section 114(b) (2), may raise
 the cost of invasion but cannot prevent
 it. Punitive actions, as we have recently
 seen in Vietnam, may be contemplated at
 a prohibitive price of lives and material.
 In addition to the transfer of weapons
 systems, we should endeavor to increase
 Taiwan's productive capacity in the arms
 field. Although the PRC can be expected
 to expand its military potential at a
 greater pace, we can at least insure for
 Taiwan a measure of independence in
 armament production.
 Still, Taiwan's ultimate security will
 depend upon the United States and our
 willingness to become directly involved
 in any future conflict. Are we prepared
 to do that, Mr. President? The Enabling
 Act, in section 114, views force and any
 other form of coercion with "grave con-
 cern" and directs the President to in-
 form Congress, and to meet dangers "in
 accordance with constitutional proc-
 esses. Can such language act as a suffi-
 cient deterrent to armed aggression?
 Can we prevent an all out subversion of
 Taiwan's political system and its people?
 To my mind, Mr. President, only an
 unequivocal statement that any change
 in the status quo of Taiwan would be
 detrimental to our own security inter-
 ests, could possibly serve this purpose.
 Such an assertion would be in line with
 the posture statement for fiscal year
 1979, by Gen. George S. Brown, Chair-
 man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that
 ."the Location of the ' ? = Republic of
 .China  (makes it)  important to the
 United States in peacetime and militarily
 significant in wartime." Taiwan has been
 an essential element of our vital military
 presence in the Western Pacific, both in
 terms of its direct military value to us
 and in its linkage to our security com-
 mitments to our friends and allies in
 that region.
 In the end, however, our most effective
 deterrent may not be of a military na-
 ture  but  simply  economic  leverage.
 Peking should be placed on notice that
 commerce, trade, credit, and overseas
 training opportunities will be termi-
 nated in the event of hostile actions
 against Taiwan. If China treasures its
 modernization program as much as it
 professes to, Taiwan will be relegated to
 be of mere symbolic significance. Thus
 the question arises as to how long the
 PRC will prefer our credits and tech-
 nology to a military incorporation of
 Taiwan. The initial approach to an an-
 swer must be to establish a clear linkage
 between the well-being of the PRC and
 the security of Taiwan.
 Mr. President, completely absent from
 the Enabling Act, for obvious reasons, is
 reference to the termination of the Mu-
 tual Defense Pact with Taiwan. Al-
 though it may not be germane within the
 context of our debate today, the rather
 abrupt ending of a security treaty, and
 the consequences for our own interests,
 do deserve further consideration. While
 the President should have sufficient flex-
 ibility for conducting our foreign policy,
 I am favorably inclined to the view that
 Congress is entitled to be given reason-
 able notice when a treaty termination is
 contemplated. No one likes unpleasant
 surprises whether it is Taiwan or the
 U.S. Congress.
 Finally, Mr. President, this leaves the
 question of whether our new arrange-
 ment with Taiwan adds to the stability
 of the West Pacific region. I cannot help
 but be rather pessimistic about the an-
 swer. The future of Taiwan cannot, and
 should not be viewed in isolation. By
 voting for the Enabling Act, we must in-
 evitably consider the consequences it can
 have for the area between Vladivostok
 and Jakarta. Our policy has been char-
 acterized by successive ad hoc moves
 which are difficult to fit into a cohesive
 pattern. Our Philippine base negotiations
 were apparently successfully concluded
 despite our disenchantment with martial
 law rule. Our troop withdrawal from Ko-
 rea appears to be an on-again, off-again
 proposition. We declare our half-hearted
 support for the Association of Southeast
 Asian Nations, ASEAN, although it is the
 best thing we have going for us in that
 part of the world. Thailand is reassured
 of our adherence to the 1954 Manila Pact
 despite the fact that we are reducing our
 presence in the area. Japan's defense is
 guaranteed and yet we are dismantling
 the security sphere mentioned in article
 VI of our Mutual Defense Treaty. And
 I could go on pointing to apparent incon-
 sistencies. Perhaps our situation can best
 be described by what Harvard Prof. Stan-
 ley Hoffman called "The Perils of Inco-
 herence." And there definitely are perils,
 Mr. President.
 As for ourselves, the unavailability df
 Taiwan -will greatly complicate and po-
 tentially weaken our defense posture in
 the Pacific. We must reassess the bases,
 control points, intelligence assets, and lot
 gistics lines still at our disposal. We must
 make adjustments to our remaining ca-
 pabilities so that we can still present
 credible defense assistance to our allies
 in the Pacific.
 The Chinese tonne. Lion will remain
 rather tenuous. In the case of Vietnam,
 the Peking leaders have demonstrated
 an absence of foreign policy predictabil-
 ity which will not be conducive to sound
 future relations. As a matter of fact, it is
 not difficult to anticipate a more per-
 manent Soviet presence in Vietnam to
 counteract more rapidly any future
 Chinese incursions.

 March 7, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 With these principles of international re-
 lations in mind the two sides stated that:
 Progress toward the normalization of rela-
 tions between China and the United States
 is in the interests of all countries;
 Both wish to reduce the danger of inter-
 national military confiibt;
 Neither should seek hegemony in the Asia-
 Pacific region and each is opposed to efforts
 by any other country or group of countries
 to establish such hegemony; and
 Neither is prepared to negotiate on behalf
 of any third party or to enter into agree-
 ments or understandings with the other di-
 rected at other states.
 Both sides are of the view that it would
 be against the interests of the peoples of the
 world for any major country to collude with
 another against other countries, or for major
 countries to divide up the world into spheres
 of interest.
 The two sides reviewed the long-standing
 serious disputes  between China and the
 United States. The Chinese side reaffirmed
 its position: The Taiwan question is the cru-
 cial question obstructing the normalization
 of relations between China and the United
 States; the Government of the People's Re-
 public of China is the sole legal government
 of China; Taiwan is a province of China
 which has long been returned to the mother-
 land;                 the liberation of Taiwan is China's
 internal affair in which no other country has
 the right to interfere: and all V.S. forces and
 military installations must be  withdrawn
 from  Taiwan.  The  Chinese    Government
 firmly opposes any activities which aim at
 the creation of "one China, one Taiwan,"
 "one China, two governments," two Chinas,"
 and "independent Taiwan" or advocate that
 "the  status  of  Taiwan  remains  to  be
 determined."
 The V.S. side declared: The United States
 acknowledges that all Chinese on either side
 of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but
 one China and that Taiwan is a part of
 ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all
 V.S. forces and military installations from
 Taiwan. In the meantime, it will progres-
 sively reduce its forces and military instal-
 lations on Taiwan as the tension in the area
 diminishes.
 The two sides agreed that it is desirable
 to broaden the understanding between the
 two peoples. To this end, they discussed spe-
 cific areas in such fields as science, technol-
 ogy, culture, sports and journalism, in which
 people-to-people  contacts  and  exchanges
 would be mutually beneficial. Each side un-
 dertakes to facilitate the further develop-
 ment of such contacts and exchanges.
 Both sides view bilateral trade as another
 area from which mutual benefit can be de-
 rived, and agreed that economic relations
 based on equality and mutual benefit are in
 the interest of the peoples of the two coun-
 tries. They agree to facilitate the progres-
 sive development of trade between their two
 countries.
 The two sides agreed that they will stay
 in contact through various channels, includ-
 ing the sending of a senior U.S. representa-
 tive to Peking from time to time for concrete
 consultations to further the normalization
 of relations between the two countries and
 corrtinue to exchange views on issues of com-
 mon interest.
 The two sides expressed the hope that the
 President Nixon, Mrs. Nixon and the Amer-
 ican party expressed their appreciation for
 the gracious hospitality shown them by the
 Government and people of the People's Re-
 public of China.

 UP AMENDMENT NO. 30
 (Subsequently numbered amendment No. 93)
 (Purpose: Relating to termination of mutual
 defense treaties.)
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, I send to the desk an amendment
 and ask that it be stated. I offer this
 amendment on behalf of myself, Mr.'
 THURMOND, Mr. WARNER, Mr. HELMS, Mr.
 HAYAKAWA, and Mr. GARN.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 amendment will be stated.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 read as follows:
 The Senator from Virginia (Mr. HARRY F.
 BYRD,  JR.), proposes an unprinted amend-
 ment numbered 30:
 At the. end of the bill add the following
 new section:
 "Sec. -. It is the sense of the Senate that
 approval by the Senate of the United States
 is required to terminate any mutual defense
 treaty between the United States and an-
 other nation.".
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, this is, I think, a very important
 amendment. It is a very brief one. It
 says that it expresses the sense and the
 view of the Senate that approval by the
 Senate is required to terminate any mu-
 tual defense treaty between the United
 States and another nation. It does not
 deal specifically with Taiwan.
 As the Senate knows so well, our Na-
 tion has quite a few mutual defense
 treaties. Some of these are of vital im-
 portance to our Nation and to the free
 world. All of these treaties have been en-
 acted with the approval of the Senate
 of the United States.
 I think it is important to set the record
 straight for the future as to how these
 treaties may be terminated.
 Now, I was persuaded to offer this
 amendment because of a very significant
 paragraph in the report from the Com-
 mittee on Foreign Relations on the pend-
 ing legislation, namely, S. 245. I refer to
 page 19 of the committee report. It, of
 course, deals with the President's action
 in regard to Taiwan.
 This is what the paragraph on page 19
 says:
 It appears to the Committee, therefore,
 that the constitutional prerogatives of the
 Congress and the Senate have not been in-
 vaded in that neither the Congress nor the
 Senate has elected to exercise the powers
 granted it by the Constitution to participate
 in the process of treaty termination. Had
 either done so, a different conclusion would
 likely obtain.
 I say again, that is from the committee
 report of the Foreign Relations Com-
 mitt,3e dealing with S. 245.
 That committee report states clearly
 that the Senate has powers granted to
 it by the Constitution to participate in
 the process of treaty termination. it says
 further that the Senate in this particular
 case, the one dealing with Taiwan, has
 not chosen to exercise its authority. Had
 it done so, the committee report says, a
 different  conclusion  "would  likely
 obtain."
 So what this sense of the Senate pro-

 Mr. President, as this committee report  nor does it say termination occurs auto-
 states, the Senate has a constitutional
 role in the process of treaty termination.
 Now, does the Senate want to exercise
 that role, or does it want it to go by
 default?
 The committee report says that, inso-
 far as the treaty of friendship with
 Taiwan is concerned, the Senate and the
 Congress decided to let that go by
 default.
 If the Senate will approve the amend-
 ment which has just been stated, then
 it will serve notice that it is the sense
 of the Senate that approval by the Sen-
 ate of the United States is required to
 terminate any mutual defense treaty
 between the United States and another
 nation.
 I realize that there are different views
 as to whether the Senate should partici-
 pate or whether the matter should be
 left entirely to our Chief Executive.
 As one Senator, I feel the Senate
 should participate. I hope the Senate will
 approve this amendment.
 Mr. President, I yield to my distin-
 guished colleague from Virginia (Mr.
 WARNER).
 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as a co-
 sponsor of this amendment, I join in the
 remarks of the distinguished senior
 Senator from Virginia.
 It is apparent that the Founding
 Fathers made clear the intent in arti-
 cle 2, section 2, of our Constitution that
 the executive branch is to share the
 power of international treaties with the
 Senate. The Senate was clearly meant to
 have a major role in these dealings, and
 the Founding Fathers thought it wise for
 a deliberative body such as the Senate to
 guard against certain actions of our
 Chief Executive officer.
 To me, this section in the Constitution
 is a clear example of the checks and bal-
 ances existing between the executive
 branch and the legislative branch.
 It is essential to the preservation of
 the blueprint of our Nation that we, the
 Senate, go on record with this amend-
 ment. It is essential at this time in our
 Now, Mr. President, to the Senator
 from Virginia, "a party" means that
 either government may terminate.
 I take the Government of the United
 States to be both the executive branch
 and the legislative branch-and if it in-
 cludes legislative branch, then it includes
 the Senate in particular, which has re-
 quired to ratify all the treaties we now
 have.
 So I think it certainly is reasonable
 and appropriate that the Senate have
 a role in the termination of such treaty.
 I, for one, am very glad to see in this
 committee report? a very clear, definite,
 and precise statement in regard to the
 powers granted to the Senate by the Con-
 stitution.to participate in the process of
 treaty termination. Frankly, I had not
 expected to find such an unequivocal
 statement.
 I want to read it into the record
 again, because to me it is clear. It says
 on page 19:
 It appears to the  Committee, therefore,
 that the constitutional prerogatives of the
 Congress and the Senate have not been in-
 vaded in that 'neither the Congress nor the
 Senate has elected to exercise the powers
 granted it by the Constitution to participate
 in the process of treaty termination.
 Those are the words of the Foreign
 Relations Committee. Then the Foreign
 I have been amazed, in my years in the
 Senate, to hear Senators say, in effect,
 "Well, on this nomination, the President
 is entitled to have whom he wishes;
 therefore, I am going to vote for the
 nomination, even ' though I do not par-
 ticularly care for the nomination." That
 is not what the Constitution tells us to
 do. The Constitution says that our re-
 sponsibility is to advise and consent, and
 the very same thing is true with respect
 to the Senator's amendment.
 It is time for the Senate to fish or cut
 bait on this business of abrogation of
 treaties. The Senator, with his amend-
 ment, is putting the Senate on notice
 that it has to take a position, yea or nay,
 as to our responsibility.
 I am proud to be a cosponsor of the
 Senator's amendment, and I thank him
 for letting me be.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I am glad
 the Senator from North Carolina is a co-
 sponsor.
 I point out that the committee report,
 in effect, chastises the Senate for not ex-
 ercising what it says are our constitu-
 tional prerogatives.
 Mr. HELMS. Exactly. I hope the Su-
 preme Court will read that section and
 interpret it properly, as the Senator from
 Virginia has, because the Senator is ex-
 actly right in his statement.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I thank the
 Senator from North Carolina.
 Mr. President, I yield to my colleague
 from Virginia.
 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if it is
 resolved that the President alone has the
 authority  to  invoke  the  abrogation
 mechanism, it would then follow that
 he has the authority to do so with other
 treaties containing similar language.
 This would present major problems for'
 the stability of the future of U.S. for-
 eign relations, as a number of our other
 treaties have similar, . if not identical,
 abrogation clauses.

 could toss it right back to us, claiming
 that it is primarily a political decision.
 In any event, if we did not like the
 decision of the court we could still pass
 legislation later on, after we had held
 a sufficient number of hearings to devel-
 op all sides of this particular question,
 and decide what the vote should be.
 Should it be two-thirds? 'Should it be a
 majority vote? There are lots of ques-
 tions I would like to see answered before
 I would go ahead and try to pass this.
 In the section, I might add, in the
 committee report, the committee also
 stated that the formulation which they
 were referring to-termination. by the
 President of this defense treaty-would
 fall in sort of a twilight zone of cate-
 gories which they had spelled out earlier
 in this report, they went ahead and said:
 The President would, accordingly, appear
 to possess the constitutional authority to do
 so absent any statute enacted by the Con-
 gress or resolution adopted by two-thirds of
 the Senate directing contrary action.
 So we did not take a positive stand on
 this one way or the other, as I saw it, and
 our discussions of its were along the line
 that there should be hearings to develop
 whatever the process of deratification
 might happen to be.

 there so we have to take that whole
 paragraph to get the whole picture.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. But what
 the Senator from Virginia has been read-
 ing is only one paragraph, so I will read
 the whole paragraph:
 It appears to the Committee, therefore,
 that the constitutional prerogatives of the
 Congress and the Senate have not been in-
 vaded in that neither the Congress nor the
 Senate has elected to exercise the powers
 granted it by the Constitution to participate
 in the process of treaty termination. Had
 eiher done so, a different conclusion would
 likely obtain.
 That is the total paragraph.

 Zones. 85% of the 67,000 workers are women
 and the overwhelming majority of these are
 young and unmarried. As of December 1977,
 well over 60 percent of these workers earned
 between NT$1600 and NT$3400 per month-
 this is equivalent to U.S. $40490 per month.
 To begin to relate the preceding discussion
 of the EPZ labor force and wage levels to the
 issue of the quality of life, one might ask the
 question, "Are EPZ workers, and especially
 women workers, satisfied with their position
 in the factories?" Contrary to many reports
 published in this country, a number of recent
 studies addressing the issue of worker atti-
 tudes have shown considerable levels of dis-
 satisfaction, especially among women. An-
 thropologist Lydia Kung's research has shown
 the bitterness of many women workers:
 "Many workers at the factory say that
 working here amounts 'wasting away' our
 time, 'burying our youth', because each day
 by the time we get off work, it's already very
 late. There's hardly any time or opportunity
 to meet with friends. In the factory, where
 one has no freedom, it is as if we've sold our
 lives to the company."
 Kung concludes:
 "    . the "bitter" quality of factory work
 derives from a combination of working con-
 ditions and the attitudes they encounter in
 the course of their work. They earn money
 through manual labor; their hands may be-
 come coarse and rough; the plant can at
 times be hot; inadequate ventilation leaves
 fumes or lint in the air; their uniforms be-
 come soiled; their tasks repetitive and mo-
 notonous; and many cannot leave the as-
 sembly lines or walk around."
 A detailed study of 576 women workers in
 the Nantze Export Processing Zone has con-
 clusively indicated significant levels of dis-
 satisfaction, especially in the electronics in-
 dustry. The survey found that over 70 per-
 cent (124 out of 173) were either somewhat
 (40 percent) or very dissatisfied (30 percent)
 with their job6 in that industry. Principal
 reasons for dissatisfaction included low sal-
 aries, the perceived difficulty of the work,
 the loss of eyesight due to working with
 mini-electronic circuits, execessive noise, and
 the basic feeling of alienation from their
 ? labor. Nowhere is the general sentiment of
 unhappiness shown more pervasively than
 in the high turnover rate in NEPZ factories.
 Of the workers questioned in 1978, nearly
 50 percent said that they had changed jobs
 one or more times in their first year of em-
 ployment in the NEPZ. Many women workers
 are driven to prostitution. Abortion clinics

 ration of Human Rights in 1977 urged the
 Taiwanese to take "effective measures where-

 announcement,  leading  Presbyterians re-
 solved to intensify their appeal for self-
 determination. They feel that the future of
 Taiwan is likely to be determined-unless
 there is direct interference from the main-
 land-by the struggle between the awaken-
 ing Taiwanese and a weakened KMT.
 The second major group to criticize the
 KMT's claim to rule all of China is the exist-
 ing opposition party in Taiwan. One opposi-
 tion candidate reflected the dominant views
 of his organization when he commented: "In
 the short run, normalization is bad because
 of its effect on the elections, but in the lon'
 run it is good because the KMT no longer
 can defend its claim to represent China. The
 Taiwanese now have a chance to rule their
 own territory."
 A minority view within this opposition
 looks forward to reunification with the main-
 land-but under Taiwanese terms and based
 on widespread popular support. Supporters
 of this view argue that 10 years is needed
 to re-educate people away from anti-Com-
 munism thinking. Their great fear is that
 Pei=ins., either will become impatient and in-
 vade-th,,s producing tremendous disorder
 and loss of life-or will loin with the United
 States in bq"king's KMT puppet regime over
 the isiand. The latter scenario would mean
 the stifling of internal reform and contin"a-
 tion of a semi-colonial status for Taiwan.
 In sum, most self-conscious Taiwanese be-
 lieve that normalization merely "recognizes
 the fact of 30 years of history." They have
 always agreed that the KMT should return
 to the mainland; they just disagree on why
 thev have to pay for the KMT's financial and
 military preparations.
 One politician, a former political prisoner,
 expressed this resentment and independence:
 "The KMT has neither the duty nor the
 right to forever assume full responsibility
 for national and governmental affairs. . .
 We are all in the same boat. whether we
 continue to hold recovery of the mainland
 as an ultimate goal or whether we seek a
 temnorarv alternate route of survival."
 Whether the Taiwanese are allowed to find
 such an "alternate route" to develop their
 own  island  in their own self-interest, or
 whether international powers will stifle them
 again, remains to be seen.

 resulted, a similar incident occurred in the
 Changhua area. In Kaohsiung, the second
 largest city in Taiwan, a four day riot oc-
 curred over the same issue. There troops
 were brought in, but there was no violence.
 Whereas these incidents revealed the exist-
 ence of mass based opposition, they also
 signaled the  government that  long-range
 pre-emptive measures must be organized to
 limit the power of this group.
 THE NONPARTISAN MOVEMENT
 Perhaps the best way to describe the move-
 ment is through its political platform. A ten
 point declaration was drawn up for the non-
 partisan  convention called for December
 25th, and to be held in the Ambassador Hotel
 in Taipei. However, the Garrison Command
 refused to allow the meeting. The Hotel was
 surrounded  by  military  and police,  and
 special agents waited inside to take pictures
 of all  non-partisans who entered.  Conse-
 quently,  the  platform was not fully dis-
 cussed, and only a few signatures could be
 obtained. Nonetheless, the platform repre-
 sents the consensus of the candidates.
 Point number one demands the full imple-
 mentation  of  constitutional  government.
 This would include completely reelecting the
 representatives of the central government,
 the proclamation of self rule for all the cities,
 counties, and the province, the establishment
 of an independent judiciary, the severance of
 the military from KMT control, the protec-
 tion of academic independence, freedom of
 speech, unobstructed debate, and repeal of
 the press censorship. At the heart of this
 plank of the platform is the charge to abolish
 martial law and to protect civilians from
 receiving military trials. Finally, the govern-
 ment is petitioned to respect personal dig-
 nity, i.e. to protect personal freedom, stop
 torture, illegal arrest and imprisonment, and
 to desist from invasion of privacy through
 wire taps and forced entries.
 The remaining nine points of the platform
 focus on social and economic problems: ad-
 ministration of fair elections, creation of a
 national medical and unemployment insur-
 ance, aid to the farm population, enactment
 of basic labor laws which would guarantee
 collective bargaining (striking is a capital
 offense), enactment of tax reforms, creation
 of a reasonable sales system that will protect
 the producers and give protection for the

 The military was instructed to maintain
 close collaboration with the election offices'of
 their local KMT candidates throughout the
 campaign period. In the dependents' villages
 and on the bases, non-partisan and other
 "illegal"  and  "bad" publication,  leaflets,
 fliers, posters, etc. that "distorted the truth"
 were to be found out and confiscated. People
 living in the villages were to be organized
 into hit squads that would leave their refuge
 for the battlefield of the election place and
 heckle non-partisan candidates, etc. The aim
 of this was to contribute to "mass opposi-
 tion" to the "poisonous thoughts." Non-
 partisans were always to be referred to as
 "some social personages". Seven agents were
 to be assigned to each non-partisan election
 office to watch and create disturbances. Dur-
 ing campaign activities such as rallies, the
 pollee would step in if "violence" was about
 to break out between non-partisan support-
 ers and their "opponents"-and the latter
 whisked off to the safety of the local police
 station  so  that  their agent provocateur
 identity would not be exposed..
 But the suspension of the elections ob-
 viated the need of "Operation Clear Sincer-
 ity." The day following the announcement of
 normalization and suspension of the elec-
 tions, President Chiang Ching-kuo "ordered
 the Executive Yuan to collect all opinions
 made by candidates during the campaign in
 the past week and send them to related de-
 partments for reference." (China Post, De-
 cember 18). General Wang Ching-hsi, Com-
 mander of the Taiwan Garrison Command
 warned that application or martial law would
 intensify if "a small minority of conspira-
 torial  elements,  used  by  the  communist
 bandit or Taiwan independence elements,
 take advantage of the situation to develop
 splittist, destructive or subversive activities
 damaging to national security and the peo-
 ple's welfare. Illegal activities include the
 holding of illegal marches or assembles."
 General Wang then commented that he was
 pleased to see that all the  (non-partisan)
 campaign posters had been ripped down. The
 following day, December 18, President Chiang
 declared  to  a  high-level  KMT  meeting,
 "Taiwan is always a part of the Republic of
 China and anyone talking of an independent
 Taiwan is betraying his country and people.
 We will not allow talk, organizations, or ac-
 tions like that to exist on this bastion."
 Nonetheless, the non-partisans continued
 to organize. Seventy-seven year old Yu Teng-
 fa, a former magistrate of Kaoshiung County,
 CONCLUSION  AND  RECOMMENDATION
 In concluding, I would like to bring to
 your attention the speech of a Catholic Fa-
 ther on December 10th, 1978 on the occasion
 of the 30th Anniversary of the Universal Dec-
 laration of Human Rights. Despite intensive
 pressures by the KMT threatening the lay-
 men and priests if they attended the cere-
 mony, the celebration was well-attended.
 Speaking in Taiwanese, the priest expressed
 the bitterness of his situation: "When I tell
 a polar man not to steal a chicken, everyone
 praises me and says that this is what the

 I tell a legislator not to steal, I am accused of
 being involved in politics." He told his flock
 that Human Rights is not just the job of a
 church specialist but is "now regarded as a
 basic responsibility of every Christian." He
 then elaborated on the rights which were
 lacking  in  Taiwan.  Primary  among them
 were the right to just economic order, right
 of conscience and political participation, and
 the right to a secure life.
 I entreat this Senate Committee to con-
 sider seriously the human rights of the peo-
 ple on Taiwan. The initial means to accom-
 plish this is to understand that the KMT
 does not express the wishes of the majority
 of the Taiwanese. For many Taiwanese the
 Senate's worry about the possibility that Pe-
 king might attempt to solve the "Taiwan
 question" by force begs the issue if at the
 same time the Senate neglects the reality of
 the KMT's seizure and control of Taiwan.
 Taoyuan  County Magistrate Hsu Hsin-
 liang, a leading member of the non-partisans
 and  currently  under  KMT  harassment,
 warned that, "if the government and ruling
 party do not have the confidence to move
 democracy and freedom but attempt to sup-
 press the movement for democracy by force,
 they will fall in the same way as the Shah

 desire to express their own position of the
 future of Taiwan without KMT or outside
 threats should be respected. Most important
 is to remove U.S. government policies and
 support from furthering the exercise of mar-
 tial law. Second, advise the Undersecretary
 of State for Human Rights that the condi-
 tions of the Taiwanese are still of great im-
 portance to U.S. policy. This can be effectu-
 ated by insisting that whatever continued
 relations are established with Taiwan, a per-

 Mr. DURENBERGER. Mr. President,
 Dr. Kagan has been a frequent visitor
 to Taiwan. He last visited Taiwan from
 December 14 to 28, 1978, on behalf of
 the Clergy and Laity Concerned and had
 an opportunity to investigate the politi-
 cal situation first,hand and in depth.
 Some of the crimes punishable by
 death are: circulating rumors and be-
 guiling the public; strikes; and the very
 ambiguous and convenient category of
 inciting rebellion.
 I should like to address a few questions
 to the distinguished Senator from Rhode
 Island.
 In light of this evidence of a lack of
 democracy  and  self-determination,  I
 would like clarification of section 107 of
 this bill. Specifically, what monitoring
 of the political situation will be done by
 the AIT? Will there be a specific official
 assigned to report to the State Depart-
 ment? And does -section 107 effectively
 require ongoing and regular reporting to
 Congress?
 Let me say, in conclusion, that I do
 not raise these issues as an abstract
 statement of moral concern. I am con-
 fident that many of us in this Chamber
 would like to see a greater embodiment
 in our foreign policy of the principles of
 "just consent of the governed" and for
 the self-determination of all peoples.
 From a practical as well as strategic
 point of view, I believe that our security,
 economic and overall foreign policy in-
 terests are linked inextricably to politi-
 cal stability in Asia. Yet, it is possible that
 the ROC Government may be inciting
 greater instability through its repression
 of the huge majority of the population
 who are native Taiwanese. In Iran, we
 have seen all too bluntly what can hap-
 pen when we stress support of foreign
 governments and pay too little attention
 to the rights and interests of people.
 As we consider this bill, I am concerned
 that we lose sight neither of our long-
 term strategic interests nor, more im-
 portantly, of our historic commitment
 to the right of all people to national
 self-determination.
 Mr. PELL. I thank my colleague for
 his remarks and kind words.,
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield to me momentarily?
 Mr. PELL. I yield.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I have
 been advised that this is Senator DUREN-
 BERCER's maiden speech, and I congratu-,
 late him, on behalf of the minority, for
 this speech. He could not have chosen a
 topic more characteristic of the freedom-
 loving nature of the people he represents
 in Minnesota.
 This is a very key, deeply troublesome,
 and aggravating point. I do not wish to
 interfere in any way with the answers.
 Perhaps I will join in the answers. I just
 wish to congratulate the Senator on
 speaking up for the people of Taiwan
 the way he has done in his maiden
 speech. It does great credit to him and
 the State he represents.
 Mr. DURENBERGER. I thank the
 Senator.

 Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I Join in con-
 gratulating the Senator from Minne-
 sota. I did not realize it was his maiden
 speech. It was delivered effortlessly and
 professionally. .
 In answer to the Senator's question as
 to who would have the responsibility for
 monitoring the human rights involved
 here, the man responsible for that func-
 tion would be the Foreign Service officer
 who is assigned to that post as a so-
 called human rights officer. He, in turn,
 would be under the supervision of the
 man-he would not be Ambassador; I do
 not know what he would be called-who
 ? is in charge of the institute. He would
 be the man responsible, and his reports
 would be sent to the State Department
 and would be made available to us if we

 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President. does that

 Mr. PELL. I yield the floor.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
 tion now recurs on the amendment of
 the Senator from Virginia.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I suggest
 the absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will call the roll.
 The assistant legislative clerk proceed-
 ed to call the roll.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, I ask unanimous consent that the
 order for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I yield to
 the Senator from Arizona.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I thank my friend
 from Virginia.
 Sitting here this afternoon listening
 to the colloquy, I was rather particu-
 larly impressed by the lack of knowledge
 that was displayed on exactly what the
 Constitution says in this field, but more
 particularly what our Founding Fathers
 had to say in this important field. I
 simply wished to interrogate my friend.
 For example, John Jay wrote in the
 Federalists, and this relates to the prob-
 lem we are talking about:
 They who make laws may, without doubt,
 amend or repeal them; and it will not be
 disputed that they who make treaties may
 alter or cancel them.
 I think that leads toward the idea
 that the Senate has to participate in the
 abrogation of treaties, particularly de-
 fense treaties. Will the Senator agree?

 who did so much to make this country
 what it is.
 I hope when we do get ready to vote
 that our colleagues in this body will pay
 very careful attention  to  what the
 Founding Fathers said about this, and
 the fact that this is the first time a
 President has ever tried this.
 I thank the Senator for yielding.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, does the
 Senator from Virginia have the floor?
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Could I
 just make a brief comment?
 May I just say that the able Senator
 from Arizona has made a most significant
 contribution to this debate.
 I think the facts and statements that
 the Senator from Arizona has made
 available to the Senate should be tre-
 mendously helpful to the Members of the
 Senate in deciding how to vote on the.
 pending legislation.
 Undoubtedly the Senate, if it wishes,
 can say, "Well, we will table this amend-
 ment; we will vote it down. We do not
 want to have anything to do with the
 treaties after they are made. We will
 just let the President do whatever he
 wants." We have the authority to do
 that. Those Senators who want to do
 that certainly have the right to so vote.
 The Senator from Arizona and the
 Senator from Virginia happen to take a
 different course. We believe the Senate
 has a constitutional role to play, just as
 the report of the Committee on Foreign
 Relations states. Here is the time to play
 that role.
 Those who do not want to participate
 in it can say, "We are going to vote down
 this amendment. We are going to table it.
 We are going to oppose it one way or
 another. We are going to get rid of it
 some way."
 Well, that is all right. The Senator
 from Arizona and the Senator from Vir-
 ginia have been on losing sides before.
 It is nothing new to us.
 But I just wonder why a person would
 want to be in the Senate if he is going
 to abdicate a vital constitutional role,
 namely, the role of the treatymaking
 process and, as the report of the Com-
 mittee on Foreign Relations says, "the
 constitutional role to participate in the
 process of treaty termination?"
 As the entire history of our country
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I might just re-
 mind my colleagues that last fall we
 passed a resolution asking that the Pres-
 ident come to us before he did anything
 about this treaty, not just his body, but
 the other body, too. I think there were
 four votes against it in the entire Con-
 gress. I may be wrong, but I think it
 was that. So while it was not law, it was
 certainly an expression of the Constitu-
 tion the President should have under-
 stood.
 I thank the Senator from Virginia for
 yielding.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I yield to
 the Senator from Maryland.
 (Mr. BAUCUS assumed the Chair.)
 Mr. SARBANES. Is the approval to
 which the Senator refers, the approval
 of the Senate, is that by a majority
 vote of the Senate?
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Approval
 is ordinarily in that form; what is crit-
 ical is that some formal legislative ac-
 tion occur.
 Mr. SARBANES. The Senator means
 it would take two-thirds to ratify the
 treaty but that only a majority could
 terminate it?
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I think it
 could. However, if the Senate would
 prefer to have it spelled out as two-
 thirds I would bewilling to accept such
 a proposal.
 , Mr. SARBANES. I do not have an
 answer for the Senator from Virginia
 on that question which, I think, is a
 rather important one. That question,
 however, is one of the reasons that
 seems to me to support the suggestion
 made earlier in the afternoon by the
 managers of the bill that an amendment
 of this sort which raises some very basic
 constitutional questions, ought to be the
 subject of hearings.
 I appreciate the thrust of some of the
 arguments which the Senator from Vir-
 ginia has advanced. On the other hand,
 as a matter of logic one could quite
 easily argue that if it takes two-thirds
 to approve a treaty it ought to take two-
 thirds to terminate a treaty.
 Let me ask the Senator from Virginia
 this question: Does the Senator feel that
 the Senate could terminate a treaty if
 The President did not wish a treaty

 me, I ask unanimous consent to have

 Mr. JAVITS. I objected to it before,    it if it is desired to have a Senate role in
 long before it was brought up. In the col- the formulating may well be to spell it
 out in the resolution of ratification.
 The Senator from Arizona is in court on .
 this issue. He has testified before our
 committee and has raised some very
 interesting questions.
 Leaving the question of termination
 by the Executive alone to one side, there
 is still the very difficult question of how
 do you terminate a treaty even if it re-
 quires more than the Executive alone.
 This amendment itself by the state-
 ment of the Senator from Virginia is
 unclear as to whether you do it by a
 majority vote of the Senate or by a
 two-thirds vote. If you do it by a major-
 ity, what is the logic of requiring two-
 thirds to approve a, treaty and a majority
 to terminate it?
 On the other hand, the Senator from
 Louisiana when he drew his analogy to
 repealing a law, said that the Congress
 could repeal a law. That is quite true.
 But the Congress is the House and the
 Senate and, it takes both to repeal a law
 just as it takes. both to pass it.
 Mr. JAVITS. And the President.
 Mr. SARBANES. I will get to the Presi-
 dent in a minute.
 It is the House and the Senate acting
 together by a majority vote that pass
 and repeal laws. Yet you make a treaty
 by two-thirds of the Senate without
 action by the House. It is now suggested
 you can repeal it by a majority vote of
 the House and the Senate. Can a Presi-
 dent veto the repeal of a treaty passed
 by a majority of both Houses? If he does,
 can the Congress override his veto of the
 repeal of a treaty by a two-thirds vote
 in both the House. and the Senate?
 Suppose a President does not want to
 terminate a treaty to begin with? Can we
 initiate the termination of the treaty in
 the Congress? Can the House of Repre-
 sentatives initiate the termination of a
 treaty? Can the House pass a resolution
 terminating a treaty and, if so, what vote
 would be required? If the House sent
 such a repeal over to us what Would we
 then do with it? If we passed it, by what
 vote? Would the President have a veto
 authority with respect to the termina-
 tion of that treaty?
 I have raised all these quesitons really
 to underscore and subscribe- to what the
 Senator from Ohio has suggested.. There
 are a great number of unanswered ques-
 tions. Even if you take the most narrow
 view of the amendment offered by the
 Senator from Virginia there will remain
 unanswered questions. It seems to me
 that the suggestion made by the Senator
 from Ohio that there is a need to delve
 into this matter in a very careful and
 considered way, is a very good suggestion.
 All the questions raised concerning
 the. very difficult issue of how one pro-
 ceeds in this area makes the counsel that
 the Senator from Ohio _was offering
 earlier particularly wise and prudent
 counsel.
 Mr.. GOLDWATER. Will the Senator
 yield?
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I yield to
 the Senator from Arizona.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I think this is a
 good point to get some history into this.
 That is why I absented myself from the
 floor long enough to look up-some things
 that I do. not think have been in the
 RECORD yet.

 Senator GOLDWATER appeared before
 us and argued that very strongly, that
 very thing.
 But we felt it was a methodology very
 carefully worked out and, 'though the
 President vetoed it, we passed it over his
 veto. In that spirit of comity which rep-
 resents the triumph of our society, the
 Presidents previous and the present
 President are accepting that methodol-
 ogy as what the Congress wants.
 But this goes a lot further than that.
 This is not just a methodology. I think
 we could probably work out a methodol-
 ogy which would resolve this question.
 But this resolution, if we adopted it, just
 as the Senator from Virginia says, we can
 read the words, it is simple. This is what
 they said.
 Well, what they say is that the Presi-
 dent has acted unlawfully, that is the
 sense of the Senate. Therefore, this whole
 edifice we have been developing goes
 crashing down.
 That is great for people who are
 against it anyhow. But, apparently, a
 majority of the Senate is not against it.
 So whether we vote tonight or tomor-
 row, I think it is very important to get
 that clear.
 Finally, the Senator said something
 which I do not agree with, with all re-
 spect, and he knows my great regard for
 him, and I would like to straighten it out.
 That is, that a motion to table is some
 kind of a substantive reverse. It is not.
 This is precisely what a motion to table
 was made for. It does not decide the
 merits. It gives us another opportunity,
 either never to do it, or to do it sometime,
 or even to do it later in this bill, in some
 way that suits us.
 I will vote for the motion to table. I
 do not intend to prejudice this effort to
 find a way to deal with what is a very
 knotty and, apparently, quite an original
 question, can a President unilaterally
 give notice of the termination-every-
 body is using the word "abrogate" and I
 know that is wrong. There is no abroga-
 tion here at all. The treaty says it can be
 terminated within 1 year by either of the
 parties.
 The question, Who is the Harty? It is
 the Government of the United States.
 But who acts for that Government? The
 President does lots of things under the
 Constitution. He commands our armies
 without congressional action. He can

 tive in foreign affairs, extending to put-
 ting an end to a relationship, it is clear,
 has not been questioned in almost two
 centuries of the Republic.
 At a time when the President is sug-
 gesting that he might assert a different
 premise, it seems to me. that we have a
 greater responsibility to be strict con-
 structionists, to be careful to attend to
 the precedent and to the clear practice
 of two centuries.
 I believe the Senator from New York
 is clearly correct in this, and I shall be
 happy to support him.
 Mr. JAVITS. I thank my colleague
 very much. I count his support very im-
 portant, considering his very rich back-
 ground in this field.
 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as a co-
 sponsor of this measure, I would like to
 put a question to those voicing opposi-
 tion to the vote.
 Hearings have been requested as a
 compromise. Would it be the intent of
 those proposing the hearings that the
 hearings would embrace the threshold
 question of whether or not the President
 acted properly in this case, before we, as
 a body, proceed with the measure before
 us, S. 245?
 Mr. JAVITS. As for me, I cannot say
 that I would agree to hold up this case
 until we had those hearings; but I cer-
 tainly would have no conceivable objec-
 tion to having the hearings cover every
 subject, including the President's action
 in this case. The only point the Senator
 made which I could not accept is that
 this should be held up until we decide.
 Mr. GLENN. Was it the Senator's in-
 tent that this would be held up until a
 decision was made?
 Mr. WARNER. I think that in the de-
 bate it has been brought forth that there
 are many serious questions, and. that is
 the predicate upon which the hearings
 were requested. Therefore, on the as-
 sumption that-there is a serious question
 should we not hold up this matter until
 the hearings produce a result on which
 we can vote as a body, thereby interpret-
 ing this provision in the Constitution?
 Mr. GLENN. I concur with Senator
 JAVITS. I think that in the consideration
 of what we are going to do, we examine
 every treaty that has been treated, in-
 cluding this one. But I would not want
 to hold up this legislation. Otherwise, it
 might go on for a long period of time.
 ? Mr. WARNER. The point made by
 Senator JAVITS was that we could make a
 grievous error if we proceeded now to
 vote on this matter, and suppose we came
 to the conclusion that the President
 lacks the power to terminate.
 Mr. JAVITS. I will tell the Senator why
 that is incorrect. I mentioned this morn-
 ing-and I repeat-that the committee
 had to answer two questions : one, what
 was its legal opinion about the Presi-
 dent's power to give notice of termina-
 tion? It said that that question is un-
 clear, and it gave no legal opinion, unless
 we adopt this amendment, and that
 squared away Senator GOLDWATER.
 I said we had another question, and
 that is, Shall we act on this legislation?
 That implies that we accept the fact that
 that mutual defense agreement is termi-
 nated and will be at the end of the year.
 We answered that in the afrmative. We
 will act. We are not passing on the gen-
 eral issue, but in this case we are going
 to act on. the hypothesis that it is termi-
 nated. .
 That seems. to me to square. exactly
 with why I say we would sit on this until
 such time as we decided. We have de-
 cided. We are ready to act on this partic-
 ular matter.
 Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.
 I yield the floor.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I had thought it might be possible to
 reach a vote this evening in relation to
 this amendment, but a good many Sena-
 tors have gone from the Hill. Therefore,
 I ask unanimous consent that a vote in
 relation to the pending amendment
 occur tomorrow at 12 o'clock noon.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection?
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, reserving the right to object, is it
 the intention of the majority leader that
 there be 20 minutes or a half hour, or
 something like that, for debate prior
 thereto?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I would be
 glad to include that in the order, Mr.
 President, that beginning at 11 a.m.,
 there be 1 hour of debate, to be equally
 divided between Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR.,
 and Mr. GLENN; that, in the meantime,
 the Senate, by unanimous consent, could
 set aside this amendment in order to
 take up other amendments or other
 matters.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Would
 votes be taken on other amendments?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. They could
 be. I doubt that there would be, at this
 hour, it being almost 7 p.m. The agree-
 ment would allow for only 1 hour
 prior to the debate on the pending
 amendment.
 I really would like to come in at 9
 o'clock tomorrow and have 2 hours on
 other matters, but -I could assure the
 Senator that there would be no other
 amendment voted on prior to his, if he
 wishes me to include that in the order.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I think
 that might be desirable.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. The Senator
 understands that this request does not
 waive the right of Senators to move to
 table.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. That is
 correct.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection? The Chair hears none, and
 it is so ordered.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thank the
 Senator from Virginia, and I thank all
 Senators.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, I ask unanimous consent that the
 Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. PROXMIRE)
 be listed as -a cosponsor of the pend-
 ing amendment, imprinted amendment
 No. 30.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 ? Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, as we
 turn to S. 245, the Taiwan Enabling Act,
 I believe it appropriate to note the im-
 portance of this legislation. It is impor-
 tant not only to continuing our good
 and  mutually  beneficial  relationship
 S 2163
 with Taiwan, but also as a means to
 insure that as we embark on the promis-
 ing but uncharted course of our new
 relationship. with the People's Republic
 of China we remain steadfast in our al-
 legiance to our friends and our princi-
 ples as a nation.
 As I have said many times in the past,
 Mr. President, I have no quarrel with
 our recognition of the People's Republic
 of China, which I have long considered
 the inevitable and logical conclusion to
 the process begun with President Nixon's
 visit to Peking in 1973. This significant
 step in the process of normalization must
 be managed carefully and developed with
 a realistic appraisal on both sides of
 the Pacific of its prospects.' It is a re-
 lationship that offers both problems and
 promises, but I am convinced that it
 can contribute significantly to the inter-
 ests of the United States.
 Nevertheless,` in developing that new
 relationship,  however  promising,  the
 United States must not sacrifice our prin-
 ciples of integrity and credibility as a
 nation. So as it pertains to' the manner
 in which we treated our longtime friend
 and ally, the people and government on
 Taiwan, I do quarrel with the adminis-
 tration's recognition of Peking. In not
 seeking assurances that the dispute be-
 tween Peking and Taipei be settled
 peacefully-in not seeking to maintain
 an official relationship with Taipei-and
 by acting precipitously without prior
 consultation with the Congress or with
 officials of the Government of the Re-
 public  of China-the  administration
 treated cavalierly and shabbily a friend
 of the United States. In doing so the
 administration tarnished our integrity
 and credibility and, if for no other rea-
 son, this legislation, as amended by the
 Foreign Relations Committee, is ex-
 tremely important.
 This legislation helps to remove that
 tarnish, Mr. President, because it now
 contains a provision that I believe re-
 flects the overwhelming sentiment of the
 American people to the continued secu-

 it provides a mechanism of maintaining
 our relationship with Taiwan greatly im-
 proved over that proposed by the admin-
 istration. Although no mechanism so
 constructed could substitute for a con-
 tinued official relationship, I believe this
 will suffice as the foundation for a sound
 and prosperous relationship in the years
 to come.
 It may be, Mr. President, that the
 Senate will wish to modify or strengthen
 the language reported out of the Foreign
 Relations Committee. More important
 than the mere words, however, is the
 spirit of the commitment of the Ameri-
 can people to preserve our relationship
 with a secure Taiwan. That commitment
 will hold firm even as we move forward
 in the development of a new relation-
 ship with the Chinese on the mainland.?

 I  intend  to  support  strengthening
 amendments, I will not oppose S. 245,

 going security commitment to that island
 nation.
 But I deplore the sequence of events
 which has made the bill necessary, a
 sequence.which to my mind is part and
 parcel of an overall foreign policy which
 quite frankly frightens me. With this in
 mind, I will leave it to my distinguished
 colleagues to debate the finer points of
 S. 245, while confining my observations
 to the deplorable decision to jettison
 Taiwan, which made this bill necessary.
 THE DECISION
 Few in this body seriously object to
 extending diplomatic recognition to the
 People's Republic of China (PRC). I
 think most of us felt that this was a de-
 cision bound to come and even to a cer-
 tain extent overdue.
 But I do object, and I believe many
 of my colleagues object, to the manner
 in which the announcement was made,
 to the absence of consultation with the
 Congress, and to the extremely poor na-
 ture of the bargain struck.
 Quite literally in the dead of night and
 right in the middle of the holiday season
 with Congress out of town and the. Na-
 tion preoccupied with other matters,
 President Carter presented us with a
 secretly negotiated, fait accompli. As I
 understand it, our allies of some 30 years
 standing were cut loose with less than 1
 hour's notice. This was a bit much from
 an administration which had made a
 campaign issue of the secretive nature of
 its predecessor's "Lone Ranger" methods
 and fancied itself to be in the Wilsonian
 tradition of "open covenants openly ar-
 rived at."
 Yet, bad as it was to not consult with
 our allies, neglecting "prior consulta-
 tion" with the Congress in clear viola-
 tion of the Dole-Stone amendment to the
 International Security Assistance Act of
 1978 was even worse. Although the ad-
 ministration did claim to have consulted
 with some Senators, this apparently con-
 sisted of at best a few hours' notice prior
 to the President's appearance on na-
 tional television. As a cosponsor of the
 Dole-Stone amendment, this was cer-
 tainly not my idea of "prior consulta-
 tion" and I doubt whether it will satisfy
 any of the other 93 of my colleagues who
 approved the amendment in a unani-
 mous vote.
 In fact, the suddenness of the decision
 made in extreme secrecy at a time when
 Congress was not in session could cer-
 tainly lead one to believe that the admin-
 istration intentionally chose to evade the
 provisions of the Dole-Stone amendment.
 This is particularly disturbing from an
 administration which had chided its
 predecessor for not working well with
 Congress on foreign policy and which had
 pledged to the electorate in 1976 to do
 better.
 But it is the substance of the China
 decision that I object to most. The Peo-
 ple's Republic of China got everything it
 has asked for and then some. The United
 States was left with scarcely a fig leaf to
 cover what I consider a disastrous re-
 treat. And Taiwan, of course, got nothing
 at all.
 President Nixon could have secured the
 same terms in 1972 at the time of the
 Shanghai Communique. President Ford
 could certainly have secured them during
 his term of office. Indeed, it is fair to say
 that the terms offered by Teng Hsiao-
 p'ing and accepted by President Carter
 are little different than those offered to
 and rejected by five Presidents over the
 last 20 years.
 The substance of the People's Republic
 of China demands has been known for a
 long time. The People's Republic of China
 has insisted: First, that diplomatic rela-
 tions with Taiwan had to be terminated;
 second, that all.U.S. military forces and
 installations had to be removed from the
 island; and third, that the United States-
 Republic  of  China Mutual  Security
 Treaty had to be terminated.
 Mr. President, the People's Republic of
 China achieved each and every one of
 these objectives. They also got a 1-year
 moratorium on new arms sales commit-
 ments by the United States to Taiwan.
 In exchange for what? We can now
 call our mission in Peking an embassy
 rather than a liaison office. But, as the
 Foreign Relations Committee noted in its
 committee report on S. 245, the liaison
 office already was an embassy in all but
 name. The People's Republic of China
 has promised to be somewhat more sym-
 pathetic to economic offers tendered by
 our businessmen. But then again, the
 present political climate is very volatile
 It could change, leaving our business-
 men right back where they started.
 Finally, the People's Republic of China
 might even look the other way if we were
 to sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature
 after the end of the year. But as the com-
 mittee hearings show, even this is far
 from certain.
 What about the use of force? Would
 the People's Republic of China pledge not
 to use force in resolving the Taiwan
 issue? Teng Hsiao-p'ing made it clear
 while in this country that it would not.
 Although the Foreign Relations Commit-
 tee has gone to some length to express
 our concern that the Taiwan situation
 be resolved peacefully, the fact is the
 administration proceeded to recognize
 Peking without any commitment at all
 from the People's Republic of China on.
 this score.
 In exchange for tangible concessions
 of a concrete nature, then, we have se-
 cured ambiguous assurances from a 74-
 year-old leader of a highly explosive
 country, and nothing at all about a re-
 nunciation of the use of force. If Mr.
 Teng is in control in the People's Repub-
 lic of China today, he may not be tomor-
 row, and there is no way for anyone to
 be certain just what'will happen to Presi-
 dent Carter's new China policy once
 Teng passes from the scene.
 ITS CONSEQUENCES
 Mr. President, I strongly believe that
 this new China policy is built on sand.
 I also believe that it is morally reprehen-
 sible in that we are abandoning a tried
 and trusted friend without cause and
 taking up with that friend's mortal
 enemy.
 Let me turn now for a moment to the
 consequences. In foreign policy, as in
 any other area of human endeavor, our
 actions produce certain effects. It seems
 to me that the effects of the new China
 policy will be of at least three sorts:
 First, on ourselves; second, on our al-
 lies; and third, on our adversaries.
 For ourselves, I cannot believe that
 this action, in the aftermath of Vietnam
 and in view of all the President's cam-
 paign promises,of a more moral foreign
 policy, says very much that is favorable
 about the kind of moral image we Ameri-
 cans wish to convey to the world. Surely
 power politics is a' difficult business in
 the best of times. But the American
 people have always thought themselves
 better than the sordid norm. Although
 historically as a nation we have done
 what we had to do to survive, we have
 legitimately looked upon our nation at
 something better, a moral beacon amid
 the squalor of Old World rivalries.
 In the past we left the bobbing and
 weaving and moral ambiguity,to others'
 Now we have turned, I believe viciously
 and without cause, on a close friend. I
 cannot believe that. this conforms to
 what our people have a right to expect
 this Nation to be in foreign affairs. And
 I am sure that our people will waste no
 time in repudiating it. But I am afraid
 that the cynicism and arrogance char-
 acteristic of turning on a friend will have
 left an additional scar which it might
 take some years to erase.
 And what about our other friends and
 allies  overseas?  Mr.  President,  how
 would you like to be sitting in Bonn,
 Tokyo, Riyadh, Tel Aviv, or Brussels?
 To say nothing of London, Paris, Rome,
 or anywhere else this ' country is relied
 upon    for  security  assistance?  Quite
 frankly, an American administration ca-
 pable of turning 180 degrees and re-
 pudiating its most solemnly pledged
 commitment to an ally of 30 years'
 standing is capable of most anything.
 And those responsible for the destinies
 of these and other friendly nations know
 this very well.
 We in Nevada have a strong tradition
 of personal integrity. A man's word is his
 bond, and either you can trust him or
 you cannot. World politics, at bottom, is
 no different. Nations, like individuals,
 need to have reputations for trustworthi-
 ness and reliability. Those who do will
 find their share of friendship and sup-
 port in the world. Those who do not risk
 being thrust backward, alone and iso-
 lated to face a hard world on its own
 terms.
 This country in particular needs to be
 mindful of this lesson. Since the end of
 World War II, we have entrusted our
 security to a network of regional alli-,
 antes,  the common denominator of
 which has been the very same mutual
 security pledge violated by the adminis-
 tration's December 15 announcement.
 Whether we will be able to continue to
 do so now becomes an open question.
 For our adversaries the lessons of De-
 cember 15 must be even more perplexing.
 Press reports during the time of Vice
 Premier Teng's visit indicated that the
 administration had caved in so readily
 on Taiwan that Teng apparently began
 to wonder whether we would be of any
 use to him in his efforts to contain Mos-
 cow. The Russians are, of course, al-
 ready strongly entrenched in Southeast
 Asia, courtesy of their Vietnamese ally,

 and with their Navy present in ever
 greater numbers in the Western Pacific
 have been given a virtual carte blanche
 to Involve themselves even more actively
 in matters pertaining to the Formosa
 Straits.
 Yet I am sure that even Moscow and
 Peking have had second thoughts about
 our capricous abandonment of a close
 ally. In the nuclear age, a certain amount
 of predictability is desirable in relations
 between adversaries, just as it is among
 allies. Nations with their fingers on'a
 nuclear trigger need to know that the
 other side is reasonable, rational, and not
 likely to do anything foolish. A policy
 such as that announced by the President
 on December 15, indicating an ability
 and a willingness to turn a full 180 de-
 grees throws all such reassuring assump-
 -tions out the window and adds a disturb-
 ing element of instability to the nuclear
 balance.
 Mr. President, I am unhappy with S.
 245. Not for what it does, but for what it
 represents. We in the Senate need to-pass
 It to do what we can to make the best
 of a bad bargain. But I am afraid that
 our Nation and those immediately re-
 sponsible will be long time living that
 bargain down.O
 ORDER  FOR  ROUTINE  MORNING  BUSINESS
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 following any further discussion of this
 amendment this evening, I ask unani-
 mous consent that there be a period for
 the transaction of routine morning busi-
 ness, not to extend beyond 30 minutes,
 with statements therein limited to 5 min-
 utes each.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection?
 Mr.. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserv-
 ing the right to object, I ask the Senator
 if this means there will be no more roll-
 call votes tonight.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. There will be
 no more rollcall votes tonight.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. The re-
 quest of the majority leader was that
 when the discussion of this amendment
 concludes, there be routine morning
 business?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection? The Chair hears none, and
 it is so ordered.
 UP AMENDMENT NO. 31
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I send
 technical amendment to the desk. The
 present section 107 should be 106(c);
 other sections should be renumbered
 accordingly.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 amendment will. be stated.
 The assistant legislative clerk read as
 follows:
 The Senator from Ohio (Mr. GLENN) pro-
 poses an unprinted amendment numbered
 31:
 The present section 107 should be renum-
 bered section 106(c). Other sections should
 be renumbered accordingly.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.. The
 question is on agreeing to the amend-
 ment.
 The amendment was agreed to.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, I should like to make several very
 brief comments.
 The pending amendment, UP amend-
 ment No. 30, does not take away from
 the President any power the President
 has. What it says is perfectly clear: It
 is the sense of the Senate that approval
 by the Senate of the United States is
 required to terminate any mutual de-
 fense treaty between the United States
 and another nation.
 It was brought out clearly in colloquy
 between the Senator from North Caro-
 lina (Mr. HELMS) and the Senator from
 Virginia that it has nothing to do with
 the President's right, the President's au-
 thority, to give the 1-year notice of his
 intention. to submit to the Senate the
 abrogation of,a particular treaty. It does
 not take any power away from the. Pres-
 ident. What it seeks to do is to say to
 the President that he cannot unilaterally
 abrogate a treaty. It is a very clear
 amendment.
 All sorts of red herrings have been
 brought into this discussion this evening,
 but they do not apply in most cases. This.
 takes nothing away from the President.
 It does assert the Senate's constitutional
 role in the treaty-making process, and
 in the treaty terminating process.
 Contrary to what has been implied by
 the Senator from New York, this amend-
 ment would have no effect whatsoever
 to invalidate the notice already given by
 the President. That has been done. The
 amendment does not in any way chal-
 lenge that authority. The amendment
 does not even state an opinion for or
 against that decision; the amendment
 simply asserts the Senate's view of the
 constitutional role of the Senate in this
 important area. If we are unwilling even
 to state our view, then we can expect to
 be ignored in this and future cases.
 Several Senators addressed the Chair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sena-
 tor from Wisconsin.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I un-
 derstand we are in the morning hour.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 further discussion on the-amendment
 offered by the Senator from Virginia?
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, it is
 my understanding there is no further
 discussion of Senator  BYRD'S  amend
 ment. The majority leader has secured
 unanimous consent that we be in a
 morning hour and that a morning hour
 be permitted to make statements until
 7:30 p.m.
 ROUTINE MORNING BUSINESS
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there
 be no further discussion of the amend-
 ment, pursuant to the previous order,
 there will now be a period for routine
 morning business.
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Yes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 morning business?
 AMIN: A REMINDER OF GENOCIDE
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, re-
 cently there have been news reports
 from Africa that the government of Idi
 Amin is beginning to crumble. After a
 4-month war with Tanzania, the Ugan-
 dan army is tired and discouraged. Ma-
 chinegun fire can be heard in Kampala
 ,almost every night. Some reports claim
 52165
 that 80 members of Amin's family have
 been evacuated from Uganda.
 If the Amin government falls, it'will
 mean the end of one of the most brutal
 and oppressive regimes  of the last
 decade. It will mean the overthrow of
 an egomaniacal  tyrant  of  the  last
 slaughter of hundreds of thousands of
 Ugandans. How has this butcher been
 allowed to murder Acholi and Langi
 tribesmen as well as Christians for the
 last 8 years? What has the United States
 done to halt these atrocities? Sadly, the
 answer is nothing. While we have polite-
 ly condemned genocide in Uganda, we
 have dragged our feet in ratification_ of
 the only international treaty which at-.
 tempts to prevent and punish mass-
 murder: the Genocide Convention.
 Over the last 30 years while we have
 considered and reconsidered the Geno-
 cide Convention, millions upon millions
 of people have been the victims of
 genocide.
 As we hail the imminent demise of the
 regime of Idi Amin, we must see to it that
 such human devastation never recurs.
 One way to accomplish this is that we
 must ratify the Genocide Convention.
 MUTUAL SAVINGS BANKS
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, on
 January 9, 1979, the U.S. district court
 for the district of New Jersey ruled that
 provisions of New Jersey law which pro-
 hibit                                                                                              geographical  discrimination  in
 mortgage lending are applicable to na-
 tional banks. I am pleased with this re-
 sult. It is consistent with the legislative
 history of the Equal Credit Opportunity
 Act Amendments of 1976 which I belive
 makes clear that State laws prohibiting
 discrimination in lending, and which
 provide greater protection to applicants,
 should apply  to  federally  chartered
 creditors.   C
 Last August, in a similar case involv-
 ing the State of California's antiredlin-
 Ing law, the U.S. district court for the
 eastern) district of California ruled that
 Federal law preempts State antidiscrim-
 ination laws at they apply to federally
 chartered savings and loan associations.
 This case is now on appeal, and I hope
 the appeal is successful.
 Last. October, Congress passed legis-
 lation to give mutual savings banks au-
 thority to convert to a Federal charter.
 One provision of this legislation explic-
 itly provides that mutual savings banks
 converting to a Federal charter must
 continue to comply with applicable State
 law pertaining to discrimination in the
 extension of home mortgage loans or
 adjustments in the terms of mortgage
 instruments based on neighborhood or
 geographical area, if the Federal Home
 Loan Bank board determines that State
 law and regulations impose more strin-
 gent requirements than.Federal law and
 regulations. When this legislation was
 being considered by the Senate, I engaged
 in a discussion with Senator Brooke on
 the Senate floor designed to make clear
 that this explicit provision addressed
 only the issue of applicability of State
 law to converting mutual savings banks,
 and that this new provision did not affect
 existing law applicable to Federal savings

 and loan associations. My remarks at
 that time were certainly not intended,
 and could not in any case, contravene or
 reverse the legislative history of the
 Equal Credit Opportunity Act Amend-
 ments. Last year's legislation simply did
 not address this issue, one way or the
 other.
 In response to a question from Senator
 Brooke on the Senate floor last October,
 one of my comments was that Federal
 law will continue to govern Federal sav-
 ings and loan associations in the anti-
 discrimination area. This statement was
 made in the larger context of a statement
 explaining that the then pending legisla-
 tion would not change existing law in
 this area as it affects Federal savings
 and loans. It also gave recognition to the
 fact that at that time, the only court
 interpretation of existing law was that
 Federal savings and loans were not sub-
 ject to State antidiscrimination laws.
 Since that time, as I have noted, the
 U.S. district court for the district of New
 Jersey has issued a ruling with respect
 to New Jersey's antiredlining law. While
 that ruling applies to national banks, it
 is possible that some of the court's rea-
 soning may bear on the legal situation
 as it affects Federal savings and loans.
 Also, as I have noted, the California case
 is on appeal. My remarks last October
 were certainly not intended to affect the
 outcome of the appeal of that case, which
 should be decided on its own merits in
 accordance with existing law regarding
 the applicability of State antidiscrimi-
 nation laws to Federal savings and loans,
 which, as I have noted, was not changed
 one way or the other by last year's legis-
 lation. If the appeal of the California
 case is successful, then certain of my re-
 marks made last October would be ren-
 dered inaccurate and inapplicable.
 Mr. President, I am making these com-
 ments because I have just learned that
 the bank board has cited my remarks
 of last October in its brief in defense of
 the appeal of the California case. Since
 I believe that the board's citation of my
 comments was done in a manner which
 misinterprets the basis and intent of my
 remarks, I believe it is necessary for me
 to set the record straight.
 THE DEATH 'OF GEN. MUSTAFA
 BARZANI
 Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I
 take a moment to take notice of the
 death of Gen. Mustafa Barzani who for
 40 years fought for the freedom of his
 Kurdish people. On one occasion about
 3 years ago General Barzani asked to
 come to my office. Through an interpret-
 er he explained that he was present to
 thank me for a speech I had made deal-
 ing with the repressive measures taken
 against Kurdish tribesmen and women
 by the Iraqi and Iranian regimes. He
 spoke softly and directly. He indicated
 that one of.the major disappointments
 of his life was the reversal in policy dic-
 tated by Secretary of State Kissinger
 that led to the bloody suppression of his
 revolt against the Iraqi Government. He
 asked for assistance, where possible, for
 Kurdish refugees. And then he left. He
 had said what he came to say.
 The story of the U.S. role in the Kur-
 dish revolt is not a pleasant one. It is an
 example of the worst form of geopoli-
 tics, the political games played by indi-
 viduals and nations. When it served U.S.
 purposes, we supplied aid to the Kurdish
 cause. And when Secretary Kissinger felt
 it necessary to seal an alliance with the
 Shah of Iran, who was increasingly con-
 cerned about his western border, then
 the United States abruptly withdrew its
 assistance. The Kurdish people were the
 pawns in the chess game.
 When Secretary Kissinger speaks of
 not allowing concern for human rights
 to dominate U.S. policy, perhaps he is
 thinking of the example of the Kurdish
 people-a four century struggle for inde-
 pendence that once looked promising but
 was snuffed out in a quick behind-the-
 scenes diplomatic agreement.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that articles from the Washington
 Post and New York Times on General
 Barzani be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Washington Post, Mar. 3, 1979)
 GEN. MUSTAFA BARZANI, EXILED
 KURDISH CHIEFTAIN, DIES
 (By J. Y. Smith)
 Gen. Mustafa Barzani, the colorful guer-
 rilla chieftain who unsuccessfully fought for
 Kurdish independence in Iraq for more than
 15 years, died Thursday evening at George-
 town University Hospital following a heart
 attack. He was 76.
 Gen. Barzani, who was known to his fol-
 lowers as "the grand old man of Kurdish
 independence," came to the United States
 in June 1976. He was suffering from lung
 cancer and  underwent treatment at the
 Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He lived in
 Washington, and at the time of his death,
 in McLean.
 His exile here began a year after the col-
 lapse of his final campaign before an on-
 slaught by the Soviet-equipped Iraqi army
 in the spectacular mountain regions that are
 the homeland of the Kurds.
 The military defeat followed a political dis-
 aster. In March 1975, Iran withdrew its sup-
 port for the Kurds as part of the settlement
 of a border dispute with Iraq. The two na-
 tions had been on the point of open war
 over the Kurdish question. The settlement
 of the border question defused this threat
 and with it what some regarded as a much
 wider threat to stability in the Middle East.
 Thus, the United States supported it.
 Gen. Barzani and about 200,000 of the es-
 timated 2 million Kurds living In northeast-
 ern Iraq fled to Iran, which offered them the
 choice of remaining-there is a sizable Kurd-
 ish population in Iran-or of returning to
 Iraq.
 Shortly before We fled, Gen. Barzani told
 an interviewer "Sometimes things are good.
 Sometimes they are bad. Now they are bad.
 It is a fact of life."
 Ironically, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi
 of Iran, who had withdrawn Iranian support
 of the Kurds, also was in exile at the time
 of Gen. Barzani's death, having been forced
 to leave his country by the revolution of
 supporters of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho-
 meini.
 . Gen. Barzani's departure from Iraq in
 1975 ended a 17-year period in which he was
 i;he most visible of Kurdish leaders. In 1958,
 he had returned from an 11-year exile in the
 Soviet Union to a hero's welcome in Bagh-
 dad, the Iraqi capital. The Iraqi army had
 just overthrown the British-backed Hashe-
 mite dynasty and had launched Iraq on a
 I
 path of socialism and intense Arab nation.
 alism.
 At first, it appeared that the new regime
 would be agreeable to allowing the Kurds
 a measure of autonomy. When these hopes
 failed, Gen. Barzani led his troops, the Pesh
 Merga, which means "forward to death,"
 into battle.
 The war continued intermittently for 10
 years. In 1970, the Iraqis, their resources
 sorely strained by the effort, agreed to give
 the Kurds substantially what they wanted.
 They were to have their own local govern-
 ment and armed forces, five seats in the
 Iraqi cabinet and a vice presidency.
 On however small a scale, this would have
 been the realization of a Kurdish dream.
 The Kurds claim a history of 4,000 years.
 There are an estimated 12 million of then
 living in an area encompassing the borders
 of five countries: Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Un-
 ion, Syria and Turkey. An Aryan people with
 an Indo-European language, they are Sunni.
 Moslems.
 An independent Kurdistan had been prom-
 ised by the Treaty of Sevres in 1920 be-
 tween the Allied powers and Turkey. The
 promise was ignored by all parties.
 Gen. Barzani apparently had doubts that
 the Iraqi proposals of 1970 would be Im-
 plemented. In September 1971, nine persons
 dressed as holy men visited him at'his head-
 quarters in the village of Haj Omran near the
 Iranian border. One was a "human bomb."
 When he exploded, four other "holy men"
 and a Kurdish soldier were killed. Gen. Bar-
 zani escaped unharmed. His followers blamed
 the Iraqis for the attempt on his life.
 The Iraqi concessions were to be imple-
 mented by 1974. As the deadline drew near,
 it appeared that they would not. The major
 stumbling block was the Kurdish claim to
 the rich Kirkkuk oil fields and a failure to
 reach agreement on the boundaries of the
 Kurdish sphere.
 It was at this point that the shah of Iran
 offered to support Gen. Barzani in a renewed
 war against the Iraqis. The Israelis also re-
 portedly offered covert assistance ,because
 Israel shared Iran's interest in tying down
 the Iraqi army and because it was concerned
 about its Iranian oil supplies.
 According to the House Select Committee
 on Intelligence (the Pike Report), Gen. Bar-
 zani insisted on a U.S. guarantee of the
 shah's good intentions. The United States
 agreed to this, and supplied the Kurds with
 "untraceable" captured Soviet and Chinese
 arms through Iran.
 Iranian army units took part in the sub-
 sequent fighting and Iraqi forces made In-
 cursions inside the Iranian border.
 The Pike report maintains that the Kurds
 would have gained at least some measure of
 autonomy without further fighting. It is
 said the United States hoped that the Kurds
 would wear down the Iraquis, but that there'
 was no intention of supporting Gen. Barzani
 through to victory.
 In exile here, Gen. Barzani occasionally
 spoke out in favor of Kurdish rights. Mostly,
 his life was quiet.
 He was born in the village of Barzan in
 Iraqi Kurdistan into a family of religious
 scholars and tribal leaders. He earned the
 title of mullah, or religious wise man. After
 his years in the Soviet Union, he sometimes
 was called "the Red Mullah."
 He got his first experience of oppression
 at the age of 3, when he and 25 members of
 his family were imprisoned by officials of the
 old Ottoman Empire. He was in jail for nine
 months on that occasion.
 In 1931, he and 40 other members of the
 family were restricted to a small village
 after Gen. Barzani's brother, a tribal leader,
 led an unsuccessful uprising against the Brit-
 ish. But he remained acti,'ve in behalf of
 Kurdish independence throughout the 1930s
 and into the .1940s.
