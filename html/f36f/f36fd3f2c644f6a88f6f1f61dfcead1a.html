 OONFIDLids il:,
 Under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Northwest
 China Military and Administrative Committee, the Provincial People's Government
 of Sinkiang accomplished the following tasks in 1950:
 1.  Counterrevolutionary Activity
 In the campaign to eliminate bandits and special agents, the people's
 police, together with the public security units and other public security
 organs at all levels, broke up six large spy rings, one spy hideout, and seven
 spy cells or undercover groups.  They arrested 369 special agents and counter-
 revolutionaries,   and a-gosed 66 cases of secret and counterrevolutionary plots.
 Of these, the people's Judicial authorities tried, in accordance with law, 31
 different cases involving a total of 212 persons.
 In the various areas, a total of over 500 professional special agents,
 over 3,000 intelligence personnel, and 879 persons in charge of training special
 agents and rounterrevolutionar.tes registered with the local authorities.  With
 the exception of F  'cry :.mall  ,umber, most of these persons confessed their sins
 and were allowed to reform themselves through labor.
 In addition, many Kuomintang organizations, the San-min Chu-i Youth
 Corps, and other counterrevolutionary organizations were broken un and several
 thousand persons belonging to the enemy party were reriste,'od.           -        _
 ment captured from or surrendered by bandit agents include 4 light machine guns,
 531 rifles and pistols, 7 boxes of explosives, and LAC radios and other equip-
 ment.
 Altogether, the various departments of the provincial people's govern-
 ment reformed 7,759 thieves, exposed and tried 1,545 bur'lary cases, 120 rob-
 bery cases, 227 criminal cases, and 49 cases of wilful interference and obstruction
 of the currency and financial systems.  At important rural and urban centers a
 total of 1,730 cells were established for the purpose of eliminating bandits and
 spies and for protecting the work of production.
 Recently, the Public Security Bureau sponsored an "Antitraitor and
 Special Agent Liquidation Exhibition" which crew a daily average of more than
 5,000 visitors.  As a result, it has nog only given a serious warning as well
 as a deadly blow to the special agents who were still in hiding and continuing
 their activities, but it has also immensely promoted the political consciousness
 of the people of all races and nationalities in Sinkiang.
 2.  Political Reorganization
 Since the establishment of the provincial people's government, reorgan-
 ization has been made ,ten by step in all levels of the old political structures
 throughtout the province. By 'ebruary or March 1950, with the exception of the 23
 hsien governments in the three special ch'u  of I-li, T'a-ch'eng, and A-shan,
 preliminary work had been done on the reform and establishment of or.e municipal
 government, seven special ch'u governments, 53 hsien governments and the Ch'i-
 chiao-thing Central Ch'u.
 Subsequently, conferences of people's representatives of all circles and
 all nationalities were called in the various hsien and shih.  Each of the 78 hsien
 throughout Sinkiang held their first conference; the 12 hsien in Ti-hua Special
 Ch'u, the six hsien in I-li Special Ch'u, and most of the hsien in the six special
 ch'u of Ha-mi, K o-shih, Ho-t ien, A-k'o-su, So-ch'e, and Yen-ch'i held their
 second conference; Urumchi held its third conference.
 In all the Sinkiang hrtcn work had also been done in the reform  and estab-
 lishment of a total of 958 kung-she, 1,275 hsiang governments, 149 hsiang kung-she
 (So-thee not included), and 7,166 ts'un.  Further, in each hsien of the Ti-hua

 and Ha-mi special ch'u and parts of the nomadic stock-farming areas in Yen-ch'i
 1-i Ao-chine, 'perial ch'u, ch'u chiefs were appointed, hsiang chiefs were elected
 by the people, and the old pao-chia system of classifying territory was abolished.
 With respect to setting forth the policies and tasks for liquidating
 bandits and special agents, for increasing production and developing cultural
 affairs, for strengthening the unity of the people and the government, and for
 consolidating and enlarging the people's united front, consultative committees
 were established and people's representative-- conferences were field: the Kazakh
 people's representatives conferences held in the Ti-hua ;.,)ecial Chu were fol-
 .-.owed by similar conferences in Ha-mi Special Chu and by Kazakh people's con-
 sultative committee meetings at '_hen-hsi, Ch'i-t'ai, F'u-yuan, and 14u-lei-ho.
 These conferences strengthened the unity of the people of the Kazakh nationality,
 organized militia, isolated the bandit group under Bandit Chief Osman, and set
 the aims and tasks for developing economic and cultural constructions in the
 romadic stock-farming areas.
 In ridition, the provincial people's government called a joint confer-
 ence of all special ch'u and hsien chiefs in Sinkiang in August 1550 for the
 purpose of strengthening the cooperation of provincial goverrment and the special
 ch'u and hsien governments.   In that conference, bureaucratic practices, the
 manner of giving orders, and all disorderly and disorganized conditions were
 criticized and attacked.   In addition, a summary of the activities of the pro-
 vincial government during the first 8 months of 1950 was made, policies for
 levying farm taxes were set forth, the amount of grain to be set aside as the
 public share was discussed, and many urgent problems of the various special ch'u
 and  hsien were solved.
 After reform had been carried out in the various levels of the govern-
 mental structure, revolutionary and progressive elements, as well as represent-
 atives of all circles and all nationalities within Sinkiang, were selected to
 fill important positions in the various levels of the governments.
 In February 1950, study centers for political and government workers
 were established with branches and sub-branches extendinc to all local govern-
 ments, for the purpose of strengthening the political education of all govern-
 ment workers.   In addition, a campaign was launched to oppose corruption ard
 bureaucratic practices.   As a result, corrupt and bureaucratic elements were
 severely criticized.  Furthermore, model workers were selected to set-good ex-
 amples.  Great efforts were made to enable those who had s?rked for the old
 regime, and were perv'itted to continue their work, to distinguish right from
 wrong, to overcome bad habits, to reform old concepts, and to form the attitude
 of serving the people as their highest personal aim.   In doing this, the govern-
 ment workers were sent to cadre training classes for reform and the first group
 of them, totaling 1,328 persons, were graduated in Septem?,er 1950 and were as-
 signed to work.  As a result,  the enthusiasm as well as the efficiency of these
 workers has been greatly i:creased.
 For the purpose of giving vocational and technical training to Sinkiang
 youth, 1,233 persons were recruited from different nationalities for training
 in commerce, animal husbandry, law, interpretation, and translation.   Other
 government agencies, such as the Finance Office, the Public Security Office, the
 Transportation Office, and the Agriculture and Forests;' Office, also sponsored
 separ.~te training classes, and more than 5,000 persons were trained to do special
 work with their respective agencies in 1950.

 3.  Economic Development
 Although the territory of Sinkiang is vast, its economic foundation is
 very weak and there is a lack of the means of transportation and communications.
 In April 1950, in responding to the call of  he Central People's Government for
 financial and economic unification and centralization, work was begun to deter-
 mine the levying of taxes and to set up a system of financial budgeting and ex-
 amination. Currencies in the third and the seventh ch'u were standardized and
 investigations were made to ascertain the amounts of materials in storage.   As a
 resalt, the provincial government alone discovered supplies and equipments worth
 7,. 100, 820, 0i,0 yuan.
 Steps were also taken to facilitate trade with the Soviet Union for the
 purpose of raising commodity prices and the people of Sinkiang obtained :onsider-
 able benefits.  For example, in December 1949, a Colt of cloth could be exchanged
 for 2,113 tattles of barley _'n Urumchi, whereas in November 1950 it could be ex-
 changed for only 267.42 catties, indicating a sixfold increase in agricultural
 products.   Again, in December 1949, a bolt of cloth could be exchanged for 201.42
 catties of wool, whereas in November 1950 it could be exchanged for only 30 cat-
 ties, indicating a fivefold increase in woolen products.  With the e,?t~ q?. Riven
 by the Central People's Government, the assistance; rendered by the People's
 Liberation Army stationed in Sinkiang, and with the support o1' the people of Sin-
 kiang, the provincial government was able to pull itself through its economic
 and financial difficulties.
 With respect to commerce and industry, a Labor Bureau was established
 and commercial and industrial enterprises organized to improve the relation be-
 tween employers and employees and to adjust the relationship between private
 and state-ow-'' enterprises.  According to investigations made, 766 new cormercial
 and industrial _Jtablishments made their appea ?nce in Urumchi and h30 in Kuldja.
 Increases in commercial and industrial establishments were also registered in
 other centers.   At present, great efforts are being made to develop and expand
 cooperative enterprises by establishing cooperative supply, distribution, and re-
 tail stations to eliminate exploitation by middlemen and to fulfill the objective
 of "strengthening rural-urban cooperation and facilitating rural-urban commerce."
 The textile industries have begun work; the electric power plants are being built
 and equipped; the petroleum company and the metallurgical company, under joint
 Sino-Soviet ownership and operation, have been established.
 In resprnding to Chairman Mao's appeal of 1950 to increase production,
 great efforts were made by the provincial government to boost the labor and pro-
 duction enthusiasm of the people by carrying on extensive propaganda activities
 p:..oug the farmers during their spring plowing.   in addition, policies were for-
 mulated with respect to the renting of public land, totaling 341,333 mou.  The
 provincial government also made available 62,725 piculs of seeds, 7,446 head of
 draft animals, 41,446 sets of farm implements, 5,783 carts, and 2,251 bags.
 Further, the provincial government made available a 1 092,264 yuan agricultural
 loan to the people, 13,360,000 piculs of grains for the use of the farmers, a
 180,892,000 Yuan loan for handicraft business, and a 11,484,941,400 Yuan loan
 for irrigation projects.
 The work to ensure a bumper crop included:  digging wells, repairing
 and clearing ranals and ;aterways, and building reservoirs.  In addition, a
 water conservancy  committee was established to regulate the use and distribu-
 tion of water, taus enabling the farmers, especially the poor and the middle-
 class farmers, to obtain an adequate supply of water.   In gereral, increase in
 production and output was made in most of the special ch'u with the exception
 of A-span, where production was lowered by 20 percent due to drought (however,
 livestock was increased by 20 percent), a-li, where production was also lowered due
 to lack of organizatinttfor springtime work, as well as bad weather, and in Ti-
 hua Special Ch'u where the fields were not planted in time due tc disturbances
 caused by bandits..

 CONFIDENTi ,,
 What is to be especially mentioned is that the members of the People's
 Liberation Army stationed in Sinkiang also took part in the production drive.
 During 1950, they reclaimed 850,000 mou of wasteland, harvested 2j0,000 pdculs
 of grain, and planted vegetables enough to supply them for the entire year.
 Further, the army built 32 small canals having a total length of 1,300,000 meters,
 which are capable of irrigating 1,277,000 mou of land.
 For the purpose of reducing the burdens of the people of Sinkiang and
 boosting their enthusiasm to produce, methods of farming used in the interior
 of China were introduced, which raised their knowledge of agricultural techniques
 and gave the Sinkiang people great benefits.
 In Sinkiang, animal husbandry is still second to agriculture.    t'ter
 the establishment of the provincial people's government, steps were taken to
 establish veterinary hospitals and epizoot'c disease-prevention stations, and
 mobile medical teams were organized to ino,;ula+.e and treat animals.   According
 to incomplete data, 418,109 animals were treated for noninfectious diseases,
 317,678 for infectious diseases, and 98,190 were give  preventive inoculations.
 4.   Cultural Activities
 Basic and effective work was done in establishing newspapers, bookstores,
 broadcasting stations, and movie theaters for the purposes of promoting the poli-
 tical consciousness of the people.  In Sinkiang newspapers are now being printed
 in the Chinese, Mongolian, Uighur, and Kazakh languages and being circulated to
 the masses.  Ea'h day at I-li, Chuguchak, A-shan, K'o-shih, So-ch'e, Khotan, and
 A-k'o-su, the newspapers and the radio stations transmit new- and scientific
 knowledge to the peopl-.   In addition, radio monitoring stations have been esta-
 blished at Su-lo, A-k'o-su, Khotan, So-ch'e, Karashahr, and Ha-mi.
 With respect to the work of translation, over 30 different works of
 Chairman Mao (totaling o   -? 40,000 words and 15 different works of Vice-Chairman
 Liu Shao-ch'i totaling ov,? 1,010,000 words) have been translated into t::e Kazakh
 language.   Naturally, this has great iupnrtance in introducing and spreading the
 ideas of Mao Tse-tung and the experiences of the Chinese people in their Revolution
 to the people of Sinkiang.  Further, the branch offices of the Hsin-hua Bookstore
 at Y,'o-shih, Ha-mi, T-li, Chuguchak, So-ch'e, and Khotan have published 71 dif-
 ferent kinds of books, totaling 305,400 copies, concerning government policies,
 documents, and theories, in the Chinese, Uighur, and Kazakh languages.   Under the
 guidance of the Culture and Education Committee, theater grcups of the Uighur and
 Kazakh peoples have also been organized.   They have given performances in Sian

 Accomplishments and Defects
 The above accomplishments were made largely through the correct leadership
 or Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, the Northwest China Military
 and Administrative Committee, the assistance given by the People's Liberation Army
 in Sinkiang,the warm support of the people of Sinkiang, and the efforts of the
 government workers in Sinkiang.  However, the work in Sinkiang is not without
 defects and these defects are largely due to the fact tb"t Sinkiang has been only
 recently liberated, that the people there are many and complex, that there are
 difficuitiea of language, that the territory of Sinkiang is vast and the condi-
 tions there complex, that there is a lack of available government cadres, and
 those who are there lack the experience for carrying out such heavy responsibil-
 ities and solving the complex problems.
 The first defect is the lack of complete understanding of the conditions
 and the characteristics of Sinktzng, resulting in the lack of complete coordi-
 ration between the varior'. 'ranches of the government.   In certain cases, the
 government was more or lee.; passive, and many things were left undone.   Second-
 ly, there was the lack of periodic investigation and examination by the various
 bureaus and departments of the work of lower echelons, and the lack of assist-
 ance and guidance which should have been given by those bureaus and departments
 to the lower echelons, resulting in a somewhat unbalanced progress of work.
 Thirdly, there was a la?k of training of government cadres by the various depart-
 ments, resulting in the lack of a sufficient number of capable government work-
 ers.
 Although the groundwork has been laid in 1950, there is still much work left
 to be done in filling in the details and in strengthening the foundation.
 Aims and Tasks 1951

 4.  Strengthen and `=prove the political work of all branches and all levels
 of the government; permit regional autonomy among the various nationalities; and
 strengthen the people's democratic political power.  To accomplish such tasks,
 it is necessary that all circles and all nationalities people's representatives
 conferences continue to be convened to establish the system of people's democracy
 in the rural art as; it is further necessary to reform the political power of the
 hsiang governments and to begin democratic construction in the nomadic stock-
 farming areas, double the efforts in the training of political workers, purge
 undesirable elements, raise the efficiency of work of all branches and all strata
 of the governmer t, and improve the operation of the judicial ' partment and the
 system of its periodic examination.
 5.  Sinkiang is the rear guard of the -ional defense structure of the
 People's Republic of China; therefore, we m,,,,c make the people of Sinkiang under-
 stand clearly that national construction and national defense are the mc.t
 important tasks confronting the nation.   To carry out such tasks it is necessary
 that we strive to increase production and to establish and develop state-ownerl
 industries; establish a system of economic and financial unification and centra-
 lization; stabilize commodity prices; facilitate rural-urban commerce; strive for
 a balanced budget by reducing expenditures and raising government income; and
 eliminate corruption by prohibiting all manner of waste and extravagance in con.
 tradiction to adopted policier and methods.
 In agriculture, we must strive to increase the output of foodstuffs,
 cotton, and hemp by utilizing all beneficial conditions and by boosting the en-
 thusiasm of the people to produce.   In addition, subsidiary occupations must be
 established at important and strategic centers.  The goals for production in-
 creases are as follows:
 Foodstuffs-  The amount of arable land must be enlarged to 16,374,112
 mou, and the output should be increased 10.41 percent over that of 1950.   Cotton;
 The area for cotton growing must be enlarged to 863,194 mou.  Hemp:  We must
 strive for the production of 2.? million catties of hemp.   Oil-producing crops:
 The plan..ed area must be increased to 928,068 mou, striving for the productio?
 of 123,470,115 catties of oil.  To accomplish the above goals, it is necessary to
 strengthen the leadership of production, and to improve the methods of larming.
 Mobilize the people for the construction of irrigation projects.  With
 the exception of such large irrigation projects as the reservoir at Hung-yien
 Ts'eh near Urumchi and the dikes at Ho-ping, Ha-mi, Karashahr, and A-k'o-s,.
 which are to be built by the army, other small irrigation projects should be
 constructed by the people.   In addition, adequate measures should be taken to
 insure the proper use and distribution of water.
 Forestry;  The chief aim is the ;,rotection of forests, and afforestation
 is, at the present stage, secondary and complementary to this;   in addition,
 plans should be made to insure the proper and appropriate use of lumber.  When
 the opportunity presents itself, a campaign of afforestation must be launched
 a campaign to plant 7,423,600 trees and 100 hectares of state-sponsored forests,
 and to turn 720 mou of wasteland into arable land.  This is of great importance
 to Sinkiang, where much of the land is very barren.  With respect tome use of
 l,rmber, 95,000 cubic meters of lumber must be cut for construction purposer.
 Animal Husitandry:  The number of horses must be increased 2 percent over
 that of 1950, cattle 4 percent, and sheep 6 percent.  In addition, enlargement
 must be made of the present an'mal farms, veterinary hospitals for the purpose
 of improving the stock and pre  nting an.  :uring of epizootic diseases.  Emphasis
 is placed on the prevention of diseases; treatment of diseases is secondary.

 to implement the policy of reduction of land rentals and to lessen  the feudal
 exploitation of the rural areas, thus making rudimentary improvement in the peo-
 ple's standard of living and laying the groundwork for the implementation of land
 reform.     To achieve these objectives, it is necessary that the various branches
 of the government take steps to train the cad-es needed for carrying on the work,

 To carry out the above eight points satisfactorily, it is necessary to
 mobilize all government cadres to study the orders and directives of the Central
 People's Government, of the Northwest China Military and Adminstrative Committee,
 .and of the Provincial People's Government of Sinkiang in order to form c;:rrect
 convictions, to carry out the work entrusted to them, and to lead the people.
 Furthermore, it is necessary to give sound leadership to the lower echelons by
 periodic checkups and by constant discussions and criticisms of experiences.
 Those who have made outstanding accomplishments should be given proper recogni-
 tion and encouragement while those who disobey the rules and regulations of the
 government should be given education, criticism, or even punishment.  Finally,
 it is necessary to adopt the system of periodic report by the workers to elimi-
 nate all disorderly and anarchic conditions, thus enabling our work to progress
 systematically and smoothly.
