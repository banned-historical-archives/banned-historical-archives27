U.S.S. Pueblo 
Believed Taken 
Into Red Port 
Communists Also 
Seen Stepping Up 
Attacks in South 
By BERNARD G1VERTZMAN 
Stvr Stall Writer 
A U.S. Navy intelligence ship 
with 83 men aboard was cap-
tured by North Korean patrol 
boats today amid signs of step-
ped-up Communist military ac4 
tivity in South Korea. 
The Navy ship apparently Was 
taken to a North Vietnam port., 
The Defense Department said 
the USS Pueblo, a 179-foot "in-, 
telligence collection auxiliary 
ship" carrying two 50 caliber 
machine guns, was surrounded 
by four North Korean patrol 
boats and boarded by an armed' 
party while MIG aircraft flew 
overhead. 
The incident took place short-
ly before midnight last night. 
EST (about 2 p.m. Tuesday, 
Korean time) about 25 miles off 
the North Korean coast, the 
Pentagon said. This would have. 
placed the Pueblo in interna.,' 
tional�or open�waters. 
The Pueblo radioed that it, 
was being forced to proceed to 
the North Korean port of Won-
san, and it was presumed that. 
It was being held there. 
The Pueblo radioed that it did; 
not fire its weapons. There were 
unconfirmed reports, however, 
that there were some wounded.. 
aboard. 
"Utmost Gravity" 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk; 
coed 'Azure on international', 
waters "a matter of utmost 
gravity." 
Rush said the United States1 
was hallowing up through avail-
able diplomatic channels to so-
cure the immediate release ofr 
the ship end the crew. 
First word from North Korear 
on that incident was a broad-
cast from Pyongyang Radio 
claiming that North Korea had; 
captured "an armed spy boat oil 
the U.S. imperialist aggressor; 
force which intruded way into 
the territorial waters of the re-i 
public and was carrying ou0 
hostile activities." 
Coincidental with the capture 
.of the Pueblo Radio Pyongyang, 
also broadcast claims that' 
"armed guerrilla units" had at-, 
tacked sentry posts of the U.S. 
2nd Infantry in South Korea., 
There was no immediate con-
firmation here, but there were 
reports from Seoul of sporodic' 
,raids in the northern part of 
South Korea. 
Moscow's Aid Asked 
State Department sources said 
the Soviet Union has been asked 
to convey a U.S. demand for . 
the immediate release of the', 
ship and crew. 
It is also expected that the 
Military Armistice Conunis-
sion which is set up to super-
vise the 1953 Korean armistice 
will be called to discuss not,

only the ship incident but also 
the rash of Communist military 
activity in South Korea. 
The Message 
Many details on the capture. 
are lacking. but according to the 
Defense Department announce-
ment, this is what happened: 
At approximately 10 p.m. EST 
yesterday a North Korean pa-
trol boat approached the Pueblo 
about 25 miles off the North Ko-
rean coast. 
Using international flag sig-
nals, the North Korean boat ask-
ed the Pueblo to identify its na-
tionality. The Pueblo identified 
itself as a U.S. ship. 
Continuing to use flag signals, 
the patrol boat said "Heave to, 
or I will open fire on you." 
The Pueblo replied: "I am in 
International waters." 
'The patrol boat circled the 
Pueblo. 
About an hour later, three 
additional patrol craft appear-
ed. 
One of them ordered: "Follow 
In My wake; I have a pilot 
aboard." 
The four ships closed in on the! 
Pueblo, taking different posi-I 
lions on her bow, beam and I 
quarter. 
Red Planes Overhead 
Two MIG aircraft were also 
sighted by the Pueblo's crew 
circling off the starboard bow. 
One of the patrol craft began 
backing toward the bow of the 
Pueblo with fenders rigged. An 
armed boarding party was 
standing on the bow. 
The Pueblo radioed at 11:45 
pen. EST that she was being 
boarded by North Koreans, the 
Defense Department said. 
At 12:10 a.m. EST today the 
Pueblo reported that she had 
been requested to follow the 
North Korean ship into Wonsan 
and that she had not used any 
weapons. 
The final message from the 
Pueblo was sent at 12:32 a.m. 
It reported that it had come to 
"all stop" and that it was "go-
ing off the air." 
The Pueblo had reported that 
the hoarding took place at 127 
degrees, 54.3 minutes east longi-
tude; 39 degrees, 25 minutes 
north latitude. 
The Ship 
The Pueblo has a complement 
of 83 men, including six officers, 
75 enlisted men and two civil-
ians. 
It is designated as the AGR-2 
and is described as a modified 
light cargo ship (AEI). The Pu-
eblo is 179 feet long and 33 feet 
wide with a displacement of 906 
tons. It has a 10.2 foot draft. Its 
maximum speed is 12.2 knots. 
Nebraskan Is Skipper 
The skipper of the Pueblo was 
Identified by the Pentagon as 
Commander Lloyd Mark Bucher 
of Lincoln, Neb. - 
Navy sources said the term 
"auxiliary" used in the ship's 
identification serves to indicate 
that it is an auxiliary to the fleet 
and not a combat ship. 
It is said to have various elec-
tronic and oceanographic equip�
ment aboard, presumably allow-J 
ing it to monitor radio traffic as! 
well as to take soundings on the � 
possible presence of submarines . 
and other ships in the area. e 
The incident�the gravest sea 
confrontation since the Gulf of ! 
Tonkin attacks in August l564�
is the latest in a series of prov-
ocations from North Korea over! 
the past year. 
Just a day before, a band of 
North Koreans sneaked into 
Seoul and apparently tried to 
storm the Blue House, the home' 
of the South Korean chief of 
state, but were detected and, 
driven off in a gun battle. i 
There is no solid information 
on why the North Koreans have 
decided to increase the tempo 
of their activity after years of 
generally quiet adherence to 
the 1953 armistice. 
North Korean leader Kim 11. 
Song, however, has constantly 
'called for broad international. 
support for North Vietnam, and 
it could be that this is a diver-
sionary effort to try and weaken 
the U.S. effort in Vietnam. 
The North Koreans are pre-
sumably embarrassed by the , 
fact that South Korea has  
con-
tributed two divisions to the al-
lied effort in Vietnam while they 
have done nothing even compar-
able. The North Koreans are 
said to have trained some North 
Vietnamese pilots and supplied 
some aircraft. 
Memories of June 8 
In a way, today's incident 
brought memories of another 
crisis, when another U.S. ship, 
the Liberty, was attacked by; 
Israeli planes and torpedo boats* 
in the Mediterranean last June 8 
�during the Arab-Israeli war�
and 34 Americans were killed 
and over 100 others injured. 
The White House "hot line" 
Is Moscow was used during 
that crisis'. 
The Liberty, a communica-
lions ship, was 15 miles north 
of the Sinai Peninsula, the Pen-, 
tagon said, when the attack: 
took place. 
Israel later offered to make 
amends for the "tragic inci-I 
dent." in which the Israelis , 
claimed no flag was being flown 
by the vessel. 
The Defense Department 
shortly after the incident said 
that the U.S. could not accept 
an "attack upon a clearly. 
marked noncombatant U.S. 
naval ship in inteenationd 
waters as 'plausible' under an, 
circumstances 111111%0611*."

A U.S. naval task force led by tile nuclear carrier 
Enterprise was ordered toward North Korean waters 
early yesterday after four Communist gunboats captured 
an American intelligence ship and its 83 crewmen. 
The North Korean boats forced the intelligence ship, 
the USS Pueblo,( into the port city of Wonsan after the 
American vessel was captured and boarded by Com-
munist crewmen. 
Capture of the Pueblo took place under a cover of 
Mig fighter planes in international waters 16 nautici...I 
miles off the North Korean coast, accordi;:g to the De-
fense Department. The North Koreans claimed the ship 
.wash within its 12-mile territorial limit. 
In the aftermath of the spisode the United States in-
formed South Korea last night that it had decided to take 
"certain initial measures" in response to the seizure of 
the Pueblo. Ambassador William J. Porter conveyed the 
word to South Korean Premier Chung 11Kwon in Scol.;i.

fall off North Korea's eastern 
coast near where the US'S 
;Pueblo was seized by the

The Defense Department's 
!deputy information chief, Dan-
iel 1. Henkin, reported lss 
!night that not until the actual 
boarding had begun�an hour 
and 45 minutes after the first 
'patrol boars appearance�did 
�the Pueblo's skipper radio foci

In the Defense 'DepartmeliC � 
� view, the .Puebbo's captain 
'acted entirely on his own in 
'electing to heave to and sur-
render witliPut a fight. At 
no time, Henkin said, did the 
skipper ask permission to scut-
tle his ship rather than sec it 
fail into North Korean hands. 
Ilenkin said the skipper, 
Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher, sent 
.two messages indicating that 
four crewmen were wounded, 
one critically. 
Although North Korea 
claims its territorial waters 
lextend outward 12 miles, the 
United States only recognizes 
a three-mile limit. The geo-
graphic coordinates released 
by the Pentagon indicate the 
Pueblo was approximately 15 
miles from the mouth of the 
Wonsan harbor when the 
North Korean patrol boats 
closed in on her. 
Reliable sources reported 
the Pueblo lay quiet with en-
gines off as first one, then 
three additional patrol boats 
!took up positions around her. 
With her sophisticated elec-
tronic and acoustic monitoring 
devices, the intelligence ship

LAI to Try Diplomacy First 
To Free Ship and Its Crew 
Sly Chalmers 
Wnicr 
President Johnson has avail-
able both diplomatic and mill-
tare Options in his efforts to 
secure the return of the Amer-
ican ship and its crew seized 
by North Korea. 
Admiuistratiou off icia Is 
stressed last night that he had 
made no decision on what step

These officials said last 
'night that whether there is a

:States and North Korea is 
,Wholly up to the Communists. 
A National Security Council 
meeting is scheduled for 1 
p.m. today at the White House 
at which there is expected to 
be an assessment of the diplo-
matic efforts to win release of 
the Pueblo. 
At a meeting of the Korean 
Mixed Armistice Commission 
lust night, Washington time, at 
Panmunjom on the line which 
divides North from South 
Korea, the United States de-
manded the return of the ship 
and crew. 
American Bear Admiral 
.7ohn V. Smith also demanded 
an apology from the North 
Koreans. He called seizure of 
the Pueblo "the most heinous 
crime" since the outbreak of 
the Korean War in 1950. 
Smith coupled the ship inci-
dent with the rising number 
of North Korean incursions 
into South Korea across the 
demilitarized zone and he 
:warned that if they continued 
, the responsibility for the 
.consequences would rest on 
:the North Koreans. 
; The United States also has 
'moved on the diplomatic front 
to free the ship by asking the 
Soviet Union to intervene. A 
message was given the Rus-
Sce EFFECTS, A6, Col. 1 
Sians in Moscow yesterday 
:alertly after the seizure of the 
vessel. 
Administration officials yes-
terday viewed the Pueblo inci-
dent, which caught Washing-
ton by total surprise, as the 
most serious in Korea since 
the armistice on July 27, 1953,� 
ended the bloody three-year 
war. 
The seizure was character-
ized as a "matter of utmost 
gravty" and the State Depart-. 
a..ent moved at once for a dip-
lomatic solution. The move-
ment of the naval force, 
headed by the nuclear-pow-
:d carrier Enterprise al-' 
:ro.idy was under way by that 
time. 
State Department officials 
terded to believe that the!

The Washington reading is,

rean Communists hope to; 
spark a guerrilla war in South I 
Korea which would lead to the! 
overthrow of the American-
supported government in I 
Seoul and to unification of the' 
country under Communist 
rule. 
Secretary of State Dean 
Besk told newsmen he consid-
ered the incident "a matter of 
utmost gravity." At the White 
House it was characterized as 
a "very serious Situation." 
Later, in a formal statement, 
the State Department said the 
� 
United States "views this ac-
lion by North Korea with 
utmost gravity.". 
'the Department said the 
United States at once had 
asked the Soviet Union, via 
tile American Embassy in 
Moscow, to help obtain release 
cf the ship and its crew. It 
was also announced that the 
aeizure would be brought up 
at a meeting of the Mixed Ar-
raistice Commission which had 
been due to meet at 9 o'clock 
last night on the earlier at-
1,impt by North Korean infil-
trators in the South Korean 
apital of Seoul to kill Presi-
cent Park Chung Hoe. 
At the United Nations, Am-
bassador Arthur J. Goldberg 
lied on C.N. Secretary Gen-
eral U Thant to express Amer-
ican concern. He said he did 
not then have sufficient ce-
tails to call for any U.N. ace 
rion. � 
ture of what occurred, espe-
cially the PentagOes failure to 
explain e. Pueblo had 
not called1tt- support from 
bases close by in South Korea, 
Japan and Okinawa, led many 
officials to withhold judgment. 
While Administration offi-
cials spoke of getting the ship 
and the men back as quickly 
as possible, there was no cer-
tainty that this would oecur. 
North Korea said that the 
"spy ship" had intruded Mho 
its territorial. seaters al:to-Jam, 
the United States said the! 
Pueblo was 25 miles off there.' 
The last case of Arneeicea 
servicemen beinq captured 
was in 1993 when two Arm, 
helicopter pilots were forced 
down north of the Korean di-
viding line. They were re-
leased a year later. 
While the United State's em-
phasized what it termed 'the 
seriousness" of "this feeerant. 
North Korean action en the 
high seas," North Korea man.-
iated what it called the Anwri-
can "imperialists" and their 
' armed ship." 
Pyongyang Radio, the offi-
cial voice of North Korea, yes-
terday boasted of guerrilla 
raids on American sentry posts 
along the. Demilitarized Zone 
which divides the two Koreas., 
The broadcast said the raids' 
took place "as the armed' 
struggle of revolutionary peo-
ple spreads everywhere in, 
South Korea." 
This has been the North Ko-
rean line for some time, claim-, 
ing that the United States was 
trying to suppress an uprising 
of South Koreans. A broadcast, 
on Jan. 10 charged that four, 
days earlier "many armed! 
boats, mingled with fibbing! 
boats, wider . ttiO escort of 
armed warships," had in-
truded into North Korean 
coastal waters. The broaddaest 
Claimed that "escort boat num-
ber 56" had been "cant to the 
bottom" in such an incident a 
year ago. 
Earlier broadcasts charges 
that American reconnaiszeree 
planes had flown over Norte 
Korea. American ground pro-
vocations also have been 
charged. 
On the other hand, a Gold-
berg report to the C.N. cmi 
Nov. 2 stated that as of that 
time in 1967 there had beet 
543 North Korean incidents in 
violation of the armistice as 
contrasted to 50 incidents in 
all of 1966. Goldberg reported 
that North Korean armed raid,

Hill Calls for Action 
To Recover Seized Ship 
Congress reacted ang,riiy. 
yesterday to North Korea's. 
capture of the American intel-
ligence ship, the USS Pueblo. 
There were calls for mili-
tary action to recover the ves-
sel and its 82-man crew from 
the city of Wonsan, where it; 
was forced into port. 
Sen. Richard B. Russell (D-
Ga.), Chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee,' 
called the seizure "almost an 
act of war." His House coun-
terpart, Rep. L. Mendel Rives 
(D-S.C.), said, "I hope the 
President will take all neces-
sary steps to restore this ship 
to our fleet." 
Some, including critics cf 
the Administration's policy in 
I Vietnam, suggested that the 
commitment there was 
'responsible for the North 
'Korean action. 
I Sen. J. William Pulbright 
'ID-Ark.), Chairman of the For-
eign Relations Committee who 
is quietly probing the 1964 
:confrontation in the Tonkin 
'Gulf, and Sen. Stuart Syming,-
:ton (D-Mo.) said the American 
.commitment in Vietnam has 
allowed other countries to 
move against the U.S. with 
impunity. 
Sen. George D. Aiken (R-
Vt.) suggested that "North 
Korea is irritated because 
South Korea is supplying 40,-
000 troops to South Vietnam." 
One of the strongest reac-
tions came from Rep. Bob Wil-
son (R-Calif.), who demanded 
that the United States take 
military action "at once" to 
See REACT, A6, Col. 41 
recover the Pueblo and her 
crew. Wilson also raised three 
critical questions that were 
!echbed by a number of legisla-
Itors. 
' The three that "must he 
:answered were, he said: N1/4 hy; 
!wasn't air cover sent? Why 
.wasn't there "adequate mili-
tary protection" for the patrol-I 
ling Pueblo? Why wasn't the 
shin scuttled by Its captain 
and crew before it was 
boarded by the North Koreans 
"to prevent our secret intelli-
gence equipment from falling 
Into enemy hands?" 
Senate Majority Leader 
Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) 
called the seizure "a clear vio-
lation of international law" 
-and said he assumed the Gov-
ernment will.rnake "the neces-
sary proteSCand objections" 
through thelgoviet Union and 
'Japan, which have diplomatic 
-relations with North Korea. 
"This is typical, I think, of 
things we're going to have a 
lot more of," Symington said. 
"The South Koreans are just a 
few yards away (from North 
Korea) at the Demilitarized 
Zone. We've got several divi-
sions there. The North Ko-
reans are supplied by China, 
and I guess the Soviet Union.: 
Maybe it illustrates that when 
the cat's away the mice wiU 
play�after all, we're prettyl 
heavily engaged in Vietnam." 
Rep. William H. Bates (R-
Mass.), senior GOP member of 
the House Armed Services 
Committee, condemned the 
seizure as "a dastardly act of 
piracy," while Rep. Durward 
G. Hall (R-1110 said "these 
provocations" demanded an 
immediate and forceful re-
sponse. 
Although Russell agreed 
with Symington's contention 
that the United States was 
widely spread militarily 
around the world, he said the 
country was "capable of ful-
filling any of our commit-
ments we may have in Korea 
and at the same time maintain 
our posture in Vietnam". 
House GOP Leader Gerald 
R. Ford of Michigan said the 
North Korean should release 
the ship "forthwith." 
"If the vessel was cruising 
in international waters, as was - 
apparently the case, there is 
no justification whatever for 
--{ 
the action taken by the North' 
Koreans," he said. 
Rep. Spark M. Matsunagal

An official Navy picture of the I:SS Pueblo. Numbers (explained below) locate the vessel's special equipment. 
The USS Pueblo An Intelligence Ship 
The I:SS Pueblo, one of a large fleet 
of American intelligence-gathering 
ships, carries millions of dollars worth 
of secret electronic equipment Its elec-
tronic gear enables the crew to listen 
to land, sea ant, air communications 
within its surveillance range. 
Intercepted communications are re-
corded on tapes that go ultimately to 
Washington where experts try to fit 
them into a world-wide intelligence 
pattern. 
By capturing the Pueblo the North 
Koreans and other Communist powers 
may well learn about the latest Amer-
ican intelligence-ferreting techniques. 
The above photograph, released by 
the Pentagon, shows some of the in-
telligence equipment that will now be 
available for North Korean inspection: 
1�The twin antennae, called Yagis, 
showt where signals are coming from 
50 other equipment on the ship can 
focus on there. 
2�The long poles appear to support 
cables for transmitting messages to 
submerged submarines by means of 
low frequency radio waves that can 
penetrate the sea's surface to about 50 
feet. 
3�The radar equipment appears to 
be designed for bouncing signals off 
the troposphere. This gives the ship 
still another way to listen or transmit 
messages. This tropospheric communi-
cation technique has special advan-
tages for eavesdropping on airplanes 
and their ground controllers. 
4�There is a dome-Shaped antenna 
pointing skyward at this location, bare-
ly visible in the photograph. This prob-
ably is the chief means of communicat-
ing with airplanes and eavesdropping 
on their conversations. 
5�The Pentagon photograph shows 
a deck winch at this location. But this 
winch, left over from when the Pueblo 
acted as an auxiliary, probably has 
been removed to make room for elec-
tronic equipment such as the giant ear 
used on the USS Liberty, sunk by the 
Israelis during the Middle East war. 
6�This is the logicci ineaCon for 
tape recordinSlitipment that records 
communicatio44ntercepted by the 
Pueblo. The areelnight even be sealed 
off from the igat of the ship�as was 
the ease in the USS Liberty. 
7�Unless the Pueblo has had its 
hu.:1 modified mar underwater listening 
equipment, the ship trails a lone line 
of hy-drophones behind it as it moves 
through the water. The listening line 
is beneath the surface. dragged down 
by a planing device, and has weighted 
hydrophones hanging from it like a 
crabber's trot line. 
Each ship makes ailWinctive sound 
underwater, called its signature by 
ferret specialists. These signatures 
are fed into a computer by U.S. in-
telligence experts for ready compari-
son to signals recorded by ferret ships 
on station. 
If the Pueblo had such underwater 
detection equipment, and it. most 
likely did, it could listen to ships 
passing by for 50 miles around.

NAVAL CRISES RECALLED 
Freedom of Sem Touchy Issue 
T?...e North !Crean saizure of the Pueb'.3 has 
raLse:t a freedotr. of the seas issue which thru 
American history has meant crisis � sometimes 
to Lte paint of war. 
Vioiation oi the fight was a major factor in 
bringing on the War of 1312. A U.S. ship seizure 
aims: brought Eng:and to the point of coming on 
the aide of the Ccefedetacy during the Civil War. 
The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine was a 
.3.ecisive event in bringing on the Spanish-
American war. The submarine torpedoing of the 
Bri,i3i1 liner Lusitania helped sway American 
pubito opinion against the Germans prior to U.S. 
enLry into World War I. 
Historically, the War of 1912 demonstrated the 
sensitivity the American people have toward vio-
lations of freedom of the seas. The conflict was 
triggered by the Chesapeake affair. On June 22, 
the U.S. frigate Chesapeake en route from Nor-
Ina, Va., to the Mediterranean was stopped by 
tno 3ritiSh warship Leopard just outside Ameri-
can .erritarial waters with a demand that it sub-
a search for Royal Navy deserters. 
W.aen the Ohesapeak's master, James M. Bar-
n.; refused, Leopard opened fire, forcing the , 
kneriean frigats to submit. Foe* seamen � twog:

Union side, the 600-ton Harriet Lane, was rap-

after being damaged by Southern shore batteries 
off the coast of Florida. Even in this case, howev-
er, Harriet Lane was not captured at sea. 
The first recorded instance of the capture of ar. 
American warship was in 1800, when Barbary 
pirates operating to the Mediterranean off Tripoli 
succeeded in Overpowering the crew of the U. S. 
frigate Philadelphia. 
Historians said further research probably would 
show a few more captures in the War of 1812 and 
the Civil War, but no similar incident in the past 
Century.

U.S. on Diplomatic Tip-Toe 
The United States, confronted with the most 
perilous situation in Korea since the 1953 armi-
stice, was moving quietly but forcefully thru dip-
lomatic channels today to secure .the return of the 
USS Pueblo and her crew. 
Johnson administration officials said North Ko-
rea's seizure of the U. S. Navy intelligence vessel 
in international waters appeared to be one more 
"provocation" in a mounting series of communist 
actions aimed at eventually destroying the 
U. S.-backed government of South Korean Presi-
dent Park Chung Hee. 
MANEUVER 
They said the North Korean communists proba-
bly hoped that their action at sea, as well as their 
stepped up infiltration and terrorism in South Ko-
rea, also would help Hanoi by distracting Ameri-
can attention and resources. 
But the primary objective of the Pueblo hijack-
ing, in the view of officials here, was to press 
forward the campaign for the ultimate communi-
zation of the entire Korean peninsula. 
The Russians, whose aid the United States has 
sought in this affair, had no editorial comment on 
it. On the basis of Soviet actions during the past 
few years it was assumed the Kremlin wanted to 
hal a way to defuse the situation and divert the 
peril of a renewed Korean war without causing 
the North Korean communists to lose too much 
fazes in the proms. 
RENEWED WAR 
No official would go so far as to predict that 
the Pueblo incident, along with the attempted 
acAnksination of President Park and other ac-
tions, would lead to a resumption of hostilities in 
Korea. But such a possibility could not�be 
counted entirely. 
The official North Korean newspaper, Rodong 
Shinmoon, said Sunday that President Johnson's 
policies in Vietnam had created "a tense situa-
tion in which a war may break out at any mo-
ment ... in our country." 
On Jan. 9, about the time the Pueblo took up its 
station off Wonsan harbor, another North Korean 
newspaper, Minju Chosen, said the United States 
was sending armed vessels along the country's 
east coast. 
The North Koreans. in their broadcast an-
nouncement of the capture of a "spy ship" linked 
th3 affair directly to the mounting tension rising 
from a sharp increase in the number of military 
incilents between North and South in recent 
months. RR �

Distress Signal Late 
Spy Ships Role Foggy 
By MIKE MILLER 
Scripps.Howard Stet Write 
Mystery today shrouded the role and actions of 
the NaVy's USS Pueblo, hijacked Monday night 
by conununist North Korea on an intelligence 
mission off that country's coast. 
After hours of officially imposed silence, many 
of the sporadic Pentagon disclosures on the inci-
dent served to heighten the mystery rather than 
solve it. 
There were these questions: 
to' What exactly was the Pueblo doing in the 
Soa of Japan since it ,began its mission there Jan. , 
8? 
Describing theiiieras WClligence galfg'

under control of the Navy rather than any of the 
U.S. supersecret intelligence agencies. 
Po Why did the Pueblo hesitate so long before 
calling for help? 
The vessel was first confronted by a North 
Korean patrol boat at 10 p.m. Monday and told 
by radio to "Heave to or I will open fire on

was boarded an hour and 45 minutes later, after 
the one patrol boat had been joined by three 
others and two MIGs circling overhead.

The Pueblo Incident 
T H the Vietnam war blazing 
fiercely, the United States doesn't need 
any more entanglements, incidents or 
blunders, especially in Asia. But we 
suddenly have a first class problem 
with the USS Pueblo. The whole ship, 
intact, with 83-man crew, Was captured 
by North Korean gunboats without a 
shot fired. It sounds preposterous, but 
there it is. 
The important thing is to obtain re-
lease of ship and crew without touching 
off a new blaze. Despite some hawkish 
cries from Capitol Hill, let us try diplo-
macy, thru the Soviet Union and Japan, 
North Korea's neighbors, but we must 
insist on prompt return of the captured 
vessel. 
But how did it happen, and why? The 
why seems easier to answer: the com-
munist regime in Pyongyang, angered 
by the sizable contribution its South Ko-
rean rival is making in Smith Vietnam, 
has been stirring up trouble for months. 
The seizure of the Pueblo .CoMes just 
two days after the daring commando 
raid in Seoul aimed at-assassinating 
South Korean President Park Chung-
bee. And that abortive attempt capped 
more than a year of sharply stepped-up 
- . . 
infiltration and sabotage. It should be � 
no mystery to any American � includ-
ing U.S. Navy officers in the area � 
that North Korea is distinctly hostile 
territory. 
But was the Pueblo in North Korean 
waters and thus liable to attack or sei-
zure, as the communists claim? The 
Pentagon says no, the ship was well 
away from shore � at the time it was 
taken in tow, at least. 
Unfortunately, even in our own coun-
try there is not too much faith in the 
Pentagon's version of incidents like this 
one � considering the "cover" stories 
on major incidents over the years. 
In our judgment there was no wisdom 
or prudence in positioning an "intelli-
gence collection auxiliary ship" � slow 
(12 knots) and virtually unarmed (two 
.50-caliber machineguns) � close in off 
Wonsan harbor. 
Of course our Navy has the right to 
"freedom of the high seas." But the 
more pertinent question is; Is it smart 
for the Navy to steer such a ship, unpro-
tected, around in a known dangerous 
neighborhood? -Let's -stop leading with 
our chin, particularly 'when we don't 
have our dukes up.

Shipnaping Is Called WellinPlcnined

�Scripps-Howard Staff Writer 
Administration sources voiced fears today that 
North Korea's seizure of the USS Pueblo and 
recent "drastic increases" in communist attacks 
on South Korea may be linked to the Vietnam 
War. 
'They speculated that the growing boldness of 
North Korean Communists is aimed at: 
V Keeping U.S. and South Korean forces so 
occupied there that no more troops can be pulled 
out to fight in Vietnam, thus indirectly helping 
communist Viet Cong and North Vietnamese 
forces. (Fifty thousand South Korean troops al-
ready are fighting in Vietnam.) 
V Warning the U.S. that continued bombing of 
North Vietnam could bring intensified guerilla 
fighting in Korea and perhaps even another Viet-

Nations command in Korea to the United Nations 
Se:.-trity Domicil which showed that "significant 
toot:lents" of North Korean infiltration into South 
NaTer., by both land and sea, had increased from 
only 53 in 1966 to 543 last year.

ed that the number of North Koreans killed in 
such fighting increased from 43 in 1966 to 224 in 
1987, while the number' of U.S. and South Korean 
troops killed jumped from 35 in 1966 to 122 in 
1967. 
Four South Korean civilians were killed by in-
filtrators in 1956 but 22 were killed in 1967, the 
report said.-
VIOLATION 
The report was transmitted 4o the security 
Council by U.S. Ambassador Arthur Goldberg, 
who charged that the "recent sharp increase in 
the scope and intensity of the North Korean mili-
tary attacks and other armed activity in Korea 
was in violation of the Military Armistice Agree-
ment signed July 27, 1953.' 
The report said North Korean "armed raiders" 
ranging from small groups of six or nine men up 
to a group of about 60 have attacked "in carefully 
planned and reconnoitered operations" and also 
have concealed "numerous mines" and used 
high-explosive charges to demolish buildings. 
Nearly all the Infiltrators were captured, killed 
or dispersed, the report said.

It is believed the Pueblo's Capture was careful-

"intelligence gathering" ship had been engaged 
in electronic eavesdropping off the North Korean 
coast for two weeks. The State Department insist-
ed the ship was operating in international waters. 
Military intelligence sources here said the 
planned nature of the North Korean capture of 
the Pueblo was borne out by the presence of four 
Red gunboats which encircled the ship while two 
communist mig fighter jets circled low overhead. 
It was believed this display of superior North 
Korean firepower made the Pueblo reluctant to 
attempt a shoot-out with the enemy, altho several 
crewmen reportedly were wounded by gunfire. 
The Pueblo was armed only with two 50-caliber 
machine guns. 
But no Washington official would offer an ex-
planation of why no American help was forthcom-
ing from U.S. naval or air facilities within range 
of the Pueblo. 
Capture of the intelligence vessel by the com-
munists was regarded as a major coup, since the 
ship was equipped with quantities of highly so-

U. S. Mounts Show of Strength 
Reds Vow to Keep Pueb 
PANMUNJON, Korea, Jan. 24 (UPI) � In a truce 
use confrontation, the United States today de-
manded North Korea return the hijacked USS 
Pueblo and its 133 men but the communist regime 
said it will keep the intelligence ship. 
The ship will remain in our hands," Maj. Gen. 
� Pak Chung Kuk of North Korea told U.S. Rear 
Adm. John V. Smith at a face-to-face meeting of 
the Korean Armistice Truce Commission. Gen. 
Pak also said several Americans were "killed 
and wounded" in yesterday's ship capture. 
� t Admiral Smith accused North Korea of launch-
ing a "campaign of provocation, sabotage and 
assassination." He said, "if the North Korean 
regime persists in this campaign, which can only 
endanger the peace of this area, the responsibili-
.4..y for the consequences will rest on the North 
.Korea regime." 
SHOW OF STRENGTH 
'The U. S. was mounting a naval show of 
strength in the waters off North Korea to back up 
its demand for the return. 
The nuclear powered aircraft carrier UM En-
terprise. world's largest warship, was reported to 
' have been diverted from Vietnam station to lead 
at American task force into the Sea of Japan. 
Gen. Pak and Admiral Smith met at this truce 
village on the Korean dividing line.' 
Gen. Pak charged the Pueblo was captured in 
North Korean waters at 39.17 degrees north 
lati-
mdc and 127.46 degrees east longitude. According 
' to the U.S. Navy; the ship was hijacked in the 
Japan Sea and forced into the North Korean port 
of Wonsan. 
RESISTANCE CITED 
Pyongyang 'Radio, the broadcasting voice of the 
North Korean capital, said the 83 American crew-
men put up "arrogant resistance" before the ves-
sel was boarded and seized. The broadcast said 
,several Americans were killed or wounded and 
more than 80 "captured alive." 
The.North Koreans accused the vessel of "in-
tolerable provocations" and said the Pueblo "ille-
gally. infiltrated (into North Korean waters) on an 
.espionage mission." They said the ship fired on 
the patrol boats and when the boats returned the 
the they "killed and wounded" several Ameri-
cans. 
The Navy said four American crewmen were 
injured, one critically, when the communist boats 
seized the Pueblo as two Mig Jet fighters circled 
cverhead. The hijacking was said by the Penta-
gon to have occurred on the high seas in interna-
tional waters, about 15 nautical miles from the 
North Korean coast. 
The Navy insisted last night that at no' point in 
the encounter did the Pueblo fire her two .50-
caliber machine guns.

The vessel made no mention of any gunfire. 
This did not preclude a hand-to-hand struggle

troy the secret electronic monitoring and commu-

By that time. the Navy said, it was too late te

"Time and the distance factors made it impos-

the ship was being boarded," a spokesman said. 
Adm. Smith demanded the North Korean apolo-

He said, "the events of last year, and especial-

A Challenge to Candor . . . 
The naval kidnaping of the USS Pueblo by four 
North Korean torpedo boats is almost too bizarre 
to be believed. We know that it was engaged in so-
phisticated electronic espionage, close to the North 
Korean coast, but in international waters, according 
to the United States account. But we don't know 
why it was unescorted, and under-armed, or why, 
even so, it did not even try to resist. Above all, we 
don't know why the North Koreans picked this 
moment for so provocative a piece of brigandage. 
Not knowing these things, the soundest course 
is probably not to leap to conclusions, especially 
when we also don't know what efforts are being 
made to extricate the vessel and its 83-man crew. 
The Administration is entitled to a decent interval 
even when the outward evidence points to bungling 
on a major scale. 
That much said, the Administration must realize 
that public tolerance in this country for the unex-
plained and the inexplicable is wearing thin, as 
is public patience with the growing evidence of a. 
rising challenge to our security interests through-
out the Asian world. A public which was lied to 
� over the U-2, confused, if nothing else, by the 
Tonkin Gulf, and misled, to say the least, in the 
affair of another intelligence ship attacked by the 
Israelis last year, cannot be satisfied or reassured 
by the same old coverups. 
This is all the more imperative, given the impact 
this incident is likely to have on nerves already 
frayed and positions already hardening. Those who 
see this country as over-extended in Asia, and 
around the world, will find further argument for 
withdrawal and retrenchment from confrontation 
with communism. Those who see in our policies 
of limited war a humiliation and a senseless in-
hibition will find further argument for a harder 
line and stiffer measures all across the board. 
Already there is evidence of these tendencies 
in reaction to the seizure of the Pueblo. While 
some Senators cried out against a virtual act of 
war, others claimed vindication of their view that 
we are over-extended in a world policeman's role. 
As Communist pressures continue to pile up in 
Vietnam along the highlands and across the Demili-
tarized Zone, in neighboring Laos, and in Thai-
land, a new Korean crisis can only operate to accen-
tuate the extremes. 
It is important to keep our cool until we know 
more. But this makes it no less important that we 
be told more�and more that is believable--about 
so bizarre and unbelievable an incident.

'Deliver an Ifitimatilm' 
Reaction 
To Seizure 
Is Divided 
The public and political 
opinion that surfaced in the 
country yesterday was badly 
divided over the response the 
United States should make to 
North Korea's seizure of the 
USS Pueblo. 
In the Senate, caution 
seemed the dominant theme. 
The Democratic Majority 
Leader, Mike Mansfield of 
Montana, declared: "We ought 
to keep our shirts on and not 
go off half-cocked." 
The chairman of the Senate 
Military Preparedness Sub-
committee, John Stennis (D.-
.Miss.), took essentially the 
same view. He urged the 
White House to "avoid precipi-
tous and rash over-reaction. 
Above all, we must not rush 
pell-mell towards the disaster 
of World War III." 
In the House and among 
some segments of the Ameri-
can press, the mood and the 
rhetoric were more militant. A 
New York Democrat, Rep. 
Samuel Stratton, said "we've 
got to get that ship back just 
as vigorously as President 
Kennedy got the missiles out 
of Cuba." House Republican 
Leader Gerald Ford of Mich-
igan said that if diplomacy 
fails "the United States must 
take whatever military action 
is necessary" to recover the 
ship. 
The chairman of the House; 
Armed Services Committee,' 
tough-talking L. Mendel Riv-
ers (D-S.C.), said the United 
States should declare war if 
necessary to get the Pueblo 
back. "I wouldn't fool with ; 
him," said Rivers. "I'd deliver 
an ultimatum. If they didn't 
give back the ship, I'd turn 
loose whatever we had out 
there on them." 
If an all-out war in Korea 
grew out of the Pueblo cap-
ture this country would have 
to consider using tactical nu-
clear weapons, Sen. Henry M. 
Jackson (D-Wash.) said in a 
television panel interview 
(WTTG) last night. 
A few newspapers accused 
the Administration of coward-
ice and, in effect, echoed Riv-
ers' call for an unlimited re-
sponse. "North Korea's bold 
seizure of the Pueblo," said 
the Milwaukee Sentinel, "is 
not nearly so outrageous as 
has been the American pusil-
lanimous reaction to it. Our 
official bird is not eagle, hawk 
or dove. It is chicken." 
Said the Chicago Tribune: 
"Given the spinelessness of 
success ive Administrations 
since the days of President 
Truman , in dealing with 
Korea, little, if any, effective 
action would seem in the mak-
ing. The United States will 
have suffered humiliation at 
the hands of a country it 
could squash like a bug." 
Advice to the Administra-
tion to withhold precipitate ac-
tion and to use first the chan-
nels of diplomacy was given 
by the Los Angeles Times, the 
Kansas City Star, the New 
York Times and most other 
major newspapers. 
Parents' Statements 
The most conciliatory state-
ments on the Pueblo incident 
came from parents of cap-
tured crewmen. "Let's keep 
cool." said Oliver Langenberg 
of St. Louis, whose 21-year-
old son Peter was aboard the 
ship. ' 
The wife of the Pueblo's 
commander, Mrs. Lloyd 
Bucher of San Diego, said her 
only recourse now is to "pray 
for his-safety." 
Blame for the incident was 
assigned to various targets. 
Sen. Wallace Bennett (R-Utah) 
viewed the ship's seizure as 
simply another step in "World 
War III, Communist style." 
But Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio) 
pointed a finger at the CIA. 
"Maybe CIA didn't run this," 
said Hays, "but I expect they 
did It's about as fumbling an 
operation as you would expect 
from them." The Milwaukee 
Journal questioned the Navy's 
judgment in sending out the 
ship without an escort. The 
Winston-Salem, N.C., Journal 
commented on the "impres-
sion that her skipper acted in-
gloriously by surrendering 
without a fight." 
Republican presidential can-
didate George Romney had no 
comment at all. "It would be 
silly," said Romney, "to make 
a comment on a situation as 
serious as that without having 
all the facts."

Seizure of Pueblo by Reds 
Stresses U.S. Self-Isolation 
LAST YEAR made it 
plain that guns in 'Vietnam 
could not be combined with 
butter at home. And this 
year is making it plain that 
the United States cannot 
have both guns in Vietnam 
and a detente with the rest 
of the Communist world. 
That is the bitter lesson of 
the seizure of the USS 
Pueblo by the North Ko-
reans. And the lesson is the 
more bitter because it is evi-
� dent that this country's tra-
ditional friends want no 
part of a new confrontation 
with the Communists. 
To be sure, the Pueblo af-
fair could be an isolated in-
cident conditioned by very 
special circumstances. More-
over, the North Koreans are 
Asian Communists, sensitive 
to Peking's pressure for a 
hard-line stand against the 
United States. 
BUT NORTH KOREA 
also has a common border 
with the Soviet Union. With 
respect to Vietnam, the 
North Koreans have sup-
ported Moscow against Pe-
king in coming out for 
united action on behalf of 
Hanoi. Thus it Is going to be 
very hard for the Russians 
� to back away from what the 
North Koreans have done. 
The more so as abundant 
signs indicate that a recent 
era of good feeling between 
Washington and Moscow 
had about reached the end 
of the line anyway. Not that 
Washington willed it that 
. way. On the contrary, hav-
ing just reached agreement

Defers Action 
On Tonkin 
By Robert C. Albright 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
The Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee yesterday 
postponed a decision on 
'whether to investigate devel-
opments leading up to the 
1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolu-
tion, after a 3-hour hush-hush 
meeting. 
Chairman J. William Ful-
bright (D-Ark.) described the 
proposed inquiry as a "very 
sensitive matter" in the light 
of Monday's incident involving 
North Korea's capture on the 
high seas off Korea of the 
U.S.S. intelligence ship Pueblo. 
Fulbright said another 
closed meeting will be called 
later to determine whether to, 
undertake a full-dress investi-
gation of the Tonkin Gulf inci-
dent, in the wake of a staff; 
son,Administration has been 
eager to go on to new arms 
control measures. 
But' the Vietnamese war 
keeps getting in the way. 
For example, minutes before 
Ambassador Anatoly F. Do-
brynin returned home for 
consultation ten days ago, 
Secretary of State Rusk was 
obliged to warn him that a 
recent air raid near Hanoi 
had scattered into the wa-
ters near the port delayed 
action bombs that might im-
peril Soviet ships. ' 
ON THE SOVIET side, 
there appear to be moderate 
officials keen to maintain 
working relations with this 
country. But the moderates 
seem to be on the defensive 
on a host of issues, includ-
ing economic reform and 
cultural liberalization as 
well as relations with Wash-
ington. 
According to one rumor, 
Prime Minister Alexi Ko-
sygin. thought to be the lead-
ing moderate figure in all 
matters, is on the point of 
resigning in frustration. An-
other story has it that one 
of the best known liberals in 
cultural matters, P. N. Demi-
they, will be demoted from 
a post on the party secre-
tariat to a ministerial job. 
By no mere accident, the 
backsliding of the Big Two 
toward confrontation finds 
most of this country's closest 
friends across the Atlantic 
looking the other way. The 
fact is that they are less and 
less interested in carrying 
the burden in the quarrels 
that now divide the United 
States and the Soviet Union. 
Gen. cle Gaulle. to cite the 
staked everything on disen-
gagement :from the United 
States in order to get on 
with Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union. He has his own 
reasons for that policy�and 
those.not of the best. But if 
he remains politically secure 
in France, and has a follow-
ing throughout Western Eu-
rope, it is in large measure 
because he is able to pose 
as the prophet of detente. 
BRITAIN seems now to be 
following along. Compelling 
economic needs have forced 
Prime Minister Harold Wil-
son to abandon the role of 
junior partner to the United 
States in backing up the se-
curity of nations between 
Singapore and Suez. And on 
his recent visit to Moscow he 
has been playing to the hill 
the part of the man who can 
get on with the Russians. 
Nor is anybody else in 
Western Europe, not even 
the West Germans who were 
once so keen on confronta-
tion, rallying to the cause. 
On the contrary, their most 
conspicuous stance � toward 
the United States is the 
flinty position they have 
taken on the balance of pay-
ments. And that is in large 
part a refusal to help pick 
up the tab for this country's 
efforts in Vietnam. 
What is happening, in 
short, is the self-isolation of 
the United States. Being in-
dignant about the Pueblo, 
justif iable as indignation 
may be, will not turn that 
tide of affairs. What is re-

N. Korea Cites 
'Confession 
Fabrication 
Is Charged 
By Pentagon 
From News Dispatches 
North Korea claimed yes-
terday the captain of the 
USS Pueblo had confessed 
that he was engaged in 
"criminal espionage activi-
ties" inside North Korean 
territorial waters when he 
was captured Tuesday. The 
United States termed this 
"a travesty on the facts." 
The alleged confession was 
.attributed to Cmdr. Lloyd 
Mark Bucher. The 38-year-old 
officer, his 83-man crew and 
their intelligence ship were 
taken into custody by North 
Korean patrol boats and 
brought to the port of Wonsan. 
The (North) Korean Central 
News Agency quoted Bucher 
as saying that he was carrying 
out an espionage mission 
against the Soviet Union and 
North Korea for which he and 
his crew had been offered "a 
lot of dollars" from the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency. 
Alleged Remarks 
"Having been captured now, 
I say frankly that our act was 
a criminal sot which flagrantly 
violated the armistice agree-
ment and it was a si...c,2r act of 
aggression," Bucher said, ac-
cording to the news agency. 
"I have no excuse whatso-
ever for my criminal act as 
my ship intruded deep into the 
territorial waters of the Demo-
cratic People's Republic of 
KOrea and was captured by 
the naval patrol crafts of the 
- Korean People's Army in their 
self-defense action while con-
ducting criminal espionage ac-
tivities," the Commander al-
legedly said. 
Called 'Fabrication' 
In Washington, the Pentagon 
promptly asserted that the ac-
count attributed to Bucher was 
a "fabrication." It added that 
"no credence should be given 
to this contrived statement." 
Assistant Secretary of De-
fense Phil G. Goulding, the 
Pentagon's chief spokesman, 
said the "style and wording"

the North Koreans "provide!

LBJ Strives 
To Avoid 
Use of Force 
� By Chalmers M. Roberts 
and Carroll Kilpatrick 
Washington Post Staff Writers 
The White House strong4 
ly indicated last night that 
diplomatic efforts to secure 
the return of the seized 
Navy ship Pueblo will be 
continued before any de-
cision is made to use ,mili-
tary force. 
At the end of a long day of 
top-level meetings, including 
an hour's session of the Na-
tional Security Council, Presi-
dential Press Secretary George 
Christian told newsmen that 
the subject is still open 
through diplomatic channels. 
We have not abandoned dip-
lomatic efforts toward settle-
ment of the matter." 
Christian characterized the 
diplomatic efforts as "still of 
paramount interest" but said 
he could give no details. 
Russians Refuse Aid 
I Christian spoke after Admin-
istration officials had disclosed 
that the Soviet Union, to which 
I the United Stales had quickly 
I appealed for aid in freeing the 
.Pueblo and its 83-man crew, 
had flatly refused to help. 
Another official said that 
"the response of the Soviet 
government has not been satis-
factory." He added that Wash-
ington had no evidence that 
Moscow had even transmitted 
its request to the North 
Korean capital of Pyongyang. 
Furthermore, North Korean 
Maj, Gen. Park Chung Kuk, 
the senior Communist repre-
sentative at the Mixed Armis-
tice Commission meeting at 
Panmunjom Tuesday night. 
Washington t i m e, ignored 
American demands for return 
of the Pueblo and its men. .. 
Negative Remarks 
A report from the American 
Embassy in Seoul to the State 
Department did not say that 
Gen. Park had rejected, in so 
many words, the demand. It 
did say -that the whole tenor 
of his remarks was negative 
and Administration officials 
took them to be a rejection. 
Thus just what the Presi-
dent will now decide to do, if 
further diplomatic efforts also 
prove fruitless, was a closely 
kept secret There were indi-
cations that a second effort to� 
enlist Russian aid would be. 
made before any decision on. 
whether to use force. 
Christian said yesterday 
morning that "the Govern-
ment, of course, is organized 
and planning, under the Presi-
dent's directive, to deal with 
the matter." He added that no 
ironclad decisions had than 
� been reached. 
But he and all other of-
ficials, including Secretary of 
See PUEBLO, Al2, Col. 5 
ip's Return; 
State Dean Rusk, Who spoke a day earlier. Yesterday when '1-seiL7-ed in collaboration with 
with newsmen at the Capitol, 
flatly refused to tek about 
future action. 
Meanwhile, an American 
naval task force built around 
the nuclear-powered aircraft 
carrier Enterprise was on 
station in the middle of the 
Sea of Japan about 150 miles 
east of Wonsan, where the 
Pueblo has been taken. There 
was no word of what addition-
al military dispositions may 
have been made but officials 
said that other movements 
had been ordered. 
There were "no plans at 
present" for a presidential ad-
dress to the Nation on this. 
serious crisis which had hit 
official Washington with thun-
derbolt force and aroused 
anger in Congress. . 
' Nor was there any sign of 
possible action at the United 
Nations. Ambassador Arthur 
J. Goldberg met for 30 minutes 
with Secretary General U 
Thant to give him "all avail-
able current information." But 
Thant, who himself had no 
comment On the Pueblo inci-
dent, reported through a 
spokesman that Goldberg had 
"not yet" requested him to 
step in. 
North Korea is not a U.N. 
member. Its Communist gov-
ernment has been totally hos-
tile to the world organization, 
and North Korea is still under 
a U.N. condemnation for the 
invasion of South Korea more 
than 17 years ago. 
� Rusk yesterday escalated his 
own characterization of the 
North Korean capture of the 
Pueblo, which he had termed 
"a matter of utmost gravity" 
asked if he agreed with a Sena-
tor's characterization of the 
seizure as an act of war, Rusk 
replied: 
"It is a very harsh act. I 
would not object to character-
izing it as an act of war in 
terms of categories in which 
such acts can be construed." ' 
Rusk declared that "my' 
strong advice to North Korea] 
is to cool it There have been 
enough of these incidents and 
they have come out of North 
Korea," a reference to the 
mounting attacks on South 
Korea by small bands and by 
infiltrators. 
"North Korea would be well 
advised to pull back here, 
stop this kind of activity, and 
decide to live in peace with 
its neighbors," he said. 
Rusk also said that "we 
would like to see the Russians 
give us some help in this." 
By the time he was saying 
this, however, other officials 
were reporting the Soviet 
turndown. At the White House 
it also was said that the efforts 
through the Russians "have 
not had satisfactory results." 
Asked whether he saw a 
link between the North Ko-
rean action and the Commu-
nists in the Vietnam war, 
Rusk replied that he felt there 
was "no organic. connection." 
He added that "it is possible 
North Korea tried to put on 
the pressure but it will not 
have the slightest effect.' 
Government specialists ap-
pear to be unanimous ih view-
ing the North Korean infiltra-
tion of the South and the seiz-
urse of the .Pueblo as strictly 
their own doing. They reject 
any notion that the ship was 
North Vietnam or with Corn-. 
munist China or the Soviet 
Union, 
The North Koreans, how-
ever, have been embarrassed,' 
to give much help to Northl 
it is felt here, by their Inabil-
ityVietnam whereas South Ko-i 
rean troops are major and ac-
tive American and South Viet-; 
namese allies There have loeen 
reports of North Korean pilots! 
in North Vietnam but no pub-
lie confirmation that they have' 
seen action. 
Washington experts on Ko-
rean and Communist affairs 
generally assume that Soviet 
intelligence experts will fine-
toothcomb the Pueblo to learn 
what they can of the most se-
cret equipment. Thus there 
was some feeling here that af-
ter this is done Moscow might 
be more amenable to asking 
the North Koreans to release 
the ship and crew. 
There is, of course, no guar-
antee that North Korea would 
take such Soviet advice, if 
offered. The Pyongyang gov-
ernment some months ago 
took a public stand of equal 
independence from both Mos-
cow and Peking. 
Reports of the Mixed Ar-, 
mistice Commission session' 
showed that the North Korean' 
general heaped charge after 
charge on the United States. 
Yesterday Pyongyang put out 
what it called a confession by 
the Pueblo's captain of his 
alleged guilt. 
Christian termed the North 
Korean charges "both cynical 
and a distortion of fact." Statel 
Department spokesman Rob-
ert J. McCloskey said the 
!charges were "cynical, denun-
ciatory of the United States 
'and a distortion of fact." 
North Korean Gen. Park 
charged that the Pueblo had 
.engaged in a "vicious act of 
I hostility" inside territorial 
waters and not outside as the 
United States claims. He also 
'charged that the Pueblo was 
trying to "come closer to the 
land to perpetrate provocative 
acts" when North Korean 
navy vessels "returned fire."

Seizure Seen 
I Linked to Purge 
LONDON, Jan. 24 (UN)�
The seizure of the USS Pueblo 
is part of a hard-line North 
Korean strategy that has 
emerged after a major gov-
ernment and party purge, au-
thoritative sources said today. 
The shake-up has also led to 
the systematic acceleration of 
:the campaign of subversion 
and infiltration in South Ko-
rea, the sources said. 
The purge was believed to 
have been brought about part-
ly by internal differences and 
partly by desire to help the 
North Vietnamese Communists 
by distracting the United 
States. 
A new cabinet was appar-
ently formcd last month in 
Pyongyang after Pak Kum-
chol, vice president of the 
Presidium, Vice Premier Ko 
Hyok and two senior members, 
of the Communist Party were, 
purged, the sources said. 
Earlier, a number of senior 
army officers were reportedly 
put on the Party's political 
committee, strengthening the 
military's policy-making role.

'ETS, Monday. Defence offi-
!dials said the Pueblo's skipper, 
Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher, 
'did not can for help until the 
'North Koreans started to 
'board his ship at 11:45 p.m. 
The Pentagon did not dis-
close the nature of the call for 
help nor to whom it was sent. 
But Defense officials said the 
message was received and un-
derstood. 
From 11:45 p.m. Monday 
until the Pueblo reached Won-
san 26.1 nautical miles from 
its position, the question was 
how to rescue her. 
Since the Pueblo has a max-
imum speed of 12.2 knots, mil-
itary commanders had at least 
two hours to intercede while 
the North Korean patrol boats 
forced the American ship to-
ward Wonsan harbor. 
T.J.S. airplanes in the area, 
even if they could have 
reached the ship while she 
was still in international wa-
ters, would have had difficulty 
strafing or bombing the patrol 
boats without hitting the 
Pueblo as well. 
Apparently there were no 
U.S. warships close by to in. 
tervene. 
This apparent state of I.J.S. 
helplessness came through in 
an official Pentagon statement 
that said: "Time and distance 
factors made it impossible to 
respond to the call that was 
made when the ship was being 
boarded." 
The key military decision 
then�according to the Penta-
gon time sequence�was made. 
by the Pueblo's skipper. 
Defense officials said they 
did receive a message from 
the, skipper that he had 
started destroying 'the secret 
intelligence equipment on the 
Pueblo. 
The ship stayed in radio 
communication with Navy 
shore stations even after the 
North Koreans boarded her. 
Possibly the Koreans took 
some time to ctit off all the 
Pueblo's radio communication 
gear�some of which could 
have been sealed off in secret 
compartments. 
While boarding started at 
11:45 p.m. Monday, the Pueblo 
did not go off the air until 
12:32 am. Tuesday. 
Defense officials said last 
night that Secretary Robert S. 
McNamara was notified about 
the Pueblo capture at 12:23 
a.m. Tuesday.

President's Options Were 
Limited in Pueblo's Seizure 
m."Rhberts 
Wastentton Post Staff Writer 
President Johnson's op-
tions in the Pueblo affair 
were constricted by two crit-
ical decisions made down 
the chain of command be-
fore the Chief Executive 
had even heard of the inci-
dent. 
What is now known of the 
record goes to demonstrate 
once again how much a 
Commander - in � Chief is 
bemmed in by the actions of 
his subordinates. 
These were the decisions 
Involved: 
News Analysis 
1. The President was not 
told of the North Korean 
torpedo boat approach to 
the Pueblo or of its board-
ing until 2 a.m. Tuesday, 
Washington time, after the 
'ship and its 8.3-man creW 
were securely in North Ko-
rean hands. By that time he 
was faced with an accom-
plished fact�the first hi-
jacking of an American 
naval vessel by a foreign 
state in more than a century 
and a half. 
to the incident with a show 
of force. That decision was 
made down the line, appar-
ently by CINCPAC, the 
joint command headquarters 
in Honolulu. Whether the 
Pentagon was even asked its 
advice is not yet clear. But 
certainly the President was 
not asked. 
It may well be, of course, 
that Mr. Johnson, if he had 
been given the option, at 
once would have ordered 
the Enterprise and its naval 
train to head for North Ko-
rean waters. On the other 
hand he might have decided 
-2. The nuclear-powered 
carrier Enterprise and its 
accompanying vessels, which 
by chance had Just left Sas-
ebo, Japan, to return to duty 
off Vietnam, were turned 
about and headed toward 
the Sea of Japan opposite 
North Korea, again before 
Mr. Johnson was awakened. 
The President once more 
was faced with a fact�that 
American ships were head-
ing toward North Korea in a 
show of force. 
In the first instance, oth-
ers made the fateful deci-
sion not to send aircraft to 
that to do so would be to ov-
erheat the already charged 
atmosphere and possibly 
limit diplomatic efforts to 
win release of ship and 
crew. 
If further diplomatic ef-
forts fail and with the naval 
force off North Korea, Mr. 
Johnson has the option now 
of using force in some form 
or of withdrawing the ships 
In the face of North Korean 
refusal to free the Pueblo. 
The Pueblo case is not the 
first instance in which a 
President has found himself 
--
help the Pueblo, whether or 
not the captain had called 
for aid. Someone decided, 
without reference to the 
White House and apparently 
(although this is not yet cer-
tain) without reference to 
the Pentagon, to let the 
Pueblo's captain handle the 
torpedo boat problem. 
That proved to be an irre-
trievable mistake that se-
verely limited the Presi-
dent's ability to respond. 
In the second instance, 
the President had no option 
open on whether to respond 
bound by what his subordi 
nates have done. 
President Eisenhower was 
boxed in by the mishandling 
of an inept cover story in 
the 1.1-2 affair. President 
Kennedy, to some degree, 
was trapped in the Bay of 
Pigs debacle, something he 
did not let recur in the 
Cuban missile crisis. And 
President Johnson reacted, 
or, in the view of some 
over-reacted, to what he was 
told by the American ambas. 
sador in .Santo Domingo in 
the Dominican intervention.

North Korea's capture of a U.S.

Calls for Hard Line 
Mounting in Senate 
Over Ship Seizure 
By the Associated Press 
New and harsher calls for tough U.S. action�including use 
of air and seapower if necessary�followed initial diplomatic fail-
ures to retrieve the captured ship Pueblo from her North Korean 
captors. 
Two senators said yesterday the United States might be 
forced to Ise tactical nuclear weapons if the Pueblo incident 
touches Off a war with North 
Korea. 
And at least one senator who 
has strongly opposed U.S. war 
policy in Vietnam, Sen. Frank 
Church, called seizure of the 
Pueblo and the 83 Americans 
aboard "an act of war." 
The Idaho Democrat said "the 
ship must be returned at once, 
with all American aboard. Our 
national honor is at stake here." 
Senate Democratic Leader 
Mike Mansfield and Chairman J. 
W. Fulbright, 1)-Ark., of the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Commit-
tee, counseled a cautious U.S. 
response to the incident. 
Mansfield said the United 
States shouldn't "go off half-
cocked," miltiarily. 
The warnings of possible nu-
clear intervention if the incident 
explodes into war were sounded 
by two members of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, 
Sens., Henry M. Jackson, 1)- 
Wash., and Strom Thurmond, 
pying most of its available 
ground forces, said of North Ko-
rea: "If they make an all-out 
attack on South Korea, some 
kind of use will have to be made 
of tactical nuclear weapons." 
Thurmond agreed with that 
assessment. adding: "We will 
use any weapons if necessary to 
protect America and her peo-
ple." 
Their comments came on a 
Metromedia television inter-
view. 
Sen. William B. Spong Jr., 
D-Va., urged Johnson to "take 
all necessary steps to secure the 
immediate return of the ship, its 
equipment and the members of 
the ship, its equipment and the 
members of its crew." 
Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., 
chairman of the Preparedness 
subcommittee, said the United 
States must "take al lsteps" in-
cluding the use of force, if nec-
R-S.C. essary, to bring about the 
Jackson, contending the U.S. prompt release of the Pueblo 
commitment in Vietnam is occu- nd her crew. 
Concern Over Pueblo 
Voiced in Soviet Press 
By EDMUND STEVENS 
Special to The Star 
MOSCOW � Although Soviet 
diplomacy has so far declined 
the American request to act as a 
go-between in seeking the re-
lease of the USS Pueblo from 
North Korea, the Soviet press 
reflects mounting concern here 
lest the incident kindle another 
conflagration. 
Moscoe natur ally accepts 
unquestioningly the assertion of 
its North Korean ally that the 
Pueblo was captured in North 
Korean territorial waters. 
Pravda's Washington corre-
spondent, Boris Strelnikov, ca-
bled his paper by way of confir-
mation that no less an authority 
than Sen. J. William Fullbright, 
D-Ark., admitted that this time 
the United States was caught 
red handed and that the Pueblo 
was indeed engaged in espio-
nage. 
Adds Strelnikov: "Sensible 
Americans do not believe the 
Pentagon version that the Pueb-
lo was seized in international 
waters." 
To the Russians the Pueblo 
readily invites comparison with 
the U2 incident when the U.S. 
spy plane piloted by Gary Pow-
ers was shot down over Sver-
dlovsk thousands of miles inside 
the U.S.S.R. 
Romney Calls Ship Seizure 
Bid to Influence Viet War 
NASHUA, N.H. (AP) � Mich- and at a French-American club 
in Manchester, Romney declined 
last night to say how he thinks 
the United States should handle 
North Korea's seizure of the 
American ship Pueblo. 
He said he does not have the 
facts that are available to Presi-
dent Johnson and his advisers. 
"I think it would be folly to 
make a decision on something 
you don't have all the facts on," 
Romney said. 
He said there seems to be 
some question as to exactly 
where the American ship was 
when it was captured. 
"The hard facts are you can't 
believe your own government 
anymore in this country," he 
said later. 
(In Los Angeles, Gov, Ronald 
Reagan urged President John-
son to send warships into Won-
san harbor to free the Pueblo if 
North Korea does not release the 
ship within 24 hours, United 
Press International reported. 
("I cannot for the life of me 
understand why someone in the 
United States government, par-
ticularly the President, has not 
said, that ship had better come 
out of that harbor in 24 hours or 
we are coming in after it," Rea-
gan said. He called seizure of 
the Pueblo "the most disgrace-
ful thing to happen, in my mem-
ory, to America.")

er stories" floated by U.S. 
spokesmen before ex-Premier 
Nikita S. Khrushchev revealed 
the truth. 
Almost as if anticipating the 
Pueblo incident, the Soviet press 
recently reprinted an article 
from the Italian weekly "Epo-
ca" describing the sophisticated 
electronic worldwide espionage 
masterminded by the National 
Security Agency and the part 
played by intelligence gathering 
ships. 
The seizure of the Pueblo coin-
cided somewhat with the arrival 
in Moscow yesterday of a North 
Korean delegation headed by the 
deputy chief of state. 
Conceivably the Pueblo inci-
dent and the attempt by North 
Korean infiltrators to kill South 
Korean President Chung Bee 
Park could be designed to warn 
the United States that continued 
escalation in Vietnam could lead 
to retaliatory action elsewhere 
in Asia. 
But most observers here agree 
Moscow neither programs nor 
anticipates a major crisis in Ko-
rea. Otherwise, it's unlikely Pre-
mier Alexei N. Kosygin would 
have departed for New Delhi. 
Soviet propaganda has had a 
field day playing up the U.S. 
incursion into Cambodia and the 
B52 crash in Greenland with its 
nuclear bomb load as examples 
of aggressive brinkmanship by 
the U.S. military and proof of 
the Soviet contention that Amer-
ican policy is the main threat to 
world peace. 
Meanwhile, t h e rumblings 
from Korea virtually drowned 
out the peace-loving beeps gen-
erated by British Prime Minis-
ter Harold Wilson's Moscow 
talks. 
The British press spokesman 
sought to encourage optimism 
while the talks were going on by 
liberal use of such adjectives as 
"frank, friendly and construc-
tive" while disclosing nothing of 
substance. 
The joint communique, how-
ever, said little. The main indi-
cation that on Vietnam the gap 
had been narrowed, as Wilson 
claimed, was the affirmation 
that both sides supported the 
principles of the Geneva agree-
ments and would work jointly 
and separately for a just politi-
cal solution. 
Unlike the communique after 
Wilson's visit last year, it includ-
ed no expression of regret at 
failure to reach agreement on 
Vietnam.

THE LADDER OF ESCALATION  
Johnson Takes an Option 
By ORE KELLY 
Star Staff Writer 
President Johnson today took 
the first of a wide range of 
steps vailable in his ttempt to 
get back the USS Pueblo and its 
83-man crew when he an-
nounced the call-up of some Air 
Force reservists. 
In the last few years, both 
civilians like Dr. Herman Kahn, 
the author of a number of stud-
ies of escalation, and military 
leaders like Gen. Maxwell Tay-
lor, who developed the policy of 
"flexible response," have writ-
ten volumes on the options the 
President has in reacting to al-
most any emergency. 
These studies, now thoroughly 
incorporated into the Pentagon's 
basic military strategy, are un-
doubtedly being relied upon as 
the President, his civilian 
advisers and the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff try to devise a method 
for getting the ship and crew 
back with the least possible 
difficulty. 
?a Kahn's studies, the seizure 
of a ship in international waters 
ranks very high up the scale of 
military escalation. But the situ-
ation would obviously be vastly 
more grave if the seizure had 
been undertaken by the Soviet 
Union rather than one of the 
smallest nations in the Commu-
nist bloc. 
Before today's announcement 
and the further hint that some 
ground forces may be called to 
active duty, the U.S. already 
climbed a significant number of 
rungs up the ladder of escala-
tion. It moved both diplo-
maitcally�with apparently un-
successful attempts to enlist the 
aid of the Soviet Union�and 
militarily, with the dispatch of 
a nuclear task force headed by 
the carrier U.S.S. Enterprise to 
the Sea of Japan. This force is 
,reported now about 200 miles 
:off the Korean coast. This is 
short range for the ship's jet 
Pueblo. A coastal radar station 
might be shelled, for example. 
Extremely unlikely in these 
early steps would be any effort 
to send Navy or Marine ufflts 
into the port of Wonsan to takc 
back the ship by force r:Te� escalation ladder before they be-
cially while the North Koreans 
have the Pueblo's crew mem-
bers as hostages. 
Under the theory of escalation, 
these steps should be taken 
quite rapidly, with a pause after 
each step to see if the North 
Koreans are ready to give the 
ship Lack. 
In tt.eory, the North Koreans 
should be made to believe that 
the U.S. is prepared to use all 
necessary force to get the ship 
back�even eventual use of nu-
clear weapons. If they really be-
lieve 'his, the theory goes, they 
will accede to the U.S. demands 
at a low point on the escalation 
ladder rather than at a high 
point. 
One of the most awkward diffi-
culties facing Johnson and his 
advisers is that the North Ko-
reans might not believe the U.S. 
is willing to risk war over one 
little boat�and it might re-
quire a number of steps up the

aircraft, but far enough out to 
give the ships great flexibility. 
If diplomatic efforts fail en-
tirely � and it is not yet clear 
that they are going to fail � the 
theory of escalation would call 
for the application of military 
pressure in small increments. 
One such might simply be a 
show of force�positioning the 
Enterprise visibly in interna-
tional waters if the port of Won-
san, for example. 
Another might be an action 
matched to that of the North 
Koreans�perhaps the seizure of 
one of their boats. This kind of 
action could not be matched ex-
actly to the North Korean action 
because their navy dosen't have 
any ships as large as the Pueblo 
--an illustration of the difficul-
ties a "superpower" has in deal-
ing with a very small nation. 
� Slightly higher up the scale 
might be the destruction of some 
piece of North Korean property 
of the approximate value of the 
127 30.

come "believers." 
Johnson's options and those of 
military commanders in the 
field were severely limited at 
the very beginning of the Pueblo 
incident because no one appar-
ently realized in time that the 
harrassment of the Pueblo by 
North Korean patrol boats � 
something that happens fre-
quently in many parts of the 
world � would suddenly turn 
into a seizure. 
Whether or not someone in the 
military chain of command 
could have gotten effective help 
to Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher, 
skipper of the Pueblo, after he 
saw that he was about to be 
boarded and called for help has 
not been answered. � 
But Pentagon officials who de-
clined to be quoted by name said 
that even if properly armed 
fighter planes had been close 
enough to have gone to the aid of 
the Pueblo, a number of other 
factors would have been consid-
ered. These include weather, the 
amount of remaining daylight, 
the position of the ship at the 
time help arrived, and, especial-
ly, potential enemy reaction. 
The decision not to go to the 
aid of the Pueblo was made 
somewhere in the military chain 
of command short of Washing-
ton, these Pentagon officials 
said. 
But they did not say how high 
up the chain that decision was 
made. 
The incident began abgut 10 
p.m. Washington time Monday. 
Pentagon officials said Bucher 
did not request help until 11:45 
p.m. when the North Koreans 
moved to board the Pueblo. 
Thus, by the time President 
Johnson, Secretary of State 
!Dean Rusk and Defense Secre-
tary Robert S. McNamara were 
awakened between 12:23 and 2 
a.m. Tuesday, the Pueblo was 
, already in North Korean hands.

that diplomatic efforts to secure 
release of the Navy intelligence 
ship and its crew will be dis-
continued, Christian said: "This 
is only one action in this whole 
matter. Diplomatic efforts are 
continuing and we certainly 
hope they bear some fruit." 
He said the air reservists are 
being called to active duty im-
mediately under congressional 
authority provided in the 1967 
Defense Department Appropria-
tions Act. 
This act provides that "until 
June 30, 1968, a president may, 
when he deems it necessary, or-
der to active duty any unit of 
the ready reserve of an armed 
force for a period not to exceed 
24 months.' 
Cliffort's Hint 
The White House announce-
ment came just minutes afer 
Clark M. Clifford, Johnson's 
choice as the new defense sec-
retary, said on Capitol Hill that 
reserves could be called up if 
there is a worsening of the sit-
uation in the Far East or if 
"developments" in the Pueblo 
incident. 
Testifying at a Senate hearing 
on his nomination, Clifford made 
that comment in reply to a 
question from Sen. Margaret 
Chase Smith, R-Maine. He said 
the circumstances of the USS 
Pueblo's seizure "are exceed-
ingly grave." 
A call-up "could come about 
as a result of developments in 
the Far East; as a result of de-
velopments involved in the 
Pueblo�any stage this coun-
try's safety and security war-
rents, the President could well 
call up the reserves," he testi-
fied. However, he said he was 
not at liberty to say whether 
any specific decisions had been 
made. 
The White House said today 
that the President conferred at 
breakfast with Secretary of 
State Dean Rusk, McNamara, 
U.N. Ambassador Arthur J. 
Goldberg, special assistant Walt 
W. Rostow and press aides 
George Christian and Tom John-
son. 
U.N. Move Possible 
There were strong hints that 
Goldberg's presence may indi-
cate some possible diplomatic 
move through the United Na-
tion's. Tom Johnson said the 
President and Goldberg "ex-
changed views as they always 
du in situations like this. They 
will be in touch again during the 
day." 
Last night, the President con-
ferred with the same men � 
except Goldberg. Clifford was 
on hand. 
Johnson's mood is said to be 
one of "determination" not to let 
the Pueblo and its crew remain 
in Korean hands as the result of 
what he regards as a clear viola-
tion of international law. But he 
is equally determined to exhaust 
non-military means first to se-
cure their release. 
The nuclear-powered aircraft 
carrier, the USS Enterprise, and 
other warships and planes are 
now in position about 200 miles 
off the Korean coast, ready to 
move in if necessary: 
But Johnson, after hearing 
the advice of his top diplo-
matic, military and securi-
ty officers, has apparently cho-
sen to give North Korea more 
time to release the 83-man crew 
and the U.S. Navy intelligence 
ship � seized around midnight 
EST Monday night off the North 
Korean coast by four Commu-
nist patrol boats. 
The call-up, however, obvious-
ly adds to the pressure on North 
Korea. 
The administration feels that 
the main goal of the United 
States should be the safe return 
of the crew. Military action 
probably would not achieve this 
end, so diplomatic efforts will be 
pursued until it is decided that 
there is no hope of getting the 
men back � or if the U.S. na-
tional interest makes it impera-
tive to strike back at North Ko-
rea. 
New Ineident Would Do It 
The "national interest" would 
become involved if a second in-
cident occurred at sea, or some 
other obviously provocative ac-
tion were taken by North Korea. 
Part of the reason for the will-
ingness to give the Communist 
regime in Pyongyang more time 
is a belief in some administra-
tion circles that North Korea 
may have meant to signal the 
United States yesterday that the 
crew would shortly be released. 
The signal was detected in the 
last two paragraphs of a lengthy 
"confession" allegedly made by 
Commander Lloyd Mark Buch-
er, skipper of the Pueblo, and 
given wide circulation by North 
Korean radio. 
Most of the document�
clumsily written and more than 
likely composed by the Commu-
nist captors�was a listing of the 
"hostile acts" by the Pueblo. 
But what caught analysts' eyes 
here were the concluding words: 
"I and my crew have perpe-
trated a grave criminal act, but 
our parents and wives and chil-
dren at home are anxiously 
waiting for us to return home 
safe. 
"Therefore, we only hope, and 
it is the greatest desire of my-
self and all my crew, that we 
will be forgiven leniently by the 
government of the Democratic 
People's Republic of (North) Ko-
rea." 
A Signal? 
Communists � and particu-
larly Asian ones�put great im-
portance on confessions. Gener-
ally, if a person has confessed 
fully he is treated leniently. The 
wording of Bucher's "confes-
sion" gives rise to hopes that 
North Korea was sending a sig-
nal that the crew would be re-
leased soon. 
Most likely, the Koreans would 
want to study the intricate intel-
ligence devices aboard the 
179-foot vessel. Thus the men�if 
not released by themselves 
first�might have to wait until 
Communist intelligence officers 
had taken what they wanted 
from the ship. 
But there was nothing in 
Washington yesterday received 
through official channels to give 
rise to much hope. 
The Russians responded coldly 
to a U.S. "urgent request" that 
they. use their "good offices" to 
secure the release of the ship 
and men. 
Russian Blamed U.S. 
State Department sources said 
that Ambassador Llewellyn E. 
Thompson had a very uncom-
fortable time with First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vasily Kuzne-
tsov on Tuesday. Kuznetsov ap-
parently took North Korea's side 
and blamed the U.S. for the 
Pueblo incident. 
He gave no sign he would send 
on the U.S. request to the North 
Koreans. 
And the confrontation on Tues-
day night at Panmunjom be-
tween U.S. and North Korean 
members of the 15-year old Mili-
tary Armistice Commission end-
ed up, as expected, in mutual 
recriminations. The Communists 
claimed that the ship was in 
their territorial waters. The U.S. 
side insisted there can be no 
question but the ship was 25 
miles away fro mNorth Korea 
and obviously in International 
waters. 
Locations Given 
Position reports given out by 
the Defense Department indi-
cate the North Korean patrol 
boats that captured the Pueblo 
approached from the east, ap-
parently to intercept it. 
The department said the Pueb-
lo's position as indicated by the 
North Koreans' radar track was 
39:25 North and 127:56 East. 
The Pueblo's position at the 
time of the appearance of the 
first North Korean patrol boat 
about 10 p.m. EST Monday was 
given as 39:25 North, 127:55 
East. 
At 11:45 p.m., when the Pueblo 
reported she was being boarded, 
the U.S. ship gave her position 
as 39:25 North, 127:54.3 East. 
The Pentagon has pinpointed 
these positions as about 25 miles 
east of the North Korean coast. 
North Korea, however gave an 
"encounter" location of 39.17 
north and 127.46 east�much 
closer to land. 
The negative responses the 
diplomatic probing were expect-
ed, and many diplomats here 
believe that once things quiet 
down the Russians will use some 
"quite diplomacy" and try to get 
the release of the Pueblo. 
Thus word is expected to go 
out to Moscow to try again with 
the Russians. Meanwhile Gold-
berg has been keeping U.N. 
Secretary General U Thant 
posted on developments. 
Officially the United Nations is 
still in charge of military opera-
tions in South Korea�a carryov-
er from the Korean war when 16 
countries joined in a U.N. Com-
mand to fight against the com-
bined North Korean-Red Chinese 
fcrces. The U.S. forces in Korea 
wear,also a U.N. bat. 
North Korea is an implacable 
enemy of the United Nations and 
each year Communist nations 
try to get the United Nations 
disengaged from Korea, but they 
have consistently failed. Thus 
it is not anticipated that Gold-
berg will ask the United Nations 
to do anything formally. 
Russia would immediately 
veto any proposal for action�
thus making tensions in the area 
more strained.

� 
Korea and Vietnam 
President Johnson's call-up of 14,787 Air Force 
and Navy Air reservists yesterday is quite obviously 
aimed at demonstrating this country's resolve and 
increasing its capabilities in its confrontation with 
North Korea over the hijacking of the USS Pueblo 
earlier this week. The tactic is a familiar one, 
used by President Kennedy in the Cuban missile 
crisis, and earlier in a showdown over Berlin. 
But another, perhaps better analogy comes quick-
ly to mind � President Johnson's use of the 
Tonkin Gulf incident in August, 1964, as an op-
portunity to seek a sweeping congressional man-
date for his Vietnam policy. Now the Pueblo affair 
has given the Administration a comparable justi-
fication for tapping the military reserves on a 
scale which would have been difficult to justify 
solely in terms of the highly controversial conflict 
in Vietnam. 
It does not matter whether this element loomed 
large or small in the President's mind, just as it 
doesn't matter whether the Korean provocation can 
be proven to be part of a carefully orchestrated 
Communist campaign to strain our resources. Pur-
pose aside, that is the plain effect; the simple fact. 
amply demonstrated over the last few days, is that 
our available military resources are spread 'thin, 
so much so that it appears that appropriate air 
action to rescue the Pueblo before it was captured 
was apparently not available. So the President had 
no choice but to do what he has tried so long to 
avoid a politically unpopular call-up of the re-
serves. 
Now that it's done, there might be something to 
be said for dropping the other shoe. We have been 
comforting ourselves for many months with the 
thought that we can have it all�the war in Viet-
nam, the war against poverty, the butter and the 
guns. It is time, if not well past time, for the 
Nation to be told that just possibly we cannot 
have it all, that we may have to review and re-
order our priorities, that the capacity of our 
enemies to expand our Asian involvement, at 
marginal risk to themselves, is very large. 
All eyes are on the Pueblo and its 83-man crew, 
as Congress rings with cries for retribution by 
whatever' means. But the Vietnam war's largest 
single buildup of enemy combat forces in one con-
centrated battle area now encircles some 5000 
Marines in the remote base at Khesanh in the 
northwest corner of the South. A resulting 
Marine buildup has drawn large numbers of troops 
away from pacification work against Vietcong guer-
rillas in other parts of the country. 
Meanwhile, Hanoi is feinting towards Thailand 
and threatening to upset the shaky stand-off in 
Laos. These last moves may be feints, and nothing 
more. The capture of the Pueblo may be sheer 
coincidence�or the result of some informal work-
ing arrangement between North Korea and North 
Vietnam with coaching from Moscow. or Peking. 
Whatever the case, the pressure from the enemy 
seems to be getting more intense. Our best hope of 
countering this pressure while avoiding a wider 
war almost certainly lies in a demonstration of our 
willingness to wage a wider war if we must. This 
calls, in turn, for striking a delicate balance and ' 
the President has wisely kept his counsel while lie 
decides on countermoves. But he cannot count on 
the show of public willingness he will ultimately 
need unless he is willing himself to confront the 
public in more forthright fashion with the stark 
realities.

Reds Say Crewmen 
Must Be Punished; 
Diplomatic 
By Chalmers M. Roberts .. 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
North Korea said early 
today that the crewmen of 
ithe USS Pueblo "must be 
;punished" and warned that 
it is "fully prepared to cope 
' with . . . any surprise at-
tack" in retaliation for the 
Pueblo seizure. 
The statement did not say 
whether North Korea planned: 
to put the men on trial oI 
was demanding their punish-
ment by American authorities 
as a condition of their release. 
The statement by Rodong 
Shinmoon, the organ of the 
North Korean Communist 
Party, was monitored in Tokyo 
several hours after Secretary 
of State Dean Rusk told a 
New York audience that the 
only satisfactory solution to 
the Pueblo crisis is "immedi-
ate" release of the ship and 
crew. 
Earlier yesterday the United 
States turned to the United 
Nations Security Council in an 
effort to solve the crisis short 
of force. President Johnson 
instructed Ambassador Arthur. 
!J. Goldberg to ask for an 
; "urgent session" of the Se-, 
curity Council. It may be held' 
today. 
Call for Punishment 
The North Korean state-, 
ment, as reported by Associ-1 
ated Press, called its seizure, 
of the Pueblo on Jan. 23 a 
"proper self-defense measure" 
and warned if there is a repe-
tition of "provocations" it will 
"sternly punish., the aggres-
sors." 
Then it said: 
'The criminals who en-
croach upon others' sovereign-
ty and comniit provocative 
acts must' receive deserving! 
punishment. 
"These criminals must be 
punished by law." 
Referring to what it called 1 
'the clamor of the Johnson! 
clique who are attempting to; 
threaten someone with a ridic-' 
ulous talk about a 'retaliatory! 
measure,'" the paper said: 
"If the U.S. imperialist ag-
gressors think they can: 
:tighten our people with. 
threat or blackmail, it is really 
a stupid illusion." 
It said the Korean people 
"are fully prepared to cope 
with any provocation or sur-
prise attack of the enemy and 
are completely ready to deal 
a hundred-fold, thousand-fold,

retaliation to it, if it pounces 
upon us." 
The paper said the Pueblo's 
captain had confessed that the 
ship intruded deep into North 
�Korean waters. It said this was 
"an arrogant hostile act" by 
the United States and "a de-
liberate, premeditated provo-
cation for stepping . up their 
policy of war ignition ir 
Korea." � 
Secretary Rusk's staternelt 
In his New York speech last 
night was the moot precise

Pueblo's Orders

� The standing instructions for the USS Pueblo were 
:to avoid an international incident by moving out of the 
area if harassed rather than use her guns, it was learned 
yesterday. 
The ship's three .50-caliber machine guns were to be 
kept under canvas unless the survival of the ship de-
  pended on them. 
These rules for ferret, or 
spy, ships like the Pueblo may 
explain why her skipper, 
Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher, wait-
ed until it was too late to resist 
the North Korean boarding 
Monday night. 
Reliable sources said last 
night that North Koreans 
boarded the Pueblo without 
one shot being fired by the 
kmericans. The injuries to

�;earned authoritatively, came

. the basis of facts on hand so 
!far. Top officers regard Bu-
cher's decisions as consistent 
with his instructions to avoid 
trouble. 
Mrs. Rose Bucher, wife of 
the Pueblo skipper, said in an 
j interview last night that Adm. 
'Thomas H. Moorer, Chief of 
Naval Operations, had ex-

her husband's decisions .in a

Navy officers reason that

actions. Even after the North 
Koreans forced their way 
aboard at gunpoint, Bucher 
could have reasoned this was 
a temporary tweaking of the 
United States, rattier than a 
plan to capture the ship. 
There are no sea cocks on 
the Pueblo that could have 
been opened to let enough 
water into the hull to sink the 
ship. And sources said such 
ships do not ordinarily carry 
explosives other than the small 
ones needed to destroy spy 
equipment and codes. 
This would seem to rule out 
any chance of Bucher scut-
tling his ship. And if he did so, 
the lives of his 82 crewmen 
could have been lost�either; 
through freezing in the cold' 
water where the Pueblo lay or 
from the North Koreans open-
ing fire on them. � 
Bucher's only chance, then,. 
seemed to be help from other' 
U.S. ships or planes. This did 
not arrive from the time Bu-
cher sent out his call about 
midnight Monday (EST) until 
the undisclosed time�at least 
two hours later � when the 
Pueblo was taken into the 
North Korean port of Wonsan. 
It was also learned ynster 
day that the Pueblo lay dead 
in the water with water col-
lection bottles strung over the 
side when first accosted by the 
North Koreans. The, water 
samples were part of the 
Pueblo's oceanographic re-
search. 
Richard Halloran, Washing-
ton Post correspondent in 
Seoul, said sources there 
claimed the Pueblo's crew was 
taken off the ship shortly after, 
capture. The Pueblo's officers,! 
he said, then were flown to. 
Pyongyang but the enlisted, 
men presumably were kept in 
Wonsan. 
The Pueblo's capture had all 
the earmarks of a long-planned' 
operation, Halloran wrote. 
The North Korean Defense: 
Minister reportedly flew to 
�Wonsan to inspect the ferret 
,ship. 
: The fate of Bucher was still 
not known here last night. 
North Korea's radio sent out a 
. broadcast of Bucher's alleged 
confession. 
i The voice, alleged to be Bu-
cher's, said "I and my crew 
have perpetrated such a grave 
criminal act, but our parents 
and wives and children at 
home are anxiously waiting for 
us to return in safety. 
"Therefore," the broadcast 
.continued, "we only hope, and 
.it is the greatest desire of my-
'self and all soy crew, that we 
'will be forgiven leniently by 
the government of the Demo-
cratic Peoples Republic of 
Korea." 
In San Diego, Bucher's wife 
said after hearing a recording 
of the broadcast: 'That is not 
my husband's voice. It does not 
sound in any remote way like 
my husband. The inflections 
and sound were not his."

Just what military role the

The men called up were told 
to report to their units by 
midnight Friday. They were 
not told in their orders where

mented yesterday, can be kept

years.

1 The last time reservists were

All told, there are 372 
planes attached to the reserve 
units. Two hundred of them 
are F-100s, a supersonic jet 
that can carry a 'big load of 
bombs and rockets. 
The rest of the reserve fleet 
activated consists of 72 Navy 
A-9 and F-8 fighters; 46 trans-
ports, mostly C-124s, and 54 
RF-101 reconnaissance planes. 
There are 672 pilots among 
the 9340 Air Force National 
Guardsmen, 4847 Air Force re-
servists and 600 Navy air re-
servists called up from the 
District of Columbia and 16 
states. 
The White House said it : 
still hoped for a diplomatic, 
rather than a military, solu-
tion to the Pueblo crisis. But 
White House Press Secretary 
George Christian did not rule 
out a call-up of ground forces. 
"When and if decisions are 
made on a callup of Army and 
Marine Corps reservists," 
Christian said, "appropriate 
announcements will be made 
promptly." 
Goulding said the military 
chiefs and McNamara had rec-
ommended the call-up to the 
President. He would not say 
when the recommendation was 
made but said the decision on 
it came yesterday morning. 
The President's activation of 
reservists amidst the .Vietnam 
war undercuts the Administra-
tion's steady insistence that 
U.S. forces are not overex-
tended in the world. 
McNamara long has pointed 
to the Vietnam war as a model 
of Pentagon manpower man-
agement since it has been 
fought without calling reserv-
ists. 
Military leaders have com-
plained that his policy pro-
�vides little leeway for han-
dling unforeseen military 
emergencies. They warned 
they would have to turn to the 
reserves to handle them. 
Most members of Congress 
who would comment on the 
call-up approved the show of 
strength, but some feared it 
would lead to a larger war. 
Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Richard 
B. Russell (D-Ga.) called it "a 
natural sequence in the course 
of world events." Rep. L. Men-
del Rivers (D-S.C.) termed it at 
wise move. 
.7-Api 04, 
HoR,,JiA)1 ?PrPER_ 
; 
� 
In Boston, Sen. Eugene J. 
McCarthy (D-Minn.) said the 
callup was "a very disturbing 
action" because it disrupted 
family and business lives. He 
said he would like more in-
formation on the Pueblo seiz-
ure; including "where the ship 
was and where it had been." 
Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-
Wash.) said: "The President is 
making every effort to convey 
to the world�particularly the 
Communist World�the ser-
iousness of this situation. He 
is exhausting all alternatives 
short of using force." 
Senate Majority Leader 
Mike Mansfield (Mont.) said 
the action "underlines the ser-
iousness of the situation that 
now confronts us" and indi-
cates a possibility of the wid-
ening of the difficulties that 
confront us in the Far East." 
Sen. Ernest Gruening (1)-A-
laska), a leading war critic, 
called it an "alarming indica-
tion" of a bigger war. 
While most reaction cen-
tered on the Pueblo incident, 
the call-up could ease some of 
the strains of the Vietnam 
war. All through the war, 
American airplanes coming off 
the production line have 
barely kept pace with those 
lost in the field. 
This heavy demand for air-
craft in Vietnam left little for 
deployment to handle emer-
gencies in South Korea. 
The supply of aircraft may 
have figured in the military 
decision not to try to rescue 
the Pueblo Tuesday when the 
ship was being forced into the 
North Korean port of Wonsan 
by four North Korean patrol 
boats.

Text of Johnson's Statement on Crisis 
Text of President Johnson's message 
to flee American people on the Pueblo 
crisis: 
My fellow Americans: 
Over the past 15 months; the North 
Koreans have pursued a stepped-up 
campaign of violence against South 
Korean and American troops in the 
area of the dimilitarized zone. 
Armed raider teams in large num-
bers have been sent into South Korea 
to engage in sabotage and assassina-
tion. 
On Jan, 19, a 31-man team of North 
Korean raiders invaded Seoul with the 
object of murdering the president of 
the Republic of Korea. � 
' In many of these aggressive actions, 
Korean and American soldiers have 
been killed and wounded. 
The  North Koreans arc apparently 
attempting to intimidate the South 
Kowans and to interrupt the growing 
spirit of confidence and progress in 
the Republic of Korea. 
These attacks may also be an at-
tempt by the Communists to divert 
South Korean and United States mili-
tary resources which together are re-
sisting the aggression in Vietnam. 
This week, the North Koreans com-
mitted yet another wanton and ag-
gressive act by seizing an American 
ship and its crew in international 
waters. 
Clearly; this cannot be accepted. We 
are doing two things. 
First, we are today taking the ques-
tion to the Security Council of the 
United Natons. The best result would 
he for the whole world community 
to persuade North Korea to return 
our ship.. aril our men and to stop 
the dangerous course of aggression 
against South Korea. 
We have been making other diplo-
matic efforts as well. We shall continue 
to use every means available to find 
a prompt and peaceful solution to the 
problem. 
Second, we have taken and are tak-
ing certain precautionary measures 
to make sure that military forces are 
prepared for any contingency that 
might arise in the area. These actions 
do not involve a reduction in any way 
of our forces in Vietnam. 
I hope that the North Koreans will 
recognize the gravity of the situation 
which they have created. 
I am confident that the American 
people will exhibit in this crisis, as 
they have in other crises, the deter-
mination end unity which are necessary 
to see it through.

Soviets Seem Oblivious 
U.S. Envoy Reacts, But Not Kremlin . 
By Anatole Shub 
Washington Post Foreign Service 
MOSCOW, Jan. 26�Once I 
again, as in many a historic 
crisis, Moscow seems the calm-
est city in the world. 
Newspapers report on the 
Pueblo affair on inside pages, 
giving greater stress to Pre-
mier Kosygin's visit to India, 
the B-52 crash in , Greenland, 
the 1967 Soviet economic sta-
tistics and the 50th birthday 
greetings sent to Rumanian 
President Nicolae Ceaucescu. 
The papers, and medium. 
level Soviet officials encoun-
tered at various diplomatic 
receptions, are running half a 
day or more b shind events�
and offer little or no indica-
tion that the Soviet Union is 
in any way involved in the 
crisis. The press did not report 
that Kosygin had termed the 
Pueblo's activities "piracy" or 
that America is seeking Soviet 
intercession with Pyongyang. 
Same in 1941 
To old Moscow hands, all 
this seems normal. 
One veteran recalled that 
the city had only begun to 
stir at noon on June 22, 1941, 
eight hours after the Nazis 
had crossed the Soviet fron-
tiers. 
Western diplomats, too, con-
tribute their share to the 
"eye of the hurricane" calm. 
Newsmen only learned that 
'U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn 
Thompson was conferring 
with Soviet officials today by 
accident�en route to a recep-
tion, several reporters noticed 
the ambassadorial Lincoln, 
with Stars and Stripes flying, 
' outside the Foreign Ministry. 
The Ambassador later 
admitted it was his car but 
said nothing else about his 
. mission. Still later an informed 
source owned up to the fact 
that Thompson had been see-
ing "them" indeed, "virtually 
every day." 
[In Washington it was 
learned that Thompson saw 
Soviet Foreign Minister 
Andrei A. Gromyko today but 
got no further than during his 
earlier attempt in trying to 
persuade the Soviet Union to 
press Pyongyang to return the 
Pueblo and its crew.] 
Back at Work 
The Soviet news agency Tass 
had disclosed on. Monday that 
Thompson had been Kosygin, 
and Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk had disclosedT.sda 
that Thompson had met So-
viet Deputy Minister Vassily 
Kuznetsov. But today's talks�
plus anything the Ambassador 
may have been doing Wednes-
day and Thursday�remain top 
secret so far as Muscovites 
are concerned. 
Neverthesless, it was ap-
parent, from the light in his 
eye as well as his legendary 
discretion; that "Tommy is 
working again." For some 
month s, the Ambassador's 
well-wishers here had been 
fretting that America's most 
skillful and experienced nego-
tiator was being given noth-
ing much to negotiate. 
Vietnam probes were being 
conducted almost everywhere 
else and discussions on the 
missile race, proposed by the 
United States almost a year 
ago, have yet to get off the 
ground. It is clear today, how-
ever, that at leak one partic-
ular national resource is very 
much back in business. 
Other Western diplomats' 
!seem agreed that the Pueblo 
-incident is not a result of 
,Soviet instigation, that it is 
presenting the Soviet leaders 
with very ticklish decisions, 
and that American publicizing 
of the effort to obtain Soviet 
mediation will not make it 
easier for the Russians. 
The publicity inevitably giv-
en to the Soviet stand at the 
U.N. Security Council is also 
considered likely, to 'be un-
welcome to the Kremlin. If 
the Soviet leaders , are to ex-
ercise any sort of influence 
on the North Koreans, it is 
said here, they would doubt-
less prefer to do so in utmost 
secrecy�now virtually impos-
sible. Now, the Chinese are 
poised and ready, pens in hand, 
to denounce anything that re-
motely resembles Soviet-
American "collusion" to "be-
tray" the North Koreans. 
Such, at least, is the think-
ing among the relative hand-
ful of Western observers with' 
privileged access to outside 
news sources � while Moscow

across the border into the 
Republic of Korea, apparent 
acts in defiance of the United 
Nations Command. Envoys 
of the 16 nations involved in 
the 1950-53 Korean War 
were called in collectively 
yesterday by the State De-
partment. 
� Only after setting up 
that international and U.N. 
context did the President 
come to the Pueblo affair. 
When he did he referred to 
it as "yet another" wanton 
and aggressive act, even 
though the Pueblo was out-
side Korean waters accord-
ing to the United States and 
thus not a U.N. command 
matter. 
� In making his first 
public comment on the cri-
sis, the President said sim-
ply that the seizure cannot 
be accepted." Here he 
moved completely away 
from the verbal osculation 
of the past three days by 
Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk who had called the 
seizure an act of war" and 
declared that the only satis-
factory result would be "the 
prompt, may I say immedi-
ate, release" of ship and 
crew. 
The fact Is Administration 
officials know in their bones 
there is going to be no 
"immediate" release of ship 
and crew, barring a total 
reversal in the lengthy rec-
ord of North Korean hostil-
ity to the United States and 
the U.N. 
The President thus was 
implicitly recognizing that 
as a fact and choosing to 
build the best possible rec-

regime. Some Administra-
U.S. Eases Approach 
ToBuild Case for U.N. 
By Chalmers M. Roberts 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
President Johnson's short 
and exceedingly softly 
worded statement yesterday 
on the Pueblo incident, plus 
Ambassador Arthur Gold-
berg's presentation at the 
United Nations, demonstrate 
a clear decision to go the 
full diplomatic route before 
considering military action. 
Furthermore, the two 
statements strongly indicate 
that the President will want 
a United Nations umbrella 
over any military move he 
might consider. 
These implicit decisions 
rest on a simple fact: as De-
fense Secretary-designate 
Clark M. Clifford told a 
Senate committee on Thurs-
day, none of the various 
suggestions for military ac-
tion will "get our 83 men 
Cod- officials see the Gold-
berg statement as a rare op-
portunity for the United 
States to close the credibil-
ity gap with all but these 
who totally refuse to listen. 
Mr. Johnson rattled no 
rockets; he spoke only of 
"precautionary measures" 
for any possible "contin-
gency." 
The combination of the 
President's approach allows 
private diplomacy an oppor-
tunity. Here the Soviet 
Union quite probably will 
have the key role, since 
Moscow is tied to Pyon-
gyang by a mutual security 
treaty. 
United Nations debate 
means the Soviets will back 
fully the North Koreans in 
public; what they do in pri-
vate may be�Washington 
hopes � something else

back" and that is the chief 
aim. 
It follows, logically, that 
retrieval of the ship, by now 
doubtless picked to pieces 
by intelligence experts any-
way, is not worth the risk of 
war. 
Consider, first, that the 
President's statement yester-
day afternoon seemed anti-
climactic because it added 
nothing to the public record 
about the incident or the 
President's intentions. In 
fact, however, there were 
several key points in Mr. 
Johnson's handling of the 
incident: 
� He used five paragraphs 
to describe North Korea's 
"campaign Of violence"

_ 
again. But it may take a 
good deal of time. The last 
two Americans, helicopter 
pilots, captured by the 
North served a year before 
release. The President faces 
a similar prospect in the 
case of the Pueblo's crew-
men. 
Finally, there is the prob-
lem the President faces here 
at home in terms of public 
outrage at the Pueblo's seiz-
ure. It is noteworthy that 
Mr. Johnson said nothing to 
inflame public feeling; he 
called only for "determina-
tion and unity." 
A favorite Johnson ex-
pression for how to act at 
a moment of adversity when 
none of the alternatives 
seems very promising is to 
"hunker ' down like a jack-
rabbit in a hailstorm," That 
is what he was doing yester-
day.

There was no confirmation 
ported that additional U.S.

S. Koreans Are Nervous; 
U.N. Action 
Discounted 
In Seoul 
By Richard Halloran 
Wash'net= Post Foreign Service 
SEOUL, Jan. 26 � South 
Korean officials today ex-
pressed mild approval of U.S. 
military deployment for possi-
ble action against North 
Korea, but they were dubious 
that taking the crisis to the 
United Nations would accom-
plish anything. 
A government spokesman 
said that President Johnson 
has shown "firm determina-
tion" to stop "aggressive acts 
of provocation." He called on 
North Koreans "to repent of 
the crimes they have already 
committed" and return the 
captured USS Pueblo and its 
crew before North Korea is 
dealt "strong reprisals." 
The U.S. military moves 4n-
dude stationing the aircraft 
carrier Enterprise within 
striking distance of North 
Korea, moving two fighter 
squadrons from Okinawa to 
Korea, and calling up some 
U.S. reserves. South Korea re-
portedly is also considering a _ 
reserves callup. 
On the American decision to: 
take the conflict to the Secu-i 
rity Council, one Korean offi-
cial said, "All they do is sit ' 
around and talk." Others 
noted that North Korea has 
never recognized the compe-
tence of the United Nations to 
deal with any Korean prob-
lems. 
Diplomatic Moves . 
Foreign Minister Choe Kyu' 
Ha today called in all ambas-
sadors, including the French 
dean of the diplomatic corps, 
to discuss Sunday's attempted 
assassination of President 
Park Chung Hee. 
Cboe also instructed the 
South Korean U.N. observer, 
Kim Young Shik, to deliver a 
letter to Secretary General U 
Thant setting forth the South 
Korean case. 
The South Korean govern-
ment and people are still nerv-
ous about.. what the United 
States will do if the diplo-
matic approach fails, as they 
expect. Two reports that the 
United States had advised 
Seoul of American readiness 
to strike North Korea if diplo-
macy does not succeed were 
firmly denied by both U.S. 
and South Korean officials. 
In a sidelight, there was a , 
flurry of excitement when a 
Korean newsman noticed an 
American selling furniture in 
preparation for leaving Seoul. 
Although this is an everyday 
occurrence here, the Koreans 
read it as a sign of pullout if 
there is a war.

Ambassador Goldberg uses a map in stating the U.S. view in the Pueblo crisis. 
No Panic 
-Seoul generally was calm. 
The nighttime curfew has 
been moved back to the usual 
midnight deadline although se-
curity precautions after mid-
night are extremely strict. 
Nervous guards with fingers 
on rifle triggers stopped one 
vehicle six times last night in 
less than two miles. 
But this morning the skat-
ing pond in front of the Dult. 
Soo Palace in the center of 
Seoul was full of children bun-
dled in bright sweaters against 
Korea's clear but bitter cold 
winter. Night life is reviving 
in this usually funloving city. 
On the military front, an-
other American soldier was 
killed this � morning near the 
Demilitarized Zone in a fire-
fight with North Koreans. U.S. 
and South Korean troops con-
tinued to round up remnantS 
of the 31-man team that tried 
to kill President Park. They 
have killed 24 and captured 
one since Sunday.� 
North Korea reportedly has i

into full mobilization but has - 
not yet mobilized its 1.2 mil-

tary sources reported that 
North Korean Migs flew about 
40 sorties' near the DMZ

U.S. Insists 
Ship Was on 
High Seas 
By Robert H. Estabrook 
Washington Poet Foreign service 
UNITED NATIONS, 
N.Y., Jan. 26�The United 
States appealed grimly to 
the Security Council today 
to help obtain return of the 
captured naval vessel Pue-
blo and its crew lest con-
tinued international inac-
tion "be an invitation to 
catastrophe.". 
Using maps to demonstrate 
the position o: the Pueblo, 
U.S. Ambassador Arthur J. 
Goldberg cited monitored 
North Korean as well as 
American broadcasts which he 
said proved that the ship had 
not been in North Korean ter-
ritorial waters and was not 
when North Korean naval 
units boarded it Tuesday. 
The Pueblo was at least 15-
nautical miles from any North 
Korean territory at the time 
- of the incident, Goldberg indi-
'rated, and had standing in-
structions to stay at least 13 
nautical miles offshore. North 
Korea claims territorial waters 
to a 12-mile limit 
No Hat Pursuit 
"I want to lay to rest�com-
pletely to rest�some intima-
�tions.that the Pueblo had in-
truded upon the territorial 
wawters and was sailing away 
from territorial waters and that 
the Nirth Korean units were in 
1..  ht pursuit,� Goldberg assert-
led. 
"This is not the case at all," 
he added, referring to a map 
Ito show that the Pueblo had 
approached from the south-
east. 
Delegates sad the tense atmo 
'sphere in the Security Council 
was similar to that during the 
Cuban missile crisis, when the 
United States produced photo-
graphs to demonstrate the dan-
ger to members. 
Soviets Blame U.S. 
But the Soviet Union 
showed no sign here of serious 
concern. After criticizing the 
U.S. request to have the mat-
ter considered urgently and 
voting against adoption of the 
agenda, Ambassador Platon D. 
Morozo7 blamed the United 
States for all the tension over 
Korea. 
The United States, he said, 
is motivated by a "war psy-
chosis." 
Goldberg anticipated criti-
cisms that the Pueblo was a 
spy ship by asserting that So- " 
viet communications monitor-
ing ships are engaging in the 
same activities and sail much 
closer to foreign shores. 
One such Soviet ship right 
now is to be found in the Sea 
of Japan, and currently is not 
far from South Korean 
shores," he declared. 
Cites Terrorism 
In addition to presenting 
the urgent complaint about 
the Pueblo, Goldberg cited a 
new report by the United Na-
tions -command In South 
Korea noting a substantial in-
crease in instances of terror-
ism and sabotage perpetrated 
by North Korea. 
During 1967 there were 566 
such incidents in wIckli 153

Referring to the "so-called

The United States has 
stated its desire to settle 
the matter promptly and 
peacefully "and if at all pos-
sible by diplomatic means," 
he continued. 
"The existing situation can-
not be allowed to stand. It 
must be corrected and the 
Council must face up to its

rected. This course is far 
more preferable to other rem-

serves to member states." 
The last sentence was a 
possible reference to uni-
lateral military action by-the. 
United States under article 
51 of the Charter covering 
the right of self-defense. 
Goldberg referred to a 
broadcast by the Pueblo at 
noon last Tuesday, the time of 
the incident, saying it was 
stopped dead at a position 25 
nautical miles from the North 
Korean port of Wonsan, 16.3 
from the nearest point of the 
mainland and 15.3 from the 
nearest North Korean island. 
.An intercepted broadcast 
from North Korean sub chaser 
35, which accosted the Pueblo, 
cited a position a mile farther 
offshore, he asserted. 
He also cited broadcasts or-
dering North Korean vessels 
to make the Pueblo_their tan,

Pueblo and ordered it to 
heave to or face fire. - 
Intrusion Denied 
' The North Koreans knew 
that the Pueblo was lightly 
armed and "in no position to 
engage in a hostile, warlike 
act," Goldberg continued. One 
North Korean broadcast even 
referred to the veagel,a 
armed, he said. 
The Pueblo had come from 
the southeast, Goldberg said, 
referring to a map to show its 
course. He added: 
"It is incontrovertible from 
this type of evidence, which Is.

rea have brought about by

to his insistence that U.S. 
forces in South Korea � the 
remnants of the United Na-

a North Korean invasion in 
1950�are the cause of all the 
trouble. This is a line which � 
the Soviet Union tried .haM. 
to press in the General As-
sembly last fall. 
Another Communist dele-
gate said that Morozov had 
had no instructions from Mos-
cow as of noon today and that 
he would engage in a holding 
operation. 
Ironically, Morozov was fill-
ing in for the newly designat 
Soviet permanent rep enta-

Deputy Foreign Minister Ja-

cil in the spring of 1950 en-

What the United States can 
expect to gain from the_Jks:

remains unclear.

're Uniled State.; has re-
quested this meeting, as 1 
stated in. toy letter lo you, 
to consider the grave threat 
to peace which the authori-
ties of. North Korea have 
brought about by their in-
creasingly dangerous and 
aggressive military actions 
in violation of the Korean 
armistice agreement of 1953, 
of the United Nations Char, 
ter, and of international law. 
We have asked that the 
Council be convened at an 
hour when peace is in seri-
ous and imminent danger 
action � is required to avert 
�when firm and forthwith 
that danger and preserve 
peace. 
A virtually unarmed ves-
sel of the United Stales 
Navy, sailing on the high 
seas, has been wantonly and 
lawlessly seized by armed 
North Korean patrol boats. 
and her crew forcibly di--
tained. This warlike action 
carries a danger to peace 
which should be obvious to 
all. 
A party of armed raiders, 
Infiltrated from North Ko-
rea, has been intercepted in 
the act of invading the 
South Korean capital city of 
Seoul with the admitted as-
signment of assassinating 
the president of the Repub-
lic of Korea. This event 
marks the climax of a cam-
paign by the North Korem 
authorities, over the past Id 
months, of steadily growing 
infiltration, sabotage and 
terrorism in flagrant viola-
tion of the Korean armistice 
agreement. 
Parallel Actions 
Mr. President, these two 
lines of action are manifest-
ly parallel. Both stem from 
North Korea. Both are com-
pletely unwarranted and un-
justified. Both are aimed 
against peace and security 
in Korea. Both -violate thc 
United Nations Charter, sol-
emn international ag re e-
ments, and time-honored in-
ternational law. And both 
pose a grave threat to peace 
in a country whose long 
search for peace and reunifi-
cation in freedom has been 
an historic concern to the 
. United Nations and of any 
country. 
We bring these grave de-
velopments to the attention 
of the Security Council in 
the sincere hope that t h e 
Council will act promptly to 
l'emove the danger to inter-
national peace and security. 
For Mr. President, it must 
be removed and without de-
lay. And it will be removed 
only if action is taken forth-
with to secure the release ' 
of the USS Pueblo and its 
83-man crew and to bring to 
an end the pattern of armed 
transgressions by North 
Korea against the Republic 
of Korea. My government 
has stated at the highest 
level our earnest desire to 
settle this matter promptly 
and peacefully and, it at ail 
possible, by diplomat ic 
means. 
It is testimony to this de-
sire that infidelity to the 
charter my government has 
-brought this matter to the 
Security Council which has 
the primary responsibility 
for the maintenance of in-
ternational peace and secur-
iiy. and which, ogothor with 
other organs of the United 
Nations, has a special, an 
historic concern Inc peace 
and security in Korea.

� 
Responsibility 
It is imperative, therefore, 
that the Security Council 
act with the greatest urgen-
cy and decisiveness. The ex-
isting situation cannot be al-
lowed to stand. It must be 
corrected and the Council 
must face up to its respon-
sibility to see it corrected. 
This course is far more pre-
ferable to other remedies 
which the cicis.rter rests:Ix-a 
to member states. 
Let' one' flow turn to the 
!acts concerning these two 
aspect:: of No-lb Korean 
aggressive conduct on which 
the C:ouncirs action is ur-
� gently required. 
Al 12 noon on January 23, 
Korean time, the United. 
Stares Ship Pueblo manned, 
' by a crew of six officers, 75 
enlisted men, and two civil-
'tans, and sailing in inter 
national waters off the 
North Korean coast, was 
.cortfronted by a heavily 
armed North Korean patrol 
heat identified as submarine 
chawr Number 33. 
� The strict instructions 
under which the Pueblo was 
operating required it to stay 
at least 13 nautical miles 
from. the North Korean 
coast. While my country ad-
heres to the three-mile rule 
of international law con-
cerning territorial waters, 
nevertheless the ship was 
under orders whose effect 
was to stay well clear of the 
12- mile limit which the 
North Korean authorities 
have by long practice fol-
lowed. 
The USS Pueblo reported 
this encounter and its loca-
tion at the time in the fol-
lowing words�and I wish to 
quote exactly what was re-
ported by radio at the time 
of the encounter � "USS 
Pueblo encountered one 
SO-1 class North 'Korean 
patrol craft at . 0300"�that 
is at 12 noon Korean time�
and then, I am repeating its 
broadcast�"position 39-25.2 
NL 127-55.0 EL DIW." I 
might explain that DIW 
means "dead in water," the 
,stanArd termtnology mean-

t; Now,- With e,,,,,s� 
k 
rn, Mr. Presi � i it. I :Mould 
ike.' to refer -to this matt 
provided for the convenience . 
of the Council and show the 
exact location of the Pueblo 
as given in these coordi-
nates. If the members of tht 
Council will look at the map, 
you will see a Number 3 
blue. Number 3 blue is ap-
proximately 25 nautical 
miles from the port of Won-
san. It is 16.3 nautical miles 
iron) the nearest point of 
the North Korean mainland 
en the peninsula of Hod�. 
Pando, and 15.3 nautical 
miles from the island of 
Ung-do. 
Now, at exactly the same 
time, the North Korean sub-
marine chaser Number 35 
which intercepted the Pueb-
lo reported its own location 
in the Number 3 red�and 
this is a report now from 
the North Korean submarine 
chase]. Number 35 monitored 
by us�and that location was 
19 degrees 25 minutes north 
� latitude and 127 degrees 56 
minutes east longitude. You 
will note the positions. In 
other words, these two re-
ported positions are within 
a mile of one another and 
show conclusively that ac-
cording to the North Korean 
Amor', as well as cur own, 
Mat the Pueblo was in inter-
national waters. 
Oral Message 
The report of its location 
liy the North Korean craft, 
inade by international morse 
code, was followed ten min-
utes later by the following 
oral message from the North 
Korean craft to its base, ' 
and I quote it: "We have 
approached the target here, 
the name of the target is 
GEE 1-2." 
Now, we talk about the 
Pueblo and that is the name 
by which the ship is, of 
course, known. But the tech-
nical name for this ship is 
GEE 2 and this name was 
painted on the side of the 
ship. 
The. message continued, 
and I again quote-the Korean 
radio message in Korean 
words: "Get it? GEE 1-2: 
did you get it? So our con-
trol target is GEE 1-2. 1 will 
send it again. Our control 
target is GEE 1-2." 
Inasmuch as the location 
of the Pueblo is of course a 
matter of vital importance, 
it is important to the Coun-
cil to know that the informa-
tion available to the United 
States as reported by our 
a easel to our authorities and 
to the North Korean author-
ities as reported by its ves-
sel and transmitted by its 
� own ship was virtually iden-
tical, with only this small 
margin of difference. And, 
interestingly enoug h, the 
North Korean ship reported 
the Pueblo to be about a 
mile farther away from the 
shoreline than the United 
States fix of its position. So 
you see, the North Korean 
broadcast, monitored, was 
reporting what I have stated 
to this Council. 
Mr. President, we have 
numerous other reports dur-
ing this encounter consistent 
With the location I have de-
scribed. A n d information 
other than coordinates cor-
roborative of what I have 
said IS by voice monitor. In-
formation on rordinates, 
as I said, was by internatiOn-
el mors,. ende.  
: 2018/08/22 C06638269 
'Heave To' 
The North Korean patrol 
boat, having made its ap-
proach, used international 
flag signals to request the 
Pueblo's nationality. The 
Pueblo, replying with the 
same signal system, identi-
fied herself as a United 
States vessel. The North 
Korean vessel then sign-
alled: "Heave to or I will 
open fire on you." The Pue-
blo replied: "I am in inter-
national waters." 
The reply was not chal-
lenged by the North Korean 
vessel, which under interna-
tional law, if there had 
been an intrusion�which 
there was not�should have 
escorted the vessel from the 
area in which it was. How-
ever, that vessel then pro-
ceeded for approximately an 
hour m circle the Pueblo, 
which maintained its course 
and kept its distance from 
the shore. At that point 
three additional North Ko-
rean armed vessels appeared, 
one of which ordered the 
Pueblo: "F olio w in my 
wake." As -this order was is-
sued, the four North Korean 
vessels closed in on the ' 
Pueblo and surrounded it. 
At the same time two Migt 
aircraft appeared overhead 
and circled the Pueblo. The 
Pueblo attempted peacefully 
to withdraw from this encir-
clement but was forcibly 
� Prevented from doing so and 
brought to a dead stop. It 
was then seized by an armed � 
boarding party and forced 
into the North Korean port 
of Wonsan. 
Now, reports from the 
North Korean naval vessels 
no their location and on 
their seizure of the Pueblo 
at this point show that the 
Pueblo was constantly in in-
ternational waters. 
At 1:50 p.m. Korean time, 
within a few minutes of the 
reported boarding of the 
Pueblo, North Korean ves-
sels reported their position 
at 39-26 NL 128-02 EL or 
about 21.3 miles from the . 
nearest North Korean land. 
This is the point on the map 
here. And we would-be very 
glad. Mr. President, to make 
this map di ailable for the 
rncorcis nf t h e Sceuhty 
Council. 
.211) 
Denies Intrusion 
Now. Mr. President. I 
want In lay to rest�com-
pletely to rest�some intima-
tions that the Pueblo had in-
truded upon the territorial 
waters and was sailing away 
from territorial waters and 
that the North Korean ships 
were in hot pursuit: This is 
not the case at all and I 
shall demonstrate it by this 
map. 
Now, we will show by 
limes and the course of the 
vessel exactly what occurred 
and you will see from this 
that the location of the Pueb-
lo was constantly far away 
from Korean shores, always 
away from the 12-mile limit 
until it was taken into Won-
san by the North Korean 
vessels. The locations of the 
Pueblo are shown on the 
blue line and the location of 
the SO-I 035, the first North 
Korean vessel, on the red 
Now, the Pueblo, far from 
having sailed from inside 
territorial waters to outside 
territorial waters, was cruis, 
ins in an area�in this area 
�and this will he demon-
strated by the time sequence 
�and when I say, "this 
� area," I mean the area that 
is east and south of any ap-
proach to the 12-mile limit. 
� At 0830 Korean local time, 
the Pueblo was at the loca-
tion I now point to on the 
map. It had come to that 
point from the southeast, 
not from anywhere in this 
vicinity. And that is point 
one on the map so that our 
record will be complete. 
Point two on the map shows 
the position of the North 
Korean submarine chaser 
number 35 as reported by 
her at 10:55, and you will 
see that she is close to�the 
North Korean vessel, not 
the Pueblo � the 12-mile 
limit 
Point number three is the 
� position reported by the 
Pueblo at 12 o'clock noon 
and you will see that she is 
a considerable distance from 
the 12-mile limit, which ii 
the dotted line. 
Red point number three is 
the position reported by the 
North Korean submarine 
chaser number 35 at 12 
o'clock noon, when it signal-
led the Pueblo to stop. In 
other words, this is the po-
sition of the North Korean 
vessel, this is the position of 
the Pueblo; and the position 
of the North Korean vessel 
that I point, to, the red line, 
.the position audibly by the 
North Korean vessel. There 
In very little difference in 
these two reports. 
Mitt number four is the 
position reported by the 
North Korean vessel at. 
13:50, 1:50 p.m., when she re-
ported boarding the Pueblo. 
And you will recall that I 
just told the Council that 
the Pueblo, seeking to 
escape the encirclement, 
did not move in the direc-
tion which would have trans-
gressed the 12-mile limit. 
Now, all of this is verified 
not by reports solely from 
the Pueblo; all of this is 
verified by reports from the 
North Korean vessels which 
were monitore." and I think 
it is a very clear picture of 
exactly what transpired. 
Here, too, Mr. President, 
with your permission, we 
will make this available. 
Approved for Release: 
North illieans' Intent 
Mr. 11111Fident, it is ineon-
trovertible from this type of 
evidence, which is physical . 
evidence of International 
Morse Code signals and 
voice reports, that the Pueb- � 
lo when first approached 
and when seized, was inter-
national waters, well beyond 
the 12-mile limit; and that 
the North Koreans knew 
this. 
Further compounding this 
offense against internation-
al law, and the gravity of 
this warlike act, is the fact 
that the North Koreans 
clearly intended to capture 
the Pueblo, knowing that it 
was in international waters, 
and force it to sail into the 
port of Wonsan. This aim is 
made clear by messages ex-
changed among the North 
Korean vessels themselves 
which we. monitored, includ-
ing the following: "By talk-
ing this way, it will be 
enough to understand ac-
cording to present instruc-
tions we will close down the 
radio, tie up the personnel, 
tow it and enter port at 
Wonsan. At present we are 
on our way to boarding. We 
are coming in." This is an 
EACT voice broadcast from 
the ship which acknowledges 
the instructions that it was 
following. 
Now, Mr. President, in 
light of this, this was no 
mere incident, no ease of 
mistaken identity, no case 
of mistaken location. It was 
nothing less than a deliber-
ate, premeditated, armed at-
tack on a United States nav-
al vessel on the high seas, 
an attack whose gravity is 
underlined by these simple 
facts which I should now 
like to sum up. 
The location of the Pueblo 
in international waters was 
fully known to the North 
Korean authorities since the 
broadcasts were not only be-
tween its own ships but 
were directed to its shore 
installations. 
The Pueblo was so lightly 
armed that the North Kor-
eans in one of the converse-
-. lions which we have moni-
tored even reported it as un-
armed. 
The Pueblo was therefore 
in no position to engage in 
� a hostile, warlike act towards 
the territory or vessels of 
North Korea; and the North 
Koreans knew this. 
NeVerthesless, the Pueblo, 
clearly on the high seas, was 
forcibly stopped, boarded 
and seized by North Korean 
armed vessels. This is a 
knowing and willful aggres-
sive act�part of a deliberate 
series of actions in contra-
vention of international law 
and of solemn international � 
arrangements designed to 
keep peace in the area, 
which apply not only to land 
forces but to naval forces as 
well. It is an action which � 
no member of the United 
Nations could tolerate. 
I might- add, in light of 
the comments of the distin-
guished Soviet representa-
tive on the adoption of the 
agenda, that Soviet ships 
engaged in exactly the same 
activities as the Pueblo sail 
much closer to the Shores of 
other states. And one such 
� Soviet ship right now is to 
be found in the Sea of Ja-
pan, and currently is not 
far from South Korean 
Shores.

grave caleitory of aggressite 
actions taken by the Nort!i

systematic campaign of in-

demarcation line, in gross 
violation of the armistice 
agreement�not only in the 
vicinity of the Demilitarized

deep in the territory of the 
Republic of Korea � cul-
minating in the recent raid 
against the capital city of 
Seoul, the Presidential Pal-
ace and the person of the 
President of the Republic. 
The gravity of this cam-
paign has already been made 
known to the Security Coun-
cil. Last Nov.2 I conveyed 
to the Council a report front 
the United Nations Com-
mand in Korea, summing tip 
the evidence of a drastic in-
crease in violations by 
North Korea of the Korean 
armistice agreement and 
subsequent agreement per-
taming thcrto. This report, 
Security Council Document 
S/8217 noted that the number 
of incidents involving arm-
ed infiltrators from North 
Korea had increased from 
50 in 1966 to 543 in the first 
ten months of 1967; and that 
the number of soldiers and 
civilians killed by these in-
filtrators had increased 
frome 35 in 1966 to 144 in 
the same, period of 1967. 
The further report of the 
United Nations Command 
for the whole year 1967, 
filed today, shows a :Mai of 
566 incidents for 1967 and 
a total of 153 individuals 
killed by the North Korean 
infiltrators, The United Na-
tions Command in its report 
has further pointed out 
that, although North Korea 
had refused all requests by 
the United Nations Corn-
mandin for investigation of 
these incidents by joint ob-
server teams pursuant to 
the armistice agreement, 
the evidence that the at-
tacks had been mounted 
Irons North Korea is incon-
testable. This eveidence is 
subject to verification by 
these reports, which are on 
file with the Security Coun-
cil. 
The terrorist campaign, 
Mr.- President, has now 
reached a new level of out-
rage. Last Sunday, Jan. 21, 
security forces of the Re-
public of Korea made con-
tact with a group of some 
30 armed North Koreans 
near the Presidential Palace 
in Seoul. In a series of en-
gagements, both in Seoul 
and between Seoul and the 
Demilitarized Zone, lasting 
through .ban. 24, about half 
or this. group were killed 
and two captured. It has 
now been ascertained that 
the infiltration team totaled 
31 agents, all with the rank 
of lieutenant or higher, dis-
- patched from the 124th 
' North Korean Army unit; 
that these agents had re-
ceived two years' training 
including two weeks of 
training for the present mis-
sion, in special: camps es-
tablished in North Korea ' 
for this purpose; and that 
their assigned mission in-
cluded the assassination of 
the president of the Repub. 
lie Of Korea. 
T." add, .7\f r.17F-resi-
dent, that the North. Kbrean 
authorities make no secret 
of the political stratc:_ly and 
motivation behind these at-
tacks.. Their daily propa-
ganda vilifies the govern-
ment of the Republic of 
Korea and denies its very 
right to exist. Yet, Mr. Pres-
ident, this same government 
of the Republic of Korea is 
recognized by 77 zovern-
ments, is a member of nu-
merous specialized agencies 
of the United Nations and 
enjoys observer status at 
the United Nations Head-
quarters. 
Increase in Tempo Seen 
Mr. President, it is obvious 
-that this long series of at-
tacks by North Korean infil-
trators across the Demilitar-
ized Zone � and by other 
groups of North. Korean 
armed personnel , which, 
traveled by sea, have pene-
trated into even the south-
ern portions of South Korea 
� has steadily increased in 
its tempo and its. scope � 
until it threatens to under-
mine the whole structure of 
the armistice regime, under 
which peace has been pre-
served in a divided Korea 
for 14 years. 
In the interest of intern-
Donal peace and security. 
this deterioration cannot he 
allowed to continue. It must 
be reversed promptly. The 
armistice agreements must 
be restored to their full 
vigor, and the weight of the 
influence of the Security 
Council must he exerted to 
this vitally important end. 
Mr. President, these are 
the facts of the threat to 
peace created by North 
Korea's aggressive actions 
on sea and land. With all 
earnestness I ask the Serur-
ity Council to act firmly and 
swiftly to rectify this dan-
gerous situation and elimin-
ate this threat to peace. 
Despite the most Serious ' 
provocation � a provocat inn 
which every nation would 
recognize as serious and 
dangerous�my government 
is exercising great restraint 
in this matter. We seek to 
give the processes of peace-
ful action all possible scope. 
We believe those Processes 
, can work swiftly and effec-
tively, if the international 
community �including the 
members of this Council, 
individually and collectively, 
so will it. 
But, Mr. President, these 
peaceful processes must 
wan. Titc present situation 
is not acceptable and it can- I 
not be left to drift. This 
great and potent organiza-
tion of peace must not let 
the cause of peace in Korea 
be lost by default to the 
high-handed tactics of a law-
less regime. Such a course 
would be an invitation to 
catastrophe. 
Therefore, let the Security 
Council, wills its great influ-
ence, promptly anti effec-
tively help to secure forth-
with the safe return of the 
Pueblo and her crew, and 
to restore to full vigor anti 
effectiveness the Korean 
armistice agreement. 
Fellow members of the

A SOVIET TRAWLER 
'MAILS ENTERPRISE 
Intelligence Ship Sailing in 
Midst of Carrier's Task ' 
Force Off South Korea 
By United Press International 
� WASHINGTON, Jan. 26�De-
fense Department officials said 
tonight that a Soviet intelli-
gence-gathering vessel was 
shadowing the nuclear aircraft 
carrier Enterprise off the coast 
of South Korea. 
The Soviet vessel, identified 
as the Gidrolog, was said to be 
sailing in the midst of the En-
terprise's task force, which in-
cludes a guided-missile ship 
and several destroyers. 
� The trawler is on essentially 
the same sort of mission as 
the Pueblo was engaged in 
when she was seized by the 
North Koreans on Tuesday, the 
officials said. 
The Enterprise was sent to 
the Sea of Japan off Korea in 
a show of force in response to 
the seizing of the Pueblo and 
the 83 men on board. 
Another Soviet Ship in Area 
, The United States is doing 
nothing about the trawler's 
presence, the officials said, be-
cause she is in international 
waters. In the past, the United 
States has largely ignored the 
activity of such trawlers,. even 
when they got inside United 
States ship formations during 
maneuvers. 
The officials cited the traw-
ler as an example of how com-
monplace such seaborne es-
pionage was. [The Pentagon 
declined comment on the report 
that a Soviet ship was trailing 
the Enterprise, Reuters re-
ported.] 
Meanwhile, at the United 
Nations, Arthur J. Goldberg, 
ithe United States delegate, 
lcharged that another Soviet 
;intelligence ship "right now is 
to be found in the Sea of 
1Japan, not far from South Ko-
rean shores." 
The officials said the seizure 
of the Pueblo was not t;ua tc 
error in judgment on the par 
of the skipper, ComJr. Loy,' 
'J. Bucher. 
They said the ec^' .�� c 
United f'.-t'n m""-.7 � (^:". 
.rnifReis- nOrtb- to' ther 
Pueblo's aid was not because 
of a lack of American military 
strength in the area. 
Rather they cited four facts: 
qAmerican military officials 
in the area were not immed-
iately sure of just what had 
occurred, whether the incident 
was a deliberate act by the 
North Koreans, a mistake or 
the unauthorized act of a local 
commander. 
qThe weather was bad for 
dispatching aircraft to the area. 
There were snow flurries and a 
relatively low ceiling. 
.q0nly three to four hours of 
daylight were left at the time 
Commander Bucher radioed his 
first request for assistance. He 
did this when his ship was ac-
tually boarded, the officials 
said, an hour and. 45 minutes 
after first being confronted by 
North Korean forces. 
(Military commanders had to 
assume the attack might. have 
been, planned' and in that case, 
the North .Koreans would also 
have planned to have reinforce-
ments available. . 
Because of these factors, the 
Defense officials said, the com-
manders in the Pacific area 
decided against immediately 
dispatching aircraft to the 
scene. 
The officials said American 
intelligence - gathering ships 
such as the Pueblo, were corn 
'monly followed or harassed by 
;ships of Communist nations. 
I They said that, if the United 
.States wanted to, it could pick 
.up "15 to 20" Soviet intelli-
gence trawlers that operate off 
the American coast.

'SENATORS ASSAIL 
POLICY ON PUEBLO 
ar.widt Charges 'Bungling'.�
Rusk Is Sad to Promise 
Review of Spy Ship Use 
By JOHN W. FINNEY 
Special to The New Took Thews 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 � 
The Administration ran into 
criticism and charges of "bung-
ling" today in the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee 
for permitting the intelligence 
ship Pueblo to operate off the 
North Korean coast at a time 
of political tension in the Far 
East. 
As a result of the criticism, 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk 
was reported to have given as-
surances that the Administra-
tion would reconsider its poli-
cies governing the operation of 
electronic spy ships off the 
shores of Communist nations. 
Meanwhile, in New York, 
Senator Jacob K. Javits called 
for Congress to conduct an in-
quiry into the Pueblo incident 
and other foreign policy issues. 
Mr. Rusk, who appeared be-
fore the committee in executive 
session for a secret briefing 
on the Pueblo incident, ob-
tained the unanimous support 
)f the committee members for 
:.he Administration's diplomatic' 
efforts to obtain from North 
Korea release of the Pueblo 
and her crew. 
The committee members 
were reported to have stressed 
that the Administration should 
not rush into any military ac-
tion. 
Committee Is Critical 
But when Mr. Rusk asked 
for committee advice on how 
to handle the incident, he was 
reported to have received in-
stead criticism of the Adminis-
tration for permitting the in-
cident to develop. 
The sharpest criticism was 
reported to have come from 
Senator Karl E. Mundt, RepUb-
lican of South Dakota, who is 
normally one of the more mili-
tant conservatives on the com-
mittee. 
In response to the Rusk re-
quest for advice, Senator Mundt 
was understood to have com-
plained that the Administration 
had "bungled very badly" in 
permitting the Pueblo to oper-
ate off the North Korean coast. 
Senator Mundt was reliably 
reported to have told Mr. Rusk 
that "we should not be running 
spy ships into controversial 
areas in a provocative manner 
unless it is highly important 
that we get information that, 
is not otherwise available." 
If such missions are absolute-
--
or by naval power over use 
horizon." 
Similar criticism, in some-
what less blunt terms, was un-
derstood to have come from 
other committee members, such 
as Senator Frank J. Lausche, 
Democrat of Ohio, and Senator 
Stuart Symington, Democrat of 
Missouri. � 
In response to the criticism, 
.Mr. Rusk was reported to have 
;told the committee members 
that the Administration "might 
have to rethink" its past poll-
-cies on the operations of in-
telligence ships and take steps 
to see that such incidents as 
,the seizure of the Pueblo did 
not recur. 
'Uneasy Truce' 
From the criticism, it was 
apparent the Pueblo incident 
was having the significant po-
litical effect of producing a co-
alescing of views between lib-
erals and conservatives on the 
committee, between critics and 
supporters of the Administra-
tion's. Vietnam policy. 
Their new common ground 
is a desire for a Congressional

expressed some doubts that 
high authorities in the execu-
tive branch and the military 
were aware of the mission of 
the Pueblo. 
The effect of the Pueblo inci-
dent, in the opinion of some 
committee members, will there-
fore be to reinforce a move 
within the committee to inves-
tigate the Administration's 
handling of the 1964 Gulf of 
Tonkin incidents, in which two 
American destroyers were re-
ported to have come under 
attack by North Vietnamese PT 
boats. 
The Rusk briefing was under-
stood to have put to rest the 
suspicions of some committee 
members that before the sei-
zure, the Pueblo might have in-
truded into North Korean terri-
torial waters, as has been 
charged by North Korea. 
Territorial Waters 
Asked by reporters after 
the hearing whether the Pueblo 
had at any time entered North 
Korean territorial waters be-
fore her seizure, Mr. Rusk re-
plied:

matic negotiations before other 
courses are taken to rescue the 
Pueblo. 
Senator Percy, a Republican, 
said at a news conference here 
that "I agree with the President

must take into account that 
what we have at stake here is

The Senator came here to 
address a dinner given by the

more than a year ago to provide 
financial help to widows and

Some U.S. Codes 
Altered Since Loss 
Of Intelligence Ship 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 � 
Some code changes have been 
made as a general precaution 
by the United States Navy and 
other Government agencies 
since the intelligence ship 
Pueblo was seized by North 
Korea Tuesday, American of-
ficials said today. 
But the officials said that 
even without these changes 
there would have been no risk 
to other secret messages. 
The codes used by the Pueblo 
and other American ships in 
communication with their com-
mand points are. unique, the 
officials said, so the capture of 
one vessel would not provide 
the key to other codes. 
A security breach of another 
sort might have occurred, how-
ever. If any of the Pueblo's 
code machines was captured 
intact, examination by experts 
would give the Communists in-
formation about American com-
munications techniques. 
It would not allow the break-
ing of a code, but it could re-
veal how some of the complex ' 
devices work.

U.S. ASKS U.N. TO OBTAM RELEASE 
OF SHIP AND CREW HELD IN KOREA; 
JOHNSON, ON TV, TAKES GRAVE VIEW 
The New York There 
SPEAKS FOR THE U.S.: Arthur J. Goldberg uses a snap at the United Nations as he 
presents case against North Korea. It shows Pueblo's positions before and during seizure.. 
By DREW MIDDLETON 
special to The sew York "Imes , 
UNITED NATIONS. N. Y.; 
Jan. 26�The United States ap-
pealed to the Security Councir 
today to obtain the safe return' 
of the American intelligence 
Ship Pueblo and her crew from: 
North Korea and to restore the, 
Korean armistice agreements 
to full effectiveness. 
Arthur J. Goldberg, the Unit.: 
ed States representative, told 
the Council that the seizure of. 
the Pueblo by North Korean 
patrol boats last Tuesday was 
"no case of mistaken identity, 
no case of mistaken location;". 
but "a deliberate premeditated 
[armed attack on a United: 
1States vessel on the high seas."-
Mr. Goldberg buttressed his 
assertions that the Pueblo bact 
'never been inside Korean ter-
ritorial waters by citing mes-
sages transmitted by the North 
Korean vessels. These, Mr. 
Goldberg asserted, indicated 
that both the American ship 
and its captors had been out-
side the 12-mile limit that 
iNorth Korea enforces. 
Long Speech by Russian 
The opening meeting of what 
is expected to be a stormy 
debate was dominated by Mr. 
Goldberg and Platon D. Moro-
zov of the Soviet Union. 
Mr. Morozov, who unsuccess-
fully contested the inscription 
of the issue on the Council's' 
agenda, answered Mr. Goldberg 
with a long speech in which he 
scoffed at the American argu-
ments and dismissed as worth-
less the chart and map that the 
American spokesman had in-
troduced to trace the course of 
the encounter off North Korea. 
Mr. Morozov told the Council' 
he preferred the evidence pro- � 
vided by a purported confession 
by Comdr. Lloyd Bucher of 
the Pueblo that was broadcast 
over the North Korean radio 
last night. 
Mr. Goldberg replied that this 
was natural in view of the So� 
-
viet experience with "fabricated 
confessions." 
He also charged that a Soviet 
_intelligence ship "right now is 
to be found in the Sea of Japan, 
not far from South Korean 
�shores.'! Defense officials in 
Continued From Page 1, Col. 8 
Washington said tonight that 
one such ship was in the midst 
of the task force that included 
the nuclear carrier Entreprise 
;off South Korea. But a member 
of the United States Mission at 
the United Nations said Mr. 
Goldberg had been referring to 
another Soviet ship. 
Today's council meeting, 
which Agha Shahi of Pakistan 
as this month's President con-
vened at 4:23 P.M., recessed at 
6:43. He said the Council would 
meet again at 10:30 A.M. to-
morrow. 
The attitude taken in today's 
proceedings by the Soviet dele-
gate, Karoly Csatorday of Hun-
gary and Tewfik Bouattoura of 
Algeria indicated strong opposi-
tion to any effective action by 
the Council. 
These three diplomats voted 
against inscription of the issue 
on the Council's agenda, but 
the twelve other members voted 
n favor. One, Armand Berard 
of France, quickly explained 
that his favorable vote did not 
reflect any stand on the sub-
stance of the issue. 
Mr. Goldberg prefaced his 
case with a warning that the 
Council must act with "the

The Council, he said must 
accept its responsibility to cor-
rect the situation and this, he 
added, would be preferable to 
"other remedies" that the Char-
ter reserves to member states. 
This was interpreted by 
some diplomats as an allusion 
to Article 51, which says that 
nothing in the Charter "shall 
impair the inherent right of in-
dividual or collective self-de-
fense if an armed attack occurs 
against a member of the United 
I Nations until the Security 
Council has taken measures 
necessary to maintain interna-
tional peace and security." 
Mr. Goldberg included in his 
speech a sharp attack on North 
Korean infiltration into South 
Korea and described the gen-
eral deterioration of the situa-
tion in the peninsula. This "de-
terioration cannot be allowed 
M continue," he declared. 
But the main focus of his re-
marks was that the Pueblo had 
been captured in international 
i waters and not within North 1:

showed that she was 16.3 nauti-
cal miles from the nearest point 
of the North Korean mainland, 
or 4.3 miles outside of what 
the North Koreans consider as 
their territorial waters. 
A major point in the case 
presented by Mr. Goldberg was 
that a report from the North 
Korean patrol boat No. 35, 
which intercepted the Pueblo, 
showed that her position was 
within a mile of the American 
ship at the time. The North 
Korean report had been moni-
tored by the United States. 
Another North Korean re-
port, also intercepted by the 
Americans. also placed the 
Pueblo and her interceptor out-
side the limits of North Korean 
waters, !Mr. Goldberg declared 
But the North Korean report, 
he went on, put the Pueblo 
about one mile further away 
from the North Korean shore-
line than the United States fix 
did. 
Mr. Goldberg used a chart 
and a map of the area of the 
encounter off the port of Won-
san to illustrate his points and 
to answer the argument that 
the Pueblo had invaded terri-
torial waters and" was sailing 
away with the North Korean 
ships in hot pursuit. 
The two reported positions, 
Mr. Goldberg emphasized, "show 
conclusively that, according to' 
the North Korean report as 
well as our own," the Pueblo 
was in international Waters. 
Soviet Practice Noted 
Mr. Goldberg said that Sovie 
ships "engage in exactly th, 
same activities as the Puebloj 
and sail much closer to thel 
shores of other states." It was 
in this connection that he said 
one such vessel was now in the 
Sea of Japan not far from 
South Korean waters.

North Korean patrol craft. The 
broadcasts, breaking a four-day 
silence, echoed North Korean

has been denied by the United

Hsinhua, the official Chinese

distributed earlier by North 
Korea's official press agency. 
Hsinhua said the Pueblo had 
"intruded deep into the coastal

J.S.`CRISIS CENTER'i 
KEEPS DAILY YIGIL1; 
State Department Post Has 
'Dr. Strangelove' Aspects 
By NAN ROBERTSON 
Special tom, New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26�At 
first glance, it looks like the 
Walter Cronkite newsroom 
millions of Americans see on 
i 
[television every night. 
There are Teletype machines, 
maps, wall clocks giving the 
'times -around the world, multi-
'color phones, shirt-sleeved as-
.sistants and tables piled with 
printed messages. 
This is the State Depart-
ment's closely guarded Opera-
tions Center�really a "crisis 
center." The seventh-floor com-
mand pest jumped yesterday in 
the wake of the seizure of the 
American intelligence vessel 
Pueblo by North Korea on 
Tuesday. 
In it works, 24 hours a day, 
a series of five-man teams. The 
center was set up in April, 
1961 after the Cuban Bay of 
Pigs debacle. Ills electronically 
hooked up with the Pentagon's 
National Military Command 
Center, commonly called "the 
tank"; and the White House's 
"Situation Room." 
I On a normal day, more than 
300 messages, all of them ur-
gent, flow into the State De-
; pertinent center. During the 
;Arab-Israeli war last June, the 
I number went up to 1.000 daily. 
1 Wall Screens and Phones 
The night senior watch of-
ficer must decide whether to 
wake the President or the 
Secretary of State if a crisis 
develops. 
The last year has been par-
ticularly hectic, according .to 
the center's deputy director, 
James E. Ralph. He ticked off, 
the upheavals in Greece, Yem-
en, the Middle East, the Congo, 
Nigeria, Vietnam and Cyprus 
and the international financial 
turmoil set off by the devalua-
tion of the British pound. 
The "Dr. Strangelove" as-
pects of the Operations Center 
tend to dispel the first impres-
sion of a TV newsroom. There 
is the small, soundproofed 
,"Telecon Room," where Secre-
tary of State Dean Rusk and 
'other Cabinet officers "talk" to 
American outposts via wall , 
screens' that instantly flash in-. 
coming and outgoing questions , 
and answers. 
' There are Teletype machines! 
, that 'encode and decode the, 
'top-secret messages transmit-,

There is the white phone, 
which rings at the White House 
Situation Room as soon as the 
man at State picks it up. Along-
side are the gold phone for the 
Pentagon and the powder-blue 
phone for the Operations�Cen-
,ter at the Central Intelligence 
� Agency. � 
The center performs two 
other important functions on 
top of its receiving and alert-
ing duties. One is to put out, 
top-secret digests twice a day, 
(the morning summary is blue-
bordered, the evening one i 
brown-bordered) of key incom-
ing cables. 
Another function is what Mr.: 
Ralph describes as "crisis man-
agement." When serious trou-I

U.S. Officials Confess to Frustration 
Over How to Recover Pueblo and Crew 
By PETER GROSE 
Itlosels1 to The New York Times 
- � - 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26�Tol 
ill appearances,- -the Commu-
list regime of North Korea has 
xposed both the vulnerability 
. . 
nd the limitations of the vast 
ower of the United States. 
American diplomats confess 
. sense of frustration and des-
isir about what can be done 
:o recover the intelligence-gath-
ering ship Pueblo 
and her crew of 
83. As in dealings 
with North Viet-
nam, the problem 
is not so much 
finding channels of diplomatic 
contact as what to say through 
those channels. 
What serious inducement can 
the United States offer to bring 
about concessions from the 
North Korean Government 
except the threat of something 
so violent as to make the situa-
tion far worse than it -is 
already? This question is very 
much alive in official Washing. 
:on today. 
For the present, the Johnson 
A.dministration is oasing its de-
nands for the return of the 
.hip and its crew on strictly 
egal grounds, both in its public 
nd private channels of corn-
, nmication. 
Insistence by Rusk 
There is no wavering from 
,the firm statement that the 
Pueblo was in international 
waters at the time she was 
seized. Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk insisted that "at all 
stages" the vessel remained 
more than 12 miles from the 
coastline, according to the 
signals received in Washington. 
It was noted, however, that 
during her cruise, there were 
periods of radio silence from 
the Pueblo. This left open the 
possibility that the ship had 
previously, and silently, moved 
closer to the Korean coast for 
better soundings. 
In any case, officials here 
recognize that the North Kor-
ean Government and other in-
terested Communist regimes 
are not likely to take Wash-
ington's word on .this delicate 
point and surrender to inter-
national law. So what next? 
The military options drawn 
up by the Pentagon immediately 
after the ship was seized Tues-
day seem increasingly imprac-
tical. 
A bold commando sweep into 
Wonsan harbor to recover the 
ship might conceivably suc-
ceed. But, it was thought, it 
would only endanger the Ameri-
can crewmen held, in effect, as 
hostages. 
Officials believe the 83 Amer-
icans have already been dis-
persed to various prisons and 
hospitals. Four of them have 
I been reported wounded. 
Similarly, it is expected some 
punitive act, an air or sea raid 
against some North Korean in-
stallations � would also fail 
to free the Americans. 
The Administration apparent-
ly has no desire to attempt any 
i ground action or raise the level 
of tension along the military 
� demarcation line separating 
North and South Kerea. Even 
� if there were a reason to think 
that something could be gained 
by this means � and there is 
none � a second front of com-
bat in Asia is not an attractive 
prospect. 
Moreover, heightened tension 
News 
Analysis 
in Korea might well force the 
withdrawal of nearly 50,000 
South Korean troops now fight-
ing alongside the United States 
and other allies in South 
Vietnam. 
A counterseizure of some 
North Korean 'patrol boats is 
regarded as a dubious under-
taking. 
There appears to be a similar 
paucity of political options. The 
mere fact that there are no 
exchanges between the United 
States and North Korea�trade, 
cultural, technical � raises a 
good argument for the desir-
ability. of such exchanges even 
with hostile countries. As it 
stands, there is nothing that 
can be cut off. 
Payment of compensation, 
ransom for 83 American lives, 
would be distasteful, but not 
new. Premier Fidel Castro of 
Cuba accepted tractors and 
drugs in return for the release 
of prisoners after the Bay of-
Pigs invasion in 1961. 
Initially, the Johnson Admini-
tation is basing a slim hope 
on the United Nations, perhaps 
a Security Council request to 
Secretary General Thant for 
his personal intervention. 
But to North Korea, the 
United Nations is something 
less than a neutral agent. It was 
under the United Nations flag 
that American and other troops 
fought in the Korean war 15 
years ago, and that blue and 
white insignia still flies on the 
Southern side of the armistice 
line. 
The United States 'has also 
asked the International Red 
Cross to arrange the release 
of the prisoners. This organi-
zation had some success after 
the armistice of 1953, but then 
there were North Korean pris-
oners to offer in exchange for 
the Americans. 
An obscure international 
body, left over from the ar-
mistice agreement, might be re-
activated now. It is called the 
Neutral Nations Supervisory 
Commission, composed of Swe-
den. Switzerland, Czechoslo-
vakia and Poland, and it has 
the singular distinction of be-
ing recognized by both the 
North Koreans and the United. 
States. 
This commission, nes been 
moribund since the early post-
armistice days When it was re-
quired to supervise troop with-
drawals to the armistice lines. 
These political options are 
likely to be pressed in the days 
to come through third coun-
tries that maintain embassies 
lin Pyongyang, the North Ko-
rean capital. 
United States officials refuse 
to discuss which countries are 
being asked to play a role, but 
obvious candidates are Indone-
sia, Yugoslavia, Rumania or, 
perhaps, India or Ceylon, which 
have consular relations with 
the North Koreans. 
A Blunder on Soviet 
Only one channel has been 
publicly identified�a request 
for Soviet good offices�and 
some officials concede that the 
Johnson administration blun-
dered in disclosing the ap-
proach to Moscow: 
Secretly, the Russians might 
have been able to help, it is 
'believed. Publicly, their stance 
has to be one of complete sol-
idarity with another ,Commu-
nist regime. 
The one direct contact be-
tween an official United States 
representative and a North 
Korean officer, at a meeting 
of the Military Armistice Com-
mission in Panmunjon Wednes-
day, brought such a vehement 
North Korean response that of-
ficials look for no progress 
through that channel. 
Through whatever channel it 
is arranged, it may be that only 
some kind of apology and pub-
lic surrender of the Pueblo will 
succeed in obtaining release of 
the prisoners. This is not a 
nice prospect for the Johnson 
Administration in an election 
year. but observers think it 
might have to be that or. 
nothing.

!POW Trade. 
j For Pueblo 
By Bernard D. Nossiter 
Washington Post Foreign Service 
NEW DELHI, Jan. 27�The 
Pueblo and its crew could be 
freed in exchange for cap-
tured North Koreans and 
some form of acknowledge-
ment that the spy ship was in 
North Korean waters. 
! This was the gist of sugges-
tions relayed here today by 
.1well-placed Russian sources. 
!These sources are in a parl icu-
path: good position to speak 
!since Soviet Premier Kosygin 
lis in the midst of a state visit 
'here.. 
The Russian aides have 
been careful to spell out noth-
ing explicitly. However, they 
are making two things plain: 
� Kosygin is anxious to 
lower temperatures over the 
seizure of the Pueblo. 
� Moscow is in touch with 
North Korea despite ll'ashing-
ton's assertion that the Rus-
sians have twice rejected U.S. 
requests for help in releasing, 
the ship. 
The latest disclosure indi-
cates that North Korea is rais-
ing its price. On Friday, the 
Russians indicated that an 
acknowledgement that the ship 
had violated North Korean wa-
ters � an acknowledgement 
that could be made by pay-
ment of a fine�might be 
enough. 
Just which captured North 
Koreans arg supposed to be 
freed is unclear. There are 
probably dozens of North Kore-
ans held in the South, both 
spies and soldiers taken during 
the frequent clashes at the 38th 
parallel in the last year. 
Just what form the admis-
sion that the Pueblo was in 
North Korean waters should 
take is also murky. The So-
viets note that North Korea 
has released a statement pur-
portedly coming from the 
Pueblo's captain and conced-
ing the violation. 
When the Russians are told 
that this "confession" is 
couched in stilted language

This was some of the think-
ing as President Johnson's sen-
ior advisers met at the State 
Department yesterday for per-
haps the tenth or twelfth time 
since word on the Pueblo's 
capture was first flashed here 
Tuesday. 
Taking part were Secretary 
of State Dean Rusk, Defense 
Secretary Robert S. McNa-
mara, CIA Director Richard 
Helms, Gen. Earle C. Wheeler, 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff: Under Secretary of 
State Nicholas deB. Katzen-
bach and Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State Samuel D. 
Berger. Berger, a former 
U.S. Ambassador to South 
Korea, heads State's special 
Korean crisis task force. 
The President paid an un-
expected visit to the National 
Press Club last night in con-
nection with the inauguration 
of its new president, Allan W. 
Cromley, and told the audi-
ence that petty differences 
"should fade into the back-
ground" in times of crisis. 
In Des Moines, Iowa, vice 
President Humphrey told a 
Democratic Party conference 
that the Pueblo crisis had unit-
ed Americans. He also said in 
an Associated Press interview 
that the Pueblo attack was de-
signed to divert attention from  
North Korea's "political and 
economic mess" and to upset 
South Korea's plans to send, 
50,000 mare troops to South 
Vietnam. 
At the White House, Press1 
Secretary George Christian 
said the President was in ten-
stant telephone touch with, 
his senior advisers and per� 
-
sonal meetings would be held' 
with them throughout the 
weekend "as the situation; 
warrants." 
Christian refused to corn-
ment on statements by Sen.: 
Karl Mundt (R-S.D.) that the 
Administration has agreed to 
review its policy of sending 
unescorted and lightly armed 
spy ships into hostile waters. 
Mundt made his remarks 
after hearing testimony by 
Rusk Friday in a closed sea-
sion of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
When queried, Rusk said his 
testimony had not been "ac-
curately characterized." 
In New York, Richard M. 
Nixon, again a probable Re-
publican candidate for the 
Presidency, declared it "all 
but incredible" that no pro-
tection had been given the, 
Pueblo. 
"The Communist world has 
been jointly testing the propo-
sition that the United States 
is over-extelidod, Over-corarni 
ted and under-prepared to . 
act," Nixon told a Renublican 
Women's Club luncheon. 
He said the first order of 
business was to obtain the re-
lease of the Pueblo's 83 men. 
"But the longer-range need is 
to reestablish the credibility 
of American policy by reestab-
lishing the credibility of Amer-
ican power," Nixon declared. 
In Searcy, Ark., Senate For 
eign Relations Committe: 
Chairman J. W. Fulbright (D-
Ark.) threw doubt on the Ad-
ministration's insistence that 
the Pueblo had never in-
truded into North Korea's ter-
ritorial waters. 
Fulbright said flatly that his 
committee' investigation of 
the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Inci-
dent found the two U.S. de-
stroyers involved had indeed 
intruded into the territorial 
waters of North Vietnam. 
A Pentagon spokesman said 
yesterday that the USS Mad-
dox was 25 miles from North 
Vietnam during the first at-
tack by North Vietnamese pa-
trol boats and that the Mad-
dox and USS Turner Joy were 
60 to 65 miles off the coast 
during the second attack. But 
he did not mention Fulbright's 
charges that the ships had 
been spying and had been in 
North Vietnamese territorial 
waters prior to the attacks. 
Senate Majority Leader 
Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) yes-
terday told Associated Press 
Reporter Jack Bell that he 
was satisfied that the Pueblo 
had been in international 
waters. "But if it would bring 
about the release of the ship 
and the crew, I would admit 
that it was taken in territorial 
waters, even though that is not 
the truth," Mansfield declared.

Johnson Meets With Top Advisers! 
On Korean, Vienamn. Problems 
By Carroll Kilpatrick 
Waahington Post Staff Writer 
President Johnson conferred 
with top official as well as un-
official advisers on Korea and 
Vietnam yesterday but no 
major decision or progress on 
either crisis was announced. 
With the American military 
buildup proceeding in Korea 
as well as at the threatened 
Khesanh base in Vietnam, 
Mr. Johnson held a day-long 
series of meetings on the criti-
cal Asian developments. There 
appeared to be considerable 
concern about the threat to 
Khesanh. � 
All of the members of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff were 
summond to the White House 
for a meeting with the Presi-
dent. 
Press Secretary George 
Christian said that while diplo-
matic efforts to free the Pueblo 
and its crew were continuing, 
"there has been and is a prud-
ent ond orderly and limited 
deployment of American mili-
tary forces in the area." 
On Capitol Hill, Senate 
lipeeches reflected the grow-
ing concern over North Ko-
rea's failure to show any signs 
of meeting American demands.

when critical problems beset 
him, he brought in such for-

Soviets Said 
To Want 
Quiet Talks 
By Bernard D. Nossiter 
Washington Post Portion Service 
NEW DEHI, Jan. 29�The 
Soviet Union is disturbed by 
what it considers over-publi-
cized American efforts to seek 
Moscow's aid in resolving the 
Pueblo crisis. 
Russian informants indi-
cated today that if the Soviet 
Union is to play any role, 
much more discreet approach 
is required for both internal 
and external political reasons. 
The attention drawn to 
American overtures is blamed 
for the absence of a Soviet re-
sponse. And the insistence on 
quieter diplomacy, it is ex-
plained, stems from several 
factors. 
The Russians are suspicious 
lof U.S. motives. They say that 
their earlier attempts to play 
a middleman role in North 
Vietnam frequently blew up in 
their faces because of some 
fresh incident or escalation on 
the American side. 
The Soviet Union is also 
said to fear that its prestige 
would be damaged if an overt 
move to solve the Pueblo 
problem foiled. , 
man of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, and Cyrus R. Vance, 
former Deputy Secretary of 
Defense. 
They lunched with the Presi-
dent after holding meetings 
Sunday and Monday morning 
at the State Department and 
White House. 
Also at the luncheon were 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk, 
Secretary of Defense Robert 
S. McNamara, Secretary-desig-
nate Clark M. Clifford, Gen. 
Earle G. Wheeler, chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs, and Henry 
Cabot Lodge, Ambassador at 
Large and former Ambassador 
to Vietnam. 
The Defense Department an-
nounced that additional "air-
craft, ships and bodies" had 
been alerted for "possible 
movement" to the Korean area 
in connection with the Pueblo 
crisis. 
"We are continuing our ef-
forts to reach a peaceful solu-
tion" in Korea, Christian re-
ported. He said that in addl. 
tion to the announced efforts 
to achieve a solution through 
the United Nations and with� 
the assistance of Moscow, 
"there are a number of other 
channels available to us which 
are active at this time." 
"It would not be desirable 
to discuss these," he added. He 
indicated, however, that an at-
tempt by the International 
Red Cross to obtain informa-
tion on the condition of the 
Pueblo's crew had not yet been 
successful. 
The meeting with the Joint 
Chiefs, Christian Said, was to 
Moreover, Moscow is reluc-
tant to appear in the eyes of 
the world to be telling North 
Korea what to do. Russia's 
hcavy-handed dealings in the 
Communist world have 
touched off resentful feelings 
that are still causing Moscow 
pain. Thus, anything that Rus-
sia does in the Pueblo affair 
must not appear to infringe on 
North Korea's sovereignty. 
As the Russians themselves 
point out, their relations with 
Pyongyang are somewhat ten-
uous. They have improved 
since the days when North 
Korea looked exclusively to 
China but are still a matter of 
some delicacy. 
Finally, the Russians have 
their own hawks with which 
they must contend: The 
suggestion here is that there 
are forces in the Soviet Union 
that would like to see the 
United States involved in a 
second Asian front and are 
urging that nothifig be done to 
reduce the tension generated; 
by the Pueblo's seizure. 
For all these reasons, Mos-
cow is indicating that it can 
serve as a channel at only the 
most secret level. 
Meanwhile, Premier Kosy-
gin, who is visiting here, and 
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

lersistent theme was reported 
to be Chinese power.

itary questions raised by ca-
bles and other reports to the 
President over the week end. 
Korea also was discussed, he 
said. 
The unofficial advisers con-
sidered, in addition to critical 
mlitary issues, the Asian aid 
programs and civil develop-
ments in Vietnam. Christian 
said that the group�meets pe-
riodically with the President. 
At the Capitol, Senate Re-
publican Leader Everett M. 
'Dirksen (Ill.) said "I don't' 
disdain diplomatic efforts but; 
.1 want to be sure that North. 
Korea does not get the idea 
they can get away with this. 
"We've been treated to a 
king-sized dose of caution 
from some quarters ... Let's 
not be impatient, they say." 
But no one should get the 
idea the United States is "go-
ing to take this lying down," 
Dirksen said. 
Senate .Democratic Leader 
Mike Mansfield of Montana, 
however, urged caution. He 
said it would do no good to go 
iinto Wonsan and recapture the 
Pueblo by force or bomb North 
Korea as that would "seal the 
doom of the 83 Americans. 
Two Republican Senators�
Karl E. Mundt (S.D.) and Robd 
ert P. Griffin (Mich.)�called 
for an investigation of the 
ship's seizure. 
In asking for the inquiry, 
Mundt said that "the United 
States will emerge from this 
experience a weaker and 
sadder Nation." 
' Mrs. Gandhi, it is under . 
stood, proposed that New 
Delhi and Moscow exchange 
intelligence on Peking's activi-
ties. Indian sources say that a 
similar arrangement now ex-
ists with the United States. 
iKosygin was reportedly cool 
to the idea, perhaps because 
of the Indo-American intelli-
gence tie. 
KOSygin is said to have 
urged the Indians to settle 
their differences with Paki-
stan, arguing that such a reso-
lution would further isolate: 
Peking. Mrs. Ghandhi is bed 
lieved to have answered with 
the standard New Delhi line: 
India would welcome a settle-
ment but Pakistan first wants 
to solve the historic dispute 
over Kashmir and New Delhi 
wants to talk about Kashmir 
only after other issues are re-
solved. 
In one area, the Indian. 
Ocean, there appears to be a � 
closer meeting of minds. The.; 
IndianSproposed that they fill' 
the power vacuum in the re-
gion that will be left by the 
departure of the British. To 
do this, New Delhi would want 
more arms aid. The Russians 
are believed to have looked 
sympathetically at this sugges-
tion. Prom their standpoint, 
-n armed Indian presence in 
the ocean would be more 
siralile than an Ameriean 
force. 
The Associated P-rets �re-
ported this separate develop-
ment from Paris: 
The Russians privately ac-
cept the American explanation 
that the Pueblo was in inter-
national waters when the 
North Koreans seized it, West-
ern diplomatic sources re-
ported. This conflicts with So-
; viet Premier Kosygin's state-
ment Sunday that the vessel 
;had violated North Korean 
:territorial waters.

Pueblo 
Fatality 
Reported 
Rest of Crew 
Well Treated, 
U.S. Is Told 
By Carroll Kilpatrick 
Washimon Post Staff writer 
Administration officials 
said yesterday that they 
had received reports that - 
one crew member of the 
Pueblo was dead. The oth-
ers were being properly 
treated by their North KC-1 
rean captors. 
The White House and the 
Defense Department said they 
were unable to confirm thr 
reliability of the reports, which 
also said that medical atten. 
Lion was being given to the 
wounded or injured. 
The International Red 
Cross, which was asked to con-
tact the North Korean Red 
Cross, apparently has been 
unsuccessful to date in its ef-
forts to obtain firm informa-
tion on the condition and, 
whereabouts of the Pueblo's 
crew. 
Injuries Reported 
Just before the Pueblo was 
captured, it reported that: 
three or four of its men were � 
hurt, one critically. 
North Korean Gen. Pak 
Chung Kuk said at Panmun-
jom Wednesday that North 
Korea's vessels "returned the 
fire" of the Pueblo, "thus kill-
ing and wounding several sol-
diers of the U.S. imperialist 
aggressive army." 
White House Press Secre-
tary George Christian gave 
the first report yesterday that 
information had been received 
that the men were being prop-
erly treated and the injured 
were receiving medical atten-
tion. 
Later, the Defense Depart-
ment said that it had an un-
confirmed report that one 
man was dead. The supposi-
tion was that the seriously in-
jured man had died. He re-
portedly suffered severe leg 
injuries at the time of the cap-
ture.

President Johnson contin-
ued to divide his time between

Reagan Asks 
End of Korea 
'Appeasement' 
By JACKSON DOYLE 
Special to The Stu' 
SACRAMENTO � Republican 
Gov. Ronald Reagan says there 
are ways of halting "appease-
ment" of North Korea in the 
Pueblo incident, but the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff should decide ex-
actly how. 
At his first Capitol press 
conference since capture of the 
U.S. inteilligence ship and its 83 
crewme n, reporters sought 
elaboration on the presidential 
' "favorite son" candidate's re-
cent off-the-cuff remarks that 
the U.S should have given 
North Korea 24 hours to release 
the Pueblo or "go in and get 
it.'' 
Cites Alternatives 
He explained yesterday: 
' "When you use the term 'Go in 
and get it; I don't think this 
should be taken literally as 
meaning you are going to go in 
and put a tow line and pull it 
out of there. 
"Now there are a number of 
alternatives that would have 
been open. I don't know that 
anyone outside the government 
who doesn't have access to the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff could make 
a choice from outside as to 
what should be the procedure. 
"But there are a number of 
things that have since been pro-
posed by people with experience 
in the national government in. 
volving blockading of harbors, 
involving the counter-seizing of 
their shipping and holding it 
uuntil ours is returned. 
"But I still say there is no 
moral justification for this 
country standing by and letting 
what amounts to an act of pira-
cy, an act of war, be perpetra-
ted upon us and write off 83 
young men and hope that maybe 
some, way the other side will 
soften and give them back." 
Doesn't Ask Attack 
Later in response to further , 
questions, Reagan reiterated' 
that he was not calling for an 
"armed attack, a bombing, or' 
an invasion." 
He said, however, that the 
ship involved was in internation-
al waters when seized by North 
Koreans and that President 
Johnson's conduct in the entire 
incident "is a continuation of a 
policy of appeasement that 
started a long time ago." 
"When we started Writing let-
ters and asking others to inter-
vene for us, we had lost when 
could have been our best meth-
od," Reagan said. 
"We are the most powerful 
nation in the world and I wonder 
what guarantee any American 
citizen has from any little 
fiffh-rite pee!egtif it isspparont 
that OW 0:04 tweaViotw. pad

Following a statement last 
night by the Security Council 
president for January, Pakistani 
Ambassador Agha Shahi, that 
Afro-Asian delegations were un-
dertaking "urgent consultations" 
on their own, the five bloc mem-
bers currently holding seats on 
the Security Council were to 
meet here this morning. 
They are Algeria, Ethiopia, 
India, Pakistan and Senegal. 
The main thrust of their effort 
is believed to be toward an Afro-
Asian intermediary to gain re-
lease of the Pueblo and its crew 
from North Korea, while appeal-
ing to the United States to desist 
from any more military escala-
tion in the Korean area. The 
mediation would be unofficial 
and outside any formal resolu-
tion of the Security Council. 
Consulate Relations 
One advantage is that many 
members of the Afro-Asian bloc 
at the United Nations have 
consulate relations with North 
Korea. 
The initiative would probe 
both North Korean and Ameri-
can intentions. 
So far no delegation here�
' including the Russians and 
their allies�has been able to 
say definitely what North Korea 
wants for release of the Pueblo 
and her crew. 
� Western diplomats, while un-
certain whether the Afro-
Asians can agree or get any 
farther than anyone else has 
in the past week say such a 
"neutral" Initiative would give 
North Korea an opportunity to 
close the incident gracefully. 
Many delegates assume the 
seizure was simply a diversion-
ary tactic in the war of nerves 
in Korea and that the Commu-
nists have learned all they 
want from the ship and its 
I crew. 
I Furthermore, the U.S. dele-
gation here has made it clear 
that the return of the crew and 
the ship � either together or 
separately�is an essential pro-
invitation to North Korea to ard the Pueblo would have to be 
come to the Security Council 
for a wide-ranging debate on 
the deteriorating over-all Kor-
ean situation. 
So long as the Pueblo crew 
is held hostage, the U.S. mis-
sion insists. no U.N. invitation 
is possible. Nor is the United 
States prepared for "promnt 
action" on release of the Pueblo 
to be delayed by a long wran-
gle ' in the Security Council 
over isuing that invitation and 
a waiting game over North 
Korean acceptance. ' 
As the possible compromise, 
the release of the crew would 
come simultaneously with the 
U.N. invitation to North Korea. 
Focus of Talks 
The terms of such kri invita-
tion have been the main focus of 
negotiations this weak among 
the 10 nonpermanent members 
of the Security Council. 
Diplomats are impressed with 
the increasingly authoritative 
tone of Hungarian Ambassador 
Karoly Csatorday � the only 
Communist member of the 
group � about the North Korean 
position. They assume the Hun-
garian government is in direct 
contact with the North Korean 
capital of Pyongyang over the 
crisis. 
Yesterday he told the other 
nine members of the nonperma-
nent group-meeting with Coun-
cil President Agha Shahi�that 
although members of , the 83-
man crew of the Pueblo are be-
ing treated humanely, one had 
died from wounds suffered 
when North Korean naval units 
seized the ship. No other details 
were available. 
The Defense Department said! 
the report was unconfirmed, am' 
there was no way of identifying 
any casualties among the cap-
tured men. 
The report followed a w'hite 
Rouse statement that it had 
been advised the crew was being 
treated properly and the wound-
ed were receiving medical care. 
While the Americans claim 
the ship is as important as its - 
crew, most observers here be-, 
_:iieve the U.S. would take return-
of the men-E- with.a promise of ' 
I progress telfeard return of the I 
I ship as enough for simulta-
neously issuing North Korea an 
I invitation to a Security Council 
' debate. 
established in a bargain between 
the United States and the Soviet 
Union. 
No one here expects an- em-
barassing public debate on the 
whys and wherefores of inviting 
North Korea. 
Dangerous 'Game  
tinksicies*cofea 
1 
�, STAFF111141CISCO�Ta Ko-
rean. crisis involves a trio of 
decision-making agonies. One 
is in Washington, in the Amer-
ican power-center; the second 
is in the Communist power-
center at Moscow; the third is 
in Pyongyang itself, where the 
North Koreans have had to 
make a fateful decision. What 
happens finally will depend on 
the point at which the three 
intersect. 
President Johnson and his 
advisers have been playing it 
cool, but how long will they be 
able to keep the American 
people cool? Moscow has been 
playing it stony-faced, but 
that, too, may vanish when 
they learn that Washington 
means business. Pyongyang 
has covered itself with a thick 
propaganda cloud, making it 
hard to separate its current 
exultation in a propaganda 
success with a graver long-
range intent. 
The danger lies in the 
chance that somewhere in this 
three-cornered game that na-
tions play someone may as-
sume the others are bluffing 
when they are in dead earnest. 
The fact is that it is a game 
that mono of the three can win 
if it retails in more shooting. 
The Sipe is that all three will. 
know it before it itioe Iai 
I shouldn't enjoy being in' 
President Johnson's seat at 
this point. He has been careful 
not to say anything that would 
heat up the American pas-
sions. Everyone has known 
that governments today en-
gage in electronic spying, and 
everyone has assumed that if 
'the ships are far enough off-
shore they can get away with 
it. The Pueblo was far enough 
offshore, in international wa-
ters, and in that sense the sei-
zure was a violation of inter-
national law, even though the 
ship was on an obvious intelli-
gence mission. The American 
people consider the seizure an 
act of piracy, and any senator 
or President who runs afoul of 
this mood does so at his politi-
cal peril. 
It takes skillful leadership in 
Washington to stay cool and 
determined at the same time. 
One trusts there will be no 
break in this mood. At some 
point, of course, there must be 
the credible intent to act with 
power if the strategy of per-
suasion fails. The questions 
are what action, and how 
much power. 
Washington 'has little pres-
sure it can exert on Moscow ito 
, persuade its iCorean 'ally ex-
cel* the tgiedf el a thowtiownt 
� on the Soviet spy ships dis-
guised as trawlers and fishing 
boats. If that fails, both Mos-
cow and Pyongyang must ask 
themselves whether they want 
to run the risk of a repetition 
of the adventure they ended in 
Korea almost 15 years ago, 
this time with a strong South 
Korean army as an opponent, 
aided by American planes. 
The Americans in turn must 
ask themselves whether they 
want to add a second messy 
war, even if limited to the air, 
. to the current messy war in 
Vietnam. The prospect of this 
may cool off the ardor of some 
of the senators and congress-
men and governors who have 
come out with "go-in-and-get-
out-the-ship-and-men state-
ments. It is interesting that 
several senators who are 
doves on Vietnam have called 
for strong action on Korea. 
But nothing will be lost with 
the lapse of some time for 
cooling and real negotiation. 
The ship and the men will still 
be there. 
Obviously, the Vietnamese 
war complicates everything. If 
not for Vietnam, the American 
government would have more 
options and a freer hand. Yet 
it is also true that by handling 
himself skillfully on Korea�as 
he did in the Cyprus crisis and 
the Arab-Israeli war � Pres-
ident Johnson could gain add-
ed strength both at home and 
in world opinion. 
The key to the crisis lies 
with North Korea's intent to 
play off its old ally, China, 
against its new ally, Russia, 
and thus get its share of 
leadership and glory in the 
Communist world. If so, the 
key to the solution will have to 
lie with Russia and its 
capacity to keep its ally within 
the bounds of nonfanatical 
action. 
If the crisis gets resolved, 
and the men and ship are 
returned, we may. later have 
in 
the luxury of an quest into 
what actually happened on the 
Pueblo at the moment of 
decision, how the ship was left 
unprotected, what options the 
commander had, why he made 
the choice he did. We are 
learning that at even this 
level of decision-making, in his 
lowly spot in command of a 
small intelligence craft, a 
young American had to make 
a choice on which not only his 
whole career and reputation 
depended, but tie risks o

A. B. Pond. 
Ship Seizure and U.S. Options 
Some thoughts, practical 
and theoretical, concerning 
the Pueblo: 
1. It has become fashionable 
to observe that the credibility 
gap is such as to entitle John 
Doe to disbelieve the Ameri-
can government, and believe 
the government of North Ko-
rea. Thus for instance Murray 
Kempton of New York confess-
es, not alas unsadly, that he 
will accept the enemy's ver-
sion, inasmuch as "North Ko-
rea hasn't lied to the lately." 
One day after this assertion, 
the North Koreans *released 
the taped confession of the 
commander of the Pueblo. 
"The crime committed by 
me and my men is entirely 
indelible," says the command-
er � sez North Korea � add-
ing that he hopes "that we will 
be forgiven leniently." The 
commander went on to explain 
that a "lot of dollars would be 
offered to all crew members of 
my ship and particularly my-
self would be honored." 
Since no such English was 
ever spoken by any American, 
even at Annapolis, we may 
submit the "confession" as a 
North Korean lie and hope, 
perhaps, that the American 
Left will acknowledge the pos-
sibility of a credibility gap 
where Communists are con-
corned. 
2. I.s it likely  that the Puehio � 
was inside the 12-mile lank 
.ral -therefore fechnicall-Lin 
th a N vtion ot ortn-KOreara se-
curity?nieneto. nNoo,uorecayuses,nthip  r

ment  
signed tor medium-range and 
long-MI-OM- work, -not-for 
getfinT-ZES-e-
shorgire so That the bo'sun 
can spot fhe�enemTiam the 
eroyalest. Under the circum-
stances, it is inherently im-
plausible that the 12-mile limit 
was violated. 
However, 3, if the United 
States is confident of its case, 
why doesn't it demand that an 
international inspection com-
mittee immediately inspect 
the Pueblo's navigational log, 
assuming it has not been de-
stroyed? By checking the ra-
dar notations. Loran lines (if 
there are such in that area), 
depth readings, and even the 
celestial sights, it can be in-
ferred with virtual certainty 
whether the Pueblo was guilty. 
4. What do we have to fear 
from the detention of the boat, 
other than the blow to our 
pride? I do not diminish the 
importance of the latter mere-
ly by bringing up the possible 
importance of the former. Do 
we have, aboard the Pueblo, 
vital security information the 
removal of which by the ene-
my would seriously affect the 
national interest? Is that infor-
mation to be found in written 
form, in which case one as-
sumes it has been removed 
(and hopes that it will be 
translated into Korean by the 
same gentleman who wrote 
Commander Bucher's mes-
sage); or, that which is 
most valuable, or equally val-
uable, is the refined electronic 
machinery aboard the Pueblo? 
In the latter event, the 
United States Navy ought not 
to have deliberated overnight. 
A bombing raid should have 
gone over to Wonsan with or-
ders to sink our own ship, 
which surely is our right to 
do; and if the marksmanship 
of our pilots is a little rusty 
and it turns out that we also 
sank the North Korean boats 
that brought in the Pueblo, 
why, you can't win them all. 
5. On the business of asking 
everyone on the street, partic-
ularly Republican presidential 
candidates, "What would you 
do if you were President?" 
There are only two replies 
which are both prudent and 
wise. The first is that "such a 
thing wouldn't have happened 
if (insert name of the 
candidate) had been Presi-
dent." The second is that the 
capture of the Pueblo is evi-
dence of an unsuccessful for-
eign policy. Two-bit countries 
just don't go about shanghaing 
the property of a major power 
if that major power is re-
spected. 
But on the other hand, it is 
inappropriate to suggest that 
you should begin achieving 
respect by a devastating retal-
iation against North Korea to 
teach the world that lesson 
now. That is a lesson one 
teaches gradually. To atomize 
North Korea now would be as 
unjust as for a perennially in-
dulgent father suddenly to 
beat the daylights out of a son 
he had spoiled. 
And 6, isn't the Pueblo inci-
dent yet another indication of 
the failure of the policy of the 
counter-salient? The enemy 
strikes, we attempt to contain; 
but always on the battleground 
selected by the enemy, with 
his sure feel for our own weak-
nesses. What are we doing on 
such battlegrounds as we in-
disputably govern, or could 
govern? The economic battle-
front? The psychological bat-
tlefront? What we are doing 
there is financing Communism 
by food and economic credits, 
and fawning on the Commu-
nist world in order to prove 
the purity of our intentions. 
Our intentions should be at 
least impure enough to protect 
the integrity of our fleet on 
international waters.

� 
Pueblo a Lesson in Small-Power Brinkmanship 
The American people are 
going to have to take many 
trips to the brink, occasionally 
drinking from the bitter well 
of war. 
That is the grim challenge 
and the ominous lesson of 
North Korea's hijacking of the 
USS Pueblo. 
"Brinkmanship" became a 
dirty word during John Foster 
Dulles' tenure as secretary of 
state. It was regarded as reck-
lessness on the part of the 
United States. But seven years 
of Democratic rule have 
shown that it is the Commu-
nists who decree that periodi-
cally U.S. nerves must be test-
ed by rolling the world up to 
the edge of nuclear war. 
In 1961 it was the threat of 
war over Berlin. We stood 
firm as we rebuilt our conven-
tional military might, and 
Khrushchev backed down. 
In 1962 it was the Cuban 
missile crisis. We hung tough, 
and Khrushchev caved in. 
Vietnam has been a more 
subtle testing of the American 
will � and in terms of public 
rfrdtte 
point than the earlier confron-
tations. 
Now North Korea has goad-
ed Uncle Sam with a bit of 
brinkmanship in the harsh 
Berlin-Cuban missiles tradi-
tion. 
It would be calamitous, in 
my view, if we flinched in the 
face of North Korean brigand-
age any more than we flinched 
in earlier crises. Mere sanity 
dictates that diplomatic ef-
forts be made to resolve such 
conflicts peacefully, but if the 
ultimate U.S. posture is one of 
weakness the wave of the fu-
ture is clear: It will be an 
intensification of Communist 
pressures and affronts on ev-
ery continent. 
To understand why the 
North Koreans would chal-
lenge the United States so 
brashly, we need to look at the 
differences between the Pueb-
lo incident and the Berlin and 
Cuban confrontations. In the 
latter incidents, the two great 
nuclear powers were in direct 
confrontations from the start. 
So the specter of nuclear holo-
caust loomed large at the very 
.outset. And sanity prevailed. 
North Korea gambled on the 
assumption that the United 
States would not conceivably 
retaliate with the use of even 
small tactical nuclear weap-
ons. The Koreans surely as-
sumed that the issue before 
the U.S. National Security 
Council would be whether to 
take military steps that might 
cause the reopening of the Ko-
rean conflict and involve an-
other million or so American 
boys in a ground war in Asia. 
The North Korean belief, 
shared by some Americans, 
was that U.S. public opinion 
would not support involvement 
in another Asian war. And, af-
ter our recent drastic steps to 
bolster the dollar, the Commu-
nists probably assumed that 
the U.S. economy would not 
support a second war. 
The North Koreans also 
could assume that U.S. policy-
makers would have to consid-
er the likelihood that the 
Chinese would become rein-
volved in any renewed war-
fare in Korea. 
And that is why little North 
Korea would dare to challenge 
the world's most powerful 
country. 
It lllustrates anew a point

The Pueblo 
SIR: I am doncerned, as are other Americans, about 
the Pueblo incident. I am relieved that President John-

It would he unwise to take direct military action at this 
'time due to our "hawkish" commitment in Vietnam. 
We should first find out the facts of this dilemma.

son stands on diplomacy and does not seek a military 
solution.

SIR: Do you "Remember the Maine?" Or is that too 
far back for you? 
You will remember that the twin rabble-rousers, 
William R. Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, stampeded this 
nation into what Senator McCarthy recently called on 
TV "an unjust war." We know now 70 years later that it 
was then an unjust war but at the time we were told that 
the Spaniards had sunk the "Maine" even while it was 
known at the State Department and the White House of 
those days that the "Maine" was in Havana harbor 
against the wishes and protest of the Spanish authori-
ties. The truth about the "Maine" was known 50 years 
later, but it was known in the State Department in 1898. 
Possibly we will have to wait to the year 2000 before 
the facts about the "Pueblo" are known. Let us remem-
ber, however, that the risks are a thousand times more 
serious than those of the Spanish-American War. Let us 
keep our shirts on about the "Pueblo" as we did not 
about the "Maine."

for overkill possessed by both 
the United Stales and the So-

It forces sober reflection 
where angry, hasty reaction

about such installations' on their soil. 
Some of them allow so few foreign

men, that it's a problem keeping the 
plants operating round the clock. 
"The navy has. always � � at least 
until last. week. � enjoyed a par-
ticular advantage. It could slip up 
close to a country 'that was being ob-
served without breaking 'international 
law, and sit there for almost indefinite 
periods, listening in on traffic, locating 
radar sites and 'gathering information

In military terms, jamming is an ace 
to be used sparingly, because it im-
mediately indicates to the other side 
that something big is in the wind, like 
shooting. � A 
There are supposed to be about a 
dozen intelligence-type ships like the 
Pueblo in the Navy, and perhaps a 
slightly larger number of oceanogra-
phic vessels with an intelligence capa-
bility. Moreover, the combat vessels of 
the Navy have wide varieties of snoop-
ing capability. � 
Last year the unfortunate USS 
Liberty sailed too close to the Arab-
Israeli war' and got badly shot up by 
Israeli jets, losing 34 men killed and 
at least 75 wounded. The curious thing 
about the Liberty incident is that the 
Joint Chiefs had become worried that 
she was sailing too close to the combat 
zone and sent a message ordering her 
to move away, but somehow the mes-
sage was not received. . 
At least the Pentagon has emerged 
to some extent from its age of inno-
cense in that it has acknowledged what 
ships like the Pueblo are up to.. One 
naval spokesman observed that "in-
telligence collection by naval vessels 
is a routine activity among major � 
powers." That's a great advance over 
the laughable cover story first put out 
about the Liberty: that she was mean-
dering around those waters using the 
moon as a passive reflector in com-
munications. Or the first one in 1980. 
about the U-2, that it was a NASA 
weather plane that had unaccountably 
gone astray. 
On the other side of the fence, 
the Russian i have shown an 
energy and ingenuity in maritime 
snooping that no other nation can 
match. In fact, U.S. Navy experts con-
stantly remind Congress of the march 
the Soviets are stealing on the West-
ern navies. 
There are reports, for example, that 
at least half a dozen Soviet electronic 
spy ships are prowling up and down 
the U.S. East Coast. They are supposed 
to be part of a force of over 40 such 
vessels, a number of them in the Med- � 
iterranean and the eastern Atlantic.' 
There are also literally hundreds'of 
auperbly equipped� trawlers roaming 
the oceans. They catch a lot of fish and 
process them on the high seas with 
packing and refrigerating' equipment 
that is the envy of other nations. But 
they also funnel back to Moscow a. 
mosaic of maritime information, not 
all of it strictly military but including 
esoteric oceanographic data about the 
seas around Western countries. ' 
The purely snooping ships are called 
AGI, or Auxiliary General Intelligence. 
They can be up to 200 feet long and 
equipped with the most up to date 
radio and ridar equipment. Sometimes 
these ships sail right in between Amer-
ican and other NATO country ships 
In maneuvers in the Atlantic or the 
lIdediterranean, coming so close that 
they are a hazard. Some years ago', a 
Soviet trawler moved in to photograph 
the submarine George Washington ,60 
miles north of Long Island, when. it 
was firing dummy Polaris missiles, and 
almost collided with a Navy tdg.

Jan. 23 � North Vietnamese 
troops moved closer to the 
U.S. Marine base here Tues. 
day as Marines worked to im. 
prove their defenses and jets 
and artillery pounded the sur-
rounding hills. ' 
Col. David E. Lownds, com-

increased c'the .pressure on his 
base-piritheter since the bat-
tle began three days ago. � 
� can't conclude anything

asked if he believes the North 
Vietnamese are planning to at-
tack the base that spills on the 
red dirt of this small highland' 
plain around its lifeline � a 
4006-foot airstrip,

strength the division would 
have about .11,000 men. There 
are more than 5600 . Marines 
here and new Marine units ar-
rived Tuesday. 
Marine reconnaissance pa-
trols have sighted. or made 
:ontact with the enemy on all 
ddes of this base. An aerial 
)bserver said that enemy sol-
diers were "walking all over 
the hills Sunday and'Monday." 
Now, he added, "they are get-
ting harder"to spot?' . 
[Marine. patrols probing the 
hills around Khesanh killed 
61 Communist troops Tuesday 
without suffering any casual-
ties themselves, the U.S. Com-
mand said in Saigon.] 
For the third straight day 
an American jet was shot 
down from the hills. Marine 
Maj. William E. Loftus, 31, of 
Chicago was hit as he made 
his fourth run over the ridge 
line--2000. yards north of the 
base. 
"My motor was surging, run-
ning rough," at the time he 
pulled out of his strafing run, 
Loftus said. 
He said he saw holes in his 
left wing and fuselage and 
tried to turn his A-4E Sky-
hawk for a landing on the air-
strip. Unable to make the 
turn,. Loftus ejected over the

passed the word to lndias 
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi 
that Cambodia's head of state, 
Norodom Sihanouk, does not 
want the International Control 
Commission expanded to super-
vise the borders of Cambodia 
and South Vietnam. 
Marshal Tito was giving his 
assessment of the situation in 
Cambodia and talks he had 
with Sihanouk there. Tito told 
Mrs. Gandhi Cambodia wants 
to keep out of the war and that 
Sihanouk publicty asked for the 
effective functioning of the con-
trel commission only to deter 
Arherican forces from exercis-
ing the right to hot pursuit. 
' Requested Expansion 
After the Bowles mission two 
weeks ago Sihanouk agreed to 
ask for, the expansion of the 
commission in return for Amer-
ican assurances to respect the 
territorial integrity of Cambo-
dia. 
Sihanouk feared that if the 
American forces were to cross 
the Cambodian borders the 
pro-Chinese elements in Cambo-
dia would ask for Chinese inter-
vention. Tito reported. There 
was fear that Giet Cong forces 
might also try to embroil Cam-
bodia in the war he added. 
Sources close to the talks 
added Tito said that in Phnom 
Penh it is admitted that Viet 
Cong use Cambodia as a sanc-
tuary but the number is. small.

RADIATION FOUND 
WHERE 1-52 FELL 
_ . . 
By JOHN W. FINNEY 
Sp�cial to The New York 7:mrs 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23�Air 
Force search teams were re-
ported today to have detected 
small amounts of radiation 
from some or all of the four 
hydrogen bombs missing after 
a B-52 bomber crashed on the 
ice off northwest Greenland. 
After two days of hunting 
with dog sleds and helicopters, 
teams from the Thule Air 
Force Base in Greenland still 
had not found the unarmed 
thermonuclear weapons. But 
the detection of the radiation 
was taken as an encouraging 
sign that the bombs were 
scattered across the surface 
and had not plunged through 
the ice with parts of the bomber 
into about BOO feet of water. 
If the bombs are still on 
the surface, recovery opera-
tions will be easier. It was 
first thought that the bombs 
had sunk to the bottom of 
North Star Bay, about seven 
miles southwest of the Thule 
base, raising the problem of 
underwater recovery opera-
tions through the sea ice. 
The radiation suggested that 
some of the bombs might have 
broken apart in the impact 
of the crash and during the 
subsequent explosion in the 
bomber as it careened several 
hundred feet across the ice. If 
the bombs have split and 
spilled fissionable materials, 
this could present radiological 
health problems in cleaning up 
the radioactive debris from the 
explosion. 
The radiation detected was 
that of alpha rays, given oft 
by plutonium, a fassionable ma-
terial used along with enriched 
uranium in the trigger of a by. 
drogen bomb. 
If ingested or inhaled, phi. 
tonium is highly toxic. But ir 
the uninhabited stretches oi 
northwest Greenland, the Or 
tonium is not expected to pre-
sent a particular health haz-
ard.

tine airborne-alert flight from

Johnson discussed the seizure 
at his regular Tuesday strategy 
luncheon with Secretary Mc-

other senior officials. 
The Joint Chiefs also held a 
special meeting on the incident. 
Military sources said the four 
North. Korean patrol craft that 
surrounded the Pueblo were So-

with four 25-sum, automatic 
antiaircraft guns. 
The North Korean craft�one 
conventional patrol boat and 
three other raft of motor tor-

speeds of 23 to 40 knots, while 
the Pueblo had a top speed of 
12.5 knots. 
According to the Defense De-

The Pueblo had been in the

the officials said. They added 
that other American Mtelli-

This, with the manner- in 
which the Pueblo was seized,

Digging Deeper 
Although several Marine 
battalions are operating in the 
hills between Kbesarth anti the 
Laos border seven miles to the 
west, the emiihasis here at the 
base is on defensive prepara-
tions. 
"I tell the kids to dig a foot 
a day at least," Lownds said. 
"If the enemy doesn't attack 
for two more weeks I'll prob-
ably have three more strands 
of wire around us, but if 
you're asking am 1 ready, the 
answer is yes." � 
Enemy forces have isolated 
the base from Khesanh village 
four miles southwest and from 
the Special Fortes camp at 
Laungvei. Three mixed Marine 
and South Vietnamese Civil 
Action platoons were evacu-
ated from around Khesanh vil-
lage Monday and civilians who 
wanted to escape were flown 
out after making their own 
way from the village to the 
base. 
The evacuation served two 
military purposes, in addition 
to giving the civilians a way 
out of what promises to be 
heavy fighting. Allied 'forces 
were weak in the village and 
it was not considered defensi-
ble without reinforcement. 
Also. many of the shells fired 
at this base Sunday came 
front within the village. 
Artillery Used 
In addition to rockets and 
mortars, the enemy used artil-
lery against this base Sunday, 
according to many Marines 
here. Officially, the U.S. Com-
mand does not report that the 
enemy has artillery it can 
bring to bear on the base. 
The Sunday attack blew 
down many of the flimsy, tin-
roofed buildings. Digging 
deeper bunkers and sand-bag-
ging the walls of the buildings 
has become a major occupa-
tion, but much remains ex-
posed and ramshackle. 
Perhaps only Dakto is a 
worse battleground for Ameri-
can troops in Vietnam than 
Khesanh. The steep slopes are 
alternately covered with heavy 
forest and waist-high grass. 
Khesanh is isolated from 
other Marine posts and de-
pends entirely on planes for 
its -ammunition and other sup-
plies.-
At this time of year, the 
clouds close on the hilltops in 
late afternoon and the mist 
never lifts before Midmorning. 
On. bad days, the plain is cov-
ered with fog and drizzle that 
makes all air operations im-
eossible. 
Col. Lownds has orders to 
"defend the combat base and 
its ancillary facilities and 
check infiltration." Khesanh 
was originally established by

The battle shaping up here is 
the first major action in this 
at.ea since the battle for Hills 
cii and 881. from April 24 to 
May 5 lost year. 
In that biotic. the Marines 
suffered Intl dead and 297 
wounded cc hilt' reporting 554 
enemy dead by body count 
and a potable kill of more 
than twice that figure. 
Marine commanders were 
criticized in some quarters for 
their tactics in ordering 
charges up those hills. In a 
war where real estate is often 
gained only to he given up. 
critics asked, why charge a 
well-prepared enemy who 
holds the tops of hills? 
The same question was 
asked after the bloody battle 
of the 173d Airborne on Hill 
075 at Dakto last Thanksgiv-
ing. 
Marines, however, have held 
on to the crest of 861 and the 
southern of the two 881 hills 
(the names designate the 
height of the hills in meters.) 
It was the Marine unit on 861 
that repulsed the most serious 
enemy probe of the present 
campaign. Around Khesanh, 
however, 861 and the 881s are 
three among many hills. 
News agencies reported 
these other developments: 
� About 200 South Viet-
namese militiamen and a num-
ber of civilians evacuated the 
former district capita] of 
Huonghoa, the second town 
whose garrison has been 
pulled back in the Khesanh 
area. The militia moved into 
the Special Forces camp at 
Langvei. 
In three days of Communist. 
attack on Huonghoa, about 
three miles from the Khesanh 
base, 18 South Vietnamese 
were killed. But Huonghoa's 
defenders claimed their fire 
and supporting air strikes 
killed 250 Comrnunist soldiers. 
� More than 300 troops of 
the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division 
(Airmobile1 moved north to 
the Hue-Phubal area, from 
which they can be airlifted by 
helicopter to Khesanh if 
needed. They are the first U.S. 
Army troops to be posted 
north of the Marine base at 
Danang. 
� Farther south, other ele-
ments of the 1st Cavalry mak-
ing a sweep of the coastal 
plains caught a Vietcong 
force in the open Tuesday 
and killed 128. Four Ameri-
cans were killed, a U.S. mili-
tary spokesman said. 
� In Saigon, the South Viet-. 
namese government said thati 
allied forces last week killed 
1842 Communist soldiers, a 
drop from the 2216 Communist 
dead reported the previous 
week. South Vietnamese losses 
were put at 223 killed, 750 
wounded and 71 missing or 
captured. 
� The American. pacifist 
told the American Ambassador 
what Sihanouk wants of the 
Americans. The source added 
that Tito explained the Cam-
bodia stand and unwillingness 
to get embroiled in the war. 
Tito maintained with Mrs. 
Gandhi that Americans are the 
aggressors in Indo-China and 
they should leave and allow the 
Vietnamese to decide their own 
fate. Both leaders considered 
the recent Hanoi statement on 
talks as a "positive gesture," 
official sources said. 
India's Stand 
Mrs. Gandhi explained India's 
stand on the request made by 
Cambodia for the effective func-
tioning of the International Con-
trol Commission. She is reported 
to have turned down the United 
States offer of helicopters, as 
America is not a signatory to 
the 1954 Geneva Agreement on 
Cambodia. 
She indicated to Tito � that 
India will support investigation 
of any specific complaint lodged 
by Cambodia. The International 
Control Commission will accept 
help from signatories like Cam-
bodia for expeditious investi-
gations into the complaints, 
sources dose to the talks said. 
The sources said Sihanouk 
feared that if an expanded con-
trol commission were to estab-
lish that Communist forces do, 
indeed, take sanctuary in Cam-
bodia, then Americans would 
immediately assert their rights 
of hot pursuit.

BY RONALD KOTULAK 
The United States may be 
abandoning scientific explora-
tion of the planets to the 
Russians, D r. William H. 
Pickering, director of the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasa-
dena, Cal., said yesterday. 
Congressional cutbacks i n 
space spending have almost 
eliminated America's planetang 
space missions, said DA 
Pickering, whose laboratory 
planned and developed the 
Mariner, Ranger, and Surveyor 
planetary and moon missions. 
Russian Studies Continue 
. While the United States has 
sidetracked planetary missions, 
the Russians have given every 
indication that they will keep 
up their heavy commitment to 
explore the solar system, Dr. 
Pickering said at a press 
conference at the Illinois Insti-
tute of Technology. 
Dr. Pickering, who is attend-
ing the third annual national 
conference on industrial re-
search, was honored as "Man 
of the Year" by Industrial 
Research magazine. He re-
ceived a plaque and $1,000. 
"The United States has su-
periority in space exploration 
but the Congressional cutbacks 
may enable the Russians to get 
well ahead of us," �Picker-
ing said. 
Because of the Vidt Nam war 
and other federal programs the 
National Aeronautics and Space 
administration budget has been 
trimmed by nearly one billion 
dollars to 4.5 billion this fiscal 
year. The budget cuts affected 
the planetary exploration pro-
grams the most. 
Surveyor 7, which recently 
made a soft-landing on the 
moon, is the last of the 
unmanned lunar missions. Con-
gress eliminated from the 
fiscal 1968 budget 71 million

Washington�Jan. 23�A sharp 
� increase in the scope and 
intensity of North Korean mili-
tary activities and armed at-
� tacks has bean overshadowed 
� by the fighting in Viet Nam. 
I But the increase in the tempo 
, of communist activities in 
Korea has American officials 
worried. Altho a -second front" 
seems unlikely. a growth in 
infiltration and guerrilla activi-
ty in Korea could have reper-
cussions in Viet Nam. where 
the second largest foreign force 
compared to the United States 
is the 40,000 South Korean 
� troops. 
Capped by the alleged assas-
sination mission of 31 armed 
North Korean infiltrators into 
Seoul Sunday night. the Korean 
truce violations by the Com-
munists have increased dra-
matically in the last year and 
have raised serious doubts 
about North Korea's continued 
willingness to keep peace and 
stability in the area.

The night raid Sunday, ac-
cording to a North Korean 
army officer who was captured. 
was to charge the presidential 
mansion in Seoul and kill the 
South Korean president, Gen. 
Chung Hoe Park. 
The incidents in Korea have 
increased as the communist 
attempts to win in Viet Nam 
have bogged down. In the first 
10 months of last year there. 
were 543 North Korean truce 
violations, compared to 50 in all 
of 1966. 
American officials said the 
incidents resulted from infiltra-
tion .into touth Korea from the 
north of armed teams for the 
purpose of setting ambushes, 
I laying mines, and raiding posi-

As North Vietnam denies the 
obvious � that its troops are

However, it is known that 
the major portion of the entire

To carry out these opera-

assembled a fleet of very fast

30 to 40 men with equipment.

North Korean infiltrators 
have also laid mines in the 
roads of the United Nations 
command in the south half of 
the zone and in one case 
atta'cked a U N. engineering

Korean agents blew up two 
U. N. barracks. 
Goldberg Raps Violations

65 Professors 
In Saigon Urge 
Peace Moves 
From News 
SAIGON, Jan. 23�Sixty-five 
South Vietnamese Professors 
called on "all the belligerent 
parties" today to extend the 
coming lunar new year cease-
fire and start peace negotia-
tions. 
"The present conflict is seri-
ously endangering the very ex-
istence of the Vietnamese peo-
ple from both material and 
moral standpoints," the profes-
sors said in a statement. 
"Therefore every Vietnamese 
has the duty to contribute to 
the finding of a suitable way 
out for his fatherland ... 
"The complex differences 
between the official positions 
require subtle solutions that 
can only be reached after long 
deliberations an d drawnout 
negotiations. , 
"In order to create a suit-
able atmosphere for such an 
open-hearted discussion be-
tween the belligerent parties, 
and above all to save thou-
sands of people from death 
and suffering while a peaceful 
settlement is being sought, we 
appeal to all the belligerent 
parties to extend indefinitely 
the Tot cease-fire and to ne-
gotiate immediately a peaceful 
settlement." 
The Tet standdown is sched-
uled to begin this weekend. 
The Vietcong say they will 
observe a seven-day cease-fire 
beginning Friday. 
The Allies 'nave announced 
they would observe a 36-hour 
cease-fire. This was originally 
scheduled to be 411 hours, hut 
a government spokesman said 
last weekend this had been re-
duced because Saigon had 
learned the enemy would take 
advantage of the period to 
carry out supply missions. 
The professors, most of 
whom are from the govern-
ment-run University of Saigon, 
made no direct mention of the 
National Liberation Front in 
their statement. The NU' is 
the political arm of the Viet-
cong and the South Viet-
namese government has stated. 
repeatedly that it will not rec-
ognize It. 
But the professors' appeal 
was directed to "all Viet-
namese who have the responsi. 
bility in this land not to for-
feit this precious opportunity 
. . to sit together, to recog-
nize one another as Viet-
namese in order to find a for-
mula for peace based on the 
supreme interest of the na-
tion." 
On Jan. 10, a group of about 
a dozen South Vietnamese in-
tellectuals released a six-paget 
proposal calling for "the unifl-' 
Dispa to hes � 
cation of the National Libera-
tion front and the Republic of 
Vietnam." Apparently fearful 
of government reprh;als, the 
drafters issued their statement 
anonymously. 
South Vietnam's* 17 Roman 
Catholic bishops have also is-
sued a call for a start in nego-
tiating an end to the war. The 
bishops said the Americans 
should stop bombing North 
Vietnam and that the North 
Vietnamese should stop infil-
trating South Vietnam. 
On the other side of the 
issue, a group of 300 Roman 
Catholic refugees who fled 
from North Vietnam more 
than a decade ago urged the 
Saigon government to reject 
any peace solutions initiated 
by the United States. They 
vowed to fight against any 
government coalition that in-
cluded Communists.

INDIA TO BUILD 
ATOM PLANTS 
WITHOUT AID 
By ADAM CLYMER 
ICJ., Della Butenu 01 Tile Sun) 
Tarapur, India, Jan. 23�India 
intends to build future nuclear 
power stations without foreign 
aid and thus avoid inspection 
requirements, a senior official 
said today. 
Monindra N. Chakravarti, ad-
ministrator of the Tarapir 
atomic power project which is 
to go into operation late this 
year, said the next project to 
be started would be constructed 
without foreign assistance, with 
India dipping into its own tight 
foreign exchange reserves for 
necessary imports. 
That project, involving two 
200-megawatt reactors at Kal-
pakkam in Madras state, is 
only beginning, with civil engi-
neering work undertaken but no 
financing budgeted. 
Second-Class Status 
Chakarvarti's statement came 
as New Delhi continued to re-
fuse comment on the draft nu-
clear non-proliferation treaty 
produced last week in Geneva 
by the United States and the 
Soviet Union. Indian spokesmen 
have complained in the past 
that the Soviet-American ap-
proach to inspections relegates 
other nations to second-class 
status without promising effec-
tive nuclear disarmament. 
According to a Reuters report 
from Bonn, Chancellor Kurt 
Georg Kiesinger said today the 
West German Government could 
not accept the United States-
Soviet draft treaty. 
[Improvements introduced at 
Geneva were not sufficient, Keis-
nger said, but West Germany 
hoped that an acceptable text 
could emerge from the present 
draft.) 
The pact is expected to be a 
major topic of conversation tot-
er this week when Soviet Pre-
mier Alexei N. Kosygin meets 
with Prime Minister Indira 
Gandhi in New Delhi. Kosygin 
is scheduled to arrive in New 
Delhi Thursday for a visit of 
five or six days. 
Chakravarti, an enthusiastic 
64-year-old administrator, noted 
that inspection of this project, 
India's first, is to be conducted 
by the International Atomic 
Agency, although India has 
limited the nations from which 
inspectors may come. 
Second Project Under Way 
A second nuclear power pro-
ject, under way with Canadian 
help in Rajasthan state and 
scheduled to go into operation 
by 1971, is also subject to an 
inspection agreement. That pact 
involves strictly Canadian sup-
ervision.

DISORDER TERMED 
KOREAN REDS' AIM 
Piccione Tee New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 � 
The North Korean Government 
has been calling on world Com-
munists to create diversionary 
problems that would turn Unit-
ed States energies away from 
the war effort in Vietnam. 
Figures made upublic by the 
State Department today in-
dicated how this policy had 
been carried out by the regime 
in Pyongyang, the North Korean 
capital: 
In 1967, nearly 600 incidents 
of violence, assaults and terror 
were reported across the armis-
tice line between North and 
South,Korea. The year before, 
when North Korea had not 
yet adopted the policy of di-
versionary tactics, the number 
of incidents was 50. 
Inflitration into South Korea 
of armed agents by land and 
by sea has been causing mount-
ing concern here. Measures to 
defend South Korea were 
understood to have been dis-
cussed by President Johnson

munists. 
When Mao Tae-tung's Cul-
tural Revolution took hold ity 
China, the North Korean party 
was one of the earliest to de-
nounce Peking's policy. 
Meanwhile, the Soviet leader-
ship pursued a policy of court-
ing North Korea, sending high-
level trade and party delega-
tions to Pyongyang. 
A trade . accord signed in 
Moscow in October last year 
provided for a "considerable 
increase" in Soviet assistance 
for the construction of fac-
tories and industrial complexes 
in North Korea. 
On policy toward the United 
States, however, the North Ko-
reans spoke far more militantly 
than the Russians, adopting the 
rhetoric of Cuba. 
A recent statement of this 
attitude was given by Premier 
Kim 11 Sung of North Korea 
Dec. 16: 
"All the Socialist countries 
and anti-imperialists forces of 
the whole world should form 
the broadest possible anti-
American united from!, should 
thoroughly isolate United States 
imperialism and administer col-
lective blows to it in all regions 
and on all fronts to which 
United States imperialism 
stretches its tentacles of ag-
gression," he said. 
The emphasis on a "united 
front" in North Korea's policy 
separates that regime from the 
Chinese Communists, who 
scorn the notion of unity, but 
the militancy is far in excess 
of what the Soviet and Euro-
pean Communist regimes pro-
claim, in the view of United 
States analysts here.

24 JANUARY 1968 
A DIRECT CHALLENGE 
FROM THE REDS 
Seizure early yesterday by North 
Korean communist patrol vessels covered 
by MIG fighters of a lightly armed United 
States intelligence ship in international 
waters is an act of piracy and. in ordinary 
times, would amount to an act of war. 
The U. S. S. Pueblo, carrying only two 
.50 caliber Machine guns. surrendered 
without firing and was escorted into the 
Red port of Wonsan. 
The United States says that the vessel, 
with a crew of 83, was 20 miles offshore. 
The communist account is that it was in 
North Korean waters, bent on provoca-
tion. The Reds imply that it was on some 
mission related to the invasion of the 
South Korean capital of Seoul by 31 North 
Korean terrorists, disguised as South 
Korean civilians and soldiers. The group 
killed a Seoul police official and six 
civilians before it fled, leaving six infil-
trators dead and one a prisoner: The 
prisoner said that the team hoped to kill 
President Chung Hee Park and some of 
his colleagues. 
No American vessel had been seized or 
the high seas for more than 100 years 
before the present incident. Two questions 
arise. The first is what the United States 
government intends to do about it and 
what forcible action it intends to take to 
regain the ship and its crew. Supposediy 
the usual, "stiff protest" is being formu-
lated, and the good offices, if any, of the 
Soviet Union are being invoked, inasmuch 
as the United States has no diplomatic 
relations with communist North Korea. 
It is predictable that neither course will 
be fruitful. Then what? Given the spine-
lessness of successive administrations 
since the days of President Truman in 
dealing with Korea, little, if any, effective 
action would seem in the making. The 
\hilted States will have suffered humilia-
tkm at the hands of a country it could 
Squash like a bug. 
The second question is whether this out-
imeous communist act portends a major 
goread of hostilities on the Asiatic main-
land. The United States is deeply corn-
Iiitted in Viet Nam, where half a million 
ground troops are in a protracted war with 
the North Vietnamese Communists. The 
provocation from North Korea comes at a 
time when our forces are stretched this. 
If North Korea and Red China are con-
templating some kind of pincers operation 
which would require us to resume fighting 
in Korea while we are tied down in Viet 
Nam, the squeeze would be on us. The 
purpose of such an adventure would be to 
relieve pressure on North Viet Nam and 
the Viet Cong guerrillas. The gamble 
could be taken only on a communist 
assumption that our government's rec-
ord of pusillanimity in dealing with the 
Korean Communists would guarantee an-
other round of what Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur called 'the "stalemated attri-
tion" of the Korean war of 1950-53. 
The indecisiveness of Washington 15 and 
more years ago is still catching up with 
on. and the ungainly chickens of that 
fainthearted policy are coming home to 
roost. We relied then, as our government 
hopes to do now with North Viet Nam, on 
the formula of "negotiations." White we 
were tied down at the conference table 
with the North Korean Reds, two-thirds of 
our total casualties in the Korean war 
were incurred. 
We settled at length for an "armistice" 
which has never produced a peace and has 
led to innumerable communist violations 
on almost every day since. Must we now 
be forced to learn all over what Mac-
Arthur knew no well�that "there t. no 
substitute for victory"? He prophosied 
that "by meeting naked force with 
appeasement we would not only perpetrate

WASHINGTON POST 
24 JANUARY 1968 
A Challenge to Candor . . . 
The naval kidnaping of the USS Pueblo by four 
North Korean torpedo boats is almost too bizarre 
to be believed. We know that it was engaged in so. 
phisticated electronic espionage, close to the North 
Korean coast, but in international waters, according 
to the United Stales account. But we don't know 
why it was unescorted, and under-armed, or why, 
even so, it did not even try to resist. Above all, we 
don't know why the North Koreans picked this 
moment for so provocative a piece of brigandage. 
Not knowing these things, the soundest course 
is probably not to leap to conclusions, especially 
when we also don't know what efforts are being 
niade to extricate the vessel and its 83-man crew. 
The Administration is entitled to a decent interval 
even when the outward evidence points to bungling 
on a major scale. 
That much said, the Administration must realize 
that public tolerance in this country for the unex-
plained and the Inexplicable Is wearing thin, as 
is public patience with the growing evidence of a 
rising challenge to our security interests through-
out the Asian world. A public which � was lied to 
over the U-2, confused, if nothing else, by the 
Tonkin Gulf, and misled, to say the least, in the 
affair of another intelligence ship attacked by the 
Israelis last year, cannot be satisfied or reassured 
by the same old cOverups. 
This is all the more imperative, given the impact 
this incident is likely to have on nerves already 
frayed and positions already hardening. Those who 
see this country as over-extended In Asia, and 
around the world, will find further argument for 
withdrawal and retrenchment from confrontation 
with communism. Those who see in our policies 
of limited war a humiliation and a senseless In-
hibition will find further argument for a harder 
line and stiffer measures all across the board. 
Already there is evidence of these tendencies 
in reaction to the seizure of the Pueblo. While 
some Senators cried out against a virtual act of 
war, others claimed vindication of their view that 
we are over-extended in a world policeman's role. 
As Communist pressures continue to 'pile up in 
Vietnam along the highlands and across the Demili-
tarized Zone, in neighboring Laos, and in Thai-
land, a new Korean crisis can only operate to accen-
tuate the extremes. 
It is important to keep our cool until we know 
more. But this makes it no less important that we 
be told more�and more that is believable�alout 
so bizarre and unbelievable an incident. 
NEW YORK TIMES 
24 JANUARY 1968 
The Pueblo Incident 
Remembering the Gulf of Tonkin, Americans would 
be wise to keep cool and not leap to conclusions�as 
some members of Congress have already done�about 
the North Korean capture of the American naval intelli-
gence ship Pueblo yesterday. 
Whatever the facts may prove to be, the incident 
does present, as the White House has observed, "a 
very serious situation." Such a situation must not be 
dealt with in passion, for it could lead to a sharp and 
dangerous new escalation of the Asian war. 
If the ship was taken on the high seas, as American 
spokesmen assert, and not inside North Korean terri-
torial waters, an act of piracy has been committed for 
which there must be prompt restitution. The State 
Department has moved expeditiously and properly to 
seek such restitution through diplomatic channels. 
The search for satisfaction by diplomatic means must 
be pursued to the limit. 
But if the American vessel did penetrate Northi 
Korean waters�as American ships were tardily 
acknowledged to have penetrated waters claimed by 
North Vietnam prior to the Tonkin incidents--the 
United States Government must bear at least a share 
of the responsibility for what has happened. The Con-
gress and the public ought to be sure of their facts 
before they judge. 
In any case, somebody needs to explain to the 
American people why a lightly armed vessel, presuma-
bly crammed with sensitive intelligence equipment, 
Was cruising unprotected in obviously hostile waters 
and, especially, why it was allowed to fall intact into 
hostile hands. 
WASHINGTON POST

... Against a Grim Background 
North Korea had been rumbling for months be-
fore its seizure of the USS Pueblo yesterday. Just 
a day earlier, a band of its soldiers was intercepted 
in Seoul. bound, apparently, to assassinate South 
Korea's President. Through 1967, raids across the 
Demilitarized Zone increased- sharply and Pyong-
yang began dispatching spy and guerrilla teams 
south to stir up trouble and test popular support. 
Behind this policy of provocation, it seems, is a 
marked shift left, an abandonment of North Korea's 
earlier willingness to hold the line and to count 
on time to ease American forces out of South Korea 
and create better prospects for "reunification." 
Perhaps North Korea was dismayed by economic 
progress in the South, or encouraged by political 
unrest there. Perhaps it figured to exploit Amer-
ican preoccupation with Vietnam, or to help Hanoi 
by cooking up a diversion. These disparate factors

The Road to De;escala 
Hanoi's harsh public response to President Johnson's 
stand on *peace talks does nothing to advance hope for 
a negotiated settlement-Aff,the Vietnam war. 
Judging by what ti-sr.fie'en. said publicly on both 
sides, rejection by North Vietnam of Washington's 
latest approach was predictable. In the President's 
San Antonio speech lastSeptember and in other-official 
. statements the Administration had..appeared to offer 
an unconditional bombircg.liitlt in return only for assur-
ances that such a move would lead 'promptly to pro-
ductive discussions." But then Mi. Johnson appeared 
to tighten his terms in-the State of. the Union address 
when he insisted the otlier side "must not take advan-
tage of our restraint as theihave in the past," adding: 
"This nation simply cannot accept anything less with-
nit jeopardizing the lives of our Men and our allies." 
There have been indications, however, that in private 
contacts with Hanoi, Washington's' position may not 
have been .so inflexible as it has, appeared in public. 
It has been reported in The Times Of London that the 
President privately is no longer insisting on some form 
.of de-escalation by North Vietnam, The British news-
paper's Washington correspondent says that the phrase 
"not take advantage" of a .bombing halt does not 
require the North Vietnamese to reduce their military 
infiltration but only that they not increase the level of 
men and supplies flowing into the South. In return, 
the United States reportedly has indicated a willing-
ness not to send reinforcements of its own to South 
Vietnam. 
� if this report truly reflects the American position as 
it has been conveyed by secret emissaries to North 
Vietnam, Hanoi's intransigent response supports the 
theory that the North Vietnamese are not really inter-
ested in peace talks at this time but are deliberately 
stalling until after the Presidential election in the 
United States�which would be a very foolish thing 
for them to do. 
Considering the record safar, there is something to 
be said for the recent charge by the Secretary General 
of the United Nations that both sides have been guilty 
. of "simplistic" demands in their approach to negotia-
tions. Mr. Thant repeated his long-standing plea that 
the United States, as the overwhelmingly superior 
power, take an essential first step by halting the bomb. 
ing unconditionally. By such forthright action could 
the Johnson Administration dispel worldwide doubt: 
about its aims and put Communist intentions to the test. 
WALL STREET JOURNAL

Republicans charged that the Johnson Ad. 
ministration has prolonged the Vietnam war by 
vacillation and lacks imagination to solve prob. 
lows of housing and jobs at home. The accusa-
tions came from eight Senators-and nine Con-
gressmen in an hour-long reply on CBS to Pres-
ident Johnson's State of the Union Message. 
Former President Eisenhower, introducing the 
speakers, said new directions "are required to 
preserve and strengthen our tree system.' 
WASHINGTON STAR 
23 JANUARY 1968 (24) 
Hanoi's Answer 
The President, In his State of the 
Union address Wednesday night, took a 
somewhat harder line in � discussing 
peace talks in Vietnam. He gave this 
version of the San Antonio formula, 
stated last September: (1) The bombing 
would stop If talks would take place 
promptly and with reasonable hopes 
they would be productive. (2) And the 
other side "must not" take advantage of 
our restraint as they have in the past. 
.. What the President said Wednesday 
,night, however, was not quite the same 
thing he said in San Antonio last Sep-
tember � and this remains true despite 
adrainistration contentions to the con-
trary. The second point set forth in San 
Antonio was that "we would assume" 
that Hanoi would not take advantage 
of the bombing halt. There obviously is 
a difference between that and saying 
that Hanoi 'must not" take such ad-
vantage. 
Senator Robert Kennedy evidently 
thinks so. for he said, after the Presi-
dent's speech: "We have said publicly 
that we want negotiations but when we 
set the conditions we are asking for un-
conditional surrender." This, of course, 
Is" wild exaggeration if it was a refer-
ence to the tic) presidential soeeches. 
For, while there was a difference be-
tween what Mr. Johnson said in Septem-
ber and what he said in January; neith-
er of these speeches, nor any other 
statement of his, can fairly be classed 
as a call for unconditional surrender. 
The latest word from Hanoi, how-
ever, seems to make any debate over 
what the President said or did not say 
largely academic. An article in Nhan 
Dan, the official North Vietnamese 
newspaper, elected to treat the Wednes-
day night statement as a reiteration of 
the San Antonio formula. Even so, the 
State of the Union comment was reject-
ed out of hand is an "habitual trick" 
loaded with "insolent conditions." So 
why should anyone hope for meaningful 
negotiations, despite the December 29 
statement that there "will" be talks if 
the bombing and all.other acts of war 
against North Vietnam are halted? 
Incidentally, a very strange footnote 
was appended to the Nhan Dan article. 
It said that 365,000 allied troops had 
been "Wiped out" in 1967. Hanoi certain-
ly knows that this Is untrue. So why 
publish the statement? Is morale in 
North Vietnam so bad that it has to be 
reinforced by invention of the .Most ex-
travagant sort? �

still divided between the Red north and the civilized south, 
and a lot of U.S. troops tied down in the south to deter 
another invasion from the north. 
Korean Now, northern Reds have sneaked Into 
Seoul, South Korea's capital, intent on mur-
Flareup 
dering President Park Chung Lee (though 
they didn't succeed); and a U.S. patrol boat has been 
grabbed by North Korean patrol vessels in the Sea of Japan. 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk calls the latter incident 
"a matter of utmost gravity," while Sen. Richard B. Russell 
(D-Ga.) says it amounted to an act of war. 
Thus festers the, open sore from which we suffer in 
Korea, where we neglected to win a war we could have 
won. Do we want to contract another suet' Asian sore by 
neglecting to win the Vietnam war?

Vietnamese Scandal 
Alyem York Times dispatch from Saigon 
gives some significant and little-knrovn facts 
about education in Vietnam, a subject that 
undoubtedly is downgraded in the face of more 
sensational events. But of all South Vietnam's 
unsolved social problems, none is likely to have 
more serious consequences than the failure of 
the South Vietnamese to educate their own 
people. 
This is the view of many informed Viet-
namese and Americans, and needless to say 
it does not conform to the rosy official line. 
It is believed that the children of the rural 
and urban poor, possibly 90 per cent of the 
population, now have less chance than ever 
before, of getting an adequate education�and 
there is nothing a Vietnamese parent wants 
snore for his children than education. 
One can easily excuse this scandalous state 
of affairs by saying that education is one of 
the casualties of war. But is it? In the insecure 
countryside the Viet Cong guerrillas are earn-
ing the gratitude of the peasants by making a 
serious effort to teach children to read and 
write. And are they at the -same time indoc-
trinating them in the principles of the class 
struggle? Of course, and in the long run it 
will pay the Viet Gong well. 
It may be conceded that the Saigon regime 
has its problems. Teachers have been mur-
dered or frightened away by the guerrillas. 
But even in secure areas not enough is done. 
It is said there are no classrooms for 70,000 
elementary school pupils in Saigon itself. Only 
about half of Vietnamese children are even 
. enrolled in the first grade, and of these only 
about a third complete the first three grades: 
one in 200 completes the equivalent of high 
school. 
The truth appears to be that the Saigon re-
gime does not really want to improve the situa-
tion. The rich do not pay their taxes so there 
is little money for education. The regime con-
tinues to conscript teachers on the plea of 
manpower needs, while tens of thousands of 
young men whose .parents are well-to-do con-
tinue to evade the draft. Replacement teachers 
are in many cases inadequately trained women. 
The United States is spending 20 million dollars 
annually to help�building classrooms that in 
10 per cent of the cases remain empty because 
there are no teachers and printing textbooks 
that pile up in warehouses. 
The penalty of this shocking situation will 
come in the next few years, when the battered 
Vietnamese people try to pull themselves to-
gether. Will the Communists emerge as the 
educated and hence the ruling class? This may 
be the reward of their foresightedness, and the 
penalty of Saigon's venality. 
Missing Megatonage 
SoME of our bombs are missing. 
This tinie maybe four, maybe more, 
apparently are beneath the frigid wa-
ters of North Star Bay near the Thule 
Base in Greenland. They disappeared 
when the B-52 bomber that was car-
rying them cracked up. 
The Defense Department again an-
nuances that the frightfully powerful 
hydrogen bombs were unarmed -so 
there is no danger of a nuclear explo-
sion at the crash site." 
We heard approximately the same 
thing when another bomber accident off 
Spain dumped one of these mass killers 
into the sea. Then the Pentagon couldn't 
do enough quickly enough to find and 
salvage it � maybe from the Russians. 
That accident off Spain cost millions 
of dollars in salvage expense, and in 
damages of farmers in the area. 
It is fervently to be hoped that in the 
new case there actually is no danger 
from this threatening megatonage un-
der the sea. - 
As long as our bombers, carrying hy-
drogen weapons, must continue to pa-
trol the skies as part of our defense 
again.d sneak attack, such accidents as 
those off Spain and over Greenland can 
be expected. That's'.a price we pay for 
our national security.. 
Aral yet, as we pay the pride and take 
the risk, can anyone help but pray for 
the day then nuclear weapons every-
where shall be prohibited and peace, 
without patrolling bombers, reigns on 
this earth?

WASHINGTON NEWS 
23 JANUARY 1968 (24) 
Blowing It 
in Cambodia 
WASHINGTON STAR 
23 JANUARY 1968 ( 24) 
Toward Nuclear Sanity 
A SCANT two weeks ago Prince Si-
hanouk and U.S. envoy Chester Bowles 
solemnly pledged to. renew efforts to 
keep the flames of scar out of Cambo-
dia. Mr. Bowles said the U.S. had "no 
desire or intention- to violate 
Cambodian territory and would "do ev-
erything possible" to avoid intrusions. 
Sihanouk said he would prevent "all" 
violations, privately translated as com-
munist violations. 
Then the backsliding began. Because 
Russia growled at him, Sihanouk back-
tracked on his pledge to seek the 
strenghtening of the International Con-
trol Commission that is charged with 
spotting incursions. And Sihanouk's 
propaganda apparatus resumed hailing 
Cambodia's support to "the Vietnamese 
people's struggle against C.S. imperial-
ism." 
Meanwhile, U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State William P. Bundy was interp-
reting the "agreement" as permitting 
-the right of self-defense," which by 
any other name would be "hot pursuit" 
of communist forces by American 
troops over the border. 
"If the other side creates a situation 
where our self-defense arises... said Mr. 
Bundy, "we will have to weigh the situ-
ation'very carefully." 
Sure enough, last Thursday a mixed 
U.S.-South Vietnamese force, engaged 
in a firefight, crossed inicTCambodia 
territory. Three Cambodians were re-
ported killed, plus two Americans and 
four Vietnarnese. 
Within two weeks the "reciprocal res-
pect, comprehension and good faith" 
the Sihanouk-Bowles c o m in it 
purred about has been blown sky high. 
Point One, it seems to us. is that if the 
Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army 
were not using Cambodian territory as 
a rear area and sanctuary there would 
be no need to talk about hot pursuit or 
self-defense. Sihanouk's one-sided "neu-
trality" makes the situation worse. 
Point Two is that Thursday's bloody 
incident undermines any' confidence in 
the Johnson Administration's word that 
it would like to see a political settle-
ment of the Cambodian border problem 
and that it seeks no wider battlefield. Of 
the 12,600 hamlets in South Vietnam, 
3989 are regarded as Viet Cong-
3-E 
The Soviet Union and the United 
States, in an extraordinary example of 
diplomatic bargaining, have finally 
filled in the blank to complete a draft 
treaty designed to halt the further 
spread of nuclear weapons. It took seven 
years of hard, and at times discouraging. 
negotiating, but in the final accounting, 
both sides realized that ideological dif-
ferences were secondary to the lighten-
ing of the shadow of nuclear terror. 
� The first draft of the treaty was 
presented to the 17-nation disarmament 
conference in Geneva last August 28 in 
a form essentially the same as now � 
with one major exception. At that time 
Article III, the section dealing with in-
ternational controls, was left blank. And 
until the wording of that key provision 
could be agreed upon, all the high 
Sounding phrases of the treaty were vir-
tually meaningless. 
Now, despite the dangerously divisive 
Issue of Vietnam, the two powers have 
agreed on the key section and have 
named the International Atomic Energy 
Agency as the body with over-all control 
over safeguards. In addition, changes 
have been made in the wording of the 
treaty designed to meet objections 
raised by such non-nuclear powers as 
Sweden, West Germany, Italy, Israel, 
Egypt, Japan and India. 
But with the completion of Article 
III, even assuming that the major reser-
vations of the nuclear have-nots have 
been met, the treaty still cannot fulfill 
the yearnings of mankind for freedom 
from the fear of nuclear devastation. 
So Icing as two of the world's five atomic 
powers�France and Mainland China�
refuse to join the pact, the shadow will 
remain. 
President Johnson has hailed the 
new draft as "a landmark In the effort 
of mankind to avoid nuclear disaster." 
And so it Is; a landmark, not the 
achievement of a goal. The only true 
safeguard against the madness of nu-
clear war remains the ultimate sanity 
of the leaders whose fingers rest on the 
triggers of annihinition 
dominated. Why not attend to that busi-
ness and stay out of Cambodia? 
To crank up the IC(' was regarded as 
a long-shot hope anyway, taking several 
months at best. It is touch and go. in-
volving Britain and Russia, as Geneva 
Conference co-chairmen, and India, Po-
land and Canada as ICC members. With 
the latest blowup on the border, the 
odds just went UP.

THE REVOLUTIONARIES

from the annual report of President 
Nathan Pusey of Harvard university, He 
discusses his difficulties with student revo-
lutionaries and says that bringing them 
back to reality presents "a new kind of 
challenge" to educators. 
Harvard has been no tolerant of revolu-
tionaries in recent years that President 
Pasty's criticism of them comes as a 
surprise. It is also surprising to find him 
describing the problem as a new one. 
Thomas Jefferson dealt with it in a letter 
to his grandson, warning him against dis-
putes with students. 
Jefferson advised his grandson to keep 
aloof from them "as you would froes. the 
infected subjects of yellow fever or pesti-
lence. Consider yourself, when with them, 
as among the patients of Bedlam, needing 
medical care more than moral eounsel. 
Be a listener only, keeping within yourself 
the habit of silence, especially on politics

attempts to set one of these fiery zealots

his admissions officers to screen out some

When a�Wave of criticism of. the Navy's 
poor judgment broke, Navy Secretary Paul 
R. Ignatius announced that Capt. Alexan-

' Since Competent Navy men do not pre-
fer desk jobs' to sea duty, -the public's in-

prompted him to get the Navy off the 
hook' by permitting his superiors to quote 
hint as asking for the transfer. 
Rep. Joseph -Y. Resnick, D-N.Y., is 
inking � those contending that Alexander 
Was forced to request reassignment be-
cause had offended the admirals. Res-
nick is pressing for the House hearing. 
If Aleitander is not being punished for 
expressing his view ,of the. Arnheiter case, 
the Navy has nothing to fear from an open 
'hearing. It should be pleased to have the

Diplomacy, One Kind 
Since King Constantine's absence 
from Athens seems likely to have 
an indefinite duration, the United 
States has resumed "normal diplo

Government of Greece. Such 
language is evoked by the circum-
stance that relations had never 
been actually broken: on the.argu-

credited to' the chief of state, 
meaning Constantine, the United

rupture of relations and still not 
signify approval of the junta that 
seized power in last April's coup. 
That's the way diplomacy works,

ated by the Navy for the super-
secret N,ltional Security agency 
or for itself? The Pentagon 
would say officially only that 
the vessel was an "intelligence. 
collection auxiliary ship." 
Authoritative sources insisted 
that unlike the Liberty, which 
was attacked by Israeli PT boats 
and aircraft off the Sinai Penin-
sula during the Middle Eastern 
war last June, the Pueblo was 
not directly associated with Na-; 
tional Security Agency and was 
involved in naval intelligence 
work under the direct command 
of Pacific Fleet headquarters in 
Honolul. 
There are said to be a "hand-
ful" of similar electronic intelli-
gence ships that are operated 
for the Navy and a handful of 
other ships, such as the Lib-
erty, operated by the Navy for 
National Security Agency. 
Russians Keep Watch, Too 
The Russians keep at least 
seven or eight similar electronic 
intelligence ships on station at 
any given time al over the 
world. They maintain a con-
stant vigil in international 
waters of Holy Loch, Scotland; 
Rota, Spain, and Guam in the 
Pacific, where United States 
submarines equipped with Po-
laris missiles are based. 
They also stay close to the, 
United States Sixth Fleet in the 
Mediterranean and the Seventh 
:Fleet in the Pacific, trying to 
lintercept operational orders, to 
:determine the radio and radar 
ifrequencies most commonly 
Iused, and to btain other intelli-, 
,gence data. 
I Lack of Escort Questioned 
I Why did the Pueblo not carry 
:heavier weapons or, lacking a 
capability for effective- self-
defense, why was a destroyer 
escort not maintained in the 
vicinity? 
Pentagon sources said that 
since such vessels operated:. 
only in international waters, it: 
had been assumed they would 
inot be attacked. As for a war-
'ship escort, the Navy is sorely. 
;pressed to maintain required 
'destroyers off Vietnam and in 
the other major fleets patrol-
ling the world's oceans, the 
sources remarked, without the 
added requirement of providing 
an escort for electronic intelli-
gence vessels. 
There were some hints last 
night that the Pueblo may have 
belatedly requested help when 
she was about to be seized, but 
no explanation for why that 
help did not come. It was 
noted out by some Pentagon 
sources that American aircraft 
would have been within their 
:rights to strafe and bomb the 
North Korean vessels, at least 
while they remained in interna-
tional waters, once they had 
seized the Pueblo. 
Defense Department planners 
suggest some of these and re-
lated questions may not be 
satisfactorily answered until a 
full-scale investigation has been 
held. A high-level inquiry is 
almost inevitable. 
"With the Liberty and the 
Pueblo we've now experienced 
two unprovoked attacks in 
seven months," one angry Pen-
tagon officer said. "Maybe 
now, instead of using practi-
cally defenseless merchant-type 
ships, we'll mount the special 
equipment aboard old destroyer 
picket ships that could at least 
defend themselves."

Pycngyang Broadcast 
Today naval vessels of our 
people's army captured an 
armed spy boat of the U. S. 
imperialist aggressor force 
that intruded way into the 
territorial waters of the re-

hostile activities.. . 
The U. S. imperialists and 
the Park Chung Hee puppet 
clique of traitors, extremely 
dismayed and upset by activ-

have been rapidly stepped 
up recently, have proclaimed 
a so-called "emergency mo-

South Korea and are tyran-

North Korean Seizure of U.S. Ship Sparks 
Diplomatic Flurry and Host of Speculations 
By 1-IgNey (i5i Si lit, 
$1,71 Ttir STRESTJOVRNa 
WASHINGTON.- A capital divided nver one 
U.S. war in Asia found itself suddenly fared 
with the possibility it could have a second one 
on its hands yesterday. 
The seizure of , a r.S. Naval vessel. 
crammed with eleetronir intelligence-gathering 
gear, by North l�nrean patrol boats in the Sea 
of Japan produced a confusion of assessments. 
A rush of diplomatte activity was begun, aimed 
not only at keeping the incident front escalat-
ing but at resolving it rapidly. 
"tVe want the Final and its iirewnion back, in 
a hurry," was the official line. There was hope 
of achieving that. but there was also concern 
that it might not happen. and some men in re-
sponsible Washington posts were using the ugly 
word, "war." 
Broad Spectrum of Speculation 
The spectrum elf speculation as to Comm', 
niSt intent and potential consequences was ex-
tremely broad, and at the extreme it included 
this possibility: 
The Communist part of the world, display-
ing more unity than U.S. experts have deemed 
likely, is opening a "second front" in warfare 
against America. To the strains of the Vietnam 
war�which have been giving the "Yankee im�

the Reds to push hard somewhere else in the 
world, hoping to meet little resistance. If so.

penetration. 
It must be emphasized, however, that such 
a grand conspiracy is cited c, at. the outskirts 
of speculation. "We aren't leaping to any such 
conclusion," said one informed official. For less 
alarming interpretations can be offered. 
At the milder end of the spectrum was the 
possibility that the capture of the U.S.S. Pueblo 
wasn't planned at all�net by world Communist 
chieftains, and not even by the North Korean 
government�but was merely in adventure ni 
overzealous junior officers commanding pirati-
cal patrol boats. 
Or the venture could have been planned, but 
with quite limited objectives. Presumably, the 
Reds could hand the ship and its crew back 
quickly, and still mark up a big gain: Their

SHIP CAPTURED BY REDS A NAVY VESSEL 
DOING A NAVY JOB . 
By ORR KELLY 
Scar Staff Writer 
The intelligence gathering ship captured by North Korea 
today was a Navy ship with a Navy crew operating on a 
Navy mission. 
Informed sources said the USS Pueblo was different from 
the USS Liberty which was attacked by Israeli forces off the 
Sinai Peninsula June 8. 
Although the fact was never confirmed by the Pentagon, 
it was learned at that time that the Navy operated the Liberty 
as a floating electronic information-gathering vessel for the 
National Security Agency. 
Pentagon sources declined to say just What the role of 
the Pueblo was off the North Korean shore, but there were 
indications that its assignment was to monitor North Korean 
radio traffic and radar operations for the Navy. 
Both the United States and the Soviet Union have a 
number of electronic intelligence ships which perform a 
variety of roles. 
The Soviet ships regularly operate near the bases for 
U.S. Polaris missile submarines and off Cape Kennedy, Fla. 
3-7 
They also normally show up to keep an eye on US. and 
NATO manuevers. 
In the Gulf of Tonkin, Soviet electronic trawlers shadow 
U.S. aircraft carriers, operating just at the horizon, beyond 
the carriers' destroyer screen. Their major purpose is pre-
sumed to be to act as an early warning system for North 
Vietnamese anti-aircraft crews. 
The U.S. electronic ships are used to help keep track of 
Soviet missile and space launches. Operating a short dis-
tance off-shore, they also are capable of listening in on radio 
traffic and plotting the location and power of shore-based 
radar installations. 
The Russians have 26 large trawlers and the United 
States bas five converted merchant ships for electronic ear 
veillance. In addition, both nations have sizable numbers of 
smaller ships such as the Pueblo which are used for this 
purpose. Combat ships also carry a large array of similar 
electronic equipment. 
The United States claims only a 3-mile limit off her 
shores, which means that Soviet vessels can operate just 
outside the 3-mile limits and still be in international limits. 
The Russians, North Koreans and a number of other 
nations claim a 12-mile territorial limit Chile claims a 200. 
mile limit and has taken action against U.S. fishing boats 
operatng within that area.

Of Devil's Advocate? 
By JOSEPH C. GOULDEN 
WHEN the memoirs are finally printed, possibly there 
will be confirmation or refutation of the report 
that surfaced here over the Weekend that. Robert S. 
McNamara's last act as Secretary of Defense was to urge 
President Johnson to halt temporarily the bombing of 
North Vietnam to test whether Hanoi's latest "peace offer" 
was real. 
Whatever the answer, no one at the Pentagon or White 
House is saying, and so Robert McNamara slides out of 
the decision-making hierarchy and into the presidency of 
the World Bank. his seven years and odd days at the top 
now grist for the historians and .Republican campaign 
orators. 
For those persons desiring a change in Mr. Johnson's 
war policies, the appointment of insider's-insider Clark M. 
Clifford is discomforting. Clifford's ballot has long been 
a hefty one in the weighed voting of Mr. Johnson's con-
sensus process, and it will be'even more so once he leaves 
the Telephone Cabinet and acquires official standing.

Cambridge, Mass.: The Kennedy Liberals at Harvard 
By JAMES RESTON 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 23 
�There is a serious political 
and philosophical argument go-
ing on here among the Ken-
nedy liberals at Harvard. it is 
not the tiresome personal dis-
pute that we are having in 
Washington between President 
Johnson and the Kennedy clan, 
but an argument among the 
Kennedy supporters about 
Presidential power, the condi-
tion of the nation and whether 
Senator Robert Kennedy of 
New York can do, anything 
about these things. 
The Kennedy-Johnson feud 
is, of course, very much in evi-
dence here, and there is a 
group of Kennedy lovers and 
Johnson haters, some of them 
former aides to President Ken-
nedy, who are using Harvard 
as a comfortable launching pad 
for blasting the Johnson Ad-
ministration out of power. But 
the issue is much wider and 
deeper than that. 
The Dilemma 
The Kennedy liberals came 
out of the New Deal tradition 
and many of them have argued 
for years for a "strong Presi-
dency." Now they find them-
selves in the awkward position 
of not liking what President 
Johnson has done with Presi-
dential power in Vietnam, and 
yet not blowing quite how to 
sen thinking the risk of run-
ning is too great and Schles-
inger insisting that the risk of 
not running, which might cost 
him the support of the young, 
is even greater. 
About the only thing they 
all agree on is that President 
Johnson should go down in 
history as a political accident 
between the two Kennedy 
Presidencies, and that Senator 
Kennedy should at least get 
ready to run, just in case Pres-
ident Johnson decides at the 
last minute not to seek re-
election. 
The Emotional-Climate 
What seems even clearer 
here than in Washington is that 
Senator Kennedy has not decid-
ed the question, which is why 
the barrage of arguments from 
here continues, and the feeling 
runs so deep on the subject 
Arthur Schlesinger Jr., for that it has apparently divided

arguing that Senator Kennedy even the Kennedy family.

change the policies they op-
pose. 
That is one part of the argu-
ment here. The liberals are 
now trying to restrain the very 
powers they wanted in the 
past, and don't know how to 
do it. 
More important, they are as 
troubled about bow to chal-
lenge President Johnson on 
political grounds as they are 
on how to challenge him on 
constitutional grounds. 
For the present, the Keane-
dy supporters are not only ar-
guing among themselves about 
whether Senator Robert Ken-
nedy of New York should or 
should not challenge the Pres-
ident for the Democratic nom-
ination, but are writing essays 
and lawyer's briefs on the top-
ic, pro and con. 
wrong, as Robert Kennedy cer-
tainly does. 
This is a serious argument 
because it is a conflict of prin-
ciples. One principle is that a 
man should back his beliefs if 
he thinks the present policies 
will divide and weaken the na-
tion at home and in its relations 
with the rest of the would. The 
other principle is that a man 
should support- his party- in a 
crisis, even if he disagrees with 
it, especially if there is a seri-
ous prospect that his opposition 
would shatter his party and 
might even open the way for a 
more hawkish Administration in 
Washington than the present 
The balance In this debate 
seems to run against an open 
challenge by Kennedy. This is 
not an argument hem at Har-
vard between academic ama-
teurs, but between men who 
have had a great deal of experi-
ence in Washington, know the 
political skill and constitutional 
power of the President. and 
therefore are trying to recon-
cile their wishes and the forces 
on the other side. 
So far they have not been 
able to do so. They are the sad-
dest and most frustinted par-
hcipants on the American po-
litical some today, but they are 
arguing about serious things 
and at least they agree that 
Kennedy should remain avail-
able until the California Presi-
dential printery.

NEW YORK POST 20 JANUARY ( 26) 
McNamara and Clifford 
The timing of President Johnson's an-
nouncement that Clark Clifford has been 
chosen to succeed Defense Secretary Mc-
Namara may have been entirely inadver-
tent. But it trill be construed in many 
places as symbolic. 
McNamara has long been a figure of 
plradox. It has been an open secret�and, 
in some instances, a matter of record�
that he long ago began questioning the 
strategy of escalation and voicing skepti-
cism about the effectiveness of our Viet-
nam bombing program. On many occasions 
observers have wryly noted that McNa-
mara seemed disposed to emphasize the 
need for creative diplomacy while Secretary 
of State Rusk.acted as mouthpiece for the 
JoiftraTeTS of Staff. 
Clifford is a respected, gifted attorney 
with a long record of distinguished public 
service. He has also been frequently de-
scribed as one of those unofficial Acheson-
Ian White House advisors who have played 
a large role in shaping our dead-end role ill 
Vietnam. If that is the case, his designation 
as McNamara's replacement is new cause 
for apprehension. 
But public office involves responsibili-
ties far beyond the realm of intermittent 
advice. What can be said with certainty is 
that Clifford's appointment gives finality 
to the departure of McNamara, and the 
largeness of the loss cannot be underesti-
mated. He fought many momentous battles 
in behalf of the principle of civilian ride; 
he refused to be pushed around by the 
generals; he introduced dramatic 'move-
lions in the department's procedures�des-
pite the resistance of bureaucracy�that 
will not be easily reversed. He set a lofty 
standard for his successor. 
BALTIMORE NEWS AMERICAN

McNarnara's Successor 
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE 
a man more qualified than (lurk M Clifford to suc-
ceed Robert S. McNamara as Secretary of Defense. 
Both President Johnson and the nation .are fortun-
ate a man of such calibre and experience has agreed 
to accept designation for one of the three toughest 
jobs in Washington. 
In a sense, Mr. Clifford is a predecessor of Mr. 
McNamara as well as his successor. It was he who 
drafted the 'act calling for unit ication of the armed 
services and establishing the office of Secretary of 
Defense in 1947 under President Truman, Thus the 
effective overhall of the military establishment 
achieved by Mr. McNamara represents a goal first 
envisioned by the secretary-designate and his fel-
low planners a generation ago. 
This was typical of the effective .visionary 
astuteness provided by Mr. Clifford fdr more than 
20 years either as an aide or consultant ,to Demo-
cratic presidents�all his close personal friends. In 
this role of key strategy advisor, the wealthy attor-
ney has become one of the nation's most respected. 
experts not only on military matters but in foreign 
affairs, economics, intelligence operations and polit-
ical tactics. � 
Clark Clifford's unmatched experience, his 
proven know-how, and above all his exceptional tact 
in solving delicate problems in the mazes of official 
Washington meet the tremendous demands of his 
impending assignment. Yet his chief asset is some-
thing else. Unlike his brilliant but sometimes wav-
ering predecessor, he is as firm a supporter of Mr. 
Johnson's Vietnam policies as is Secretary of State 
Dean Rusk. Once again the nation's three top lead-
ers will be working in the kind of total cooperation 
and understanding vital for bringing the war to its 
earliest possible conclusion. 
� 
CHICAGO SUN-TIRES 23 JAIIIRY 1968 (26) 
A Diplomat In The Pentagon 
Hawks and doves have joined in 
approval of the appointment of Clark 
M. Clifford to succeed Robert S. Mc-
Namara as secretary of. defense. Clif-
ford will bring to the Pentagon a 
wealth of experience not only in mili-
tary affairs but in the field of diplo-
macy, foreign and domestic. 
Like McNamara. Clifford has a well-
deserved reputation for intellectual - 
brilliance. McNamara was a World 
War II Air Force officer; Clifford was 
a Navy officer. McNamara left his 
private job at great financial sacrifice. 
So will Clifford. But there the com-
parison virtually ends. 
Unlike McNamara. who came to 
Washington from the Ford Motor Co., 
Clifford's career has been in law and 
government affairs: Clifford has been 
a trusted counselor to Presidents Tru-
man, Kennedy and Johnson. He has a 
large law practice. 
Clifford was one of the drafters of 
the 1947 law unifying the armed forces 
under the secretary of defense. Presi-
dent Kennedy appointed him chair-
man of the President's Foreign Intel-
ligence Advisory Board, a position he 
still holds. In 1966 he was President 
Johnson's adviser at the Manila con-
ference and last year he and Gen. 
Maxwell Taylor visited a number of 
Southeast Asian and Pacific countries 
as personal emissaries Of the Presi-
dent, discussing Vietnam. 
Clifford was one of the persons Mc-
Namara recommended to Mr. Johnson 
as qualified for the defense post. 
No two men approach the same job 
the same way and Clifford undoubted-
ly will be a striking change from Mc-
Namara. But each may prove to hav,. 
been just the right man for the job at 
the time. 
McNamara served longer than any 
other person in the job (seven years). 
He brought the efficiencies of private 
industry and he put a firm civilian 
hand on the military brass. � 
Clifford will inherit the more stream-
lined establishment created by Mc-
Namara and it is to be hoped that he 
will prove as tough in asserting civil-
ian control over the generals and ad. 
mirals as McNamara did. 
Clifford's own particular contribu 
lion, however, may be in helping to 
unify Washington behind a course for 
peace. Although he has a reputation 
for being more hawkish than McNa-
mara, his appointment was praised by 
a thoroughgoing dove, Sen. J. William 
Fulbright (D-Ark.). 
Fulbright said that he felt that Clif-
ford will at least listen to critics of 
the President's policy. And since the 
President leans on Clifford for advice. 
a better understanding of the various 
positions might result. 
On the other hand, Clifford's ap-
pointment means that the President 
will feel that he has greater personal 
control over the office; Mr. Johnson 
inherited McNamara from President 
Kennedy. Clifford is his own personal 
choice. 
With a new defense chief some of 
the nation's priorities may be subtly 
adjusted. We hope the appointment of 
Clifford, a Johnson adviser on diplo-
macy as well as defense, will mean 
a stronger emphasis on the political 
and diplomatic aspects of the Vietnam 
problem rather than the purely mili-
tary. Meanwhile it is salutary that 
the appointment has been generally 
applauded. 
ST. PETERSBURG TIMES 20 JANUARY 1968 (26) 
The New Defense Secretary 
President Johnson's selection of 
Clark Clifford to be the new secre-
tary of defense had not been wide-
ly forecast; yet it should come as 
no real surprise. 
� Clifford not only is one of the 
President's closest friends, confi-
dante, and advisers, as he was to 
Presklents Kennedy and Truman, 
he is also one of the most 1mowl-
edge.able men in Washington in the 
inner workings Of government at 
all levels. 
HIS DIPLDJILACY, his ability to 
work with the members of Con-
gress, and an innate toughness 
that has kept him at or near the 
top of the political jungle in Wash-
ington for two decades make him 
quite possibly the best choice that 
could have been made to follow 
Robert McNamara in the nation's 
toughest job next to the presidency 
itself. 
Clifford has not held a full-time 
government job since he served as 
special counsel to President Tru-
man from 1946 to 1950. But while 
practicing law in Washington since, 
he has remained close to the 
sources of political power � par-
ticularly in the Senate during the 
Eisenhower years, whets Lyndon 
Johnson was majority leader. 
President Kennedy, after his 
election in 1960. called on Clifford 
to represent him with the Eisen-
hower Administration in the trans-
fer of power. 
HE HAS SERVED President 
Johnson not only as a personal ad-
viser, but in such public ways as 
chairman of the President's For-
eign Intelligence Advisory Board 
and emissary, with Gen. Maxwell 
Taylor, on a visit to our Far East 
Vietnam allies last year. 
Clifford will embark on his 
new assignment with the full 
confidence of the President and 
with many friends and few ene-
mies in Congress. 
These are 'impressive assets, 
which will serve him well in main-
taining the civilian control that 
McNamara has succeeded in es-
tablishing over the vast military 
establishment in the Pentagon. 
The country will wish him well.

The universal question i.e whether what 
Secretary of State Ritsk has tentatively 
termed an act of war- Will actually erupt 
into another Asian conflict of deadly di-
flinSiOnS. The sense of natfonal alarm is 
becoming comparable to that stirred by 
the Cuban missile crisis. 
But it is crucial to discern the differ-
ences. The Soviets' reckless Cuban advm-
lure plainly demanded an immediate, 
unflinching countermove. The Pueblo inci-
dent demands the utmost care and cau-
tion and the exhaustive use of every diplo-
matic alternative to military means. Capt. 
Stephen Decatur�who once surrendered 
a ship�is remembered for saying: "Our 
country, right or wrong." It still remains 
it mystery wriz.,ther this nation is supreme-
ly right in the Pueblo crisis. 
So far, the Administration appears to 
appreciate the uncertainties. Responsible 
Congressional leaders such as Senate Ma-
jority Leader Mansfield ID-Mont.) have 
wisely counseled sober consideration and 
restraint. There is no discernible sessional 
response to the outcries for massive retali-
ation from Sens. Thurmond (R-S.C.) or 
Dodd 1D-Conn.). Although it has moved 
the nuclear carrier Enterprise and other 
warships into position off Wonsan Bay, 
Washington seems determined to seek a 
diplomatic solution. 
if 
� 
To secure any national assent in the 
use of means beyond vigorous diplomacy 
to recover the Pueblo and her officers and 
men, the Johnson Administration must 
first answer scores of unanswered ques-
tions�about the ship's mission, about her 
actual location at the time of the boarding, 
about the absence of protection for Ihe 
vessel, about the obvious failure to inter-
dict the attack. 
One of the most basic questions is 
where the Pueblo was when she was inter-
cepted by the North Korean patrol boats. 
The Pentagon's first official announcement 
of the seizure said the ship's reported posi-
tion was "approximately 25 miles from the 
mainland of North Korea." 
But according to Rear Adm, John V. 
Smith in Panmunjom, the Pueblo was 
only 16 nautical miles off the coast. Naut-
ical miles are longer than land miles, but 
the two distance figures cannot be recon-
ciled. The North Koreans claim territor-
ial waters stretching out 12 miles from 
the coast. Was the Pueblo really on the 
"high seas"? Or did she wander�or steer 
�closer? The point is hardly minor; if 
Soviet spy ships�the familiar counter-
parts of the Pueblo�were to approach 
the coast of Maine, bristling with elec-
tronic gear and flaunting their purpose, 
what would Washington's reaction be? 
Finally, who authorized the Pueblo's 
hazardous journey�especially at a mo-
ment when peace talks in Vietnam were 
still ostensibly being pursued? 
if 
Sea. Fulbright (D-Ark.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, re-
marked that "the fact We are deeply committed in Vietnam undoubtedly contributes 
to all other countries feeling more free than normal from serious retaliation." That 
is certainly plausible. It remains to be demonstrated that the Pueblo seizure is a 
calculated Communist diversion. But even if the U. S. were not committed in Vietnam, 
even if we were prepaued to retaliate heavily, Washington has yet to furnish any 
persuasive justification for so fateful an act. Only the most searching, patient diplo-
macy�and a full airing of the facts--is justified now.

the world's first exchange of nuclear war-

academic in such catastrophic circumstances. 
But such grim questio,ns have been posed. and 
they will continue to.ceme.up as they have once 
more this week. 
The Washington Post kicked off the latest dis-
cession. The Post asserted that both the United 
States and the Soyiet Cnien now place cities. 
rather than military installations, at the lop of 
their nuclear targeting list. But the Pentagon im-
mediately denied .1.hat :any such fundamental

might be able to knock out all of Russia's strate-

The contrary judgment, which the Pentagon 
has publicly rebuffed, is that American long-
range ballistic missiles are not accurate enough 
to score direct hits on concealed, underground 
Soviet missile silos. According to this appraisal, 
the Russians find themselves similarly restrict-

In fact the main idea behind the F-
111 was to make. it a multipurpose air-
craft. As planes get more sophisticated 
in concept (and this one ;narks a big 
forward step in technology) the cost 
goes up sharply. Defense Sec. Mc-
Namara pushed for the F-lit partly 
on the argument that its "commonal-
ity" in use by both services would 
save the taxpayers an estimated $I 
billion. If the Navy now goes out to 
develop different planes for its own 
special purposes, the added bill could 
run high. 
These are complex matters that not 
only strain the limits of aircraft tech-
nology, but also involve top-secret 
electronics and weaponry. The aver-
age citizen is in no position to judge 
whether he is getting a square deal or 
not; he must depend on the experts in 
the aircraft industry, the generals and 
admirals, and the committeemen in 
Congress who share in shaping the 
Defense Department decisions.

North Korecou delegate to the 
Military Armistice Commission 
to Panintinjan, Korea, regard-
ing the seizure ai Pueblo. 
By Admiral Smith 
I now have one more sub-
ject to raise which is also of 
an extremely serious nature. 
This concerns the nriminal 
boarding and seizure of the 
U.S. naval vessel Pueblo in 
international waters on 23 
January lefl5. at approxi-
mately 1330 local time 
by North Korean forces. 
This matter is appropriate 
for discussion -because it is 
part ef new pattern of North 
Korea belligerence and ag-
� gressive actions which dan-
gerously increase tensions in 
this area. If they are per-
sisted in. they will have most 
serious consequences to 
maintenance ofaannistice and 
to preservation of peace in 
Korea. These . hostile acts 
cannot he perpetrated with 
impunity. 
It is important that yeti 
understand difference be-
tween international and ter-
ritorial waters and rights ac-
corded ships nf all nations, 
especially public vessels, in 
international waters. 
� You must surely realize 
that any public vessel has 
complete immunity from 
jurisdiction of any state other 
than the flag state. This in, 
munitv to interference has 
long been recognized in cus-
tomary international law, 
and specifically in the con-
vention on high seas. 
The Pueblo was in inter-
national waters at the time 
of the incident, its exact loca-
tion being latitude 39 degrees 
20 mineus North, longitude 
127 degrees 54 minutes East. 
It was over 16 nautical miles 
from land. Its location was 
exact, as the ship was 
equipped with modern navi-
gational equipment. 
Apology Demanded 
In the interest of comlvina-
with the laws and customs 
of nations, it is necessary 
that your regime do the fol-
lowing: 
I. Return the vessel and 
crew intact, immediately. 
2. Apologize to the United 
-States Government for this 
illegal action. 
You are also advised that 
the United States reserves 
the right to ask for compen-
sation under . international 
law. 
Further, I hav^
quested hi' by the United States 
Government to say the fol-
lowing directly to you.

especially the last few days.

NEW YORK TINES � 26 JANUARY 1968 
Call-Up: A First Step 
Mobilization of Reserve Units Viewed 
As Move Toward Greater Readiness 
By HANSON W 
The mobilization of 14,787 
reservists yesterday is a first 
step toward increasing the 
readiness and effectiveness of 
the United States armed forces 
around the world. Military 
souri..eJ indicated that the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff had repeatedly 
recommended limited mobiliza-
tion or the Reserves ever since 
� our first commit-
ment of ground 
News combat units to 
Analysis Vietnam in the 
Spring of 1965. 
The Administra-
tion, however, chose to expand 
,the armed forces by increased 
draft calls and enlistments, by 
forming new units, and by 
transferring personnel from all 
over the world to Vietnam. I 
Inventories of weapons, am-; 
munition and equipment in' 
Europe, Korea and the Unitedi 
States were drawn down to 
l 
support our forces in Vietnam. 
The experience level of the 
armed forces was materially 
reduced by massive and con-
tinuous personnel turnovers, in-
cident to the one-year rotation 
policy in Vietnam and the two-
year draft. 
A production policy, spon-
sored by Secretary of Defense 
Robert S. McNamara, tailored 
to the concept that United 
States factories would turn out, 
whatever was needed to supply! 
the needs of the Vietnam war. 
and our other forces overseas 
but not much more than that, 
was to be avoided, and, after 
munition and equipment, such 
as those that followed World 
War II and the Korean war, 
was tobe avoided, and,after 
the war ended, the depletoi 
inventories around the world 
were to be replaced as muni-
tions factories gradually re-
duced their production and 
thus eased the transition froml 
war to peace. 1 
Risks Were Involved 
These policies, though attrar-I 
tive politically and economi-i 
rally, involved military risks. 
Military and Congressional 
leaders have repeatedly warned 
that the concentration of half 
a million men in Vietnam had 
depleted United States ready 
strength elsewhere; many had 
indicated that we were "spread 
thin," and that if any other 
major incident occurred else-
where in the world or if many 
additional troops were required 
for Vietnam mobilization would 
be mandatory. 
Officers in Washington be-
ieve that the seizure of the 
Pueblo by the North Koreans. 
the other aggressive actions 
of the North Koreans and the 
massive re-enforcements the 
North Vietnamese have sent to 
the Khesanh area along the 
demilitarized zone in Vietnam 
1�F 
. BALDWIN 
were the catalysts that led to 
'the President's reaction. 
The call-up of units of the 
t Air National Guard, Air Re-
iserve, and the Naval air arm 
lis viewed not only as a political 
land psychological reaction to 
Ithe Pueblo seizure, but also 
as an attempt to strengthen 
what is probably the weakest 
and most strained element of 
the nation's military strength 
�its tactical air power. 
The weakness, in places like 
Korea and Japan, of United 
States tactical air strength was 
underscored by the Pueblo in-
cident. Most of the Tactical 
Air Command's available squad-
rons�except a few engaged in 
training activities � have al-
ready been concentrated in 
Vietnam; four squadrons have 
been withdrawn from Europe. 
and the Navy's carrier air 
wings in the Mediterranean and 
Atlantic have been under-
strength in planes and pilots. 
One informed officer said 
yesterday that, without doubt, 
the most serious worldwide 
shortage was aircraft and heli-
copter& and the pilots to man 
them. He also said that "no. 
body's ammunition- reserve � 
with the exception of Vietnam 
� was back to the pre-Viet-
nam level," and he predicted 
that if any "continuous shoot-
ing started in Korea or else-
where various shortages would 
soon develop. 
The units ordered to active 
duty yesterday will add 372 
aircraft and almost 14,800 men 
to the regular forces. The Air 
National Guard units, which for 
the bulk of the call-up, are in 
a fairly high state of readi-
ness, even though their North 
American F-100 fighters, and 
their McDonnell RF-101 recon-
naissance planes are old and 
are no match for Soviet Migs. 
The six Naval Reserve squad-
rons with 72 aircraft are 
equipped with Ling-Temco-
Vought F-8 fighters and with 
Douglas A-4B attack planes. 
Both are old; the Douglas model 
is the second oldest of the A-4 
line. The six Air Reserve 
squadrons fly transport and 
rescue planes � all of them 
old but still serviceable. 
Two Purposes Seen 
This very modest increment 
to United States air 'strength 
may serve two military pur-
poses, officers believe: the Re-
serve squadrons and personnel 
may free regular units in this 
country for service overseas, 
and they will provide an initial 
augmenting of the number of 
aircraft available, a particularly 
important element in a con-
ventional and nonatomic war 
where numbers of aircraft are 
ifar more important than in a 
I nuclear war.

ment necessary for espionage 
activitics into our coastal 
waters eff Wonsan in the 
vicinity ef 39 degrees 17 
minutes North, 127 degrees 
46 minutes East. 
The zrmcd spy chip of the 
United States imperialist ag-
gressive navy intruded further 
eart into our coastal waters 
and committed intolerable 
provocations against our side. 
Our naval vessels, which 
were carrying out their rou-
tine patrol duty in our coastal 
waters, returned the fire upon 
the piratical group that in-
truded deep into our coastal 
waters and insolently made 
resistance, thus killing and 
wounding several soldiers of 
the United States imperialist 
aggressive army, capturing 
80-odd of them alive. 
Thus, now in our nanas are 
the armed spy ship, 1,000-odd 
tons of the United States im-
perialist aggressive navy 
which your side deliberately 
dispatched into our coastal 
waters for reconnaissance 
upon our side and scores of 
small arms, including anti-
aircraft machine guns and 
other large quantities of' 
weapons and equipment nec-
essary for espionage pur-
poses, including tens of thou-
sands of ammunition of vari-
ous kinds and hand grenades 
equipped an the ship. 
Notwithstanding that you 
have committed overt aggres-
sive acts, you have indulged 
in making charges in an at-
� tempt to cover up the truth 
of your piratical act by dis-
torting the facts as if your 
armed ship had been in inter-
national waters. 
-Charge Is 'Preposterous' 
Your preposterous charge 
only graphically reveals the 
" barbarous and shameless na-
ture of the United States 
imperialist aggressors. 
The recent vicious hostile 
act by your side is a link in 
the chain of the, United States 
imperialist aggressive policy 
for provoking a new war of 
aggression after further ag-
gravating tension in Korea. 
It is the most overt aggres-
sive act, an open challenge 
to the Korean people. 
I strongly demand you to 
frankly admit the violations, 
provocations and aggressive 
acts committed by your side 
in the DM7 and in our coastal 
waters, to apologize to our 
side for them, to sever* 
punish as required by the 
armistice agreement the mad 
culprits who organized and 
commanded the incidents and 
all the criminals involved in 
them. 
Reply by Admiral Smith 
Your last wild statement 
and distorted version of your 
piracy off Wonsan were ob-
viously intended to divert at-
tention from your regime's 
attempt to assassinate the 
President of the Republic of 
Korea and your actual cap-
ture of a United States naval 
vessel in international waters. 
I will investigate any reason-
able allegations but I will not 
be diverted by your tactic. 
I have nothing further. 
RIv Rv Ceneral Pak 
1IL�UP CORM) 
Yesterday's orders 'affected 
about one-seventh of the Air 
National Guard's total strength 
� about 1,557 additional air-
craft and 74,418 men remain 
in reserve status. The Naval 
Air Reserve could provide an 
additional 194 squadrons; only 
six have been called up. The 
Air Reserve still has 312 planes. 
Most of these units:kowever, 
have old equipment and many 
of them would require con-
siderable refresher training. 
Ground elements of the Na-
tional Guard and the Reserve 
are not nearly as ready as the 
air components. These units 
are now in the midst of an-
other of the periodic reorgani-
zations that have occurred and 
recurred in the last six years, 
and only a few brigades are 
adequately trained and equipped 
for deployment without a long 
period of training on active 
duty. 
The Fourth Marine Division, 
a reserve unit, is probably the 
best equipped and most ready 
of all reserve ground units:. it 
maintains a mobilization cadre 
on active duty at Camp Pendle-
ton in California. It is short of 
some items of equipment, and 
its air and helicopter support 
are deficient, but it could be 
ready for action quickly. 
Of the regular active units, 
the Army's 82d Airbome Divi-
sion at Fort Bragg, N. C., has � 
:a higher state of readiness than 
lany other unit in this country. 
The Second Marine Division at 
Camp Lejeune, N. C., "can go 
fight," as one officer put it, 
ibut "they're down"; they have 
!served as a kind of "depot 
division" for Vietnam. 
Two armored divisions in 
Texas and the Fifth Infantry 
Division (Mechanized) are in 
much the same category, Al-
most two regiments of the Fifth 
Marine Division at Camp Pen-
dleton are in pretty good 
shape, and there are smaller 
units of various types around 
the country that could be 
brought up to strength fairly 
quickly. 
The experience level�par-
ticularly in officers and non-
coms�and the logistical and 
support the Seventh Army in 
Germany have dropped appre-
ciably since the start of the 
Vietnam fighting. In Korea, the 
Second and Seventh Infantry 
Divisions are short of -helicop-
ters, some signal equipment 
and other items. 
Don't wag your tongue at 
random at this table after 
proof of a 'Most overt and 
vicious provocation and the 
aggressive acts committed by 
your side in the DMZ and in 
our coastal waters has been 
exposed to the whole world. 
If your side has any slight-
est intention to preserve the 
Korean armistice, don't ride 
roughshod but draw due les-
sons from . . . the doom of 
a large armed spy ship which 
was captured recently by our 
side while sneaking into our 
coastal waters. When the 
real state of your serious 
crime has been exposed to 
the world, all you have to do 
is to admit military provocaL 
tions and aggressive acts 
committed by your side, 
apologize ,for them, and as-
sure this table that you will 
not recommit Such criminal 
acts.

II is not the strategic picture 
in Asia that is changing but 
the Administration itself. On 
the basis of the intelligence re-

trying to open up a "second

of reliable reports from knowl-

basic change in the Govern-

war as before. 
Reserves' Call-Up 
The call-up of 14.600 Air 
Reserves and Naval and Air 
Support units' is not necessary 
to deal with the Pueblo inci-
dent. The call-up may be useful 
in supporting our diplomatic 
efforts to get the ship and its

Administration has been under 
pressure to call these reserves 
for Vietnam, and that is where 
they are likely to be used in 
the end. 
Nevertheless, the optimism 
JANUARY 1968 
An Air of Cris' 
or the Pre-Christmas period is 
� now g:ving way in uneasiness 
for a micty of reasons. The 
enemy is obviously building up 
for a major assault on the 
U.S. Marine base at Khesanh 
near the demilitarized zone, 
and apparently has managed in 
bring up some large artillery 
guns for the purpose. The ex-
pectation here is that this may 
produce the biggest battle of 
the war in about a week, right 
after the Tct truer. 
In addition, the crash of an 
Air Force plane in Greenland 
with four 1-1-bombs aboard, the 
pressure on the dollar and the 
U.S. balance of payments 
abroad, the announcement that 
the British are pulling out of 
Malaysia and the Persian Gulf 
�all these in recent days have 
made people aware of the com-
plexity and danger of Ameri-
ca's military and. economic 
problems across the globe. 
None of these events has 
changed anything fundamen-
tally, but they have made an 
edgy capital conscious of the 
possibilities of change. What if 
the Communists were bringing 
up new and longer-range weap-
ons into the battle? What if 
they did create new diversion-
ary guerrilla fronts along the 
vast Communist borderland 
from North Korea, through 
Laos, and Afghanistan to the 
to Phubai as a general reserve. 
Thus in all of the I Corps 
area, there :ire 137,900 allied 
troops, including 34 battalions 
of the South Vietnamese Army 
plus militia units with 55.00.0 
men, and other military forces: 
21 United States Marine bat-
talions. including 2 aboard ships 
of the Seventh Fleet: ISru-
mor,. United States Army hal� 
talkins, and a brigade of 4 
hattalionS of Korean marines. 
Of this total, about 10 Unit� 
el States Marine �battalions, 
plus man' supporting units�
mtaling 2.0,000 marines�are in 
Quangtri Province. 
The headquarters of the 20t1, 
Marine Regiment is dug in 
near Ehesanh, a western flank 
position iif the demilitarized 
zone's defenses. 7 miles from 
the Laotian border and IR stiles 
south of the zone. 
The Marines hold three key 
hills around � Khesanh � 991 
North, 881 South and 861. 
designated according to their 
heights in meters. The hills 
command the valley approach 
from Laos along Route 9. 
At least 5,000 to 6,000 ma-
rines man positions in the 
Khesanh area. Others, along 
v.,ith the South Vietnamese 
First Division, hold positions 
extending along Route 9 and to 
the North of it, east and west. 
of Route 1 and along Route 561 
between Camlo and Conthien. 
The positions extend from the 
sea at the Cua Viet to Giolinh, 
Dongha, Conthien and Camlo, 
and then to Khesanh, the Rock-

the site of an allied camp two

WASIIPGTON PCST � 26 JANUARY 1968 gip 
Soviet reaction RAtrained 
Soviet dilute the American focus on 
By Anatole Slush
Wishing-ton Post Foreign Service 
MOSCOW, Jan. 25 � Soviet 
commentators today compared 
the Pueblo affair to the Ton-
kin Gulf incident of August. 
1964, which brought on the 
first American bombing of 
North Vietnam. They also 
linked the adventures of the 
spy ship to both the B-52 crash 
in Greenland and events in 
Southeast Asia as evidence of 
Washington's "provocative" 
and "dangerous" course. 
Soviet press comment was 
on the whole restrained, con-
sisting mainly of relaying 
facts and opinions from The 
Washington Post, New York 
Times and other Western 
newspapers and press agen-
cies. 
The press appeared to be 
half a day behind events, 
which is not unusual here, and 
offered little evidence that the 
Soviet leaders have yet. 
banded down a firm line on the. 
Thus, tonight's lzvestia left! 
it to New York correspondent! 
S. Kondrashov to compare the; 
"highly strung, nervous atmos-. 
phere" in Washington to the 
time of the attack on the U.S. i 
destroyer Maddox in the Ton-! 
kin Gulf. 
Tass, in a long account by ; 
Moscow commentator Igor 
Orlov, eoncentrated on the 
"angry reaction of world opin-
ion," recalled the U-2 case and 
similar spy incidents, and said 
the Pueblo affair "should be 
taken together" with "the in-
vasion of neutral Cambodia by 
American troops" and the B-52 
accident. 
Intense Interest 
While Soviet media showed 
no signs of attempting to fan 
a crisis atmosphere, Moscow 
observers had little doubt of 
the Kremlin's intense interest 
in the outcome of the affair. 
The Soviet Union is linked to 
North Korea by a mutual se-
curity treaty, and North Korea 
has in recent months played a 
key role in Soviet maneuvers 
within the world Communist 
movement. , 
The Soviet-North Korean 
treaty, signed in .1961 and 
valid until 1971, declares that 
If one of the parties "is ex-
posed- to an armed attack" the 
other pasty "will immediately 
render military assistance 
with the help of all the means 
at its disposal." 
Within the world Commu-
nist movement, the North Ko-
reans had been considered 
pro-Chinese until Peking 
launched its Cultural Revolu-
tion in July, 1966. Patient 
wooing by the Soviet Union 
since that time, and particu-
larly in recent months, has 
brought fair results. 
Friendship 
North Korea was � repre-
sented, although not at sum-' 
mit level, at Moscow's 50th an-
niversary celebrations last No-
vember. The Soviet leaders' 
have also gone to considerable � 
lengths in the hope of obtain-
ing North Korean participa-
tion in next month's Budapest 
international communist "con-
sultative meeting" and in the 
big world conference that the 
Russians hope will follow: 
For example, the Soviet 
leaders deliberately renounced 
any hope of Yugoslav partici-
pation in those meetings 
largely because that would 
make North Korean attend-
ance impossible, The North 
Koreans still resent Yogosla-
via's support for the United; 
Nations effort in the Korean; 
war (which coincided with thel 
Stalin-Tito conflict), and duni 
tog their long pro-Chinese; 
phase they firmly condemned! 
Yogoslav "revisionism." 
Still another price the Sol 
viet Union appears to havei 
paid for partly weaning North! 
Korea away from China has. 
been a muting of Russia's dia-
logue with Japan. There havei 
been numerous indications, 
since last summer that move-
ment toward a big Soviet-Japa 
nese deal � possibly including! 
a peace treaty, return of some: 
small islands to Japan, and 
major Japanese investments! 
in Siberia � has been slowed! 
down partly to appease North! 
Korea, which is involved m 
several disputes with the Japa-
nese. 
Moscow Follows 
These and other signs of 
North Korea's special place in 
Soviet calculations appear to 
indicate that Moscow is in-
clined to follow, rather than 
lead. Pyongyang in the Pueblo 
incident. That was the case on � 
Tuesday, when Soviet Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vassily Kuz-
netsov told American Ambas-
sador Llewellyn Thompson; 
that Moscow would not inter-I 
cede with Pyongyang, and that 
the United States should ad-, 
dress its inquiries directly to j 
the North Koreans. 
This state of affairs could be, 
promising or dangerous, de-' 
pending on the North Koreans! 
and the United States. 
Should the North Koreans 
devise a face-saving compro-
mise, such as 'keeping the' 
'Pueblo while releasing its 
crew, the Soviet Union would 
certainly be among the first to 
applaud. But should honor and 
pride in Pyongyang and Wash-
ington bring on � a second Ko-
rean war, the Soviet Union, a 
thermonuclear power, bound 
by treaty .and .a common fron-
tier to North Korea, would be 
placed in a much more diffi-
cult position than by the con-
flict in Vietnam. 
I News agencies reported 
these foreign reactions to the 
; Pueblo seizure and related 
events: 
The . et news agency 
-Tass termed the U.S. cation 
,of 14,600 reserve airmen a 
� "threatening act." 
j British Prime Minister Wil-
son, just -back from an official 
'visit to Moscow, said the Unit-
ed States did not ask him to 
'discuss the incident while he 
was there. "St did not seem 
:appropriate to raise rt and I 
had not been asked to do so," 
toitson said. 
London's Foreign Office "de-

said it was convinced the Pueb-1

while declaring that there was I 
no legal justification for the: 
capture, cautioned that "there 
should be no reason in prin-
ciple why the seizure . . . 
should lead to a males- inter-
national crisis." 
There was still no official

pressure might be used to bring a 
pressure on the North Koreans 
and their allies. 
In the last few years, both 
civilians like Dr. Herman Kahn, 
the author of a number of stud-
ies of escalation, and military 
leaders like Gen. Maxwell Tay-
lor, who developed the policy of 
"flexible response," have writ-
ten volumes on the options the 
President has in reacting to al-
most any emergency. 
These studies, now thoroughly 
incorporated into the Pentagon's 
basic milker, strategy, are un-
doubtedly being relied upon as 
the President, his civilian 
advisers and the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff try to devise a method 
for getting the ship and crew 
back with the least possible 
difficulty. 
In Kahn's studies, the seizure 
of a ship in international waters 
ranks very high up the scale of 
military escalation. But the situ-
ation would obviously be vastly 
more grave if the seizure had 
been undertaken by the Soviet 
Union rather than one of the 
smallest nations in the Commu-
nist bloc. 
Before today's announcement 
and the further hint that some 
ground forces may be called to 
active duty, the U.S. already 
climbed a significant number of 
rungs up the ladder of escala-
tion. It moved both diplo-
maitcally�with apparently un-
successful attempts to enlist the 
aid of the Soviet Union�and 
militarily, with the dispatch of 
a nuclear task force headed by 
the carrier U.S.S. Enterprise to 
the Sea of Japan. This force is 
reported now about 200 miles 
off the Korean coast. This is 
bers as hostages. 
Under the theory of escalation, 
these steps should be taken 
quite rapidly, with a pause after 
each step to see if the North 
Koreans are ready to give the 
ship tack, 
In tkeory, the North Koreans 
should be made to believe that 
the U.S. is prepared to use all 
necessary force to get the ship 
back�even eventual use of nu-
clear weapons. If they really be-
lieve this, the theory goes, they 
will accede to the U.S. demands 
at a low point on the escalation 
ladder rather than at a high. 
point. 
One of the most awkward diffi-
culties facing Johnson and his. 
advisers is that the North Ko-� 
reans might not believe the U.S. 
is willing to risk war over one 
little boat�and it might re-
quire a number of steps up the 
escalation ladder before they be-
come "believers." 
Johnson's options and those of 
military commanders in the 
field were severely limited at 
the very beginning of the Pueblo 
incident because no one appar-
ently realized in time that the 
harrassment of the Pueblo by 
North Korean patrol boats � 
something that happens fre-
quently in many parts of the 
world � would suddenly turn 
into a seizure.

court-martialed. The -ship was 
the Chesapeake in 1812. 
Reasons for Incident 
Some of the reasons for the 
incident can now be disclosed: 
�The commander did not call 
for help because he thought the 
North Koreans were bluffing. 
He didn't dream there would be 
a Communist seizure of an 
American naval vessel in inter-
national waters, so didn't take 
the warning seriously. 
Actually, there were two 
hours. in which he. could have 
called for help, and there were 
about a hundred. Air Force 
fighters and fighter bombers in 
both South Korea and Japan 
which could have responded at 
a moment's notice. 
Bucher did not finally scuttle 
the ship when he saw the North 
Koreans coming alongside with 
boarded and called for help has 
not been answered. 
But Pentagon officials who de-
clined to be quoted by name said 
that even if properly armed 
fighter planes had been close 
enough to have gone to the aid of 
the Pueblo, a number of other 
factors would have been consid-
ered. These include weather, the 
amount of remaining daylight, 
the position of the ship at the 
time help arrived, and, especial-
ly, potential enemy reaction. 
The decision not to go to the 
aid of the Pueblo was made 
somewhere in the military chain 
of command short of Washing-
ton, these Pentagon officials 
said. 
But they did not say how high 
up the chain that decision was 
made. 
The incident began abgut 10 
p.m. Washington time Monday. 
Pentagon officials said Bucher 
did not request help until 11:45 
p.m. when the North Koreans 
moved to board the Pueblo. 
Thus, by the time President 
Johnson, Secretary of State 
Dean Rusk and Defense Secre-
tary Robert S. McNamara were 
awakened between 12:23 and 2 
a.m. Tuesday, the Pueblo was 
already in North Korean hands. 
The question they faced � and 
still face � was not how to pre-
vent the seizure of the vessel, 
but how to get her back again.

Looking for Subs 
�The Pueblo was off the Ko.1 
rean Coast to locate Russian' 
nuclear submarines out of Via-: 
divostok. Russia has 350 sub-
marines,- of which 40 are nu-
clear, and we have refined de-
vices which can not only locate 
them but tell what kind of ves-
sels they are. 
Actually she was not 25 miles 
off the North Korean coast, as 
officials state, but 16 miles, 
which is four miles outside the 
I2-mile limit which North Korea 
claims. The United States does 
not recognize this limit. 
The Russian navy uses fish-
ing trawlers to do exactly the 
same type of spying on our 
Polaris submarines as we do on 
them. Their trawlers are lo-
cated off the Florida coast. 
where they watch missiles fired 
from Cape Kennedy; off Rota, 
the big U. S. naval base in 
Spain: Holy Loch, the American 
base in Scotland; and off Guam 
in the mid-Pacific. 
Both the Soviet and the Amer-
ican strategy is to try to locate 
nuclear submarines which nor-
mally lie for about 30 days at a 
time off the potential enemy's 
coast. 
  Limitation on Subs 
The Polaris missiles on our 
nuclear submarines and the mis-
siles on the Russian submarines 
must be calibrated, before they 
leave port, in order to hit cer-
tain targets on land, It is im-
possible to change the calibra-
tion after a submarine starts its 
cruise. Therefore the missiles 
must be fired after the sub 
reaches certain exact spots un-
der the ocean where it lies on* 
guard for periods of about 30 
days. It is important for each 
nation, therefore, in its game of 
submarine hide-and-seek, to lo-
cate these spots, in which case 
the sub could be knocked out of 
commission the minute war 
breaks. 
�The reason for seizing the 
Pueblo was the North Korean 
policy, which it has urged on 
other Communist nations, of 
diversionary tactics. North Ko-
rean Premier. Kim II-Sung has 
argued that the best way to help 
the North Vietnamese is to di-
vert American worry to prob-
lems elsewhere in the world. To 
this end North Korea has insti-
gated well over 500 incidents 
along the border between North 
and South Korea during 1967

-ecret equipment 
on Pueblo destroyed? 
By licorge W. Ashworth 
� 
The capture of the USS Pueblo by North 
Korean patrol craft could be of long-range 
d a ma ge to the United States intelhgenee 
effort. 
The captain, Comdr. Lloyd M. Bucher. re-
ported that he had untiurtn:ien the destruc-
tion of secret material and equipment aboard 
the craft. It was not known. however, just 
how successful that effort was. 
What remains could bu of substantial in-
terest to Communist-bloc ilut;ons. Portions 
of the ship of potential intyrest could not 
be destroyed. .And careful study of the de-
bris from the area of destruction well may 
be useful, sources here agree. 
It is significant that many of the crew 
members of the Pueblo have high security 
clearances which might preclude their pres-
ence in West Berlin or other areas near 
Communist-bloc nations. Nov:, through seiz-
ure, they are all available to Communist 
a gent s. 
Korean front flares 
Many observers believe the capture of 
the crew members could be a greater loss, 
in terms of the intelligence effort, than the 
rapture of the ship off the North Korean 
city of Wonsan. 
Sources here agree that the longer the 
North Koreans have the Pueblo and its 
crow in hand the greater is the potential 
loss. 
As tension continued following the seizure 
of the Pueblo, North Koreans attempted to 
break through the American sector of the 
Korean front. Eight United States soldiers 
were wounded. 
Communist infiltrators also attacked a 
watchtower just south of the demilitarized 
zone with hand grenades but caused no dam-
age, according to United States Army 
spokesmen. All the infiltrators were re-
pulsed. 
Soviet armaments studied 
Foreign Minister Kyu-Ha Choi announced 
that South Korea would send a note to 
United Nations Secretary-General U Thant 
condemning the provocative actions by 
North Korea as a violation of the Korean 
armistice agreement. 
The United States learned a great deal 
about Soviet equipment in the aftermath of 
the Arab-Israeli war when captured arma-
ments were given a close scrutiny by United 
Slates officers. 
418 
The Pueblo incident could provide the 
Communist bloc v ith an opportunity to learn 
nearly as much as the United States did last 
summer but in the more crucial and sensi-
tive area of electronic detection. 
This was the second time within a year 
that a United Slates intelligence-collection 
vessel has been attacked. Last June the 
Liberty. a similar American "spy" ship, 
was attacked and heavily damaged by 
Israelis in the Mediterranean during the 
Egypt-Israel confrontation. 
The situation is far different now. If the 
destruction effort was not completely suc-
cessful and if the Pueblo is kept for any 
great length of time, the Communist bloc 
stands to know far more than most informed 
Americans do about intelligence vessels. 
Presumably, the Communist blocs would 
have experts available to inspect the ship. 
This would mean that they would know well 
what they were looking at. As a result, 
the Communist nations would be able to 
assess United States sophistication and 
capabilities in naval-intelligence-gathering 
methods. 
Both the Soviets and the United States 
operate large intelligence-gathering opera-
tions. The United States has three ships 
the size of the Pueblo and five similar to 
the Liberty. 
Liberty, Pueblo compared 
Sources here say there are several essen-
tial differences between the Liberty and 
the Pueblo in terms of capability and mis-
sion. 
The Liberty has a large number of ana-
lysts aboard to assess the information gath-
ered. whereas much of the information gar-
nered by the Pueblo is sent on to higher 
headquarters and to Washington for study. 
Apparently, the Liberty is capable of a 
more comprehensive effort than the much 
smaller Pueblo. But they are assigned 
somewhat different tasks. 
The Pueblo is able to check carefully the 
movements of ships within a range of per-
haps 50 miles around. Its sophisticated 
equipment is able to tell just from the 
sounds what kind of ship is being monitored. 
The Pueblo apparently is equipped to 
eavesdrop on conversations on nearby land 
areas, as well as upon airplanes, surface 
ships, and submarines. Tape recording 
equipment is available to make records of 
material for later study and analysis.

CALLS FRENCH 
NATO PULLOUT 
'PREMATURE' 
PARIS, Jan. 25 'RD�Charles 
Bohlen, outgoing United States 
ambassador to France, today 
warned that France's military 
pullout from the North Atlantic 
Treaty organization may have 
been "wishful thinking" on that 
nations part because the Soviet 
Union may not have abandoned 
designs in Europe. 
"It is a little premature to 
assume that the detente of the 
last five years is permanent," 
Bohlen said in a farewell 
speech to members of the 
American business community 
in France. 
"I would like to see a few 
more signs that the Soviet 
Union is really interested in 
abandoning designs on reshap-
ing Europe." He urged other 
European nations not to aban-
don their defense policies "on 
wishful thinking," and noted 
that the United States in-
tended to "act cautiously" con-
cerning maintaining a defense 
posture in Europe.

Russia's Policy 
It is not believed that 'Moscow 
entirely shares this viewpoint, 
nor that it had any knowledge 
of North Korean plans to seize 
the Pueblo. � 
There is a clique in the Krem-
lin, however, which is known to 
believe that the only way to 
pressure the United States into 
giving up the war in Vietnam 
is by applying pressure in other 
parts of the world, such as the 
Near East. The buildup of Rus-
sian naval forces in the Medi-
terranean, and the tremendous 
concentration of Soviet arms in 
Egypt and Syria. together with 
Russian moves to take over 
Britain's declining presence east 
of Suez, are believed to be part 
of this pressure strategy. 
With or without Kremlin ap-
proval, it is believed there will 
be more diversionary tactics 
against the United States as the 
war in South Vietnam intensi-
fies. 
Under discussion In the De-
fense Department has been re-
taliatory action against the 
Soviet Union. Among other 
things, the question of seizing 
Soviet trawlers off the Ameri-
can coast has been proposed. 
Also under. discussion has been 
the strategy of asking General-
issimo Franco, of Spain, who 
has plenty of Soviet electronic 
trawlers tying off Rota, to haul 
one of them into port. Franco, 
however, has recently been 
getting cozy with Moscow, and 
he might not make the move. 
Different Mission 
The Pueblo was a different 
kind of ship than the Liberty, 
badly battered, with 31 men 
killed, by Israel patrol boats 
and fighter planes last June. 
The Liberty. operated by the 
National Security Agency, was 
lying mere than 15 miles off the 
Egyptian coast intercepting 
messages exchanged between 
Israeli forces and their corn-
mend posts, and between Egyp-
tian forces and their commands. 
�: Although Israelis claimed the 
attack on the Liberty was a .case 
:of mistaken identity, there was 
a deep suspicion in the Navy 
.1Department that the attack was 
.deliberate. 
; The Pueblo was operated by 
' the Navy itself, not the National 
Security Ageerv. art' was rnt 
engaged in intercepting mes-
sages. 
Planes Urged 
The Army has issued an "ur-
gent" request to commercial 
firms to help in the job of re-
pairing and maintaining the 
growing Army fleet of airplanes 
and helicopters. 
The request was issued by the 
Army Aviation Material Com-
mand in St. Louis, Mo. 
Cal. Clifton 0. Duty, director 
of procurement and production 
for the command, said in a tele-
phone interview that the amount 
of such work done for the army 
million at the end of 1967. 
The need for more commer-
cial help, Duty said, � is caused 
both by the growing numbers of 
army aircraft and by the wear 
and tear and battle damage in 
Vietnam. 
For some extensive repair 
work. Duty said, it is necessary 
to bring the aircraft back to the 
'United States where heavy ma-
chine tools are available.

President Johnson took a 
classic step up the escalation 
ladder today in his efforts to 
impress upon the North Koreans 
his intention to get the C;SS 
Pueblo and her crew returned. 
The call-up of 14,600 Air 
Force, Navy and Air National 
Guard reservists was almost 
identically the same as Presi-
dent Kennedy's action during 
the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. 
The call-up--the first move 
in a wide range of military 
steps available to the Presi-
dent�was undoubtedly design-
ed to reinforce Johnson's diplo-
matic efforts to get the ship 
back. 
� In testimony before the Sen-
' ate Armed Services Committee 
today, Clark M. Clifford, the 
President's choice as new sec-
retary of defense, emphasized 
that most of the military ac-
tions which have been suggest-
ed in connection with the Pueb-
lo incident would not guaran-
tee the safe return of the cap-
tured crewmen thus emphasiz-
ing the importance of diplomat-
ic efforts. 
If the initial diplomatic ef-
forts fail, however, the Presi-
dent has other military options 
that might be used to bring 
pressure on the North Koreans 
and their allies: 
In the last few years, both 
civilians like Dr. Herman Kahn, 
the author of a number of stud-
ies of escalation, and military 
leaders like Gen. Maxwell Tay-
lor, who developed the policy of 
"flexible response," have writ-
ten volumes on the options the 
President has in reacting to al-
most any emergency. 
These studies, now thoroughly 
incorporated into the Pentagon's 
basic militar, strategy, are un-
doubtedly being relied upon as 
the President, his civilian 
advisers and the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff try to devise a method 
for getting the ship and crew 
back with the least possible-
difficulty. 
In Kahn's studies, the seizure 
of a ship in international waters 
ranks very high up the scale of 
military escalation. But the situ-
� ation would obviously be vastly 
more grave if the seizure had 
been undertaken by the Soviet 
Union rather than one of the 
smallest nations in the Commu-
nist bloc. 
Before today's announcement 
and the further hint that some 
ground forces may be called to 
active duty. the U.S. already 
climbed a significant number of 
� rungs up the ladder of escala-
tion. It moved both diplo-
- maitcally�with apparently un-
- successful attempts to enlist the 
aid of the Soviet Union�and 
- militarily, with the dispatch of 
a nuclear task force headed by 
the carrier U.S.S. Enterprise to 
the Sea of Japan. This force is 
reported now about 200 miles 
off the Korean coast. This is

If diplomatic efforts fail en-
tirely � and it is not yet clear 
that they are going to fail � the 
Ulm,: of escalation would call 
for the application of military 
pressure in small increments. 
One such might simply be a 
show of force�positioning the 
Enterprise visibly in interne-
tioal waters off the port of Won-
san, for example, 
Another might be an action 
matched to that of the North 
Koreans�perhaps the seizure of 
one of their boats. This kind of 
action could not be matched ex-
actly to the North Korean action 
because their navy doesn't have 
any ships as large as the Pueblo 
�an illustration of the difficul-
ties a "superpower" has in deal-
ing with a very small nation. 
Slightly higher up the scale 
might he the desteuction of some 
piece of North Korean property 
of the approximate value of the 
Pueblo. A coastal rear station 
might be shelled, for example. 
Extremely unlikely in these 
early steps would be any effort 
to send Navy or Marine units 
into the port of Wonsan to take 
blck the ship by force � cape. 
cially while the North Koreans 
have the Pueblo's crew mem-
bers as hostages. 
Under the theory of escalation, 
these steps should be taken 
quite rapidly, with a pause after 
each step to see if the North 
Koreans are ready to give the 
ship tack. 
In tl,eory, the North Koreans 
should be made to believe that 
the V.S. is prepared to use all 
necessary force to get the ship 
back�even eventual use of nu-
clear weapons. If they really be-
lieve this, the theory goes, they 
will accede to the U.S. demands 
at a low point on the escalation 
ladder rather than at a high: 
point. 
One of the most awkward diffi-
culties facing Johnson and his: 
advisers is that the North Ko-
reans might not believe the U.S. 
is willing to risk war over one 
little boat�and it might re-
quire a number of steps up the 
escalation ladder before they be-
come "believers." . 
Johnson's options and those of 
military commanders in the 
field were severely limited at 
the very beginning of the Pueblo 
incident because no one appar-
ently realized in time that the 
harrassment of the Pueblo by 
North Korean patrol boats � 
something that happens fre-
quently in many parts of the 
world would suddenly turn 
into a seizure.

ered. whereas much of the information gar-
nered by the Pueblo is sent on to higher 
headquarters and to Washington for study. 
Apparently, the Liberty is capable of a 
more comprehensive effort than the much 
smaller Pueblo. But they are assigned 
somewhat different tasks. � 
The Pueblo is able to check carefully the 
movements of ships within a range of per-
haps 50 miles around. Its sophisticated 
equipment is able to tell just from the 
sounds what kind of ship is being monitored. 
The Pueblo apparently is equipped to 
eavesdrop on conversations on nearby land 
areas, as well as upon airplanes, surface 
ships, and submarines. Tape recording 
equipment is available to make records of 
material for later study and analysis.

CALLS FRENCH 
NATO PULLOUT 
'PREMATURE' 
PARIS, Jan. 25 OD�Charles 
Bohlen, outgoing United States 
ambassador to France, today 
warned that France's military 
pullout from the North Atlantic 
Treaty organization may have 
been "wishful thinking" on that 
nations part because the Soviet 
Union may not have abandoned 
designs in Europe. 
"It is a little premature to 
assume that the detente of the 
last five years is permanent." 
Bohlen said in a farewell 
speech to members of the 
American business community 
in France. 
"I would like to see a few 
more signs that the Soviet 
Union is really interested in 
abandoning designs on reshap-
ing Europe." He urged other 
European nations not to aban-
don their defense policies "on 
wishful thinking," and noted 
that the United States in-
tended to "act cautiously" con-
cerning maintaining a defense 
posture in Europe.

Private Help 
To Fix Army 
Planes Urged 
The Army has issued an "ur-
gent" request to commercial 
firms to help in the job of re-
pairing and maintaining the 
growing Army fleet of airplanes 
and helicopters. 
The request was issued by the 
Army Aviation Material Com-
mand Mo.

of procurement and production 
for the command, said in a tele-
phone interview that the amount 
of such work done for the army

lective blows In the United 
States in all regions." 
Russia's Policy 
It is not believed that Moscow 
entirely shares this viewpoint, 
nor that it had any knowledge 
of North Korean plans to seize 
the Pueblo. 
There is a clique in the Krem-
lin. however, which is known to 
believe that the only way to 
pressure the United States into 
giving up the war in Vietnam 
is by applying pressure in other 
parts of the world, such as the 
Near East. The buildup of Rus-
sian naval forces in the Medi-
terranean, and the tremendous 
concentration of Soviet arms in 
Egypt and Syria, together with 
Russian moves to take over 
Britain's declining presence east 
of Suez, are believed to be part 
of this pressure strategy. 
With or without Kremlin ap-
proval, it is believed there will 
be more diversionary tactics 
against the United States as the 
war in South Vietnam intensi-
fies. . 
Under discussion in the De-
fense Department has been re-
taliatory action against the 
Soviet Union. Among other 
things, the question of seizing 
Soviet trawlers off the Ameri-
can coast has been proposed. 
Also under. discussion has been 
the strategy of asking General-
issimo Franco, of Spain, who 
has plenty of Soviet electronic 
trawlers lying off Rota, to haul 
one of them into port. Franco, 
however, has recently been 
getting cozy with Moscow, and 
he might not make the move. 
Different Mission 
The Pueblo was a different 
kind of ship than the Liberty, 
badly battered, with 31 men 
killed, by Israel patrol boats 
and fighter planes last June.. 
The Liberty, operated by the 
National Security Agency, was 
lying more than 15 miles off the 
Egyptian coast intercepting 
messages exchanged between 
Israeli forces and their com-
mand posts, and between Egyp-
tian forces and their commands. 
. Although Israelis claimed the 
!attack on the Liberty was a case 
. of mistaken identity, there was 
! a deep suspicion in the Navy 
Department that the attack was 
deliberate. 
The Pueblo was operated by 
the Navy itself, not the National

The need for more commer-
cial help, Duty said, is caused 
both by the growing numbers of 
army aircraft and by the wear 
and tear and battle damage in 
Vietnam. 
For some extensive repair 
work, Duty said, it is necessary 
to bring the aircraft back to the 
United States where heavy ma-
chine tools are available. 
Duty said that by the end of 
next year he eXpects more than 
half of the army's repair and 
maintenance to be farmed out to 
private concerns.

Mr. Johnson, when Picsident 
Johnson, asked that serve, 
he did not place any limita-
tion. and I might say I am 
ready and prepared to serve 
for whatever length of time 
he chooses me to do so. 
Q. You realize better than 
most of our people that the 
Congress, if it is to legislate 
effectively in the field of 
national defense, it is nec-
essary that we have the full 
and unintimidated views of 
the senior military officers. 
particularly the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. Can you assure the 
committee that these officers 
will. not be discouraged from 
giving the committee their 
real views or not be penal-
ized for giving their real 
views, even when they are in 
conflict with your views or 
those of the President? 
A. I would intend to make 
that the policy of the De-
partment of Defense: that 
when this committee calls 
upon members of the military 
to testify before it, they 
shall be permitted to give 
their frank and open opinions 
on those subjects inquired 
into by this committee. 
Q. You have been rather 
close to the .Department of 
Defense over the last seven 
years. Do you have any re-
maining doubt. about the au-
thority of the Secretary of 
defense to control the deci-
sions of the department or 
the subdivisions thereof? 
A. No sir. These last seven 
years have been an interest-
ing illustration of the ability 
of the Secretary to utilize the 
powers that presently exist 
in order to make the prin-
cipal decisions, that is, of
course, along with the Presi-
dent of theLlnited States. 
Q. Could you give us just 
a brief statement as to your 
concept of the proper rela-
tions with the committee of 
Congress in this field and the 
obligations of a Secretary of 
Defense to those committees 
to enable them to perform 
their function?. 
A. I would expert that as 
Secretary of Defense I would 
have the closest type of co-
operation with the appropri-
ate committees of the Con-
gress. I believe that at this 
particular time in our coun-

perhaps, more necessary than

CLIFFORD 'S TESTIMONY 
They have no hope in the 
French. The British are with-
drawing from Malaysia and 
Singapore. If it were not for 
the United States there would 
be -no hope there, and others 
will have different opinions, 
but to me it is not a question 
of years, it is a question of 
weeks and months, if we 
weren't there until Southeast 
Asia, nation by nation, suc-
cumbed,. and that is not hap-
pening now, and it is not 
happening, in my opinion, be-
cause we are there, and be-
cause we have extended this 
shield, and I believe we must 
continue to do it. 
Q. Mr. Clifford, are you 
satisfied with the way the 
war is being conducted now? 
And I think a yes. or no an-
swer would suffice and I 
don't wish to ask you to go 
into specifics. I think I can 
- understand why you prefer 
not to. .A.�Well, I thank you 
for the latter comment be-
. cause my answer is yes. 
Q. There isn't any doubt 
in .your mind. Mr. Clifford, 
that a cessation of bombing 
under present circumstances 
would lead to more casualties 
on our side and the side of 
our allies than . would other-
wise take place, is there? 
A. When you preface your 
question by saying under 
present circumstances I agree. 
Under present circumstances 
when the North Vietnamese 
are willing to make no con-
cessions whatsoever for a 
cessation of the bombing I 
.agree.--It is nay hope that the 
-time will come, and the 
sooner the. better, that the 
North -Vietnamese will indi-
cate some reciprocal action. 
We have not asked for much. 
The President hasp laced it 
at abingt an irreducible mini-
mum. -HE has said, "If you 
--- Continued 
will agree to talk promptly, 
if you will also not to take 
advantage of the suspension 
we will stop the bombing." 
It seems to me this Is a mini-
mal requirement. They have 
chosen not to do it. My hope 
is that they soon will, and 
I should he the first, and 
maybe as happy as anyone, 
to see the bombing stopped. 
But in my opinion it can't 
stop with their present 
wholly and completely in-
transigent attitude. 
SENATOR (HOWARD W.) 
CANNON. It has been widely 
reported that the Defense 
Department planners have 
considered several military 
options that are open to the 
United States, should the 
diplomatic efforts to free the 
Pueblo fail. Among those un-
der most consideration, ac-
cording to the reports, are 
an attempt to storm the 
Wonsan harbor and forcibly 
retrieve the vessel; seizure or 
destruction of one or more 
North Korean ships as retali-
ation, or for potential bar-
gaining power; aerial bomb-
ing and sinking of the Pueblo 
at the Woman docks to deny 
Communist counter-intelli-
gence teams any further ac-
cess to any electronic. intel-
ligence-gathering equipment 
that may be on board, or a 
Naval blockade of Wonsan 
and:, . perhaps, other North 
Korean ports. 
Now, do I take it from 
your answer to Senator 
Smith that you do not prefer 
to discuss any of the alterna-
tives that might be available 
to the United .States in view 
of the fact that they are still 
under active consideration? 
A. Yes, that would be my 
answer end must of neces-
sity, be my answer, Senator. 
I would say only that I know 
the President Ismakingevery 
effort to find a diplomatic 
solution because if one will 
analyze those courses of ac-
tion which you have just 
enumerated, none of those 
get our 83 men back, and the 
President would like very 
much to get those 83 Ameri-
cans out of the hands of the 
North Koreans and get them 
back. and I believe that he 
will make every effort along 
the diplomatic front to 
achieve that purpose. 
Q. Is it a fact, then, that 
in your opinion any overt 
military move which we 
might be able to take now 
could very likely ieopardize 
the safety and lives of the 
men on the Pueblo? A. That 
is entirely possible, and I 
think that the President must 
be convinced that he has 
exhausted the diplomatic al-
ternative before any other 
action is taken. 
Q. Without getting into 
possible solutions to the 
problem. I would like to ask, 
in view of what has hao-
pended, whether ' or not It 
would be your intention-upon 
taking office to immediately 
review the decision-making 
process and the authorities 
granted that would permit a 
lightly armed U.S. ship, with:. 
out protection, to sail close 
to hostile shores even though 
in international waters? 
A. The answer to that 
would be a simple :.yes." I 
believe that the policy in that 
regard should be examined 
with meticulous care and 
might very well be re-eval-
uated. 
SENATOR (sTitOM) THuIV 
MOND: When you gooks of 
negotiating, in that case you 
would be willing to have a 
cessation of bombing. I pre-
sume that thatwould contem-
plate that they would stop 
their military activities, too, 
84..we would be expected to 
have a cessation of bombing. 
A. No, that is not what . I 
said. I do not expect them to 
stop their military activities. 
I would expect to follow the 
language of the President 
when he -said that if they 
would agree to start-negotia-
tions promptly and not take 
advantage of the pause.in the 
bombing. 
Q. What do you mean by 
taking advantage if they conk 
sinus their military activities? 
A. Their military activity 
will continue in South Viet-
nam. I assume, until there is 
a cease fire- agreed upon. I 
assume that they will con-
tinue to transport the normal 
amount of goods, munitions, 
men, to South Vietnam. I as-
sume that we will continue 
to maintain our forces and 
support our forces during 
that period. So what I am 
suggesting is, in the language 
of the President, that he 
would insist that they not 
take advantage of the sus-
pension of the bombing. 
Q. How would you keep 
them from taking advantage 
if we had a- cessation of 
bombing? A. There is no way 
to - keep them from taking 
advantage. If they state they 
are going to refrain from tak-
ing advantage, and then re-
fuse to do so, then they have 
not met their agreement, and 
the conditions for the nego-
tiations have failed. 
Q. And then, if they did 
violate that, you would favor 
then resuming bombing, I 
would presume. 
A. I would assume we 
would have no alternative. 
If they did not meet their 
obligations or we do not meet 
our obligations, then I assume 
there is absolutely no sense 
in negotiating. It would be a 
useless task. To negotiate 
there has to be good faith if 
any result is to be achieved 
and if. during the negotia-
tions, bad faith is-evidenced 
then there is no need to Ile-
eotiate.

NEW YORK POST 25 
For Mr. Clifford by WILLIAM k: . BUCKLEY JR. 
You will have noticed that Mr. Clark Clifford, our forthcom-
ing Secretary of Defense, has been coy on the question whether 
he is a hawk or a dove, disdaining, as he put it, "such ornitho-
logical categories." But the wise men in Washington tell us that 
he is convinced of the rightness of the Veitnam war, and Indeed 
it is unlikely that President Johnson would have appointed to 
tit at his left hand someone who substantially disagreed with 
him on so important a question. . 
It has even been whispered that Mr. Clifford will pursue the 
objectives of victory in Vietnam more wholeheartedly than Mr. 
McNamara did, about whom the insiders tell of great agonizing 
over the entire matter, an agonizing which cannot compare with 
the agonizing of American soldiers as they hear shells drop over 
them which were manufactured in the Soviet Union and found 
their way to the war front because Mr. McNamara�and Mr. 
Johnson�agonize over world opinion. 
But let us assume that the conduct of the Vietnam � war 
will proceed more or less at the pace of the last year or two, and 
hope that the cumulative pressures on North Vietnam will begin 
to tell; and that before long the military creaking and groaning 
will abate. What then? What will we see after it is over in Viet-
nam? 
A period of peace in the Southeast Asian part of the world 
we are entitled to expect. But history teaches us the unlikelihood 
that there will be peace everywhere in the world. And all the less 
likely considering the techniques of the modem revolutionists, 
who have learned to cause so much disturbance with so few men. 
The so-called wars of liberation are certain to prove to be

and ubiquitous. All it takes is a couple of thousand guerrillas,

army. The arguments in favor of it have been frequently re-
hearsed, as recently as in 1964 by both the Presidential mull,

nothing has been done, nothing in this case to phase out the

likely to exceed the great cost of continually training the mil-

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, 26 Wry 1968 
Thong's resignation jars Saigon 
Second Of a two-part series about revamp-
ing the South Vietnamese armed forces. 
By Beverly Deepe 
Special correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Saigon 
While concentrated efforts are being made 
to improve South Vietnam's 300,000-man 
provincial forces, their newly appointed 
commander has protested Saigon snafus and 
military in-fighting by resigning and taking 
annual leave. 
The resignation of Gen. Nguyen Due 
Thang�one of Saigon's most controversial, 
competent, and dynamic generals�has not 
yet been accepted, and considerable discus-
sion has arisen here over Whether it will 
be. General Thang�sometimes called "the 
blitz general"�is currently on leave for 
an unspecified duration. 
Although he has submitted his resigna-
tion from the South Victnainese Army a 
number of times in the past General Thong 
has continued to rise in either military or 
governmental circles. 
It would be considered a serious blow to 
the rock-bottom limits of the Army's leader-
ship if he were to be dropped from the mili-
tary roster. He is currently the No. 2 
officer at the Vietnamese high command, 
responsible for the provincial forces plus 
the Revolutionary Development Cadre, who 
implement the critical pacification program. 
The appointment of General Thang as 
� commander of the provincial forces was 
considered here to be one of the most clean-
cut, significant steps in improving the com-
bat effectiveness of these units. The 1968 
program for revamping the 670,000-man 
armed forces will concentrate on these 
provisional forces�equivalent to 25 conven-
tional army divisions in strength�rather 
than in the regular ground forces. 
Two groupings included 
These provincial forces are composed of 
two paramilitary groupings: The 150,000-
man Popular Forces, who are part-time 
fighters and part-time farmers in the 250 
districts throughout the countryside, and 
the 150,000-man Regional Forces, who oper-
ate at the provincial level in the country-
side. 
These two groupings, often affectionately 
called "Ruffs" and "Puffs" for their RI' 
and PF designations, sustain heavier bat-
tlefield casualties and desertion rates than 
the regular forces. They also kill a higher 
proportion of Communists. 
Yet, they are paid smaller salaries, have 
fewer fringe benefits, and have the poorest 
grade of weapons. The salary of a Popular 
Forces private is 2,200 piasters a month 
(roughly $22) plus 200 piasters ($2) a 
month in rice allowances for each member 
of his family. 
General Thang is the first officer at the 
central-government level to have central-
ized operational control of the Regional and 
Popular Forces. In the past, generals at 
the Saigon level have assumed only logisti-
cal and administrative responsibility for 
the widely scattered forces considered by 
some to be the "unsung heroes" of the war. 
At the lower levels, a new deputy has been 
appointed to each province chief to look 
after the interests of the Regional and Pop-
ular Forces. 
"This is mostly a psychological play to 
snake the little RF and PP feel they have a 
daddy," one reliable source reported. 
Special units set up 
Most of the other improvements in the 
It 
1 and P 1  
logistical and administrative fields. An ad-
ministrative, support, and logistical unit has 
been set up in each of the 44 provinces 
tailored to serve better the needs of the 
forces, which frequently operate miles away 
from headquarter cities. 
In some provinces, a small element of the 
Regional and Popular Forces will be held 
us reserve, no that in times of trouble it can 
reinforce a sister unit without aid of the 
Vietnamese regulars. 
Beginning this year, plans were made to 
corciputerize the accounting system of the 
Popular Forces by starting a "by-name," 
punch-card IBM system to keep better track 
of the individual trooper. This system was 
started with the Regional Forces in July, 
1966, and ill January of that year the regu-
lar Army took it up also. 
This would presumably eliminate the past 
gractice of "phantom soldiers"�names on 
payrolls of persons who either never existed 
Or else had been killed or wounded months 
'before. 
� General Thong's disappointment, which 
led to his submitting his resignation, cen-
tered on several things: the greater com-
mand and responsibility for the adminis-
tration of the provinces; the changing and 
training of new province chiefs; and the lack 
of transfer of authority over the regular 
Army battalions assigned to a province for 
pacification-support missions from the divi-
sion commanders to the province chiefs. 
Pacification supported 
These pacification-support forces now in-
clude elements of the 960 Regional Force 
companies, the 4,300 Popular Force .pla-
toons, now under the day-to-day operational 
control of the province chief, Plus the 50 to 
60 regular battalions of regular Vietnamese 
Army troops, which take orders either from 
the province chiefs or their division com-
manders, or sometimes both. 
A fourth component�but riot for secu-
rity � is the 'Revolutionary Development 
-cadres, the activists who are building 
schools, market places, and dispensaries at 
the hamlet level for their pacification 
assignments. These cadres now are under 
the control of General Thong, at the mili-
tary command, rather than under the gov-
ernment's Ministry of Revolutionary De-
velopment, General Thang's last post. 
General Thang, a northerner, is one ol the 
most controversial and most progressive-
thinking generals in the South Vietnamese 
command. But he is commonly identified 
with Vice-President Nguyen Cao Ky�cer-
tainly on issues of radical change�and this 
has not endeared him to President Thieu, 
who is in disagreement with Vice-President 
Ky on many points. 
General Mang has in the past been closely 
identified with retired Air Force Gen. 
Edward Landsdale, the so-called kingmaker 
of Ramon Magsaysay during the Philippines 
insurgency. This in turn has not en-
deared General Thong to many of the more 
tradition-minded, anti-Lansdale American 
generals. 
General Thang is also often identified with 
Robert Komer, the deputy commander in 
the American military establishment for 
pacification, who is also known to have con-
siderable disagreements with the more con-
ventional approaches of the American gen-
erals. 
Reform proposal recalled 
General Thang was known to have sup-
ported the radical-reform proposal in 
which the politico-military powers of the 10 
Vietnamese division commanders and four 
corps commanders would have been sub-
stantially reduced; thus, General Thong

These more conservative Vietnamese 
generals charge General Thong with "em-
pire building" and "chasing after the Amer-
icans." They also resent the support Gen-
eral 'Thong has from Vice-President Ky 
who they say, as an Air Force general, "is 
not military minded and has not com-
manded infantry troops in his whole life." 
The Ky-Thang-Komer hope was to move 
the Vietnamese division and corps com-
manders out of the politico-military chain of 
command. This has, for the time being, 
been blocked by some pivotal American 
and Vietnamese generals. The first group 
wanted to establish a direct link between 
the central government in Saigon and the 44 
province chiefs, who are both the political 
heads and military commanders of General 
Thong's Popular and Regional Forces. 
Control move blocked 
General Thong also wanted the province 
chiefs, rather than division commanders, to 
control those regular Army battalions as-
signed to pacification within given provinces. 
But this, too, has been blocked in given 
instances by the generals at this time. 
Even more important is the issue of who 
appoints and trains the province chiefs. And 
for the past two months high-level intrigue 
on the Vietnamese side has revolved around 
this point. General Thang drew up a list of 
the province chiefs, 15 now in that post, and ' 
29 new ones who have been appointed from 
other positions. These 44 were to be trained 
beginning Dec. 4 at the Vung Tau school 
where General Thong's Revolutionary De-
velopment Cadres are tutored. 
When the Vietnamese corps commanders 
torpedoed this project, it was rescheduled 
for late December, when the Ky-Thieu con-
flict again postponed it. This disgusted Gen-
eral Thong, who submitted his resignation 
in early January, 
President Thieu has since told General 
Thang to set up the training course for Feb. 
2. But General Thong has reportedly re-
fused, and most of the training now is sched-
uled to take place in Saigon instead of at 
the Vung Tau school. 
The Saigon government in the past has 
formally appointed the 44 province chiefs 
throughout the countryside. In practice, 
shtoawtees3ve.r, the job has often been sold by the 
corps commander, sometimes fbr as much 
as 5,000,000 piasters�roughly $5,000 (United 
Jobs often sold 
-The subordinate job of district chief was 
often sold by the division commander. The 
net effect was rampant corruption by these 
officers, plus a tie-up of government, with 
the district chiefs often quarreling with the 
province chiefs. 
In the past several months, General 
Thong was responsible for selecting the 29 
newly appointed province chiefs � which 
cut into the financial benefits of the corps 
commander�and he wanted to move them 
into th7.i- new jobs in blitz fashion. 
New, 40wever, the central government 
has deeded on a plow-motion change of 
province chiefs. 
General Thane was also eager to begin 
training the Popular Forces not simply as 
security forces, but also as an integrated 
part of the Revolutionary Development 
cadre program, in which they would assist 
with the construction of schools, wells, and 
marketplaces. But this plan, while report-
edly approved by General Komer, has been 
blocked by high-civil American generals, by 
President Thieu, and .by the corps com-

Voiced in Soviet Press 
By EDMUND STEVENS 
Special to The Star 
MOSCOW � Although Soviet 
diplomacy has so far declined 
the American request to act as a 
go-between in seeking the re-
lease of the USS Pueblo from 
North Korea, the Soviet press 
reflects mounting concern here 
lest the incident kindle another 
corulagration. 
Moscoe natur ally accepts 
unquestioningly the assertion of 
its North Korean ally that the 
Pueblo was captured in North 
Korean territorial waters. 
Pravda's Washington corre-
spondent, Boris Strelnikov, ca-
bled his paper by way of confir-
mation that no less an authority 
than Sen. J. William Fullbright, 
fl-Ark., admitted that this time 
the United States was caught 
red .handed and that the Pueblo 
was indeed engaged in espio-
nage. 
- Adds Strelnikov: "Sensible 
Americans' do not believe the 
Pentagon version that the Pueb-
lo was seized in international 
waters." 
. To the Russians the Pueblo 
'readily invites comparison with 
the U2 incident when the U.S. 
spy plane piloted by Gary Pow-
ers was shot down over Sver-
dlovsk thousands of miles inside 
the U.S.S.R. 
The Russians still recall "cov-
er stories" floated by U.S. 
spokesmen before ex-Premier 
Nikita S. Ithrushchev revealed 
the truth. 
Almost as if anticipating the 
Pueblo incident, the Soviet press 
recently reprinted an article 
from the Italian weekly "Epo-
ca" describing the sophisticated 
electronic worldwide espionage 
masterminded by the National 
Security Agency and the part 
played by intelligence gathering 
ships. 
The seizure of the Pueblo coin-
cided somewhat with the arrival 
in Moscow yesterday of a North 
Korean delegation headed by the 
deputy chief of state. 
Conceivably the Pueblo inci-
dent and the attempt by North 
Korean infiltrators to kill South 
Korean President, Chung Hee 
Park could be designed to warn 
the United States that continued 
escalation in Vietnam could lead 
to retaliatory action elsewhere 
in Asia: 
But most observers here agree 
Moscow neither programs nor 
anticipates a major crisis' in Ko-
rea. Otherwise, it's unlikely Pre-
mier Alexei .D. Kosygin 
have depattedgir New Delhi; * 
Soviet propaganda 'has hid a 
field day playing up the U.S. 
incursion into Cambodia and the 
1352_cras1iin_Greenland with its 
nuclear bomb load as examples 
of aggressive brinkmanship by 
the 'U.S. military .and proof of 
the Soviet contention that Amer-
ican policy is the main threat to 
world peace. 
Meanwhile, t h e rumblings 
from Korea virtually drowned 
out the peace-loving beeps gen-
erated by British Prime Minis-
ter Harold Wilson's Moscow 
talks. 
The British press spokesman 
sought to encourage optimism 
while the talks were going on by 
liberal use of such adjectives as 
"frank, friendly and construc-
tive" while disclosing nothing of 
substance. 
The joint communique, how-
ever, said little. The main indi-
cation that on Vietnam the gap 
had been narrowed, as Wilson 
claimed, was the affirmation 
that both sides supported the 
principles of the Geneva agree-
ments and would work jointly 
and separately for a just politi-
cal solution. 
Unlike the communique after 
Wilson's visit last year, it includ-
ed no expression of regret at 
failure to reach agreement on 
Vietnam.

Associated Peals Military Writer 
Capture of the Pueblo by the North 
� Koreans � and the Pentagon's ack-
� nowledgement the ship was a Navy 
' intelligence vessel � lifts the official 
' lid on worldwide electronic spying by 
, the major powers. 
, It marks a drastic change from the 
' Pentagon's insistence that the Liberty, 
a spy ship shot up by the Israelis off 
Egypt last June, was a "technical re-
search ship." 
"Intelligence collection by naval 
vessels is a routine activity among 
major powers," a defense off irial said 
� Tuesday, indicating a more relaxed 
attitude toward suggestions the United 
States engages in this kind of activity. 
� "It is common lmowledge that for a 
� number. of years intelligence collecting 
ships have followed U.S. fleet activi-
ties in various parts of the world," he 
added. The official obviously was al-
luding to the Soviet Union's terrier-
like electronic eavesdropping vessels 
, which show up wherever U.S. fleets 
. are manuevering and near important 
Polaris submarine and other bases. 
: Such ships, in the guise of fishing 
, trawlers, are "in fact positioned in 
international waters off the shores of 
the 'United States and ether nations 
right now," this official said. 
The U.S. intelligence vessels � 
which listen in on the radio traffic of 
other countries, spot radar site� and 
gather information to permit jamming, 
� them � and the Soviet Union's deep 
sea intelligence ships are parts of an 
extensive electronic intelligence sys-
tem which has grown up in the Cold 
War years. 
There are spy-in-the-sky satellites, 
both Soviet and American, whirling 
about the earth with almost unbelieva-
bly accurate cameras and "ferret" 
listening devices for eavesdropping on 
radio communications. 
There are unmanned drones with 
sensitive information-gathering equip-
ment. There are destroyers carrying 
"black boxes" which slip close to hos-
tile shores to intercept radio talk, re-
cord coded messages and pick up other 
information. One of the two US, de-
stroyers involved in the historic Ton-
kin Gulf attack by North Vietnamese 
patrol boats in August 1964 reportedly 
had been on such a mission. 
The United States and Soviet Union, 
say nothing about what they know of 
the other side's electronic snooping 
from space. 
But the U.S. Navy complains out 
lsnmszeirzzom REM, 
ion Now Routine 
loud about the operations of the Soviet 
"trawlers," some of which get into the 
flow of fleet traffic and sometimes 
interfere with carrier and other opera-
tions. 
Members of Congress also have ex-
pressed alarm about increasingly ac-
tive Soviet naval snooping. 
Soviet trawlers have been reported 
standing off Polaris submarine bases 
at Holy Loch, Scotland, at Rota, Spain, 
Guam, and Charleston, S.C. 
The Red trawlers monitored U.S.

nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific in 
1960. 
U.S. vessels have taken positions in 
the Pacific to observe the re-entry and 
splashdown of Soviet intercontinental 
ballistic missiles fired into the mid-
Pacific. 
A Soviet Intelligence-gathering 
trawler, the Anemometer, collided 
with a U.S. intelligence ship, the Ban-
ner, in the Sea of Japan in June 1966. 
The 935-ton Pueblo is one of three of 
her class, all converted light cargo 
vessels. 
She has about eight whip antennae 
and two heavy masts hung with spe-
cial electronic gear. 
The Pueblo engages in hydrographic 
surveys as well as electronic intelli-
gence, dropping devices into the water 
to measure its temperature at various 
levels, its salinity and its density. All 
these factors are important in antisub-
marine warfare work because they 
affect the penetration of sonar beams. - 
All told, there are about a dozen 
clearly identifiable intelligence-type 
ships in the U.S. Navy, along with 
about 15 oceanographic survey ships 
which may well serve an intelligence 
function also. 
Then there are the destroyers and 
other surface craft which can be 
equipped with electronics sensors as 
needed. 
The Liberty, at 11,000 tons, was a 
bigger and more sophisticated intelli-
gence vessel. 
Among other things, the Liberty was 
equipped with a "big ear" dish-type 
detector that could monitor communi-
cations more than 100 miles distant. 
There are five vessels in the Liberty 
class with crews of nearly 300 men 
each. 
There were reports the Liberty was 
operated by the Navy for the super-
secret National Security Agency, 
whose mission is to crack the codes of 
foreign countries and to pick up and 
analyse foreign radio communications.

Getting the Pueblo Back 
THE ship and its 83-man crew � some 
of them wounded � must be released 
without further delay. . . 
It was Monday noon Korean time that 
the USS Pueblo Was captured by a gang-
up of North Korean patrol boats and 
forced into Wonsan harbor. All right, 
,the communists have� had their � fun, 
tweaked Uncle Sam's nose, made their 
propaganda coup. Now it's high time 
they gave the ship back. 
There's a hint the North Koreans 
know they have to do so. It lies in the 
crude, hastily drafted "confession" at-
tributed to Cmdr. Bucher, the Pueblo's 
skipper. " . .. Our parents and wives 
and children at home are anxiously 
waiting for us to return home. in safe 
(sic).-.. We only hope that. we will 
be forgiven leniently . ..." 
North Korea's smug rejection of the 
U.S. demand to return the ship, made at 
a Panmunjom armistice 'meeting yes-
terday indicates, however, the Pyon-
gyang pirates want to gamble a bit and 
string us 'along. There's no comfort, ei-
ther, in word thatthe Russians rebuffed 
Washington's appeal to intervene. We 
still hope the Russians, recalling the 
Crises over Berlin and Cuba, would pass 
on the word that when the Americans 
get riled, it doesn't pay to fool around 
too long. . . 
But what should the Johnson Adminis-
tration do? It should make an all-out ef-
fort thru all available channels to get , 
the Pueblo back by diplomatic means � 
before resort to force. 
B e s Id e s seeking intervention of 
friendly governments; neutrals and 
communists with whom we are on f 
speaking terms, the U.S. should request 
an urgent meeting of the United Nations 
Security Council. We should present a 
two-part plan: (1) North Korea must re-
lease the Pueblo immediately, and (2) 
the U.S. will participate in an impartial 
investigation of the whole episode, and 
let the facts come out as they will. 
The most important objective is to de-
fuse this explosive crisis by freeing the 
ship and its crew � and gather all the 
facts later, after the crisis has cooled. 
This means the Security Council must. 
not just meet and palaver as it did in 
last year's Middle East crisis, but must 
quickly get results � the return of the 
Pueblo. - 
Perhaps the UN would prove incapa-
ble of getting action within a reasonable 
time. But at least we owe it to the world 
community and to our own principles as� 
Americans' to try the peaceable ap-
proach first. 
But let the North Koreans mark it 
well: grabbing Off the tiny USS Pueblo 
may have been easy, but the carrier 
task force, including the mighty USS 
Enterprise, has not moved into the Sea 
of Japan without purpose.

Pueblo s Orders 
Restricted Gunfire 
The standing instructions for the USS Pueblo were 
to avoid an international incident by moving out of the 
area if .harassed rather than use her guns, it was learned 
yesterday. 
The ship's three .50-caliber machine guns were to be 
kept under canvas unless the surOival of the ship de-
!pended on them. 
These rules for ferret, or 
spy, ships like the Pueblo may 
explain why her skipper, 
Cmdr. Lloyd N. Bucher, wait-
ed until it was too late to resist 
the North Korean boarding 
Monday night. 
Reliable sources said last 
night that North Koreans 
boarded the Pueblo without 
one shot being fired by the 
,:mericans. The injuries to 
four Pueblo crewmen, it was 
;earned authoritatively, came 
� irom the explosions 13ue1ter set

The very topside of the Navy 
ic standing behind Bucher on 
the basis of facts on hand so 
far. Top officers regard Hu-
cher's decisions as consistent 
.ith his instructions to avoid 
trouble. 
Mrs.. Rose Bucher, wife of 
the Pueblo skipper, said in an 
interview last night that Adm. 
Thomas H. Moorer, Chief of 
Naval Operations, had ex-
pressed the Navy support or 
her husband's decisions in, a 
t..rienhone call yesterday. 
The Pueblo is not a fighting 
ship, but a passive one With 
!lie job of eavesdropping on 
communications all around it. 
Her crew are electronic spe-
cialists rather than experi-
enced gunners used to rushing

actions. Even after the North 
Koreans forced their way 
aboard at gunpoint, Bucher 
could have reasoned this was 
a temporary tweaking of the 
United States, rather than a 
plan to capture the ship. . 
There are no sea .cocks on 
the Pueblo that could have 
been opened to let enough 
water into the hull to sink the 
ship. And sources said such 
ships do not ordinarily carry 
explosives other than the small 
ones needed to destroy spy 
equipment and codes. 
This would seem to rule out 
any chance of Bucher scut-
tling his ship. And if he did so, 
the lives of his 82 crewmen 
could have been lost�either: 
through freezing in the cold 
water where the Pueblo lay or 
from the North Koreans open-
ing fire on them. 
Bucher's only chance, then, 
seemed to be help from other 
U.S. ships or planes. This did 
not arrive from the time Bu-
cher sent out his call about 
midnight Monday (EST) until 
the undisclosed time�at least 
two hours later � when the 
Pueblo was taken into the 
North Korean port of Wonsan. 
It was also learned yoster�. 
day that the .Pueblo lay dead 
in the water with water col-
lection bottles strung over the 
side when first accosted by the 
North Koreans. The water 
samples were part of the 
Pueblo's oceanagraphic re-
search. 
Richard Halloran, Washing-
ton Post correspondent in 
Seoul, said sources there 
claimed the Pueblo's crew was 
taken off the ship shortly after 
capture. The Pueblo's officers, 
he said, then were flown to 
Pyongyang but the enlisted 
men .presumably were kept in 
Wonsan 
The Pueblo's capture had all 
the earmarks of a long-planned 
operation, Halloran wrote. 
The North Korean Defense 
:Minister reportedly flew to 
Wonsan to inspect � the ferret 
ship. 
The fate of Bucher was still 
not known here last night. 
North Korea's radio sent out a 
broadcast of Bucher's alleged 
confession. 
The voice, alleged to be Bu-
cher's, said "I and my crew 
have perpetrated such a grave 
criminal act, but our parents 
and wives and children at 
home are anxiously waiting for 
us to return in safety. 
"Therefore," the broadcast 
continued, "we only hope, and 
it is the greatest desire of my-
self and all my crew, that we 
will be forgiven leniently by 
the government of the Demo-
cratic Peoples Republic of 
Korea." 
In San Diego, Bucher's wife 
said after hearing a recording 
of the broadcast: "That is not 
my husband's voice. It does not 
sound in any remote way like 
my husband. The inflections 
and sound were not his."

Red Aim Seen Takei er of Peninsula 
crtyJ ei% 
U.S. on Diplomatic Tip-Toe 
The United States, confronted with the most 
perilous situation in Korea since the 1953 armi-
atice, was moving quietly but forcefully thru dip-
lomatic channels today to secure the return of the 
USS Pueblo and her crew. 
Johnson administration officials said North Ko-
rea's seizure of the U. S. Navy intelligence vessel 
in International waters appeared to be one more 
"provocation" in a mounting series of communist 
actions aimed at eventually destroying the 
U. S.-backed government of South Korean.Presi-
dent Park Chung Hee. 
MANEUVER 
They said the North Korean communists probe-
My-hoped that their action at sea, as well as their 
stepped up infiltration and terrorism in South Ko-
rea, also would help Hanoi by distracting Ameri-
can attention and resources. 
But the primary objective of the Pueblo hijack-
ing, in the view of officials here, was to press 
forward the campaign for the ultimate communi-
zation of the entire Korean peninsula. 
The Russians, whose -aid the United States has 
sought in this affair, had no editorial comment on 
It. On the basis .of Soviet aotions during the past 
few years it was assumed the Kremlin wanted to 
find .a way to defuse the situation and divert the 
peril of a renewed Korean war without causing 
the North Korean communists to lose too much 
face in the process. 
RENEWED WAR 
No official would go so far as to predict that 
the Pueblo incident, along with the attempted 
assassination of President Park and other ac-
tions, would lead to a resumption of hostilities in � 
Korea. But such a passibility could not be dis-
Counted entirely. 
The official North Korean newspaper, Rodong 
Shinmoon, said Sunday that Presideet Johnson's 
policies in Vietnam had created "a tense situa-
tion in which a war may break-out at any mo-
ment ... in our country." 
On Jan. 9, about the time the Pueblo took up its 
station off Wonsan harbor, another North Korean 
newspaper, Minju Chosen, said the United States 
was sending armed vessels along the country's 
east coast. 
The North Koreans, in their broadcast an-
nouneement of the capture of a "spy ship" linked 
Thu affair directly to the mounting tension rising 
from a sharp increase in the number of military 
incidents, between North and South in recent 
months. RD

Spy Ship's Role Foggy 
By MIKE MILLER 
ScrIpps-Howard Stott Writer 
Mystery today shrouded the role and actions of 
the Navy's USS Pueblo, hijacked Monday night 
by oommunist North Korea on an intelligence 
mission off that country's coast. 
After hours of officially Imposed silence, many 
of the sporadio Pentagon disclosures carlhe inci-
dent served to heighten the mystery rather than 
solve it. 
There were these questioner 
IVIrat exactly was the Pueblo doing in the 
Sea of Japan since it began its mission there Jan. 
8? 
, Describing the vessel as an "intelligence gath-
ering auxiliary ship," the Pentagon said it was 
under control of the Navy rather than any of the 
U.S. supersecret intelligence agencies. 
i.e' Why did the Pueblo hesitate so long before 
calling for help? 
The vessel was first confronted by a North 
Korean patrol boat at 10 p.m. Monday and bold 
by radio to "Heave to or I will open fire on you." 
The Pueblo skipper did not request help until she 
was boarded an hour and 45 minutes later, after 
the one patrol boat had been joined by three 
others and two AllGs circling overhead. 
The Pentagon deolined comment on whether 
any help was dispatehed. It was probably too 
late. 
V What happened in the 47 minutes from the 
� time the ship was boarded until it sent its last 
message that its engines were at "all stop" and 
that it was "going off the air?" Did a fight en-
sue? � 
' It Could have. The Pueblo's crew of 83 Was 
equipped with small arms and might have fought 
back before being overcome. A Navy spokesman 
said the Pueblo was taken forcibly and did not 
surrender. Nor did it ask for instructions while it 
remained in contact with "higher headquarters." 
Altho Pueblo radioed that it didn't fire Its two 
50-caliber machine guns and there was no report 
of fine from the patrol boats before the bonding, 
the Pueblo skipper reported four men wounded, 
� one critically.

Fabrication 
Is Charged 
By Pentagon 
From News Disostelles 
North Korea claimed yes-
terday the captain of the 
USS Pueblo had confessed 
that he was engaged in 
"criminal espionage activi-
ties" inside North Korean 
territorial waters when he 
was captured Tuesday. The 
United States termed this 
"a travesty on the facts." 
The alleged confession was 
,attributed to Cmdr. Lloyd 
Mark Bucher. The 38-year-old 
officer, his 83-man crew and 
their intelligence ship were 
taken into custody by North 
Korean patrol boats and 
brought to the port of Wonsan. 
The (North) Korean Central 
News Agency quoted Bucher 
as saying that he was carrying 
out an espionage mission 
against the Soviet Union and 
North Korea for which he and 
his crew had been offered "a 
lot of dollars" from the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency. 
Alleged Remarks 
"Having been captured now, 
I say frankly that our act was 
a criminal act which flagrantly 
violated the armistice agree-
ment and it was a sheer act of 
aggression," BuCher said, ac-
cording to the news agency. 
"I have no excuse whatso-
ever for my criminal act as 
my ship intruded deep into the 
territorial waters of the Demo-
cratic People's Republic of 
Korea and was captured by 
� the naval patrol grafts of the 
Korean People's Army in their 
self-defense action while con-
� ducting criminal espionage ac-
� tivities," the Commander al-
legedly said. 
Called 'Fabrication' 
In Washington, the Pentagon 
� promptly asserted that the ac-
count attributed to Bucher was 
� a "fabrication." It added that 
"no credence should be given 
� to this contrived statement." 
Assistant Secretary of De-
� fense Phil G. Goulding, thel 
� Pentagon's chief spokesman, 
said the "style and wording" 
of the document published by 
� the North Koreans "provide 
unmistakable evidence in.

hat the North Koreans can

'tteblo and, its crew in any 
hort period of time. 
While North Korea's Corn-
iunist Party has lately 
hown signs of indePend-
nce of both China and the 
.oviet Union, it clearly sub-
cribes to the Maoist dor-
rine that the way to des-
roy the United States is to 
hop off its fingers one by 
ne. That is Mao's way of 
aying bleed the Americans 
.y as many wars as possible. 
'ower Spread Thin 
In short, if a war in Viet-
am is fine, another war in 
:orea would be doubly fine. 
'his is not to say that, the 
"orth Koreans are about to 
lunge again across the bor-
er, but that President 
Johnson faces a foe who 
quite probably would en-
gage him with alacrity if he 
proffered the opportunity. 
Furthermore, the Presi-
dent finds himself with min-
imal available power in the 
area of Korea, so great has 
been the drain-off to Viet-
nam. 
The two American divi-
sions in South Korea are 
below par and the only ef-
fective airpower in that 
country at the moment the 
Pueblo was seized is re-
ported to have been armed 
with nuclear weapons: Yet 
the basic premise of Ameri-
can military policy is to 
have sufficient conventional 
force to avoid the dreadful 
choice between annihilation 
and surrender, as both Pres-
idents Kennedy and John-
son have put it. 
.If this picture is black, 
there is perhaps'. another 
side to the coin, however. 
The President has chosen at 
a moment of national anger 
to call up some reserve 
units, a step he long had re-
fused to take lest it contra-
dict his claim that the 
.United States can have both 
guns and butter. The Pueblo 
incident thus may offer an. 
unexpected and totally un-
sought moment for finally 
focusing the Nation's atten-
tion on Asia and for rolling 
up its sleeves to see the 
Vietnam war through. 
This is an emotional mo-
ment and emotional mo-
ments are full of danger. 
The President's options to 
PEOPLES DRUG STORES 
get back the Pueblo may be. 
limited but he has wide lati-
tude now that he lacked be-
fore to rally the country. In 
short, the combination of 
Korea and Vietnam could 
backfire against the Commu-
nist cause.

killing and wounding several 
crewmen and capturing 80-odd 
others." 
. Pak said the Pueblo was in-
side North Korean territorial 
waters and told Smith not to 
make a "foolish attempt to 
cover up your criminal act like 
a robber playing'cop, by false-
ly claiming the ship was 'in 
international waters."' 
Smith also charged North 
Korea with trying to "perpe-
trate the most heinous crime 
since your barbaric invasion" 
of South Korea in 1950 in 
Sunday's unsucceSsful attempt 
to assassinate South Korean 
President Park Chung Hee. 
As Smith- spoke, search and 
sweep maneuvers continued 
to round up remaining mem-
bers of a 31-Man North Ko-
rean commando squad. Since 
Sunday's fight that broke up 
the attempt, 15 North Koreans 
have been killed and one cap-
tured. South Korean casual.'

killed, including a colonel shot

Pak retorted that the at-

the coming summer. 
South Korean reaction t 
both incidents bas been mix-
ture of shock, anger, and ten- . 
sion. The South Korean gov-

Much speculation has arisen 
as to why. North Korea 'seized 
the espionage vessel. One view 
held by. well-informed sources 
Is that this was an effort to. 
show up the United States as 
a.' "paper tiger." Although 
North Korean Premier Kim n. 
Sung leans toward the Soviet 
Union because it can supply 
money and arms, ideologically 
he favors Communist China's 
Mao Tse-tung and believes 
that Americans should be 
harassed everywhere in. the 
world as part of a worldwide 
conflict with "imperialism." 
The incidents may also have 
been a North Korean attempt 
to prevent South Korea from 
sending more troops-to light
