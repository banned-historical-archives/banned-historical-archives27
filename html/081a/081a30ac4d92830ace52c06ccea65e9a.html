Won't Prosecute an,e 
By Sanford J. Ungar 
Washington Post Staff Writee 
The Justice Department has 
no intention of prosecuting ac-
tress Jane Fonda for her 
broadcasts to American serv-
icemen over Radio Hanoi, 
sources in the department?and 
on Capitol Hill said yesterday. 
? Although the department's 
Internal Security Division is 
conducting an "inquiry" at the 
request ? of the House. Internal 
Secu ty Committee, the 
sources said, there is no plan 
.for a federal grand jury inves-
tigation of. the -antiwar activ-
ist. . 
The State Department ini-
tially reacted angrily to re-
ports of Miss Fonda's broad-
casts during a visit to Hanoi in 
July. - 
Justice Department lawyers 
have apparently -concluded, 
however, that. she did not vio-

same people and same liars to

Ichord said his own commit-
tee staff 'is carrying out a 
,similar but separate analysis 
:of her broadcasts and other ? 
?activities ? during the trip." to 
Hanoi. 
But committee sources said? 
that even this investigation is 
likely to be dropped without 
ever subpoenaing Miss Fonda 
. to testify, as originally urged 
by Republican Reps, Fletcher 
Thompson of -Georgia and 
.,John G. Schmitz of .California, 
? presidential candidate of the 
American Independent Party. 
The committee voted 8-1 on 
August 10 to put off the sub-
poena question until it had re-
-ceived the Justice Department 
? ? report. 
Iehord is opposed to calling 
-Miss Fonda before the com-

day, because he fears ii Would

views against American in-
volvement in Southeast Asia.

yesterday with a statement an-

lianf Olson, assistant attorney

rity Division. 
Committee Chairman Rich-
ard H. Ichord (D-Mo.) used the 
occasion to release selected 
quotations from transcripts of 
Miss. Fonda's broadcasts to 
GIs, provided by the- Foreign 
Broadcast Information Scrvic 
of the Central Intelligence 
Agency.. ,1 
Among the statements at-
tributed to her: . 
"Tonight when you are

Justice Department's advice- in 
its 'report to the House com-
mittee. ? :

? 
? Both .congressional and Jus-
tice . Department sources said 
that if anything comes of the 
Fonda broadcasts, it could be 
a push for new legislation .to 
deal with such situations. 
They rejected the earlier 
suggestions of.. those angered 
by the Fonda broadcasts that 
her remarks were comparable 
to those of Iva Toguri 
D'Aguino, known as "Tokyo 
Rose" for. her broadcasts to 
American servicemen over 
Radio Tokyo in World War 
After a 56-day trial on.trea-

After Miss Fonda's return 
from Hanoi, Thompson urged 
that she be prosecuted in a 
similar manne r. "Declared 
war or undeclared war, this is. 
treason," he said last month.

-when unauthorized air raids 
were being made against 
North Vietnam that 1152 bomb-

striking at targets In the 
northern half of the demilitar-

The Air Force acknowledged 
'last week that Gen. John 1). 
Lavelle had permittted his pi-
lots to carry out 28 unauthor-

-missions, involving single at-
tacks by 1.47 planes, against 
_targets in North Vietnam be-
tween Nov. 8, 1971, and March 
8, 1972. 
Pentagon officials, asked. 
last week about the North 
Vietnamese charges, insisted 
that B52s did not attack tar-
gets in the North between the 
bombing halt in 1968 and the 
'resumption of bombing in 
-April 1972 after the beginning 
of the current enemy offen-

these described- by the North 
Vietnamese would have gone 
._ beyond the concept of "protec-

violated the "understand-

in 1963, 
- The officials did acknow-
ledge, however, that the rules 
. covering "protective reaction" 
had been relaxed in the 
months preceding the current 
offensive to permit large-scale 
attacks not only on offending

? PEKING TAILORED 
NIXON TRIP NEVIS 
'Reports to Indochina Kept 
- 
to a Bare Minimum 
By TAD SZULC 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, March 11?
A survey of Peking's recent in-
ternational broadcasting shows 
that President Nikon's visit to 
the mainland posed problems 
for the Chinese involving rela-
tions with their allies. 
The Pekin* radio never told monitoring of 
broadcasting. 
Tailored to the Audience 
In the judgment of American 
analysts, Peking had to, tailor 
its reporting on the reception 
given Mr. Nixon to the listening 
areas. 
The silence on the Khmer-
language service was seen as 
a gesture to Prince Norodom 
Sihanouk, whose government 
in exile has had its headquar-. 
ters in Peking. It encourages 
insurgency in Cambodia against 
the American-supported Gov-
ernment in Pnompenh. 
The low-key reporting in the 
yietnamese-language service 
was believed to relate to 
Agency specializing in theilianoi's displeasure with the 
its Cambodian listeners in the 
Khmer-language service about 
the Presidential visit and kept 
to a bare minimum the reports 
beamed at North Vietnam and 
Laos. 
In contrast, Peking's inter-
national service in English 
carried fully daily accounts, in-
cluding he text of the final 
Chinese-American. communiqu?
Broadcasts directed at South-
east Asia and South Asia in

Chinese decision to deal with 
Mr. Nixon while the Vietnam 
war goes on. Hanoi never told 
the North Vietnamese that Mr. 
Nixon spent a week in China, 
but it criticized the communi-
qu?
Peking devoted two broad-
casts in Vietnamese; totaling' 
seven minutes, ,to President 
Nixon's arrival and his meet-
ings with Chairman Mao Tse-
ttin'g and Premier Chou En-lai 
subsequently news relating to 
Mr. Nixon followed the main 
topics. 
American experts, saying 
that North Vietnamese in the 
urban centers could have been 
reasonably well informed on 
the trip, explained that many 
listen regularly to the British 
Broadcasting Corporation, the 
Saigon radio and the Peking 
radio's English-language serv-
ice. The limiting of the reports 
in Vietnamese, they added, 
would have chiefly affected 
listeners in rural 'areas.

? REDESIGNED SPACECRAFT 
The Russians are designing 
and building the new Salyut 
earth-orbiting spaceship to 
eliminate some of the so-
called "housekeeping" chores 
which take time away from 
space-borne scientific ex-
?. periments. Salyut is being 
patterned also to adapt a 
"compatible" docking system 
which would couple the earth-
orbiting craft with a surplus 
? American Apollo spaceship, 
? Each craft would carry three 
spacemen as -they liakedup

So far there is no firm 
agreement on the U.S.-pro-
posed 1975 space spect arm 
President Nixon may tkt up 
the loose ends during his visit 
to Moscow this spring. But 
his fisf,0,1?1.972-73 space budget 
contains no funds specifically 
for such a mission. The clock-
ing system alone would cost 
about $50 million. 
Of more urgent concern to 
the Russians than the pro-
posed linkup is a solution to 
the problems which beset. the. 
Soyuz 11 craft as it sprung a 
hatch leak and broke the vac-
uum which had given three 
Soviet cosmonauts an earth-
like Atmosphere in space. 
Georgi T. Drobovolsky, Via-
distal; N. Volkov and Viktor I. 
Patsayev died from the, loss 
of cabin pressure only 30 min-
utes away from touching 
down after nearly 24 days in 
space. 
(The cosmonauts had been 
launched aloft in the Soyuz 11 
craft, then fastened on to the 
Salyut for the record spin 
around earth, transferring 
back to Soyuz 11 for the ill-
starred ride back home.) 
Konstantin Feoktistov, a 
chief designer of both the So-
yuz and Salyut craft and a 
cosmonaut himself, disclosed 
some of the spaceship prob-
lems during a recent dis-
cussion of the Soyuz-Salyut 
mission. 
? For one thing, the cosmo-
nauts had to spend so many 
hours maintaining their Sal-
yut spacecraft that. valuable 
scientific research time was 
lost, according to Feoktistov. 
Moreover, weightlessness 
hampered their efforts to op-
erate delicate instruments. 
Even so, the cosmonaut-
physicist said, advanced Sal-
yut craft will carry more sci-
entific apparatus than the 
previous one, so cosmonauts 
Kre91M8 40OrgatC1 
,resources, space phenomena 
and biemedical studies. 
TIME FOR EXPERIMENTS 
New automatic controls 
will be built into the 'new Sal-
yut, to, give cosmonauts more 
hours for experiments and 
less time for manual oper-
ation of their spacecraft. 
The decision to increase 
rather than reduce scientific 
experiments during the. next 
Salyut-Soyuz mission came 
after long debate within the 
Soviet Academy .of Sciences 
and at a time when morale in 
Russia's. space program was 
low. 
The death of three cosmo-
nauts shook Russian con-
fidence in the Soviet, space 
venture. just as Americans 
were shaken when three U.S. 
astronatits died in flames on 
an Apollo launch pad in 
19S7. 
The academy debate re-
volved around -the' future 
roles of man in his spacecraft 
rather than whether the Rus-
sians shold turn more to un-
manned, highly instrumented 
space probes. 
The decision of Russian sci-
entists to continue with man-
ned missions and even more 
scientific experiments was 
evident from Feoktistov's re-
marks. He would not have ut-
tered them ?without academy 
sanction. ? 
Stressing that the weight-' 
less problem was perhaps the 
most serious roadblock in the. 
way of man's ability to per-
form scientific tasks in space, 
Feoktistov observed: 
"The (Soyuz 11) cosmo-
nauts experienced a per-
manent, shortage of time. 
Weightlessness did not play 
the smallest role in this, since, 
it materially complicated the 
work with instruments which

"It is very important that ' 
we understand this far-from-
trivial characterisitc of re-
search operations in space, 
discovered as early as the

"From this it does not fol- , 
Ilow that in the future we 
must retreat from the prin-
ciple of scientific apparatus 
on an' orbiting station, -or 
from the concept of a satu-
rated scientific program. 
"Actually, the epoch of de-
tailed study of our planet and 
near space from manned 
spacecraft is only begin- ? 
ning." 
The Russians have had 
company in ,their problems 
with man's inability to per-
form well in a. weightless 
state. U.S. astronauts have 
had trouble walking in space ? 
, during earth-orbital flights. 
They have fared better than 
the Russians in operating 
their spacecraft; however, be-

services. 
'The handling of , the Nixon 
visit by the Communist news 
media was made available here 
by the Foreign Broadcast Infor-
mation Service, a bureau of the 
Central Intelligence Agency 
specializing in the monitoring 
of foreign broadcasts. 
? Government analysts and for-
eign diplomats here who spe-
cialize in Communist affairs 
took the view that the way in 
which each Communist coun-
try treats Mr. Nixon's presence 
in Peking in informing, or fail-
ing to inform, its people re-
flects the attitudes held by the 
individual governments toward 
the ndw Chinese-American re-
lationship. 
? Thus North. Vietnam, which 
Is involved in hostilities with 
. the United States, has decided 
-simply to ignore the Nixon 
visit, ,at least for the time 
being. 
Specialists here recalled that 
the Hanoi press and radio 
never actually announced that 
of its way to deny, indirectly, 
Western reports that Le Duc 
? 
Tho, a senior member of the 
North Vietnamese POlitburo, 
would be in Peking at the same 
time as Mr. Nixon. Speculation 
in the Western press was that 
Mr. Tho might meet with senior 
American officials in Peking to 
discuss peace possibilities. 
Mr. Tho held several secret 
meetings in Paris last year with 
Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Nixon's 
chief foreign policy adviser, 
who is now with the President 
in Peking. 
In a broadcast this morning. 
Hanoi radio said that Mr. Tho 
held a "cordial" meeting yes-
terday with George Wald, a, 
biology professor at Harvard) 
University and a' 1967 Nobel ) 
Prize winner, who is visiting 
Hanoi. 
The Moscow radio told the 
listeners of its domestic and 
International services this 
morning that the "cool Wel-
come" given Mr. Nixon in 
Peking was a "maneuver" by 
the Chinese leadership to dis-
guise the Presidential visit in 
order to "save face" with the 
masses. 
This broadcast, however, was 
made before the appearance of 
today's issue of the official 
Peking newspaper slenmin Jib 
Pao, with detailed coverage of 
the Nixon visit, including pho-
tographs of the President with 
Mao Tse-tung. . 
? In its Mandarin-language 
broadcasts beamed at China, 
,the Moscow radio has been 
'attacking the Peking leadership 
for weeks over the Nixon visit. 
Last Saturday, for example, a 
Mandarin broadcast ,thastised 
the Chinese for "ignoring Tai-
wan" in the preparations for 
Mr. Nixon's arrival. The broad-
cast charged the Peking lead-
ers with setting aside their 
? 
claim to Taiwan in what it 
described as a move to placate 
Mr. Nixon. 
North Korea's Pyongyang 
radio, citing "foreign press re-
ports" as its source, today told 
its public that the American 
President was in Peking. The 
dry and factual account of Mr. 
Nixon's activities included his 
conference with Chairman Mao 
and his attendance at the ban-
quet given by Premier Chou 
En-lai.. 
Last August, Premier Kim Il 
Sung of North Korea said in a 
speech, rebroadcast later by Pe-
king, that Mr. Nixon was going 
to China with the "white flag 
of surrender." 
Last Sunday the Pyongyang 
radio, reporting on the Nixon 
trip, remarked that the Presi-
dent. was going to Peking with 
"a white flag in one hand and 
a beggar's bowl in the other."

eight questions to Thmier Pham Van

of the world are usually / 
ascribed to one man: Allen Dulles. J 
They culminated in the abortive in-
vasion of Cuba in 1961. When Dulles 
departed from the directorship of CIA 
after the Bay of Pigs debacle, he 
certainly left an indelible stamp of his 
influence as the architect of the mighty 
CIA edifice and its worldwide rami-
fications. 
The policy of his successors has, 
however, been no less forceful. CIA 
acthrities under its present director, 
Richard McGarrah Helms, may 
appear less aggressive because they are 
being conducted with greater caution 
and less publicity, and because they 
have been adroitly adjusted to the 
changing climate iri international poli-
tics. In the past CIA gained notoriety 
by promoting revolutions in Latin 
American banana republics, and sup-
porting anti-communist regimes in 
South-East Asia. Its operations in 
Africa were more skilfully camou-
flaged. For many years they had been 
on a limited scale because the CIA had 
? relied on the British secret service to 
provide intelligence from an area 
where the British had unsurpassed ex-
perience and long-established sources 
of information. But with the emergence 
of the many African independent 
countries, the wave of "anti-colonial-
ist" emotions, and the growing in-
filtration of Africa by Soviet and 
Chinese "advisers", British influence 
declined. Washington forcefully 
stepped, through CIA, into the breach;
