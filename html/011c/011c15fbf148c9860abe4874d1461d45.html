 Hurricane Flora's week-long
 rampage in the Carribean severe-
 ly damaged most of eastern Cuba
 and further darkened the island's
 economic outlook.  Although
 damage assessments are still
 tentative, agriculture and
 transportation apparently suf-
 fered far more than industry
 and the military.  The regime
 is likely to blame the storm for
 its economic troubles for months
 and even years to come, even
 though many of these problems
 were well advanced before the
 hurricane.
 Oriente and Camaguey, the
 two eastern provinces primarily
 affected by Flora, are the lead-
 ing agricultural provinces in
 Cuba.  They supply more than
 half the farm produce consumed
 on the island and account for
 50 percent of the country's
 sugar acreage.
 Although damage to the
 sugar industry cannot yet be
 measured, the hurricane doubt-
 less has harmed not only the
 1964 crop but future harvests
 as well.   Large areas of cane
 probably were destroyed by winds,
 and thousands of acres of newly
 planted cane probably were
 washed out.   Damage from flood-
 ing has been severe and may be-
 come worse.                       The forecast for
 the next 30 days is for an
 additional five to eight inches
 of rain.
 Damage has been equally
 severe for other crops, many of
 which were in or about to enter
 the harvesting stage.  Much, if
 not most, of the coffee and
 cocoa crops have probably been
 destroyed.  Most of the important
 rice crop, at least half the
 cotton crop, and up to 10 per-
 cent of the corn crop have been
 lost.  The main producing areas
 for other important products such
 as bananas, peanuts, oranges, and
 beans were all among the areas
 hardest hit.   Livestock losses
 are reported to be heavy, but no
 figures are available.
 Housing, electric power,
 communications, and transporta-
 tion suffered severe losses.
 Entire communities were washed
 away and others were isolated.
 Aerial photography shows exten-
 sive damage to roads, railroads, and
 bridges.  All the rivers in Oriente
 Province overflowed, and most
 bridges in the affected areas
 were washed out or cut off when
 their approaches washed away.
 Landslides have rendered many
 roads and railroads impassable.
 Considerable time, effort, and
 materials will be required to
 restore the transportation system.
 Delay in moving sugar from fields
 to mills may further reduce sugar
 output when the harvest gets
 under way in about three months.

 and production probably has been
 curtailed by power failures and
 transportation breakdowns.
 Soviet military forces in
 Cuba apparently were not serious-
 ly affected by the hurricane.
 There was considerable damage
 to living quarters and probably
 to some of the more fragile
 equipment such as communications
 and radar gear, but there are
 no reports of Soviet casualties.
 Some Cuban military installa-
 tions suffered extensive damage
 and there was a heavy loss of
 supplies, but no aircraft or
 naval vessels were lost.  Many
 Cuban troops probably will be
 diverted from training and
 counterinsurgency operations to
 Soviet interference with
 US and British convoys on the
 Berlin autobahn appears to be
 aimed at drawing the Western
 powers into negotiations on both
 access procedures and the broad-
 er question of the status of
 Western forces in West Berlin.
 Soviet authorities now are
 seeking to impose new procedures
 for checking Allied convoys.
 The USSR's initial tactic in
 this regard appears to be an
 attempt to establish a link
 between the Western practice of
 giving advance notification for
 convoys over a certain size
 (over seven vehicles in the US
 case) and procedures governing
 the dismounting of convoy per-
 sonnel for a head count..  The
 Soviet checkpoint commander
 stated flatly to a British of-
 ficial that all convoys of five
 vehicles or more must agree to
 dismounting.   In a conversation
 with a US officer on 15 October,
 the Soviet commander claimed
 that the US had agreed last year
 to give advance notification for
 convoys of more than five vehicles
 and said this same procedure
 should apply to dismounting.  He
 added that even if a truck con-
 tained only one to five passen-
 gers, they would have to dismount.
 While the USSR almost cer-
 tainly expects the US to reject
 these demands, it probably hopes
 that continued publicity rela-
 tive to the ambiguity and dif-
 ferences which exist between the
 US and British convoy procedures
 will tend to underscore the need
 for negotiations to remove
 "misunderstandings."
 The USSR may have calculated
 that a display of pressure on

 the sensitive Berlin access
 question was necessary to induce
 the US and Britain to disregard
 French and West German opposi-
 tion to negotiations on Berlin
 at this time.
 Moscow probably foresees
 a protracted period of negotia-
 tions and plans to follow a step-
 by-step approach, using discus-
 sion of access procedures as
 an avenue for leading into the
 central problem of the status
 of Western forces in West Berlin.
 As part of this strategy, the
 Russians may envisage further
 harassment of Western communi-
 cations as a means of-underscor-
 ing the issues they intend to
 press as well as generating
 pressure on the West to agree
 to negotiations.
 The Soviet Union may, in
 fact, be preparing the way for
 formally introducing demands
 for Western payment for the use
 of communications facilities on
 East German territory.
 In talks with US and Brit-
 ish leaders this summer, both
 Khrushchev and Gromyko referred
 to the need for a new tariff on
 Western military and civilian
 rail transport, autobahn tolls
 on Western military personnel
 and cargo transport, and pay-
 ment for the use of communica-
 tion cables crossing East Ger-
 many.  The USSR almost certainly
 would attempt to use negotiations
 on these matters to press its
 demand for Western respect for
 East German "sovereign rights."
 Moscow presumably intends
 to maintain close control over
 these harassments in order to
 avoid 'irreparable  damage to
 the detente atmosphere.  The
 Soviet leaders, however, appear
 to be operating on the assumption
 that the US and Britain also
 have an interest in preserving
 this atmosphere and that this
 situation affords the USSR
 greater latitude for maneuvers
 to draw the West into a new
 round of Berlin talks.
 Soviet press reports of
 the incidents have sought to
 minimize the seriousness of the
 confrontation.  Playing down
 the challenge to the US and
 British convoys, Izvestia claimed
 that President Kennedy had ob-
 served that the incident resulted
 from a misunderstanding rather
 than a deliberate provocation.

 CONTINUED RUMORS OF IMMINENT WORLD COMMUNIST MEETING
 Rumors that Moscow has decided
 to convene some kind of interna-
 tional conference which would deal
 with the Sino-Soviet conflict con-
 tinue to circulate in the Soviet
 capital.
 Current rumors may have been
 generated by the presence in Mos-
 cow of two of the top Italian Com-
 munist leaders.   There are as yet
 no indications that leaders of
 other Communist parties are in the
 USSR.   The Portuguese party state-
 ment published in Pravda on 24
 September calling for a world Com-
 munist conference, however, had
 urged the creation of a commission
 composed of "some" parties to con-
 sider "practical questions linked
 with the convening of a conference,"
 and it is possible that such a meet-
 ing is being held outside Moscow.
 Khrushchev has not been in the cap-
 ital since 11 September.  He was
 reported by the US Embassy to have
 been seen on 7 October in Yalta,
 where he often meets foreign guests,
 and he was still in the Crimea on
 17 October.
 Foreign Communist parties con-
 tinue to call for an international
 meeting to discuss the problems
 that plague the Communist movement.
 Pravda on 13 October followed its
 earlier re-publication of appeals
 by three small Western Communist
 parties for such a conference with
 a reprint of a speech by French
 party leader Thorez which asked
 for a meeting.   The Greek party's
 resolution at the close of its
 fifth plenum--publicized on 12 Oc-
 tober--similarly contains a re-
 quest for a meeting, while strongly
 denouncing the Chinese.   This sud-
 den concerted attention to the issue
 suggests that the rumors may have
 some foundation.
 Moscow itself has not yet
 stated a position, but is making it
 clear that any such Communist meet-
 ing will be to condemn the Chinese,
 not to try to find a way to live
 with them.   The latest issues of
 both Kommunist, the Soviet theoret-
 ical journal,and the World Marxist
 Review,. another mouthpiece for
 oet views, carry systematic in-
 dictments of Chinese positions on
 virtually every disputed point.
 A more serious attack on Mao
 Tse-tung's personal apostasy is
 contained in the 11 October issue
 of Izvestia, where, in the guise
 of a c    que of a Chinese book on
 dialectical materialism, Mao's
 pretensions to be the foremost con-
 temporary Marxist theoretician are
 torn to shreds.   Izvestia ridicules
 the idea that Mao  ail s made any new
 contributions to Communist theory
 and claims that any new formulations
 he has advanced are at variance with,
 or a "falsification" of, true,
 Marxist-Leninist thought.
 Peiping has not seen fit to
 comment on recent demands for a
 meeting of Communist leaders, al-
 though it would almost certainly
 be aware of plans for one.   It may
 be holding its fire temporarily in
 preparation for a showdown fight.
 The Chinese continue to snipe at
 Moscow but have issued no full-
 dress polemical statement since
 the blast at Khrushchev in the Red
 Flag/People's Daily article of T6-
 September on Yugoslavia.   Instead
 Chou En-lai took a careful line on
 Sino-Soviet relations during his
 interview with the head of Reuters
 on 13 October, striking a pose of
 statesmanlike restraint but giving
 no ground on Peiping's differences

 The Communist World
 IMPACT OF HARVEST FAILURE WITHIN USSR
 The impact of the grain
 harvest failure continues to
 dominate Soviet internal affairs.
 Moscow is taking steps to lessen
 its effect on the economy, and
 reassure the population that meas-
 ures are being adopted to avoid
 like failures in the future.
 Khrushchev's recent speech
 at Krasnodar--in which he told
 of the Soviet grain purchases
 but also outlined a comprehen-
 sive plan for ensuring "guaran-
 teed harvests" through extensive
 use of chemical fertilizer and
 irrigation--is being given mass
 distribution as a pamphlet.
 An unusually large press
 campaign in support of this plan
 is under way, obviously calcu-
 lated to impress the public with
 the remedial action being taken.
 In the first twelve days of Oc-
 tober, Pravda, Izvestia, and
 Sovetskayaaossiya (the princi-
 pal paper of the Russian Re-
 public) published nearly 70 ma-
 jor articles, editorials, and
 pictorial features--including
 coverage of Khrushchev's Kras-
 nodar speech and the related
 Central Committee - Council of
 Ministers' letter, both of which
 dominated the papers on the days
 they appeared.
 The press has announced a
 number of measures to conserve
 the bread and grain supplies.
 These include restrictions on
 bread sold at stores, the sta-
 tioning of Young Communist
 League members as guards at
 stores and warehouses, and a
 vigorous campaign to discredit
 the use of bread for livestock.
 Late last month a national trade
 union conference was called to
 discuss means of checking on
 grain distribution and storage.
 This year's agricultural
 failure apparently will have
 a serious impact on the Soviet
 livestock industry.   Fodder
 shortages are almost certain
 to necessitate emergency slaugh-
 tering of cattle.   It seems
 likely that the regime will
 import feed grains before al-
 lowing such measures to jeop-
 ardize the future of the live-
 stock industry.  Even so, there
 will be serious consequences--
 slaughterhouses and refrigera-

 be overloaded and much waste
 will occur.

 top Soviet trade officials have
 advocated new measures for solv-
 ing the perennial deficiencies
 in retail trade--goods and serv-
 ices  of poor quality and un-
 suited to the needs of the con-
 sumer.              One trade official sug-
 gested that light industrial
 manufacturing firms be required
 to develop their own retail
 stores which would, presumably,
 be more responsive to the cus-
 tomers' wishes; another advo-
 cated the creation of a national
 specialized wholesale organiza-
 tion; another would have bonuses
 paid to workers in light indus-
 try depend upon the salability
 of their product.
 There is no doubt that Mos-
 cow is acutely concerned over
 offsetting the poor harvest with
 better performance in other con-
 sumer-oriented areas.  Prospects,
 however, are meager for signifi-
 cant improvement through admin-
 istrative devices alone.  The
 last major administrative step
 the government took to improve
 retail trade was in 1960 when
 it decreed that manufacturers
 would sign binding contracts
 with trade outlets to provide
 goods of specified quality and
 quantity.   Soviet officials have
 recently admitted that this law
 has been largely ineffective.
 The 1963 naval convoy
 through the USSR's Northern Sea
 Route has completed the arduous
 eastward transit of Arctic
 waters and now is in the Soviet
 Far East.   The convoy, which in-
 cluded both merchant and naval
 ships, left the Murmansk area
 probably in late August and ar-
 rived at the Bering Strait in
 two groups on 27 September and
 10 October.
 Naval elements of the con-
 voy consisted of two new long-
 range F-class torpedo-attack
 submarines, a naval tanker, two
 ocean rescue tugs, two floating
 workshops, and two new missile
 range instrumentation ships,
 the Chazhma and the Chumikan.
 Most obese, including    e
 submarines and the range ships,
 probably will be stationed at
 the expanding complex of naval
 bases in the Petropavlovsk area.
 The transfers bring the number
 of F-class submarines in the
 Pacific Fleet to eight and
 the number of range instrumen-
 tation ships to six.

 VIEWS OF WESTERN DIPLOMATS ON COMMUNIST CHINA
 A grim picture of the in-
 ternal Chinese Communist scene
 has recently been sketched by
 two Western diplomats stationed
 in China.  They are considered
 perceptive and sound observers
 by the American consul general
 in Hong Kong.   Both describe a
 country whose economic problems
 are grave, whose recovery from
 the years of disaster is very
 slow, whose people remain in a
 state of "resigned apathy"
 despite incessant political in-
 doctrination, and whose leaders
 will probably become still more
 rigid..
 Chinese leaders are report
 edly far from optimistic be-
 cause of continued population
 growth and the lack of any
 prospect for substantial pro-
 duction increases in the next
 few years.  To solve popula-
 tion problems, authorities in
 Shanghai are advocating late
 marriage and sterilization,
 with fairly severe sanctions--
 involving income and housing--
 applied to those who marry too
 early or have too many children.
 This program is unlikely to
 have much success, however.
 In agreement with most for-
 eigners who have traveled in
 North China during the last two
 months, the diplomats report
 that extensive flooding per-
 sisted for an unusually long
 time, and, as a result, agri-
 cultural prospects appear only
 mediocre for yet another year.
 Industry gives the impression
 of "great" technical difficul-
 ties, redundant labor, and much
 idle capacity.
 The British consul in Shang-
 hai, a Chinese-speaking officer
 who apparently has more freedom
 than diplomats in Peiping to
 maintain local contacts, believes
 that most people have learned
 by now to "coexist" with the
 regime.   They pay little atten-
 tion to ideological matters,
 judging the regime instead on
 the basis of what it is doing
 for them materially, and are
 therefore dissatisfied because
 they believe the regime is not
 doing enough.
 A Western ambassador sta-
 tioned in Peiping agrees that
 more material incentives are
 necessary to bring peasants
 and ordinary workers out of their
 lethargy, but feels there is
 still some residual idealism
 among middle level officials
 such as plant managers.
 The ambassador expects
 China's policies--both internal
 and external--to become tougher
 and less flexible before they
 are eventually moderated.  He
 foresees no softening of policies
 during the political lifetime
 of Mao Tse-tung.  He thinks
 that in the immediate post-Mao
 period,  "hard-liners" like party
 General Secretary Teng Hsiao-
 ping will eclipse moderates
 like Premier Chou En-lai.   More-
 over, he believes that the next
 generation of leaders, now 35
 to 45 years old, will prove
 even less flexible than the
 present group, because they are
 even more ignorant of the outer
 world and were developed within
 a completely indoctrinated
 bureaucrat .

 The Soviet bloc and Communist
 China are unlikely to provide
 significant or effective economic
 aid for Indonesia in solving prob-
 lems apt to arise from Djakarta's
 action in cutting off economic
 relations with  Malaysia-   They
 may, however, offer some economic
 assistance as a political gesture.
 No source of meaningful aid is
 yet in sight.
 By severing relations, Indo-
 nesia has lost Malaysia's con-
 siderable entrepot services and
 processing facilities, and a
 market which received--legally and
 by smuggling--some 50 percent of
 its exports last year.   Most of
 these goods were re-exported.
 Although the Indonesians--
 apparently referring to aid in
 general--claim the USSR has al-
 ready offered all they need "to
 carry out economic confrontation
 against Malaysia," it is unlikely
 that the USSR will be drawn too
 deeply into this dispute in view
 of wider foreign policy considera-
 tions.
 As part of an earlier program
 to develop resources on a produc-
 tion-sharing basis, the Soviet
 Union reportedly has offered some
 rubber-processing facilities,
 but such an offer would take con-
 siderable time to implement.   The
 Soviet bloc may also take addi-
 tional token imports of Indonesian
 rubber, but it is unlikely to
 shift substantial purchases from
 the reliable and efficient Malay-
 sian market--from which it bought
 about 220,000 tons last year.
 Imports by the Soviet
 bloc--mainly 130,000 tons of
 rubber--amounted to about 5
 percent of Indonesia's total
 exports in 1962.   Additional
 bloc purchases would probably
 be largely under a barter arrange-
 ment and, like the production-
 sharing schemes, would not add
 hard currencies to Indonesia's
 limited foreign exchange earn-
 ings.
 Prospects that the Soviet
 bloc will extend other meaning-
 ful economic assistance also
 appear dim.  The USSR has avoided
 outright cash gifts, but as a
 gesture, it may offer Djakarta
 additional long-term economic
 credits.   However, to date, In-
 donesia has drawn only about
 23 percent of available Soviet
 bloc credits.
 Unlike Moscow, Peiping may
 grant a small cash gift as it
 has elsewhere this year, but
 substantial economic assistance  25X1
 from Peiping in the near future
 is not likely.   Normal trade
 gives only limited opportunity to
 support Indonesia.   Presently
 China takes only 6 percent of
 Djakarta's exports, mostly rubber.
 Since the Chinese also receive
 large amounts of rubber from Ceylon
 under a long-term agreement, they
 probably can absorb little more.
 Trade in other products, such as
 agricultural goods,tin, or crude
 oil would have little economic
 basis.
 Furthermore Peiping is ap-
 parently unwilling to make. any
 significant change in its Malay-
 sia trade, which earned China
 about $70 million last year,
 Peiping's second largest source
 of foreign exchan e.

 The Diem regime continues
 to take repressive measures
 against potential opponents.
 Police last week picked up
 the brother of President Diem's
 personal physician after re-
 portedly finding'pro-Buddhist
 tracts and printing equipment
 in his home.  The government's
 administrative delegate in the
 southeastern provinces reported
 the arrest of his aide, al-
 legedly on grounds that the
 latter was "too pro-American."
 A Vietnamese interpreter at-
 tached to the US aid mission
 was also reported to have been
 arrested on unknown charges.
 On 14 October, however,
 the government released a sen-
 ior vice president  of South
 Vietnam's strongest trade union,
 the General Confederation of
 Vietnamese Labor (CVTC), who
 had been secretly arrested on
 7 October.  This was apparently
 in response to an ultimatum
 from the CVTC president, Tran
 Quoc Buu, who was threatening
 an open break with the govern-
 ment if it did not free the
 official.   The government pre-
 sumably feared possible reper-
 cussions from domestic or in-
 ternational labor circles, par-
 ticularly during the visits
 of UN-sponsored observers, who
 are scheduled to depart for
 South Vietnam on 21 October.
 There are further signs
 that Diem and his brother Nhu
 are preparing to face a long
 period of strain with the US.
 Saigon's English-language press,
 which reflects the views of
 Nhu and his wife, has continued
 to charge that US agencies in
 Saigon are trying to undermine
 the Diem regime.
 Joint US-Vietnamese counter-
 insurgency activities, however,
 are continuing without serious
 interruption.  Viet Cong activ-
 ity in the first week of Octo-
 ber declined in most areas of
 the country, following five
 weeks of more intensified enemy

 The Somali Republic, trying
 to strengthen its defenses
 against its archenemy, Ethiopia,
 has accepted  a Soviet offer
 of $28 million worth of mili-
 tary assistance.   Somali Army
 commander General Daud led the
 mission which obtained Moscow's
 help. According to Prime Minis-
 ter Abdirascid, Soviet assistance
 is to be used generally only for
 short-term training.   However,
 the large amount of the offer
 suggests that a variety of So-
 viet military equipment will be
 supplied as well.
 In the nonmilitary field,
 Moscow and the European satel-
 lites have already extended some
 $63 million in grants and credits
 to the republic, and over 300
 bloc technicians are at work
 there on various development
 projects.   In addition, Peiping
 has offered over $20 million in
 economic assistance
 The Soviet
 airline,Aeroflot, has recently
 been granted full rights at
 Mogadiscio, the Somali capital.
 As a result of the Somali
 military deal with the USSR,
 both Germany and Italy are likely
 to re-examine their own rela-
 tively modest plans to assist the
 Somali Army.   If these plans are
 dropped, the Somalis could expect
 no significant help from any
 other Western European nation.
 They are still embroiled in a
 dispute with the UK and Kenya
 over territorial claims; dip-
 lomatic relations with the UK
 were broken last March.   France
 maintains close relations with
 Ethiopia.   The bloc probably
 would not rush in to fill the
 vacuum completely, however, out
 of concern for its relations
 with Ethiopia and Kenya.
 Meanwhile, Mogadiscio's
 emotional involvement with the
 dissident Somali tribesmen in
 the Ogaden region of Ethiopia
 is again leading to serious
 friction with that country.
 Somali press and radio are venom-
 ously attacking the Ethiopian'
 regime.   Frontier incidents
 occurred along the Ethiopian-
 Somali border on 11, 12, and 15
 October, leaving several dead
 on both sides.
 The incidents provoked riot-
 ing in Mogadiscio on 13 October,
 partly because the populace be-
 lieves that the government has
 not taken a sufficiently strong
 stand.   The Ethiopian Embassy
 and other foreign--even Soviet--
 personnel were attacked, but
 extensive damage was. prevented
 by the effective action of the
 Somali police.
 The situation both on the
 border and in the capital re-

 has left the cabinet itself as
 the sole target for public resent-

 The premier is en

 men say they do not contemplate
 a general strike to enforce
 these demands, but threaten a
 kind of political strike by
 refusing to participate in draft-
 ing a new Congo constitution un-
 less the government is changed.
 The impact of their threat
 lies in the fact that there are
 no other mass political organi-

 acutely conscious of the fact
 that labor unions were the

 Thus the threat by Leopold-

 as
 led to frantic maneuvering by
 the politicians.  Moreover,
 there is no guarantee that the
 unions will not eventually try
 a general strike.   Should they
 do so,- serious disorders would
 seem likely.  Such disorders
 not only would provide further
 ammunition for the anti-Adoula

 ITALIAN POLITICAL SITUATION ON EVE OF SOCIALIST CONGRESS
 The Socialist party congress
 of 25-29 October will probably
 authorize party chief Pietro
 Nenni to negotiate with the
 Christian Democrats for direct
 Socialist participation in a
 new center-left government.  The
 obstacles to the formation of
 such a government, however, are
 formidable.
 Although Nenni's faction
 seems likely to maintain its
 majority during the congress,
 dissension within the faction
 may develop afterward during
 Nenni's negotiations over the
 terms for collaboration with the
 other parties.   National eco-
 nomic policy is likely to be the
 most critical issue.   Riccardo
 Lombardi, Nenni's heir opponent,
 may disrupt these discussions,
 as he did those last June, if
 he is dissatisfied with the
 understanding Nenni reaches with
 the Christian Democrats on eco-
 nomic and social measures P
 Despite the Socialists'
 private assurances that they
 will not ask for unreasonable
 public expenditures in the near
 future, Christian Democratic
 leader Aldo Moro has expressed
 doubt about the Socialists'
 readiness to assume governmental.
 responsibilities in the present
 difficult economic situation,
 which may cause his own party
 .to propose a "wage pause" or
 other austerity measures.   He
 has told the US Embassy that
 his party can make no conces-
 sions other than  "for appear-
 ances" beyond those embodied in
 the Nenni-Moro accord of last
 June, which Lombardi rejected.
 Even if his negotiations with
 the Socialists are successful,
 Moro is seriously concerned
 that Social Democratic leader
 Giuseppe Saragat might at some
 point "precipitate an insoluble
 crisis by one of his sudden
 changes of heart."
 Conservative  Christian
 Democrats will try to take ad-
 vantage of the economic situa-
 tion to exact conditions which
 would be unacceptable to the
 Socialists.   Although the out-
 come of the negotiations will
 not hinge on foreign policy
 issues, Conservative Christian
 Democrats and the right-wing
 parties are also using Lombardi's
 recent attack on the multilateral
 nuclear force proposal to claim
 that the Socialists would dan-
 gerously alter Italy's foreign
 policy.   It might be necessary
 to convene a Christian Demo-
 cratic congress to get the
 party as a whole to accept an
 alliance with the Socialists.
 There is a strong probabil-
 ity that the Communists and neo-
 Fascists will initiate violence'
 as they try to block the forma-
 tion of a center-left govern-
 ment.   Using some legitimate
 economic issue, they are likely
 to create disturbances in which
 Socialists would feel impelled
 to demonstrate with the Commu-
 nists.   Such joint action would
 be exploited by opponents of
 Socialist -  Christian Demo-
 cratic rapprochement: to but-
 tress their claim that the
 Communists and Socialists remain
 politically united, and that
 formation of the center-left

 felt compelled to bury 1heir
 enmities in the face of  Soviet
 occupation of the eastern sec-
 tion of the country.   After the
 Russians left in ltib  ,  however,
 maintenance of  the  coalition be-
 came progressively more dii_1:1culL
 and was notably so a.' tear they
 bitterly contested   1962 elections.
 Friction has been .Lncreasin;.
 in the coalition for some months.
 Last spring the Socialists used
 Liberal, support to score a par-
 liamentary victory over their
 coalition partners in preventing
 Otto Iiabsburg's return to Austria.
 Last montu,  the P ople's 1';crty
 elected a:; chai.rnt.cn Josef Klaus,
 who has for some  i..ime been noted
 as less concilia i ory to the
 Socialist; than firs predecessor,
 Chancellor Gorba g a .   Gorbach
 will probably be  replaced fairly
 soon as cuancel_icr--possibly by
 Klaus--if the co:i iition lists.
 The i,ibera.l [arty has in the
 past sought all :i ,i rice with the
 more conservative People's Party
 but was reebuffe(t :aecause of the
 unsavory reputai,on of some of
 its membership.   Now Socialist
 leaders are dic.grin;' with the
 Liberals and secs,    to be carrying
