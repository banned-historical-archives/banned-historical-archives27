 March 21, 1966         CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 these different kinds of products is put in
 the same size can. Naturally, the weight
 between cans is going to vary because of the
 way they are packed. Whole tuna in oil,
 for example, will have a different weight
 than chunk tuna in oil, even though they
 are both in the same size can. Why do manu-
 facturers do this? Well, simply so that they
 can get maximum use out of their can mak-
 ing and can filling machinery and still offer
 variety to consumers.  This makes for good
 consumer values.  Yet, many of the con-
 sumer spokesmen cry that this causes con-
 fusion and that the weight should be stand-
 ardized instead.  And, they make no men-
 tion of the fact that this will add to costs.
 Again, I question whether this kind of pro-
 tection is worth the price.
 The main thing here is that there has been
 a sizable and regrettable misunderstanding
 in the minds of these very well-meaning
 people about what consumers actually want
 in terms of value.  Most of the consumer
 movement today is involved in trying to
 'push through legislative and administrative
 measures to assure that consumers can al-
 ways find the thing that costs them least per
 ounce.
 But speaking for myself-and, I believe,
 most other shoppers-I can assure them that,
 while price comparisons are important, they
 are only part of the way in which I judge
 value.  Of far greater importance, it seems
 to me, is the intangible, subjective question
 of whether or not a product is going to sat-
 isfy myself and my family.
 If we want bran flakes, for example, the
 fact that oatmeal may (or may not)  be
 less expensive per pound doesn't really make
 any difference to me.  The value really lies,
 in that case, in the more expensive product.
 And making it easier for me to make this-
 to me--essentially meaningless comparison
 isn't going to earn my appreciation, espe-
 cially if doing so has raised the cost of both
 products.
 But, the consumer spokesmen say, this is
 of vital importance to the poor, and should
 be done for them.  Yet while it is unques-
 tionably true that helping the poor get more
 for their money is a worthy enterprise, I
 sincerely question whether the mass of con-
 sumer protection ideas will really do the
 job.
 I question this because I believe that the
 most common consumer protection measures
 are designed to solve essentially imaginary
 problems, ignore the real problems, and in
 any case, mistakenly assume that treating
 poverty's symptoms will somehow cure the
 disease.
 It is a fact, I believe, that supermarket
 shopping today does present some problems.
 But the problems are not those of simple
 price comparisons.  A more basic problem is
 the fact that businessmen's sheer inventive-
 ness and ingenuity has spawned such a great
 variety of new and tempting products that
 how to best use them presents some very
 real shopping problems.
 These are problems of abundance, not
 foisted off on an unsuspecting public, but
 offered us in an atmosphere of free choice.
 Many consumer spokesmen say this itself
 is a bad feature of the American marketplace
 and that the confusion this creates should
 be diminished by somehow restricting the
 number of new products that come on the
 market.  How this would be done, I do not
 know. I aril convinced that shoppers are
 more grateful to the businessmen who found
 they could package au gratin potatoes in
 convenient packages than they are to their
 spokesmen who, in the hysterical discovery
 of the obvious, complain that the packaged
 form is tar more expensive than the ingredi-
 ents.
 The real problem is not standardizing
 boxes or ooslteny s..   The real problem is
 educating and training people to make the
 best use of the WDilldauce that is available
 to them.  And solving the problem begins
 with an effort directed at the people, rather
 than at the products.
 The fact that a shopper can instantly rec-
 ognize the lowest cost item available to her
 in a certain ctaegory is meaningless if she
 hasn't got enough money to buy the product
 in the first place.  The fact that a buyer of
 something on credit can instantly recognize
 a high rate of interest is meaningless to him
 if he needs the product and can't got the
 credit at a lower interest rate.
 Concerning credit, the pressure is building
 for passage of credit control bills.
 You should know and be pleased that your
 California statute regulating credit and in-
 stallment sales of goods and services, which
 I believe is known as the Unruh Act, is looked
 up to nationally as a model law.  In it, we
 see reasonable legislation that has met the
 needs of the consumer and industry excep-
 tionally well.  It has furnished to the con-
 sumer adequate information upon which to
 make a decision on choosing the business-
 man to whom he will offer his credit.
 Likewise, conformity with the law has pre-
 sented no problem to the seller who wishes
 to follow the precepts of good bsuiness.  The
 proof of the Unruh Act's sufficiency is in the
 fact that it has withstood the acid test of
 years.  Proposals to amend it-allegedly for
 greater protection of the consumer-have
 been rejected when the spotlight showed up
 the fuzzy thinking behind such proposals.
 These, in fact, were poorly concealed efforts
 to put a straitjacket on the granting of credit
 to service retailing's customers and to facili-
 tate merchandising.
 For many Americans, poverty is a very real
 and grinding truth.  What can be done to
 mitigate it should and must be done.  But
 careful listing of price comparisons or in-
 terest rates are of little help to someone who
 can't read or judge.  And it seems to me that
 if anywhere near half the effort currently
 being expended in the name of consumer
 protection were spent instead on educational
 efforts aimed at helping make smaxt shop-
 pers out of today's buyers, something far
 more valuable would be accomplished.
 Supermarket people tell me that the real
 secret to wise buying in their stores involves
 simply building a shopping list around a set
 budget, and then sticking to the list when
 you get to the store.  Additionally, a recent
 U.S. Department of Agriculture study shows
 that shopping a store's specials will allow a
 consumer to chop 16 percent a year off of her
 food expenditures.
 My point is that manufacturing and retail-
 ers, competing for our patronage, offer us
 values.  We will be best off as we best learn
 to turn these honest competitive efforts to
 our own advantage, turning the attributes of
 the system to our own use.  Only this way
 can we get the protection we really need.
 I think by now you have gotten the point
 that I do not believe that we should look at
 today's supermarkets as a vast wasteland.
 As consumers we should look with grateful
 eyes  on the  supermarket as a bountiful,
 even though often confusing and bewilder-
 ing, symbol of the inventiveness and in-
 genuity of the food industry and the abun-
 dance of the Nation's farms.  In trying to
 make a ,balanced judgment of value, I ask
 myself, "Am I willing to pay the price of
 some confusion and doubt for the tremen-
 dous variety of wonderful food that is being
 brought to me and my dinner table in an
 ever-increasing  palatable  and  convenient
 form?"  My answer is. "Yes, sir," without
 qualification.  I'm glad to pay the price of
 some doubtful decisions rather than have our
 American farmers pay the high prices of sea-
 sonal and sharply reduced markets.  And, as
 a working wife myself, I would be the last
 to suggest to 8 million women who divide
 their time between a home and a job that
 they can't have the convenient food forms
 that make their tasks less burdensome. And
 A1611
 those are only a couple of the alternatives
 that would arise if some of the regulators
 of the marketplace had their way.
 Instead, there is a very practical and pos-
 sible way to reduce the price of confusion
 in choicemaking-not by turning the Na-
 tion's supermarkets into a stultifying pano-
 rama of bland stimularity but rather edu-
 cating consumers to the point that they can
 best use the variety which is offered.
 There is a great challenge here to many
 persons in our country-to the food editors,
 to the home- economists, to our schools, and
 to our consumer education services at vari-
 ous levels of our government.  Too few peo-
 ple are trying to help our consumers buy
 wisely in relation to their needs. One house-
 wife's "giant economy size" can easily be
 another housewife's waste.  Consumer edu-
 cation should be oriented more to the buying
 and using of foods than to cooking.  Formal-
 ized education in our schools has a                                                                                                                                      tre-
 mendous challenge to keep pace with new
 products and services and changing methods
 or distributidn.  In only a few schools are
 they meeting this challenge.  As one critic
 commented  the    other  day, "Virtually all
 courses- in  the field are cup-and-teaspoon
 oriented while we live in a thaw-and-serve
 age."  Yet, just last year, half the popula-
 tion of the United States became 25 years
 old or younger-40 percent of our popula-
 tion Is under 20.  Studies show that 80 per-
 cent of all teenage girls shop for their fami-
 ly's food and spend one-fourth of the entire
 family food budget-97 percent of them help
 plan the meals and help cook them.  This is
 a real challenge in consumer education start-
 ing at the teenage level.
 And I would like to give the knuckles of
 industry a gentle rap in this connection.
 What are they doing in the field of con-
 sumer education?  As one industry spokes-
 man admitted the other day.  "We have,
 perhaps, become so interested in engineering
 change that we have neglected to tell any-
 body about the significance or implications
 of the changes in terms of the basics of
 shopping cart and kitchen economics, rather
 than dated statistics."
 The whole point I am trying to make is
 that an educated consumer is a protected
 consumer.  And a dynamic, changing, keenly
 competitive food industry makes a happy
 and fortunate consumer.
 To quote myself from a speech made some
 time ago.
 "All the government officials and all the
 government laws in the world are as noth-
 ing compared to the impact Mrs. America has
 on Mr. Manufacturer and on Mr. Storekeeper
 when she makes up her mind to buy one
 brand over another.  And when she makes
 that decision, no power on earth can save the
 businessman or the producer of the product
 who made the' mistake of displeasing her.
 She has done and is doing a wonderful job
 In  needling,  inspiring,  and  in  regulating
 American business enterprise.
 "And, to reward her, I want to protect her.
 Not with more government regulations and
 laws--I want to protect her freedom of
 choice."

 "The General Federation of Women's Clubs
 is the largest organization of women in the
 world, and each and every member is grate-
 ful to, the writers of the Constitution for
 giving the American people the right to
 amend the Constitution.
 "Just as the 19th amendment gave Ameri-
 can women the right to vote, the proposed
 reapportionment amendment, now before the
 U.S. Senate, would provide the citizens of
 each State the right to decide on whether
 they want both houses, or simply one house,
 of their legislatures composed on a popula-
 tion-only basis. Could anything be more fair
 than to let the people vote on this issue?  It
 is difficult to understand why some people op-
 pose this proposed amendment and that
 fundamental right.
 "We have faith in the democratic pro-
 cess-that process which guarantees to the
 people the right to decide.  That is all this
 issue is about-whether or not the people
 have the right to decide for themselves."
 DEAR CLUB PRESIDENT:  On June 15, 1964,
 the Supreme Court of the United States
 handed down decisions dealing with the re-
 apportionment of State legislatures.  The
 decisions promulgated the broad rule that
 "* * * the Equal Protection Clause (of the
 14th amendment) requires both houses of a
 State legislature to be apportioned on a
 population basis."
 This action by the Supreme Court ruled
 as unconstitutional the long-cherished prac-
 tice that a State could apportion one house
 of its legislature along geographical lines.
 It  upset  long-established institutions  of
 government.  It ordered an end to appor-
 tionment on a basis that reflects the various
 interests within a State.  It restricted ap-
 portionment solely to the basis of popula-
 tion.
 The impact was immediate in every State
 and has since led to confusion in the courts,
 legislative deadlocks, and general political
 uncertainty as to the legal status of politi-
 cal subdivisions of every kind, including the
 U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
 Concerned Americans, seeking to end this
 unprecedented chaos and to restore political
 order and truly representative government,
 are working to achieve adoption of a cor-
 rective constitutional amendment, popularly
 known as the Dirksen amendment.
 At the General Federation of Women's
 Clubs Convention last June a resolution en-
 titled  "Legislative  Apportionment"  was
 unanimously adopted.  The resolved of that
 resolution reads: "Resolved, That the Gen-
 eral Federation of Women's Clubs urges the
 Members of the Congress to enact legislation
 that would guarantee to the States the right
 to apportion their representation in legisla-
 tive bodies."
 'Senator EVERETT DIRKSEN, of Illinois, has
 introduced a constitutional amendment in
 the U.S. Senate (S.J. Res. 103)  which has
 been cosponsored by members of both politi-
 cal parties and which has bipartisan sup-
 port.            Senate Joint Resolution 103 proposes
 an amendment to the Constitution of the
 United States "to preserve to the people of
 each State power to determine the compo-
 sition of its legislature and the apportion-
 ment of the membership thereof in accord-
 ance with law and the provisions of the
 Constitution of the United Statets."
 The enclosed pamphlet entitled "Let the
 People Decide" [not shown in RECORD] brief-
 ly but clearly explains how you and the
 .Members of your club can best make your
 voices heard on this most important con-
 stitutional question.  I sincerely urge you to
 give it your very careful consideration.
 My warmest regards to you and all the
 other members of your club,
 Most cordially,
 Mrs. WILLIAM It. HASEDROOCK,
 President.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, over
 500 State legislators have given new sup-
 port to this legislative reapportionment,
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed at this point in the
 RECORD a release which deals with the
 support given to legislative reappor-
 tionment by State legislators.
 There being no objection, the release
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [A Committee for Government of the People
 release, Mar. 16, 1966]
 STATE LEGISLATORS GIVE HEAVY NEW SUPPORT
 TO REAPPORTIONMENT AMENDMENT
 Some 500 State legislators from through-
 out the Nation have joined in urging passage
 of Senate Joint Resolution 103, the reappor-
 tionment amendment pending in the Con-
 gress, and have become members of the Com-
 mittee for Government of the People, the
 bipartisan citizens organization conducting
 the national reapportionment campaign.
 "These, the men and women thoroughly
 experienced in State government, are among
 the strongest leaders in every State in the
 campaign to let the people decide how their
 State legislature is to be apportioned." Sena-
 tor EVERETT MCKINLEY DIRKSEN, chairman of
 the Committee for Government of the Peo-
 ple, announced today.
 "The reapportionment campaign, "DIRKSEN
 said, "is spreading like a prairie fire through-
 out the States.  The people of the country,"
 he said, "are demanding in an ever-swelling
 chorus of voices that Congress take affirma-
 tive action on the reapportionment amend-
 ment and let the people of each State decide
 this vital question by majority vote."
 Cochairmen with Senator DIRKSEN on the
 Committee for Government of the People are
 Senator FRANK CHURCH, Democrat of Idaho;
 Senator SPESSARD L. HOLLAND, Democrat of
 Florida; Senator ROMAN L. HRUSKA, Repub-
 lican of Nebraska; Senator FRANK J. LAUSCRE,

 L
 THE FUTURE OF ASIA
 Mr. CLARK.  Mr. President, the Sen-
 ate will consider on Monday the special
 appropriation for the Vietnam war.  On
 that occasion I expect to speak, not
 briefly, but not at great length.
 In thinking about this problem, I was
 interested to read in the Washington Post
 of March 16 a most interesting column
 by Joseph Kraft entitled "Four Pillars of
 Asia."  It occurs to me that the point of
 view expressed by Mr. Kraft is well worth
 consideration by all Members of the
 Senate.  I would even suggest that it
 might be worth prayerful thought by the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff and by the Secre-
 tary of State and the Secretary of
 Defense.
 A witticism going around the Capitol
 these days is that the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff no longer do exactly what Joe Alsop
 wants them to do.  It occurs to me that
 the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secre-
 tary of State might well do a little more:
 5853
 Do what Mr. Kraft would like to have
 them do.  He points out that the central
 strategic reality in Asia is not Vietnam
 at all, and that the future of Asia is not
 going to be settled by that tiny, little,
 and relatively little unimportant country.
 I am very fearful of that, because of
 our somewhat adolescent view that every
 endeavor we go into must end in com-
 plete victory, and because of an almost
 Chinese preoccupation with face on the
 part of a number of our rulers, we are
 getting lost so that we cannot see the
 Asian forest because we are looking all
 the time at the Vietnamese trees.
 Mr. Kraft points out that Communist
 China is by far the most important coun-
 try in Asia. He agrees, as I do, that the
 containment of China is important, in-
 deed, a very important objective of our
 foreign policy until such time as the bel-
 ligerence of the present phase of their
 Communist revolution fails.
 Mr..Kraft points out also that, whereas
 for many generations, if not for many
 centuries,  China  was  an  impotent
 dragon, she has largely, since the Com-
 munists took power, become a major
 military, economic, and social power in
 Asia, as, indeed, she was the only im-
 portant civilized country in the world a
 couple of thousand years ago.
 Mr. Kraft suggests, and I agree, that
 what the United States really ought to
 be doing in Vietnam now is continuing
 a holding operation which will prevent
 China from spilling all over southeast
 Asia, but that really, because of our geo-
 graphic position and many of the other
 disabilities which confront a white man
 when he engages in a land war on the
 ground mass of Asia, we are certainly
 not an ideal people to contain China in
 this regard, but rather, the countries
 which should be doing this are Japan,
 India, Indonesia, and Pakistan. Unfor-
 tunately, with the possible exception of
 Japan, none of those countries are pres-
 ently geared up enough, either economi-
 cally or militarily, to carry on the job of
 restoring the balance of power in Asia
 until such time as we can work out some
 sensible method under the rule of law
 and disarmament, and a less barbaric
 way, of keeping the peace than-by main-
 taining a balance of power.
 Mr. Kraft also points out that the ma-
 jor American interest should be in build-
 ing up these four pillars of Asia. What
 concerns me is that in view of our pre-
 occupation with Vietnam, we are going
 to devote so much of our wealth, so much
 of our foreign aid, and so much of our
 military efforts to Vietnam, and, as I say,
 to the Chinese effort to save face, that
 we will not adequately come into an ap-
 propriate economic and social alliance
 with those four pillars of Asia who, in
 the long run, are essential to the mainte-
 nance of the balance of power in that
 country.
 Mr. Kraft poses a final question which
 I think we should be seriously consider-
 ing here in the Senate, whether this
 country, in its executive branch, partic-
 ularly in the Defense Department and in
 the State Department, has the brains
 and the brawn to play the role of a great
 power.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE          March 17, 1966
 I think that is a matter that we should
 concern ourselves with as we debate the
 appropriation bill on Monday next.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that a copy of Mr. Kraft's article
 entitled "Four Pillars of Asia, published
 in the Washington Post of March 16,
 1966, be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 FOUR PILLARS OF ASIA
 (By Joseph Kraft)
 The Indonesian upheaval, whatever its
 final outcome, serves to underline the stra-
 tegic realities in Asia.  It puts Vietnam and
 the war there in true perspective.  And it
 poses the question whether this country has
 the wit, as well as the strength, to play the
 role of a great power.
 The central strategic reality in Asia, of
 course, is not Vietnam.  The enduring shape
 of things to come is not going to be deter-
 mined by that tiny, little molehill of a coun-
 try.                On the contrary, it is going to be deter-
 mined by the  vast mountain ranges  of
 countries that sprawl across the Asian main-
 land and its island fringes.
 The most important of these great coun-
 tries, by far, is China.  China is important
 by reason of its immense population, its
 great size, its central location, its ancient
 traditions, and its skills and resources.
 For many decades, China was in a state of
 political collapse.  During that period, she
 lost her rightful place in the Asian sun.
 But in the course of the last two or three
 decades, this central political weakness has
 been largely overcome.
 Now the Chinese are making their come-
 back.  They  are  asserting  themselves  all
 over the world, but particularly against their
 Immediate neighbors. And they are doing
 it in the spirit of revolutionary elan and
 boastful self-glorification that comes natur-
 ally to people long denied.
 In the long run, the restraint of Chinese
 self-aggrandisement will have to depend on
 the neighboring great powers.  Security, to
 put it another way, will have to rest on the
 four pillars of Asia.
 Japan, because of its advanced technology,
 large population, and cohesive political struc-
 ture, probably has the major role to play.
 As a close second, there is India, with its huge
 population,  its  unmistakably  democratic
 political system, and its growing economic
 power.
 In third position, comes Indonesia, the
 fifth most populous country in the world, and
 one of the richest in natural resources. And
 finally there is Pakistan, heavily populated,
 with a strong military tradition, and an econ-
 omy that has, as the phrase goes, taken off.
 For the time being, none of these countries
 Is able to play its full part in dealings with
 China.  All four have been afflicted by grave
 internal problems in the postwar era.  They
 have had to concentrate on domestic matters,
 to the exclusion of a larger international role.
 In these circumstances, with the four non-
 Chinese powers of Asia relatively prostrate, it
 has fallen to the United States to maintain
 the balance of power.  That is why Americans
 fought in Korea, and policed the Straits of
 Formosa.  And that is why-if there is any
 reason at all-Americans are now fighting in
 Vietnam.
 But to say that is to say that in the strict-
 est sense the Vietnam war is a holding opera-
 tion. This country is holding the line against
 the day when the Japanese, the Indians, the
 Indonesians, and the Pakistanis are them-
 selves strong enough to maintain a balance
 that will afford a measure of protection to the
 smaller states of Asia.
 It follows, accordingly, that the major
 American interest lies not in Vietnam, but in
 building up the four pillars of Asia to the
 point where they can. assume the burden this
 country has carried for so long.  The more
 so as all four countries, and especially Indo-
 nesia now, seem to be moving to rid them-
 selves of the shackles that limited their in-
 ternational role in the past.
 But how well is this sense of the priorities
 understood in the United States?  How many
 officials on how many occasions have made it
 plain that the United States had no great
 strategic interest directly at stake in Viet-
 nam?
 How many officials on how many occasions
 have indicaed that  this country was not
 fighting an ideological war against commu-
 nism, but only acting to right a dangerous
 imbalance of power?
 How massy officials on how many occasions
 have pointed out that this country was fight-
 ing a holding action, not a war aimed at
 defeating the other side?
 The answers that emerge when these ques-
 tions are posed suggest that the national
 record, notably in recent weeks and months,
 is not brilliant.  And that is why there re-
 mains the larger question of whether this
 country has the brain as well as the brawn to
 play the role as a great power.
 ADDRESS  BY  VICE  PRESIDENT
 HUMPHREY         AT THE GODDARD
 MEMORIAL DINNER
 Mr.          ANDERSON.   Mr. President, I
 have long had an interest in the annual
 presentation of the Goddard Award. Dr.
 Robert H. Goddard, in whose memory
 the award is made, did much of his
 pioneer rocket work in New Mexico. At
 ceremonies at the White House yesterday,
 President Johnson received the Goddard
 Award. This was a fitting tribute to the
 President's leadership in space which
 runs back many years to his service in
 the Senate.
 Vice President  HUMPHREY,  who is
 chairman of the National Aeronautics
 and Space Council, addressed the God-
 dard Memorial Dinner last night in con-
 nection with the award ceremonies and
 I ask that his remarks be printed in the
 RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 REMARKS  OF VICE PRESIDENT HUBERT HUM-
 PHREY                                                                                   AT  THE  GODDARD  MEMORIAL  DIN-
 NER,  WASHINGTON,                                                                                 D.C., MARCH 16, 1966
 Today we commemorate the 40th anni-
 versary of Dr. Robert Goddard's launching
 of the first liquid fuel rocket.
 As we all know so well, Dr. Goddard's rec-
 ognition came long, after it should have come.
 But today there is no question of his role in
 moving man into space.
 On the occasion of this anniversary, Presi-
 dent Johnson today received the Goddard
 Award.  I was privileged to take part in that
 ceremony, as chairman of the National Aero-
 nautics and Space Council.
 Tonight I particularly wish to commend
 the National Space Club-which already has
 done so much to open up the space age-
 on the award of its first annual Dr. Hugh
 L. Dryden Fellowship.
 When I addressed you a year ago I con-
 fessed myself a newcomer in space, but I
 promised to be a diligent student.
 I have not yet been put into orbit.  How-
 ever, I have logged over a quarter of a million
 miles in 80 missions here on earth-and
 many of those missions have included visits
 to NASA and Department of Defense field
 installations.  I have also visited a number
 of private industry installations vital to our
 space effort.
 And, of course, I have chaired a number of
 space council meetings and followed closely
 all aspects of our activity in space.
 Let me share with you tonight-i year
 later-a few of my thoughts concerning our
 space program.  I will begin by saying that
 I have been deeply impressed by the dedica-
 tion and high performance of those, both
 in Government and private sector, who par-
 ticipate in our national space effort.
 Our space program is a superb example of
 the kind of creative partnership for progress
 between Government and the private sector
 which increasingly marks all areas of our
 national life.
 I wish tonight to stress two things that
 have been very much on my mind regarding
 the space program.
 First. I am impressed by the vital impor-
 tance of maintaining the most meticulous
 standards of performance at every level of
 our space effort, from the worker on the shop
 floor right up to the top.
 Although this tremendous enterprise in-
 volves hundreds of thousands of people, it is
 vital that each Individual concerned in it
 fully recognize and fulfill his own Individual
 responsibility for its success.
 As you well know, the slightest slip-up,
 the smallest oversight, in any one of millions
 of processes and procedures can put critically
 Important  projects-and  human  lives-in
 jeopardy.
 I know that I am preaching to the con-
 verted here.  But I feel this cannot really be
 said too often.
 Second. I feel the necessity for cost con-
 sciousness.
 This is the need, to put it another way,
 of getting the most space for the tax dollar.
 These are times when we must exert high
 discipline in public expenditure.  And our
 space program eannot be exempt from that
 discipline.
 In this connection, I was interested to note
 the theme of the Fourth Goddard Memorial
 Symposium,  sponsored  by  the American
 Astronautical Society, which many of you
 have been attending for the past 2 days.
 Last year I spoke of the "year 2000." But
 the symposium this year chose to focus in-
 stead on the theme, "The Space Age in Fiscal
 Year 2001."
 Certainly,  Federal  appropriations today
 have an important bearing on where we will
 be in the future.
 I have examined the fiscal year 1967 space
 budgets with the greatest care.  I honestly
 believe that much can be accomplished with-
 in them although other priorities-notably
 our effort in Vietnam-have required post-
 ponement of some objectives.
 I also believe that we can and will achieve
 the goal set by Presidents Kennedy and John-
 son: a manned landing on the moon before
 197Q!
 My own confidence in our rapidly advanc-
 ing science assd technology is such that I can
 visualize many more dramatic achievements
 ahead, although I will fix no timetable for
 them.
 1. The exploration of the lunar surface,
 and possibly the establishment of one or
 more permanent bases there.
 2. The development. of a whole family of
 earth-orbiting stations, manned and supplied
 by regular ferry services.
 3. The building of spaceports in a number
 of places in this country for the departure
 and arrival of spacecraft.
 4. The development of recoverable and re-
 usable launching vehicles, and maneuverable
 space vehicles, with a consequent drastic re-
 duction in the cost of space travel.
 5. The improvement of propulsion meth-
 ods, with the use of nuclear as well as chem-

 will work out will depend upon the practi-
 cality of obtaining insurance for the venture.
 But not everyone takes such an enamored
 view of skiing in the border States.  In a re-
 cent articles in Sports Illustrated entitled
 "A No-Snow Slope to Nonsport," Bill Gilbert
 argues that snow machines, ski lifts and
 supei-heated lodges have taken all the un-
 comfortable and strenuous edges off of skiing
 and has made it a nonsport.  He commits
 the further heresy of implying that the
 modern skier cannot take the cold weather
 that is found in Colorado, Michigan and New
 England.
 "The heart of the southern skiland is now
 located in the Potomac River Basin-south-
 ern Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia," he
 says. "Innovation is apparently more highly
 regarded than tradition in soutern ski es-
 tablishments, just as it is in motels and
 bowling alleys," he continues, pointing to the
 recreational attractions from golf courses to
 pony rides which surround the slopes.
 Such insults, it should be pointed out,
 would make any Nordic-blooded ski devotee
 climb out of his indoor, pre-heated, Olympic-
 size, ski-lodge swimming pool and bury such
 writers with a blizzard of artificial, sprayed-
 from-a-nozzle snowballs.
 NATIONAL FUTURE HOMEMAKERS
 OF AMERICA WEEK
 Mr. PEARSON.  Mr. President, next
 Monday over 600,000 high school youths
 will start a 1-week observance of special
 importance, I feel, to all of us.
 The week March 27 through April 2 is
 National FHA Week, honoring the Fu-
 ture Homemakers of America.
 Started in 1945 as an incorporated
 nonprofit organization, it is supported
 by membership dues. It is sponsored by
 the U.S. Office of Education and the
 American Home Economics Association.
 There are 11,006 chapters of the FHA in
 secondary schools throughout the Unit-
 ed  States,  Puerto Rico,  the  Virgin
 Islands, as well as at American Army
 post schools.
 The FHA is a national organization of
 home economics students who are seri-
 ous minded, community spirited, and
 concerned about the responsibilities of
 the future-and more importantly are
 doing something about it.
 Kansas is proud to be represented on
 the FHA National Executive Council by
 Jim S. Solander of Garnett, Kans. This
 group leads the national organization.
 A 4-year national work program is
 aimed at helping each young lady rec-
 ognize her abilities, strive for full devel-
 opment and participate actively in fam-
 ily, community, and world improvement
 projects.  In Kansas some 8,854 young
 ladies participate in 151 chapters.  Just
 a week ago they held their State conven-
 tion in Topeka with 2,000 youngsters and
 500 adults attending.
 An idea of the FHA purpose and pro-
 gram can be seen by chapter activities.
 For example, at Frankfort, Kans., the
 chapter conducted a program on men-
 tal health featuring Dr. Robert Hughes,
 the Marshal County health officer, who
 was able to correct many misconceptions
 the students had regarding mental ill-
 ness.
 At Cimmarron, the FHA chapter had
 a work day, in which chapter members
 worked with their younger sisters broad-
 ening their understanding of each other.
 At Glasco, the chapter invited a min-
 ister to speak on morals and manners.
 At Silver Lake, the FHA chapter
 staged a "dad and daughter" dinner for
 all the girls in the high school, which
 included a tour, dinner, and recreation
 afterward.
 These are but a few examples of the
 manner in which the FHA is helping
 young girls become stable young adults.
 Mr. President, at a time when we seem
 to be making so little progress In prob-
 lems of youth despite numerous large-
 scale Government programs, it is more
 than reassuring to see the Future Home-
 makers of America continue to nurture
 the ideals necessary for a young woman
 to become a benefit to society-rather
 PUBLIC OPINION AND THE W
 VIETNAM
 Mr. CHURCH.  Mr. President, in the
 light of the current state of national
 opinion relating to the war in Vietnam,
 I would like to bring to the attention of
 my colleagues in the Senate the results
 of a recent public opinion poll conducted
 by seven social scientists at Stanford
 University in cooperation with the Na-
 tional Opinion Research Center at the
 University of Chicago.  This national
 survey discloses that widespread public
 support exists for a more flexible Ameri-
 can bargaining position in Vietnam.
 I ask unanimous consent that this re-
 port be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the report
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 STANFORD  Widespread public support ex-
 ists for a more flexible American bargaining
 position in Vietnam, even among President
 Johnson's supporters, a new national sur-
 vey showed today.
 The privately financed, independent study
 was conducted by seven social scientists at
 Stanford in cooperation with the National
 Opinion Research Center at the University of
 Chicago.
 Based on 1,474 questionnaires administered
 in person from late February through early
 March, the survey revealed 88 percent of the
 adult  population  favors  negotiation  with
 the Vietcong if they are willing to negotiate;
 70 percent would support a U.N.-negotiated
 truce; 64 percent would favor holding free
 elections  in  South Vietnam,  even  if the
 Vietcong might win; and 52 percent would
 be willing to see the Vietcong participate in
 a coalition government in South Vietnam.
 Surprisingly, there is practically no differ-
 ence between those who endorse the Presi-
 dent's handling of the Vietnam situation
 and the general public on these positions,
 which have been advocated mainly by his
 congressional critics.   (The  corresponding
 percentages for the President's supporters on
 these four questions were 88, 71, 54, and
 51.)
 Contrary to press  speculation, the new
 study shovels those adults who are critical
 of  the  President on  Vietnam are mainly
 "doves," not "hawks."    These critics oppose
 a 500,000 troop commitment in Vietnam by
 a 2 to 1 margin and are against bombing
 North Vietnamese cities, 3 to 2.
 Like     previously  published  commercial
 polls, the independent survey shows 61 per
 5863
 cent of the public favors President Johnson's
 handling of Vietnam, while 29 percent are
 opposed and 10 percent have no opinion.
 However, more detailed questions disclose
 that the majority of Americans have reser-
 vations  about  continuing  the  war,  when
 faced with its possible costs, both in money
 and manpower.
 Thus, 4 out of 5 adults oppose cutting
 aid to education if necessary to continue
 the war.  Two-thirds oppose cutting medi-
 care.  And two-thirds oppose raising taxes.
 Majorities also oppose introducing economic
 controls or reducing the war on poverty for
 this purpose.
 So far as manpower is concerned, a major-
 ity (60 percent)  would be willing to con-
 tinue the war if it only required calling up
 the National Guard.  But more than half
 would  rather  end the war  than see  full
 mobilization   or accept several   hundred
 American casualties weekly.
 While Americans now are clearly opposed
 to major escalation of the conflict, they also
 oppose  other  extreme  alternatives. Thus
 4 out of 5 oppose unilateral American with-
 drawal followed by a Communist takeover,
 and a similar proportion do not want to see
 the United States abandon its commitment
 to other Asian countries.
 A majority (56 percent) said they would
 continue the war it, it meant fighting the
 Chinese in Vietnam.  But more than half
 would rather end?the war than bomb cities
 in North Vietnam (55 percent), fight a land
 war in China (60 percent)  or wage atomic
 war with China  (64 percent).  In general,
 the greater the escalation, the larger the
 majority favoring an end to the war.
 Reaction to one of the most likely steps-
 a 500,000 troop commitment-is evenly di-
 vided (46 percent oppose, 45 percent favor).
 The "doves" who favor negotiation with
 the Vietcong and  a  coalition government
 "are not open to the charge of being soft
 on communism," the authors noted.  "Over-
 whelmingly, these people maintain a firm
 anti-Communist  policy  elsewhere  in the
 world."  (More than 4 out of 5 in this group
 either favor present American policies to-
 ward Russia, China and Cuba or think our
 stand should be tougher.)
 "If the Vietnam 'dove' turns out to be a
 hybrid, so does the Vietnam 'hawk,'" the
 authors observed.  Among those who favor
 a 500,000 troop commitment, for example,
 85 percent also favor negotiations with the
 Vietcong,  53  percent  favor free elections,
 even though the Vietcong might win, and
 49 percent favor a coalition government.
 Only 6 percent of those interviewed took
 a consistent "hawk" position of more troops,
 bombing cities, and no free elections or coali-
 tions with the Vietcong.  This group sup-
 ported the President's handling of Vietnam
 by a 3-to-1 majority.
 At the opposite extreme, 14 percent of the
 public follows a consistent "dove" position
 on these  same four  Items.  More of this
 group opposed the President than approved
 his handling of Vietnam.
 In conclusion, the reasearchers said:
 "The American public is clearly concerned
 about Vietnam.  Sixty-one percent say that
 they are worried about Vietnam-more than
 worry about any other public issue.
 "But their opinions appear to be moderate
 and responsible. They do not want to pay
 the domestic costs of commitment in Viet-
 nam, but this is consistent with their desire
 for a negotiated settlement.
 "And though the settlement they prefer
 involves a willingness to deal with the Viet-
 cong that goes beyond present administra-
 tion policy, they reject those solutions that
 require irresponsible abandonment of  our
 commitments."

 AMERICA'S PARADISE ,~OST
 Mr. FONG.  Mr. President, on many
 occasions last year, in this Chamber and
 elsewhere, I sought to direct attention to
 the question of the future political status
 of the people of Micronesia-that vast,
 far-flung and largely forgotten area
 known as the Trust Territory of the Pa-
 cific Islands.
 As trustee of some 90,000 inhabitants
 of tiny islands scattered over a 3 million
 square mile ocean region, the United
 States is responsible for the administra-
 tion of this non-self-governing territory,
 by agreement with the United Nations
 Security Council.
 In order to stimulate a dialog and
 discussion on the question of Micro-
 nesia's future status, I have made nu-
 merous' remarks and referred to appro-
 priate literature about the trust ter-
 ritory.
 I now wish to call attention to a book
 just off the press, "America's Paradise
 Lost," authored by Willard Price, and
 published by John Day Co.  The book
 has been reviewed by a former Hono-
 lulu newsman, Robert Trumbull, who
 knows Micronesia intimately. Now the
 head of the New York Times Tokyo
 Bureau, Mr. Trumbull is the author of
 the book "Paradise in. Trust: A Report
 ,on Americans in Micronesia."
 Because Mr. Trumbull is a most
 knowledgeable observer of life in Micro-
 nesia, his review of Mr. Price's book
 should provide much food for thought
 on the subject.  He states that Mr.
 Price's critical survey of U.S. admini-
 stration of the trust territory is a "most
 damning indictment of American mis-
 rule in a paradisical part of the world."
 In order that all relevant points of
 view in the continuing discussion on
 Micronesia's future be made available,
 I ask unanimous consent to have printed
 in the RECORD Mr. Trumbull's review
 which appeared in the March 13, 1966
 issue of the New York Times book re-
 view.
 There being no objection, the review
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 A SHOCKING  ACCOUNT
 (By Robert Trumbull)
 "America's  Paradise Lost,''  by  Willard
 Price.  Illustrated, 240 pages, New York, the
 John Day Co., $6.95.
 Americans who bleed, by tradition, for sub-
 ject peoples under other flags should take a
 good look at our own desperate shortcomings
 in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
 Washington's contemptuous neglect of some
 90,000 brown-skinned. Micronesians ever since
 their welfare became an American respon-
 sibility more than 20 years ago should be a
 national scandal.
 The islands are scattered over the Western
 Pacific, 3,000 miles west of Hawaii, 1,000 miles
 south of Japan and 2,000 miles east of Viet-
 nam.  Most Americans heard of these islands
 for the  first time when our forces made
 bloody landings at such exotically named
 places as Kwajalein, Eniwetok, Peleliu, Sai-
 pan and Tinian; bombarded the Japanese
 bases at Truk, Yap, and Koror, and estab-
 lished our own enormous fleet anchorage in
 the vast blue Ulithi lagoon.  In earlier times,
 the islands had belonged to Spain by right of
 discovery.  When the Spaniards decided to
 pullout of the Pacific after losing the Philip-
 pines In the Spanish-American War, they sold
 the islands to Germany, Japan seized them
 at the outset of World War I, only to lose
 them to the United States in the next great
 war.  ("We would like," said an island chief,
 "to be ruled by a country that doesn't lose
 wars.")
 Willard Price's new book, aptly entitled
 "America's Paradise  Lost," puts the blame
 for a disgraceful situation on Congress and
 the U.S. Department of the Interior, the
 agency responsible.  His scathing work is the
 latest addition to a growing library of abra-
 sive reports on the American failure in Micro-
 nesia, some of them by successive inspection
 mission from the United Nations Trusteeship
 Council.  Mr. Price opens his shocking ac-
 count                                                                         of their  shameful plight with the
 anecdote about an anonymous Congressman
 who was asked, "What are you going to do
 about Micronesia?" Said the Congressman,
 "Mike who?"
 The author first visited Micronesia in 1935,
 when the 2,000-odd islands-"2,000 bits of
 heaven" of the Marshall, Carolina, and Mari-
 ana groups were run by Japan under a League
 of Nations mandate, the predecessor of the
 present U.N. trusteeship.  If his subsequent
 book, "Japan's Islands of Mystery" did not
 tell the U.S. Navy most of what it knew about
 these highly strategic   (and illegally forti-
 fled)  Japanese outposts, at least it was re-
 quired reading at Admiral Nimitz's Pacific
 Fleet Headquarters.
 The latest survey, in demonstrating that
 there has been scant improvement in Micro-
 nesian life over the ;years, and even a sharp
 deterioration in some aspects of government,
 is a most damning indictment of American
 misrule in a paradisical part of the world.
 A long list of paying industries developed
 by the Japanese-large-scale fishing, sugar
 growing, trochus shell work and pearl cul-
 ture, to name a few-have virtually disap-
 peared.  Jungle grows where the Japanese
 had thriving towns with paved streets, and a
 once-profitable territory has become a deficit
 area.  Where once the Japanese had paved
 highways, roads have been permitted to be-
 come all but impassable.
 In the "strikingly beautiful" islands of Yap,
 where stone disks up to 12 feet in diameter
 still serve as money and "women are ashamed
 not to show their breasts," bridges have been
 left broken and canals clogged.  One bitter
 chapter of the book is appropriately titled
 "The Rust Territory," in tribute to the di-
 lapidated tin towns that are the principal
 monuments to American rule.
 Lovely Palau, "a superb fling of islands,"
 has become a spectacle of "decay at every
 turn."  Says Mr. Price, "agriculture was in
 the doldrums.  Farmers complained of the
 lack of incentive. Government help was not
 what it had been under the farm-minded
 Japanese. *  *  ? Deep sea fishing *  *  * had
 sunk to the lowest ebb in 40 years."
 On many islands, Mr. Price found, educa-
 tion is almost entirely lacking.  Perhaps 2
 percent of Micronesia's adolescent population
 ever looks inside a high school, although
 there are a half dozen at district centers, and
 "college, except for a favored few, is 'out'"
 A teacher told Mr. Price that 15 Micronesians
 have now been graduated from American col-
 leges, which would be fine except that "if
 there were the same proportion (of college
 graduates to population) as in the United
 States, we would have 760."
 The construction of decent hospitals on
 two islands is listed as a gain; some other
 so-called hospitals, with broken screens let-
 ting in flies, are a disgrace.  Some easily
 treated endemic diseases, such as yaws, have
 been almost eradicated, but the rampant tu-
 berculosis is a different story.
 For a place so often called a paradise,
 Micronesia   has   produced   outstandingly
 macabre headlines since Americans took over.
 It was from Tinian, in the, Marianas, that
 the atomic bombs were delivered to Hiro-
 shima and Nagasaki.  Kwajalein and Eniwe-
 tok, after the residents were removed, became"
 the bases for grisly experiments with super-
 bombs.  Another atoll in the Marshalls, after
 a particularly horrendous demonstration of
 destructive power, gave its name to a bathing
 costume-the Bikini.
 The evacuation of numerous island dwell-
 ers so that their ancestral land could be
 blasted to irradiated powder was accom-
 plished with quiet efficiency, although the
 results have been unhappy from the natives'
 point of view.  Even less fortunate were the
 innocent  Marshallese  who  were  acciden-
 tally showered with the same radioactive
 dust that presumably killed the Japanese
 fisherman, Koboyama, of the hapless Lucky
 Dragon.   The survivors have remained medi-
 cal curiosities.  The atomic testing has been
 stopped by international agreement, but the
 azure waters are still a missile range.
 Naturally,  the  picture  is  not all  dark.
 Ham-handed and ill-advised as the American
 effort has been in so many aspects, there have
 been successes in the fields of public health
 and  local  self-government.    "We  like   to
 think we bring a magic touch to anything we
 undertake," says Mr. Price, but he felt com-
 pelled to conclude his survey with the re-
 mark that "When everything favorable that
 can be said has been said, the fact remains
 that the trust is progressing backward."
 Presumably, under the United Nations
 trusteeship agreement, we are preparing the
 islanders for eventual independence.  Speak-
 ing nine languages and scattered over 3 mil-
 lion square miles of sea, an area larger than
 that of the United States, the Micronesians
 themselves concede that their political fu-
 ture is a problem.  Some would like to join
 the United States, in spite of everything.
 From the beginning, the trust territory
 has been operated under a misconceived pro-
 gram with an absurd budget and an inade-
 quate staff.  As must be true of any such
 group, many of the Americans in charge are
 competent and dedicated men and women.
 For 10 years, says Mr. Price, Congress al-
 lotted the trust territory a paltry $8 million.
 The sum was doubled in 1962, but the author
 notes that meanwhile the cost of operations
 had also doubled, leaving the situation where
 it was in the beginning.  One of the conse-
 quences is that many islanders seldom or
 never see an American face, because of the
 shortage of transportation.
 It is far too late, Mr. Price was assured
 by native leaders, for the Micronesian to
 revert to the simple life of the grass shack
 and outrigger canoe. "Gone too," he related,
 "is the more recent paradise of plumbing,
 refrigeration, the hot rod and money in the
 pocket under the stimulus of the Japanese
 and the opulence of the American military.
 Now a disillusioned but remarkably patient
 people hang in a state of suspended anima-
 tion, unable to go back to the ancient sim-
 plicity, unequipped to go forward."
 Such is the "bitter truth," Mr. Price con-
 cludes, of the "forgotten sisters of the richest

 $600,000 this year to accelerate 2 natural
 trends in the 13 Mountain States-the aban-
 donment of marginal farming and the change
 in land use on remaining farms to grazing
 for cattle. In the 13 States, however, 70 per-
 cent of the potential pasture land is in need
 of conservation measures.
 The staying power of farmers who remain
 here is strong.  On the rocky slopes of Pen-
 dleton County, along the dark, deep-cut ra-
 vines that drop almost vertically from a tim-
 bered mountain skyline, the land has been
 inhospitable to economic agriculture for as
 long as anyone here can remember.
 More than a third of West Virginia's farm
 acreage has a slope of from 25 to 40 percent,
 or a grade of from 25 to 40 feet of elevation
 for each 100 feet of expanse.
 This county was settled 200 years ago and,
 starting with raids during the French and
 Indian War, it has had trouble.  Isolation
 between  the  Shenandoah  and    Allegheny
 Mountains, near the headquarters of the
 Potomac River, still makes the region diffi-
 cult to reach on winding roads. It has ham-
 pered farm market outlets.
 And now, Commissioner Douglass said, it
 Is even difficult for fathers here to sell prod-
 uce locally.  Buyers in Appalachia, as every-
 where else, prefer the packaged foods avail-
 able at supermarkets.
 Mr. Shrader's $1,091 in aid will pay 80
 percent of his costs in reclaiming, through
 aerial application of fertilizer, topdressing
 with lime and reseeding in orchard grass, 50
 acres of pasture and meadowland.  He will
 also get $150 to develop a spring, providing
 pipes and troughs to water his livestock.
 He already has two 5 percent loans from
 the Farmers Home Administration, totaling
 $5,900.
 An irony of the Appalachian farm recovery
 program, West Virginia officials said yes-
 terday, Is that it was watered down and re-
 named "land stabilization" when Congress-
 men from western and southern cattle dis-
 tricts objected that the original, more gener-
 ous "pasture improvement" plan might sub
 sidize beef competition for their ownkcpr
 stituents.                           II
 VIETNAM-ADDRESS BY VICE PRES-
 IDENT HUMPHREY TO COLUMBIA
 SCHOLASTIC PRESS ASSOCIATION
 Mr. JACKSON.  Mr. President, on
 March  12,  Vice  President  HUMPHREY
 made a statement on the Vietnam situa-
 tion to the Columbia Scholastic Press
 Association in New York City. His re-
 marks to these college students-deliv-
 ered over the telephone because he was
 not able to leave Washington, D.C., at
 that time-will be of interest to many of
 my colleagues.
 I should like unanimous consent that
 Vice President HUMPHREY's remarks be
 inserted in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 TELEPHONE REMARKS OF VICE PRESMENT HU-
 BERT HUMPHREY TO COLUMRIA SCHOLASTIC
 PRESS ASSOCIATION, NEw YORK CITY, MARCH
 I am sorry that I am not able to be with
 you in person today. The business of govern-
 ment keeps me in Washington.  But I am
 happy to at least have the chance to visit
 with you by telephone.
 I have spent much of my time in public
 life in the company of the press. But never
 have I been exposed to so many journalists at
 one time.
 If it were possible, I would prefer to con-
 vert this telephone message into a press con-
 ference, and respond to your questions.
 I know that they would be probing and
 pointed.  And I  know that most of them
 would focus on Vietnam.
 I would like to address myself briefly to
 some of the questions I am sure you would
 ask.
 I am sure you would begin by asking: Why
 are we in Vietnam?
 We are in South Vietnam to repel and
 prevent the success of aggression against the
 Government and the people of that country.
 We are there to help assure the South Viet-
 namese people the basic right to decide their
 own futures, freely and without intimida-
 tion.
 We are there to help those people achieve a
 better standard of living for themselves and
 their children.
 We are there to help establish the principle
 that-in this nuclear age-aggression cannot
 be an acceptable means either of settling in-
 ternational disputes or of realizing national
 objectives.  If aggression is permitted to go
 unchecked, we cannot in good faith hold out
 much hope for the future of small nations or
 of world peace.
 This is why we are in Vietnam.
 We are not there to build an empire ?   ?
 to exercise domination over that part of
 the world * * * to establish military bases.
 We are not thereto impose a government or
 way of life on other peoples.
 The Government of South Vietnam faces
 a massive task in building a democratic
 society while meeting determined force and
 terror.
 For many centuries, the Vietnamese peo-
 ple lived under Mandarin rule.  Then came
 two generations of colonial domination, fol-
 lowed by 25 years of almost constant war-
 fare. This is stony soil for democracy to grow
 in.
 Moreover, illiteracy has been high, corrup-
 tion all too common and public spirit all too,
 rare, and the number of well-trained edu-
 cated people all too small.
 The peasants of Vietnam-and, indeed, of
 all Asia-are rebelling against the kind of
 life they have led for ages past.  They want
 security.  But they also want dignity and
 self-respect, justice, and the hope of some-
 thing better in the future.
 The  Communists-in  their          drive  for
 power-seek to use and subvert the hopes
 of these people.  If they succeed, we could
 win many battles and yet lose the war.
 That Is why the Vietnamese Government,
 with our support, is pressing the "other war"
 with vigor-the war against poverty, hunger,
 disease, and ignorance.  This is the theme of
 the "Declaration of Honolulu"-and I be-
 lieve that the Honolulu Declaration could
 be a milestone in the history of our policy
 in Asia.
 The Government of South Vietnam is be-
 ginning in earnest the struggle to win and
 hold the allegiance of the people who live
 in rural South Vietnam, in more than 2,600
 villages and approximately 11,000 hamlets.
 Efforts are being made to give South Viet-
 nam firm social and economic footing-and
 a sound democratic political system as well.
 An Advisory Council for the Building of
 Democracy (including representatives of all
 the nationalist political tendencies) has been
 appointed.  It is drafting a constitution, an
 election  law,  and  regulations  concerning
 political parties and the press.  It will hold
 broad-scale  consultations  in    formulating
 these documents and regulations.
 Premier Ky has publicly committed him-
 self to steps leading to free elections before
 the end of next year.  As I left Saigon, a few
 days ago, Premier Ky told me: "We have
 begun 12 years late.   But it is not too late."
 Are these mere words, or will they be
 backed up by genuine commitment and par-
 ticipation by the people in translating them
 into deeds?
 I think the most encouraging answer to
 that question is being given by the students
 of South Vietnam. They are young men and
 women who, for the most part, come from
 the more comfortable and privileged groups
 in the country, based largely in the cities.
 Last summer some 5,000 young people
 voluntarily enrolled in the summer youth
 program.  They went out to all portions of
 the country which are not under Commu-
 nist control.  They rolled up their sleeves
 and set to work with purpose and dedication.
 They helped erect schools, dug wells, built
 homes for the refugees, and carried out many
 other useful projects.
 That program was scheduled for the 2
 months of the school vacation.  But it has
 been widely continued since.
 When I was in South Vietnam, I visited a
 demonstration project staffed by teenagers
 in the Eighth District of Saigon-a badly
 rundown slum, the worst in the city.  Under
 the leadership of the students, a group of
 refugees there had converted an abandoned
 and water-filled graveyard into an attractive,
 orderly neighborhood of new homes.    A com-
 munity center and a school were being built,
 and local officials hwd been elected.
 Some 30 Vietnamese teachers of English
 have launched what they call a "new school"
 movement:  They are seeking to stimulate
 a richer and more democratic extracurricular
 life for high school students.  They are help-
 ing them to develop student governmem,
 debating societies, sports  clubs,  and-this
 will  please you,  I'm  sure-student news-
 papers.
 A number of youth organizations-Catho-
 lie, Buddhist, and others-are undertaking
 work and training projects throughout South
 Vietnam.  Some are being assisted by the
 government, some are working with the fine
 group of men and women in Vietnam for
 the  International  Voluntary  Service,  and
 others are acting on their own initiative.
 Young people like these offer the best hope
 for the future of a free Vietnam.    Indeed,
 one of the tests of whether its government
 is making progress toward its goals in the
 social revolution will be the degree to which
 the government can attract and hold their
 allegiance and support,
 Let me add a few words directed to you
 young people listening today.
 We know much too little about Asia, and
 we need to know much more.
 I hope that many of you will take the
 opportunity in college to learn more about
 Asia.  For those of you who will continue
 as journalists, this knowledge will be es-
 sential.  It will be important also to those
 of you who elect other walks of life-per-
 haps in your work, certainly as responsible
 citizens.  Some of you may devote your
 careers to Asia-as diplomats, as business-
 men, or as scholars.
 We need to do our level best to stimulate
 wider American interest in Asia-including
 Communist China.  I am delighted that
 President Johnson has opened the way for
 our scholars to travel there.  The Chinese
 leaders speak harshly of us but, as President
 Johnson has said:
 "We can live with anger in words as long
 as it is matched by caution in deed."
 I am convinced that-despite the shrill
 anti-American propaganda which is carried
 on by the Chinese Communists-there is
 still much friendship there for us among the
 Chinese people from  our many  previous
 years  of  fruitful  and  constructive work
 together.
 We must be firm in resisting the expan-
 sionist designs of the present rulers of China.
 But we must take every opportunity to show
 our friendship for the Chinese people. We
 respect and value their learning, their skills,
 their arts, and their many contributions to
 civilization.
 With the other peoples of Asia, I anticipate
 steadily growing friendship and cooperation.
 They are already an important part of the

 foal energy, so that faster and more powerful
 rockets can make planetary trips in a week
 or less which today would require many
 months.
 6. The launching of unmanned probes to
 every part of the solar system-and perhaps
 manned planetary expeditions as well.
 We must not, however, become so totally
 fascinated by the wonders of outer space that
 we neglect the applications of space tech-
 nology to a better life right here on earth.
 A few days ago we orbited our first truly
 operational weather satellite-Essa II. I was
 pleased during my recent visit to the God-
 dard Space Flight Center to see the success-
 ful readout of the first weather pictures it
 sent back.  This is a satellite the entire world
 can tune in on--not only governments but,
 with a relatively small  nvestment, colleges
 or even individual citizens.
 The time is not distant when we will be
 able to predict, and predict with accuracy,
 the weather everywhere on earth.  We may
 even be able to control it-and thus open up
 many and portions of the world to cultiva-
 tion.
 Global communication by satellites will
 become a fact in the very near future.  It
 Will be followed by direct broadcast of both
 voice and TV to home receivers throughout
 large sections of the world.
 In the field of medicine alone, the benefits
 are already impressive.  Improvements   in
 medical  instrumentation,  resulting  from
 electronic  innovations  in the  space pro-
 gram, are already beginning to revolutionize
 the equipment of clinics and hospitals. It
 should be possible to monitor continuously
 and in detail the condition of hundreds of
 patients from a single location.
 Other direct benefits will come in the
 form of wideband transoceanic communica-
 tions, improved forest fire detection, and
 high-accuracy navigation.
 We have already made fantastic strides in
 devising-more effective, reliable, and compact
 electronic equipment with a wide variety of
 applications.  We have developed improved
 alloys, ceramics, and other materials.  And
 there have been other innovations, such as
 the accelerated use of liquid oxygen in steel-
 making, new coatings for the temperature
 control of buildings, and filters for deter-
 gents.
 Our progress in space has already con-
 tributed to our national security.  The use
 of communications satellites is backing up
 our effort in Vietnam.
 In addition to the support of our Armed
 Forces by better communications, our peace-
 ful application of space competence for na-
 tional security' takes many other forms.
 Among them are more accurate knowl-
 edge of the weather, more effective mapping,
 earlier warning of impending dangers, and
 the detection of nuclear explosions in space
 or in the atmosphere.
 .  There are some who claim, with all Sin-
 cerity, that the terrestrial relevance of space
 science and technology has been much ex-
 aggerated.  Concerning this, I would make
 two comments:
 One is to the skeptics outside this hall.
 I think they have forgotten the fact that
 this whole field is still only in its infancy.
 The best is yet to come.
 The other is to you.  As you constantly
 enlarge the horizons of space science and
 technology, I urge that you be everlastingly
 alert to recognize those discoveries and inno-
 vations which can usefully be applied here
 on our own planet.
 Moreover, it is not only technology that
 we have developed.  Perhaps even more im-
 portant, we have called into being rich
 human and intellectual resources-methods,
 capabilities, insights, and management tech-
 niques which can be brought to bear upon
 problems far removed from space.
 In this respect, I want to commend the
 initiative of private companies and of Gov-
 ernor Brown of California, who have shown
 the way toward focusing the talents of the
 aerospace industries on matters as impor-
 tant to our everyday living as traffic con-
 gestion and garbage control.
 I believe the technique of systems an-
 alysis-developed to its highest point so far
 in the aerospace industries--will be invalu-
 able to us as we face up to the problems of
 urban life, to the pollution of our waters
 and our atmosphere,  and to many other
 challenges of today and tomorrow.
 I believe those of you here who are in
 the  aerospace  industry  have  a  very real
 obligation to make your capabilities more
 widely known to State and local officials.
 Why you?  Because the  technical       and
 intellectual capabilities  you  possess  in
 abundance were made possible by the tax
 dollars  which  have  supported the   space
 program.
 Why             you? Because     your  management
 and your workers are citizens of many of
 the communities which will directly benefit
 from such efforts.
 Why you?  Because it will be a practical
 demonstration to the world how democracy
 and free enterprise function effectively for
 the common good.
 I shall conclude with a few observations
 on  the international  significance  of  the
 space effort.
 I believe it is virtually impossible to over-
 estimate the interest of peoples throughout
 the world in the unfolding space age.
 For  example,  a  USIA-sponsored    space
 exhibit last month in :Rangoon, Burma-a
 place most of us might :have imagined to be
 remote  from    the  space age-drew     over
 250,000 visitors.  Astronaut John Glenn was
 there, and Astronauts Walter Schirra and
 Frank Borman are currently winding up a
 successful  swing   around  the  free  Asian
 capitals, Australia, and New Zealand.
 Many countries with little or no space:
 experience are showing their interest in a
 very concrete and practical way.  They have
 realized the need to engage in space pro-
 grams to develop their own scientific compe-
 tence, and we are helping them to do so.
 Already we are cooperating with about 70
 countries, and the State Department and
 NASA are pressing forward with new Initia-
 tives in international cooperation.
 For what I now say I may be accused of
 being something of a visionary-but I am
 encouraged to do so by being in the good
 company of other visionaries.
 I believe that the exploration of space will
 have a profound effect upon how we look at
 our life here on earth.  It will put all our
 affairs  in  a  wider  and  more  wholesome
 perspective.
 Ever since Copernicus, we have known that
 our earth is a small planet in an immense
 universe. , But while we have known this
 intellectually and theoretically, most of us
 have not really taken it to heart, not really
 felt it in the marrow of our bones.
 As the full significance of that fact is
 brought home to us by the actual explora-
 tion of space, it will seem increasingly absurd
 that we have not better organized our life
 here on earth.
 Our experience in space can be a powerful
 stimulus to all of us, wherever we live, to
 move toward the establishment of a world
 of  law,  where  freedom  and  justice  are
 assured to all-and where, in the words of
 the Prophet Isaiah:
 "Nation shall not lift up sword against
 nation, neither shall they learn war any
 more."
 APPALACHIAN REGIONAL DEVELOP-
 MENT ACT IN OPERATION
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Pres-
 ident, the Appalachian Regional Devel-
 opment Act was highly publicized during
 the congressional debate on the enact-
 ment of the authorizing legislation and
 in determining the amounts of money to
 be allocated by the Federal Government
 to carry out the programs authorized.
 The New York Times on Sunday,
 March 13, carried a report on one small
 project which has been initiated under
 this act to benefit a West Virginia farmer.
 I ask unanimous consent that this
 article be printed in the RECORD at this
 point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 UNITED STATES  RISKS  $1,091.85  ON MAKING
 A WEST VIRGINIA FARMER A LITTLE LESS POOR
 (By Ben A. Franklin)
 FRANKLIN, W. VA., March 12.-Six miles on
 the twisting blacktop from this mountain
 hamlet of 760 persons and a mile and a half
 off the hard road, the Federal Government
 is reaching out to give W. Walton Shrader
 a chance to change four generations of hard-
 earned poverty on a nearly spent Appal-
 achian family farm.
 It seems both a modest and a risky out-
 reach.   It is a gamble that a poor rural
 family, living in what would seem frontier
 conditions if the land were not already over-
 grassed and leached of life, can be a little
 less poor by enriching the sloping pasture
 with Government fertilizer.
 It may mean an addition of four head
 to Mr. Shrader's herd of 17 Hereford beef
 cows and 100 sheep, which brought him a
 net income of $1,300 last year.
 In a ceremony here yesterday afternoon,
 made awkward by a gathering of country
 men unused, to their roles at such an oc-
 casion, Mr. Shrader received $1,091.85 under
 the Appalachian Regional Development Act
 of 1965 to improve 50 acres of his 304-acre
 farm, the maximum area allowed each appli-
 cant.
 According to Gus R. Douglass, the West
 Virginia Commissioner of Agriculture who
 came here from Charleston to officiate, the
 ceremonial writing of signatures, committing
 the Federal money, made the hefty, crew-cut
 Mr. Shrader the first farmer in the 13-State
 Appalachian region to receive such a re-
 covery grant.
 Few here, least of all Mr. Shrader, who
 looks older than his 31 years, expect to get
 rich.  But against the topographic and eco-
 nomic forces that have cut farm employ-
 ment in West Virginia in half since 1950,
 Mr. Shrader is staying.
 "My  great-great-granddaddy  built  the
 house," he said.
 He has neither a telephone nor an auto-
 mobile.                                                                                                                                  The Appalachian development con-
 tract he signed will give him income over
 the next 5 years, earmarked for specific land
 stabilization projects, that is not quite equal
 to the net total he cleared last year to sup-
 port his wife, his two children, his sister
 and a nearly blind uncle who shares owner-
 ship of the farm and lives with him.
 Even more than in other, richer agricul-
 tural regions, farming in Appalachia, Com-
 missioner Douglass said; must be "profes-
 sional," scratching out the best possible eco-
 nomic use of the poor land.

 world of my generation.  They are certain
 to be an even more significant part of yours.
 Finally, may I say this: The next few years
 of human history will be dangerous ones.
 But they will also be years of opportunity.
 For never has mankind ever possessed
 such power for good and for making the
 world safer and happier for hundreds of
 millions of people who have never had their
 share of anything but hunger, ignorance,
 and misery.
 Your generation will have a large part
 to play in determining whether man destroys
 himself or whether he moves forward into
 a new age of peace and understanding.
 The future is in your hands.  I hope you
 will make the most of it.
 MILWAUKEE SENTINAL COMMENTS
 ON SCHOOIr MILK CUTBACK
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, I
 would like to draw my colleagues' atten-
 tion to an excellent article commenting
 on the administration's plans to cripple
 the special milk program for schoolchil-
 dren.  This article appeared in one of
 the Nation's finest newspapers, the Mil-
 waukee Sentinal, under the byline of the
 paper's new Washington correspondent,
 James Wieghart.
 In my estimation this article sums up
 the issues at stake as well as any I have
 read since the school milk controversy
 got underway.  First the story points
 out that the issue is "a Federal program
 which this year will make available more
 than 3 billion half pints of milk for mil-
 lions of children in 94,000 schools, child
 care centers, settlement houses, summer
 camps and other nonprofit institutions
 that aid children."
 The article then goes on to say:
 Under the program the Federal Govern-
 ment pays 3 cents a half pint for school milk.
 The remaining 2 to 4 cents is paid locally.
 The milk program is not compulsory, but is
 made available to all children In participat-
 ing schools.
 As my colleagues so well know the pro-
 posed 80-percent cut means that the chil-
 dren would have to pay the 3 cents now
 provided by the Federal Government un-
 less they passed a means test or attended
 a school without a school lunch program.
 This does not sound like much money.
 But let us take a family with four chil-
 dren in school.  Each child probably has
 milk in midmorning and midafternoon
 under the school milk program.  This
 means 40 half pints a week.  Without
 Federal help the parents of those chil-
 dren would have to pay an additional
 $1.20 a week or as much as $42 more a
 year.  For a family with four children
 and moderate means this is a great bur-
 den.
 The Wieghart article then goes on to
 quote many members of the Wisconsin
 delegation.  For example he quotes Con-
 gressman RACE as agreeing with Presi-
 dent Johnson that lower priority domes-
 tic programs will have to be cut to fi-
 nance the war in Vietnam but saying
 that the school milk program should not
 be considered "lower priority."
 Representative STALBAUM is quoted as
 saying:
 I feel this program is perhaps the lowest
 price investment all of us could make to
 greatly improve the overall health of this
 country.
 I ask unanimous consent that this ex-
 cellent article be Inserted in the RECORD
 at this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 PROXMIRE GAINS AID AGAINST MILK CUTBACK
 (By James G. Wieghart)
 WASHINGTON,  D.C.-A  congressional  re-
 volt-less dramatic than the great debate
 on Vietnam policy-is being led by Senator
 PROXMIRE, Democrat, of Wisconsin, over the
 administration's proposed  cutback  of the
 highly successful school milk program.
 Unlike the revolt against Mr. Johnson's
 Vietnam policy, PROXMIRE's rebellion appears
 to be gaining enough Senate and House sup-
 port to be successful.
 At issue is the fate of a Federal program
 which this year will make availble more than
 3 billion half pints of milk for millions of
 children in 94,000 schools, child care centers,
 settlement houses, summer camps, and other
 nonprofit institutions that aid children.
 Under the program, the Federal Govern-
 ment pays 3 cents a half pint for school milk.
 The remaining 2 to 4 cents is paid locally.
 The milk program is not compulsory, but it
 is made available to all children in partici-
 pating schools.
 The administration announced last month
 that  the  Federal  Government  would  cut
 spending on the program this year from the
 $103 million appropriated by Congress, to
 $100  million.  For  fiscal  1967, beginning
 July  1,  the  administration  plans to cut
 spending on school milk from $103 million to
 $21 million.
 PROXMIRE has attacked the administra-
 tion's proposal as "phony economy" in a
 series of daily Senate speeches over the last
 several weeks.
 He also has introduced a bill to enlarge
 the school milk program and make it perma-
 nent.  Under the Proxmire bill, $110 million
 would be appropriated for the program in
 fiscal 1967, $115 million in 1968, and $120
 million in 1969 and succeeding years.
 Senator NELSON, Democrat, of Wisconsin,
 and 42 other Senators have cosponsored the
 Proxmire bill.  Identical bills have been in-
 troduced in the House by Representatives
 RACE and STALBAUM, both Wisconsin - Demo-
 crats. and five other House Members.
 "The     administration's proposed  cutback
 is a phony, fake, paper economy," PROXMIRE
 said Sunday.  "Federal funds not spent on
 school milk will be spent under price sup-
 port laws to buy and sell the same milk.
 "Less milk will be used under the pro-
 gram because local school districts will have
 to assume an increased share of the cost of
 the program or pass it on to the children.
 "This means that less milk will be con-
 sumed and more milk will have to be pur-
 chased by the Government under the dairy
 support program.  In other words, instead
 of going into the children's stomachs, the
 milk will be powdered and stored in ware-
 houses at Government expense," PROXMIRE
 said.
 NELSON said Congress "is unlikely" to allow
 the budget out to stand.  He said the re-
 duction would mean the end of the milk pro-
 gram which provides milk for 650,000 chil-
 dren, including those in Wisconsin schools.
 "If  this  milk  isn't  purchased  for  the
 schools, it goes into butter, cheese, and dry
 milk and ends up in surplus under the price
 support program," NELsoN said.   "Then the
 Government has to buy it anyway, at almost
 the same cost."
 RACE said he agreed with President John-
 son that "lower priority" domestic programs
 will have to be cut to finance the war in
 Vietnam, but he said the school milk pro-
 gram  should  not  be  considered  "lower
 priority."
 "The health and nutrition of our Nation's
 youngsters cannot be a matter of 'lower pri-
 ority' in the wide ranging concerns of our
 National Government," RACE said.
 STALBAUM, a member of the House Agricul-
 tural Committee, said that there is strong
 support for the bill to preserve the program
 among committee members.
 "I feel this program is perhaps the lowest
 price investment all of us could make to
 greatly improve the overall health of this
 country," STALBAUM said.
 Representative THoMsoN, Republican, of
 Wisconsin, who also supports the bill, said:
 "It is absurd for President Johnson to ask
 for billions of dollars for vast, worldwide
 programs for social progress, while he denies
 milk for the schoolchildren of America."
 Mr. Johnson, stung over the wave of criti-
 cism on the proposal, reportedly has directed
 his staff to prepare new legislation restoring
 some Federal support for the school milk and
 school lunch programs.
 The President reportedly told representa-
 tives of the National Milk Producers Federa-
 tion that his greatest volume of mail con-
 cerned the war in Vietnam and the cutback
 in the school program.
 The administration's new proposal, how-
 ever, reportedly will have a means test at-
 tached to it, limiting milk only to children
 of poverty stricken families.
 PROXMIRE has indicated he would oppose
 such a measure.
 "Nothing is more abhorrent in my mind
 than requiring first and second graders to
 give evidence that dad is too poor to pay for
 a half pint of milk, but this is exactly what
 a means test would require," PROXMIRE said.
 TRIBUTE TO FORMER SENATOR
 HARRY FLOOD BYRD
 Mr. FONG.  Mr. President, today I
 rise to pay tribute to one of the finest
 gentlemen and finest Senators it has
 been my privilege to know, former Sena-
 tor Harry Flood Byrd, who retired last
 November.
 Long before I came to the Senate in
 1959, I knew of Harry Flood Byrd; for
 over a period of many years he had been
 a symbol of fiscal soundness and finan-
 cial responsibility in government.  He
 earned this reputation as a successful
 farmer, as Governor of the Common-
 wealth of Virginia from 1926 to 1930, and
 as U.S. Senator since 1933.
 His unflinching dedication to sound
 finance, his steadfastness against the
 fluctuating popular fiscal and economic
 breezes, and his refusal to be intimidated
 though outnumbered earned him fitting
 and enviable praise as a man of "abso-
 lute integrity, absolute honesty, and ab-
 solute courage."
 We who served with Senator Byrd
 attest to the accuracy of this descrip-
 tion by the eminent writer, William S.
 White.
 Senator Byrd was never a faddist. He
 was a fundamentalist.  And although
 majority sentiment might differ from
 his views, he never harbored rancor nor
 bitterness.  He possessed the courage
 that is born of conviction.
 When Senator Byrd announced his
 retirement, there were comments that
 an era in American history had ended.
 Perhaps in a sense this is so.
 But the example that he set during
 his long public tenure will shine on and
 on for us and for generations of Amer-
 icans to come: unselfish devotion to

 duty, unwavering allegiance to public
 office as a public trust, and tireless safe-
 guarding of the people's money.
 A poor boy who worked hard and be-
 came a prosperous apple grower and a
 successful public leader, Senator Byrd
 has earned a high place in history's roll-
 call of American statesmen and patriots.
 The Commonwealth of Virginia can
 be very proud of one of its most illus-
 trious sons.  Virginia has lost a great
 champion in Congress and the U.S. Sen-
 ate has lost one of its most notable
 Members.
 I want to wish Senator Byrd good
 health and long life in his well-deserved
 retirement.  Aloha, my friend.
 WEST VIRGINIA'S SUMMERSVILLE
 DAM AND RESERVOIR
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.  Mr.
 President, the pace of activities attend-
 ant upon the development of the Sum-
 mersville Dam and Reservoir project in
 Nicholas County, W. Va., including the
 recreational complex and airport facili-
 ties, is accelerating.  On Wednesday,
 March 23, the tunnel releasing the water
 over the dam will be tested and bidding
 opened for contractors' services in seed-
 ing the 425 acres of uncovered earth left
 exposed following construction of the
 dam.
 Meanwhile, West Virginians are ea-
 gerly watching the progress of this
 multi-million-dollar project, which com-
 bines flood control,  increased water
 supply, pollution abatement, recreation,
 and fish propagation and is ultimately
 expected to attract thousands of tour-
 ists annually to West Virginia.
 The March 13 article by Mr. Harold C.
 Godd in the Sunday, Charleston, W. Va.,
 Gazette-Mail State magazine, entitled
 "The Water That Isn't Going Over the
 Dam," describes this eagerness.
 I ask unanimous consent that this
 newspaper article be printed in the REC-
 ORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE WATER THAT ISN'T GOING OVER THE DAw
 (By Harold C. Gadd)
 About the first week of February, Sum-
 mersville residents and motorists who had
 come from miles to see the new reservoir be-
 hind the Summersville Dam, gasped at the
 sight of the rapidly rising water level.
 Since work on the three, valve-controlled
 outlets was not completed-and would not be
 completed until  sometime in April-was
 there danger that the unusually heavy snows
 of January would soon have the. water pour-
 ing over the top of the dam? Wouldn't that
 be dangerous?
 No, said a spokesman from the Huntington
 District, U.S. Corps of Engineers, in answer
 to the first question.  Long before the water
 level could reach the top of the dam, the
 excess water would pour out over a spillway
 designed and built for just that purpose.
 After that was published, the sightseers
 started looking for the "spillway."  A lot of
 them couldn't find it.
 As one motorist, who had driven up from
 Charleston to see the dam and reservoir,
 said:
 "I looked all over and I couldn't find any
 spillway.  But I'll tell them this: if that
 water comes up two more feet it is going to
 be over the highway."
 Actually, the stretch of highway to which  lunches.  The total average Cost of 50
 he was referring is the beginning of the spill- cents per meal has been divided among
 way.  It is a half-mile--or less-from the  the Federal Government, the individual
 dam itself and YOU have to drive over it If
 and the States and localities.
 you go to see the dam from the direction
 Kessler's Cross Lanes.
 On Thursday, March 3, the Gazette pub-
 lished a photo of water pouring over the
 spillway, but the caption writer-thinking,
 perhaps, that everyone was as familiar with
 the subject as he was--wrote:
 "Over the top of Surnmersville Dam go
 millions of gallons of Gauley River water"
 The caption writer was wrong.  The Army
 engineers were right.  The water was going
 over the spillway, not the dam.
 Actually, once the outlets in the dam it-
 self are completed? the spillway will prob-
 ably never be needed as such again-despite
 a Summersville wag who was heard to re-
 mark :
 "Them engineers just think that water will
 never go over the spillway again.  They don't
 know the Old Gauley River."
 Maybe they don't, but we know the Old
 Corps of Engineers and if those outlets aren't
 big enough to handle the old Gauley River
 once they are put in operation, we're going
 to be mighty surprised.
 But, if they don't, it won't hurt anything
 for the spillway to be a spillway any time it
 is needed.
 SCHOOL LUNCH AND SPECIAL MILK
 PROGRAMS
 Mr..SIMPSON..  Mr. President, I am
 shocked by the ]President's proposal to
 seriously curtail the school lunch and
 special school milk programs that have
 benefited America's children to such a
 great extent.
 It does not seem right that the admin-
 istration which proposes so much welfare
 legislation would reduce drastically or
 perhaps even cripple such beneficial pro-
 grams as these to provide milk and school
 lunches for our schoolchildren. Recent-
 ly the administration suggested a food-
 for-freedom program to feed the hun-
 gry of the world. While the idea's objec-
 tive is laudable, I think that first we
 ought to be concerned with meeting the
 nutritional requirements of our own
 children.
 For this reason, I have sponsored S.
 2888, which would provide that milk and
 dairy products controlled by the Com-
 modity Credit Corporation be used in
 nonprofit school lunch programs without
 regard to priorities set up In other laws.
 I have also sponsored S. 2921, which
 would establish a permanent school
 milk program.
 This latter bill directs the Secretary of
 Agriculture to encourage the consump-
 tion of milk by U.S. children in schools
 and other nonprofit Institutions. In ad-
 dition, it furnishes guidelines for expan-
 sion of the program. beginning with the
 1967 fiscal year, and authorizes the ex-
 penditure of the necessary funds for the
 program. Another feature would require
 the Department of Agriculture to reallo .
 sate funds which the Secretary deter-
 mines will not be fully utilized by the
 State  to  which  they  were  initially
 allotted.
 Since 1936, the school lunch program
 has enabled millions of children to ob-
 tain hot, well-balanced meals they might
 not have enjoyed otherwise.   In 1965,
 some 18 million children in 71,000 public
 and nonprofit private schools received
 heartedly approves the school lunch pro-
 gram.  This past fiscal year, an esti-
 mated 31,906 of our children and 273 of
 our schools participated.
 From the beginning, the program has
 been managed at the local level.  The
 decision to participate, the responsibility
 for facilities, and the conduct of the
 program as set out by Federal guidelines
 are under local authority. Federal con-
 tributions are twofold: cash and food-
 either procured specifically for the pro-
 gram or through surpluses from the De-
 partment of Agriculture's price support
 or surplus removal programs.
 The special school milk program was
 instituted in 1954 as a means of diverting
 surplus milk production from the ever-
 growing dairy products stockpile of the
 Commodity Credit Corporation, for the
 use of children.  Originally limited to
 schools, the program was extended in
 1956 to cover nonprofit camps, homes,
 and other children's institutions.
 Under the program, each child pays
 3 to 4 cents on the average for a half
 pint of milk costing a total of.6 to 8 cents.
 Wyoming had 314 schools taking part in
 the milk program this past fiscal year.
 Both the school lunch and the special
 milk programs have been far more suc-
 cessful than anticipated. Not only have
 the health and well-being of our children
 been ,improved, but also a good market
 for our farmers, good Industries, and
 local businesses has been developed.
 Vast amounts of surplus foods acquired
 by the Federal Government in price-
 support efforts have been utilized.
 Despite the overwhelming benefits of
 the school lunch and special milk pro-
 grams, the President now asks that they
 be reduced by $19 million-12 percent-
 and $82 million-82 percent-respec-
 tively, although school population con-
 tinues to expand.
 If the demonstrated advantages of
 these programs are to be maintained,
 there must be affirmative legislative ac-
 tion.  Otherwise, our children, farmers
 and businessmen, including those in
 Wyoming, will suffer. I urge immediate
 consideration and approval of S. 2888,
 permitting the needs of the school lunch
 program to be met from CCC stocks,
 and S. 2921, establishing a permanent
 school milk prorgam. In support of my
 recommendation, I quote from the Sen-
 ate Report No. 1218,'on the Economic
 Opportunity Act of 1964:
 No better investment can be made than to
 increase funds so that wholesome lunches
 and %milk will be available to all children
 VIETNAM IN PERSPECTIVE

 American people are today like the man
 who is asked to pick up a book and begin

 on others to tell them what transpired in

 The book to which I refer is, of course,
 about Vietnam, and a man well qualified
 to explain what has gone before is John
 J. Fairbank, director of the East Asian
 Research Center at Harvard and author
 of numerous books and articles about
 U.S. relations with China.
 As I have said on several occasions, it
 is immensely important for us to under-

 southeast Asia, for, as Dr. Fairbank
 observes:
 Cultural differences lay the powder train
 for international, conflict.
 From his understanding of historical
 and cultural forces, Dr. Fairbank is
 qualified to discuss our present predica-

 should deal with China in the future.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-

 ton Post, as excerpted from the New
 York Review of Books, be printed in the

 UNITED STATES FIGHTING AN IDEA
 IN VIETNAM
 (By John J. Fairbank)
 (NOrs. Fairbank is director of the East
 Asian Research Center at Harvard and author
 of "The United States and  China" and
 "Chinese Thought and InstltiAions."  His
 article is excerpted with permission from the
 New York Review of Books, 1966, the New
 York Review.)
 The Vietnam debate reflects our intellec-
 tual unpreparedness.  Crisis has arisen on
 the furthest frontier of public knowledge,
 and viewpoints diverge widely because we all
 lack background information.
 "Vietnam" was not even a label on our
 hoIizon 20 years ago. It' was still "Annarall
 (the old Chinese term), burled within the
 French creation "Indochina."
 Our ignorance widens the spectrum of de-
 bate: Everyone seeks peace but some would
 get it by fighting more broadly, some by not
 fighting at all and some by continuing a
 strictly limited war.  Everyone wants nego-
 tiations. But to get them, some would bomb
 North Vietnam and others would pause or
 stop.
 Behind the cacophony of argument, some
 hold the Europocentric view that Vietnam
 is far away and in the Chinese realm, not in
 our realm.  Others argue for a more. global
 view that the balance of power and inter-
 national order can be preserved only by con-
 taining the Chinese revolution as we are
 already doing in Korea and the Taiwan
 Straits.
 Yet here the problem arises that it is not
 the Chinese whom we face in'South Vietnam,
 but rather their model of revolution, Chair-
 .man Mao's idea.  And how does one stop
 a revolutionary Idea?
 HISTORICAL GRAB BAG
 How to deal with the Chinese revolution
 depends on how we understand it- specifl-
 cally, what is the Chinese revolutionary in-
 fluence in Vietnam?  And behind that, what
 is the nature of the Chinese revolution itself?
 Can we ultimately deal with it in any way
 short of was?  But where would war get us?
 A long view is needed, a historical frame-
 work within which to see all the actors, in-
 cluding ourselves.   (What are we doing so
 far from home?)  Yet our knowledge of east
 Asian history is so meager it can mislead us.
 History is used as a grab bag from which
 each advocate pulls out a lesson to prove his
 point.
 Some recall Manchuria in 1931: We failed-
 to stop Japan's aggression and it led on to
 Pearl Harbor.  Others recall our drive to the
 Yalu in 1950: We Ignored China's vital inter-
 est in her frontier and got ourselves into a
 bigger war.  Again, what was the lesson of
 Dienblenphu    in  1954-were  the  French
 strategically overextended or merely tactically
 deficient in airpower?
 History never repeats itself, means that
 one can never find a perfect 1 to 1 corre-
 spondence  between  two  situations.                                                                    Each
 must be viewed within the long  flow   of
 events, not  as an isolated  lesson. Brief
 articles (like this one) can offer only limited
 wisdom. .
 Nevertheless, certain main outlines emerge
 from a historical survey.  The Vietnamese
 and Chinese have had their own specific
 ways and interests, traditions and attitudes,
 and their own east Asian pattern of con-
 tact, not in the Western style.
 ANCIENT COMMON BOND
 China's revolutionary influence on Vietnam
 comes from a long past.  In the first place,
 Vietnam grew up as part of Chinese culture-
 the east Asian realm which included not
 only China in the center but also the pe-
 ripheral states of Korea and Vietnam and
 Japan as well.
 All these countries took over the Chinese
 writing system in ancient times and with it
 the Chinese classical teachings, the bureau-
 cratic system of government, and the family
 based social order so eloquently advocated
 in the Confucian classics.  These countries
 have an ancient common bond in philosophy,
 government, and cultural values.
 In Vietnam's case, this Chinese heritage
 was imposed by a thousand years of Chinese
 rule in North Vietnam, the ancient home-
 land of the Vietnamese before they expanded
 southward into the Mekong Delta.  Inde-
 pendence from Chinese rule was gained by
 fighting in the 10th century A.D., but Viet-
 nam then continued for another thousand
 years to be independent only within the
 Chinese realm and tribute system.
 Down to the 1880's, Vietnamese tribute
 missions, going over the long post route to
 Peiping, acknowledged the superior size and
 power, the superior culture and wisdom of
 the Chinese Empire and its rulers.   This
 filial or younger brother relationship was
 broken  only  a  few  times  when Chinese
 armies again invaded Hanoi (for example, in
 1406 and 1789) only to be thrown out by the
 Vietnamese resistance, whereupon tributary
 relations were resumed.
 There were only these alternatives: to be
 ruled by China or to be tributary, in the Chi-
 nese  cultural-political-psychological  sense,
 taking China as a model.  This went to the
 point of using the same structure of govern-
 ment and copying the Chinese law codes ver-
 batim, with the same terminology, in Chinese
 characters, which were the official writing
 system.
 Vietnam's growth in the shadow of China
 was eventually balanced by the arrival of sea
 invaders from the West.  The early Portu-
 guese adventurers and the later Dutch and
 British East India companies landed their
 ships at Danang (Tourane), where our Ma-
 rines are today.  This sea contact with the
 expanding West climaxed in the French take-
 over of the  1860's and seventies.  French
 colonialism during its 80 years brought both
 exploitation and modernization in a mixture
 that is hotly debated and can hardly be un-
 scrambled.
 We Americans have thus had predecessors
 (even the Japanese in 1940-45) on the long
 thin coast of Vietnam.  We are sleeping in
 the same bed the French slept , in, even
 though we,dream very different dreams.
 5859
 VIETNAM IN MIDDLE
 Western seapower in southeast Asia goes
 back 450 years.  Europeans expanded west-
 ward into the empty Americas very slowly.
 They went east into populous Asia more
 quickly and easily.  The resulting colonial-
 ism in southeast Asia has now been super-
 seded by the new relationships we are trying
 to work out in the name of national self-
 determination.
 We are on an old cultural. frontier between
 the international trading world and Asia's
 land-based  empires.  Vietnam,  like  Korea,
 has been caught in the middle and pulled
 in two.
 Vietnamese patriots reacted against the
 French by learning modern nationalism from
 them.  In so doing, they continued to be
 influenced by the Chinese example to the
 north. The Chinese reformers of 1898 had
 their counterparts in Hanoi.  Sun Yat-sen
 operated from there in 1907-08.  When his
 Chinese Kuomintang reorganized itself on
 Soviet lines in the 1920's, a Vietnamese Kuo-
 mintang followed suit.
 In the same era, the Chinese Communist
 Party set a model for the growth of a Viet-
 namese Communist movement in the 1930's.
 The rise of Ho Chi-minh illustrates this
 trend.  Both the French and Soviet Com-
 munist movements and Chiang Kai-shek's
 Whampoa Military Academy were in his
 background.
 By the time the Chinese Communists came
 to power in 1949, they were in an even better
 position to  give the  Vietnamese  the  en-
 couragement                                                                                                                                         of  example.   Vietminh  pa-
 triots of the united front were trained to .
 fight against the French in the sanctuary
 of South China.    When the People's Repub-
 lic of North Vietnam eventually emerged in
 1954 after the defeat of France, it was in-
 debted to Chinese help but, most of all, to
 the Chinese Communist example.
 Today in South Vietnam, the "people's war
 of liberation" has developed from the Maoist
 model that took shape in China during the
 struggle against the Nationalists and the
 Japanese.  Mao's formula is to take power
 through a centralized Leninist party that
 claims to represent the people.
 This begins with establishing a territorial
 base or "liberated area," inaccessible and de-
 fensible.                                                                                                                                     From this base, the party orga-
 nizers can recruit idealists and patriots in
 the villages and create an indoctrinated
 secret organization.  Once under way, this
 organization can begin to use sabotage and
 terrorism to destroy the government's posi-
 tion in the villages and mobilize the popula-
 tion for guerrilla warfare.
 Shooting down unpopular landlords  or
 government administrators has a wide "dem-
 onstration effect."  When guerrilla warfare
 has reached a certain level, it can escalate
 to fielding regular armies, strangling the
 cities.and completing the takeover.
 One appeal of this Maoist model is its do-
 it-yourself  quality.  The  organizing  pro-
 cedure is carried out by local people with
 only a minimum influx of trained returnees
 and esential arms. The whole technique
 cannot be understood apart from the local
 revolutionary ardor that inspires the move-
 ment.
 PRINCIPLE OF STRUGGLE
 In China today, we confront a revolution
 still at full tide, an effort to remake the
 society by remaking its people., Chairman
 Mao spreads a mystique that man can over-
 come any obstacle, that the human spirit
 can triumph over material situations.
 For 15 years with unremitting intensity,
 the  people  have  been  exhorted  to  have
 faith in the Chinese Communist Party' and
 the Ideas of Mao Tse-tung.   With this has
 gone a doctrinaire righteousness that has
 beaten down all dissent and claimed with
 utmost self-confidence to know the "laws
 of history."

 CONGRESSIONAL, RECORD -SENATE          March 17, 1966
 Mao's revolution puts great stress on the
 principal of struggle.  The class struggle
 has made history.  Each individual must
 struggle against his own bourgeois nature.
 China must struggle against Khrushchevian
 revisionism.  The whole world must strug-
 gle against imperialism led by the United
 States.
 Out of all this struggle among the 700
 million Chinese has come a totalitarian
 state manipulated largely by suasion.  In-
 dividuals work upon themselves in the proc-
 ess of thought reform, criticizing their own
 attitudes.  Residential groups maintain sur-
 veillance on one another, as children do on
 their parents, as part of their national duty.
 Terror is kept in the background.  Con-
 formity through a manipulated "voluntar-
 ism" fills the foreground.  No such enor-
 mous mass of people has  ever been so
 organized.  The spirit of the organization
 continues to be highly militant.
 The  sources  of  China's revolutionary
 militancy  are   plain enough in  Chinese
 history.   The Chinese Communist regime
 is only the latest phase in a process of de-
 cline and fall followed by rebirth and re-
 assertion of national power.
 China's humiliation under the "unequal
 treaties" of the 19th century lasted for 100
 years.  An empire  that  had traditionally
 been superior to all others in its world was
 not only humbled but threatened with ex-
 tinction.  Inevitably, China's great tradi-
 tion of unity, as the world's greatest state
 in size and continuity, was reasserted.
 In  this  revival,  many  elements  from
 the past have been given new life:     the
 tradition of leadership by an elite who are
 guardians of a true teaching, the idea of
 China as a model for others to emulate.
 Because the Chinese Empire had kept Its
 foreign relations in the guise of tribute
 down to the late 19th century, China has
 had little experience in dealing with equal
 allies or with a concert of equal powers and
 plural sovereignties.  Chairman Mao could
 look up to Comrade Stalin.   He could only
 look  down on  Comrade Khrushchev.  An
 equal relationship has little precedent in
 Chinese experience.
 EARLY SOPHISTICATION
 Because China has been a separate and
 distinctive area of civilization, Isolated in
 east Asia, the Chinese people today have a
 very different political heritage from the rest
 of the world.  The most remarkable thing
 about China's political history is the early
 maturity of the sociopolitical order.
 The ancient Chinese Government became
 more sophisticated, at an earlier date, than
 any regime in the West.   Principles  and
 methods worked out before the time of
 Christ held the Chinese empire together
 down to the 20th century. The fact that
 this imperial system eventually grew out of
 date in comparison with the modern West
 should not obscure its earlier maturity.
 As in her scientific discoveries and tech-
 nology, China's inventions  in government
 put her well ahead of Europe by the time
 Marco Polo saw the Chinese scene in the
 13th century.  Perhaps this early Chinese
 advancement Dame from the continuity of
 the Chinese effort at government, carried on
 In the same area century after century and
 dealing with the same problems until they
 were mastered.
 In contrast, Western civilization grew up
 with a broader base geographically and cul-
 turally, but this very diversity of origins and
 the geographical shift from the Mediter-
 ranean to Western Europe may have delayed
 the maturing of Western institutions.
 Thus the ancient Chinese had a chance to
 concentrate on the problem of social order,
 staying in the same place and working it out
 over the centuries.   Their solution began
 with the observation that the order of nature
 is not egalitarian but hierarchic.
 Adults are stronger than children, hus-
 bands than wives.  Age is wiser than youth.
 Men are not equally endowed: "Some labor
 with their minds and govern others; some
 labor with their muscles and are governed
 by others."  This commonsense, antiegali-
 tartan approach tried to fit everyone in his
 place in a graded pyramid of social roles.
 At the top of everything was the Chinese
 ruler, whose virtuous example commanded
 the respect and obedience of all beholders.
 The Chinese monarchy institutionalized the
 idea of universal kingship atop the human
 pyramid.  The emperor functioned as mili-
 tary leader, power holder, and ethical pre-
 ceptor at the apex of every social activity.
 An able emperor would recruit the best
 talent, use men in the right jobs, render the
 legal decisions and even set the style of con-
 noisseurship in art while carrying out the
 sacrifices to heaven and superintending all
 aspects of official conduct.  The monarchy
 became omnicompetent, not equaled by any
 other human institution.
 Even before the Chinese unification of 221
 B.C., ancient administrators had worked out
 the basic principles of bureaucratic govern-
 ment.  They selected for their ability a pro-
 fessional group of paid officials who were
 given overall responsibility in fixed areas,
 instructed and supervised through official
 correspondence and rotated in office.  The
 Chinese Empire thus very early embodied the
 essentials of bureaucracy which the Euro-
 peans arrived at only in modern times.
 One of the great inventions of Chinese
 Government  was  the  examination   system
 based on the Confucian classics.  It produced
 an indoctrinated elite who could either pro-
 vide local leadership as holders of imperial
 degrees or else could be appointed to official
 posts and carry on administration anywhere
 at a distance from the capital. In either case,
 the  products  of the  examination system,
 versed in the classical principles of govern-
 ment, were supporters of orthodoxy and au-
 thority on established lines.
 Other innovations, like the censors who
 functioned as a separate supervisory echelon,
 added to the devices of Chinese "statecraft."
 Chinese Government also used the family
 system, confirming the special status of par-
 ents and elders over the young and of men
 over women.
 ANOTHER INVENTION
 As the Chinese sociopolitical order matured
 and grew, its influence radiated outward over
 the "Chinese culture area."  Because China
 was the center of civilization in east Asia, it
 served as the model for smaller states like
 Korea and Vietnam, whose rulers naturally
 became subordinate to the Chinese Emperor.
 The hierarchic relationship was expressed in
 the tribute system already noted.
 But the rise of nomadic warriors like the
 Mongols on the grasslands of inner Asia posed
 a new problem, for they were non-Chinese in
 culture and yet their military capacity en-
 abled them to invade north China and even-
 tually conquer the whole empire.  The result
 was another Chinese political invention un-
 der which it became possible for powerful
 non-Chinese peoples to participate in Chi-
 nese political life.
 This they did either as allies and subordi-
 nates of strong Chinese rulers or, in case of
 Chinese  weakness,  as  the  actual  rulers
 of China itself.  Thus the ancient Chinese
 empire again showed its political sophistica-
 tion.  Invaders who could not be defeated
 were admitted to the power structure.   The
 Mongols in the 13th to 19th centuries could
 even seize the imperial power, but they had
 no alternative to ruling China in the old
 Chinese fashion.
 When Westerners arrived on China's bor-
 ders in early modern times, they also began
 to participate in the Chinese power structure.
 They were generally given status as tribu-
 taries and until 1840 were kept under control
 on the frontier.
 Thereafter, under the so-called unequal
 treaty system, the Westerners had to be
 allowed to participate in the Government of
 China. This they did with special privileges
 in treaty ports protected by their gunboats
 and under their own consuls' extraterritorial
 jurisdiction.  In its beginning, this 19th cen-
 tury treaty system followed Chinese tradition.
 PICKED AND CHOSE
 Eventually,  of  course,  Western  contact
 brought in new ideas which undermined the
 old-Chinese order, but not all the new ideas
 of    modern   times  were  wholly accepted.
 Christianity found only a limited following.
 Ideas of the sacred rights of the individual
 and the supremacy of law were not taken
 over.  China picked and chose what it wanted
 to accept from the West.
 Scientific technology and nationalism were
 in time taken as foundations of economic
 and political change.  But Western-style re-
 publicanism and the election process did not
 take hold.  As a political device to take the
 place of dynastic rule, the Chinese eventually
 accepted  Leninist  party  dictatorship.  On
 this basis, the Kuomintang rose to power in
 the 1920's.
 Later, the Communist success established
 the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism and tech-
 niques of Soviet totalitarianism and indus-
 trialization.  The Sino-Soviet split now rep-
 resents  a  triumph  for  hypernationalism
 geared to a revolutionary faith.
 Even a brief sketch of the historical ex-
 periences of the  Chinese people indicates
 their  cultural differences from  the  West.
 Some of these inherited differences have been
 selected and reinforced by the new totali-
 tarian rulers.
 Chinese tradition is, of course, very broad.
 It affords examples of a Confucian type of
 individualism and defiance of state 'control.
 Some day these examples may be invoked
 for democratic purposes, but that time has
 not yet come.
 Today we see these cultural differences
 affecting the status of the Chinese Individual.
 The old idea of hierarchic order persists.
 "Enemies" of the new order, as defined by
 it, are classed as not belonging to "the peo-
 ple" and so are of lowest status.  On the
 other hand, party members form a new elite,
 and one man is still at the top of the pyra-
 mid.. The tradition of government suprem-
 acy and domination by the official class still
 keeps ordinary people in their place.
 The law, for example, is still an adminis-
 trative tool used in the interest of the state;
 It does not protect the individual.  This re-
 flects the commonsense argument that the
 interest of the whole outweighs that of any
 part or person, and so the individual still has
 no established doctrine of rights to fall back
 upon.
 As in the old days, the letter of the law
 remains uncertain and its application arbi-
 trary.  The defense of the accused is not
 assured, the judiciary is not independent,
 confession  is  expected  and  litigation  is
 frowned upon as a way of resolving conflicts.
 Compared with American society, the law
 plays a very minor role.
 The difference between Chinese and Ameri-
 can values and institutions stand out most
 sharply in the standards for personal con-
 duct. The term for individualism in Chinese
 (ko-jen-chu-i) is a modern phrase invented
 for a foreign idea, using characters that sug-
 gest each-for-himself, a chaotic selfishness
 rather than a high ideal.  Individualism is
 thus held in as little esteem as It was under
 the Confucian order.
 The difference is that where young people
 were formerly dominated by their families,
 who for example arranged their marriages,
 now they have largely given up a primary
 loyalty to family and substituted a loyalty

 to the Party or "the people."  In both cases,
 the highest ideal is sacrifice for the collective
 good.
 Similarly, the modern term for freedom
 (tzu-yu) is a modern combination of char-
 acters suggesting a spontaneous or willful
 lack of discipline, very close to license and
 quite contrary to the Chinese ideal of disci-
 plined cooperation.
 The cultural gap is shown also by the Chi-
 nese attitude toward philanthropy.  Giving
 things to others is of course highly valued
 where specific relations call for it, as when
 the individual contributes to the collective
 welfare of family, clan or community. But
 the Christian virtue of philanthropy in the
 abstract, giving to others as a general duty,
 quite impersonally, runs into a different
 complex of ideas.
 Between individuals, there should be reci-
 procity In a balanced relationship.  To re-
 ceive without giving.in return puts one at
 a serious disadvantage: one is unable to hold
 up one's side of the relatioship and there
 fore loses self-respect.
 American philanthropy thus hurts Chinese
 pride.. It has strings of conscience attached
 to it,  The Communist spurning of foreign
 aid and touting of self-sufficiency fits the
 traditional sense of values.  American aid
 does not.
 CRITICS ARE  ENEMIES
 Cultural differences emerge equally in the
 area of politics.  In the Chinese tradition,
 government is by persons who command obe-
 dience by the example they set of right con-
 duct.  When in power, an emperor or a rul-
 ing party has a monopoly of leadership which
 is justified by its performance, particularly
 by the wisdom of its policies.  No abstract
 distinction is made between the person in
 power and his policies.
 Dissent which attacks policies Is felt to be
 an attack on the policymaker.   On this
 basis, no "loyal opposition" is possible.  The
 Western concept of disputing a powerhold-
 er's policies while remaining loyal to his in-
 stitutional status is not intelligible to the
 Chinese. Critics are seen as enemies, for they
 discredit those in power and tear down the
 prestige by which their power is partially
 maintained.   (This idea also crops up in
 Taiwan.)
 Another difference emerges over the idea
 of self-determination.  This commonplace of
 Western political thinking sanctions the de-
 mand of a definable group in a certain area,
 providing they can work it out, to achieve an
 independent state by common consent among
 themselves.  This idea runs quite counter to
 the traditional idea of the Chinese realm that
 embraces  all  who  are  culturally  Chinese
 within a single entity.
 Thus the rival Chinese regimes today are
 as one in regarding Taiwan as part of the
 mainland. Both want to control both areas.
 Similarly, they are agreed that. Tibet is part
 of the Chinese realm without regard for self-
 determination.   A  supervised  plebiscite
 would seem so humiliating that no Chinese
 regime would permit it.
 Both the Chinese party dictatorships of
 modern times are also believers in elitism and
 opponents of the election process, except as
 a minor device for confirming local popular
 acquiescence in the regime.
 Elections on the mainland are manipulated
 by the party.  Taiwan has developed a gen-
 uine election process at the local level, but
 the old idea of party "tutelage" is far from
 dead at the top. Here again, a case can be
 made for the Chinese practice.  Our point
 is merely its difference from that of the
 West.
 AN ANCIENT DEVICE
 Perhaps the most strikingly different politi-
 cal device is that of mutual responsibility,
 the arrangement whereby a designated group
 is held responsible in all its members for
 the conduct of each. This Idea goes far back
 in Chinese history as a device for controlling
 populous villages.
 At first, 5-household groups, and later,
 10-household groups, were designated by the
 officials, 10 such lower groups forming a unit
 at a higher level with the process repeated
 until 1,000 households formed a single group.
 In operation this system means that one
 member of a household is held accountable
 for the acts of all other members, one house-
 hold for the acts of its neighbors and so on
 up the line.
 This motivates mutual surveillance and
 reciprocal control, with neighbor spying on
 neighbor and children informing on parents.
 Communist China uses this ancient device
 today In its street committees and other
 groups.     It directly denies the Western idea
 of judging a man by his intentions and
 condemning him only for his own acts.
 Cultural differences lay the powder train
 for international conflict.  China and Amer-
 ica can see each other as "backward" and
 "evil," deserving destruction.   We need to
 objectify such differences, see our own values
 in perspective and understand If not accept
 the values of others.
 Understanding an opponent's values also
 helps us deal with him.  The old Chinese
 saying is, "If you know yourself and know
 your enemy, in a hundred battles you will win
 a hundred times."
 All this applies to our present dilemma in
 Vietnam, where our military helicopter tech-
 nology is attempting to smash the Maoist
 model of "peoples' war." We face a dilemma:
 Appeasement may only encourage the mili-
 tancy of our opponents, yet vigorous resist-
 ance may pose a challenge that increases
 their militancy.  Fighting tends to escalate.
 One line of approach, quite aside from
 military effort, should seek to undermine the
 militancy of our opponents.  Why not pay
 more attention to their motivation and try
 to manpiulate it?  Having seen how Mao-
 Tse-tung has manipulated Khrushchev and
 Chiang Kai-shek has manipulated us, can we
 not do some manipulating ourselves?
 There are several elements to use.  One Is
 .China's enormous national pride, the feeling
 in Peiping that this largest and oldest of
 countries naturally deserves a top position
 in the world.   In the background lies the
 fact that China was indeed at the top of the
 known world for more than 3,000 years of
 its recorded history.  The Chinese attitude
 of cultural superiority is deeprooted and
 still plays a part in foreign contact.
 A  second  element is the need  of any
 Chinese regime for prestige.  Peiping rules
 an incredibly vast mass of people by means
 of an enormous and farfiung bureaucracy.
 The prestige of the leadership and the morale
 of the populace and bureaucracy are inter-
 twined.  The rulers must seek by all, means
 to bolster their public image, show them-
 selves successful and make good their claims
 to wisdom and influence.
 For 16 years Peiping has buttressed its
 prestige by attacking "American imperial-
 ism," but its need for prestige is more basic
 than any particular target of attack.  Are
 there other ways to strengthen itself than by
 denouncing and "struggling against" the
 biggest overseas power?
 Another element is the converse of the
 above-the accumulated fatigue of revolu-
 tion.  Chairman Mao's exhortations to con-
 tinued struggle and austerity betray his
 lively fear  lest  the  new generation  grow
 tired of "permanent revolution."  His even-
 tual successors may respond differently to
 opportunities abroad.
 Finally, there are the concrete problems
 of the Chinese state, it needs for foreign
 capital goods and food supplies, needs that
 may grow-
 A program to take advantage of these ele-
 ments, recognizing the realities of cultural
 difference, would seek to enlarge Peiping's
 5861
 international contact and work out a greater
 role and responsibility for China's rulers in
 the world outside.  Many express this in
 wishful terms-"If only China would join
 the international world." Realists point out
 Peiping's reiterated refusal to do so on any
 feasible terms.
 What I am advocating here is not a single
 gesture but a continuing program, not an
 alternative to present policies but an addi-
 tion to them.  It is too simple to say that
 one cannot oppose an avowed enemy on one
 front while also making an accommodation
 with him on other fronts.  On the contrary,
 this is what diplomacy is all about.
 The whole idea of manipulation is to use
 both pressure and persuasion, both tough-
 ness and reasonableness, stick and carrot,
 with an objective calculation of the op-
 ponent's motives and needs.  This is not for-
 eign to President Johnson's thinking.
 A MOUSETRAP POLICY
 What conclusion emerges from a survey of
 China's revolutionary history and the cul-
 tural differences that separate us?
 First, we are up against a dynamic op-
 ponent whose strident anti-Americanism will
 not soon die away.  It comes from China's
 long background of feeling superior to all
 outsiders and expecting a supreme position
 in the world, which we seem to thwart.
 Second, we have little alternative but to
 stand up to Peiping's grandiose demands.
 Yet a containment policy which is only mili-
 tary, and nothing more, can mousetrap us
 Into war with China.  Our present fighting
 to frustrate the Maoist model in Vietnam Is
 a stopgap, not a long-term policy.
 We should add to this policy, and if pos-
 sible substitute for it a more sophisticated
 diplomatic program to undermine China's
 militancy by getting her more involved in
 formal international contact of all kinds and
 on every level.
 The point of this is psychological: Peiping
 is, to say the least, maladjusted, rebellious
 against the whole outer world, Russia as well
 as  America.   We are Peiping's  principal
 enemy because we happen now to be the big-
 gest outside power trying to foster world
 stability.
 But do we have to play Mao's game? Must
 we carry the whole burden of resisting Pei-
 ping's pretensions?  Why not let others in on
 the jobs?
 A Communist China seated in the U.N.
 could no longer pose as a martyr excluded by
 "American imperialism."    She would have
 to deal with U.N. members on concrete issues,
 playing politics in addition to attempting
 subversion (which sometimes backfires).
 She would have to face the self-interest of
 other countries and learn to act as a full
 member of international society for the first
 time in history.  This is the only way for
 China to grow up and eventually accept re-
 straints on her revolutionary ardor.
 SLIPPERY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
 Mr. SIMPSON.  Mr. President, on
 Tuesday night the Columbia Broadcast-
 ing Co. in its "CBS Reports" program
 carried  an  hour-long  show  entitled
 "IOU $315 Billion."
 Throughout this analysis of the in-
 dividual debt that Americans owe I felt
 that there were several economic sta-
 tistical and philosophical omissions in
 the CBS report.  However, in Wednes-
 day morning's New York Times, H. Erich
 Heinemann, writing a review of the
 show, very succinctly touched on the
 major points that should have been at
 least mentioned.
 I think the New York Times review of
 "CBS Reports: IOU $315 Billion" should

 have wider dissemination. I. therefore,
 ask unanimous consent that the review
 be inserted at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the REpOSD,
 as follows:
 (From the New York (N.Y.) Times, Max. 16,
 1966]
 TV: "CBS REPORTS" EYES OUR 10 U's AND IS
 SHOCKED--NETWORK'S    CONCLUSION:    "IT
 COSTS Too MUCH"-SOME STATISTICS REST
 ON A DUBIOUS BASIS
 "CBS Reports" took an hour-long look at
 the role of individual debt in the American
 economy last night, and came to the not-too-
 surprising conclusion that  the  consumer
 needs to be protected from, his own improvi-
 dence.
 "Interest rates are higher than they need
 to be;
 "The people who need credit the most find
 it hardest to get on terms they can afford;
 The patchwork of State and Federal reg-
 ulations tends to favor the lender over the
 borrower;
 "We would be on a sounder basis if people
 had a more accurate idea of the  cost of
 credit."
 All these conclusions, stated at the end of
 "IOU $315 billion" by Alexander Kendrick,
 ate surely estimable.  "CBS Reports" should
 be pleased with its firm stand against sin.
 Less. estimable, however, is some of the
 slippery economic analysis the  Columbia
 Broadcasting System uses to reach this con-
 clusion.  Mr. Kendrick lays much stress upon
 the "mountain of debt" under which the
 American consumer is laboring.  But he
 does not mention the value of the assets that
 the consumer owns, which far exceeds the
 $315 billion that he awes.
 Mr. Kendrick puts much emphasis upon
 the heavy interest cost of total consumer
 debt.  But be does not mention that in the
 fourth  quarter  of  1965  Americans  were
 earning interest at the annual rate of $38.2
 billion, while they were paying interest at
 the annual rate of only $11.6 billion.
 Indeed, this latter point cuts to the core
 of the central criticism of "I 0 U $315 bil-
 lion."  Mr. Kendrick, and his editors at CBS
 have chosen to focus upon the aggregate of
 $315 billion, of which more than two-thirds is
 accounted for by mortgages on real estate-
 including more than $20 billion of debt on
 farm properties, which is essentially com-
 mercial.
 Mr. Kendrick did not bother to ten us that
 well over half of total mortgage debt is held
 by nonprofit mutual financial institutions,
 which are owned by those who have entrusted
 their savings to them.
 Thrift, Mr. Kendrick to the contrary not-
 withstanding, has not gone out of style.
 Nor has the credit card brought us to the
 verge of a cashless society.  Mr. Kendrick
 might be interested. to know that an im-
 portant preoccupation of the Nation's mone-
 tary authorities has been to try to explain
 why currency in circulation has been increas-
 ing more rapidly in recent years than has
 personal income.
 So far, no simple answer has been found.
 It is perfectly true, as "CBS Reports" main-
 tains that the improvident and the feckless
 in American society are preyed upon by the
 demimonde of the credit world.
 There is good reason to be alarmed at the
 sharply rising rate of personal bankruptcies,
 and at the steady climb in"the rate of fore-
 closures on home mortgages.
 But there is no easy economic transition
 from the steady and necessary growth in
 consumer debt to the inflationary problems

 WEST VIRGINIA SKI INDUSTRY
 UNDER STUDY
 Mr., BYRD of West Virginia.  Mr.
 President, the Economic Development
 Administration has recently approved
 $72,300 for a technical assistance study
 to determine the ski industry potential
 In West Virginia.  This study, requested
 by the West Virginia Department of
 Commerce,  offers hope that a new
 source of recreation and pleasure may
 be developed for winter sports enthus-
 iasts.  The ski industry in the Moun-
 tain State is still in a fledgling state,
 with a number of problems needing
 resolving.
 Because of interest on the part of
 West Virginia sports lovers, and that of
 surrounding urbanites in neighboring
 States, that the ski industry be devel-
 oped, this grant is being enthusiastically
 welcomed.
 A. recent newspaper article by Roger
 Morris, carried by the Sunday Gazette-
 Mail State magazine, Charleston, W.
 Va., relates the interest which is in-
 creasingly  being  manifested in  this
 sport.  Its title its "Little Switzerland-
 Without the Snow."
 I ask unanimous consent that this
 March 13 newspaper article be printed
 in the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 LITTLE SWITZERLAND--WITHOUT THE SNOW
 (By Roger Morris)
 Skiers ask, "What good is a mountain in
 a winter that forgets to include snow?"
 "It is an ill wind turns none to good,"
 wrote Thomas Tusser back in the 16th cen-
 tury.  If we may substitute the word "foul"
 for "Ill," then we have an accurate descrip-
 tion of the state of affairs in Charleston and
 this section of the Kanawha Valley.
 While none can doubt that the wind over
 Charleston would turn the stomach of the
 stanchest  fishmonger  and  by  comparison
 make Liggett & Myers a clean air research
 group, the chemical industries which pro-
 duce this enriched assortment of smokes and
 stenches as a public byproduct have blown a
 little fresh air into the city's insularity by
 way of their cosmopolitan personnel.
 This has resulted in their contribution in
 the arts, government, and social concerns as
 patrons, performers, and planners.  Often
 when persons of a different background ca.n -
 Ski Club to see what might be done to keep
 their interests in slopes from declining. Ten
 years later and after some initial flounder-
 ing, the Kanawha Ski Club has close to 100
 members whose main concern during the
 winter months is to get out of the offices and
 birch-paneled kitchens as soon as possible on
 Friday afternoon and head for the nearest
 ski slope.
 As a matter of fact, about 38 of them are
 at this moment out on the slope or engaged
 in  some  ski  lodge  chatter  at  the  Seven
 Springs skiing area in Pennsylvania.
 "We haven't had too much luck with West
 Virginia ski slopes," says one club official,
 "although we have used Bald Knob near
 Beckley and Weiss Knob near Davis in the
 past.,,
 The trouble with the three State facilities
 centers around an absence of snow-making
 machines,  adequate  lodge  facilities,  chal-
 lenging slopes for advanced skiers and ski
 lifts.
 As a result, the ski club has had to look
 to weekend trips to Virginia and Pennsyl-
 vania, although the State's new recreational
 complex in the Canaan Valley promises to
 have good facilities in the next few years.
 Quite naturally these excursions furnish
 the main part of the club's activities, and
 during the past season-a bad one as such
 things go-three such trips were made, two
 to Seven Springs and one to the Homestead
 in Virginia.
 "Actually there isn't much of a ski atmos-
 phere at the Homestead," says club vice pres-
 ident, Jae Ryder, "but we go there once a
 year, because they have different slopes for
 the different classifications of skiers."
 While the outing to Virginia was by car,
 the two to Seven Springs were by chartered
 bus, a method which allows the older mem-
 bers to become acquainted with the novices.
 Although in some circles and in some resorts,
 skiing is very much a rich man's sport, the
 Kanawha club tries to keep expenses at a
 minimum so that everyone can join in the
 fun-skiingfor the masses, so to speak.  On
 Pennsylvania trips, for example, roundtrip
 bus fare, two nights' lodging, three meals, a
 dance, and the skiing facilities were provided
 for about $40. Rental equipment is another
 $6.
 Most of the rest of the club's activities are
 conducted during the regular meetings at a
 member's home, which includes ski movies
 and slides of previous trips.  In addition, an
 annual cocktail party is held in April or May,
 a sneaky way to get everyone together to pay
 dues.
 Club members range in age from pre-teens
 to over 60 and in ability from non-skiers to
 advanced skiers.  As the Kanawha Ski Club
 is a member of the Blue Ridge Ski Council,
 members have the opportunity to go skiing
 in Europe at reduced travel rates, a proposi-
 tion that some have already accepted.
 Ryder says that several plans are being
 made for next year, plus a request to the
 weatherman to have enough fall snow to in-
 sure a couple of trips before New Year's Day.
 Among these will be at least one each to
 the Homestead and Seven Springs and-cross

 THE ATLANTIC CONCEPT UNDER
 TEST
 Mr. CHURCH.  Mr. President, next
 week the Subcommittee on International
 Organization Affairs of the Senate For-
 eign Relations Committee will be hold-
 ing hearings on the concept of Atlantic
 unity.  Two recent moves by the Presi-
 dent of France, Gen. Charles de Gaulle,
 openly challenge this concept. John Al-
 lan May, European economic correspond-
 ent of the Christian Science Monitor, has
 recently reported on some of the Impli-
 cations of these developments.
 I ask unanimous consent that this ar-
 ticle be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 ATLANTIC  CONCEPT  UNDER TEST
 (By John Allan May)
 LONDON.-The Atlantic idea is rapidly ap-
 proaching a crucial test. Fresh French moves
 to torpedo it are expected here.
 The British have drafted a communique
 which they hope will be signed by the 14
 other partners condemning France's with-
 drawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Or-
 ganization.
 Britain, through diplomatic channels, also
 is repeating its intention never to join
 Europe except on terms that preserve the
 Atlantic concept. This is to be stressed par-
 ticularly strongly in Bonn.
 The Atlantic idea, of course, is of an inte-
 grated alliance between the United States,
 Canada, Britain, and Western Europe, stand-
 ing as a single bastion against international
 communism.
 It now is openly challenged by President
 de Gaulle on two fronts-in NATO and in
 the world of the International Monetary
 Fund.
 Some strategic analysis here say that Pres-
 ident de Gaulle's -aim is to create a third
 force that would be independent of the
 United States and capable of reaching an
 understanding with the Soviet Union.  That
 understanding can contain-"hold within
 fixed limits: restrain"-the two Germanys,
 East and West.
 VISIT TO MOSCOW
 Due to visit Moscow in June, the French
 President alms to sell this idea to the Soviet
 chiefs, according to this analysis.  The So-
 viets, too, might be prepared to cooperate.
 [The.French viewpoint, on the other hand
 is somewhat different. It is that France will
 remain the "ally of her allies" and a member
 of the Western alliance.  But General de
 Gaulle insists that  the  NATO integrated
 command is outdated because of changed de-
 fense needs.  Therefore, he has said, France
 and Europe must be free of this integration
 in order to be more flexible in establishing
 contacts with the Communist nations of
 Europe.
 [French Foreign Minister Maurice Couve
 de Murville told the United Nations General
 Assembly last fall: "Since the division of
 Germany is born of the division of Europe,
 the prerequisite condition for the elimina-
 This means a profound and necessarily grad
 ual transformation of the present situa
 tion."]
 The "third force" theory here is that reor-
 ganization of NATO, and of the standing
 group in Washington, is going to spotlight
 the special position of West Germany.  Ger-
 many will become the strongest European
 'member  of  NATO.  It  stands  in   NATO's
 frontline.
 Qan this Germany be denied an equal share
 in the planning of NATO strategy? Can it be
 denied an equal share in nuclear arms?
 Surely not.
 But, on the other hand, will the Soviet
 Union allow such an upgrading of West
 Germany's status to go without a challenge?
 Surely not either.
 A  fresh  Soviet-American  confrontation
 would then be expected if West Germany
 were upgraded.
 Nor is Britain prepared to allow a German
 "finger on the nuclear button."  Thus the
 effect of President de Gaulle's squeeze play
 could spread, according to this theory.  He
 intends, if he can, to accentuate the one
 important area of division between the views
 of the American and the British adminis-
 trations.
 At the same time, as the world has seen
 but perhaps not much noticed, President
 de Gaulle has vetoed an Atlantic solution to
 the international monetary problem.  His in-
 sistence on gold as the essential basis of
 the world's payments system seems to be a
 tactic in a battle to "get the American dol-
 lar out of Europe."
 PAWTUCKET, R.I., CONFERENCE of
 WATER SHORTAGE AND POLLU-
 TION CONTROL
 Mr. PELL.  Mr. President, at 10:30
 this morning, Mayor Robert Burns, of
 the city of Pawtucket, R.I., called to or-
 der a conference held in that city, to
 discuss the various aspects of water
 shortages and water pollution control.
 A subject which has vital importance to
 Rhode Island as well as the whole North-
 eastern section of our country, as we en-
 ter what could be a fifth year of drought.
 The conference, which will include
 officials from many Rhode Island cities
 and towns, met with my enthusiastic ap-
 proval,  when  the  subject was first
 broached by Mayor Burns. I am pleased
 to have been able to arrange attendance
 at the meeting by Mr. Edward V. Geis-
 mar, Chief of the Water Quality Section
 of the Federal Water Pollution Control
 Administration of the Department of
 Health, Education, and Welfare.  Mr.
 Geismar, a highly regarded expert in the
 field of water pollution, will discuss both
 the causes of this problem, and the means
 of clearing it up.
 Conferences such as this, are valuable
 both on the local and national levels.
 One city, or one area, working alone, can-
 not meet the problem of pollution con-
 trol.  Concerted effort is needed by all
 the communities affected.  In this spe-
 cific case, those cities and towns in the
 Blackstone River Valley, are working and
 studying together. It is hoped that the
 example of Pawtucket will be followed
 by many other areas with the same type
 of problem.
 I therefore salute the city of Paw-
 tucket, and Mayor Burns, for having the
 foresight and Initiative to call such a
 meeting, and wish the conferees success.
 UTAH PILOT HERO OF A SHAU
 EVACUATION
 Mr. BENNETT.  Mr. President, 1 week
 ago today, Maj. Bernard Fisher, an Air
 Force pilot, who was born and raised in
 Clearfield, Utah, distinguished himself
 as one of the real heroes of the Vietnam
 war. Major Fisher was piloting an AlE
 aircraft on a fighter-bomber mission dur-
 ing the crucial battle of U.S. Army Spe-
 cial Forces camp at A Shau, 50 miles west
 of Danang, South Vietnam, when he
 spotted a fellow pilot shot down by enemy
 ground fire. Without thinking of his own
 safety, Major Fisher landed his Sky-
 raider aircraft on a bomb-scarred run-
 way which was under heavy enemy fire,
 and literally plucked his fellow officer up
 by the seat of his pants and flew him to
 safety.
 The rescued officer, Air Force Maj.
 Stafford M. Myers, had nothing but
 praise for the heroic efforts of Major
 Fisher.
 Myers said:
 In my fondest dreams, I didn't believe any-
 body would land there to pull me out, not
 even a chopper.
 Another Air Force officer was later
 quoted as saying:
 This is the most daring rescue I have heard
 of since World War II.  I can't think of any-
 thing we did in Korea to match it.
 .Mr. President, I applaud the valiant
 efforts of Major Fisher and those of hun-
 dreds of other U.S. servicemen who daily
 are distinguishing themselves in battle
 in Vietnam. We should all the grateful
 for this courage and devotion to duty. I
 am confident that Major Fisher's heroic
 deed will not go unnoticed, either by his
 fellow servicemen, or by his Government.
 I ask unanimous consent to insert at
 this point in the RECORD a UPI news story
 which appeared in the March 11, 1966,
 Salt Lake Deseret News, and an editorial
 from the Standard Examiner, Ogden,
 Utah, dated March 12, 1966.
 There being no objection, the article
 and editorial were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:

 DYNAMIC RESCUE:  "NOTHING LIKE IT"
 SAIGON.-"I'11  bet nobody's ever seen an
 old man like me run like that," said U.S.
 Air Force Maj. Stafford M. Myers, as he re-
 called Friday how a fellow pilot rescued him
 under fire when he was shot down Thursday.
 Maj. Bernard F. Fisher, 39, a native of
 Utah and whose wife and family reside at
 Kuna, Idaho, flew his AlE fighter-bomber
 through a hail of Communist ground fire
 and landed behind Myers during the battle
 at the U.S. Army Special Forces camp at A
 Shan, 50 miles west of Da Nang.
 Myers, also 39, had crashlanded his own
 plane on the short dirt runway near the
 camp after being hit by enemy fire.
 Myers' Skyraider was enveloped in flames
 as he hit the runway.  The cockpit filled
 with  smoke.  He  dived into  the  nearest
 ditch,  only yards away from  Communist
 gunners firing at other U.S. aircraft that
 were strafing the area around the beseiged
 camp.

 "In nay fondest dreams I didn't believe
 anybody would land there to pull me out,
 not even a chopper," Myers said.
 He said his eyes smarted from the smoke
 as he looked for cover, but then he saw
 Fisher's Skyraider roaring down the runway.
 The  downed  pilot  waved,  and  Fisher
 spotted him. It took him another 100 feet
 to stop his plane.
 "He's crazy," Myers  said   he thought.
 "He shouldn't have done it. We'll never
 get out of here."
 Myers leaped from the ditch and ran for
 his life.  He reached the. Skyraider, but
 "had a hard time getting up on the wing"
 because of the blast from the propeller.
 Finally Fisher "pulled me up by the seat
 of the pants," he said.  There was no time
 to talk, but Myers patted Fisher on the back
 a couple of times as the major gunned the
 plane.  And hugged him as they taxied down
 the bomb-scarred runway.
 Myers noticed that the plane's wing was
 full of holes, but somehow the Korean war-
 vintage plane held together as Fisher flew
 out of danger.
 One Air Force officer later said "This is the
 most daring rescue r have heard of since
 World War II.  I can't think of anything we
 did in Korea to match it."
 Fisher gave a lot of credit for the dare-
 devil rescue to the other three All pilots
 who were strafing the area all around Myers'
 downed Skyraider.
 One Vietcong closed to within 20 feet of
 Myers as the Air Force major sprinted for the
 rescue aircraft.   He  was  cut down by  a
 burst from one of the Skyraiders swooping
 across the field at tree-top level.
 [From the Ogden Standard-Examiner,
 Mar. 12, 1966]
 UTAHAN          BECOMES  TOP VIET  WAR  HERO
 The war in Vietnam, grim from the start,
 has produced few headlines about individual
 acts of heroism.
 All men fighting and dying there are
 heroes in their own right. It's that kind of a
 war.
 What we mean, however, is the type of
 exploit that fires the imagination and makes
 an American say: "That took a lot of guts."
 That's what they're saying today about
 Utah-born Maj. Bernard Fisher.
 He deliverately landed his old Skyraider
 propeller-driven fighter on the battered air-
 strip of the Shau Special Forces Camp, picked
 up a fellow pilot who had survived a crash
 and took off again while Vietcong troops
 fired at him.
 Other Air Force fighter pilots helped the
 rescue by  coming  in low machinegunning
 enemy soldiers who were trying to stop
 Fisher and his passenger, Maj. Stafford M.
 Myers.
 Fisher and Myers got away.
 It's that type of bravery that inspires other
 fighting men to go all-out in service to their
 country.
 It should be equally inspirational to we
 civilians at home.
 If a pilot like Bernard Fisher is willing to
 brave the Communist guns to save the life of
 another U.S. aviator, the least we can do is
 to show appreciation for the risk he took.
 Contrast this with the burning of a draft
 card or the ranting of Cassius Clay.
 The Air Force should be mighty proud of
 Major Fisher.
 So should the high school in Kaysville
 where he was graduated before he joined the
 Navy in World War II.
 We know that his mother, Mrs. Levina
 Fisher of Ogden, is mighty proud of her
 flier son.  So is his wife, now living in Kuna,
 Idaho, and his brothers and sisters in Ogden,
 Clearfield, South Weber and Boise.
 Next time he's home on leave, we should
 proclaim a Maj. Bernard Fisher Day in Utah.
 He deserves to know, in person, how his fel-
 low Utahans feel about his bravery.

 Their courage and performance under

 spacecraft and the training they have
 received, which involves the checking and
 rechecking and simulation of every detail
 of their prospective voyage into space.
 Yesterday America proved the value of
 building redundancy into our space ve-
 hicles because of our paramount regard
 for life.
 Among the marvels of Wednesday's
 excitement was their unscheduled re-
 entry, which was in every respect perfect
 and perhaps the best reentry the United
 States ever has accomplished.
 While the rendezvous was only par-
 tially successful, it may prove that we
 will learn more from failure than from
 success in this instance as the voyage is
 studied and the data separated and an-
 alyzed and used to strengthen our future
 space ventures.
 The Soviets were also busy in space on
 Wednesday.  They completed a 22-day
 flight of two dogs, and this accomplish-
 ment indicates that we cannot slacken
 our efforts in space if we are to maintain
 leadership and progress in this field.
 Mr. President, I also must observe that
 while these exciting events were taking
 place in different parts of this solar sys-
 tem, another milestone was reached in a
 remote section of the desert in my State
 of Nevada. I refer to the highly success=
 ful test of a nuclear engine at the Nevada
 Test Site of the Atomic Energy Commis-
 sion.  The engine was operated at sig-
 nificant power for 18 minutes, 13 minutes
 of which was conducted at full power.
 This achievement added to our national
 capability of one day being ready to send
 vehicles and man beyond the moon, and
 perhaps even beyond our own solar sys-
 tem. For it is commonly recognized now
 that nuclear power will be the only
 energy to take man to targets beyond our
 immediate planning.
 In summary, Wednesday was a lucky
 day for two courageous American astro-
 nauts; it was a day not without signifi-
 cance for the Soviets in their space ef-                                                        Not  everyone  comprehends  this trading

 Idaho School Trustees Association and
 State legislators on February 26, 1966.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent
 to have Mr. Turman's fine address
 printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
 IN EDUCATION
 (An address by James A. Turman, Associate
 Commissioner of Education for Field Serv-
 ices, Office of Education, U.S. Department
 of Health, Education, and Welfare, Wash-
 ington, D.C.)
 Unfortunately, neither our new U.S. Com-
 missioner of Education Harold Howe nor our
 Associate  Commissioner  for Federal-State
 Relations  Wayne  Reed   could  accept  this
 engagement this morning because of prior
 commitments.  Therefore, Mr. John Snider
 invited me to represent the U.S. Office of
 Education here in today's conference on the
 subject, "What Are the Proper Roles of-
 Fed-eral, State, and Local Educational Agencies?"
 It is a pleasure for me, however, to have
 this opportunity to participate with you in
 discussing this all-encompassing topic.  My
 assignment, mainly, is to discuss the role of
 the Federal Government in education.
 I am especially pleased to see that this is
 a joint meeting of the Idaho School Trustees
 Association and the State legislators. Hav-
 ing been a member and speaker of the Texas
 House of Representatives, I realize the im-
 portance of involving legislators in our dis-
 cussions on education.
 There  are some  perfectly decent words
 that nice Americans seldom use together in
 the same phrase.   "Education" and "poli-
 tics" are two of them.                                                                                                                                 While each word
 is quite alright on its own, the two in com-
 bination seem to conjure unhealthy, unre-
 fined, even "propagandizing" images to many
 people.
 Actually, the notion that politics and edu-
 catiQn should not have anything to do with
 each other is based on a misunderstanding
 both of politics and of the role of educa-
 tion in a democracy and how that role is
 determined.  And the idea that they do not
 have anything to do with each other flies up
 in the face of the facts.

 as leader in opposition to it this year,
 although I am still opposed to the
 amendment, provided the administra-
 tion will provide for an adequate amount
 of aid to students who I think ought to
 go to college,  I think it is possible to
 supply that aid to them on a more uni-
 form and, I happen to believe, a fairer
 basis than the procedure provided for in
 the Ribicoff -Dominick amendment. But
 I could not, in good faith, speak against
 the amendment until at least there can
 be a clarification of where this admin-
 istration actually stands on Federal aid
 to education.  I say that because, as I
 said the other day, I stood in that man-
 agerial position over there in the ma-
 jority leader's place, and have taken
 through the Senate, as the manager of
 education bills, one bill after another.
 I made the representations that the ad-
 ministration authorized me to make.  I
 wish to say those representations can-
 not be reconciled with the President's
 budget message this year.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  That is the point I
 wished to bring out at this time, and I
 am glad that the Senator from Oregon
 has brought it up. Because, as a matter
 of fact, in a very great number of cases,
 to my knowledge-the impacted area bill,
 the National Defense Education Act
 loans, the cuts in the vocational educa-
 tion programs, and a few others which I
 added up last night-the difference be-
 tween the proposals in the President's
 budget and the authorizations passed, by
 Congress is more than $547 million.
 I would suggest for the record, and
 to the distinguished Senator from Ore-
 gon, who has worked so hard in the edu-
 cational field and done such a fine Job,
 that it is not the function of the White
 House or of Congress to try to balance
 the budget by depriving people of the
 opportunity for a good education.
 That is exactly the effect these cuts
 will have, unless we can find some mech-
 anism by which we can retain the ability
 of our universities to provide quality
 education, and of our elementary and
 secondary schools to continue with the
 fine standard of education that they
 have been giving our young people.
 Mr.  MORSE.  Mr.  President,  will
 the Senator yield at that point?
 Mr. DOMINICK,  I am happy to
 yield.
 Mr. MORSE.  I could not agree with
 the Senator more. The Senator is a
 member of my subcommittee and of
 -the full committee. I simply want the
 RECORD to show that in my judgment,
 this administration has pulled the rug
 out from under us in connection with
 the representations we have made in
 the past, in speaking for the adminis-
 tration in support of education legisla-
 tion. Until  the  administration  re-
 stores those funds.--and I shall fight
 hard to have them restored-and until
 the administration keeps faith with
 those of us who, have put the past
 legislation through, I shall oppose the
 administration at. every step on educa-
 tion legislation this year.
 'I preferred the approach we were
 making.  I think the administration
 was sound in that approach, but it has
 left that approach, and that is why I
 ment embodies that uniform principle of
 taxation which I think is fair and avoids
 the charge of being class legislation.
 Nevertheless I have no hesitancy in
 saying that if we cannot have the. other
 type of Federal aid for which I thought
 this administration stood until I read
 the budget message this year, then it is
 better to have this form of aid of the
 Ribicoff -Dominick  amendment  than
 none. At least the aid that will be pro-
 vided  under  the                                                                                                        Ribicoff -Dominick
 amendment will be of some assistance to
 some students, and that is better than
 no assistance at all.
 Therefore, as chairman of the Educa-
 tion Subcommittee of the Senate, I raise
 my voice again in plea and warning to
 the President of the United States, that
 unless there is a return to the implemen-
 tation of the aid program for which we
 have been fighting in past sessions of
 Congress, I shall fight in the Subcom-
 mittee on Education and in the full com-
 mittee for necessary' legislative amend-
 ments, and let the Members of Congress
 stand up and be counted, as to whether
 they will support the President in what
 I consider to be an inexcusable. blow
 against the young people of this coun-
 try by way of his budget recommenda-
 tions on education.  That will be my
 position in this session of Congress.  If
 we get into a position where the only
 aid we can get-although I do not be-
 lieve it would be the most preferable
 aid-for the benefit of the youth of this
 country is the kind of aid which the Sen-
 ator from Connecticut, and the Senator
 from Colorado-in good faith, complete
 sincerity, and out of deep conviction-
 have been presenting for several years
 to the Senate, then, for the first time,
 I will vote to support it. I would rather
 have that than no aid at all.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator from Oregon yield?
 Mr. MORSE. I yield.
 Mr. DOMINICK. I thank the Senator
 from Oregon for arguing that position.
 I do not wish to go into any debate on
 the merits of the particular proposal at
 this time, but I would say to the Senator,
 as he knows, that I have supported the
 higher education bill, led by the Senator
 from Oregon; and it seems to me that
 our proposal would be another leg on
 this same table.  I am gratified to hear
 the Senator from Oregon state that if
 we are unable to get the other proposal
 put back, which he and I and other Sen-
 ators have worked so hard for, he will
 be for this kind of proposal.
 administration in its opposition to the
 Senator's amendment, until the admin-
 istration is willing to come back and
 support the program we had underway.
 Look at the cuts the administration
 is making in the land-grant colleges of
 this country, and the effect that those
 cuts will have on the educational op-
 portunities of many of our young men
 and women.  I  want the American
 people to know that notwithstanding
 what the President says, there is a
 great difference between his words and
 the proposed actions encompassed in
 his Bureau of the Budget report to
 Congress.
 I pay no attention to a politician's
 words unless his words compare and
 square with his actions.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  I know what a val-
 iant fighter the Senator from Oregon is,
 and I think this is due warning to the
 administration.
 It still seems strange to me as a Sen-
 ator to find, that the administration will
 send to the Capitol two White House aids
 and the Postmaster General to defeat
 one bill on which Congress is supposed to
 be establishing policy.  That is exactly
 what was done in the case of the tax
 credit proposal that we had before us
 in March.
 I, for one, am still a believer that Con-
 gress is supposed to establish policy, that
 this is not, supposedly, either a one-party
 government or a one-man government,
 and until such time as we can establish
 this proposition and this principle, we
 are going to find more and more trouble
 in Congress being able to take its his-
 toric role as a policymaker, and to deter-
 mine what legislation should be passed as
 desired by the people of this country, and
 not just as desired by the one man in the
 White House.
 I yield the floor.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, before I
 turn to another matter, I wish to make
 a few additional comments about' the
 Ribicoff-Dominick amendment.
 I want the record to be perfectly clear
 that I would much prefer not to have
 the type of aid that is provided in the
 Dominick-Ribicoff amendment, if this
 administration will go forward and sup-
 port adequate funds for,the type of Fed-
 eral education aid to, students in this
 country which has been encompassed in
 the programs for which we have been
 working so hard for so many years in
 the Senate.
 Of course, my view is well known.  I
 think what we need to do is to provide
 the aid to those students who need it,
 who otherwise could not go to college.
 I think children from the families cov-
 ered in the program that the Senator
 from Connecticut and the Senator from
 Colorado have in mind can best be helped
 by a general aid bill, with loan provisions,
 scholarship provisions, and work-study
 provisions.  Furthermore, as I pointed
 out last year, I think that the aid that is
 sought to be offered in the Ribicoff-
 Dominick amendment is a form of class
 legislation, ,in that it provides tax bene-
 fits for a special class of parents in this
 country, namely those who happen to
 have children who may wish to go to co1-
 . Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I was
 very much interested in the comments of
 the Senator from Pennsylvania  [Mr.
 CLARK] a few moments ago as he dis-
 cussed the Kraft article entitled "The
 Four Pillars of Asia"-the four pillars
 involving our Asian policy.
 I associate myself. with the remarks of
 the  Senator from  Pennsylvania. Of
 course, I go much further than he does.
 I am glad that, at least, as the appropri-

 snick amendment to the tax bill which
 was an effort on our part to provide a
 tax credit for the cost of higher educa-
 tion.
 I have stated publicly that,  even
 though we were defeated on that par-
 ticular amendment, I liave no intention
 of giving up the fight for an education
 tax credit.
 I wish to state for the record, that I
 am considering presenting the amend-
 ment again this year, in either the same
 or a different form, in an effort to ob-
 tain a more accurate test of strength
 for the amendment on its merits.
 It was curious to me that, although
 several other amendments were added to
 the bill, by the Senate this particular
 amendment, which would not have af-
 fected the revenues of the Federal Gov-
 ernment until 1968, was defeated.
 I know that I personally received
 several calls from downtown asking if I
 was going to support the tax bill. How-
 ever, no particular mention was made
 of the Ribicoff-Dominick amendment. I
 had suspected that a great number of
 other calls and personal contacts had
 been made from downtown to other Sen-
 ators.
 I was interested to see, following the
 vote on that particular amendment, that
 several people publicly, in the various
 newspapers and columns, remarked on
 the extreme pressure placed on Senators
 by the White House in an effort to defeat
 that proposal.
 I have before me the Evans-Novak
 column which was published in the
 Washington Post of Sunday, March 13,
 1966.
 I ask unanimous consent that that
 portion of the article entitled "To the
 Rescue" be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, a portion
 of the article was ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 TO THE RESCUE
 Postmaster General Lawrence F. O'Brien,
 former top White House congressional lobby-
 ist, was rushed into the breach in the Sen-
 ate last week.  He was called on to help
 defeat the amendment of Senator ABRAHAM
 RrricorF, Democrat, of Connecticut, to give
 parents a tax credit to offset the cost of col-
 lege education.
 Without O'Brien, the Ribicoff amendment
 was slated to pass by a 46-to-44 vote.  When
 O'Brien and White House aids got through
 twisting  arms,  nine  Senators  who     had
 planned to support the amendment were
 peeled away.
 Through no fault of O'Brien's, the victory
 was pyrrhic.  Angered by the high-pressure
 lobbying, the Senate went on an independ-
 ence binge and approved two reductions in
 the President's $6 billion Vietnam war tax
 increase.  Both amendments were ignored
 in the White House concentration against
 the Ribicoff amendment.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, the
 very distinguished writer, Mr. Lee M.
 Cohn, of the Washington Star, wrote
 an article entitled "Senate-Altered Tax
 Bill Goes to Conference," which also
 discusses the pressures applied by the
 White House in its successful effort to
 defeat the proposed tax credit amend-
 ment.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the portion of the article deal-
 ing with the efforts of the White House
 to defeat the amendment be printed at
 this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 from the article was ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 SENATE-ALTERED TAX BILL GOES TO CONFER-
 ENCE-AMENDMENTS   CUT   NET   REVENUE
 GAIN BY $1.1 BILLION
 (By Lee M. Cohn)
 The administration's battered tax bill was
 rushed to a Senate-House conference today
 in a drive to meet President Johnson's March
 15 deadline for final action.
 Two major amendments cut the bill's esti-
 mated  net  revenue  gain.  from  $5.9  to
 $4.8 billion over the next 15 months before
 the Senate passed it yesterday, 79 to 9.
 One of the amendments would exempt
 local residential phone calls from the admin-
 istration's proposed excise tax increase from
 3 to 10 percent.
 This amendment, approved 46 to 42-yester-
 day, reduced the revenue gain in the Senate
 bill by $315 million.
 SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT
 The  other  major  amendment,  adopted
 Tuesday, would give minimum social security
 benefits to persons 70 and older who are not
 now eligible. It would cost the Treasury
 $790 million a year, starting next July 1.
 Since the phone excise is very unpopular
 on both sides of the Capitol., there is a good
 chance that the conferees will go along with
 the Senate.
 The social security amendment is more
 vulnerable to dumping in conference  be-
 cause it is so sweeping and extraneous to
 the tax bill.
 Despite the Senate's mutinous temper,
 hard lobbying by the administration beat a
 proposal to give tax credits to parents or
 others sending children to college at a cost
 of $1 billion a year to the Treasury.
 SPONSORED BY RII{ICOFF
 The amendment, sponsored by Senator
 ABRAHAM A. RlsxcoFF, Democrat, of Connecti-
 cut, would have allowed parents and others
 paying  expenses                  of  college  tuition,  fees,
 books, and supplies to subtract up to $325
 a year from income taxpayments.  It also
 was rejected in 1964, by a vote of 48 to 45.
 This amendment was rejected yesterday,
 47 to 37, after what one Senator called fierce
 pressure by the White House.
 A supporter of the amendment said the
 White  House  "snapped  the  whip"  and
 "lashed" Senators into line against the pro-
 posal.
 White House pressure persuaded even some
 of  the amendment's  cosponsors to vote
 against it.  This was the case with Demo-
 cratic  Senators  WARREN  G.  MAGNUSON,                                                                     Of
 Washington;  EDwARD V. LONG of Missouri,
 and JosEPH M. MONTOYA, of New Mexico.
 Supporters of the amendment figured that
 White House pressure switched seven votes
 in all.
 Marvin Watson, President Johnson's ap-
 pointments  secretary,  reportedly  led  the
 drive against the amendment, assisted by
 Postmaster General Lawrence P. O'Brien,
 who formerly was in charge of congressional
 liaison, and Mike Manatos, legislative liai-
 son man for the Senate.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, in-
 terestingly enough, the New York Herald
 Tribune published an article on March
 10, 1966, written by Mr. Andrew J. Glass
 under the headline "Senate Cuts Tax
 Bill From 6 to 5 Billion-No Local Phone
 Rise," which also refers to the Ribicoff-
 Dominick amendment.
 5873
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 from the article was ordered to be printed
 In the RECORD, as follows:
 SENATE CUTS TAX BILL FROM 6 TO 5 BILLION-
 No  LOCAL  PHONE  RISE
 The White House had mounted a hard-
 nosed lobbying effort against a ,plan by Sen-
 ator ABRAHAM RIBICOFF, Democrat, of Con-
 necticut, to offset in part the cost of a col-
 lege education with up to $325 in tax credits.
 As a result, this $1 billion proposal was de-
 feated, 47 to 37-even though its revenue-
 losing impact would not be felt until 1968.
 Senate sources reported that Presidential
 appointments Secretary W. Marvin Watson
 had called key legislators on the eve of the
 showdown and told them that "they were
 through" at the White House if they backed
 the Ribicoff plan.
 Mr. Watson, these sources said, emphasized
 that he was speaking for the President who,
 they said, was prepared to deal them out of
 all Federal patronage and projects if "you
 cross him on this vote."
 The  anti-Ribicoff  campaign  apparently
 left the White House exposed and napping on
 the social security and phone tax proposals.
 "Lyndon    Johnson  outsmarted himself,"
 an influential Senate Democrat said.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, I
 have deliberately, placed these in the
 RECORD  to show the extreme pressure
 applied by the White House to defeat the
 Ribicoff-Dominick amendment.  I be-
 lieve it is ironic that the White House
 should oppose this measure so strenu-
 ously when I was trying, in concert with
 Senator RIBICOFF and other Senators, to
 provide a mechanism whereby people
 could increase  the opportunities for
 young people to go to college and, at the
 same time, increase the opportunities for
 colleges to receive more funds.
 CONCLUSION OF MOENING BUSINESS
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Will the
 Senator from Colorado suspend for a
 moment?
 The hour of 1 o'clock having arrived,
 morning business is now concluded.
 The Senator from Colorado may pro-
 ceed.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, I
 think it was an important amendment,
 and I think it is a proposal which sooner
 or later will pass the Senate.
 I was happy to note that the distin-
 guished  Senator  from  Oregon  [Mr.
 MORSE], who is on the floor at the
 moment, while opposing the bill last year
 and voting against it again this time, did
 not take an active part in the debate
 against the amendment, and I very much
 appreciate his courtesy in this regard.
 It is a measure which, to me, is of
 extreme importance in that it supports
 diversity in education and provides an
 opportunity for, private funds to enter
 the educational field, without involving
 ourselves in the church-state relation-
 ship.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. DOMINICK.  I am happy to yield
 to the Senator from Oregon.
 Mr. MORSE.  I thank my friend, the
 Senator from Colorado.  As he observed,
 I did not participate in the debate this
 year in opposition to his amendment,
 although I voted against it.

 conducting in southeast Asia comes up
 for consideration next Monday,  the
 Senator from Pennsylvania, as he indi-
 cated today, will have some reserva-
 tions in respect thereto.
 Mr. President, I am hoping that the
 appropriation bill may be the vehicle, at
 long last, which those in this body who
 have expressed great reservation to the
 administration's policy of conducting this
 war may use for the imposition of long
 past due and much-needed checks upon
 the administration in respect to the
 slaughter of American boys now taking
 place in southeast Asia.  It is a slaughter
 which, in my judgment, cannot be. justi-
 fled, a slaughter which is involving us in
 a war in which we should never have
 been involved in the firgt place.
 I was glad to hear the Senator from
 Pennsylvania point out that we should
 not be interested in saving face.  I would
 add that we should be introduced in sav-
 ing lives.
 I was also glad to hear the Senator
 from Pennsylvania point out that it was
 desirable we take a position which I
 would call a position of legitimate de-
 fense, a holding position-which will pro-
 tect our boys, and also stop the killing
 of a large number of South Vietnamese
 which will take place if we continue to
 escalate the war-through such a hold-
 ing action as General Gavin recommends
 it would be possible for other forces to
 come into the picture and seek to bring
 the war to an end by the imposition of a
 needed cease-fire order to be enforced by
 nations not involved in the war as com-
 batants.
 Mr. President, I wish to make these
 comments today because it needs to be
 constantly drilled into the thinking of
 the American people as to what the ma-
 jor premise of those of us opposing the
 war rests upon.
 What is needed is to have a cease-fire
 order enforced against the United States,
 against the South Vietnamese, against
 the North Vietnamese, and against the
 Vietcong.  In my judgment, if we leave
 this war to the United States, with its
 predominantly unilateral military action
 in southeast Asia, our country will lead
 the world into a massive war in Asia, and
 what may come out of that war is awful
 to even think about.
 Therefore, I plead again that my coun-
 try proceed to exercise its influence, its
 prestige, and its obligations as a member
 of the United Nations.  In my judg-
 ment, there is not a good faith attempt
 being made in New York City to bring
 this issue out into the open with full
 Security Council debate.
 In my judgment, the administration
 and our Ambassador to the United Na-
 tions, Mr. Arthur Goldberg, are not mak-
 ing the record that this country should
 make in seeking to bring this matter
 out into the open and find out exactly
 what the Security Council will or will
 not do.
 I have some views as to why we are
 not doing it.  Of course, I believe that
 our approach to the Security Council was
 a belated one. I pleaded 21/2 years ago,
 and day after day during all that in-
 tervening period, that we should take
 this issue to the Security Council.  Fi-
 nally, there started developing across the
 country a wave of public opinion support
 for the senior Senator from Oregon.
 I happen to know something about that
 support, Mr. President, and I happen to
 know something about the intensity with
 which it was represented to the White
 House.  In my judgment, the adminis-
 tration could not stand up any-longer
 against a failure to take a resolution to
 the Security Council of the United Na-
 tions, for millions of American people
 were asking the question: "Why don't
 they take it to the United Nations?"
 The sad thing is that our President
 sent the problem to the United Nations
 with an olive branch in one hand and
 bombs in the other. Behind the scenes
 in the United Nations, and in the cloak-
 rooms there, most of the discussion since
 that time has been about the bombs and
 not about the olive branch.
 Of course, if it is brought out into the
 full glare of world opinion for Security
 Council debate and discussion, as it
 should be, the United States will get
 taken to the international woodshed.
 We had better get that spanking or that
 whipping behind us now.  Some others
 also will have to go to that woodshed;
 namely, all the combatants, South Viet-
 nam, North Vietnam, and the Vietcong-
 because those are the nations along
 with us which happened to be threaten-
 ing the peace of the world.
 We Americans do not like to face the
 fact that we are a threat to the peace
 of the world.  But we are.  We are act-
 ing, for the most part,.on a unilateral
 basis.  We should be insisting upon a
 multilateral approach to peacekeeping
 in southeast Asia.
 Accordingly, Mr. President, I urge
 once more that my Government give
 evidence-clear, convincing evidence-
 that we are insisting that this matter
 come on out into the open for world
 debate.  Let all criticism be put behind
 us, for in that Security Council debate
 the violations by the United States of
 the Geneva accords, section after section,
 will undoubtedly be made a matter of
 world record, for all the world to see.
 The interesting thing is that most lead-
 ers of most governments in the world al-
 ready recognize it.
 Travel with me, as I did last fall as a
 Senate delegate appointed by the ad-
 ministration, through Asia,  We soon
 found that the leaders of the great Asian
 powers hold no brief for America's uni-
 lateral course of action in southeast Asia.
 Let us get that record made and do
 our part in seeing to it that the viola-
 tions of the Vietcong and North Viet-
 nam are clearly made a part of the world
 record.  Then, let us get on with the job
 of enforcing a peAce in southeast Asia,
 and ending this (laughter.  That is why
 I was so interested in the comments of
 the Senator from Pennsylvania  [Mr.
 CLARK], which I interpret to mean recog-
 nition on his part that we need to take
 a holding position, a defensive position,
 which will protect our forces and protect
 our allies and bring an end to an esca-
 lating of the war.
 The United States is following an ex-
 panding military policy which, as we ex-
 pand it, endangers our becoming involved
 5875
 in a war with China which, in my judg-
 ment; will move into a war with Russia
 that will mean a third world war.
 I think these are times when we ought
 to stop running these risks.  I think
 these are times when the Pentagon Build-
 ing should be put on a leash and have it
 made perfectly clear that to carry out its
 duty to defend the security of this Re-
 public it is not entitled to follow a course
 of action that threatens to involve us in
 a massive war in Asia.  Such a war will
 bog down hundreds of thousands of
 Americans for years and years, until, at
 long last, we will be put out of Asia.
 Let us face it, no white nation, including
 the United States, will be permitted to
 stay in Asia and exercise a role of domi-
 nation in any part of Asia.  That era is
 gone.
 It is interesting that the other Western
 nations have learned that lesson, but not
 the United States.
 We should follow the course of action
 which is clearly implied in the remarks
 of the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr.
 CLARK], but if not, I assert it as my own.
 We should give the United Nations an
 opportunity to undertake the-primary-
 and I underline the word "primary"-ob-
 ligation and responsibility of the mem-
 bers of the United Nations, and that is to
 enforce the peace when a threat of war
 exists.  That is the primary purpose of
 the Security Council.
 It may very well be that the Security
 Council will fall down on that obligation,
 but I want to find out.  I should think
 my Government would want to find out,
 instead of saying, as many have been
 heard to say, "Well, we are sure that
 France or Russia will veto such a pro-
 posal."  We do not know until we find
 out.  As I have said in the past, if either
 one of them does, then that country is on
 the spot, and the United States would be
 taken off the spot.
 . We would then be off the spot.  We
 would then show the world that we seek
 a cease-fire order to be enforced by the
 United Nations.
 Oh, I know that when we make state-
 ments of this kind, somehow, in some
 way, we are said to be aiding the enemy.
 We are supposed to be, somehow, in some
 way, letting down our boys in southeast
 Asia.  I get lost in that jungle of fallacy.
 The truth is that those who want to
 follow the United States course of action
 now being followed in southeast Asia are
 the ones who are letting down our boys.
 Those of us who are seeking to try to
 stop the killing there are the ones who
 think it is our clear duty to insist on every
 possible procedure and avenue available
 to bring about the enforcibility of peace
 and the stopping of the making of war
 in southeast Asia.
 I repeat again, and I want it in the
 RECORD, before we start the debate next
 Monday, that if France or Russia or any
 nonpermanent member of the Security
 Council vetoed the proposal for Security
 Council intervention in southeast Asia,
 we should then proceed to the next pro-
 cedure provided for by the charter.
 As I have been heard to say before, and
 as I said as recently as last night in St.
 Louis, I want my President to go to New
 York City-it is much more important

 want him to plead our desires for peace
 before an extraordinary session of the
 General Assembly of the United Nations.
 I want him to make a plea to the world,
 in which plea he will announce that the
 United States will cooperate in the en-
 forcement of a ceasefire order by the
 noncombatant members of the General
 Assembly of the United Nations on con-
 dition that they will agree to carry out
 their obligations clearly called for by the
 charter to send to southeast Asia what-
 ever divisions of troops are necessary to
 separate the combatants and enforce the
 peace. The United Nations should make
 clear to both sides in the war that the
 shooting must stop and the war must
 stop.  It must make clear that if either
 side fires upon the United Nations forces
 then and only then will United Nations
 forces Are back for further enforcement
 of the peace sought through a ceasefire
 order.
 This will require, of course, the divid-
 ing of Vietnam probably into a number
 of buffer zones to be occupied by United
 Nations peacekeeping forces.
 I happen to think that if there were a
 large number of nations that would get
 behind such a peacekeeping movement,
 all parties, including Red China, would
 think a long time before they would aline
 themselves against the overwhelming
 majority of the nations of the world.
 Mr. President, it takes big statesman-
 ship to carry out such an ideal.  The
 world is entitled to look to our Presi-
 dent for that statesmanship.  That is
 why, Mr. President, you find me sup-
 porting the so-called enclave approach
 as the best approach for a desolution of
 the war.  This administration is trying
 to misrepresent the enclave approach.
 The enclave approach is not a plan for
 us to run and get out.  Nobody has sug-
 gested that.                  I have said we could not do
 that.  I opposed our going into the war.
 But once in there, we have created a sit-
 uation under which we cannot pull out.
 If we did we would probably start the
 bloodiest massacre and biggest human
 blood bath in the history of mankind.
 Whichever one of the two Vietnamese
 forces were predominant would kill the
 other and we would have to assume at
 least some moral responsibility for that
 occurrence.
 So I am not asking that we pull out,
 but I am asking that we hold, as General
 Gavin has advocated, as Mr. Kennan has
 advocated.  I intepret General Ridge-
 way's letter to the chairman of the For-
 eign Relations Committee [Mr. FUL-
 BRIGHT], as being opposed to our escalat-
 ing the war.  We need a lull in hostili-
 ties until the other nations of the world
 become involved, not in war, but in
 bringing about a constructive peace.  It
 is at least an avenue toward peace we
 have not traveled yet.  It is one the
 President has the responsibility to travel
 before he proceeds to carry out the ar-
 bitrary, discretionary power which this
 Congress voted him last week-and in my
 judgment mistakenly and ill-advisedly-
 in the authorization bill to send 425,000-
 plus American boys to fight, and thous-
 ands of them to the in a war in southeast
 Asia.
 As I have said before, he cannot justify
 sending thousands of boys into battle
 without a declaration of war.
 I will not repeat today the many rea-
 sons I have given why I think this ad-
 ministration does not want to declare
 war, except to mention the main one.  A
 declaration of war on our part would put
 us in great difficulty with many of our
 allies if we tried to enforce the declara-
 tion.  We would find countries that we
 now consider to be allies would not re-
 spect our blockades, would not respect
 our mining of ports, and would not lower
 their flags to such war policies of ours.
 The first one of their ships that we sank,
 we would find ourselves in great inter-
 national trouble with them.  If one of
 those ships happened to be a Communist
 ship of the Soviet Union, we would then
 be at war with Russia, and also, in my
 judgment, with China if China sent her
 minesweepers into the Haiphong Harbor,
 as she undoubtedly would do, to sweep
 out any mines we might lay.
 The trouble is, in these hours of war
 hysteria that are spreading across this
 country, and in which this administra-
 tion, by its misinformation and propa-
 ganda pouring into American public
 opinion, the American public does not
 know the facts in respect to what the
 course of action of this administration
 is going to lead then into if the people
 do not stop this administration.
 I am afraid that the only check that
 really is left is the American people, un-
 less Congress wants to stop abdicating
 its constitutional responsibilities.  We
 are headed for an enlarged war unless
 Congress wants to carry out the trust the
 Constitution bestows on its Members to
 check its President, in an executive war,
 an illegal war, and in an undeclared war.
 Unless Congress is willing to carry out its
 responsibilities, I say to the American
 people again, "You are going to have to
 do it, you are going to have to do it with
 your ballots, and you are going to have
 to start in the primaries just ahead, in
 the election next fall, in the primaries in
 1968, and in the election in 1968."
 Let me say, as a Democrat, that this
 issue is so far above partisanship that
 this Senator will never put his party first,
 because what I am pleading for is, in my
 judgment, the only course of action that
 will truly put my country first.
 I am interested in my country follow-
 ing a course of action that will at least
 cause it to retrace its steps from the
 shocking course of action of immorality
 and illegality that we have been following
 since 1954 when we started violating the
 Geneva, accords section by section.
 Mr. President, there is growing interest
 in this country as to what the adminis-
 tration is leading us to domestically. We
 just had a colloquy between the Senator
 from Colorado and the Senator from
 Oregon in regard to what the adminis-
 tration is doing on the domestic level in
 the field of education.
 That is only one segment of our econ-
 omy in which this administration is going
 to cut, cut, and cut in the name of sup-
 plying more, more, and more funds for
 its illegal and immoral war in southeast
 Asia.
 But it is not willing to cut in connec-
 tion with other foreign programs.  We
 had a little taste of that the other day
 when we had a supplemental budget of
 $415 million for more foreign aid into
 southeast Asia and the Dominican Re-
 public, and other areas listed in that bill.
 The senior Senator from Oregon asked
 for a saving of at least that amount out
 of foreign aid elsewhere in the world.
 This administration not only would not
 go along with that proposal of the Sena-
 tor from Oregon, but this administration
 has already sent up a budget message
 that increases its foreign aid in other
 parts of the world.
 I wish to say to the American people:
 "Only you can stop it. Only you, by the
 exercise of your rights as free men and
 women, through the ballot box can stop
 this administration from that course of
 action."
 I want to say that any aid that we have
 to give to this war torn area of the world
 in southeast Asia must be saved out of
 aid going into other parts of the world.
 It must not be saved in the cost of ade-
 quate support of what is known as the
 Great Society program, which I enthu-
 siastically support.
 I urge it for another reason.  If this
 administration thinks there is domestic
 tranquillity at the grassroots of America,
 it could not be more wrong. The main-
 tenance of tranquility and security here
 at home is going to be dependent on our
 meeting the domestic needs here at
 home. We have made great progress in
 the field of civil rights but it is only
 the beginning. There is trouble brewing
 in America in the field of civil rights.
 Part of that trouble is brewing because
 to date there has not been carried out
 to the degree that, in my judgment, the
 people of this country have had a right
 to expect of this administration, the pro-
 visions of civil rights legislation already
 passed.
 In my opinion this administration had
 better take a long, hard look at the grass
 roots of America and the evidences of
 growing dissension and trouble within
 our own country in respect to the failure
 of this administration to proceed as it
 should proceed in solving our domestic
 ills.
 There is a much greater need for a
 domestic aid program than a foreign
 aid program at the present time.
 I mentioned the other day, and I wish
 to make it a part of this speech, that cer-
 tainly I am for milk for little boys and
 girls in impoverished areas and the back-
 ward areas of the world.  It has been
 labeled for a long time, "Milk for Hot-
 tentots." I support it. We should con-
 tinue it. But we should not discontinue
 the milk for thousands upon thousands
 of impoverished little boys and girls in
 this country. And yet, this budget mes-
 sage contains a cut in the school milk
 program.  I do not understand it.
 I do not know what is happening to us
 in regard to our obligations to a social
 conscience.  I do not understand these
 cuts in the President's budget message in
 light of his proposal or proposals for
 expanding foreign aid.
 As the Senate knows, I have tried for
 several years, and I shall never give up,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE          March 17, 1966
 lation to give to exceptional children the
 special education they require.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the editorial to which I.have
 alluded be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 EXCEPTIONAL CHrLpnxN:  THE NEGLECTED
 ,LEGION
 (By WINSTON L. PRouTy, U.S. Senator from
 Vermont)
 The mission of education ought to be to
 give each child the chance to work at his
 own level and to progress as far and as fast
 as his ability to learn permits.  It follows
 that it should be the mission of this Nation
 to give the exceptional child at least the
 ordinary opportunities to learn even if this
 requires  extraordinary  measures.   To  the
 extent that America departs from this mis-
 sion, our society can be neither great nor
 good.
 In this country there are 6 million excep-
 tional children-6 million boys and girls who
 differ from the so-called average enough to
 warrant some type of special school adjust-
 ment.  Some are blind, some deaf; some have
 emotional disorders, some brain injuries; still
 others have multiple learning disabilities.
 No picket signs proclaim their cause.  No
 headlines herald their anguish.  Yet many
 cannot communicate, even to their parents,
 their sense of hopelessness, frustration, and
 confusion, because they have not learned to
 speak or write.
 Although some type of educational pro-
 gram for the deaf and blind appeared early
 in this country, only within relatively recent
 years have we recognized the special educa-
 tional needs of the mentally retarded alid the
 emotionally disturbed..
 During the 19th century our attitude to-
 ward  these  children  was  benevolent  and
 paternalistic.  Various parent, church, and
 charitable groups tried to provide some type
 of care, usually in residential institutions
 away from the community.
 The early 1900's. saw the beginning of a
 trend which recognized that the similarities
 between handicapped children and those we
 label as normal were perhaps as important
 as the differences.  Special schools and special
 classes began to emerge.  A real effort was
 made to provide exceptional children with
 enough education to enable them to become
 productive members of society, rather than
 having them spend  their  lives  in far-off
 institutions forgotten by the rest of the com-
 munity.
 It has only been within the past 25 years
 or so, however, that the public schools have
 really begun to assume responsibility forts
 educating these children, and it was not until
 1956 that Congress earmarked any aid for
 the education of the handicapped.   As a
 result, States vary greatly as to the percent-
 age of exceptional children enrolled in special
 education classes in the public schools.
 In 11 States fewer than 10 percent are
 enrolled; in 14 States, between 10 and 20 per-
 cent; 14 have between 20 and 30 percent;
 5 between 30 and 40 percent; and in only 6
 States are as many as 40 to 50 percent en-
 rolled.
 In addition, barely one exceptional child
 in four has a properly trained teacher.  These
 are  only  about  60,000  public  day school
 teachers available in the field of special edu-
 cation, and some of them are only partially
 trained.  To provide special education for all
 children who currently need it, we will re-
 quire approximately 300,000 special educa-
 tion teachers.
 We have, then, a national problem.  Does
 it not seem to you, as it does to me, that
 exceptional children have become a neg-
 lected                                                                                                                                 and  lonesome  legion  in         American
 education? Is it too much to ask that these
 6 million boys and girls be given an educa-
 tional bill of rights?
 As the ranking Republican on the Senate
 Education Subcommittee, i solicit your ad-
 vice and counsel on how this should be done.
 I also urge you to make your voices heard
 in Congress on behalf of those who cannot
 speak for themselves.
 tary junta government that some of our
 leaders praise.
 Mr. President, I am at a loss to under-
 stand why this administration is follow-
 tag the course of action that it is follow-
 ing in southeast Asia.
 I think the administration is going to
 discover that, as the American people
 come to reflect upon our course of action,
 they are going to repudiate this admin-
 istration and its course of action in
 southeast Asia. And they should. If we
 do not stop this administration from
 continuing the course of action that it is
 following, in my judgment, we will write
 a shocking, sordid chapter of American
 history that American boys and girls 100
 years from now will read and be so com-
 pletely perplexed and astounded and
 dumbfounded by as to ask the question:
 "What happened in the period of Amer-
 ican history in 1966?"
 Mr. President, again I say that I never
 ask for agreement, but for thought on
 these matters, and I am satisfied that in-
 creasing thought is taking place across
 this country. I think that, in the not too
 distant future, this administration is go-
 ing to either change its warmaking
 course of action or it is going to find it-
 self without the sympathy of the over-
 whelming majority of the American
 people.
 EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN, THE NE-
 GLECTED LEGION-EDITORIAL BY
 SENATOR PROUTY
 Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, the rank-
 ing minority member of the Education
 Subcommittee of the Senate Committee
 on Labor and Public Welfare is our very
 distinguished colleague, the junior Sen-
 ator from Vermont [Mr. PROUTY], who
 in our deliberations has been particularly
 sglicitous in drawing to our attention the
 need  for special education financial
 support.
 I was most pleased recently to learn
 that he has become an editorialist in
 this area, since I found on my desk in
 the NEA Journal of March 1966 over his
 byline a guest editorial entitled, "Excep-

 If young men of 18, 19, or 20 years of age
 are considered old enough to fight in de-
 fense of their country, for the preservation
 of its ideals, they should also be considered
 old enough to help select the leaders of
 their country who control their destiny.
 The President's Commission on Regis-
 tration and Voting Participation also
 recommends lowering the voting age. In
 a report discusssing voter apathy, this
 Commission made an important point.
 It noted that high school represents the
 last formal education that many Ameri-
 cans will ever receive. Between the time
 they graduate from high school and the
 time they can cast their first vote is a
 period of about 3 years.  During this
 time, a kind of political vacuum develops,
 and through stagnation, frustration and
 apathy, the Nation is denied a substan-
 tial number of potential lifetime voters.
 This fact is shown in statistics which
 indicate that the 21- to-30-age group
 ranks among the lowest in voting par-
 ticipation.
 By granting the right to vote to. those
 18, 19, and 20 years old, we would help
 correct this trend by permitting citizens
 to begin voting at the peak of their po-
 litical interest-an interest stimulated
 in the civics and government classes of
 high school.
 Twenty-one was established as the
 minimum voting age more than 150
 years ago by our Founding Fathers.  It
 was an arbitrary decision based on
 archaic ideas with roots in the Middle
 Ages.  Even at that time, many promi-
 nent                Americans  attained  to   great
 heights  while  still  in their teens.
 George Washington was a major in the
 Virginia Militia at 19; Alexander Ham-
 ilton was writing widely read political
 booklets before he was 15.
 And as I have pointed out, today's
 youth certainly has more opportunities
 of 1946.  I am proud to join him in co-
 sponsoring that proposal.
 The bill is the product of long, careful
 work by a group of our colleagues who
 share a concern for the limited employ-
 ment prospects of lower income groups,
 particularly the youngsters.  This meas-
 ure would give special assistance to de-
 veloping career positions in the subpro-
 fessional category of jobs.  It would also
 stimulate social services which would not
 otherwise be available.
 I commend my colleague from New
 York and those who participated in this
 study under his chairmanship.  If en-
 acted, this proposal could do much to al-
 leviate grinding poverty and, at the same
 time, bring hundreds of thousands of
 people off the, demeaning public assist-
 ance rolls and permit them to achieve the
 dignity of self-support.

 Mr. ICHORD.  Mr. Speaker and Mem-

 of the majority floor leader and the mi-

 Mr. Speaker, a recent article in the
 highly respected Columbia Journalism

 been of great concern to me as a mem-

 God whose influence has spread from a
 small section of a small island to the far

 PRESS VERSUS MILITARY IN VIETNAM: A FUR-
 THER VIEW
 (NoTE.-Martin Gershen, who wrote the
 following observations, is a feature writer-
 photographer for the Newark Star-Ledger,
 on leave to study in Columbia's advanced
 international reporting program.  He cov-
 ered the war in Vietnam last summer,)
 There is a basic law of journalism which
 says that every story should have at least
 two sides.
 Yet, in too many reports involving censor-
 ship in Vietnam, the press seems to have the
 last word.
 And that word leaves the reader--or view-
 er-at home no alternatlic but to assume
 that the American war in southeast Asia
 not only is against communism, but against
 the entire U.S. Military Establishment.
 In an article, "Censorship and Cam Ne," by
 Richard Rustiri, which appeared in the fall
 1965, issue  of  the  Columbia  Journalism
 Review, the writer made some attempt at
 giving both sides of the controversy that
 continues between the press and the brass.
 But one had to read carefully and dig
 deeply to learn that the possibility exists
 that the press may be partly to blame for its
 troubles with the censors.
 Edward P. Morgan suggested this possibil-
 ity when he was quoted as saying there was
 a "passel" of young stringers in Vietnam who
 are trying to become the Ernie Pyles of, this
 war by baiting  military  officials  at  press
 briefings.
 But generally the article seemed to con-
 sist of quotations from one famous byliner
 after another who self-righteously attacked
 censorship in Vietnam and blamed the mili-
 tary for shackling the free press.
 One of the more disturbing quotations
 was reported to have been made by UPI for-
 eign news analyst Phil Newsom, who said:
 "It is doubtful * * * If the story of U.S.
 Marines burning a village near Da Nang
 ever would have come out. if newsmen had
 not seen it."
 Newsom, of course, was referring to a CBS
 television report of the burning of Cam Ne-
 a report which aroused much controversy at
 home  because  it  suggested  that  marines
 arbitrarily burn Vietnamese villages. He im-
 plied that a hard-digging U.S. press corps
 took on a hard-to-get-along-with U.S. Marine
 Corps and uncovered a terrible secret.
 If this were true, then bully for the news-
 men.
 But it wasn't true.  The fact is that it is
 doubtful if newsmen ever would have seen
 the village razed if It weren't for the U.S.
 Marines inviting them to the burning.
 I was at the Da Nang press camp when the
 Marine invitation was extended. I turned it
 down because I had a previous commitment
 to go on an air raid aboard a B-57 fighter
 bomber.  The squadron took newsmen on
 flights one day a week.
 The real reason for burning Cam We, of
 course, was that it was a Vietcong stronghold
 and William F. Buckley, Jr., who also was
 quoted In the Rustin aritcle, made this point
 clear.
 To report properly the story of the Marine
 operation at Cam Ne would have meant ex-
 plaining that villages and  their  civilian
 populations playa key role In guerrilla war-
 fare.
 This is the why of the story, which of
 course is too complicated to make a good
 lead.
 One of the major problems facing U.S.
 forces in Vietnam is being able to distinguish
 friend from foe,
 The Marines, like all the services there,
 are aware too that they must win the people
 if they are to win the war and they lean over
 backward to avoid antagonizing local popu-
 lations.
 It must have taken Marine Intelligence a
 long time to determine for certain that Cam
 We was a Vietcong stronghold.
 Then, when they decided to destroy the
 village, they invited the press to come along.
 Is it any wonder that they becam$ annoyed
 when stories of their operation depicted ma-
 rines as no better than SS troops who burned
 villages and pushed around women, children,
 and old men?
 But, even more annoying to military men
 in Vietnam is the caliber of many of the
 correspondents out there.
 A ranking Pentagon officer observed re-
 cently that editors told him they were having
 difficulty  getting  good  newsmen  to cover
 Vietnam.
 The problem. he said, was money.  It costs
 about $1,300 round trip to fly a newsman to
 the other end of the world and for that
 amount of cash you would expect him to stay
 for a while.
 But if he Is an experienced newsman he
 has a wife and family so the news service
 would have to bring them along and settle
 them in Hong Kong or Bangkok.
 Add periodic trips for the newsman to his
 family, additional life and accident insur-
 ance, education expenses for the kids and war
 becomes an unprofitable news story.
 As  a result,  the  Pentagon  officer  said,
 "American news services are hiring people
 out there they would never touch at home."
 It's obviously cheaper to pick up a passel
 of young stringers who have already paid
 -their way to Vietnam and who will work for
 peanuts.
 In an effort to encourage the U.S. press to
 cover the war in Vietnam, the Defense De-
 partment last year flew 84 newsmen to south-
 east Asia.
 "We did it, frankly, to prime the pump,"
 the Pentagon officer said.
 The military believed that by encouraging
 more newsmen to come to Vietnam, compe-
 tition would become keener, resulting in less
 sensational stories and in more straight re-
 porting.
 The project was discontinued last summer
 as escalation of the war began in earnest be-
 cause "we reasoned the American press was
 interested enough to pay its own way to
 Vietnam."
 It didn't work out that way.
 Of the 106 civilian news organizations from
 around the world who were represented In
 Vietnam last August, about 40 were Ameri-
 can.                                                                      Of the 260 newsmen present, approxi-
 mately 175 were American.
 Three months later, in November, the num-
 ber of news organizations in Vietnam had
 Increased to 136 but the proportion of U.S.
 services to the total rose less than 10 percent
 while U.S. troop strength had increased by
 the tens of thousands.
 Of the 296 accredited newsmen covering
 the war, fewer than half were Americans.
 Foreign newsmen were hired by nearly all the
 American media.  In some of the larger or-
 ganizations 20 to 60 percent of the staff was
 foreign.
 In the last 2 weeks of 1965, the number of
 U.S. services and staffers had begun to in-
 crease  slightly,  according  to  a  Pentagon
 official.
 Obviously, a certain number of foreign
 newsmen are needed on American staffs to
 overcome language barriers. The rest prob-
 ably are hired to overcome budgetary prob-
 lems.
 I remember meeting one of these non-
 American U.S. correspondents the day after
 the Cam No incident. We both were leaving
 Da Nang.  He was carrying a pouch of tele-
 5911
 vision film, which he was bringing to Saigon.
 I was returning to Pleiku.
 We were picked up at the press camp by
 two U.S. enlisted men who were ordered to
 drive us to the airfield where we were to
 catch a military flight south.
 On the way to the airfield my colleague
 began berating the two enlisted men over the
 Cam Ne operation.
 He implied that the Marines were no bet-
 ter than the Gestapo.
 "Imagine you Yanks burning a village.
 'I never saw anything like that in my life,"
 said this correspondent, who obviously was
 too young ever to have covered a war before.
 Enlisted men are taught to treat civilians
 with respect, especially if they are from the
 press.  The two GI's looked at each other
 but said nothing.
 I tried, at first, to keep from getting in-
 volved, because we newspapermen have to
 stick together even if we're wrong.
 But his criticism continued and finally I
 said, "For Christ's sake, shut up."
 He looked at me in surprise.  Then he
 said, partly as an explanation, partly as an
 appeal to my journalistic loyalties and partly
 to get the last word in:
 "But I actually saw a Marine push an old
 man around."
 I thought of the night I had spent with a
 Marine company surrounded in a jungle out-
 post by 300 Vietcong.  I remembered the next
 morning walking down a road with a Marine
 sergeant who smiled at all the villagers he
 met because he couldn't tell the good guys
 from the bad guys and he didn't want to an-
 tagonize friendly Vietnamese.
 I thought what a crazy, mixed-up war this
 is, where you can't tell the front from the
 rear,  Vietcong  from  Vietnamese,  civilians
 from soldiers.   I turned to this young cor-
 respondent and very gently said:
 "Look, it was a Vietcong village.                 How did
 you expect the Marines to handle that situ-
 ation?"
 He hesitated for a moment, then said,
 "Why don't you Yanks get out of Vietnam?"
 And If he is typical of U.S. press repre-
 sentation  in  Vietnam,  then  the  military
 people there have been very kind to us.
 THE POVERTY PROGRAM IN SANTA
 CLARA COUNTY, CALIF.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from California [Mr. GUSSER] is
 recognized for 30 minutes.
 (Mr. GUBSER asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. GUBSER.  Mr. Speaker, as I
 pointed out to the House yesterday in
 a special order, the poverty program in
 Santa Clara County, part of which I
 am privileged to represent, is in danger
 of ending in dismal failure, due to the
 fact that it has been infiltrated by left-
 wing extremist groups.
 As a result of this infiltration, re-
 sponsible, substantial, and capable citi-
 zens, without whom the poverty pro-
 gram cannot possibly succeed, are leav-
 ing the program. in frustration and in
 disgust.
 In an effort to do something to as-
 sure that the worthwhile objectives of
 the poverty program can be achieved
 and save it from failure in Santa Clara
 County, I asked the Director of the Office
 of Economic Opportunity, Mr. Sargent
 Shriver,   on  last   Wednesday,   to
 thoroughly investigate the program in

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE           March 17, 1966
 Santa Clara County. As yet I have not
 received a reply from Mr. Shriver.
 I would point out that the criticism
 leveled at the poverty program in Santa
 Clara County has not diminished, while
 Mr. Shriver has been considering my re-
 quest for a thorough, complete, im-
 partial, and unbiased investigation of
 the program.
 Yesterday .I read into the RECORD all
 article by Mr. Harry Farrell, the distin-
 guished political reporter for the San
 Jose Mercury and News, which was the
 first of a four-part series.  Today, as
 further evidence in the continuing expose
 of a left-wing and right-wing infiltration
 into the poverty program in Santa Clara
 County, I would like to read the second of
 that series into the RECORD. I quote
 from the article which appeared in this
 morning's San Jose Mercury in San Jose,
 Calif.:
 The doorbell rang on February 23 at the
 Sigma P1 house, in the "fraternity row" dis-
 trict east of San Jose State College, and was
 answered by one of the brothers, 19-year-old
 Garth Steen.
 Thereupon began one of the wackiest epi-
 sodes in the whole Alice-in-Wonderland ex-
 istence of the Santa Clara County Economic
 Opportunity Commission.
 The caller was a war-on-poverty canvasser,
 assigned to go door to door, turning out the
 poor for a meeting that night at EOC head-
 quarters.
 Fraternity man Steen estimates that the
 annual income of his family, in the Central
 Valley, is probably in the five-figure range.
 But since he himself is a college kid not reg-
 ularly employed, his personal income last
 year was only around $800.  That made him
 poor in the eyes of the EOC.
 It is one thing for San Jose State College
 students to receive poverty war work study
 jobs, to help them work their way through
 college.  It is quite another thing for these
 youngsters-including  undergraduates  not
 yet old enough to vote-to be voted onto the
 boards which actually call the shots for the
 EOC.
 Yet that is what is happening and the rad-
 ical fringes of the San Jose State College
 student body are moving into the program
 like gangbusters.
 Because Steen had heard a lot about the
 war on poverty and had some questions
 about it, he decided to attend the meeting to
 which the canvasser invited him.
 When  he showed up that evening,  it
 turned out that the business at hand was
 to elect the representatives, delegates and
 alternates for the EOC in two subareas in
 East San Jose's area 4.  These people would
 help run the area 4 service center, with a
 budget of about $122,000 and the stated
 purpose of coordinating all services for the
 poor within its territory.  They would also
 elect the area 4 poverty representatives on
 the countywide EOC board.
 Steen learned that his fraternity house
 residence was in subarea 13, bounded by
 East Santa Clara, 10th, William and 17th
 Streets, which had an estimated population
 of 3,975.
 According to EOC philosophy, the spokes-
 men for the poor in this subarea, embracing
 35 city, blocks, should have been chosen by
 the town meeting techniques of pure democ-
 racy.  The policy was to have the broadest
 possible participation.
 Well then, what teeming masses turned
 out for the subarea 13 election?
 They  consisted  of  exactly  three  men:
 Steen; Donald Kantor, a San Jose State
 College freshman  from  Atherton;    and
 William T. Fitzhugh of 485 South 12th
 Street.
 Since there were three EOC jobs to be
 filled-representative, delegate, and alter-
 nate-it was just a matter of dividing the
 spoils.
 Steen, who had scarcely given the local
 antipoverty war any serious thought before
 he went to the meeting, returned to the
 Sigma Pi house that night as the EOC's sub-
 area 13 representative, duly elected for a 3-
 year term.  By the time it ends, he will be
 old enough to vote.
 Kantor  became  Steen's  alternate,  and
 Fitzhugh became  the  elected  delegate to
 help choose the area 4 spokesman on the
 countywide EOC board.
 The real irony lies in the past political
 affiliations of Steen and Fitzhugh.
 Steen is a stalwart of the Young Ameri-
 cans for Freedom (YAP).  He says he is
 essentially an average Republican (or will
 be, when he's old enough), but at YAF
 headquarters, where the prevailing attitude
 is somewhere to the right of Goldwater,
 they're chuckling about how they got "their
 man" Into the EOC without even trying.
 Fitzhugh, by contrast, last year offered
 the use of his home and 'telephone to the
 "Individuals for Non-Violent Revolution."
 INVR put out an "end the draft" dodger
 about the time of the Vietnam Day demon-
 strations in Berkeley, assailing the Selective
 Service Act as a violation of the constitu-
 tional ban on slavery and involuntary servi-
 tude.  The dodger bore the same address
 and telephone number now listed for Fitz-
 hugh in EOC records: 485 South 12th Street,
 295-3407.
 "Bill Fitzhugh" also appears as a signer
 of the "Support Stanton on Vietnam" ad
 that ran last year when Assemblyman Wil-
 liam F. Stanton's opposition to the war was
 a flaming issue. The advertisement, as men-
 tioned Wednesday, was sponsored by At-
 torney John Thorne, who was active in con-
 cert with Fred Hirsch in the maneuvering
 that ousted former EOC Director Arthur
 Potts.  Hirsch's wife, Virginia, works in the
 Thorne-Stanton law office, incidentally.
 If the EOC election in subarea 13 was a
 farce, the one for subarea 9, just to the
 west, appears to have been-in the famous
 phrase of Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty-
 "stacked, rigged, wired, and packed."
 About a dozen persons showed up for the
 subarea 9 meeting, held concurrently with
 the subarea 13 election.  Most of them were
 recognized as the inner circle of campus
 radicals at San Jose State: the "friends of.
 SNICK," the  antidraft  "Students  for  a
 Democratic  Society    (SDS),"  the  bearded
 beatnik types.
 Steen asked some of these SNICK peo-
 ple if they knew Hirsch, who by this time
 was popping up everywhere in EOC affairs,
 and they said, "Sure, he's working with us
 all the time."
 One of those who turned out for the
 subarea 9 election was John Hansen, men-
 tioned Wednesday as the literary editor of
 the leftwing "New Student," and admitted
 destroyer of civil defense shelter signs.
 The outcome of the subarea 9  election
 was predictable: The college leftists took
 over.
 Elected to the 3-year term as representa-
 tive was goateed Raymond Ashley, who was
 one          of  the recent antinapalm demonstra-
 tors against United. Technology Corp.  The
 chosen delegate was Tom Linebarger, well
 known campus leftist.
 Ashley's alternate for subarea 9 is Irene
 Clark, a graduate student at San Jose State
 College.
 Thus Ashley, Miss Clark, and Linebarger
 constitute the EOC representation of the
 poor for an area of about 50 city blocks, with
 a population of 4,916.
 Since these Spartan students were elected
 to represent the poor in the poverty war, the
 students, as such, were theoretically without
 representation.  So it was decided that the
 area 4 board should have a student at largo
 too.  He is Armando Velez.
 But there was still another opening for a
 representative at large on the board, and this
 also was snagged off by a student, Billy Bates
 Cole. Last year he was treasurer of SNICK.
 in which Hirsch is so active, and he took part
 in the antinapalm demonstration at UTC.
 Cole pops up all over in the war on poverty,
 both as board member and beneficiary.  In
 his role as a student, he has been assigned
 under the work-study program to assist the
 Mexican-American project of the community
 council at $2 an hour.
 Another San Jose State College student
 with more than one poverty war capacity is
 Lee Garrett, who served on the EO'C's area 4
 planning and work committee.  He is also
 on a work-study assignment to the Uni-
 versity of California Institute of Govern-
 mental Studies.  He was another signer of
 the "Support Stanton on Vietnam" ad.
 If the far-left establishment has scored
 some notable successes in capturing sensitive
 outposts of the antipovery war, the right-
 wing-conservative establishment has demon-
 strated the same capability.
 Last year when the EOC set about orga-
 nizing its area 6 committee to fight poverty
 in  Saratoga,  Monte  Serene,  Los  Gatos,
 Cupertino, Campbell and way points, the
 conservative element so active in that part
 of the county got busy with a telephone
 campaign.
 Insiders insist that no formal or delib-
 erate action was taken, within any orga-
 nized Republican or conservative group re-
 garding intervention in the EOC.  But as
 one source said, "it is true that friends will
 call friends," and there was at least one
 caucus among conservatives where a plan
 of action was worked opt."
 The end result of this action was that
 when the first area6 KOC council was elected
 last November 22 its 18 members included at
 least 16 Republicans of varying degrees of
 conservatism.
 Among them were five members of the
 Cupertino Republican Assembly (who state-
 wide parent organization is currently run
 by the rightwing), including three of the
 group's board members:  Charles  Hinton,
 Fumio Toya and Wally Phelps.
 The conservative United Republicans of
 California (UROC) was also represented with
 at least three delegates: Vera Ladd, Bill Ellis,
 and Wendell Hammon.
 One delegate elected from the Saratoga
 area was Mrs. Diane Ravlzza, whose husband
 Eugene, was Santa Clara County cochair-
 man of the Goldwater-for-President cam-
 paign.
 Accordingly to knowledgeable sources, pos-
 sibly 2 of the 18 EOC board members chosen
 in the November 22 area 6 election were
 members of the John Birch Society. The one
 known member is Max Kernaghan, a Birch
 chapter leader.
 One other delegate, Mrs. Mary Rice, is the wife  of  a former  Bircher,  Houston  Rice,
 though she is not a member of the society
 herself.                                                There is also one delegate who has
 attended some Birch meetings but has not
 joined the society.
 For a number of reasons, the EOC refused
 to recognize the controversial board which
 included these people.  A new area 6 ad hoc
 committee was formed to get the West Valley
 program back on the track.  It is still trying.
 That concludes the second installment
 on the poverty program in Santa Clara
 County as written by columnist Harry
 Farrell for the San Jose Mercury and
 San Jose News. I read it into the RECORD
 to emphasize again the point I have been
 trying to make repeatedly in past weeks,
 namely, that this program in my con-

 als. There is no national reading service
 they could use except for the embossed
 and recorded books provided through the
 Library of Congress, but unless they are
 blind they are not at present eligible.
 There is practically no library service
 available.to the 600,000 individuals whose
 eyesight is so poor that they cannot read
 newsprint, even with glasses.  About
 4,700 persons have lost both arms or the
 use of them.  Some 8,000 persons have
 lost 411 their fingers, and 1,600 persons
 are in iron lungs or other respiratory de-
 vices which make ordinary reading diffi-
 cult or impossible. There are also about
 750,000 victims of multiple sclerosis,
 muscular  dystrophy,  cerebral  palsy,
 Parkinson's disease, and other crippling
 ailments who are so disabled that han-
 dling books, magazines, and newspapers
 is. impossible or extremely difficult.
 It is shocking-a case of sad neglect-
 that, as the law stands now, only the
 400,000 blind out of those 2 million han-
 dicapped persons are eligible to be served
 through the national books-for-the-blind
 ,program.
 Several bills to extend that service to
 the near-blind,. to quadriplegics, and to
 various other handicapped groups have
 been introduced during the 89th Con-
 gress and are now before us.  The
 amendment I propose today would ac-
 complish, I believe, the major aims of
 these bills. It would permit the Library
 of Congress to procure reading materials
 in appropriate forms, and the necessary
 machines for their use, and to distribute
 them to nonprofit agencies and organi-
 zations in the States for loan to any per-
 son so physically handicapped that he
 cannot read or use the kind of printed
 materials you and I can borrow from our
 local public library.  To prevent any
 possible abuse of the program, the
 amendment provides that this disability
 be certified by competent medical au-
 thority, just as blindness must now be
 certified.
 The amendment would also permit the
 Library of Congress to contract with
 agencies or organizations iri the States
 when services could not otherwise be
 provided. Such contracting would prob-
 ably not be necessary; however, if the
 same kind of incentives are. given the
 States to, provide library services to the
 handicapped as have been given them
 under the Library Services and Construc-
 tion Act to improve regular public library
 services, first in rural areas and then
 throughout the States.
 The bill to, extend and amend the Li-
 brary Services and Construction Act that
 has been introduced in the House of Rep-
 resentatives by Representative FoGARTY
 (H.R.  13697)  contains provision for
 "State plans for library services to the
 handicapped."   Senator LISTER  HILL'S
 bill (S. 3076), introduced in the other
 body, contains the same provision. Un-
 der such plans, States would receive
 Federal grants to help them inaugurate
 or expand such services to meet the
 needs of then million unfortunate.han-
 dicapped I have described. Although the
 blind have had service through the co-
 operating State and local libraries, those
 libraries have had to bear the entire
 cost of staff, equipment, and buildings,
 even though the books for the blind are
 free.  As a result, the service, with the
 best will in the world, has often been of
 uneven quality because there have been
 many unfilled needs for library service
 and the blind have had to compete for
 their share.  Only about 100,000 of the
 400,000 blind in'the country now benefit
 from the program. In Texas, for exam-
 ple, the number of blind using the pro-
 gram increased 30 percent last year, but,
 even so, this represents use by only 16
 percent of the estimated 30,500 blind in
 my State.  More of the blind through-
 out the country would like to have this
 library service and those who now have
 it need more reading materials and bet-
 ter service.                                                      Passage of Representative
 FOGARTY'S  and  Senator  HILL'S  bills
 would, upon approval of State plans,
 obligate the States to step up their li-
 brary services to the handicapped in
 general and would earmark for this cer-
 tain supporting Federal funds.
 This provision in Representative Fo-
 GARTY'S and Senator HILL'S bills make
 introduction of my amendment particu-
 larly timely, and even necessary, because
 the reading materials for the handi-
 capped  would  largely  be  furnished
 through the Library of Congress. But,
 whether or not this provision becomes a
 part of the Library Services and Con-
 struction Act, and I hope it does, I believe
 that the act governing the Library's
 books-for-the-blind program should be
 amended to make it possible for the Li-
 brary to furnish reading materials and
 machines to the States for the use of the
 physically handicapped who cannot use
 conventional  books,  magazines,  and
 newspapers.
 In'our concern for improving the wel-
 fare and education of all our citizens, we
 must not neglect the needs of these
 handicapped to whom the information,

 ASIA ONLY ONE WILL BRING PER-

 (Mr. PEPPER (at the request of Mr.
 EDMONDSON) was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. PEPPER. Mr. Speaker, one of the
 distinguished citizens of Florida who has
 been a long time and eminent leader of
 the United Nations Association and a
 strong supporter of the United Nations
 Is Col. Frank M. Dunbaugh.  Colonel
 Dunbaugh is a man of broad knowledge
 of and deep interest in international af-
 fairs. He is a student of the world and
 has traveled extensively abroad, recently
 in Asia. Colonel' Dunbaugh on January
 31 delivered an able address to the Mi-
 ami-Coral Gables United Nations Asso-
 ciation. I believe that address deserves
 the thoughtful consideration of my col-
 leagues and of all those who read this
 RECORD.  I, therefore, place Colonel Dun- .
 baugh's address immediately after 'my
 remarks :
 Or THREE POSSIBLE ENDINGS TO PRESENT,WAR
 IN SOUTHEAST ASIA ONLY ONE WILL BRING
 PERMANENT PEACE
 (Speech to Miami-Coral Gables United Na-
 tions  Association  by Frank  Dunbaugh,
 Jan. 31, 1966)
 Now that immediate peace through ne-
 gotiation appears to be eluding us, the war
 in Vietnam  offers three  possible endings.
 Of these only one will bring permanent
 peace to southeast Asia.
 The total population of this turbulent
 area exceeds those of the United States and
 Canada combined.
 On a recent trip I found Filipinos ready
 to fight Malaysia and Indonesia over Borneo
 but fearing an attack from Red China be-
 cause of our using bases in the Philippines
 to bomb North Vietnam.  Cambodia is on
 the brink of war with South Vietnam and
 the United States because of border infrac-
 tions  by both sides.   Despite  impressive
 U.S. military support Thailand is plagued
 by infiltrations and revolutions in its north-
 ern provinces.   Laos  is already a battle-
 ground.   Riot       and revolution drove  our
 party out of Indonesia.  We found the air-
 port,in Rangoon jammed with Indians being
 driven out of Burma by the pro-Communist
 government. Many Burmese and Indonesian
 families are quitting southeast Asia in fear
 of turmoil and terror.
 With disorder and unrest spreading from
 Bali to Burma a U.S. military victory in
 South Vietnam may prove to be only a
 pause.
 What shall we in the United States do
 in this situation?
 Roughly stated, we have three choices :
 SOLUTION NO. 1
 We can decide that southeast Asia is not
 our affair.  Its problems are too complex,
 too far away.   Orientals do not think as
 we do.  Pull out of Vietnam.  Pull out of
 southeast Asia.                                Leave them to handle their
 own affairs.
 Suppose we follow solution No. 1 which
 has great appeal for many of us," what will
 happen?  Our President's advisers believe
 that Red China will get . its clutches on
 all of Indochina.  Then Mao will grab India
 to. the west, the Philippines, Indonesia and
 even Australia to the southeast.  Thus Com-
 munist China will blow itself up into an
 unbeatable  empire,  the most     gigantic  in
 all history, an octopus holding more than
 half the world's population in its tentacles.
 I am not in accord.
 Communism will gain ground throughout
 Asia of course, but I do not believe that
 the peoples of southeast Asia, after throw-
 ing out the Japs, then the French, then
 the Americans will submit slavishly to domi-
 nation by the Chinese, whom most of them
 loathe.   One Vietcong leader  said to  an
 American war correspondent, "If the Chinese
 try to take us over we shall fight them just as
 we are fighting you now."

 HOUSE PROBERS CITE RISKS-DRve TEST GAPS
 CHARGED TO FDA
 ,(By Leslie H. Whitten)
 WASHINGTON,     March  9.-House  investi-
 gators called on the Food and Drug Admin-
 istration today to explain why two contro-
 versial drugs-one an oral contraceptive-
 were tested on humans before animal tests
 were completed.
 In both cases, serious side effects on the
 animals were reported: Breast cancer with
 the contraceptive MK-665 and eye damage
 with the much bally-hooed drug DMSO. No
 human cancer has turned ug; but three
 humans reportedly died after DMSO was ad-
 ministered to them.
 The hearings today were before the In-
 tergovernmental  Relations  Subcommittee,
 headed by Representative L. H. FOUNTAIN,
 Democrat, of North Carolina.
 On the carpet were FDA Commissioner Dr.
 James L. Goddard; FDA Medical Director
 Joseph F. Sadusk; and Dr. Frances O. Kelsey,
 investigational drug chief who kept the baby
 deforming drug thalidomide off the American
 market.
 Dr. Goddard, who succeeded the much-
 criticized George P. Larrick only a month
 ago, had new proposals ready for the commit-
 tee today to protect humans from potentially
 dangerous experimental drugs.
 They would tighten up FDA regulations to
 make sure thorough animal testing was com-
 pleted before humans were used as guin:
 -pigs for new and experimental drugs.
 The committee,  in preliminary probes,
 showed little or no basis for the general pub-
 lic belief that dogs, rabbits, pigs, and other
 animals are always studied for new drug
 reactions before humans get the drugs.
 The committee probers developed for the
 2 days of current hearings these facts, many
 of them already made public by the FDA.
 The MK-665 contraceptive was given to 30
 dogs in ddses 26 to 40 times bigger than
 human dosages by weight.  After 27 weeks,

 WORLD FOOD SHORTAGE   .
 -(Mr. OLSEN of Montana (at the re-
 quest of Mr. EDMONDSON)  was granted
 permission to extend his remarks at this,
 point in the RECORD and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. OLSEN of Montana. Mr. Speaker,
 in the years before World War II, Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America supplied the
 Industrial countries of the Northern
 Hemisphere with about 11 million tons
 of food products a year. Today, the in-
 dustrial north supplies the underde-
 veloped southern part of the world with
 more than 25 million tons of grains
 annually.
 This complete reversal of Interna-
 tional trade in food products underlines
 a fundamental fact in the world today.
 That fact is, that the poor nations of the
 world are getting poorer in their ability
 to feed themselves.
 Today, the only significant exporter
 of grains other than the United States
 and Canada, are Australia andNew Zea-
 land, and these two countries are farm-
 ing at near capacity.  The conclusion is
 that the North American farms have
 become the world's last granary.
 This has ominous forbodings for the
 undeveloped countries of the world, and
 the leaders of these areas are painfully
 aware of the impending food shortage
 which they face.
 But even for America, the world's food
 shortage has a great meaning, for the
 test of a nation's power in the years to
 come may be determined as much by its
 capacity to produce food, as by its abil-
 ity to manufacture arms.  The United
 States has been called a great power be-
 cause  of its vast industrial strength.
 Yet, in many ways, the power to pro-
 duce food is just as important.
 But, Mr. Speaker, while there is a
 growing responsibility upon the North
 American farmer; there is a great dan-
 ger that our great capabilities will be not
 enough to meet the need of the future.
 The food output per capita in the last
 5 years has dropped 3 percent in Asia,
 and 7 percent in Latin America. If this
 trend continues, our farm surplus will
 be wiped out, and our productive capa-
 bilities will be severely challenged.
 In light of these facts, Mr. Speaker, I
 believe it is time to take a long, hard
 look at the restrictions we have imposed
 upon our farmers. Perhaps the time has
 come for production incentives, rather
 than production restraints. The stand-
 ard of living of the American farmer is
 our first loyalty.  But America cannot
 and will not, stand aside while the rest
 of the?world suffers In mass starvation.
 LIBRARY OF CONGRESS BOOKS-
 FOR-THE-BLIND PROGRAM
 (Mr. BURLESON (at the request of
 Mr. EDMONDSON)  was granted permis-
 sion to extend his remarks at this point
 in the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. BURLESON.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 introducing today a bill to amend title 2,
 section 135,. of the United States Code,
 which authorizes a program to provide
 reading materials for the blind of the
 United States, its territories, and posses-
 sions.                          -
 This program, which is administered
 by the Library of Congress, has been in
 existence since 1931. It reaches into and
 renders a fine service to every one of our
 States, as I know from my longtime
 experience as chairman or vice chairman
 of the Joint Committee on the Library.
 It is a highly appreciated program,
 through which books in raised charac-
 ters-chiefly in braille-and "talking
 books"-books recorded on disks or on
 magnetic tape-and the machines on
 which to play the records are procured by
 the Division for the Blind of the Library
 of Congress.
 The books are distributed through 32
 cooperating libraries designated as re-
 gional libraries. The Texas State library
 serves the blind of my State. The ma-
 chines are lent to the blind by State
 agencies for the blind.  In Texas this is
 done by the State commission for the
 blind. The materials and the machines
 are lent without charge and the books
 may be sent free through the mails, be-
 cause this is a service to the blind which
 Congress decided many years ago should
 be made possible by the Federal Govern-
 ment.
 Over the years, the act has been
 amended to cover blind children as well
 as adults and to provide additional types
 of materials, such as talking books-as
 well as books in braille, which older peo-
 ple have difficulty in learning to read-
 musical scores, and instructional texts.
 There is nothing wrong with this serv-
 ice as far as it goes-quite the contrary-
 but Members of Congress have been hear-
 ing from many sources that it does not
 go far enough.  Under the present act,
 not even the near blind are eligible to use
 materials produced for the books-for-
 the-blind program; and other handi-
 capped persons who, for a variety of rea-
 sons, cannot read or use conventional
 printed materials unfortunately are also
 excluded.
 According to figures obtained from the
 National Center for Health Statistics
 and various national foundations con-
 cerned, there are about 2 million per-
 sons in this country who cannot read
 ordinary printed books, magazines, and
 newspapers because of impaired eyesight
 or other physical factors which make
 them unable to manipulate such materi-

 With the onslaught of the great depres-'
 sion in the thirties, a few States resumed
 minimum wage legislation. In 1937, the Su-
 preme  Court-recognizing  urgent     needs
 voiced mostly by organized labor-upheld
 the constitutionality of such laws for mil-
 lions of women who had begun to join their
 husbands in the depression drudgery of win-
 ning bread.
 The crowning achievement, promoted by a
 dedicated labor movement, was the estab-
 lishment of a Federal minimum wage in the
 Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  By the
 time of the Korean war, nearly all States that
 lacked them had enacted minimum wage
 laws to supplement the Federal standard.

 An indomitable race, the. Irish have.

 Today there are those who would erase
 this painful progress with a split minimum
 wage-one for adults and a subminimum for
 youngsters.
 Aside from discriminating against youth,
 which already has enough handicap in the
 labor market, subminimum pay for teen-
 agers eventually would destroy the concept
 of a minimum wage for all workers.  It also
 would revive a new national scandal of
 child labor exploitation.
 Employers who now cry that youngsters
 aren't worth $1.25 an hour yould-with the
 enactment of a subminimum for teenagers
 in public service programs-suddenly dis-
 cover that youth had all kinds of attractive
 work qualities.
 Splitting the minimum wage, as unfeeling
 eggheads recommend, is a medieval solu-
 tion.  Advocates of such a plan would be
 more faithful to their consci'ences if they
 recommended the policy which kings de-
 creed after the black death ravaged Europe
 600 years ago:  Fix a maximum pay stand-
 ard to prevent rise of wages above a level
 set by the employers who toadied to the
 kings.
 For whatever reason, can a Great Society
 afford to countenance subminimum wages
 for anyone?

 HON. PAUL G. ROGERS
 OF FLORIDA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 17, 1966
 Mr.  ROGERS  of  Florida.   Mr.
 Speaker, I urge that the Food and Drug
 Administration approve the use of fish
 protein concentrate for human con-
 sumption.  Approval of this concen-
 trate would give many benefits, a major
 one being the expansion of the U.S.
 fishing industry.
 The United States has now slipped to
 fifth place among fishing nations of the
 world.  It is ridiculous that this Nation
 should rank behind Peru, Japan, Red
 China, and Russia as a producer of sea-
 foods.                                                        Even more absurd is the fact
 that nearly 62 percent of the seafood
 eaten by Americans is imported from
 foreign nations.
 Each year Americans spend up to
 $600 million for imported seafood, and
 the  State  Department  has  allowed
 Soviet sales of seafoods in this country.
 In view of the increase in Cuba-based
 Russian fishing trawlers operating in
 the South Atlantic and Gulf areas near
 Florida, I just wonder whether these
 Soviet  seafoods sold in the United
 States will be taken from grounds once
 dominated by Florida fishermen?
 American fishermen now take only
 5.1 percent of the total fish caught
 throughout the world.  Russia's catch
 is almost double that of this Nation.
 In addition, the U.S.S.R. is placing a
 greater national priority on its fisheries,
 while U.S. fishing is declining.
 Thus, Mr. Speaker, as a first step
 toward revitalization of the American
 fishing industry I urge the Food and
 Drug Administration to approve the
 production of fish protein concentrate,
 or fish flour.  This concentrate, which
 is produced by pulverizing the entire
 fish, sanitizing it, further reducing it to
 fine white powder, would then be used
 as an additive to human foods.  It has
 been suggested that the cereal and
 grain `industries use the additive to
 fortify their products.  Also, markets
 for such product in undeveloped na-
 tions could be quite large.
 Studies show that if only the unhar-
 vested fish caught from U.S. coastal
 waters were used for fish concentrate,
 sufficient high quality protein would be

 Mr. GUBSER.                                                                      Mr. Speaker, Project
 Vietnam, sponsored by the Agency for
 International Development, has received
 very little publicity but, in my opinion, is
 doing a fantastic job in spreading good-
 will in the villages of Vietnam.  Under
 this program American physicians leave
 their lucrative private, practices to give
 freely of their time for 8 weeks' service in
 th I hospitals of Vietnam.  They receive
 only transportation and a very small per
 diem.  In my opinion, this program is
 one of the most successful which is spon-
 sored by AID.
 Dr. M. T. Merrill, who formerly prac-
 ticed in my hometown of Gilroy, Calif.,
 and who was well known for his leader-
 ship in civic activities, is now in Vietnam
 and has been writing a series of most
 interesting letters to the Gilroy Dispatch
 which it has printed.  Dr. Merrill's ex-
 periences are typical of the unselfish
 service rendered by participating doctors
 in Project Vietnam, and I believe they
 will be of interest to Members of the
 entire House.  His letters, as reprinted
 in the Gilroy Dispatch, are presented
 herewith:
 DR. MERRILL WRITES FROM VIETNAM HOSPITAL
 Dr. Lowe left yesterday, leaving the surgery
 in this place to me.  Dr. Kett, 60-year-old
 Vietnamese surgeon, has a private practice
 in town and uses the hospital for that only.
 I'm expecting a lot of business tomorrow,
 because there's a big operation going on
 about 10 to 12 miles away tonight, wherein
 it is said that ARVN (the "friendlies"-Army
 of the Republic  of Vietnam)  are getting
 badly clobbered by the Vietcong.  The -105
 millimeter artillery at the far end of the
 bridge entering the town (about a quarter
 mile away) have been banging away tonight,
 as they do periodically, either firing at a spe-
 cific target or in H. & I. (Harassment and
 Interdiction) -also known as "just stirring
 up a rice paddy" some 10 or 15 miles away.
 I've slowed down on picture taking-didn't
 take any around the hospital until the last
 couple of days, not wanting to act like pri-
 marily a tourist-but will be hitting another
 spasm of using film now in trying to preserve
 and immortalize this dear, improbable place.
 The only really disturbing thing about the
 whole situation here is seeing the death and
 injuries, in soldiers and babies, women and
 old men, and knowing that it is deliberate,
 man-caused destruction of pulsating people.
 At least I'm thankful that so far I've seen
 no casualties caused by my countrymen.  But

 Today is Saturday, and hospital goes onto
 night status (three or four nurses on duty
 for the whole place)                 at noon.  However, I
 had to call the surgery crew back this after-
 noon, and have spent most of the day ex-
 tracting grenade or mortar fragments--a
 bullet from a woman's back and grenade
 fragments from another woman's forearm
 this morning; a %-inch grenade fragment
 from a girl's ankle joint this afternoon (she
 has others in leg knee, and thigh, which are
 still there) ; and then an old gentleman who
 was hit with a bit of some sort of metal
 fragment which went up through his but-
 tock, rectum, bladder, and some loops of
 small bowel;  I resected a piece of bowel,
 closed  the  bladder,  did  colostomy,  and
 amused the surgery crew by taping a ure-
 thral catheter (a type of catheter) in-they
 seem not to be familiar with this and don't
 have a Foley in the place.  There is a great
 problem of obtaining supplies and equip-
 ment here-this has to be done through
 Vietnamese  channels  and   then  (maybe)
 USAID  channels, and hopeless  delays are
 encountered.
 FEBRUARY 16, 1966.
 Today's was a neat experience-going to
 a  "Med  CAP"  (Medical Civil Action Pro-
 gram) trip to Tu-Thau, about 6 kilometers
 from here, in an area just outside of the
 main village in a largely refugee area.  We
 saw 260 people in a period of 2 hours in the
 morning and 2 hours after lunch-most were
 seen by the medics and I saw the ones they
 referred to me.  The trouble is, of course,
 that one can rarely make a diagnosis, and
 can give little morethan placebo treatment.
 Our concepts of medical treatment are so
 foreign to these people that after they leave
 the treatment line they will often exchange
 pills for prettier colored ones, or give some
 to a friend-and if you give more than 2
 days' supply, either they give it to the child
 all at once or the Vietcong will come in after
 we leave and confiscate it.  Our No. 2 cook
 here at the house, the week before I arrived,
 found the big bottle of chloroquine tablets,
 took them  home,  and  gave  an  unknown
 amount to her children; two died, and three
 became very ill indeed.
 But anyway, it was a delightful and frus-
 trating, hot, sweaty,  discouraging, heart-
 warming,  and  intriguing                               experience. I
 wasn't carrying any grenades, but there were
 plenty of other people around (the Popular
 Forces troops) who were, and they hurried
 us away from the place about 4:15 because
 "too many Vietcong."  The Vietcong seem
 to be a nocturnal breed.
 One can drive many of the roads (selec-
 tively) around here in the daytime, but after
 5:30 p.m. it has to be a real emergency to
 put anybody on the road outside of a mili-
 tary  operation.   The town here,  itself,  is
 well protected, but here too we are advised
 not to wander in the outskirts alone, nor
 to go out on the streets at night. Needless to
 say. I heed all warnings In my customary
 cautious fashion.)
 We have admitted 6 cases of cholera to the
 hospital (one death) in the past 2 days, and
 have obtained 2 tents and'50 cots for an out-
 side cholera ward.
 Yesterday, as an example, my activities
 Included:
 1. Removed bullet and bits of tibia from
 8-year-old boy (local anesthetic).
 2. Removed bullet from compound frac-
 ture of femur in 10-year-old boy and inserted
 Steinman pin for traction (general anes-
 thetic).
 3. Inserted Steinman pin for traction, in
 man injured in bus accident.
 4. Repaired perforated jejunum in man
 who fell out of Lambrebta (a funny little
 three-wheeled bus).
 5. Perineaa urethrotomy for removal of
 stone in an old man with urinary obstruc-
 tion..
 6. Removed inclusion cyst of palm of hand.
 7. Checked a girl with a gunshot (or gre-
 nade  fragment)  through  the  neck-no
 heroics required-doing well.
 Plus making rounds, checking some X-rays,
 and trying (with mediocre success to resus-
 citate a baby delivered by Bac Si Keit by

 but just about.  Only here 1 week and already
 brimming over with experience, enthusiasm,
 etc.
 FEBRUARY 21, 1966.
 The USOM people in Saigon have suggested
 an R. & R. (Recreation and Rehabilitation)
 trip to Vung Tau for me for next weekend.
 Vung Tau is-a beach resort town not far from
 Saigon, and is now a GI town largely, with
 bars,  girls, swimming,  girls,  bikinis,  girls,
 bars, and marines.
 I have countersuggested a trip to Kontum,
 to visit one of the other Project Vietnam
 doctors and see some of the mountain coun-
 try.                                                                           If transportation can be arranged, I
 think it will work out.   (The sad thing, of
 course, is that there are no bars, girls, swim-
 ming,  girls,  bikinis,  girls,  nor  bars-only
 marines.)  Also, and especially, I want to get
 a glimpse of the Montagnard way of life.
 The past 2 days have been a welcome
 respite.  Things slowed down Saturday, and
 Bac Si Keit was emergency surgery call, so
 yesterday  (Sunday)  I  made rounds,  and
 goofed off the rest of. the day--slept, ate,
 whittled, slept, played an hour of badminton
 with Romeo Gloriani, showered, rehydrated,
 napped, ate, whittled, then wrote some more
 in the book.
 Today for the first time I had time to
 see every patient and find some who had
 been lying about since long before I came,
 and needed attention--casts with decubitus
 ulcer, draining horrid wounds inside, etc., a
 couple of colostomies whose original prob-
 lems I can't find out except that they were
 wounded many weeks ago, operated on in
 Saigon, then sent here.  Still can't take care
 of things promptly as they should be, but
 if the Vietcong just stay slack on our prov-
 ince a few more days, we can clear house
 pretty well.  There have been a couple of
 operations within a, few kilometers of town
 last week which loaded us up with cus-
 tomers.
 We're expecting another Project Vietnam
 doctor  (surgeon)  about March 7, which is
 largely why I'll be able to get away for a
 few days.  It's such fun having the whole
 surgical show to myself that I'll probably
 be almost jealous when a surgeon comes.
 Today I took on a new advisory capacity,
 and I think U.S. Agency for International
 Development will likely open a new agency
 just to develop it further.  I saw a small boy
 flying a kite and the kite had just dipped
 down far below a tree top, so the string was
 getting caught.
 The little tad was making that age-old
 mistake of winding in, but I pointed out to
 him that he should break the string and let
 it go, allowing the kite to fall to the ground
 on the other side of the tree.   (I dare say
 this is one area of social action in which
 we are now ahead Of the Vietcong.)
 (Referring  to  a  language  class).   My
 teacher-students have reached an average
 number of about 1,4 per session. This time
 they were Ong Hong and Co Nga; he is
 North Vietnamese and she is south (as to
 the confusions resolved as we go). I'm mak-
 ing a bit of progress in Vietnamese-just
 enough to keep my interpreters, surgery
 crew, and one of the policemen behind the
 house interested in teaching me.
 And many patients and folk in the town
 get a good laugh out of it, too.  I'm getting
 to the point where I sometimes now can tell
 when the interpreter hasn't asked the pa-
 tient the question that I wanted.  One of
 the intepreters keeps trying to tell me how
 to practice medicine, and I'm trying to
 slough her off on somebody else.
 The doctor at the hospital in Can Tho said
 they had a mortality rate of about 40 per-
 cent.  We are a much higher class though we
 have had up to three patients in one bed at
 times.
 Of course, we do send out all the wounded
 soldiers and some of the more critically ill or
 wounded; but I believe we have only had
 three deaths in the hospital since I've been
 here-one baby with congenital heart disease
 (probably), one child with cholera who died
 in the emergency room, and a boy 15 years
 old who came in with three perforations of
 his ileum and temperature of 105, due to
 typhoid fever with necrosis of Peyer's patches.
 I did a bowel resection but he was too sick
 and died about 24 hours later.
 (Have done a colostomy, two bowel resec-
 tions, repaired a perforated jejunum, treated
 a knife wound of the chest with pneumo-
 thorax, a gunshot wound through the lung,
 done a perineal lithotomy, and treated many
 compound fractures and bullet and grenade
 and  mortar  wounds,  closed  a  lacerated
 trachea in one Vietcong and circumcised an-
 other, opened some very large abscesses in
 some very small children, saw a woman with
 cholera receive 13 liters of saline intravenous-
 ly in the first 232 hours and go home on the
 fourth day under her own power, treated a
 gunshot wound of the brain and another
 that nicked or contused the cervical spinal
 cord in a little girl, opened an abscess of the
 tongue, and caught three butterflies, and no
 diarrhea.)
 This hospital is really becoming more acti-
 vated since the Project Vietnam doctors have
 been coming, and especially since about mid-
 January when people began to learn that
 there was a surgeon here.
 If time permitted, and the hostilities in
 the areastayed down to a dull roar, we could
 get some bits of classes and informal train-
 ing going more than at present, and make
 quite an impact on the quality of medicine,
 because we have a generally good crew of
 competent nurses, without whom the place
 would be nothing but a flock of barns.

 (By Nat Henderson)
 One of the top newsmen in Texas has re-
 turned to Austin from Vietnam with a call
 for escalation of the war on the homefront
 in tactical support of the troops on the bat-
 tlefront.
 "We're simply not measuring up here to
 the guys that are fighting over there," Wick
 Fowler says after spending 2V2 months as a
 war correspondent in Vietnam.
 "It burns me up to see the difference-a
 serious war there and a political war here.
 "We think about losing votes-they about
 losing lives," Fowler says in a reference to
 elected officials.
 "We must concentrate more on supplies
 and equipment instead of debating on who
 started the war."
 Fowler takes a dim View of the diplomats
 and private groups within the United States
 which worry more about what France and
 certain other nations think than about the
 actual American sacrifices in Vietnam.
 "All Americans must get behind our fight-
 ers both morally and physically.
 "Why waste away Americans to try to
 please some country across the world and out
 of the war?"
 He adds, "As long as they're killing Ameri-
 cans, we've got to be more serious than pleas-
 ing another nation whose men are not being
 lost."
 Fowler predicts a long war that will affect
 more and more homes as the casualty lists
 come out week upon week.
 "When these strike closer to more families
 and their neighbors, then more people will
 .realize that every American is involved in
 this thing.  The tragedy unfortunately will
 wake them up," he says.
 "But now, we've got; a great bunch over

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. CHARLES E. CHAMBERLAIN
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, March 8, 1966
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker,
 recently an essay written by Rene G.
 Pichard and addressed "To: All Amer-
 icans" came to my attention.  Reading
 it I was immediately struck by the spe-
 cial appropriateness of its message for
 Americans of all generations but perhaps
 especially for the young. It is too easily
 passed off as a truism that Americans
 take their freedom for granted.  Mr.
 Pichard's essay gives renewed testimony
 to the very real extent to which we are
 dependent upon and indebted to those
 who were not born Americans for an
 understanding and appreciation for what
 it means to be an American.
 So it is we continue to profit from the
 observations made by Alexis de Tocque-
 ville of "Democracy in America" in the
 1830's.  So too, can each of us benefit,
 I believe, from the personal testament
 of Mr. Pichard which won him a George
 Washington Honor Medal Award from
 the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge
 and, under leave to extend my remarks
 in the RECORD, I am pleased to make
 available this prize-winning composition
 to the wider audience it deserves:
 To: ALL AMERICANS
 (By S/A Rene G. Pichard,
 U.S. Air Force)
 As a naturalized American, I have some-
 thing to say to many native Americans: You
 have no idea how lucky you are to be an
 American.  I say this because I have known
 a different way of life.
 When the Nazis occupied my native coun-
 try, I had the choice of working at the Ford
 Motor Co. near Paris or of being deported to
 Germany as a slave laborer.  I chose Ford
 and there heard about America's plenty and
 freedom.  I resolved that if I survived the
 war, I would go to America myself. My wish
 was granted; in 1945, after many difficulties,
 I arrived in New York with my country's
 delegation to the United Nations.
 What impressed me in America?  The
 warmth with which Americans of all social
 classes received me, an unknown foreigner.
 The many churches of all creeds so crowded
 on Sundays.  Complete freedom in the news-
 paper and in speech.  American law, by
 which a man is considered innocent until
 proved guilty. Factory parking lots crowded
 with workers' cars, and the comfort in which
 the workers lived.  The civic consciousness
 of so many ordinary Americans as reflected
 in charity drives, youth ogranizations, voters'
 leagues.  The encouragement given educa-
 tion-scholarships, part-time jobs for stu-
 dents, night school classes for adults.  (In
 my country, if one did not have the family
 backing to attend college in youth, a college
 education was forever ruled out.)
 After 6 months in America I felt this way:
 The real greatness of America was not in the
 multitude of cars and refrigerators that
 American technical skill turned out, but in
 the ideals of liberty and justice that spon-
 sored the wide distribution of these goods,
 and the free enjoyment of life with equal
 opportunity for all.  Certainly these ideals
 had not been achieved irr full, but Americans
 were striving hard to achieve them;  they
 were living ideals.
 Wanting to be a part of America, I found
 a way to apply for citizenship.  When the
 Korean war began, I joined the Air Force, in
 order to serve my new country in uniform. I
 am still in uniform.  The Air Force has made
 it possible for me to get an education and to
 develop myself in a way I: could never have
 done in my native land. I can never do one-
 tenth as much for America as America has
 done for me.  I have never for one moment
 regretted becoming an American.  My only
 regret is that I am not eloquent enough to
 make some native Americans realize how
 precious are the freedoms they enjoy so ef-
 fortlessly.                                                                         Our freedoms are not something
 we can take for granted.  If we are to keep
 them-and to extend them to every last one
 of our citizens, as we must in order to keep
 them-we will have to work and to make
 sacrifices.  As one of the newer citizens of
 the world's oldest democracy, I think our
 freedoms are well worth the sacrifice,
 Rural Areas Development
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. ROBERT L. F. SIKES
 OF FLORIDA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, March 8, 1966
 Mr. SIKES.  Mr. Speaker, I submit
 herewith for reprinting in the CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD a speech entitled, "Rural
 Areas Development," delivered by A. T.
 Mace, Deputy Administrator, Rural Com-
 munity Development Service, U.S. De-
 partment of Agriculture, at DeFuniak
 Springs, Fla., on March 4, 1966.
 The speech follows:
 RURAL AREAS DEVELOPMENT
 Mr. Koerber, on the part of the Depart-
 ment of Agriculture, I congratulate you.
 And I want to congratulate all of you for
 creating this opportunity to publicly recog-
 nize the initiative and drive of one of your
 citizens.
 A1560
 Whole communities that should be mov-
 ing forward, keeping .up with the national
 economic growth, often feel frustrated and
 do not know where to turn.  Through this
 public  recognition  of  Mr. Koerber, com-
 munity                                                                                                                                      leaders throughout rural America
 should recognize a little more clearly that
 answers can be found, that economic growth,
 and progress and the improvement of human
 resources can take place.
 I had the opportunity to come to Florida
 today with Congressman SIRES.  During the
 trip he expressed in many ways his pride
 in the progress the counties in this area
 were making.
 Mr. Congressman, I have visited with some
 of the people in your district and have seen
 some of these accomplishments.  You have
 a 'right to be proud of what is taking place.
 The purposes of rural areas development
 have been, and are today:
 1. To Increase the income of people liv-
 ing in rural America-per person and per
 family-and to eliminate the causes of un-
 deremployment.
 2. To expand more rapidly the job op-
 portunities by stimulating investments in
 rural America in  all the enterprises and
 services that make up a modern economy-
 factories,  stores,                                                                                                                                       recreational  enterprises,
 crafts and services of all kinds, and techni-
 cally trained and other professional people.
 3. To develop rapidly but in an orderly
 way a wide range of outdoor recreational
 opportunities on privately owned and public
 lands-recreational opportunities  to serve
 the needs of a growing population in the
 cities and towns and rural areas.
 4. To readjust land use, nationwide, to
 achieve a balance so that each acre and
 resource are used for purposes to which they
 are adapted, and to meet national needs.
 5. To preserve  and improve the family
 farm pattern of American agriculture.
 6. To provide appropriate services and ade-
 quate financial support for the protection,
 development, and management of our soil,
 water, forest, fish and wildlife, and open
 spaces.
 7. To improve existing rural community
 facilities and institutions and where needed
 to build new ones so that people in our rural
 areas are assured pure water supplies, first-
 rate schools and hospitals, adequate streets
 and roads and other services that are stand-
 ard in a modern community.
 8. To make continuous and systematic ef-
 forts to eliminate the many complex causes
 of rural poverty.
 Despite the productive triumph of the
 agricultural segment of the rural economy,
 the rural areas have not shared equally with
 the rest of the Nation in income, in job
 opportunities, and in resources for human
 development.
 The 1960 census showed median rural in-
 come at $4,381 compared with urban income
 of $6,166.
 Almost half (46 percent)  of the families
 with money incomes under $3,000 live in
 rural areas-although fewer than one-third
 of America's households are rural.
 Rural America has almost three times the
 proportion of dilapidated and substandard
 houses as urban America.
 Educational preparation of schoolteachers
 is lower in the rural areas.  A recent National
 Education Association study shows 39.2 per-
 cent of the rural teachers with no degree.
 The comparable urban figure is 10,9.
 Emergency services, including ambulances,
 are often inadequate or nonexistent in rural
 areas.
 Unsafe waste disposal and water supplies
 present health hazards in many rural com-
 munities.
 The ratio of physicians and surgeons per
 100,000 population was 178 in central cities
 of metropolitan areas and 52 in rural areas

 In the north-fighting zone-have nothing.
 It's not a problem of shipment but lack of
 distribution," Fowler says.
 "The Government could straighten out this
 if it would," he adds.
 Fowler, who traveled in Vietnam as a corre-
 spondent for the Denton Record-Chronicle,
 went into the field looking for Texans while
 carrying a German camera, Japanese film,
 and Italian typewriter.
 "Texans were everywhere, and there were
 more aggies than at a muster.  At Da Nang
 alone I found five aggies and one teasipper,"
 Fowler said in a humorous vein that has
 made his reporting popular wherever he goes.
 But the smile faded as he returned to the
 serious side of his trip to Vietnam.
 "Why do we play politics with lives?  We
 haven't lost anybody in a political campaign."
 Macon, Ga., Telegraph Selected To Re-
 ceive Georgia Education Association
 Award
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON: JOHN J. FLYNT, JR.
 Or GEORGIA.
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 17, 1966
 Mr. FLYNT. Mr. Speaker, on Wednes-
 day, March 16, 1966, the Macon, Ga.,
 Telegraph  received  the  School  Bell
 Award presented to the outstanding daily
 paper of the year by the Georgia Edu-
 cation Association for outstanding school
 news coverage.  Specifically, the award
 was made for excellence in reporting
 and/or interpreting the objectives and
 goals of education.
 It is significant that this award takes
 place when, today, almost 1,000 corre-
 spondents representing over 500 news-
 gathering' agencies are reporting from
 the House and Senate Press Galleries of
 this Capitol. These journalists are dedi-
 cated people who perform a valuable
 service to the public, to their employers,
 and to the Nation.  These are the peo-
 ple who record the events of today which
 become our country's history.
 Equally important, however, are the
 unmentioned chroniclers who constitute
 the administrative staffs of the news
 media, for it is these people who are
 responsible for putting the news into
 its proper perspective.  It is therefore
 of special significance that the Macon
 Telegraph is recognized in such a man-
 ner.
 Many man-hours and extensive per-
 sonal cooperations are involved in pro-
 ducing a newspaper. The efforts of those
 involved are usually taken for granted
 by the average American citizen who
 purchases the finished product for 10
 cents.
 Being chosen the recipient of this
 award illustrates the fine job that the
 Telegraph are doing in keeping the pub-
 lic informed of school activities, which
 are a vital part of the life of any com-
 munity.
 Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the owner-
 ship and staff of the Macon Telegraph,
 and Include In the RECORD an article
 which appeared in the daily press of
 Georgia on March 16, 1966:
 THE TELEGRAPH  SELECTED  TO  RECEIVE  GEA
 AWARD
 ATLANTA.-The Macon Telegraph has been
 selected to receive one of four School Bell
 Awards presented annually by the Georgia
 Education Association for outstanding school
 news coverage.
 Editor William A. Ott will accept the honor
 at the School Bell Awards dinner, which will
 open the 99th GEA convention in Atlanta
 Wednesday night.
 Other winners are The Swainsboro Forest
 Blade in the weekly newspaper category,
 WSB-TV of Atlanta in the television cate-
 gory, and WLFA of LaFayette in the radio
 category.
 The awards are made for excellence in rep-
 porting and/or interpreting the objectives
 and goals of education.  Nominations are
 made by members of the teaching profession.
 The Telegraph was nominated by the Bibb
 County GEA unit, which is headed by Otho
 Pirkle, principal of Jessie Rice Elementary
 School.
 The basis for the judging was a scrapbook
 prepared by Mrs. Juanita Krysalka of the
 Bibb  unit's  public,  relations  committee.
 Other committee members who worked on
 the project are Chairman Mrs. Valree Flan-
 agan, Mrs. Florence Sanders, Mrs. Jacquelin
 Harrison, and Don Edwards.
 The.GEA judges said of the scrapbook,
 "The content reflected good community sup-
 port of education, good editorializing, I and
 interest of newspaper in wide coverage.  In-
 formation about activities of individuals and
 groups as well as the total school program
 was covered."
 Receiving honorable mention will be the
 Brunswick News, Mrs. Constance Johnson of
 the Columbus Ledger, the Cordele Dispatch,
 the Warrenton Clipper, the Elberton Star,
 the DeKalb New Era, and North DeKalb
 Record.  The Fitzgerald Herald, the Hart-
 well Sun, WAIL-TV in Atlanta, WGST radio
 in Atlanta, and WSB radio in Atlanta.
 The awards will be presented by Julian A.
 Pafford of Statesboro, chairman of the GEA
 school public relations committee.
 Featured speaker for the dinner will be
 J. C. Bostain of the Foreign Service Institute,
 Department of State, Washington, D.C.
 Slovak Independence Day
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. MICHAEL A. FEIGHAN
 OF OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, March 15, 1966
 Mr. FEIGHAN.                                                   Mr. Speaker, March
 14 is an important day for Americans
 of Slovak origin.                                              It is the anniversary
 day of Slovak national independence.
 Public ceremonies marking this day will
 be held in many communities through-
 out the United States.
 Great credit must go to the people of
 Slovakia for their unbreakable attach-
 ment to liberty and their struggles for
 the right of self-government. This spirit
 prevails In Slovakia today despite for-
 eign occupation, the denial of elemen-
 tary human rights and organized pro-
 grams to destroy the ancient culture of
 her people.
 There is increasing evidence that the
 new chains of imperialism on the Slovak
 people are weakening under the popular
 pressure exerted by the people for free-
 dom of expression and self-government.
 This is a tribute to their determination
 to reject foreign occupation and to fight
 on for a restoration of their national
 independence.
 Mr. Speaker, anything we can do to en-
 courage the Slovak people in this cause
 serves the cause of peace and world free-
 dom.  Over many years responsible na-
 tional  organizations have urged  the
 Voice of America to establish a Slovak
 desk as a part of our international in-
 formation program.  I have supported
 that proposal because I am convinced the
 best way to demonstrate our friendship
 for the people of any foreign country is
 to speak to them in their own language,
 to recognize their cultural values, to en-
 courage them in their just aspirations
 for self-government.
 The Slovak people have always main-
 tained a warm friendship for the people
 of our country and a keen admiration
 for our free institutions. It is time that
 we responded more fully to evidence our
 support for their struggles to regain their
 national independence.  A Slovak desk
 in the Voice of America would provide
 comfort  and  encouragement  to  our
 friends in that unhappy land.
 I salue the Slovak people on their
 Independence Day and join with their
 many friends in our country in the hope
 that they will soon regain their rightful
 place in the community of free nations.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 14, 1966
 Mr. ULLMAN.  Mr. Speaker, amid
 the clamor to boost interest rates and
 taxes to ward off inflation, the voices of
 reason are beginning to be heard. A sub-
 stantial segment of the Nation's busi-
 ness leaders see the dangers and the pos-
 sible consequences of underestimating
 the continuing need for capital to sustain
 our economic growth.
 The ingredients for classic inflation
 are not present in our economy today.
 Administered price hikes, profiteering,
 and speculation can exact a tremendous
 toll from the American people, and they
 must be brought under control; how-
 ever, it should not be done in a way that
 slows the legitimate productive require-
 ments of our economy. These malfunc-
 tions in the economy must not be per-
 mitted to push us into deflationary poli-
 cies that are sure to bring on a recession.
 Columnists Evans and Novak have ex-
 pressed some of the concern that is felt
 in the business community over these
 proposed policies.  I recommend to my
 colleagues their column, "What Infla-
 tion?" from the Washington Post of
 March 16, 1966:

 the maximum feasible participation of the
 groups served."
 Everyone agrees that means the poor must
 be involved, but what is "maximum" and
 what is "feasible" and-in what way shall
 they "participate"?   As other articles in
 this series have shown, these questions are
 the source of bitter controversy in commu-
 nities across the Nation.
 Mayor Daley and his supporters say the
 poor are involved in Chicago's program, and
 there appears to be a good basis for the
 claim.  But his critics don't agree.
 The major opposition comes from a group
 called the Woodlawn Organization located
 in the heart of the South Side slums.  The
 Woodlawn Organization,  or TWO as it is
 called, was  established by Saul Alinsky,
 whose community action groups have worked
 to achieve progress through such tactics as
 demonstrations, rent strikes, and political
 pressure.
 CRITICS  ASSAIL  POLITICAL  CONTROL
 TWO wants a share of the Federal poverty
 money to be used to operate programs free
 of city control.  In a recent issue of its own
 publication, for instance, TWO defines "the
 great issue before this Nation now" as:
 Can public funds finance basic, root re-
 form of the social structure and values of
 America, by going to independent groups
 organizing the poor?  Or will the billions
 coming from Washington simply continue,
 with much more expensive advertising cam-
 paigns, the present state among poor Ne-
 groes of alienation and degradation?"
 To the Woodlawn leaders, the present war
 on poverty is "actually a war against the
 poor. * * * It is a war against us when
 money is used to buy off our rage against
 being confined to the ghetto.  It is a war
 when public money is used to distract black
 people from building enough power to break
 out of the ghetto."
 Stripped of its rhetoric, the complaint Is
 that the poverty program is controlled by
 the ruling political power. In Chicago that
 means the Daley Democratic organization,
 the last of the big city machines.
 Daley  unquestionably    does  control  the
 overall poverty structure. He heads the com-
 mittee that runs the poverty program.                           He
 appoints the  committee  director  who  in
 turn appoints the program center directors.
 They in turn appoint the advisory commit-
 tee members who are the representatives of
 the local communities.   They pass on all
 poverty program proposals.
 Arrayed against Daley have been militant
 local groups like TWO and, at least in the
 early days, an important segment of the
 Office of Economic Opportunity in Wash-
 ington.                          -
 "They had a group in OEO that saw the
 program as an opportunity to reform the
 world, and they were going to start with Chi-
 cago," said a city official.
 Washington wanted members of the ad-
 visory committees, who were the so-called
 representatives of the poor, to be elected
 rather than appointed.  Such an election
 will be held in Los Angeles on March 1.
 Daley countered along these lines: in vola-
 tile Chicagosuch an election would tear the
 city apart and create animosities that would
 never heal.  In addition, an election of that
 kind in Chicago, would mean only that every
 ward leader would make sure that his own
 ive  system  "guarantees,"  as  one  official
 said, "minority representation."    Debatable
 though that may be, that issue of representa-
 tion appears to have been settled months
 ago, in private confrontations between Mayor
 Daley and Sargent Shriver, the head of the
 OEO (and the former president of Chicago's
 school board as well as the manager of the
 Chicago Merchandise Mart).        -
 Today Shriver himself is as much a target
 of the militant groups here as Daley.  When
 Shriver spoke in Chicago last December, the
 Woodlawn Organization picketed his appear-
 ance. Its members marched and waved such
 signs as "The War on Poverty Is Pure Brutal-
 ity," "Your American Dream Is My Night-
 mare," and "End the War on the Poor."
 The demonstration was not without its
 cynical aspects.  One might conclude that
 TWO is not so much against the war on
 poverty as it is against not getting more
 money.
 (At present TWO operates in part on a
 $70,000 poverty grant, funded through the
 Chicago, or Daley, program, and has pending
 a $700,000 leadership proposal.)
 CITY'S PROGRAM MOVING AHEAD
 While the struggle between the ins and the
 outs continues, Chicago is proceeding with
 its multimillion-dollar program.
 When they set out to plan an antipoverty
 campaign, Chicago officials began with the
 general viewpoint that poverty stems from
 many factors, not merely lack of money or
 jobs.  Education, health, housing, environ-
 ment, recreation, cultural opportunities-all
 these are a part of the problem.
 In addition, there are special problems in
 slum areas.   As Dr. Deton J. Brooks, the
 executive director of the city's antipoverty
 organization, said in an interview:
 "Long before I took this job I was writing
 the social philosophy that people had to be
 involved in their own destinies.  You don't
 have to go far in Chicago to see that people
 are isolated.
 "One of the basic problems had been an
 erosion of social and leadership services in
 their comInunities.  When 5 o'clock comes
 in those areas, the social welfare forces leave
 and all that you have left are the forces of
 control-the police and firemen.
 "Before people can help themselves, they
 have to have a chance to get the services,
 and I mean around-the-clock services, be-
 cause a city like this never sleeps.  The prob-
 lems don't wait for a time when it's con-
 venient for us to be there."
 The solution, for Chicago, was the estab-
 lishment of urban progress' centers.  These
 are outposts in the heart of the worst pov-
 erty areas of the city which bring services to
 the people.
 CENTERS OPEN EVERY DAY
 There are seven such centers. They range
 in size from a three-story building complete
 with a gymnasium to smaller structures with
 less elaborate facilities.  Each center houses
 a number of public and private agencies.
 Among them are the county public aid de-
 partment, the city housing authority, the
 youth  welfare  commission,  the  board  of
 health, the State employment service and
 legal aid lawyers.
 The centers are open 7 days a week,
 from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Soon they will be
 open on a 24-hour basis. They provide more
 than the basic social welfare services.  Some,
 depending on needs in the specific area, are
 staffing mental health or retardation pro-
 grams.  In other, preschool and home eco-
 nomics classes are operating.   Still others
 have programs for "senior citizens."
 Each also has an office for making avail-
 able small business loans to local firms.
 What is most impressive about the cen-
 ters is the sense of action and drive.  You
 can visit any center, at any time of the day,
 and find people hard at work dealing with
 people in that community.
 The response in the areas has been grati-
 fying, if not overwhelming.  People are com-
 ing, voluntarily, off the streets to find out
 about jobs, or housing, or educational pro-
 grams, or with complaints about landlords
 or garbage collections.
 In one center, for example, 43,000 persons
 came through its.doors in exactly 1 year.
 WORKERS LIVE IN AREAS THEY SERVE
 But the most important part of the -cen-
 ter concept lies outside its physical struc-
 ture.
 Each center employs a group of commu-
 nity representatives.  Like most of the other
 employees of the center, they live in that
 area and they themselves were either unem-
 ployed or "underemployed."
 The  community representatives  spend
 their time away from the center.  Their job
 is to go from house to house finding out
 what the specific problems are.   Then they
 attempt to bring those people to the center
 where they can be served.
 These representatives are available on a
 24-hour basis.  Since they live in the neigh-
 borhoods, they have a better chance to gain
 the confidence of the residents.  The cen-
 ters now are publishing their own commu-
 nity newspapers of 4 pages with photographs
 and stories about the programs and people
 in their area.     -
 As only one of the programs, teams of rep-
 resentatives  are  collecting  urine  samples
 from children in homes in an attempt to de-
 tect and treat cases of lead poisoning. Oth-
 er groups are surveying buildings as part of
 a rat control program.  Holes and cracks are
 marked, and then covered.
 PRO AND CON ON ELECTION
 An intensive effort is thus being made to
 reach the people in most need.- A house-to-
 house survey is now underway to identify the
 people who live in poverty, and to pinpoint
 their problems.
 To some critics, such activity is only skim-
 ming the surface of the needs.  The Reverend
 Lynward Stevenson, president of the-Wood-
 lawn Organization, has said:
 "The northern power structures running
 the so-called war on poverty have dressed
 up-the system a bit, but the idea is funda-
 mentally the same: the Negroes must stay in
 the  ghetto,  because they  are not human
 beings * * *- They are like animals in a zoo
 (and now) * * * it has been decided to dress
 up the zoo a bit with poverty funds."
 Stevenson then sounds again a call for
 elected representatives of the poor.
 Deton Brooks' answer is:
 "I say you don't need a convention to kill
 rats. You may need an army, but not a con-
 vention.                                                                                                                                              As long as we stick to bread and
 butter issues that people understand, these
 critics have no impact."

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN R. HANSEN
 OF IOWA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, March 14, 1966
 Mr. HANSEN of Iowa.  Mr. Speaker, -
 the charge is frequently heard that Presi-
 dent Johnson is losing the support of
 American citizens in our fight for free-
 dom in Vietnam.  This is entirely con-
 trary to the facts. But since the charge
 is often repeated and much publicized,
 it is in the national interest for such ir-
 responsible accusations to be frequently
 and firmly refuted.
 I have seen no finer expression of the
 true feelings of most Americans about
 the -situation in Vietnam than an edi-
 torial which appeared in a recent issue of
 the Virginia Gazette.
 The Gazette is one of the oldest news-
 papers in the Nation,  having  been
 founded in 1736. It is published in Wil-

 political fruit.
 In a poverty campaign as in all its public
 acts,  Chicago  is  pragmatic  and  tough-
 minded.   It does not have time for "goo-
 goes," Chicagoese for do-gooders.  Yet of all
 the local wars on poverty this reporter has
 seen, Chicago's is the most dynamic.  It is
 also the most controversial, for this is the
 scene of a national philosophical and polit-
 ical struggle.
 Essentially, the fight in Chicago is over
 the interpretation of the Economic Oppor-
 tunity Act, the law under which the Federal
 war on poverty operates.
 Chicago-and that means Mayor Daley-
 takes the position that the act stresses local,
 not Federal, initiative.  The city wants to
 run its own program its own way.  Washing-
 ton says that even if it is not spelled out in
 the law, the Government must set the stand-
 ards and program criteria.
 The central issue is control of the program
 and that vexatious clause in the act which
 states that poverty programs must be "de-
 veloped, conducted and administered with

 their "dismay, shock, and shame at the

 Vietnam."
 The Virginia Gazette sets forth these
 facts to illustrate its'conviction that the
 people of Williamsburg are not losing
 sympathy with the cause of the valiant
 Americans fighting in Vietnam, and that
 thousands of other communities in this
 great Nation of ours feel the same way.
 That is also my conviction, and in sup-
 port of this conviction, I insert this
 splendid and patriotic editorial in the
 RECORD'
 Ilon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: We write to you not
 as a constituent but as an American,
 You have been quoted in the press quite
 frequently of late as saying that President
 Johnson is rapidly losing the support of mil-
 lions of American citizens with regard to our
 fight for freedom in Vietnam.  We have a
 growing conviction that this simply is not so,
 Here are a few local facts that feed that
 conviction.
 Some weeks ago two Williamsburg citizens,
 an Insurance agent and a barber, came into
 this office and said they were worried about
 all of the publicity being given to the draft
 card burners and bearded protestors criticiz-
 ing U.S. involvement in Vietnam.  As indi-
 vidual citizens they wanted to voice their
 wholehearted support for the American fight-
 ing man over there.  They were convinced a
 lot of other people wanted to do the same
 thing, if there were only a way.  We hatched
 the idea of a petition, a community declara-
 tion of, support for our men in Vietnam,
 which would be available for anyone and
 everyone to sign.  No big rally, no fireworks-
 just a simple declaration.  The three. of us
 composed the following:
 "A DECLARATION
 "We citizens of the cradle of democracy-
 the historic Williamsburg-Jamestown-York-
 town area-feel a special duty and privilege
 to proclam publicly our support of present
 U.S. policy in Vietnam.
 "Caring for the torch of freedom never
 has been an easy job.  Americans first lit the
 flame with determination and great personal
 sacrifices at Jamestown, added more fuel at
 Williamsburg,  and     made  it  permanently
 bright at Yorktown.    Since then despots and
 dictators  frequently  have  threatened   to
 extinguish this symbol of man's God-given
 right to liberty.  Each time Americans have
 been among the very first to go and help
 keep free'dom's flame burning.  They have
 answered this calling gown through history,
 whenever and wherever it took them-to
 such places as New Market and Gettysburg,
 San  Juan  and  Santo  Domingo,  Belleau
 Wood and the Argonne, Okinawa and Bas-
 togne,  Berlin,  and  Lebanon,  Inchon                   and
 Saigon.
 "Today we look with dismay, shock, and
 shame at the small groups of misguided and
 fightened people who critize U.S. actions in
 Vietnam. Our fighting men over there are
 -doing what has become a sacred obligation
 for all straight-thinking Americans, what so
 many forefathers did before, then-protect-
 ing the torch of freedom from those who
 would snuff it out.                '
 "We, the citizens of this community, want
 the President, the Congress and the Nation
 to know that we support 100 percent our sons,
 relatives, and friends who are fighting and
 dying in Vietnam.  They are acting in the
 finest American tradition, defending that
 precious torch so that those at home may live
 in the secure warmth of its flame.  Their
 actions will not go unremembered."
 The Williamsburg declaration was pub-
 lished  in  this  newspaper.   Copies                                                                           were
 printed up and displayed at various public
 places around the community. Signers were
 welcomed. The response was immediate.
 The mayor of the city of Williamsburg and
 the chairman of the board of supervisors of
 James City County became the first signers.
 Virtually every civic, social, and church or-
 ganization in town lent their endorsement.
 In an amazingly short time, the declaration
 collected more than 4,000 signatures.  A copy
 of the declaration, together with all of the
 signatures, is now being sent to our Virginia
 representatives in Washington.
 Last November this community received
 word that Glenn Dill Mann, a Williamsburg
 resident and graduate of the College of Wil-
 liam and Mary here, was killed while serving
 as a Marine helicopter pilot in Vietnam.
 There was an immediate upsurge of senti-
 ment to do something in his memory. In a
 single day students at the college donated 501
 pints of blood to the Red Cross in a brief sa-
 lute to this departed alumnus.  The urge for
 a more lasting tribute continued. Last month
 the idea for a Glenn D. Mann Scholarship
 Fund was born, and already students at Wil-
 liam and Mary have raised $2,300 for this
 cause.  The community at large is now rally-
 ing behind the fund, and it is certain to be-
 come a permanent memorial to Captain
 Mann.
 Last fall newspaper publicized the fact
 that many American servicemen in Vietnam
 missed  getting  enough  mail  from  home.
 Students at the public schools in Williams-
 burg and James City County, acting more or
 less on their own, responded with a letter-
 writing campaign.                                                                               Youngsters In all grades
 began writing hundreds of letters (no one
 can know the exact count)  to servicemen
 they did not know.
 One Army sergeant wrote back to an ele-
 mentary school child in December and men-
 tioned that he knew a lot of South Viet-
 namese children, tragic victims of the war,
 were not going to have a very happy Christ-
 mas.  The letter was published in this news-
 paper.  Again the response was immediate.
 Williamsburg school children donated sev-
 eral truckloads of toys, clothes, etc., which
 were sent to Vietnamese orphans.
 We mention these local facts, Senator not,
 to bring undue credit to our community, but
 merely to illustrate that there are citizens
 here who are not losing sympathy with the
 cause of valiant Americans fighting in Viet-
 nam.   We  are  personally  convinced  that
 thousands of other communities in this great
 Nation of ours feel the same way.
 But you, apparently, think otherwise. As
 a U.S. Senator you must travel to a lot of
 places to get your information. One thing
 is for sure.  You haven't come to Williams-
 burg lately.                                                                            Maybe you should.
 Very sincerely yours,

 The Economic Development of Puerto Rico
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 17, 1966
 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, the story of
 economic development. in Puerto Rico is
 one of the great success stories of this
 decade. It is a tale of which' that island
 can well be proud; and the citizens of
 the United States, who have helped to
 make that progress passible, can share in
 her pride.
 In a speech in Washington on February
 24, 1965, the Honorable SANTIAGO Po-
 LANCO-ABREU, Resident Commissioner of
 Puerto Rico, compresses the island's his-
 tory into a very few, eloquent para-
 graphs. Our colleague notes in his con-
 clusion:
 In the 5 years since Castro has ruled rich
 Cuba, its per, capita income has declined by
 15  percent.   During  these  same 5  years,
 Puerto Rico's per capita income has risen by
 more than 50 percent.  I can think of few
 statistics which are more sobering.
 The progress of Puerto Rico is indeed
 sobering.  It is also heartening.        Our
 distinguished colleague, Mr. POLANCO-
 ABREU, has told it well. The text of his
 speech follows:
 THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF PUERTO RICO
 (By SANTIAGO POLANCO-ABREU)
 There is probably no group in the world
 which is more dedicated to the,goal of eco-
 nomic development of less wealthy nations
 than the membership of this society. .I feel
 very much at home with men who are per-
 sonally and professionally wrapped up in
 the vast problems of. the two-thirds of the
 world who still live In great poverty.
 Certainly all of us are perturbed by the
 enormous gulf which separates the "have"
 from the "have nots" nations, and even more
 perturbed by the fact that this gulf seems
 to be growing, rather than diminishing.
 Happily, there have been some noteworthy
 exceptions to this trend of the rich getting
 richer, while the poor get poorer or barely
 hold  their  own.   The  rates  of  economic
 growth in Japan, Israel, and Puerto Rico,
 for example, are now much higher than the
 ,growth rates of more highly developed coun-
 tries.                                                                                                                              In contrast with most underdeveloped
 countries, moreover, their growth has been
 nothing short of spectacular.  Today, Japan,
 Israel, and Puerto Rico are on the other side
 of the fence, sending their technicians and
 providing technical assistance to their less
 fortunate neighbors.
 Recognizing that Puerto Rico is no more
 a typical case than Japan or Israel, It is
 nevertheless worthwhile.  I believe, to under-
 stand something of its economic development
 history in order to see more clearly some
 of the problems characteristic of underdevel-
 oped countries and some of the solutions that
 have proved workable  in Puerto  Rico.
 In 1898, when Puerto Rico was ceded by
 Spain to the United States, the island was
 indeed underdeveloped. Most people lived
 in poverty on small subsistence farms.  Fam-
 ilies were large and few children could be
 educated.   Coffee was the only important
 export,  and the total volume  of overseas
 trade was small, indeed. The beginning of
 a modernized Puerto Rican economy was the
 development of sugar  as a major  export
 industry.
 Growth of the sugar industry provided a
 necessary base for the more diversified eco-
 nomic development that was to come much
 later.  The method of its development, how-
 ever, was most damaging to the people of
 Puerto Rico.   The  sugar industry, largely
 owned by U.S. interests, took out from Puerto
 Rico far more In profits than the amount
 it invested or reinvested.
 The depression of the 1930's hit Puerto
 Rico with great severity.  Sugar and coffee
 prices  tumbled  to  ruinous  levels.  Many
 coffee plantations, which had been severely
 damaged by hurricanes in 1928 and 1932,
 were not replanted.  Everywhere there was
 deep social and political unrest.  Puerto Rico
 was on the brink of revolution. Federal relief
