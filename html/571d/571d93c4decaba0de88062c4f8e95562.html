 Laotian officials appear           receptive to the US pro-
 posal for a neutral nations commission--made up of Burma,
 Cambodia, and Malaya.  General Phoumi has announced his
 readiness to visit Phnom Penh in what is likely to be a
 fruitless effort to persuade Souvanna Phouma to return
 to Vientiane.   There has been little change over the
 week in the military situation.   In recent private talks
 with Western officials, Soviet Foreign Ministry representa-
 tives have indicated that Moscow's reply to the British
 proposal of 21 January regarding reactivation of the
 International Control Commission (ICC) will probably
 point out that any such commission must be preceded by
 an international conference to restore peace in Laos.
 Peiping has taken this position publicly.  The bloc
 airlift into Laos continued  throughout the week.

 Soviet technicians are en route to Havana to design
 the first two industrial projects to be built under the
 Soviet credit to Cuba, and steps are being taken to
 implement other bloc agreements.   Castro's assertion
 in a 12 February speech that Cuba has the "right to en-
 courage revolution in Latin America" probably reflects
 his intention to increase propaganda and clandestine
 activities in the area.  Nicaragua and Honduras are
 still in disagreement over how to proceed in implement-
 ing the recent arbitral award of a long-disputed area
 to Honduras, and public feeling on the issue is  high
 in both countries.  The interim civil-military govern-
 ment in El Salvador is slowly gaining popular accept-
 ance at home, and six Latin American countries have
 now recognized it.  I                              I                   25X1

 The uncompromising position set forth in the Soviet
 statement of 14 February seems to preclude any intention
 to negotiate a settlement of the Congo problem and sug-
 gests that Moscow hopes Lumumba's death will lead to
 the collapse of the present UN operation through the with-
 drawal of the remaining Afro-Asian contingents.   The omis-

 NOTES AND COMMENTS

 AFTERMATH OF KHRUSHCHEV'S AGRICULTURAL TOUR   .  .  .  .  .  .  . Page  1
 Khrushchev has returned to Moscow from an 18-day
 tour of key agricultural areas, where he advanced detailed
 proposals for increasing Soviet agricultural production
 and made it clear that local leaders will be held directly
 responsible for carrying them out.   Several personnel
 changes have already taken place; more changes will prob-
 ably occur as subordinates are made scapegoats for the
 failures of their chiefs.                                                       25X1
 ALBANIAN PARTY CONGRESS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  2
 Albanian party leader Hoxha's opening address to the
 fourth party congress on 13 February stressed views at
 variance with those of the USSR.        He claimed that the
 United States is preparing to unleash another world war,
 and blamed the United States, Greece, and Yugoslavia for
 a recent coup attempt which, in fact, probably was planned
 by   pro-Soviet    elements in the Albanian party.   He
 also called for Chinese Communist participation in future
 summit talks, a proposal not mentioned by the USSR since
 last May.   Hoxha may be planning an anti-Western show
 trial of those involved in the coup attempt--a move that
 Moscow would not'welcome at this time.                                       25X1
 HUNGARY AFTER THE THREE-YEAR PLAN   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  3
 Hungary has achieved or surpassed most of the goals
 of its Three-Year Plan (1958-60) and has overcome most of
 the effects on the distribution of the national income
 following the 1956 revolt, when investment needs were sac-
 rificed to make more consumer goods available.   Neverthe-
 less,             the continuing unfavorable balance of trade leaves
 Hungary in a difficult position this year, when payments
 on the bulk of foreign debts incurred after the revolt
 begin to fall due.   Moreover, the rapid pace of agricul-
 tural socialization has created new problems for-the economy.

 its dependence on imports from the West while maintain-
 ing the total volume of trade at past levels.   It will
 try to increase production of items now imported from
 the West, to develop substitutes, and to acquire within
 the bloc commodities that cannot be produced in East
 Germany.  A complete reorientation of trade is unlikely
 without considerable assistance from the USSR, which
 so far has shown no willingness to provide such aid.

 RECENT EAST GERMAN TACTICS ON BERLIN   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 6
 The East Germans appear to be testing the extent to
 which they can avoid implementing the concessions they
 offered in December without impelling the West Germans
 to take countermeasures.  The East Germans had promised
 to relax controls on West Germans traveling to East Ber-
 lin and to make technical concessions to facilitate com-
 mercial traffic between West Berlin and West Germany; this
 induced Bonn to reactivate the interzonal trade agreement
 on 29 December.  While recent East German steps appear
 to be a tactical retreat, in response to an ultimatum
 by the West Germans,  the Communist regime has not with-
 drawn its claim to the right to control the movement
 of West Germans into East Berlin--i.e.,  to sovereignty
 over East Berlin.   Although Moscow presumably permits
 these East German probing actions, it has not openly
 involved itself and apparently does not wish to create
 a crisis over Berlin at this time.

 WITH MALAYA        .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ...   Page 10
 London is promoting a confederation of Malaya,  Singa-
 pore, and three British territories in Borneo--Sarawak,
 Brunei, and North Borneo.         Malaya is opposing the inclu-
 sion of Singapore because of its overwhelming Chinese
 majority and leftist orientation.            The British may hope
 to win over Malaya by arguing that the presence of the          25X1
 Borneo territories in the confederation would partially
 offset the harmful influence of Singapore.

 The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland may break up.
 over the issue of African representation in the government
 of Northern Rhodesia.       African nationalists have threatened
 to institute widespread disorders if Britain does not allow
 them majority representation in the local legislature,
 while white leaders in Southern Rhodesia talk of secesssion
 if Britain gives in.        Southern Rhodesian officials recently
 conceded that African political influence in their ter-
 ritory should be increased,  but in return obtained from

 s white-
 Britain broadened powers for Southern Rhodesia

 Iceland's Conservative - Social Democratic coalition
 government has made progress during the past year in its
 program to overcome inflation and reduce the country's
 trade dependence on the Soviet bloc.   The success of the
 program, however, is threatened by the Communist-
 dominated central trade union federation, which is
 seeking to foment labor unrest and bring about the
 government's downfall.   In the protracted fishing
 limits dis ute with Britain, negotiations remain

 Recognition by Cuba last year gave Communist China
 its first diplomatic ties with a country in the western
 hemisphere.   Sharing Moscow's belief that the Cuban
 example offers an opportunity for further gains in Latin
 America, Peiping is willing to accept the cost of siz-
 able economic assistance to Havana.  China's strategy for
 the area as a whole is to expand trade,  step up ex-
 changes of cultural and other nonofficial delegations,
 and increase its influence in local Communist parties.

 King Savang is in Vientiane
 discussing with other Laotian
 leaders ways of broadening the
 Boun Oum government's popular
 appeal and to gain greater in-
 ternational support.   The re-
 sults of these consultations
 will probably be ratified at a
 special cabinet meeting expected
 to be held shortly and to be
 presided  over by the King.
 principal weakness, however, has
 been the preponderance of members
 from southern Laos. Wider repre-
 sentation would improve its com-
 petitive position with the Com-
 munist-supported shadow govern-
 ment in Xieng Khouang, which
 claims, apparently with Souvanna 's
 approval,  to be acting in his be-
 half as the "lawful government."
 Among the moves reportedly
 under consideration are a reaf-
 firmation of Laos' neutrality
 and an announcement of readiness
 to negotiate with "enemies and
 rivals--even Souvanna Phouma."
 The government is apparently
 prepared to offer Souvanna an
 important position, possibly as
 foreign minister or as head of
 the King's Council.   According
 to present plans,  General Phoumi
 himself will go to Phnom Penh to
 convey the offer to Souvanna.
 Chances are probably less
 than even that 3ouvanna will
 join the Boun Oum government.
 Aside from his personal animos-
 ity toward Phounii, he apparent-
 ly remains persuaded that pros-
 pects are good for his fairly
 early return to Laos on his own
 terms as head of a coalition
 government of "national reconcil-
 iation."
 The consultations in Vien-
 tiane may result,  however,  in
 at least some broadening of the
 government. The Boun Oum govern-
 ment is generally undistinguished,
 and a few of its members have
 reputations for corruption.  Its
 Laotian officials appear
 receptive to the U.3 proposal for
 the establishment of a neutral-
 nations commission made up of
 Burma, Cambodia,  and Malaya.
 Little significant change
 in the military situation was
 reported during the past week.
 Government forces have moved
 only a few miles from the junc-
 tion of Routes 7 and 13 toward
 the Plaine des Jarres. The Kong
 Le - Pathet Lao forces are pur-
 suing systematic tactics of de-
 lay which have all but stalled
 the government advance. Aerial
 observation near the head of the
 government column has disclosed
 three large craters on Route 7.
 The enemy has also felled large
 trees, engineered landslides in
 steep defiles, and made exten-
 sive use of land mines. Most of
 the casualties evacuated to Vien-
 tiane were wounded by mortar and

 Soviet Deputy Foreign Min-
 ister Sobolev informed the
 French ambassador in Moscow on
 6 February that the USSR's re-
 ply to the British proposal of
 21 January regarding reactivation
 of the International Control Com-
 mission (ICC) would point out
 that any such commission now
 would have to have both a polit-
 ical and military role;  its tasks
 therefore could only be defined
 by a new international confer-
 ence. He said this was also the
 position of China, North Vietnam,
 and Cambodia.
 Since the US administration
 took office, Moscow has not of-
 ficially commented in its propa-
 ganda on recent proposals to
 reach an international solution
 in Laos.   The line the bloc will
 probably take is reflected in
 Chinese pronouncements. Chou En-
 lai, in a letter sent to Cambo-
 dia's Prince Sihanouk on.11 Feb-
 ruary and broadcast by Peiping
 on 15 February,  said China is
 against reactivating the ICC
 under "present conditions  in
 Laos."  Before the ICC could
 return, Chou said, an  interna-
 tional conference must re-define
 its duties.
 During the past week, other
 bloc spokesmen have maintained
 their opposition to a reactivation
 of the ICC  without   first  con-

 Soviet spokesmen in Moscow
 seem anxious to appear respon-
 sive to recent US statements
 that developments in Laos have
 a direct bearing on Soviet-
 American relations. Two senior
 Soviet journalists told a US
 Embassy official in Moscow that
 the USSR did not want an inter-
 national crisis at this time
 over Laos. They said that as
 far as Moscow is concerned the
 Laotian crisis could easily be
 solved by compromise, but added
 that Peiping had quite a dif-
 ferent attitude which -would make
 a general agreement  diffi-
 cult.
 In view of the bloc's ap-
 parent intention to prolong
 diplomatic exchanges as long as
 possible, it is likely that
 Soviet leaders find it conven-
 ient to attribute this inac-
 tion to Chinese intransigence
 in talks with non-Communist dip-
 lomats.   In the  past Soviet
 spokesmen have alluded to Sino-
 Soviet differences over Laos in
 discussions with Western repre-
 sentatives, apparently hoping to
 exert pressure on the US  ;to
 limit  its military commitment
 in Laos.
 Bloc airlift operations
 between North Vietnam and Laos
 continued at normal levels
 throgghout the week.   Some of
 the Soviet LI-2s continue shut-
 tle flights between Hanoi and
 Haiphong.;.   Supplies are appar-

 ties provided a list of ship

 dicated that some ships ar-

 ICC team chairman stated that

 the docks  during this period
 had kept him awake every night.

 deteriorating industrial estab-
 lishment. No date was announced
 for the start of construction.
 On the same day a group of 88
 Cuban students sailed from Cuba
 aboard a Soviet ship for five
 years of technical studies in
 the USSR.
 Communist China, despite
 its own economic difficulties,
 is making a substantial effort
 to fulfill its commitments to
 Cuba.  More than 30 Chinese-
 chartered merchant vessels are
 currently engaged in the Cuban
 trade.   Most of these are being
 used to deliver  the million
 tons of Cuban sugar Peiping
 promised to buy this year, but
 some are carrying Burmese rice
 and  other  commodities   to
 Cuba.
 Fidel Castro's 12 February
 speech to members of Cuban tech-
 nical advisory councils--state--
 created workers' committees re-
 sponsible for setting production
 norms in nationalized enter-
 prises--included vitriolic at-
 tacks on alleged United States
 aid  to  anti-Castro forces.
 Castro asserted, "As of today
 Cuba is going to declare that
 if the United States has the
 right to promote counterrevolu-
 tion in Cuba and Latin America,
 Cuba has the right to  encour-
 age  revolution in  Latin Amer-
 ica."
 Castro's statement probably
 means continuance  of  Cuba's
 covert assistance to leftist and
 Communist dissident groups in
 other countries, and also a s-.ib-
 stantial increase in the amount
 and variety of its propaganda
 efforts throughout the hemisphere.
 The construction of a powerful
 radio transmitter in Havana
 Province--which Castro cited as
 a source of "worry" to the United
 States during his speech--should
 materially enhance the Cuban
 propaganda potential in this
 field.
 Overt attempts to overthrow
 other regimes would probably be
 discouraged by the failure in
 1959 of several Cuban-based in-
 vasion attempts against Panama,
 the Dominican Republic, and Haiti
 and probably by a desire to avoid
 providing an excuse for  open
 retaliation  against Cuba by
 the Organization of  American
 States.
 Castro devoted a consider-
 able portion of his speech to
 extolling the economic accomplish-
 ments of his government, and he
 contrasted the "success" of the
 Cuban economic system with the
 "failures" and "problems" of the
 US economy.   He also said that
 the "most difficult" economic
 task remains to be met--that of
 industrialization.   He related
 that government plans to tackle
 this problem include the designa-
 tion of 1962 as the "year of in-
 dustrial planning and develop-
 ment," and the announcement of
 a four-year industrialization
 plan early next year.   The em-
 phasis which Castro gave to this
 subject may indicate an effort
 to pave the way for the eventual
 assumption of a new Ministry of
 Industry portfolio by economic

 Despite Castro's assertion
 that Cuba has no economic prob-

 by virulently outspoken Radio
 Mambi in Havana described "dis-

 in various segments of the pop-
 ulation" due to material short-
 ages and spare parts problems.
 Among the economic irritants de-
 scribed in the editorial were
 the lack of parts for repairing
 automobiles, appliances, and
 machinery, and the growth of a
 black market in such consumer
 goods as salt, soap, razor blades,
 pencils, toilet paper, and other
 articles.

 A group of leading Arab

 the commemoration Of the second
 anniversary of the Cuban revolu-

 Cuban Communist leaders described
 the alliance between the Castro
 regime and the Communists' Pop-
 ular Socialist party (PSP) as
 "exceedingly close."  The Cubans
 also told the Arabs that the PSP
 is, with Castro's consent,  in
 majority control of all the "or-
 ganizations which direct the
 masses," and they maintained
 that the Cuban revolution will

 few thousand persons in the area
 be protected,  and that those
 desiring Nicaraguan citizenship
 be   resettled in  Nicaragua.
 Somoza also insists that certain
 portions of the border,   not
 clearly delineated in the origi-
 nal 1906 award upheld by the
 International Court last Novem-
 ber, be definitively settled be-
 fore implementation.
 On 9 February,  the Nicara-
 guan Government received a Hon-
 duran note declaring,  in effect,
 that the only way the award can
 be implemented is for Nicara-
 guan authorities to withdraw
 from the area immediately.   The
 Nicaraguan foreign minister in-
 terpreted this as an indirect
 termination by Honduras of dis-
 cussions on the issue. The for-
 eign minister has said, however,
 that if Honduras should succumb
 to political pressures and move
 troops into the area, Nicaragua
 would expel them. On 15 February,
 Nicaragua announced that it
 would request the Inter-American
 Peace Committee of the OAS to
 settle the issue.
 Popular emotions on the is-
 sue are high in both countries
 and restrained only temporarily
 in Nicaragua by restrictions on
 some civil liberties.   Opposi-
 tion groups are exploiting the
 issue, and neither President
 can ignore popular sentiment
 without endangering the stabil-
 ity of his regime.   The situa-
 tion is further aggravated by
 the long-standing antagonisms
 between the two countries and
 by the numerous and continuing
 forays into Nicaragua by Nicara-
 guan guerrilla bands from Hon-
 duras, some of which have been
 assisted by Honduran officials.
 The new civil-military di-
 rectorate seems to be gaining
 acceptance from the Salvadoran
 public--including the non-Com-
 munist students who had gen-
 erally opposed the new regime.
 The oligarchy of wealthy land-
 owners and businessmen appears
 to be adjusting its extremely
 conservative outlook in response
 to a direct government request
 to support the social and eco-
 nomic reforms necessary to avert
 an eventual triumph of Commu-
 nism.   The armed forces have is-
 sued a declaration of support
 signed by virtually all officers.
 The local Communist party
 is reported to have issued se-
 cret instructions to concentrate
 on infiltrating the army,  im-
 proving discipline in clandes-
 tine activities, and organizing
 the "revolutionary front," and
 to avoid the use of violence
 until directives and material
 aid are received from "abroad."

 and may fail to carry out its
 promises of needed social and
 agrarian reforms.
 Honduras, Argentina, Mex-
 ico, and Chile have recognized
 the new regime, bringing to six
 the number of Latin American
 countries which have done so.
 Venezuela, which had not rec-
 ognized the previous junta, has
 indicated that it will wait
 until elections are held before
 deciding.
 Moscow's massive campaign
 protesting Lumumba's death re-
 flects the Soviet leaders' con-
 fidence that this has provided
 an unprecedented opportunity to
 exploit their militant anti-
 colonialist line and underscores
 the USSR's support for extrem-
 ist, anti-Western forces through-
 out Asia and Africa.   The Soviet
 Government's statement of 14
 February confidently predicted
 that Lumumba's death "will a-
 waken to life fresh forces of
 the national liberation move-
 ment in the Congo and in all
 Africa."  The USSR's intention
 to exploit Lumumba's death to
 the maximum provides further
 evidence that Khrushchev is not
 prepared to forego taking ad-
 vantage of such opportunities
 to advance Soviet influence and
 prestige in the Afro-Asian world
 in order to avoid offending the
 Western powers.
 However, the Soviet Govern-
 ment's statement did not mention
 the United States by name and
 instead placed responsibility
 for Lumumba's death on the
 "colonialists, and above all
 Belgian colonialists,"
 Soviet propaganda has not
 directly implicated the US in its
 condemnation of "colonialists."
 This has been the pattern of
 Soviet coverage of the Congo
 since the US administration took
 office.   The omission of spe-
 cific references to the US ap-
 parently is intended as a ges-
 ture of restraint toward Wash-
 ington. Expressions of shock
 and regret by President Kennedy
 and Ambassador Stevenson were
 reported factually without
 comment by TASS.
 Khrushchev's cordial mes-
 sage of 15 February in reply to
 President Kennedy's congratula-
 tions on the launching of the
 Soviet Venus rocket probably
 was intended as a sign that the
 USSR hopes to prevent reaction
 to events In tr' Porgo from ob-
 .i-ructing :an improvement in
 US-Soviet relations. 'Khrushchev
 welcomed the President's offer
 of cooperation in the explora-
 tion of space and other tasks,
 and stressed that a disarmament
 agreement would create favorable
 conditions for solving these
 "noble tasks."
 In contrast to Soviet re-
 straint, Peiping's statement
 on 14 February specifically
 condemned the United States
 along with Belgium for this
 "vile and cruel attack" against
 the "cause of national inde-
 pendence of the Congolese and
 all African peoples."
 The extreme demands made
 in the Soviet statement seem de-
 signed to block any Western-
 backed UN action to deal with
 the Congo crisis.   It demanded:
 (1)   Condemnation of the
 "actions of Belgium" as an "in-
 ternational crime."   It called
 for "appropriate sanctions"
 against the "aggressor."

 (2)  Arrest and trial of
 Tshomb6 and Mobutu, disarmament
 of their forces, and removal of
 all Belgian troops and personnel
 from the Congo.
 (3)  Termination of the UN
 operation in one month and the
 withdrawal.  of  "all  foreign
 troops" from the Congo.
 (4)  The dismissal of Ham-
 marskjold.                       Moscow served
 served notice that it will not
 maintain any relations with him
 and will not recognize him as
 an "official of the UN."
 (5)   Assistance to the
 "legitimate government of the
 Congo   led by acting Prime Min-
 ister Antoine Gizenga." The
 USSR declared that it is ready
 to "render all possible assist-
 ance and support to the Congo-
 lese people and its legitimate
 government."
 This uncompromising position
 seems to preclude any Soviet in-
 tention to negotiate a settle-
 ment of the Congo crisis.   The
 Soviet leaders apparently hope
 Lumumba's death will lead to
 the collapse  of the present
 UN operation through the with-
 drawal of the remaining Afro-
 Asian contingents--most immedi-
 ately those of Morocco, Ghana,
 and Indonesia.   Moscow would
 vigorously exploit any move to
 introduce Western troops into
 the Congo as an attempt to
 reimpose colonial rule.   The
 Soviet leaders, moreover, would
 probably believe that direct
 Western intervention would make
 it extremely difficult or im-
 possible for the West to marshal
 moderate Afro-Asian governments
 in support of a new approach
 for a Congo settlement.
 In addition to the attempt
 to discredit and terminate the
 UN operation, Moscow is seizing
 upon Lumumba's death as a pre-
 text for reviving charges against
 Hammarskjold--now described as
 a "miserable lackey of the colo-
 nialists." Moscow's violent at-
 tack on the secretary  general
 reflects the frustration the
 Soviet leaders have felt since
 Lumumba was overthrown and bloc
 missions were expelled from the
 Congo last September. The Soviets
 selected Hammarskjold as the
 scapegoat for these setbacks.
 Moscow's demand for his
 dismissal does not appear to
 foreshadow any more drastic ac-
 tion such as a Soviet-led bloc
 withdrawal from the UN.   This
 latest statement only makes more
 explicit the position Khrushchev
 took last fall before the Gen-
 eral Assembly when he warned that
 Hammarskjold's failure to resign
 would lead the USSR to draw the
 "necessary conclusions" and
 threatened to withhold Soviet
 cooperation with any of his
 decisions.
 Hammarskjold is unlikely to
 resign as long as he believes he
 has the support of a majority
 of UN members, particularly the
 smaller powers. Withdrawal of
 recognition of Hammarskjold as
 the secretary general by the
 USSR will make UN operations
 more difficult but not impos-
 sible.   The USSR will have to
 conduct usual business with the
 UN Secretariat, the staff of
 which is predominantly loyal to
 Hammarskjold.   The USSR vetoed

 1950,  linking him to the UN ac-
 tion in Korea.   The General As-
 sembly later that year e-_-..tended
 Lie's appointment for three years.
 The Soviet bloc responded by of-
 ficially ignoring Lie as secre-
 tary general for the ensuing
 two years.   This pressure final-
 ly forced him to resign in 1)5'.
 According to a high offi-
 cial in the UN Secretariat,
 Hammarskjold has already ordered
 the UN force to occupy airfields
 and other communication centers
 and to set up military control
 points in areas of Congolese
 military action. The UN Command
 reportedly has been ordered to
 stop all forces engaged in of-
 fensive action but to use force
 only if force is used against
 it.   Execution of these orders
 will primarily affect Mobutu's
 operations in Equateur Province
 and Tshombd's offensive  in
 northern !?'atanga.   The UN com-
 mand is now attempting  to
 establish a 50-mile-wide neu-
 tral   zone on the border of
 Equateur and Orientale Provinces.
 however, the small size of the
 UN units,  coupled with the equiv-
 ocal   nature of the directives
 themselves, will render effec-
 tive UN control difficult.
 Hammarskjold's order to
 UN forces reflects a heightened
 sense of urgency as a result of
 1umumba's death,   Neutralist
 nations reportedly believe that
 the Security Council should pass
 an emergency resolution urging
 that all possible measures be
 taken to avoid civil war  and
 calling for the cessation of Belgian
 and other foreign interference.
 Lumumba's death has aroused
 a general world-wide reactioii
 against Katanga and through as-
 sociation, Belgium and the Kasa-
 vubu government.   Belgian in-
 stallations-in several capitals,
 including Moscow, Belgrade,
 Warsaw, Cairo, Khartoum, and
 Dakar were attacked by mobs. GL
 .5 February,  East Germany, Yu-
 goslavia, Guinea, and Ghana
 recognized Gizenga, and other
 bloc and some neutralist states
 will probably follow suit.  The
 controlled UAR press has re-
 ported to Nasir "will fully
 recognize"  Gizenga's regime
 as "a lawful and national gov-
 ernment."   Even in some of the
 rloderate Wrench-speaking states
 which were represented at the
 recent Brazzaville Conference,
 there is reported to be criticism
 of the Kasavubu government.
 Prime Minister Nehru of
 India sent a strongly worded
 statement to 1 ammarskjold de-
 manding vigorous and prompt
 action to punish Lumumba's
 killers and to stop external
 aid to Tshombe and Mobutu, who,
 he said, shared responsibility
 for Lumumba's death. He offered
 to send troops to the Congo pro-
 vided that the UN operation
 there becomes "effective." Earli-
 er he stated that the goal of the
 UN Command should be to encourage
 a "unified, independent, sovereign
 Congo republic" and that it
 should take military action if
 necessary to attain this goal.
 Ghana's Nkrumah sent an
 "ultimatum" stating that Ghanaian
 forces would be withdrawn from
 the Congo if all Congolese troops
 had not been "completely dis-
 armed" in one month's  t i::ie .

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 February 1961
 AFTER;4ATH OF KHRUCHSHEV'S AGRICULTURAL TOUR
 Khrushchev's 18-day tour
 of key Soviet agricultural
 areas has left party leaders
 throughout the country keenly
 aware of their personal stakes
 in the future of Soviet farming.
 Khrushchev advanced detailed
 proposals for increasing agri-
 cultural production in each
 area he visited, and made it
 clear that local leaders will
 be held directly responsible
 for carrying them out.   Several
 personnel changes have already
 taken place;  more will probably
 be made as responsible officials
 seek to shift the onus for past
 failures onto their subordi-
 nates.
 Khrushchev returned to the
 Kremlin on 12 February after a
 swing through the Ukraine,  the
 North Caucasus, Georgia,  and
 Voronezh Oblast.   His proposed
 visit to the New Lands of
 Kazakhstan and Siberia has not
 yet taken place,  however, and
 there is no indication when he
 intends to visit this area.
 Khrushchev's speeches during
 the tour were generally more
 moderate in tone than his re-
 marks at the January central
 committee plenum.   In the main,
 he kept his criticisms general
 and left the recitation of
 specific shortcomings to the
 principal party chief in each
 area.
 Local leaders have been
 prompt to seek scapegoats.  Im-
 mediately after Khrushchev left
 the Ukraine,  members of the
 Lepublic's party presidium
 went to several oblasts, where
 they "explained" the work of
 the plenum at which they had
 been forced to admit their own
 poor records of leadership.
 In Odessa and Lvov,  Ukrainian
 party boss Nikolay P,)dgorny--
 a particular target   af Khru-
 shchev's ire in January--super-
 vised the replacement of the
 oblast first secretaries.
 A similar shake-up took
 place in Armenia shortly after
 Khrushchev's address in Tbilisi
 on 7 February.   A plenum of
 the Armenian central committee
 elected ;v1ger ir1elkonyan, a
 former deputy minister of agri-
 culture,  to the central com-
 mittee secretariat and bureau,
 apparently to replace B.  Ye.
 Sarkisov, who was responsible
 for party supervision of agri-
 culture in Armenia.
 Personnel changes have also
 been made in areas not included
 on Khrushchev's itinerary.
 The oblast party chiefs in
 Smolensk and Kirov (RSFSR) and
 in aviary (Turkmen Republic) have
 been fired, and unconfirmed re-
 ports indicate that a major
 shake-up of the Kirghiz party
 leadership has resulted in the
 ouster of six members of the
 republic central committee and
 the dismissal from the party of
 central committee member
 Alukhambet  Isayev.   The latter's
 fraudulent activities were ex-
 posed at the January central
 committee plenum when Khru-
 shchev demanded to know why he
 had been removed as first sec-
 retary in Tyan Shan Oblast last
 summer only to gain subsequent
 appointment as republic internal
 affairs minister.
 The flurry of personnel
 shifts seems likely to continue,
 and Khrushchev is likely to re-

 There were no indications
 during the first three days
 of the fourth congress of the
 Albanian Workers (Communist)
 party that. Tirana intends
 to abandon its pro-Chinese at-
 titudes in favor of a pro-Soviet
 orientation.   In a belligerent
 opening address on 13 February,
 party leader Enver Hoxha called
 for Chinese participation in
 any summit talks, an issue
 not raised by the USSR since
 Khrushchev's speech of 28 May
 1960, immediately after the
 breakdown of the Paris summit
 meeting.  Hoxha said President
 Kennedy was continuing his
 predecessor's plans to initiate
 a third world war.   He also
 claimed that the United States,
 Greece, and Yugoslavia had
 collaborated with Albanian
 "traitors" some months ago to
 overthrow his regime.
 The level of bloc dele-
 gations is comparable to those
 sent to the last Albanian
 congress in 1956, but is lower
 than delegations to other sat-
 ellite congresses in the last
 two years.   Those from Commu-
 nist China, North Korea, North
 Vietnam, and Czechoslovakia
 are led by presidium or polit-
 buro members, but most are
 headed merely by central com-
 mittee members.   Every dele-
 gation contains ideological,
 propaganda, or party discipline
 specialists, and several in-
 clude participants in last No-
 vember's conference of Communist
 parties in Moscow.   Petr
 Pospelov, candidate presidium
 member, heads the Soviet  dele-
 gation, as he did in 1956.
 The ideological specialists
 in the Soviet and European sa-
 tellite delegations are probably
 working in private to sway the
 Albanian leadership from its
 pro-Chinese course.   An anti-
 West, anti-Yugoslav, pro-Chi-
 nese propaganda line preceded
 the congress and has been main-
 tained since the meeting began.
 This, along with Hoxha's charge
 of Western complicity in the coup
 attempt, has committed his re-
 gime to policies at variance
 with those of Moscow.   More-
 over, his statement that some
 of the coup participants, along
 with evidence of their activi-
 ties, are in the "hands of the
 people's justice" suggests that
 he intends to stage an anti-
 Western show trial sometime soon.
 Such a trial would inevitably
 have overtones offensive to' Moscow.
 Contrary to Hoxha's conten-
 tion, the abortive coup attempt
 --which occurred last summer--
 was probably planned by pro-
 Soviet elements in the Albanian
 party and military forces,

 Hungary has achieved or
 surpassed most of the goals of
 the Three-Year Plan (1958-60).
 It has almost overcome the ef-
 fects of emergency measures
 taken after the 1956 revolt on
 the distribution of national in-
 come, has improved its ability
 to produce industrial exports,
 and has started modernizing its
 industrial plant and production
 techniques without returning to
 the excessive pace of industri-
 alization of the early 1950s.
 However, economic plans for 1960
 --which were above the Three-
 Year Plan targets for that year
 --were not fully met, and plan-
 ners have set the investment
 target for 1961 at a level be-
 low the average for 1959-60.

 period.
 However, most immediate
 economic results of this reor-
 ganization have not been favor-
 able. Workers--especially the
 younger ones--have been trans-
 ferring from agriculture to in-
 dustry in excessively large num-
 bers, causing a disproportionate
 growth of the industrial labor
 force and depriving agriculture
 of needed manpower.  The regime
 has been forced to increase
 agricultural investments at the
 expense of other economic sec-
 tors; its plans to reduce agri-
 cultural investments in 1961
 will conflict with the continued
 need to support collectivization
 with purchases of machinery and
 the construction of farm build-
 ings.
 Prospects are poor for a
 substantial growth of agricul-
 tural production in the next few
 years.   The outlook for the con-
 sumer in 1961 is further dark-
 ened by the regime's efforts to
 tighten labor norms in industry.
 Agricultural weaknesses
 have contributed to the regime's
 greatest problem--foreign trade.
 Hungary was able to move from
 a $194,500,000 deficit in 1957 to
 a  $50,000,000 surplus in 1958,
 but exports have risen much
 less than imports during the
 past two years, with a resultant
 unfavorable trade balance. This
 year, repayments begin to come
 due on the principal debts owed
 other bloc countries;  Hungary's
 indebtedness following the 1956
 revolt totaled $382,000,000.
 Unless the Soviet Union grants
 a postponement of the main debt
 payments, the regime will have
 to generate an export surplus
 in 1961,  a move which might re-
 quire   domestic   austerit
 measures.                      (Pre-

 supplies, and find substitute
 products or immediate alternate
 sources of supply.       Special
 commissions and working groups
 were set up to       investigate
 the effects of a cessation of
 interzonal trade and to find
 other sources on a long-term
 basis.
 Since the reinstatement of
 the trade pact on 30 December,
 East Germany has continued its
 attempt to decrease its depend-
 ence             on the West for essential
 imports while maintaining the
 volume of trade at past levels.
 Stressing that the achievement
 of independence from Western
 imports remains a major po-
 litical goal, the State Planning
 Commission has decreed that any
 attempt to procure imports from
 the West in  preference to sub-
 situtes available                      from CEMA
 countries would be considered a
 "breach of long-range policy de-
 cisions taken at the highest
 party levels."
 Industrial and foreign
 trade planners have been in-
 structed to "achieve independ-
 ence" from Western supplies by
 1962.   Wherever possible, do-
 mestic production of vital ma-
 terials will be increased,  con-
 struction and manufacturing in-
 dustries will use raw materials
 produced domestically or avail-
 able within'the bloc, and in-
 dustry will begin immediately
 to transform industrial stand-
 ards from the DIN (German)
 system.to the GOST (Soviet);
 system.   Conservation of mate-
 rials will continue to be
 stressed, and domestic products
 will be substituted for imports
 wherever feasible.   Stockpiling
 of vital materials not produced
 in sufficient amounts within the
 bloc would also appear neces-
 sary.
 East Germany's program to
 reduce its dependence on Western
 supplies apparently was not So-
 viet inspired but no doubt has
 Ioscow's approval.   Reduction
 of vulnerability to Western
 economic sanctions would in-
 crease the bloc's ability to
 implement diplomatic and stra-
 tegic moves affecting Berlin.
 There is some question,
 however, concerning Soviet will-
 ingness to absorb the cost of
 this program.   The Soviets re-
 portedly agreed initially to
 increase their own shipments of
 needed supplies to East Germany
 if those from West Germany were
 cut off.   Now that interzonal
 trade has been re-established,
 however, Moscow has retracted
 its offer, at least for some
 commodities, and apparently
 does not plan any major adjust--
 &ents in its economic plans or
 in those of other C1 1A countries
 in order to accommodate East
 Germany.   Some Soviet aid per-
 haps can be expected to result
 from negotiations now under way
 in Moscow, but it is unlikely
 that it will be of the scope
 originally anticipated by East
 German planning officials.
 East Ge.rmany's success in
 pursuing its new trade policy
 toward the West will depend on
 now efficiently it expands its
 domestic production and uses
 available raw.materials, as
 well as on its ability to adjust
 its trade with both the West
 and the bloc without disrupting
 the plans of other bloc coun-
 tries.   East Germany undoubted-
 ly can reduce its dependence on
 certain of its West German im-
 ports,, but it is unlikely that
 the,measures  instituted thus
 far will adequately reduce de-
 pendence on such important com-
 modities as steel.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 February 1961
 East Germany's recent ac-
 tions indicate that it is test-
 ing West Germany's willingness
 to take countermeasures to force
 the regime to carry  out  its
 promise to the West Germans to
 relax controls on the Berlin
 sector border and make certain
 technical concessions to facil-
 itate trade between West Berlin
 and West Germany.   The East Ger-
 man promise was instrumental in
 inducing Bonn to agree on 29 De-
 cember to reactivate the inter-
 zonal trade agreement for 1361.
 Bonn had abrogated the pact fol-
 lowing East Germany's harassing
 actions against West Berlin last
 September.
 The East German negotiator
 in interzonal trade talks held
 on 8 February to discuss the im-
 plementation of the 23 December
 agreement read a long  state-
 ment to the effect that the re-
 gime was not then in a position
 to carry out its undertakings,
 claiming that the   Federal Re-
 public had violated its promise
 to maintain complete secrecy on
 the concessions.   As a result,
 the talks were broken off.   on
 1-' February,  however, they re-
 sumed, and the East German ne-
 gotiator took a somewhat                       more
 conciliatory attitude, saying
 that the Communist regime would
 soon carry out its commitment
 to permit the sealing of trucks
 moving between West Berlin and
 West Germany.
 Two days later,  the East
 German negotiator claimed that
 the regime had implemented cer-
 tain concessions, relating to
 trade traffic,  that it intended
 to carry out the others, and
 that it was studying the matter
 of border controls.   The  West
 German negotiator, not satis-
 fied with this statement on bor-
 der controls,  demanded a satis-
 factory proposal by midnight.
 Later that day,  East Berlin po-
 lice announced that new regula-
 tions would go into force at
 midnight to "satisfy and facili-
 tate" the issuance of passes to
 West Germans to enter East Ber-
 lin.
 While the regime probably
 will claim that this police meas-
 ure fulfills its promise to ease
 controls, the regulations  ex-
 pressly reassert the validity
 of the 8 September decree de-
 manding that West Germans secure
 passes.   This decree violates
 the quadripartite status of Ber-
 lin.   The East Germans, moreover,
 are refusing to conclude long-
 -term contracts with West German
 :firms, which require revocable
 shipping licenses.   Bonn had
 counted on this licensing pro-
 cedure as a means to hold East
 Germany to its commitments.
 The USSR does not appear
 to be interested in creating a
 major crisis over Berlin  at
 this time, but probably is not
 averse to allowing East Germany
 to maintain a degree of pressure
 on the issue.   East Germany's
 tactics suggest that it believes
 it can maneuver the West Germans
 into continuing trade,  despite
 the Communist regime's failure
 to carry out its promises. The
 East Germans may have estimated
 --and informed Moscow--that Bonn
 would be reluctant to take dras-
 tic countermeasures to hold them
 to their commitments.
 The East German action in
 barring a number of high  West
 German Evangelical churchmen from
 attending religious services in
 East Berlin on 12 February prob-
 ably was an attempt to demon-
 strate publicly the regime's
 claim to "sovereignty" over the
 Soviet sector, as well as a fur-
 ther step in its long-term pol-
 icy of separating the Evangelical
 congregations in East Germany
 from their leaders in West Berlin
 and West Germany.   The Communist
 regime indicated earlier that it

 would not permit the Evangelical
 Church to hold meetings of its

 February.   On 9 February party
 boss Ulbricht delivered a scorch-
 ing attack on the "NATO politi-
 cians" in the Evangelical Church,
 declaring that they had "no
 business in the capital of the
 German Democratic Republic."
 The Communist government
 does not appear to have made any
 attempt to prevent East German
 ecclesiastics from attending the
 synod in West Berlin nor did
 East German police bar Bishop
 Otto Dibelius of Berlin-Branden-
 burg from attending the reli-
 gious services in East Berlin.
 Dibelius has long been a target
 of abuse and legal proceedings
 are pending against him in East
 Berlin courts for "advocating
 resistance to the state power."
 In view of the East Ger-
 man actions, Bonn is consider-
 ing reinstating its boycott of
 the Leipzig Fair to be held
 5-14 March.   The West German
 cabinet was scheduled to con-
 sider the matter at a 16 Febru-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 16 February 1961
 General Ne Win's order in
 early February ousting 11 senior
 officers from their commands
 appears to have thwarted any
 early army coup against Prime
 Minister Nu's government in Bur-
 ma.   In addition, Ne Win's ac-
 tion underscored his personal
 dominance of Burma's career of-
 ficer corps and his determina-
 tion that his subordinates sup-
 port his policies fully.   His
 immediate motive was to ensure
 the completion of the Sino-
 Burmese border demarcation proj-
 ect, which he believes is con-
 tingent on Nu's remaining pre-
 mier.
 The ousted officers made
 up the core of the army's ex-
 perienced field commanders and
 administrators.  They opposed
 Ne Win's original decision to
 return the government to civil-
 ian control in 1960 and contin-
 ued openly critical of his non-
 intervention with Nu's inept
 domestic administration and cur-
 rent rapprochement with Peiping.
 Through former army train-
 ing director Brigadier Maung
 Maung, the officers had pressed
 Ne Win for an extension of the
 American military aid program,
 despite the general's known ir-
 ritation with the number of
 American personnel with the Bur-
 mese Army and his fear that they
 might become a source of embar-
 rassment in Burma's relations
 with Communist China.
 Although these leading
 critics of Ne Win's policies

 LONDON SEEKING TO CONFEDERATE SINGAPORE AND BORNEO WITH MALAYA
 London is promoting a con-
 federation linking Singapore
 and the Federation of  Malaya
 with Britain's three Borneo ter-
 ritories--North Borneo, Sarawak,
 and Brunei. One purpose of Com-
 monwealth Relations Secretary
 Duncan Sandys' visit to Malaya
 last month apparently was to urge
 support for this project.
 Although there has been
 some favorable response through-
 out the area, Malayan Prime
 Minister Rahman has reiterated
 his adamant opposition to the
 inclusion of Singapore in such
 a union. Malays outnumber the
 Chinese in the Federation of
 Malaya, but would be in a slight
 minority in a confederation in-
 cluding Singapore.   Rabman is
 also concerned about the leftist
 inclinations of the Singapore
 Chinese.
 The British plan apparently
 envisages that Malaya  would

 assulne--at least outwardly--the
 authority now exercised by the
 British in all but Malaya in
 the fields of defense, foreign
 relations, and internal security.
 Each of the states, which would
 otherwise be autonomous, would
 be represented in the Malayan
 parliament, but not on a popu-
 lation basis.   In the formative
 years, the British would pre-
 sumably expect to exercise con-
 siderable influence in an advi-
 sory capacity.
 Britain probably would
 also step up the political de-
 velopment of the Borneo terri-
 tories.   The colony of Sarawak
 now is the most politically ad-
 vanced and has rudimentary rep-
 resentative institutions already
 in operation;  the colony of
 North Borneo is the most back-
 ward and is only beginning lim-
 ited self-government.   Brunei,
 a British protectorate, is in
 the initial stages of developing
 representative insti-
 tutions, although its
 sultan retains almost
 absolute power over
 internal affairs.
 Such a grouping
 has been under con-
 sideration for many
 years in order to free
 Britain of responsi-
 bility and ensure a
 means for eventual
 independence for the
 underpopulated and
 culturally fragmented
 Borneo territories.
 The British are addi-
 tionally concerned
 about the future of
 Singapore as a semi-
 autonomous state and
 now apparently feel
 that it should be in-
 cluded in a regional
 grouping.     Last October the
 British reportedly tried to con-
 vince Malayan Deputy Prime Min-
 ister Razak that merger of Sing-
 apore with Malaya was essential
 in order to bolster Singapore's
 economic prospects and to im-
 prove its chances of long-range
 political stability.
 Personal relations between
 Rahman and Singapore's Prime
 Minister Lee Kuan Yew have im-
 proved recently, and some high
 Malayan officials have reported-
 ly become sympathetic toward a
 grouping including Singapore.
 By supporting Malaya's interest
 in a link with the Borneo terri-
 tories, the British may hope at
 the meeting of Commonwealth
 prime ministers in March to per-
 suade Rahman to agree that the
 presence of the Borneo terri-
 tories in a confederation would
 partially offset the influence
 of Singapore.

 RHODESIA-NYASALAND
 The two separate constitu-
 tional conferences recently
 held between British cabinet
 ministers and representatives
 of political factions from both
 Northern and Southern. Rhodesia
 may arouse racial conflicts in
 central Africa and possibly lead
 white-controlled Southern Rho-
 desia to attempt to secede.
 Colonial Secre-

 posals, presented to
 the Northern Rho-
 desian conference in
 London on 14 February,
 were described by
 British officials as
 attempting to achieve
 "parity" between Af-

 BACKGROUND
 The semi-independent Federation was formed in 1953 from the
 self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia and the British protec-
 torates of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, still administered by
 British governors.  London supported federation in order to prevent
 the spread of South African racial doctrines into Central Africa
 and to facilitate area economic planning.  The Africans, strongly
 opposed the imposition of a white-controlled federal goverment.
 Nyasaland will have an elected African majority in its.
 legislature after elections this year, similar changes are being
 considered for Northern Rhodesia.  Southern Rhodesian African.
 have been accorded minority representation under new constitu-
 tional proposals.
 The white settlers, who have been politically and econdnnically
 dominant, constitute less than 4 percent of the population of 8,-
 430,000.  The Federation's economy is the second most developed in.
 Africa; copper mining in Northern Rhodesia is the most important
 posals are not intended to pro-
 duce an African majority at pres-
 ent.   The British could pre-
 sumably arrange this later
 either through nominated mem-
 bers or by lowering the fran-
 chise qualifications.
 These proposals--which Lon-
 don is apparently unprepared to
 modify--are not expected to
 satisfy either the Africans or
 white settlers, but the British
 hope for acceptance as the best
 available solution.
 African leaders have in-
 sisted on a majority of Afri-
 can-elected members in both the
 legislative and executive coun-
 cils and have threatened vio-
 lence if their demands are not
 met.   On the other hand, Federa-
 tion Prime Minister Welensky
 had asserted earlier that South-
 ern Rhodesia would leave the
 Federation if London insisted
 on an African majority in
 Northern Rhodesia.   To meet the
 wealth Relations Secretary
 Sandys and Southern Rhodesian
 officials, including African
 representatives, reached an
 agreement which has been sup-
 ported so far by all factions
 except extremist groups among
 both settlers and Africans.
 The agreement, which is subject
 to British parliamentary approv-
 al and a Southern Rhodesian
 referendum in June, in general
 expands African political in-
 fluence while increasing South-
 ern Rhodesia's powers of self-
 government.
 The Salisbury conference
 agreed on a bill of rights in
 the Southern Rhodesian consti-
 tution, a dual electoral roll
 system by which, in essence,
 70,000 white voters will elect
 50 representatives and some 50,-
 OUv Africans will elect 15 re-
 presentatives, and a constitu-
 tional council to safeguard
 civil rights with the power to
 delay discriminatory legislation
 for six months.

 British officials in London
 have confirmed that, in return
 for Southern Rhodesian accept-
 ance of these pro-African pro-
 visions, the agreement envisages
 surrender by London of its re-
 serve powers to veto Southern
 Rhodesian legislation on African
 affairs.  This has been one
 of London's major means for in-
 fluencing Southern Rhodesia.
 Although Southern Rhodesian
 Prime Minister Whitehead has
 stated publicly that the fran-
 chise agreement will result in
 control of the government by
 white voters "for all time,"
 the opposition segregationist
 Dominion party has refused to
 agree to the proposals and has
 threatened to advocate seces-

 satisfaction in African circles
 over the limited gains made at
 the conference, and the posi-
 tion of moderate Joshua Nkomo,
 leader of the National Democrat-
 ic party, may be weakened by
 extremist agitation.
 The Rhodesian conferences
 may also provoke political strains
 in British Conservative party
 policy on Africa.   Some parlia-
 mentary elements already resent
 Colonial Secretary Macleod's al-
 leged "sellout" of the white
 minorities, and Macleod is re-
 portedly irritated by Sandys'
 successful competition with him

 De Gaulle apparently be-
 lieves that his talk with Tu-
 nisian President Bourguiba,
 which has been arranged for
 later this month, will help pre-
 pare for French-PAG talks.   De
 Gaulle recognizes Bourguiba is
 greatly concerned over the
 growing influence of radical
 African and Communist forces
 on the Algerian rebel leader-
 ship.
 Members of the PAG continue
 to indicate a desire for a ne-
 gotiated settlement, and insist.
 that they have a mandate to
 negotiate for the Algerian
 people.   They are said to have
 agreed unanimously during their
 January meeting that they would
 not recognize or deal with any
 interim Algerian government set
 up unilaterally by Paris but
 nevertheless realize that nego-
 tiations with Paris cannot give
 them immediate control over Al-
 geria.
 Rebel "deputy premier and
 foreign minister" Belkacem Krim
 reportedly persuaded the con-
 ference of foreign ministers of
 the Arab states which ended in
 Baghdad on 3 February not to es-
 tablish a boycott or sever dip-
 lomatic relations with France.
 He is said to have emphasized
 that only De Gaulle could solve
 the Algerian problem, and that
 he must be given time to do this.
 The PAG will resent any in-
 timation that Bourguiba's talks
 with De Gaulle will involve
 substantive negotiations.   The
 rebel "minister of information"
 has complained that the PAG was
 not consulted about De Gaulle's
 invitation to Bourguiba, and an-
 other PAG representative told
 a member of the American Embassy
 in Tunis on 9 February that
 while Bourguiba has "every right
 to go to Paris," there can be
 no substitute for direct nego-
 tiations.                            25X1
 Bourguiba's   25X1
 intention in seeing De Gaulle
 is to strengthen the position
 of moderate elements in the
 PAG, but that the mission could
 have the opposite effect..
 Bourguiba himself is grati-
 fied that De Gaulle has picked
 him as a go-between rather than
 his rival. for influence in the
 Maghreb, Moroccan King Mohamed
 V.  At the same time, Bourguiba
 probably fears jeopardizing his
 future influence in Africa
 should his visit not lead to
 early French-Algerian negotia-
 tions.
 PROSPECTS FOR ICELAND
 Shortly after assuming of-

 Conservative - Social Democratic
 government instituted a far-
 reaching economic stabilization
 program to overcome persistent
 inflation and the related prob-
 lems of a chronic trade deficit
 and a shortage of foreign ex-
 change.
 Since parliamentary ap-
 proval of the program last Feb-
 ruary, much progress has been
 made toward achieving a stable
 economy and reducing Iceland's
 trade dependence on the Soviet
 bloc.   Following Reykjavik's
 relaxation of restrictions on
 trade with the West, bloc trade
 dropped from 34 percent of Iceland's

 total trade to 25 percent in
 the first half of 1960. The ul-
 timate success of the program
 depends heavily on its contin-
 ued tacit acceptance by the rank
 and file of organized labor.
 The Communist-dominated
 central trade union federation,
 whose affiliates have been work-
 ing without wage contracts since
 September 1059 and thus could
 strike at any time, has hesi-
 tated to call politically moti-
 vated strikes because of the
 opposition of most workers.  In
 recent weeks, however, there
 have been indications that   the
 Communists are actively encour-
 aging member unions to seek un-
 realistic wage increases  in
 order to breach the government's
 wage policy and frustrate the
 effective working of the pro-
 gram.
 Success in this attempt
 would probably force a reorgan-
 ization of the government. Cer-
 tain elements in the coalition
 might be willing to consider
 bringing Communists into the
 cabinet if such a solution would
 guarantee labor peace.
 The government is also under
 attack by the Communists and the
 Progressives for opening negotia-
 tions with Britain last October
 on the long-standing fishinglim-
 its dispute. The talks are dead-
 locked over technical points and
 Iceland's determination to reserve
 its right to extend control over
 fishing into areas even beyond
 the disputed 12-mile limit. Lon-
 don is trying to reach an agree-
 ment this month;  in a recent note
 it warned Iceland that failure to
 do so could lead to a recurrence
 of armed clashes when the spring
 fishing season opens.
 Communists and certain na-
 tionalist groups demand that the
 government terminate the talks,
 hoping thus to strain relations
 between the two NATO allies and
 discredit Iceland's membership in
 the alliance. Although unsuccess-
 ful in their continuing efforts
 to arouse public opinion over the
 once-popular issue of the Keflavik
 air base and the American forces
 stationed there, these groups are
 seeking tc embroil the US in the dispute
 by demanding that the defense force
 "protect" Iceland from incursions
 by British fishing and patrol
 craft.

 CHINESE COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LATIN AMERICA
 Recognition by Cuba last
 year gave Communist China its
 first diplomatic ties with any
 country in the western hemi-
 sphere.   Believing that the Cuban
 example offers an opportunity
 for further gains in Latin Amer-
 ica, Peiping is willing to ac-
 cept the cost of sizable econom-
 ic assistance to the Cubans. Its
 strategy for the area as a whole
 combines a reliance on "people's
 diplomacy" with an expansion of
 Chinese influence in Latin Amer-
 ican Communist parties. The ob-
 jective is to win political rec-
 ognition and encourage revolu-
 tionary action.
 Following the US decision
 last summer to stop buying Cuban
 sugar, the Chinese agreed to
 take 500,000 tons annually for
 the next five years, more than
 twice their previous yearly pur-
 chases from nonbloc sources. Al-
 though sugar is in short supply
 in China,  it is a low-priority
 import, and Peiping's willing-
 ness to forego the purchase of
 more urgently needed commodities
 underscored its determination to
 use Cuba as the wedge to expand
 its influence in the whole area.
 This motive has also been demon-
 strated by the willingness to
 ship rice to Cuba at a time when
 China is experiencing severe
 food shortages and making sub-
 stantial purchases of food grains
 outside the Communist bloc.
 When Che Guevara visited
 China last November, Peiping of-
 fered him a $60,000,000 interest-
 free loan--at the time the larg-
 est single credit extended by
 China to a nonbloc country. The
 Chinese also agreed to pay a
 higher price per pound of sugar
 than agreed to last summer and
 to double their sugar purchases
 to a million tons in 1961. The
 Cubans have given lavish pub-
 licity to China's beneficence.
 During Guevara's visit the
 Chinese far surpassed their usu-
 al great hospitality for offi-
 cial visitors.   Both Mao Tse-tung
 and Chou En-lai had "intimate"
 talks with him, and the Chinese
 ambassador-designate to Cuba es-
 corted him on a tour of the country.
 In an exchange of speeches
 with Guevara, Chou congratulated
 Cuba on its "face-to-face strug-
 gle against heinous US imperial-
 ism."  Chou stated that while
 Latin America faces a "complex
 and arduous" task in freeing it-
 self from the United States,
 Cuba's success stands as proof
 that the situation is "extremely
 favorable."  For his part, Guevara
 amplified earlier statements by
 Cubans that their revolution had
 drawn on Chinese experience, say-
 ing the Chinese example "revealed
 a new road for the Americas:'.'
 Guevara expressed admiration for
 China's communes and other social
 innovations and forecast that
 Latin Americans would adopt "one
 of these methods or something
 similar" when they achieved their
 "liberation."
 Guidance to Communist Parties
 The Chinese did not assume
 a role in influencing Latin Amer-
 ican Communist parties until after
 the 21st Soviet party congress in
 January 1959.  At that congress,
 Soviet officials, concerned that
 publicity over Moscow's domina-
 tion of the Communist movement
 had hampered the activities of
 Communist parties, told the Lat-
 ins to play down their subordina=-
 tion to Moscow.
 Moscow's decision to dis-
 guise its role was Peiping's op-
 portunity.   Delegates to the So-
 viet congress from 12 Latin Amer-
 ican parties traveled on to Pei-
 ping at Chinese expense in March
 1959.  Mao Tse-tung and Liu Shao-
 chi conferred with them, impress-
 ing on them the suitability of

 Chinese revolutionary tactics to
 their problems.
 The Chinese opened a school
 for Latin American Communists in
 Peiping in August 1959, China's
 most ambitious undertaking in
 training foreign Communists. The
 25X1
 Ground for dissension between
 China and the Soviet Union is
 thus being developed in Latin
 America.  During the meeting of
 Communist parties in Moscow last
 November, the effectiveness of
 Chinese proselytizing was shown
 when some of the Latin American
 parties reportedly supported the
 Chinese against the Soviet party
 members on many of the issues
 being debated.   If Moscow had in-
 deed earlier encouraged Peiping's
 desire for a greater role in Lat-
 in America, the disagreements be-
 tween the two countries--includ-
 ing the dispute over the proper
 tactics to be followed in under-
 developed areas--have since un-
 doubtedly occasioned second
 thoughts within the Kremlin.
 At the outset, the USSR
 seemed to encourage Peiping's
 desire for a greater role in
 Latin America. The Soviet ambas-
 sador in Tokyo,  for example,  sug-
 gested to Latin American diplo-
 mats there in 1959 that they
 visit China and offered to make
 the arrangements.
 Peiping seems to have had
 some success in convincing Latin
 American Communists of the use-
 fulness of Chinese experience.
 25X1
 (Younger, more rad-
 ical members of the Cuban Commu-
 nist party reportedly are turn-
 ing toward Peiping for inspira-
 tion, although the more moderate
 25X1 group continues to rely on direc-
 tion from Moscow.
 Trade agreements with Cuba
 provide for an exchange of as
 much as $180,000,000 in 1961--
 far in excess of China's past
 trade with all of Latin America.
 As a rule,  imports from Latin
 America have been limited to a
 single commodity from any one
 country; Chinese purchases have
 thus assumed in some countries
 greater importance than the com-
 paratively modest levels of total
 trade would suggest.   In 1958
 China--which purchased almost
 100,000 tons--was the largest
 single buyer of sugar from Brazil,
 and in the first four months of
 last year it was the largest bloc
 purchaser of wool tops from Uru-
 guay--$2,600,000 worth.
 Peiping's strategy is to
 use trade as an opening for gov-
 ernment-to-government economic
 agreements--in effect de facto
 recognition. To date, however,
 Cuba is the only Latin American
 country that has signed a trade
 and payments agreement  with Com-
 munist China, and, barring polit-
 ical changes in other Latin Amer-
 ican countries, there are no im-
 mediate prospects for others.
 People's Diplomacy
 In 1959, 402 Latin Americans
 traveled to Communist China, with

 the Chinese paying all or part
 of their expenses.   This number
 --three and one-half times the
 total for each of the two preced-
 ing years--was probably at least
 equaled in 1960. Latin American
 visitors to China have included
 parliamentary groups from Brazil,
 Peru, Colombia, and Costa Rica.

 An equal effort is made to
 carry Peiping's message to those
 who cannot make the trip.   The
 "people's diplomacy" offensive
 in South America was launched in
 1956 with the dispatch of a Pei-
 ping Opera group to Brazil, Uru-
 guay, Argentina, and China. Sub-
 sequent travelers,  including
 "friendship teams" of dancers,
 journalists, and acrobats, have
 been well received by the local
 populations, although they en-
 counter considerable governmental
 suspicion.
 The first group of journal-
 ists,  led by an officer from the
 propaganda department of the Chi-
 nese Communist party, organized
 a local friendship association
 in Uruguay and attempted to hire
 a local news reporter for the New
 China News Agency (NCNA). A sec-
 ond group last year was even more
 aggressive--particularly in Chile,
 where it made political state-
 ments attacking the US and cul-
 tivated contacts with labor lead-
 ers and leftist political leaders.
 Friendship organizations
 promoted by the Chinese now op-
 erate in ten Latin American coun-
 tries, and last March an over-all
 China - Latin America Friendship
 Association was formed in Peiping
 to improve area-wide coordina-
 tion.   Peiping uses the friend-
 ship organizations as channels
 for getting propaganda material
 into countries where free entr
 is prohibited.
 SECRET
 Peiping contributes to the
 treasuries of these organizations
 from the earnings of its song-and-
 dance troupes. The Colombian
 Friendship Association got the
 proceeds of the Peiping Opera
 company's performances in Bogota
 last May.
 Propaganda
 Peiping each week broadcasts
 21 hours of Spanish-language pro-
 grams to Latin America and half
 as much in Portuguese. It also
 publishes a Spanish-language edi-
 tion of the propaganda magazine
 China Reconstructs.
 To pick up items of inter-
 est for its radio programs, the
 official NCNA--working through
 the local Communist parties--is
 establishing a network of corre-
 spondents in Latin America; it
 has recruited correspondents in
 Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica,
 Cuba, Panama, Brazil, Colombia,
 Peru, and Venezuela.   The Chinese
 also employ Latin Americans in
 the Peiping headquarters of NCNA
 and the Foreign Languages Press.
 The Havana office of NCNA is
 the center for Peiping's propagan-
 da activities in Latin America.
 After its establishment in June
 1959, the Havana office quickly
 established close relations with
 Castro's new Prensa Latina news
 agency
 In November 1959 the Chinese
 Communists began publication of
 a Chinese-language newspaper in
 Cuba, intended primarily for the
 island's 30,000 Overseas Chinese
 but directed also to the 65,000
 Chinese elsewhere in Latin Amer-
 ica.   Peiping has long competed
 with Taipei for the allegiance
 of Overseas Chinese living
 throughout the world.
 Peiping's propaganda pictures
 the US as the villain in Latin ' Amer-
 ica, intent on plunder and eager to
 support dictators. Peiping alleges
 that a common "subjugation to im-
 perialist aggression and oppres-
 sion" makes the Chinese comrades-
 in-arms of the Latin Americans in the
 fight against US imperialism. Pei-
 ping's propaganda portrays the Lat-
 in Americans as being in the "front
 line" of the anti-US struggle of un-
 derdeveloped countries and points
 to Cuba as proof that their efflrts
 can succeed.
