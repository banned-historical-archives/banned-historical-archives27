 FROM THE NANCHANG UPRISING TO GOING UP THE JINGGANG MOUNTAINS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 2-5
 [Article by Zhu De, written in June 19621
 [Text]                                       I
 In talking about the Nanchang uprising, it is first necessary to look back
 at the history of the first revolutionary civil war.
 In 1923 the third party congress decided that our party would cooperate
 with the Kuomintang [KMT].  In 1924, Dr Sun Yat-sen's KMT, aided by our
 party, the Communist International and the CPSU, formulated a revolu-
 tionary policy to unite with Russia and the communists and to support the
 revolution of peasants and workers and reorganized and formed an alliance
 composed of various democratic classes.  Thus, the first KMT-CCP coopera-
 tion was shaping up, and the great revolution of China was set off.  At
 that time, the KMT's meager resources were nearly exhausted and had to be
 rebuilt.  Therefore, the KMT, out of necessity, cooperated with us in
 order to obtain our assistance.
 During the great revolution in China, the Central Committee of our party
 organized a Military Commission, and the Soviet Union sent military
 advisers to China. The KMT, with the support of our party, founded the
 Huangpu Military Academy, established the National Revolutionary Army and
 reorganized the old army.  When the northern expedition was launched, the
 KMT already had six armies.1  A great number of Communist Party members
 were sent to do political work at the military academy and in the armed
 forces.  In some armies, units from the company level up to the army level
 all had Communist Party members as party representatives.  This fact shows
 that ever since that time, our party began to pay attention to military
 work, to do revolutionary political work in the armed forces, to unite the
 armed forces with the people and to integrate the revolutionary armed
 struggle with the mass struggle.  It was precisely because of this fact
 that the northern expedition swiftly developed with a violent force and
 won a tremendous victory.  The victory was not just something fortuitous.
 It was the result of our party using Marxism-Leninism as a guide and the
 armed forces using the Soviet Red Army of that time as their example.  At
 that time, although our party had neither experience in, nor paid

 sufficient attention to, controlling the armed forces, it did come into
 contact with the problem and began to do something about it.  Therefore,
 in studying the party's military history, it is necessary to begin with
 these basic historical facts.
 Chiang Kai-shek, taking advantage of the mistakes committed by our party's
 rightist opportunist leaders and after mapping out a series of conspiracies,
 at long last betrayed the revolution in April 1927 and carried out massacres
 of the people.  Many workers, peasants and Communist Party members were
 slaughtered.  Wang Jingwei openly turned anticommunist in July and also
 carried out massacres of the people.  Thus, the KMT-CCP cooperation was
 completely broken.  A large number of Communist Party members were purged
 from the northern expedition army.  They had nowhere to turn.  To salvage
 the revolution and cope with the pressing situation, we realized that an
 uprising was the only solution, and the party decided to launch an uprising
 in Nanchang on 1 August.  At that time, there was very little time for
 making and implementing the decision.  As we look back on it now, the timing
 for the uprising was a little too late.
 After the Nanchang uprising, the forces involved in the uprising all went
 south to seek foreign aid in Guangdong's Shantou.  But they were defeated
 in Guangdong's Chaozhou-Shantou area.  An important lesson learned from
 this defeat was that these forces did not unite with Jiangxi's peasant
 movement but went to Guangdong instead.  If these forces had taken advantage
 of the contradictions existing among the warlords themselves and had
 launched peasant movements in various localities in Jiangxi, solved the
 land problem, built revolutionary bases and reorganized their forces, it
 would have been quite possible for them to succeed.
 After the forces involved in the uprising entered Guangdong, they divided
 into two parts.  The main force advanced to the Shantou-Jieyang area while
 the other part commanded by me was stationed in Sanheba.  Upon hearing that
 our main force was attacked by the enemy in Chaozhou and Shantou, we
 immediately marched south to their aid from Sanheba.  Only after we
 arrived at Raoping and met a part of the main force of about 200 men who
 were retreating from the Chaozhou-Shantou area did we learn that our main
 force had been routed and scattered.   Our force, now totaling a little
 over 2,000 men including the 200 from the main force that joined us, turned
 back north and, after engaging an enemy division in the ancient city of
 Wuping, arrived at Tianxinyu in Jiangxi's Anyuan County.  By that time,
 the morale of our men had sunk further.  Our badly battered force, which
 consisted of three parts--one part commanded by Zhou Shi,  one part from
 the main force that pulled out from the Chaozhou-Shantou area and one part
 commanded by me--was in total disarray.  Some had deserted while others
 asked to leave.  Faced with such a situation, we conducted an initial
 reorganization at Tianxinyu, held a soldiers' meeting, explained the
 situation and mission of the revolution and pointed out that the final
 victory would surely be ours, so as to boost morale and steady our confi-
 dence.  After the initial reorganization, we continued our westward march,

 and passing through Xinfeng, we arrived at Dayu at the end of October and
 reorganized our forces.  First, we reorganized the party and CYL organiza-
 tions, set up party branches and organized all our men into a column [zong
 dui 4912 7130] consisting of two subcolumns [dui 7130].  Then we advanced
 to Shangbao in Chongyi County.
 The reorganization and training of the contingent of men that survived the
 Nanchang uprising did not materialize until it arrived at Shangbao.  After
 3 months of marching and fighting since the Nanchang uprising, we did not
 o      find a place to settle down until we arrived in Shangbao.  It gave us some
 time for reorganization and training.  First, we strengthened discipline,
 stipulating that all funds contributed and materials captured must be
 turned over to the public.  Next, we conducted military training.  A major
 training course was conducted every 2 days and regular training was con-
 ducted every day.  To meet objective requirements, new tactics were pro-
 posed.  They mainly dealt with how to turn major battles into minor ones
 by adopting guerrilla warfare and how to change the single-line battle array
 into the wedge-shaped battle array.  Of course, all this was only in the
 embryonic stage.  It was Chairman Mao who later systematically and com-
 pletely solved guerrilla warfare and even the entire strategic problem.
 Thanks to. the reorganization and training, our forces were united, their
 discipline strengthened and their combat effectiveness enhanced.  Mean-
 while, a battalion, commanded by Wu Zhonghao, of the worker-peasant army
 directly led by Chairman Mao, joined us in our reorganization and training.
 Prior to the Nanchang uprising, Fan Shisheng's 16th Army stationed in
 southern Hunan had maintained a united front relationship with our party,
 and our party had also maintained organizations in the 16th Army.   Fan
 Shisheng had also intended to join our incursion into Guangdong.  After
 the Nanchang uprising and the incursion of our forces into Guangdong,
 Comrade Zhou Enlai wrote us a letter of introduction which would be
 presented to Fan Shisheng's troops if and when we could make contact with
 them.  Fan Shisheng was an old acquaintance of mine.  We were schoolmates
 in the Yunnan army training school and took part in the 1911 revolution
 together.  After we arrived at Shangbao, Fan Shisheng sent Wei Bocui, a
 Communist Party member working among his troops, to contact us in the hope
 of cooperating with us.  After the matter was discussed in our party
 organization, we agreed to cooperate with him and signed an agreement.
 After that, our troops moved to Rucheng in southern Hunan and cooperated
 with Fan Shisheng's troops.  We disguised ourselves under a falsified
 regimental designation of his troops.
 Our cooperation with Fan Shisheng was conditional.  The terms were agreed
 upon during the talks.  We were communist troops, thus at any time our
 party wanted us to leave, we had to leave.  We had complete control over
 all supplies Fan Shisheng provided us.  We held the sole power to decide
 the internal organization and training of our troops, and Fan Shisheng
 would never interfere.  In fact, all these conditions were honored.  For

 instance, when we entered Guangdong's Renhua, we still cracked down on local
 tyrants and killed several landlords and local tyrants.  Another example,
 in preparation for the southern Hunan insurrection, we held a meeting in
 Rucheng of party secretaries of county party committees under the jurisdic-
 tion of Hengyang to discuss and plan for the insurrection.  Still another
 example, when Huang Shaoxiong was about to attack Fan's troops, Fan wanted
 us to be his rear guard; we replenished our supplies with the great amount
 of materials left behind by Fan's troops.  All this showed that we could
 decide our own actions without restrictions set by anyone else.
 Our cooperation with Fan Shisheng was of great benefit to us.  First, we
 could lie low for awhile (I used an assumed name Wang Kai), catch our
 breath for reorganization and bide our time for another chance.  Second,
 we could replenish our supplies.  During our cooperation, he gave us 2
 months' pay and replenished our bedding, clothing and ammunition.  When we
 left, he gave us several tens of thousands of dollars in cash for our
 travel expenses.  In December 1927, we received our party's directive to
 support the Guangzhou uprising.   While still on our way to Guangzhou, we
 heard that the uprising had failed, and we stayed in Shaoguan.  Not long
 afterwards, we left Fan's troops and entered southern Hunan to organize
 the southern Hunan insurrection.  On the eve of our departure, Fan Shisheng
 wrote us a letter to express his sincerity.  I can still recall the gist of
 that letter:  1) "Who can so unite it?  He who has no pleasure in killing
 can so unite it."2  2) To prevent losses to your troops, it was better for
 you to take the main route instead of trails.  3) Final victory belongs to
 you, but at present I cannot help you, although I would very much like
 to do so.
 After leaving Fan's troops, we traveled north from Shaoguan, with a plan to
 find a base area in southern Hunan.  At that time, Gong Chu3 joined our
 unit.  He led the way and took us to Yangjiazhaizi in Yizhang County where
 Chairman Yang Zida of the Yizhang County peasant association lived.  He
 played an important role in letting us stay at Yangjiazhaizi.
 After reaching Yangjiazhaizi, we decided to organize an insurrection in
 Yizhang County.  In the county, there was a person by the name of Hu
 Shaohai who formerly served as battalion commander under Cheng Qian's
 command and who was known to the local evil gentry.  One day in mid-January
 1928, we informed Hu Shaohai that we were going to have our troops
 masquerade as a unit of the National Revolutionary Army and move to the
 seat of the Yizhang County government.  When members of the local evil
 gentry heard of Hu Shaohai leading troops back, they came out of the city
 to greet us, welcomed our troops into the city and invited us to dinner.
 At the dinner, we arrested all the members of the evil gentry and govern-
 ment officials and launched the Yizhang insurrection.  Following the
 insurrection, we promptly set up the Yizhang County soviet government and
 founded the 1st Division of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army,
 thus firing the first shot in the southern Hunan insurrection.

 After the Yizhang insurrection, Xu Kexiang, an executioner in the Mari
 incident, came with his troops from Pingshi to attack us.  Our comrades and
 the broad masses hated Xu Kexiang to the marrow of their bones.  After
 hearing of fighting against Xu Kexiang, their morale was unprecedentedly
 high and they vied with one another in participating in the fight.  Xu
 Kexiang deployed his six regiments of troops in a long line, which made it
 easy for us to wipe out his regiments one by one.  Thus, once we engaged
 his troops, we quickly routed an advance regiment of his troops and then
 pursued and attacked the rest of his troops.  In the pursuit, we crushed
 all.of his six regiments one by one.  When we pursued Xu Kexiang and his
 troops to Pingshi, his troops were thrown into great confusion and were
 utterly routed.  Pingshi was a gorge where there were no crossroads.  The
 enemy troops could flee only along the gorge.  So we kept pursuing them
 to the bank of Lechang River where we had to stop.  This battle was fought
 excellently.  We captured many enemy troops, some of whom joined our unit.
 At Pingshi in particular, we-captured all Xu Kexiang's warehouses and
 replenished and armed ourselves with materials and weapons in the ware-
 houses.  We seized not only machineguns but mortars and artillery pieces
 as well.  It can be said that Xu Kexiang helped us to build up.
 The good news of wiping out Xu Kexiang's troops soon got around in southern
 Hunan.  Local party organizations in southern Hunan's various counties
 contacted us and asked us to build local armed forces.  We supported them
 in doing so.  We first helped Yizhang County organize a local regiment.
 After taking Chenzhou, we then helped Chenzhou organize a local regiment.
 Later, we successively captured the county seats of Leiyang, Zixing,
 Yongxing, Guidong and Rucheng and also launched insurrections in Chaling,
 Anren and Lingxian.  The masses in 11 counties went into action and
 organized their local armed forces.  Under the leadership of local party
 organizations, these local armed forces overthrew local tyrants and-evil
 gentry as well as the local reactionary governments and set up soviet
 governments.  This is what the southern Hunan insurrection in early 1928
 was about (called the year-end insurrection at that time).
 The southern Hunan insurrection took place at a time when a war had broken
 out between warlords Bai Chongxi and Tang Shengzhi.   So the situation was
 favorable for us.  If the policy and line had been correct, it would have
 been possible for us to continue to exploit the victory and to consolidate
 our position in some localities under the given conditions.  However, the
 erroneous left-putschist line alienated the masses from us, thus isolating
 us.  As a result, the revolutionary forces had to withdraw from southern
 Hunan shortly after the insurrection.
 The troops we saved from the Nanchang uprising and the local armed forces
 in southern Hunan successfully joined forces with the Workers' and Peasants'
 Revolutionary Army under Chairman Mao's direct leadership at Longshi,
 Ninggang County, on 28 April 1928.   On 4 May, we held a grand joining-
 forces meeting at Lonshi and announced the founding of the 4th Corps of
 the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army (the corps was redesignated

 as the 4th Red Army later).  The main force of our Workers' and Peasants'
 Red Army had since grown in.strength and become stronger and stronger with
 each passing day.  It scored many important victories in the struggle to
 consolidate and develop the base area in Jinggangshan.
 After we joined forces, we won the first battle in early May 1928 when a
 unit of the 4th Red Army wiped out a battalion of the enemy's 27th Division
 under Yang Ruxuan's command near Huangao.  Following that, this unit put
 an enemy regiment to rout along the Wudu River.  Our troops pursued and
 attacked enemy troops in the wake of victory and captured Yongxin city far
 the first time.  During this battle, our troops wiped out and routed three
 enemy regiments.
 In late May 1928, the enemy troops under Yang Ruxuan's command launched an
 attack on us from Yongxin.  Our 28th Regiment went to the aid of a battalion
 which was sent to Chaling, Hunan, for newsprint and had not yet returned to
 Jinggangshan at that time.  After learning of the enemy attack, the regiment
 made a rapid march back to Caoshiao, 15 li from Yongxin city, and wiped out
 a battalion of the enemy's 79th Regiment by attacking it from the rear.
 Hu Zidang, commander of the enemy regiment, was killed on the spot.  The
 enemy troops fled helter-skelter, and we pursued them to Yongxin city.  It
 was said that Yang Ruxuan was listening to a phonograph record when our
 troops stormed into the city and killed his foreign-bred dog.  He was
 wounded by a stray bullet while climbing over the city wall to flee.  Thus,
 we took Yongxin city for the second time.  We seized a lot of booty,
 including more than 50,000 silver dollars. The following morning we
 withdrew from Yongxin city on our own initiative.
 Nearly 10 regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Hunan and Jiangxi
 launched an attack on Jinggangshan in June 1928.  The enemy used the three
 regiments under Yang Ruxuan's command as the main attack force to attack
 our positions at Laoqixiling.  Two regiments under Yang Chisheng's command
 launched a secondary attack on our positions at Xinqixiling.  The 29th
 Regiment and a battalion of the 31st Regiment were assigned to defend
 Xinqixiling and the 28th Regiment was given the task of defending
 Laoqixiling.  The fighting started before dawn on 22 June 1928 (the Dragon
 Boat Festival fell on that day) and lasted until dark.  At noon, our 28th
 Regiment defending Laogixiling first put to rout the main attack force of
 three enemy regiments which fled in disorder toward Yongxin city.  At this
 time, our 29th Regiment and a battalion of the 31st Regiment defending
 Xinqixiling also launched a counterattack and forced the enemy troops to
 retreat in disorder.  These enemy troops attempted to flee through
 Longyuankou, but our 28th Regiment outflanked, them there, thus cutting off
 their retreat and annihilating most of them.  Our troops pursued the
 enemy troops to Yongxin and took the city for the third time.  Thus, we
 smashed the siege by the enemy.  These are the well-known great victories
 won at Qixiling and Longyuankou.

 BUILD A STRONG MODERN REVOLUTIONARY ARMY--IN COMMEMORATION OF THE 55TH
 ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 6-10
 [Article by Yang Shangkun]
 [Text]  Since the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in
 1927, it has experienced a career of 55 years of glorious fighting.
 Party leaders, including great Marxist and proletarian strategist Mao
 Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi and Zhu De rendered indelible services to
 the founding and development of the PLA.  As the 55th anniversary of the
 founding of our army draws near, all commanders and fighters of the army,
 while recalling the past eventful years, cherish with boundless feelings
 the memory of proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation who bent
 their backs for the cause of liberation of the people of all nationalities
 throughout the country until their dying day and of innumerable revolu-
 tionary martyrs.
 Just as the resolution unanimously approved by the 6th Plenary Session of
 the 11th CPC Central Committee pointed out,,the Chinese revolution was
 victorious mainly because we relied on a people's army led by the CPC; an
 army of a completely new type and enjoying flesh-and-blood ties with the
 people, to defeat a formidable. enemy through protracted people's war.
 History has proved that without such an army, the people would have
 nothing and it would have been impossible to achieve the liberation of our
 people and the independence of our country.
 Today, the people of the whole country are pleased to see that the PLA--a
 people's army--has undergone new development and improvement in the new
 historical conditions, developing from a purely land force into a composite
 force that includes air and naval forces and other technical branches.
 Apart from being equipped with excellent conventional weapons produced by
 China itself, we also possess sophisticated strategic weapons such as
 atomic and hydrogen bombs and LRBM's for self-defense.  It can be predicted
 that on the basis of the further development of the national economy, the
 degree of modernization of the PLA is sure to be further enhanced.

 It is gratifying to note that in recent years, especially since Chairman
 Deng Xiaoping presided over the work of the Military Commission of the CPC
 Central Committee, new major progress has been made in PLA building and in
 various aspects, such as military, political and rear service work.  Under
 the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and its Military Commission,
 the whole army has conscientiously studied and implemented the various
 principles and policies of the party.  The army has paid special attention
 to implementing the guidelines of the 3d and 6th Plenary Sessions of the
 11th CPC Central Committee, guiding the troops to more conscientiously
 uphold the four basic principles and unifying the ideas on the basis of the
 basic conclusion of the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of
 Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC."  While constantly eliminating the
 influence remaining from the "leftist" guiding ideology, the whole army has
 resolutely repudiated and overcome bourgeois liberalization and other
 erroneous ideological tendencies so that the troops' political conscious-
 ness and understanding of policy have been markedly raised.  The various
 PLA units have extensively launched an activity of building socialist
 spiritual civilization centering on having ideals, paying attention to
 morality and observing discipline.  A large number of new people of the
 Lei Feng type have emerged.  Quite a few PLA units have penetratingly
 conducted patriotic education. characterized by the principle that state
 interests are above everything.  This has played a marked role in heighten-
 ing the sense of national self-respect and pride and in understanding the
 superiority of China's socialist system.   In the struggles to resist
 natural disasters in some areas of the country, the numerous cadres and
 fighters have, with their own practical actions, fulfilled the aim of army
 building--wholehearted service to the people--and forged closer links
 between the army and government and between the army and people.  The
 various activities, such as building the army on a regular basis and con-
 ducting military and political training, have improved sense of discipline
 and organization and have effectively raised combat effectiveness.  The
 military exercises successfully held in north China and in a few other
 areas have marked our army's step forward in improving the capability of
 concerted operations among various branches of the armed forces and. in
 employing the means of modern warfare.  Vigorously supported by the broad
 masses of the people, our army has triumphantly fulfilled the tasks of
 defending our coastline and frontiers, the tranquility of our motherland
 and the four modernizations drive.  The victories in battles of self-
 defense at the Fakashan and Koulinshan Mountains have added new glories
 to the 1 August army flag.  All this has proved that the PLA created and
 led by the CPC and armed with Mao Zedong Thought is a completely trust-
 worthy powerful people's armed force with fine training and strong combat
 effectiveness.  The cadres and fighters of the army are most obedient to
 the party and people and go wherever the party directs them.  The com-
 manders and fighters fight where there is greatest hardship and danger.
 This PRC armed force, that belongs to and is loyal to the people, is like
 a steel great wall reliably defending our people's peaceful labor and
 socialist modernization.
 Recalling the 55 years of the army's history, one could say it is a history
 of progressing., from small to big, from weak to strong, and from "millet

 plus rifles" to the building of a modern revolutionary army.  Under the
 guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we attach importance to the decisive role
 of the human factor in war, but we never overlook the important role of
 weapons, We lay stress on defeating with inferior equipment an enemy
 equipped with superior weapons and we constantly strive, where objective
 conditions permit, to improve the army's capability of fighting modern
 warfare and push forward army building.  As far back as during the infant
 period of the Red Army, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:  "We oppose efforts
 to halt the Red Army at the old stage and strive to develop the Red Army
 to a new stage."  In the early period of the war of resistance against
 Japan, when there was an extremely great disparity in strength between the
 enemy and ourselves, Comrade  Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Protracted
 War":  "The reform of our military system requires its modernization and
 improved technical equipment, without which we cannot drive the enemy back
 across the Yalu River."  Later, on many occasions, he again said:  The
 Chinese army should also gradually be provided with modern technology,
 equipment and specifically military attainments.  The great foresight of
 the party leader and the unflagging revolutionary drive of the numerous
 cadres and fighters ensured that, even under extremely difficult condi-
 tions, our army always made every effort to improve the combat capability
 of the troops.  In those years, when the poorly equipped worker and
 peasant Red Army, hemmed in by massive enemy troops, succeeded in seizing
 from the enemy the first radio transceiver, they took good care of it and,
 after assiduously learning how to operate it in a very short time, employed
 it in directing operations on the battlefront.  When many fighters were
 still fighting with indigenous rifles, broadswords and spears, our army
 simply and thriftily set up an artillery school with the few guns we
 seized from the enemy.  As far back as in the liberation war period, our
 army already had its own aviation school and armored troops.  These
 scenes of assiduously doing pioneering work remain fresh in our memory as
 if they were before us now.  Our army has always refused to be self-
 satisfied and conservative or to halt its efforts at the initial stages but
 instead, where the objective conditions permit, fully bring into play the
 subjective initiative in an effort to guide the army building to a higher
 stage.  It is still necessary for us to constantly promote this extremely
 invaluable revolutionary drive in the new historical period.
 Lenin said:  "When an army is not prepared to master all weapons and all
 forms and methods of struggle the enemy has possessed or may possess, this
 act is considered stupid by everybody else."  Modern military science and
 technology are changing with each passing day.  Since the fruits of the
 world's latest science and technology are extensively applied in war, a
 whole series of changes has taken place in the forms of war, strategy,
 tactics and military organization.  Many unprecedented new situations and
 special features have appeared in modern warfare.  Hence, in an inter-
 national situation in which the danger. of war still exists, we must
 greatly step up the building of a modern national defense and raise the
 army's modern combat capability to a new level.  When reviewing the troops
 taking part in military exercises somewhere in north China, Deng Xiaoping,
 chairman of the Military Commission of the CPC Central Committee, more
 explicitly pointed out:  It is necessary to.build our army into a strong,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 modern and regular revolutionary army.  With full confidence, the comrades'.
 of the whole army are unremittingly fighting for the realization of this
 great goal along with the people throughout the country.
 At present, under the guidance of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC
 Central Committee, the work of readjustment, restructuring, consolidation
 and improvement is being continuously carried out on the economic front
 and marked achievements have been scored.  Following the Central Committee's
 unified guiding principle on carrying out system reforms, the PLA is right
 now working hard to readjust, reorganize and restructure itself and-advance
 toward the great goal of revolutionization, modernization and regulariza-
 tion.
 In the course of readjusting and restructuring the army, it is imperative
 to build the troops into a revolutionized and modern crack force in
 accordance with the requirements of modern warfare.  Comrade Mao Zedong
 said:  "That the troops are valued for their quality, not their number, is
 still a principle of army building in the future."  During the arduous
 years of the anti-Japanese war, our party rigorously practiced the policy
 of better troops and simpler administration, reduced the number of non-
 combat personnel and lightened the burden of the people.  This resulted in
 speeding up the victorious course of war.  In. the early period of the
 founding of the PRC, we carried out the policy decision of reducing the
 number of armymen and improving the quality of the army so that it was
 possible for our army to establish various branches and thus strengthened
 the combat effectiveness of our army.  Although the specific conditions
 were slightly different in various historical periods, the principle that
 troops are valued for their quality and not their number still holds good.
 Now people have come to realize that the trial of strength in a war mani-
 fests not only in the number of soldiers but, more importantly, in modern
 weapons and equipment and in people's capability to operate modern equip-
 ment.  With the swift development of modern science and technology, there
 is indeed a tremendous increase in the power of weapons.  Following
 improvement in the level of modern weapons, equipment and the command
 system, it is entirely possible to appropriately reduce the number of
 soldiers.  Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:  A reduction and not an
 increase in manpower is a sign of modernization.  It can thus be seen that
 practicing the policy of better troops is not a negative or stagnant policy
 but a positive and advanced one.  The policy of better troops is a correct
 and scientific policy which conforms to the specific features of modern
 warfare and the law of development of modern military affairs.
 By a crack force, from the major aspects, we mainly mean the following
 three demands:  1) There must be people with high political awareness,
 advanced military thinking and relatively high scientific and cultural
 accomplishment, and all readjustment and restructuring measures must be
 beneficial for discovering, selecting and promoting talented people and
 for making the cadre force revolutionized, younger and more knowledgeable
 and specialized.  2) There must be excellent modern weapons and equipment.
 3) There must be organic integration of men and arms, which means that
 there must be strict training and scientific formation.  After a period of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9
 arduous efforts by the comrades of the whole army, our army will be a crack
 force with keen wits and capable administrative structure, agile command,
 excellent equipment, fine training, quick reactions, high efficiency, and
 very powerful combat effectiveness, and be a hand-picked force that cannot
 be toppled or defeated.  It will be a sharp sword defending the socialist
 motherland.
 Human factors still play a primary role in modern warfare.  However, it is
 necessary to understand human factors in an all-round way.  They include
 not only human courage, consciousness and the spirit of sacrifice but also
 human wisdom, and talent as well as mastery and application of science,
 culture and technology.  All modern equipment, even such high-tech equip-
 ment as electronic calculators, reconnaissance satellites and spaceships,
 should also be. operated by man.  No precision and advanced weapons can hit
 the targets with unfailing accuracy.  Of these, the scientific and techno-
 logical levels of the operators are very important factors.  The political
 consciousness of the PLA in undoubtedly first-rate in the world.  In the
 future, it is still necessary to regard political work as the lifeline of
 our army, strive to build socialist spiritual civilization and conduct
 patriotic education centering on loving the party, the socialist motherland
 and the people's army in order to raise the political quality of our army
 to a new level.  It should be noted, however, that the scientific, cultural
 and technological level of our. cadres still fails to keep abreast of the
 requirements of modern warfare.  If we fail to speedily change this state
 of affairs, we shall not be able to skillfully master and proficiently
 operate more up-to-date equipment, let alone bring its efficiency into full
 play.  Therefore, an urgent question confronting us is to vigorously step
 up the work of making our cadres master intellectual knowledge.  The status
 and role of science, culture and technology in army building is becoming
 more and more important and outstanding.  In particular, the intensive
 application of science in modern weapons and the ever-changing progress of
 modern science such as electronics, laser, infrared rays and spaceflight
 have made it necessary for us to study new knowledge and new technology
 and to arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge.  There is the
 importance of knowledge on the one hand and the deficiency of knowledge on
 the other.  This is an acute contradiction.  Quite a few comrades under-
 stand the importance and urgency of solving this contradiction.  At the
 beginning of this century, Lenin wrote a commentary entitled "The Fall of
 Port Arthur."  This famous article vividly described and penetratingly
 elaborated the defeat suffered by the czarist Russian army in its war
 against the Japanese army.  Lenin pointed out that although czarist Russia
 had squandered hundreds of millions of rubles on the purchase and building
 of splendid warships, in view of the fact that both the officers and
 soldiers proved "uneducated" and "backward" and "that there were no people
 with the necessary technical knowledge to utilize the latest achievements
 of military engineering," the military might of czarist Russia "proved to
 be a sham" and those expenditures "proved to be antiquated and utterly
 useless."  All this shows how important scientific and cultural knowledge
 is to the modernization of the army.  It is hoped that our cadres, particu-
 larly the leading cadres, will attach great importance to this increasingly
 urgent problem.  From now on they should regard it as a matter of great

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 strategic importance, concentrate their efforts on it and make sure that
 the scientific and cultural appearance of our army will change considerably
 in the coming years.
 The CPC Central Committee recently decided that in the coming 5 years or so,
 all cadres working in the central party and government institutions should
 at least reach senior middle school level culturally and middle vocational
 school level professionally and that there should be a considerable number
 of people who have university level.  From now on, cadres who do not come
 up to the stipulated level cannot be transferred to the central party and
 government institutions; the existing cadres who do not come up to the
 stipulated level should manage to reach this level within a stated time
 through study and rotational training.  This guideline is likewise
 applicable to our army.  Moreover, as far as the needs for army building
 are concerned, we should act more quickly and do better.
 Both men and arms must excel in building a crack force.  In the context of
 requirements for opposing a future war of aggression, we still lag behind
 in weapons and equipment.  We must at all times carry forward the army's
 fine combat traditions and establish strong confidence and resolve in
 defeating with inferior weapons an enemy armed with superior weapons.
 Under the conditions of national economic capabilities, we must also step
 up national defense scientific research work, strive to improve our arms
 and equipment and reduce our discrepancies in this respect to the minimum.
 In his article "On the Ten Major Relationships" Comrade Mao Zedong pointed
 out:  "We are stronger than before and will be stronger still in the
 future.  We will not only have more planes and artillery but atom bombs
 too.  If we are not to be bullied in the present-day world, we cannot do
 without the bomb."  What Comrade Mao Zedong predicted has initially come
 true.  We will certainly be able to equip our units with newer weapons as
 our national economy and military science and technology develop.  With
 further improvement in the level of modernization, the long-tested PLA will
 be like a tiger that has grown wings and will be in a better position to
 defeat all aggressors who dare to launch a war against us.  Workers,
 peasants and the comrades in scientific, technological, educational and
 various other circles in our country will exert themselves and, in their
 own respective posts, make more contributions to the modernization of
 national defense and the people's own army.
 Arms, including all modern arms, are only potential fighting force, they
 can only become actual fighting force when closely integrated with men.
 Apart from strict training, this also requires scientific formation.  It
 takes a, lot of learning to more scientifically and rationally form the army
 according to the requirements of modern warfare.  At present, a great many
 countries attach great importance to the study of military systems.
 Following new developments in modern warfare, military formation has also
 appropriately been reformed.  For example, since World War II, some coun-
 tries have abolished cavalry units and established air defense forces and
 strategic rocket forces; some countries have changed the "three three
 system" of the ground forces into the "five mass system [wu qun zhi 0063
 5028 0455]: and some countries have increased electronics confrontation

 showing that military formations should adapt to the objective situation in
 the way that people change their clothes according to changes in season.
 We must broaden our vision of breaking away from the fetters of the force
 of habit and daring to conduct reforms and be promoters of reforms.
 The most important thing in the scientific formation of the armed forces
 is to strengthen their synthesis.  Without the synthesis of the various
 branches of the armed forces, there would be no modernization and it would
 have been impossible to adapt ourselves to modern warfare.  For a consid-
 erably long historical period, our army has chiefly relied on a single
 branch of the armed forces in fighting and a lot of comrades have been
 familiar with infantry.  However, in order to direct a combined operation
 of various branches of the armed forces, it is still necessary to study
 assiduously and conscientiously.  Reviewing the history of our army, we have
 already taken two steps, the first step consisting of concentrating only
 on infantry, and the second of independently developing various branches
 of the armed forces.  We should now take a third step, which is to better
 strengthen the synthesis of the various branches.  Since the founding of the
 PRC, we have established various branches of the armed forces, such as the
 air force, navy, artillery troops, engineer troops and armored troops, but
 they basically formed a system of their own and we have not been able to
 organically combine them together either in system, training or administra-
 tion.  If this state of affairs continues to exist, it will be difficult to
 adapt to the needs of modern warfare.
 Comrade Ye Jianying has summed up the characteristics of modern warfare as:
 three-dimensional warfare, combined warfare, and general warfare.  As we
 understand it, what is referred to as three-dimensional warfare is that as
 soon as a war breaks out, the enemy is sure to come simultaneously from the
 sky, land and sea and fight both at the front and in the rear.  What is
 referred to as combined warfare is that war has developed from operations
 by a single branch of the armed forces or small-scale and limited-range
 concerted operations in the past to large-scale, extensive-range and com-
 plete combined warfare.  What is meant by general warfare is that war is
 not only a trial of military strength but also a general trial of strength
 of various war factors, such as politics, economy, science, technology and
 diplomacy.  These special features of modern warfare fully show that it is
 imperative to strengthen the synthesis of the army, practice combined
 operations by various branches of the armed forces and bring into full
 play their overall might; it is imperative for armymen and people through-
 out the country to make concerted efforts and launch a people's war under
 the modern conditions in order to defeat the enemy.  We must therefore
 greatly step up composite training.  Every commander, especially the com-
 manders of composite forces must be familiar with the capabilities of all
 types of weapons and learn how to employ the various technical branches of
 the armed forces in coordination.  At the same time they must also under-
 stand, as much as possible, other branches of knowledge related to war.
 We must further change the idea of having just one branch of the armed
 forces and establish the concept of composite warfare.  This is a profound
 change.  Lenin said:  "In our practical life there are both the feature of
 extraordinary courage and the mentality of fearing extremely small changes."

 We should not be afraid of, but should be bold in, making reforms.  We
 should actively support all reforms that are conducive to the strengthen-
 ing of synthesis.
 In making readjustment and reforms, it is necessary to take into consid-
 eration not only peacetime but also wartime and do a good job of linking
 peacetime with wartime.  In doing everything, such as what is to be
 initiated, what is to be reformed, what is to be readjusted and how
 should we do our work in order of importance and urgency, it is necessary
 to have war preparedness in mind for this helps us to be always alert and
 ready to strike at the enemy who dares to invade us.  Political and
 ideological education must be geared in such a way that it ensures the
 fulfillment of readjustment as well as educates the troops to firmly foster
 the idea of war preparedness.  We should also further step up work on the
 militia and do a good job of the reserve service and mobilization systems.
 If the enemy dares to invade us, we shall engulf it in the boundless ocean
 of the people with people's war under the modern conditions.
 Fewer troops and simpler administration are always interrelated and go hand
 in hand.  In order to have crack troops it is imperative to have simpler
 administration.  It is imperative to improve work style in order to achieve
 the goal of improving work efficiency and command capability.  It is neces-
 sary to implement the principle of integrating centralized and unified
 leadership with division of responsibility, put responsibility systems on a
 sound basis, reduce the number of command levels, and further define the
 scope of responsibilities of leading organs at all levels.  Leading organs
 at the higher levels should chiefly understand developments and have a good
 grasp of policies.  Principal attention should be paid to grasping problems
 related to policies, implementing the policies and principles laid down by
 the CPC Central Committee and its Military Commission, conducting investiga-
 tion and study, summing up experiences and supervising and speeding up ful-
 fillment of assigned work.  We should not take on the detailed routine work
 that should be handled by the institutions at the lower levels for this will
 not only make it difficult for us to do our work well but will also be
 unfavorable to bringing into play the initiative of the lower levels.  It
 is also unfavorable to overcoming bureaucratism, routinism and the methods
 of working in a handicraft manner and to improving work efficiency.  We
 advocate that leading cadres at various levels should, within the scope
 of their duties, be bold in taking responsibility and work boldly.  If a
 person is responsible for the work, he should be responsible for it to the
 end.  We should change the past phenomena, such as unclear definition of
 duties incumbent to each person or post, inexplicit division of labor,
 ?       multiple command levels, mutual shift of responsibility, the travel of
 documents from one department to another, long delays in making decisions
 and passing on difficulties to the leadership.  We should consult others
 on our own initiative on all matters that should be consulted and we
 should independently, responsibly and on our own initiative solve well the
 problems that we can solve.
 Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:   "Having a clear understanding of China's
 national condition is a fundamental basis for having a clear understanding

 of all revolutionary problems."  Just as all things in the world have both
 their general and specific characteristics, army building in various coun-
 tries of the world has its general characteristic, but it also has its own
 special characteristics.  It is necessary for the economic construction to
 suit our national conditions, and it is also necessary for army building to
 suit our national conditions.   China has the biggest population in the,
 world.  It has a vast territory, long coastline and highly different
 natural conditions.  It is necessary for us to conscientiously study modern
 military theory and foreign military experience.  At the same time, it is
 all the more necessary for us to conscientiously study our national condi-
 tions, learn and study the application and development of Mao Zedong's
 military thinking in modern conditions, study the inregration of people's
 war with modern conditions and seek an army system that suits China's
 specific features and the principles of various types of army building.
 It is necessary for us to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of
 our army, constantly study new developments, solve new problems and push
 forward our army building in a down-to-earth manner.
 Today, the great task of achieving the four modernizations in our great
 socialist motherland is calling on us.  Stepping on the land of our mother-
 land and bearing the expectations of the people, the workers' and peasants'
 Red Army, the Eighth Route Army and the new Fourth Army in those years
 boldly and heroically headed for the battlefield in seeking liberation.
 In order to build our army into a strong, modern and regular revolutionary
 army, let us learn from the example of the older generations and, under the
 leadership of the CPC Central Committee and its Military Commission,
 advance bravely.

 A CRACK FORCE THAT DEFENDED THE PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THE SHAANXI-
 GANSU-NINGXIA BORDER REGION--REMINISCENCES OF THE REAR CORPS OF THE EIGHTH
 ROUTE ARMY DURING THE WAR OF RESISTANCE AGAINST JAPAN
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15,.1 Aug 82 pp 11-15
 [Article by Xiao Jingguang [5618 0513 0342]]
 [Text]  During the second half of 1937, the Japanese aggressor troops were
 swollen with arrogance and threatened to eliminate China within 3 months.
 several hundred thousand of the KMT troops on the battlefields of North China
 became terror-stricken at the news and retreated in defeat again and again.
 To rescue China from national crisis, our party established the anti-Japanese
 National United Front.  The Chinese workers' and peasants' Red Army the the
 Red Army in the northern part of Shaanxi were redesignated as the 115th Divi-
 sion, 120th Division and 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army after they
 had successfully accomplished the task of the long march and arrived at the
 northern part of Shaanxi Province.  They marched to the forefront of resist-
 ing Japanese troops and penetrated far behind enemy lines to establish anti-
 Japanese democratic base areas and shoulder historical tasks of resisting
 Japan and rescuing the nation.  To defend the party Central Committee and
 nation's anti-Japanese supreme headquarters--the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border
 area, the Luochuan meeting of the party Central Committee decided to release
 some troops from the three main divisions to form a rear corps of the Eighth
 Route Army.
 The rear corps formed in September 1937 was initially called the rear office
 of the Eighth Route Army.  The name was changed into rear corps in December
 of the same year.  The rear corps were made up of 1 brigade, 11 regiments and
 peace preservation troops which were formerly local armed forces.  There were
 about 10,000 people in the force.  At that time, there were only 3 leaders
 who were assigned to the rear corps.   I was a commander and concurrently
 political commissar, Comrade Cao Lihuai was chief of staff and Comrade Mo
 Wenhua was director of the political department.  No positions of deputies
 were set and our organ was small but highly efficient.  All of united as one.
 Thanks to the loving care and direct leadership of the military commission of
 the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, our corps was gradually
 built into a crack force which was good in political quality and powerful in
 combat strength and which'achieved outstanding results in eliminating bandit

 gangs, resisting the Japanese troops, counter-campaigning against friction and
 accomplishing glorious historical tasks of defending the border area, the
 northwestern part of our country and the party Central Committee.  Our corps
 also provided various anti-Japanese battlefields throughout the country with
 more than 2,000 cadres to support their anti-Japanese struggle.  I personally
 experienced a life of fiery struggle at that time.  Today when I recall the
 life, I feel that I still yearn for it.
 The rear corps was made up of troops from various quarters, including the
 first, second and fourth front armies of the Red Army, the.Red Army in the
 northern part of Shaanxi Province and local armed forces.  They truly came
 from all corners of the country.  Our crack force was good in quality and most
 of its members had undergone the long march and grown in the environment of
 fierce struggle.  Communist Party members formed a large proportion of the
 members of the troops.   Cadres and fighters had a higher political conscious-
 ness and acquired the spirit and fine traditions of staunch and hard struggles.
 However, due to the fact that members of the corps came from various base areas
 which followed different systems and work styles, there existed the problem of
 chaotic organizational system, roving guerrilla actions, lax discipline and so
 forth.  The phenomenon of lacking unity occurred from time to time.  Under such
 circumstances, it was our tremendous task to build the rear corps into a regu-
 lar troop with powerful combat effectiveness.                             -
 Comrade Mao Zedong directly concerned himself with the building of the rear
 corps and frequently asked about its work.  Although he was occupied with a
 myriad of state affairs and was extremely busy, he always managed to find time
 to listen to our reports and discussed with us the work of the troops.  He
 frequently met leading comrades of various regiments in order to grasp the
 situation and issue instructions for work.  He concerned himself with the
 consolidation, life, study, combat and production of the troops as well as the
 formulation of some rules and regulations and took up these matters personally.
 When I once made a work report on how to grasp the work of building this
 corps, he told me cordially that the key to turning this army, which was made
 up of fighters from various quarters with lax discipline, into an unconquer-
 able and indomitable regular corps with powerful combat effectiveness, lay in
 whether r7.e could act in accordance with the spirit of the Gutian Congress.
 We acted in line with the direction pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong.  First
 of all, we firmly grasped the link of political and ideological education.
 At the end of 1937 and in July 1938 we respectively held the first and
 second meetings attended by leaders of the corps.  At the end of 1938, we con-
 vened the first party congress of the corps and in May 1939, we held a meeting
 attended by cadres above battalion level.   In October of the same year, a
 political work meeting was also convened.   In the above-mentioned meetings,
 we stressed that we should take the ideological and political work of the
 party as the key link, take part in the two great campaigns of "production
 and study" and accomplish the four main tasks in"politics, military affairs,
 culture and the party's work."  We put forth the slogan of "doing our best to
 carry out the campaign of study and build the troops into a combat school."

 A regular political and educational system was established in the corps and
 all fighters were required to take four political classes each week and cadres
 extensively organized their study groups.  Our purposes in providing politi-
 cal and ideological education were 1) to guide cadres and fighters to study
 Marxist theories with the "History of the Soviet Communist Party (Bolshevik)"
 and the "Political Textbook" compiled by the political department of the corps
 as our main teaching materials; 2) to study further the party's theories on
 the united front and various guiding principles and policies as well as cur-
 rent affairs.  To strengthen the study of political theories and culture.,
 teachers in charge of the teaching of Marxist-Leninist theories and Mao Zedong
 works were assigned to various regiments and teachers in charge of the teach-
 ing of cultural knowledge were assigned to various companies..  We also pub-
 lished the "Fenghuo Bao" and the "Fenghuo Supplement" and established the
 Fenghuo Opera Troupe and art school to enliven the cultural life of the corps.
 After several years' of political and ideological education, and the great
 movement for party consolidation in particular, cadres Marxist-Leninist
 level and class consciousness was considerably raised and various nonprole-
 tarian ideologies and work styles were continuously discarded.  This laid a
 reliable foundation for regularizing and strengthening the combat effective-
 ness of the force.
 In 1944, Comrade Mao Zedong personally summed up the experience of the politi-
 cal work of the rear corps and wrote the article "On the Political Work of
 the Army" which is regarded as an historical document.  This document was
 formerly a political work report of the political department of the corps
 delivered at a senior cadre meeting of the northwest bureau of the CPC Cen-
 tral Committee.  Actually, it was mostly written by Comrade Mao Zedong
 personally.  This report fully affirmed the achievements in and experiences
 of, the political work of the rear corps and pointed out that following a
 series of ideological and political work and the movement for party consoli-
 dation in specific, the rear corps is full of enthusiasm of militancy, produc-
 tion and study and is full of vitality."  This report also stressed:  "Revo-
 lutionary political work led by the party is the lifeblood of the revolu-
 tionary army" and a mark which differentiated the revolutionary force from
 the reactionary troops.  Political work meant using revolutionary spirit to
 educate the army so that it could fulfill various tasks assigned by the party
 ideologically, politically and organizationally.  Without revolutionary
 political work, it would be impossible to establish an army which completely
 defended the people's interests.   The fundamental reason why the Eighth
 Route Army and the New Fourth Army fought so courageously in the war of
 resistance against Japan and could carry out hard struggle and keep on
 fighting in spite of all setbacks was that they conducted profound careful
 political work.  Over the past several decades, this document has played an
 important guiding role in the political work of our troops.
 While constantly and firmly grasping political and ideological education, we
 consolidated the troops both organizationally and in discipline.  At a meet-
 ing attended by leaders of the rear corps, a decision on unifying the organi-
 zational system of the troops was made according to the instructions issued
 by Comrade Mao Zedong.  The meeting also issued a call on laying a foundation
 for the regularization of the troops and stressed the necessity of establish-
 ing various rules and regulations and set strict demand on the military life

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9
 of the force.  We unified the troop establishment and the names of various
 organizations as well as various rules and regulations on shift duty, briefing,
 meetings, reports, request for leave, inspection, summation of work and so
 forth.  We promulgated various regulations, ordinances and orders concerning
 daily affairs, discipline, staff officers, combat, confidential work, docu-
 ments, archives and so forth.  We provided the troops with more education on
 discipline and placed the enforcement of discipline on the agenda of the work
 of party branches in companies to ensure that the troops absolutely complied
 with and observed various disciplines.  We also strengthened the building of
 party branches in the companies and pay attention to bringing the role of
 fighting bastions of party branches and the vanguard and exemplary role of
 Communist Party members into full play.  Through such consolidation work, we
 enforced strict discipline in military life, established normal order,
 strengthened unity and built closer relations between the army and the govern-
 ment on the one hand and the army and the people on the other.  Hence our
 troops took on a new look.
 In particular, we attached importance to the military training and the study
 of military theories and technology of the troops to constantly enhance their
 combat effectiveness.  The rear corps did not fight so frequently as troops
 at the front and its tactical and technological level was mainly enhanced
 through military training.   Comrade Mao Zedong also showed concern for the
 military training of the rear corps.  He demanded that cadres above regiment
 level study military ideology, strategy and tactics and modestly study the
 combat experiences of troops'fighting at the front.  He also instructed that
 more practice, rather than lectures, was needed in the military training and
 that elicitation method of teaching should be followed.  We guided our cadres
 and fighters to conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War"
 to master objective laws of the war of resistance against Japan.   In military
 training, we conducted strategic training and technical training separately.
 The stress of technical training was laid on the four aspects:  Bayonet fight-
 ing, shooting, throwing hand grenades and the enhancement of combat effective-
 ness in fighting at close range.  The emphasis of tactical training was put on
 close-range combat which included the operation of squads and platoons, fight-
 ing at night, fighting on rivers and mountains and fighting carried out in
 particular terrains such as forests, deserts, land covered with gaoliang and
 so forth.  While giving military training, we.also paid attention to training
 officers and soldiers so that they possessed the combat spirit of valor and
 vigor.  We put forth the slogan "Tasks are more important than lives."  At
 the same time, we also ran training classes, training units and study classes
 for cadres at brigade and regiment levels so that cadres above squad level
 might have an opportunity to focus their attention on military training and
 study.  In such a way, the combat effectiveness of our troops was considerably
 enhanced.  This ensured that we could achieve one victory after another in
 real battles.
 After the start of the war of resistance against Japan, the conditions in the
 Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region were extremely complicated.  Bandits ran
 rampant inside the border region.  To the east of the Huanghe, the Japanese
 troops faced us across the river and the other three sides of the border region

 were encircled ring upon ring by several hundred thousand KMT troops.  However,
 with the support of the main force at the front and the people of the border
 region, the rear corps of the Eighth Route Army repulsed the enemy attacks one
 after another and successfully defended the border region and the party Central
 Committee.
 In the early days of the war of resistance against Japan, because the main
 force,of the Eighth Route Army was sent to the front, the KMT and the Japanese
 invaders made use of bandits to harass the border region.  At that time, apart
 from bandits operating alone, there were 43 gangs of bandits including Xue
 .Zhimao, Li Qinwu, Zhao Laowu and so forth.  They had more than 4,000 men and
 2,000 guns or so.   They made a practice of looting, raping, slaughter and
 arson, assassinated our working personnel, sabotaged our local administrative
 organs and stopped at nothing in doing evil.  Therefore, people at the border
 region could not live a stable life and social order was in chaos.  Expedi-
 tiously eliminating bandits became an urgent task in defending the border
 region.   The rear corps concentrated a superior force and adopted tactics of
 combining the practice of "vigorously pursuing and intercepting and making a
 joint attack" with the act of mobilizing the masses in order to disintegrate
 the bandits politically and suppress them militarily.    Within a period of
 less than a year, we basically wiped out those bandits after a score of big
 and small battles.  When I reported the news to Comrade Mao Zedong, he felt
 pleasantly surprised and immediately drafted a telegram and sent it to various
 anti-Japanese base areas throughout the country to cite the rear corps.
 From March 1938 to 1940, the Japanese aggressor troops attacked our front at
 the flood prevention zone of the border region on scores of occasions.  By
 relying on their superiority in airplanes and artilleries and using gas shells.,
 they tried to fight their way across the Huanghe River to launch a decisive
 war to quickly destroy the border region.  However, the rear corps, and the
 359th brigade which reinforced it, closely united with the people of the
 border region and exerted joint efforts to build strong defense works stretch-
 ing more than 1,000 li along the flood prevention zone.  With the powerful
 support of the main force of our troops stationed at the northwestern part of
 Shanxi Province, we defeated the attack of the Japanese aggressor troops after
 78 big and small battles..  They did not dare to march forward even an inch.
 While fighting those battles, we did not merely adopt defensive tactics.   In-
 stead we vigorously made a flank attack on the enemy.  For instance, when the
 enemy was marching toward the flood prevention zone for the first time, our
 troops launched a night attack on the enemy battalions from the Wanglaopo
 Mountain near the Fenli Highway. After fighting with bayonets, which lasted
 for several hours, we defeated an enemy's unit, wiped out more than 200 sol-
 diers and seized a lot of booty.   In the battle of Songjiachuan, more than
 15,000 enemy troops tried to fight their way across the river behind the
 artillery screens and air raid. Our troops and people at the border region
 held fast to their positions day and night.  After a fierce battle, which
 lasted for 3 days and nights, the enemy's plot of fighting their way across
 the river did not succeed and they were compelled to retreat.  In the battles
 to check the enemy's attack on Jiaxian County, its attempt to seize crossing
 sites and prevent it from crossing the Huanghe River, we met its attack calmly
 and adopted the tactic of "crossing half of the river to strike blows at the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 enemy."  In the meantime, we sent our troops to penetrate into the enemy's
 rear area to carry out a flank attack.  The Japanese troops were crushed and
 defeated and their plot to fight their way across the Huanghe River did not
 succeed.
 To the fighters of the rear corps, their most frequent and complicated task
 was to carry out the struggle to counter the friction created by the KMT.
 After the fall of Wuhan in 1938, the diehards of the KMT were inactive in
 fighting the Japanese aggressors.  However, they actively pursued a domestic
 anti-communist policy and set off an anti-communist upsurge on three occasions.
 They harassed, sabotaged and blockaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region.
 Under the personal direction of Comrade Mao Zedong, our rear corps carried out
 a series of struggles to counter the friction.  When we were launching such
 struggles, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that we should stick to the principles
 of "with good reason, with the advantage and with restraint," "we will not
 attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counter-
 attack," "we will not fight unless we are sure of victory" and "stop when we
 reach the limit."  I still remember that when Yan Xishan was frantically
 carrying out anti-communist activities in 1939 to attack the new army in
 Shanxi led by the party, the party Central Committee sent Comrade Wang Ruofei
 and me to the town of Qiulin to talk with Yan Xishan.  We brought with us
 Comrade Mao Zedong's personal letter to Yan Xishan.  Comrade Mao Zedong wrote
 in the letter the principle of "we will not attack unless we are attack;
 if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack."  Yan Xishan was scared
 after reading it and demanded that the last sentence be changed into "we will
 defend ourselves."  Comrade Mao Zedong insisted that not a single word could
 be changed and that we should firmly stick to the principle "if we are
 attacked, we will certainly counterattack."
 In the struggle to counter the friction created by the KMT, there were several
 things which left a deep impression on me.  They enabled us to realize Comrade
 Mao Zedong's superb skill of struggle.
 The first thing was that from the end of 1939 to the spring of 1940, when the
 Japanese aggressor troops were strengthening their attack against the Shaanxi-
 Gansu-Ningxia border region, the diehards of the KMT began their first anti-
 communist upsurge.  Chiang Kai-shek ordered the KMT reactionary troops, which
 encircled the border region, to attack and occupy 5 counties including Chun-
 hua, Xunyi, Zhengning, Ningxian and Zhenyuan, and 6 districts and 43 villages
 at the border region.   Just at this critical juncture, the party Central Com-
 mittee decided to transfer the 359th brigade to reinforce the border region.
 When Comrade Wang Zhen led the brigade to march toward Suide, the Japanese
 aggressor troops were fighting their way across the river.  He Shaonan, the
 KMT commissioner in Suide, was terror-striken at the news and ran away.  Our
 party Central Committee ordered Comrade Wang Zhen to take the concurrent post
 of the commissioner of Suide to maintain social order there.  However, when
 the Japanese troops were defeated by us, He Shaonan came back again to try to
 seize the domain and create friction.   Of course, he was resolutely counter-
 attacked by us.  The KMT reactionaries seized this opportunity to give enor-
 mous publicity to the incident in order to discredit us.  To tell people of
 the whole country about the truth of this incident and expose the'anti-
 communist plot of the KMT, Comrade Mao Zedong did a very clever thing.   He
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 personally drafted a telegram of commendation on behalf of Comrade Wang Zhen
 and sent it to the KMT authorities in my name.  While citing.the great achieve-
 ments of Comrade Wang Zhen in resisting the Japanese troops, the telegram also
 exposed He Shaonan's crimes of taking bribes and bending the law as well as
 abandoning Suide.  The KMT and Chiang Kai-shek did not know how to reply.
 This was a method of using attack as a means of defense.
 Another thing was that in January 1941 diehards of the KMT created the "South-
 ern Anhui incident" and began the second anti-communist upsurge.  More than
 400,000 troops of the units of Hu Zhongnan, Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui, and 3
 peace preservation brigades and 10 peace preservation corps strictly sealed off_
 the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region.  Again Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the
 article "On the situation of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Nangxia border region."  After
 his personal revision, the article was translated into foreign languages and
 published.  The article told the world about the political, economic and mili-
 tary development of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region and revealed how
 the KMT troops created friction at the border region and enforced a triple-
 depth blockade.   It also made known to the public the designations of the KMT
 troops which sealed off the border.  This laid completely bare Chiang Kai-shek's
 anti-communist plots.
 During the second half of 1942, as required by the development of the situa-
 tion of the war of resistance against Japan and the struggle to repel the
 attack of the troops of the KMT diehards against the border region, the party
 Central Committee decided to establish joint defense forces of the five
 provinces including Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Shanxi and Suiyuan.  The rear
 corps was led by the joint defense forces of the five provinces.  Thus the
 military strength of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region was greatly expanded.
 This created favorable conditions and contributed to shattering the massive
 military attack of Hu Zhongnan.
 The production campaign of the rear corps started as early as in 1938.  At
 that time, fighters of the rear corps led a very hard life.  On an average,
 each fighter had only five fen a day for meals and wore shabby clothes.   Some
 of them wore cotton-padded coats in summer and shorts in winter or even went
 barefoot on ice.  To overcome economic difficulties, improve the livelihood
 of our troops and lighten the burden on the people, Comrade Mao Zedong told
 us that we should learn to carry out production and that we should combine
 production, study and combat.   In accordance with the instruction of
 Comrade Mao Zedong, at the second meeting attended by leaders of the corps
 held in July 1938, we put forward the slogan of "Production and Study."  At
 a party congress held in December of the same year, we put forth the slogan
 "Adopt a posture of fighting to speed up production and turn our military.
 units into a place for collective production."  Thereafter, we regarded pro-
 duction as a constant task of our army units.  At that time, the purpose of
 our production was to improve the livelihood of army troops and our main
 efforts were devoted to planting vegetables, raising pigs, making straw
 sandals, spinning wool, weaving cotton cloth and so forth.  Although the scale
 of our production was not large, we achieved marked results.  Our fighters'
 food, uniforms, daily necessities and so forth were greatly improved.  This
 provided experiences and set a good example for the future mass production
 campaign.

 After 1939, the diehards of the KMT stepped up their attack, enforced a strict
 economic blockade on the border region stopped regular pay for the Eighth
 Route Army and began one anti-communist upsurge after another.  This caused
 extreme difficulties in the financial supplies of the border region.  We had
 enormous difficulties in supplying food and clothing to the army and people
 at the border region.  At that time, people at the border region had to bear
 heavy burdens and the masses complained about this.  Comrade Mao Zedong told
 all comrades everywhere that the people would support us if we attached impor-
 tance to the development of production,and.lightened the burden on the masses.
 Otherwise, they would not support us and the revolution would collapse half-
 way.  One day, Comrade Mao Zedong called Lin Boqu, Gao Gang and me together
 and asked us:  What is our purpose in coming to the northern part of Shaanxi
 Province?  He then said:  We came here to make revolution.  Now the Japanese
 imperialists and the diehards of the KMT are trying to bottle us up and starve
 us to death.   What should we do?  There are three paths we can follow:  first,
 since it is no longer possible to carry out the revolution, we had better
 give it up halfway and go home.   Second, if we are not willing to give up and
 cannot adopt effective methods, we had better wait and starve ourselves to
 death.  Third, we can use our hands to develop production and overcome diffi-
 culties by relying on our own efforts.  After hearding Comrade Mao Zedong's
 humorous remarks, we agreed to his method of developing production by relying
 on our own efforts.  After that, the party Central Committee and Comrade
 Mao Zedong called on the party, government, army, civilians and schools at
 the border region to exert a concerted effort to launch the mighty campaign
 of mass production.
 In the mighty campaign of mass production, the broad masses of the officers
 and men of the rear corps were the most active and scored the most marked
 achievements in production.  In 1943, they opened up 210,000 mu of wasteland
 and reaped 30,000 dan of refined grain.  They operated 11 wool workshops and
 52 other mills which produced clothing, shoes and stockings, leather, wooden
 articles, large handcarts and so forth, in addition to coalpits, charcoal
 kilns, brick and tile kilns and ceramic kilns.  We wove 13,000 bolts of cloth
 and carried out animal husbandry, transportation, business and so forth.  A
 number of advanced and exemplary figures such as Zhao Zhankui, Wu Shenghua,
 Hu Qingshan, Zhang Zhiguo, Feng Guoyu, Zhao Zhankui and so forth, from all
 fronts of industrial and agricultural production and army units, came to the
 fore.  After the mass campaign of production, we gradually solved the problems
 of the supplies for the army units and self-sufficiency.
 Right at the beginning of the mass campaign of production, the 359th brigade
 put forth the slogan "We do not want a single piece of grain, a can of cloth
 and a fen of money from the state."  They marched to Nanniwan and other places
 to reclaim wasteland and begin farming.  Some companies went straight to barren
 hills to open up wasteland.  When they had no place to live, they slept in the
 open on the barren hills.  When they had nothing to eat, they allayed their
 hunger with wild herbs and grass roots.  They worked hard for several months
 at a time.  Cadres and fighters used their own hands to turn the desolate and
 uninhabited Nanniwan into "fertile land of the northern part of Shaanxi."  In
 1944, "half of the grain they produced was surplus grain" and the objective
 of one pig for two persons and two goats for one person on the average was
 attained.

 The enemy enforced its economic blockade with an attempt to bottle us up and
 starve us to death.  However, their goal was not attained.  On the contrary,
 under the wise leadership of the party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong,
 we developed production and brought forth a prosperous economy through the
 campaign of mass production.  We had ample food and clothing and created
 wonders which have rarely occurred in the world.  Our American friend Snow
 and patriotic overseas Chinese Chen Jiageng came to Yanan.  They highly praised
 the scene of hard struggle and prosperity at the border region.  Under such
 arduous circumstances, we never bowed to difficulties.  On the contrary, we
 c      overcame them.  What did we rely upon to conquer those difficulties?  I think
 that we mainly relied on the correct leadership of the party Central Committee
 and Comrade Mao Zedong.  The whole party and army kept in line with the party
 Central Committee and united as one and all of us were inspired by the lofty
 ideals of serving the people and the spirit of working hard for the prosperity
 of the country.   In this way, difficulties gave way.   Comrade Mao Zedong said
 that people needed a bit of spirit.  At that time, we were of one heart and
 one mind to defeat the Japanese imperialists and to build a prosperous and
 strong new China.  We fought for these common objectives.  Therefore,-no dif-
 ficulties could daunt us.  Today, on the new long march of carrying out the
 four modernizations and making China rich and powerful, we particularly need
 the "Spirit of Nanniwan!"
 In 1945 when I was to leave Yanan for the northeast to take up a new post,
 Comrade Mao Zedong talked with me for a long time.  He said that the rear corps
 was a good force which had resolutely implemented the correct line of the, party
 Central Committee and the task entrusted by the party.  He fully affirmed all
 the achievements scored by the rear corps and its contributions to defending
 the party Central Committee and the border region.  Actually, all these achieve-
 ments could not be separated from his personal direction and concern!   On the
 occasion marking the 55th anniversary of the founding of our army, we par-
 ticularly cherish the memory of Comrade Mao Zedong., who made tremendous con-
 tributions to the building of our army.  Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought
 on the people's army and people's war will always be our source of strength
 for winning victory.

 HEIGHTEN PARTY SPIRIT, IMPROVE THE STYLE OF STUDY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 16-18
 [Article by commentator]
 [Text]  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we
 have taken a big stride forward toward heightening party spirit and improv-
 ing the style of study.  In order to victoriously shoulder the ever more
 arduous and strenuous tasks entrusted to us by the party and the state, it
 is still necessary for us to make greater efforts in this respect.  On the
 ideological, theoretical, educational, news, literary, art and publication
 fronts, not only the comrades in leading positions but every cadre and
 every research worker, including the comrades who have moved to the second
 line and who have temporarily left their jobs for recuperation or retired,
 are confronted with the problem of constantly heightening party spirit and
 improving the style of study.
 Heightening party spirit is inseparable from improving the style of study.
 Comrade Mao Zedong linked heightening of party spirit with the Marxist
 style of study.  It is chiefly due to sabotage by the Lin Biao and Jiang
 Qing counterrevolutionary cliques--this historical reason--that until now
 we have not succeeded in fundamentally improving party work style.
 Although party work style in quite a few localities, departments and units
 is much better than it was in the past and is getting better and better,
 there are still considerable gaps compared with the best level ever
 recorded.  In 1943, Comrade Chen Yun, who was head of the organizational
 department at that time, delivered a speech to the literary and art workers
 due to leave for the rural areas.  It is almost 40 years since then and
 yet the truth contained in that speech is still applicable today with
 respect to comrades who engage in literary and art work.  It is likewise
 applicable with respect to comrades who engage in propaganda, cultural and
 other work.  He said, whether you are a specialist in a certain field or a
 person engaged in some sort of work, you should first regard yourself as an
 ordinary CPC member.  Every CPC member should conscientiously think over
 this problem.  As a CPC member, whether you have scored great achievements,
 hold a high position or have been in the party for a long time, do you first
 of all think that you are an ordinary CPC member when you are speaking,
 writing and doing work?  We express our readiness to obey the party
 organizations when we take the oath on being admitted to the party.

 However, when the organization assigns work to us, can we always resolutely
 abide by the assignments and, strive to accomplish the tasks?  Naturally, it
 is permissible, by stating the reasons, to ask the organization to consider
 assigning us another job so that we can work more and better for the party.
 However, from the erroneous words and deeds of some party members we can see
 that they have forgotten even the basic rules a party member should abide by.
 With respect to this matter, we should not be excessively accommodating.
 When a party member exceeds what is proper in both his words and deeds, he
 should make self-criticism and correct his mistakes.  Otherwise, the dis-
 cipline of our party will become lax and corrupted.  At present, there are
 indeed a small number of party members who regard themselves as infallible
 and who, when writing articles or delivering speeches, do not consider
 whether their articles and speeches conform to the party's line, principles
 and policies.  They only remember that they are specialists in certain
 fields or heads of some sort but forget that they are first of all CPC
 members.   This is very bad indeed.
 The leading system of our party must be reformed and the forms of party
 organization may also undergo some changes.  However, there is no change in
 the fact that every party member should abide by the party rules and regu-
 lations.                          So long as you are a CPC member, whether you are a head of a
 certain department or a specialist in a certain field, you must be honest
 and faithful to the CPC branch, the general CPC branch and the CPC com-
 mittee and to the organization.  You should abide by the party rules and
 regulations and should not violate them.  You should obey the leadership,
 supervision and education of the organization in which you are in'and
 should not reject this leadership, supervision and education.
 The CPC Central Committee has on many occasions raised the question of
 consolidating the party.  It is first of all necessary to conduct
 ideological education in order to raise ideological consciousness and, on
 the basis of the ideological education, carry out consolidation of the
 organization step by step.  In the course of the ideological education,
 every party member should conscientiously judge if he conforms to the
 requirements for a party member.  If he does not come up to the require-
 ments, he should strive to achieve them.  If he does not want to exert
 himself and if he is really unqualified, it is. no good letting him stay in
 the party.  It is necessary for every party member to constantly consider
 this question:  Am I a qualified or an unqualified party member?  What
 should I do if I am unqualified?  There are only two ways out:  One is to
 strive to become qualified and the other is to refuse to make any efforts
 and so have to give up party membership.  It will not do for a person who
 is unqualified to stay in the party for this will implicate the party and
 and undermine the party's image.  This is a very serious question with
 respect to comrades who are already party members now and comrades who
 have applied for party membership.   In order to be a qualified party
 member, it is imperative for our words and deeds to conform to the
 requirements of the party constitution.
 In a socialist country like ours, the party is in a leading position.  The
 composition, organization and conditions of the party are extremely

 important not only to the party itself but also to the entire cause of the
 socialist modernization program, the. destiny of the state and the prospects
 of the nation.  Recently a leading comrade of the CPC Central Committee
 said that efforts should be made to enable our party members to become
 qualified party members and our cadres to become qualified cadres so that
 the combat effectiveness of the party not only comes up to but also sur-
 passes the highest level in the party's history.  If the party organiza-
 tions at various levels and all party members come up to the requirements
 of the party, we shall be fully confident of greatly pushing our work for-
 ward and smoothly accomplishing the historic task of the socialist mod-
 ernization program.  No matter how many difficulties and obstacles we may
 meet, we shall have sufficient strength to vanquish them.  Confronted with
 such a serious problem, no party member should. adopt the attitude of
 "letting things drift if they do not affect one personally."  We should not
 only strive to become a qualified party member but also be responsible for
 supervising other party members and find out if they are qualified as party
 members.  With respect to unqualified party members, it is necessary to
 criticize and help them.  If they turn a deaf ear to criticism and refuse
 to accept help, we must be bold to speak out and make suggestions on deal-
 ing with them to the party organization.  This is a manifestation of hold-
 ing ourselves responsible to the party, the people and the cause of
 socialism and communism.
 The question of heightening party spirit is the lifelong duty of every
 party member and its requirements must be increasingly higher.  First of
 all, we should strive to be a qualified party member.  If we fail to become
 qualified, how can we raise the requirements?  Now we do not set demands
 from the highest standards but from the requirements of the party rules and
 regulations.  As far as a CPC member is concerned, these are the minimum
 requirements.  If a party member fails to abide by the party rules and
 regulations, how can he fight for the cause of communism all his life and
 place the party's interests in the first place?
 Every party member must be subject to supervision.  The CPC committee,
 general CPC branch and CPC branch and every party member must first of all
 supervise the leading responsible comrade of their department and see
 whether he carries out or violates the principles and policies of the CPC
 Central Committee.  If violations have been noticed, criticism can be made
 to his face.  If a party member has been, subjected to retaliation on this
 count, he can lodge complaints with the CPC committee at the higher levels
 up to the Central Committee.
 Heightening party spirit intrinsically involves the necessity of improving
 the style of study.
 Propaganda work is a task imbued with strong party spirit and scientific
 nature.  Broadly speaking, it is in the category of social science.  In the
 past few years, tremendous achievements have indeed been scored in the
 research work of social science.  Especially in the economic and political
 aspects, the numerous social science workers have taken an active part in
 the discussions of relevant questions and the many views they have raised

 have played a good role in practical work.  They have also done much better
 than before in conducting investigation and study and in collecting data
 and their consciousness is also higher than before.  This constitutes
 progress.
 However, it is still necessary to greatly improve our style of study.  For
 example, in the past few years, great changes have taken place in the-rural
 areas and the situation is excellent.  The peasants heartily welcome the
 policies of the CPC Central Committee and everyone is jubilant.  However,
 some research workers refuse to go to the rural areas.  They are reluctant
 or unwilling to listen to the voice of millions of people and the views of
 the worker and peasant masses.  This cannot be considered as good style of
 study.  Even if we make cursory observation for a very short time, it will
 greatly help our work and contribute to our understanding.  It is very
 important to ask the departments concerned to supply some material.  How-
 ever, no matter how rich the material may be, it is still material gained
 in the past or secondhand material.  As far as people who engage in research
 work are concerned, it is necessary to gather secondhand material.   However,
 where conditions permit, it is more important to gather firsthand material.
 After all, there are.great disparities between the material gained from
 written documents and actual life.  If we manage to find time to go to
 various provinces, prefectures, counties, communes and production brigades
 and have a look at the peasants' homes, we shall feel that we have gained
 much more substantial and abundant material than we did from written mate-
 rial.   This greatly helps to increase our knowledge and broaden our thinking.
 Ours is a very, big country.  The natural and economic conditions and the
 cultural levels in various localities of the rural areas are different and
 the economic developments are very uneven.  It is therefore necessary to
 have various forms of agricultural production responsibility system.  Even
 the same type of responsibility system, such as the implementation of the
 contract system in an overall way, often varies a great deal in localities
 of different economic development.  In developing agriculture, it is also
 necessary to rely mainly on the planned economy and supplement it with
 regulation by market mechanism; and, with respect to the peasants' freedom,
 if we do not handle it well, it will affect the state plan.  If we go to the
 grassroots to conduct investigation and study, we shall be able to confirm
 that the principles laid down by the CPC Central Committee conform to
 reality and thus deepen our understanding.  There are many branches of
 learning in social science and so the requirements for getting in touch with
 reality cannot follow the same pattern.   A person who engages in the study
 of history comes into contact with material quite different from that
 studied by a person who engages in solving practical problems.  Even if you
 are a person who engages in the study of history, it will also do you a lot
 of good if you go to the grassroots and have a look.  Owing to different
 historical conditions in the past and different economic development in
 various localities, the implementation of public ownership of the means of
 production and the agricultural production responsibility system also
 frequently bear the imprint of history.  This historical imprint cannot
 but exert an influence on current work and practice.

 The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are dealing with practical
 problems every day.  If the comrades who engage in the study of social
 science do not understand new situations and fail to put forward good
 proposals for solving new problems, it is impossible to do our work well.
 Even if we manage to knock together some opinions, they will not be
 accepted.  We have a number of economists, some of whom have played a
 very good role in helping the CPC Central Committee and the State Council
 to determine the principles and policies.  Now the party and state attach
 great importance to social science and place tremendous hopes on it.  So
 long as there are good suggestions, the party and state will give serious
 consideration to them.  This situation has never occurred since liberation.
 However, have we put forward programs, plans and suggestions which have             ?
 original ideas and analysis and which are really capable of solving prob-
 lems?  Yes, but not very many.  Are there people who can put forward such
 proposals?  Yes, but they are not very many either.  How shall we change
 this state of affairs in order to meet the needs of the party and state?
 It is necessary to gradually make efforts, to go deep into the realities of
 life and to get in touch with the masses.  If, by 1985, most of the recipes
 devised by people who engage in the study of economics are suited to the
 case and are capable of curing the sickness and the number of such recipes
 is getting greater and greater, this proves that we have improved our style
 of study and that we have made great progress in our work.
 In order to reform the economic system in an all-round way, it is necessary
 for us to conscientiously understand and give consideration to foreign
 experiences.  However, this can only serve as a reference.  There are
 1 billion people in China, 800 million of whom are peasants.  It just does
 not work to copy indiscriminately the most successful experience from any
 country or locality.  What is most important is that we should constantly
 seek and sum up our experience in our practice.  It is necessary to attach
 sufficient importance to our own experiences, both positive and negative.
 In reforming the economic system, it is necessary to fully study the suc-
 cessful experiences during the 1950's and, in light of the current situa-
 tion, go on advancing and making a breakthrough.  With respect to these
 questions, have our comrades who engage in economic and research work made
 a thorough study of them?  Have they placed them on the agenda?  These
 matters are closely related to the improvement of our style of study.
 Improvement of the style of study has become the key to doing a good job of,
 and improving the level of, the entire propaganda and social science work.
 It has become the key to playing our role in the socialist modernization
 program.  To this end we must make unremitting efforts.

 ON MASS SUPERVISION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 19-24, 30
 [Article by Xiaong Fu [3574 1788]]
 [Text] The principle of mass supervision is a fundamental principle in the
 political affairs of our party and state.  Respecting and safeguarding the
 masses' right of supervision, bringing the role of mass supervision into
 full play and seriously raising the level of mass supervision are a very
 important aspect in improving and. perfecting socialist democracy.  After
 talking about the principle of democracy in the relationship between the
 leaders and the masses (see RED FLAG No 9, 1982), it is still necessary
 to specially discuss this problem.
 Our socialist system is a highly democratic social system.  Under it, the
 people, who are makers of history, have basically changed their status and
 become masters of their country and society as a whole.  People's rights,
 interests and will are supreme.  Any words and deeds harmful to the
 people's rights and interests and violating the people's will are imper-
 missible.  As stipulated in the general principles in the draft of the
 revised constitution:   "The people have the right to administer the affairs
 of the country and its economic, cultural and social affairs, according to
 provisions of the law, through various channels and in various forms."
 Under the socialist system, there are various forms in which the people
 exercise their rights to be master of the house.  The NPC and the local
 people's congresses at various levels which are produced through election,
 the workers' (or commune members') congresses of primary organizations,
 the mass autonomous organizations at the basic level, the organs of self-
 government of national autonomous areas, and the administrative organs at
 various levels ranging from the State Council to the grassroots and
 elected and supervised by these organs of power are the basic forms in
 which the people administer the state affairs.  They are the very basic
 forms reflecting the essential distinction between socialist democracy and
 bourgeois democracy.  The essence of socialist democracy is that the people
 are the masters of their country and the state functionaries are "servants"
 supervised by the people.  The, various aspects of the political, economic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 and social affairs of the state are administered according to the principle
 of democracy, and the relationship between man and man (including that
 between the leadership and the masses) is also established and developed
 according to the principle of democracy.  It must be emphatically pointed
 out that extensive mass supervision of state affairs is an extremely
 important form of socialist democracy.  For example, under the socialist
 system, through their mass organizations and various social bodies, through
 various channels such as meetings, letters, visits, newspapers and other
 publications, and broadcasts, and by such means as discussion, proposal,
 investigation, criticism, reporting an offense.to the authorities, exposing
 an offense, and. making inquiries and complaints, and even by instituting a
 lawsuit, the people may fully express their will, aspirations and demands.
 It should be said that the most extensive mass supervision from below such
 as this is one of the essential characteristics of socialist democracy, is
 the most extensive, most regular and most direct form for exercising the
 people's rights to be masters of the house and plays a very important role
 in guaranteeing that our country will advance along the road to socialism.
 Only by taking this approach to the position and role of mass supervision
 in state affairs can we really and comprehensively understand the content
 and meaning of the people's rights to be masters of the house.
 However, there really are people who not only shut their eyes to the basic
 forms in which the Chinese people exercise their rights to. be masters of
 the house but also neglect mass supervision, which is an important form.
 They hold that since the people are the masters of the house, everyone
 should directly exercise the right to administer state affairs, otherwise
 it is useless to talk about the people's right to be masters of the house.
 Basing themselves on this understanding, they say that democracy guided
 by centralism cannot really embody the will and interests of the people
 and that democracy guided by centralism or exercise of power by entrusting
 it to a few representatives will "inevitably" lead to "alienation" of
 people's power.  For this reason, they demand that the state affairs be
 directly governed by the trade unions.  This view is very wrong and
 harmful.
 Democracy and centralism constitute the unity of opposites.  Under the
 conditions of socialism, administration set up in an organized way, that
 is, the form of exercising the administrative power by the representatives
 elected voluntarily by the people, is a condition for turning society into
 a united, organic whole.  People's rights, will and interests cannot be
 expressed by the form in which everyone directly administers state affairs
 and becomes a direct administrator of state affairs, just as not all on a
 boat can be helmsmen at the same time.  Otherwise, if everyone steers the
 boat as he wishes, this boat cannot advance along a charted course.  There-
 fore, no matter to what extent democracy in our country has been developed
 and no matter to what extent our democratic system has been improved, the
 necessity of assigning a few representatives to exercise the administrative
 power cannot be basically negated.  That is to say, there should always be
 a distinction between the administrators and those governed by them.

 Of course, when we acknowledge the necessity of the division of labor
 between the administrators and those governed by them, we do not mean that
 a few people or a certain group of people may manipulate state affairs
 according to their subjective wish.  Under the conditions of socialism,
 only the people's united will and purpose formed in the principle of demo-
 cratic centralism can manipulate the state affairs.  If and when the
 people's will and purpose have been centralized on the basis of democracy
 and become a firm and correct orientation, they should be carried out in a
 unified and organized way by a few representatives--this is the most
 effective form of administration.  The people will have directly exercised
 their rights to be masters of the house when their united will and purpose
 have not been distorted and can be fully and comprehensively realized under
 the supervision of these representatives.  The essence of being masters of
 the house can only be and must be expressed in the form in which the
 people's will and purpose are centralized on the basis of democracy and
 carried out under centralized guidance, so as to ensure that they are
 realized completely and thoroughly.  It is unrealistic and is even worse
 than a fantasy to argue that the people's right to be masters of the house
 means each individual may directly administer state affairs.  We have
 learned very impressive lessons on this point during the turmoil of the
 "Great Cultural Revolution."
 Some people cherish the idea of letting people directly administer state
 affairs through the trade unions.  This idea is equally unrealistic.   -
 Doubtlessly, as the belt or bridge between the party and the masses, as an
 organization attracting and guiding the masses to participate in adminis-
 tration and as a school where the masses learn to administer affairs, the
 trade unions play a very important role in the whole course of exercising
 the people's rights to be masters of the house.  However, organizing the
 masses through the trade union to participate in administration of state
 affairs is different from letting every member of the trade union directly
 administer state affairs.  The trade union is a mass organization of the
 working class.  It is not an administrative organ.  Even after an enter-prise has established its trade union, all divisions of work and the
 various functions resulting from these divisions of work in the enterprise
 cannot be written off.  A trade union does not have administrative power.
 Led by the party committee, the congress of staff and workers and its
 administrative committee are administrative organs and the factory director
 and his office under their supervision have administrative power.  In an
 enterprise, the trade union can only play its role in attracting and
 guiding the staff and workers to participate in administration and to learn
 to administer affairs.  This is more true in the administration of state
 affairs.  It is the NPC, the local people's congresses at various levels:
 and their administrative offices, and not the trade unions, that have the
 power to administer state affairs.  The trade unions can only play a role
 in attracting and guiding the staff and workers to participate in the
 administration of the affairs of the state and its economic, cultural and
 social affairs.
 In short, the people's democratic dictatorship is our state system.
 Democratic centralism is our government system.  That means the unity of

 democracy and centralism.  Democracy must be guided by centralism and is
 not anarchy divorced from centralism; centralism should be based on
 democracy and is not personal arbitration divorced from democracy.  Only
 by combining democracy with centralism, combining leadership from the top
 with supervision from below, correctly exercising the people's right to be
 masters of the house and correctly handling and solving the dialectical
 relations between democracy and centralism in practice will it be possible
 to guarantee that the people's right to be masters of the house may be
 really exercised.
 An important question is how to guarantee the overall realization of the
 people's will and purpose under the condition where a few representatives
 exercise administrative power.  Apart from the party's leadership, mass
 supervision is an important factor.
 Under the conditions of socialism, a few representatives (including repre-
 sentatives of congresses of grassroots organizations, representatives of
 people's congresses at various levels and the leaders of administrative
 organs at various levels established by these congresses) must have a good
 mass base before they are promoted to the leading positions.  However, in
 no way should a leader regard himself as a natural representative of the
 masses even if he has been elected according to the most rigid democratic
 principles and procedures.  A genuine representative of the people not only
 should "receive order" from the people but also must constantly maintain
 flesh-and-blood ties with the people and consciously and unconditionally
 put himself under mass supervision.  This is the condition for guarantee-
 ing that these representatives have the most important political quality
 of maintaining ties with the masses and being faithful and responsible to
 the people and is also the base for guaranteeing that the people's will
 and purpose can be realized.
 We must realize that ours is a country with feudal autocratic traditions
 of more than 2,000 years.  Therefore, the ideas of the feudal landlord
 class are still pestering the people in varying degrees.  These ideas are
 accompanied by the influence of the small producers' backward ideas and
 bourgeois decadent ideas.  Ideas of this kind often influence some people
 imperceptibly.  Some people holding leading positions also find it difficult
 to completely extricate themselves from these ideas.  Once their positions
 have changed, some comrades seem to have a sudden,rise in social status.
 They get swollen-headed, stand high above the masses and take their place
 as the "patriarch" of a unit or department.  Others are arrogant, have too
 high an opinion of themselves, act arbitrarily, are heedless of the
 people's demands and sufferings and become "overlords" sitting on the backs
 of the people.  What is more, some of them even go to the extent of abusing
 the power given them by the people, using public office for private gain,
 stealing what is entrusted to their care, violating the law, deceiving the
 people and committing crimes.  At present, a great deal of information on
 hitting at economic crimes has shown that some people who could not resist
 the attack by the bourgeois "sugarcoated bullets" have fallen, become

 insects boring into the socialist undertakings and betrayed the interests
 of the people.  There are many reasons why these people have degenerated.
 An important reason is that the role of mass supervision has been weakened.
 Our leading comrades should of course be the first to set high demands on
 themselves, consciously maintain the purity of communism and at the same
 time consciously accept mass supervision.  An important use of mass super-
 vision is to restrict our leaders and prevent them from degeneration.
 Whoever he may be, a leader lives in a particular environment, that is, he
 lives among the masses within a certain scope.  The leaders' undesirable
 tendencies and behaviors, such as seeking privileges and practicing
 bureaucratism, and even their violations of law and discipline cannot
 escape the sharp eyes of the masses.  We do not deny that the binding
 force. of law and discipline and the investigation by the higher authorities
 will effectively prevent the leaders from degeneration.  However, such
 binding force and investigation cannot be divorced from mass supervision.
 Mass supervision is the base on which the binding force and investigation
 play their role.  It is an important condition for preventing the leaders
 from degeneration.
 However, we should in no way interpret the meaning and role of mass super-
 vision in a simple, narrow sense, and create the impression that mass
 supervision aims only at preventing the leaders from degeneration.  If so,
 is it correct to say that mass supervision is no longer needed if the
 leaders do not seek privileges and go in for unhealthy practices?  No, we
 cannot say that!  Leaders of all departments and units must maintain
 flesh-and-blood ties with the masses even if they have a mind to serve the
 people wholeheartedly.  The understanding of anyone is subject to certain
 limitations.  A leader's understanding, intentions and planning have to be
 supplemented and revised by the wisdom and experience of the masses.
 Whether his deeds and measures are correct and effective has to be tested
 by practice among the masses.  To minimize the limitation of his under-
 standing, a leader must strengthen his ties with the masses to the greatest
 possible extent, feel the pulse of the masses, listen to their voice and
 represent the interests and demands of the masses.  In this sense, we
 should not confine the role of mass supervision to the scope of preventing
 some leaders from degeneration, or to the scope of preventing the conse-
 quences caused by the personal character of certain leaders, or the scope
 of passively preventing some leaders from degeneration.  A more important
 aspect of mass supervision is its active role as a.tester and rectifier,
 that is, it will enable the leaders to receive education from the masses
 and also will broaden their scope of vision, enlighten them and tell them
 experiences based on vivid practice, so that they will go deep into the
 realities of life, keep in close contact with the people's struggle and
 subsequently avoid or correct their deviations and mistakes in imple-
 menting the party's line, principles and policies and their shortcomings
 and faults in representing the people's basic interests.  Therefore, the
 leaders on all fronts and of all departments and units are involved in the
 question of receiving mass supervision in all fields of work.
 To the broad masses of people, extensive mass supervision throughout the
 society is a form of education and self-education with tremendous moral

 strength.  The relationship between man and man under the socialist system
 is a comradely relationship of equality, unity, friendship, mutual
 assistance and cooperation.  It.is based on loving the motherland and the
 people, cherishing labor and science, protecting public property, uphold-
 ing socialism and supporting the party's leadership.  In establishing and
 developing this relationship, it is necessary to improve the general mood
 of society, cultivate socialist ethics and create persistent and powerful
 public opinion of justice, that is, it is necessary to create a social-
 environment where good morals prevail over all undesirable practices.
 Extensive mass supervision throughout the society is a moral strength
 which is present everywhere.  It is a prerequisite for the creation of
 such a social environment.  In administering state affairs, while efforts
 are made to bring the role of mass supervision from below into full play,
 attention should also be paid to developing and strengthening mass super-
 vision over the relationship between man and man and bringing its role in
 education and self-education into full play.  This is of great importance
 in improving the general mood of society, protecting social ethics, main-
 taining good order in society and in work and daily life and subsequently
 ensuring the normal development of state affairs and realization of the
 people's basic interests.
 In short, under the socialist system, practicing and persisting in mass
 supervision participated in by the greatest possible number of people is
 an important measure for preventing our leaders from degeneration and
 ensuring that the political hue of our party and state will never change.
 It is also an important link in improving and strengthening the leadership
 work of our party and state in various fields.  At the same time, it is
 an important condition for developing and perfecting the comradely rela-
 tionship between man and man under the socialist system.   Only by proceed-
 ing from these three aspects to understand the meaning and role of mass
 supervision and by practically and not emptily, concretely and not
 abstractly, consciously and not passively establishing and developing a
 powerful mass supervision which-covers the whole society, takes the
 people's basic interests as its core and embraces all spheres and aspects
 of state affairs, can we develop socialist democracy in an all-round
 manner, ensure the prosperity of our cause and forever be in an invincible
 position.
 To ensure exercise of mass supervision, it is imperative to handle
 properly the relationships in the following aspects:
 First, the relationship between full reliance on the leaders' consciousness
 in accepting mass supervision and application of the law and system in
 ensuring mass supervision.
 We must believe that the majority of our cadres and leaders who have been
 educated for many years by our party understand deeply our party's nature
 and tasks and their duties and obligations.  Most of them are highly
 conscious in accepting mass supervision.  This is the mainstream among our
 leaders and cadres.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9
 However, there are actually some people who lack consciousness in this
 aspect.  They regard the solemn duties assigned them by the party and
 people as the power which enables them to do whatever they like.  They
 also regard the masses as "subjects" governed by them.  They pose as
 "special citizens" and "special party members" and simply ignore mass
 supervision, and no one dare to criticize them, educate them and take
 disciplinary action against them.  Some of them even suppress mass super-
 vision, make things hard for those who make criticisms or proposals, and
 go to the extent of publicly retaliating against them.
 Under these circumstances, while arousing, relying on and developing the
 consciousness of the leaders in accepting mass supervision, we must use
 the law and system to ensure mass supervision, so that those who ignore
 and trample on the people's democratic rights will be kept within bounds
 and even be punished.  Under the socialist system, this is a question of
 fundamental importance and a question of principle.   For this reason, the
 new constitution (draft revision), the new party constitution (draft
 revision) and "Guiding Principles for Inner-Party Political Life" specified
 the people's rights to exercise mass supervision and stipulated that the
 leaders must accept mass supervision.  At present, we are taking further
 steps to improve the socialist economic and political systems and various
 administrative systems.  The question of safeguarding the people's rights
 to supervise state affairs in various fields has attracted general atten-
 tion.  The point now is to institutionalize the ways, methods, forms and
 means of exercising mass supervision.  For example, the departments and
 leaders concerned must give replies within a specified period of time to
 proposals, criticisms and opinions put forth by the masses except the
 troublemakers; concrete rules should be laid down governing the forms and
 methods whereby the leading cadres at various levels periodically and
 directly hear the criticism and opinions of the masses; the system govern-
 ing handling of letters and reception of visitors by the leading organs at
 various levels should be improved; newspapers should go further to conduct
 mass criticism from below, and so forth.  At the same time, it should be
 specially emphasized that the laws and systems regarding the exercise of
 mass supervision must be strictly implemented.  Only in this way will it
 be possible to carry out mass supervision on a solid basis and to prevent
 the people's right to exercise mass supervision from becoming an empty
 promise or an abstract principle.
 Second, the relationship between the leaders' acceptance of mass super-
 vision and their correct attitude toward the opinions of the masses.
 Every leader must accept mass supervision.  However, accepting mass super-
 vision does not mean blindly accepting the opinions of the masses.  As far
 as this question is concerned, it is necessary to further wipe out the
 pernicious influence of the so-called theory that mass movement is "natural
 and reasonable" advocated by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolu-
 tionary cliques.  As we all know, not all opinions, appeals and demands
 from the masses are correct.  Some of the masses may be advanced and others
 backward.  As members of the masses, they are subject to limitations in
 acquiring understanding.  Under different conditions, they may be subject
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 to influence from various quarters so that they may be inclined in different
 directions.  For this reason, a leader must make overall, concrete analysis
 of the sentiments, opinions and demands of the masses, not only humbly,
 extensively and comprehensively listening to the opinions of the masses,
 especially those working on the forefront of production, scientific
 research and social services, but also aptly grasping the reasonable factors
 and components of these opinions and daring to discard the unreasonable
 factors and components.  That is to say, he must not only "incorporate
 things of diverse nature" but also go through a course of considering the
 opinions by "discarding the dross and selecting the essential, eliminating
 the false and retaining the true, proceeding from the one to the other and
 from the outside to the inside."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 1,
 p 268)  If he does not make efforts to seriously think about the essence
 and contents of the opinions in an overall manner, he will invariably be at
 a loss as to what to do, be influenced by various kinds of opinions and
 tendencies and be bogged down in a contradiction.  This is true with some
 leaders.  In the face of complicated conditions, they often dare not come
 into contact with the masses and contradictions, not knowing what course
 to take but always trying to take the course of least resistance.  Or, they
 passively accede to some unreasonable demands of the masses-and blindly
 accept the opinions of the masses.  This is not a correct attitude toward
 mass supervision.  The essential demand, the premise and the principle of
 mass supervision are to express the basic interests of the masses.  The duty
 of a leader is to adopt the reasonable factors of the different opinions of
 the masses, including opinions contradictory to each other and biased and
 extreme views, and at the same time to guide the masses through persuasion
 and education and apply higher principles and higher demands in uniting the
 masses on a still higher plane.  This conforms to what Comrade Mao Zedong
 said:  "With respect to the question of the party's relationship with the
 masses, the party must lead the masses to carry out all their correct ideas
 in the light of the circumstance and educate them to correct any wrong ideas
 they may entertain."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 4, p 1253)
 Third, the relationship between the masses' spontaneous exercise of rights
 of supervision and their conscious exercise of rights of supervision.
 The masses' spontaneous exercise of rights of supervision means the masses'
 direct reaction to a problem or matter according to their personal intui-
 tion, feelings and gains.  This kind of reaction often cannot comprehen-
 sively and accurately embody and reflect the general, long-term and basic
 interests of the masses, so that in most cases, it is narrow in scope, one-
 sided and partial.  For example, we may often hear grievances, complaints,
 criticisms and reproaches.  This is sometimes because our leaders have not
 considered their work in an overall manner and have not handled it
 properly.  However, in most cases, this is because the masses do not have
 an overall understanding of the situation?or because their personal wishes
 and demands have not been satisfied.  A leader should patiently listen to
 their voices.  He should solve the personal problems of some individuals if
 these problems arise because he has not considered his work in an overall
 manner and has not handled it properly.  However, as far as the masses are
 concerned, mass supervision has not been exercised sufficiently if it
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9
 remains at this level.  If the masses proceed only from personal feelings,
 they cannot correctly exercise their rights of supervision and, on the
 contrary, they will easily be swayed by personal feelings and fail to play
 their role in exercising supervision.
 The masses' conscious exercise of rights of supervision means the masses'
 making of criticisms, proposals and plans, their efforts to expose the
 passive, backward and gloomy phenomena in everyday life and their adoption
 of legal measures to carry out active intervention by proceeding from
 their sense of responsibility as masters of the whole country and society,
 from their concern for the future and destiny of the party and state and
 from their consciousness in the general, long-term and basic interests of
 the masses.  The "law of civil procedure" stipulates that one has the right,
 through lawsuits, to actively interfere with any action which does not con-
 cern oneself and one's unit but happens to other people or other units and
 harms the interests of the state, the collective and the society.   This
 means the right of social supervision.  Strictly speaking, only by standing
 on such a high plane can we genuinely reflect the original meaning of mass
 supervision, really display the power of mass supervision and truly express
 the rights of the people to be masters of the house.  We should not reject
 or negate the former kind of supervision, that is, spontaneous supervision,
 and its meaning and role because, after all, it is a direct reflection of
 the masses' feelings and thinking.  However, we should encourage the latter
 kind of supervision, that is, conscious supervision.  Only this kind of
 supervision can play an enormous educational role and have tremendous moral
 strength.  We should continuously and vigorously carry out propaganda  and
 education and organize and lead the masses to continuously arouse their
 consciousness and understanding so that mass supervision may gradually rise
 from the level of spontaneous supervision to the level of conscious super-
 vision.  For this reason, when we talk about mass supervision, we should
 set demands not only on the leaders but also on the masses.
 In order to raise mass supervision to the level of conscious supervision,
 the masses should be enabled to attain a very high conscious and moral
 level, to break away from their personal, partial interests and to refrain
 from taking their personal feelings, gains and likes as the criteria for
 deciding what is right and what is wrong and what attitude they will adopt.
 toward various problems.  In short, the masses must attain a lofty realm
 of thought and become mature citizens, that is, citizens cherishing a lofty
 ideal, attaining a high moral and cultural level and observing discipline.
 If the masses can reach this stage of maturity, the quality of mass super-
 vision will be greatly improved, the leaders' subjectivism, bureaucratism
 and undesirable personal character will be strictly supervised and curbed
 and the masses will also receive education and training.  Undoubtedly,
 hardships will be involved in attaining this goal.  To attain this goal,
 the masses must take hold of the most powerful ideological weapon,
 Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought; they must continuously increase their
 scientific and cultural knowledge; and they must adopt a strict scientific
 attitude of seeking truth from facts.  The masses must treasure their
 rights to supervise the administration of state affairs and take a serious
 attitude toward these rights.  While exercising these rights, they should

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 make investigations, acquire detailed information and obtain all-round
 understanding of the situation.  In no way should they talk irresponsibly,
 do as they please, act on hearsay evidence and believe in rumor, lest they
 abuse their rights of supervision.  Only in this way will it be really
 possible to bring the role of mass supervision into play as a restriction
 and precaution, as a tester and rectifier and in education and self-
 education.
 More than half a century ago, Lenin made a well-known remark:  "A state is
 strong when the people are politically conscious.  It is strong when the
 people know everything, can form an opinion of everything and do everything
 consciously."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 26, p 234)  Let our leaders
 take deep root in the fertile soil of the masses!  Let all the people
 quickly become politically conscious and mature and earnestly shoulder
 their tasks as masters in administering state affairs!

 A CRACKDOWN ON ECONOMIC CRIMES AND CLASS STRUGGLE
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 25-30
 [Article by commentator]
 [Text] At present, the struggle to crack down on serious criminal activities
 in the economic field is proceeding smoothly.  This is an important guarantee
 for upholding the socialist road and realizing the great goal of socialist
 modernization.  Concerning the situation, nature and importance of this strug-
 gle and the steps and general and specific policies to be followed in connec-
 tion with this struggle, the party Central Committee and the State Council
 have made scientific analyses and provided clearcut stipulations in the
 "decision on cracking down on serious criminal activities in the economic
 field" and other documents.  These analyses and stipulations are playing
 important roles in unifying everyone's ideological awareness and guiding the
 deepening of the struggle.  But it should also be noted that some comrades
 have certain vague and incorrect ideas about this struggle and the current
 class struggle.  Continuously making things clear and rectifying these ideas
 are still tasks that cannot be neglected in our' ideological and theoretical
 work and in our actual work.
 Some comrades have noted serious criminal activities in the economic field in
 the past few years, such as smuggling, illegal trading, corruption, bribery,
 profiteering, deception, the theft of state and collective property, and so
 forth, and have thus doubted the correctness of our party's policy on opening
 the door to foreign countries and enlivening domestic economic activities.
 They have even regarded these phenomena as a product of the realization of
 this policy itself.  This doubtful attitude or view just does not hold water.
 Opening the door to foreign countries and enlivening the domestic economy is
 a major policy adopted by our party on the basis of the objective laws govern-
 ing socialist construction, on the basis of painful lessons learned from
 serious setbacks suffered as a result of a long period of carrying out "left-
 ist" guiding ideas, and on the basis of the actual needs of modernization.
 Experience in the past few years has provided eloquent proof that the imple-
 mentation of this policy is conducive to the readjustment, reform, reorganiza-
 tion and improvement of the national economy and is also conducive to the
 development of various economic undertakings, and agriculture and light industry

 in particular.  In the past few years, there has been a great increase in our
 foreign trade. What the state spent on improving the people's stan2arddro28
 living from 1979 to 1981 reached 140 billion yuan.  These 3 years,
 million people in towns and cities arranged employment.  We made these
 achievements because, first of all, we have upheld the consistent guideline
 calling for independence, self-reliance and planned economy and developed the
 fine tradition of fighting amidst hardships.  But it should also be noted
 that if we had continued to follow the policy of isolating the country from
 the world and imposing too-rigid controls on economic activities, and had
 refrained from carrying out and upholding
 domestic            opening
 foreign countries and enlivening
 been imposssible to score these achievements.
 True, serious criminal activities in the economic field have taken place under
 new historical conditions following our implementation of the policy of open-
 ing the door to foreign countries and enlivening the domestic economy.  But in
 no way can we interpret these activities as the product of the implementation
 of this policy itself.  Similarly, we cannot put the blame on socialist com-
 modity production and commodity exchange just because some speculation and
 profiteering cases exist in our country's process of commodity circulation at
 its current stage.  There is no doubt that only where there is a commodities
 and currency relationship can there be speculation and profiteering.  But
 speculation and profiteering is not a product of socialist commodity produc-
 tion or commodity exchange itself.  Instead, it is attributable to the poor
 development of commodity production, to an inadequacy of commodities, and to
 drawbacks and weak links existing in regard to commercial management systems
 and management measures.  Only under these conditions can phenomena like
 speculation and profiteering turn from possibilities into realities.  To
 energetically develop socialist commodity production., increase the total vol-
 ume of social commodities and improve the circulation of commodities--this is
 an effort to create adequate conditions for digging out the economic soil
 that gives rise to crimes like profiteering and speculation.  Under the new
 historical conditions, where we open the door to foreign countries and seek
 to enliven domestic economic activities, the appearance of serious criminal
 activities in the economic field is attributable to social historical factors
 in many fields.  Our implementation of the policy of opening the door to
 foreign countries and enlivening economic activities has taken place against
 a general historical background resulting, from 10 years of destruction against
 our party, state and society by Lin Biao and the "gang of four."  Various eco-
 nomic sectors have been out of balance.  Serious difficulties have been experi-
 enced in economic life.  The pernicious influence of the ideas of extreme
 individualism and anarchism spread by Lin Biao and the "gang of four" is deep-
 seated.  Great damage has been done to the party.'s work and its prestige,
 social moral practices and people's sense of discipline.   In addition, cer-
 tain kinds of ideological and political work and management measures in the
 process of implementing the policy of.opening the door to foreign countries
 and enlivening domestic economic activities have failed to catch up in time.
 Given the combined effects of these social historical factors, certain nega-
 tive and disruptive social phenomena are very likely to be revived and grow
 in the economic and other areas.

 The objective fact that serious criminal activities appear in the economic
 field tells us that in the new historical period of promoting modernization,
 we must take two measures.  The first is to uphold the policy of opening the
 door to foreign countries and enlivening domestic economic activities.  The
 other is to resolutely crack down on serious criminal activities in the eco-
 nomic and other fields.  These two measures complement each other, and neither
 is dispensable.  Only by resolutely waging the solemn struggle to crack down
 on serious criminal activities in the economic and other fields can we remove
 obstacles and interference and ensure the correct implementation of the policy
 of opening the door to foreign countries and enlivening domestic economic
 activities.  And only by firmly and unswervingly carrying out the policy of
 opening the door to foreign countries and enlivening domestic economic
 activities can we speed up the building of socialist material civilization
 and spiritual civilization and create conditions for continuously getting rid
 of all kinds of criminal activities.
 Some comrades believe that such activities as corruption, bribery, speculation,
 deception, smuggling and illegal peddling are in the category of general
 illegal and criminal activities and are general anti-social acts.  The rulers
 of feudal and capitalist societies in history ably waged struggles against.
 these activities.  Therefore, a crackdown on these criminal activities cannot
 be interpreted as class struggle.  Is this a view correct or not?  We feel
 that it is not right to hold this view.
 True, such social phenomena as corruption, bribery, speculation, deception,
 smuggling and illegal trading have not existed only today.  They were evident
 long ago.  They were the products of private ownership and the system of
 exploitation.  These phenomena that now still exist in our economic life are,
 in the final analysis, historical legacies from the old society.  In the
 class society in the past, feudal,and bourgeois rulers did wage a struggle
 against corrupt officials and corrupt practices within a given scope and to
 a certain extent.  The aim was to regulate relations within the ruling class
 and maintain the interests of the rule of the whole exploiting class and the
 order of rule.  Never would this strike at the foundation of the exploiting
 system and the exploiting class.  Nor was it possible to do so.  For example,
 in the feudal society, there were indeed differences between honest and cor-
 rupt officials and contradictions and struggles between them.  Marxism has
 never negated the differences existing between honest and dishonest officials
 in history and has never negated the positive social significance of the
 struggle of honest officials against corrupt officials and corrupt practices,
 or the role that such struggle objectively plays to a certain extent in help-
 ing the development of productive forces and social progress. But at the same
 time Marxism holds that no matter how honest they may appear, so-called honest
 officials were still political representatives of the exploiting class and
 still supporters of the exploitation system.  Their struggle against corrupt
 officials is of course not the struggle between classes and is instead in the
 category of a contradiction or a struggle within the exploiting class.   There-
 fore, this struggle is basically different from the struggle that we wage
 today to crack down upon serious criminal activities in the economic field
 or the remnants of this old exploitation system--a struggle to maintain the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 socialist system that allows the people to be the masters.  The two struggles
 just cannot be lumped together.
 Our socialist society is still in an initial stage of development.   In social
 life and among social members, there inevitably exist various negative and
 disruptive factors.  There exist wrong ideas that run counter to Marxist and
 socialist principles, and anti-social acts detrimental to social order, social
 discipline and social interests.  There also exist activities of hostile ele-
 ments designed to disrupt the socialist system.  These ngative and disruptive
 factors are all obstacles standing in the way of the progress of our society
 and the development of social civilization.  But they are a different kind,
 of factor, as far as circumstances and nature are concerned.  They should
 be distinguished in a strict and scientific manner.  We can never unanalyti-
 cally equate all these ngative and disruptive factors with class struggle.
 But we also can never treat the disruptive activities of various hostile
 elements that really fall into the category of class struggle as general
 negative phenomena and general anti-social acts.
 Since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the party
 Central Committee has on many occasions clearly pointed out that in the areas
 of our country where socialist transformation has been completed, after the
 elimination of the exploiting class as a class, class struggle will still
 exist for a long time within a given scope.  What does this class struggle
 within a given scope chiefly mean?  Or what is its main content?  We believe
 that its main content is the struggle between the people and various hostile
 elements.   (Needless to say, the so-called main content of course does not
 mean all its contents; it has other contents.  For example, the struggle
 against the remnants of feudalist thinking left over from the old society,`
 decadent capitalist thinking, and so forth, that continue to have an effect
 or influence on people of this kind or that, has partaken of the nature of
 class struggle in some cases to different degrees.  But generally speaking,
 such struggle still falls into the category of contradictions among the
 people).  These hostile elements include counterrevolutionaries, enemy agents,
 criminals that seriously disrupt socialist order, an extremely small number of
 exploiters of the past that continue to adhere to a reactionary stand and
 also new exploiters involved in corruption, theft, speculation and profiteer-
 ing.  They carry out various disruptive activities in political, economic,
 and cultural fields and in social life.  The purposes of their activities
 and their results are detrimental to our socialist system and socialist cause.
 Their interests are diametrically opposed to the interests of the masses of
 people and socialist interests.  Therefore, the struggle of workers, peasants
 and intellectuals against them is still a kind of class struggle.
 Our crackdown on serious criminal activities in the economic field means wag-
 ing a solemn struggle against new exploiters involved in corruption, theft,
 speculation, profiteering, smuggling and illegal trading.  These criminal
 elements have resorted to various means to expropriate the results of social
 labor without compensation.  There criminal activities not only seriously
 disrupt our socialist economy and impair the socialist relations of produc-
 tion but also seriously upset social order, corrupt social practices, deprave
 our party, state and society, and poison the people's spiritual world.

 Moreover, their activities are often related to exploiting classes. in foreign
 countries.  Therefore, these are by no means general criminal activities and
 general anti-social acts, but are instead an important manifestation of class
 struggle in the economic field under the new historical conditions where we
 open the door to foreign countries and seek to enliven the domestic economy.
 Such class struggle is not just class struggle left over from the history of
 our country.  It is also, at the same time, a reflection of international
 class struggle.  We must thus soberly realize the nature of the struggle to
 crack down on serious criminal activities in the economic field.  We must
 resolutely wage such a struggle and win victory.  Only in this way can we. in
 the new historical period, uphold the socialist road and ensure the develop-
 ment of our modernization effort in the correct direction.
 Some comrades say that since the'crackdown on serious criminal activities in
 the economic field is an important manifestation of class struggle in our
 socialist society in the economic field under new historical conditions, and
 since such struggle will also continue for a long period, does this not prove
 that it is still correct to "take class struggle as the key link"?  Of course
 not.  There is no objective basis for such worries, or this way of thinking.
 Everyone knows that the fundamental meaning of "taking class struggle as the
 key link" is not to recognize that after the fundamental completion of the
 socialist transformation of the private ownership system of the means of
 production and the fundamental elimination of the exploiting class as a class
 in our country, the main contradictions to be solved in social life have
 undergone fundamental changes, and not to recognize that the contradiction
 between the ever-growing needs of the people in their material and cultural
 life and backward social production has become the main contradiction, and
 the focus of party and state work must be shifted to socialist economic
 construction.   Instead, it is still held that the contradictiorr between the
 proletariat and the bourgeoisie is the so-called main social contradiction
 and that class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will al-
 ways exist in the entire history of socialism.  Therefore, all economic and
 social work must revolve around class struggle as a key link or a center and
 be made to serve it.   Under the guidance of this theory, political movements
 were continuously launched within the party and in society.  As a result, a
 large host of social contradictions not partaking of the nature of class
 struggle were handled as the contradictions of class struggle.  Many contra-
 dictions among the people were treated as contradictions between the enemy
 and ourselves, causing the serious enlargement of class struggle.  Things were
 carried so far that there was a search for the so-called bourgeoisie within
 the party.   The "great cultural revolution" broke out, a so-called "great
 revolution" of one class overthrowing another, which lasted for as long as 10
 years, causing great damage and disaster to the political life of the party
 and the state, to the interests of the people, and to economic construction
 and the whole socialist cause.  Hard historical facts have amply proved that
 the theory and act of "taking class struggle as the key link" under socialist
 conditions run entirely counter to the reality of class struggle in our.
 society, to the objective laws governing the development of socialist society

 and to the strong desire of hundreds of millions of people for the building
 of a modern socialist country.
 The 3rd plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee resolutely stopped
 the implementation of the slogan of "taking class struggle as the key link"
 and resolutely shifted the focus of party and state work to socialist
 modernization centering on economic construction.   Since the 3rd plenary
 session, to eliminate the influence of "taking class struggle as the key link"
 in various fields, the party Central Committee has unified awareness of the
 reality of class struggle in our society on a scientific and correct basis--
 awareness on the part of the comrades of the whole party and the people of
 the entire country.   It has done a great deal of effective work regarding both
 theory and practice.  The "decision on certain questions in the history of the
 party since the founding of the -PRC" adopted at the 6th plenary session of the
 11th CPC Central Committee pointed out:  "After the elimination of the exploi-
 ting class as a class, class struggle is no longer a main contradiction.  Due
 to domestic factors and international influence class struggle will exist for
 a long period of time within a given scope and may intensify under certain
 conditions.  We must oppose not only the viewpoint of enlarging class struggle
 but also the viewpoint that class struggle has died out."  This is a funda-
 mental conclusion about class struggle in socialist society reached scien-
 tifically by our party on the basis of a profound summing-up of historical
 experiences and lessons.  It is also a fundamental guideline that in the future
 we must follow in observing and handling problems concerning class struggle.
 What we mean by class struggle existing within a given scope is that after
 the elimination of the exploiting class as a class, the kind of class antagon-
 ism previously existing between hostile classes within the whole society will
 disappear.   Class struggle that continues to exist in the whole social life
 is no longer in a dominant position, or is no longer the main contradiction.
 As mentioned above, such class struggle within a given scope finds expression
 chiefly as the struggle of the people against hostile elements bent on dis-
 rupting the socialist system.  It is a far cry from a historical class strug-
 gle in a class society.  With the system of exploitation eliminated and the
 socialist system established, these hostile elements have forfeited the kind
 of economy (reactionary relations of production), politics (a reactionary
 state regime) and ideology (the reactionary ideology occupying a dominant
 position in society) and other conditions that the exploiting class as a class
 in the past relied upon for survival.  They could not possibly form into a
 perfect class.  As far as general trends are concerned, with the development
 of our socialist cause, the scope of their activities will naturally and
 gradually narrow.  Their numbers and their strength will of course be gradu-
 ally weakened.                  Therefore, we cannot make light of the objective fact of the
 existence of such class struggle, let down our guard and give up the necessary
 struggle.  Nor can we freely magnify it and repeat the previous mistake of
 enlarging class struggle.
 The slogan of "taking class struggle as the key link" applies only to a class
 society and the historical period of transition from capitalism or new demo-
 cracy to socialism.   It does not apply to a socialist society where the system
 of exploitation and the exploiting class have been eliminated.  In the future,
 we must at all times ahdere to this fundamental Marxist principle that has
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 been proved entirely correct in practice.  In observing and analyzing criminal
 activities in the economic field and the disruptive activities of hostile ele-
 ments in other fields, our party has never deviated from this fundamental
 principle.  Though the criminal activities of these hostile elements have
 assumed very serious proportions in some areas, they still fall into the
 category of class struggle within a given scope.  Our party and government
 have taken this very principle as a starting point in putting forth tasks of
 struggle and in defining steps, methods and policies in struggle.  We have also
 repeatedly stressed the necessity of learning from previous experiences and
 lessons and have strictly defined the line of distinction between class strug-
 gle and large hosts of social contradictions that do not fall into the category
 of class struggle and the line of distinction between the contradictions be-
 tween the enemies and ourselves on the one hand and contradictions among the
 people on the other.  We have stressed the need not to launch a mass movement
 in the course of struggle and have also stressed the need to act strictly
 according to legal and judicial procedures in cracking down on and handling
 criminal elements who have seriously disrupted the economy.  Meanwhile, we have
 conducted this class struggle in a correct and effective manner.   The aim is to
 eliminate interference and obstacles in a timely manner and ensure the smooth
 progress of socialist modernization as the central task of the party and the
 country.  Therefore, this is fundamentally different from the theory and prac-
 tice of "taking class struggle as the key link."
 Some comrades also say that since, in our country, the exploiting class. has
 been eliminated as a class, why is it that class struggle will still exist in
 the economic and other fields within a given scope for a long time to come
 and will likely intensify under certain conditions?
 Let us discuss and analyze this problem as follows:
 Marxism holds that socialism calls for eliminating classes and paving the way
 for the ultimate transition to a proletarian communist society.  The elimina-
 tion of classes means not only eliminating the exploitation system and the
 exploiting class but also eliminating all class differences, or any phenome-
 non of society being divided into classes and social strata.  In our country,
 the elimination of the exploitation system and the exploiting classes and
 thus the elimination of class struggle between the exploiters and those sub-
 jected to exploitation as members of hostile classes undoubtedly represents a
 major step forward of decisive significance, as far as the historical task of
 realizing the elimination of such social phenomenon as class struggle in our
 social life is concerned.  But this in no way means that the historical task
 has been completed.  Though the exploitation system and the exploiting class
 have been eliminated, various hostile elements related to them, who seek to
 disrupt the economic, political and cultural activities of the socialist
 system, have yet to be wiped out.  Therefore, the peculiar kind of class
 struggle centering on the people's struggle against these hostile elements
 under socialist conditions will continue to exist in our social life.  This
 point has been stressed by us above.   In our country, from the elimination
 of the exploiting class to the elimination of all, class differences, it is a
 fairly long historical process.  From the elimination of the exploiting class
 to the elimination of all hostile elements who discriminate against and dis-
 rupt socialism, it is also quite a fairly long historical process.  This is

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 to say that from the elimination of class struggle between hostile classes to
 the complete elimination of all phenomena of class struggle under socialist
 conditions (including such phenomena as struggle between the people and hos-
 tile elements and other struggles of a class nature), it is by no means an
 achievement that can be realized in a short period of time.  Why?  In sum,
 this because, as the most advanced social form in history--the first stage
 of the communist form of society--our socialism has only just broken away
 from the old society and is not based on an adequately developed and mature
 society.  Concretely speaking, this is determined by the following domestic
 and international social historical factors.
 First, the poison of the exploitation system and the exploiting classes in
 history that has remained in socioeconomic, political and cultural fields and
 especially in the field of ideological awareness cannot be eliminated in one
 stroke.   In our society, Marxist and socialist awareness has occupied a
 dominant position and is becoming the guiding ideology for more and more
 commune members.  Decadent feudalist and capitalist ideas have been stripped
 of the class that serves to consolidate and support them and have become
 remnants of ideology, which are being continuously criticized and attacked
 by socialist ideology.  But the substance on which their existence is based
 and their social foundation have still not been completely removed.  Combined
 with the remnant poison of the exploitation system and the exploiting class in
 other fields, they will continue to have an effect or influence on various
 aspects of our social life for a long time to come.  Influenced by such
 remnant poison, some commune members may degenerate and lapse into anti-
 socialist acts.  Moreover, our motherland has still not accomplished the great
 cause of.finally unifying the country.  In a part of the territory, the
 exploitation system has still not been eliminated.  The groups hostile to
 socialism there have stopped at nothing to corrupt the thinking of the people
 on our mainland.  They have at the same time resorted to various means,
 cluding the establishment of espionage agencies and the cultivation and woo-
 ing of hostile elements, to carry out disruptive activities of all kinds
 against our socialist enterprise.
 Second, on the international scene, imperialism and hegemonism still exist.
 So do the exploitation system and the exploiting class.  For a long time to
 come we will carry out socialist modernization under such international con-
 ditions.  In developing the socialist cause, we cannot keep to ourselves and
 must be oriented to the world, upholding the open-door policy and promoting
 extensive economic, cultural, scientific and technical exchanges and coopera-
 tion with all countries, including many capitalist ones.   In. the process of
 these proper exchanges, some people will inevitably act in collusion with
 certain illegal elements in our society and seize the opportunity to carry
 out smuggling activities against us in the economic and cultural fields.  They
 will subject our social life and social members to infiltration and corruption
 in the political and ideological fields and in our way of life.   Some hostile
 foreign forces will also inevitably avail themselves of the opportunity to
 carry out disruptive activities against our socialist system.   In sum, the
 influence of the capitalist world and the hostile foreign forces' sabotage
 against our country represent important objective conditions that make it
 difficult to eliminate in a short period of time the vestiges of the exploi-
 tation system and the activities of hostile elements inherent in our society.

 Third, our socialist system is still very young. Though it has initially and
 effectively demonstrated its great superiority and vitality and has chalked
 up many great achievements impossible of being attained in old China, the
 level of development of social productive forces is after all relatively low.
 Social economy and culture are after all relatively backward.  Socialist means
 of production and the superstructure are still unsound and imperfect in many
 respects.  Therefore, it is inconceivable that in a short period of time, we
 could create labor productivity and social material wealth at levels com-
 parable to those of developed capitalist countries and fully satisfy the
 o      material and cultural needs of all social members.   In these circumstances,
 it is very difficult to prevent certain irresolute elements in society and
 within the party from developing negative feelings and from being so affected
 by the propaganda and influence of the capitalist world that they become cap-
 tives of capitalism and even embark on the road of serving their own ends at
 the expense of the public and opposing socialism.  There are still many draw-
 backs and weak links in our management system in the economic, political and
 cultural fields.  These drawbacks and weak links can, under given conditions,
 become loopholes that various hostile elements count upon for their growth
 and their activity.  This is to say that our socialist system is far from
 being so mature and perfect that some social members can be completely pre-
 vented from degeneration and various hostile elements can be completely pre-
 vented from emerging.  Our system still lacks economic, political and social
 conditions.   To make our system fully mature and perfect and make it reach
 such a stage and live up to the necessary conditions still involves a fairly
 long period of struggle.
 On the very basis of a scientific analysis of the above national and interna-
 tional factors, the party Central Committee has reached a correct conclusion
 that class struggle will continue to exist in our society for a long time to
 come.  So long as class struggle in social life still has not finally dis-
 appeared, we cannot relax our vigilance, weaken the dictatorial functions of
 the country of the people's democratic dictatorship, or give up the Marxist
 class viewpoint and methods of analysis.  If under conditions where class
 struggles still exist, we should use the viewpoint of so-called abstract
 "people" to observe and handle social phenomena in a departure from the social
 and class nature of people, this would be very dangerous, and we would inevi-
 tably make historical mistakes.

 NEW QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE CROPPED UP IN GRAIN PRODUCTION IN SUZHOU PREFECTURE

 [Text]  Editor's Note:  This investigation report was
 written by several students of the seventh and eighth
 grades of the agricultural economics department,
 People's University of China, on a field survey they
 made in Suzhou Prefecture.  The report highlighted
 several viewpoints on questions of grain production
 and diversified operations in Suzhou Prefecture.  The'
 viewpoints are worth studying by the relevant depart-
 ments.
 Suzhou Prefecture comprises 8 counties and 222 people's communes.  It has a
 total population of 6.55 million people, of which 3.38 million are peasants,
 and 6.61 million mu of cultivated land.  The prefecture is bounded-on the
 north by the Changjiang River and on the south by Lake Taihu.  The.'land is
 vertile while sunlight, heating and water resources are plentiful.  It is
 one of the principal rice producing areas in the country.  Since the middle
 period of the 1960's, following the promotion of the triple-cropping system
 (wheat and 2 crops of rice) and the use of chemical fertilizer, it has
 achieved an enormous development in grain production.  During the 1970's,
 its average annual contribution of commercial grain to the state was 2.35
 billion jin.  In particular, in 1979, the prefecture produced 8.25 billion
 jin of grain and contributed 2.51 billion jin of commercial grain to the state.
 Although the cultivated land of the prefecture is only about 9 percent of the
 total cultivated land of the provinces, its grain output was 17 percent of
 that of the procince and the state purchases of grain from the prefecture
 constituted 21 percent of those from the whole province.  Thus, in the read-
 justment of the agricultural production structure, how to maintain this
 prefecture's good standing in grain production and how to make it contribute
 more to the state, is an important problem.
 From the following tables, we can see the great changes in the agricultural
 production structure of Suzhou Prefecture in recent years:

 The changes in the agricultural production structure of Suzhou Prefecture
 have the following basic special features:
 (1)  A gradual reduction in the relative weight of the plantation industry.
 In 1976, the output value of the plantation industry of the prefecture was
 61.8 percent of the gross output value of agriculture.  In 1981, it dropped
 to only 31.6 percent and was 50 percent lower than the national average level.
 (2)  Rapid development in industrial and sideline production (mainly in the
 communes, brigades and production teams).  This has given rise to joint
 agricultural-industrial-sideline operations and industry and sideline produc-
 tion supporting agriculture.  In 1980, the gross receipts from agriculture,,,
 industry and sideline production of Suzhou Prefecture amounted to 5.098 bil-
 lion yuan, of which agriculture occupied 19.61 percent; sideline production,
 13.24 percent; and industry, 67.15 percent.  Although industry and sideline
 production accounted for but 32 percent of the total labor power consumed by
 all three branches, their output value amounted to 70 percent of the total;
 whereas the plantation trade consumed 68 percent of the total labor power
 and its output value was but 23.1 percent of the total.  During that year, in
 the entire prefecture, average per capita income amounted to 164.79 yuan, of
 which 74.29 yuan, or 45.1 percent, was derived from industry, 41.09 yuan, or
 24.9 percent, from sideline production, and 49.36 yuan, or only 30 percent,
 from agriculture.  Over the last 2 years, due to grain output being reduced
 by 2.5 billion jin, the net receipts were reduced by 375 million yuan.  Never-
 theless, as a.result of the rapid development of industry and sideline produc-
 tion, the income of the commune members not only did not decrease but actually
 increased steadily. In 1981, the average income of the peasants was 175.5
 yuan per person, an increase of 19.4 yuan over 1980.  The rapid growth of
 industry in the communes, production brigades and production brigades and
 production teams has provided plentiful funds for the development of agricul-
 tural production.                  According to statistics compiled by the bureau of statistics
 of the prefecture, during the 4 years from 1977 to 1980, the funds provided by
 the industries of the communes, production brigades and production teams of
 the prefecture to agriculture amounted to 415 million yuan, of which the
 amount provided in 1980 alone was some 104 million yuan.  This was 120 percent
 more than the state's investment in agriculture in the prefecture.  In addi-
 tion, the industries provided agriculture with a large quantity of material
 resources and took up the burden of producing, for the prefecture, medium-size
 and small farm tools as well as  equipment for water conservancy projects.
 Also, a large force of agricultural technical personnel was trained.  All this
 clearly has helped in promoting the development of agricultural production and
 modernization.
 (3)  Animal husbandry, fisheries and forestry have also achieved development to
 varying degrees.   Suzhou Prefecture is located between Shanghai and Nanjing.
 In order to cater to the growing needs of the urban areas for animal husbandry
 products.and fishery products,.both of these trades have enjoyed relatively
 great development there in recent years.  In 1981, compared with 1976, the
 population of pigs increased by 510,000 head, the number of pigs taken out of
 the farms increased by 1 million head and the rate of pigs leaving the farms
 was raised by 37 percent.  As for fishery products, the volume of output
 increased by 7,613 tons, or 14.6 percent.  At the same time, the number of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 herbivorous animals such as rabbits and sheep, reared on the farms likewise
 showed a steady increase.  Forestry occupies a relatively minor position in
 the prefecture but, compared with 1976, a large increase was seen in the
 number of mulberry trees, tea plants, fruit trees and wooded forests.
 Seen from the above and looking at the prefecture alone, the evolution in
 the agricultural production structure of Suzhou Prefecture has been compara-
 tively rational.  The major manifestations of this are:  Industry and side-
 line production are closely joined together with agriculture; while forestry,
 animal husbandry and fisheries have attained a certain development, and the
 growth of industry and sideline production has been faster.  The rural eco-
 nomy is steadily shifting from the traditional single-line or unitary opera-
 tion to agriculture, industry and sideline production joining hands in
 comprehensive operation.  This evolution is an indication of enhancement in
 the level of economic development.
 However, new conditions and new questions have cropped up in the course of
 readjusting the agricultural production structure of the prefecture:
 (1)  A steep rise in the sown area of economic crops and a drastic decrease
 in the sown area and output volume of grain crops.  In 1981, compared with
 1976, the sown area of economic crops increased from 1.47 million mu to
 1.97 million mu, an increase of 30 percent, whereas the sown area of grain
 dropped from 13.38 million mu to 11.78 million mu, a decrease of 12 percent.
 The area for double-cropping rice dropped from 4 million mu to 2.04 million
 mu, a drop of 49 percent.  The ratio occupied by the triple-cropping system
 dropped from 85.9 percent to 46 percent.   Grain output dropped from 7.4 bil-
 lion jin to 5.7 billion jin, a decrease of 1.7 billion jin.  Compared with
 1979,, the drop in grain output was 2.5 billion jin, which was equivalent to
 44 percent of the 1981 grain output.  In 1976, the net outward transfer of
 grain from the prefecture amounted to 1.951 billion jin, but in 1981 the trans-
 fer has less than 700 million jin, a decrease of 1.3 billion jin.
 (2)  Increased use of chemical fertilizer, reduction of areas using green
 manure and a reduction in the fertility of the soil.  According to the demand
 of the laws governing agricultural production, the prefecture should reduce
 the area for summer grain, stabilize the area for double-cropping rice, and
 increase the area using green manure.  This will not only stabilize grain
 production but also raise the fertility of the soil and create conditions
 for a sustained high stable yield.  However, in an effort to divert the flow
 of labor power to industry and sideline production, both of which are highly
 remunerative, and to avoid the seasonal shortage and acuteness in labor.sup-
 ply due to the double-cropping rice planting system, the prefecture resorted
 to the measure of reducing the scale of the two-season rice planting.   In
 1981, compared with 1976, the sown area for early rice decreased by 1.97 mil-
 lion mu.  At the same time, because the application of chemical fertilizer
 requires less labor but produces quick results, the use of chemical fertilizer
 has steadily increased through the years.  In 1981 compared with 1976, the per
 mu application of chemical fertilizer increased from 99.7 jin to 270 jin, an
 increase of 170 percent, while the area used green manure dropped from 1.76
 million mu to 1.07 million mu, a drop of 39 percent.  The reduction in the
 use of organic fertilizer, plus the increased use of chemical fertilizer,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 caused steady deterioration in the permeability of the soil and also in its
 physical chemistry.  The mu output of grain dropped from 1,287 jin in 1976 to
 1,019 jin in 1981, a drop of 20.8 percent.  Consequently, the continuous in-
 crease in the use of chemical fertilizer. and the increase in other production
 expenses have raised the cost of production of grain to a great extent.  This
 has rendered the economic effect of grain production much lower than that of
 industry and sideline production.  It has diverted people's attention to
 industry and to sideline production.
 (3)   The tendency of peasants leaving agriculture is becoming daily more
 serious; the principal labor power is not interested in agriculture; cadres
 of communes, production brigades and production teams are devoting their
 energy mainly to grasping industry and sideline production; scientific and
 technical work in agriculture is unable to develop well.  In 1981, in Suzhou
 Prefecture the average output value created by each agricultural worker was
 435 yuan but the output value increased by each worker in industry and side-
 line production amounted to 4,215 yuan.  Of the 3.38 million full-time and
 part-time workers in the prefecture, two-thirds worked in the agricultural
 sector, but of these, the portion who had any cultural or educational train-
 ing was very small.  By far the greater take r up  of the young sideline production
 some educational training preferred to        P industry or
 for a living.  In our investigation in Jiangyang County and Wujiang County, we
 found that not only were those engaged in the farms mostly old and weak people
 and women or children, but also in the work-time arrangements the "3-shift"
 system in industry was more attractive than   ehavelong becomefarming
 a sideline produc-
 tion morning to dusk.  Grain production appeared to
 of agriculture.  As a result of the major portion of the manpower, mate-
 rial resources and financial power being shifted to industry and sideline
 production and the industrial units of the communes, brigades and teams con-
 tending with big industry for raw materials and fuels and serious contamina-
 tion of the environment, grain production has been greatly affected.
 For 2 years in succession in 1980 and 1981, the prefecture suffered a decrease
 in grain production.  As a result, the grain ration of the commune members
 was reduced and feed grain for animals was likewise reduced.  The latter
 naturally affected the development of animal husbandry.   In 1981, the popula-
 tion of pigs dropped to 6.62 million head from 8.31 million head  n 1979, aa
 d
 drop of 20 percent.   The number of pigs taken out from the pig farms dropped
 by 480,000 head, a decrease of 13 percent.  This also affected grain production
 to a certain extent.
 The causes for the decrease in grain production were many.  The principal ones
 were the following:
 (1)  For 2 years in succession in 1980 and 1981, the prefecture suffered from
 a disastrous weather and from typhoons, low temperature and early frost.  The
 single-season rice crop sown over a vast area resulted in a poor harvest, much
 lower than that of early rice.  This caused a serious decline in rice produc-
 tion.  Fortunately, a small number of communes, such as the Tao Yuan people's
 commune and others, insisted on carrying out the slogan of so-called "the 3
 water products promoting the 3-raisings; the 3-raisings promoting the triple-
 cropping and triple-cropping reaping a bountiful harvest."   (The 3 water
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 products refer to the water peanut, water gourd and drifting water duckweed;
 the 3-raisings refer to hog-raising, sheep-raising and rabbit-raising).  As a,
 result, over the past years the extent of their decrease in production was
 rather limited and, actually, in 1981, they accomplished the feat of reaping,
 a bountiful harvest, with grain production surpassing that in 1980.
 (2)   Following the changeover from the triple-cropping system to the double-
 cropping system, the double-crop of rice should each show an increased output.
 But due to the neglection, for a long time in the past, of the study and
 raising of high-yield rice strains, high-yield seeds were lacking for the
 single-cropping of rice and this naturally restricted the rice output.
 (3)   In recent years, divergent views have been held in the discussions on
 the question of the triple-cropping system.  One view held that, seen from
 the angle of helping the soil to recuperate and to regain its vitality, the
 triple-cropping system should be restricted.  Another view argued that from
 the angle of procuring more income receipts and of avoiding too great a strain
 on the labor supply, grain production should be restricted.   Still other views
 referred to the proportionate relationship of the triple-cropping system in
 Suzhou Prefecture and argued that net income should be the sole target.  All
 these views precisely coincided with the mentality of a portion of the com-
 munes, brigades and teams who were afraid of incurring losses or deficits
 and were not too willing to invest in grain production or plant too much grain.
 Some of-the communes, brigades and teams were mainly interested in industry
 and in sideline production because of their larger output value and greater
 profitability.  They preferred to plant economic crops such as cotton, edible
 oils, hemps, tobacco and so forth although these may not have all been suitable
 to local conditions.  This adversely affected grain output.
 In order to quickly overcome the situation of the drastic fall in grain produc-
 tion, we wish to make the following recommendations:
 (1)  Definitely fixing the grain production task and state purchase commit-
 ments of the commercial grain base areas.  At present, our country has been
 yearly importing a certain quantity of grain.   This is for the purpose of
 readjusting the agricultural structure and is therefore necessary.  But due
 to our limited amount of foreign exchange and the limitations in transport
 capacity, it is not possible to increase the importation of grain.  Therefore,
 our national policy should be to build up domestic production, construct
 pivotal commercial grain centers and thus ensure grain supply.   In the read-
 justment of the agricultural structure, an important commercial grain produc-
 ing center like Suzhou Prefecture should take stability in grain production
 as a logical premise, should have regard for the situation as a whole, tightly
 grasp grain production and thus make more contributions to the state.  Con-
 cerning grain production, it should not only make known to its constituents
 the gross projected output and the commitment for state purchases, but also
 strengthen"its planned guidance over the size of the sown areas.   In view of
 the divergent,forms of the production responsibility system in practice among
 the communes, brigades and teams at present, concrete plans and measures for
 grain production should be formulated and implemented.  As for those communes,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 brigades and teams which are carrying out the system of assigning responsibili-
 ties to each laborer and linking remuneration to output or the system of assign-
 because the
 ing the households full responsibility for task completion,
 relationship between the households of the commune members and the production
 teams are rather loose, the production team should send the grain production
 plan to each and every household and should resort as much as possible to
 establishing formal contractual relationships between the parties concerned
 in order to ensure the realization of the grain production plan.
 (2)  In view of the weak financial position of the country, it will not be
 possible for a certain period to stimulate grain production by means of such
 measures as greatly raising the price for state grain purchases, or to lower
 the basic figure for grain purchases, or to expand the scope of excess-quota
 purchases.  Hence, we should approve and actively encourage the use of the
 profits from industry and sideline production to subsidize grain production.
 Agriculture, industry and sideline production are the three different produc-
 tion departments of the collective economic organs of the rural villages.
 Between them there exists a close organic relationship.  The reallocation of
 profits between the three departments is a manifestation of the superior
 character of a collective economy.  The questions of labor power, investment
 of funds and economic benefits of the three departments of agriculture, indus-
 try and sideline production should not be treated in an isolated way.  It is
 entirely necessary for the communes, brigades and teams to use, for grain
 production, a portion of the state's subsidies to agriculture, in the form
 of cheaper prices for industrial products (such as special prices for electri-
 city and diesel oil for farm use).  It is also entirely correct to use a por-
 tion of the profits from industry and sideline production to subsidize
 agriculture.  Neither of the above should be criticized.  As for the question
 of the peasants' unwillingness to plant grain and their willingness to expand
 the production of the economic crops because of the irrational price differen-
 tial between the economic crops and grain, it can conceivably be regulated by
 means of the economic lever of credits and loans.
 (3)  We should strengthen scientific research and promotion of technical work
 in agriculture and develop scientific farming activities of a mass nature.
 We should speedily introduce or breed and cultivate superior strains of
 single-cropping or double-cropping rice which are suitable for local conditions
 and possess the good features of high and stable yield.  We should reinforce
 our weather forecasting work and make it cover the whole year.  We should make
 good use of the superior qualities of the rice.strains to overcome the adverse
 effect on production of unfavorable weather conditions.  We should foster the
 experiences of using farmyard manure, planting and cultivating green manure,
 and restoring soil vitality.  We should promote the experience of the "3 water
 products promoting the 3-raisings, the 3-raisings promoting triple-cropping,
 and triple-cropping reaping a bountiful harvest," and establish a good farm-
 land ecosystem which is characterized by a sustained high and stable yield.
 We must, by various means, raise the cultural level of the farmers and popu-
 larize scientific farming.
 Additionally, we should pay attention to the rational distribution of energy
 resources and the rational use and disposition of the different kinds of
 chemical fertilizer.  As for the communes, brigades and teams characterized

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 by the symptom of using much chemical fertilizer but achieving little actual
 results in grain production,.we should break the locality barrier and trans-
 fer their stocks of chemical fertilizer to those localities which have a low
 grain production level but can derive greater benefits from the application
 of chemical fertilizer on their.soil.  This tallies with the principle of
 making the best use of everything.
 The new problems concerning grain production which have cropped up in the
 Suzhou Prefecture in the readjustment of its agricultural structure may also
 arise in other localities.  They may even have already appeared there.  They
 deserve to be paid close attention to by agricultural leadership departments
 in various localities.

 PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO DIALECTICS IN ECONOMIC RESEARCH WORK
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 35-36
 [Short commentary]
 [Text]  An important method of further deepening the study of economic
 theory and achieving good results is to pay special attention to dialectics
 in economic research work on the basis of mastering the basic theoretical
 viewpoints, integrating them with practice and digesting them all.
 The socialist economy is founded on the basis of socialized mass produc-
 tion.                      One of its characteristics is that the various departments, enter-
 prises and links rely on each other, are closely related, and are in the
 midst of continually developing changes.  Both the close ties and the
 unceasing movement are different from the natural economy and the petty
 peasant economy in the past.  In the past, both the natural economy and
 the petty peasant economy were also related but the ties were very loose.
 They were also moving but the movement was rather slow.  As for the modern
 economy, the ties are countless and rather haphazard.  Modern economic
 movement is always changing and is different with each passing day.  This
 characteristic of the modern economy requires us to study economic prob-
 lems.  In guiding economic work, one must have a material dialectical
 scientific mind, and must be on guard against subjectivism and metaphysics.
 Engels pointed out:  "Dialectics, while investigating matters and their
 reflection in the mind is, in essence, making investigations from their
 ties, their jointed links, their movement, their production and their dis-
 appearance."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 19, p 222)  It is
 quite obvious that only by observing problems in such a way can our under-
 standing meet with the objective process of economic development.
 A socialist economy is a planned economy.  The party and the state can
 conscientiously make use of objective laws to guide economic work so that
 it will develop harmoniously and proportionately.  However, the process of
 development is filled with conflicts and the dialectic relations of the
 unity of opposites, such as those between productive forces and productive
 relation, accumulation and consumption, planning and freedom, concentra-
 tion and dispersion, quantity and quality, speed and effect and so on and
 so forth.  All these are contradictory relations which often occur in
 economic work.  It is the continuous recognition and solution of these

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9
 conflicts that pushes our economic work forward.  We should often con-
 scientiously study the movement of conflicts in the economic realm and
 study the dialectic relationships of the unity of opposites of the various
 conflicts. Only by doing so can one correctly stipulate and implement
 principles and policies and give sound-guidance in work so as to avoid
 one-sidedness.
 Marxist economic theory and the party's economic principles and policies,
 in the final analysis, reflect and summarize the dialectic relations of
 objective matters in the economic realm.  "Das Kapital" by Marx begins
 with the analysis of the internal conflicts between commodities and the
 exchange of commodities.  The thread analyzing the movement of conflicts
 from beginning to end in the developing process of capitalism goes through
 his entire works.  From Comrade Mao Zedong's works such as "On Ten Major;
 Relations" and Comrade Chen Yun's works on the economy, such a thread,
 which analyzes the movement of conflicts in the economic realm and is
 good at grasping the dialectical relations between the two sides of a con-
 flict, is evident.  These works still have their theoretical power despite
 their being published a long time ago.  This is because they have the
 scientific way of thinking--materialist dialectics--as their guidance and
 soul.  We should not just earnestly study the dialectics in the classical
 Marxist works, but should also be good at studying the dialectics of
 economic works.  In this way, we can widen our horizon, and have a deeper
 understanding, so as to better understand and master the theory and the
 laws of the economy.
 For 30 years, our economic work has acquired many successful experiences.
 We have also learned quite a few lessons from our faults.  Both the positive
 and the negative experiences and the lessons indicate that respecting
 materialism and dialectics, and avoiding subjectivism and metaphysics are
 important conditions guaranteeing the smooth development of socialist con-
 struction.  Disrespect of materialism and dialectics will surely be
 punished. A cadre, especiallya leading cadre, cannot do well in economic
 work if he does not master and employ materialist dialectics, and does not
 study the complex dialectic relations of the multitude of things in the
 economic realm.
 At present, some places and units are now organizing the cadres to study
 philosophy. Whether it is the study of economic theory or philosophy, the
 study of the movement of conflicts in the economic realm and the dialectics
 in economic work should be encouraged.  We hope that those comrades, who
 take part in the study, especially those engaging in economic work should
 make a timely summary of the fruits of their studies and write articles
 that have raw material and analysis.

 CORRECTLY HANDLE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PART AND THE WHOLE IN ECONOMIC
 WORK
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 36-39
 [Article by Wu Kaitai [0702 0418 3141], Lu Baifu [7120 4102 3940] and
 Gu Xuerong [7357 1331 2837]]
 [Text]  A problem that is often met in socialist economic construction is how
 to correctly handle the relationship between the part and the whole.  In eco-
 nomic life, the relationship between the part and the whole is mainly shown
 in the interrelationship between local and central authorities, between
 enterprises and the state, and between the interests of part of the members
 of society and the interests of the whole people.  The socialist economy is
 based on the public ownership system and the system of ownership by the
 whole people is in a dominant position.  The state represents society and
 manages the whole national economy and by proceeding from the interests of
 the whole, it also regulates the economic activities of the whole society.
 The whole represents the common and basic interests of the various parts
 while a harmonious whole provides the conditions for the various parts to
 develop smoothly.   On the other hand, the part is an organic part of the
 whole and the whole national economy develops through the development of the
 various parts.  To give consideration to partial interests and fully mobilize
 the initiative of the various parts is the foundation for a vigorous develop-
 ment of the whole.  Therefore it can be seen that the basic interests of the
 whole are identical with the basic interests of the part and there is no
 antagonistic contradiction between them.
 But there exist contradictions between the part and the whole.  During the
 socialist stage, there exist two kinds of public ownershp system, there exist
 commodity production and commodity exchange and individual consumer products
 still have to be distributed according to labor.  Various regions, depart-
 ments and enterprises have relatively independent economic interests.   In
 most cases, the economic activities that are indulged in by the various parts
 for their own relatively independent economic interests are identical with
 the interests of the whole; but some activities are not in line with or even
 damage the interests of the whole.  This situation represents the contradic-
 tion between long-term interests and intermediate interests and between the
 interests of the part and the interests of the whole.  This contradiction is
 a contradiction among the people with identical basic interests but it will
 hinder the smooth development of the national economy if we fail to correctly
 handle it.

 The correct principle for correctly handling the relations between the part
 and the whole in economic work is overall consideration.  That is to say, on
 the one hand, the part must obey the whole with the whole as the key.
 Various regions and enterprises must in no way purely seek their own partial
 interests, nor must they put partial interests above overall interests.  On
 the contrary, they must take the whole country into account and actively
 make their contributions in realizing the interests of the whole.  In par-
 ticular, when partial interests come into conflict with overall interests,.
 they must adhere to the principle of the part obeying the whole and take the
 interests of the whole into account.  On the other hand, the whole must also
 give consideration to the part.   Under the common goal of realizing the over-
 all interests of the country, it is imperative to consider the interests of
 various regions and enterprises so as to promote the development of their
 economy.
 In our economic construction, there appeared a tendency of one-sidedly stres-
 sing the importance of overall interests and neglecting partial interests and
 a tendency of giving consideration to partial interests and neglecting overall
 interests.  The reasons for these tendencies stemmed from the economic manage-
 ment system and cadres' ideology and understanding.  Excessive centralization
 of the economic management system can easily give rise to a shortcoming of
 neglecting partial interests while decentralization of what should be central-
 ized can easily give rise to the situation in which no consideration is given
 to the whole.  From the viewpoint of understanding, some cadres consider
 things from different angles and say different things because of their differ-
 ent.positions..and consequently they cannot correctly handle the relations
 between the part and the whole.  Therefore in truly following the principle
 of taking the whole situation into account it is imperative to pay attention
 to improving the economic management system as well as improving the level of
 cadres' ideology and understanding.
 Excessive centralization of the economic management system and the situation
 in which local localities and enterprises do not have relative autonomy will
 eventually affect the initiative of localities and enterprises and is not in
 the interests of the development of the national economy.  Since the convening
 of the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the party and
 government have implemented the principle of readjusting, restructuring,
 reorganizing and upgrading, implemented the policy of enlivening economic
 activities, paid attention to partial economic interests, delegated more
 financial power and flexibility to the localities and expanded the autonomy
 of enterprises, and to a certain degree, all these measures have changed the
 situation in which enterprises are rigidly controlled.  At the same time,
 various forms of production responsibility system have been introduced in
 rural areas while the autonomy of production teams has been expanded.  These
 measures have played a tremendous role in mobilizing the initiative of locali-
 ties, enterprises and laborers as well as in developing the national economy.
 But during the reform of the economic system over the past few years, some
 related measures were not complete and some comrades lacked the understanding
 and method of how to correctly handle the relations between the part and the
 whole.  Therefore the tendency of departmentalism and separatism in economic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 work that only considers partial interests and neglects the overall interests
 of the country has grown.  For example, in agricultural production, some
 places did not follow the requirement of state planning and instead they
 decreased at will the acreage for the production of grain crops and expanded
 the acreage for the production of industrial crops; in production construc-
 tion, some regions and enterprises did not follow the unified state planning
 and blindly carried out production and construction in their bid to increase
 local financial revenues or get more retention of profits; in distribution of
 financial power, some enterprises decreased at will the basic profit from
 assigning production quotas and the basic profit retention, increased profit
 retention and provided awards at will while in the sector of circulation, some
 regions blockaded each other in economic matters, interfered with and divided
 the socialist unified market, arbitrarily lowered the quotas for state pur-
 chase and purchase by assignment of agricultural products and arbitrarily
 expanded the amount of goods purchased in excess of the quota at negotiated
 prices.  These problems are not major problems, but if we do not pay enough
 attention to and resolve these problems in due time, they will eventually
 affect the readjustment of the national economy, the healthy development of
 the reform of the economic system and the improvement of economic effects and
 cause unfavorable results economically and politically.
 In order to handle well the relations between the part and the whole it is
 necessary to take measures both in understanding and policy and to solve the
 following problems.
 First, handle well the relations between mobilizing the initiative of locali-
 ties and enterprises and persisting in the planned economy.   In order to
 overcome the shortcoming of rigid control, we. have over the past few years
 expanded the autonomy and interests of localities and enterprises and as a
 result, the initiative of the various parts has been mobilized.  This
 measures is absolutely correct.  But we cannot consequently think that when
 the initiative of the various parts has been mobilized, the whole national
 economy will be able to develop harmoniously.  Comrade Chen Yun pointed out
 in 1957: it is totally necessary to expand the autonomy of localities, but we
 must also step up the work of balancing the whole country because economic
 units are dispersed and without overall balance, the economy is not a planned
 economy.  In the past if the various departments of the central authorities
 neglected the localities and when autonomy is handed to localities, there may
 be a tendency for these departments to neglect the overall situation.  There-
 fore it is imperative to properly decentralize autonomy and at the same to
 strengthen centralization.   Following decentralization of autonomy, balancing
 work must in no way be weakened; on the contrary, it must be stepped up.
 These words of Comrade Chen Yun are still of great significance for us today
 in correctly handling the relations between the part and the whole.  When we
 are carrying out the open-door policy and enlivening domestic economic
 activities, we must spare no effort to improve planning work and strengthen
 planned management.  On the one hand, it is not necessary to carry out rigid
 control.  That is to say, we must be good at consciously making use of the
 law of value and displaying the supplementary role of regulation by market
 mechanism.   On the other hand, we must strengthen strictness of planning and
 persist in the principle of taking the whole country into account.  Any
 important product and any major construction project that is related with the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 national economy and people's livelihood must be included in unified planning
 and must be unifiedly balanced by the state.  The investments in capital con-
 struction and projects that require important technical measures must be put
 under the guidance of state planning and the situation of carrying out blind
 construction and duplicate construction must be resolutely stopped.  Locali-
 ties and enterprises must strictly follow the related planning and fulfill
 the production tasks and the tasks of transferring the industrial and agri-
 cultural products that are included in state planning; they are not permitted
 to blindly turn out such products and to retain at will for their own use or
 sell at negotiated prices the goods and materials that are in short supply.
 The system of planned economy and tax must be strictly followed, the price
 and tax of the products that are under state management must be put under
 the unified control of the state while localities, departments and enterprises
 are not permitted to change them at will.  It is only under the premise of
 persisting in the planned economy and the principle of taking the whole coun-
 try into account that we are able to correctly handle the relationship between
 the part and the whole, display still better the initiative of the various
 parts and combine these two aspects properly.
 Second, correctly handle the relationship between displaying the advantages
 of the part and improving the economic effects of the whole.  The expansion
 of the autonomy of localities and enterprises and the auxiliary role of regu-
 lation by market mechanism have mobilized the initiative of various aspects
 and have enabled many places and enterprises to fully display their economic
 advantages.   Taken as a whole, this situation is good.  The question is that
 there often exists a contradiction between displaying the advantages of
 localities and enterprises and improving the economic effects of the whole.
 From the viewpoint of the part, some production and construction undertakings
 may be feasible and beneficial but from the viewpoint of the whole they may
 not be totally rational or they may even be harmful.  For example, some places
 have disregarded the whole, blindly carried out duplicate construction,
 retained the raw materials that are produced locally for their own use and
 cut down and even suspended the traditional supply among regions and as a
 result, the productivity of the existing advanced enterprises has become idle.
 In fact, such activities are not moves for displaying advantages and overcom-
 ing shortcomings.  We uphold that the advantages of the part must be fully
 displayed but before we are able to do so, we must be able to correctly judge
 what are the real advantages of.regions,.departments and enterprises.   In
 addition, we must be able to comprehensively analyze the advantageous and
 disadvantageous conditions of various aspects.   In particular, we must be able
 to proceed from the position of the whole and select. the correct orientation
 and method for displaying advantages.  If we one-sidedly stress the importance
 of the advantageous conditions of certain aspects of the part and neglect or
 even damage the overall economic interests., such advantages of the part are
 undesirable.
 Under the present situation in which the economic system, economic structure
 and price system are far from rational, it is imperative in displaying the
 advantages of the part and improving the economic effects of the whole to
 fully display.the role of economic means and to step up the necessary adminis-
 trative intervention.  In order to overcome the situation of blind production
 and construction, it is imperative to proceed from the overall situation and

 to readjust the enterprises with high consumption, low quality, bad management
 and low economic returns through closing down, suspending, merging and shift-
 ing to other modes of production.  At the same time, under the principle of
 coordination among specialized departments and economic rationality, it is
 necessary to develop in a big way the various forms of union and carry out
 technical cooperation and economic union between the processing industry and
 producers of raw materials, between advanced regions and backward regions and
 between state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises.
 Third, correctly handle the relations of distribution between the state and
 the localities, and between enterprises and individuals.  Various aspects will
 be able to display their initiative only when we are able to handle well the
 relations of distribution and give consideration to the interests of various
 aspects.  At present, it is imperative to handle well the relations of the
 following aspects.   First of all is the relationship of the distribution of
 financial revenues and expenditures between the central authorities and
 localities.  It is necessary to stress that the revenues of central finance
 must grow stably and under this condition it is necessary to increase the
 financial revenues of localities.  As the central authorities got less in
 the distribution of financial power over the past 2 years, it is necessary
 to take measures to appropriately increase the financial power of the central
 authorities.  At the same time, it is necessary to stress the importance of
 tightening up financial discipline and blocking any financial leaks so as to
 guarantee that state finance will get its due revenues.  Second, rationally
 define the level of retention for enterprises.  The financial autonomy of
 enterprises can only be expanded under the premise that the needs of state
 finance are guaranteed.  In the process of introducing the economic responsi-
 bility system in industrial enterprises, the basic amount of profit quotas
 that are assigned to enterprises cannot be set too low.  The growth of the
 profits of enterprises must be distributed according to the principle that
 the state gets more and enterprises get less.  That is to say, a certain
 proportion of the profits is retained for the enterprises according to the-
 results of their business while most of the profits are handed over to the
 state.  Third, stabilize the purchasing price of agricultural and sideline
 products.  The basic amount for the state purchase and purchase by assignment
 of agricultural and sideline products must be rationally defined while
 increased prices for purchases in excess of the quota at negotiated prices
 and various other subsidies must be transformed and put under control.
 Fourth, issue of awards must be strictly controlled while the sources, amount
 and conditions for issuing awards must also be put under planned control.
 The mistakes of giving awards and subsidies at will must be resolutely cor-
 rected while egalitarianism in awarding must be overcome.
 Fourth, do away with regional economic blockades and persist in unifying the
 socialist market.  To divide the market, restrict people's activity to a
 designated area, protect the backward and oppose the advanced represent a
 backward and short-sighted policy.   Such an administrative method for protec-.
 ting the backward is very harmful to the development of the whole economy.
 Outwardly, such a method appears to be in the interests of the regions con-
 cerned; but. it is not in the interests of either the technology or the economy
 of the regions themselves.   In order to correct this wrong method, the State
 Council has made the following decision recently:  enterprises and supply and

 marketing departments have the right to selectively purchase various indus-
 trial products from other regions and departments within the sphere of the
 limit of state planning and no regions, departments or individuals are per-
 mitted to limit or hinder such activities; all the products that are up to
 the national standard may be sold across the country and they are entitled
 to receive orders from any part of the country without interference from any
 region or department.  In minority nationality regions and economically back-
 ward regions, no control must be imposed on the sales of products in the
 regions other than the daily consumer goods for which the regions are self-
 sufficient and light industrial products.  These two aspects will be able to
 develop rationally only when we are able to handle well the relationship
 between the part and the whole in the sector of circulation.
 In the matter of economic relations with foreign countries, it is necessary to
 correctly handle the relations between expanding the autonomy foreign trade
 of various regions, departments and enterprises, and persisting in a unified
 policy for foreign countries.   In carrying out economic activities with
 foreign countries it is necessary to properly expand the autonomy of regions,
 departments and enterprises but at the same time, measures must be taken to
 solve the problem of unifiedly selling products of the same kind to other
 countries.  We must take export ports as the center, organize export joint
 ventures, strengthen coordination and management and overcome such wrong
 tendencies as self-contained systems, each department carrying out its own
 foreign trade activities, competitive price cutting and striving against one
 another.
 The relationship between the part and the whole in economic work involves dif-
 ferent problems at different times.  The most outstanding problem at present
 is the tendency of considering the part and neglecting the whole.  Therefore
 it is important to pay attention to advocating the importance of paying atten-
 tion to the whole and of the part obeying the whole.  As economic workers, we
 must spare no efforts to improve our understanding.  Under the guidance of
 state planning, we must unify our actions, consciously protect the overall
 interests of the country, work hard to overcome departmentalism and egali-
 tarianism and make an effort to guarantee that our national economy develops
 smoothly.   .

 HOW TO LOOK UPON RESULTS OF THEORETICAL STUDY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 39-41
 [Article by Liu Jiaen [0491 0857 1869]]
 [Text]  In the course of strengthening
 totthesresults of theoretical.
 necessary to take a correct approach Since the "leftist" thinking was cleared away, by summing up experiences and
 drawing lessons from the "cultural revolution," the people have deeply abhored
 those empty dogmas which are completely irrelevant to life.  They demand that
 theoretical study must really help solve some actual problems.  This is cer-
 tainly correct.  But at the same time, some comrades tend to demand that
 theoretical study should, like the fulfillment of production tasks, yield some
 "tangible" fruits within a set time; others like to say, without regard to how
 theoretical study is conducted, that, as long as the work or production
 assignments are duly fulfilled, a good result of theoretical study will have
 been achieved. All this shows that a correct approach must be taken to
 results of theoretical study.   Otherwise, it will be impossible to systemati-
 cally study and grasp the theory of Marxism.
 The purpose of our study of Marxist theory is to transform the objective
 world and our subjective world in a scientific way.  Theory itself cannot
 bring about any effects.  Only when theory is linked with practice and helps
 people to deepen their understanding and thus realize the change from con-
 sciousness to matter, can theory play its guiding role.  This is aocommpplicated
 process of change which can never be completed at one stroke or produce any
 instant results.  In looking upon results of theoretical study, it is not
 proper to demand that, like.the fulfillment of production norms, each period
 of study must result in a certain material fruit.  In material production,
 products can be divided into intermediate products and finished products;
 similarly, theoretical study can directly or indirectly promote our actual
 work.   Sometimes, through enhancing people's consciousness, deepening people's
 understanding on objective laws and thus promoting the fulfillment of work and
 production tasks, theoretical study can directly show the material fruits it
 brings about.  Yet, more usually, the results of theoretical study are only
 manifested in potential enhancement of consciousness.   Only through continuous
 accumulation in a given period and under given social conditions, can this

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9
 potential factor be turned into a tangible result.  Thus, we should not look
 down on those results of study which take a spiritual form.  The influence of
 the narrow mentality of small producers on this problem should be shaken off.
 It is not correct to judge the advantages of theoretical study by only look-
 ing at whether it has brought any immediate and tangible benefits.
 The spiritual nutrition and the progress in their world outlook, which the
 people achieve through theoretical study, are very valuable.  Why?  It is
 first because, under given material conditions, man's conscious dynamic role
 C     under the guidance of Marxist theory is of decisive significance to the vic-
 tory of socialist revolution and construction.  This is precisely the place
 where the theory shows its power.   If our party did not work out correct
 lines, principles and policies by combining the basic theory of Marxism with
 specific practice in our country, there would not have been victories in
 China's revolution and construction.  If our cadres do not study stands,
 viewpoints and methods from Marxism and apply them to the practice in various
 specific work in the modernization drive, it is also impossible to success-
 fully conduct the building of socialist material civilization and spiritual
 civilization.   For plucking up for morale and strengthening our confidence
 when we are facing difficulties, Marxism, as the guiding principle, is of
 imperative importance.  In this sense, socialism would not be successfully
 achieved without enlightening people's consciousness.   Secondly, the progress
 of a man's consciousness and world outlook is of fundamental significance to
 his growing-up and to his entire work practice.  Once a correct world outlook
 is set, rather than functioning temporarily, it will determine all words and
 deeds of a man as well as his objective of struggle, thus propelling him to
 create more material wealth.  Finally, the influence of the spiritual realm
 and social practice of a man with the communist world outlook can never be
 measured by material wealth.  For example, can the achievements of those
 revolutionaries, like Lei Feng and Jiao Yulu, in their lifework and the com-
 munist morality displayed by them be merely measured by the material fruits
 in the common sense?  Obviously. not.  Whether in the hard years of war or in
 the period of socialist construction, numerous proletarian revolutionaries,
 by showing their ardent faith and dedicated spirit, have played a role that
 no material wealth can replace.  Their heroic and moving deeds have always
 been encouraging us to forge ahead.
 It is of immediate importance to realizethe characteristics of results of
 theoretical study and to set store by the enhancement of people's conscious-
 ness.  Directing it at the current situation where some people are seriously
 eroded by bourgeois ideology and the evil tendency of only paying attention
 to money is prevailing in some people, we should propagate the dynamic role
 of the communist spirit as justly and forcefully as we propagate the prin-
 ciples of distribution according to work and material interests.  By creating
 public opinion from above to below, efforts should be made to encourage peo-
 ple to cultivate noble ideals, high morality and a revolutionary spirit
 through theoretical study.  Of course, the pattern of development of mentality
 and consciousness differs from that of material development.  The process of
 "changing consciousness to matter" cannot be understood in an oversimplified
 way.   It is an imperceptible process to make progress in one's world outlook
 through theoretical study.  In some aspects, results can be seen only through

 a long-term effort.  But, as Marx says, "once the theory grasps the masses,
 it will become material strength."  If our cadres and masses are really armed
 with Marxist theory and encouraged by the great communist ideal and the noble
 revolutionary spirit of absolute selflessness, there will be a burst of
 immeasurable revolutionary strength which will speed up our socialist moderni-
 zation drive.

 WHY MUST WE STRESS MAKING MAJOR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP COMMODITY PRODUCTION AND
 COMMODITY EXCHANGE?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 40-41
 [Article by Hu Jun [5170 6874]]
 [Text]  When talking about the necessity of practicing a planned economy on
 the basis of public ownership and at the same time giving play to the supple-
 mentary, regulatory role of Marxist mechanism, the "resolution on certain
 questions in the history of our party since the founding of the PRC" points
 out:  "Major efforts should be devoted to developing socialist commodity
 production and commodity exchange."  Why must we stress making efforts to
 develop commodity production and commodity exchange?  What does this mean?
 Commodity production is a kind of production relation, under which, the ex-
 change of producers' labor is effected through the exchange of their products.
 In this course, products take the form of commodities and labor is reflected
 in the value of commodities.  The equivalent labor is manifested in the
 equivalent value of commodities.  The income of both sides involved in
 exchange is directly determined by the result of exchange.
 There are two different public ownership systems existing at China's socialist
 stage.  The state-owned economy, which encompasses large-scale modern indus-
 try, holds a dominant position in the national economy.  The collective eco-
 nomy also accounts for a fairly large proportion in the national economy.
 Particularly in agriculture, the collective ownership system is a major owner-
 ship form.  The production relationship between the state-owned economy and
 the collective economy mainly takes the form of commodity exchange, for the
 peasants will not be willing to accept other forms.  The state cannot directly
 transfer and distribute the means of production and products of the collective
 enterprises as it does those of the state-owned enterprises.   Industry and
 agriculture are two major production sectors in the national economy.  By
 energetically developing commodity production and commodity exchange between
 industry and agriculture, the state-owned economy and the collective economy
 can mutually provide the means of production and consumer goods needed by the
 other side.  Under the condition that the collective economy exists, it is
 actually impossible to weaken or abolish commodity exchange between urban and
 rural areas.  Weakening or abolishing commodity exchange would inevitably
 impair the development of social production and the consolidation of the
 worker-peasant alliance.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100350001-9
 Energetically developing commodity production and commodity exchange within
 the collective economy includes two aspects:  1) Increasing the quantities of
 agricultural and sideline products.to the maximum.  When production in plant-
 ing, animal husbandry and other diversified undertakings grows, the quantities
 of commodities will increase and thus commodity exchange will also develop.
 Agriculture will provide more agricultural and sideline products for cities
 and industry; and correspondingly, more industrial products will be sold to
 rural areas.  2) Gradually reducing autarkical natural economy in rural
 areas and trying to convert more products into commodities, thus raising
 the commodity rate of agricultural products.  This is related to the develop-
 ment of social division of labor.  Marx said:  "Due to social division of
 labor, the market. for commodities expands day by day; the division of produc-
 tive labor converts each laborer's products into commodities and equivalents
 of other's and thus each is converted into a market for the other."  ("Complete
 Works of Marx and Engels" vol 25, p 718)  Developing social division of labor,
 first of all, means developing the division of labor between industry and
 agriculture.  In this process., agricultural products, which are originally
 produced as well as consumed by the peasants themselves, will be turned into
 commodities and sold to industry as raw materials; then, the peasants can
 purchase manufactured goods on the market, which are cheaper, better and
 richer in varieties than those they process for themselves.  On the other hand,
 the further specialization of agriculture can not only expand commodity ex-
 change between industry and agriculture, but also expand commodity exchange
 within the collective economy and between the peasants.
 A vigorous development of commodity production and commodity exchange in
 rural areas may strengthen the economic ties between urban areas and rural
 areas and between industry and agriculture and stimulate collective economic
 units and peasants to make full use of local resources and develop diversified
 undertakings according to local conditions, as to speed up peasants' enrich-
 ment.
 All the socialist stage in China, commodity exchange still extensively exists
 in the distribution of both consumer goods and the means of production within
 the economic field under the system of public ownership by the whole people.
 All products there take the form of commodities.  Though commodity exchange
 of this kind is somewhat different from that conducted between economic units
 under different ownership systems, it still should not be taken lightly.  By
 conducting commodity exchange at equal value and linking enterprises' business
 fruits with workers' material interests, enterprises can be spurred to improve
 their business management and to handle stringent business accounting of their
 consumption of labor, so as to achieve better economic results.
 As for the state-owned economy, vigorously developing commodity production
 and commodity exchange mainly means trying every means to expand the scale of
 production, to increase quantities of various products, to enrichen product
 varieties and designs and to improve product quality, so as to provide the
 society with more and better means of production and consumer goods.  At the
 same time, this also means that the sate and enterprises must fully take into
 account and utilize the role of the law of value--a law governing commodity
 production and commodity exchange.  Stalin once pointed out that the law of
 value can "teach our economic personnel to keep on improving production methods,

 lowering production costs and practicing economic accounting, so as to enable
 enterprises to gain profits.  This is a good school of practice.  It can help
 our economic cadres become more mature in their work and rapidly become real
 leaders of socialist production at the present development stage."   ("Ques-
 tions in the Soviet Socialist Economy")  . In addition, in order to overcome
 the previous shortcomings reflected in plans over rigidly controlling every-
 thing, unitary circulation channels and the inconvenience thus caused to
 production and consumption, it is necessary to carry out reforms, under the
 precondition of taking the planned economy as primary, appropriately expanding
 the sphere and volume of free purchase and free marketing handled by enter-
 prises, so that the economy can be enlivened.
 When more channels for commodity circulation are introduced and the planned
 market coexists with free markets, it is possible that some negative
 phenomena, such as the activities of speculation, will arise.   So, the
 departments concerned should strengthen their leadership and management.

 WE MUST ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO FAMILY EDUCATION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 42-45
 [Article by Yu Xinyan [0151 1800 6056]]
 [Text]  When one examines the education of young people, one must realise that
 family education, school education and social education are all integral and
 vital facets of this education.
 Countless facts and figures illustrate the necessity of attaching ample impor-
 tance to family education.
 During the 10 year period of 'social chaos and instability, the spirit and
 vitality of many young people suffered severe punishment and one of the main
 reasons for this was the fact that many families suffered attacks, persecution
 and even destruction during this period, thus many young people did not
 receive normal family education.
 In addition, statistics also illustrate that a fairly high proportion of young
 people who commit criminal offences have family problems.  Such problems might
 be unfortunate accidents having occurred in the family, or parents not having
 carried out their duties of educating their children for a variety of reasons,
 or problems connected with the low moral standards of the parents, while
 others are the result of unsuitable educational methods within the family.
 In contrast, a healthy attitude in many young people can often be traced back
 to positive influences from their family education.
 China has a tradition of attaching importance to family education.  The Chinese
 saying "an uneducated child is the fault of the father" is a clear reference
 to this problem of family education.  Many sayings and stories which refer to
 family education have been passed down through Chinese history.   In particular,
 the working masses have always been admired and seen as models for the way in
 which they educated their children with honesty, diligence and industrious
 ness.  People have always referred to bad children as "lacking family educa
 tion .  Naturally, the long period in Chinese history during which a feudal
 society existed unavoidably tainted family education with a feudalistic touch.
 Both in.its content and in the method of teaching, influenced as it was by the
 low level of productive forces, the limitations of individual economy and the
 autocratic rule of the feudal family system.

 In the new society, the establishment of production relations has brought
 about changes in family relations.  The development of productive forces, the
 popularization of school and cultural and educational undertakings as well
 as the constantly developing socialist consciousness of the people have caused
 the people to criticize the feudal content of family education and indeed
 gradually abandon it, while at the same time the roles of school education and
 socialist education within the socialist society are becoming more and more
 important.  These facts reflect the basic superiority of the socialist system.
 However, for quite a considerable period of time in the past, we have tended
 to overlook the role of family education.  In some people's eyes, the condi-
 tions of socialism imply that the responsibility for the education of children
 lies mainly with the school and society, while family education is considered
 dispensable or perhaps as supplementary only and having, therefore, a virtually
 non-existent role.  This is not an overall view of the situation and at the
 very least is a far too simplistic view.
 In our socialist society and under present day conditions, the family is no
 longer a complete single production unit (some individual workers' families
 are still single production units.  The majority of peasants, wanting to
 manage their own private plots of land, within the larger group, approach
 collective contracts for production work as family units, but in this sense,
 the family may be regarded as a part of the production unit).  Nevertheless,
 the family has certainly not died out and it is still very much a consumer
 unit, while the family members comprise a living unit and a unit for bringing
 up and educating children.  For a relatively long period of time it will not
 be possible to hand over complete responsibility for education children,
 especially to society.
 When a child is born, it normally stays with its parents, who quite naturally
 take on the role of teacher.  The parents' every word and action,become models
 for the learning child.   If one looks at the country as a whole, one sees that
 no more than 20 percent of young children go to child care centres or kinder-
 gartens and, of these children, most are only in day attendance.  Even when
 children begin primary and go on to secondary school, they still spend most
 of their time at home.  Thus one cannot minimize the influence which the
 family has on the child's character, direction, feelings, school work, moral
 character and physical health, or on the child's future choice of job,
 marriage partner and creation of a new family.
 Thus it has been said that the education of children in a socialist society
 is not the affair of one individual.  This is not only because the country and
 society in general has been, and still is, implementing various schemes to
 improve and strengthen the work of educating children and young people; what
 is of greater importance is that the children of today are tomorrow's citizens
 of the socialist society, they will take on the role of masters of the society
 and will continue to build and protect our country.  They will become the
 decisionmakers for the future of our country and our peoples in all aspects
 such as morality, knowledge and physical well-being.  Thus, any couple who
 have a child immediately have a duty to society; that of bringing up and edu-
 cating the child well, so that the child may grow to become a respectable
 member of the socialist society.

 As far as communists are concerned, they should have an even greater sense of
 responsibility towards the education of their children.  Our greatest ideal
 is to realize true communism and this cannot, of course, be achieved in one
 or two generations.  Thus, in order to achieve this ideal, we must, naturally,
 entrust our wishes in the minds and bodies of our children and therefore train
 successive generations as successors to the cause of communism.  With this
 viewpoint in mind, it is the firm duty of every Communist Party member to
 educate his or her child with communist thinking and morality.
 Many comrades are already doing this and in particular, some older comrades,
 in response to strict demands from their children, have done well in patiently
 educating their youngers.  The stories of such people have been spread and
 dissiminated everywhere, becoming examples for both high-powered cadres and
 the masses.
 However, there are some comrades who do not sufficiently appreciate the impor-
 tance of family education and who do not handle this question well.  Neverthe-
 less the vast majority of young people display good or relatively good charac-
 ters and behaviour, while the proportion of youngsters who display bad
 behavior and even commit criminal offences is very small.  Hence it is important
 not to ignore the question of family education.  Here it would be very worth-
 while to consider the question of cadres educating their children.   Because
 cadres of every level are the backbone and motive force behind socialist
 modernization and construction, the good or bad behaviour of their children
 reflects the extent to which the cadres have fulfilled their duties of edu-
 cating their children.  Indeed, amongst the children of cadres, only a very
 small number display bad traits, but, because of the position in society which
 their parents occupy, the general masses quite naturally link the children's
 actions with their parents, thereby provoking criticism of and doubt about
 our cadres.  Not only does this damage the prestige of the party, it also
 influences the mood of society and hence the determination of the people to
 strive for the four modernizations.  Thus every party member and every cadre
 must consciously and strictly demand of himself or herself that he or she ful-
 fill the role and duty of educating his or her child and thereby disperse
 misconceptions of all kinds which exist in regard to this problem.
 A popular excuse amongst those who do not take enough care in the education
 of their children, is to say that they are too busy and therefore have no time
 to attend to this question.  But, with the exception of a few special circum-
 stances, this excuse is simply unacceptable.  Good or bad family education
 is not dependent on the length of time that the father and mother spend
 directly talking with their child.  To a far greater extent it depends on'
 the educational effectiveness of the parents self-accomplishments.  As the
 saying goes, "example is better than precept". Of course, the more time spent
 with a child the better, but even in the case of parents who have little time
 to spare, their child can absorb a proper education from watching the way the
 parents behave, the way they treat people and handle situations and from the
 attitude with which they confront every kind of situation and problem.  Marx
 greatly stressed the important effect of self-accomplishment on children.  He
 wrote, "we must be extremely gentle and cautious in our actions, for the sake
 of our children."  Lenin's father spent much time travelling around the country
 talking and educating people in the villages and thus he had few opportunities

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100350001-9
 to spend time with his son.  Despite this, however, Lenin learnt from his
 father's actions to be faithful to the quality of the work he was undertaking.
 Such questions as the state of parents thinking, their moral integrity, their
 attitude towards the work they do, their progressiveness in learning, whether
 they treat other people honestly and the extent of their politeness will all
 exert a subtle influence on the development of their child's character.  It
 is not a question of time available, but of the keen sense of responsibility
 that the parents do or do not have, and whether they see their duty of edu-
 cating their child as a responsibility not to be shirked.  If one takes a
 serious look at the question from an ideological viewpoint, the problem of
 available time isn of an insurmountable obstacle.  Indeed, under most circum-
 stances, parents and children have a quite considerable amount of contact and
 to say that one doens't have a chance to spend time educating one's child is,
 in fact, merely an excuse.
 In today's world, our whole society is faced with many new situations and new
 problems, including that of family education.   If we have no concise and clear
 knowledge about these new situations and new problems and no appropriate
 methodology for these new situations, then education will not achieve good
 results.
 For example, the living conditions of nearly every family have improved over
 the last few years, especially when compared to before liberation.   Such changes
 are good, especially in terms of their beneficial effects on the education of
 children.  However, if the situation had changed for the worse, it would have
 created an ideology of suffering and struggle for the next generation and
 consequently would have had a bad influence on that generation too.  Many of
 our cadres, particularly the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries,
 although they live under relatively favourable conditions, still make fairly
 heavy demands on their children.  Before his son Dong Lianghe [5516 5328 2976]
 went down to the countryside, Comrade Dong Biwu [5516 1801 2976] urged him,
 "you are a successor to the revolution and you must make strict demands on
 yourself.  You must lead a life of simplicity and hardship and suffer together
 with the masses and under no circumstances may you join the higher ranks."
 Such revolutionaries of the old generation are a model for us all in terms
 of educating our children.  However, some families are not like this, they
 are over-accommodating in regard to the demands of their child's material life,
 which in turn gives the child a feeling of superiority in life and ideology.
 Some parents even pursue pure enjgyment., commit all sorts of outrages and take
 a very laissezfaire attitude, virtually inciting their child to eventually
 take the road to crime.  We should learn a lesson from bitter experiences such
 as these.  Family education cannot help but become an important task for us
 all in order to help our offspring and descendants maintain the true spirit
 of the working people in this constantly improving life we lead.
 Another example is the present policy of bearing only one child.  As more and
 more people have only one child, the beenf its of this policy for family
 education become more obvious.  In a one child family, the child is able to,
 receive more care and attention from its parents, both on a material and
 spiritual level.  However, on the other hand, on one child families, the
 parents often tend to spoil the child, creating a number of problems, such as
 stubbornness and self-centredness.  This is also damaging to the future growth

 and development of the child.  Thus the question is raised, how should one
 love a child? How should one be close but not weak, love the child but not
 pamper it, how should one combine the processes of "raising" and "educating"
 the child?  None of these questions can afford to be ignored.
 A further example is illustrated with the changes after the smashing of the
 gang of four, when eventual order was restored out of the chaos and a new
 upsurge in technological and cultural studies occurred. This phenomenon was
 extremely positive and was in keeping with the necessary task of socialist
 modernization and reconstruction.  But, some parents wrongly saw a university
 education as the only direction for their child, with the result that they,
 forced their child to bury himself or herself.daily in academic work.  Even
 3 and 4 year-olds were forced to learn ancient poetry by heart and do
 arithmetic, with the result that the child's freedom to play, excercise, enjoy
 itself and involve itself in cultural and social events was severely restric-
 ted.  Household chores, even the most trifling of the child's own duties,
 were all taken over and carried out by the parents.  The result of such action
 was often to destroy the child's otherwise increasing vitality of life, damage
 the child's health and make the child grow up disliking physical labour and
 .lacking the ability to take care of itself.  Furthermore, in terms of cul-
 tural and technological development, the child's knowledge would often be so'
 restricted, due to inflexible and rigid study, that it was very difficult for
 him or her to. truly achieve anything.  Most of the parents of such children
 tended to have extremely ambitious ideas for their child and did not realize
 the damage they were causing to their child's health and development.
 Paying close attention to one's child's studies is of course necessary, but
 the parents who only consider the child's academic education and ignore or,
 have a relaxed attitude towards the child's moral upbringing and physical
 health and development, are causing damage to the child's all-round develop-
 ment.  If one does not pay careful attention to this question, the child may
 grow up with excellent academic standards but a very low moral standing and
 such an attitude may even produce degenerates of the likes of Feng Daxing
 [4659 1129 52811.  For this reason, it is necessary to begin moral education
 right from the earliest age.  From the time when a child begins to understand
 things, one must begin with the education of the fundamental reason behind
 man's deeds and actions so that from the very beginning the child may under
 stand the distinctions between yes and no, good and evil, honor and disgrace
 and beauty and ugliness.  The parents must teach the child to love the home-
 land, the people, physical labour., technology and socialism.  The child must
 learn idealism, morality and discipline and must learn to become accustomed'
 to an honest and simple life.  Thus if family education begins when the child
 is very small, the parents will find that they will get twice the results
 with half the effort.
 Existence determines consciousness.  People's ideology is, in the final analy-
 sis, determined by the social conditions of their material life.  The most
 important. of the conditions of material life are the means of production.  Of
 course, other factors, such as political life, cultural life and religious'
 life also influence one's ideology to an extent.   If the conditions are not
 similar, then the resulting ideology will not be the same.   Since you have
 experienced things that your child has not, your. child cannot have the same

 thoughts and feelings as you.  The effect of the same fact or event on two
 people with dissimilar experiences., will often not be the same.  Thus the
 parents must be skilled. in guidance and assistance, and.when faced with the
 greatest problems we cannot sit back and yield to them..  We must stand by our
 principles, we must observe and take note of our children`s characteristics
 and respect their rational and legitimate opinions.  Of course, to do this
 requires some learning.  While many parents have been successful in teaching
 their child to have aspirations, the child often ends up with very subjective
 aspirations.  This is simply a problem of teaching methodology; in teaching
 a child, it is wrong to pamper and to give in easily, while treatment which
 is too severe or too weak is also wrong, as is an over simplistic or over
 complex approach.  If one looks at the feudal family lines, believing that
 later generations do not improve their lot in comparison to past generations
 is not a "strict" way of thinking, but extremely restrictive and binding for
 the child.  It is often not realised that scolding, cursing and hitting a
 child who has done something wrong, has very little beneficial effect.   It
 was proved a long time ago that the saying "the rod is the best teacher" is
 not true at all.  On the other hand, to shield a child from its mistakes and
 even side with him or her, is not only to shirk one's responsibility to
 society, it also damages the child's development.  This is because this type
 of behaviour only encourages the child to continue along the road of mis-
 demeanors and the further along that road the child travels, the deeper into
 the abyss the child will go and eventually it will be too late to regret it.
 The education of children is a.question of fostering and raising human beings
 and is an extremely complex procedure.  Therefore it is very important that
 one understand and recognise the characteristics of modern youth and thus,
 with patience, give them an effective education.  Family education may be
 regarded as a scientific subject, requiring an understanding of psychology,
 the theory of education, logic and sociology.  Naturally, one cannot demand
 of every adult that he or she have an intimate knowledge of all these sciences
 and furthermore, with the popularization of the one child family policy, it
 cannot be expected of every potential parent that they have practical first
 hand experience in educating children.  Hence it is up to society to exert its
 powers and examine, study, sum up and propagate scientific facts about and
 experience in the education of children and thereby help people to gradually
 learn to adopt a communist ideology in handling the problems of educating
 children.  Only in this way will it be possible to eradicate both feudal and
 capitalist influences within family education.  And indeed we should be happy
 that the number of people who are realizing this fact is continuously on the
 increase.  Several party organizations have included examination of family
 education by their own party members on their study agenda, while many schools
 are beginning to reestablish or strengthen parent-teacher relation.  Many out-
 standing teachers are not simply keeping the families informed of the child's
 situation and progress in school but are more actively involved in explaining
 the child's physiology and psychology to the family and at the same time
 promoting and explaining suitable methodology and guidelines for educating
 the child and therefore illustrating to the families how to coordinate
 family education with the demands of scholastic education.  This approach
 has been applauded by many families.  The last 2. years have seen the publica-
 tion of several periodicals and books which tackle the question of family
 education, while special columns have been started in several newspapers,

 dealing with the same topic.  In addition,. several regions of China have seen
 research committees set up to examine family education and these committees
 run seminars on the topic as well as running model family competitions.
 Such activities are at the moment only in their primary stages and still
 require expansion and popularization.  However, with such a promising begin-
 ning, we have every reason to hope and believe that family education will
 have increasing importance attached to it in all aspects of society and will
 become an important and integral part of the cultural development of the
 spirit of socialism.

 DO A GOOD JOB IN WRITING ABOUT NEW PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS DURING THE PERIOD
 OF TRANSFORMATION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 pp 46-48, 45
 [Article by Li Yuming [2621 3768 6900] and Han Zhijun [7281 1802 0689]]
 [Text] Literature is a reflection of social life.   Social life is like an
 incessantly rolling river, continuously flowing and endlessly moving and
 changing rather than being a pond of stagnant water.  Life during periods
 of great social change is particularly so.  Therefore, in reflecting social
 life, literature should follow the footprints of practice and throb with the
 pulse of the times.
 Since the smashing of the "gang, of four,"Nand particularly since the 3d plenary
 session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, a great historical change has taken
 place in this land of ours, a land of 9.6 million square kilometers.
 Extremely profound changes have taken in the fields ranging from the economy,
 politics, law and ethics to the interrelationships between man and man and
 even to the features and soul of the people.  Old things are withering away
 and new things are growing around us and the course of elimination goes hand
 in hand with the course of creation.  Many situations have not been seen be-
 fore.  Quite a few problems, even problems which have never been thought of,
 have been actually emerging before us and around us.  This drastic change in
 social life cannot but arouse the attention and deep thinking of the writers
 and bring about all sorts of changes in both literary contents and forms.
 Seen from the works of literature and art published in recent years, one of
 the distinct changes is that the situation at one time of works on rural
 subjects being relatively few is being changed and the works portraying rural
 life and especially the works of depicting the great changes in mountainous
 areas during the period of transformation are increasing in number.
 In these works on rural subjects which have emerged as the times require, the
 writers have not only succeeded in creating multifarious images of ordinary
 peasants, such as Li Shunda in "Li Shunda Builds a House," Feng Xiangba in
 "On a Village Ground," Pan Laowu in "On a River Without a Navigation Mark,"
 Chen Huangsheng in "Chen Huangsheng Goes to Town," Xu Mao and the four girls
 in "Xu Mao and His Daughters" and Wang Laoda in "Wang Laoda, the Foolish Man."
 They have also, with their sharp eyes and trenchant touch, produced lively

 descriptions and a highly artistic summary of the new prospects of rural life
 during the current transformation and portrayed, in thick and rich colors,
 the images of a batch of new people in rural areas during the period of trans-
 formation in thick and rich colors, such as Li Qiulan.in "The Manager of House-
 hold Affairs," Lao Niujin in "An On-the-Spot Wedding Gathering," the little
 girl in "Selling Crabs," Luo Xiaoshan and Kang Xiuyun in "The Love of Moun-
 tains and Rivers," Xu Lingjun in "Soul and Flesh," Luo Kun in "Confidence,"
 Han Baoshan in "Han Baoshan, the Handle of a Pickaxe," older brother Ming-
 quan and Rong Er in "The Mountain Moon Fails to Read Our Innermost Feelings,"
 Zhang Yuda in "The Submarine Obstacles" and Li Shuxia in "Capable Daughter-
 in-Law" and so on.  These characters are distinctive and vivid in image,
 utterly different in disposition and fairly weighty in ideological content.
 These characters radiate with the splendor of the era and represent the posi-
 tive force calling for making progress and a change amid the diverse and
 complicated contradictions during the period of transformation.
 These new people in rural areas during the period of transformation are the
 men of keen perception and of action which the times require.  Compared with,
 the new people at the previous historical stages, the conflict of contradic-
 tions they are facing and the problems they want to solve bear a variety of
 sossolve
 sthe
 noonly
 different characteristics.  Marx said that
 forth.  canfalalways
 tasks which history and the times have put
 people are concerned, they are naturally no exception.  This is because they
 are not saints who are above the average and tower over man's world.  Only
 when they are put in the real land and in the conflict of various contradic-
 tions which are real, concrete and strictly accord with facts, rather than
 being illusory, fantastic and abstract, can the new qualities and graceful
 bearing of these characters be manifested.
 The conflict of contradictions in real life is ubiquitous and incessantly
 present and moreover, the contents and characteristics of this conflict of
 contradictions and the relative strength of the different sides of contradic-
 tions will change with the development of the times.  This is the dialectics
 inherent in life itself.  As a reflection of life, literature on the one hand
 must not evade contradictions and indulge in the "theory of there being no
 conflicts" and on the other hand must not proceed from an abstract concept
 to fabricate conflicts of contradictions or regard the conflicts of
 contradictions in the previous period as the actual conflicts of contradic-
 tions.            It must proceed from real life to allow the characters to move about
 in a real and typical environment and advance while solving new contradictions
 and problems.  On this question, in a letter to M. Harkness, Engels made
 fairly clear expositions.  The "City Girls" by M. Harkness was written in
 the 1880's when the European working class had changed from the "class-in-
 itself" into the "class-for-itself" and had mounted the political arena as
 an independent political force.  However, in this work, the people around
 the principal character appeared as masses with a negative outlook.  It thus
 failed to correctly depict the strength of the new class in the then current.
 conflict of social contradictions and the spirit of the times.  For this
 reason, Engels criticized it as failing to really reproduce typical characters
 in a typical environment.  Therefore, it can be seen that depicting the
 characteristics of the times and accurately displaying the conflict of
 contradictions are of vital importance to creating typical characters.

 In regard to the new people in rural areas who have been successfully por-
 trayed in literary works in recent years, their surrounding, the problems
 which they are facing and what they think and do are all different from Liang
 Shenbao in "A History of the Pioneers," Deng Xiumei in "A Great Change in
 Mountain Areas," Wu Shulan and Zhang Layue in "The Newly Acquainted Companions"
 and from Li Shuangshuang "The Profile of Li Shuangshuang."  They are all
 stamped with the brand of the new historical period.  This characteristic is
 manifested in the two following aspects in a striking way:  One is that the
 conflict of contradictions they are facing are contradictions which are
 a      derived from the principal contradiction within the country at the present
 stage, that is, "the contradiction between the demand of the people for rapid
 economic and cultural development and the existing state of our economy and
 IF&    culture which falls short of the needs of the people" and therefore, large
 numbers of contradictions are contradictions among the people.  The other is
 that most of these conflicts of contradictions are centered on and develop
 around the implementation of the party's various rural policies including
 the various forms of production responsibility system which have been imple-
 mented since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.   It
 is justifiable to say that these works are a resounding echo of the new changes
 which have taken place in the rural areas at the present stage.
 The short story "Selling Crabs" describes the contradiction-between the
 beautiful and the ugly and between the public and private interests which
 clash on the crab market in a small coastal town after the party's rural eco-
 nomic policies have been implemented.  The crab-selling little girl who "is
 like a flower bud under the light of the early morning sun" engages in
 individual operation.  In the previous literary works, this was very often
 regarded as the "spontaneous tendency towards capitalism" which was bound to
 be criticized and negated politically.  But in this work, on this crab market,
 the deep sympathy she has for and the generous gifts she presents to the thin
 old.man and the dramatic dispute between the little girl and the fat man
 manifest her crystal transparent heart and appropriate political conscious-
 ness.  What is presented in "Confidence" is another new problem which the
 people during the period of transformation are confronted with, that is, how
 should we treat the comrades who opposed and attacked us and who have been
 proved by practice to have made mistakes in the twists and turns and who took
 the wrong path in history.  After Luo Kun, party branch secretary of the Luocun
 brigade, was reinstated, his son Luo Hu and the sons and daughters of the
 cadres who were targets of criticism and attack during the movement, gathered
 together to pick a quarrel and as a retaliation, to make trouble and hurt the
 son of the old man Meng Tian, chairman of the brigade's poor and lower-middle
 peasants' association, who made others suffer during the movement.  This
 incident makes the "relationship" between those who made others suffer and
 those who suffered "unprecedentedly tense" and "an uneasy feeling spread all
 over the streets and lanes of Luo Village."  At this moment, proceeding from
 the overall situation of political stability and unity, Luo Kun properly and
 fairly handles this incident without bearing previous ill will, thus putting
 an end to the disorderly situation of Luo Village.  He says:   "Those who made
 mistakes will gradually draw a lesson.  We, once the targets of criticism and
 attack during the movement should be unprejudiced rather than planting
 grievance in the hearts of our later generations."  The works, such as "The
 .Manager of Household Affairs" and "The Love of Mountains and Rivers," give a

 vivid description of the change in the party's class policy and the conflict
 of contradictions centering around this change since the focus of the party's
 work was shifted on the four modernizations program and thus creates the
 images of new people in rural areas who radiate with splendor, such as Li
 Qiulan, Luo Xiaoshan and Kang Xiuyun.  Under the grey hair of Li Qiulan--the.
 principal character--there is still "a scar,left by the water pipe" of her
 master Liu Jingui.  But when Liu Jingui comes to visit as a patriotic over-
 seas Chinese, taking the interests of the whole into account, she treats him
 with due respect and thus criticizes with her concrete deeds the mentality
 and actions of a small number of people in real life, who in disregard of
 moral integrity and national dignity, worship foreign things and fawn on
 foreign powers.  She is simple, unadorned and open-minded, mature while
 shrewish and resourceful while honest.  She reflects as ordinary working
 women's confidence and sense of pride of being the master of the country in
 the socialist motherland.  The environment where the above-mentioned new
 people in rural areas during the period of transformation live and the con-
 flict of contradictions they are facing all are new.  It is precisely in this
 new social environment and in the conflict of new contradictions that they can
 fairly sharply perceive and put the demands of the times into effect,
 enthusiastically participate in solving the present.questions concerning
 politics, the economy and ethics and struggle to advance the course of the
 four modernizations.
 These new people in rural areas during the period of transformation have not
 only gone through a path full of difficulties and setbacks but are also facing
 the dawn of a new life.  Therefore, we can find in them a projection of the
 struggle between the past and the future.  Compared with the images of new
 people reflected in the previous literary works, their disposition seems to
 be more distinctively arranged, their experience seems to be more extraordinary
 and their feelings seems to be richer.
 Hegel said:   "Every man is an integral whole.  He constitutes himself a world.
 Every man is a man in the full sense and full vitality rather than a fabled
 abstract thing with isolated features of disposition."   ("Aesthetics" vol 1,
 p 303)  Whether it is Xu Lingjun, Luo Xiaoshan, Li Qiulan, Brother Mingquan and
 Rong Er Lao Niujin, Luo Kun, or Han Baoshan, they all have their own unique
 ways of thinking and action, their own successes and failures, honors and dis-
 grace, joys and sorrows, their own special career and course of development
 of disposition and also their own complicated world of feelings, and there-
 fore they are all "men in the full sense and full of vitality."  Xu Lingjin
 in "Soul and Flesh" is a boy who was forsaken by a rich man and is also a
 "young pioneer" who was brought up in the very warm breast of the motherland.
 When he becomes full-grown, he is subjugated to unredressed injustice in the
 tortuous gradual progress of history and for this reason he falls into dire
 straits and disappointment.  However, in the beautiful and rich land of the
 motherland, amid the rough but warm masses of the people and in the ordinary
 but lofty work, "his depression, his sorrows and his grievance about the fate"
 are eventually dispelled.  Moreover, he has the deepest and the most sincere
 love for his motherland, pastureland and wife and for the good and honest
 people who gave him warmth during difficult times.  When he is confronted with
 two roads:  one to go to the United States of America and the other to stay in
 the pastureland which is relatively poor for the time being, he determinedly

 makes a correct decision of returning to the land which brought him up.  This
 character embodies not only a profound pondering of history but also the per-
 sistent pursuit of the future.  This profound pondering and persistent pursuit
 constitute a pronounced characteristic of the images of new people during the
 period of transformation--as the dovetailing point of two historical stages.
 The contradiction and struggle between the new and the old in social life dur-
 ing the period of transformation will be more acute than those in ordinary
 life.  This contradiction and struggle will also find expression in new
 socialist people.   In their veins, there similarly runs "the original blood
 of the mother's body" and there is similarly the contradiction between the
 new and the old in them.  What is different is only that the two aspects of
 contradiction are uneven, the new holding a leading position.  Lao Niujin in
 "An On-the-Spot Wedding Gathering" was a militiaman during the war of
 resistance against Japan and an activist during the land reform.   He is "of
 good class origin, capable of doing manual labor and honest and upright."
 But he is self-willed.  "If he is supposed to go eastwards, he will insist
 on going westwards.   Sometimes, he will be at odds at himself."   When his
 elder daughter got married, "he actually gave her some dresses and a pair of
 broad-bottomed bamboo baskets as a dowry rather than asking for any betrothal
 gifts."  Now it had come to his second daughter Er Lan's turn to get married.
 At first he promised not to accept any betrothal gifts but later realizing
 that other people did not accept any.betrothal gifts in the open but accepted
 them in secret, he himself asked for 500 yuan of betrothal gifts.  This almost
 made it impossible for  On-the-Spot Wedding Gathering to be convened.  When
 the county party secretary personally did persuasion work to convince him, he
 said plausibly and at length:  "Over the past years, we have all along been
 cutting the capitalist tails, the private plots, sideline occupations and also
 animal husbandry,"  "If we marry.off our daughters without accepting any
 betrothal gifts, what will we give to our sons when they get married?"  When
 the county party secretary put forth the measures for helping commune members
 become prosperous as soon as possible in accordance with the spirit of the 3d
 plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Lau Niujin actually allowed
 the boyfriend of his second daughter Er Lan to sign an IOU for 500 yuan of
 betrothal gifts on which he wrote a remark reading "repay it in the next
 generation," and then let them take part in the wedding ceremony, each wearing
 a large bright red flower.  The leading aspect of the disposition of this
 typical character is to enthusiastically keep forging ahead and reflects the
 warm yearning for the implementation of the party's rural economic policies.
 His disposition is relatively distinctively arranged rather than being vaguely
 generalized.  The author's description of those old things and shortcomings
 in his principal character makes Lao Niujin further become an integral whole
 full of vitality and more genuinely reflects the features and psychology of
 the new people in rural areas during the period of transformation rather
 than damaging his image.  The appearance of the images of new people in rural
 areas which are full of blood and flesh and are relatively successfully
 reflected is, fundamentally speaking, determined by the changes in the rural
 life, in the interrelationships between man and man and in the features and
 psychology of the people.  At the same time, it is also the inevitable result
 of thoroughly criticizing the idealistic patterns of literary or artistic
 creation, such absurdities as the "three stresses" and the "three contrasts"
 which were trumpeted by the "gang of four."

 These new people in rural areas during the period of transformation are both
 the pioneers who stand in the forefront of social changes and propel the-four
 modernizations program and the ordinary laborers who work in a down-to-earth
 manner.  Their high level of socialist consciousness and the fine moral values
 are mainly manifested in the implementation of a series of the party's rural
 economic policies, in the ordinary and arduous work of the four modernizations
 program and in the correct handling of all sorts of contradictions among the
 people.  Moreover, with the development of the times and the change in life,
 and particularly with the recent introduction of multifarious forms of pro-
 duction responsibility system, the development of diversified undertakings,
 the promotion of market prosperity and the advancement of rural cultural
 undertakings, the contacts between the countryside and cities have increased,
 their relationships have become closer and social life has thus become integral
 in the fuller sense.  Therefore, the scope of new people in rural areas during
 the period of transformation must include not only such ordinary rural cadres
 as Luo Kun, such ordinary peasants as Lau Niujin, Han Baoshan and Li Qiulan
 but also such intellectuals as Xu Lingjun, such individual operators as the
 little girl who sells crabs and people from all walks of life, such as the
 workers of the enterprises run by the communes and their subdivisions, doc
 tors and teachers.   Some of the destinies and the psychology of these new
 people in rural areas and their new features of having both revolutionary
 ideals and a scientific attitude,.both lofty moral values and the ability to
 create and both a broad field of vision and a spirit of seeking truth from
 facts are already familiar to us; some are insufficiently familiar to us or
 relatively strange to us; some have been reflected in literary works and some
 have not, and some are even fields where no one has set foot, so to speak.
 In other words, in the rapids of the time, there are many melodies which have
 not been seized and in the open country of life, there are still many ore
 beds which have not been discovered.
 The rural life during the period of transformation and the profound changes in
 the features and psychology of the peasnats have obviously put the question of
 going deeper into and familiarizing oneself with rural life before us.  Going
 deep among the masses plunging into and familiarizing oneself with the thick
 of life is an important link and necessary prerequisite for doing a good in
 writing about new people in rural areas during the period of transformation.
 This is because the strength of realism comes from extensively surveying and
 studying and intensively absorbing matters concerning life and from stressing
 accumulation, not expansion.  A deep-rooted tree bears luxuriant leaves.  When
 it deviates from the soil of life, literary and artistic creation will lose
 its vitality.   If he did not plunge into the thick of rural life for long
 years, and make contacts with the masses, Zhou Libo would not have been able
 to intimately know the fate of the poor peasants and farm laborers of Yuanmao
 village; it would have been impossible for Li Zhun to write the interesting
 farmily episode in which Li Shuangshuang and Xi Wang got angry for the 'sake
 of love; and Wang Wenshi would have been unable to reflect such magnificent
 thoughts and feelings of newly acquainted companions.  At present, those
 writers who have succeeded in portraying new people in rural areas are rela-
 tively familiar with the life they reflect, with the voices and smiles of the
 peasants and understand their psychology during the period of transformation.
 This is one of the very important reasons why they have gained successes in
 their career of creation.

 Since the period of Yunan, our writers have had a good tradition of going deep
 into the thick of rural life.  Particularly since the mid-1950's, a "colony of
 writers" who give prominence to reflecting rural life gradually formed.  For
 example, the "Potato" School in Shanxi Province, which was represented by
 Zhao Shuili and the "Hehuadian" School in Hebei Province and Beijing which is
 represented by Sun Li.  In addition, there were also many famous writers,
 such as Liu Qing and Li Zhun.  Following Zhou Libo, in recent years, there
 have emerged in Hunan Province a batch of young and middle-aged successful
 writers with great vitality who give  priority to writing works of "literature
 of the native soil."  These writers who give priority to reflecting rural life
 have for long years gone deep into the countryside, had close ties with the
 masses, created a lot of good literary and artistic works loved by the masses
 of the people, depicted the tableau of life bright with many colors and created
 new socialist people and multifarious images of peasants.  In the current great
 period of transformation, we must inherit and carry forward this good tradition
 of going deep into the thick of rural life.
 At present, the times, the people and the social life which is undergoing a
 drastic change are calling us.  We must enthusiastically plunge into the thick
 of life, conscientiously absorb the source materials, subjects, plots, language,
 poetic flavor and painting qualities from the life of the people, nurture our-
 selves in the spirit of working hard, a spirit of the people being the makers
 of history, further raise the quality of the literary and artistic works
 reflecting rural life and strive to do a good job in writing about new people
 in rural areas during the period of transformation while creating multifarious
 characters.

 BE SURE NOT TO CHOOSE A VILLAIN FOR A JOB
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 15, 1 Aug 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Zong Rong [1350 2837]]
 [Text]  In some, economic criminal cases, quite a few of the criminals have
 criminal records or were sentenced before.  For  example, the notorious
 swindler Chen Menghu had been sent to receive reeducation through labor;
 and the "automobile magnate" Chen Xihai had been punished by law twice
 before.  According to the statistics in a province, 85 percent of the
 economic criminals in 12 cities and prefectures had previous criminal
 records.  However, almost all of these people had enjoyed a different
 degree of trust and had been put in some important positions before their
 recent cases. were revealed.  This is a problem which we should take
 seriously.
 It is certain that we have made some mistakes in handling personnel matters.
 Previously, owing to the influence of "leftist" guidelines, we did not make
 a concrete analysis of people's family backgrounds, social relations or
 personal history and did not take their present performance into account,
 but just kept picking on them when problems were found.  This practice has
 badly frustrated the enthusiasm of some of the comrades.  This profound
 lesson is worth bearing in mind.  But it is inadvisable to make use of and
 put trust in any person without taking their political attitude and personal
 history after the "leftist" mistakes were corrected into consideration.  It
 should be seen that class struggle still exists in a certain sphere and
 that the reactionary forces hostile to socialism are still living in the
 society.  We can never make blind use of personnel.
 "Anyhow, we should give them opportunities."  Of course, that's true.  It is
 incorrect to keep picking on these people because of their previous criminal
 cases and refuse to give them opportunities to mend their ways.  But,
 correcting the previous errors and turning over a new leaf needs a pains-
 taking process of mending their ways in a thorough manner by those people
 concerned.  As to the people in leading positions, this calls for their
 painstaking work in setting strict demands and conducting intensified
 education.  Some people are well versed in currying favor with people in''
 authority and thus securing gains, but they do not really show repentance
 for their previous crimes.  To these people, if we give up ideological and

 political work and merely allow them to work freely or even trust them with
 important work, this will not force them to abandon evil and do good but
 only help them slip back into their old ways.  This is not "giving them
 opportunities to mend their ways," but in fact a practice providing them
 with an opportunity to "go.on a familiar road."
 Some people say these people are all "able persons."  It is true that our
 modernization construction needs a large number of able persons with  real
 ability and learning.  Efforts should be made to seek more gifted people
 and create necessary conditions for giving full play to their abilities.
 Those stupid things, like inhibiting talented people by cooking up various
 pretexts, can by no means occur any more.  But this does not include those
 "able persons" who harbor hatred for socialism and always intend to sabotage
 it.  Who is able to say that those criminals who have committed big crimes
 are all big fools without any abilities?  But is it not true that the
 bigger abilities they have, the worse scourge they will bring to our party
 and our nation?  Wei Zheng of the Tang dynasty said:  "Misusing an evil
 person who carries out perverse acts by issuing false orders will bring on
 enormous troubles."  This is worth taking as reference.
 "Ability" should also be subject to analysis, and we should see what kind of
 ability it is.  Those "automobile magnates" did not know well the normal
 operation of the socialist automobile industry.  What they were able to do
 was nothing but the tricks, like practicing graft and speculation, which
 used to be played by the previous lawbreaking capitalists.  This ability can
 only harm our socialist cause.  Isn't it a fact that the money and material
 they have the "ability" to make available for their units come at the
 expense of the socialist cause as a whole, and in this course, with their
 own pockets first being lined by means of graft?  How can they be regarded
 as "able persons" for our socialist nation?  They are nothing but a handful
 of moths and borers.
 It is strange that some of our comrades have failed to see the real features
 of these notorious figures who acted not only surreptitiously but more
 often, overtly.   There are, perhaps, at least two reasons:   1) These people
 are so good at flattering people and currying favor with them, that people
 cannot help but being taken in by them as time passes.  2) More importantly,
 our comrades have lost the correct guideline.  When you have paid all
 attention to money and put the socialist orientation out of your mind, how
 can you perceive the problems of these resourceful "wealth gods," to whom:'
 you never feel you have given excessive support and commendation?  Thus, it
 can be seen that the key in properly handling personnel matters lies in
 keeping a firm and correct guiding principle in the mind of leading com-
 rades.
 Personnel matters must be handled very cautiously, for these matters
 directly concern the success or failure of our cause.  The struggle of
 cracking down on serious criminal activities in the economic field has
 given us a political lesson on these matters.  In the course of this
 struggle, not only have we seen our own defects, we will also bear this
 familiar sentence with new meaning more deeply in our mind:  Take politics
 into consideration when making use of personnel!
