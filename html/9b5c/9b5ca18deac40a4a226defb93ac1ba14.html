 April 23, 1975
 There is near unanimous agreement among senior South
 Vietnamese civilian and military-officials that President
 Thieu's decision to resign was a good one and that a new
 government should be formed immediately to attempt to
 arrange ne otiations with the communists..
 General "Big" Minh, probably the leading candidate
 to head a new cabinet, is calling for a new government
 that would include staunch anti-Thieu members of the
 Catholic and Buddhist opposition groups.   Former vice
 president Ky wants to lead a new government that would
 include General Vien, the chairman of the Joint General
 Staff, and former prime minister Khiem.
 There is
 a so some maneuvering in the Senate  o rep ace Tran Van
 Lam with Buddhist leader Vu Van Mau in order to allow
 Mau to become president when Huong resigns.
 The South Vietnamese Foreign Ministry today called
 for an immediate cease-fire and negotiations without pre-
 conditions for a political settlement.  The communists im-
 mediately rejected the proposal.
 Communist reaction to Thieu's resignation provides
 no encouragement for the prospects of meaningful nego-
 tiations.  The Viet Cong's Provisional Revolutionary
 Government dismissed Thieu's departure as a "clumsy and
 deceptive trick."  Hanoi radio and the party daily, Nhan
 Dan, focused on the continuation of American support for
 the new government and stated that the US in effect had
 replaced. one loser with another.
 The North Vietnamese commentaries also gave consid-
 erable attention to the withdrawal of Americans from
 South Vietnam.  They stated that all Americans could be
 evacuated "in a very short time, even in one day, without

 any difficulty or obstacle."  They went on to condemn
 US expressions of concern about communist reprisals and
 warned against any US effort to evacuate large numbers
 of South Vietnamese.  US naval vessels moving toward
 South Vietnamese waters, it was stated, are far more
 than would be needed simply to evacuate Americans.
 In short, the communists are continuing to demand
 a totally new South Vietnamese government and a quick
 and total US withdrawal as the price for a negotiated
 surrender.  At least in their public commentary, there
 is no hint of give in their position, and there is a
 clear implication that time is quickly running out.
 The level of communist shellings and ground attacks
 has fallen off sharply as both sides appear to be getting
 ready for future combat.  The only significant military
 action yesterday was the reopening of Route 22 south of
 Tay Ninh city, which allowed the remainder of the South
 Vietnamese 25th Division to withdraw from Tay Ninh city-,
 to  overnment lines nearer S--on.
 A South Vietnamese estimate of communist intentions
 and capabilities as of April 22 indicates that the cur-
 rent lull in military activity is only to permit the com-
 munists time to prepare their forces and coordinate plans
 to launch a combined attack on Saigon and Bien Hoa.  The
 estimate provides a bleak view of the ability of the gov-
 ernment forces to resist the final thrust toward the
 capital cit
 The estimate views Saigon's remaining forces as
 battle-weary, understrength, and unlikely to make a
 determined stand.  Many South Vietnamese pilots are be-
 lieved ready to fly out of the country, and the military

 planners are not counting heavily on their support in a
 final battle.   It is also expected that most of the
 territorial forces, police, and many of the regular
 soldiers will desert to look after their families.
 The communists also are moving on Saigon from the
 east in strength, following the abandonment of Xuan Loc
 b   overnment forces
 The consolidation of forces and
 the steady overrunning of government field positions to
 the southwest of Saigon suggest the communists are about
 ready to move at least three divisions up the Route 4
 corridor--the southwestern approach to Saigon.

 National Intelligence Bulletin            April 23, 1975
 Strains in Peking's relations with Hanoi have become
 more evident in the wake of recent developments in Indo-
 china.
 These tensions seem to be centered on the Chinese
 view that Hanoi may intend to extend its hegemony over
 Cambodia and Laos as well as South Vietnam, and the pos-
 sibility that Moscow also will increase its influence in
 the area.   The rapid South Vietnamese military collapse,
 coupled with the Cambodian insurgents' victory, appears
 to have heightened Peking's concern because it has forced
 the Chinese to come to grips now with problems they prob-
 ably would have preferred to postpone.
 Speeches by two Chinese leaders at separate func-
 tions in Peking over the weekend reflect the high level
 of Chinese wariness about Hanoi's intentions.   Through-
 out the ceremonies surrounding the visit of North Korean
 President Kim Il-song and the celebrations of the insur-
 gent victory in Cambodia, there was a notable absence of
 any reference to Hanoi's role in recent Indochina devel-
 opments.   Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, in his speech at
 the welcoming banquet for Kim, did, however, pledge Chi-
 nese support to the South Vietnamese communists in their
 efforts to "uphold the Paris Agreement and defend their
 national rights."  Defense Minister Yeh Chieng-ying also
 referred to the importance of the Paris Agreement--a
 theme the North Vietnamese have recently been downplay-
 ing--in his speech at the Cambodian "victory rally"
 Saturday in Peking.
 Although the lack of any reference to North Vietnam
 is probably in part related to the fiction that only
 South Vietnamese are engaged in the fighting there,  it
 is nevertheless striking that the Chinese failed to men-
 tion Hanoi during ceremonies that at least in part were
 intended to demonstrate Asian "revolutionary unity."

 Both speeches seem to reflect apprehension that
 Hanoi will now move promptly to unify Vietnam.                  Given
 Chinese concern that the North Vietnamese regime has
 "tilted" in the direction of Moscow, Peking probably
 hopes that reunification will be postponed until well in
 the future.   Since the signing of the Paris accords, the
 Chinese have attempted to increase their equities with
 the FRG, but they almost certainly recognize that they
 can do little to thwart Hanoi on the reunification issue.
 Chinese leaders also appear to be working hard to
 maximize Peking's influence over the new Cambodian gov-
 ernment, as well as to limit both North Vietnamese and
 Soviet influence.   Yeh's speech emphasized the "indepen-
 dence and self-reliance" of the Cambodian insurgents,  as
 well as the importance of the National United Front,
 under Prince Sihanouk.   The current visit of Kim Il-song,
 who has long supported Sihanouk, served to bolster Pe-
 king's portrayal of the Prince as the primary figure in
 the Cambodian "revolution."
 By playing up the importance of their long-time ally
 Sihanouk, the Chinese are clearly indicating that they
 hope the Prince will. play an important role in the new
 government.   The relationship appears to be reciprocal
 at this juncture.   Sihanouk's prime minister also empha-
 sized the importance--both past and future--of Chinese
 assistance to Cambodia, referring specifically to a re-
 cent statement attributed to Mao that the Chinese would
 stand by the Cambodian people "in the struggles ahead."
 The implication appears to be that these "struggles"
 could involve the Vietnamese and perhaps the Soviets.
 The Chinese have long appeared to entertain doubts
 about their influence with the Khmer communists, although
 they probably also believe they are in position to ex-
 ploit latent anti-Vietnamese hostility on the part of
 some Cambodian rebel leaders,  such as Khieu Samphan.
 They may feel that their attempts to increase their in-
 fluence over the Khme                  have not been entirely
 successful, however.

 Both Teng and Yeh decried Soviet actions with regard
 to Cambodia.   Yeh pointed out that Moscow had maintained
 diplomatic ties with the "Lon Nol clique" after Sihanouk's
 ouster and that it had changed its tune only at the last
 moment.   Despite these protestations, the Chinese are al-
 most certainly concerned--perhaps somewhat irrationally--
 that recent developments in Indochina will work to Moscow's
 advantage.
 Sihanouk's foreign minister,  Sarin Chhak, enunciated
 similar concerns in a recent visit to Ghana.   He told the
 Ghanaians that,  in effect, the Cambodians consider them-
 selves allied with the Chinese against both the Soviets
 and the North Vietnamese.
 The North Vietnamese themselves appear to anticipate
 increasing difficulties in their relations with Peking,
 at least so far as Cambodia is concerned.
 INR believes that the level of tensions between
 Peking and Hanoi has not reached the stage implied in
 this article.

 CAMBODIA
 April 23, 1975
 In recorded statements carried by Phnom Penh radio
 yesterday, Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister
 Khieu Samphan and Information Minister Hu Nimm congratu-
 lated insurgent forces for "final victory... in the
 people's war" and thanked foreign allies for their sup-
 port.                        The two leaders called for "national unity" to
 build an "independent, neutral, nonaligned, and prosperous"
 Cambodia, but omitted any specific mention of reconcilia-
 tion with, or amnesty for, those who fought or served on
 the side of the former government.
 So far, there is no evidence that the communists
 are carrying out mass reprisals against the civilian Po l
 ulation.
 There is still no firm evidence on the fate of
 senior figures captured by the communists in Phnom Penh,
 but most Westerners in the capital are safe.   Six United

 The preliminary conclusions of Admiral Rosa Coutin-
 ho's investigation into the coup attempt on March 11
 were released to the Portuguese public yesterday, and
 they are not likely to have a major impact on the elec-
 tion for a constituent assembly on Friday.
 Moderate parties had feared they would be implicated
 in the plot and that the report would give the Armed
 Forces Movement an excuse to cancel the election.   Ex-
 cerpts from the findings, however, do not bear out these
 fears.  No direct connection was drawn between the mod-
 erate parties and the coup plotters, although Socialist
 Party leader Mario Soares and the respected weekly news-
 paper Expresso, operated by members of the Popular Demo-
 cratic Party, were chided for contributing to the uncer-
 tain atmosphere that encouraged the coup attempt.
 The report commended the Communists for mobilizing
 popular opposition to the coup effort.  The passage may
 have been intended as a boost for the party in the elec-
 tion, but the impact will be limited.
 The unsuccessful coup attempt is blamed on the
 "forces of national and international capitalism, high
 finance, and its allies."   Foreign criticism of the mili-
 tary government is said to have incited a conservative
 reaction.  The US government was indirectly :Linked to
 the plot by the inclusion of a Portuguese press article,
 which mentions Ambassador Carlucci's alleged support for
 former president Spinola's counterrevolutionary efforts.
 The Coutinho report offers an explanation of the
 events of March 11 obviously designed to show the Armed
 Forces Movement in the best light.   Specifically, the
 coup attempt is pinned on General Spinola, who, accord-
 ing to the report, speeded up his plans to regain the
 presidency when he learned of the Movement's plan to
 formalize its political role.   He allegedly knew if the
 Movement could handpick the president he would have no
 chance of regaining power.

 As originally conceived by President Giscard, the
 Paris conclave was to be a preparatory meeting that would
 pave the way for a later conference to examine energy and
 related problems.   The ten participants failed to agree
 on an agenda for the future meeting, however, when the
 Algerian-led coalition of oil producers and developing
 states demanded that the industrialized states--repre-
 sented by the US, Japan, and the EC--agree to give raw

 with energy on the agenda.   The industrialized states
 maintained that the conference should be restricted to a
 discussion of energy issues, or at most only to those raw

 communist domination of the labor movement is strong
 enough to block implementation of the plan any time soon.
 The vote for unification resulted mainly from the
 unanimous support given by representatives of Italy's
 largest labor organization--the communist-dominated Gen-
 eral Confederation of Italian Workers.   Their support
 alone accounted for 65 percent of the vote in favor of
 unification.
 Any effort to put the plan into effect, however,
 will be hindered by dissent within the other two major
 labor organizations--the Christian Democratic - oriented
 Confederation of Trade Unions and the Union of Italian
 Labor,   a mixture of Social Democrats,  Socialists, and
 Republicans.   Opponents of labor unity have enough
 strength within both organizations to prevent either from
 taking the next step to a single national labor union--
 the dissolution of the existing confederations.
 Apart from the bitter personal rivalries that divide
 Italian labor leaders, opposition to merger of the three
 confederations centers on the question of whether they
 can achieve genuine separation from the country's polit-
 ical parties.   Those against merger maintain that, with-
 out such autonomy,  communist control of the new organiza-
 tion would be assured.
 Communist labor leaders have gone through the mo-
 tions of resigning their party positions, but labor unity
 opponents remain unconvinced.   Their skepticism could
 only have been reinforced by the prominent role given to
 the top communist labor leader in the party's recent na-
 tional congress.   The communist answer to opponents of
 the merger has been a call to press ahead toward unifica-
 tion with "those who are willing," even at the risk of a

 split in the labor movement.   In addition to the enhanced
 economic leverage it would give them, the communists see
 labor unification as another way of conditioning the
 Christian Democrats to eventual acceptance of communist
 participation in the government.
 Further decisions on labor unification are likely
 to be deferred until after the important nationwide local
 elections this June.   In the meantime, the labor leaders
 will at least be able to present a unified front in re-
 acting to the recent upsurge in violence by right- and
 left-wing extremists.  They voted to protest the "fascist"
 provocations by calling two brief general strikes, one
 last week and the other yesterday.

 SYRIA-'IRAQ
 The Arab foreign min-
 isters, meeting in Cairo
 agreed on Monday to form
 a technical committee that
 is expected to begin an
 on-the-scene investigation
 early next week of Iraq's
 charge that Syria is with-
 holding water from the
 Euphrates River.  The
 meeting is taking place
 amidst reports that both
 countries are moving mili-
 tary units to new posi-
 tions.
 Baghdad's movement
 of troops may be prompted

 by a desire to bring a greater sense of urgency to the dip-
 lomatic proceedings.  Even before the Cairo meeting, the
 Iraqis made a major effort to mobilize support from other
 Arabs by sending presidential emissaries to a number of
 Arab capitals.  The Syrians, on the other hand, were not
 even represented in Cairo by their foreign minister.
 Damascus contends that the dispute is a technical rather
 than a political issue.

 The conflict over sharing water resources is the
 latest reflection of the long-standing rivalry between
 the Syrian and Iraqi wings of the Pan-Arab Socialist
 Baath Party.  The Syrians acknowledge that sometime in
 March they began withholding water from Iraq--which ac-
 cording to experts affects some two to three million
 Iraqis--in retaliation for what Damascus claims was
 Baghdad's involvement in a recent attempt to weaken or
 overthrow President Asad.  A Syrian Foreign Ministry of-
 ficial told the US embassy last week that the step was
 taken as a warnin  to Baghdad to stop meddling in Syrian
 domestic affairs.

 Chief of State Lopez, buffeted by the impact of a
 major scandal and the determined opposition of a group
 of reform-minded lieutenant colonels, was ousted yester-
 day by the Superior Defense Council.   His replacement,
 armed forces commander Colonel Juan Alberto Melgar, is
 likely to play only a figurehead role, however, and could
 soon become another victim of the anti-corruption cam-
 paign of the younger officers.
 Melgar has been closely associated with Lopez and
 with the other full colonels, almost all of whom have
 been removed from power, and is suspected of involvement
 in the corruption that increasingly characterized Lopez'
 12-year reign as Honduras'  strongman.   He will be re-
 tained at least temporarily by the ascendant lieutenant
 colonels, however,  largely because they have not yet
 agreed on a member of their own group to replace him.
 In a recent conversation with the US ambassador,
 Melgar described himself and a "majority" of the lieu-
 tenant colonels' group as "right of center."  They can be
 expected to maintain Honduras' traditionally close ties
 with the US and to provide a favorable climate for for-
 eign investors.
 A lengthy communique issued by the reformist offi-
 cers yesterday promises a progressive and vigorous ap-
 proach to Honduras' domestic problems.   These officers,
 in their 30s and early 40s, resent the image of their
 country as a corrupt and backward "banana republic."
 They have resolved to improve it in the wake of the re-
 cent revelations that a Honduran official received a
 $1.2-million bribe from the United Brands fruit company.
 They are equally determined to Promote  co omi
 development and agrarian reform.
