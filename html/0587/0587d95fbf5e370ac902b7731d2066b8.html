 Selective Targeting and Soviet Deception
 by Samuel I Cohen and Joseph D. Douglass, Jr.
 "However absorbed a commander
 may be in the elaboration of his own
 thoughts, it is necessary sometimes to
 take the enemy into consideration. "
 Winston Churchill
 D uring the decade of the
 1970s,  the  Pentagon
 worked hard to revise
 America's nuclear doctrine. The ob-
 jective was to be able to fight a
 restrained intercontinental nuclear
 war with the Soviet Union.
 The new doctrine was first publi-
 cized in January of 1974 by Defense
 Secretary James Schlesinger. Should
 the Soviets attack with a restrained
 counterforce strike, the United
 States henceforth would have the
 capability of striking back in a "se-
 lective" manner, only striking cru-
 cial military targe's while avoiding
 unnecessary collateral damage to
 urban areas.
 In the summer of 1980, the doc-
 trine was reaffirmed by President
 Carter in the form of Presidential
 Directive No. 59 (PD-59). Since
 that time the meaning of this doc-
 trine has become more apparent as
 its generic target list has become
 known. In addition to traditional
 SIOP' targets such as ICBMs, nu-
 clear submarine bases, and airfields
 capable of handling strategic bomb-
 ers, the new list emphasizes control
 targets-military, party and inter-
 nal security control-and power
 projection forces.
 Defense Secretary Harold Brown
 explained that this latest iteration
 was "designed with the Soviets in
 mind" and would "take account of
 what we know about Soviet perspec-
 tives on these issues, for, by defini-
 tion, deterrence requires shaping
 'SLOP: Strategic Integrated Operational Plan
 Soviet assessments about the risks
 of war-assessments they will make
 using their models, not ours."
 However, in comparing the new
 US nuclear strategy with that of the
 Soviets, a very substantial question
 emerges: namely, does the US really
 know enough about the actual tar-
 gets (and about Soviet efforts to
 deny the United States access to
 critical information, such as target
 location) to realistically and effec-
 tively implement a selective target-
 ing strategy? Or, alternatively, is the
 strategy merely rhetoric unsupport-
 ed by capabilities?
 The problem is that while Ameri-
 can planners are beginning to recog-
 nize Soviet doctrine, they have yet
 to accept some of its most central
 tenets, one of which emphasizes the
 importance of surprise and the need
 to employ secrecy, cover, and de-
 ception to mislead the enemy.
 Surprise is, perhaps, the single
 most important principle of war in
 the nuclear age in Soviet_ thinking.
 It is achieved mainly "as a result of
 poor knowledge by the adversary of
 one's true intentions, as a result of
 subjective errors in assessing inten-
 tions and plans, as well as a result of
 shallow analyses of measures taken
 to achieve surprise." This helps ex-
 plain why, in discussions of surprise
 in Soviet military textbooks, dictio-
 naries, and encyclopedias, objectives
 such as "misleading the enemy
 about one's intentions" or "leading
 the enemy into error concerning
 one's own intentions" always ap-
 pear at the top of the list-closely
 followed by other important con-
 cepts such as "covert preparations,"
 "unexpected use of nuclear weap-
 ons," "camouflage actions," and
 "the use of means and methods un-
 known to the enemy."
 This suggests a possibly critical
 PD-59 targeting problem. Targeting
 normally consists of identification
 and selection. While the process al-
 ready must be extremely complicat-
 ed-that is, the selection of several
 thousand targets from a target list
 containing tens of thousands of tar-
 gets-to this problem must be add-
 ed the questions, "How does one
 separate real targets from false tar-
 gets, and identify real targets where
 there has been an extensive effort
 (by masters of the trade) to hide
 them?" Bear in mind that the prin-
 cipal, almost only, means for identi-
 fication and location is satellite pho-
 tography-using cameras that
 cannot see at night, through weath-
 er or into boxes, buildings, or un-
 derground facilities.
 This problem is further com-
 pounded by Soviet efforts to dis-
 perse and duplicate critical facilities
 and move them on the eve of the
 war. Mobility is especially impor-
 tant, and when undertaken in anc
 ticipation of an enemy nuclear
 strike even has a special name,
 "anti-atomic maneuvers." These
 maneuvers are intended to negate
 the effectiveness of enemy strikes
 simply by moving targeted items,
 such as military units, weapons and
 ammunition stockpiles, especially
 nuclear warheads, air and missile
 defenses, political administrative
 control centers, communication fa-
 cilities, transportation assets, and so
 forth. Insofar as strategic force tar-
 geting in the United States is not a
 real time or even a near real time
 operation, the effectiveness of such a
 Soviet effort could be considerable.
 T.K. Jones, Deputy Under. Secre-
 tary of Defense for Research and
 Engineering, explained the conse-
 quences of Soviet mobility to a Sen-
 ate arms control subcommittee in
 1982

 TARGETING... Continued
 Our ability to retaliate ef-
 fectively against Soviet
 military assets is also no
 longer as clear as it once
 was. Their conventional
 military forces and nu-
 clear reserves are protected by mo-
 bility. Although we could retaliate
 against the peacetime locations of
 such military units, there is doubt
 that such action would eliminate
 the fighting capability of the Soviet
 forces.
 Soviet leadership is a particularly im-
 portant. PD-59 target category where se-
 crecy, cover, deception, and mobility
 may negate US pre-attack targeting. The
 Defense Department recently observed:
 "Protection of their leadership has been
 a primary objective of the Soviets....
 This protection has been achieved
 through the construction of deep, hard
 urban shelters and countless relocation
 sites." But the Defense Department ac-
 knowledged in 1980 that it had identi-
 fied only "relatively few leadership shel-
 ters."
 How many of these relocation shelters
 are known today, and which would be
 occupied, and by whom? The problem is
 revealed in the testimony of a Soviet civil
 projects engineer who emigrated in
 1978, as reported in the monthly news-
 letter, HUMINT: "Wilkinson Swords,
 the British razor manufacturer, built a
 completely equipped plant in Moscow.
 On the basis of expected profits, the So-
 viets were able to build two shelters, one
 in Moscow and one in Leningrad. The
 shelter for the five-story Wilkinson razor
 factory was built before the British engi-
 neers arrived. They were walking on the
 'ceiling' of the shelter and never knew
 what it was or that anything was there."
 It is entirely possible that an extensive
 complex of such unknown shelters and
 camouflaged shelters exist and have
 completely escaped detection by West-
 em intelligence.
 One high level defector has pointed
 out that the key Soviet leaders have two
 relocation sites: one to be used on the
 eve of war, the second to be used about
 seven hours after war begins.
 A recent CIA study stated that identi-
 fied fixed shelters were vulnerable to di-
 rect attack. If so, why would the Soviet
 leadership desire to arrange for their ex-
 termination by occupying these shelters,
 especially if they thought they were tar-
 geted? This wouldn't make any sense. So
 maybe they have been constructing some
 decoy shelter systems to draw attention,
 knowing we will see them being con-
 structed, and to draw fire, as a subter-
 fuge to encourage the wasteful expendi-
 ture .of US warheads; their real plans
 being to occupy only shelters believed to
 be unknown to US nuclear planners.
 The importance of constructing decoy
 targets to draw both attention and fire is
 stressed in the Soviet literature, but rare-
 ly appears to be considered in Western
 analyses.
 Not only would this make good de-
 ception sense, it also would make good
 economic sense, in the event the un-
 known shelters became known. The cost
 to the United States to dispatch an
 ICBM warhead to a target has escalated
 to tens of millions of dollars per war-
 head, vastly more expensive than the
 cost of a hardened shelter. Which sug-
 gests the possibility of a large prolifera-
 tion of Soviet leadership shelters-play-
 ing a shell game as we once sought to do
 with the M-X missile. This raises addi-
 tional questions about the ability of US
 nuclear targeters to implement the
 PD-59 strategy against one of its most
 important target categories.
 Probably the highest priority and
 most dominant PD-59 target class is the
 Soviet land-based ICBMs, in particular,
 their land-based strategic nuclear re-
 serves. US intelligence credits the Sovi-
 ets with about 1,400 .and-based ICBM
 launchers. But, the 1,400 number really
 refers to known silos. Are all these silos
 filled? And, how many missiles are
 stored elsewhere?
 The dominant theme that runs
 through the Soviet and German analyses
 of World War II is the importance of
 secret reserves. The Soviets won the war
 because of massive reserves that the Ger-
 mans did not know existed. In Soviet
 General Staff analyses of present day
 conditions, reserves "have become much
 more important than in the past." The
 "Why?" is simple. "In the final analysis,
 decisive defeat of the enemy and
 achievement of war aims are secured by
 the offensive reserves"-whose success-
 ful employment, the Soviets further ad-
 vise, is heavily dependent upon "secrecy
 and concealment."
 In examining the Soviet nuclear capa-
 bilities, two very different, almost con-
 flicting, strategic objectives should be
 considered. First, the United States (and
 the world) must "see" a strong, superior
 Soviet capability. This is an important
 ingredient of Soviet political warfare-
 intimidation. In this regard, Amrom
 Katz, a former director of verification at
 the US Arms Control and Disarmament
 Agency, has noted that the CIA has
 been a most effective Soviet public rela-
 tions agent by providing the world with
 most credible data on Soviet nuclear su-
 periority. The second aspect is the equal-
 ly dominant requirement to hide from
 any enemy the true extent of Soviet nu-
 clear capabilities and especially any
 knowledge of Soviet nuclear capability
 that might be to the enemy's advantage.
 In this regard, the location of nuclear
 forces and the number of reserves are
 most critical and most important to hide
 from the enemy.
 Considering this, does it make sense
 to assume that all Soviet ICBM silos are
 filled and that all reserve missiles will be

 fired from silos? In accordance with
 PD-59's strategy to limit damage from
 Soviet second and third ICBM strikes,
 US strategy would involve attacking
 these silos both to destroy missiles not
 fired during the first strike and to deny
 the Soviets the ability to reload the silos
 for subsequent strikes.
 We have long known that Soviet
 ICBMs can be fired from their contain-
 ing canisters, in which they remain
 stored from the time they leave the fac-
 tory assembly line. When they are fired
 from silos in test flights, technically
 speaking, the missiles leave the canisters,
 not the silos.
 This poses the following question:
 How many canisters that and lowered
 into silos actually contain missiles? An
 honest answer would have to be: We
 really don't know. There is no way that
 a reconnaissance satellite can see what is
 inside a canister. But, the dilemma is
 even more complicated than this.
 If the Soviets wished to, they consis-
 tently could conceal from satellite view
 even the delivery and emplacement of
 the canisters. They could cover the rail-
 way cars transporting them and lower
 them into the silos during periods of
 darkness or inclement weather-in
 which case we would see, in a word,
 nothing. But apparently they don't.
 Why? Could it be that they have.con-
 ducted a program of massive deception
 toward leading us to believe that all silos
 contain missiles, to insure the wasteful
 expenditure of US ICBMs and the defeat
 of US targeting strategy? Could it be
 that the silos mainly contain missiles in-
 tended for the first strike (including ex-
 tra missiles ready to rapidly substitute
 for launch aborts), and that there are a
 number of extra empty silos to create the
 impression that the entire land-based

 TARGETING... Continued
 force is silo-based and hence
 to draw fire-e.g., dummy
 targets, recognizing that with
 today's sensors, the only way
 to make a good dummy silo is
 to make a real silo, which
 would still be well worth the cost.
 Nor is this the only ICBM reserves
 intelligence problem. The Defense De-
 partment has observed Soviet reloading
 exercises and has become concerned
 about Soviet plans to reload and refire
 missiles from "used" ICBM silos. DoD's
 estimate of the time required for the
 Soviets to reload a significant number of
 silos is several days, which may not be
 sufficiently rapid to constitute a SALT
 II violation and is sufficiently slow to
 enable US forces to strike before the
 reload is completed. Aside from the fact
 that the reload time observed is more
 like one day, or as one intelligence
 source has reported, several hours, why
 would the Soviets deny themselves the
 ability to thwart the selective targeting
 strategy? Why give the United States
 ample time to destroy the Soviet silos
 before they could be reloaded. Or could
 it be that these reloading exercises were
 part of a Soviet deception?
 Why, one could argue, would the So-
 viets, knowing we would be watching,
 wish to conduct a reloading exercise that
 plainly was sufficiently slow to encour-
 age US efforts to keep all silos targeted
 in the US response second strike? Still
 further, why would the Soviets plan to
 reconstitute a force, either rapidly or
 slowly, in the main areas where rubble
 and fallout radiation levels should be
 expected to be most severe? Unless, in
 the words of Lenin, they were deceiving
 us by telling us what we wanted to be-
 lieve. Could it be that they were bent on
 ensuring that the United States would
 wastefully dispatch its missiles toward
 "known" critical targets (i.e. silos),
 while the actual (unknown) targets were
 someplace else? The cold military logic
 of the situation would dictate that this is
 exactly what the Soviets should have
 been up to. If there is one thing that can
 be said about Soviet military doctrine, it
 is that it tends to be logically impecca-
 ble.
 What a rapid reload capability
 (whether several hours or several days)
 really implies is not so much the ability
 to reuse silos, but rather the existence of
 a "wooden round" ICBM that is self-
 contained in, and capable of being fired
 from, its own canister-an ICBM that
 does not need a silo. Canistered ICBMs
 easily can be stored in garages or sheds,
 simply erected, aligned (the only possi-
 ble difficulty), and fired from any sur-
 face capable of supporting the missile
 weight. Such canisters for "sabotted"
 ICBMs are simple and cheap-sections
 of steel sewer pipe welded together are
 more than adequate-and just as good
 as silos for launching purposes. The mis-
 siles can be erected and fired from any
 location. Only minimal preplanning to
 presurvey the site locations and enable
 initial orientation of the guidance system
 is necessary; considering stellar guidance
 technology, this could be a trivial task.
 Then there is the issue of the SS-20,
 which has been "sold" as strictly a the-
 ater nuclear system. However, with the
 recently increasing Soviet encryption of
 missile test telemetry, including that on
 the SS-20, another question emerges:
 Does the SS-20, whose deployments are
 mounting, have an intercontinental ca-
 pability? Has US intelligence only been
 allowed to see the heavy-payload, short-
 range version? There is considerable dis-
 agreement over the SS-20 payload and
 range. Payload estimates in the IISS
 Military Balance 1982-1983 range from
 single 50-kiloton warheads to three 150-
 kiloton warheads, with corresponding
 ranges from 7,400 kilometers to 4,500
 kilometers. Clearly when loaded with
 only one warhead (and 50 kilotons is
 larger than the Poseidon warheads), the
 system is intercontinental. It is then an
 excellent land-based strategic reserve.
 Moreover, in such a configuration it also
 could play a disturbing role in a Soviet
 surprise first strike because of its ability
 to launch out of unexpected areas, and
 out of areas uncovered by the defense
 warning satellites, thus confusing or
 even negating the most critical part of
 the US attack warning system.
 There is no target base in Europe that
 comes even close to justifying the SS-20
 system in its most advertised form,
 which equates to between 2,000 and
 5,000 150-kiloton warheads. There are
 fewer than 30 so-called nuclear hard-
 ened targets (none of which are even
 hardened to withstand 150-kilotons de-
 livered with SS-20 accuracies); the
 shorter range Soviet missiles deployed in
 Eastern Europe, coupled with a few of
 the ICBMs tested at intermediate range
 (SS-11 Mod. 4s and SS-19s), long have
 had the capability to conduct an effec-
 tive disarming first nuclear strike against
 all NATO land targets.
 Since the early 1960s, the Soviets have
 stressed the need for mobile missiles for
 survivability. Because of their ability to
 change location and relative ease of con-
 cealment and camouflage, survivability
 is achieved because the enemy cannot
 effectively find and target the missiles.
 Were the SS-20 indeed an ICBM, its
 deployment would thwart the PD-59
 targeting strategy. There is also the lon-
 ger range mobile SS-16, that apparently
 has been deployed in quantity (100 to
 200) under cover at Plestsk; in the fu-
 ture, there is expected to be the mobile
 PL-5.
 The problem becomes further com-
 pounded when the nature of US intelli-
 gence assets used to target the nuclear
 forces is also taken into account. These
 assets are really intelligence assets driven
 by intelligence needs, not by military tar-
 get acquisition requirements needed to
 identify targets for nuclear strike after a
 war begins..' The Soviets, who have a
 warfighting strategy and battle manage-
 ment capability, stress the need for tar-
 get acquisition after the war starts and
 the need to destroy an enemy's target
 acquisition capability in the first strike.
 The Soviets should be expected to tar-
 get all US reconnaissance capabilities in
 the first strike, including any known re-
 constitution capabilities. Thus, the US
 would be blinded in the first strike. This
 would also appear to operate greatly to
 our disadvantage in trying to implement
 a selective second strike. How will this
 strike be targeted in the face of Soviet
 secrecy, cover, deception and mobility?
 This underscores a very important con-
 straint on doctrine--capabilities. One
 can only realistically change doctrines
 within the latitude that the capabilities
 will support.
 Another serious intelligence problem
 has been the prevalent attitude, not lim-
 ited to the intelligence community, that
 deception is not a real problem. The
 former Deputy Chief, Countenntelli-
 gence Staff, CIA, explained the situation
 quite nicely when he said: "So we come
 to the real question: How does one get
 people at the political level, or even at
 the high or medium-high decisionmak-
 ing level within the intelligence organi.
 zation to recognize that deception is a
 real problem?"
 There probably is no one explanation
 for this condition. However, a number of
 possibly contributing factors can be
 identified. First, there is the image of
 Soviet Union military and intelligence
 operations as clumsy and heavy handed.
 This is perhaps best represented by the
 "cold warrior" mentality that inhabits
 many of the national security cata-
 combs. Rarely does one encounter an
 image of the Soviet Union as well orga-
 nized, sophisticated, talented, and clev-
 er.
 Second, the _ US government is not
 equipped to deal with deception, except
 perhaps in a ve   specialized manner,
 and even that may -somewhai ques-
 tionable since the CIA counterintelli-
 gence staff was purged in the mid-1970s.
 All-source analysis is necessary to come
 to grips with modern, multi-source, co-
 ordinated deception. But         no
 place where all-source      s es con-
 ucte . With the exception of some tech-
 nt~areas, analysts-even intelligence
 analysts-who use the data, who should
 be most concerned about possible decep-
 tion, have almost no access to sources-
 and most of the time, security is not the
 real reason.
 Third, there is no sense of Soviet long-
 range planning or belief in the possible
 existence of a Soviet "grand plan" in the
 intelligence agencies (or almost any-
 where else in the US national security

 TARGETING... Continued
 community, for that matter).
 In recent Congressional hear.
 ings on Strategic Forces, Rich-
 ard Pipes stated that one of
 the fundamental problems
 with the National Intelligence
 Estimates (NIEs) was the disbelief of
 those drafting the estimates in Soviet
 grand strategy. As a result, they dealt
 with each aspect of Soviet behavior sepa-
 rately, "with politics and military affairs
 separately, economics, propaganda and
 ideology separately, and then within
 each of these categories, with each item,
 such as each weapon system, separate-
 ly." No one ever brought the pieces to-
 gether.
 When Czechoslovakia's General Ma-
 jor Jan Sejna defected in 1968, he felt
 that the most valuable information he
 brought with him was his knowledge of
 the Soviet "Long Range Plan for the
 Next Ten to Fifteen Years and Beyond."
 Sejna was the only Czech with access to
 the Russian version of that plan. Yet US
 intelligence authorities never debriefed
 him on its contents. Special sections on
 deception appear throughout the plan,
 and it spells out one of the main strate-
 gic deception goals this way: "To cover
 the nature and intended use of the main
 tools, of which one of the most impor-
 tant is the nuclear forces."
 Fourth, specifically in regard to un-
 known strategic nuclear capabilities,
 there is an organizational belief that if
 the Soviets would attempt anything truly
 massive, such as the hiding of several
 hundred missiles, let alone a complete
 Soviet Missile Force Army, word would
 leak out-too many people would have
 to be involved. However, rumors have
 leaked out-rumors o# missiles in lakes,
 caves, mountain hide-aways, and sheds.
 Presumably such rumors were pursued,
 but nothing found.
 Unfortunately, there are massive in-
 stallations in the Soviet Union with
 whole towns supporting them, that the
 intelligence community has only been
 able to speculate about for over two de-
 cades. Why has information on those
 installations not leaked out; or, if it has,
 to what avail? US intelligence refused to
 recognize the civil defense program in
 the Soviet Union until some analysts
 outside the government, and PD-59,
 forced the issue. Only then, following an
 extensive review of data, did shelters,
 relocation sites, and even some duplicate
 industrial facilities begin to emerge. No
 one had looked for them before. The
 Soviet Union is supposed to have a large
 chemical warfare capability, but just try
 and find any data on it. Intelligence can-
 not even say whether the Soviet stock-
 pile of chemical weapons is 500 tons or
 5.000,000 tons; and, until the Sverdlovsk
 accident (which the Soviets claimed was
 food poisoning) the existence of a Soviet
 biological warfare capability was dis-
 missed.
 Consider the following paragraph tak-
 en from an article on camouflage in a
 classified Soviet General Staff journal in
 the early 1970s:
 If it is not possible to conceal troops
 and facilities from hostile observation,
 then one can reduce their revealing
 features by altering their external ap-
 pearance. For example, a large camp
 or supply base can be camouflaged as
 a town; a tank farm can be camou-
 flaged as apartment houses, while in-
 dividual military installations can be
 camouflaged as rubble, smoldering ru-
 ins, etc. Important elements of a cam-
 ouflage effort are the mounting of
 feigned assaults and the construction
 of dummy defensive fortifications (con-
 trol posts). Such action can be em-
 ployed not only at the tactical echelon
 but particularly at the operational and
 strategic levels. [Emphasis added.]
 It does not take much imagination to
 conceive of an entire Soviet Missile
 Force Army camouflaged as a test site,
 or deployed as a remote town, or of a
 town built exclusively to house such an
 army, complete with farming, perhaps
 lumbering, and some light manufactur-
 ing-enough activity to justify a rail
 spur and moderate rail traffic.
 Nor does it take much imagination to
 envision people arriving and departing
 by train, perhaps at night or in trains
 with no windows, so that no one in
 town-including even the commander-
 knows where they are located, or better
 still, are misinformed as to where they
 are. (This type of practice is normal be-
 hind the Iron Curtain. When the Czech
 Politburo, the highest ranking govern-
 ment officials, were taken to review a
 new air defense site in the mid-1960s,
 they were driven in buses that had the
 windows painted black to prevent even
 their knowing where the site was!)
 Perhaps the most serious contributing
 factor is an associated fear of deception
 and of even trying to tackle the problem.
 Fear over studies of deception, is no.t just
 an intelligence organization fear Decep-
 tion studies run the risk of having nu-
 merous far-reaching ramifications. A se-
 rious investigation into Soviet secrecy,
 cover, and deception could be far more
 revealing and serious than was the US
 Senate's Church Committee investiga-
 tion in the mid-1970s. The Church Com-
 mittee unfortunately did not deal with
 deficiencies that adversely reflected
 upon US national security. A truly seri-
 ous study of Soviet secrecy and decep-
 tion should be expected to be actiNely
 and forcefully opposed by most of the
 US intelligence community, and, equally
 important and unlike the Church Com-
 mittee investigation, also by the KGB.
 The above discussion is not intended
 to claim the definite existence of a large
 hidden Soviet missile force. Rather, the
 point is that the United States appears to
 have adopted targeting strategies that re-
 quire good information on enemy mili.
 tary capabilities; yet that required infor-
 mation may not exist because of Soviet
 secrecy, cover, and deception.
 Soviet efforts to defeat US strategy
 rarely if ever are taken into account.
 Estimates of enemy capability tend to be
 several times removed from the actual
 data and often bear scant resemblance to
 the data. When one tries to find the data
 supporting a statement on enemy capa-
 bilities-statements of the type that are
 the main input to the policy and strategy
 planning process-one often discovers a
 house built of cards. For example, silos
 become launchers, which then become
 warheads, throw weight, and the force
 locations. Any resemblance between this
 and the actual numbers of warheads or
 missiles or launchers is strictly coinci.
 dental, and the locations only cover one
 possibility. The estimates might be right,
 but the data certainly do not tell wheth-
 er this is the case or not. And, the Unit-
 ed States not only seems oblivious to the
 possible problem, but worse still, may
 have serious internal structures and bu-
 reaucratic beliefs that make dealing with
 the problem very, very difficult.
 In considering PD-59 and the impact
 of Soviet secrecy and deception, a sec-
 ond problem, made especially serious be-
 cause of the targeting problem, is de-
 fense. For years the US has denigrated
 any defense effort. This is the mutual
 vulnerability portion of the mutual as-
 sured destruction (MAD) doctrine. The
 reasonableness of this approach has now
 been seriously questioned and for the
 first time in two decades, the folly of
 standing defenseless is being recognized
 along with the increasingly perceived
 need for a major shift to a defense ori-
 ented strategy.
 Even before President Reagan called
 attention to the need for strong defense
 initiatives, the importance of this action
 was clearly presented in Defense Secre.
 tary Caspar Weinberger's 1983 Annual
 Report to the Congress. In his overview
 of US strategy, he identifies three main
 principles. First, "our strategy is defen-
 sive." Second, "the deterrent nature of
 our strategy is closely related to our de-
 fensive stance." And third, "In respond-
 ing to an enemy attack, we must defeat
 the attack and achieve our national ob-
 jectives while limiting-to the extent
 possible and practicable-the scope of
 the conflict."
 Throughout this Annual Report, the
 critical importance of defense in the new
 doctrine is obvious when such phrases as
 "defeat the attack," "limit the scope of
 the conflict," "deny the enemy his politi-
 cal and military goals," and "terminate
 hostilities at the lowest possible level of
 damage to the United States," are exam-
 ined with full comprehension of Soviet
 secrecy, cover, deception, and mobility

 PART T   -- MAIN EDITION -- 20 SEPTF   ER 1983
 TARGETING... Continued
 practices and the resultant US nuclear
 force targeting limitations discussed
 above.
 The goals of PD-59, or its successor,
 NSDD-13, simply cannot be met, even
 partially met, with only offensive capa-
 bilities. Indeed, because of Soviet secre-
 cy, cover, deception, and mobility, US
 offensive forces may be almost totally
 unable-to do much other than hit fixed,
 pre-briefed targets, which, if important
 to the Soviets, may no longer be valid
 targets when the war starts.
 The goals of the new US nuclear strat-
 egy truly lack credibility in the absence
 of ABM defenses, the current situation.
 And, therefore, to change the doctrine,
 once again, much more than mere words
 are required. Substantial actions are es-
 sential in both defense and offense.
 Most important are the development
 of reasonable active and passive (civil)
 defenses of our country, of which we
 now have essentially none. If we desire
 to survive nuclear war (we can, if we
 really want to), we must take measures
 to protect ourselves-our military
 forces, our civilian population, our econ-
 omy, and our government. This would
 call for changing the current organiza-
 tion, acquisition, and management atten-
 tion to include a heavy defensive compo-
 nent; in fact, a dominant defensive
 component.
 For passive defense, first and foremost,
 a sensible civil defense system should be
 designed and built. The myth that Ameri-
 ca cannot survive a nuclear war with the
 Soviets-a myth that the US government,
 for political reasons, has helped to pro-
 mote-is exactly that: a myth.
 As for active defense, despite the gen-
 eral discouragement resulting from the
 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty of
 1972, considerable technical progress
 has been made in recent years toward
 attaining a defense against ballistic mis-
 sile attack. We should-be doing for ac-
 tive defense development what we did
 for the ICBM 30 years ago: give it a top,
 presidentially-directed priority. In
 March, 1983, President Reagan took the
 first step in this direction. Were Reagan
 now to move on active defense as Eisen-
 hower did on the ICBM, or as Kennedy
 did on the Apollo man-on-the-moon
 program, chances are that enormous
 progress would be made and a reason-
 ably effective layered defense capability
 could become real within a decade.
 Regarding air defense, it is ironic that
 all the considerable gains we have made
 in this area have been applied to the
 defense of other countries, while our
 own continental defenses have been
 emasculated. In the meantime, the Sovi-
 ets have been building up' a strategic
 bomber capability which, if we do not
 restore air defense, will get a free ride
 over US territory.
 In the area of offensive strategic weap-
 ons, in deploying our land-based sys-
 tems, being a completely open society,
 we do not have the ability to disinform
 the Soviet targeteers, as they so readily
 can do to us. If we are to have survivable
 land-based systems, since they cannot be
 successfully hidden or the Soviets
 spoofed as to their whereabouts, the
 weapons will have to be mobile and exist
 in reasonably large numbers. In this re-
 spect, a small road-mobile ICBM should
 be developed with top priority as the
 main land-based missile force. Nuclear
 warhead technology exists to permit
 such a system to be fielded unarmed and
 free of threats from terrorists (the actual
 arming would take place only in the
 event of a crisis or war itself).
 In sum, the United States may be
 heading down an illusory path in devis-
 ing nuclear strategy and defenses. Not
 having taken into account the Soviet
 propensity and capability for deception,
 we may (and probably) have been fool-
 ishly playing into the Soviet hands and
 unwittingly given them an even larger
 degree of strategic nuclear superiority
 than we now admit they have.
 It is essential to our security that this
 error be understood and corrected. De-
 ception is a singularly important aspect
 of Soviet strategy. It is also a national
 talent in the Soviet Union. It is an inte-
 gral part of their planning process. One
 would expect it to be employed in signif-
 icant ways-probably accompanied by a

 Conservatives say the Korean-airliner

 real hawks from the semihawks. They
 report that only National Security Ad-

 Nobody was more surprised than the
 President when a revised transcript of
 radio messages from a Soviet fighter

 Persistent reports that Reagan will
 add Peking to his Asian tour in No-
 vember overlook two factors: Peking
 isn't ready to receive him, and the
 President doesn't want to go.
 It has been a roller-coaster ride for
 Reagan in recent White House polls.
 Confidential surveys found the Presi-
 denr's popularity soaring some 8 per-
 variety of poor efforts undertaken to dis-
 tract the attention of US intelligence and
 create the image of ineffective and clum-
 sy Soviet deception practices.
 But, where are the significant decep-
 tion efforts? How have we been or are
 we being misled? Where are the exam-
 ples of these efforts? Perhaps we should
 consider Amrom Katz's not too face-
 tious observation, "We have never found
 anything the Soviets have successfully
 hidden"-and add to it the thought that
 the Soviets may be very good at hiding-
 when they want to be.           ? -.- ^

 Playing Seesaw
 With the Superpowers
 China is not going to brood much over
 KAL Flight 007. In Peking last week offi-
 cials welcomed the Kremlin's top Sinolo-
 gist. Mikhail Kapitsa. In October the two
 nations will talk about the possibility of
 normalizing ties. And at lower levels they
 are exchanging delegations on everything
 from selling books to protecting the salmon.
 Strongman Deng Xiaoping still considers
 the Soviets to be "the main threat in the
 world." But he is trying to gain leverage by
 manipulating the superpowers; he wants to
 assert independence in relations with Wash-
 ington and reduce Soviet pressure on his own
 country. Deng intends to pursue close Sino-
 American relations: late this month Peking
 will host Defense Secretary Caspar Wein-
 berger. But to prepare the public for a possi-
 ble thaw with Moscow, China's press has
 blossomed with articles praising Russians as
 people and crediting the Kremlin with com-
 bating "agricultural backwardness."
 China still says that before Sino-Soviet
 ties can return to normal, Moscow must stop
 supporting Vietnam's occupation of Cam-
 bodia, withdraw its troops from Afghani-
 stan and cut forces along the Asian border.
 Kapitsa made no public offers on these
 matters. So although the advantages of
 lowering mutual tensions are obvious,
 straightening things out may well take years.

 Soviets for shooting down the South
 Korean airliner. But his rankings
 dropped right back with the killings
 of more U.S. marines in Lebanon.

 astronaut Sally Ride's recent flight
 plan from Los Angeles to Sacramento
 for a ceremony honoring her before

 invitation to fly with Democratic As-
 semblyman Tom Hayden and his ac-
 tivist wife Jane Fonda.
