 PREFACE
 Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
 Party and Chairman Mao Tse-tung, the Chinese work-
 ing class, which has gone? through years of heroic
 struggle, has proved that it was not only the van-
 guard of the Chinese people in overthrowing the reac-
 tionary rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-
 capitalism,  but  is  also  the  leading  force  in  the
 construction of New China.
 Over the past six years since the founding of the
 People's Republic of China, the Chinese working class,
 united with the people of the entire country, has step-
 ped onto the path of socialist construction, and begun
 to transform the face of the country, gradually im-
 proving the material and cultural life of the working
 people.  The Chinese trade unions have done tremen-
 dous work in organizing and educating the workers.
 However, we know that our industry has a very
 weak foundation, and our experience in building up
 modern industry is inadequate. The same can be said of
 our experience in trade union work in the period of con-
 struction.                                            In order to reconstruct our country, we
 have gone through and overcome innumerable diflicul-
 ties and have achieved the good results we have ob-
 tained today.  We have only just begun our socialist

 construction, and difficulties still lie in our way. Many
 shortcomings still exist in our trade union work,
 which we will continuously endeavour to overcome.
 But we have full confidence that we will be able to
 accomplish our work efficiently.
 The Chinese working class and the people of the
 whole country are more confident of success today
 than at any time in the past.  We are striving to turn
 our country into a great socialist land, and at the
 same time, in co-ordination with the workers and
 peace-loving people of other countries, we will play our
 part in the struggle for the solidarity and unity of the
 workers all over the world and in the defence of world
 peace.

 THE ALL-CHINA FEDERATION OF
 TRADE UNIONS
 The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is the
 only central body of the Chinese trade union move-
 ment.  It has more than 12,400,000 members, and has
 become a strong force in the peaceful construction
 of the People's Republic of China as well as an impor-
 tant part of the Asian and world trade union movement.
 Before liberation, the Chinese workers were not
 allowed to form their own trade unions.  But now,
 they are not only completely free to do so but also
 have this freedom confirmed in law.  In 1950, the
 Central People's Government promulgated the Trade
 Union Law, defining in explicit terms the legal status
 of trade unions-the mass organizations of the work-
 ing class.  The Trade Union Law stipulates:  All
 manual and non-manual workers whose wages con-
 stitute their sole or main means of livelihood, irre-
 spective of nationality, sex, or religious belief, shall
 have the right to organize trade unions; trade union
 committees at all levels shall be set up by election at
 general membership meetings or representative con-
 ferences; the administration of the enterprise or the
 owner should inform the trade union organization
 in advance, if they want to dismiss workers or staff
 members.  In  the  state-owned  enterprises,  trade

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 unions shall have the right to represent the workers
 and staff members in administering production and
 in concluding collective agreements with the manage-
 ments.                                   In private enterprises, trade unions shall have
 the right to represent the workers and staff mem-
 bers in conducting negotiations and talks and con-
 cluding collective agreements with the owners, and
 in participating in the work of the labour-capital
 consultative councils.  Trade unions have the duty to
 protect the interests of workers and staff members, to
 ensure that the managements or owners effectively
 carry out all labour protection regulations, labour in-
 surance, wage standards, factory sanitation and safety
 measures as stipulated in the laws and decrees of
 the Government and other relevant regulations and
 directives, and to take measures for improving the
 material and cultural life of the workers and staff
 members.
 As the Chinese working class is the leading class
 in the state, the interest of the country and of the
 whole people is also the vital interest of the Chinese
 working class.  The workers enjoy broad democratic
 rights; participating in the administration of state
 affairs, quite a number of workers have been elected
 deputies  to  the  National People's  Congress  and
 the various local People's Congresses, while many
 others have been elected to the People's Councils of
 all levels.  The Chinese trade unions represent the
 workers in drafting the laws and decrees concerning
 production and labour, as well as the material and
 cultural life of the workers; and they resolutely sup-
 port and carry out all the policies, laws and decrees

 which they have helped the People's Government to
 frame, functioning as a strong backbone of the people's
 democracy.
 The  present  All-China  Federation  of  Trade
 Unions-the highest leading body of the Chinese trade
 unions-was elected at the Seventh All-China Con-
 gress of Trade Unions.
 Held in 1953, the Seventh Congress elected
 an Executive Committee of 99 full members and
 42 candidate members, and an Auditing Com-
 mission of 17 members.  Liu Shao-chi was elected
 Honorary President, Lai Jo-yu was elected Pres-
 ident, and Liu Ning-I, Liu Chang-sheng and Chu
 Hsueh-fan Vice-Presidents.  The 10 members of
 the Secretariat are: Lai Jo-yu, Liu Ning-I, Hsu
 Chih-chen, Chen Shao-min, Li Chieh-po, Liu Tse-
 chiu, Li Tsai-wen, Tung Hsin, Chang Wei-chen
 and Chang Hsiu-chu.  The following departments
 have been set up within the All-China Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions: General Office, Organiza-
 tion Department, Propaganda Department, Pro-
 duction Department, Wages Department, Labour
 Insurance  Department,  Department  Concerned
 with Workers' Housing and General Living Stand-
 ards,  Labour  Protection  Department,                                          Women

 The Chinese trade unions are set up on the prin-
 ciple of industrial unionism.  Members working in the
 same enterprise are organized in the same primary
 industrial trade union.  For instance, in the Harbin
 Flax Mill, all the spinners, weavers, maintenance work-
 ers, printing and dyeing workers, technicians and staff
 members are organized in one primary trade union
 organization-the Working Committee of the Chinese
 Textile Workers' Trade Union in the Harbin Flax Mill.
 On a national level all trade union members work-
 ing in the same industrial branch of the national
 economy are organized in the same national industrial
 union.  This makes it easier for the unions to func-
 tion within the industrial framework of the country
 and so play their full part in solving the various prob-
 lems connected with production as well as those in
 relation to working conditions, living and welfare and
 education.  The national committee of each industrial
 union is elected by the national congress of the indus-
 trial union concerned.  Local trade union organizations
 are also organized along industrial lines where there
 are enough workers to make this possible.  The trade
 union councils at provincial, city, county or town level
 are formed from the various industrial unions and
 other local trade union organizations in the given prov-
 ince, city, county or town.
 At the present time, under the leadership of
 the All-China Federation of Trade Unions there
 are 3 trade union councils of municipalities
 directly subordinate to the central authority, 22
 provincial trade union councils, 2 trade union
 councils of an autonomous region, 163 city trade

 union councils and various county or town trade
 union councils, in addition to 18 industrial unions.
 Among the industrial unions there are 13 which
 have national committees, viz, Railway Workers'
 Trade Union, Electrical Workers' Trade Union,
 Posts and Telecommunications Workers' Trade
 Union,  Textile  Workers'  Trade  Union,  Coal
 Miners' Trade Union, Educational Workers' Trade
 Union, Commercial Workers' Trade Union, the
 Trade Union of Workers of the First Machinery
 Industry, the Trade Union of Workers of the
 Second  Machinery  Industry,  Road   Transport
 Workers' Trade Union, Heavy Industry Work-
 ers' Trade Union, Seamen's Trade Union and
 Petroleum Workers' Trade Union.  Three have
 preparatory committees, viz, the Building Work-
 ers' Trade Union, the Agricultural and Water
 Conservancy Workers' Trade  Union and the
 Forestry Workers' Trade Union. Two have work-
 ing committees, viz, the Light Industry Workers'
 Trade Union and the Salt Industry Workers' Trade
 Union.
 The trade union organization of China is built
 on the basis of democratic centralism in accordance
 with the Constitution of the Trade Unions of the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China.  The leading bodies of the
 trade unions at all levels are elected from the bottom
 up at the general membership meetings or at repre-
 sentative conferences, each committee electing the
 members  of that  directly above  it.  They  should
 report their  work  at regular  intervals  to   the
 membership through general membership meetings,

 representative conferences and through their own
 papers, developing criticism and self-criticism, es-
 pecially criticism from the bottom up, so that the
 work of the trade union organization is placed under
 the supervision of all the members.  All trade union
 organizations must carry out their work in accordance
 with the Constitution of the Trade Unions and the de-
 cisions of their organizations, all such decisions are
 adopted by a majority vote of the members present
 at meetings of the union organization concerned. The
 lower organizations must carry out the decisions made
 by those above them.  All sections are bound by the
 Constitution to report at regular intervals to the
 membership on their financial accounts.  The leading
 bodies of the trade unions are strongly based on their
 local organizations and the broad mass of the members.
 Over the past few years, membership of the
 Federation has increased rapidly.  In 1949 the
 total membership was more than 2,373,000; in
 1950, 5,170,000; in 1951, 7,297,000; in 1952,
 10,200,000; in 1953, 12,229,000; in 1954, 12,454,-
 000; in 1954 the trade unions of China had
 200,000  primary  organizations, with  2,730,000
 members taking an exceptionally active part in
 the work.

 BUILDING SOCIALISM
 Since the founding of the People's Republic of
 China, the country has entered upon the road of tran-
 sition to socialism.                        The Preamble of the Constitution
 of the People's Republic of China says: "From the
 founding of the People's Republic of China to the
 attainment of a socialist society is a period of transi-
 tion.  During the transition the fundamental task of
 the state is, step by step, to bring about the socialist
 industrialization of the country and, step by step,
 to accomplish the socialist transformation of agricul-
 ture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and com-
 merce."
 The First Five-Year Plan for Development of the
 National Economy of the People's Republic of China
 began from 1953.  The implementation of the Plan
 is an important part of the general task of the state
 in the transition period-to lay, in five years, the pre-
 liminary groundwork for the socialist industrializa-
 tion and socialist transformation of agriculture, handi-
 crafts, as well as the groundwork for the socialist
 transformation of private industry and commerce.
 With this as the basis, we can guarantee the building
 of a socialist society in our country after fulfilling
 another two five-year plans.

 The tasks of the trade unions of China are to
 unite and help all the workers, technical personnel
 and staff to fulfil the First Five-Year Plan ahead of
 schedule, to gradually improve the material and cul-
 tural life of the working class and all the labouring
 people and to struggle for the gradual realization of
 socialist industrialization of the country and transi-
 tion to a socialist society.
 The Chinese workers, in order to achieve a hap-
 pier and better life as quickly as possible, are showing
 an unconquerable fighting spirit, tackling all difficul-
 ties and working heroically to build up their country.
 Many examples could be given of the great efforts
 they are making: In constructing the railway line
 to Urumchi in Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Region,
 on the plains of Northwest China, the workers had to
 overcome great difficulties.  They had to build bridges
 across the rushing waters of the Yellow River, cut
 long tunnels in the rarefied atmosphere of Wushiao-
 ling Mountain, move roads and change rivers from
 their ancient courses.  But they were inspired and
 encouraged by the call of Chairman Mao and by the
 warm support given them by the people of various
 nationalities in Northwest China.  They also felt the
 necessity to exploit the resources of the frontiers of
 their motherland, to bring the rich products of the
 Northwest such as petroleum, non-ferrous metals and
 coal to other parts of the country, and to transport
 to Northwest China the large machines needed for
 industrial construction.  The workers proudly said:
 "We trample all the difficulties under our feet and
 leave time behind us in making new records. Bridges

 will appear on the rivers like the growing of bamboo
 shoots in spring and railways will stretch forward
 rapidly along the valley."  The workers constructing
 the Sikang-Tibet Highway on the plateau of South-
 west China had to climb the Chueherh Mountain which
 is 5,300 metres above sea level, enduring extreme cold
 reaching 30 degrees below zero.  They struggled
 against mountain floods and frozen rivers.  They con-
 quered rocks  and  shifting sand,                                   overcoming the
 problems of building in an earthquake region, and
 countless other obstacles.  They finally reached Lhasa,
 and completed the construction of this highway which
 created conditions favourable to the political, economic
 and cultural development of our brother nationalities
 on the Sikang and Tibet plateau.
 The workers constructing the Han River Bridge
 never stopped their work even during fierce storms.
 The divers worked in a torrent running at a rate of
 more than one metre per second, assemblers and crane
 operators worked on the pillars at a height of 30 to
 40 metres above the ground.  The construction work
 of this modern steel bridge was completed in January
 1955, having taken a little over a year.
 The Chinese workers have already brought about
 a high tide of socialist construction.  In the factories
 and mines all over the country, socialist- emulation
 drives have been initiated by the workers under the
 leadership of the trade unions.  In formulating the
 production plan the experience and enthusiasm of all
 the workers is drawn upon.  In the different enter-
 prises the production targets are not something which
 has been arbitrarily set by the management, but deci-

 sions have been reached after full discussions by the
 management, workers and all those concerned. These
 discussions, which involve all the workers in the enter-
 prise and are initiated by the trade union committee,
 decide the amount of production that can be achieved.
 In this way every worker regards the fulfilment of
 the state production plan as his own affair, and is
 particularly concerned that his workmates and him-
 self do their part well.  Men and women workers con-
 stantly put forward rationalization proposals, popu-
 larize advanced experiences, improve their skill, and
 study and master new Soviet technique, with a view
 to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of time.
 Wang Chung-lun, a planer in the tool workshop
 at the Anshan General Machine-Building Plant, made
 a new "universal fixture" which enabled him to com-
 plete the work of four years and forty-seven days in
 1953. The other workers in the workshop also com-
 pleted the work of two years and seventeen days in
 that year.
 Although in 1954 the task assigned to Wang
 Chung-lun was much heavier than in the previous year,
 at the end of the year he overfulfilled his quota by
 90 per cent.  The other workers in the workshop, on
 their part, also finished their assignments one month
 ahead of schedule.  Wang Chung-lun explains: "We
 are exerting all our efforts to fulfil the tasks assigned
 to us by the Government, so that we may quickly turn
 our country into a happy, prosperous and powerful
 socialist state."  Many other examples from every
 branch of industry in every part of the country could

 be cited to show how the Chinese workers are over-
 coming difficulties to build a better life.
 While the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel
 Company were discussing their production plan for
 1956, the steel makers of No. 8 open-hearth furnace
 worked carefully over the time needed for a heat of
 steel and found that they could shorten it by 30 min-
 utes.                                     By further cutting down the time for over-
 hauling the furnace and the time for loading the fur-
 nace bottom, they were able to produce 16,700 tons
 more steel for the state.  Workers of other furnaces,
 following the lead, set new targets for overfulfilling
 their production plan.  It is estimated that the whole
 plant will be able to complete its five-year plan in
 four years and produce much more steel for the
 country.
 In the Dairen Industrial Vehicle Plant, members
 of the Sun Yung-tsai Team of the forging shop have
 already started their 1958 plan in early February
 1956.  By putting into practice 37 major rationaliza-
 tion proposals in three years, they have increased
 productivity one and a half times.  Chuang Ming-
 keng, a turner of the Chishuyen Railway Repair Works,
 has completed his five-year quota in two years and
 eight months.  Recently, he pledged himself to finish
 seven years' quotas in four years. Motor-car driver
 Ho Chang-hsien of the Hupeh Provincial Transport
 Bureau has embarked on his September 1957 plan in
 January 1956.  He said to his fellow-workers with
 full confidence that after three more months he would
 be able to start his second five-year plan.  Young
 lathe-turner Wang Hsin-nien  of  the   state-owned

 Shihchiachuang Freight Car Repair Works completed
 his production quota of the First Five-Year Plan on
 December 16, 1955, which meant two years and fifteen
 days  ahead  of  schedule.  Thus  he  had machined
 20,032 extra steel wheels enough to equip 2,500 freight
 cars for the state with standard quality and no rejects.
 Tsao Yung-kang, a planer in the machine shop of
 the Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Works, started
 his production quota of August 1958 on November 15,
 1955.  In less than three years starting from 1953, he
 has already done the work equivalent to six years
 eight months and fifteen days without making any
 waste  or hitches  in production.  The  outstanding
 young fitter, Sun Chuan-fu, of the rotating electric
 machine shop of the state-owned Shanghai Electric
 Machinery Works has completed the work of fifty-six
 months and three days in thirty-four and one-half
 months.  By November 18, 1955, he started to do the
 work planned for September 1957.  In less than three
 years, from January 1953 to November 1955, he pro-
 duced over 40,000 spare parts which met all the re-
 quirements; since liberation, he has improved both his
 tools and method of operation twenty times.  Now
 he has pledged himself to fulfil his first five-year plan
 in three years and two months without any rejects.
 Sheng Li, a well-known lathe-turner and model
 worker of Shanghai, completed his five-year quota
 in the Shanghai Machine Tool Works in three years'
 time.  He is now proceeding with his second five-year
 plan.  In the past two years, he improved thirty-nine
 kinds of tools as well as methods of work, thus raising
 his labour productivity by one to five times.  Chang

 Ah-hsi, a young foundry worker of the Shanghai 1-Isin-
 chung Generators Plant (a joint state-private enter-
 prise), completed his five-year plan in two years and
 ten months, and has pledged himself to finish eight
 years' work during the First Five-Year Plan period.
 These advanced workers have, with their heroic
 labour, set excellent examples for the workers of the
 whole country to follow.  To learn from the advanced
 ones has now become an urgent and common wish
 among the broad sections of workers and employees.
 The socialist emulation campaign is spreading far and
 wide throughout the country as never before.  All
 the evidence shows that we have full confidence in
 fulfilling our First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
 In 1950 there were 683,000 workers in China
 taking part in socialist emulation drives, in 1951
 the number went up to 2,380,000, and now socialist
 emulation is developing in every enterprise.
 From 1950 to 1953 the workers put forward
 1,643,708  rationalization  proposals,  of  which
 781,956 have been put into practice.  In 1954,
 848,000 were made, of which 463,000 were put into
 practice.
 The Constitution of the People's Republic of China
 provides: "Work is a matter of honour for every citi-
 zen of the People's Republic of China who is able to
 work.  The state encourages citizens to take an active
 and creative part in their work."  Over the past few
 years, the socialist emulation drives launched in all
 industrial departments have brought a great number
 of advanced workers to the fore.   Large numbers of
 ordinary men and women workers, because of their

 remarkable contributions in the development of our
 industry, have been elected model workers and are
 highly respected by all the working people.
 In August 1954, the Central People's Govern-
 ment promulgated a provisional regulation regard-
 ing  rewards  for  inventions,  innovations  and
 rationalization  proposals  on production. This
 regulation has greatly encouraged the creative
 enthusiasm of the broad mass of workers and
 employees, helping them to use fully their work-
 ing experiences and knowledge for making inven-
 tions, innovations and rationalization proposals.
 During that year 135,600 workers were rewarded
 for their proposals.  This measure has been of
 great help in overcoming the difficulties in the
 socialist industrialization of the country, in suc-
 cessfully fulfilling the national plans and in speed-
 ing up the development of the national economy.
 In 1954, there were 153,900 workers in the
 whole country who were elected model workers,
 and 220,400 who were elected advanced workers.
 We are building a socialist economy in our coun-
 try because, in the last analysis, we want to secure
 the maximum satisfaction of the constantly rising
 material and cultural requirements of the whole
 society.  To achieve that end, it is necessary to devel-
 op constantly the social productive forces, raise labour
 productivity and secure the continuous expansion and
 perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher
 techniques.  In order to expand our socialist con-
 struction on a large scale, quickly, effectively and eco-
 nomically, it is essential that we rely on the close

 co-operation between manual and mental workers, on
 the fraternal alliance of workers, peasants and intel-
 lectuals.
 Since liberation, the social and political status of
 intellectuals has undergone a fundamental change, and
 the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Gov-
 ernment have shown great respect for them.  Large
 numbers of new-type intellectuals who are akin to the
 workers have grown up.  Old technicians have made
 progress and are gradually developing a new outlook.
 Many old engineers have become intimate friends and
 helpful teachers of the workers.  Working closely
 together with workers, many technicians have put
 forth hundreds of thousands of valuable proposals.
 Experts, professors, engineers and many other
 scientific and technical personnel throughout the coun-
 try regularly give workers systematic lectures on basic
 scientific and technical knowledge, such as lectures
 on physics, chemistry, machine-building and electrical
 engineering.
 Professor Chao Hsueh-tien has worked out the
 "quick method of blueprint reading for mechanics."
 Trained with this method, a skilled worker of a lower
 grade, after attending ten hours' lectures and going
 through ten hours' practice, will be able to read ordi-
 nary blueprints of parts of a machinery, to read simple
 blueprints for assembling and to put together blue-
 prints of a work object and work accordingly. Many
 workers have recently requested Professor Chao to
 prepare another book on "Quick Method of Engineer-
 ing Drawing."  In response to this, Professor Chao
 has made a plan to complete this new book by June

 1956.  His new book will help workers to learn en-
 gineering drawing quickly and to enable them to mani-
 fest in concrete forms their enthusiasm in creation
 and inventions and in making rationalization pro-
 posals.
 In the last six years, scientists and technicians
 carried out tremendous work and achieved successes
 in the fields of geological survey and prospecting, de-
 signing and engineering of capital construction and
 trial manufacture of new products.
 As a result of learning industriously from Soviet
 experience, Chinese engineers and technicians are now
 able to design and construct many kinds of modern
 factories, mine pits, bridges, water conservancy proj-
 ects; and their ability to design big machines, loco-
 motives and ships has also greatly improved.  From
 1952 to 1955, about 3,500 new products were manu-
 factured, some of them are as good as those made in
 the most industrialized countries of the world.
 China is a people's democratic state led by the
 working class and based on the worker-peasant alli-
 ance which is the basic force of building socialism.
 The rapid development of industrial construction has
 hastened the upsurge of the socialist transformation
 of agriculture; and the emergence of the high tide
 of agricultural co-operation in return created condi-
 tions for industrial expansion, thus speeding up the
 tempo of socialist industrial construction.
 -To support the movement for agricultural co-
 operation, workers and staff members of farm imple-
 ment factories throughout the country have launched
 an inter-factory emulation.  Through this emulation

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 to help increase agricultural production, they are striv-
 ing to improve the quality of products, to reduce pro-
 duction costs, to increase the types of new products
 and to turn out, in good time and in greater num-
 bers, cheaper and better new farm implements. Work-
 ers and staff members of all enterprises engaged in
 producing  or  supplying means  of production  and
 consumer goods are making great efforts to bring
 the potentialities of their enterprises into full play,
 so as to satisfy the constantly rising material and
 cultural needs of the peasants.
 The trade unions of China consistently educate
 the workers and staff with the importance of worker-
 peasant alliance.  The broad mass of workers and
 staff have strengthened their ties with the peasants
 through various means and ways.  These include joint
 friendly gatherings, exchange of visits, presentation
 of books and pictorials to peasants, help rendered to set
 up libraries and clubs, teaching peasants to use and
 repair new farm implements, teaching members of
 agricultural producers' co-operatives to keep accounts,
 sending film projection teams and amateur artiste
 groups to help peasants develop their cultural and
 recreational  activities,  encouraging  relatives  and
 friends in the villages to take the lead in joining agri-
 cultural producers' co-operatives, to offer quality seeds
 to  the  co-operatives  and  to  invest their  savings
 in the co-operatives as production funds. All these
 activities have not only promoted mutual understand-
 ing between workers and peasants, but, of more impor-
 tance, have enabled the workers to render assistance
 to peasants in technical and cultural matters.  It is

 through these activities that the workers educate the
 peasants in communism.  The broad mass of workers
 and staff are setting an example for the peasants, in-
 spiring them to raise their labour enthusiasm and
 rallying them to work together in building socialism
 in our country.
 At the beginning of 1954, trade union or-
 ganizations at provincial and municipal levels
 organized workers' delegations from mines and
 big factories to visit the peasants, invited the
 peasants to visit the factories and hold worker-
 peasant social gatherings and discussions. Accord-
 ing to statistics made in 3 municipalities directly
 under the central authority,  10 municipalities
 under the provincial authority, 4 provinces and the
 Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, 436 workers'
 delegations with 38,549 delegates have been or-
 ganized; and there have been about 1,440,000 oc-
 casions on which groups of workers and peasants
 visited one another and held parties and discus-
 sions.  Through this, the unity between the work-
 ing class and the peasantry is further strengthen-
 ed.
 The rapid development of China's peaceful con-
 struction is inseparable from the disinterested assist-
 ance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies,
 which have not only sent us the best technical equip-
 ment and many experts to offer us practical help,
 but have also trained a considerable number of Chinese
 engineering technicians, workers and cadres in the
 process of construction.  This kind of economic and
 technical assistance, which is comprehensive, disin-

 terested and systematic, has no comparison in the
 history of mankind. Chou Chuan-tien, deputy-director
 of the iron works of the Anshan Iron and Steel
 Company, puts it this way:  "The experience of
 the Soviet Union in the building of socialism has
 enriched our knowledge and improved our ability in
 iron-smelting, something which those engaged in this
 field in old China could not possess even in a matter
 of several decades."  The three major projects of the
 Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the new-type heavy
 rolling mill, seamless tubing mill and No. 7 blast fur-
 nace which were launched in 1953, were built with
 Soviet help; from designing, building, and installing
 the machinery to the trial runs and then finally pro-
 duction, everything was done with their assistance.
 With the completion of these projects, the Anshan
 Iron and Steel Company will gradually develop and
 expand; heavy structural steel, heavy rails and seam-
 less tubing which we could not produce before can
 now be produced in great quantities to supply the
 country's need.  From now on, we will have steel rails
 for our railways, seamless tubing for geological drill-
 ings, steam pipes for power plants and structural steel
 for huge factory buildings.  The disinterested ass-st-
 ance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democra-
 cies has made this possible by adding new strength
 to our industry, giving impetus to the development
 of our national economy and bringing immeasurable
 benefits to the people.
 In the field of the iron and steel industry, steel
 workers, having learned the advanced experience of
 the Soviet Union in the control of material, in regular

 change of charging frequency, in steam blowing and
 high temperature air blasting, have increased the rate
 of utility of the blast furnace.  For the first eight
 months of 1955, the average rate of space required
 in blast furnaces throughout the country for each
 ton of iron smelted was reduced by 4.7 per cent in
 comparison with 1954.  In 1955, steel makers popu-
 larized extensively such advanced experience of the
 Soviet Union as loading the furnace bottom with thick
 layers of agglomerate, quick repairing of cold furnaces
 and high-speed smelting.  After having applied the
 Soviet experience of loading the furnace bottom with
 thick agglomerate, all the open-hearth furnaces under
 the administration of the Iron and Steel Industrial
 Bureau have increased output and shortened the time
 for repairing hot furnaces; in the first five months
 of 1955 alone, more than 4,900 extra tons of steel were
 made in these furnaces.
 During October 1955, steel workers of Anshan,
 Chungking, Shanghai, Taiyuan and other cities em-
 barked on an enthusiastic drive of learning the
 advanced method of steel making of the outstanding
 Soviet steel worker G. V. Kolesnikov.  The steel
 makers of the open-hearth furnaces of the Anshan
 Iron and Steel Company were especially keen in this
 campaign.  The steel workers of No. 1 open-hearth
 furnace tried out the new method right after the
 day of Kolesnikov's demonstration.  The result was
 two hours and ten minutes less than the standard
 time required for the ordinary quick method of steel
 making.

 In iron-ore mining, the workers have also learned
 the new Soviet method of drilling with hard alloy
 tubes, the wet drilling method and the straight-line
 explosion method which have resulted in higher exca-
 vation rates.
 The engineering workers, in 1955, continued to
 apply the high-speed cutting method of the Soviet
 Union, the Vasili-Kolesov and Ulanov lathe-operating
 methods, the multi-cutter and multi-edge cutting
 method, the Shirov high-speed boring method, the
 omni-planing method, as well as cutting with pro-
 cessed electric spark, etc.  Workers of the Shanghai
 Machine Tool Works, having mastered the high-speed
 cutting method, have increased their work efficiency
 by 100 per cent.
 In 1955, over 90 per cent of the state-owned col-
 lieries adopted the advanced Soviet method of excava-
 tion.  By using such method of cutting coal, the rate
 of yielding in the state collieries reached above 80
 per cent while the old method used to yield only
 30-40 per cent of coal.
 The electrical workers, learning from the Soviet
 method of using inferior quality coal and adjusting
 the load of generators, saved a considerable amount
 of electricity.  In 1955, as a result of load adjust-
 ments, about 300 million kilowatt-hours were saved
 for the state which were enough to supply an indus-
 trial city with two million population.
 In carrying out the great task of building social-
 ism, the Chinese people have received the magnani-
 mous and disinterested help of the Soviet Union. The
 Chinese people fully realize that assistance from the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 Soviet Union is an important factor in developing their
 national economy and in turning China from a back-
 ward agricultural country into an advanced industrial
 one.  The all-round and large-scale assistance rendered
 by the Soviet Union has enabled us, within a few years
 after liberation, to rapidly rehabilitate our economy
 and, on this basis, to launch the construction of our
 national economy in a planned way.  The 156 major
 projects which the Soviet Union is helping us to con-
 struct form the important groundwork for realizing
 our First Five-Year Plan in building socialism. By the
 end of 1955, twenty-nine of these projects were com-
 pleted and started operation.  They are now working
 day and night for the socialist construction of our
 country and accumulating wealth for the Chinese
 people.
 Over the last few years, the Soviet Union has
 sent a large number of outstanding experts to China
 to help us solve various technical problems in the
 socialist  construction.  They  have  been  working
 arduously, setting an example to their Chinese work-
 mates and have helped train large groups of cadres
 for China.  The Chinese people fully realize that the
 rapid development of their national economy and the
 gigantic achievements of their socialist construction
 are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet
 Union. The Chinese people will never forget the great,
 selfless and fraternal friendship of the Soviet Union
 which is based on the spirit of internationalism.  The
 Chinese people, in building socialism, have to learn
 more industriously from the Soviet Union, to integrate
 the advanced Soviet experience with the practice of

 China's socialist construction, this to further the cause
 of socialism in China.
 Special mention should be made here of the
 sincere and disinterested assistance given to China by
 the Soviet Union in the field of utilizing atomic energy
 for peaceful purposes.  The Soviet Union has made
 a plan to build for China an experimental atomic pile
 with a capacity of 6,500 kilowatts and to help in the
 training of scientists and technical staff on the peace-
 ful utilization of atomic energy.
 At the end of 1955, the Soviet Union specially
 sent a delegation of prominent scientists to China to
 give further help in the development of atomic energy
 for peaceful purposes.  While here, the delegation
 made a report on the Geneva Conference for the peace-
 ful development of atomic energy to Chinese scien-
 tists.  With the help of the Soviet Union, China will
 soon be able to master the most advanced technique
 of exploiting atomic energy.  Undoubtedly, this is
 extremely important to the cause of socialist construc-
 tion in China.
 While marching towards socialism, the Chinese
 trade unions are confidently leading the working class
 to build a happy life for themselves.  The trade
 unions rally millions of men and women workers in
 their ranks, and mobilize the great strength of the
 working class to realize the national construction
 plans.  Our, efforts are fully manifested in the mag-
 nificent achievements obtained in the development of
 our national economy.
 The scale of our socialist industrialization can
 be seen from the increase in the investments on

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 capital construction.  In 1953 total investments on
 capital construction exceeded those in 1952 by
 96 per cent, while in 1954 budgetary investments
 for this purpose again exceeded those in 1953 by
 28 per cent.  Up to 1955, 271 above-norm indus-
 trial construction projects had been put into opera-
 tion.                                       The total value of modern industrial pro-
 duction in 1954 was 4.2 times that of 1949.  The
 following important industrial products can be
 taken as an example:  Taking the output in 1949
 as 100, 1954 output of electricity was 250, coal
 260, pig iron 1,240, steel 1,370, metal-cutting
 lathes 850, cement 720, cotton yarn 260, and ma-
 chine-manufactured paper 450.
 The percentage of production by  modern
 industry in the combined total value of commodi-
 ties increased from 17 per cent in 1949 to 33.7
 per cent in 1955.  The proportion of capital pro-
 duction in the total value of industrial produc-
 tion rose from 28.8 per cent in 1949 to 45 per cent
 in 1955.  There was also an increase in the pro-
 portion of industrial output by state-owned, co-
 operative                                                 and joint state-private enterprises in
 the total value of industrial production, from 37
 per cent in 1949 to about 81 per cent in 1955.
 These figures indicate the rate at which China is
 advancing towards industrialization and socialism.
 Provisions in the Constitution of the People's Re-
 public of China concerning the gradual realization of
 socialist industrialization are not just empty talk, but
 living facts which we are bringing about by our ac-
 tivities.                                       Under the leadership of the Chinese Com-

 HIGHER WAGES AND BETTER
 LIVING CONDITIONS
 In our country where the working class holds the
 state power, the fundamental aim of developing the
 national economy and expanding socialist production
 is to gradually improve the material and cultural life
 of the people.  Over the past six years, along with the
 development of the national economy, a series of meas-
 ures have been adopted for improving the living con-
 ditions and welfare of the workers and staff.  The
 material and cultural life of the Chinese working class
 has been greatly improved.
 In the spring of 1950, the People's Government
 balanced the financial budget and stabilized the prices
 of commodities, so ending the inflation which had
 existed for more than ten years under the reactionary
 rule of the Kuomintang, and guaranteeing real earn-
 ings.  On March 1, 1955 on the basis of balanced
 budget and the stabilization of finance and commodity
 prices, the Government issued a new currency which
 has further strengthened the currency system.  It is
 also a very important measure in helping forward the
 socialist construction of our country and the gradual
 raising of the living standards of our people.
 As the economic conditions of the country im-
 proved so the wage system was gradually reformed

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 in a planned and systematic way, thereby raising the
 level of real wages.  The trade unions take part in all
 decisions on wages.   Representatives of the All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions take part in discussions
 with Government representatives in the formulation
 of the national wage plan, and the Government always
 consult with the trade unions in the promulgation of
 wage decrees.  It is the duty of the trade unions to see
 that all these decrees are carried out in the different
 enterprises, and also to obtain the opinions of the
 workers for improving the wage system.  The actual
 wages to be received by the individual workers, within
 the framework of the national wages policy, and the
 wages plan for the industry, are only fixed after full
 discussions between the trade unions and the manage-
 ment of the enterprises.  In very many cases wages
 are paid on a graded system, with up to eight grades,
 each with different levels of wages, according to the
 skill or value of work performed.  In these cases the
 trade union representatives not only take part in the
 discussions to decide the amount of wages to be paid
 to each grade, and the differentials between them, but
 also the various categories of workers who will occupy
 the different grades.  They also make recommenda-
 tions and take part in discussions for promoting work-
 ers to a higher grade;                                     In the case of jobs which are
 paid under the piece-work system, the wages to be
 paid are also decided through discussions between the
 trade unions and management.
 The payment of wages in the state-owned enter-
 prises is in accordance with the socialist principle "to
 each according to his work." Workers doing the same

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 work receive the same pay, irrespective of nationality,
 sex or age, thus the principle of equal pay for equal
 work has been fulfilled.  It is this principle of pay-
 ment according to work which links the interests of
 the individual worker with the interests of the coun-
 try.  The enthusiasm and creative ability of the
 workers and staff have thus helped to further de-
 velop production and raise the living standard of
 the people.
 In the past six years, due to the continual rise of
 wages, the broad mass of workers have done away
 with poverty and misery from which they suffered
 before liberation, and are now living a happy life. Let
 us take the case of twelve families whose men mem-
 bers have worked in the iron-smelting section of the
 Shihchingshan Iron and Steel Factory for many years.
 After liberation, from 1952 to 1954, they bought 12
 bicycles, 12 wrist-watches, 5 radios, 1 sewing-machine,
 58 cotton quilts and mattresses, 3 blankets, 44 leather,
 fur or woollen suits, 395 articles of cotton clothing,
 159 articles of padded clothing, 24 pairs of leather
 shoes, and they have deposited 1,022 yuan in the bank.
 Before liberation only one family had an old bicycle
 which was used by three brothers, and none of them
 had ever had a wrist-watch or radio.
 In 1952, the average wage of the workers and
 staff in the state-owned enterprises increased by
 60 per cent to 120 per cent as compared with 1949,
 and general wages had reached or surpassed the
 level  existing  before  the  anti-Japanese  war
 period.  In 1955, the annual average real wage of
 the workers and staff of the state-owned enter-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 prises increased by 20.5 per cent as compared with
 that of 1952.
 In our country, the real earnings of the workers
 and staff not only take the form of money wages, but
 also include various kinds of welfare benefits which
 are provided for by the state for the promotion of
 the material and cultural life of the working people,
 such as labour insurance, the building of houses with
 low rents for workers and staff, the provision of cul-
 tural and educational facilities.  Appropriations by the
 state for this purpose are also increasing every year.
 It is a main factor in the improvement of the material
 and cultural conditions of the working people.
 The continual increase in the incomes of the broad
 mass of the workers and staff is directly reflected by
 the continual increase in their purchasing power.
 The social purchasing power in 1951 increas-
 ed by 22 per cent as compared with 1950; in 1952,
 it increased about another 25 per cent and in 1953
 by a further 20 per cent.  In 1954, it showed an
 increase of 13.8 per cent over 1953.
 Many workers deposit money every month in the
 bank. This was something unheard of in the old China,
 and is a concrete proof of the improvement in the
 lives of the Chinese workers.
 In the following five factories: the Wuhan
 State No. 1 Textile Factory, Hankow No. 1 Tex-
 tile Company, Yu Hua Textile Company, Chen
 Huan Textile Company and Shen Hsin Textile
 Factory, one out of every three workers on an
 average has money deposited in the batik.  At the

 end of 1953, in the Wuhan branch bank of the
 People's Bank of China there was an increase of
 70,000 current and deposit accounts over the first
 quarter of 1953, and of these 50,000 were from the
 working people.

 DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNAL
 LABOUR INSURANCE
 ESTABLISHMENTS
 Article 93 of the Constitution of the People's
 Republic of China provides: "Working people in the
 People's Republic of China have the right to material
 assistance in old age, and in case of illness or disabil-
 ity."                           The rapid development of labour insurance is
 an important measure taken by the state to ensure
 the enjoyment of this right by the workers.
 Northeast China was the first to be liberated.
 There the wartime provisional labour insurance regu-
 lations in the state-owned. enterprises were promul-
 gated in December 1948.  After the liberation of the
 whole country, the Labour Insurance Regulations of
 the People's Republic of China were promulgated in
 February 1951.  The labour insurance benefits were
 applied according to the Regulations to the railways,
 water transport, posts and telecommunications and
 factories and mines employing more than 100 workers
 and staff members.  While in the enterprises employ-
 ing less than 100, collective contracts were made to
 solve problems connected with labour insurance.  In
 January 1953, the Government Administration Coun-
 cil adopted Amendments to the Labour Insurance

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 Regulations which extended the scope of application
 and increased the benefits in some provisions.
 The salient feature of China's labour insurance is
 that the managements or owners of enterprises pay
 to the labour insurance fund a sum equal to 3 per cent
 of the total pay-roll of all workers and staff members
 in the enterprises concerned, but the workers do not
 pay anything to this fund.  The fund is managed by
 the trade union.
 The number of persons covered by labour
 insurance in 1949 was 600,000; in 1950, 1,400,000;
 in 1951, 2,600,000; in 1952, 3,300,000; in 1953,
 4,830,000; in 1954, 5,380,000; and by the end of
 June 1955, 5,500,000; these figures do not include
 those who were covered by the labour insurance
 collective contracts in the small and medium-size
 enterprises.
 The labour insurance fund, which is 3 per
 cent of the total pay-roll, and the cost of medical
 treatment and other expenses directly paid by the
 enterprises, are altogether equal to more than 10
 per cent of the total pay-roll of the enterprises
 concerned.
 Before liberation, the workers led a miserable life,
 hardly able to afford any medical treatment in time
 of need. Now the trade unions work through the
 labour insurance organizations for prevention of sick-
 ness and injury, and provide treatment to help the
 sick workers recover their health.  Sanatoria and rest
 homes established in many parts of the country accom-
 modated more than 1,130,000 workers between 1951
 and 1954.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 These sanatoria  situate in  some  of China's
 most famous beauty spots, such as the West Lake,
 Taihu Lake, the Summer Palace in Peking, Lushan,
 Peitaiho, Chinwangtao and Tsingtao.    Workers en-
 joy a happy time during treatment.                                       For example,
 on the western outskirt of Peking, there is a sana-
 torium belonging to the Posts and Telecommunica-
 tions Trade Union.  There are usually 70 to 80 postal
 workers there, coming from various places in North
 China for treatment. The patients themselves form
 a "Patients' Committee."  In the morning, some of
 them play games, some take a walk along the stream
 or in the woods, and others just rest in cane-chairs in
 the garden.  A time for study is arranged in the
 morning.  There is a library with pictorials, novels,
 journals and newspapers.   A pair of earphones is
 placed beside each bed so that the patients can listen
 to music, operas and songs on the radio.  Afternoon
 is the time for treatment.  The most happy time is
 in the evening when there are often film shows or other
 recreational activities.
 The workers' branch of the Tangkangtse Sanato-
 rium in Northeast China has workers and staff mem-
 bers coming from Shenyang, Anshan, Dairen and other
 places.  Among them was a worker from the seri-
 culture factory in Haicheng who wrote his impres-
 sions:                                        "When I was thirteen, I began to work in a
 privately-owned factory.  Once I was sick and the
 employer told me, 'This is neither a hotel nor a hos-
 pital, if you cannot work, you can go.'  I was then
 dismissed. Now under the leadership of the Commu-
 nist Party, we have become the masters of the country,

 not only is there no unemployment, but when we are
 sick, the Government sends us to a sanatorium. Stay-
 ing in this magnificent establishment, and comparing
 it with my previous experience, I really feel that I am
 in heaven."
 There were only 4 workers' sanatoria (includ-
 ing hydropathic sanatoria, tuberculosis sanatoria
 and rest homes) in 1949 with 655 beds; in 1950,
 this had gone up to 11 with 2,036 beds; in 1951,
 27 with 3,649 beds; in 1952, 67 with 7,899 beds;
 in 1953, 108 with 11,707 beds; in 1954, 126 with
 more than 13,490 beds, and in the first half of
 1955, there were 129 with more than 15,930
 beds.  In 1954 there were more than 70 overnight
 sanatoria with more than 5,000 beds.
 There was only one overnight sanatorium at-
 tached to factories and mines in 1949; the number
 rose to 17 in 1950, and to 136 in 1951, 383 in
 1952, 1,267 in 1953 and 1,488 in 1954; and at the
 end of September of 1955, there were 1,562 with
 38,998 beds.
 The workers are no longer afraid of being with-
 out any subsistence in their old age.  The retired
 workers, if they have their own homes, can of course
 live with their families; if they have no homes, they
 may go to a home for old people.  For example, in
 Fushun Mining Administration, from July to October
 1954, there were 140 old workers who went to these
 homes.  On the day they retired, the various units
 in the Administration held farewell meetings for them
 and congratulated them, and wished them happiness
 in their old age.  These retired workers get insurance

 benefits equal to 50 to 70 per cent of their original
 wages.  Those who go to the old people's homes can
 enjoy a tranquil and comfortable life in, the company
 of'other old people.  They spend their time in taking
 walks, fishing, strolling in the garden, playing chess,
 or in other amusements just as they please.  There
 are people to attend to their food, clothes and rooms.
 Hsia Mao-lin, an old transport worker, said: "I have
 never dreamt of being so happy in my old age, living
 in such a lovely home !"  Some of the old workers
 want to pass the rest of their lives in their native place,
 such as Li Tang of the Victory Mine who had worked
 in the mine for 39 years, and suffered very much
 in the old society.  After liberation, he worked with
 great enthusiasm and was given the honourable title
 of model worker.     After he retired, he went back
 to Haokechuang Village, Laiyang County, Shantung
 Province to spend his old age.  He said with hap-
 piness:  "Now I am going back to live happily with
 my whole family."
 If those who are qualified to retire want to con-
 tinue working in the factory or mine, they receive,
 in addition to their normal wages, a portion of their
 old-age pensions every month from the labour insur-
 ance fund.
 Many old workers, enjoying the happiness the
 new society brings to them, have raised their class
 consciousness and have shown their initiative in pro-
 duction.  Chang Chia-fa, an old worker in the locomo-
 tive section of Chungking No. 101 Iron and Steel
 Works, recalled his miserable life in the old days with
 emotion: "In the past, it was unemployment and

 hunger that I most worried about.  But now, the Com-
 munist Party and Government look after us with such
 care, carry out the labour insurance and give me old-
 age pension whilst staying on work.  I must repay
 the concern bestowed on me by action." He has suc-
 ceeded, within the short period of over two months'
 strenuous tutorship, in teaching Li En-kuei and six
 other apprentices to drive locomotives by themselves.
 During the Campaign of Resistance to American Ag-
 gression and Aid to Korea, he responded to the call of
 the state to increase production and practise economy
 by organizing the workers to repair a locomotive with
 waste materials.
 The number of homes for the old and the dis-
 abled and orphanages in 1950 was 7, with 615
 beds; in 1951, 14, with 1,298 beds; in 1952, 18,
 with 1,673 beds; in 1953, 20, with 1,839 beds;
 and in 1954, 21, with 1,656 beds.
 The number of workers who enjoyed retire-
 ment pensions was 69 in 1949; 156 in 1950; 6,300
 in 1951; 12,049 in 1952; and 21,237 in 1953.
 The number of workers who are qualified to
 retire but continue to work and receive old-age
 pensions was 762 in 1949; 1,715 in 1950; 4,603 in
 1951; 6,503 in 1952 and 11,698 in 1953.
 In 1954, the number of workers receiving
 retirement pensions and those who are qualified to
 retire but continue to work and receive old-age
 pensions totalled 34,900.
 Various kinds of collective welfare are rapidly
 developing.  In old China, workers were beset with dif-
 ficult problems during periods of birth, old age, sick-

 ness, death, injuries, etc., but now many of these prob-
 lems are solved for them.  Those model workers who
 have made special contributions in their work can
 enjoy good benefits according to the labour insurance
 regulations.  In carrying out work of labour insurance,
 attention is constantly being paid to the prevention of
 sickness and accidents, so that it plays a great role
 in improving the workers' health and living conditions.

 GRADUAL EMANCIPATION FROM
 HEAVY MANUAL LABOUR
 Chairman Mao has constantly taught us that
 while we should increase our labour productivity, we
 should also improve the working conditions and the
 material and cultural standards of the workers and
 staff members.  The protection of the health and safe-
 ty of the working people is one of the overriding prin-
 ciples in conducting our socialist enterprises.
 General inspections of factory hygiene and safety
 measures have been carried out throughout the coun-
 try on several occasions since liberation.  The trade
 union organizations have encouraged the workers to
 put forward suggestions on what improvements should
 be made and how to, bring about such improvements.
 Such mass campaigns have played an important role.
 The workers have increased their understanding and
 knowledge of safety and hygiene through these cam-
 paigns and laid down various rules.
 Over the past few years, efforts have not only
 been made to raise productivity, but also to lighten
 the labour intensity of workers as well as to improve
 working conditions and to wipe out sickness and in-
 juries sustained at work.
 The trade union organizations are responsible for
 supervising the way in which the administration of

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 state-owned enterprises and joint state-private enter-
 prises has carried out the existing labour regulations.
 As far as working hours are concerned, the state-owned
 enterprises and joint state-private enterprises put
 into practice the eight-hour day.  In those depart-
 ments of the chemical industry in which the work is
 detrimental to health, the workers only work six hours
 a day.  Workers who are engaged in work detri-
 mental to health are paid an extra allowance and
 supplied with nutritious food.    The administration
 of factories and mines should see to it that dietetic
 canteens and clinics are set up, and that the workers
 are regularly supplied with fresh nutritious food to
 preserve their health or combat poisons.  It is stip-
 ulated by law that women and juvenile workers should
 be given special treatment and that they should receive
 equal pay for equal work.  Women workers have
 special treatment and benefits before and after con-
 finement and  during the period of nursing.  The
 state-owned factories and mines no longer employ
 child labour and they have adopted special measures
 for the benefit of the young workers previously em-
 ployed, such as lightening their work or reducing their
 working day in order to enable them to have enough
 time to study and to take part in various cultural ac-
 tivities.  Some of them now have been sent to schools
 to study.
 In 1954, the Ministry of Labour issued a regula-
 tion stipulating that all industrial enterprises of the
 country must work out a plan for labour protection and
 the provision of safety devices, when they decide on
 their financial plan for the year.  The trade union or-

 ganization in the enterprise will supervise and ensure
 the carrying out of decisions of the plan and the labour
 protection agreement which it has concluded with the
 management of the enterprise, so improving the work-
 ing conditions.
 For the purpose of improving working condi-
 tions, the state has paid out large sums for labour
 protection.  If we take the expenditure on labour
 protection by the Ministry of Railways as 100
 in 1950, then it was 409.2 in 1951, 628 in 1952,
 1,291.1 in 1953 and 1,211.3 in 1954.
 In the coal-mining industry, the national in-
 vestment on health equipment in 1954 was 48.3
 per cent greater than in 1953.
 In water conservancy departments, if we take
 the expenditure on labour protection in 1953 as
 100, then it was 267 in 1954 and 3,988 in 1955.
 It was impossible to do this during the time of
 the Kuomintang reactionary rule, since the employers
 were concerned not about a better life for the people,
 but about how to squeeze more profits out of them.
 The workers had to work 10 hours or even 14 to 15
 hours a day, all the year round without any holidays,
 under appalling conditions. The lot of the women and
 juvenile workers was still more miserable, and the
 rate of injuries, deaths, disability and occupational
 diseases was appallingly high.  For instance, there was
 a common saying among the coal-miners in the past
 that "every third stone is covered with blood," as
 no attempts were made to provide for their safety
 at all.  Many accidents occurred, such as the explo-

 sion in the Penki Mine in 1945 which caused 1,100
 deaths.  No attention was ever paid to the health
 of the miners, there was not only no boiled water
 in the pit for them to drink, but also no clean water,
 and the workers had to drink dirty water, which
 caused many of the workers to suffer from diarrhoea.
 There was not only no one to take care of the sufferers,
 but the feudal gangsters would drive them with clubs
 to work in the mine, so long as they were able to
 breathe.  Another example is provided by the light
 rolling mill of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company.
 Under the reactionary regime workers had to do heavy
 manual work in high temperature. After working for
 a year or two, a strong healthy worker would become
 very weak, so there was a common saying among the
 workers that "to work in the light rolling mill is to
 work in hell, where one has to stake his life for his
 bread."
 Now the conditions are entirely different.  Ma-
 chines have taken the place of heavy physical labour
 in many industries.  For instance, in the coal-mining
 industry throughout the country, more than 45 per
 cent of the coal mined are excavated with combines
 and pneumatic picks and more than 50 per cent using
 pneumatic or electric drills.
 Outmoded instruments such as pick-axes have
 already been replaced.  On the average, 80 per cent
 of traction on the underground working face and the
 haulage roadways are mechanized.  With the rise of
 the extent of mechanization, the labour productivity
 of workers has increased markedly.  In 1955, the
 labour productivity of coal-miners was more than two

 times that of 1950.  In 1954, state-owned coal-mines
 had generally installed modern ventilation devices,
 thus assuring more than 3 cubic metres' fresh air per
 minute to miners working underground.
 Chang Ming-shan, a worker of the Anshan Iron
 and Steel Company, successfully developed, with the
 assistance of Soviet experts, the Reverse Repeater,
 which has greatly improved the working conditions of
 the workers, eliminated occupational diseases and
 scalding accidents and raised the efficiency of the roll-
 ers by 22.5 per cent.  A worker named Lu Nai-tao
 co-operating with a technician called Wu Liang-ya, in-
 vented the Automatic Continuous Steel Conveyer at-
 tached to the furnace, which has not only raised the
 efficiency by 21 per cent, but has also freed the furnace
 workers from working in high temperature and re-
 duced the possibility of injuries from scalding.  The
 workers and staff members of the Anshan Iron and
 Steel Company enthusiastically put forward proposals
 for improving technique and for safety methods in
 production.  Many of these proposals have been put
 into practice and the workers have been released from
 heavy manual labour and from working in high tem-
 perature.  The workers of that Company have said,
 "In the past, we operated machines either knee-deep
 in water or in extreme heat, but at present we can
 sit beside the machine and watch it work."  All ad-
 vanced workers in the various factories and mines
 throughout the country are continually thinking of
 ways to further improve working conditions and meas-
 ures for ensuring safety in the operational processes
 as well as'seeking new methods to wipe out accidents.

 In order to lower the temperature in the workshops in
 summer, the textile industry proceeded in the year
 1953 to improve and install ventilation and air condi-
 tioning equipment on a large scale.  Approximately
 95 per cent of the spinning workshops in the state-
 owned mills all over the country have installed air-
 conditioning plants, so the temperature in the work-
 shops is reduced, and the workers happily say, "While
 it is extremely hot outside in summer, the tempera-
 ture in the workshops is as cool as in spring."
 Work has been carried on over the last few years
 on the training of cadres specialized in labour protec-
 tion.  Since 1953, the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions has invited experts from the Soviet Union to
 train cadres and teachers in this field.  Teachers so
 trained have in turn helped the managements of enter-
 prises to train other labour protection cadres.  In-
 dustrial, provincial and municipal trade union organ-
 izations have also trained a number of such cadres.
 In 1955, according to the statistics of five trade
 union organizations including Railway Workers' Trade
 Union, Trade Union of Workers of the Second Ma-
 chinery Industry, Electrical Workers' Trade Union
 and the Shanghai Trade Union Council, 18,147 cadres
 and activists have received preliminary training in
 labour protection, and more than 1,000 cadres have
 received systematic training on Soviet practices in
 labour protection.

 IMPROVEMENTS IN HOUSING
 The People's Government and the trade union or-
 ganizations of China give a lot of attention to improv-
 ing the housing conditions of the workers and staff
 members. Many workers' houses are being built in the
 industrial cities accommodating large numbers of
 workers.  Between 1952 and 1954 forty workers' hous-
 ing estates were built in twelve areas in Shanghai with
 accommodation for 160,000 persons.  During the same
 period, more than ninety public buildings, including
 schools, creches, clinics, co-operatives, vegetable mar-
 kets, parks and cinemas, have been built; and of
 these, five middle schools and twelve primary schools
 alone can accommodate more than 20,000 workers'
 children.  Roads and bridges have been built and
 sewerage laid; in these areas there are also post of-
 fices and telephones.  The Public Bus and Tram Com-
 pany of Shanghai also opened new bus lines to make
 it easier for the workers to go to work and return
 home.  In Shenyang houses with more than 509,000
 square metres of floor space were built in 1954, and
 many of these housing estates have grown trees and
 flowers, with beautiful lawns.  One of the regular jobs
 of the trade union organizations is to help the manage-
 ment of the enterprises to allocate new houses to the
 workers.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 In addition to building new houses the state has
 taken measures to improve the sanitary conditions of
 working-class areas. For instance, there are about ten
 thousand people living in Yaoshui Lane in the Puto
 District of Shanghai.  Before liberation, sanitary
 conditions were very bad, with rubbish all over the
 place.  There was no sewerage, and epidemics were
 quite common, giving this lane a very high mortality
 rate.   After liberation the sanitary conditions in the
 houses were improved. Sewerage was built, taps fixed,
 street-lamps installed, the worst parts of the road re-
 built and water-tanks and dust-bins were put on the
 streets.
 On moving to the new houses with their families,
 many workers could not help recall the terrible hous-
 ing conditions they had suffered before the liberation.
 At that time, most of them had no real houses and
 lived in reeking thatched sheds or even in leaky boats.
 In the dormitories of some factories dozens of work-
 ers crowded in one room, sometimes three shifts of
 workers sleeping in the same room by turn.  Under
 these conditions, fresh air and sunlight were out of
 the question.  Wei Tung-sheng, a stevedore of the
 Harbour Affairs Bureau of Shanghai who had lived
 in a thatched shed for more than ten years, said on
 moving into a new flat, "In the past, whenever it rained
 outside, it always drizzled inside my shed. I used to
 think I would live in that shed all my life.  How could
 I dream of living in such a fine house!"  Teng Sheng-
 lou, a mason, said on moving to the workers' flats
 which he helped to build:  "How could a mason live in
 such a fine building if it had not been for the leader-

 ship of Chairman Mao! We built many houses before
 liberation, but we could not even call a piece of brick
 or tile our own !"
 Before liberation, house rents used to take up 30-
 50 per cent of a worker's wage; this naturally aggra-
 vated the problem of maintaining a living. Soon after
 liberation, the People's Government promulgated a
 decree to abolish ill practices in house renting and
 partially settled the housing problem of workers. New
 houses built for workers by the People's Government
 are rented at very low rates; those charged on family
 houses occupy only 5-8 per cent of the worker's wage,
 while houses for single persons are charged even less.
 Today, together with the rapid development of
 the peaceful economic construction of our country,
 many new industrial cities have arisen.  The ranks
 of the working class have been growing continually
 and the urban population has increased considerably.
 The state and the trade union organizations are mak-
 ing every effort to improve the workers' housing condi-
 tions with a view to meeting the growing needs of the
 broad mass of workers.
 In 1952, the state built many flats capable of
 accommodating one million workers and staff
 members. In 1953, workers' flats with a floor space
 of 12 million square metres were built, and in
 1954, 13 million square metres.  In 1955, accord-
 ing to the state plan, workers' flats with a floor
 space of 11 million square metres were expected
 to be built.  To take the various industries as
 examples.   From 1949 to 1952, flats occupying a
 floor space of 2.5 million square metres were built

 for the coal-mining industry-well above the total
 of miners' dwellings built before liberation.  An-
 other 666,208 square metres of floor space were
 allotted to the same industry in 1953, and a fur-
 ther 604,893 square metres of floor space added in
 1954.
 From liberation up to 1953, flats occupying
 1,410,000 square metres of floor space were allotted
 to railwaymen's families, and hostels occupying
 another 250,000 square metres of floor space were
 built.     In the post and telegraph section, flats
 occupying 3,780 square metres of floor space were
 built in 1950, 32,675 square metres in 1951,
 83,914 square metres in 1952,  160,998 square
 metres in 1953, 52,533 square metres in 1954 and
 53,256 square metres in 1955, making a total of
 387,156 square metres for the past six years.
 From the time of liberation up to 1953, the
 state-owned textile mills built flats with more than
 800,000 square metres of floor space, in addition
 to the joint state-private textile mills which also
 built many new flats for their workers and em-
 ployees.
 In addition to the great number of houses built
 by the People's Government for the workers, more and
 more workers are building their own houses as a result
 of the constant increase in wages.  In this respect,
 the workers have received assistance both from the
 Government and the administration of their enter-
 prise.  Land is provided by the Government or the
 administration concerned, while sewerage, street light,
 public toilet and other public facilities are installed

 free of charge.  In case of financial difficulty, work-
 ers can get loans from the administration to be re-
 imbursed in installments.  Workers may put forward
 their favourite designs and ask the administration to
 give help on it. They can also get help on the supply
 and transporting of building material, as well as on
 construction matters.  Houses so built are owned by
 the workers for their free disposal without having to
 pay any rent.   Even the installments on loans to be
 repaid monthly are generally lower than the rent
 which the workers used to pay.
 Houses built by railway workers on their own
 cover a total floor space of 7,500 square metres in
 1954 and 417,948 square metres in 1955.  The
 coal-miners built 381,552 square metres in 1955.
 The number of workers' families who built their
 own houses in 1955 were: 2,095 in Chungking,
 1,817 in Penki and 1,092 in Wusih.

 WOMEN WORKERS ENJOY
 EQUAL RIGHTS
 The Constitution of the People's Republic of China
 stipulates: "Women in the People's Republic of China
 enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of political,
 economic, cultural, social and domestic life."  These
 rights of the Chinese women workers have already
 become a reality.
 Before liberation Chinese workers led a very hard
 life ; but harder still was the life of the women work-
 ers.                                        Not only was there no place for them socially
 and politically, but they were paid only half or two-
 thirds of the wages of men even when they did the
 same work. At that time the imperialists and bureau-
 crat-capitalists exploited them as one of the main
 sources of cheap labour. Even so, it was very difficult
 for a woman to get a job.  For instance, a young
 textile woman worker Ho Chien-hsiu, now a nation-
 ally-famous model worker, was unable to find a job
 in any textile mill in Tsingtao.  Tien Kuei-ying, the
 first woman railway driver in New China, had to make
 her living before liberation by fishing on the beach.
 The vast number of Chinese women, with their great
 potential knowledge and capacity for work, were
 obscured in the old China and had to wait for the new
 society to show their talents.

 Since the founding of the People's Republic of
 China the rapid restoration and development of our
 national economy has opened a broad road for women
 to participate in social work.  Over the past six years
 the number of women who have participated in indus-
 trial construction for socialism have greatly increased
 and the women workers and employees of the whole
 country in 1955 totalled 1,970,000, four times more
 than that in 1949.
 In the peaceful construction of their country the
 women workers of New China have learned to handle
 the complex technique of modern industry. The num-
 ber of skilled women workers is increasing daily among
 the growing and powerful ranks of the working class.
 There were no women workers in the Shang-
 hai machine industry in the past, but now wom-
 en workers amount to 6.9 per cent of the total
 employed; there were only 11 skilled women
 workers in Tientsin in 1950, while this increased
 to 1,307 by 1953; there were very few women
 workers in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company in
 the past, while now we have nearly 7,000.  Even
 in the newly-built seamless tubing mill, an up-to-
 date socialist industry, quite a number of young
 women workers are operating the complicated
 automatic machines.
 A great many women workers in New China have
 become enthusiastic workers, showing great initiative
 in learning new jobs and becoming skilled workers.
 They have evolved many new methods to increase pro-
 duction.                                  For instance, Wu Yu-Ian, a woman worker
 in the electrical apparatus repairing works of the

 Anshan Iron and Steel Company, designed two special
 relays, and improved the method of work on seven
 operations, whilst leading the recording machine repair
 group.  Kuo Hsiu-yun, a young operator in the long-
 distance telephone exchange of the Tientsin Telecom-
 munication Administration raised the efficiency of the
 telephone lines 22.62 per cent by using a new method.
 Mastering the principles of the spinning machines, Ho
 Chien-hsiu of Tsingtao No. 6 Cotton Mill worked out
 a scientific method of spinning.  As a result of po-
 pularizing this method, the average amount of yarn
 produced by state-owned cotton mills all over the coun-
 try has been increased 12.32 per cent.
 Yang Ling-ying, a woman worker in the spooling
 room of the state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Textile Mill,
 has achieved full production records ever since the
 beginning of the First Five-Year Plan without a single
 day passed not having overfulfilled her production
 targets. During her three years in the spooling room,
 she was faultless in her work.  Since 1953, she has
 been twice awarded as a model textile worker of
 Shanghai and was elected in 1955 to attend the Na-
 tional Conference of Young Builders of Socialism.
 Many women workers have made great contri-
 butions to production and are awarded the title of
 model workers.
 In 1954 there were 11,600 women model work-
 ers at workshop level in the factories and mines.
 For example, in Tientsin the women model work-
 ers on a municipal level in 1954 made up 10.24
 per cent of the total number of model workers.
 The women model workers in Peking accounted

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 for more than 7.2 per cent of the total in 1954,
 and that was one and half times more than the
 previous year.  In the textile industry more than
 half of the model workers are women.
 New China's women workers not only receive
 equal pay for equal work, they also play the same part
 as men in factory administration. Many women work-
 ers have become directors of enterprises.  Chao Kao-
 shih, head of a magnesite brick shop in the refractory
 material factory of the Anshan Iron and Steel Com-
 pany, was promoted from leader of a team and chief
 of a section to her present position.
 Li Chih-ying of the state-owned Peking No. 1
 Cotton Mill was only a sixteen-year-old village girl in
 1953, coming from the Laikuangying Agricultural Co-
 operative in the eastern suburb of Peking.  Then she
 passed her examination to the cotton mill and was
 sent for training in the trade at the Tsingtao Textile
 Mill, where she made outstanding records and man-
 aged to help others in their studies.  After joining
 the Peking No. 1. Cotton Mill, she was made a group
 leader of doffers in the spinning room and later on
 promoted to a team leader in charge of more than
 twenty workers.  She united her team-mates and
 studied together good working methods to improve
 their skill.  In 1954, she was sent to receive training
 as an assistant foreman.  The only schooling she had
 in the village was one year in a primary school and
 literacy class, yet she managed to learn the principles
 and theories of cotton spinning as well as machine
 repairing and oiling.  As she was assiduous in her
 studies, she became an assistant foreman in 1955 at

 the end of four months' training.  Another example
 is Shih Hsiao-mei, the deputy director of the Shanghai
 No. 1 Cotton Mill, who was only an ordinary woman
 worker some time ago.
 In 1953 more than 1,680 women workers were
 promoted to leading positions, and in 1954, an
 additional 2,390 women workers were promoted.
 It is stipulated in the Constitution of the People's
 Republic of China that marriage, the family, the
 mothers and children are protected by the state.  In
 addition, women workers enjoy equal rights with men
 workers in labour insurance, and they are entitled to
 a total of 56 days' leave of absence from work before
 and after confinement.  In cases of difficult delivery
 or the birth of twins, women workers are entitled to
 70 days' leave.  Full wages are paid during leave.  Ex-
 penses for delivery and pre-natal examination are paid
 by the enterprise. In the case of child-birth, a woman
 worker or staff member, or the wife of a male worker
 or staff member, receives a maternity benefit of 4
 yuan with which they can buy about a hundred eggs.
 Before liberation, it was entirely different.  Pregnant
 women workers would be thrown out of employment.
 Han Ya-chin, a woman worker in Shenyang No. 7
 Rubber Factory, for instance, had been dismissed four
 times because of pregnancy during 5 years.         Such
 things have been done away with once for all.
 In order to lessen the family burdens of women
 workers and to protect their health, the state sets as
 a rule that any enterprise covered by the labour in-
 surance shall provide creches independently or jointly
 wherever there are over twenty children of less than

 four years old belonging to the women workers
 and staff of that enterprise. Where conditions do not
 permit such a creche, nursing rooms for babies shall
 be set up wherever there are more than five babies.
 All expenses incurred for child welfare are to be borne
 by the state, and complete or partial subsidies are
 granted to working mothers who have difficulties to
 provide their babies with proper food.  Factories and
 enterprises are doing what they can to lighten the
 work of expectant mothers, to provide extra nutrition
 and dietetic canteens, special rest rooms and even
 maternity rooms.  There are special living quarters
 for working mothers, special buses for pregnant work-
 ers to and from the places of work and women's
 sanitation rooms attached to each workshop where
 there are women workers.  Such facilities were un-
 known or rarely provided in the factories before libera-
 tion. For instance, among all the food processing and
 tobacco factories in Shanghai, only one tobacco factory
 had a small creche before liberation.
 Since the promulgation of Labour Insurance
 Regulations, 2.2 million women workers and the
 wives of male workers received maternity bene-
 fits up to 1954.  In order to help women workers
 to solve the difficulty of taking care of their child-
 ren, an increasing number of nurseries and nurs-
 ing rooms have been set up in the state enter-
 prises. There were 1,380 nurseries in the country
 in 1952, 1,680 in 1953, some 4,000 in 1954, and
 5,861 by the end of September, 1955, with accom-
 modation for 173,090 children, in addition to
 small nurseries in other factories and enterprises.

 In looking after the health of mothers and chil-
 dren, the trade unions always see to it that pregnant
 women are relieved from heavy work, and are given
 nutritious food.  Dietetic canteens, rest rooms, pre-
 delivery waiting rooms, nursing rooms and dormi-
 tories for mothers are set up, and special buses are
 provided for pregnant women workers.  In many en-
 terprises special rest rooms are provided for women
 workers.  In New China, not only do the women work-
 ers have the right of full equality with male workers
 in social and political life, but the wives of the work-
 ers also have these rights.  The trade union organiza-
 tions help them to raise their cultural level and polit-
 ical understanding.    Dependents of the workers, who
 live near the factories or mines, have been organized
 to study in classes and discussion groups.

 CULTURAL AND TECHNICAL
 ADVANCEMENT
 Marching towards socialism, the Chinese workers
 have become workers with culture.  In old China, the
 labouring people were deprived by- the reactionaries
 of any right to education.  Teng Yu-kai, a boiler house
 worker in Li Hua Rubber Factory in Changsha, Hunan
 Province, remarked that three generations of his
 family had never had any education.  This was very
 common among workers in the past when 60 per cent
 to 80 per cent of the workers were illiterate or semi-
 illiterate.  Since the establishment of the People's Re-
 public of China, the state and trade unions have taken
 widespread measures to help the workers raise their
 cultural and technical level.  Many illiterate workers
 have begun to learn to read and write.  One result
 of studying at spare-time schools was that many work-
 ers are now able to read blueprints, make designs and
 calculations and able to learn improved methods of
 work and obtain scientific and technical knowledge
 from newspapers and booklets.  They have played an
 important part in making new discoveries, utilizing
 the full potential of machinery, making rationaliza-
 tion proposals, and improvement of working methods,
 testing the quality of the products and increasing
 productivity.  Wang Li-hsing, a miner in Chaoke-

 chuang Colliery in Kailan, who was illiterate before
 liberation is now a student in junior middle class.
 After visiting the Anshan Technical Exhibition, he im-
 proved his tool and so increased productivity 7 times.
 Yang Hsien-chang, a worker in Shenyang Chemical
 Works,  designed  a  petroleum  pump  by  applying
 theories he learned in the physics class, and mechan-
 ized production.                                          Ma Hsiao-fa, a fitter in the Tientsin
 Rubber Factory, put forward 35 rationalization pro-
 posals, one of them replaced imported carbon with
 home produced carbon, saving 800,000 yuan for the
 state and bringing down the cost of production by 20
 per cent.
 The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has
 decided to wipe out illiteracy among workers and staff
 in China within three years beginning from 1956. All
 the industrial unions have already mapped out their
 plans in this respect.  The Electrical Workers' Trade
 Union and the Posts and Telecommunications Work-
 ers' Trade Union have decided to eliminate illiteracy
 among their workers and staff by the end of 1956,
 while the Railway Workers' Trade Union, the Trade
 Union of Workers of the First Machinery Industry
 and the Textile Workers' Trade Union have planned to
 eliminate illiteracy among their workers within two
 years.
 In Shanghai and Hangchow, it is planned to a-
 chieve literacy among the workers and staff within two
 years.  The Shihchingshan Steel Works in Peking
 plans to wipe out illiteracy among its workers in two
 years.  Workers and staff of the Peking Agricultural
 Machinery Factory and the Chengtse Mine also plan

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 to wipe out illiteracy and semi-illiteracy in one and
 half years.  They have decided to help the workers
 to reach the standard of a junior primary school
 graduate in the Chinese language and arithmetic, and
 to have about 90 per cent of the new literates enter
 senior primary schools.
 Throughout the country there are 13 differ-
 ent trade union newspapers, the most important
 being the "Workers' Daily," organ of the All-
 China Federation of Trade Unions, which now has
 a daily circulation of over 150,000 copies.  The
 periodical "Workers of China," published by the
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions, now has
 a circulation of 290,000 copies. In 1954 the
 Workers' Press printed 219 kinds of books in-
 troducing the work and theory of the trade
 unions, the experience and lives of advanced
 workers,  and other  reading  material for the
 workers.  In 1955, 20 million copies of 271 kinds
 of books were printed.
 In order  to  help  the  workers  wipe  out
 illiteracy, 1,100 spare-time schools had been set
 up throughout the country by 1954. The workers
 and staff members attending such classes totalled
 276,432 in  1949;    764,199 in  1950; 2,026,381
 in 1951; 2,344,272 in 1952; 2,587,967 in 1953;
 3,050,000 in 1954.
 In order to develop systematically the intellectual
 capacity of the workers and peasants who form the
 mainstay in our national construction, the Government
 has continued from 1950 to increase the number of
 short-term middle schools.  A first batch of 1,680

 students was graduated in 1953, out of whom 1,622
 entered college or university, and in 1954 out of 4,187
 graduates 3,297 entered college or university.  It was
 impossible in the past for thousands of workers to
 go to high schools, or even to middle schools.  Wang
 Yen-kai, a graduate from a miners' short-term middle
 school and afterwards student of the Peking Mining
 Institute, said:  "In the old society, we were called
 `black-boys,' but today we have become university
 students, and that is a thing we had not dared
 to dream of before!"  But today, in a people's de-
 mocracy led by the working class, it has become a
 reality that workers go to middle schools and univer-
 sities.  And all members of this army of reservists
 for socialist construction clearly realize that they have
 the duty to study and understand why they study, so
 that they can transform their ideals into a force for
 progress.
 Short-term middle schools have increased in
 number-from 24 schools with 4,447 students in
 1950 to 58 schools with 27,924 students at the
 end of 1953 and to 87 schools with more than
 51,000 students in 1954. The proportion of indus-
 trial workers studying in schools is increasing
 yearly: in 1952 it was 14 per cent, in 1953, 23 per
 cent, in 1954, 40 per cent and in some places even
 higher.  For example, more than 2,100 industrial
 workers were among the new students who reg-
 istered in the 1954 summer vacation classes of
 eight short-term middle schools for workers and
 peasants in Shanghai, forming 70 per cent of
 the total.  Out of the 184 graduates from the

 short-term  middle  school  attached  to  the
 Engineering College of Dairen in the 1954 summer
 vacation more than 96 per cent were industrial
 workers.
 With the development of national economic con-
 struction, the Chinese workers have shown an increas-
 ing desire to raise their technical level.  In this field,
 we must first of all be grateful to the disinterested
 assistance of the Soviet Union and the helpful advice
 of Soviet experts.  We must also gratefully thank the
 People's Democracies for their technical assistance.
 From 1950 to 1954, at the Anshan Iron and Steel Com-
 pany Soviet experts made more than 30,000 impor-
 tant proposals for rationalizing production, more than
 10,000 proposals concerning capital construction and
 more than 8,000 proposals in design, making a great
 contribution to increasing the production potential of
 the Company.  The Chinese workers have conscien-
 tiously learned new Soviet technique and methods to
 further raise their ability in national construction,
 as, for example, the Soviet method of blast furritce
 repair which shortens the time taken for general re-
 pairs from six months to one.  We have also learned
 the Soviet method of iron ore mining which has in-
 creased the extraction rate from 60 per cent to 90 per
 cent. We have learned the Soviet method of mechaniza-
 tion of assembly in building which on an average has
 increased by about 30 per cent the speed of operations:
 today, it only takes 14 months to build a 12,000-kw
 power station.  Many workers with the aid of Soviet
 experts have succeeded in mastering new technique
 and can, after a short time, operate new and compli-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 cated machines.  Hu Chao-sen, an apprentice techni-
 cian working on blast turbines in the blast furnace
 works of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, was
 able, thanks to the assistance and directives of Soviet
 experts, after two years to become familiar with the
 theory and operating methods, including the assem-
 bling, adjusting and working of the turbines, and has
 even independently assembled complete turbines.  Liu
 Sze-chieh of the Peking airport, who was formerly a
 watchman, has become a skilled mechanic.  Chen Teh-
 hsiang, formerly a car driver at the Harbin airport,
 has become a radio technician.  Wang Ping-cheng, an
 unskilled worker in the former Joint Sino-Soviet
 Petroleum Company, has become a well-drilling en-
 gineer.
 From 1953 to 1955, the Soviet Union trained
 for the Anshan Iron and Steel Company more than
 360 technical personnel.  With the warm and
 sincere assistance of the Soviet experts, the
 former Joint Sino-Soviet Non-Ferrous and Rare
 Metals Company has trained more than 5,000
 skilled workers and technicians.  Owing to the
 patient teachings of Soviet experts, 2,000 former
 cattle breeders or peasants from China's national
 minorities have been trained as skilled workers
 and competent technical personnel in the former
 Joint Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company.
 The Chinese trade unions co-operate with man-
 agements to organize various technical courses, spare-
 time technical schools, technical research groups,
 technical lectures, and demonstrations of advanced
 methods. With a view to raising the technical abilities

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 of the workers, they have also arranged for old skilled
 workers to take young workers as apprentices, with
 contracts guaranteeing teaching and learning.
 At present, there are more than 220,000 workers
 and staff studying in spare-time schools of higher
 education and secondary vocational training.  Among
 the higher institutions of spare-time education, there
 are eleven technological night colleges.  Night colleges
 and correspondence schools are established by such
 famous universities as the China People's University.
 Tsing Hua University, Harbin Polytcchnical Institute,
 Peking Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Peking
 Institute of Petroleum Engineering, Peking Mining
 Institute, Changchun Motor-cars and Tractors In-
 stitute.
 The spare-time secondary vocational schools are
 set up by the different branches of industries con-
 cerned.  Special courses are provided there for work-
 ers and staff of relevant factories and mines.  The
 goal set for these students is to complete all the
 courses within four to five years, by the end of which
 they should become technicians of an intermediate
 grade.
 From 1953 to 1955, there were 7,200 students
 graduated from the spare-time schools of higher and
 secondary education throughout the country.  Of the
 first 35 graduates of the Fushun Coal Mining Night
 College, one has been promoted to the position of as-
 sistant director, 14 to the position of shop managers
 and the rest to other leading posts.
 In 1954, more than 950,000 workers all over
 the country participated in spare-time technical

 courses, and 109,000 workers took part in full-
 time study in technical schools.  For example,
 during these last few years, the Anshan Iron and
 Steel Company has trained more than 24,200
 skilled workers, and more than 45,000 skilled
 workers have been promoted to higher positions,
 out of which 740 skilled workers have been pro-
 moted to be technicians or engineers, and 593
 workers promoted to leading positions in the
 management.  From 1949 to 1953, the mining
 industry  trained 21,541  administrative  cadres,
 trade union and other cadres, 3,552 of whom have
 become engineers and technicians.
 In old China, the workers had no right to educa-
 tion, neither did their children have any right to go
 to school.  In New China not only are the workers
 themselves obtaining education, but also the number
 of workers' and peasants' children who benefit from
 education has increased rapidly.  In 1954, the number
 of students from workers' and peasants' families con-
 stituted more than 80 per cent of primary school stu-
 dents, 58 per cent of middle school students and 20
 per cent of university students.

 FLOURISHING CULTURAL AND
 RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES
 Rich and colourful cultural activities, and sports
 and physical training, have become an inalienable part
 of the spare-time activities of the Chinese workers.
 Before  liberation,  the  Chinese  workers  found
 great difficulty in even getting enough to eat and did
 not have the time or opportunity to take part in cul-
 tural and recreational activities, and it was useless to
 talk about how to develop their artistic genius. In
 New China, the workers, freed from worrying about
 their living conditions, have time and energy to take
 part in any kind of cultural and recreational activity
 they like.
 The People's Government and trade union organ-
 izations make every effort to encourage the develop-
 ment of workers' spare-time cultural and recreational
 activities.
 In these last few years, many good worker-writ-
 ers have appeared.  Tang Ke-hsin, a worker in the
 No. 6 Textile Mill in Shanghai, has written a book
 called "Spring in the Workshop" which was well
 received by a large working-class public, and has been
 translated into many foreign languages.  Another
 worker, Sun Chen-hua of the Chinghua Press, Peking,
 has composed a song entitled "For a Happy Tomorrow"

 which obtained a third prize in the National Songs
 Competition.  Important works have been produced
 by workers in the fields of writing, painting, wood-
 carving.... Such works as "Gate Number Six," "Not
 a Cicada," or "The Hearts of Hundreds of Instructors
 Beat Together" are all lively literary creations by
 workers.
 In 1954, 11,900 groups with 162,000 workers
 have been organized in spare-time activities, in-
 cluding dramatic, choral and dance groups.
 In Peking there were 345 workers' literary
 and artistic organizations with 8,570 members in
 1952, these increased to 496 with 17,183 members
 in 1953, and reached 1,117 with 24,404 members
 in 1954.
 The rapid development of trade union clubs is
 one of the important factors guaranteeing the develop-
 ment of cultural and recreational activities of the
 workers on a large scale. After work, these clubs be-
 come the most lively and animated places in the
 factory.  There are quiet rooms where the workers can
 read newspapers or books, or play chess.  They can
 also participate in sports activities, or engage in choral
 or dancing rehearsals.  The clubs regularly organize
 all kinds of exhibitions, introducing advanced methods,
 and models of inventions and innovations, arrange
 scientific talks, organize lectures on the international
 situation and internal affairs, film shows and per-
 formances by workers' dramatic groups.
 Before August  1950, there were only  16
 municipal clubs.  But by the end of 1954 the
 number had increased to 1,260. Regarding the

 smaller clubs such as primary trade union clubs,
 before 1950 there were only 773 but by the end
 of 1954, there were 9,200 basic trade union clubs,
 2,700 workshop clubs and 255 hostel clubs.
 The number of libraries has greatly increased:
 there are now 17,486 all over the country with a total
 of 24,532,082 volumes of books.  In addition, mobile
 libraries visit workshops, construction sites and work-
 ers' flats, bringing to the workers the books and news-
 papers they like.  There are in the whole country
 25,986 mobile libraries.
 The' trade union film projection teams covering
 the whole country have over 1,200 16-mm. projectors
 and 400 35-mm. projectors, ten times more than in
 1951. In 1954, 827 16-mm. film projection teams gave
 more than 114,000 film shows with a total audience of
 110,000,000.
 In order to successfully carry out the glorious
 task of fulfilling the First Five-Year Plan, the working
 class of China must have not only high political con-
 sciousness, education and technique, but also sound
 physique.  Thus the trade unions of China pay great
 attention to the development of physical culture and
 sports among workers.
 In 1954, the First National Trade Union Physical
 Culture Conference was convened under the joint spon-
 sorship of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 and the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of
 the People's  Republic  of  China.  The  Conference
 decided that a policy of active leadership and system-
 atic development should be adopted for physical cul-
 ture and sports among workers.  It decided to give

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 priority to work in primary trade unions, the central
 task there being the further consolidation and ex-
 tension of radio-broadcast physical exercises, system-
 atic development of diverse forms of physical cul-
 ture and sports activities and the establishment of
 sports societies.  The Conference decided to strength-
 en political-ideological work, to recruit sports cadres
 in trade union organizations at all levels, to put the
 organizations on a sound basis, and to set aside for
 sports activities 10 to 15 per cent of funds for recrea-
 tional and educational activities.  It was also decided
 that suggestions should be made to the management
 of enterprises that an appropriate amount of money
 be set aside out of the director's fund for sports
 activities.
 In October 1955, the Workers' First National
 Sports Meeting was held in Peking.  Taking part in
 the Meeting were over 2,000 men and women competi-
 tors of seventeen industries, selected from competitions
 at all levels, right from the workshops and primary
 trade unions up to the industrial unions.  Altogether
 more than one million workers took part in competi-
 tions of diverse forms at all levels, thus bringing about
 an unprecedented nationwide upsurge of sports activi-
 ties among the workers.
 Some of the workers and staff have broken na-
 tional records in sports activities. For instance, Liang
 Shu-mei, a woman building worker, broke three na-
 tional records in the 1954 National Swimming Contest.
 Liu Cheng-pang, a weigher at Yucheng railway station
 of the Tsinan Railway Administration, broke the na-
 tional grenade-throw record in the 1953 National

 Athletic, Gymnastic and Cycling Meeting.  Sun Hung-
 hsia, a woman worker of the Harbin Electromotor
 Works, broke the women's national record for 800
 metres; Liu Cheng, a woman worker of the Suiyuan
 Posts and Telecommunications Administration, set up
 a national record in the women's 80-metre low hurdles.
 At the Workers' First National Sports Meeting,
 ten athletes established new national records in eight
 track and field events, in cycling and weight-lifting.
 National records for the men's 5,000 metres and 800
 metres were broken respectively by Fu Sheng-hai and
 Li Chung-lin of the railway workers' team.  Li Ping-
 cheng of the educational workers' team broke the
 men's  national  shot-put  record  which  stood  for
 nineteen years; Wang Yi of the same team broke the
 women's national javelin-throw record.  Wu Shu-hua
 of the light industry workers' team set up a new record
 in the women's 1,500-metre cycling event.  Li Feng-
 chin of the first machinery industry workers' team,
 Li Kuei-chih of the heavy industry workers' team and
 Wu Shu-hua of the light industry workers' team all
 set up new national records in cycling. Li Cheng-thing,
 Tsai Chang-hua and Hsu Kuo-ching of the light indus-
 try workers' team all set up new national records in
 weight-lifting.
 Some workers were selected to become members
 of various national teams. For example, railway work-
 ers Yao Shih-chung, Cheng Shih-chun and Ma Jen-hua
 were selected for the national basket-ball and volley-
 ball teams and represented China in international con-
 tests.  Wang Chuan-yao of the posts and telecom-
 munications workers' team represented China and

 scored successes in the table-tennis contest at the
 World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and
 Friendship held in 1953 in Bucharest.
 By the end of 1954, 57,400 basket-ball teams
 had been organized in the factories and mines
 throughout the country, with 566,000 workers
 taking part in this game; there were also 21,100
 volley-ball teams embracing 200,000 workers and
 4,100 football teams with 72,300 workers in them.
 Athletic meetings were held in all parts of the
 country in which 541,000 workers participated.
 According to the statistics of Peking, Harbin,
 Shenyang, Fushun and the Locomotive Sports
 Association, there were 116 sports associations

 UNEMPLOYMENT IS BEING
 ELIMINATED
 Before the liberation, as a result of the long years
 of aggression waged against China by the imperialists
 and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, serious
 unemployment existed in China.  After the founding
 of the People's Republic of China, the People's Govern-
 ment began to solve the problem of unemployment in-
 herited from the old regime.  The People's Govern-
 ment not only carried out a policy towards the work-
 ers and staff of the bureaucrat-capitalist enterprises
 described as "keeping the same job and drawing the
 same wages" but also adopted a policy of "taking over"
 all the personnel in the former Kuomintang govern-
 ment offices and the educational institutions who were
 left over when the rule of the Kuomintang collapsed.
 Moreover, in the last six years more than
 32,650,000 unemployed have been given jobs by
 the government.
 In New China, the state protects the jobs of the
 workers. Kuo Shou-jen, an old skilled worker of the
 Tientsin Motor Works, wrote a letter to his two broth-
 ers, which illustrates the feelings of the workers
 towards this new security: "I cannot remember in how
 many factories I had worked in Peking and Tientsin
 before the liberation, just trying to earn a living.  No

 matter where I worked, it was only a few months later
 that I became an unemployed again.  At that time I
 was no better off than a beggar.  Even though I was
 a skilled worker, it did not help me. Now it is more
 than five years since Tientsin was liberated, did you
 ever find me looking around for jobs in these five
 years?  In our factory, you can have an `iron bowl' or
 a `golden bowl' (a Chinese saying meaning a good,
 secure job. In the old society a job in the Customs was
 an `iron bowl' job, and a job in a bank a `golden
 bowl' job), if you will only take the job seriously.
 Not only do the skilled workers no longer remain un-
 employed, the state also trains the unskilled to become
 factory workers.  In the years since liberation, the
 number of workers and staff in our factory has in-
 creased four or five times.  Recently I took part in
 the discussion on the draft Constitution, and now I
 know that we have the right to work, and that the
 state guarantees our jobs. Thus our livelihood is, of
 course, ensured."
 The Constitution of the People's Republic of China
 provides that "Citizens of the People's Republic of
 China have the right to work.  To guarantee enjoy-
 ment of this right, the state, by planned development
 of the national economy, gradually creates more em-
 ployment, and better working conditions and wages."
 The state has over the last few years taken a series
 of measures to make this right a reality.
 With the development of the national economy,
 for those unemployed who possess the necessary quali-
 fications to take jobs, the People's Government has
 tried its best to help them to find employment.  For

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 those unemployed who temporarily cannot find jobs
 and have difficulty in maintaining a living, the Peo-
 ple's Government has given them help in the form of
 relief grants, or by providing relief work, organizing
 them to make a living through temporary productive
 work, giving them training for new jobs, or sending
 them back to the villages to engage in agricultural
 production.  At present, unemployment in the cities
 is being reduced daily and the number of workers
 who have qualifications but have not yet found jobs
 is now very small.  Having taken a responsible at-
 titude towards the unemployed, the People's Govern-
 ment will continue to adhere by this policy of helping
 the unemployed to find jobs, encouraging them to find
 jobs by themselves, or to make a living through tem-
 porary  productive                                           work  and  providing  vocational
 training to young people who need it.  As to those
 unemployed who temporarily cannot find jobs and
 have difficulties in maintaining a living, regular relief
 will be granted to them.
 Since the latter part of 1955, because of the rapid
 development of agricultural co-operation in China's
 countryside, there arose the need of large numbers
 of primary and secondary technical cadres in such
 fields as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy,
 animal  husbandry,  veterinary  medicine, production
 management, accounting, thus opening new perspec-
 tive for employment.
 In view of the rising tide of agricultural co-opera-
 tion throughout the country, the Political Bureau
 of the Central Committee of the Communist Party

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 of China put forward a draft National Programme
 for Agricultural Development, 1956-1967.  The Pro-
 gramme points out that, as far as possible, all areas
 should, within a period varying from seven to twelve
 years, practically eliminate the most serious animal
 diseases.  For this purpose, within seven years start-
 ing from 1956, veterinary stations should be set up
 in all the counties in agricultural areas and all dis-
 tricts in pastoral areas.  The co-operatives should
 have personnel with basic training in the prevention
 and cure of animal diseases.  Within twelve years
 starting from 1956 small hydroelectric power stations
 should be built where water power is available, each
 of them to serve one or several townships.  In seven
 to twelve years from 1956, determined efforts should
 be made to wipe out wherever possible all diseases
 from which the people suffer most seriously.  To this
 end every effort should be made to gradually promote
 health and medical services in counties and districts,
 and set up clinics in villages.  In seven to twelve
 years, all townships and large co-operatives should
 have telephone service. Telecommunication equipment
 should be installed wherever it is needed.
 In view of the need of personnel in all fields aris-
 ing from the expansion of agricultural co-operation,
 the Programme further instructed that in the next
 five to seven years starting from 1956 steps should be
 taken in the light of local conditions to wipe out un-
 employment in the cities and provide work for all
 urban unemployed.  This is quite possible.  For in-
 stance, the Kashing region of Chekiang Province has

 asked for the immigration of 100,000 people.  Kiangsi
 Province has also asked for half a million people. In
 this way, the unemployed left over from pre-liberation
 (lays will all get jobs in a few years as a result of
 arrangements made in the cities and countryside.

 WE ARE DETERMINED TO
 LIBERATE TAIWAN
 Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and this
 is a world-wide recognized historical fact.  The Cairo
 Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, both of them
 solemn international agreements, affirmed this fact.
 China's territorial integrity will never be complete as
 long as Taiwan remains to be liberated.      Therefore,
 to liberate Taiwan, to protect the sovereignty and
 territorial integrity of our country is the firm policy
 of the Chinese Government and the entire Chinese
 people.  This is our sacred task, and it is not only
 necessary for our security and territorial integrity,
 but also necessary for peace in Asia and the world.
 On August 22, 1954, the All-China Federation of
 Trade Unions, on behalf of workers throughout the
 country, endorsed the joint declaration issued by all
 Chinese democratic parties and people's organizations
 concerning the liberation of Taiwan, which is the ex-
 pression of the resolute determination of the six hun-
 dred million Chinese people.
 While the people of our great fatherland are
 advancing in great strides towards socialism, our
 8,000,000 fellow-countrymen in Taiwan are still suffer-
 ing under the armed rule of a foreign power, leading
 a miserable life stricken by poverty, hunger and terror

 and are unable to march forward together with the
 people of the country.  The liberated Chinese people
 have a constant concern over the suffering of their
 compatriots in Taiwan.  And the people in Taiwan,
 inspired by the growing prosperity on the mainland,
 are certainly looking forward to the day of returning
 to the bosom of their fatherland.
 The Chinese working class and the Chinese people
 fully realize that only when we have liberated Taiwan
 and eliminated the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique
 will we have completed the historic task of liberating
 the whole of China.  The liberation of Taiwan is in-
 separable to the cause of building socialism which is
 now under way in our country.  Our brother workers
 and fellow-countrymen in Taiwan will certainly one
 day be brought back into the great family of peoples
 of our fatherland.  The liberation of Taiwan is also
 important for safeguarding the security and terri-
 torial integrity of China and for defending peace in
 Asia and the whole world.
 Workers throughout China are now working en-
 thusiastically to raise production and practise econ-
 omy, to ensure the fulfilment and overfulfilment of
 the state plan, in order to meet the demand of the
 front and the rear and support the cause of liberating
 Taiwan. Workers and staff members in many factories
 have started emulation campaigns on a wide scale
 with the slogan of supporting the liberation of Taiwan.
 For example, on December 31, 1954, workers of No.
 8 open-hearth furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel
 Company set up a new record in high speed steel
 making of big furnaces in the entire works for the

 year 1954 after they had held a meeting against the so-
 called "Mutual Security Treaty" signed by the U.S.A.
 and Chiang Kai-shek.  In the first nine days of 1955,
 workers of the No. 7 open-hearth furnace created
 a new record.  The entire workers and staff in
 the steel department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel
 Works pledged they would produce 8,000 extra tons
 of steel in addition to the fulfilment of the state
 plan for 1954 in order to support the liberation of
 Taiwan.  Workers of the Shanghai No. 3 Iron and
 Steel Works put forward the slogan of "turning out
 one more ton of steel and rolling one more ton of steel
 means giving practical support to the cause of liberat-
 ing Taiwan."  Transport workers also pledge to fulfil
 the tasks for economic construction and for national
 defence and are ready to respond to the call of their
 fatherland to go to the forefront in the fight of liberat-
 ing Taiwan whenever it is required.  Road transport
 workers in Amoy, Fukien Province, have pledged to
 provide a plentiful supply of drivers and lorries when-
 ever it is required and transport goods wherever they
 are ordered.  The seamen have also pledged to do the
 same. Workers and staff in the Shanghai Power Plant
 have put forward a slogan promising an everlasting
 supply of electric current without a single second's
 stoppage.
 In Wuyi Mountain Range, which separates Fukien
 from Kiangsi, lies the bottle-neck of the Yingtan-
 Amoy Railway, now under construction.  In order
 to enable the railway to pass through, a young
 army of tunnel workers has launched the fight against
 this big mountain.  They have never made a tunnel

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350006-8
 in the past, yet difficulties failed to stop them.  The
 following song they sang depicts their confidence and
 ambition :
 High may the mountain be,
 But our will is higher ;
 Great may the ridge be,
 But our determination is greater.
 The rocks may be as iron hard,
 But our heroes spurn them as bean-curd.
 The pioneers of this army of tunnel workers and
 the pneumatic drillers worked day and night, attack-
 ing the hard rocks.  The highest record of drilling
 a 19-metre hole in one hour was reached.  As soon as
 the drillers came out, the shotfirers at once rushed
 into the tunnel with explosives. Hsu Teh-chun, an out-
 standing shotfirer, challenged the drillers by saying
 that "we will explode as deep as you drill." This gave
 impetus to the rapid progress of work.
 All these actions fully demonstrate the determina-
 tion of the workers throughout the country to liberate
 Taiwan; and these actions no doubt will play an im-
 portant part in its liberation.
 The 600 million Chinese people are determined to
 liberate Taiwan.  No force or obstacle in the world
 can make them waver.  The Chinese people have two
 ways to liberate their own territory Taiwan; apart
 from liberating it by means of war, there also exists
 the possibility of liberating it by peaceful means.
 Taiwan is the inviolable territory of China.  The
 people in Taiwan are an integral part of the Chinese
 population.  The liberation of Taiwan through what-
 ever means is China's domestic affair, and the Chinese

 people will never allow any interference by foreign
 powers.  No foreign power has a right in any case to
 interfere in this affair of the Chinese People's Re-
 public.                                              The Chinese people are determined to liberate
 Taiwan which will surely be restored to China.

 STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL
 FRIENDSHIP AND UNITY
 Unity and friendship is growing rapidly between
 Chinese trade unions and the working class in all parts
 of the world, and this is in the interest of the Chinese
 people and lasting world peace.  Our foreign trade
 union friends who visited New China have praised the
 achievements of our economic construction and the
 rapid improvement in the material and cultural life
 of the working people in the short space of five years.
 They have also been much impressed by our deter-
 mination to defend peace.  We are fully aware of the
 numerous difficulties ahead and the many defects in
 our work.  We consider the visits to our country by
 our foreign friends as inspections of our work which
 will not only inspire us and increase our confidence
 but will also help us to discover and overcome short-
 comings and stimulate us to improve our work.
 The Preamble of the Constitution of the People's
 Republic of China stipulates that "China has already
 built an indestructible friendship with the great Union
 of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Democ-
 racies; and the friendship between our people and
 peace-loving people in all other countries is growing
 day by day.  Such friendship will be constantly
 strengthened and broadened. China's policy of estab-

 lishing and extending diplomatic relations with all
 countries on the principle of equality, mutual benefit
 and mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and
 territorial integrity, which has already yielded suc-
 cess, will continue to be carried out.  In international
 affairs our firm and consistent policy is to strive for
 the noble cause of world peace and the progress of
 humanity."
 The Chinese working class and trade union or-
 ganizations are consistently advocating and firmly ad-
 hering in practice to the principle of establishing and
 developing friendly relations with the working class
 of all other countries on a voluntary basis, and to the
 principle of equality and mutual respect.  During the
 past years, Chinese trade unions have taken part in
 various international meetings of workers, exchanged
 correspondence,  publications  and  delegations  with
 trade unions of other countries, and this has promoted
 mutual understanding, confidence, friendship and soli-
 darity between us and also helped the inter-union unity
 within other countries.
 During the period between 1949 and 1955,
 Chinese trade unions made contacts with work-
 ing class and trade union organizations of 50
 countries, sent 137 delegations totalling 769 mem-
 bers abroad to attend various international meet-
 ings of workers and to pay visits to other coun-
 tries, whilst 1,021 delegates sent by working class
 and trade union organizations of other countries
 visited China on our invitation.
 In 1954, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 invited over 200 trade union delegates from over 20

 countries, including the Soviet Union, the People's De-
 mocracies, India, Japan, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon,
 Great Britain, France, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Israel
 and other countries to attend the May Day and Na-
 tional Day (October 1) celebrations and visit our
 country. They were of different political and religious
 beliefs, yet, after direct contacts, conversations and
 touring together, they found that they shared the
 same aspiration and demands for safeguarding world
 peace, for national independence, for trade  union
 rights, for betterment of the workers' life and develop-
 ing trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
 All these have greatly helped to promote mutual
 understanding and friendship.  We are of the opinion
 that possibilities do exist for the co-operation and
 unity of the working class of all countries, provided
 they have goodwill and respect for each other.
 In May 1954, the Friendly Discussion Meeting
 of Asian Trade Unions was held in Peking, the capital
 of People's China, under the collective sponsorship of
 trade unions of Asian countries and their leaders,
 based on the principle of equality, self-determination,
 mutual respect and friendly discussion.  The delegates
 of 17 trade unions from 9 countries in Asia with dif-
 ferent political and religious beliefs who participated
 in this Meeting expressed their common aspirations
 and demands  in a  declaration  which was passed
 unanimously. They all felt that this kind of discus-
 sion helped to promote mutual understanding, friend-
 ship and unity among trade unions of Asian countries
 and hoped that similar meetings would be held in
 future to promote working-class unity in Asia.

 On May 18 and 19, 1955, a Discussion Meeting
 of Asian and African Trade Unions was held in Peking,
 in which 213 delegates of 71 trade union organizations
 from 15 countries participated.  The Meeting was
 convened under the joint sponsorship of the Japanese
 Workers' Delegation, the Delegation of Indian Trade
 Unions and the  Delegation of Indonesian  Trade
 Unions to the May Day celebrations in China, with the
 unanimous approval of the heads of delegations of
 Asian  and African  trade unions.  The delegates
 pointed out in their statements that the Meeting was
 an unprecedented grand gathering of Asian and Afri-
 can trade unionists.                                       They emphasized in particular
 the need of safeguarding peace and opposing wars of
 aggression.  While upholding peaceful utilization of
 atomic energy for the welfare of mankind, the dele-
 gates unanimously called on prohibition of the manu-
 facturing, stockpiling and use of atomic and hydrogen
 bombs.  They  unanimously  supported the Asian-
 African Conference and the resolutions and final com-
 munique it adopted, believing that the Conference
 reflected the profound historic changes in Asia and
 Africa, that it was a symbol of the desire for peace and
 unity shared by countries in these two continents.
 The delegates supported the principle of peaceful co-
 existence among all nations and pointed out that unity
 of the international working class is the guarantee to
 the maintenance of peace.  They all expressed the
 desire to strengthen the friendship and unity of the
 people and working class of Asia and Africa in the
 struggle in defence of peace.

 In November 1955, the All-China Federation of
 Trade Unions and the Japanese Trade Union Delega-
 tion to China, in an atmosphere of friendliness, held
 talks on various questions concerning the workers'
 movement.  In these talks, the two parties came to
 a basic consensus of opinion and reached agreement
 on the question of friendship and unity between the
 trade unions of China and Japan, and, to a wider scope,
 on the question of friendship and unity among all
 trade unions of Asia and Africa.
 On January 6, 1956, the First Machinery Indus-
 try Workers' Trade Union of China and the Delega-
 tion of the All-Japan Federation of Electrical Machine
 Building Workers' Union, in an atmosphere of amity,
 freely exchanged opinions on various questions con-
 cerning the workers' movement. In the talks, the two
 parties reached agreement on the strengthening and
 promotion of friendship and contact between electrical
 engineering workers of China and Japan.
 The Third World Trade Union Congress pointed
 out correctly:  "The restoration of international trade
 union unity is of important significance.  This unity
 would further ease international tension and stop the
 competition in armaments.  It would help to develop
 friendly contacts in cultural and economic affairs
 among the nations of different social systems.  This
 unity would also help to increase peaceful production,
 lessen unemployment and improve the welfare of the
 people."
 More and more workers and trade unionists have
 come to understand this truth and support it.   The
 Chinese trade unions will continue to observe this

 principle of unity, to strive for strengthening friendly

 countries of the world to fight against wars of aggres-
 sion and for the preservation of peace in Asia and the
