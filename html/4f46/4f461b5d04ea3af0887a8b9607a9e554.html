 GUIDE to COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #59
 Principal Developments:
 Commentary
 21 July-3 August 1965
 1.  The Chinese heavily and repeatedly attack the Soviets on familar
 themes (largely related to Vietnam) such as "the Khrushchev revisionist
 line of capitulation, betrayal, and split," and "Soviet-U.S. collaboration
 for domination of the world," -- in a 2-page Peking editorial, an authori-
 tative People's Daily "Observer" commentary on the Helsinki WPC, remarkably
 militant speeches by Chinese delegation chief to the "11th World Conference
 against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" in Tokyo, and an unprecedentedly criti-
 cal speech by the Chinese Trade Union delegation chief to the Japanese
 Sohyo convention in Tokyo.  They publish the 7th volume of Khrushchev's
 Statements without editorial comment.  They also publicize another article
 from Vanguard, organ of the pro-Chinese dissidents in Australia, parroting
 not only the Chinese line on Soviet-U.S. collaboration to dominate the
 world but also their charge that K revisionism in the USSR has its social
 basis in the new privileged stratum.  The Albanians continue their running
 fusillade, including a new charge that "the K troika is prepared to sacri-
 fice the GDR."
 2.  On the other side, the Soviets continue their one-sided moratorium
 on polemics.  They publish two restrained articles of note:   a 27 July
 Pravda article exhorting the Social Democrats of the Socialist International
 to "discard anti-Communist prejudice" and join the Communists in joint ac-
 tions opposing U.S. aggression; and a 30 July Red Star editorial affirming
 the CPSU's resolute struggle against -- inter alia -- "manifestations of
 nationalism in the countries of socialism, in the workers and Communist
 movement.'
 3.   Belgrade's Borba on the 30th turns Peking's "privileged stratum"
 charge back against the Chinese, describing the million "socialist capi-
 talists" in China, "some who draw many thousands of yuan per month while
 the national average of wages in China ranges between 50 and 60 ... live
 in rich apartments, drive expensive automobiles   ..  (etc.)."
 4.   The annual "world conferences against A & H Bombs" in Japan are
 again split along lines of the Sino-Soviet conflict, with the World Peace
 Council, the Soviet Peace Committee, and other Soviet-aligned groups boy-
 cotting the "11th World Conference" meeting from 27 July to 2 August under
 sponsorship of the Chinese-line, JCP-controlled Gensuikyo.  After the belli-
 cose Chinese speech mentioned above, the. conference adopted resolutions

 fully supporting major Chinese -- and Indonesian -- policy positions,
 including "crush Malaysia!"  The rival Soviet-line, JSP-controlled
 Gensuikin conference will meet 11 August, with WPC and Soviet repre-
 sentation expected,...
 5.  The pro-Chinese dissidents supporting the semi-monthly Rote
 Fahne (Red Flag) announce establishment of a preparatory committee -
 for founding a new Marxist-Leninist CP in Austria:  they appeal for
 support to "workers" and  socialists  as well as Communists.
 6.  The pro-Chinese dissident Swiss CP launches an appeal "to all
 revolutionaries, Marxist or not," to forma new "Revolutionary Inter-
 national."  Protesting against the",superiority complexes" of both
 Moscow and Peking, the :P C.S'  indicates that the new international
 would create a third force between "the to hostile brothers" and pre-
 dicts that it will be set up early in August "somewhere in Europe."
 7.  Italian Communists are engaged?in a new discussion of "the
 crisis in Marxism" on the pages of PCI illustrated weekly Vie Nuove
 (New Ways).
 Significance:
 The furious Chinese onslaughts against the Soviets in mass meetings
 of international front organizations as well as in their own media con-
 tinue to widen the gulf between the protagonists -- and, it seems likely,
 to drive more and more sympathizers on both sides toward "third-force,"
 neutral, or "plague on both your houses" positions.  We will watch care-
 fully for possible reactions to the reported initiative of the Chinese-
 sympathizing dissident Swiss CP toward the formation of a new "Revolution-
 ary International," which seems to be a manifestation of such a drift
 toward middle ground between the egocentric "hostile brothers."
 If there were ever any doubt about the purpose of the Soviet initia-
 tive in urging a rapprochement between the Communists and the Social
 Democrats in Western Europe, as signaled by the 1+ February 1965 Veber
 article in Pravda, it has now been starkly revealed by the 27 July Pravda
 article by the same author calling on these Social Democrats to join the
 Communists in opposing U.S. "aggression."

 #59                                                      21 July-3 August 1965
 May-June--July (delayed, and continuing):  A fresh discussion of "the crisis
 in Marxism' by Italian Communists, precipitated by a statement in the 3 May
 issue, No. 22, of the PCT illustrated weekly Vie Nuove (New Ways), con-
 tinues on through No. 29 of 22 July.  Participants are the initiator, pro-
 minent PCI writer Pier Paolo Pasolini who conducts a regular column in
 the weekly under the heading  Dialogue with Pasolini," and his correspond-
 ents.  Pasolini's most revealing statement to date is in No. 24+, 17 June,
 as he replies to a rebuttal by Lamberto Guidotti.  After cautiously acknow-
 ledging the possibility that he is "projecting a personal internal crisis
 and converting it into a non-existent crisis of Marxism" and affirming
 that in any case he is still a good Marxist and writes "full of sincere
 good intentions," Pasolini goes on:
 "Having said this, I must persist in saying that a real crisis
 of Marxism -- it would be better to say 'of the Marxist parties' --
 does indeed exist.  I shall confine myself to listing a number of
 actual facts:
 (a) The violent and sometimes profoundly alarming polemic be-
 tween China and the USSR, which has split the traditional
 "intercommunist nation" in two.
 (b) The resultant break between the CPs of poor or underde-
 veloped nations and the CPs of industrialized nations.
 (c) The still partly mysterious deposition of Khrushchev....
 (d) The evil triumph of Stalinism in all Marxist parties....
 (e) The alarming political situation in many socialist countries,
 where Communist governments faced by very serious, urgent prob-
 lems have failed to 'continue' the revolution and have taken
 strong, highly centralized positions....  The position of
 writers and of intellectuals in general is very difficult and
 .in some cases precarious.  Furthermore, some middle-class at-
 titudes that never quite died out have revived (for example,
 minority nationalism such as Slovakian, Transylvanian, etc.,
 which seem sadly ridiculous phenomena).
 (f) The dramatic situation in the PCF [French CP], a party that
 has clung to a politically archaic mentality, steeped in a kind
 of rationalism borrowed from rigid and moralistic liberalism.
 One symptom of its crisis is the demise of the intelligent pub-
 lication of the French Communist youth (the pro-Italian) Clarte,
 a demise decreed by Communist officialdom.

 Approved For Release 2005/06/13 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040004-2
 (h) The marginal position into which the PCI has been forced in
 Italy in recent years, for the center of the stage has been oc-
 cupied by a struggle between a potential labor group (the
 center-left) and budding conservatism (the Milanese liberalism
 of neo-capitalism).  Symptoms of the PCI's involuntarily marginal
 position are its efforts to regain a place at the center of the
 political struggle:  its dialogue with Catholicism (designed
 to overcome the temporary Catholic-Socialist alliance) and the
 project for a 'single party.'
 As you see, I have simply listed harsh facts....  If you think
 that this is a matter of the usual continuous crisis, like unending
 evolution or the unceasing need to adaptto ever-changing historical
 reality, etc., you are being dishonest with yourself. For in doing
 this, you are ignoring the real situation....
 I must say, furthermore, that your own letter confirms my be-
 lief that the rank and file of the Party are only vaguely aware of
 the real crisis through which the CPs are passing right now.... The
 Communist elite and the intellectuals talk of nothing else....  Yet
 the rank and file ... go on fooling themselves with their old opti-
 mism about proto-Marxism, etc., etc...."
 June 15 (delayed):  Rote Fahne (Red Flag), semi-monthly organ of pro-
 Chinese dissident Austrian Communists, announces that "a meeting of 42
 activists of this magazine" in Vienna 12 June 1965, condemning the "re-
 visionist degeneration" demonstrated by the 19th Congress of the Austrian
 CP, "constituted itself as the preliminary 'Central Preparatory Committee'
 for the founding of a new CP in Austria," -- "a revolutionary, con-
 sistently M-L, really Communist Party."  It lists 11 members of a "busi-
 ness management office," with Franz Strobl designated as initiator.
 "The success of the work of the preparatory committee will es-
 sentially depend on the extent to which it manages to involve left-
 wing socialists and revolutionary-minded unaffiliated individuals,
 particularly young people, in addition to revolutionary and class-
 conscious individuals.
 The conference further decided to change the subtitle of Rote
 Fahne to "Tribune of the Austrian Marxist-Leninists" (from "Tribune
 of the M-Ls in the Austrian CP").
 July 10 (delayed):  Finnish CP daily Kansan Uutiset carries a forthright
 discussion of peaceful transition" by George Paile.
 "... I believe that the socialistic system will gain many new sup-
 porters if we clearly acknowledge the boundaries of political con-
 flict set by the present constitution and legislation.  The fear

 Approved For Release 2005/06/13 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300040004-2
 that the Communists would not play by the rules of our modern demo-
 cracy is one of the reasons for our political alienation.
 If we acknowledge peaceful transition to be morally binding,
 then we also have to acknowledge that no single party in Finland
 can bring about socialism.  The only possibility is cooperation
 with other socialists, and this in its turn would mean ... that we
 accept the existence of several other parties.  Also, the question
 of a particular party's'leading position' has to be seen in an en-
 tirely new light.  Can one speak of cooperation if one simultane-
 ously emphasizes one's own 'leading position". ... Peaceful and
 democratic transition means also the rightful existence of a po-
 litical opposition....  The peaceful return from socialism to the
 old system must also be possible if the required majority so desires.
 If these rights are acknowledged, then the talk about the dictator-
 ship of the proletariat is useless...."
 July 21 30:  Paris independent daily Le Monde carries items concerning
 a new initiative launched by the Chinese-sympathizing dissident Swiss CP.
 First is an AFP dispatch datelined Geneva, 20 July, reporting the launch-
 ing by the PCS of an appeal "to all revolutionaries, Marxist or not," for
 the creation of a new  Revolutionary International" uniting "all parties
 or groups desiring to struggle against imperialism."
 "At the same time, the PCS arises violently   ainst the superi-
 ority complexes of Moscow as well as Peking.'
 This appeal, which especially noted the support of 'Belgian,
 German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, and American comrades,'
 affirms that the idea of a new pro-Chinese International is hence-
 forth set aside.
 'In effect,' declares the PCS Central Secretariat, 'it is not
 fair that Moscow or Peking manifests such superiority complexes and
 preempts, under various guises more or less biassed or egocentric,
 the role of ruler of the Communist w,prld.  The two hostile brothers
 are too involved in maintaining and deepening their divergences to
 have the right to dominate anybody and to give advice and orders
 that they themselves do not follow....'"
 In an article on the 30th, LM acknowledges a letter from the PCS,
 rebutting criticism in a 27 July  latter to the editor:
 "As of 15r?July 1965, 311 cards have been delivered to members, and
 our records indicate a larger number of cards delivered to sym athizers.
 After all, we have never pretended to be thousands.  It is true that as
 long as our party defended only the theses of the Chinese comrades, re-
 cruitment was difficult.  Now that we have opted for a Communist path
 adapted to Swiss realities and possibilities, it is much less difficult
 for us to find new adherents."

 LM adds that in the remainder of the letter this new way is de-
 fined as a "clear and independent line" showing that the signatories
 "desire to  e neither slaves nor robots." And finally, the PCS announces
 that a new "revolutionary international" will be set up at a conference
 "somewhere in Europe  during the early part of Au ust.
 r 22:     Peking announces publication of Volume 7 of Statements by Khru
 shchev, containing 98 of his speeches, reports, etc. from July to December
 1957.
 Jury 24:  The Rumanian CP ends its Congress (see #58, July 18 and con-
 tinuing) without an outbreak of polemical warfare among its mutually
 hostile guests.
 July 27;  Peking daily Ta Kung Pao devotes two pages to a comprehensive
 article on  The Struggle Between the Two Lines over the Question of Deal-
 ing with U.S. Imperialism," by Fan Hsiu-chu.  After castigating the
 "Johnson doctrine" as "neo-Hitlerism," the article turns on "the Khru-
 shchev revisionists ... (who) have degenerated into the lowest flunkies
 of U.S. imperialism."
 "Both K and his successors who claim to be M-Ls are filled with
 awe before U.S. imperialism.  They have vociferously attacked Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung's thesis that imperialism is a paper tiger and
 distorted Lenin's famous saying that iriperialism is a colossus with
 feet of clay....
 The K revisionists are blind to the strength of the world's
 revolutionary people and regard U.S. imperialism as almighty....
 The counter-revolutionary black thread of Soviet-U.S. cooperation
 for world domination runs through their whole set of revisionist
 policies, be they peaceful coexistence, peaceful transition, or
 peaceful competition.
 .... Their words and deeds are hardly different from those
 of the U.S. imperialists....
 They profess support for the national liberation movements in
 Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but when it comes to deeds, they
 undermine them....
 ... By repeatedly capitulating to U.S. imperialism, what the
 K revisionists have received is humiliation and again humiliation.
 'While the drooping flowers pine for love, the heartless brook
 babbles on.'  And so the joint domination will end in nothing else

 where social democrats have influence, demand that the U.S. Government
 stop interfering in the internal affairs of Vietnam and also of other
 peoples fighting for national independence and social progress, and that
 it stop supporting rotten puppet regimes which are selling the interests
 of their countries."
 "The question ... is not one of discussing ideological differ-
 ences, not of a political rapprochement, but of the elementary duty
 of all democratic to join their efforts toward preserving peace, in
 the face of the worsening international situation caused by U.S. ag-
 gression.  Joint actions of socialists and Communists in this field
 could be a good example to all other democratic forces of the world."
 July 27 and continuing:  The annual "world conferences against atomic and
 hydrogen bombs" in Japan are again split along lines of the Sino-Soviet
 conflict.  The ''11th World Conference" sponsored by the Chinese-line,JeP'=.iC-P_
 controlled Gensuikyo meets in Tokyo 27 July-2 August, while the Soviet-
 line, JSP-controlled Gensuikin conference is scheduled for 11 August.
 Despite a 10 June Gensuikyo letter -- released on 26 July -- to the Soviet-
 controlled World Peace Council and the Soviet Peace Committee urging them
 "not to attend any splittists' meeting but to attend the 11th World Con-
 ference," there is no representation from the WPC, the SPC, or any other
 Soviet-aligned group.   (NCNA claims, however, attendance by the largest
 number of foreign delegates in its history:  169 from 4+7 countries.)
 KYodo reports from Moscow on 27 July that the Soviet Union will not at-
 tend either of the meetings in Japan this year, according to "a Soviet
 CP source."  Tokyo Asahi on the 29th reports that the World Peace Council
 will not send delegates to either meeting but will send messages to both
 -- and that Gensuikyo responded with a statement that it will not accept
 such a message from the WPC!
 The 28 July speech of Chinese chief delegate Liu Ning-i was remark-
 ably bellicose for a "peace assemblage":
 "Chairman Mao Tse-tung has said that 'the atomic bomb is a
 paper tiger which the U.S. reactionaries use to scare people.  It
 looks terrible, but in fact it isn't.'...
 Scared out their wits by U.S. imperialist blackmail, the lead-
 ing clique in another nuclear power ... did not hesitate to betray
 the interests of the people of the whole world in order to concoct
 the notorious Moscow tripartite treaty in partnership with U.S. and
 British imperialism.  This capitulationist line of yielding to the
 nuclear blackmail of U.S. imperialism is the diametric opposite of
 the correct line which this movement has persisted in all along....

 "...The Chinese road toward socialism differs from many others, al-

 There are,among the 1 million of these 'socialist capitalists,'
 some who draw many thousands of Yuan per month, while the national
 average of wages in China ranges between 50 and 60 yuan per month.
 They live in rich apartments, drive expensive automobiles, and
 frequently receive Western journalists....  The reason for this
 Chinese policy is that the CCP wanted to keep as many as possible
 of the bourgeois intelligentsia in their leading posts in industry

 Chinese working class has almost entirely paid to its bourgeoisie,
 shows the true aspect of this phenomenon...."

 936 WH.              PROMOTING THE ALLIANCE FOR PROGRESS
 25X1
 SITUATION:  The Comite Interamericano de la Alianza para el Progreso
 (CIAP -- Inter-American Committee on the Alliance for Progress) was created
 by the Inter-American Social Council (IA-ECOSOC) at its meeting in Rio 29
 October-16 November 1963. The CLAP was originally suggested by former
 presidents Juscelino Kubitschek, of Brazil, and Alberto Lleras Camargo, of
 Colombia, and in response to growing criticism of the lack of progress in
 the Alliance.   It is composed of a chairman, Carlos Sanz de Santamaria, of
 Colombia, and representatives from seven member countries.  The U.S. repre-
 sentative is Walt Whitman Rostow, chairman of the State Department Policy
 Planning Council.
 Among the many functions of CLAP are:   to examine Alliance problems;
 evaluate annually the amount of financing required by Latin American de-
 velopment, and survey the progress of the national and regional plans.   The
 fourth anniversary (17 August) of the signing of the Charter of Punta del
 Este comes as CIAP has just begun an intensive country-by-country survey of
 progress made during the year.  The first country to come under review was
 Argentina.  Next on the Committee's agenda during the month of August are
 Haiti, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, and Chile.  Progress and problems of all
 other countries in the Alliance will be examined before the end of the year.
 It will be recalled that the initial optimism generated by President
 Kennedy's dramatic announcement of 13 March 1961 was followed by a period
 of disillusionment.  Alliance early accomplishments fell far short of the
 high hopes generally held for it in Latin America.   For one thing, most
 people expected far too much far too soon; for another, per capita income,
 as a meaningful indicator pf progress, actually began to show a slight de-
 cline in the area as a whole and an alarming drop in certain countries.
 Now, after four years, although none of the major goals has yet been
 attained, progress in the last year has been encouraging.  Most important,
 perhaps, the per capita income rose from $300 for 1963 to $306 for 1964.
 This represents a per capita growth rate of 2% -- less than the minimum
 goal of 2.5% set by the Charter but more than the 15 year average of 1.7%.
 All 19 countries under review have made efforts to adopt tax reforms and
 improve the administration of tax collection.  More than half have sub-
 mitted national development plans -- still one of the bottlenecks in govern-
 ment-to-government financing.  Most of the countries have passed agrarian

 reform laws, although nowhere has the prescription been appropriate to
 the problem, and agricultural production continues low in the area as a
 whole.
 But despite these few optimistic signs, the Alliance is still plagued
 by the same fundamental ills that have inhibited its progress from the
 beginning.  It was originally contemplated in the Charter that the bulk of
 the capital needed for development would come from the private sector; that
 is, private firms would invest new capital in Latin America in the form of
 new industry.  Unfortunately, this most important aspect of the Alliance
 has been the most conspicuous failure, and it is the least talked about
 because the root causes are the political and social conditions for which
 the Latin American people and their leaders are largely responsible.  For
 example, government instability, threats of nationalization, harassment of
 private enterprise, discriminatory laws, corruption at all levels of govern-
 ment, have combined to keep foreign capital out and cause domestic capital
 to seek better investment conditions elsewhere.  In one of his last speeches,
 President Kennedy said in Miami on 18 November 1963:
 "If encouraged, private investment, responsive to the needs, the
 laws, and the interests of the nation, can cooperate with public activi-
 ty to provide the vital margin of success; as it did in the development
 of all the nations of the. West, including my own."
 And he added, undoubtedly thinking of the Latin American capitalists who in-
 vest their money abroad:
 "There can be no progress if people have no faith in tomorrow."

 SECOND AFRO-ASIAN CONFERENCE
 BANDUNG II
 SITUATION:   On the heels of the June coup in Algeria, the second
 Afro-Asian Conference (Bandung II) was postponed until 5 November; the
 Foreign Ministers' session until 28 October.  The permanent preparatory
 committee's decision defeated Algerian and Chicom-Indonesian efforts to
 proceed according to schedule and accorded with the more or less univer-
 sal interest in postponement, indefinite or otherwise.  The disappearance
 of Ben Bella and quick Chicom-Indonesian recognition of the Boumedienne
 regime have caused adverse reactions, particularly among the Arabs and
 Africans.  As a result, not only Asian moderates, but also and more sur-
 prisingly, radicals, notably Ghana and the UAR, may for different reasons
 find excuses or take steps that could further delay the Conference.
 The Radicals.   For example, Ghana announced on 23 July that the
 Organization for African Unity (OAU) Summit in Accra would not take place
 in September but instead would begin on 21 October.   This proximity of the
 OAII gathering to the scheduled date of the Afro-Asian Conference coupled
 with the concurrent session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)
 could pose, perhaps, insurmountable logistical and policy problems for the
 Africans.  The Algerians seem to regard the?Ghanaian move as an attempt to
 have the Conference moved out of Algiers.  In an apparent effort to marshal
 continued support for the convening of the Conference in Algiers, the
 Algerian foreign office on 24 July gave a briefing on the current status
 of preparations to the Afro-Asian chiefs of mission in Algiers.
 In their drive to get the Conference underway as soon as possible
 the Chicoms have focused their efforts on the Arabs and Africans.   Their
 pre-emptive measure in June was successful. in postponing the meeting until
 the fall:   this initiative through the preparatory committee prevented
 indefinite postponement by the foreign ministers' session which would have
 meant the end for the committee and, perhaps, for the Conference itself.
 The Chicom drive to ensure that there will be a Conference this fall began
 before they left Algiers in June.
 They will continue to take steps to redress Arab or African disaffec-
 tion and counter closer moderate cooperation.   Since the "Africa-is-ripe-
 for-revolution" line and speedy recognition of Boumedienne have been some-
 what counter-productive, they will probably be generally more cautious
 and less blatant in their dealings with Arabs and Africans; even assigning
 a good portion of the action roles to their Indonesian and Pakistani friends.

 Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio went to Africa in late July, but
 even here discussion of the Conference appears to have been buried in
 broader discussions.  The Chicoms could be confronted by a conflict be-
 tween their objectives and Indonesia's:                           The Chicoms are opposed to a
 radical rump session, but the Indonesians would probably accept it since
 they label the Conference a step on the road to a Conference of Newly
 Emerging Forces (CONEFO), currently Sukarno's pet idea.  Still another
 postponement would jeopardize the current plan for CONEK dAiring the
 summer of 1966.
 The Moderates.  Arab and radical African steps to delay the Confer-
 ence would obviously be welcomed by the moderates.  Some moderates feel
 that the truly unprecedented cooperation' within their ranks was instru-
 mental in achieving postponement, and they look to increased cooperation
 between the Far Eastern group and the Indian-led South Asia bloc.  Other
 estimates point to Indian-Ceylonese supported actions at the abortive June
 gathering as the only effective ones, although they were defensive in
 character.  Significantly, the Ethiopian draft, with some changes to suit
 the radicals,. was the basis for the preparatory committee's communique on
 postponement.  Currently, Japan, India and Ethiopia are planning discus-
 sions before the Conference but dissensions seem to exist between CENTO
 moderates Iran and Turkey and between. these two and Pakistan.  Moderate
 Arab and African participation on the permanent preparatory committee is
 generally regarded by the active moderates (on and outside the committee)
 as ineffectual.  To remedy this situation, it has been suggested that the
 committee be revamped to bring about greater active moderate representa-
 tion that could break the radical monopoly over preparations.
 Some Issues.  Moderates will also continue to be concerned. with the
 issues of Malaysian, GVN, ROK and Soviet participation.  The Algerian
 threat to the Philippines that the dispatch of troops to Vietnam could
 constitute grounds for exclusion suggests a premise-that the Chicom-
 dominated group could use for keeping the ROK (which has troops An South
 Vietnam) and     'GVN out and ad?hitting only the sVu    Interestingly,
 some moderates maintain that within the context of the Conference they
 take confidence in a firm U.S. position in Vietnam, and even radical Arab
 and African leader states are actively concerned that a negotiated peace
 be obtained in Vietnam, whereas the Chicoms want the Second Afro-Asian
 Conference to support their national liberation policy and. its specific
 application to the Vietnam situation.

 SOVIET ESPIONAGE CONTINUES
 25X1
 SITUATION:   On 16 June 1965, a Norwegian court sentenced Captain
 Kristen GjOen (pronounced 'GYOAN) to twelve years imprisonment for espi-
 onage in what Norwegians consider their most serious spy case since World
 War II; it is their eighthcas.e since that conflict.  Gj$en was a security
 officer in the Norwegian Air Force, stationed at Bod$ airfield in 1956-
 1957, and at Rygge airfield after the fall of 1960.                             He had also attended
 a Norwegian Defense Staff security course and, in 1957, a British Royal
 Air Force security course in England.   In his position, Gj$en had access
 to highly secret information about Norwegian air bases, Norwegian air
 force personnel, NATO papers, mobilization and defense plans.
 Gj$en went to the Soviet embassy in Oslo at an undisclosed date in
 1964, asked.to see the Soviet military attach', and offered to sell mili-
 tary information to the Soviets.  The Norwegian captain had gotten into
 .debt due to his domestic expenses and his excessive'drinking, and his
 alcoholism and financial worries had affected his work.   He had been fined
 for drunkenness, and had learned in December 1963 that he would be removed
 from his security duties, but the removal was not immediately carried out,
 and he continued to have access to highly secret information:  Thus, with
 his career under a cloud, with an urgent need for money, and with access
 to secret information, Gj$en decided to betray his country.
 During GjOen's first visit to the Soviet Embassy, the military attach,
 Colonel A.A. Zhuk, a GRU officer, questioned Gj$en to establish his bona
 fides, received documents from-him, and gave him 2000 kroner (approx. U.S.
 $280), getting a receipt for the money.  On 19 October, GjOen visited the
 Soviet Embassy again, this time meeting with a member of Zhuk's staff, Lt.
 Col. Sergei Yevdokimov, another GRU officer.   (Zhuk was reportedly out of
 Oslo at the time on other duties.)  Gj~en was asked if he could obtain in-
 formation on the NATO exercise Fallex, and he said he could, given time and
 money.
 In response to a question, Gj~en also told Yevdokimov that he could
 travel, though not on short notice.   Yevdokimov wanted him to go to either
 Vienna or Bern for  t r a   n i n g,  and it was arranged that if Gj$en
 could go to Vienna he would send the Oslo embassy a postcard signed "Willy"
 (W for Wien); if he could go to Bern, the card would be signed "Billy."  On
 arrival at one of these cities, he would go to the Soviet embassy, ask for

 the military attach4, deliver whatever documents he could bring with
 him, and stay-for three or four days.  G,j$en was not to call at the
 Oslo embassy again, or sebk other contact with embassy personnel in
 Oslo; he was shown photographs of a location outside Oslo and was told
 that 1heft was a "mail box," nearby ( a hole in the side of a hill,
 covered lay a stone) in which he could place documents.  At the end of
 the meeting, Gj$en received another 2000 kroner.
 Then Gj$en had the idea of going to the American embassy as well,
 telling them what he had done and offering to be a double agent.  In
 this way he would make more money and he hoped that working for the
 Americans would "legitimize" his activities.  But the American air at-
 tache'to whom Gj$en talked refused to consider such an arrangement, and
 told Gj$en that he would immediately inform the Norwegian authorities.
 Very reluctantly, G,j~en then turned himself in to the Norwegian Security
 Police.
 Despite their domestic publicity regarding the past accomplishments
 of Soviet espionage (see BPG #904, "Whitewashing the KGB," 24 May 1965),
 the Soviets customarily deny current accusations of espionage in other
 countries, no matter how well-founded.  They have been particularly vehe-
 ment in their denials in the G,joen case.                    On 18 December 1964, immediately
 after the Oslo press had first revealed the arrest of Captain GjOen and
 had linked Gj$en with the Soviets (the official Norwegian press release
 had only said that G,j4en had spied for an "unnamed foreign power"), Soviet
 Embassy Charge"A.S. Kaplin made an oral complaint to the Norwegian Foreign
 Ministry.  Kaplin was reminded that the official statement had not named
 the USSR, and that the Norwegian government cannot muzzle the Norwegian
 press.  On 23 June 1965, after the trial, the'Norwegians made an official
 protest to Soviet Ambassador Lunkov over Soviet activities revealed in the
 Gj$en case.  The Soviets brusquely rejected this protest on 21 July, main-
 taining that Norwegian complaints over Soviet activities were groundless
 and that Zhuk's activities violated neither international law nor diplo-
 matic status; the Soviet note also expressed the hope that the Norwegian
 government would try to end the "press campaign" on the case, which was
 "damaging Norwegian-Soviet relations."  To Norwegians, it seemed that the
 Soviet note of 21 July was an insult to their system of justice, and a
 demand that '.their press be muzzled.   (See Press Comment, 5 August 1965)
 The Soviets may have been encouraged in their brazen attitude by
 the tactfulness of the Norwegian government.  Norse authorities did not
 officially name the USSR in their December 1964 announcement of Gj$en's
 arrest, and later on, authorized accounts of the trial disclosed only
 Col. Zhuk's involvement, and not that of Lt. Col. Yevdokimov.  The pub-
 lished record of the case (see Press Comment, Special Issue, July 1965)
 released on 21 June 1965 made it appear that Gj$en's second conversation
 at the Soviet Embassy (19 October 1964) was, like the first, with Col.
 Zhuk.  Yevdokimov's role emerged in public only after press leakages on
 9 July.1965.   (See Press Comment, 26 and 27 July 1965)    Zhuk had returned

 COMMUNISM TODAY: A Refresher Course
 U NDERGROUND and in open combat, by subversion,
 terrorism, blackmail, riot and rhetoric, faithful Com-
 munists the world over have for decades waged a holy war
 against the rest of humanity. The tempo and techniques vary
 from era to era, from continent to continent. And the nature
 of Communism changes, Whereas Moscow now shuns the
 perilous confrontations that so often brought the cold war
 to boiling point, Peking grows ever more militant. For both
 capitals of world Communism, the focal points of conflict
 have shifted from Europe to Africa, Latin America and-
 most notably-Southeast Asia, where the Johnson Admin-
 istration last week solemnly committed the U.S. to what
 could be a prolonged and painful war.
 Thus the Marxist dream of world domination is palpably
 no McCarthyist mirage. From Indonesia, where govern-
 ment-sanctioned mobs howled for the ouster of a newly
 arrived U.S. ambassador, to Cuba, where Fidel Castro pro-
 claimed that "the imperialists" will not prevent Red regimes
 from taking over throughout the hemisphere, it was also
 becoming clear last week that the U.S. would have to stand
 increasingly alone against the free world's enemies.
 Nonetheless, to a world grown weary of cold-war ful-
 mination, the thunder out of Hanoi or Havana often has a
 curiously chimerical ring; the Iron Curtain itself seems less
 an instrument of terror and repression than a gigantic cob-
 web of cliche. Particularly to the generation that has reached
 voting (or at least debating) age since the early coups and
 crises of the postwar era, the sounds of struggle appear al-
 most as irrelevant and unreal as fragments of a horror tale
 recollected from childhood. Many of their elders see Com-
 munism in the confused, self-doubting terms that have char-
 acterized the. recent wave of academic protest over Viet
 Nam and Santo Domingo. "Is it up to us to say who is
 a Communist and who is not?" asks Anatol Rapoport, 54,
 of the University of Michigan, a leading organizer of teach-
 ins. Shrugging off the Red infiltrators in Santo Domingo, a
 Stanford professor of Latin American history allows: "You
 can find 58 Communists in New York, or San Francisco, or
 anywhere." Political Scientist Stanley Millet, 48, formerly
 of Briarcliff College, goes so far as to argue that "terror on
 our side accounts for all that has happened in Viet Nam."
 Since the U.S.-Soviet detente that developed after the
 1962 Cuban missile crisis, more venerable and more qual-
 ified commentators also have begun to sound as if Com-
 munism had quietly buried itself. Not long ago, the Man-
 chester Guardian pronounced: "The Russians and the Ameri-
 cans no longer have any reason to quarrel." And there is
 a widespread school of chop logic that maintains simul-
 taneously: 1) Russia can no longer be seriously regarded as
 a threat to the West, and 2) by its firm stand in Southeast
 Asia, the U.S. is inviting Russian retaliation: Both premises
 are debatable at best; together, they are not an argument
 but a plea for passivity. The danger of such wishful think-
 ing, as the State Department's Walt Rostow has warned, is
 that "but of a false sense that the cold war is coming to an
 end, out of boredom or domestic preoccupations, or a de-
 sire to get on with purely national objectives, we will open
 up new opportunities for the Communists to advance."
 The Polycentric Era
 Communism ? has itself made wrenching readjustments.
 One of the more striking has been the post-Stalin push for
 respectability. True; the spectacle of Khrushchev banging
 a shoe at the U.N. did little to convince the world that
 Kremlinologist Christian Duvael diagnoses as "the fatigue
 of ideology" in the Soviet bloc. As Marxism proved less and
 less relevant to the economic and social problems of con-
 temporary society, Soviet ideologues came to realize that
 they could no longer be solved in class-war terms. As the
 old terror abates but never entirely vanishes, as the old
 dogmas die but.never get burled, Intellectuals In Russia and
 Eastern Europe increasingly feel as "alienated" from their
 own societies as some of their Western counterparts. When
 British Poet Stephen Spender recently told a gathering of
 Polish writers that what he wanted to see most of all was
 a Communist, a voice from the back of the hall called out:
 "You have come too late for that." Soviet-bloc Commu-
 nism has *become a weird conglomeration of Marxist rem-
 nants, state socialism with tentative injections of free enter-
 prise, and above all, nationalism. In today's polycentric
 Eastern Europe, once tightly controlled satellites have devel-
 oped what De Gaulle might call a Communisme des patries.
 All this has only exacerbated Sino-Soviet antagonisms.
 Red China's'rulers, fiercely determined to preserve ideologi-
 cal': purity against Muscovite "revisionism," are bound to re-
 main cruel and, spartan. Contemptuous of Soviet policies,
 obdurate in its distrust of anything resembling capitalist
 methods, insistent on violence, China is irreversibly commit-
 ted to the notion of central direction for the whole Commu-
 nist movement-as long as'Peking can do the directing.
 The Fronts
 Obviously, it would be foolish for the West to pretend that
 Communism in 1965 is the same monolithic menace it once
 was; but it is equally nonsensical to regard Communism as a
 legitimate or benign form of government, or to suggest, as
 the London Times did recently, that Marxism may have
 "ceased to be an organized international movement."
 Communism may no longer have a single line or direction,
 but it remains highly organized, aggressively international,
 and more intensely competitive than ever as a result of Sino-
 Soviet rivalry. Though the Cominform (successor to the
 Comintern) was dissolved in 1956, control over the world-
 wide Communist movement is still vested in special depart-
 ments of the Soviet and Chinese Central Committees. Of
 the world's 105 Communist Parties, Moscow can count on
 72, as against 21 for Peking. Twelve other Communist
 Parties-mostly in Western Europe-are vaguely independ-
 ent. In 1964, foreign aid by Communist countries. amounted
 to $1.7 billion, of which Soviet funds accounted for half,
 Eastern European funds for a quarter. Of 17,530 Commu-
 nist technicians working in foreign countries-a skarp rise
 from the preceding year-only 15% were Chinese.
 One of the most effective instruments of Communist sub-
 version remains the front organization. In McCarthy's hey-
 day Communist terminology was tossed about too carelessly,
 and in many quarters today words and realities such as
 "infiltration" no longer seem entirely credible. Yet the lead-
 ing fronts still reflect the reality and breadth of the Com-
 munist subversive effort. They range from pacifist groups
 such as the World Peace Council (headquartered in Prague)
 and the International Institute of Peace (Vienna) to various
 youth and professional outfits such as the International
 Union of Students and the International Association of
 Democratic Lawyers (Prague and Brussels). Most of these
 organizations-many launched by non-Communists with the
 best intentions and then taken over-are dominated by
 Soviet-line Communism, although the Chinese are fighting
 hard to capture them and are setting up rival fronts of their

 A far more significant development is what Munich     failing in others, but always at work.
 By all odds, the threat is most serious in Asia, where Coin-
 munism-predominantly Chinese Communism--exploits the
 vast turmoil of social disorder and political-economic dis-
 content. Peking has chosen as its chief weapon "the war of
 national liberation," an export version of the Chinese Com-
 munist revolution, which is based on the theory that through
 interminable guerrilla war a weaker force can wear out and
 finally overcome a stronger one. The Chinese work through
 nominally independent "nationalist" organizations such as
 the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front. It makes
 no difference to Peking if such fronts contain many non-
 Communists; as in North Viet Nam when the French were
 forced out, Communists can always take over. As Yugo-
 slavia's Tito has expressed it: "The Chinese will fight to the
 last North Vietnamese."
 Peking also uses the "united front" stratagem elsewhere.
 Most effective example is in Indonesia, where the 2,000,000-
 member Partai Kontuuis Indonesia, the third largest Com-
 munist Party in the world (after China and Russia), domi-
 nates the streets and, through the streets, President Sukarno.
 Pro-Peking Communists also work hand in hand with Singa-
 pore's Barisan Socialist Party, have long since captured
 Japan's 10 million-member Gensuikyo, its Council Against
 Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs (which nonetheless lost con-
 siderable support with the advent of Red China as a nuclear
 power). Though India's 160,000-member Communist Party
 is split down the middle, the pro-Chinese wing holds the
 psychological whip hand, having won 40 seats in this year's
 Kerala state election to only three for the Muscovite wing.
 The victory was doubly impressive, since there has been
 virulent anti-Chinese feeling in India since the 1962 invasion.
 The Chinese are currently laying the foundations of in-
 surgency in northeast Thailand. Among primitive hill tribes
 such as the Lahu, Peking has sent native cadres trained in
 China to spread the word of a new messiah. One savior is
 already at work among the Lahu, claiming to possess a
 "magic hammer, magic rope and magic knife" with which
 he can kill all enemies, even if they number "as many as
 the sesame seeds in three baskets." Peking's most formidable
 source of subversion is the 15 million "overseas" Chinese,
 who dominate much of the trade and commerce of non-
 Communist Asia. In Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, the Philip-
 pines and Burma, their hsiao-tzu (literally, "little groups"),
 of three to 22 members, perform subversive chores wher-
 ever possible.
 Everywhere, Red China cynically exploits racism to the
 detriment not only of the Western powers, but also of the
 Russians, who are. increasingly on the defensive in Asia.
 But racial feeling also works against China, for many Asians
 have a centuries-old fear of the Chinese and it is at ]east
 as strong as their anti-white prejudice. The greatest threat
 Peking holds over its Asian neighbors is its army-2,500,001)
 infantrymen, a 12-million-man militia-which could inun-
 date the continent if all its subversive stratagems should fail.
 That is why Viet Nam is the ultimate test of Peking's poli-
 cies: if the U.S. backed away from the threat of Chinese
 intervention, it would lend powerful support to the untested
 notion that China is invincible.

 Latin America: Hiding Behind Ideologies
 With the exception of Cuba, no Communist Party in
 Central or South America holds power, but all are well
 prepared to manipulate perpetual popular discontent. Cas-
 tro's Cuba is the prototype, the precedent, and to a large
 extent the preceptor of incipient Communist revolutions in
 the hemisphere. Since 1960, Castro has trained guerrillas
 from most Latin countries, including Colombia, Haiti, Vene-
 zuela and the Dominican Republic. Propaganda and arms

 idealistic leader, Juan Bosch. Much the same technique was
 employed a year ago in Panama and in Goulart's Brazil
 (1961-64), and in both countries it proved unsuccessful.
 Nonetheless, in Panama and the Dominican Republic, the
 Reds achieved a secondary objective, that of forcing the
 U.S. to intervene in a conflict that to the gullible could be
 made to resemble a valid internal revolution.
 Africa: Money & Arms
 "Revolution-the witch doctor in tiger skins," wrote a
 Polish poet in praise of the Congo rebellion. In fact, Red
 witchcraft is doing poorly in Africa. The only African coun-
 try under outright Communist domination is the former
 colony of Congo-Brazzaville. Through hamhanded diplo-
 macy. and sloppy technology, the Russians alienated two of
 their likeliest converts, Guinea's Sekou Toure and Ghana's
 Kwame Nkrumah. China, usually more subtle in its subver-
 sive techniques, has also managed to stomp on African toes.
 Peking's men in Burundi were thrown out early this year
 after a Chinese subversion campaign that was climaxed by
 the assassination of Moderate Premier Pierre Ngendan-
 dumwe. During a recent visit to Tanzania, Chou En-lai
 ineptly pronounced Africa today was "exceedingly favor-
 able" for revolution-which to incensed African leaders
 suggested that Peking was plotting their own downfall.
 Russia and China both had to write off major investments
 in Algeria's Ahmed ben Bella, who managed to woo Mos-
 cow and Peking simultaneously before his precipitate ouster
 last June. Still; as the Russians proved when they sent arms
 to the Congo rebels, both Moscow and Peking continually
 attempt to influence students, intellectuals, officials.
 Europe: A Problem of Prosperity
 Except for the U.S., where Communism can claim only
 10,000 party members, the Red cause has probably fared
 worst in Western Europe. Nonetheless, with a quarter of a
 million members, the French Communist Party pulls fully
 20% of the vote, ranks as the second biggest political force
 in the nation (only De Gaulle stands taller). Italy's 1,5 mil-
 lion Communists have gradually increased their share of
 the vote until it stands at 25%. Many such Communist votes
 amount to a ritualistic protest by citizens who simply
 oppose the existing order. Yet through sheer numbers, the
 national parties today exercise a potent veto power on Mos-
 cow's line.
 The U.S. in the past decade has become far more sophis-
 ticated about Communism, moving from frightened hostility
 to eagerly sought contacts ranging from the test ban treaty
 to trade. Washington has abandoned dreams of "rolling
 back" the Reds-and has learned in the process that Com-
 munists can fear coexistence more than the West.
 For its party Soviet Communism in the 1960s has mel-
 lowed considerably as its leaders have discovered that
 goulash is more palatable than gunpowder. Under Khru-
 shchev and his successors, Premier Aleksei Kosygin and
 Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev, the old, unbending creed of
 unconditional war against capitalism has yielded to the
 cautious dialogue of coexistence. It has had to, for the
 workers of the industrialized world today are not likely to
 be inveigled into violent assault on social systems that have
 given them so large a measure of prosperity.
 As for hungry, underdeveloped Red China, the uncom-
 promising letter and spirit of crusading Leninism dovetail
 neatly with economic necessity and Peking's dreams of re-
 asserting its ancient hegemony over Asia. The threat to
 peace lies between the extremes, between Russia's evolu-
 tionary progress and China's hard adherence to a fundamen-
 talist philosophy. In the struggle for power and legitimacy
 throughout the Communist world, Moscow and Peking could
