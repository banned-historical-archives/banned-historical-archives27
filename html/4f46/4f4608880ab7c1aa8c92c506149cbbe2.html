 DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDED MISSILE TECHNOLOGY REVIEWED
 Technology Advances
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 26 Sep 79 p 2
 [Article by a certain testing base of the National Defense Scientific and
 Technological Commission:  "Maintain Independence and Keep the Initiative
 in Our Own Hands To Win Victory in the Development of Our Most Advanced
 National Defense Sciences"]
 [Text]   The guided missiles are standing straight looking toward the skies,
 and the satellites are glittering in circling the earth.  On the occasion
 of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic
 of China, we are boundlessly happy to review the development of the most
 advanced national defense sciences.
 After the birth of the great People's Republic, Chairman Mao and the party
 Central Committee, with foresight, issued the call for developing atomic
 bombs, guided missiles and earth satellites in China.  In the past more
 than 20 years, we have continually developed our most advanced national
 defense sciences, transforming our PLA from an army relying on millet and
 rifles to a strong People's Armed Forces equipped with such modern and
 advanced weapons as guided missiles and nuclear weapons, thereby breaking
 the nuclear blackmail and monopoly of the super powers.
 Each and every page of the history of the development of guided missiles
 in China is fraught with the glory of maintaining independence and keeping
 the initiative in our hands in developing our most advanced national defense
 sciences.  A little over 20 years ago, a contingent of men composed of
 cadres and fighters who had just dusted themselves clean'from the Resist-
 American Aid-Korea War and scientists and engineers from the various localities
 marched in high spirit into the Gobi Desert in northwest China to start the
 construction of our first guided-missile testing site, thus unveiling the
 guided-missile program in China.  At that time, our motherland had just been
 saved from the ravages of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic imperialism.
 It was characterized by its poverty-stricken conditions, lack of basic
 technical knowledge, and backwardness in its scientific research equipment.
 Under such difficult conditions, every member of the contingent pledged to

 quickly establish the first guided-missile testing base and achieve success
 in the development of guided missiles in China.  Braving the harshness of the
 Gobi Desert, the cadres and fighters of the PLA and the engineers and
 technicians painstakingly studied scientific and cultural knowledge to raise
 their scientific and technological levels, adhering to the policy of engaging
 in building, training and testing simultaneously.  In less than 2 years,
 they carried out the first guided-missile launching test.
 At this very juncture as preparations for carrying out the first guided-missile
 launching test were being made with great efforts, the treacherous Soviet
 revisionist clique unilaterally tore up its agreements and withdrew its
 experts in a vain attempt to strangle and disarm us.  But the Chinese people
 would not be intimidated or crushed.  In response to the call of the party
 Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the broad masses of commanders and fighters
 of the PLA and the engineers and technicians bravely broke through foreign
 conventionality and their reliance on foreign help to step onto the road of
 developing independently the most advanced national defense sciences and
 technology.  They were confident that they could achieve the same successes as
 others.  Having no advanced equipment, they would adopt native methods to
 build it, carrying out research and testing in tents and assembling advanced
 equipment in garages.  Having no electronic computers, nor electric computers,
 they would rely on manual computers, working 24 hours a day.  Pooling their
 efforts in close coordination and.-with active assistance from the PLA and
 outside quarters, they worked in the manner described in the poem, "Carry
 out the tests in such coordination as playing a chess game, Move each pawn
 with the overall situation in mind, Make great efforts to conduct the tests,
 and March in step to win'victory."  In 20 days after the Soviet revisionist
 clique had withdrawn its experts, they successfully launched the first Chinese
 guided missile under difficult conditions.  The deafening roar of the soaring
 missile pronounced the bankruptcy of the Soviet social-imperialist plot to
 blockade us and turned the first page in the history of the development of
 guided missiles in China.
 In October 1966, soon after the first guided-missile test, China successfully
 carried out a nuclear weapon test with a guided missile.  The nuclear warhead
 hit its target with great precision, triggering a nuclear explosion.  In
 April 1970, China successfully launched its first earth satellite which
 played loudly and clearly the "East Is Red,"song in outer space, marking the
 entry of China into a new scientific and technological era.  In October 1975,
 an earth satellite launched by China returned to earth according to schedule
 after completing its normal functions, thus pushing China's outer space
 technology to a new era....  In the past 2 decades, China has developed at
 great speed its most advanced national defense sciences and technology,
 contributing to the modernization of its national defense sciences and technology.
 In the development of the most advanced national defense sciences and technology,
 the cadres and fighters of the PLA and the scientists and technicians at the
 testing base came forward with many epic and heroic deeds; they feared neither
 hardship nor death, and cared about neither fame nor gain.  In carrying out
 the launching tests, at times there were many risks to be taken.  In the face

 of such hazards, the commanders and fighters of the PLA would invariably say,
 "We are willing to sacrifice everything for the development of most advanced
 national defense program."  On the occasion of launching the first guided-
 missile nuclear weapon, fighter Tian Xiankun [3944 3907 0981] of the
 launching brigade was assigned to connect the nuclear warhead, and put the
 finishing touch on the ignition system.  Taking off his leather jacket and
 braving the severe cold weather, he worked for 80 minutes in a narrow space
 between the warhead and the guided missile in precise fashion performing
 almost 100 steps to complete the connection between the two.  At the point
 where he was to connect a certain plug, all personnel not involved in this
 job were evacuated from the launching site and took cover.  Showing no
 nervousness, Tian Xiankun firmly, safely and unmistakenly connected the
 ignition system of the nuclear warhead to the power source to put the
 nuclear warhead in readiness for ignition, thus fulfilling his duty with
 flying colors.   It was on account of such common yet great fighters, scientists
 and technicians that China has achieved one great success after another in
 developing its most advanced national defense sciences.
 While achieving great successes in the development of the most advanced
 national defense sciences and technology, the commanders and fighters of the
 PLA and the scientists and technicians at the testing base also achieved
 great successes in fighting against adverse natural environments.
 In the past 2 decades or more, to lighten the burden of the people and with
 a heroic spirit to conquer nature, the broad masses of the commanders and
 fighters of the PLA and the scientists and technicians succeeded in raising
 food crops and vegetables in the Gobi Desert.  To obtain water, they sank
 deep wells and built reservoirs.  To ward off sandstorms, they built
 windbreaker after windbreaker with red willow branches and adobes.  In this
 way, relying on their industrious hands they gradually changed the bleak
 look of the Gobi Desert which was best described by the poem "A place where
 the wind drives stones to roll, where no grass will grow, where the crops
 cannot take root, and where even the wild geese avoid."  Today, the desert
 has large areas of foliage, 10,000 mu of good farmland, wheatfields with
 billowing waves of'wheat, and vegetable gardens in erstwhile alkaline swamps.
 In the wild desert, there are now spacious airports, rotating radar antennae,
 neat rows of barracks, and guided-missile testing bases at advanced levels.
 Following the development of our advanced national defense sciences, group
 after group of scientists and technicians, both Red and expert, have matured.
 Many PLA veterans who fought both in the north and in the south have become
 leading cadres with rich command experience, and engaged in painstaking study
 of science and technology to master their jobs in the scientific tests.  In
 the meantime, a large number of Red and expert scientists and technicians
 noted for their rich experiences and theoretical knowledge have been brought
 up through strict training according to strict standards, making preparations
 for the tests, rehearsing the launching of missiles, and promoting pace-
 setters.  Today, such leading cadres, scientists and technicians are distributed

 throughout the whole country to become the backbone personnel in pushing
 forward the development of the most advanced national defense sciences in
 China.
 Reviewing the past, we are deeply touched by our hard experiences.  Looking
 forward, we are full of ambition.  Under the leadership of the party Central
 Committee headed by Chairman Hua, we shall most assuredly be able to
 develop our most advanced national defense sciences at even greater speed
 and with even more spectacular achievements in the new Long March, thereby
 turning new pages in our history.

 [Newsletter:   "Be So Safe and Reliable That There Is no Room for Failure"]
 [Text]  This is a guided-missile launching test of great importance.  In the
 control room, the operators are watching their assigned meters with great
 concentration of mind.  All the people are holding their breath, so much so
 that the room seems strangely quiet.
 When two green signal flares sweep across the darkness in the skies, the
 commander barks, "Fire!"  Within the twinkle of an eye, an operator quickly
 and correctly pushes the ignition button.  A thundering roar rocks the earth.
 It is followed by a lightning bright torch rising skyward.  The guided missile
 soars like a roaring dragon into the skies and hits its target with great
 precision.
 This launching is conducted by the second guided-missiles launching brigade of
 a certain department of the National Defense Scientific and Technological
 Commission.   It is one of the first guided-missile launching brigades organized
 by the PLA.   In the past 2 decades, acting on Premier Zhou's instructions,
 "Be serious, conscientious, meticulous, cautious and be so safe and, reliable.
 that there is no room for a failure," the cadres and fighters have launched
 guided missiles and satellites on several dozen occasions, satisfactorily
 fulfilling their assignments each time.  They have contributed much to the
 initiation and development of the guided missiles and satellites in. China.
 The comrades of the second brigade are fully aware that their assignments are
 so important and glorious that their fulfillment will affect the development
 of scientific research and the realization of the four modernizations of their
 motherland.  The commanders and fighters remark, "We are entrusted by the
 people of the whole country, and we must be responsible for them."  In their
 launching tests in past years, all the cadres and fighters have assumed command
 and carried out work with total devotion.  They have been serious and
 conscientious in turning each switch, placing each plug, pushing each button,
 and examining each development, and not allowing.a single uncertainty or
 any potential trouble to escape their observation and correction.   On the
 occasion of launching the "East Is Red" satellite, the meters team discovered

 that among the approximately 100 apparatuses and parts in the apparatus
 cabinet there was one percussion cap which had no aperture for the safety
 pin.  Adhering to the policy "be so safe and reliable that there is no
 room for a failure," members of the team spent half a day carefully drilling
 with a tiny drill an aperture even smaller than the stem of a match, making
 it possible for them to insert a safety pin.  Further, they used a band-aid
 to pick up all the foreign matter within the apparatus cabinet, such as bits
 of wire and welding tin, so that there would be no possible potential trouble
 in the guided missile or satellite after launching.
 In the past 2 decades, the second launching brigade has fulfilled its guided-
 missile and satellite launching assignments with flying colors on many
 occasions, earning for it a collective Order of Merit, First Class, one
 Second Class and one Third Class.  In addition, many of its subteams, shifts
 and member have been awarded with Orders of Merit.  Chairman Mao and Chairman Hua
 have personally received a representative of the brigade.   In the new Long March
 toward the realization of the four modernizations, the commanders and fighters
 are determined to carry forward their successes and make even greater contribu-
 tions with wholehearted enthusiasm and in the most realistic spirit to the
 national defense scientific research program.

 FACTORS IN HIGH-SPEED DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS RELATED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 26 Sep 79 p 2
 [A talk on Chinese nuclear tests:  "The High Aspirations Shake the Skies"]
 [Text]  Political Officer:  Our company is carrying out activities to praise
 our great motherland in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding
 of the New China.  Staff Officer Zhang, will you please give us a talk on
 the great successes we have achieved in our nuclear tests in China?
 Staff Officer Zhang:  All right.  We started to develop our most advanced
 national defense sciences and technology in the mid-1950's.  Under the
 leadership of the CCP Central Committee and with the personal concern and
 care of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, Chairman Zhu and some other proletarian
 revolutionaries of the older generation, maintaining independence and
 keeping the initiative in our own hands and relying on our own efforts,
 we have carried out a hard struggle for over 2 decades to build and develop
 from scratch a sizable scientific research and technological force with
 great success.
 In the past 2 decades or more, we have carried out necessary and limited
 nuclear tests.  The rate of our successes and the speed of our development
 surpassed many of the advanced countries in the world.  From October 1964
 when we successfully exploded our first atom bomb to June 1967 when we ex-
 ploded our first hydrogen bomb was a period of only 2 years and 8 months.
 This progress was much faster than the United States and the Soviet Union.
 In October 1966, we carried out successfully a guided missile nuclear weapon
 test on Chinese soil.  These great successes in our nuclear tests have con-
 tributed to the work of breaking the nuclear monopoly of the superpowers and
 to the defense of world peace.
 Political Officer:   I remember that Chairman Mao said in 1958, "I can see
 that in about 10 years it is entirely possible for us to build our own
 atomic and hydrogen bombs."  Just as predicted by Chairman Mao, China
 has succeeded in testing its atomic and hydrogen bombs, and has done so with
 such startling speed.  It is truly exciting.  Staff Officer Zhang, can you
 tell us why we have been able to develop our nuclear tests at such a high speed?

 Zhang:   There are many factors contributing to the high-speed development of
 our nuclear tests.  What I would like to mention particularly is that at a
 time when we were under the oppression of imperialism and reactionarism of
 the various nations and under the blockade of social-imperialism, our scientists,
 engineers, technicians, workers, PLA commanders and fighters, revolutionary
 cadres and the broad masses of militiamen participating in-the research,
 production and testing of nuclear weapons displayed a bravery against the
 ghosts, the devils, the oppression and the pressure, to bring their socialist
 enthusiasm and creativeness into full play, fearing no risks and obstacles,
 daring to scale heights, overcoming hardship, and making positive efforts
 in their work.  This was one of the most important factors contributing to
 the high-speed development of our nuclear tests.
 Political Officer:   Staff Officer Zhang, can you tell us some concrete
 advanced experiences?  For instance, the sample-collecting team of the
 seventh office of the research institute to which you belong has on many
 occasions participated in nuclear tests to contribute to the defense of our
 motherland, and won the title "Advanced Scientific and Technological Collective
 Pace-Setter."  We would be very pleased to hear the advanced experiences of
 the sample-collecting team in fulfilling their sample-collecting tasks with
 flying colors.
 Zhang:  All right, I would like to report to you comrades on our work.  The
 job to be done by my sample-collecting team was to collect samples from the
 clouds of nuclear explosions in the air or from the air space of underground
 caves where a nuclear device had exploded.  The samples would be used for
 radioactive chemical and physical analyses to determine the power and other
 functions of the nuclear weapon: concerned, so that it. can be improved and so
 that a study of its destructive power could facilitate the adoption of effec-
 tive defensive measures against it.
 Political Officer:  Oh.   The samples could mean so much.   It was truly important
 to collect them.  It must be very difficult to collect them in the air above
 and in the cavity underground after a nuclear explosion.
 Zhang:  Yes.  You must know that to collect samples in the cloud of a nuclear
 explosion, it was necessary to speed into the explosion center immediately
 following the explosion.  This was a dangerous, onerous and yet very glorious
 task.   Everyone of us was aware that the degree of success of our sample-
 collecting work would affect the development of our nuclear weapons and
 the improvement of our national defense as a whole.  The preparations for the
 first nuclear test were carried out in a hot summer.  To fulfill the task of
 sample-collection, it was necessary for.us to rush about on the Gobi Desert
 under the sun, enduring the high temperature of over 50?C and wearing
 protective clothes and masks.  Each drill would last for over 4 hours.  On.
 the occasion of the first drill, some of the comrades passed out in the 1st hour,
 due to profuse perspiration.  You comrades must have seen in the motion
 picture that after one drill, each participant would empty several catties
 of perspiration from his boots.  In winter when the temperature was as low as
 over 20 degrees below zero, we had also to rush upward or downward on mountains.

 Sandstorms on the Gobi Desert were another problem.  During a sandstorm,
 the sky was so darkened by sand that it was impossible to see the road in the
 daytime even with headlights.      Even so, to develop our nuclear tests, all
 participants were full of confidence and in high spirits.  Some of the
 comrades humorously remarked, "The Gobi Desert is so good, that it can both
 build up our will power and facilitate our :tests.  A darling place, indeed!"
 Many difficulties were brought about by the natural conditions.
 Political Officer:  Were there difficulties other than the natural conditions?
 Zhang:  We thought nothing of the hardship and hard work.   The greatest
 difficulty was that of knowledge.  None of us members of the sample-collecting
 team had any knowledge about sample-collection or had any experience in this
 field.  Without any experience and data, we had to rely on ourselves to study
 and grope in the dark.  We, the Chinese nation, is noted for its ambition
 and ability to stand among all nations in the world.  We must have what others
 have, and create what others do not have.  In the past 2 decades or more,
 in the spirit of catching up with and surpassing advanced world levels,
 we members of the sample-collecting team have made great efforts to master
 all the knowledge needed in our work and the technology concerning sample-
 collection.  This required to some degree even stronger fortitude, confidence
 and resolution.  Thanks to the continual efforts of all comrades of the team,
 we have not only fulfilled our anticipated tasks with satisfaction in every
 nuclear test by collecting abundant samples of all categories to satisfy the
 needs for radioactive chemical analyses and the study of the nuclear cloud
 parameters, but also summed up and created our own methods in collecting
 nuclear cloud samples.
 Political Officer:   It is great for the sample-collecting comrades to devote
 themselves so wholeheartedly to the most advanced.national defense science
 research work, fearing no hardship and danger and overcoming all difficulties
 in advancing the interests of our national defense and the four modernizations.
 We must emulate this spirit and apply it to our work in order to do better.
 .Zhang:  What we have done still falls short of the demands of the party and
 the people.  We are determined to go all out in our efforts to do a. good job
 in sample-collection in new nuclear tests.
 The sample-collecting team has played only a very small part in the nuclear
 tests.   There are numerous other heroes at the nuclear test sites doing
 the same type of work "aiming neither at fame nor personal gain, but only
 at bringing greatness to our motherland."  It is precisely because of such
 unknown heroes that China has succeeded in scaling one height after another
 in advancing its most advanced national defense sciences and technology.
 Political Officer:  You have delivered a very good speech.  It is a good
 lecture to us in our activities to praise the great motherland.  Thank you.

 EXHIBIT SHOWS SUCCESS OF MILITARY-CIVILIAN COOPERATION
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 26 Sep 79 p 2
 [Newsletter by Liao Junguang [1394 0193 0342]:   "Cooperation Between Military
 and Civilian Units Enables China To Fly 10,000 Li High Like a Roc"]
 [Text]  It is a typical autumn day, sharp, bright and no rain.  We are happy
 to visit the civil products fair being held in Beijing under the sponsorship
 of a certain national defense scientific research unit.
 At the entrance of the exhibition hall, there is a tall, solid screen dis-
 playing a large picture of the Great Wall, glittering magnificently in its
 full glory, signifying the invincibility of China with miltary-civilian
 cooperation.  It can easily be seen that this screen is set up there by the
 fair to impress visitors with its obsession that the military and civilians
 should cooperate more closely to speed up the socialist construction of China.
 In the exhibition hall, there are thousands of attractive items on exhibition.
 It shows the results of the policy of military-civilian cooperation adopted
 by the national defense scientific research unit.  It constitutes a vivid
 report to the people of the capital by the national defense scientific research
 and military industrial units which have lent positive support to socialist
 construction.  Behold, at this corner there are eye-catching precision
 meters and apparatuses, bearing colorful and blinking indicator lights.  They
 are ready to storm the  targets of the four modernizations at the issuance
 of a single command.  At that corner is a magnetoelectric automatic measuring
 device produced not long ago by a certain measurement station through scientific
 research.  Attached to a balance for measuring weights from 5,000 to 10,000 kg,
 it can tell the correct measurement in a few seconds or a little over 10 seconds
 with the degree of precision of 1,1000,000.  It is up to the world advanced
 level, and fills up a gap formerly existing in the measuring devices in China.
 What is this picture which attracts so much attention from the visitors?   It is
 the picture of a 10-ton oscillator.  In the course of designing and after a
 prototype is completed, much new equipment and apparatus needs to go through
 a process of oscillation to find out its design parameter and its functions.
 An oscillator is one of the most important pieces of equipment to carry out

 these oscillation tests.  In the past, no foreign country would sell us an
 oscillator with a capacity above 1 ton.  But relying on its own resources and
 efforts, an institute in China has succeeded in building not only oscillators
 with 1-ton capacity, but also super oscillators with 10-ton capacity.
 The fair also shows to visitors the great prospect of the active participation
 in and support for socialist construction by the national defense scientific
 research and military industrial units.  On exhibition are selected military
 items for civil use, excellent products which were studied, designed and
 produced in cooperation with civil products production units, new civil products
 resulting from the full utilization of military scientific research, special
 tools made of new materials capable of withstanding low temperature, high
 temperature, corrosion and abrasion such as cutting blades and drill bits,
 advanced precision meters and apparatuses, and heavy machines for use by
 industrial and mining enterprises.  They are as varied in category as they
 are colorful.  Behold, a torch equipped with a high speed, high quality precision
 metal cutting nozzle can cut through 'a 1-meter thick steel ingot as easily as
 if it was made of butter.  Also on exhibition is.a type of high quality lubricant
 which may be used in the processing of machine parts, making them shiny, rust
 free, easy to clean, odorless and more inexpensive.  Who could have thought that
 such precious lubrication oil was produced by scientists and workers through
 the application of certain chemicals to the pulp foam obtained from paper mills?
 A picture of a bread oven is on exhibition.  A technician tells us, "this bread
 oven is made through the application of more advanced technology:  the bread
 is heated by infrared radiation according to a new technology so that the
 temperature rises more quickly and less electricity is consumed; it is operated
 more easily through the application of an electromagnetic controlling system;
 it is superior in heat preservation due to the adoption of a new type of
 insulation material; and it is cleaner inside.  The bread is made in a totally
 mechanized fashion, including. mixing, kneading, cutting, shaping, conveying and
 baking, producing more than 620 catties of delicious and soft bread an hour."
 There are on exhibition an automatic tablets-counting and sacking machine,
 a shiny metal artificial pelvic joint, and a high-class artificial valvula.
 All the colorful items show not only the highly developed sciences and
 technology and the superior craftsmanship of our national defense scientific
 research and military industrial units, but also the spirit of the personnel
 of the national defense scientific research and military industrial units who
 are devoted to the interests and welfare of the people.
 The last items on exhibition are not products, but a list of the items designed
 and processed for, or in cooperation with, other fraternal units.  "Are you
 in need of precision machines, apparatuses or meters?  Sign contracts with us.
 We will design and trial produce them for you, through the application of our
 new technology.   Do you need to carry out tests, build equipment and produce
 machine parts?   Bring your blueprints and supplies to us for processing.  We
 shall open more avenues for you."  These are not items on exhibition.  Yet, they
 are like flower buds ready to yield intoxicating fragrance, delicious honey and
 abundant fruit.   Looking ahead, we can visualize a bumper harvest.

 and the fluttering of the colorful streamers.  We sincerely wish that more
 products and more wealth be produced by our national defense scientific

 DESERT STATION PERFORMS AS LINK IN MISSILE TESTS
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 26 Sep 79 p 2
 [Newsletter: "The Red Willows on Gobi Desert Are Greener Than Ever"]
 [Text]  Our automobile is speeding at the rate of 70 km an hour on the
 Gobi Desert toward Station No 19, a flash ranging station deep in the
 Gobi Desert.
 "Here we are, where there are trees is the place."  Looking straight ahead,
 doggone it, at the horizon of the yellow sea of sand we can see patches of
 green.  When we reach it, we are even more surprised.  How come in this
 wild desert there can be such a beautiful oasis with chripping streams,
 straight rows of trees, poplar-surrounded barracks, colums of red-tiled
 buildings in the camp, pigsties alive with bouncing pigs, and gardens
 abound with all types of vegetables....  A beautiful oasis indeed.
 Station No 19 was born in the late 1950's, at the same time as the birth
 of our guided-missile program.  At that time, about a dozen young people who
 were devoted to the most advanced national defense scientific research came
 to this place to settle down.   In this ocean of sand, there was no foliage,
 and not one cup of fresh water to be found.  In case of a sandstorm, the
 howling wind would sweep away the tents and bury the iron pots.  The pioneers
 of Station No 19 carried out a bitter struggle against Mother Nature.  They
 generated their own power and sank wells to get water.   They planted trees
 to tame the desert.  For the first time, several rows of poplar and several
 dozen apricot trees were raised.  The pioneers also cultivated gardens in the
 desert to plant cabbage, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and other vegetables.
 In this way, the comrades of Station No 19 took roots in the depth of the
 Gobi Desert in the same way as the red willows which abound in the desert.
 The duties of Station No 19 seem to be quite common at first glance.  Yet,
 they form an indispensable link in the guided-missile tests.  On the occasion
 of each test, from the 9th second to the 180th second of the launching of a
 guided-missile, the comrades of Station No 19 must use their optical apparatus
 to observe the guided-missile's locus of motion and any change in its flight
 to gain the necessary data for further study.  There are about 3 minutes

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100090001-8
 between the 9th and the 180th second.  To fulfill their duties properly within
 these 3 minutes, the fighters responsible for operating the theodolite for
 video recording and observation must undergo drills in hot summers as well as
 cold winters and with the exertion of hard labor.  These fighters remark,
 "ho not treat these 3 minutes lightly.  If the tasks to be fulfilled in these
 3 minutes are not carried out properly, all the hard labor of the whole team
 would lose its meaning and value."
 The Third Subteam is responsible for operating the diesel generator.  Comrades
 of that subteam are fully aware of the great responsibilities on their
 shoulders.  In the past 2 decades, they have participated in several dozen
 launching tests.  They have kept their generators in such good maintenance
 that not once did a test fail due to generator failure.  They have not lost
 or damaged any of the more  than 200 pieces of equipment.  In summer,
 although the engine room's temperature may go up to over 40 degrees centigrade,
 the engine room hands would stay at their assigned positions just the same.
 One may ask why the comrades of Station No 19 were so enthusiastic about their
 career and work.  It was because they are so devoted to the national defense
 scientific research work, that they are willing to sacrifice everything.
 Following the development of the national defense sciences, Station No 19
 will undergo big changes.  We sincerely believe that at the present and in the
 future, no matter how the personnel will change, the comrades of Station No 19
 will consistently devote all their wisdom, hearts and industrious labor to the
 development of the national defense scientific research work.

 FEATURES OF MILITIA TRAINING REFORM LISTED
 Guangzhou ZHANSHI BAO in Chinese 28 Dec 80 p 1
 [Article: "Substantial Reforms to be Made in Military Training of Militia in Order
 to Meet New Situations and New Circumstances Following Shift in Work Emphasis"]
 [Text]  Recently the Guangzhou Military Region General Headquarters issued, "Con-
 scientiously Implement the Notice from the General Staff, 'Views on Trial Implementa-
 tion of Readjustments and Reforms in the Military Training of Militia'," calling
 upon all units to diligently implement it.
 The correspondent has learned from the Guangzhou Military Region Training Conference
 that the program for reform of militia military training will be trial implemented
 during the 2 year period 1981-1982.  The main points of this reform are as follows:
 1.  Reduction in the scope of training and cutbacks in the number of people trained.
 Henceforth, training emphasis will be given to company and platoon commanders of
 armed militia, to troops in infantry fendui [platoon or squad size elements] sub-
 ordinate to armed regiments, special fendui, and anti-aircraft regiments.  Militia
 troops receiving training shall usually not be over 25 years of age.  2.  Shortening
 of the training cycle and improvement in training methods.  The training cycle will
 be reduced from the former 4 years. to 2 years.  Once qualified, armed militia troops
 need not participate further in training.  Subsequently, from 3 to 5 days refresher
 training may be organized once every 1 or 2 years.  Armed militia will have their
 training organized mostly by people's armed forces departments of plants, mines, and
 people's communes; company and platoon leaders of armed militia will have their
 training organized by people's armed forces departments of counties and municipali-
 ties.  3.  The streamlined training shall emphasize the essentials of training.
 The essentials of training for infantry fenduis subordinate to armed militia regi-
 ments are weapons firing, hand grenade throwing, individual soldier tactical train-
 ing, and a certain amount of earthworks preparation and guard duty.  After a good
 foundation has been lain, other pertinent training topics may be selected that are
 related to the enemy situation, terrain, and possible missions to be undertaken in
 time of war.  Armed militia company and platoon commanders will stress teaching
 methods and guidance training.  Following several group training sessions, those
 who meet requirements need no longer attend group training.  Special armed cadres
 will receive group training from training units in various sub-districts.  4.  Train-
 ing to enhance the special techniques of militia.
 The "Notice" required each provincial military district and the Hainan Military Dis-
 trict to take note of the realities in their own province and district, and following
 investigation and study to set up pilot programs, to summarize experiences, to organize
 implementation, and to make a success of the task of readjustment and reform of militia
 military training.

 GUANGZHOU MILITARY REGION CONFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS REPORTED
 Next Year's Army Training Tasks Cited
 Guangzhou ZHANSHI BAO in Chinese 31 Dec 80 p 1
 [Text]  The military training conference that began on 16 December concluded on 26
 December.
 This conference diligently studied the spirit of the armed forces academies' con-
 ference and the armed forces training conference, as well as the spirit of the
 ideological and political work symposium convened by the Ministry of Propaganda of
 the central government, analyzed this year's situation in the education and training
 of the armed forces, studied next year's arrangements for military training, poli-
 tical indoctrination, and scientific and cultural education, and discussed further
 measures for the enhancement and improvement of education and training.
 At the conclusion of the conference, the deputy commander of the military region,
 Jiang Xieyuan [3068 3610 0337] made a summarization, and the deputy director of the
 political committee, Gu Jingsheng j4474 2529 3932] made a report.  Military region
 organization leadership comrades Zhou Deli [0719 1795 4409], Huo Chengzhong 17202
 2052 1813], Zheng Bo [6774 3134], Wu Zishi [0702 1311 1395], and Zeng Xiang [2582
 3276] gave speeches or presented written statements at the conference.
 The conference noted that during 1980 the overall situation in training and in-
 doctrination in the military district had been good.  Nevertheless, numerous pro-
 blems still exist and there is still a long way to go in meeting actual combat
 requirements.  At the present time, the international situation has grown more tur-
 bulent and factors leading to war continue to increase. The political life of the
 party and of the country is in the midst of a turn of major historical significance.
 The military units in the military region are facing two different forms of trials
 and struggles from armed provocations by the reactionary Vietnamese authorities and
 the bourgeois wind from Hong King and Macao; consequently in placing indoctrination
 and training in a truly strategic position, it is necessary to have a unified per-
 ception and unified action.  In order to carry out the five requirements put forward
 by general headquarters for putting training in a strategic position, and to pro-
 ceed from the realities as they exist within the armed forces of the military region,
 it is necessary to accomplish the following:  1.  All echelons of CCP committees will
 treat training as an ordinary and routine central,-.task.  2.  They will establish
 systems of responsibility, take responsibility echelon by echelon, with one echelon
 giving attention to another echelon.  3.  They will oppose giving only vague direc-

 tions, advocate deep probing into situations, take action personally, and strictly
 attend to implementation.  4.  They will intensify ideological and political work in
 training.  5. They will adhere to the principal of thrift and hard work in the
 training of soldiers.
 The conference acknowledged that next year's political education and scientific and
 cultural education should be rooted in the guiding spirit of the General Political
 Department and in the realities of the forces in the military region, and stress
 placed upon attention to education in the party's line, programs and policies so
 that the forces will truly maintain a political oneness with the CCP Central Com-
 mittee.  Cadres will study basic theories in accordance with regulations.  Soldiers
 will study the political and economic portions of "General Political Knowledge."
 In addition, they will continue to give attention to education in the revolutionary
 view of life, engage in routine political ideology work, and launch a wide-ranging
 campaign of "striving to become an exemplary compulsory soldier."  Each unit will
 also  adapt general principles to specific situations to conduct education in ardent
 defense of the borders and protection of the borders, in special area policies, and
 against corrosive influences.  Scientific and cultural education of military forces
 will mostly use existing educational materials for orderly step by step general
 education in primary school and middle school mathematics, physics and chemistry.
 Every unit will take action at once to chart its situation, to readjust classes,
 to train instructors, and to see to implementation.  Supplementary materials may
 be drawn up for separate branches of services and specialists so that scientific and
 cultural training are closely connected with specialized techniques cultural training
 are closely connected with specialized techniques to directly serve military train-
 ing and combat preparedness.
 Headquarters Gives Five Training Requirements
 Guangzhou ZHANSHI BAO in Chinese 31 Dec 80 p 1
 [Text]  The correspondent obtained the following from the Military Region Training
 Conference.  At the Armed Forces Training Conference, General Headquarters noted
 five requirements for placing training in a combat preparedness position.
 The five requirements noted by General Headquarters were as follows:  (1) Make
 training and education a routine day to day central task.  CCP committees should make
 it a priority matter in preparations for combat, placing it on their agenda of im-
 portant things to do.  The army and the government should work together and person-
 ally take a hand in the work, and command, political, and rear-services organizations
 should act jointly for timely and vigorous solution to real problems existing in
 training.   (2) Conscientious implementation of the strategic programs and the guid-
 ing ideology in training for active defense of the Military Affairs Commission,
 truly making cadre and coordinated combat operations the center piece of training,
 both organizing training in accordance with broad programs and specific regulations,
 and adapting general methods to specific times, specific places, and specific tasks,
 with training being hard, strict, and geared to the needs of actual combat.  (3) Make
 full use of the role of political ideological work, and unswervingly adhere to the
 line, the programs and the policies decided upon during the Third Plenary Session
 of the 11th Party Central Committee, with cadres at each echelon of leadership set-
 ting a personal example to launch a wideranging mass movement of comparison, study,
 catch up, assist, and surpass in the training of soldiers, preventing formalism and

 the pursuit of prizes.  (4) Engage in the training of personnel, give training at
 the appointed times, of the prescribed content, and of good quality in accordance
 with the regulations of the Military Affairs Commission, and General Headquarters,
 and set up a regular training sequence, the main courses of which can bear scrutiny
 and examination.  (5) Actively do a good job of the various training safeguards,
 maintain the high morale and the vigorous health of military units, and fulfill
 training tasks in a united, high key, strict, and active way maintaining quality
 and quantity.
 Good Prospects for Training Reform
 Guangzhou ZHANSHI BAO in Chinese 31 Dec 80 p 1
 [Text]  The Guangzhou Military Region Training Conference stressed the following:
 In order for military training to progress quickly, it is necessary to continue the
 emancipation of thinking and to do a good job of training reform.  Reform of training
 still holds bright prospects.
 The conference acknowledged that for training reform to move in the right direction
 and develop".in a healthy way, it is necessary to take account of enemy weaponry
 and equipment, combat charactetistics, and war zone terrain in undertaking reforms.
 It is also necessary to conduct reforms in accordance with the combat mission of
 individual units, and to refer to unit combat experiences in self-defense.  It is
 necessary to work from existing armaments and take note of future developments in
 undertaking reforms.  The process of reform requires handling the relationship be-
 tween fundamentals and their application, centralization and flexible application,
 and requirements and possibilities:in a revival and elaboration of the effective
 training methods destroyed by Lin Biao and the "gang of four."
 Training reform methods are a major link in improvement of the quality of training.
 In making plans, checking and guiding, evaluating and criticizing, organizing group
 training and training exercises of various kinds, leaders above the regiment level
 and principal training units must stress and study reform.  Cadres below battalion
 level should diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's 10 great training methods and
 the "Twenty Basic Training Methods for Companies," and emphasize study and reform of
 training methods, thereby obtaining more, faster, better, and more economic results.
 In order to do a good job of training reform, there must be further emancipation of
 the mentality, and wide-ranging launching of academic discussion in combination with
 training reform, and strengthening of the scientific nature of reform.  Leaders at
 all echelons, and organizations should pitch in personally, investigate and study,
 and take the lead in undertaking reform.  For major reforms affecting the entire
 armed forces, pilot projects should first be set up for repeated experimentation,
 full proving out, and real mastery before general promotion, so that training reform
 will proceed both actively and reliably.  As units use and experiment with the vari-
 ous training texts printed by the military region, they should promptly propose
 ideas for revisions whenever they discover questions.

 REGIMENT INVOLVED IN DECEPTION CRITICIZED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 26 Feb 81 p 1
 Article:  "Resolutely Correct the Unhealthy Tendency Toward Deception"]
 [Text]  The report titled "Plans for an Undeserved Reputation Result in Real Trouble"
 exposed and criticized the inferior quality of construction in national defense
 projects, but some leading cadres still practiced deception in order to fool higher
 authorities.  The actions of certain leading cadres in this regiment not only amounted
 to a dereliction of duty, but were out of character with the party and not permitted
 by party discipline, and naturally were scrutinized and punished by higher authori-
 ties in the party organization.
 Incidents involving deception and fooling higher authority to gain honor as serious
 as the one in this regiment are singular.  But unhealthy tendencies such as this
 one are by no means singular, and they exist, to a certain extent, in certain units.
 For example, some units very obviously are not very thorough and do not do a very
 solid job of indoctrination in the line and policies.  Political liberalism is very
 serious yet materials are written to conceal theetrue situation from higher authori-
 ties, to represent errors as being "correct", and to say that unhealthy tendencies
 are "healthy tendencies."  As a result, prompt help from higher authorities is not
 forthcoming, and thus errors are. compounded.  What glory is'there in "honors" that
 come from uttering falsehoods?  Is this not to plan for an undeserved reputation
 only to land in real trouble?  Our purpose in having printed in the newspaper the
 incident involving deception by a certain regiment was to arouse widespread interest
 and to make everyone think about whether his own unit has the same kind of tendencies,
 and if they have, then to resolutely correct them.  If not very serious, they should
 be nipped in the bud, and if there is a style of continuous perseverance in seeking
 truth in facts, that should be sustained and elaborated.
 Not to conceal or distort the true face of reality is what the party requires of
 Communist Party members.  Both "On Various Regulations Pertaining to Political Life
 Within the Party", and the party's draft constitution, both make this provision
 clear.  To make a mistake in work is not awful; just report it factually, and then
 with the help of the organization and the masses, and through criticism and self-
 criticism it can be corrected.  What is awful is deception, concealing faults and
 glossing over wrongs.  This not only botches the work, but also corrupts work style
 and leads to serious consequences.  Were one to tell lies and falsely report the
 military situation in the course of war, that would mean defeat.

 one reason for deceptive behavior is frequently related to selfish desire for fame
 and profit.  When one has such selfish desires, desire for revolutionary endeavors
 and a sense of responsibility must inevitably wane.  It was out of a seeking after
 individual position of fame and fortune and a mentality of worry about gains and
 losses that certain cadres in this regiment did wrong and made the mistake of de-
 ception, from which a lesson should be learned.  In order to rectify party character,
 we must intensify the remolding of our world outlook, overcome selfishness, get rid
 of ideas of fame and profit and this or that kind of.self ish concerns, and place
 benefit to the revolution in first place everywhere.  Only in this way can the high
 sense of revolutionary responsibility be used in every task without disappointing
 the trust of the party and the people.
 Comrade Chen Yun noted that "the matter of supporting the party character of the
 political party is a matter of life and death, existence or extinction for the
 party."  In the rectification of party character, CCP committees at all echelons
 must give strict attention.  The party discipline inspection committees at all
 echelons have a particularly great responsibility.  Criticism and struggle must be
 continued against unorthodox tendencies, and they must be resolutely corrected.
 First is the need to oppose boycott or misrepresentation and feigned compliance
 with the line, the programs, and the policies of the Third Plenary Session.  This
 is a major point for discipline inspection work.  Work that is extremely irresponsi-
 bly done, causing serious losses and tremendous expense, and actions intended to
 misrepresent, deceiving superiors and deluding subordinates must likewise be
 strictly inspected and corrected.  The national economy is currently in process of
 further readjustment.  The party and the state are saving expenditures in every
 quarter, and expanding popular practice of strict economy to allot funds from limited
 expenditures to build up national defense.  We must have the attitude of masters of
 our own affairs, and we must have a high sense of responsibility for winning future
 wars, maintaining quantity and maintaining quality in handling every matter pertain-
 ing to the building of national defense, because this relates directly to the great
 matter of future war to resist aggression and national security.  The unhealthy
 trend toward special privileges in life should also be conscientiously investigated
 and resolutely overcome.  All comrades must resolutely carry out "Various Regula-
 tions on Political Life Within the Party."  They must unswervingly carry out the
 party line, programs, and policies of the Third Plenary Session, and unconditionally
 maintain political oneness with the party Central Committee.  They must buoy up
 their revolutionary spirits and conscientiously and earnestly do a good job.  All
 conduct in violation of the "Regulations," and all forms of unhealthy tendencies,
 should be bravely criticized and struggled against.
 Following rectification under the leadership and with the help of the superior party
 organization, this regiment's leading cadres expressed determination to correct
 their errors, and the morale and ideological work style of the unit has already
 improved.  All this merits acclaim.  Comrade Mao Zedong said:  "Under certain condi-
 tions, a bad thing can lead to a good result."  A fall into the pit, a gain in your
 wit; learn from mistakes.  We anticipate that this-regiments' leaders and comrades
 will deeply learn from the lessons of this experience, will correct their party
 character, buoy up their spirits, and do a good job in every way this year, doing
 well in the building of the unit including the building of its work style.

 REGIMENT CRITICIZED FOR DECEPTION LEADING TO SERIOUS LOSSES
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 26 Feb 81 p 1
 [Article by Lo Fubao [.5012 1381 1405] and Zhang Shenglun [1728 0581 0243]:  "Effort
 to Get an Undeserved Reputation Results in Real Trouble; A Certain Regiment's
 Deception Causes Serious Losses"]
 [Text]  In November 1980 when the correspondents visited a certain military unit,
 they heard some comrades discuss an incident involving a regiment "wondrous in
 construction."  A number of the tunnels that this regiment revetted in 1979 did not
 meet specifications, and the unit's discipline examination commission forwarded a
 report of criticism on 20 September 1980.  People said, "Unless this problem is ex-
 posed and criticized, we will sustain great losses in any future war!"
 Although this event took place a long time ago, the lessons it contains are worth
 remembering, and so we would like to understand the matter from beginning to end.
 In late March 1979, a certain regiment (with a subordinate battalion) received orders
 to go to a construction zone.  In early April, the entire regiment began construc-
 tion.       In view of the amount of work assigned by higher authority, the regiment
 figures more than 60,000 workdays would be required to complete it, and the assign-
 ment was more than could be done realistically in that amount of time.
 The regimental leaders felt greatly pressured, and made up their minds to do every-
 thing possible to complete the mission.  At the same time, however, they also
 harbored some selfishness, hoping to build up their own prestige.  They aroused
 the cadres and soldiers to make.a concerted effort, and they allowed for no Sunday's
 off.  A daily three shifts was changed to two shifts, and the amount of revetment
 work to be done was steadily increased. At that time, the revetment unit's soldiers
 were working 12 hours a day, the time required to go to and from work and getting
 ready for construction not included.  Everyone was weary.  Under these circum-
 stances, in order to meet quantity requirements, some soldiers cared only about how
 the construction looked and not whether it was done well or poorly behind the facade.
 When leaders from various echelons in the regiment inspected the site, they noted
 only the speed of work and whether it looked all right.  When some leaders dis-
 covered problems, they might sometimes stop them, or they might simply turn a blind
 eye to them.

 On 7 September after a certain company had finished revetting a tunnel, a regimental
 staff officer discovered that not all the steel reinforcing rods that should have
 been used in this tunnel had been used; some of them were laying at the processing
 site.  He knew perfectly well that the project's quality was not up to standards,
 so he told the deputy political instructor to throw away the reinforcing rod speci-
 fications for this tunnel and do a cover up.
 Another company made test borings of a revetted tunnel, discovering the thickness
 of the concrete to be several centimeters less than design specifications.  Batta-
 lion leaders at the site felt there were problems.  Then someone suggested using a
 stock to ram mortar into the test bores to increase the thickness.  Such action was
 wrong, yet the leaders of the battalion finally agreed that the company should do
 this.  When the deputy battalion commander reported the matter to the regiment, the
 regimental commander made no criticism but said only, it will have to be "handled"
 well; otherwise it will be a large problem!  The deputy division commander who was
 at the site to help improve the work and gain firsthand experience offered no dis-
 senting view about the "handling."  This "method" was rapidly adopted by other con-
 struction companies.
 On 13 September in the course of test borings, the tunnel revetments of yet another
 company were found to be insufficiently thick.  Following a visit to the site, the
 regimental commander, the deputy political commissar, and the chief of staff felt
 the problem to be a serious one, but each of them had a different idea in mind about
 the matter.  The regimental commander thought: during the construction, higher autho-
 rity held an on-site meeting to promote experiences.                  Now the work is finished and
 if the thickness is insufficient, nothing can be done to change it.  As for making
 a report to higher authority, I have been a soldier for 20 years; everything has
 gone well, and I went up through the ranks.  This is also my first year as regimental
 commander, and I want every leadership echelon to have a good impression of me....
 The chief of staff thought:  If they want to go through this again, we'.11 "go through
 the motions"....
 The deputy political commissar thought:  I haven't been in this assignment very
 long, so it wouldn't be good to raise a dissenting view....
 After returning from the site, the leaders did not hold a meeting to study the
 problem, and when subordinates asked instructions about what to do, the regiment
 replied, "You study it and handle it."
 And so it was that many of the tunnels revetted by the regiment did not meet quality
 specifications, though they were commended as "splendid" and "fine," and given an
 overall rating of "outstanding construction."  At year end when work was summarized,
 one of the companies that had done tunnel revetment work that was not up to standards
 was cited as being a "model company."  The commander of one battalion who had parti-
 cipated in the deception was acknowledged to be "top flight," and "knows how to
 get things done."  One company commander who had been part of the deception received
 an order of commendation.
 Two soldiers including Zhao Kelin [6392 3784 3829] wrote letters to higher authori-
 ties reporting the serious problems in construction done by their own companies.  In
 early 1980, an organization in the Military Affairs Commission and the JIEFANGJUN
 BAO press forwarded these two letters to the regiment's superiors.

 Leaders of the higher authority charged a pertinent unit with organizing a joint
 investigation team to recheck the quality of construction and confirm that what
 the soldiers had reported was the truth.  The discipline examination commission of
 a certain unit issued a notice criticizing the serious problem in this regiment's
 deception, which could cause accidents.  To enforce military discipline, folldWing
 approval by the CCP Committee of a certain unit, the regimental commander, deputy
 regimental commander, and the battalion commander (presently regimental deputy chief
 of staff) were punished.  Other leading cadres responsible for the construction were
 given serious reprimands.  The division and the regiment withdrew commendations from
 units and individuals with serious questions about their conduct.
 When we visited this regiment, the regimental commander said sadly:  An effort to
 get an undeserved reputation must bring real troubles.  In. some future war, a pro-
 ject of such shoddy quality could lead to incalculable consequences.  This is a
 crime against the people, and the lesson is one that will not be easily forgotten
 all one's life.  Several regimental cadres who had been responsible said they were
 determined to strive to right the wrong and to make up the loss.
 In the course of the visit, we heard many discussions and thought about many pro-
 blems.  The building of national defense projects not only consumes a large amount
 of financial resources, material resources, and manpower, but it also directly rami-
 fies to future warfare and the national security.  That the leaders of a certain
 regiment as well as cadres in the division and battalion concerned would have'gone
 so far as to practice such deception, though only an isolated case, it makes us
 realize the extreme importance of building good military and party character.  In
 writing this report, our goal is that everyone should think deeply and learn a lesson
 from this error.  Such a serious lack of responsibility and the unhealthy tendency
 toward deception must be resolutely resisted and decisively corrected.

 PLA UNIT DOES EARTHQUAKE RELIEF WORK
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 11 Mar 81 p 2
 [Article by Wu Xin [0702 9515] and Xiang Rong [4382 2837]1   "Fighters Who'Forgot
 Self;  A Record of Several Soldier Cadres On the Front Line of Earthquake Disaster
 Relief in Daofu"]
 [Text]   Following a severe earthquake in Daofu, the company commander of an anti-
 aircraft machinegun company, Liu Chuanfu [0491 0278 1381] led the soldiers of two
 platoons in a lightning trip to the pharmaceutical warehouse of the County Bureau
 of Commerce to save the pharmaceuticals.
 Three of the earthen walls of this warehouse had already collapsed, and the remain-
 ing wall was leaning inward at a 15 degree angle and was in. danger of collapsing at
 any time.  Liu Chuanfu thought that if the wall collapsed the pharmaceuticals in-
 side the warehouse would be damaged, causing a great loss of national wealth.  We
 are son and daughter soldiers of the people who would rather'take a little risk than
 let state property suffer great loss.  He decided'to use several timbers to shore up
 the wall and quickly snatch the medicines from inside the warehouse.  The other
 soldiers on the scene were about to rush into the warehouse when Liu Chuanfu stopped
 them saying;  "It's dangerous inside. I'll go in and~pass them out and you stay
 outside and take them."  He took two squad leaders and rushed into the warehouse,
 passing case after case and container after container of medicines outside the door
 to the soldiers.  Under the leadership of Liu Chuanfu, the soldiers faced danger
 fearlessly.  After half an hour of courageous rescue efforts, pharmaceuticals from
 within the warehouse worth 300,000 Yuan were carried to safety.  Not long after the
 soldiers who had rescued the pharmaceuticals had finished,.they heard a loud rumble
 as the wall collapsed.  Deputy bureau chief Lin of the Bureau of Commerce shook
 Liu Chuanfu's hand tightly and said, "You risked your lives to snatch so many phar-
 maceuticals; you have done a great  deed of merit!"
 Joins the Struggle Despite Illness
 Ding Zhen, Tibetan commander of the Fifth Company of a certain unit, earned the
 praise of everyone when in the-course of rescue work after an earthquake, he rescued
 people and property.
 When the earthquake struck, Ding Zhen was suffering from influenza with a fever of
 more than 39 degrees.  Wearing a flimsy shirt and trousers, he bored from inside a
 collapsed house, greeted deputy political instructor, He Erjiang [0149 1422 3068]

 simply, and then went to regimental headquarters to ask for a mission to perform.
 When he returned to his company, he had He Erjiang take charge of a company to organize
 rescue work in the barracks, himself braving wind and rain to lead two platoons into
 the streets to help rescue the masses from danger and disaster.  Wherever the job
 was greatest and the danger heaviest, he was there fighting.  The County Grain Bureau
 was a small narrow place filled with dangers, so he took a platoon leader and rushed
 into the building where they dug dirt and pushed aside bricks to rescue people,
 rapidly rescuing five Tibetan civilians and some property.  Because of the high
 winds on the plateau, the dust irritated his nostrils, and as a result of this plus
 a high fever and having gone without food for a day, he passed out twice.  Medical
 personnel and soldiers urged him repeatedly to rest, but he would not.  Instead he
 continued along together with some soldiers to the bus station and other places to
 rescue people.  His hands, feet, and head had all been hurt by pieces of brick, but
 he bore the pain to go on carrying two people on his back for more than 1 li to the
 Forestry Bureau hospital for treatment.  Roused by Ding Zhen, the soldiers finished
 in good time the rescue tasks given them in the regiment, rescuing 40 people and a
 large amount of goods.  They also helped the county people's armed forces department
 dig out ammunition buried in the rubble.
 "To Save the People Is Important"
 Following a violent earthquake, the buildings of a machinegun company in a certain
 unit were turned into rubble in the twinkling of an eye.  From one of the collapsed
 buildings, comrades dug out a Tibetan squad leader, Peng Zhicai [1756 1807 20881,
 who was hurt in several places.  After regaining consciousness and seeing that the
 company was going to rescue disaster victims, he wanted to participate.  Cadres in
 the company told him, "You are hurt.  Stay home and rest."  Peng Zhicai said, "One
 more person means one more unit of strength.  My little injury doesn't amount to
 anything; it's the masses who are important!" Thus saying, he limped off with the
 company.  In the course of the rescue work, he carried timbers, dug through bricks
 and stones, carried wounded on his back, and became so tired his whole head sweat.
 On the way back to the company area young Peng heard that 2 li away  an  entire
 Tibetan commune family of four people were still pinned inside a collapsed house,
 and he led two soldiers to the rescue at a run.  Upon arrival, they listened careful
 for sounds while using their hands to push away bricks and tiles and dig in the dirt.
 Soon they dug out a middle-age woman of more than 40 years old who, after prompt
 medical treatment, was soon out of danger.  Next, he and the two soldiers dug out
 three children.

 [Newsletter by Yang Yuchen, contributing correspondent:  "Shijiazhuang
 Senior Infantry Academy Carries Out Pedagogical Reform To Raise Teaching
 Standard"]
 [Text]  When combat units send their principal cadres to the academy for
 training, how should the academy train them?  This question was answered
 by Shijiazhuang Senior Infantry Academy in no uncertain terms:  Make great
 effort to emanicipate the mind and do a good job in pedagogical reform to
 satisfy the trust of the Military Commission and the expectations of the
 PLA.  The personnel of the academy are making preparations with great confi-
 dence for starting the training classes by the end of September 1979.
 Upon receipt of the directive of the Military Commission of the CCP Central
 Committee on the need to give top priority to the work of training principal
 cadres for combat units, the party committee of the Shijiazhuang Senior
 Infantry Academy held an expanded meeting to review its work in the past
 1 1/2 years since the founding of the academy.  At the meeting, it was felt
 deeply that the key in raising the teaching standard of the academy lies
 in emancipating the mind and doing a good job in pedagogical reform.  In
 this connection, the party committee has paid close attention to the following:
 Teaching material reform--The leadership of the academy directed the teachers
 to break the bondage of the "two whatevers" and do a good job in writing,
 editing and revising the teaching materials.  To break out of the confinement
 of old books, the party History Teaching and Research Office dispatched some
 teachers to Shanghai, Jinggangshan, Zunyi, and other historical revolutionary
 areas to collect and collate historical data for revising and supplementing
 the teaching materials on party history.  The Arms Teaching and Research Office
 arranged to increase the teaching hours on the coordinated operations of
 different branches of the armed services, and incorporate new materials into
 its curricula, including knowledge about atomic bombs, guided missiles, neutron
 bombs, lasers, satellites, computers and automatic commanding.  To familiarize
 the new students with modern weapons and equipment, with the approval of higher
 authorities, the office procured some samples of antitank guided missiles and

 antiaircraft guided missiles.  The broad masses of the teachers did their
 utmost to complete preparations for expeditiously opening classes.  By now,
 the Training Teacher and Research Office has compiled 38 sets of new teaching
 materials and revised 20 sets of old teaching materials to guarantee that the
 needs for military teaching would be satisfied in the main.
 Pedagogical Reform--In making preparations for opening classes, the teachers
 came to realize that the old teaching method of asking the students to "rely
 mainly on their self-study" and carry out "broad discussions" must be changed
 in favor of relying mainly on classroom lectures and adopting the method of
 developing the initiative of the students.  The Foreign Armed Forces Group of
 the Logistics Teaching and Research Office would direct the students to analyze
 the tactics of the enemy and take action accordingly, in this way the enemy
 can play the role of teacher.  To raise the students' ability to operate
 independently and assume command, the No 2 Tactics Teaching and Research Office
 readjusted the relative times devoted to study and practice, granting more time
 for reviewing the operations.  The Electrification Teaching and Research Office
 did a good job in video filming and automatic filming.  To raise the teaching
 standard, the various teaching and research offices have assigned their most
 experienced teachers to the forefront instead of assigning both old and new
 teachers to the students, thereby they have improved markedly the teaching
 results.
 Leadership improvement--The party committee of the academy holds that to improve
 greatly the teaching standards, it is necessary for members of the leadership
 to go down to the basic levels and engage in teaching the students themselves
 for a change.  Accordingly, of the seven leading cadres of the academy, five
 have taken up teaching work, and the leading comrades of the teaching and research
 offices of the various departments and brigades have also been assigned teaching
 tasks according to their own fields of learning.

 PLA REGIMENT APPLIES ANTITANK TACTICS
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 26 Sep 79 p 1
 [Report by Tiejun, Xiang Qi, Xiao Lin and Li-Kun]
 [Text]  A certain regiment of the PLA Shenyang units stationed at the frontier
 of northeast China achieved very good results in its antitank warfare training
 centering on the application of the three-offensive and three-defensive tactics
 during the first 8 months of 1979, topping its best record in history.  The
 regiment achieved excellent results in its training to hit tanks with 40-mm
 bazooka and hit aircraft with small arms and in five other training items.
 This was acknowledged by higher authorities.
 At the start of its training work, this regiment courageously reformed its
 training program, devoting 50 percent of its training time to the three-
 offensive and three-defensive antitank tactics, taking it as the main item
 of training.  The regiment party committee paid close attention to the anti-
 tank training.  Feng Jixian [7458 4949 03411, regiment commander, and ,
 Wu Minglu [0702 2494 4389], deputy commissar, directed a work team to stay
 with the fifth company for observation.  They also assigned personnel to
 prepare 27 sets of antitank training curricula, organized 21 antitank tactics
 study groups, and trained 198 antitank hands, 40 teachers for the three-
 defensive tactics, and 20 teachers for the antiaircraft tactics.  The regiment
 spent 50 percent of its training funds on the procurement and making of
 training equipment for the three-offensive and three-defensive tactics, the
 construction of two antitank training and four anticraft training fields to
 improve its training facilities.
 In the course of training, the regiment continually studied and practiced
 new training items, such as finding the best ways and means to use antitank
 weapons effectively under cover in chemical and atomic warfare, and to
 incorporate antitank tactics into general tactics training program;.  Through
 a trial-and-error process, the regiment achieved marked success in this work.
 On the occasion when a field demonstration on the three-offensive and three-
 defensive antitank tactics was held at the regiment sponsored by the army
 command, a gas-masked gunner of an 82-mm recoilless gun hit the target eight
 times in as many shots, and all the nine companies which participated in the
 40-mm bazooka training achieved high marks.

 [Report by Liu Huaigiang and Guo Jinjin]
 [Text]   Since the beginning of 1979, a certain unit of the PLA Fuzhou units
 stationed on the southeast China coast has paid much attention to sea-crossing,
 landing, combat training for carrying out anticipated missions in future wars.
 To carry out the training more realistically, the troops were brought from
 their camps to the combat area to practice on coordinated landing operations.
 By now, they have studied and carried out exercises on the following types of
 operations:  coordinated ship-loading operations according to the rise and
 fall of tide; coordinated firing operations with different types of arms on
 board ship while sailing forward against the enemy; and operations to occupy
 a beachhead, to capture advanced positions through many routes, to breach
 the enemy front, to seize and consolidate coastal positions, and to attack
 enemy firing positions in depth.  Repeated exercises were carried out from
 stage to stage in this training program.  This program enabled the various
 armed services and their branches to improve their coordinated sea-crossing
 operations.   In mid-August, an exercise with live ammunition was carried out
 with the participation of 10 landing craft, and certain artillery, infantry,
 antichemical and signal units.  The exercise was carried out under resolute
 and well-coordinated command, making the sea-crossing, landing operation a
 brilliant success.  During this operation, of the 158 rounds of artillery
 fired, 149 hit the target.  More than 11,900 rounds of small arms ammunition
 were fired.  Of the 177 targets under attack, 155 were wiped out.  The result
 was excellent.

 PLA REGIMENT EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS IN TRAINING
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 26 Sep 79 p 1
 [Report by Fang Xiuwen and Li Lin]
 [Text]  A certain regiment of the PLA Wuhan units has fulfilled its task of
 assisting in the shooting of a film by a certain motion picture studio which
 started at the beginning of 1979.  In addition, it has also done exceedingly
 well in its training program.  The infantry of the regiment was divided into
 different teams, of which the 1979 recruits were trained according to a
 standardized program.  All the other troops of the regiment have completed
 their training with excellent marks in exercises No 1 and No 2 in the
 operations of three types of small arms with live ammunition while wearing
 gas masks.  The 40-mm bazooka squad in carrying out exercises No 1 and No 3
 with live ammunition hit its target 73 times in 74 shots.  The mobile artillery
 detachment and the heavy machine gun unit in carrying out exercises Nos 1, 2
 and 3 with live ammunition achieved excellent marks.  The 82-mm mortar squad
 in carrying out its marksmanship and simple shooting exercises, and the
 82-mm recoilless gun unit iri.carrying out its shooting exercise against fixed
 targets and shoulder-shooting exercises, have all achieved excellent marks.
 In the field of cadre training, the examination on cadres' commanding skills
 at the cadres' own levels showed that they averaged over 85 in marks.  What
 has contributed to such great success in training?  1.  The training was carried
 out in the spirit of the Third Plenum of the 11th CCP Central Committee.
 2.  The party committee paid great attention to the training work.  3.  The
 training program was reformed courageously.  4.  Each company was allowed
 some autonomy in carrying out its training operations.

 BORDER SKI PATROLS--On 20 February, the Yichun Military Sub-district in Heilongjiang
 Province and the 4th company of a certain border defense regiment convened an on-site
 meeting in which this company's experiences with ski patrols as a change from winter
 foot patrols were promoted.       Boundless snowfields are a natural obstacle for the
 winter patrols of northern border troops.  Formerly the troops always ran patrols on
 foot.  This year, however, right after the New Year, with the support and guidance
 of their superiors, the 4th Company combined patrols with ski training.  Now more
 than 70 percent of the soldiers in this company patrol on skis, and more than 80
 percent of cadres are able to lead patrols on skis.  Patrol units sent out by the
 company are generally able to make long-range raids of more than 20 kilometers at a
 time.  The change in patrol methods has decreased the physical exertion of cadres
 and soldiers, increased the speed of movement, and has effectively strengthened
 border patrols.   [Text] [Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 25 Feb 81 p 21  9432
 TROOP TRAINING ON A SHOESTRING--Since its formation last October, the training unit
 of a certain division of the Lanzhou Military District has worked hard and frugally
 to train troops, and has trained more than 200 key cadre for the forces.  This divi-
 sion's training unit lives in some old caves.  It's training devices are insuffi-
 cient, and conditions are pretty bad.  But they have not put out their hands to
 higher authority, but rather they have arduously run the unit.  The unit commander,
 instructors, the commander of the training squad, and the cook acted together in
 advance of the arrival of the trainees.  They whitewashed 56 individual caves and
 built beds of bricks to serve as both beds and benches.  After training began, when
 there was no training ground, everybody braved the wind and snow, hauled things in
 carts and carried things on their shoulders to excavate more that 160 cubic meters
 of earth and level two training grounds.  They filled with sand 18 jumping pits used
 for training, and themselves built high and low plank walls, and single log bridges.
 They also built and refurbished more than 100 training devices.  In their persever-
 ance in hardwork and thrift to train troops, the training unit both saved training
 expenses and also gave the trainees a great education.   [Text] [Beijing JIEFANGJUN

 STANDING GUARD IN XINJIANG--A certain mountain pass in Xinjiang Province is a famous
 windy gap in China.  Here, great winds of more than 8 force blow more than 100 days
 of every year.  When the wind blows,.it carries sand and stones that blot out the
 sky, and it can snap rooftop chimneys or push stopped motor vehicles into the Gobi.
 As a result of the long period of wild winds, even the stones on mountains are com-
 pletely covered with irregular pits great and small.  This vicious natural environ-
 ment causes great hardships for the soldiers in the border defense company stationed

 here.  When standing guard duty on the road, in particular, frequently headwinds
 have made it possible for the men to keep their balance, and they have been unable
 to move.  The soldiers have no choice but to crawl to their sentry positions.  When
 they go off guard duty, whether they want to or not, they are forced by the wind to
 run and are unable to stop.  However, because of their concerns for the safety of
 the motherland, the border defense soldiers have never failed to post guard as a
 result of high winds.  On one occassion, in order to carefully guard against the
 sabotage and disturbances caused by the enemy, platoon leader Ning Hezhou [1380
 0735 1558] led four soldiers from the 7th Squad in mounting guard.  On this parti-
 cular day, the wild wind was howling so fiercely that it darkened the sky and ob-
 scured the earth.  Even the surveying instruments set up by the company were blown
 over.  Outside the barracks, the accumulated snow was half a man deep.  They stamped
 out a path in the snow and facing into the wind, they arduously walked in the direc-
 tion of their guard post.  But the wind was too strong, and they were unable to move.
 When some comrades would move one step forward, the wind would push them back and
 knock them flat on their backs.  In order to reach their post on time, Ning Hezhou
 had the soldiers go into the prone position at once and crawl, continuing their
 movement forward.  At that time, the air temperature was more than 30?C below zero,
 and a layer of frost had crystallized on everybody's fur hat.  Their hands were so
 cold they tingled and pained.   But Ning Hezhou and his comrades in arms paid no
 heed; they continued to press their bodies down and crawl toward the sentry post
 foot by foot.  A distance of slightly more than 400 meters took an entire hour to
 negotiate, but they finally reached the guard post on time.   [Text]   [Beijing
