 New Achievements of the Nationa
 Economy of the USSR
 THE Soviet people, inspired and directed by the
 Party of Lenin and Stalin, are successfully im-
 plementing the magnificent Stalin programme
 for building the material and technical foundation of
 Communism.  Nature is being transformed in vast
 territories of the Land of Soviets ; the world's biggest
 hydro-electric stations and irrigation systems are being
 built.  The economic might of.the Sccialist power is
 rising year after year ; the culture of the peoples of
 the USSR is being advanced and the living standard
 of the working people is improving.
 The past year has witnessed new, outstanding. vic-
 tories on every sector of Communist construction.
 Vivid and convincing evidence of this is contained in
 the report of the Central  Statistical  Board of the
 Council of Ministers of the USSR on the fulfilment of
 the state plan and development of the national economy
 of the USSR in 1f51.
 The uninterrupted and rapid development of eco-
 nomy and culture in the Soviet country is a result of
 the wise direction of all Communist construction by the
 Party of Lenin and Stalin, a result of the enthusiastic
 labour of the Soviet people.
 The gross production plan fixed by the government
 for 1951 has been fulfilled by all industry of the USSR
 to the extent of 103.5 per cent.  As compared with
 1.950, gross output of Soviet industry has grown in 1951
 by 16 per cent. The provisions of the 1951 state plan
 have been surpassed in a number of most important
 industries, as, for example, in the production of iron
 and steel, coal, oil, electric power, electric motors,
 metal cutting lathes, tractors and harvester combines,
 automobiles, steam locomotives and diesel engines, ex-
 cavators, etc.
 Thanks to the unrelaxing attention devoted by the
 Communist Party, the Soviet Government and the
 great Stalin to the technical progress, major successes
 have been achieved last year oving in imprthe tchnical
 equipment of all branches of national economy, in rais-
 ing the level of mechanization in all the arduous and
 laborious processes.  The Soviet machine-building in-
 dustry has produced about 500 very important types
 and models of machines and equipment.  The use of
 new highly efficient technological processes has been
 steadily promoted in all the branches of national eco-
 nomy and automatization of production has been ad-
 vanced.  About 700,000 inventions and rationalizing
 proposals have been adopted in production last year.
 Labour productivity in all branches of national
 economy has been growing steadily as a result of im-
 provements in technical equipment, in the skill of the
 workers and in the organization of production.  A 10
 per cent increase in labour productivity was registered
 in industry last year as compared with 1950.
 An index of the quality of work in industry, one of
 the most important sources of accumulation in national
 economy, and a condition for improvements in the
 living standard of the working people are contained
 in the systematic cuts of production costs.  The plan
 for lowering production costs in industry was improved
 upon this year, with a result that a saving of more than
 26,000 million rubles was effected in industry alone,
 apart from the saving resulting from the reduction in
 wholesale prices for raw and other materials.
 The past year has witnessed further progress in socialist
 agriculture.  Notwithstanding the unfavourable weather
 in the Volga area, in Western Siberia, Kazakhstan
 and in some other districts, the gross crop of cereals
 last year amounted to 7,400 million poods.  Moreover
 the crop of food grain-wheal: and rye-was higher
 than in 1950.  The gross cotton. and sugar beet crops
 have increased substantially as compared with 1950.
 There has been a continuous increase in livestock of the
 collective and state farms.  The total stock in  the
 country increased by nearly 14 million heads in 1951.
 The successful development of industry and increase

 in the production of agricultural raw materials made it
 possible to effect a considerable increase in general
 consumer goods.  Government orders for extra produc-
 tion of a number of very important manufactured goods
 and foodstuffs over and above the annual plan, have
 been surpassed.
 The progress of transport goes hand in hand with
 that of industry and agriculture. The workers of railway,
 water and motor transport have considerably increased
 freight shipments.
 Engrossed in peaceful pursuits, the Soviet people
 are at work on the realization of a colossal construction
 programme.  State capital investments last year were
 112 per cent of the 1950 amount.  A special place be-
 longs to the titanic hydro-electric system now being built
 on the Volga, Don, Dnieper and Amu-Darya rivers.
 The government plans for all these great works in 1051
 have been successfully accomplished.
 The rapid advancement of economy of the produc-
 tivity of labour brings with it an increase in the national
 income, reductions in prices for food.ar_d manufactured
 goods and the systematic growth of wages, salaries and
 peasant incomes.  The national income of the USSR

 S IX years ago, in  his  address  to the  voters,
 on February 9, 1946, the head of  the Soviet
 Government,.]. V. Stalin outlined a       majestic
 programme of postwar peaceful development, the pro-
 gramme for building Communism in the USSR.
 This was only a few months after the war, when
 many Soviet cities and villages wrecked by the fascist
 barbarians, were still lying in ruins. The hard conse-
 querces of the war were still felt in many ways.  Many
 an American and British newspaper in those days main-
 tained that a long period of economic decline was
 inevitable in the USSR, and that the Soviet Union
 would not be able to overcome the postwar hardships
 with its own forces.
 And at that very moment, Stalin's genius like a power-
 ful searchlight illumined. to the Soviet people magnifi-
 cent prospects of Communist construction. The inspiring
 words of the beloved leader roused the Soviet people
 to new feats of heroic labour for the sake of furthering
 the progress and raising the might of their own Socia list
 State.

 The Communist Party and the Soviet Government
 are constantly working for the advancement of the
 cultural level of the working people.  There has been a
 substantial increase last year in the attendance of all
 the schools of the country ; the network of rest homes,
 cinemas and other cultural and educational institutions
 has been expanded.  Major achievements have been
 registered in Soviet science, letters and the arts.  The
 working people of the  USSR are enjoying all the
 benefits of the world's most advanced socialist culture.

 this  level  to a more or less  considerable degree.
 J.V. Stalin outlined the plan also for a longer period. He
 spoke of the intention of the Communist Party of the
 USSR to organize another powerful upsurge of the
 national economy which would make it possible within
 the next 15 years to raise the level of Soviet industry
 to a point approximately treble the prewar level, so as
 to enable it to produce annually up to 50 million tons
 of pig iron, up to 60 million tons of steel, up to 50+)
 million tons of coal and up to 60 million tons of oil.
 The Soviet people accepted tl:.is plan as a programme
 in accord with their vital interests.  The great airs
 embodied in this programme-the building of Commu-
 nism, engendered the titanic energy of the masses.

 qualities are well represented at the exhibition.  More
 than 250 varieties offish used for commercial purposes
 are found in the seas, rivers, and lakes of the USSR.
 For the wealth and variety of fish the USSR heads the
 world list ; moreover the most valuable varieties, such
 as salmons, sturgeon, etc., predominate among tl e
 fish used for processing.  The 1950 catch was 27 per
 cent higher than before the war.
 The fish processing industry of the USSR is highly
 mechanized.  For example, crabs are tinned at special
 floating plants right in the sea.  Soviet scientists have
 developed a new method of tinning black caviar, namely,
 pasteurization, which makes it possible to preserve tl e
 high qualities of caviar for a very long time.
 7'lic exhibits in the agricultural section of the Soviet
 Pavilion at the Exhibition in Bombay, as well as the
 exhibits of any other section of this Pavilion, afford
 striking evidence of the fruitful results of the peaceful
 labour of the Soviet people.
 The socialist emulation movement for the fulfilment
 of the postwar live-year plan (1946---1950) ahead of
 schedule attained nation-wide proportions.  It  sup-
 plied a still more powerful impact to the initiative of
 the Soviet people.  And it is known that the postwar
 five-year plan was accomplished ahead of schedule.
 'The USSR achieved still greater progress in every field
 of socialist economy and culture.  In vain did the
 imperialists hope that the Soviet Union, which made
 Colossal sacrifices for the victory over the forces of black
 reaction ,would not cope with the difficulties of postwar
 construction. In 1950,the last year of the quinquennium,
 d-c output of Soviet industry was 73 per cent above the
 volume produced in the prewar year of 1940.  The area
 under cereals was expanded by more than 20 per cent
 durir g these five years.  The gross grain crop in 1950
 was 245 million poods in excess of the 1940 crop.  The
 rational income of the USSR in 1950 was 64 per cent
 1_igl er than in 1940.  The living and cultural standards
 of tl.e Soviet people were greatly advanced.
 1'he year 1951 brought still greater victories to the
 peoples of the USSR.  Industrial production in 1951
 was double the 1.940 figure.  A considerable increase

 Production of Soviet Union's Agriculture and Food Industry on
 View at International Exhibition in Bombay
 By P. Khvoynik
 1 THE: produce of agriculture represented in the
 Soviet Pavilion at the International Exhibition
 in Bombay is illustrative of the colossal advance-
 ment of agriculture and the food industry in the Soviet
 Union, of the abundance of food in the Land of
 Socialism.
 The outstanding successes of Soviet agriculture have
 been achieved as a result of the collective labour of the
 Soviet peasants and the high level of mechanization of
 farming processes.  The titanic construction works of
 Communism launched on the initiative of the great
 Stalin, the colossal hydro-electric stations and irrigation
 systems being built on the Volga, Don, Dnieper and Amu
 Darya rivers, will bring about a still greater increase in
 agricultural production in the USSR.  The expansion
 of the irrigated and watered areas alone will make it
 possible to produce annually an extra 3 million tons of
 raw cotton, 500,000 poods of wheat, 30 million poods
 of rice and 6 million tons of sugar beet.  The cattle
 herds will be immensely increased.
 Large-scale planting of shelter belts, construction of
 reservoirs and the introduction of the proper travopolye
 system of farming are being promoted in the Soviet
 Union on a vast scale.  The realization of these under-
 takings in accordance with Stalin's plan for remaking
 nature  will forever do away with drought and crop
 failure and secure high and stable crop yields in the and
 districts of the USSR.
 All the achievements of the Michurin agro-biology,
 the most advanced in the world, are being utilized on
 a vast scale in Soviet agriculture.  Working in close
 co-operation with the practical workers of Socialist
 agriculture, the Michurinist scientists of the Soviet
 Union are discovering new laws governing the develop-
 ment of nature and new ways of raising the efficiency
 of agriculture.
 The steady advancement of agriculture makes it
 possible to increase output and broaden the assortment
 of foodstuffs.  The Soviet Government is systematically
 reducing prices for food and general consumer goods,
 and this leads to further improvements in the living
 standard of the working people.
 It is impossible to describe in a brief article all the
 exhibits of Soviet farm products and food items on view
 in the Soviet Pavilion at the International Exhibition in
 Bombay.  There are many varieties of cereals, flour,
 groats, tinned fish, vegetables and fruit, confectionery
 products, wines, caviar and many other items.
 A prominent place belongs to the samples of cereals
 and allied products on display.  The Soviet Union is
 the biggest producer of cereals, and in the last few years
 its annual grain crop has been exceeding 7,000 million
 poods.  The rising efficiency of agriculture has brought
 about a steady increase in the grain yields in the USSR.
 The crops garnered by the collective farms from vast
 areas average 2-3 tons and more per hectare. Domestic
 consumption of cereals and grain prochicts is steadily
 growing in the USSR.  But the Soviet Union is also a
 traditional exporter of grain to the foreign markets :
 the foreign trade of the Soviet Union is based on the
 principles of its peace policy and international economic
 co-operation.  The Indian public knows of the Soviet
 wheat deliveries to India dictated by the sincere desire
 of the Soviet Union to relieve the food difficulties in
 India.
 Not only the production of grain, but of all farm pro-
 duce has grown immensely in Soviet years. Gardening,
 horticulture and viticulture have been well advanced.
 The achievements of the Michuriin agro-biology, have
 made it possible to push the planting of orchards, berries,
 vineyards, citrus fruit and tea to districts where their
 cultivation was considered impossible in the past.
 The USSR now ranks fourth in the world for the size
 of its vineyards.  About 2,000 varieties of grapes are
 grown in the USSR, moreover their yields have reached
 the record figure of 45-60 tons per hectare.  The
 vineyards and orchards are cultivated with machinery
 supplied by special machine and tractor stati.on.s. There
 is a wide network of scientific research institutes and
 experimental stations.
 The abundance of farm produce furrisl-ed the basis
 for a powerful food industry.  Hundreds of highly me-
 chanized enterprises have been built in the USSR in a
 brief period of time.  It is enough to say that more than
 100 mechanized bakeries, 38 modern creameries, 45
 dairy plants, 47 canneries, 10 sugar refineries, 25 tea
 packing factories and many other enterprises were built
 and put into operation in the second Five-Year Plan
 period (1933-1937)  alone.  The enterprises of the
 food industry are provided with improved automatic
 equipment and instruments made in the USSR.  Only
 the best, first-class raw materials are selected for pro-
 cessing in the Soviet food industry.  Thanks to the
 excellent technical equipment of the food enterprises,
 the improved recipes and technological processes and
 the implicit observance of all the rules of sanitation and
 hygiene, the Soviet corsumer receives foodstuffs of
 superior quality only.  Evidence of this is contained in
 the samples of confectionery, wine, chocolate, jam,
 preserved fruit and other products on display at the
 Soviet Pavilion.
 Despite the colossal damage caused to Soviet na-
 tional econcmy by the war, output in the food industry
 had grown far in excess of the pre-war level as a result
 of the successful accomplishment of the first post-war
 Five-Year Plan (1946-1950) production of butter has
 grown by 57 per cent, tinned goods--48 per cent, sugar
 --17 per cent, confectionery products-23 per cent,
 etc.  As compared with the pre-war figures, the output
 of dietetic products has grown five-fold, of special pro-
 ducts for children--5.7 times and of vitamins-10.4
 times over.
 The Soviet fish products known. for their excellent

 WHAT MAKES THE NATIONAL INCOME IN
 THE USSR RISE AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN
 TO THE PEOPLE ?
 By Y. Kronrod
 Candidate of Economic Science
 T HE term " national income " is often encountered
 in newspapers, magazines and books.  When-
 ever a country's national economy is dealt with,
 or the standard of living of its people, or what possibili-
 ties there are for its economic development, the national
 income is always taken into account : the actual figure,
 whether it is going up or down, and how it is distributed.
 What, then, is this national income ? In the follow-
 ing lines we shall try to answer the question briefly.
 Every country produces material wealth that is es-
 sential to life--articles of consumption and means of
 production.  The total amount of products produced in
 a particular country is in the terminology of economists,
 the aggregate annual product.  The production of this
 material wealth requires different expenditures such as
 raw material, auxiliary material, fuel, machinery, and
 so on.  Obviously, to be able to continue production
 society has to make good those expenditures by setting
 aside a certain portion of the annual aggregate product.
 The remainder is the national income, which society
 uses, on the one hand, for consumption, and on the
 other, for new construction and expansion of production,
 that is, for accumulation. Let us give an illustration.
 Let us assume that the value of the material wealth (the
 aggregate product) produced in a year is 20,000 million
 rupees, and to produce this material wealth,4,000 million
 rupees worth of instruments and means of production
 are used up. In that case the national income will equal
 16,000 million rupees.
 It follows from this that the national income is
 created solely by the working people, by those who pro-
 duce the material and cultural values.  True, one may
 come across another definition of national income,
 namely the total income of all people in a country.  But
 that is an altogether unscientific definition, for in that
 case it would mean that persons who do nothing but just
 live on dividends, for instance, are also taking part in
 the production of the national income.
 Now, let us go back and see how the national income
 is produced in the USSR and how it is used.  The pro-
 gressive nature of the Soviet Union's economy is reflected
 particularly strikingly in the rapid  growth  of the
 country's national. income.  The rate of growth of the
 national income of the USSR is without parallel in any
 other country.
 Before the Great October Socialist Revolution in
 Russia the national income was quite low, due to the
 country's technical and economic backwardness.  In
 1913 it was but 21,000 million rubles.  But there has
 been a radical change in the situation since the victory
 gained by Soviet power ; the USSR has become a mighty
 industrial power and agriculture has been transformed
 into mechanized collective farming on a big scale. Thanks
 to this, production of the national income has grown
 many times over, amounting to 128,300 million rubles
 in 1940, or more than six times as high as in 1913.  In
 1950 it was 64 per cent above 1940, and in 1951 it was
 up 12 per cent over the year before.
 What gives the USSR an exceptionally high rate of
 growth of the national income is the Socialist character
 of its economy, which knows no crises, is operated ac-
 cording to plan in the interest of the people.
 There is no unemployment in the, USSR, where work
 is guaranteed to everyone. This fact, alone affords the
 country of Soviets tremendous opportunities of develop-
 ing its economy and of increasing the national income in
 proportion.  At the same time, every branch of the
 national economy-industry, transport, agriculture, and
 so on-gets immense quantities of up-to-date highly-
 productive machinery year after year.  It is enough to
 cite one example, in 1950, the number of machine tools
 used in industry was more than double the pre-war
 number and a great many of them were new and im-
 proved. Agriculture received in the 1946-1950 period
 536,000 tractors, 93,000 grain combines and millions
 of other agricultural machinery and implements.
 Thanks to the rapid progress made in technically
 arming labour and in improving production methods,
 labour productivity has been increasing steadily and
 at a rapid rate.  Productivity of labour in industry
 in 1950 was 37 per cent above the 1940 level.  This
 increase in labour productivity, the basis of which is
 technical progress, is the chief source of the great annual
 rise in the national income of the USSR.
 What do the Soviet people then get out of the grow-
 ing national income ?
 The higher the national income the more do the
 Soviet people get for consumption and for accumula-
 tion.                                                              It should be borne in mind that there are no
 exploiting classes in the USSR.  Soviet society is com-
 prised of working people, and the entire national income
 belongs to the people and is used in the interest of all
 of society.  That is why growth of the national income
 leads to greater wellbeing of the people. . Distribution
 of the national income in the USSR makes for systematic
 improvement in the material condition of the workers
 and peasants and expansion of Socialist production in
 town and country.
 The working people of the USSR receive approxi-
 mately three-fourths of the national income to meet
 their personal material and cultural needs.  Since the
 national income of the USSR in 1950 was, as has been
 stated before, 64 per cent above that of 1940, it is not
 difficult to see that the material welfare of the people
 has risen substantially.  And, indeed, statistics show
 that the income of Soviet people---workers, peasants and
 office. employees-in 1950 was 62 per cent (in compar-
 able prices) above that of 1940. It is altogether natural,
 therefore, that there should be ,a rapid increase in the

 W E can often feel what the pulse of a nation, any nation, was yesterday, what it, is today
 and what it is going to be tomorrow by reading the newspapers. It makes no difference
 that the life of a newspaper is short-it's life is but a day - the daily Press enables us
 above all to judge what is the chief thing, and not only today but also tomorrow.
 X                                         X                                          X
 And so let us take a look at newspapers published on one and the same day in the
 two worlds. Lying before us are newspapers which came out on the same Sunday,  October
 14, 1951, in the USSR and the US.
 In the USSR
 Before us are 50 Soviet newspapers
 of that day.  They come from every
 part of the country,  from different
 republics  and  regions,  industrial
 centres and rural areas. But they all
 have one thing in common, something
 that makes them kindred and unites
 them-they are Soviet newspapers.
 Facts speak for themselves, and
 they are stubborn things. It will
 be enough, therefore, to reproduce
 some newspaper items to understand
 the trend of the Soviet Press, which
 truthfully mirrors the thoughts and
 hopes, the peaceful labour and heroic
 deeds, of the people living in the
 Soviet country.  The most captious
 reader will not find in it even a single
 line calling for war.
 " Uralsky Rabochi " a newspaper
 published in Sverdlovsk, reports on
 the results obtained in an emulation
 pact entered into between three Ural
 cities :  Sverdlovsk,  Molotov and
 Chelyabinsk.      The Sverdlovsk City
 Soviet has accepted after inspection
 :0  new  apartment     houses  and
 spent over 25,)00,000 rubles on city
 improvements. Molotov is building
 a children's home to accommodate
 120 children ; it will have regular
 classrooms and shops for manual
 training. And Chelyabinsk reported
 26,000 trees and 110,000 shrubs
 planted last spring.
 On page two under the heading
 " My Contribution to the Cause of
 Peace," the paper carries statements
 by readers, men and women in all
 walks of life, telling what they are
 doing for peace.
 " Stalingradskaya Pravda " under
 the heading " Yesterda% in Stalin-
 grad " writes :
 " The State Architectural and
 Building Inspection Commission has
 okayed 20 new residential buildings.
 "A group of members of the
 Stalingrad Philharmonic Society left
 for the City of Kalach to conduct a
 musical and literary programme for
 the Volga-Don Canal builders. The
 programme includes, the  literary-
 musical compositions "Peace Will
 Triumph Over War," "The Life of
 P.I. Chaikovsky," and "The Paths of
 Development of Soviet Music."
 " Leningradskaya. Pravda " re-
 ported a decision taken by the
 Regional  Committee of the Party
 and  the  City  Soviet Executive
 Committee to lay out big orchards
 along highways and railway tracks.
 Along sidings, fruit trees will extend
 to a width of 1:5(1 metres on each
 side of the track, which means that
 for every kilometre of track there
 will he 30 hectares of orchard.
 " Pravda Severa," published in
 Arkhangelsk, carries a story on a
 readers'  conference held  in  the
 Nenets Area school to discuss T.
 Syomushkin's book " Alitet Goes to
 the Mountains."  Vanyuta, a rein-
 deer breeder, said that before the
 Revolution darkness and igr_orance
 were to be found not merely in
 Chukotka, the book's locale, but all
 over the Far North.  But now  even
 in the depths of the tundra new
 settlements have cropped up, schools
 and hospitals are functioning, and
 Nenets youths and girls are studying
 at higher educational establishments
 in Moscow and Leningrad.

 While fulfilling and overfulfilling the annual pro-
 sranune as regards gross output and the output of the
 majority of principal industrial products in kind certain
 Ministries did not fulfil.the plan for certain items of out-
 put; with separate enterprises' overfulfilling the pro-
 gramme of gross output through a greater production
 r,F secondary items, not fulfilling at the same time the
 programme for the production of items envisaged in the
 state plan.
 In 1951 a further improvement of the quality and
 extension of assortment of the industrial products con-
 tinued.  Not all bralrches ` of industry, however, fully
 Iirlfilled the state plan assignments as regards production
 and delivery of certain items in. the established assort-

 the Iron and Steel It dustry did rot fully fulfil the plan
 for certain items of rolled ferrous metal, the .Ministry
 of the Heavy Machii_e-Building Industry did not fulfil
 the production programme for steam boilers and steam

 Cross output of the entire industry of the USSR in
 1951. increased 16 per cent compared with 1950.
 Last year the national economy of the USSR, in
 conformity with the state plan of supply, received con-
 siderably more raw materials, supplies, fuel,. electric
 power, and equipment than in 1950..
 Further improvement in the utilisation of equip-
 ment in industry continued in 1951.  In the iron and
 steel industry utilisation of useful volume of blast furnaces
 increased last year more than five per cent as against
 1950.  Production of steel per square metre of furnace
 hearth increased almost five per cent. Exploitation drill-
 ing speed increased at the enterprises of the Ministry
 of the Oil Industry.  The proportion of light fractions
 rose.  At the enterprises of the Ministry of the Coal
 Industry productivity of coal combines increased 19 per
 cent last year.  There was an improvement in the
 utilisation of capacities for the production of synthetic
 rubber and synthetic ammonia at the plants of the
 Ministry of the Chemical Industry and in the utilisa-
 tion of equipment in the cotton goods industry and
 cement industry.
 Expenditure of raw materials, supplies, fuel, and
 electric power per unit of output in 1951 was lower than
 in 1.950, and in many industries was also below the
 planned rates.  The plan for reduction of industrial
 production costs set for 1951 was overfulfilled.  The
 economy effected through reduction of industrial pro-
 duction costs amounted to more than 26,000 million
 rubles in 1951, not counting savings at the expense
 of reduction of wholesale prices for raw materials and
 supplies.  On the basis of successes in the development
 of industry, rise of labour productivity and reduction of
 production costs attained in  1951  effected,  as  of
 January 1, 1952, a new reduction of wholesale prices of
 metals, machinery and equipment, fuel, chemicals,
 building materials, and paper, as well as a reduction
 of rates for electric power and heat and freight carriage.
 3. Introduction of New Techniques in the
 National Economy
 Further achievements in mastery of new types of
 machinery, equipment and materials were attained in
 1951.
 Soviet machine building industry developed in
 1951. about 500 highly important new types and models
 of machinery and equipment ensuring a further techni-
 cal progress of the national economy.
 There were developed new types of powerful steam
 turbines and high pressure boilers, hydro-turbines and
 hydro-generators, aerial switches, high tension discon-
 nectors and arresters for long distance transmission of
 electric power.
 Powerful  suction  dredges  and  dredgers,  highly
 efficient single-bucket  walking and multi bucketed
 excavators, powerful concrete mixers for automatized
 concrete making plants and 25 ton lorries were produced
 for mechanising labour-consuming jobs at the construc-
 tion of big hydro-technical installations.
 The machine-tool industry mastered. close to  150
 new types of highly efficient metal-cutting machine
 tools and forge and stamping machinery and a con-
 siderable number of new kinds of hard-alloy tools.
 New types of equipment.. were put out for the oil,
 chemical, light, food,  and other  industries  and
 transport.
 New types of machine and implements for soil culti-
 vation, sowing, planting,  harvesting and                                                                       processing
 of grain and industrial crops  and vegetables were
 manufactured for a further mechanisation of agricultural
 field work .  Besides, a number of new machines was
 produced for the. mechanisation of fodder preparation
 as well as for shelter belt planting.
 The level of mechanisation rose considerably in all
 branches of the national economy.
 In the coal industry mechanisation "of processes of
 hewing, breaking and the delivery of coal and. the under-
 ground transport was completed as early as, in 1950.
 In 1951 introduction of new types of combines for
 working thin and steep-sloping seams was started thus
 making it possible. to raise the level of mechanisation in
 coal loading.  More than 1,500 combines and coal
 cutting machines and 1,350 conveyor lines were trans-
 ferred to remote control operation.
 The volume of mechanised work at the enterprises
 of the Ministry of the Timber Industry of the USSR
 increased in felling and bringing up of timber L7 times
 compared with 1.950, loading of timber 2.2.. times and
 haulage of timber 1.2 times
 Introduction of new highly efficient technological
 processes was continued in all branches of the national
 economy in 1951 and work for the further automati-
 sation of production was carried on.
 At the mills of the Ministry of the Iron and Steel
 Industry 87 per cent of the entire product ion. of steel
 was melted in. open hearth furnaces outfitted with
 automatic regulators of the heat regime.   There was
 an increase in production of special  shapes of rolled
 metal which make for a considerable reduction in the
 expenditure of metal during further treatment.
 New methods and per-fected technology of concen-
 trat ion and comprehensive processing of ores, concent-
 rates and slime which make for fuller, extraction of
 non-ferrous and rare metals were introduced in non-
 ferrous metals industry
 Application of turbine drilling was expanded subs-
 tantially in the oil industry.  Oil production 'applying
 the method of maintaining strata pressure which make
 for a fuller extraction of oil was further developed. New
 technological processes of oil refining employing Soviet-
 made machinery were introduced, which made it pos-
 sible to increase the yield of oil products and raise their
 quality.
 Advanced methods of metal working-high-speed
 cutting, new electric and thermal methods of treating
 metal-were  further  applied  in   machine-building.
 Automatic and semi-automatic devices were introduced
 to control the size of parts produced on a mass scale.
 Work has been carried on for a comprehensive auto-
 matisation of hydro-electric stations and automatisation
 of the thermal procsses in boiler units of the power
 stations.  More than 90 per cent of the district hydro-
 electric  stations  have  automatised  operation  of
 units.
 Introduction of close to 700 ,000 inventions and
 rationalisation proposals of workers and engineering and
 technical personnel designed to perfect and radically
 improve production processes were applied in 1951;

 4. Agriculture
 In 19.r1 socialist agricultur, attained new successe;
 in the development of farming and livestock raising as
 well as in the organisational economic consolidation of
 the collective farms.
 T1, _e. total grain harvest, according to the figures of
 the chief harvest assessment inspection of the Council
 of Ministers of the USSR, notwithstanding unfavourable
 weather conditions  in districts of the Volga valley,
 )Western Siberia, Kazakhstan and  certain other dis-
 tricts, amounted to 7,400 million ponds in 1951 .  The
 harvest of food grains-wheat and  rye--was higher
 than in 1950.  Tne total Crop of unginned cotton was
 above NiO and higher than in the preceding years.
 The sugar beet harvest was above 1950 and exceeded
 27 million tons.
 The area sown to all crops in 1951 was 6.7 million
 hectares above 1950.  The area under cotton, sugar
 beet, sunflower , and other industrial crops expanded.
 Sowing of perennial and annual grasses. fodder root
 crops and silo crops increased considerably.
 The collective farms and state (aims successfully
 fulfilled the plan for sowing winter crops  for the 19f2
 harvest. T .e area p'ougacd in autumn for sowing of
 spring crops in 1952 was 5.4 million hectares above
 that ploughed in the autumn (& 1950.
 The technical foundation of agriculture grew still
 stronger in 11951.
 Last year agriculture received 137,000 tractors in
 terms of 15 It. p. units, 53,000 grain combines, including
 29,000 self-propelled, 59,000 lorries as well as two million
 soil cultivating implements, sowing, harvesting and other
 agricultural machines.
 The increase in technical facilities of agriculture
 made it possible still further to mechanise agricultural
 work in the collective farms and state farms.  The
 agricultural work done  by the machine and tractor
 stations for tlhe collective farms in 19,51 was 19 per
 cent above 11150.   Last year the machire ana tractor
 stations did more than two-thirds of all the field work
 in the collective farms. Almost the entire ploughing
 and  three-quarters of the sowing in  the collective
 farms were .mechanised ; more than 60 per cent of the
 entire grain area in the collective farms was harvested
 by combines.  In state farms the main agricultural
 work is almost completely mechanised.
 Simultaneously with the mechanisation of agricul-
 ture much work was accomplished for its electrifica-
 tion.  The use of electric power in the treatment of
 grain, preparation of fodder, water supply, milking of
 cows and shearing of sheep in the collective farms,
 increased considerably in 1951.
 The growth of the commonly-ownea livestock in the
 collective farms and state farms continued in 1951.
 The   commonly-owned  collective  farm   animal
 husbandry together with that of the state farms has
 become predominant in the total livestock head. The
 head of commonly-owned livestock in the collective
 farms increased as fellows in 1951 : beef and dairy cattle
 12 per cent. (cows 15 per cent) ; hogs 26 per cent ;
 sheep and goats 8 per cent and horses 8 per cent. The
 amount of poultry in the collective farms increased one
 kind a half times.
 Last year the head of beef and dairy cattle in the
 ,tate farms of the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR
 increased 15 per cent. (cows 1.1 per cent) ; hogs 21 per
 rent ; sheep and goats I I per cent and horses 14 per
 cent.  The amount of poultry in  the state farms
 increased 27 per cent.
 The total head of livestock in all categories of eco-
 nomies--in collective farms and state farms, of collec-
 tive farmers and factory and factory and office workers
 increased in 1951 almost by 14 million head, including
 more than 1,600,000 head of beef and dairy cattle,
 2,600,000 hogs, 3,500,000 sheep and goats and almost
 1,000,000 head of horses.  The amount of poultry
 increased by more than 60 million during the year.
 The collective farms, forestries, machine and tractor
 and afforestations, as well as state farms in the steppe
 and foreststeppe areas of the  European part of the
 USSR planted shelter belts on an area of 745,000
 hectares in 1951.
 5. Growth of Railway, Water and Road Traffic
 hail freight carriage plan for 1951 was overfulfilled
 and was 12 per cent higher than in 1950.  The general
 plan for average daily carloadings was fulfilled 103 per
 cent.
 The target set by the state plan for accelerating out
 aid return time of cars was overfulfrlled in the past
 year.  Fuel expcrditure per ton-km. on the railways
 was 3 per cent less than in 1950.  However, the target
 to improve exploitation of railways was rot fully accom-
 plished..
 The annual plan of freigl_t carriage by inland water
 transport was fulfilled in 1951 by 100.6 percent and
 freight carriage was 13 per cent higher than in I950.
 The marine freight carriage plan in 1951 was fulfilled
 102 per cent and freight carriage was S per cent higher
 than in 1950.
 Automobile height carriage was 20 per cent higher
 thar, in 1950.
 6. Increase of Capital Investments in National
 Economy
 In 1951 a broad construction programme was ac-
 complished.  The volume of state capital investments
 in the past year was 112 per cent of 1950. The volume
 of state capital investments in construction of electric
 stations was 140 per cent of 1950, in iron and steel and
 non-ferrous metals industry-120 per cent, in coal and
 oil industry-112 per cent, in building materials in-
 dustry-135 per cent, in machine and tractor stations
 and state farms- 106 per cent, in transport--103 per
 cent, in housing construction-120 per cent.
 The 1951 assignments for building of large hydro-
 technical installations on the Volga, Don and Dnieper
 and also for building of the Main Turkmen Canal
 were successfully fulfilled.
 In 1951 the building organisations received a large
 quantity-of highly productive machinery and equip-
 ment.  The existing fleet of excavators increased almost
 40 per cent as against. 1950, scrapers---more than 30

 Approved For Release 2002/01/17 : CIA-RDP83-00415RO13000010003-2
 per cent and bulldozers-more than 80 per cent, and
 the fleet of other building machinery and equipment
 was also considerably augmented.  All-round mecha-
 nisation of building work is being ever more widely
 introduced on construction projects. Supply of build-
 ing materials improved.
 In 1951 the building organisations reduced cost of
 construction and curtailed time of construction as com-
 pared with 1950. However, many organisations did not
 fully secure the fulfilment of the targets set by the state
 for the reduction of cost of construction.
 State enterprises, institutions and local Soviets as
 well as the population of cities and workers' settlements
 with the help of state credits built dwelling houses of a
 total floor space of 27,000,000 square metres.  Besides,
 about 400,000 houses were built in rural localities.
 7. Expansion of Soviet Trade
 Further expansion of Soviet trade continued in
 1051. Owing to the new successes attained in 1050 in
 the development of industry and agriculture, the rise of
 labour productivity and lowering of production costs,
 beginning with March 1, 1951 the government carried
 through a new, the fourth successive reduction in state
 prices of goods of general consumption, since the aboli-
 tion of rationing.  The new reduction of prices resulted
 in a further strengthening of the Soviet ruble, in raising
 its purchasing power and in further increasing sales of
 goods to the population.
 In the course of 1951, state and co-operative retail sales
 to the population, measured in comparative prices, were
 15 per cent higher than in 1950.  Sale of individual
 items increased as follows : meat-32 per cent, sausage
 ---29 per cent, fish products-14 per cent, butter-10
 per cent, vegetable oil--40 per cent, milk and dairy
 products-35 per cent, eggs-20 per cent, sugar-29
 per cent, confectionery-13 per cent, tea--29 per cent,
 fruit 33-per cent, cotton fabrics-18 per cent, silk
 fabrics-26 per cent, garments-14 per cent, leather
 footwear-11 per cent, furniture.-50 per cent, build-
 ing materials :for the population-45 per cent, house-
 hold and toilet soap-13 per cent, radio sets---26 per
 cent, clocks and watches-15 per cent, sewing machines
 -29 per cent, cameras-38 per cent, bicycles-86 per
 cent.  Sales of frigidaires, washing machines and
 vacuum cleaners increased several times over.
 The network of state and co-operative trade ex-
 panded.                      In 1951 about 8,000 new shops opened.
 In 1951 sale to the population of agricultural pro-
 duce in the collective farm markets, especially of flour,
 cereals, lard, :fowl, eggs, fruit and honey, increased
 appreciably as against 1950.
 4. Increase in Number of Factory and Office
 Workers and in Labour Productivity
 The number of factory and office workers in the
 national economy of the USSR amounted to 40.8
 million at the end of 1951 and was 1,600,000 above the
 level at the end of 1950. The number of workers and
 office employees in industry, agriculture and forestry,
 construction and transport services increased during
 the year by 1,250,000, in educational, scientific re-
 search and medical institutions almost 250,000, in trade,
 housing and public utilities more than 100,000.
 As in previous years there was no unemployment in
 the country in 1951.
 Last year, 365,000 young persons graduated as
 skilled workers from trade, railway, mining and factory
 schools and were given jobs in industry, building cons-
 truction and on the transport.
 With the help of individual or brigade instruction or
 training courses on the job 7,000,000 workers and other
 employees acquired skills or improved their qualifica-
 tions.
 The prductivity of labour of industrial workers was
 10 per cent higher in 1951 than in 1950-it was 14 per
 cent higher in the machine-building industry, 9 per
 cent in the iron and steel industry, 6 per cent in the
 non-ferrous metals industry, 8 per cent in the coal in-
 dustry, 9 per cent in the oil industry and 9 per cent in
 the chemical industry. The productivity of labour in
 construction was 9.5 per cent higher in 1951 than in
 1950.
 9. Cultural Development, Public Health and
 City Improvement
 In 1951 further achievements were attained in all
 fields of socialist culture.
 Last year, the number of people studying in the
 USSR, including all forms of study, amounted  to
 57,000,000.
 The number of seven-year and secondary schools
 increased by almost 5,000 during the year.  The number
 of students in the 5th-10th grades of these schools in-
 creased 2,500,000.
 In 1951, 887 higher educational establishments
 (including correspondence institutions, had a student
 body of 1,356,000 or 108,000 more t ian in 1950.
 Three thousand five hundred forty-three technical
 and other specialised secondary schools  (including
 correspondence institutions)  had  1,384,000 students,
 86,000 more than in 1950.
 In 1951, higher educational establishments graduat-
 ed 201,000 and technical schools 262,000 young special.
 ists.
 The number of graduates of higher educational es-
 tablishments and technical schools engaged as specialists
 in the national economy increased in 1.951, 8 per cent
 compared with 1950.
 In 1951 more than 24,000 people were doing post-
 graduate work in higher educational establishments
 and scientific institutions.
 For outstanding works in science, invention, litera-
 ture and art Stalin prizes were merited in 1951 by
 2,694 scientists, engineers, agronomists, writers and
 artists, workers and foremost agriculturists.
 In 1951 the country had more than 350,000 libraries
 of all types maintained by the state and public organi-
 sations, their number of books exceeding 700 million.

 l'he.nurnber of cinema installations in 1951 increas-
 cd by 4,000 compared with the preceding year.  The
 attendance of theatres and cinemas in 1951 was 12
 per cent above 1950.
 In the summer of 1951 more than 5,000,000 children
 and juveniles stayed in Pioneer camps, children's sana-
 toria, excursion and tourist centres or were taken in an
 organised way for the entire summer period to country
 places bykindergartens, children's homes and nurseries.
 The network of hospitals, maternity homes, dispen-
 siaries and other health institutions as well as sanatoria
 and rest homes was further expanded in 1951.  The
 number of beds in hospitals and maternity homes in-
 creased by almost 50,000 compared with 1950.                        The
 number of places in sanatoria and rest homes increased
 by 18,001).  In 1951 there was over 6 per cent more
 physicians than in 1950.
 The production of medicines, medical instruments
 and equipment increased by 36 per cent compared with
 1950, which made possible: a substantial improvement
 in the supply and outfitting of medical institutions with
 medicines, latest apparatus, laboratory equipment and
 medical instruments.
 In 1951, like in preceding year, considerable work
 was done to build public utilities and improve towns ar_d
 workers' settlements, to construct water  works and
 sewage, extend tram and trolley bus services, provide
 gas and heat to more homes, plant greenery, pave
 and  asphalt city streets and squares, lay out parks,
 gardens and boulevards.
 10. Growth of National Income and Incomes
 of Population
 In 19511 the national income of the USSR, measured
 in comparable prices, increased by 12 per cent com-
 pared with 1950.
 In the Soviet Union the entire national ncome be-
 longsto the working people.  Like in the preceding year
 the working people of the USSR received about three-
 quarters of the national income to meet their personal
 material and cultural requirements,  while the other
 part of the national income remained at the disposal of
 the state, collective farms and co-operative organisa-
 tions for expanding socialist production and for other
 needs of the state as a whole and society.
 The growth of the national income made it possible
 substantially to improve the material position of the
 workers, peasants and intelligentsia and to ensure the
 further expansion of' socialist production in town and
 countryside.
 The improvement of the material position of the
 USSR population was expressed in the growth of the
 monetary and real wages of the factory and office
 workers and in the increase  of the incomes of the
 peasants both from commonly conducted collective
 farming and from their household plots and personal
 husbandry.
 Besides, in 1951, as in preceding years the popula
 tion received at the expense of the state allowances and
 grants from social insurance funds for the factory and
 office workers; pensions from the social maintenance
 fund ; accommodations in sanatoria, rest homes and
 children's institutions free of charge or at reduced rates ;
 allowances to mothers of large families  and lone
 mothers ; free medical aid ; free education and pro-
 fessional and trade instruction ; students' stipends and a
 number of other benefits and privileges.  Further, all
 factory and office workers, i.e., about 41,000,000 people,
 received paid vacations of not less than two weeks, and
 more in case of workers in a number of professions.
 In 1951, these benefits and privileges received by the
 population at the expense of the state amounted to
 125,000 million rubles.
 As a result of the reduction of prices of consumer
 goods, the growth in monetary wages of the factory and
 office workers, increased incomes of the peasants in
 money and in kind and growth in the benefits and pri-
 vileges received by the population at the expense of the
 state-the incomes of factory and office workers and
 incomes of the peasants, measured in comparable prices,
 were 10 per cent greater in 1951 than in 1950.

 When Shevchenko was twenty-tour
 his freedom was bought for him by
 his Russian [fiends and, a painter
 of talent, he was enrolled a+ the
 Academy  of  Arts  in St. 1 eters-
 burg.
 'I'kr.e him covers twenty years of
 Shevchenko's life, beginning with
 1841., after his graduation, from the
 Academy of Arts and return to the
 Ukraine. His activity in the Ukraine
 is shown against the background of
 important events of the time, and
 brings  out  the  close,   inviolable
 tics that bound the universally--
 recognized                         national  poet  of the
 IJkraisn.e with the toiling masses. In
 poetry reflecting the feelings of the
 serf peasantry crushed by bondage
 to the landlord and reduced to the
 position  of`  slaves,   Shcvchenko
 preached merciless hatred for opres-
 sors--- from the tsar to the landlords-
 and called upon the people                forcibly
 to overthrow despotism. Passionate
 and  impetuous,  hating     tyranny
 with all his heart and soul, ready
 at any moment to take up arms
 against the oppressors of the corn- l
 inrnz people----such was Slievchenkro
 in real life, and thu. do we see him
 on the screen.
 For his literary activity and his
 participation  in  a  secret political
 society  Slievchcnko   aroused the
 hatred. of the tsar satraps and the re-
 actionary landowners of the Ukraine.

 A Short Story By F. KNORRE
 (Concluded)
 The first part of this short story "The First Month" by
 F. Knorre appeared in our issue No. 1, 1952.
 The story depicts an event in the life of a common
 worker.
 ti Stankus, an unemployed worker met near a way side
 station a young lad Laonas who was going to Ozerno for a
 job. Stankus was very sceptical about the whole idea, but
 when Laonas showed him the post card giving informa-
 tion about jobs he jumped up and rushed with the lad to
 get into a  train going to Ozerno.  Stanku's one worry
 s was that they would arrive too late and what ever jobs were
 there would be taken up by the first corners.  All his past
 experience of jobs lost, casual work, long periods of un-
 employment, humiliations and insults warned him against
 being sure of getting a job easily.
 In the course of conversation Laonas tells Stankus of
 what be had heard about the new times where there would
 be  no  unemployment.  Stankus  did not  believe that
 there could be any place in the world without unemploy-
 ment.                           Laonas told him about the law in Soviet Union
 where the `The right to work' was guaranteed.    He also
 told him about their country Lithuania which had joined
 the Soviet Union and as such had the same laws applicable
 to them.
 When they reached Ozerno, Stankus rushed out like
 mad to reach the construction works.  In the way he saw a
 placard asking for hands in the  construction works.

 a
 an
 to
 s was tear
 ng
 down the placard and when he asked for an explanation
 Stankus told him that he did not want a crowd of workers
 to follow on their tracks for the same jobs.
 They both got jobs and started working.  Stankus had
 never specialized  in any job and he could do a little
 of everything, but nothing well.
 Now read on :
 This was simply because for years he had been shifted
 from one conveyor to another against his will, working on
 a machine in a rubber factory and  then  on  a  semi-
 automatic lathe in a plant producing farm machinery,
 and in the months between washing  the windows of
 skyscrapers, taking care of mules or picking strawberries.
 The foreman, old man Zhukauskas, under whom Stankus
 worked as assistant repair mechanic, realized the sort of
 man he had under him, but kept him on the job, handing
 in a satisfactory report on his work.  This he did partially
 through weakness of character and partially he was sorry
 for this mature, thirty-five-year-old worker who tried and
 hurried with all his might, endeavouring to use his sharp
 wits to conceal his lack of skill and evidently fearing that it
 would be discovered.
 They had just taken apart a' defective engine.  Each
 time Stankus bent. down to lay the greasy, worn-out parts in
 order on a. board, his head swam oddly.
 He had caught cold in the freight car and had felt limp
 and giddy several times.  The queer feeling had grown
 worse in the last two days, so that all he wanted to do was to
 sit down and cover his eyes.  More than anything else
 Stankus feared that the foreman would notice it.  Bad luck
 like this had pursued him all his life.  No sooner did he get
 a decent job than something happened.  He realized very
 well that Zhukauskas had been very displeased with his work
 the first few days and he had kept waiting for the old devil
 to go and tell the boss and then fire him. And now, when
 things seemed to be going much better; he had to start
 running a temperature.
 Clenching his teeth, he walked out to the gate, hoping
 that the fresh air would make him feel better.  He lit a
 cigarette but after holding it in his hand he threw it away
 in disgust.  It was painfully hot in the sun, the wall against
 which Stankus leaned was hot, and the grass with the fresh
 chips scattered over it looked hot in the sun.
 The old devil (he liked Zhukauskas, but Stankus always
 called him " old devil " because he was, all the same the
 foreman, the boss, and that meant sooner or later you could
 expect something dirty from him) . . . the old devil would
 notice that he was ill and would send him to the office, and
 Stankus wouldn't make it to the end of the week and pay-
 day !  Then, worse luck, he'd be in bed a few days and
 . . . goodbye job !  Another man would take his place !
 No, he'd hold out through tomorrow if he busted.  And
 tomorrow was Saturday.  He'd hold out another day, and
 on Sunday he'd be able to lie in bed the whole day. He'd
 ask Laonas to pour pailfuls of cold water over his head.
 He shook himself and returned to the shop, where he sat
 down on the floor, his legs crossed.
 Looks like something's the matter with you," remarked
 the foreman.
 "Lobster-eyed devil," Stankus muttered to himself. To
 the foreman he said hurriedly in a loud voice : " Nothing at
 all, foreman, nothing at all ! It's nothing, just the heat and
 those chips, maybe ! "
 " Chips, did you say ? " asked Zhukauskas in amazement.
 Stankus himself realized he'd said something silly.  He
 laughed.  " No," he said with a laugh. " What have chips
 to do with it ? "
 " Listen, you didn't have too much to drink, did you ? "
 the foreman asked anxiously.
 That seemed like a wonderful idea to Stankus.
 " Please forgive me, foreman," he said.  " I did.  My
 head's still aching from last night." He even tried to wink.
 64 It'll go away in a minute.  There's nothing to it."
 He bent over the dismantled engine, stooping lower
 than he had intended, picked up the wrench and silently
 got down to work.  But the foreman kept standing over
 him, looking at him, the devil.
 " And your face is red," he persisted.  " You're not ill,
 are you ? "
 "Everything's all right, foreman, thank you, everything's
 all right," Stankus pleaded, simmering with rage.
 " Nothing's all right.  Here now, go over to the dis-
 pensary, do you hear ? Go and have a doctor look at you."
 Stankus bent his head and went on working stubbornly.
 He did not answer until the old man shook him by the
 shoulder and forced him to rise.
 Then he stood up, flung the wrench onto the ground,
 and gazed with hatred into Zhukauskas' worried face.
 " That's not honest on your part, foreman ! " he ex-
 claimed.  " Honest to God, it's not honest to act like that.

 What are you driving me out for ? What business is it of
 yours what my face looks like ? Did I refuse to work ? I'm
 working, and you leave me alone ! "
 He was in a bad state ; his mouth was dry, and a heavy
 hand seemed to be pressing against the insides of his eyes.
 M-. turned aside and walked off, picking up his feet with
 difficulty. Suddenly he bumped against something with his
 shoulder so that he staggered, and of course after that
 there was no sense arguing any longer.
 " All right," he said roughly'.  " I'll go to the doc, and
 he'll tell you I can work.  Who are you, foreman or doc ?
 Don't stick your nose in what isn't your business."
 As he was crossing the construction site where the car-
 penters were squaring logs, he was struck with revulsion at
 the thought that they were making still more chips like those
 ,tattered all around.   Halfway across he turned  around,
 returned and shouted defiantly :
 " Hey there, foreman ! Don't forget to mark down half a
 day's work to me.   I did work half a day !   Don't you
 go playing any tricks on me !
 He talked and argued about something in the dispensary,
 although it was hard for him to sit up and he ceased to
 nnnderstand what lie was arguing about or what. he wanted.
 IIt- vaguely felt that things were very bad ; he was in for it,
 his illness couldn't be concealed...
 His temperature proved to be extremely high.  He was
 taken by the arm and led off somewhere. Only after several
 days of delirium and black periods when his memory was a
 blank, did Stankus come to himself, weak and completely
 indifferent to everything
 His cheeks pale and s.
 unken, Stankus sat on the hospital
 veranda with the other convalescents, absorbed in a game of
 dominoes.
 Through the leaves of the wild gravevine half covering
 the window the little hospital courtyard was visible flooded
 with bright sunshine. Senior nurse Lily, erect and graceful
 in her starched white uniform, crossed the courtyard from
 the dressing station.  A long-eared puppy sleeping in the
 shade rose and lazily followed her across the hot stones.
 The whole scene was familiar, an everyday scene.
 But now it was coming to an end, all of it-the clean
 linen., the regular meals, the doctor listening attentively
 through his stethescope as though some precious instrument
 were hidden in Stankus' breast, the domino games and the
 long hours of rest in an armchair on the veranda.  All this
 would soon be coming to an end.  The thought of it sent
 cold shivers down Stankus' back. After such a life of luxury
 +pz;ain freight cars or sleeping in the park ? It did not bear
 chinking of!
 Nurse Lily again crossed. the courtyard and suddenly
 turned to the veranda.  He slapped down a domino and
 crew tense, not turning around.
 Oh, Stankus," she said.  " You haven't forgotten we're
 (i hchargi ig you today, have you ? "
 She smiled as she said this, and the three who were
 playing dominoes with him also smiled and looked at him
 AS if it was his birthday, the fools
 " No, of course I haven't," he exclaimed cheerfully.
 Can't wait to get back home ! "
 If they thought he should be glad then he'd show them
 lcce was. damn them !
 " Perhaps you'd like to come along with me now? Or
 tb  you prefer to wait till dinner ? "
 " Why, it's all the same to me whether it's now or in an
 !anon." - He shrugged his shoulders.  " Certainly, if it is
 more convenient for you now. . .  I'll be glad to.  We'll
 just finish this game. , . "
 When Stankus received his washed linen, jacket and
 trousers, and put on clumsy, hard boots instead of the soft
 house slippers he had worn in the hospital, he suddenly felt
 weak, miserable and alone.
 " I've given you a lot of trouble ! " he said to Nurse
 Lily in parting.
 " That's our work," the nurse replied kindly. " It wasn't
 any trouble at all. Keep well, Stankus,"
 Stankus felt the most gratitude toward her for the fact
 that she did not immediately slam the door after him.
 He reached the house where he lived.  The old witch
 stared at him in surprise but let him in.  Laonas' cot was
 covered with a new blanket.  " Making a home for him-
 self," Stankus thought ironically as he flung himself onto the
 cot.
 When Laonas returned from work he found his friend in
 a black mood.  As he entered the door his face broke into a
 smile, shook Stankus' hand joyfully, and sat down on the
 edge of the bed at his feet.
 " Well, how are you feeling ? All :right ?
 " Not bad.     Well enough for the coming trip, at any
 rate."
 " Have you really decided to leave ? That's too bad
 Laonas said.
 " There's nothing for it...  That's the way it is with rne,
 and that's all.  Horrible habit.  Want a change of impres-
 sions, don't you see !  Beautiful scenery, interesting people,
 and so on and so forth ! "
 " Yes, I see," agreed Laonas in a puzzled, despondent
 voice.  " But I'm used to'our being together... "
 "; You. are ? . . You're a good fellow, and we ought to
 say goodbye properly.  Here, take this and run down to
 the corner.  My treat. Take it! "
 Laonas stared at the money  irresolutely, took it un-
 willingly and went out.
 The money that Stankus had given, him for vodka was
 almost the last he had, and drinking vodka right after the
 hospital was probably no good. That's what urged him on.
 It didn't matter if there was no money and drinking was
 bad for him.  Let it be bad !
 Laonas drank in the country fashion ; the full glass of
 the stuff went down slowly, like water, without disgust and
 without the slightest bravado-without grunting, pounding
 on the table, or exclamations.  In a burning stream the
 vodka flowed through  his body, reached his heart, and
 Laonas gave a sigh.   Then it reached his tongue, and he
 started talking.
 "' There won't be another comrade like you . . . who
 understands everything... and who's seen everything." He
 gave a deep sigh.  " And who sympathizes....
 "' Things are bad with me, my lad," said Stankus. " Old
 age is approaching.  What ?  You think old age comes
 with a bent back ?    Nonsense ! Old age is when a man
 begins to think and meditate, and suddenly he realizes that
 he doesn't feel that real rage which makes him fight with all
 and everyone for his piece of bread.   Then it's the end for
 him, even though he still has the strength, the way I have.
 Do you understand ? "
 Laonas nodded with such sympathy that the curls on his
 forehead bobbed.
 " Of course I do ! "
 " You  don't  understand  anything.  But  listen  and

 answer. Who's working in my place now ... for that old
 turnip Zhukauskas, iri the repair shop ? "
 " Who ? " Laonas tried to remember.  " Ah-a fellow
 with a moustache, he's from Panevezhis. I don't know his
 name, but he has a little moustache....
 " All right, the hell with him and his moustache. Now,
 what would a real man do in my place ? He'd wait for that
 fellow with the moustache after work in the evening, and
 have a talk with him.  A sincere, frank talk with him.
 He'd explain to him that the place was already taken, it
 wasn't his.  And that the fellow could go to hell.  And if
 lie got stubborn, he'd let him have it on the chin.  And
 then he'd go to the foreman and say : ' Mr. Foreman, your
 repairman, the old polecat, isn't coming to work, so take me
 back."
 Laonas opened his mouth wide.  " Really ? " he ex-
 claimed.
 " Absolutely ! I remember an instance in Pennsylvania,
 or maybe Oklahoma, can't say for sure, but the guy was
 called Boogy.  Something like a boxer, he was.  When he
 was fired and they took someone else in his place, he waited
 for his happy successor every  evenirg and beat him up.
 The other fellow was pretty puny, but he held out six days,
 although he was all covered with bruises.  Until finally
 Boogy sprained his wrist for him. Then the foreman turned
 him out in 24 seconds, and Boogy was right there on the
 spot.  Everything seemed to be fine.  But the nextday the
 nephew of the foreman's wife was working in the place of the
 fellow ? with the sprained wrist.  Boogy went home, his
 huge fists clenched, and he kept repeating words that made
 the truck drivers shudder, and a policeman whom he passed
 turned his back and started admiring the flowers in a
 window.  Finally Boogy ran into the man whose wrist he
 had sprained just as the latter was moving some household
 goods and his wife and two kids out of their apartment into
 a vacant lot.  Then Boogy realized instantly why he'd
 endured those beatings for six days, and something began
 to turn over inside him.  The man with the sprained
 wrist saw him and said :
 ` Look here, don't you see that I'm walking with my
 wife and my wrist's sprained ? '
 " It's a little bit late but I see ! " Boogy answered, and
 he said : " Honest to God, I'd smash in the mug of the one
 who gave you that sprained wrist if I could, but you know
 why I can't.'
 " ` I know, only get away from me ! ' said the guy with
 the wife.
 " ` All I can say is that if I got work now,' said Boogy,
 ` I'd give all my pay to your family.'
 " ` Maybe I believe you,' said the puny fellow, `but
 now get away from me quick ! '
 " And Boog.y said : `All right, I'm off,' and he gave the
 man's wife a low blow  and went home, right down the
 middle of the street.  And his eyes flashed white.  He was
 thinking of how to find the one who was really to blame and
 kill him or at least cripple him !
 " Anci'that's the end for a man.   If you start thinking
 whether the fellow who shoved you out of a job has a
 children or an anemic, pregnant wife or a wrinkled old
 grandmother then your'e done for ! You won't have that
 rage.  There was a time when my cars flapped, and I ran
 along with my tail between my legs, ready to lick any
 hand that didn't have a stick in it.  And I imagined that I
 would work as hard as I could and I would find a boss who
 would be touched by my industry.      Then everything would
 be perfectly wonderful ! " Stankus threw himself back in
 his chair.  Laughter and a fit of coughing shook him to such
 a degree that he could not strike a match for his cigarette.
 " It can't be you never found a kind boss ! " the lad ex-
 claimed apprehensively.
 " A kind boss ? " Stankus repeated between coughs.
 Finally he got his cigarette lit, raised it to his eyes, and
 studied it attentively.  " There are no kind bosses.  No,
 my boy, there aren't ! " Stankus shouted bitterly, dropping
 his cigarette onto the table, then picking it up mechanically
 and sticking it into his mouth unlit, but forgetting to puff
 on it.  " It's true that some bosses are kind men. But
 there's no such thing as a kind boss.  What is a boss? To
 you, as long as you work for him-one of he tl.ousar_ds in
 his factory or the dozens on his farm-he's everth.ing, Le's
 God! But to other bosses., the bigger ones, he himself is only
 a pawn.  See ? He also needs all his rage and fear and hard-
 heartedness so that others won't crush him, won't eat him
 up, the ones that are more cruel and bad than he is."
 Laonas shook his head gloomily, agreeing and doubting
 at the same time.
 Realizing that he  wasn't smoking, Stankus started to_,
 puff hard on his cigarette.  Laonas kept sighing as he con-
 centrated on smearing a bit of split vodka over the table
 with his finger.  Suddenly he smiled, his artless face lit up
 with a kind of cunning joy.                           ,..,
 "Oh ! " he exclaimed as Le raised his finger.  " That
 means it's fine.  That means it's really . . . It's really fine
 that we don't have any bosses any more.  No bosses at all,
 neither kind ones nor bad ones. .. Right ? "
 Right... But still, there are chiefs just the same
 " Chiefs ! But how can you do without a chief ? You've
 got to have one. Hill, a chief ! But he is an engineer. Of course
 he's got to be over me, since he understands and I don't ! "
 " That's right, he's an engineer.   And you're not an
 engineer.  And you'll never be an engineer.  That's what
 it's all about, booby."
 " All right, maybe I'm a booby. But I'm going to study
 and then maybe I won't be a booby any more."
 " That's the thing-study.  You said it.      But how ? "
 "Well, I'm studying a little already,"               And Laonas
 smiled shyly.
 Stankus waved his hand in front of his eyes to drive
 away the smoke so he could get a better look at his comrade's
 face..
 " You ? But who needs your studying ? What are they
 teaching you rabbits ? Read soul-saving pamphlets to you,
 do they ? Or teach you to sing psalms in chorus ?"
 " Why no, I want to learn to be a machine operator.
 To tell the truth, I didn't dare think about it, but then I got
 so worked up I went and asked. It turned out I could study.
 It turns out that they need as many operators as possible.
 Machine operators get much better pay. And if you. have a
 head on your shoulders you can go on studying further."
 " Is your head clear ?  Not seeing double, are you ?
 No, I'm serious.  Maybe you're not used to drinking ? "
 "Well, maybe I did have a drop, but my copybooks are
 lying over there. I didn't dream them."
 " Well, let's . see. " Star kus distrustfully picked up a
 copybook and opened it. He held it out at arm's length,
 screwed up his eyes and began to read suspiciously. " The
 work cycle of the engine. Internal combustion engine,"
 he read aloud, and then continued to read to himself, grin-
 ning craftily as much as to say, We'll soon find out where
 the trick is !  Just wait ! .

 Ile leafed through the copybook for a long time.  He
 looked at the very end. Then he carefully closed it and put
 it. back.
 " So.  That's fine. If it weren't, Stankus wouldn't say
 it was.  You've been damned lucky and I'm glad for you."
 Maybe you'll change your mind about going? What
 do you want to keep travelling for?" Laonas exclaimed with
 new energy.
 " And what am I going to do here if I stay, if you're so
 clever ? "
 " What do you want new scenery for ? The hell with
 scenery ! What do you want to leave a good job for just
 because of some kind of scenery ?  Honestly, I'm asking
 you like a friend... "
 " What are you talking about ? You yourself said some-
 one else was working in my place, a fellow with a moustache."
 " So what ? You weren't fired !    There's a job waiting
 for you.  No, nothing of the sort, I'm not drunk.  No
 matter how much you shake me I'm still not drunk and I
 know I'm not.  There's a law like that: if a man's sick he
 can't be fired. He's even paid something for the time he's
 ,fut.  I know what I'm saying.     Stop shaking me. I
 myself couldn't believe it at first ! "
 " What are you trying to tell me ? That I can go over
 there tomorrow just as though 1 hadn't been out a month
 and say, ` Hello, foreman, I feel better.  Let's have some
 work? '  And he won't think they' ve let me out of a mad-
 house ? "
 Yes, that's what you have to say.  Only a little more
 politely. Where are you going ? "
 Without paying any attention to him, Stankus rose.
 " Come on out into the yard ! " he said pulling him by
 the arm.
 As always, Laonas obediently followed his comrade,
 1.!;rinning, a little anxiously.
 Stankus moved a big wash-tub over to the edge of the
 well and poured in two pailfuls of water.
 " Now then together ! " he ordered, preparing to plunge
 his head into the tub.
 " But I'll sober up right away," Laonas protested.
 " It's a pity to waste all that vodka. Let's stay drunk an-
 other half hour at least ! "
 Stankus imperiously took him by the collar and they
 thrice plunged their heads into the water, the first time
 separately and the next two times together. Snorting and
 puffing, they rose and faced each other, wiping off the water
 on their necks and shaking off the water running down their
 collars.
 " Has it passed ? " asked Stankus, looking at his friend
 closely.
 " All gone, just as though it had never been ! " declared
 Laonas regretfully.
 They sat down on a log, leaned back against the edge
 of the well, and lit up.
 " Well, how is it row ? " asked Stankus. " Let's get the
 thing clear.  You have copybooks.  That means it's a fact,
 doesn't it ?  Yes, it does.  And do you remember what
 else you said ? "
 " Of course I do."
 " That I wasn't fired and that I have a job ? That I'm
 sitting here and it's waiting for me ?
 " It's a fact ! "
 Stankus again looked him closely in the face.  Then
 he propped up his chin in his hands and sat silent for a
 long time.  Finally he said slowly and thoughtfully. '
 " I've travelled a long time, my lad, a hell of a long time
 . . . And not always by the shortest route, it seems. But
 it looks like I've finally come exactly where I want to. I
 do believe this is the very spot I looked for all over the world.
 I swear it is ! "

 proving that grains of wild oats, the most pernicious
 weed of oats, are formed in the panicle of the latter.
 On being sown the seeds gave rise to wild oats.
 This important discovery of  Michurin  science
 throws new light on the problem of weed control. Not
 only mechanical admixtures should be had in mind but
 also biological admixtures arising from the formation
 of separate weed seeds in the ears of cultivated plants.
 This is primarily the result of poor agrotechnique and
 of particularly unfavourable conditions for the growth
 and development of cultivated plants.  If the soil is
 cultivated well, if there is a sufficient amount of fertiliz-
 ers and the seeds are carefully selected then the varied
 qualities of the cultivated plants are improved and their
 productivity is increased.  On the contrary, if the con-
 dition.s of the plant's growth are poor, cells and tissues
 are formed in the organism which give rise to seeds of
 another species better adapted to the poor conditions
 of growth than the cultivated plants.
 New developments in the teachings about the biolo-
 gical species, the discoveries of Michurin science, are of
 great significance for the development of socialist agri-
 culture.
 Results of 19th Chess
 Championship of USSR
 By Grandmaster Alexander Kotov
 THE 19th chess championship of the USSR which took place i t Moscow
 and lasted over a month has conic to a close.  It stood cut for the
 unusually high calibre of its participants and for the ken battles
 which lasted to the very last round of the tournament.
 First place in the tournament was  taken by Grandmaster P tu] Keres,
 who scored 12 points out of a possible 17.  Keres has proven I is skill in
 this unusually keen tournament, giving a number of excellc it combi-
 national games.  Ile displayed his readiness to meet his opponet is in com-
 plicated games,  not fearing keen combinational battles.  And that  has
 gained him the country's chess championship for the second year in ;uccession.
 Second and third places, with 112 points, was shared by mass ers Yelim
 Geller (Odessa University student) and Tigran Petrosyan, the youngest
 participant, and holder of Moscow's chess title.   Each of them has scored
 a wonderful success.
 Geller strived for a keen battle in every game, bringing abou  veritable
 combinational storms on the chess board, in which he always tr anaged to
 gain the upper hand.
 Petrosyan's style is more solid.  llis games are planned better.     His
 youth promises big successes in the future.  This is  Petrosyan's third out-
 standing achievement in 1951.
 Fourth place was taken by Grandmaster Vasily Smyslov.   This talent-
 ed and world famous chess player committed a tactical error t,wards the
 close of the competition.  In striving for victories,  he resorted to risky
 play, as a result of which he dropped two consecutive games.  However,
 notwithstanding that setback,  Smyslov achieved considerable results and
 demonstrated outstanding creative achievements.
 Especial note should be made      here of the unsuccessful pc?formances
 of the world champion, Grandmaster Mikhail Botvinnik, and (1: andmaster
 David Bronstein.  Botvinnik placed ]]ft It (10 points i, and Bronst in shared
 si-,-tight places with masters Averbakh and Taimanov (92 points). Botvinnik
 and Bronstein have rarely participated in USSR- tournaments ,luring the
 postwar years, and this has told on their play.
 Such long breaks in practical play and contact: with the talc] ited Soviet
 youth could not but have a negative effect on their creative  performance.
 The underlying power of the Soviet chess players, as of the So% iet people
 as a whole, follows from their constant and strict  self-criticism and Iheir
 ability to overcome shortcomings in (heir creative efforts.

 Under the Banner of Lenin,
 Under the Leadership of Stalin
 By S. Titarenko
 T HE greater the distance separating us from the date
 of the death of V. I. Lenin; the great leader and
 teacher of the working people, the more evident
 is the grandeur of, Lenin's immortal cause, the titanic
 transformative power of the ideas of Leninism.  The
 name of V. I. Lenin is inseparably associated with the
 new era in the liberation struggle :of the peoples, the
 radical turn in world history from the old, capital-
 ist world to the new, socialist world.
 V. I. Lenin was the founder and leader of the heroic
 Party of the Communists, the builders of the new, Com-
 munist society. V. I. Lenin was the organizer of the
 victorious Socialist Revolution in Russia, the founder
 and leader of the world's first Socialist State.
 V. I. Lenin rendered an immense service by elabo-
 rating the most important questions of strategy and
 tactics of the liberation struggle of the international pro-
 letariat. There is not a more or less significant problem
 of the international revolutionary movement on which
 Lenin did not leave most valuable directives which serve
 as a guiding star for the Communist and workers' parties.
 of all countries.
 Lenin's genius illumined to all working mankind
 the path of struggle for the victory of the ideals of Com-
 munism.
 The theory of Leninism has been developed and
 advanced by the great continuator of Lenin's cause,
 J.V. Stalin.  The practical realisation of Lenin's behests
 is associated with Stalin's name.
 In 1924 in the name of the Bolshevik  Party
 J.V. Stalin made the sacred vow over the bier of the un-
 forgettable leader and teacher : to, hold high and guard
 the purity of the great title of member of the Commu-
 nist Party ;.to guard the unity of the' Party as the apple
 of one's-eye  to guard and strengthen the dictatorship
 of the working class.  to strengthen with all might
 the alliance. of the workers and the peasants to promote
 the fraternal cooperation of the peoples of the Land of
 .Soviets  to consolidate and extend the Union of Soviet
 Socialist Republics ; to strengthen the armed forces of
 the Land of Socialism which stand on guard of the
 peaceful constructive labour of the Soviet people ; to
 strengthen and extend the union of the working people
 of the whole world.
 The heroic struggle of the Communist Party and of
 all the Soviet people for the fulfilment of this vow has
 been the keynote of all the years that have elapsed since
 the death of V. I. Lenin. J. V. Stalin raised-high the
 banner of Lenin and inspired the Party and ?all the
 working people of the USSR to the successful construe-
 Lion of Socialism.  Inspired by the great ideals of Lenin
 and Stalin, the Soviet people have successfully coped
 with all the difficulties in the construction of Socialism:
 Within a brief historical period Socialism broi ht
 about unprecedented progress-of:the productive forces,
 science and culture in the Soviet Union.  It has stirred
 up the initiative of millions of working people . and
 awakened them to the conscious creative effort of build-
 ing new  socialist life. Having built the  Socialist
 Society, the Soviet people are now confidently advan-
 cing toward the complete victory of Communism;
 The Great October' Socialist Revolution, the cons=
 truction of Socialism in the USSR and the historic
 victory of the Soviet Union in the war against the.fascist
 aggressors cleared the way for the conquest of a free and
 happy life by the working people of Poland, Czechoslo-
 vakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Albania, who
 have firmly taken to the course of socialist construction.
 The Chinese people have won a great victory  under
 the leadership of their glorious Communist Party they
 have discarded the yoke of imperialism and are effecting
 sweeping democratic reforms.
 The German Democratic Republic has firmly :taken
 its place in the camp,'of democracy and peace. Under
 the banner of Leninism the liberation struggle of"the
 oppressed peoples against imperialist tyranny is,_ gain-
 ing mom en_ tum in the colonies rid de'pehdent count-r-ies.

 International Stalin
 T HE International Stalin Peace Prizes " For the Promotion cf Peace
 Among Nations" (instituted on J. V. Stalin's seventieth birthday by a
 decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S. i.R. of
 December 20, 1949) are awarded annually to citizens of all countries,
 irrespective of their political, religious or racial differences, for outstand-
 ing services  in the struggle to preserve and strengthen peace.  The prizes
 are adjudged by the International Committee, whose members include
 leading representatives of world democratic opinion.
 On December 18-20 the International Committee met in Moscow,
 under the chairmanship of Dmitry Skobeltsyn Member, of the U.S.S.R.
 Academy of Sciences,  to examine the recommendations submitted for
 awards.  The Committee members present were : Louis Aragon, writer
 (France), Dr. John Bernal (Great Britain), Pablo Neruda, poet (Chile),
 Dr. Jan Dembowski (Poland), Academician Mihail Sadoveanu (Rumania),
 Alexander Fadeyev and Ilya Ehrenburg, writers (U.S.S.R.).
 The International Stalin Peace Prizes for 1951 went to the following
 representatives of the democratic forces of various countries :
 Kuo Mo-jo-President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, writer,
 dramatist and historian,  He is the Deputy Premier of the State Adminis-
 trative Council of the Chinese People's Republic and Chairman of the
 All-China Association of Cultural, Literary and Art Workers.  A tireless
 fighter for peace, progress and the independence of peoples, Ku.) Mo-jo
 heads the peace movement in China.
 Pietro Nenni-General Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party and
 Deputy of Parliament. Compelled to flee the country when Mussolini came
 to power, Nenni waged an indomitable struggle against the fascist regime
 during the seventeen years he was in exile.  Arrested in France in 1943,
 he was deported to a penal prison in Italy from which he was released only
 after the downfall of the fascist regime. Nenni's daughter, Vittoria, perished
 in the Auschwitz death camp.  During 1943-47, as Deputy Premier
 and Foreign Minister, Nenni strove to pursue a foreign policy that would
 meet the country's fundamental interests-a policy of peace with all countries,
 both in the West and East.   He played an active part in organic;ing the

 Leninism illumines to the peoples the road in their great and lofty >truggle
 for peace in the whole world, of the freedom and independence of all
 peoples, big and small.
 The 28th anniversary of V. I. Lenin's death finds  the Sovie people
 with new outstanding  victories to their credit in the construction of
 Communism.  Already at the beginning of last: year, the working people
 learned with joy that the first postwar Five-Year Plan for the restoration
 and development of the national economy of the USSR was fulfilled and
 its most important provisions were surpassed.The year 1951 witnessed still
 greater progress of socialist economy and culture.  The national economic
 plan of the USSR for 1951 has been fulfilled        and  in  many respects
 surpassed.  Further successes have been made in strengthening the might
 of the Socialist State, in raising the living and cultural standard;; of the
 Soviet people.
 Inspired by the magnificent Stalin programme of Communist consti uction,
 the Soviet people are coping with the most difficult national economic
 problems. They are  successfully building the world's greatest hydro
 electric stations, canals and irrigation systems; remaking nature in vast
 territories and preparing the ground for a powerful advancement of the
 productive forces in the Land of Socialism which will make  it  possible
 for the Soviet society to inscribe on its barriers: " From each  accord-
 ing to his abilities, to each according to his needs." As distinct                                                     from

 the Jaapanese people to safeguard their country against being drawn into a
 new world slaughter.
 Ini. April 1949, the first National Peace Congress was held in Japan, on
 the initiative of Oyama. This Congress laid the foundation stone of the
 organized peace movement in Japan.

 Blos sours."
 the Soviet Union is directed entirely in the interest of the working people.
 The national income grows year after year furnishing the basis for rise
 in the incomes of the workers, peasants and intellectuals.
 People, the working :masses, are considered the most precious  assei in
 the Land of Soviets, and the welfare and happiness of the people is a
 matter of paramount concern to the Soviet state.
 Noteworthy success in peaceful construction has been  achieved by the
 working people  on  the  People's Democracies.   Benefitting from the
 historical experience of the USSR,the free peoples of these countries are
 successfully building Socialism.  They are developing new  branches
 of production, building new  industrial centres, railways and power
 stations.  The scourge of unemployment has been eradicated, the ranks
 of the working class are growing and the living and cultural standards of
 the working people are being advanced in town and country.
 While the countries of the camp of Socialism and democracy are
 steering along the course of construction  and uninterrupted progress, the
 reactionary circles in  the capitalist world are whipping up the war
 hysteria, converting the economy of their countries to war production
 and   burdening  the    working  people with  an increasingly heavier
 taxation.
 The imperialists are planning new military gambles,  they are trying
 to unleash a third world, war.  But no matter how the warmongers may
 rave in. their frenzy, nc       matter what pacts and blocs they may knock
 together against the peace and security of the peoples, the forces of peace,

 productions of high ideological content, portraying the
 Soviet people's ardour for building and creating, and
 their noble striving for peace and friendship between
 nations.
 Soviet film makers create truthful, life-affirming,
 airtistic productions about Soviet men and women as
 they are building a new life, and their heroism in  the
 Great Patriotic War when  the  entire Soviet people
 rose up in defence of their Homeland and all mankind
 ilgainsi fascism.
 ", Soviet film art has won universal recognition and
 love of the broad masses  because  it  is    profoundly
 Popular.  It exists and develops in the interests of the
 people.   The Soviet cinema industry strives thy each of
 its films to portray live, veracious images of Soviet men
 and women, and to be permeated         with ideas that
 animate the Soviet people, the people-creator, the
 people-fighter  for  peace.  Each  Soviet feature film,
 portraying man's best traits--high morality, nobleness
 'it character,  will power,  boundless devotion. to his
 people,   amiability--inspires the spectator,  by  the
 example of its heroes, calls him to emulate the best and
 most beautiful in life, and stirs the creative energy of
 the millions.   It is this which primarily distinguishes
 Soviet, cinema art from bourgeois film-making which,
 with a few exceptions, distorts life, distorts human
 nature, stuffing its pictures with sensational, intimate
 and vulgar trivialities ; with propaganda of gangsterism
 and misanthropy ; and with premeditated falsification
 of historical and biographical facts.
 Soviet cinema art is growing and developing as a
 c ultinational art.  There are national film studios in
 practically all the Union Republics of the USSR: in
 Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan,  Georgia, Azer-
 baija.n,  Armenia,                           Ukraine.,   Byelorussia,  and the
 Baltic Soviet republics.  And each Union republic has
 developed native producers, scenario writers, actors and
 :ximeramen. Each national studio puts out its films in
 the. language of its republic, which are later dubbed
 into the languages of all the other republics.   Many
 of the national studios have put out cinema productions
 ankiug among the best and most popular Soviet films.
 Besides feature pictnn's, in the USSR  at-  widely
 produced documentaries and topical newsreel,. There
 is a Central Document a v?  Film  Studio in Moscow
 which puts out full-length films as well as news serials :
 " News of the Day," " Soviet Sports," and a special
 news serial for children "Soviet Pioneeria." Tien there
 are documentary film studios also in the cs.pitals of
 all the Union republics. In addition to this, there
 are film new,, shooting stations in many cit es.  The
 camera men send their shots to the Central Documen-
 tary Film Studio in Moscow and this mater al is used
 in the" News of the Day "serial. The national studios
 put out news reels in  the language of the given
 republic.
 " Widespread,  too, in  the Soviet  Union  are
 popular scientific films. There are in the USSR four
 popular scientific film studios : in Moscow, Leningrad,
 Kiev and Sverdlovsk.   These studios put out films
 propagating the major  whievements of the Land of
 Socialism in science and technology,  bring to the
 broadest masses of the wrn?king people graphic news of
 the latest technical developments,  and faci itate  the
 application in industry, on the Firm, etc., of various
 improvements proposed by innovators and rarionalizers
 of' production.  The  Moscow  popular-scientific   film
 studio, besides full-lengtli pictures, puts ou; monthly
 serials :   " Science  and Technology,"  and  " Farm
 News."
 There is in the Soviet.  Union also  an animated
 cartoon     film  studio. Its pictures,  in  colour, are
 deservedly  popular     nw only  with the      youthful
 spectator, but with adults as well."
 " It should be noted," N. Semyonov pointed out,
 "that the Soviet motion picture industry is since 1951)
 putting out feature films. only in colour.   TLe produc-
 tion of colour films in the USSR has become possible
 thanks to the fact that we have built up large and
 well-equipped facilities   Much attention    s given to
 the  production  of films  portraying  the  economic.
 cultural and everyday life of the Union republ cs,."
 To our correspondent's question which Soviet film
 will he shown at the International Film Festival  in
 India, N. Semyonov replied :
 " The Soviet delegation will show in    India the
 colour feature films, "The Fall of Berlin" produced by
 Mikhail Chiaureli, " Cavalier of the Gold Star " by
 Yuli Raizman  and  " Donets Miners,"  I y     Leonid
 Laikov.  In " The Fall ,-f Berlin," a pictur, in two

 "By the Will of the Pike" i taged by the State Central Puppet Theatre.

 IN! and the Dollar " was the title of the first play
 J   produced by the oldest of the Soviet puppet thea-
 tres, which is headed by Se:rgei Obraztsov. Jim
 was a little Negro boy who was homeless and hungry in
 capitalist America. The children who saw the play
 laughed at the capers of.Jim's faithful friend, his  dog,
 and wept and grew indignant at the sad fate of this
 coloured boy doomed to starvation and humiliation.
 That. was in 1932.  In the twenty years since its
 foundation the Central Puppet Theatre has traversed a
 big path of development.  It has staged 39 different
 plays for children and adults, and today has a staff of
 more than 40 actors and 95 musicians.  Twice daily the
 lobbies  and auditorium   of this theatre, housed in a
 large building on one of Moscow's central squares, are
 filled with spectators ; the matinees are attended by tots
 with their parents or schoolchildren with their teachers,
 and the evening performances by adults.
 The gay art of the Soviet puppet theatres provides
 the spectators with wholesome entertainment and it the
 same time teaches them to love truth and justice, to
 hate falsehood and violence, to respect people who
 work, and to scorn the lazy arid the parasites.
 Some of the  puppet  theatre's production:  are
 especially written and produced for the very youngest
 of spectators, for those who have come to the tl.eatre
 for the first time in their lives and who still believe that
 the  puppets  can really walk and  talk.  To these
 youngsters the puppet theatre  is a place where their
 nursery toys come alive.  Isn't it fascinating to watch
 bear cubs wash themselves, make their beds, eat noodles
 and rock in swings ?
 Another puppet theatre production is called  ' ` The
 Story Chest."  As the curtain rises the young spectators
 see a real chest on the stage-a large, handsome, one
 with carved sides. Near the chest stands an old man
 with a flowing beard and twinkling, smiling eye;. He
 is the storyteller. With a huge key he opens the thes1:.
 Music is heard, arid with the opened cover of the chest
 as a background, there appears a winter scene iii the
 forest. Out of the chest step the industrious hare. who
 has built himself a cozy little cabin, and the lazy fox.,
 who has simply fashioned a home out of snow.  And
 then the old man tells the children the story of " The
 Fox and the Hare." When spring comes and th(  sun
 begins to shine bright over the forest, the  fox's snow
 house melts away before the  children's  eyes, and the
 fox is left without shelter. The sly fox lures the hare
 out of his cabin and takes possession of it.  Inside the
 cabin it is warm  and dry.   The deceived    hare
 is indignant.  And so are the little boys and girls in
 "Actors of the Woods," staged by the State Central Puppet Theatre.

 Equipment Grows in the USSR
 The "Belarus" tractor, put out by the Minsk Tractor Plant, is a row-crop, universal wheel
 tractor designed to work with direct acting, semi-direct acting and trailer machines for the cultivation
 of high stem and low-stem crops growing in rows.  It can also be used as a general-purpose tractor
 fir sandy soil which excessit)ely wears out the traction parts of caterpillar tractors
 The tractor has a "D-35" diesel motor and, five speeds ranging from  4.6 to 12.2  kilometres an
 hour.  It comes either with rubber tyres or steel wheels.  The width between the wheels is regulated.
 1 -his allows to establish the most favourable, protective zone for the cultivation of each row.
 For better traction the adhesion weight may be regulated by filling the tyres of the driving wheels
 with water and by attaching additional metal loads to the wheel disc.  The tractor is equipped with
 a drive pulley and a transmission shaft.
 This machine is designed to cut the stalks of hemp, kenaf, jute and similar crops from 0.7 to 3.0
 metres high, clean the stalks of weeds and entanglements, bunch them and drop them on the ground.
 it has a swath of 2.1 metres.  Powered directly from the tractor it clears  0.6 hectares per
 hour.  Compared with hand picking it requires 3.5 to 5.0 times less manpower.

 REPLY TO A READER
 PERSONAL PAND SAVINGS
 OF SOVIET CITIZENS
 M ANY people who wish to acquaint themselves
 with life in the Soviet Union are interested
 whether citizens in the USSR have the right to
 own personal property and savings. It should be noted
 that the enemies of the Soviet Union frequently allege
 that citizens in the USSR cannot own any property
 whatever.  This statement is entirely wrong and false.
 For the proper understanding of this question it is
 necessary to draw a distinction between the ownership
 of the. instruments and means of production and the
 ownership of articles that go to meet the personal re-
 quirements of people.
 Indeed, in the USSR the main instruments and
 means of production, i.e., everything that is used in
 modern society for the production of material values
 is  the property of the entire people.  The land, its
 mineral wealth, waters, forests, mills, factories, mines,
 power stations, big agricultural enterprises, rail and
 other forms of transport cannot be owned in the USSR
 by private persons and thus serve as a means for extract-
 ing profits.  The Soviet law permits only the small
 private economy of the individual peasants and handi-
 craftsmen based on their own labour and precluding
 the exploitation of the labour of others.
 Soviet people regard it natural and just that the
 instruments of labour and stocks of materials used by
 them in common for the production of material values
 should be common property.  The Soviet people value
 highly the Socialist system they have builtup which
 guarantees each person the right to work and a cons-
 tantly growing income from work.  The absence of
 private ownership of the instruments and means of pro-
 duction has enabled the peoples of the USSR to con-
 duct their economy according to an integrated state
 plan and to use the material resources, scientific dis-
 coveries and improvements for a constant expansion of
 the production of material values and increasing the
 country's national income.
 Since in the USSR social production is owned by
 the people the national income is distributed in the
 interests of the working people.  It is but natural that
 under such conditions a rise in the national income re-
 sults in an increase in the income of the working people.
 And this is actually the case.
 The personal property right of citizens in their in-
 comes and savings from work, in their property and all
 articles that improve life and make it more comfortable
 and pleasant is fully recognized in the Soviet Union.
 Everything that Soviet citizens acquire on the income
 from their work-household articles, automobiles, radios,
 television sets, musical instruments, books, not to men-
 tion stocks of food, clothing, footwear, etc.-comprise
 their personal property.   Moreover, citizens have
 the right to build their own homes both in towns
 and rural localities.  In addition to cash Soviet citizens
 can have their deposits in savings and other banks and
 own state bonds.
 The personal property of citizens is protected by law.
 Article 10 of the Soviet Constitution reads :   " The
 personal property of citizens in their incomes and savings
 from work, in their dwelling houses and subsidiary
 home enterprises, in articles of domestic economy and
 use and articles of personal use and convenience, as well
 as the right to inherit personal property, is protected
 by law."
 The Government of the USSR displays daily concern
 and takes measures for steadily improving the living
 conditions of the population. This aim is being attain-
 ed by constantly increasing the incomes of the popula-
 tion and systematically reducing retail prices.
 Growing incomes enable the population of the
 USSR to assign an ever-bigger share of its expenditures
 for buying clothes, furniture and other durable goods,
 for building homes and increasing their savings.  Citi-
 zens who build their own homes are given help by the
 state in the form of long-term loans. Exceedingly low
 rents area factor contributing to the expansion of the
 purchasing power of the population.  Rents comprise
 not more than 3-4 per cent of the earnings. of factory
 and office workers.
 Since the war ended retail prices on staple goods
 have been reduced four times in the Soviet Union.
 These reductions enabled the population to buy from
 year to year at cheaper prices foodstuffs, clothing, foot-
 wear, furniture, radio sets, clocks and watches, auto-
 mobiles, motorcycles, bicycles, sewing machines, kitchen
 utensils and dishes, building materials, etc.
 As a result of the increase in income and the reduc-
 tion of prices the demand of the population for goods
 rises sharply.  Soviet stores;, from the bakery to stores
 selling automobiles or pre-fabricated homes, are al-
 ways thronged with customers.   Soviet industry in-
 creases the production of diverse goods for the popula-
 tion at a fast pace every year.

 One could cite many facts illustrating the tremen-
 dous improvement in the well-being of different sections
 of the population in the USSR.   In pre-revolutionary
 times, for example, Russian miners received low wages
 ,and lived in horrihle poverty.  All the more interest-
 i.ng are the changes in the life of miners in the USSR.
 Ifs or example, miners of the Moscow coalfields have built
 more than 3,000 homes of their own in recent years.
 These are mostly 3-4 room cottages surrounded by
 orchards.  In the first ten months of last year miners
 bought in the city of Stalinogorsk, one of the centres of
 these coalfields, 2,640 radios, 1,330 bicycles, 160 cameras,
 2,100 watches, many musical instruments, motorcycles,
 etc.  Many miners have their own automobiles.
 11?xceedingly great changes have taken place in the
 life of the Soviet peasants.  The peasants in Tajikistan
 . former borderland of the tsarist empire and now
 a full-fledged  Soviet Socialist Republic-lacked  the
 most elementary household articles in the past and
 most of them lived in adobe huts.  Now well-improved
 collective farm communities have arisen throughout
 Tajikistan.  The homes of the collective farmers have
 city furniture, radio and electrical household appliances.
 More and more collective farmers buy motorcy Iles and
 automobiles.
 The steady rise in the Ewwell-being of Soviet citizens is
 manifested also in bigger money savings.  Terra of mil-
 lions of Soviet citizens are savings bank depositors.  In
 1949 alone, the number of depositors increased by more
 than 2.2 million.  Saving:, bank deposits of tl e popu-
 lation increased from 7,300 million rubles at the end of
 1940 to 18,500 million rubles at the beginning of 1951.
 Also about 70 million  Sa rviet citizens own state loan
 bonds. In 1951 alone the Soviet state is paying out to
 the population 5,000 million. rubles as income on the
 loans they hold.
 Thus, in the Soviet Union not only do citizens enjoy
 the right to personal property and savings, but they are
 assured  a constantly risirn g purchasing power and a
 well-to-do and cultured life

 TIBILISI "DYNAMO"  ELEVEN
 (Continued from page 18)
 having a definite  trend for  teaching. Among the
 young players of the eleven one may find also 20-year
 old Cahkuaseli, who only recently finished school, and
 many others.
 The  Tbilisi " Dynamo " eleven unites people of
 difli:?rcnt walks of life.  The team was knocked to-
 gether in the thirties.  By 1930 it had already become
 famous not only among       Georgian football  admirers
 but also in many cities of the Soviet Union.        The
 same year the eleven captured the top soccer honours
 in. the second division ("B") of the Soviet champion-
 ship and was promoted                     to the first  division (" A").
 Since then the Georgian team has become a hard nut
 for any team to crack.
 the team successfully forges ahead and winds up
 the 1939-40 USSR  championships as a  runner up.
 During  these  years        many outstanding footballers
 came forward in the team including Boris Paichadze
 (who does not play any more  now), Gaioz Jejelava
 who,, in spite of his 158 centimetre height,could reach
 the upper plank of the goal poles.  Jejelava is now a
 graduate of the Institute of Physical Training and works
 as senior coach of one of the Moscow elevens.
 The football fans are  always     impatiently await
 ing the  performances of the Tbilisi eleven in the
 matches for the USSR football cup. It should be said
 that the  Georgian footballers  always play  with
 great temperament and. keenness.   During the cup
 plays they always qualify for quarter-finals and even
 finals.  This is very significant if one takes into ac-
 count the great number of teams taking a hand in the
 games for the coveted trophy. Thus teams compet-
 ing ibr the USSR football cup in the 1951 season numb-
 Bred over 16,000 !  And to reach almost the  t nal
 games among so many teams, is no easy matter !
 The  Tbilisi  " Dynamo '  successfully played a
 number of international  games.   Thus in 1945- it
 played in Iran and in 1945 in Rumania. During tl ieir
 last tour the Georgian pla.ycr~ scored a great sue ess
 by scoring ten times in one game. In 1951 the Tbilisi
 footballers played four games in the Polish Repul lie.
 They won three and tied one
 Last season this eleven captured second placfr in
 the USSR football championship       and  its  players
 were awarded silver medals.   ['his is a great achie ve-
 ment of their coach,                                                                                 Honoured  Master    of Sport
 Mikhail Yakushin. Yakushin himself was for a 1rng
 time one of' the best  players  in   the       Moscow
 ".Dynamo " eleven.  Later, after graduation of the
 higher school of coaches of the Moscow Institute of'
 Physical Training he began to work  as  a. football
 trainer.  He was the Moscow " Dynamo " eleven's
 coach at the time when this team toured Great Britain
 in 1945 without losing  a single game.  Under his
 guidance the same team twice defeated the  best
 Swedish footballers with an impressive score of 5 : 1,
 A responsive coach who puts his heart into his
 work, Mikhail Yakushin  introduced many novelties
 into the games of the Tbilisi footballers.  The Tbilisi
 Dynamo " is  now the youngest team in the first
 division for the average age of the players. Yakushin
 boldly advanced young players, and by the way, he
 has a good source from which to draw future foot-
 ballers.  Tbilisi has  a  Juvenile                                                                                  secondary sports
 school in which the boys,  in  addition      to  their
 general education, are taught football playing, g'?m-
 niastics, track and field athletics and other sports.
 Winding up my little story about Tbilisi footballers
 I have no doubt that they will win many good friends
 in India.

 For 30 odd years 1\. Nekrasov was one
 of the leading representatives of the Russian
 literary movement.  He was uo,ot only the
 outstanding poet of the democratic camp in
 Russian literature, but also a  remarkable
 organiser of Russian democratic literature,

 -the " Soveremennik " (Contemporary) and
 impression,  But  to Nekrasov, to the poet
 of the. revolutionary democratic camp, the
 people were not only a suffering, oppressed
 "lass.  The poet has a deep faith in the forces
 of the people, in their rich creative capaci-
 ties, in the transforming power of the free
 labour of the people.  'I 'he ardent optimism
 of the poet, his faith in the bright future that
 " the people will win for themselves "  are
 forcefully expressed  in his  famous poem
 " The Railway." While painting    frightful
 pictures of the miserable life and labour of
 the road builders, the poet says with convic-
 tion that the Russian people
 " Will endure everything and
 Lay a wide clear road for themselves."
 Nekrasov's poetry taught that the creative
 force of lice, the real creator of all human
 culture is the man of labour, and that only in
 porting them.
 The poet's vision of " the 1 eople, freed
 from its fetters " has come true in the free,
 great Land of Soviets.
 Nekrasov is near and dear to the Soviet
 people :, they cherish the mem try of the
 democratic poet who reproduced in his works
 the characteristic features of'  the Russian
 people's life of his time, who fought with all
 his ardour for a free and happy life for the
 masses.
 The  democratic  spirit  of  Nekrasov's
 poetry, his deep faith in the people, in the
 transforming power of free, peaceful, creative
 labour-, intakes the great Russian poet near
 and dear to all progressive mankind engaged
 in the struggle for peace and dentocracy, for
 its bright future.
 Vladimir Korolenko-Russian Writer
 (Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of His Death)
 r- `11
 P literary  and  ideological  formative
 period in the life of Vladimir    Koro-
 lenko,   onistandiug  Russian                                writer,
 was the 70's and 80's of the last century.
 I his literary and public activity was devoted
 to defending the people and  affirming the
 popular striving for truth and justice.
 Korolenko's very first story, " Makar's
 Dream," paved the way for his entry into
 " big " literature and in many ways deter-
 mined the path of development that  his
 writing would take.  Delineating the charac-
 ter of Makar, the author shows with great
 artistic power how a simple, downtrodden
 man becomes conscious of his human worth,
 how protest arises and grows in him. Ilere
 Korolenko wanted to show that neither ex-
 ploitation, ignorance nor humiliation is able
 to crush the powerful forces that lie concealed
 in the oppressed masses, that the time would
 come when. the people themselves would pro-
 nounce the truthful words that are so terri-
 fying to the exploiters:  " We cannot endure
 it ."
 In 1892 Korolenko wrote his story "The.
 River is Playing."  The leading character is
 the peasant ferry-toast '1'yulin, whom Koro-
 lenko paints in his true colours and through
 whom he shows that critical moments arouse
 in the common man the ability to perform
 deeds of fearless valour.  Maxim Gorky gave
 high praise to " The River is Playing," say-
 ing :  ` With the tender yet strong hand of
 the great artist V. G. Korolenko has given
 us an honest and truthful portrait of a misahik,
 a real, full-length portrait... "
 Besides Tyulin, the most developed folk
 character depicted by Korolenko is Matvei
 Lozinsky, :hero of the story  " Without a
 Tongue."  Here  Korolcoko presents a man
 with great spiritual possibilities, w ho possesses
 the  qualities that  are  typical   for   the
 Russian   national   character :    Love   of
 freedom, spiritual. purity, kindness, boldness,
 independence, integrity, and g'cat      moral
 strength.
 Korolenko was not only a wri er. He was
 all active public leader and pamphleteer, who
 defendafl the interests of the pecple against
 the despotism and violence of die authorities.
 Korolenko's works are published in the
 USSR in editions running into the millions.
 Between 1917 and 1946, for  example, 333
 cdititnis of Korolcnko's works were issued
 in the USSR, in more than 30 languages of
 the peoples of the Soviet Union, the editions
 amounting to 7,270,000 copies altogether. In
 the last few years several other large editions
 of Korolenko's works have been published.
 Kot clenko's name has been given to a
 number of secondary and higher  schools,
 and Korolenko scholarships were established
 in  several  higher  schools.  In Poltava,
 where.Korolenko lived and worke. 1, the Koro-
 lenko museum, which was bu -ned down
 during the war, was restored.
 All this is confirmation of Max ins Gorky *s
 words that "in the great tvork of wilding the
 trcwv Russia the splendid writings of V. G.
 Korolenko, a man with a big at d a strong
 heart, will find worthy approval.'

 The Immortal Nikolai Ostrovsky
 D ECEMBER 22, 1951, marked 15 years
 since the death of Nikolai Ostrovsky,
 outstanding Soviet writer whose glo-
 rious name and whose books arc world
 famous.
 Ostrovsky had in battle against tremen-
 dous odds in the course of his life.  An in-I
 curable illness following upon a severe wound
 during the Civil War kept the future writer
 to his bed. He did not surrender, however,

 3. Soviet Cinema Delegation to
 but continued to work stubbornly and self-
 lessly to help establish the new life in the
 country.  Although he was physically in-
 capacitated, he preserved a clear mind and
 an iron will, and turned to writing, using
 his pen to make his life and activity worth-
 while.
 " How the Steel Was Tempered " is
 Ostrovsky's most famous book.  An auto-
 biographical novel, it is in two parts.  The
 third part was never written, although the
 writer had it planned out. Just a few days
 before his death Ostrovskv finished the first
 part of the novel " Born of the Storm," with
 the next two parts in outline.  This is a book
 which he wanted `not simply to write but to
 put in the fire of my heart," He also wrote
 a scenario based on "How the Steel Was
 Tempered," and dreamed of writing a book
 for children to be called " Pavka's Child-
 hood " and a book about the Soviet Army
 leader Semyon Budyonny.
 Death tore the ,pen from Ostrovsky's
 hands at the very height of his writing career.
 He was only 32 years old.  But Ostrovsky's
 wonderful books remain, his passionate and
 truthful words.
 " For man the most wonderful thing is
 to have everything one creates serve people,
 even after one ceases to exist,'.' Ostrovsky
 said.  This is just what has happened to
 Ostrovsky himself. The first part of " How
 the Steel Was Tempered " appeared in. 1932,
 and the second part two years later.  There
 are now approximately six million copies
 of " How the Steel Was Tempered " and
 the posthumous  " Borm of the Storm "
 in the country. His works have been trans-
 lated into 43 languages of the peoples of
 the USSR and 20 foreign languages.  One
 should not, however, estimate the signifi-
 cance of Ostrovsky's literary heritage only in
 figures.   Pavel  Korchagin,  the hero of
 " How the Steel Was Tempered," has be-
 come a model for the younger generation in
 the Soviet Union.  He is their model, whom
 they study and from whom they  learn.
 Ostrovsk'y books encourage the youth to
 feats of labour and battle valour.
 Nikolai Ostrovsky's name has been given
 to streets and schools, libraries and parks,
 Young Pioneer Houses and theatres in the
 USSR.  There are " Nikolai Ostrovsky "
 steamships, "N. Ostrovsky" locomotives, and
 " N. Ostrovsky" aeroplanes. All this is part
 of the writer's immortality.
 These words of Ostrovsky's  ring  out
 with especial force today :
 " The banner of peace has been raised
 over our Soviet Land. It is a beautiful ban-
 ner, it is the hope of all mankind. To look
 at our country is to see an industrious ant-
 hill. All our plans and all our thoughts are
 directed toward peaceful construction, to-
 ward the creation of collective wealth, toward
 raising the cultural level, toward concern
 for our wonderful children. Our banner is
 peace 1 "
 Nikolai Ostrovsky was and remains one
 with his people and his peaceful country.
 In this lies his immortality.  His was a life
 selflessly given to the great cause of Com-
 munism.  Men like Nikolai Ostrovsky do
 not die. Today, too, they are marching in
 the ranks of the peace fighters!

 the Central Committee of'the Communist Party
 of, the Soviet Union was held a few days ago which
 resolved to convene the regular 19th Congress of the
 Cl'S1; on October 5, and adopted the agenda of the
 Congress.  After the report of the  Party's Central
 Committee and  Central  Auditing  Commission,  the
 (.oneness will take up the directives of the 19th Congress
 of the Party con.cernir.g the fifth Fivc-Year flan of

 The draft directives of the 19th Congress of the
 Party concerning the fifth Five-Year Plan of development
 of the USSR in 1%,5 1-1955), published  simultaneously

 of peaceful economic and cultural construction, ensuring
 the further advancement of all branches of the national
 economy,  expansion of the pr_rhhc  health   services,
 irnprovcment of the material well-being and rise of the
 cultnnnI level of the Soviet people.
 Industrial output is to step up about 70 pcr cent in
 these  five  years..   Capital development      work--
 construction of giant hydro-electric stations, industrial
 enterprises, irrigation systems, dwelling houses--is to
 increase 10 per cent, compared with the first post-war
 F'ive-Year Plan.  These figures alone most strikingly
 show the sweeping extent: of economic and cultural
 construction under the  second  post-war  Five-Year
 Plan.
 Electrification is under the second post-war Five-
 Year Plan being pushed further ahead at an increasing
 pace.   'the  total  number  of electric  stations will,
 approximately, double and that of hydra-electric stations,
 treble.  huge power plants will he put into or' ration,
 including the Kuibyshev 1-1\ ()ro-I lc ctric Station Na ith a
 capacity of 2,100,094) kilowatts ; and also the Kama,
 Gorky, Mingechaur, Ust-Kamp nogorsk and other h edro-
 electric  stations  with  a tot:ri  capacity  of  1,91.;,000
 kilowatts.    The Kill bysin e-Moscow   high-te nsion

 _~. Privile a>w'e  Eu   etI by Soviet
 Miners
 Rossochinsky, Chairman, Coal Miner's Union of the USSR
 'y"'t`/I RY  year ott  August  :,, 1,
 _..!  the Soviet Union celebrates
 Miner's   flay.     Now       a
 traditional  festival  of the  Soviet
 c olliiers, it was instituted by  the
 (government  of the      USSR      in
 1947, in recognition of their great
 services to the country.  At, the
 same   time,    the Government
 established a number of benefits
 and privileges for them .
 The  miner's  trade  is  highly
 esteemed  in  the Soviet Union.
 Miners here are surrounded with
 great care and attention. For one
 thing, they are the highest paid
 workers.  Wages in the Soviet pits
 are paid by the progressive piece-
 rate  system                      under  which     for
 every  per cent  produced      above
 target a miner is remunerated at
 progressively  rising ra.tcs.  'Flue
 higher his above-target output,  the
 higher, naturally, are his earnings.
 'thus   miners'    actual   earnings
 substantially  exceed their    basic
 wages.  X tiny Stakhanovite colliers
 make    as much as 7,000 to 8,000
 rubles a month.
 Nor is the Soviet miners' well-
 being                                                             determined  only  by  their
 high cash earnings and the constantly
 increasing real value of their wages
 thanks to the systematic reduction
 of  retail prices   of  consumers'
 goods.
 Like all working people in the
 Soviet Union they get. many benefits
 and services free, at state expense,
 which   considerably augment their
 money wages.  Besides this miners,
 metallurgical workers, oil men, and
 workers in several other industries
 enj ry a number of special privileges.
 Thus, for example, miners once
 every   year  receive  long-service
 bonus.  The size of such a bonus
 ranges from 10 to 30 per cent of the
 miner's basic wage for the given
 year, depending on his length  of
 service. In the past five years alone,
 the  Soviet  miners  received from
 N,lislrin houses is approxitrtately
 fen lilies "flea tee than heh>rc the
 Soviet   ,,cars   exceed I(1,11t1U,1)1)11

 "CHILDREN'S
 TOWNS"
 IN MOSCOW PARKS
 By Maya Rozhdestvenskaya
 Young "builders" in the children's section of
 the Gorky Cenlral Park of Culture and Rest.
 HE   green  tracts  of  parks
 T  and gardens in the Soviet
 capital are like wonderful
 oasis.  Thousands of people come
 there for a rest and interesting
 pastime.
 The first visitors who come to
 these parks in the morning are
 the  children.  True,   with  the
 coming  of summer most of the
 young Muscovites have left town
 some    went  to  country  places
 with    their kindergartens   and
 others-to summer camps.     Other
 children are awaiting their turn to go to  camp. And in the  meantime they
 have facilities for a good rest and recreation in the " children's  towns "
 of the parks of culture and rest.
 Welcome ! " bids the inviting sign over  the light archway leading to
 the children's town in the Sokolniki Park: There are sculptures  in the shady
 alleys and colourful flowers on the lawns.
 Let us look into the " attraction grounds " which  constantly resound with
 merry laughter.  Swings  fly smoothly  into  the air.  A  merry-go-round is
 turning. There is a brave little lad perched proudly upon a wooden  horse.
 From time to time he looks to the right    where youthful artists  are working
 with brush and ease] in front of  a white pavilion.    The little equestrian
 is convinced that they are painting his picture...
 On  the walls  in  the    pavilion,  called
 Hall    of    Interesting     Occupations,"
 one may see   productions        of the amateur
 artists : paintings, water  colour,  pencil
 drawings. Attention is attracted by a portrait
 of J. V. Stalin  embroidered             in  silk.  On
 display in the showcases are skillfully carved
 wooden  caskets and  beautifully ornamented
 picture frames, statuettes made of plasticine,
 soft toys and ohjects fashioned of cardboard.
 All  these were made by members of the
 amateur circles  in the  park,  under  the
 guidance of expert  instructors. Right now
 they   are working   on  new    productions.
 Vladimir Mozharov a ninth-form student with
 abilities for wood  carving is completing a
 beautiful frame ; 12-year old Valya. Bunevich
 is doing an attractive piece  of embroidery,
 in ancient Russian style....
 Volleyballs  are flying  over the  sports.
 grounds. Athletic   minded youngsters  are
 engaged in gymnastic and acrobatic exercises
 in a special hall.'There are  sepcial premises
 for air and  sun  baths.  An      amateur art
 contest is in progress on the     vast  grounds
 called " mass field". The youngsters dance
 and sing.  The game       room  is filled with
 noisy  merriment. Table    soccer is  one of
 the     most favourite    games.  Moving the
 figures of the " team members " over special
 boards, they become absorbed in the compe-
 titions.
 There is a special playground in children's
 town for the very little ones,  with a rich
 choice of toys.
 There is a  one-day  rest home in the
 park which accommodates 550 people.  The
 school children accommodated in this rest
 home also avail themselves of the attractions
 in the park.
 The  Soviet parks are not only   places
 for amusement, but real centres for dissemi-
 nating socialist culture. The personnel of the
 children's towns cultivate in their visitors love
 .of labour and sports, develop their initiative
 and  assist them in  selecting their future professions.     What  a variety of
 interesting lectures and talks are arranged by the lecture service for children
 maintained in the parks ! Every lecture is illustrated with  exhibitions, films,
 slides and experiments.  Scientists,  innovators in production, writers  and
 actors come to  the children.    The  library  of the  park  arranges literary
 reviews and loud reading of books which  attract scores of listeners.
 And now follow me into  the technical hobby circles where youngsters
 are' building miniature models of dams and tall buildings, assembling  radio
 sets, and instruments for experiment ; in physics, testing models of ships and
 planes, and learning photography.     Members  of the  young tourists' and
 automobile clubs are making interesting  trips. At the beginning of July,
 about 60 youths set out    on the Moscow-
 Stalingrad-Moscow motoring race,                                                                                                                                                                                     covering
 about 3,000 km. by car and motorcycle.
 ...There is a small building  amid trees
 surrounded by  a fence.  A little girl, her
 eyes shining with curiosity,  stops in front
 of the wicket gate.
 "Look  here," she says to her friend,"
 here is the young naturalists' centre. Whatever
 have they not got here!"
 The two little girls have never been to
 the Sokolniki  Park  before, and everything
 excites their  wonder.  They  had  already
 managed to join a circle on the first day.... .
 There really is much of interest on    the
 territory of the  young naturalists' centre.
 Medicinal herbs and technical plants grow on
 the neatly cultivated beds. There are Michurin
 apple  trees in  the orchard,  and stretching
 along the fence   is  an  experimental. shelter
 belt made up of a variety of trees. The centre
 has its animal section.   Among its population
 you will see  a  turtle,  doves,  moles, an
 aquarium  with live fry, and even raccoons
 (a present from the  Moscow    zoo)   which
 seem quite at home in a tiny little house
 inthe yard.  Last year there was Mashka, a
 mischievous bear cub, to delight the children
 who came to the park.  Mashka had grown
 since then and was returned to the zoo.  He
 looks quite ferocious  now. But whenever
 any  of  his  former   " attendants "  call
 " Mashka",  the bear  immediately  lifts his
 shaggy   head and   running up  to      the
 wire net looksaffectionately at his old friends.
 Like  all the children, the "Sokolniki"
 naturalists frequently go to the Moscow zoo
 which has animals representing the fauna of
 the  whole  world.  Especially    many visitors
 crowd.. in front of the home of the family of
 Indian elephants : Shango, Molly and three-
 year-old Moskvich                                                                                                                                           who was       born  in  the
 zoo. The elephants are fond of bathing in the
 big pool, and' they delight in munching the
 sugar they receive for dessert.   In general,
 they  feel quite  fine.  ,  .  ,  . The  little

 wolves, foxes, bear cubs and other
 young animals kept behind special
 enclosures also attract many visitors.
 The workers of the zoo sometimes
 take them out of the  park          to
 illustrate  their  lectures :  in  the
 schools.
 In     addition  to  the children's
 towns in the general parks, there are
 special children's parks       in   16
 districts of the capital. These parks
 arrange varied-  and  interesting

 J ULY and August is the" height
 of the health resort season in
 the USSR. Millions of working
 people. spend their annual paid
 vacations at sanatoria,or rest homes.
 Upwards  of 4,000,000 working
 people will this year spend their
 vacations at the health building
 establishments belonging to  the
 unions ; the various ministries or
 other :organisations.
 The Soviet working, people going
 to health resorts have a great choice
 to pick from.  There are in the
 USSR some  130  resort      areas,
 situated  in the most  picturesque
 places throughout the country.
 Among      the   resorts  enjoying
 particular favour with the working
 people are those on the southern
 coast of the Crimea.
 Sunny      Crimea  is  rich  and
 -picturesque. Its southern   shore
 constitutes a narrow strip of coast
 105 kilometres long and from two
 to ten kilometres wide. It is walled
 off from the north by a tall mountain
 range which keeps out from here
 the cold winds.
 Here, on the sea coast, at Melas,
 Kastropol, Simei?z, Alupka, Miskhor,
 Yalta, Gurzuf, Alushta and other
 resorts, amidst pine woods covering
 the mountain slopes and boundless
 vineyards ; the palaces of the tsars
 and grand dukes and the villas and
 mansions of the rich   have been
 turned into sanatoria  and health
 building establishments for workers
 and  peasants, and     many  new
 magnificent ones have been built.
 Most of the sanatoria, . and there
 are  about  a hundred  here, are
 general-therapeutic  ones. Every
 year, tens of thousands of working
 people build up their health in
 them.       The  sanatoria  have all
 the   necessary   treatment and
 diagnostic       equipment : X-ray
 physiotherapeutic, curative physical
 culture     and  massage, dental,
 electrotherapy,        electro-cardio
 graphy,   hydropathic   and other
 facilities.    Vacationers are under
 constant observation   of   com-
 petent doctors and other medical
 personnel.
 Great attention at the sanatoria
 is devoted to cultural services for their
 guests,  who  have here  at their

 The Coexistence Problem
 "New York Times" Article Discussed
 N I' IS June 111th issue the " New York Times"
 published an article by its Washington corres-
 pordent Mr. Waggoner on the peaceful coexistence
 of the. U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. Judging by all the
 signs, the views he expresses arc not only, and not
 so much, his own, as these of certain official Washington
 circles. At any rate, Mr. Waggoner keeps referring
 to Washington " experts"; who are examining recent
 Soviet actions and statements.  All the more reason,
 therefore, to examine Mr. Waggoner's article.
 Its obvious intention is to have the reader believe
 that the Soviet Union has abandoned its original
 stand on the question of the peaceful coexistence of
 the capitalist and socialist systems, and for that reason
 the " experts   fail " to discern signs of peace or
 co-operation from Moscow."
 Only those who deliberately set out to distort and
 mispresent  the facts can accuse the Soviet Union
 of having changed its policy on the question of the
 peaceful coexistence of the two systems on the basis
 of international co-operation.
 Soviet reccgnition of the necessity and feasibility of
 the two systems living side by side in peace is not
 something transient or temporary but a constant factor
 of Soviet foreign policy.  It forms an integral part
 of the fundamental principles of the teachings of Lenin
 and Stalin.  It is the cornerstone, the very essence, of
 the policy which the Soviet Union has been pursuing
 since its very inception.
 World history has passed through several stages in
 that period, but at each of them the foreign policy of
 the U.S.S.R. was invariably directed at ensuring peace
 and peaceful  co-operation  between  all  countries,
 irrespective of their social and political systems.
 x x                     x
 Foreign policy is inseparable from domestic policy ;
 it is, in fact, a continuation and extension of the latter.
 This rule applies to the U.S.S.R. as it e5es to any
 other country. Even its bitterest enemies do not deny
 that the U.S.S.R. has invariably set the world an
 example of fraternity and friendship among the nations
 inhabiting   its  territory.  The  same  principle   of
 friendship and co-operation among nations is also the
 cornerstone of its foreign policy.
 In 11322, in an interview with a correspondent of
 the  London        "Observer ','  and the " Manchester
 Guardian", V. I. Lenin especially stressed this basic and
 distinguishing feature of Soviet foreign policy.  He
 told the correspondent :   Our experience has firmly
 convinced us that only the. greatest concern for the
 interests of the various nations can remove the causes
 of conflicts, remove mutual distrust, remove the fear
 of intrigue, and create the confidence, especially among
 the workers and peasants speaking different languages,
 without which peaceful relations between the nations
 and any successful development of all that is precious
 in modern civilization, are absolutely impossible."
 Soviet people have always regarded it their sacred
 duty to apply this principle expounded by Lenin.  That
 explains the continuity between the historic Decree
 on Peace, made public on November 8, 1917, by the-
 newly-formed Soviet government, and the proposal
 for a Five-Power Peace Pact which the government
 of the U.S.S.R. has been consistently  advocating in
 these past years.
 The Decree on Peace called for an end to the war
 and for the conclusion of a just, democratic peace.
 It was addressed to all belligerents, to all the peoples.
 The major belligerent powers at that time were the
 United  States;  Great Britain,  France,  Germany,
 Austria-Hungary, and Italy, that is, the chief capitalist
 countries.  The very first action of the new Soviet
 government was thus based on the principle of peaceful
 coexistence of two divergent social and economic
 systems.
 In 1919 V. I. Lenin submitted to the Seventh All
 Russian Congress of Soviets,, the supreme legislative
 body of the country, a resolution which stated : " The
 Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic desires
 to live in peace with all nations and to devote all its
 energies to internal development, in order to organize
 industry, transport and public administration on the
 basis of the Soviet system, which it has hitherto been
 prevented from doing by the interference of the
 Entente and the hunger blockade."  Here again V. I.
 Lenin stressed the desire of the U.S.S.R. to live in
 peace with all capitalist countries, for at that time there
 were no other countries.
 Two years later, in December, 1921, in his report
 to the Ninth All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Lenin
 squarely put the question : is there any possibility of
 the peaceful coexistence of Soviet Russia and the
 capitalist countries ? His reply, a firm and unhesitating
 yes,"  has determined  the policy of the Soviet
 government ever since.
 In his talk with Harold Stassen in 1947, J. V. Stalin
 said :  " The idea of co-operation between the two
 systems was first expressed by Lenin.  Lenin is our
 teacher, and we, Soviet people, are Lenin's pupils.
 We have never departed and never shall depart from
 Lenin's teachings."  These words have been borne out
 by the entire record of the Soviet Union.
 The socialist system of society has enabled the Soviet
 Union to achieve in a short space of time economic
 and cultural progress and an improvement in the welfare
 of its  peoples,  unparalleled in history.  And it is
 characteristic  that the stronger the  Soviet  Union
 grew, the greater its progress in the work of construction,
 and the greater its prestige in international affairs,
 the more persistent and resolute were its efforts to
 promote     peaceful  co-operation  between the  two
 divergent systems, capitalism and socialism.
 This is but natural and logical : every new step in
 the building of socialism opens up ever~wider prospects
 for further creative endeavour and, consequently,
 adds to the Soviet Union's interest in. consolidating

 Approved For Release 2002/01/17 : CIA-RDP83-00415RO13000010003-2
 peace and international security and in developing
 international economic intercourse.
 The record of the past three decades furnishes
 ample proof of this and also provides a clue to an
 understanding  of  the  future.  With  the  further
 development of socialist society in the Soviet Union
 the possibilities of peaceful coexistence and effective
 co-operation of the two systems, far from diminishing,
 are bound to increase and expand.  This J. V. Stalin
 stressed in his reply to a " Sunday Times " Moscow
 correspondent in September, 1946. The correspondent
 asked whether, with the continued advance of the
 Soviet Union towards Communism, the possibilities of
 peaceful co-operation between the Soviet Union and
 the outside world would not decrease.  J. V. Stalin
 replied : "I do not doubt that the possibilities of peaceful
 co-operation, far from decreasing, may even grow."
 Any  unbiased  person  making  a  study  of the
 statements by V. I. Lenin and J. V. Stalin over the
 course of the last thirty-five years, statements made at
 different periods and under totally different conditions,
 will arrive at the inescapable conclusion that the
 Soviet Union regards the peaceful coexistence of
 the two divergent systems as the inviolable
 foundation of its foreign policy.
 Truth is tested by practice-  A survey of the leading
 trends in international affairs since the inception of
 Soviet government will show how this policy has worked
 out.
 The last thirty and more years have seen many an
 attempt by aggressive circles in the West to embroil
 the capitalist world and the land of socialism in war.
 Yet, the second world war started as a conflict between
 two groups of capitalist powers.  Later, after Hitler
 Germany's treacherous attack on the Soviet Union,
 there came into being  the   powerful   anti-Hitler
 coalition of the Soviet Union --a socialist state-and
 the United States, Britain and France-capitalist states.
 Opposed to it was the coalition made up of Germany,
 Japan and Italy, all of them capitalist states.
 Thus the antagonisms between the various capitalist
 states proved to be more acute and profound than
 the  antagonisms between the two systems.
 Even though the prewar period was one of constant
 anti-Soviet intrigue by the Western powers, still the
 possibility of capitalism and socialism existing side
 by side in peace was fully confirmed.
 The outcome of the second world  war  greatly
 increased these possibilities.  I n 1941, in reply to a
 question by Elliott Roosevelt whether it was possible
 for the U.S.A. to live peacefully side by side with the
 Soviet Union, J. V. Stalin said :   "This is not only
 possible.  It is wise and entirely within the bounds of
 realization.  In the most strenuous times, during the
 war, the differences in government did not prevent
 our two nations from .joining together and vanquishing
 our foes.     Even more so  is it possible to continue
 this relationship in time ol',peace."
 X             x                   x
 What, then, has led the Washington " experts " and
 Mr. Waggoner, who pleads their case on the pages
 of the " New York Times", to assume that the Soviet
 Union has abandoned its earlier stand on the question
 of peaceful coexistence of the two systems ? Be it noted,
 in the first place, that all this talk of the Washington
 ` experts " about a supposed " evolution " of Soviet
 policy only exposes their own turnabout.
 For years many official American spokesmen claimed
 that the Soviet Union denied the very principle of
 peaceful coexistence.  The Washington " experts " are
 telling a different story now, and are, in. effect, admitting
 that their earlier position was, to put it mildly, at
 variance with the facts.  For it is absurd to maintain
 that a totally negative stand can develop into one more
 totally negative, though that is what their argument
 amounts to. If there can be any talk of evolution, then
 only in respect to the methods of these Washington
 ` ` experts " : they have publicly renounced their earlier
 assertions and, in an attempt to make political capital,
 are now affirming the very opposite.  But this will
 not get them any too far, for now as before they are
 twisting and garbling the facts.
 Mr. Waggoner affirms that whereas in the past the
 Soviet Union attached no " strings " to its statements
 about the possibility of the peaceful coexistence of the
 two systems, now it is advancing definite conditions,
 namely, willingness of both sides to co-operate, readiness
 to discharge the obligations they have assumed, and so
 on and so forth.
 The "New York Times "  and its  Washington
 correspondent have put themselves in a  ludicrous
 position, for it stands to reason that peaceful coexistence
 and effective co-operation of the two  systems are
 possible only if the representatives of both parties desire
 such co-operation and, conversely, are impossible if one
 of the parties obstinately refuses to co-operate.  That is
 precisely why J. V. Stalin said, in his interview with
 Stassen in 1947  " Of course, it is understood that
 given the desire to co-operate, co-operation is fully
 possible between different economic systems.       But if
 there is no desire to co-operate, even with the same
 economic system, states and people can fight each
 other."
 .J. V. Stalin expressed the same thought in April of
 this year in his replies to a group of American newspaper
 editors  who asked him :  "On what  basis is the
 coexistence of capitalism and Communism possible ? "
 The reply was : "The peaceful coexistence of capitalism
 and Communism is quite possible provided there is
 a mutual desire to co-operate, readiness to carry out
 undertaken  commitments,  and  observance  of the
 principle of equality and noninterference in the internal
 affairs of other states."
 Naturally,  peaceful  coexistence  and effective
 co-operation between states,  including states with
 different economic systems, are inconceivable if one of
 the parties fails to carry out its  obligations and
 embarks  on a policy of interfering in the internal
 affairs of the other, or if it commits itself to a policy
 of discrimination against the other party.
 Behind all this talk of the Washington "experts "
 about new Soviet stipulations which, they claim, hinder
 the peaceful coexistence of the two systems is reluctance
 to support and develop peaceful  international co-
 operation on the only  acceptable basis of mutual
 respect of interests, equality, faithful discharge of
 obligations and noninterference in the internal affairs
 of` other countries.  The " evolution " discovered by

 Approved For Release 2002/01/17 : CIA-RDP83-00415RO13000010003-2
 the Washington " experts  applies to their own position,
 not to that of the Soviet Union.
 Mr. Waggoner tells us that these "experts" fail "to
 discern signs of peace or co-operation from Moscow."
 There is no need for special investigations to discern
 such "signs". Soviet foreign policy is not a book sealed
 with seven seals, it is known to hundreds of millions
 of people as are its aims.  These aims are :
 Conclusion of a Peace Pact between the United
 States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China.
 Unconditional prohibition of atomic and germ weapons
 as weapons designed for the mass extermination of
 human life, and establishment of stringent international
 control to  enforce  the  ban.  Reduction  of  the
 armaments and armed forces, first of the five Great
 Powers and subsequently. of all nations.  The reunion
 of Germany and her conversion into a  peaceable,
 democratic state.  The conclusion of a just peace treaty
 with Germany, to be followed by the withdrawal of all
 occupation forces. Termination of the war in Korea
 and the speedy peaceful settlement of the Korean
 problem.  A just peace treaty for Japan and withdrawal
 of all occupation troops.
 Who will deny that  implementation  of  these
 measures, on which the Soviet Union insists, would go a
 long way towards consolidating peace and international
 security? And if this peace programme is not being
 carried out, the reason should be sought in the postwar
 evolution of the policies of the Western powers, the
 United States primarily.

 The Painter A. E. Arkhipov
 (Marking the 90th Anniversary of his Birth)
 O N August 27th of this year the
 Soviet public will mark the
 90th anniversary of the birth
 of A. E. Arkhipov, master of Russian
 genre painting, a People's Artist
 of the Republic, and the teacher
 of a number of outstanding Soviet
 artists.
 Arkhipov is a name well-known
 in the Soviet Union.  His paintings
 hang in many museums and are
 favourites with the Soviet people.
 Arkhipov was born into a peasant
 family in the village of Yegorovo,
 Ryazan Gubernia. His grandfather
 and father were serfs.  Life in the
 Arkhipov family was not easy.  A
 constant struggle had to be waged
 against  hunger,     poverty and
 want.
 At an early age the future artist
 became a pupil of icon painters.
 One of them, Zaikov, was much
 impressed by Arkhipov's gift for
 drawing and at his recommendation
 the boy was entered at the Moscow
 School of Painting, Sculpture and
 Architecture.   There  he studied
 under  the ' outstanding  Russian
 realist painters Perov, Makovsky,
 Pryanishnikov     and    Polenov,
 graduating in 1883.
 By 1886 Arkhipov       had    won
 general recognition with his painting
 " The  Girl Friends", fqr   which
 he was awarded a Grand  Silver
 Medal  and an honorary  title.
 Knowing the life of the Russian
 pre-revolutionary   peasantry,
 Arkhipov depicted their hard lot.
 Arkhipov's  scenes  of  everyday
 peasant life rang out as a protest
 against the cheerless life of the
 toiling peasant.   In the next few
 years Arkhipov painted a number
 of pictures that  became  widely
 famous, among them " Along the
 Oka River",       "On  the Volga,"
 The Send-Off", " The Road to
 Exile " " Women at Work in an
 Iron Foundry", "After the Pogrom",
 and " Poor Peasant beside a Grave."
 In 1895 he was given the title of
 Academician of Painting.
 In 1901. Arkhipov painted one
 of his  greatest  pictures  " The
 Washerwomen,"     depicting   the
 hard life of the Russian working
 class. One has but to glance at the
 bent figures of the washerwomen,
 worn out by exhausting labour in a
 damp, dark cellar, to understand
 the message of social protest carried
 by the picture.  In the years that
 followed Arkhipov painted a series
 of wonderful landscapes  of the
 Russian North.   In 1916 he was
 elected a member of the Academy
 of Arts.
 During   the   Great   October
 Socialist Revolution  Arkhipov
 joined the Association of Artists of
 Revolutionary Russia and painted
 a series of vivid, joyous portraits of
 Russian  peasant   women.   In
 1927  the   Soviet  Government
 bestowed upon him the title of
 People's Artist of the Republic in
 recognition of his great services in
 helping to develop Soviet art.
 Arkhipov died in]1930 at the age
 of 69. His realistic genre paintings
 have become a part of the golden
 treasury of Soviet fine arts.

 THE second German fascist  offensive, begun
 November 16th with the objective of surrounding
 and capturing Moscow, had been halted on all
 sectors of the 600-kilometer Western Front.
 This time, too, Hitler's plan had fallen through....
 With great difficulty the Hitlerite northern shock
 grouping seized Rogachev, Klin and Solnechnogorsk
 in the last days of November ; its tank units managed
 to break through only to Yakhroma.
 Linable to take Tula, the Hitlerite southern shock
 grouping bypassed it on the east and seized Stalinogorsk
 and Venev in an attempt to reach the Oka, but it was
 halted seven kilometres south of Kahira.
 After  marking time for many days the Hitlerite
 central auxiliary grouping forced the Nara River in
 several places, but was immediately thrown back by
 our troops.
 The encirclement and capture of Moscow did not
 take place.
 The German fascist troops suffered heavy losses
 (hiring the offensive, when  they were  drawn  into
 exhausting battles.  Hundreds of burnt and smashed
 tanks, guns and lorries lay strewn on the fields of the
 Moscow area.  More than 50,000 Hitlerites had left
 their bones there.   On many sectors the Hitlerites
 were already going over to the defensive.  Hitler's
 headquarters no longer issued boasting communiques
 about the offensive on Moscow.  Instead, it complained
 of the hosts and snowfalls.  It affirmed       that  the
 Russian winter did not permit. big offensive operations.
 It Was not,  of course, a matter of the Russian
 winter... .
 Despite  the enemy's  two-told  and      three-fold
 numerical superiority, the troops of the Western Front
 had displayed miraculous grit in defending the Soviet
 capital.  They had courageously fought for every inch
 of native soil. They had bravely launched endless
 counter-attacks. They had converted the whole of
 Moscow Region into one huge graveyard of Hitlerite
 troops and material.  Now, hardened and tempered
 in bitter battle, the troops of the Western Front were,
 with the forces at their disposal, dealing the enemy
 telling counter-blows everywhere, and especially on
 the flanks.
 Even so, Hitler could hardly suspect what awaited
 his troops near Moscow in the near future.
 In  their  endeavour  to  surround  Moscow  the
 German  fascist shock groupings had advanced far
 beyond the remaining line of the front. Confident
 that the Red Army's forces were almost depleted, that
 it had no strategic reserves whatsover, the groupings
 gave poor protection to their flanks, leaving them open
 to blows from our troops.
 Beginning with November 20th, the fourth day of
 the German offensive, our fresh reserves began to arrive
 at the Moscow front from deep in the rear, according
 to Stalin's plan and order.  They were brought up
 in full secrecy. In the dark of night numberless trains
 carrying infantry, tanks and  artillery  halted and
 unloaded at small stations east of Moscow.  From
 here the reserves moved up to the appointed places
 under cover of night.  While the troops of the Western
 Front were fearlessly defending the near approaches
 to Moscow, three fresh armies of Soviet troops supplied
 with first-class equipment by our heroic rear, were
 being  concentrated in the district of Dmitrov and
 Zagorsk, on the flank of the enemy's northern grouping,
 and in the district of Kashira and south of Ryazan,
 on the flank of the southern grouping.  Fresh troops
 also appeared  west of the capital.  No matter  how
 threatening the situation was at times on the near
 approaches to Moscow, no matter how hard a time
 Moscow's gallant defenders were having, Stalin held
 back these reserves, did not send them into action.
 The day of reckoning with the enemy was drawing
 near.
 During these days Stalin pondered much on the
 conning counter-offensive of our troops.  This well-
 prepared and organized counter-offensive, Stalin felt,
 should be a most unique type of offensive, as a result
 of which our troops would not only smash the enemy
 near Moscow but would also deal him powerful blows
 in the north and south.  Fulfilment of this counter-
 offensive plan might thus become the decisive military
 event of the first year of the Great Patriotic War.  In
 the Battle of Moscow the Soviet Army was to raise the
 banner of victory, in order later to carry it to Berlin....
 While thinking about the counter-offensive and
 closely watching for the moment to begin it, Stalin
 acquainted himself first-hand with the military situation
 on different sectors of the Moscow front.  These days
 he especially wished to be as close as possible to the
 Army in the Field.
 x           x           x
 ....On his way to the forward defence lines, while
 passing through a big village on Volokolamsk Highway,
 Stalin noticed a small white flag with a vivid red cross
 in the middle floating above the entrance to a stone
 building.  This was an army field hospital.  Stalin
 ordered the driver to stop the car, and in a few minutes
 he was in a ward where lay men wounded in the recent
 fighting.
 There were four of them.  They lay in white
 hospital cots set in a row, heads towar Is a windowless
 wall, with a space for passage between each. The
 opposite wall had two windows facing south. Without

 lifting their heads the wounded could see the red setting
 sun low over the houses on the other side of the
 highway.
 The  sudden  appearance   of  the   Supreme
 Commander-in-Chief accompanied by generals, the
 head of the hospital and the doctor on duty excited the
 wounded unbelievably. All four simultaneously made
 jerky motions beneath the woollen blankets, unconsciously
 moved by the desire to spring to their feet and greet
 Stalin in military fashion, but only one of them, a man
 with a bandaged chest and neck, somehow managed
 to sit, up.  A bitter sense of their helplessness once
 again swept over the other three.. Physical pain, no
 matter how.. great they could bear without a murmur,
 but they could not conceal the anguish they felt now at
 not having the strength to welcome Stalin at attention.
 One gave an agonized groan.. Another moved his
 head on the pillow  in  distress.  The third ground
 his teeth in bitter disappointment.,
 Stalin noticed that the wounded were upset.
 " Good-day, Comrades, good-day" he therefore
 said heartily. as he. halted by the cot nearest to the
 door, in which sat,a wounded man with an amazed and
 blissful expression on his high cheekboned young face.
 "But I have a big request to make of you, Comrades,-
 you must all lie quietly;" he:said after they had replied
 to his greeting. "Yes, indeed, you have to lie quietly.
 As for us, we can, and, should, stand here in front of
 you."
 Embarrassment flickered in the quick grey eyes of
 the wounded man sitting up in the cot...
 "Allow, me .to sit-up, Comrade Stalin," he said,
 closing his thin fingers around the edge of the bed.
 " Honest to goodness, Tin sick of lying down.  It's
 the fourth day now .. ? .
 " Very well, sit up,". Stalin said.  " I see your
 hair has, just been clipped.  Are you an officer ?"
 " Yes, sir.  A Guards_ lieutenant ...."
 " What's your name ? "
 " Murashov."
 Stalin glanced at the doctor on duty, who hastened
 to report that Murashov had several flesh wounds from
 shell splinters ; two fragments had been removed the
 day before, and four left for the next operation.
 " Let them stay there !   Murashov said in. sudden
 animation, and Stalin saw at once that before him sat
 a' man who" was not downhearted and was probably a.
 vivacious young fellow in ordinary life.  " They'll
 make me stronger, that's all! Then only an` armour
 piercing bullet can get me.. ,
 Have  you been at the front long, Comrade
 Murashov ? " U
 " Since the first day of th'e war, Comrade Stalin.','
 " First time you're in hospital ?
 " Yes."
 " Tell  me,  Comrade  Murashov,"  said  Stalin,
 placing his hand on the bed post, " which period of the
 war has been the most difficult for you ? "
 " The first month, Comrade Stalin."
 " I see. And now ? "
 Murashov sighed, but replied with a smile, " it's
 not-.easy now either, of course, to be quite frank.  The
 Germans still have a big advantage in equipment.     And
 their. being so_near- Moscow. makes it hard going.   But
 stilly it's much easier fighting now than it was even a
 month ago."
 " Why is that ? " asked Stalin.
 " In  the  first  place,  Comrade  Stalin,  we've
 changed," Murashov replied. "Our men have seen
 those fascists face to face. We've found out ' what
 they're like, and come to see clearly, very clearly,
 what the threat to our country is .... And we've
 all  grown vicious and merciless in battle. That
 seems to give us more strength And we've all realized
 that., like you said, the devil isn't as terrible as he's
 painted.  Now all of us know that the talk about the
 German army being invincible  is stupid, is plain
 nonsense. Look at the way they're running from us !
 That's what has made it easier."
 "And in the second place ? " asked Stalin..
 " In the second place, the Germans have changed
 too," Murashov went on.  "In a word, they see that
 plundering is a dangerous game.  I've talked with
 German prisoners, Co nrade Stalin.  A month ago
 they still believed they would take Moscow soon, but
 new they've stopped thinking about it."
 " Not even thinking of it, you say ?
 Yes."
 Listening to Murashov, Stalin cast several glances
 at the other wounded men, as though he were trying
 to learn their attitude to what the lieutenant was
 saying.
 " They will confirm it," Murashov said, turning to
 his fellow patients.  " Am I right, lads ? "
 The man lying next to him was very pale ; his right
 arm was amputated.  He grew agitated when Stalin
 approached him, but still not a drop of colour appeared
 in  his  broad,  good-natured face.  Only  his one
 remaining hand twitched several times as it lay on his
 chest beneath the blanket.
 "That's right,"  he said in a  low voice "The
 Germans are a lot weaker."
 On the next cot a man with a bandaged head 'lay
 motionless.  Only his stubborn mouth, turned-up nose
 and big dark velvety eyes were visible.  He had long
 been waiting for the moment when Stalin would
 approach his cot,  and  was fairly trembling with
 impatience and anticipation of the happy moment.
 "The Germans are wheezing, and now's' the time
 to give it to them" he declared.
 With a slight gesture of his right hand Stalin stopped
 the doctor, who had opened his mouth to describe the
 condition  of 'the two men.  It was clear,` without
 his words that their condition was grave, that' they
 were out of the running for a long time, if not forever:'
 Stifling a sigh; Stalin cautiously, so as not to irritate
 the men's greatest wounds, their mental wounds; of
 which the doctor had forgotten, began to ask -them
 where they were from, where they had worked before
 the war, how their families were getting along, whether
 they had children, whether they got letters from home;
 had their names been submitted for decoration....
 Matvei Yurgin lay on the fourth cot, beside the wall.
 He lay `high on several pillows, covered to the' chin
 with a blanket, and as Stalin approached he stared 'at
 him with an expression of such amazement that it
 seemed he would not' be able to keep from crying out.
 It was as though he were seeing Stalin in the' ward for
 the first time.  Stalin realized  that during the few.
 minutes he had been talking with the other men

 Approved For Release 2002/01/17 : CIA-RDP83-00415R013000010003-2
 Yurgin was unconscious and that he had just recovered
 consciousness.
 "It is ... really you ? " asked Yurgin, wheezing
 heavily.  " Really... you ? "
 Yes, it is I," replied Stalin.
 Glancing at Yurgin's leaden-hued face, with its
 black growth of beard on the gaunt cheeks and feverishly
 glittering eyes, Stalin realized that the patient was at
 death's door.  A momentary shadow crossed Stalin's
 face as he sank heavily onto the stool beside the bed.
 He adjusted the pillow beneath Yurgin's head and
 asked, " Feel bad ? "
 Yurgin replied with a look that said he could not
 lie, that he was having a hard struggle against death,
 and did not yet know who would emerge the victor.
 " Take courage," Stalin said.
 Yurgin lowered his eyelids, following the advice.
 Then raised 'them immediately with a glance that
 begged Stalin to lean closer.  Stalin did :
 " Soon ? " Yurgin asked in a whisper.
 Stalin understood.  He bent still lower over Yurgin
 and replied, also in a whisper, " Very soon . . .  ' 11
 Wishing all the wounded men rapid recovery,
 Stalin left the ward and walked into the doctor's office.
 He stood by the window for a moment, gazing silently
 at the forest shining silvery in the pale wintery sun.
 Then, without turning, he asked the doctor behind him
 in a low voice, " Will he live ?"
 " We  have  no  hope,"  the  doctor  replied
 apologetically.
 Stalin turned.   " You must have hope," he said.
 Then he remarked softly, his voice filled with emotion,
 ` An immortal people ! "
 ...Before evening Stalin reached the forward defence
 line, a high, wooded rise beside  the  Volokolamsk
 Highway.
 It had been quiet here for more than two days now.
 Light snowflakes, like dandelion fluff, were falling, and
 although it was windless they floated in the air for a
 long time before coming to rest on the ground.
 Stalin and the small group of generals accompanying
 him walked over to the western fringe of the woods
 where, looking through the spaces between the snow-
 covered alder bushes, one could see a large territory
 with the naked eye.
 That's the village of Lenino, isn't it ? " Stalin
 asked.  His outstretched hand in a woollen mitten
 accidentally touched a alder branch and sent down a
 shower of powdery snow.  " Lenino...... he repeated
 thoughtfully after he had received  confirmation that
 he was right.  Turning suddenly to the generals he
 asked, "By the way, what was the village  called
 before?"
 Without stopping to think, two of the generals
 nearby looked ' simultaneously at their maps, but the
 village in front of them naturally had only one name
 shown on the map, the name given it many years ago.
 Although the faces of the generals were quite different,
 they now both wore the absolutely same expression
 of chagrin at this gap in their  knowledge.   Also
 simultaneously, the generals glanced at Borodin, hoping
 that he would help them out,   but  the   division
 commander, expecting their questioning look, tugged
 the village either.  Feeling that the others might he
 forgiven but that he certainly could not since he and
 his regiment had been holding down positions near
 Lenino for several days now, Ozerov instantly turned
 red, and in search of help looked at the soldiers standing
 nearby.
 " So no one knows ? " Stalin asked.
 At  that   moment  Guards  Sergeant  Andrei
 Lopukhov, who was standing in the group of men,
 pulled himself erect as though propelled inwardly,
 lifting his submachine gun still higher on his chest.
 Stalin instantly noticed Andrei's movement and
 turned   a  calm, inquiring  glance on him. In the
 dark, shining eyes of the tall young man wearing a
 camouflage cape, in the handsome  weatherbeaten
 Russian face glowing wih happiness he saw a bold
 readiness to speak.
 " Do you know " Stalin asked Lopukhov.
 "Yes, Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief ! "
 Andrei replied, taking a step forward.
 " What was the name of this village before ? "
 Comrade  Supreme Commander-in-Chief,  this
 village used to be called Lupikha,"  Andrei replied
 loudly and distinctly, at this moment glad only that
 he had replied without stumbling.
 Stalin also took a step toward Andrei.
 " Are you from Lenino, Comrade Lopukhov ?
 " No, Comrade Stalin."
 " Then how do you happen to know the old name ? "
 " I met a soldier from here, Comrade Stalin.  We
 got to talking, and I asked what the name used to be."
 " And why did you ask ? "
 "Just in case, Comrade Stalin ! "
 Stalin gave a barely perceptible smile.
 " It turns out it wasn't for nothing," he said slowly
 and thoughtfully.  " Yes, our men must always know
 everything. Just in case. So that used to be Lupikha ?','r)
 he went on,  turning  to the  rest.   " A  suitable
 name .... With a nod to the west he raised his voice
 a trifle.  "Here is where we must thrash the German
 invaders, thrash them mercilessly for daring to raise
 their filthy hands against the land of Lenin ! "
 Stalin was about to pick up the binoculars hanging
 on his chest when he again turned to the soldiers.
 " There's no denying they've already taken a good
 beating here," he said, glancing at Andrei, for whore
 he had taken a big liking for his youth and fine military
 bearing.  " But it seems to me they have to be given a
 bigger, still more merciless beating.  I should like to
 know what you think of this, Comrades Guardsmen ? "
 Andrei snapped to attention.
 " Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief," he said
 clearly and boldly, " all the Guardsmen think that it's
 time to kick the beast out ! All we're waiting for is the
 order ! "
 " That's the way to think, Comrades Guardsmen;
 just the way ! " said Stalin seriously.  " Yes, it's time
 to drive those brutal invaders out of our country !
 Like the first, the  second German fascist  offensive
 against Moscow has failed.  The plan to encircle and
 take Moscow has burst like a soap bubble.      That's
 lightly at his moustaches and glanced in turn at Ozerov. 1 The name comes from the Russian verb lupit, which means
 However, Ozerov did not know the former name of       to thrash, to give a beating to.

 clrear both to us and to the German in,aders.  It was
 just for this reason that Hitler left the Eastern Front.
 He decided to choose quieter places to take an airing.
 Ran away because he was afraid.  But he won't be able
 to, escape responsibility.  He'll have to answer for
 everything !
 ' As he picked up his binoculars again Stalin suddenly
 said, " There's going to be a storm."
 All quickly looked around and were  no  little
 surprised to see what had happened to the weather the
 past few minutes while they were listening to Stalin.
 The, sky had darkened, a haze had enveloped the
 woods, the snow flakes were whirling faster than ever,
 and a raw wind came from the fields. With   an
 involuntary shiver they all sensed that in a little while,
 very soon, a mighty .and irresistible Russian snowstorm
 would come sweeping across the lands about Moscow,
 filling the sky with its whistle and roar....

 Subsequently I received a few more communications

 abroad-from the People's Democracies.  True, in
 most cases they came from scientists.  The specialists
 are repeating my experiments with plant organisms

 The assistance of my correspondents and the active
 participation of youth in these experiments give me the
 greatest pleasure. I have not the least doubt that the
 results of the experiments that will be obtained this
 year will make it possible broadly to recommend the
 treatment  of seeds of certain cultures with sodium
 bicarbonate as a new and very effective agricultural
 means of raising yields,
 I am sure that there is many a "dark nook " and

 Interview with N. N. Romanov, Head of the Soviet
 THE 15th Olympic games, which took place between
 July 19th and August 3rd, said N. N. Romanov,
 were the, biggest. events. of this kind ever held.
 About 7,000 men and women athletes representing 70
 countries took. part  in the  competitions.  Foreign
 Press comments were unanimous in noting the fact that
 the participation of the athletes of the Soviet Union in
 the Olympics heightened the interest towards these
 games and lent them great international significance.
 N. N. Romanov referred to the major successes scored
 in the Olympics by the Soviet athletes who established
 2 world, 3 European and 11 USSR records, winning
 106` Olympic. medals, including 38 gold, 53 silver and
 15  bronze medals.  In the Olympic competitions
 which lasted 16 days the Soviet athletes scored 494
 points, i.e., the highest number of points.  According
 to concretized data, the athletes of the USA also scored
 494 points.  The number of points scored by the
 athletes of the Hungarian People's Republic gained
 Sports Delegation
 them a worthy place in the Olympic table after the
 athletes of the USSR and the USA.  Successful results
 were won by the athletes of Sweden, Italy and Finland.
 In conclusion, N. N. Romanov referred to the abusive
 and  unfair  practices  of judges who  deliberately
 belittled the results scored by a number of athletes of
 the Soviet Union and other countries.  As an example,
 N. N. Romanov mentioned the outrageous conduct
 of the. referee in the case of the Soviet boxer Shotsikas.
 At the same time the jury adjudged undeserved victories
 to some of the American athletes, especially in the.
 last days of the competitions.  There is no doubt,
 concluded N. N. Romanov, that with a fair jury in all
 the sports, the athletes of the Soviet Union and of some
 other countries would have been awarded a far greater
 number of prizes.  " In general," declared N. N.
 Romanov, " the Olympic games helped in promoting
 co-operation between athletes of different countries
 and brought out their urge for peace and, friendship."

 most of the contestants gathered in Helsinki have come
 there not only to display their prowess but to help
 cement the ties of friendship among the nations; for the
 people everywhere are eager to strengthen the peace in
 every way they can.
 We in the Soviet Union have always stood for
 friendly intercourse between sportsmen of' different
 countries,  't'eams from abroad are frequent visitors
 to our country and are always accorded  a  warm
 welcome.    Our own athletes, too, have visited other

 The kolkhoz physical culture organizations form
 the basis of the village sports societies.  Membership
 to these organizations is open to everyone from 14 years
 of' age and over.
 All athletic activity in the kolkhoz is headed by a
 council elected at a general meeting of the sportsmen.
 Any member of' the sports society may be elected to
 this council.  It is the council's duty to arrange the
 schedule for athletic meets, create sections in various
 fields of sport, prepare athletes for competitions, etc.
 All physical culture  facilities  and  equipment  are
 placed at the disposal of the members free of charge.
 Village sportsmen participate in contests and athletic
 meets.
 Sections are organized for village athletes desiring to
 participate in one or another field of sport.  In these
 ,ections are formed groups of teams in the most varied
 sports-track and field events,  boxing,  swimming,
 football, basketball, volleyball, wrestling, fencing, etc.

 Statement made by M. V. NESTEROV, President of Chamber of
 Commerce of the USSR, to the. Press Conference held by him
 on 10th. January, 1952 in- the Soviet Pavilion at the
 International Industries Fair, Bombay .
 A i the outset I must thank all of you for your kind
 attendance at this Press conference.
 I would like you to get acquainted in brief with those
 changes which have occurred in the economic life of the
 Soviet State since 1917. I would also like to dwell upon
 the development of the trade relations between the
 USSR and other countries, particularly between the
 USSR and India.
 Thirty-four years have already passed since the work-
 ers and peasants of Russia took power in their own hands.
 Thirty-four years have passed since the exploitation of
 man by man was entirely eliminated on one-sixth of the
 globe.   It is already over thirty years that the Soviet
 peoples have been living as one enormous family, a family
 of toilers.  During this time, great changes took place
 in the Soviet Union.  The Soviet people have achieved
 such successes that humanity is able to achieve only
 in the   new advanced system  of social and state
 order.
 I wish to tell you about these achievements not only
 because they define the face of my country but also be-
 cause they determine relations of the Soviet Union with
 other countries.  In particular, they -determine our
 foreign trade policy.
 Well, the principal change which has taken -place in
 the economy of my country in the course of the past 34
 years, i.e., from the date of the Great October Socialist
 Revolution, is that from a backward agrarian country,
 Soviet Russia has turned into an advanced, industrially
 developed mighty power.
 Now, the Soviet Union not only possesses an advanc-
 ed industry but also renders technical and economic
 aid to other countries.
 Tsarist Russia possessed immense natural wealth,
 but it remained untapped. Russia, I am repeating this,
 was a poor and technically backward country.  Her
 industrial production was confined to only a few ma-
 chines. Nearly all machinery she imported from abroad.
 In those years, Russia was predominantly a country=of
 light industry.  As - regards heavy industries, which
 give a country economic independence, it was poorly
 developed; There was no production of tractors, au-
 iomobiles, many types of machine tools, aircraft, agri-
 cliltural machinery, road-building machinery, electrical
 egj,ipment, chemicals and many many other vital
 prod:?cts.  But even these enterprises which Russia
 had then did not belong to her fully.  Many of them
 were the property of foreign capital. The Russia of those
 times -depended very much on the capitalist
 of the West.  Such was the Russia then l
 It goes without saying that her transformation into
 an advanced industrial country took much effort and
 many resources.
 By 1927- the Soviet people completely restored in-
 dustrial and agricultural production to the pre-war
 level and started moving forward in big strides.  The
 most important role in the economic development of
 my country was played, and continues to be played,
 by the Stalin Five-Year Plans,, on the basis of which
 the planned growth of Soviet economy is effected.
 The First Five-Year Plan. which came into effect in
 1928 was completed ahead of time, in four years and
 three months.  The Second Five-Year Plan (1933-37)
 was completed within the sam time. In 1938, the Soviet
 people started working on the Third Five-Year Plan,
 but it was not completed owing to the attack of fascist
 Germany on the USSR.  Nevertheless, in the thriteen
 years preceding the Second World War, the USSR,
 made the greatest leap from backwardness to progress
 and without any outside help, became a country with a
 powerful, first-class industry. " It has never happened
 yet in the world," the leader of the :peoples of the USSR,
 J. V. Stalin,'pointed out, "that a huge backward agra-
 rian land should be turned into an industrial country
 without plundering colonies, without robbing foreign
 countries or without big loans and long-term credits
 from outside..: We have been able to organise the in-
 dustrialisation of our own forces." (J. Stalin).
 The basic task of the Five-Year Plan was to create
 heavy industry and especially, machine-building industry.
 This task was - successfully carried out.  The Soviet
 Union has built up its own iron and steel -industry, the
 tractor, automobile, machine-tool, chemical, aircraft
 and agricultural machine industries.  This enabled the
 Soviet people to equip with the new technique all the
 branches of the industry and to effect the reconstruction
 of the economy of the USSR.  Apart from the recons-
 truction of the old industrial enterprises, many new in-
 dustrial centres have been set up in different parts of the
 country.
 Here are some figures showing the achievements of
 the Soviet Union during the period from 1917 to 1948.
 In 1913 the national income of tsarist Russia amount-
 ed to 21,000 million rubles ; the national income of the
 U. S. S. R. increased.to 128,000 million rubles in 1940.
 In 1940 large-scale industry of the Soviet Union supplied

 approximately 12 times more industrial output than the
 industry of tsarist Russia did in 1913.  Production in the
 machine-building, and metal-working industries increas-
 ed 41 times over.               In the same year, Soviet industry
 produced 15 million tons of pig-iron., or four times the
 1913 output ; 18,300,000 tons of steel-4.5 times the
 1913 amount ; 166 million tons of coal (5.5 times.more)
 31 million tons of oil (3.5 times more); 38,300,000 tons
 of marketable grain (17 million tons more than in 1913),
 27,000,000 tons of cotton or 3.5 times more than in
 I913,etc.
 Immense successes were achieved by Soviet agri-
 culture which is now the most advanced agriculture in
 the world.  Before 1913, the agriculture of Russia was
 extremely backward.  Land was tilled in a most pri-
 mitive way.                         After the Revolution, land passed over
 to the peasants who united in collective farms and start-
 ed using modern agricultural machinery, taking full
 advantage of the progress of agricultural science.
 In 1940, 523,000 tractors, 182,000 harvester com-
 bines, 228,000 trucks, hundreds of thousands of various
 agricultural  machines were  used in  the  fields of
 the Soviet Union.  This considerably increased the
 production of agricultural products and improved the
 standard of living of the peasants.  The Secor.d World
 War, however, tore the Soviet peoples from tl eir crea-
 tive labour--the Soviet Union having to bear the main
 brunt of the war.
 I shall cite only a few general figures to show you
 what were the losses suffered as a result of the fascist
 invasion.  Indeed, these losses are hard to estimate.
 The direct damage alone inflicted by the Hitlerites on
 the USSR amounted to 679,000 million rubles (or 170,000
 million dollars or 807,000 million rupees).  The fascist
 invaders destroyed. fully or in part, 1,710 Soviet cities
 and more than 70,000 villages.  They destroyed thous-
 ands of industrial enterprises, ruined and sacked 98,000
 collective farms and so or.
 Any other state on sustaining such damage would
 have been thrown back for decades.  This, however,

 A specially rapid increase has taken place in power
 generation. In the post-war Five-Year Plan pefiod the
 production of electric power increased twice over and
 surpassed the pre-war level by 87 per cent. In 1951 the
 Soviet Union produced more than 104,000 million kilo-
 watt hours of electric power-55 times more than pre-
 Revolutionary Russia and more than is being generated
 by the electric stations of Britain and France combined.
 At present there are being built in the Soviet Union
 gigantic hydro-electric stations-the biggest in the world.
 They will generate more than 22,000 million KWH
 annually, which is equal to the total produced by all the
 power stations of Denmark, Finland, Holland, Belgium
 and Spain taken together.  This additional electric
 power will enable us to cut production costs and to sup-
 ply far greater amounts of products at lower costs.
 In 1950' the USSR produced 2.3 times as many
 machines as in 1940 and more than 100 times the
 production of tsarist Russia.
 During 6 post-war years Soviet engineering work
 have mastered the manufacture of more than 1,700
 new models of machines.  There is no machine in the
 world that Soviet industry cannot manufacture. More-
 over, we now produce such machines as are produced
 nowhere else in the world. For instance, Soviet industry
 is  manufacturing a steam turbine of 150,000 kw.
 capacity.
 The increase in production in the machine-building
 industry after the war has led to a further improvement
 in the technical equipment of our agriculture which has
 substantially grown in the last few years.  Thus, the
 increase in production of tractors in 1950 by 3.8 times
 and in the production of combines by 3.6 times against
 1940, as well as the increase in production of other
 agricultural machinery, made it possible for Soviet
 agriculture to receive 536,000 tractors (in terms of 15
 H. P. units), 93,000 grain harvesting; combines (includ-
 ing 39,000 self-propelled  machines) about  850,000
 tractor drawn implements and big quantities of other
 agricultural machinery.  In 1951  almost the entire

 Speech Delivered by M. V. NESTEROV, President of Chamber

 Chamber at Bombay on January 8, 1952
 WOULD like to acquaint this esteemed audience in
 I brief with the great changes in the  economic life
 of the Soviet State since 1917, when the  Great
 October Socialist Revolution took place in Russia,
 i.e., during the 34 years of the existence of the USSR.
 Three decades are but a brief moment in history, but
 these past three decades have no equal in the annals of
 mankind for the social and political developments they
 have brought.  During this period the peoples of the
 USSR have transformed their country from a backward
 agrarian land into a powerful industrial country which
 not only steadily develops without any outside help,
 but is.able to render tangible technical and economic
 assistance to other countries as well.
 Tsarist Russia possessed immense natural wealth,
 but it remained untapped.  Russia was a poor, tech-
 nically backward country.  It produced few machines
 and most of them were then imported from abroad.
 In those years it was mainly light industry that was
 developed.  As for the heavy industry which gives a
 country economic independence, it was poorly deve-
 loped.  Many factories, mills and mines of old Russia
 were owned by foreign capitalists.  The  country's
 economy was greatly dependent on the capitalist states
 of the West.
 The first years of the young Soviet State were spent
 in armed struggle against enemies of the new Socialist
 system ; next, a number of'years was required to rehabi-
 litate the economy destroyed by the war and foreign
 intervention, to regain the pre-war level in industry and
 agriculture.  This was accomplished by 1927.
 Since 1928 economic development in the Soviet
 Union has been proceeding on the basis of the famed
 Stalin Five-Year Plans.  The First Five-Year  Plan
 (1928-1932) was completed ahead  of  time.    The
 same accomplishment was registered in the case of the
 Second Five-Year Plan (1933-1937).  In 1938 the
 Soviet people started work on the Third Five-Year
 Plan but it was not completed, owing to the attack
 of fascist Germany on the USSR.  Nevertheless, in the
 13 years preceding the Second World War, the USSR
 made the greatest leap from backwardness to progress,
 and without any outside aid became a country with a
 powerful first-class industry.  " It has never happened
 yet in the world," the leader of the peoples of the USSR
 J. V. Stalin pointed out, " that a huge backward agra-
 rian land should be turned into an industrial country
 without plundering colonies, without robbing foreign
 countries or without big loans and long-term credits
 3
 from the outside... We have been able to organize the
 industrialization of our country with our own forces."
 (J. Stalin.)
 The main link of the First Five-Year Plan was the
 establishment of heavy industry with its core, machine-
 building.  Only heavy industry is capable of recons-
 tructing and putting transport, agriculture and industry
 as a whole on their feet.
 The Soviet country coped splendidly with these im-
 mense tasks and attained results that are of the greatest
 international significance.  The USSR built up its own
 iron and steel industry, the foundation of industrialisa-
 tion, the tractor, automobile, machine-tool, chemical
 air-craft and agricultural machinery industries.  This
 has enabled the Soviet_ people to equip with new techni-
 que all branches of production and to effect the Social-
 ist reconstruction of the entire economy of the USSR.
 During the subsequent Five-Year Plans the Soviet
 Union attained more, still greater achievements in all
 spheres of economic life.  In the pre-war year 1940 the
 output of large-scale industry in the USSR was 12 times
 above 1913 ! Already by the end of the Second Five-
 Year Plan the USSR advanced to first place in Europe
 for gross industrial output and to first place in the
 world, for the level of technique of production.
 Socialist industry has developed not only in old
 centres, but also in areas where there was no industry
 at all in the past.  During the Stalin-Five-Year Plans
 industrial enterprises have been distributed throughout
 the country more evenly, they have been brought closer
 to the raw material sources and to the consuming areas.
 Especially large has been the growth of industry in the
 republics of Central Asia and Transcaucasia, in the
 Eastern districts of the USSR.  New powerful indus-
 trial centres have arisen deep in the interior of the
 country.
 While before the Revolution Russia had only one
 coal and metal centre in the South, on the initiative of
 J. V. Stalin another coal and metal centre was set up in
 the East (the combination of Urals iron ore and
 Kuznetsk coal) during the pre-war Five-Year Plans.
 In that period the most up-to-date mammoth iron and
 steel mills were built.  Among them are the Stalin Iron
 and Steel Mills in Magnitogorsk, the Stalin Mills in
 Kuznetsk, the Krivoi Rog, Novaya Tula and other mills.
 The Magnitogorsk mills alone produce several times
 more metal than all the works of the pre-revolutionary
 Urals.
 Without Soviet-made machinery the USSR could

 not have its own large-scale industry and mechanized
 agriculture, could not provide the means of production
 to all branches of the national economy.  Huge machine-
 building works outfitted with the latest equipment have
 been set up in the USSR during the Stalin Five-Year
 Plans.  The Soviet machine-building industry is able
 to manufacture the most intricate equipment, machine-
 tools and instruments, all types of the means of produc-
 tion.  It serves as a solid foundation for the technical
 and economic independence of the USSR.  By the
 beginning of the Second World War the Soviet machine-
 building industry grew more than 50 times over comp-
 ared with 1913 and held first place in Europe for its
 volume of output.
 The Soviet Union is the country with the most ad-
 vanced agriculture in the world.  Prior to the Great
 October Revolution agriculture in Russia was extremely
 backward.  The bulk of the land was owned by land-
 lords, monasteries and kulaks.  The peasants, in their
 majority had tiny strips of lands and operated their
 puny farms single-handed.
 In Soviet times agriculture has been fundamentally
 transformed in the USSR.  The October Revolution
 did away with the ownership of the land by landlords.
 The land was declared to be the property of the entire
 people and was turned over to the peasants for free
 perpetual use.  Having become convinced of the ad-
 vantages of collective farming over individual farming,
 the Soviet peasants, with the support ofthe state began
 Co unite voluntarily into producers' co-operatives, into
 collective farms.  Collectivization of agriculture has
 been effected in the USSR under the guidance of the
 Communist Party and the Soviet Government.  Agri-
 culture in the USSR has been turned into Socialist, col-
 lective agriculture, the biggest and the most mechanized
 in the world, capable of applying all the achievements
 of agronomy, of advanced Michurin agrobiological
 science.
 During the Second World War the powerful Social-
 ist industry of the USSR, as distinct from the industry
 of old Russia, proved capable of fully ensuring the needs
 of the front and rear and it enabled the Soviet Army to
 score a brilliant victory over fascist Germany and
 imperialist Japan and  to  liberate the peoples from
 fascist enslavement.
 When the war ended the Soviet people were faced
 with immense tasks : they had. to repair in a short space
 of time the vast destruction caused by the Hitlerite in-
 cursion, to rehabilitate the national economy, and to
 surpass the pre-war level of economic development.
 '1'h.e Stalin post-war Five-Year Plan (1946-1950) was
 subordinated to these tasks.
 The peoples of the Soviet Union bore the main brunt
 of the Second World War and discharged with credit
 their historic mission--they saved world civilization from
 the fascist menace.  To accomplish this the Soviet
 people had to bear tremendous sacrifices in human
 lives and material resources.  The damage caused to
 the USSR by the-enemy is even hard to estimate. For
 example, the fascist invaders destroyed.,in full or in part,
 I,',, 10 Soviet cities and more than 70,000 villages, they
 destroyed thousands of industrial enterprises, ruined
 and sacked ' 98,000  collective  farms,  and  so on.
 The direct damage alone  inflicted by the Hitlerites
 on the USSR  amounted to 679,000 million rubles
 (or 170,000 million dollars at the present  rate of
 exchange).
 Any other state, on sustaining such damage, would
 have been thrown back for decades.  This, however,
 did not.happen and could not happen in the case of the
 Soviet State which relies on planned Socialist economy
 and enjoys the boundless support of the entire people.
 Soviet men and women have once again demonstrated
 to the entire world that a'people liberated from oppres-
 sion and exploitation who have become masters of their
 state are capable of performing miracles.  The post-
 war Five-Year Plan was successfully fulfilled and its
 most important targets were even greatly exceeded !
 The Five-Year Plan envisaged that the output of Soviet
 industry in 1950, the last year of the Five-Year Plan,
 is to be 48 per cent above the pre-war year 1940. Ac-
 tually in 1950 industrial output increased 73 per cent
 compared with 1940.  Soviet industry completed the
 Five-Year Plan ahead of time, in four years and three
 months !
 Last year has brought fresh achievements.  The
 output of Soviet industry increased twice above the pre-
 war level.
 A vast programme of capital construction has been
 effected in the USSR after the war and it greatly exceeds
 the pre-war scope. During the First Five-Year Plan more
 than 350 enterprises were commissioned annually, in
 the Second Five-Year Plan 900, while in the post-war
 Five-Year Plan more than 1,200 enterprises were put
 into operation every year.  Altogether during 1946-
 1950 over 6,000 industrial enterprises were built, res-
 tored and commissioned, this figure being exclusive of
 small state, co-operative and collective farm establish-
 ments.  The basic production plant of Soviet industry
 in 1950 was 58 per cent above 1940.
 All branches of Soviet industry, in the first place the
 entire heavy industry, the backbone of the country's whole
 economy have mace big progress in the post-war years.
 During the post-war Five-Year Plan period the pro-
 duction of steel in the USSR increased 2.2 times.  In
 1951, for example, the increase in the output of steel
 alone amounted to about four million tons, or approxi-
 mately as much as all tsarist Russia produced.    The   !
 Soviet Union now produces approximately as much
 steel as Britain, France, Belgium and Sweden combined.
 The USSR holds second place in the world for coal
 production.  The annual increase in coal production
 amounts to 24 million tons on the average.  The main
 processes of coal production are fully mechanized in the
 USSR.  For the level of mechanization the Soviet
 coal industry has no equal in the world.
 In 1950 the oil industry of the USSR exceeded the
 pre-war level by 22 per cent.  The annual increase in
 oil production amounts to 4.5 million tons.
 The USSR is a country where electrification is pro-
 ceeding on a big scale.  In the post-war Five-Year
 Plan period the production of electric power increased
 twice over and surpassed the pre-war level by 87 per
 cent.  In 1.951 the Soviet Union will produce 104,000
 million kilowatt hours of electric power---55 times more
 than pre-revolutionary. Russia and more than is being
 generated by the electric stations of Britain and France
 combined.

 Prive-s ,te Monte Building i  the USSR
 By A. Silayev,
 17irector, Municipal and Housing Construction Bank of the USSR
 IIOUS1 S for the working people
 are built in th USSR on a vast
 scale. Thus, during the five years
 of 1946---1950 alone, upwards of 100
 million square metres of housing were
 restored or built anew in towns and
 industrial settlements,  and 2,700.000
 houses in the rural communities of the
 Soviet Union.
 While the overwhelming mass of the
 houses in. towns and industrial settle-
 ments is built by the State, there is also
 widespread private housebuilding.
 For  the  construction   of  their
 private    homes  they  are  given
 free  and   for  permanent use plots
 of land ranging from 300 to 500 square
 metres in cities and from 700 to 1.,200
 square metres in industrial settlements.
 The        private  homebulders get
 technical  consultation entirely free.
 And, lastly, their places of work, in
 accordance with a special government
 decree, lend them assistance in trans-
 porting building materials to the cons-
 truction site as well as any other aid
 that may be needed.
 As we see, the state, rendering wide
 assistance to the private hornebuilders,
 pursues no commercial ends whatever,
 but is guided solely by the endeavour to
 further improve the living ctauicfards
 of the working people.
 '.fhe  postwar  Live--year  plait  for
 1946--50 envisaged the construction of'
 private homes aggregating .12,000,000
 square metres of living floor space.
 And this target, high as it is, has been
 exceeded by 200,000 square metres.
 Besides  this,  100,000  new  private
 houses, the construction of which began
 in 1950, has been completed this year.
 To this figure should be added an-
 other 32,00 one-family houses built
 by industrial establishments ,And sold to
 their employees on easy instalments.
 Loans to private homebuilders it,
 towns and in industrial settlements are
 granted by the Municipal and Housing
 Construction Bank of the USSR. These
 loans are issued in the sum of up to
 10,000 rubles repayable by factory and
 office workers in the course of seven
 years and by invalids of the Great
 Patriotic War and families of ser\'ice-
 men killed in the war, in the course of
 ten years.  The interest rate ranges
 from one to two per cent per annum.
 Many factory and office workers, how-
 ever, build their homes on their own
 savings without resorting to the finan-
 cial aid of the State  or taking  only
 small State  loans. This fact testifies
 to the growing prosperity of the Soviet
 people.
 The Soviet State spends large funds

 on municipal improvement, in these

 stores, sparing no means to make the
 life of ordinary man ever letter and

 Glorious Daughter of the Soviet People
 (Commemorating the 10th Anniversary of the Death of
 Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya)
 By Yelena Kononenko, Soviet Writer
 Soviet woman and mother,
 want to speak today in the name
 of millions of Soviet mothers
 who have not forgotten the horrors of
 the war unleashed by fascism. Many of
 us became widows, iiiany lost their
 sons and brothers.  In the last war I,
 too, lost what was most precious to me
 --my sort and daughter who, for their
 deeds of valour, were posthumously
 awarded the title of FTero of the Soviet
 Uniot'.... "
 These stirring words came from the
 lips of a1 Russian woman, from Lyubov
 Kosmodemyanskaya, at the World Peace
 Congress. When she finished her speech
 a storm of applause swept through the
 huge auditorium decorated with the
 flags of all nations,.   The Congress
 delegates were expressing their burning
 sympathy for the mother of two heroes
 who fell in the battle for the freedom
 and independence of their Soviet Home-
 There  is no place on earth today
 where people do not know of the
 immortal deed of the Soviet girl Zoya
 Kosrnodeinyanskaya,  who  gave  her
 life for the sake of peace and the hap-
 piness of all mankind.
 That was ten years ago.   Following
 the dictates of her heart, this Moscow
 schoolgirl joined a detachment of the
 peoples   avengers--partisans-where
 she carried out a number of difficult
 rssignrneuts in the enemy rear. But in
 the village  of  Petrishchevo,   near
 Moscow, Zoya                    was captured  by the
 Tlitlerite hangmen. She refused to arts-
 wcr their                          questions.  Whips whistled
 through the air, biting into her flesh,
 hut still she kept silent.             She was led
 barefoot through the snow.                 Still she
 kept  silent.                  Only in the last few
 seconds before her death did Zoya
 speak.    She.   loosened  the   noose
 about her neck, raised herself on her
 toes, and shouted :
 "Farewell, Comrades! Fight on, don't
 be afraid. Stalin is with us ! Stalin will
 come !
 These words were heard. - by the
 peasant.; of Petrishchevo, whom the
 fascists had driven to witness the  ex-
 c cutiorrr.    The entire Soviet         people

 deep  in     th .  rear  Soviet men and
 women, choked with sorrow and wrath,
 learned of the fearless manner in which
 this simple Soviet girl  had gone to
 her death.
 Zoya possessed  all         the  traits  of
 character which the Communist Party,
 the Young Communist League and the
 great  Stalin  tirelessly train  in     the
 Soviet youth---w!role-hearted,   bound-

 readiness to give all one's s trength,
 intelligence, heart, and life itself, for
 the good of' the people, willingness to
 shield one's Soviet land from the enemy
 with one's body.
 The memory of Zoya Kosmodeni-
 yanskaya lives on in the minds of the
 Soviet people.  The Soviet people, the
 youth, remember Zoya alive, courage-
 ous,  unyielding.    The name  Zoya
 Kosmodemyanskaya has also become a
 symbol for courage, daring and valour,
 to the advanced youth of the world.
 In the Soviet Union leading mines,
 locomotives;  strips   schools, Young
 Communist youth brigades, clubhouses
 and parks     have been  named after
 Zoya  Kpsn~odcmyanskaya.
 Daily  the postman  brings Zoya's
 mother a heap of letters from poeple
 all over the Soviet Union and from
 abroad.
 Here el a letter from a grot p of young
 people vho work at a mac line plant
 in the I trals,  They write :
 We revere and honou:? the me-
 mory of Zoya, who gave  ter young
 life for tike freedom and happiness of the
 Homeland.      Zoya's feat of valour will
 lie forever in the memory of he people.
 Her fC.at of valour will serve as an
 example to Soviet youth rf what a
 Soviet person  should be and  how
 he should fulfil his duty to I is country.
 To he I i ke Zoya is the aim of each of
 us.
 A girl from Prague writes to Zoya's
 mother
 " 1 1 a 1vv helone the men( pry of your
 daughter, who is the bright( it example
 for us, rite Czechiosloavk yc uth . . . I

 on 'h(,n a's grave for me. Yours is a
 great s~ )rrow, but to have sr ch children

 Our youth  will alwayr remember
 Zoya.  Just a few days a! o I visited
 girls' chool No. 211  in Moscow to
 attend a meeting of the se iior classes.
 The t( pie for discussion w~:s friendship

 people.   One of the girls delivered a
 short, poetic report on Zoya Kosmo-
 demyanskaya. She said that in Zoya's
 school copybooks and  her notebook
 there were entries about courage, about
 loyalty, about love for a fiend, about
 the   bliss of being a bra ve fighter."
 All these notes were not just exalted
 dreams, not lofty, noble words copied
 out of a favourite hook. Zoya embo-
 died all these qualities in her life, and
 actions, and she remained rue to them
 to the end of her life.  Her death was
 proof of the truth of    every word in
 her copybooks..
 The girls listened to fl .e report on

 this cost is borne by the state which
 is unflaggingly solicitous for large
 families. This year I received a large

 my fifth child.  In the summer my

 of 500 rubles a month. This is quite
 enough for an old man. But can one sit
 at home when so much development
 work is going on all around ?
 It is a joy to work together with the
 young people.  And our job goes well.
 Stakhanovite work brings high earn-
 ings : in addition to my pension  I
 receive 1,500 rubles a month and even
 more than that.  Besides this, we, old
 workers, receive annually a long-service
 bonus of 5,000 to 6,000 rubles.
 We, old folks, enjoy the respect of
 our fellow workers. Everybody calls us
 The Old Guard. People learn from us
 and draw upon our experience. It is
 rightly said in one of our new songs :
 ...Old age receives its due esteem.

 SIGNING THE APPEAL
 I am a lathe operator. I do my out-
 put quota at the rate of 200 percent,
 which brings  me  high   earnings.
 Last year I spent my vacation at an
 Alpine camp in the Caucasus and this
 year at the Talgor Alpine camp. My
 son during this time was out in the
 country with his kindergarten.
 Could a woman from a peasant or
 worker's family ever dream of such a
 life under the capitalist system. Of
 course not.   A miserable life would
 have been her lot.  This thought in-
 voluntarily arose in my mind when I
 signed the Peace Pact Appeal. And I
 pledged myself to do my job still better.

 Lathe Operator, Rail and Beam-Rolling

 WITH ALL MY HEART
 When I was a child I frequently
 went with my father to the market in
 the village of Ponyri.  And I always
 enviously looked at the pretty coaches
 of the passing trains, bearing the sign
 Moscow-Kislovodsk, in which  mer-
 chants and manufacturers were going
 to the health resort.
 Recently; I spent my vacation in a
 beautiful health-building establishment
 in Kislovodsk.  My accommodations
 there I received entirely free of charge
 from my union at the Azovstalstroy
 Building Trust.
 I shall never forget the superb
 panorama of the Kislovodsk  Park
 and the view of the Caucasian range
 which open up from the " Red Sun "
 Mountain.  Standing at 1,750 metres
 above sea level you breathe the invi-
 gorating air and think how happy the
 Soviet people are.
 I am sincerely grateful to Joseph
 Vissarionovich Stalin, the father and
 friend to all working people, the stand-
 ard-bearer of our triumphs, for the
 great care of us, modest working-men.

 Gardener, Builders' Park.
 MACHINE AND BOOKS
 I first came to Sverdlovsk in 1048
 and enrolled at the gear cutter's class
 of Vocational School No. 1 at Urals
 Heavy Machinery Plant.  Though I
 was doing well in learning my trade,
 foreman Dyatlov once told me :
 ? " I would advise you to enrol also
 at evening school. You would become
 a good specialist."
 Thus, I began to attend a Young
 Workers' Evening School. And simul-
 taneously  with finishing vocational
 school I also finished secondary school.
 At our plant there is a branch of the
 Urals Polytechnical Institute, attended
 by many young workers, including me-
 chanic Nikolai Graf, foreman Yevgeny
 Karzhitsky, to name but a few.
 I am now already a second-year
 student of the Institute's mechanical
 department. The Soviet Government
 has given me the opportunity to work
 and study. And my machine and books
 are my best friends.

 WAR-INVALID LEARNS
 SKILLED TRADE
 During the war I was wounded and
 ;lost   my  right hand  and one eye.
 Though in accordance with Soviet
 law I was at once given an ample
 invalid pension it was depressing to
 feel a disabled man. I wanted to work
 like everybody.
 Before the war  I  cherished the
 thought of becoming a lathe operator.
 Now I had to give up this idea. How
 could I handle a machine tool without
 my right hand ?
 With these thoughts I came to the
 Panfilov Invalid Producers' Co-opera-
 tive where I was at once given the
 choice of several different jobs.  Then
 I hesitantly asked :
 " Isn't there a chance for me to learn
 to be a turner ? "
 Foreman Sogolovsky, Production man-
 ager Pitelsky and shop superintendent
 Dubinsky took counsel and to my great
 joy promised to satisfy my request.
 At first I was given the job of packer.
 A few days later was put to operate a
 stamping press which was fitted with a
 special appliance.  After two months,
 my shop superintendent told me :
 " Now that you have had the preli-
 minary training you may begin to
 operate a machine tool. We have al-
 ready fixed one up for you."
 It was with anxiety that I began to
 operate my lathe.  For me a special
 lathe was fitted out.  Instead of a hand
 clamp which I could not use it was
 equipped with a foot  clamp.  This,
 the foreman took care to provide.
 Seeing that I was actually operating a
 lathe and how the machined metal
 pieces were shooting out of it, I for the
 first time since I was wounded felt a
 powerful joy of life.
 As I changed to new  operations
 my lathe was fitted out with new ap-
 pliances : for machining                                                                                      cylindrical
 parts, for tapered machining, for re-
 moving barbs. Thus I gradually mas-
 tered the turner's trade.
 Now I am a Stakhanovite turner. I
 have long forgotten the bitter thoughts
 of my first days after I was wounded.
 .Again I now feel myself  an able-
 bodied man.
 Perhaps I was just lucky to meet such
 considerate men as our foreman, shop
 superintendent and the others ?  No,
 this is not a matter of chance.  In our
 city, Kiev, a special big training centre
 has been set up for invalids.  It trains
 office clerks, tailors, designers, shoe-
 makers, rate-setters, production mana-
 gers-skilled men in the most diverse
 professions and trades.

 one of the biggest industrial estab-

 'Dv;hamo" Electrical Engineering Plant
 named after Kirov. In its spacious shops
 equipped with first-class machines work
 six Lukakhin brothers. Three are fore-
 men and three turners.
 Toe story of each of the brothers is a

 And they have all received comfortable
 apartments in their plant's houses. The
 new Lukakhin generation-children of
 the three  brothers-attend secondary
 school No. 51(1 in the plant's residential
 quarter.
 Like all Soviet people, the Lukakhin

 By I. Shumai
 Chairman of the-Gogoleva Village Executive Committee, Brovarsky District, Kiev Region
 E had an unexpected  review of our kolkhoz wealth  should live like we, Soviet collective farmers."
 V V this year.  Here is how it happened.
 We were sitting in the office of Mikhail Isaakovich Vir_ar-
 sky, the chairman ofour Chervona Ukraine Kolkhoz, discussing
 various problems, and suddenly we learned that guests had
 arrived at our kolkhoz.
 We went out, together, with the chairman, to meet the
 guests.  We shook hands and got acquainted.  It turned out
 that the arrivals were foreigners-a Canadian delegation con-
 sisting of four people.  One of the Canadians said :
 " We would like to inspect and get acquainted with your
 collective farm husbandry."
 The kolkhoz chairman,  Comrade Vinarsky, replied :
 " This we are always glad to do."  But, he remarked,
 " why didn't you give us a ring from Kiev, we could have pre-
 pared dinner for you....
 Before the chairman had a chance to finish his remark a
 tall Canadian, evidently the head of the delegation said :    t 4
 " You need not worry about preparing dinner for us, we'll,
 only spend about an hour or an hour and a half here, look
 things over, and leave."
 We showed our guests around the farm for a couple of hours.
 They examined everything they wished to see, asked about
 everything in detail, and looked round everywhere. We re-
 turned to the office, and as we started bidding them goodbye,
 one of the Canadian delegates said :
 " But, just the same, it would be good to taste some real
 Ukrainian fat and some of your village-baked bread."
 I replied :
 " The pleasure is yours.  We can take care of that for
 you in no time."
 The guest smiled cunningly and remarked :
 " Don't bother to prepare it.  Let's walk into the first
 house on our way out,and let them treat us to some bread and.
 fat.  Here, let's go into that house."
 And he pointed to the house of collective farm woman
 Artamonovna Timko, who lives right across from the kolkhoz
 office building. We walked in and greeted the hostess, and
 Comrade Vinarsky said :
 "Anna,receive the guests. They would like to taste some of
 your bread and salt...... "
 Anna Artamonovna, the hostess, was, of course, delighted
 to receive the guests.  She covered the table with a beautifully
 embroidered cloth and invited the guests to her neatly furnished
 dining room. On the table were placed plates with jellied meat,
 meat pies, white bread, Ukrainian dumplings with cheese and
 Ukrainian fat that was four-fingers thick.  And along with
 the fat came the wine.
 Raising his glass, one of the guests suggested that as hostess,
 Anna Timko should make the first toast.  She was somewhat
 embarrassed at first, but then got up, and, raising her wine
 glass, she said :
 The guests dined, and then expressed their desire to take a
 look at Anna Timko's individual household. They went into
 the yard and saw her cow, the carcass of a pig killed in the
 morning and a live one in the stall kept for fattening. They
 looked into the chicken house and sized up the flock, displayed
 their interest in the produce which was stored in the cellar, and
 then asked :
 " Does your husband also work in the kolkhoz ? How have
 you managed to acquire such a wealth ofthings ?
 Anna Artamonovna explained that her husband had been
 killed at the front, that she is a widow, a mother ofoour child-
 ren, and that the riches they saw is due to the income she
 had received from the kolkhoz for her honest labour.
 " And where are your children." they inquired.
 Anna Timko took out a photograph and, showing it to the
 delegation, said :  "This is my eldest daughter, Galina, who
 graduated a medical institute, and is now employed as a doctor.
 The others, her daughter Shura and two boys, Ivan and Alexei,
 she called over and introduced to the visitors.  The children
 were dressed well.    She told them that Shura is in the 10th
 grade, Vanya in the sixth, and Alyosha is in the second grade.
 The delegation left.  They were unable to take in every-
 thing in that two-hour visit.  True enough, they saw the kolkhoz
 stock farm sections where everything is mechanized, the narrow-
 gauge road, the machines for cutting and steaming feed. They
 saw our graded livestock; they know that we have 1,400 head of
 dairy and 2,200 heads of other cattle, that there are over 4,200
 birds in the poultry flock, 433 horses, 245 bee families in the
 hives, and that 118 hectares are planted to fruit trees and berries.
 The guests learned that the cash income of the kolkhoz
 amounts to no less than two million rubles.
 And that which they did not have time to learn about or see
 they could have inspected if they only had stayed longer. New
 stables for 120 and 80 heads of dairy cattle respectively, are
 being erected according to the last word in technique-with
 canalization and monorail system for transporting feed to the
 cattle.
 Electricity is used eectensively both on the farm as
 in the homes.
 There are 85 intellectulas in Gogoleva village-teachers,
 doctors, agronomists, veterinaries ...... It is interesting to
 note that a great many of them were born and raised here.
 They left their native village to obtaina higher education and
 after graduating returned to work here in their speciality.
 There are three schools in the village-a 10-year, 7-year
 and elementary school, which are attended by more than
 1,300 children.
 The inhabitants of Gogoleva  receive 370 newspapers
 every day, and subscribe to more than a hundred magazines.
 The villagers own dozens of motorcycles and over 350
 radiosets. There are about 3,000 books in the village library.
 Our collective farmers work well and live a well-to-do
 " Here is wishing that all the Canadian working people . and cultured life.

 USSR Kasymov, one of the most ac-
 complished interpreters of the role of
 Othello, appeared at the end of June
 in a concert at our club.
 The enhanced cultural requirements of
 the collective farmers are a consequence
 of the rise in their material well-being
 which is growing with the expansion of
 our commonly-owned economy and
 growth of its income.  A definite sum,
 constituting two percent of the total
 income of the collective farm, is allo-
 cated for cultural work. In 1949, when
 our income amounted to seven million
 rubles, we appropriated 140 thousand
 rubles for cultural requirements.  Last
 year's income of our collective farm
 considerably exceeded 12 million rubles,
 and this year we anticipate an income
 of at least 20 million rubles.  The cul-
 tural fund of the collective farm will
 thus greatly increase. This means that
 the collective ? farmers will be able to
 spend their leisure hours in a still better
 and more interesting way.
 come from the fields, bright electric
 lights flare up and the kishlak (village)
 revives. Work is in full swing during
 the day on the cotton plantations, stock
 farms, smithies.   Only the aged and
 the children remain at home, and even
 they in the sultry mid-day heat, seek
 shelter somewhere in the shade.
 Full of Life and Happy Laughter
 In the past, life would die down in
 the kishlak at sunset.  Our villages
 would be plunged in profound dark-
 ness, and rarely would the usual quiet
 be disturbed.
 Now, the evenings are full of light,
 music and happy laughter of the youth.
 We have a large, handsome club on
 our collective farm. Collective farmers
 come here to see a new film, to hear a
 concert. And although the auditorium
 is spacious-it has seats for 800 spec-
 tators-it cannot house all who wish to
 attend.  Twice weekly we are, there-
 fore, showing films directly in the field
 camps.
 Cosy and inviting is the reading room
 in the evenings.  Here there are al-
 ways fresh newspapers and magazines,
 as well as a rich choice of fiction and
 technical literature.  The central col-
 lective farm library contains approxi-
 mately 7,000 volumes in all branches
 of knowledge.
 The dance is a most favourite form
 of Tajik art.  To the sounds of the
 doira, our girls whirl in beautiful ring
 dances.   Often, long after midnight,
 when the doors of the club and the
 library are already closed, the sounds
 of the doira, the songs and laughter of
 the youth come from the dark greenery
 of the gardens.
 Radio Network
 The radio is taking an ever more
 considerable place in the cultural life
 of the village. Loud speakers have been
 installed in the production sections and
 collective farmers' homes. The collec-
 tive farm radio relay station is daily
 broadcasting the latest news and or-
 ganizing broadcasts by the foremost
 workers in agriculture-brigade and
 team leaders.  In the evening, on re-
 turning from the fields, collective far-
 mers have an opportunity of listening-
 in to radio concerts often including per,
 foi* races by ou rrrusidal  ircles.
 Among the frequent performers in
 radio concerts are our gifted musician,
 collective  farmer  Girez  Faizulayev,
 whose playing on the dutar is highly
 expressive, the violinist Talib Kinjayev
 who has distinguished himself in the
 amateur art contest of our Republic,
 Makhmadi Tagayeva who has mast-
 ered to perfection the playing on the
 gizhak (a national string instrument)
 and many others.
 Our amateur musicians not infre-
 quently develop into professionals. We
 have sent two of our finest musicians,
 Satar Purgayev and All Kasymov to
 the Stalinabad Music School.  They
 have now graduated from it and are
 working as artists in the State Phil--
 harmonic.
 Frequent Literary Evenings
 After the working day the youth
 brings liveliness and gaiety to the sports
 grounds.  These   are   particularly
 thronged in times of football matches
 and volleyball team competitions.
 Very popular is the collective farm
 lecture centre. We arc organizing lec-
 tures and talks on various subjects of
 interest to collective farmers, not only
 in the evenings in the lecture hall,
 but also in the daytime during the
 dinner interval in the field camps. Scien-
 tists of the Tajik Academy of Sciences
 frequently visit our collective farm to
 tell us about their work.   Literary
 evenings are also organized in the
 lecture centre.  Recently, for example,
 Mirzo Tursun-Zade, the well known
 Tajik poet and Stalin Prize winner,
 came to us.      At the request of the
 collective farmers, he told: us of his visit
 to India and other countries of the
 East, and recited his new poems.
 Agricultural Schools
 Numerous circles and courses for at-
 taining                                                    greater knowledge in 'agri-
 culture are working in the lecture
 centre during the winter.  This year
 we organised a three-year collective
 farm school comprising two field-hus-
 bandry and one zootechnical group.
 Here collective farmers acquire a se-
 condary agricultural education. A spe-
 cial " collective farm university " has
 been opened for brigade and team
 leaders, timekeepers-where problems
 of calicctive farm production are :>i^urdieil?
 Striving For Knowledge
 Cultural  transformations  are,  of
 course, characteristic not only of our
 kishlak.   All  conditions  for   rest
 and spiritual growth of the peasants
 have been created in every collective
 farm of our Republic, just as in ours.
 Striving for knowledge has become a
 characteristic feature of the collective
 farm population. Let me cite only two
 figures in confirmation of these words.
 Last year 250 lectures were delivered
 in our district on literary, philosophic
 and social subjects which were attended
 by over 23,000 persons. I do not know
 a single collective farm which has not
 its radio relay station, cinema instal-
 lations, libraries.
 Collective farm villages are impro-
 ving and becoming more beautiful year
 by year. A prosperous and cultured life
 has come to the home of the Tajik.
 And can it be otherwise in the Soviet
 country where everything is done for
 the happiness and good of the people ?
 From the bottom of our heart, we
 thank our Soviet Government and the
 great friend of the working people,
 J. V. S'takii, for these great cha'n'ges:
