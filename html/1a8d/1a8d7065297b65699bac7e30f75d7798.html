 MIDDLE EAST
 PRAVDA DEFENDS USSR EGYPTIAN POLICY ON EVE OF '~.aDAT U~S~ V1SIT
 On the eve of Egyptian President as-Sadat's vl.r3it to the United
 States, Moscow i~as  finaJ.ly responded rat an aaa~:horitative level to
 his aeries of increasingly detailed criticier~r.fr of Soviet behavior
 with a 25 October PRAVDA "Observer" article?  Moscow frequently
 uses this vehicle to give an added ring of rsu,thority to stan~l~rd
 positions, but the current article takes on ridded significance
 since it is the first article on Soviet-Egy~~tian relations attributed
 to Observer since May 1961.*  While the article did not attack
 as-Sadat by name nor mention his U.S. visit directly, its publica-
 tion on the 25th was a transparent rebuttal of his c*atements and
 clearly timed to coincide w~+.th his departure from Cairo for the
 first afficial visit by >n Egyptian president to the United States.
 The article has also been widely publicized, with TASS carrying the
 full text and Moscow radio broadcasting summaries and. installments
 in Arabic and other languages.
 As in earlier, low-level Soviet comment., the Observer article
 ostensibly responded tc "Egyptian press'" criticism of Soviet
 Mideast policies, in particular Moscow's relations with Cairo?
 It broke no new ground in critical comrnent on Egypt or on the
 Sinai II accord, but did recapitulate '~Koscow's past position on
 several '.cey divisive issues in Soviet-Egyptian relations since
 the Gctober 1973 war.  The underlying message was that Sovi^t
 s~.ipport to Egypt in the past had been generous and consistent,
 and that as-Sadat was unwise ,and unjustified in turning to the
 United States for aid and closer ties.
 Moscow has saj.d tittle abour_ is-Sadat's U.S< visit.  TASS items on
 the 2.7th and 29th sought through selective citations to contrast
 as-Sadat's optimistic expectations of U.S. ai.d with American
 hesitancy to provide such assistance.  Similarly, IZVESTTYA
 politicral observer M. Mikhaylov, on Moscow radio's weekly roundtable
 *  The 1961 PRAVDA Observer article r_ame in a period of Soviet-
 Egyptian recrimina*_ions over Egyptian anticommunism, and followed
 a meeting in Moscow between Khrushchev and an Egyptian parliamentary
 delegation led by as-Sadat, at which kllrushchev lectured the
 Egyptians on their lack of understat:ding of socialism.  Cairo's
 AL-AHRAri in June 1961 released Khrushchev's remarks and a subse-
 quent as-Sadat reply insisting, then as now, on Egyptian inde-
 pendence and rejecting the idea that communism and capitalism are
 the only alternatives.

 on the 26t1i, recalled U.S. aysuranceg to Israel on financial and
 military aid in conjunction with the Sinai II accord and alleged
 that Wae~~ington recently indicated "in response Lo Israeli
 inquiries" that Egypt "will not receive any substantial credits"
 during as-Sadat's U.S. visit or before the 1976 U.S. presidential
 election.
 SOVIET-EGYPTIAN       In defending Soviet policy toward Egypt, the
 RF.LA'!'IONS          PRLIVDA Observer emphasized  that Moscow,  unlilGe
 the Western powers,wae responsive to Egypt's
 requests and requirements for economic and military assistance
 after the July 1952 revolution.  Observer's message to Cairo
 appeared to be that it would not be in Egypt's best interests to
 turn away from ties with the USSR and toward uncertain relations
 with the United States.
 -I-  Economic assistance.        Recounting Mos~;_ow's past economic aid,
 Observer recalled that after the 1952 revolution Egypt was able
 to obtain reliable economic support unly from the socialist
 countries, and that this supp~irt had steadily expanded until some
 148 industrial projects had been undertaken with Soviet assistance.
 Observer underlined that these projects had brought Egypt sub-
 stantia~, revenues and increases in living standards.  Referring
 to the Aswan hydroelectric complex and the Helwan u/etallurgi_cal
 works, Observer contrasted the Soviet and Western attitudes toward
 these projects, asserting ghat "former colonial powers, one after
 another, rejected participation in building Aswan and expanding
 the Helwan combine."
 Observer's historical review of So~iE~ aie; to Egypt culmin::ted in
 ai image that epitomized the ingratitude of those who "from the
 pages of some Egyptian papers" had der:.ded  tba ~ignificarice of
 Soviet assistance, even though "perha*+s when scriLbling t:~eir
 slander-packed articles, they were doing so under the electric
 light coming from A,wan."
 -4-  Military aid:  Observer reflected. strong resentment over the
 "shameless distortions" regarding Soviet military assistance to
 Eg?,7Pt.  Contrasting Soviet and Western attitudes, Observer.. recounted
 the hist..ory of Soviet military aid to Egypt since 1955 through the
 October 1973 waz Observer ~smphasized thst Moscow. had responded to
 an-Nasir's f;rst requests, had "fully restored" Egypt's June I9F7
 losses with top-quality reglacemerts, and during the 1973 war had
 provided "uninterrupted flow by sea and air of Soviet arms and
 ammunition to Egypt and Syria."  Observer asserted that 3.n view
 of Moscow's record, c~n.i.y "utter shame~.essness" would enable anyone
 to claim, "as some are doing now," that "Egypt then receivsd from
 the Soviet Union 'several  bagfuls  of spare parts."'

 Q~aerver capped the historical reviww with an implicit warning that
 unless Cairo shaped up, it might. not receive the arms still out-
 standing under already concluded contractf~--part of which, as-Sadat
 complained in a Kuwaiti press interview on 22 October, "are being
 withheld tods~y."  Thus Observer defended Soviet post-war military
 aici to Egypt as fulfilling obligations "under existing agreements,"
 but cautioned Cairo that "this is lcnown to be a ?~ilateral thing.
 ('ooperation cannot develop if one of the sides follows the line
 of undermining it."
 +  USSR-Egypt treaty:  Clearly referring to as-Sadat, Observer
 complained t113L' 'same in Egypt" claimed that the 27 May 1971 Soviet-
 Egyptj.ar- treaty of friendship and cooperation was practically
 imposed on Egypt.  Observer said that it was a "strange sort of
 forgetfulness" not to .recall which country was the first to raise
 the question of a treaty, and he explicitly recalled that as-Sadat--
 in a 2 June 1971 speech--had said that "we wanted the treaty" and
 "I have sought to sign the treaty with the Soviet Union in the
 name of our future and the future of our children."
 As-Sadat in fact did say, in his 28 September speech, that Egypt
 had sought a treaty in the an-Nasir era, but the Soviet Union had
 at ,*.hat time refused.  He recounted his astonishment when Podgorn}-y,
 during his Msy 1971 visit to Cairo, all but pleaded for t:he conclu-
 sion of a treaty.  As-Sadat in effect implied that Podgornyq could
 not re+:urn to Moscow without ane, citing him as sayLng that "the
 Politburo has adopted a decision authorizing me to conclude a treat}'
 witl: you" and as arguing fur it "in every possible way."  As for
 Observer's charge of "forgetfulness," as-Sadat had leveled the Fame
 accusation against the Soviets in an earlier speech when he said,
 on 15 September,  thz: they had "a weal: memory" a?..d thought that he
 was "not paying atte~:tion."
 -1-  llebt Repayment:  Con~astent'.fith past Soviet reticence, Observer
 avoided any mention of the divisive issue ~~= Cairo's debt repayments
 for past economic and military aid.  As-Sadat has repeatedly cited
 this as one of his two main problems with tt?.e Soviets, along with
 the arms issue.  Moscow`s only known allusiun to the matter, an
 Arabic-language commentary last June on the reopening of the Suez
 Canal, implied that the new source of hard currency from canal
 fees should help alleviate Egypt's financial difficulties, w:~ich
 had caused it to seek financial a3.d from oil-producing countries
 and "the postponement of repayment of foreign debts."

 Moscow apparently has rebuffed Cairo's attempts to renegotiate the
 terms and schedule of repayment.  Egypt's  finance: minister said
 in a statement to the Kuwaiti magazine AT,,-'V~AQAZAH, reported by
 Cairo's MILDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY on 28 Octot~er, that L'g,ypt intended
 to repay a],1 its debts to the USSR, even though ''Moscow does not
 want to dive Egypt a period of grace as a b;reather."  In July
 the finance minister had led a delegation to Moscow for talcs on
 this subject; the talks from 22 July-2 August) evidently ended
 without resolution.  ~uviet media, for their part, barely
 acknowledged the visit and were uninformative on its purpose or
 outcome.*
 ARAB-ISRAELI      The Observer article strongly denied charges--made
 ISSUE             by as-Sadat on several occasi~.cis--that the USSR
 had provoked Syrian and other Arab criticism of
 the Sinai II accord.  Observer broached the accusation in a lead
 paragraph, citing it as an example of how far soma "Egyptian press"
 allegations against the USSR had gone and regretting that "r-~,:,se
 urho determine [Egypt's] policies" had not renounced the charges.
 Observer's defense took the tack that the Arab criticism demonstrated
 support for the Soviet position on a comprehensive Mideast settlement
 and that the terns of the Sinai II accord itself had motivated the
 critici.gm.  Observer suggested that Egypt should blame itself for
 signing the accord, rather than "placing the blame at the wrong
 door and accusing the USSR of undermining Arab unity.
 Recalling major criticisms of the accord, Observer essentially
 restated points made in Soviet and Arab media over the past two
 months.  For instance, the article asserted that El;ypt had retrieved
 .a "neg~igibly small part of its territory" while at the same time
 "blunting the urgency" of regaining the other occupied Arab
 territories and insuring Palestinian rights.  Observer particularly
 objected to the presence of U.S. personnel in the n:w disengagement
 zone, criticizing this aspect along lines of previous Soviet
 ~caa~nent as "a new element in the Mideast situation, fraught with
 far-rreaching dangerous consequences."  As had previous Soviet
 comment, Observer drew an analogybetween the U.S. presence to the.
 Sinai and the U.S. involvemen.c in Vietnam, which had expanded from
 ~~'the introduction of a relatively small number of American
 ~persont?el . "
 ~AdVocating a comprehensive Mideast settlement, Observe~.r reaffirmed
 '.positions Moscow has long been on record as favoring:
 ~~I-  Elements of a settlement:  Observer reiterated Moscow's standard
 three prerequisites for a comprehensive settlement: cempl.ete Israeli

 withdrawal from all Arab lands occupied in June 1967; assurance of
 the Palestinians' "legitimate national rights, including the right
 to create their own stale"; and the assurance of independent
 existence and development of ail states in the region.
 +  Geneva conference:  Observer reaffirn.CU *.hat the Geneva conference
 wou11 provide "an appropriate international m~:chznism" through
 which a com~,rehensive Mideast sattlement could be achieved, and
 reiteLated that "all sides directly involved in the conflict" must
 take part, "'.ncluding the PLU, as well as the USSR and the United
 States as ccnference cochairmen."
 -1?  "Partial" settlements:  Reviving a formula initially set forth
 in a 22 April 1975 Soviet-);gyptian communique and referred to only
 occasionally since then, Observer stated that the USSR does not
 reject the possibility of partial or interim agreemen':s but that
 "such partial measures must constitute a component, integral part
 of a comprehensive  settlement" and be "~aorlced out and adopted
 within the framework of the Geneva conference i;i full."  Observer
 also echoed some of Moscow's initial criticism of the Sinai II
 accord--expressed, for example, in a 7 September article by
 IZV1aSTIYA's Mikhaylov in MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA--that the USSR remained
 opposed to the use of the Geneva conference "as a screen for
 approving steps undertaken  to obviate the conference."

 PEI3raeli issues has reemphasized Peking's differenti aged
 vistas of the two superpowers' policies in the Middle Eaet.  An Lnusua lly
 har.~ah PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article treated as the latest in a
 series of Soviet maneuvers against the Arab cause the recent Soviet-
 Israeli bilateral contacts, which culminated in talks between the Soviet
 and Israeli foreign ministers at the UN General Assembly on 24 SeptemLer.
 The belbted issuance of the Commentator article a month later--on
 25 October--seemed to be timed to coincid with Egyptian President
 ae-Sadat's arrival in the United States on the 26th.  Peking's NCNA
 reported rresident Ford's welcome for as-Sadat in Waslti~lgton on 28 Oc tober
 in a brief:,  straightforward account  typ;Lca1  of  Chinese tnediai  handling  of
 high-level U.S.-Egyptian contacts.
 Tlie latest PEOPLE'S  DAILY Commentator article was  tl~e first authoritative

 in two years, as well as China's first public assessment of the U.S.- Soviet
 balance of power in the Middle East since the second Israeli.-Egyptian
 Sinai disengagement accord was initialed under Secretary Kissinger's
 auspices on 1 September.  The article, as well a~ a companion 25 October
 NCNA commentary, depicted Moscow's position in the Middle East as
 "weakening" and "extremely difficult," noting that the Soviets were
 "being expelled here and there."  The "other superpower" was seen as on
 the "offensive" and as "energetically pushing shuttle diplomacy in th e
 Middle >;zst," causing Moscow to resort to closer ties with Israel in order
 to ah~re co its sagging position.
 Commentator. explicitly speculated on the li::elihood of resumed Soviet -
 Israeli diplomatic relations as a result of the Gromyko-?:111on meeting last
 month, portraying such a step as the latest in a series of alleged Soviet
 moves against Arab interests.  Commnentator reviewed p~t~t Chinese charges
 of Soviet willingness to allow Jews residing in the USSR to emigrate  to
 Israel and of Moscow's alleged refusal to supply sufficient arms to Arab
 forces.  The NCNA commentary added that the Soviets have attempted to woo
 Israel to support Moscow's Geneva conference peace plan by affirming  "once
 and again their readiness to 'guarantee Israel's security' at the expense
 of the interests of the Arab countries and the Palestinian people."
 Underlining its warning to the Arabs, Commentator claimed that Moscow was
 "capable of anything, however foul," in its fierce struggle against the
 United States for influence in the Middle East.  Commentator asserted
 that avowed Soviet support for international revolutionary causes was
 belied by the fact that Moscow had "desperately hung on to the political
 corpse of the traitorous Lon Nol clique" in Cambodia and that Moscow was
 endeavoring to "sabotage" Korean reunification by "flirting with the
 South Korean Pak Chong-hui clique."

 SING-SOVIET RELATIONS
 MOSCOW SEES INCREA~ED PRC f~OSTILITY, SING-U.S. DIFFERENCES
 Moscow's continuing critiicism of China took a new turn recently
 when 'PASS Director General Leoni~l Zamyatin claimed on Soviet
 television and radio that Peking had further escalated its hostillCy
 toward the USSR.  Speaking on 24 October on a biweekly Moscow
 domestic radio panel discussion of international issues, Zamyatin
 said Peking was  unleashing a new phase of its struggle against
 the Soviet Union" and cited specific Chinese actions allegedly
 designed to curtail bilateral r.~lations.  The radio on the 24th
 reported that Zamyatin had made s~;~:~.lar charges on Soviet tele-
 vision.
 Charges similar to 7.amyatin's were first made three days earlier
 in a TASS commentary ly Vladimir Goncharov, reprinted in the
 central newspapers the next day.  In rebutting Peking, Zamyatin
 and Goncharov went bey~~nd the usual litany of complaints about
 Chinese foreign policy to cite specific actions affecting bilateral
 relations that allegedly proved Peking was nor limiting itself
 to "propaganda attacks."  Both seemed concerned to discredit the
 -iotiun that Peking might be showing an interest in normalizing
 relations at this time.  Goncharov asserted that Peking had delayed
 the signing of the 1975 trade agreement, and "as a result" the
 level of bilateral trade this year had dropped in comparison with
 previous years; Zamyatin said that Sino-Soviet trade had been "halved."
 T/iese charges came less than three months after Moscow radio's
 announcement of the 1975 trade agreement, reporting that trade
 was scheduled to reach a volume of 211 million rubles, approximately
 the 1974 level.
 Both Zamyatin and Goncharov also assailed Peking for thwarting the
 1975 convening of a regular bilateral cenfere^ce on navigation
 in sections of rivers that form part of the Sino-Soviet border.
 This joint conference is xarely mentioned in Soviet media.
 Despite this renewed focus on problems in bilateral relations, there
 has been no suggestion iti Soviet media of any increase in the level
 of military tension between the two countries.  Zamyatin's charges
 were offered not to justify any Sovj.et action but to answer unnamed
 persons who had "recently" suggested that Peking favored the
 normalization of "interstate relations" between the USSR and China.

 U, S.-SOVIET RELATIONS
 PRAVDA, IZVCSTIYA EYE A1TTiu!OES. ROLE OF U.S. CONGRESS
 A sophisticated Soviet appreciatian of the role of the U.S. Congress
 in foreign policy and of the vaxiety of political philosophies and
 personalities represented in i.ts membeLship is conveyed in a recent
 series of PRAVDA and IZVESiIYA correspondents' articles based on
 interviews with Senate and House members.  The articles illustrate
 a movement away from the use of cold war ster~~types recently
 characteristic of some, if not all, Soviet observers of the U.S.
 political scene.
 Clearly written to add "human interest" to the news from Washington,
 the current articles serve to reinforce Moscow's current cot-cerns
 about  the emerge~icc. of  trends hostile to detente in o.f. f icial
 Washington.  The overall tone of the articles is optimistic,
 however, and th? correspondents conclude from their interviews
 tnat the prospects for a further c?evelopment  of detente are good.
 The PRAVDA article, written by Washington correspondents Vasilyev
 and Kolesnichenke, appeared in three installments published on
 17, 21 and 22 October.  The IZVESTIYA article, written by Vitaliy
 Kobysh, was published on the 1$th and the 25th.  Both were based
 primarily on interviews with Congressmen who have been strong
 supporters of the Administrations's d:atente policy.  H~wevcr, the
 interviewees also included Senators T~iurmond and Stevenson, whose
 positions Moscow has had occasion to c:'iticize in the past.
 Kobysh noted that "the role of Congress in U.S. political life has
 grown markedly in recent years" and concluded that "if you want a
 broad picture of U.S. political life, you must climb 'the Hill'
 from time to time."  The PRAVDA series, by focusing on the d;.versity
 or Congressional views, served to emphasize the difficulty of
 maki?ag flat predicl.?ions about the outcome of issues on Capitol Hill.
 At one point PRAVDA offered a description of Congress not unlike
 some conventional Western analyses:
 It is an Enormous con=.;ry, contradictory and varied.
 And the political spectrum of Congress is just as varied.
 ThP personal views of a Senator or Member of the House
 of Representatives, his business ties and the special
 features o.f his electoral district are interrelated
 Lactors which determine a particular legislator's position.

 The  PRAVllA        cor.~rcepondent?s  indicated one  rearaon  for  rekl.ndled
 SuvieL-  interest.?  in Congress,  noting tl~-at  "tltc atl'~.tude of  legislature
 on Cr.pitol ltill toward the Pentagon's demands is changing, and
 quite markedly so. s.n recent times."
 The IZVRSTIYA article did not hide the fact that one of its
 purposes was to measure the scope of the difficulties being faced
 by detente in the wake of what Soviet media have seen as increased
 activity by its opponents.  Kobyeh, like PRAVDA's correspondents,
 attempte~l to allay any concern by their readers on this question
 by concluding that "the disposition of forces in the United Staten
 has nut changed.  He q~loted Representative Clement Zablocki's
 admonition not to forget to point out "that rill 15 presidential
 candidates for the nomination of eitY~er party, with mayb.: one
 exception, have expressed themselves clearl}~ in support of the
 policy of detente."  Perhaps reflecting a vfew prevalent in Moscow
 as well, Kobysh concluded by quoting Senator Kennedy's answer to
 his question about the key to a fur~cher development of U.S.-Soviet
 relations:
 The key lies in the success of the current SALT talks;
 ~rery much depends on when and with what they end.

 f.or.ell;n pollc~7 ac; among  the lssucs under.  di.apute withl.n  the  party
 leadership.
 Cn his major article In KOMMUNI.ST No. 14, signed to the prec;s on
 2~i September, Cromyko clcarl.y set forth an apologia f.or the reg~mc's
 foreil;n pol:lcy whi;.h  seemed desl.vned as rt proi;ram document  for the
 25th patrLy coctl,r.ess.       'ihe  forelgn mlt:i.ster.  placed particu.l.;tr  stress
 on the importance of the "agreements and understandings" reached
 between the United States and the Soviet Union, which he el:;ewherc
 deycr.ibcci ao the result primarily of "fruitful summit-level.
 negotlaeions."  In malting this point, the foreign mirir;ter used
 phraseology with polemical overtones.  "Tl~e only neuple wlio
 cannot see this (i.e., the value of U.S.-Soviet agreements),"
 wrote Gromyko,~ure those who do nut- understand the essence of the
 processes taking place in the world.  Neither in this paragraph
 nor in preceding or folloh7iug ores was eher~ any indication
 that this rebuke was aimed solely at foreigners.
 A defense of summitry was also offered in PRAVDA and I7,VESTIYA
 edl.torials in fo?.lowing weeks.  On 29 September PRAVDA echoed
 Gromyko's praise of detenta, noting that the irapruvemr_nt in U.S.-
 Soviet relations had been "promoted primarily by Soviet.-American
 meetings at the summit level."  I7.VESTIYI, on 21 October offered a
 somewhat broader endorsement or summitry in the context of commenting
 on the then recently completed visit of Pre~:ident c;iscard d'Estaing to
 the USSR.  "R.ecent events demonstrate particularly vividly," it said,
 "the important role of summit meetings for the solution of major
 international problems and ;he levelopment of coope~'ation be;.ween
 stltes."
 Along t~ith these tints of defensiveness, other Soviet authors have
 been making a case for detente in terms clearly designed to appeal
 to communist  rather than Western readers.  One example was an article
 by I. Gureyev in the journal WORLD ECONOMY AND INTERNP.TIONAL RELATIONS,
 tdo. 10, signed tc this press on 17 September.  He argued, in effect,
 that d2~ei~te provid+ad the best possible conditions for the achievement
 of communist goals, both domestically and in terms of foreign policy.
 Thi~? line of Soviet comment has comp?emented the series of articles
 authtrEd by such Americanologists as Arbatov and Trcfimenko and
 aimed at presenting the case for detente in terms calcui2ted to
 appeal  to Western n:i.nds.

 treaty was a Soviet-('ostered framework designed to ;justify Moscocv's
 heavy military presence in East Germany and continued Soviet
 hegemony to East Europe under terms  of the Iirezhnev doctrine of
 "li.mited soveYeignty."  The articJ.e focused on the treaty's
 affront to the German people's desire for reunification, claiming
 that  L-he "Iirezhnev clique" wanted  to  "keep Gersr_Zn?~ in perpetual
 division" in order to "lord it over Europe," and i.t noted that
 Moscow would continue to defy the "will of. the German people and
 interfere in their internal affairs in a most lsigli-handed manner."
 The East German radio reported on 28 C-ctober that the CDR foreign
 minister took the unusu~? step of calling in the Chinese ambassador

 the GDR radio said lsad been carried in PEOPLE'S DAILY.

 SINO-KOREAN RELATIONS
 HUANG HUA CALLS UN ATTENTION TO U.S. TROOPS IN KOREAN QUESTION
 China''s UN representative Huang liua, speaking on 21 Uctober. against
 U.S. proposals for n Korean settlement and in favor or? tr Peking-
 sponsored UN draft resolution un Korea, essentially reiterated the
 lLne  traced earlier by PRC Foreign MiniF,ter Chico  Kurui-hua in his
 26 Septembr~r UN speech.*  Huang's UN speech, However, did employ
 harsher characterizations of the U.S. presence in Korea than Chino i~ud
 used.  liuan~;liua described as "downright deception" the U.S. arguments
 about  L'he need  EaL  a "balance of  forces"  in Kor::a,  chr~rginl; that  tl-e
 presence of "large numbers" of ~.5. troops in the South puse% a
 "grave menace" to the security of the North.  Iiuang Hua also accused
 U.S. troops in the ROK. of carrying out "armed provocations," a
 charge not known to have been made by Peking at such an authoritative
 level in more than three years.
 As~.de from his unusually toLgh denunciation of U.S. troops in the ROK,
 Huang followed Ciiiao's lead in explicitly linking dissolution of the
 UN Command with thz withdrawal of U.S. troops from the South.         He
 also remained silent on two key issues--the DPRK's claim that the
 end of the UN Command would mean the end of the armistice and Pyongyang's
 position that the RO': lras no right to participate in discussions aimed
 at cuntiuuing ttte armistice.  Like Chico, Huang did, however, call
 the U.S. proposal that parties to the armistice convene a conference
 to discuss ways of preserving the armistice "of no avail and
 completely i-npractical."
 POLEMliCS WITH MOSCOW        A 24 October NCNA correspunde.nt-'S report
 Ohl KOREAN ISSUES            reiterated Huang's harsh portrayal of the
 U.S. presence in Korea, and it went on to
 argue that "certain countries have no reason to meddle" in the
 reunification issue, which it called an internal affair Koreans must
 settle themselves.  Reflecting Sino=Soviet tensions on the Korean
 issue, NCNA renewed Chinese accusations of Soviet perfidy against the
 DPRK and of Moscow': "hypocritical stand" on Korean reunification,
 claiming that Mo:ecow had alw.3ys oppose~.d Pyongyang's principle of
 "independent" reunification.  NCNA charged that the Soviet Union finds
 it necessary to "grossly alter" the customary DPI2IC slogan of ":independent
 and peaceful reunification" into "democratic and peaceful" reunification,
 a phrase frequently used by Moscow in discuFSing DPRK reunification
 proposals.  The report characterized Soviet support for Korean
 reunificatian as a "sham," charging that recent Soviet contacts w~~th the
 Seoul government reflected Soviet efforts to create "two Koreas."

 :#n an authorital-ive 25 October 1'1:OPLL' S 'DAILY Comment:aL-or's  article
 focused mainly on Soviet Middle Last policy, Peking included a
 ?         charge  that Moscow ltas "flirterl" with the Palc government,  "maintaining
 unusual relations with it" in order to "sabotage" ICorean reunification
 and gain inf?.uence in no1?tlieast Asia.  NCNA reports on two nongovernmental
 RO1C delegations to Moscow in Sepl-ember and earlier this month had
 charged that the visits revealed Soviet "collusian" with Seoul aimed
 at obstructing Korean reunification.  This same theme also appeared 3.n
 Peking's last extensive propaganda attack on Moscow on the Karean
 issue--a November 1974 NCNA correspondent's report rebutting Soviet
 charged that Peking was prepared to sell South Korea red peppers and
 countercharging that Moscow was engaged in "collusion" with Seoul and
 attempting to create "two Koreas."
 PEKIIJG MARKS WAR VOLUNTEERS ANNIVERSARY, NOTES SECURITY TIES
 Chinese comment on the 5th anniversary of the entry of the Chinese
 People's Volunteer's (CPV) into the Korean War focused on the historical
 importance of Korea to China's security.  Peking marked the quinquennial,
 as it had in 1970, by sending to Pyongyang a friendship delegation
 composed of former C',iinese People's Volunteers.  In addition, Peking
 noted the 25th anniversary with a  joint PI;OPL1;'S DAILY-LIBIRATION ARMY
 DAILY editorial, just as had beer. done for the previous, 1970
 quinquennial anniversary.  In the DPRK the anniversary was marked
 with a rally and banquet for the PRC delegation, traditiona:I wreath-laying
 ceremonies for the CPV dead, including one at the grave ~f Mao Tse-tung's
 son, and the customary NODONG SINMUN editorial.
 Speaking at a 24 October anniversary banquet in Peking, CCP Palitburo
 member Chen Hsi-lien reiterated the Ch-l~rse claim that the victory in
 the Korean war "dEfended the security of China," an assertio-~ not
 raised by Chinese speakers at past Peking anniversary functions since
 1970, the last quinquennial, although Chinese speakers at Pyongyang
 observances of the CPV anniversary d;d make the same claim in speeches
 in 1972, 1973 and again this year.     The 25 October joint PEOPL);'S
 DAILY-LIBERATION ARMY DAILY editorial, as had a similar joint editorial
 marking the anniversary in 1970, charged that the United States had
 intended to invade China during the war.  The editorial also included a
 Kim I1??song quote about the close links between the Chinese and Korean
 peoples' struggles for safeguarding their security.  The 1a~t time
 Chinese comment on the CPV anniversary had included a similar qucte was
 in 1971.
 ?         CHINESE COMMENT ON    Chen's speech comments on the U.S. presence in
 U.S. PRESENCE         South Korea appeared softer than those he made
 on the anniversary last year.  This year Chen
 '         called the presence of "U-S. aggressor troops" in South Korea the "root
 cause" of tension in Korea and the chief obstacle to reunification, and

 he offereri routine Chinese support for the I)PRIC's demand that the UN
 Command be dissolved and U.5. troops withdrawn from the South.  Iiy
 contrast, last year Chen had charged that under iJ.S. "aegis" the Pak
 government was disrupting the North-South dialog and suppressing the
 South Korean people, and he had demanded tha~ she United States
 "immediately" stop Interfering in ICcrea's internal affairs and lead
 ^,alled for U.5. troops to "pull out of South ICorea without delay."
 Similarly, this year's point elitorial eschewed a harsh portrayal
 of the UPS. presence in the South, focusing instead on the current
 UN debate on Korea anc?  the Chinese-supported draft rr?rsol~itioii on  the
 Korean question.
 At the 24 October Pyongyang mass meeting, the head of the PRC friendship
 delegation,  Li C1-ih-min,  a former political commisF;ar of  the CFV,
 oi~fered the standard Chinese characterization of the U,S. presence in
 the Soixth,  accusing  the United  States ~,f  supporting the Pak regime  in
 sabotaging the North-South ~a~.lcs, in carrying out military provocations
 against the North, and in suppressing the South Korean people.  Li called
 for dissolution of t!ie UN Command and withdrawal of J.S. t;:oops.

 ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS     The economic agreements concluded by the
 Vietnamese delegation in Eastern Europe
 appeared to be geared to Ilanoi's upcoming 1976-1980 five-year plan
 and to involve assistance in the form of long??term loans, rather than
 outright aid.  By contrast, throughout the caar years, when long-term
 Vietnamese planning was not feasible, Hanoi had concluded economic
 aid agreements on an annual basis.  Last year's agreements with
 East European countries were not uniform but for the most part
 wr:re described as covering economic, scientific, and technical
 cooperation for 1975 and did not mention loans.*  Planning for
 long-range economic cooperation had been under discussion in the
 summer of 1974, however  when DRV Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi led
 an economic de~egation to Eastern Europe co hold (:elks on long-term
 economic coordinai:ion.**
 This year Le Thanh Nghi reportedly signed agreements ir. all four
 countries covering economic caoperation during 1976-1980.  The
 inclusion in the agreements of long-term credits ~~aas mentioned
 in all of the point communiques except the one signed with
 Czechoslovakia.  While Prague media havQ not been heard to mention
 loans to Vietnam, Hanoi reports on agreements signed in Czechoslovakia
 did indicate that long-term loans were included.
