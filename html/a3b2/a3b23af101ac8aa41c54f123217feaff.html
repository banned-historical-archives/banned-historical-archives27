 China: Demand for Foreign Grain
 The People's Republic of China almost certainly will
 continue to import about 10 million metric tons of
 grain annually through 1980. The dramatic increase in
 grain purchases since the post-Mao changes in leader-
 ship has resulted both from the leveling off of grain
 production in 1975-77 and from the move to upgrade
 living standards.
 Several major factors will affect grain imports during
 the remaining years of the 10-year plan (1976-85). Of
 first importance will be China's progress toward
 meeting the highly ambitious plan for producing 400
 million tons of grain annually by 1985, which implies
 nearly a doubling in the historical (1958-75) rate of
 growth of 2.2 percent; continuation of historical
 growth would result in production near 350 million
 tons in 1985, still a substantial gain over the 295
 million tons reported for 1978 (see figure 1). Popula-
 tion growth and demand for higher incomes and higher
 food rations together will exert continuing pressure on
 Beijing (Peking) to buy foreign grain. Grain distribu-
 tion will also be a factor-imports will continue to be
 needed to feed coastal urban centers, thus reducing the
 internal procurement burden.
 Collective livestock production is now considered by
 the government as the way to provide more meat for
 the urban population. Collective livestock raising
 requires a substantial input of feedgrains and thus will
 compete more strongly for available grain. At present,
 livestock in China consume far less than 10 percent of
 the grain supply.
 Transporting the larger imports of foreign grain to the
 northern cities, the main consuming points, presents
 few problems. Grain-handling facilities in the northern
 ports and the requisite urban transportation systems
 are good. Transporting ever higher levels of grain from
 rural China to the cities, however, is the problem. The
 recent increase in imports of foreign grain helps reduce
 the strain on rural transportation.
 China's ability to pay for foreign grain at present is not
 in question. However, as commitments and negotia-
 tions for foreign industrial machinery and technology
 accelerate-they now involve a total of more than $40
 billion-Beijing will wish to keep expenditures on
 grain as low as possible. Thus, over the next several
 years the Chinese leaders will be attempting to find a
 balance among grain imports, industrial imports, and
 mortgages on the future.
 China: Grain Production 1949-19851
 Million Metric Tons
 Expansion of the grain storage system is necessary as
 the population grows, and this also adds to total
 demand for grain. Grain storage for practical and
 strategic reasons is extremely important in China.
 Since the nutritional needs of the population are
 narrowly met, a vast storage program is essential in
 order to prevent malnutrition and starvation during
 years of poor harvests.

 We estimate Chinese grain production in 1978 at 295
 million metric tons, the first substantial increase since
 1975 (see table 1). The leveling off of production in
 1975-77 had resulted in stock drawdowns and tight
 rations, which the new leadership is trying to rectify
 through increased grain purchases in the short run and
 through increased agricultural investment in the long
 run.
 US Secretary of Agriculture Bergland, during his trip
 to China in November 1978, was told by Vice Premier
 Li Xiannian (Li Hsien-nien) that China would be
 importing "something over 10 million tons of foreign
 grain per year," and that "5 to 6 million tons would
 come from the United States." The number of years
 China will be importing at this level was not made
 clear, but the time period implied was for the next few
 years, presumably while the agricultural sector is
 catching up with rising demand.
 Two projections of Chinese grain output to 1985 are
 shown in table 2. The high estimate reflects China's
 goal for the 10-year plan (1976-85) of 400 million tons
 by 1985. The 1980 projection of 330 million tons is
 consistent with the estimated growth rate for 1978 and
 the 1985 target. The low estimates for 1980 and 1985
 are extrapolations of the 2.2-percent average annual
 growth rate between 1957 and 1975-both years of
 average weather. The years 1976 through 1978 (when
 the weather was poor) were not used to calculate the
 trend, because their inclusion would introduce a
 downward bias in the projections for 1980 and 1985.
 For the next seven years, 1979-85, the high series
 implies an average annual increment of grain produc-
 tion of 15 million tons, the low series, 8 million tons.
 The Chinese goal of 400 million tons can be achieved
 only with an unlikely coincidence of favorable condi-
 tions. To reach the goal, the high-priority political and
 economic commitment of the regime to the agricul-
 tural sector must be maintained; every aspect of the
 development program-fertilizer, irrigation, mechani-
 zation, and seed research-must proceed on or ahead
 of schedule; and good weather will be required. On the

 series is in table 4.
 other hand, China probably will do better than the
 historical trend because the massive development
 programs, already in train, will begin to pay off.
 For two decades the level of per capita grain produc-
 tion has not risen significantly above 300 kilograms
 (kg) per year. The grain ration has not increased in this
 period. We have seen no indication that the Hua
 government is considering an increase in the ration. On
 the other hand, the government is moving toward
 allowing limited free market sales of grain which have
 been illegal. Such sales would exert upward pressure
 on the demand for foreign grain; less domestic grain
 would flow into government channels because less
 would be available for above-quota government
 purchases.

 ' Midrange estimates as projected by the Bureau of the Census,
 Foreign Demographic Analysis Division, in March 1978.
 Adult grain rations in China normally average 30 to 40
 catties ' per month, depending upon physical need, but
 may drop to 25 or below if the local harvest is bad.
 Urban dwellers are less subject to wide changes in the
 grain ration than are the peasants. Adolescent children
 may have larger grain rations than their parents, if, for
 example, the parents are not engaged in heavy work
 requiring high food rations. A child of 10 might receive
 24 catties, and a child of 5 might receive 20 catties or
 less.
 Vegetable oil is usually rationed at a half catty a
 month per person. The sugar ration is often the same as
 vegetable oil. In recent years the rationing of pork in
 the cities has become more common. A typical pork
 ration is 1 catty a month per person.
 Table 3 shows the overwhelming importance of grain
 to the Chinese diet. The grain ration may be made up
 of a combination of several grains or flour. In the south
 it is usually rice, and in the north it is mostly wheat and
 coarse grain. Sometimes sweet potatoes are part of the
 grain ration, at a weight ratio of 5 to 1. Rice, wheat,

 reports, represents actual consumption.
 coarse grain, or flour contain about 1,750 calories per
 catty,' while potatoes contain only 350 calories per
 catty. Vegetables play a very important part in the
 diet, not only for food value (vitamin content), but also
 for variety.
 Nutritional requirements of people vary among coun-
 tries and depend upon such factors as climate, average
 size of the people, and number of hours worked per
 day. Estimates of how much nutrient is needed for an
 ideal diet also vary. Estimates by the UN Food and
 Agricultural Organization (FAO) for Asian centrally
 planned nations show a daily per capita consumption
 level of 2,170 calories and 60 grams of protein. The
 FAO estimates that this amount meets 92 percent of
 human food requirements. The International Vegetar-
 ian Society claims that a per capita level of about 2,000
 calories and 60 grams of protein is more than enough
 food, provided the diet includes enough sources of
 alkaline elements, such as green leafy vegetables,
 which the Chinese diet does furnish. The Society also
 claims that there is no need for animal protein.
 For most people in China today, the diet is just
 adequate to preserve productive efficiency. Due to the
 strict rationing system for foods making up over 90
 percent of caloric intake, there is only a small variance
 in average consumption levels, so that the great bulk of

 Approved For Release 2007/02/28: CIA-RDP83B00551 R000100060009-4
 the populace is at or near the average. FAO estimates
 of human food requirement for an ideal diet have long
 been on the high side, and are decreasing over time;
 furthermore, FAO data sometimes rests on per capita
 "availability" of food in a country-the figures thus
 include a considerable element of waste, and losses,
 and do not represent actual consumption-whereas the
 data for China in table 3 represent what is actually
 eaten. Notwithstanding the technical sufficiency of the
 average Chinese diet, most people look forward to an
 improvement in quality and quantity. Under the
 relaxed political climate in Beijing, a demonstration by
 peasants "from all over China" was recently held in
 demand of democracy and human rights. One of the
 main complaints was that "there is not enough food to
 eat."
 Beijing declared a general wage increase in October
 1977, which benefited three-fifths of China's urban
 workers, mainly in the lower income brackets, and
 which averaged perhaps 10 percent overall. Since then
 the reinstitution of bonuses for high productivity has
 further raised the average income level.
 Although in most cases the wage increase was moder-
 ate, the aggregate effect on the demand for food has
 been substantial. We have seen a jump in food prices in
 China's free markets, which is strongly correlated with
 the wage increase. At least part of the government's
 decision to increase grain imports appears to be the
 result of an increase in demand for food. Urban
 Chinese on the average spend just over half of their
 income on food.
 Rural incomes by and large are determined by the size
 of the harvest. Average peasant incomes in the north
 are lower than peasant incomes in the south because
 per capita production in the north is lower. Peasants in
 general have always earned less than city folk. To help
 rectify the urban-rural income disparity the govern-
 ment has pursued a long-term policy of lowering the
 price of farm inputs supplied by industry, lowering
 rural taxes as a percent of output, and raising state
 procurement prices of farm products.
 Since the "Agriculture First" policy was formulated in
 1962,2 the government has given special consideration
 to the northern peasants by importing grain into the
 major northern cities, thereby reducing rural procure-
 ment in the area. To further support northern peasants
 and reduce the load on the rural transport system,
 Chinese officials now appear to have made a medium-
 term commitment to maintain a higher level of grain
 imports.
 An alternative method of supplementing the grain
 supplies in northern cities is shipping rice up from the
 south. Very little of this is done, however, since
 transportation is expensive. Furthermore, the limited
 amount of surplus rice may be sold abroad and much
 greater quantity of wheat bought in return; wheat
 products such as noodles and breads are traditional
 northern foods.
 Through both necessity and tradition the Chinese have
 not been accustomed to a high-meat diet. Neverthe-
 less, per capita meat consumption in China is so low at
 present, that a marked potential exists for growth in
 China's livestock industry. As incomes have risen, the
 people have demanded more meat, and the government
 has begun to respond to this demand.
 In the major suburbs, notably of Beijing, Shanghai,
 and Guangzhou (Canton), the government is building
 (sometimes with foreign help) modern, mechanized
 hog and chicken farms. We do not know the extent of
 this development. The Chinese have announced the
 recent completion of three modern chicken farms in
 the Shanghai area, which have raised a total of
 210,000 chickens in eight months, and a foreign-built
 pig farm near Beijing that raises 10,000 pigs per year.
 Recently, the Chinese also have purchased from
 Australia a facility for raising chickens.
 z Instead of conducting the agricultural sector as a holding operation,
 the government began injecting sizable amounts of resources into
 agriculture from industry.

 The trend toward modern feed-lot animal husbandry
 breaks with Chinese tradition, and, in the future,
 feedgrain could compete seriously with grain for
 human consumption. At present, well under 10 percent
 of the grain supply is used as animal feed. Most hogs
 are raised on private plots, and are fed almost entirely
 on poor-quality forage crops such as weeds and tops of
 root crops.
 The recent developments in livestock raising notwith-
 standing, we doubt that China will be importing large
 amounts of animal feedgrain before 1985. The 10-year
 development program for the whole economy is so
 ambitious that it seems unlikely that China would use
 much of its scarce foreign exchange to increase the
 meat supply.
 The preoccupation with obtaining a buffer supply of
 food is shown in the often-quoted words of Mao, "Dig
 tunnels deep and store grain everywhere." The leveling
 off in grain production in 1975-77 resulted in stock
 drawdowns that Beijing no doubt viewed as an
 impairment in the general Chinese defensive position
 and in the ability to meet specific emergencies such as
 the Tangshan earthquake of July 1976. Nevertheless,
 the primary function of grain storage in China is to
 ensure that the minimum grain needs of the population
 are met at the lowest cost. To minimize transportation
 costs, each production team, production brigade,
 commune, county seat, and city has its own storage
 facilities. After the grain is harvested, the portion to be
 distributed by the production team and brigade is
 stored at this primary level in storage facilities
 operated by the collectives. Grain acquired by the
 government through taxation and procurement is
 stored in government facilities at the commune and
 county levels or is shipped directly to urban areas.
 We have no reliable figures on the level of Chinese
 grain stocks; some estimates are as high as 50 million
 tons. We do not know what grain stocks are included in
 the calculation of national grain stocks. We think it

 China employs two types of storage, granaries and
 open-air storage. Granaries are generally located near
 cities, county seats, and commune headquarters.
 Open-air facilities are used at all levels and are the
 main form of storage at the production level. Civil
 defense tunnels and caves are also used as granaries.
 Approved For Release 2007/02/28: CIA-RDP83B00551 R000100060009-4
 Granaries are warehouse-type buildings in which grain
 is stored in either bulk or bagged form. Bulk storage is
 used for grain that has a low moisture content or that
 will not have to be handled shortly after arrival. Three
 methods of bulk storage are used. The first is to simply
 store the grain loose in the granary; this method has
 the advantage of using the entire capacity of the
 granary, but the disadvantage of possible structural
 damage to the facility from pressure exerted on the
 walls by the grain and of an increase in quality-control
 problems. Another method of bulk storage is the use of
 round, xuezu bins in the granary constructed of straw
 or reeds; these have the disadvantage of significantly
 lowering the capacity of the granary. The most
 common method of bulk storage in the granary appears
 to be the use of bagged grain piled up to form an inner
 wall as added protection for the loose grain. This
 method increases capacity over bin storage and im-
 proves quality control over general bulk storage.
 A large quantity of grain is stored in the open. The
 methods of storage are similar to those used inside a
 granary-stacked bags, bulk inside bag walls, and in
 xuezu bins, except in this case the bins are shaped to
 facilitate rain runoff and are covered with thatching.
 Silo construction has been expanding rapidly since the
 introduction of a medium-sized silo during the Cul-
 tural Revolution (1966-69). The silos have been
 replacing the open-air xuezu bins. These structures
 range in capacity from 10 to 250 tons. The major
 advantages of these structures are their low construc-
 tion costs (construction materials are clay, straw,
 bricks, and rocks); their protection against rats, birds,
 dampness, fire, and earthquakes; and their ease of
 adaptation to mechanized grain handling.
 The major differences in Chinese and Western meth-
 ods of storage stem from the differences in the
 availability of labor and construction materials. Chi-
 nese grain storage is very labor intensive. For example,
 the Ta-hsing-lou granary near Xi'an (Sian), Shaanxi,
 with a capacity of 18,500 tons, employs 127 people-
 very high by US standards. The difference in availabil-
 ity of labor is the major reason grain is shipped in bags
 in China and in bulk in the United States. Present
 storage methods seem to meet Chinese needs with
 minimum losses. A rapid move toward foreign storage
 technology, grain-handling equipment, and grain dry-
 ers seems unlikely except at the major ports.
 China's plans to increase regional crop specialization
 through the development of 12 large "grain bases" and
 an unknown number of industrial crop bases will not
 substantially alter the current methods of storage. The
 major effects will be increased strain on the transporta-
 tion system and an increase in grain-storage capacity
 in those areas designated as grain bases (see figure 2).
 Increased Grain Imports and Internal Transport
 If China continues to import grain at current levels
 (approximately 10 million tons per year), the urban
 transport system can handle the amounts without
 undue stress. Because the grain will be unloaded at
 port facilities in major cities, transport distances and
 scheduling problems will be minimal. Almost all of the
 movement will be by rail directly to urban or county
 distribution centers, with some participation by trucks.
 This pattern was employed as long ago as the 1920s
 and 1930s to meet urban demand for food. The
 distribution of an additional 10 million tons of
 domestically procured grain would pose far greater
 problems of transport. In the latter case, native
 transport (carts, tractors) would have to move the
 grain to local distribution centers from which short-
 haul trucks would then convey the grain to railroads or
 inland waterway ports for transport to the cities.
 We know of no big grain losses since the late 1950s
 stemming from inadequate inland transport. Some loss
 may be inferred, however, from the ship delays and
 port congestion of the early 1970s. Inadequate port
 capacity, not inland transport, was the culprit in this
 case. But with the additional port capacity derived
 from new berths and better equipment in recent years
 (more is continually being added), unloading has been
 speeded and ship delays shortened.

 Ports
 Ten major ports are involved in the grain trade, with an
 estimated annual capacity to unload 17 million tons of
 grain. Only two of the ports, Shanghai and
 Guangzhou, are equipped with modern facilities to
 unload grain. The other ports use a combination of
 mobile pneumatic unloaders, grab-type portal cranes,
 or shipboard cranes.
 Unloading facilities with a capacity of about 5 million
 tons have been completed during 1976-78. The modern
 handling facilities at Shanghai account for almost 3
 million tons, the special grain berth open in 1978 at
 Guangzhou adds another 1.5 million tons, and the
 remainder is the result of new general cargo berths and
 cranes added at other ports.
 The grain port at Shanghai, which can handle about
 8 million tons annually, comprises four berths, six
 pneumatic loaders, a conveyor system, 18 silos, and at
 least 10 warehouses. Guangzhou has at least one grain
 berth, two pneumatic unloaders, a conveyor system,
 and 21 silos, and can unload about 1.5 million tons
 annually. The grain berth at Luda (Dairen) is served
 by a battery of 16 silos, but unloading is done by
 portal cranes or shipboard cranes. Using this and other
 berths, Luda can unload 2.5 million tons of grain
 annually. Most of the imported grain goes through
 Shanghai and Luda. Berths devoted almost exclusively
 to the grain trade are also located at Qiingdao
 (Tsingtao), Lianyungang, (Lien-yun-kang), Yantai
 (Chefoo), and Zhanjiang (Chan-chiang) (see figure
 2).
 Although grain is unloaded more efficiently at spe-
 cially equipped grain berths, it can be unloaded at
 almost any berth at any port. In fact, large quantities
 of grain are unloaded at general cargo berths at
 Xingang (Hsin-kang) and Tanggu (T'ang-ku), as well
 as at general cargo berths at Shanghai, Luda, and
 Chingdao. Using shipboard or dockside cranes, grain
 can be unloaded directly into trucks or rail cars and
 moved immediately out of the port area. The grain can
 also be bagged at the dockside and either shipped out
 or stored.
 Storage
 Capacity of grain-storage facilities, both silos and
 warehouses, at Chinese ports exceeds 500,000 tons.
 Assuming that grain will be stored an average of seven
 days at the ports, existing storage capacity could
 accommodate 26 million tons of grain imports annu-
 ally if the grain flowed in steadily. This is in excess of
 unloading capacity but does provide a cushion as grain
 imports are not evenly spaced throughout the year.
 From Port to Consumer
 Grain makes up about 10 percent of the total tonnage
 moved in the modern transport sector. Of the total
 tonnage of grain loaded onto the various modes of
 transport, trucks carry 38 percent and railroads and
 waterways, 31 percent each. Grain represents about
 5 percent of the total rail freight both in absolute
 tonnage and ton-kilometer terms. With the growth of
 motor transport, an expanded road network, and
 centralized state grain procurement, many feeder
 roads now join scattered communes to the rail and
 water networks. Some 15 percent of total truck traffic
 is given over to grain. Grain makes up 30 percent of
 total inland waterway freight. Although all inland
 waterways are important in the transportation of food,
 most of the flow occurs along the Yangtze River, which
 passes through the major rice areas in Sichuan
 (Szechwan) Province and the so-called rice bowls of
 the middle and lower Yangtze Valley. Finally, 10
 percent of the total cargoes shipped along the coast
 consist of grain.
 Rail freight volume of all types doubled in the period
 1970-77 and is scheduled to double again in 1978-85.
 The unused capacity on existing railroads combined
 with additional capacity resulting from new and
 double-track construction and other improvements will
 permit increased traffic without squeezing operations.
 Moreover, the unused capacity at rolling stock plants
 probably will suffice to accommodate increased de-
 mand for hoppers and boxcars for grain transport.
 Production of such rolling stock increased 75 percent
 between 1970 and 1977 and can be increased further to
 meet expanded grain requirements. Motor transport
 and inland waterways have even more unused capac-
 ity, hence potential, than railroads do. Overall then,
 transport can cope with foreseeable grain imports
 without substantial detriment to normal traffic.

 Since the first major grain imports took place in 1961,
 China has used short-term credits to smooth out
 payments for grain purchases. Imports from Canada
 and Australia have routinely been financed on 12- to
 18-month terms, probably at commercial rates. Some
 of the US grain purchased in 1973 and 1974 through
 third-country firms was also under short-term credits.
 Present US grain purchase terms are all cash. In 1978
 the US Congress authorized credits of the Commodity
 Credit Corporation (CCC) for Chinese grain pur-
 chases, but China has not shown interest in using them.

 Million Tons
 6.8

 CCC lending rates are currently 10.5 to 11.5 percent
 per annum for three-year credits.
 Variations in China's grain imports have reflected not
 only crop fluctuations, but also changes in the balance-
 of-payments position. China severely reduced grain
 imports during 1975-76 as the foreign exchange
 situation became unusually tight (see figure 3). The
 People's Republic of China also drew down stocks and
 reduced local food rations. As the balance of payments
 improved in 1977-78, imports of grain rose. Beijing's
 newfound willingness to incur substantial foreign debt
 will facilitate maintenance of a more stable level of
 grain imports in the future.

 CHINK:   THE ECONOMIC OUT~O0K
 Executive Sur^ary
 This year, and in 1980-81 as well, China's post-Mao
 leadership will be concerned primarily with realigning its
 long-term program for economic modernization.  The leader-
 ship's reassessment of pace and priorities was summed up
 by Premier and Party Chairman Hua Guofeng at the National
 People's Congress (NPC) in late June:
 The work of recovery and development in
 the previous two years (1977-78) has yielded
 results far in excess of our expectations.
 But the grave effects of the sabotage by Lin
 Biao anti the Gang of Four cannot be eliminated
 in a short period.  We did not take this into
 full account and some of the measures we adopted
 were not sufficiently prudent. [As a result, it
 is] absolutely necessary that we concentrate our
 efforts within these three years [1979-81] on
 readjusting, restructurin , consolidating, and
 improving our economy.   [Emphasis added]
 Aside from the forthright discussion of current dif-
 ficulties, Hua and other officials gave out an unprece-
 dented number of economic statistics that generally
 confirm their appraisal of economic recovery in 1977-
 78.                   On the other hand, the new policies are forcing
 a slowdown this year in the rate of growth of industrial
 production and a sharp reduction in budgetary appropria-
 tions for capital investment projects.  For the first
 time in many years, China's managers have been directed
 to emphasize quality, product mix, and cost effective-
 ness rather than sheer output.
 unciassified memorandum was prepared by the'China Division of
 Gfice of Economic Research, National Foreign Assessment Center,
 .:: response to a request from the Nati             v Counc 1.  Ques

 The five major objectives under the slogan of
 readjustment center around:
 -- Praising growth rates for foodgrains and
 other farm products in relation to population
 and industry.
 -- Increasing the growth rate of consumer goods
 production, both for domestic consumption and
 to expand exports.
 -- Assigning higher priority to energy, trans-
 portation, and communications.
 -- Cutting back an "gverextended" investment
 program so as to concentrate resources on
 completing vital projects.
 -- Raising the incomes of rural and urban workers.
 The new policies of restructuring and consolidating
 require an "overall reform of t e structure o  economic
 management."  While efforts in this regard are still
 experimental, they apparently are expected to evolve into
 some uniquely Chinese model of market socialism in which
 local authorities are given greater powers over planning,
 investment, finance, material supply, and foreign trade.
 Policies in the improvement category are aimed at raising
 labor productivity and capital efficiency.
 Despite the revamping of economic strategy, China's
 leaders insist that their need for foreign equipment,
 technology, and capital remains large.  What is new is
 that their shopping list now is more practically focused,
 reflecting a better appreciation of the high costs of
 acquisition and the difficulties in absorbing foreign
 technology.
 The comprehensive character of all that Beijing is
 attempting to accomplish in 1979-81 has inevitably up-
 set the targets and timetable of the 10-year plan for
 1976-85 announced early last year by Chairman Hua.  That
 :"'-:i--or "draft outline" as Hua now calls it--has been de-
 ci,.red overly ambitious and hastily conceived; neither it
 its first phase, the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1976-80),
 1.' gi':en much mention at present.  The State Planning
 1sson, having revised the original version of the

 Approved. For Release 2007/02/28: CIA-RDP83B005.51 R0001 00060009-4
 annual plan for 1979, is currently reworking earlier plans
 for 1980 and 1981.   A draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan
 (1981-85) will not be presented to the NPC until sometime
 in 1981.
 Finally, we believe that the policies of realignment
 and retrenchment may be in place longer than the three
 years now envisaged:
 -- Institutional changes proposed under the
 new policies seem too far reaching to be
 completed so quickly.
 -- Leadtimes required for bringing new invest-
 ment projects into production in bottleneck
 sectors are such as to make it unlikely that
 these constraints will be lifted by 1981.
 -- In a country as poor and populous as China,
 the problem of matching supplies to consumer
 demand will necessarily be around for a long
 time to come.
 Nevertheless, there are grounds for optimism.  In con-
 trast to the Maoist era, the present leadership seems
 pragmatic and relatively unconstrained by orthodox
 ideology-in its policy choices.  And, perhaps most
 important of all, it has already demonstrated this yea'
 an ability to react quickly to adverse consequences of
 these policy choices.
 Economic Performance in 1976-79
 One of the milestones distinguishing the recent Na-
 tional. People's Congress from all others since the late
 1950s is the public disclosure of major speeches and a
 large body of economic and social statistics.  Although
 most of the data cover only the years 1977 and 1978,
 enough information was provided to show the performance
 of key economic sectors in 1976 as well.' Some data also
 were released on planned targets for 1979.
 A comparison of the new figures with CIA estimates
 S`:U,:s that our appraisal of recent economic trends in
 '??:,:.a has been close to the mark.  This is not surprising
 ,.uch as our estimates have been attempts .to reconstruct
 01_?cial data from piecemeal claims of percentage increases
 Approved For Release 2007/02/28 : CIA-RDP83B00551R000100060009-4
 and other fragmentary disclosures.  The new official data
 __.aryear internally consistent, and we expect to adopt
 nearly all of the figures as the best available.
 In interpreting the tabulation of selected official
 data presented here (see table), a word of caution is in
 order.  The use by Hua and others of 1976 as the base
 year for much of the data is logical because it marks
 the point where the present leadership came into power.
 It was a poor year economically, however, and thus con-
 stitutes a low base.  Moreover, much of the output in
 major basic industries is admittedly of poor quality;
 for example, nearly half of the 618 million tons of coal
 produced in 1978 probably came from small-scale mines
 whose output is of variable and generally low quality.
 Nevertheless, a number of economic trends stand out at
 once:
 -- Industrial output began a rapid recovery
 in 1977, whereas agricultural production
 continued to stagnate; in 1978, both had
 remarkably good years.
 -- Budget revenues and expenditures, which
 normally change at about the same rates
 as industrial production, rose much
 faster in 1978 than did industry.
 -- With the notable exception of domestic
 and foreign trade, plans for 1979 reflect
 a marked slowdown in rates of expansion.
 Reasons for the slowdown in 1979 are not hard to find.
 Last year was an especially good one for grain produc-
 tion--one that is unlikely to be repeated this year.  In
 industry, most of the capacity that stood idle in earlier
 years has been brought back into operation, so that
 double-digit growth in 1979 seems infeasible.  In addi-
 tion, many industries--most notably the iron and steel
 industry--have been ordered to concentrate on improving
 product quality and product mix rather than increasing
 c;:tput.   As for the budget, expenditures and revenues in
 are to level off, reflecting what China's Finance
 :lister has described as an extremely tight budget.
 will be cut into by a number of new incentive
 ies of:ecting tax flows, and expenditures are to be
 a          as part of a wide-ranging scaleback in
 projects.

 After the flood of statistics released for 1977-78,
 China's reporting on economic performance in the first
 half of 1979 looks curiously thin, apparently because
 prospects are mixed.  The country reportedly had a good
 winter wheat harvest, but it is too soon to gauge agri-
 cultural performance for the entire year.  Industrial
 production rose by only 4.1 percent as compared with the
 first half of 1978, meaning that second-half performance
 must be well above the 8 percent planned for-1979 as a
 whole.
 Current Problems and Policies
 The proceedings of the National People's Congress
 formalized policies of economic realignment and retrench-
 ment that have gradually come into force since the third
 plenum of the Chinese Communist Party in December 1978.
 The Chinese leadership now is clearly much more concerned
 with short-term economic problems than with ambitious
 long-term economic goals such as those embodied in the
 "draft outline" of the 10-year plan unveiled in March
 1978.  Thus, while Chairman Hua recently spoke of a
 three-year period of readjustment (1979-81), only the
 annual economic plan and planned budget for 1979 were
 presented for discussion at the NPC.
 Domestic economic policies are aimed at rectifying
 a number of longstanding problems that remain major ol;-
 stacles to eventual Chinese modernization.  These in-
 clude:
 -- The need for improved consumer welfare both
 to stimulate labor productivity and to en-
 sure that poor living conditions do not
 contribute to political instability.
 -- Amelioration of the currently high level
 of urban unemployment, particularly among
 youths who cannot now be absorbed in the
 schools and universities.
 -- Raising the low level of productivity of
 labor and capital that has prevailed for
 the past decade.
 -- Alleviation of the chronic shortages of
 raw materials, electric power, and trans-
 4
 portaticn ca,acty that constrain indus-
 trial performance.
 Approved For Release 2007/02/28 :. CIA-RDP83B00551 R000100060009-4
 -- Elimination of the waste of resources
 engendered by ill-conceived investment
 programs.
 Solutions to these problems are still evolving,
 mainly because of the present leadership's desire'to test
 new policies on a trial basis.  Nevertheless, these
 problems are being tackled by (a) introducing new incen-
 tive and institutional systems and (b) changing the pat-
 tern of resource allocation.  Under the former, agricul-
 tural procurement prices have been raised and the prices
 paid by peasants for industrial goods have been lowered.
 In addition, rural production teams have been given
 greater latitude to decide what crops will be grown and
 how much will be planted.  Similarly, new systems of
 improved worker and management incentives are being
 installed in industry, transportation, and other services.
 The systems have not been in effect long enough to judge
 their impact on production.
 The government is well aware of the impact these
 policies have on incomes and the demand for consumer
 goods.  Thus, it is attempting to ensure--through new
 investment and increased allocation of energy and raw
 and finished materials--that the supply of such goods
 from agriculture and light industry will more adequately
 meet the-new demand.  In addition, Beijing is experiment-
 ing with numerous new systems of industrial organization
 and management--for example, a contract system (to govern
 how and when goods are to be produced and delivered among
 supplying, producing, and marketing units) and the crea-
 tion of so-called "specialized corporations"--all of which
 are designed to increase efficiency and productivity.
 Progress in this area will remain slow because party, gov-
 ernment, and enterprise bureaucracies are resisting changes
 and individual cadres remain unsure of the permanence of
 the new policies.  Indeed, one of Beijing's major chal-
 lenges is that of motivating middle-level managers to
 act decisive.
 As for resource allocation, cutbacks have already
 Ien ordered in those parts of the construction program
 thit have been poorly designed or that will pay off only
 c.er the very long term.   Since December 1978 priority
 investment has been given to agriculture, light in-
 and textiles because of their importance to con-
 %"elfare and to the expansion of Chinese exports.

 decisions because these sectors constrain the operations
 ---of industry in general and because they support the
 scaled back, but still sizable, construction program-now
 under wav.
 Despite the revamping of economic strategy over the
 past several months, Chinese interest in foreign equip-
 ment, technology, and capital remains strong.  However, it
 is now more practically framed, reflecting the leadership's
 understanding that both the costs of acquisition and dif-
 ficulties in absorbing foreign technology are much greater
 than previously anticipated.
 Short-Term Prospects
 The policies developed at the third plenum in Decem-
 ber 1978 and now formally ratified by the NPC have been
 described by the Chinese as "preparing the ground" for
 eventual modernization.  They appear to be well designed,
 practical measures that probably will mitigate some of
 the problems noted above.
 Perhaps the most difficult problem for the govern-
 ment over the next three years will be that of handling
 rising consumer expectations.  Notwithstanding repeated
 insistence that consumer welfare can be improved only
 gradually and should be preceded by increased produc-
 tivity, the new policies are stimulating long-suppressed
 popular demand for more and better quality food, clothing,
 housing, and consumer durables.
 One indication of the strength of this demand is
 that, despite low interest rates over the past two dec-
 ades, urban and rural bank savings have steadily risen.
 The size of these deposits is unknown but they clearly
 are large enough to have become a serious concern for
 the government.   In March the government abandoned the
 old system of paying.a uniform annual interest rate for
 fixed deposits regardless of term and installed a system
 of six-month, and one-, three-, and five-year time
 deposits.  In addition to inhibiting the withdrawal of
 funds from these accounts, the new higher interest rates
 are also intended to attract more of the increased money
 income that is beginning to be received by the population.
 Vl'e suspect that the government will find this problem of
 it.chi:g supplies to consumer demand a continual one for
 the foreseeable future.

 Providing employment for youths of high school and
 college age who cannot be absorbed by the educational
 system is also likely to remain a difficult problem.'
 Although expansion of educational facilities has not
 been slighted under the new policies, resources are
 simply inadequate to provide space for several million
 junior and senior middle school graduates.  The current
 attempt to create new jobs in the services sector seems
 unlikely to satisfy the ambitions of this group.  We
 suspect that they will continue to be a problem for
 Beijing's leaders, primarily because they are a potential
 source of political dissent.
 Finally, the policies of realignment and retrench-
 ment may well extend beyond the three-year period now
 envisaged.  The number and scope of changes proposed under
 the new policies seem too great to be rapidly accomplished.
 The leadtimes required for adding new capacity in the
 energy and transportation sectors also make it unlikely
 that present bottlenecks will be removed by 1981.  Never-
 theless, we believe the odds favor the general success of
 new policies because they embody an unprecedently rational
 approach to China's economic problems.  As compared with
 that of the Maoist era, the present leadership appears to
 be much less bound by ideological constraints in its policy
 choices and more thorough in its consideration of new
 policies, and to have demonstrated its ability to react
 quickly to new problems created by the policies.

 China Sees Economic Problems Despite Plan Fulfillment
 China. while announcing that major 19.79 plans were fulfilled, has not concealed
 its concern over the serious problems that continue to hamper the economic
 readjustment scheduled for the period 1979-S1.F~
 China's Xinhua news agency last week reported that industrial output grew "over
 8 percent" in 1979, with heavy industry up 7.4 percent and light industry up 9
 percent. In keeping with readjustment policies, the plan had called for 8 percent in
 industry as a whole, down from the 13.5 percent achieved in 1978. Heavy industry
 was to rise by 7.6 percent and light industry by 8.3 percent, a marked change from
 longstanding patterns of the past. Through June, industrial growth was only 4.1
 percent and Beijing was exhorting producers-especially in the faltering light industry
 sector-to bear down. Subsequently, greater shares of industrial raw materials and
 energy were channeled to light industry; and military factories used excess capacity to
 turn atut consumer goods.
 Agricultural output responded positively to good weather and a series of policy
 changes, including substantially higher purchase prices. Beijing claims grain produc-
 tion reached 315 million tons, exceeding the 1979 target by 2.5 million tons and
 surpassing 1978 production by 10 million tons. Cotton production grew only slightly
 from the 1978 level of 2.2 million tons, falling short of the 2.4 million ton target. The
 goal of 4-percent growth in gross value of agricultural output may have been met,
 although no claim was made. F-1
 The sober tenor of the Xinhua release indicates that the leadership is not
 completely satisfied with economic performance in 1979. Profits remitted to the state
 probably did not reach planned levels, most likely resulting in a deficit in what was
 already a tight budget. Early in the year, Beijing realized that the correction of
 sectoral imbalances was proceeding more slowly than planned. Overextension of
 capital construction (which has been under attack since the beginning of 1979)
 persists, and light industry continues to suffer from inadequate supplies of raw
 materials and energy. At the same time, increases in urban wages and peasant
 incomes-while not dramatic-have raised expectations and have added to the
 demand for consumer goods. Given the difficulties in reshaping economic strategy, the
 leadership has indicated it may stretch out the readjustment period at least one year,
 through 1982.
