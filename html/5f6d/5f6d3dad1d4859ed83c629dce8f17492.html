 DISAFFECTION AMONG YOUTH IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 There is mounting evidence that disaffection
 among youth in Communist China has become a wide-
 spread and serious problem.  The lack of good
 study and job opportunities, the discrepancy be-
 tween the ideals expressed by the regime and pres-
 ent                                    realities, and the prospect of a bleak fu-
 ture have alienated many of the regime's staunch
 supporters.   Efforts to send young people to the
 already crowded countryside or to remote frontier
 areas are extremely unpopular and have had only
 limited success.   Alarmed by youths' flagging
 zeal for communist ideals, Peiping is conducting
 the most intensive youth indoctrination campaign
 noted in years.  The campaign, with its stark
 demand that youth in particular must prepare for
 a long period of struggle and sacrifice, has had
 little visible success, however, in rekindling
 enthusiasm for the Chinese brand of communism.

 Causes of Discontent
 The lack of educational
 and vocational opportunities is
 the basic cause for discontent
 Premier
 Chou En-lai repor e  y said that
 only a small number of this
 year's junior and senior high
 school graduates would be able
 to continue their studies at the
 senior       school or university
 on y
 20 percent of those taking
 university qualification tests
 this summer were accepted.  This
 is an unprecedented reversal of
 the pre-1961 policy that per-
 mitted almost all high school
 graduates to continue their
 education.
 This fall, for the third
 consecutive year, fewer new
 students were accepted by uni-
 versities than were graduated
 in June.   As a result, total
 enrollment has fallen steadily
 from a peak of 900,000 in the
 1960-1961 academic year to
 about 650,000 at present (see
 chart).
 The cutback in educational
 opportunities has increased com-
 petition for available jobs.
 Unemployment is already high,
 and China's stagnant economy
 is unable to absorb the large
 number of young people thrust
 into the labor force annually.
 Periodic recruitment drives to
 persuade urban youth to go to
 rural and frontier areas have
 met with only limited success.
 Of the 15 to 20 million city
 youth between the ages of 16
 and 25, few seem to have been

 convinced by propaganda allega-
 tions that there is a great
 need for "cultured peasants,"
 and it appears that only about
 100 000 urban youth were re-
 cruited for rural areas, most-
 ly for service at  state
 farms, from mid-1962 to mid-
 1963.

 July 1.963 to resettle unemployed

 new drive strongly suggests
 that the regime is removing
 idle youth to Sinkiang not only
 to reduce a source of social
 unrest in cities but also to
 increase ethnic Chinese in-
 fluence in an area near the
 Soviet border where minority
 nationalities have been rebell-

 assignments.   These unemployed
 young people have become a se-
 rious social problem in Shanghai
 and Canton and probably in
 other large cities as well.
 The term "social youth" has
 been coined since 1961 to
 describe urban idlers, many of
 whom have turned to thievery
 and black-marketeering.
 Probably the most disillu-
 sioned and disgruntled group
 is the current graduating class
 of 200,000 university students.
 They had been led to believe
 they were to play a vital role
 in building a strong China, but
 few are being assigned to posts
 of responsibility or to posts
 where they can make full use
 of their skills.  These gradu-
 ates were frankly told last
 summer that, because of "re-
 adjustments" in the economy,
 not enought job openings existed
 in the specialties for which
 students had been enrolled in
 1958-59.   Students who could
 not be immediately placed in
 appropriate jobs--apparently

 indoctrination, and dislike the
 requirement that a month of the
 school year be devoted to manual

 now is spent in class work than
 during the "leap forward" era
 of 1958-1960, when students
 often spent entire semesters do-
 ing farm or construction work,
 but extracurricular demands are
 still heavy.   Occasionally the

 only two months were spent on
 genuine class work in the
 past year, the remaining time
 having been spent in political
 meetings or in rural clinics.
 A fortunate few have been
 able to escape the harsh condi-
 tions in China by leaving for
 Hong Kong.  Nearly 15,000 stu-
 dents, most of whom had rel.a-
 Lives in Hong Kong, left the
 mainland in 1962 for visits
 and almost none went back.
 The exodus has continued in
 1963, although on a somewhat
 smaller scale because of
 stricter controls in granting
 exit permits.
 Although little evidence
 is available on rural attitudes,
 disgruntled young peasants have
 beem fleeing to Macao and Hong
 ;Kong in fairly substantial num-
 lbers in the past two years.
 Since 1961, regime policies
 have kept peasants firmly
 tied to their collective farm,,
 eliminating outlets open to
 those who wanted to improve
 their lot.  Through 1960,
 some were conscripted into the
 army every year, some were able
 to continue their education by
 entering high schools in near.-
 by towns, and many, during pe-
 riods of rapid industrializa-
 tion, migrated to the cities
 where they found jobs.
 All this has changed.  The
 army has shifted conscription
 activities to the cities, where
 a more literate class of re-
 cruits is available.   High
 :schools, which have been
 reducing enrollments and raising
 standards, now accept few farm
 students.  And not only are
 jobs in the city scarce, but
 strict population controls
 have also been instituted to
 prevent aimless migration of
 country boys in search of a
 better livelihood.
 Ideological Concern
 The aging Chinese Commu-
 nist leadership has seemed in-
 creasingly worried in the past
 year that its fundamentalist
 brand of communism will not
 survive in the next generation.
 This concern was reflected in
 the 1 July issue of China Youth:
 "The enemy at home and
 abroad always wants to
 exploit the weakness of
 young people.   On his
 death bed, Dulles, the
 notorious former Secre-
 tary of State of the US,
 still emphasized the need
 of corroding 'the third
 generation'   of, the
 socialist countries with
 'the Western civilization
 and way of life' so as to
 bring about their degenera-
 tion.   In real life, there
 do not lack instances
 where young people, cor-
 roded by bourgeois thought,
 have indeed degenerated."
 What Peiping sees as back-
 sliding :in the USSR is regarded
 as proof that even an old estab-
 lished communist society can
 be corrupted.   Determined not
 to let this happen in China,
 Peiping last spring ordered

 SE CRET
 the most intensive indoctrina--
 ttion campaign noted in years,
 to try to stem ideological
 backsliding and to instill in
 young people a more zealous
 determination to be good "heirs
 to communism."
 Peiping is convinced that
 one reason today's youth fails
 to appreciate socialism more
 fully is that it does not
 know how bad conditions used to
 be.   Therefore, older people
 all over China have been urged
 to recall how the "reactionary
 ruling class" had once "brutally
 oppressed" them, and to repeat
 these atrocity stories to their
 children.
 The regime has been employ-
 ing all possible forms of com-,
 munication--newspapers, movies,
 songfests, plays, and "study
 sessions"--to get its ideologi-
 cal message across.   Major re-,
 sponsibility for seeing that
 indoctrination is effective
 and thorough has been given to
 the Young Communist League, a
 mass organization that has
 been unusually active in 1963.
 Nearly every province has held
 a. League Congress this year
 and preparations are under way
 for a nationwide  League Con-
 gress, which would provide
 another forum for publicizing
 the themes of the youth cam-
 paign.
 Using highly repetitious
 and jargonized propaganda, the
 campaign has stressed the need
 for youth to learn about the
 miseries of precommunist
 society, love Mao Tse-tung and
 study his writings, carry out a
 "class struggle;" resist "bour-
 geois" and "revisionist" in-
 fluences, prepare for a long
 period of hardship, strive to be
 "red" as well as "expert," and
 emulate a folk-hero named Lei
 Feng.
 One of the most prominent
 elements in the campaign has
 been this glorification of the
 "ordinary soldier Lei Feng."
 All youths are told to learn from
 and emulate him, although pre-
 cisely how they should go about
 emulating him is unclear.   Lei
 Feng, who died in an accident
 on 15 August 1962, does not
 resemble Aleksei Stakhanov, the
 Soviet coal miner of the 1930s
 who was eulogized for overful-
 filling production targets.   The
 Chinese propaganda emphasizes
 that Lei Feng did not create or
 produce anything important, but
 that he is honored solely for his
 abstract ideological virtues.
 This sanctimonious figure spent
 his evenings studying Mao's
 writings and his days off self-
 lessly performing services for
 others, such as washing the
 clothes of the men in his unit
 and scrubbing the floor of a
 railroad car before settling
 down for a journey.   "Some peo-
 ple call me an idiot," Lei Feng
 wrote in his highly publicized
 diary, because "I want to do
 good deeds for the state and
 people....   The revolution needs
 idiots like me.'"
 Peiping admits that Lei
 Feng was aided in achieving
 his state of purity by a sterling
 family background that not every

 youth could match.   His father
 was buried alive by the Japanese.
 His mother was raped by a land-
 lord and later committed sui-
 cide.   He himself was stabbed
 by a landlord at the age of
 seven.   His brother died fight-
 ing in the People*s Liberation
 Army.
 The Lei Feng movement of-
 fers an easy target for Soviet
 propagandists trying to ridicule
 the Chinese road to communism.
 Komsomolskaya Pravda on 15 Sep-
 tember sneered at Lei Feng for
 declaring that the height of
 happiness is to be a "rust-
 free cog of Chairman Mao Tse-
 tung."  "How alien and dis-
 gusting this philosophy is,"
 said the Soviet paper.   It went
 on to repeat some of the more
 absurd stories told of Lei Feng,
 such as an incident in which
 he found an old toothbrush in
 a heap of refuse, trimmed it,
 and "it became like new in his
 hands."
 Peiping has made no effort
 to hide from youth the fact
 that the future is bleak.   In-
 deed, a major propaganda ob-
 jective has been to persuade
 young people to reconcile
 themselves to a Lei Feng - like
 existence in which they will
 do routine, uninteresting work
 and practice an extreme form
 of frugality.  The propaganda
 repeatedly warns that building
 communism will entail great
 hardships for many decades.
 Those who hope for a peaceful
 and settled life are told they
 must "overcome this unsound
 state of mind."
 All indications are that
 the intensive indoctrination
 efforts of recent months have
 failed to have much impact on the
 125 million Chinese between the
 ages of 16 and 25.   By and large,
 young people seem to have become
 immune to ideological appeals
 unaccompanied by material signs
 of progress.   The few successes
 of the past year--the victory
 over the Indians on the Tibetan
 border and the slight improve-
 ment in food supplies--apparently
 have done little to overcome the
 apathy, disillusionment, and
 pessimism which have characterized
 Chinese youth since the collapse
 of the "leap forward" in 1960.

 Peiping itself increasingly
 recognizes that many youths
 have little enthusiasm for com-
 munism.                           in the past year the
 party has repeatedly railed
 against young intellectuals,
 workers, and peasants who have
 either been corrupted by "bour-
 geois" thinking or who showed,
 during a period of relaxation
 in 1962, a willingness to "take
 the capitalist road" at every
 opportunity.   The propaganda
 has also complained that some
 youths see little point in
 talking about the misery of
 the past or about "class strug-
 gle" now that everything has
 been socialized and that others
 say they have already learned
 enough from Lei Feng and are
 tired of studying his example.
 The Lei Feng movement in
 particular actually appears to
 have been counterproductive

 ent to the
 Shanghai Gasworks to stage a
 play about the life of Lei Feng.
 Workers were assembled, the
 lights went down,  and the play
 began.   When the lights went
 on again, the hall was empty,
 the audience in sheer boredom
 having crept out and gone home.
 ou  e  t at Lei Feng
 ua  y existed.   He believed
 that most intellectuals, also
 skeptical of Lei Feng's exist-
 ence, were therefore unmoved
 by exhortations to emulate Lei
 Feng's spirit of obedience to
 the party.
 The degree of youth disaf-
 fection varies among groups.
 There is still a small minority
 that believes it is doing some-
 thing important and is there-
 fore fairly well motivated.
 This includes the 2 million
 conscripts in the army, who are
 generally treated as an elite
 group; the 100,000-odd new
 students accepted by universities
 this fall after careful political
 screening; the relatively few

 young teenagers also seem to be

 nationalistic themes have far
 more appeal than ideological
 themes to young people.   It is
 possible for the regime to whip
 up considerable support for its
 challenge to the USSR and its
 actions on the Indian-Tibetan
 border.   On domestic ideological
 matters, however, the regime is
 no longer able to elicit blindly
 enthusiastic support.

 On the other hand, apathy
 and resignation among the young,
 while affecting the amount of
 support being given to regime
 programs, have not yet reached
 a point where they constitute
 a serious security threat.
 Nevertheless, isolated examples

 Young idlers

 The Outlook
 So long as it is unwilling
 to compromise its harsh commu-
 nist ideals, the regime has few
 alternative approaches to youth
 SECRET
 problems.   It is convinced by
 the problems created during
 the last period of relaxation
 in 1961 and early 1962 that
 young people will take advantage
 of freedom to turn to a more
 individualistic, if not capital-
 istic, way of life.
 The indoctrination campaigns
 therefore probably will be con-
 tinued in spite of their evident
 ineffectiveness.  They may be
 modified to offer more appeal
 to groups, like scientific
 students, whose support is
 essential to Peiping, but the
 regime is probably prepared to
 keep the rest in line by rein-
 forcing its exhortations with
 increasingly coercive measures.
 There is as yet little
 reason to doubt the regime's
 ability to control young people.
 There is also little doubt that
 disaffection will decline only
 when young people come to feel
 that they are again playing an
 important role in making China
 a                         country
