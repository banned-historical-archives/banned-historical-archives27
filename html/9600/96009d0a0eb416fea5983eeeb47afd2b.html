FOREWORD 
The purpose of this report is to describe the development of the 
Chinese Communist communes in their first year of existence and to 
analyze their economic effects. Because the communes themselves are 
in a period of consolidation and redefinition of function, some of 
the material is speculative. The final form of the commune has not 
yet taken Shape', and we can count on the Chinese leaders to be creative 
and flexible in adjusting their policies pragmatically to meet changing 
economic conditions. Where appropriate, data are qualified or labeled 
as tentative, and alternative explanations are advanced for features of 
the communes that are either unclear or unsettled. This report de-
scribes, in turn, the genesis of the swift campaign that brought about 
the establishment of communes (II, below), the organization and methods 
of operation of the communes (III, below), and the probable economic 
effects of the communes (IV, below) and considers the current problems 
and future course of this revolutionary Chinese Communist institution 
(V, below).

ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF COMMUNIST CHINA'S COMMUNES* 
Summary and Conclusions 
Communes -- the new monolithic political-economic-social units of 
Communist China that are consolidating all previous controls at the 
local level under one tightly knit semimilitary authority and are 
rapidly remolding the way of life of 660 million people -- were intro-
duced in mid-1958 in response to the great problems in the organization 
and control of the economy which had resulted from the rapid but uneven 
increases in production of the "leap forward" program. So swift was 
the development of the new commune system that by early November the 
regime could claim that 99 percent of the rural population had been 
organized into 26,500 communes averaging about 4,750 households each. 
This amazingly rapid growth is explained partly by the energy put into 
the commune program by a hard-driving leadership, partly by the fact 
that many of the new communes were coextensive with existing hsiang 
(townships) the governmental apparatus of which was readily appropriated, 
and partly by the fact that the majority of communes were set up hastily, 
with details of organization and operation being left for the future. 
The communes in mid-1959 range from a few fully developed model 
communes in which the future life of the whole rural population is 
probably foreshadowed to organizations that exist merely on paper and 
in which previous modes of living under the old agricultural producer 
cooperatives (APC's) have not yet been disturbed. Most communes lie 
in between, not in a stable state but moving rapidly toward the ideal 
commune. Speakers at the National Peoples Congress in April 1959 spoke 
of the necessity of a rather prolonged period of "tidying up" the 
existing rural communes, and, accordingly, the extension of the system 
to urban areas will probably be postponed for some months. But it ap-
pears inevitable that urban areas will ultimately be subjected to the 
same program, although the leadership will encounter much more formida-
ble political and economic problems in establishing communes in urban 
areas than in imposing the system on the countryside. 
The essence of the commune is that there is brought together in a 
single center of authority almost all power over the economic, political, 
and social life of several thousand rural households. This power is 
being used to (1) consolidate the control of the central leadership over

the planning and managing of local economic activity, at the same time 
delegating decision-making in day-to-day operations to the commune; 
(2) mobilize the vast manpower resources of rural Communist China and 
maintain -- by means of an almost incredible intensification of the 
pace of work -- the "leap forward" program in agriculture, industry, 
and construction; (3) maximize the margin between total output and 
consumption in the rural areas by allowing consumption to increase 
only to the extent required to obtain a reasonably well-nourished and 
contented labor force; (4) eliminate the vestiges of private enterprise 
and private control over consumption and greatly reduce the ability of 
people to survive in the interstices of the society; and (5) destroy 
traditional family life and replace it with a communal life -- communal 
messhalls, dormitories, nurseries, tailor shops, and the like -- that 
could have been taken directly from George Orwell's 1984. 
Chinese Communist propagandists at first claimed that the communes 
were an important shortcut to Communism. They publicized as one of the 
goals the distribution of income according to need rather than produc-
tive ability and strongly implied that they were in the vanguard of the 
march to the brave new world, ahead of their doctrinally softer com-
rades of the Sino-Soviet Bloc. This challenge to Soviet ideological 
leadership appeared for a short time to be a threat to the unity of the 
Bloc, but a bland restatement and cutting down of claims by the Chinese 
Communist leaders restored harmony, at least on the surface. In addi-
tion to their retreat on the ideological front, the Chinese Communist 
leaders also have retreated somewhat in their efforts to change greatly 
the traditional mode of family life and to eliminate immediately the 
remaining fragments of private property, but it is believed that the 
concessions are temporary and designed to meet the short-run problem 
of how best to maintain the intensive pace of the "leap forward" pro-
gram through 1959. 
The long-run economic significance of the communes lies in their 
role in speeding up the industrialization of Communist China. With 
small regard for human costs, the leaders of China have plunged ahead 
on a revolutionary course from which there is no easy turning back, 
and, so far, they are succeeding in their scheme to drive the Chinese 
people ahead at a frenetic, yet increasingly disciplined and coordi-
nated, pace. 
With respect to the allocation of economic resources, the communes, 
because of the greater breadth of their control, have proved to be a 
potent force for either better or poorer use of resources. At first 
the communes appeared to aggravate, rather than solve, the problems 
of allocating resources raised by the "leap forward" program -- for 
example, thousands of rural people were mobilized for industrial or 
construction tasks while rice stood unharvested in the field. For the

long run the communes appear to be a very effective mechanism for im-
plementing the economic plans and policies of the regime. Whether or 
not the results will represent a rational use of resources will depend 
mainly on (1) the soundness of the plan directives imposed on the 
communes from above and (2) the extent to which the top leadership 
feels constrained to use an all-out mobilization psychology to.stimu-
late lagging enthusiasm even at a considerable cost in efficiency. 
I. Introduction 
In the summer of 1958 the attention of both the Communist and the 
non-Communist worlds was captured by the announcement by Communist 
China of a tremendous drive to organize a new form of totalitarian 
institution -- the "peoples commune." By early November 1958 the re-
gime could claim that virtually all of the overwhelmingly rural popu-
lation of China lived in communes of one form or another. Conclusions 
as to the meaning of this drastic recasting of Chinese society were 
varied and, in some cases, extreme, partly because the concurrent 
crisis in the Taiwan Straits was used by Communists as, a goad in the. 
organization drive for communes. The dramatic aspect of the situation 
was increased by the fact that the commune movement appears to have 
little or no precedent in the history of the evolution of the USSR. 
The Chinese Communists could legitimately claim to have made a substan-
tial contribution to the "science" of Marxism-Leninism. Isolated state-
ments made in the first flush of enthusiasm, however, left the implica-
tion that this new contribution, in contrast to the Soviet experience, 
was an alternative and shorter road to the attainment of Communism. By 
the end of 1958, however, such statements, which reflected unfavorably 
on the role of the USSR as the leader of the "Socialist, camp," were 
carefully refuted by the regime. 
Another aspect of.the impact of the commune movement was the real 
or apparent association of the new institution with the remarkable 
economic growth which took place in Communist China in 1958. The pre-
sent and future operations of the communes will be closely observed by 
those underdeveloped nations of Southeast Asia and Africa in which 
problems of maximizing economic growth on primarily agricultural bases 
are similar to those prevailing in China. The degree of success ob-
tained by the Chinese Communists in changing China from a backward, 
agricultural country into a modern, industrialized state through the 
instrument of communes may well determine whether other underdeveloped 
countries will elect to continue to approach the problems of economic 
development within a democratic frame of reference or will choose to 
follow the totalitarian alternative exemplified by Communist China.

The Chinese Communist communes consolidate all elements of politi-
cal, economic, and social life at local levels under total state 
authority. Communes were established initially with the objective of 
maintaining the momentum of the "leap forward" program, which had run 
into organizational difficulties in the countryside and which needed 
a shot-in-the-arm. Although communes remain primarily a rural phenome-
non, the regime continues to experiment with the extension of the 
communal form to the urban population. The semimilitary organization, 
which is a distinguishing feature of communes, not only facilitates 
mobilization of manpower for the tasks of production and aids in con-
trolling consumption but also affects such highly individual activi-
ties as leisure and rest and appears to have gravely weakened the 
family as the basic unit of Chinese society. 
II. Establishment of Communes  
A. Predecessors of the Communes  
The greatly stepped up tempo of production and construction in 
Communist China under the great "leap forward" of 1958 brought with it 
serious problems in the organization, coordination, and control of 
economic activity, especially in the countryside, where the ability of 
Peking to direct economic affairs had always been weakest. In an at-
tempt to determine the best organizational forms for combining rural 
agriculture and industry as well as for bringing financial, commercial, 
and administrative activities into harmony with the expanded activities 
in agriculture and industry, experiments with different forms of or-
ganization were being carried on in early 1958 just before the formal 
establishment of communes. One major type of reorganization was the 
amalgamation of several mall APC's into one large APC. This amalgama-
tion was often synchronized with the merging of hsiang, as in Liaoning 
Province in May 1958. 1/* The other form of experimental reorganization 
was the merging of a credit and a supply and marketing cooperative with 
one or more APC's in the same area to form what might be considered an 
incipient form of commune. In addition to these mergers of cooperatives, 
public services -- messhalls, nurseries, and other facilities -- were 
set up in some rural areas to free more people, especially women, for 
full-time work in agriculture and industry. 
B. Genesis of the Idea of Communes 
Even though communes now appear to be a quite logical develop-
ment in the light of economic developments during the past few years, 
there is no tangible evidence to indicate that communes were planned

Their emergence in mid-1958 took place, according to 'Van Chen-lin -- at 
this time the most prominent spokesman on agricultural problems -- "pre-
cisely because the development of China's productive forces at the 
present stage demanded a change in the relations of production." 2/ 
More specifically it has been claimed that APC's were unable to accu-
mulate sufficient capital to finance the large capital construction 
projects planned for 1958. The labor force of APC's also lacked the 
degree of mobilization and flexibility required to carry out large-
scale projects and agricultural tasks as well as to operate the small-
scale industrial installations which APC's and local governments were 
beginning to finance and construct in growing numbers. 
Illustrating the suddenness of the actual launching of the 
commune movement was the absence of any published reference to com-
munes -- let alone a preparatory publicity campaign -- until the 
publication of the 1 July 1958 issue of the leading theoretical jour-
nal, Hung Ch'i (Red Flag).* 1/ In an article describing an outstand-
ing agricultural cooperative in Hupeh Province, Ch'en Po-ta, the 
journal's editor and the personal mouthpiece of Mao Tse-tung, wrote 
that "a cooperative which is changed into a fundamental organizational 
unit which includes both agricultural cooperation and industrial co-
operation, in reality, is a peoples commune which combines both in-
dustry and agriculture." 
In the following issue of 16 July, Ch'en Po-ta quoted Mao as 
having said that the general direction should be gradually to "or-
ganize industry, agriculture, commerce and trade, culture and educa-
tion, and the militia ... into a large commune."12/ Although it is 
not certain when Mao made this statement about communes, it is be-
lieved to have been in May 1958 at the Second Session of the Eighth 
Party Congress or earlier and is the earliest evidence of identifica-
tion of top leadership with the commune movement. 
C. Growing Awareness and Acceptance of Communes  
After July 1958, other Party leaders began to make reference 
to communes, their approval becoming more and more enthusiastic as 
the movement gained momentum. T'an Chen-lin, for example, pointed 
out the "inadequacies in the original size, management, and distri-
bution systems for agricultural cooperatives" which had led to the 
establishment in certain areas of "a kind of comparatively high-level 
communal form." 2/ A short time later T'an quoted Mao as having called 
for the organization of "large communes as the basic units of our so-
ciety." Liu Shao-ch'i referred favorably to the new institution in

the 30 July 1958 issue of Jen-min Jih-pao (Peoples Daily), describing 
them in great detail although not using the term "commune." 1/ 
The commune movement, off to a slow and uncertain beginning 
in the early summer of 1958, received its first major stimulus from 
the well-publicized, tour of Mao in August. Mao toured Honan, Shantung, 
and Hopeh, visiting communes and commenting favorably on them. The 
real commitment to the commune -- from which there could be no turning 
back -- came, however, with the Politburo meeting held in the latter 
part of August 1958 in Pei-tai-ho, Hopeh, to coordinate and standardize 
the now fast developing commune movement. On 29 August the famous 
"Resolution of the Central Committee, CCP, on the Establishment of 
Peoples Communes in the Rural Areas" was adopted, describing the 
developing commune movement; the size, organizational structure, and 
operation of the ideal commune; the method of establishment; and the 
significance of communes in the ideological framework of current so-
cialism and future Communism. Following wide dissemination of the 
resolution in early September, a "high tide" developed, and by the end 
of September more than 26,000 communes had been set up, embracing 
122 million households -- about 98 percent of all peasant households. 
Spearheading the commune movement was the highly publicized 
Wei-hsing (Sputnik) Model Commune. Wei-hsing, claimed as the first 
commune in Communist China, was reportedly set up in April 1958 
through the merger of 27 APC's, which together embraced 9,369 peasant 
households. This amalgamated cooperative -- later called a commune --
is located in Sui-p'ing Hsien, in Honan. During the early days of 
communalization, every aspect of Wei-hsing's organization and operation 
was given the widest publicity, and there was a flurry of sweeping 
generalizations based on the typical conditions of one or two show-
piece communes. The majority of communes were only "paper communes" 
at first. In fact, these communes were not expected to be more than 
that, according to the August resolution, which stated: "In the first 
period of the merger, the method may be adopted of 'changing the upper 
structure, while keeping the lower structure unchanged' ... to make 
sure of avoiding any adverse effect on production." 21/ 
D. Beachhead in the Urban Areas' 
The apparent quick success of the commune movement in the 
countryside created enthusiasm in some official quarters for the 
development of urban communes. Mao wanted an extension of the com-
munalization process into urban areas "as a necessary step in the 
drive towards total state ownership." 12/ Whole cities (perhaps with 
a substantial piece of the surrounding countryside) or parts of cities 
were to become communes. In October the Secretary General of the 
Secretariat of the Party's Central Committee, Vice-Premier Teng 
Hsiao-p'ing, lent his weight in calling for further establishment of

urban communes on an experimental basis. Before long, however, re-
ports of disenchantment came from the cities. It became quickly 
evident that communalization of the urban areas would be decidedly 
more difficult than that of the countryside, and an official halt 
was therefore called in the Party resolution of 10 December 1958. 
Although the resolution called for future large-scale estab-
lishment of urban communes "only after rich experience has been gained," 
it was not long before urban communalization was again actively under-
taken, at least in certain areas. With little or no publicity, the 
communalization of 97 percent of the total urban population of Honan 
Province was accomplished by mid-January 1959. 11/ Honan is not very 
highly urbanized and is only an experimental area. Generalizations 
based on its experience might be amiss, but the regime appears to be 
ideologically committed to urban communes. Their development could 
begin in earnest at a future time when the problems in the organiza-
tion and operation of rural communes have been brought under control. 
E. Period of "Tidying Up" 
Communalization of the Chinese countryside was basically com-
pleted by mid-October 1958. A few provinces moved slowly at first --
Yunnan, for example -- but progress generally was quite impressive. 
Because communes were organized in such a hurry, a consolidation cam-
paign was started in December 1958 and is continuing as of June 1959. 
In Honan the Party felt that educating the peasants on socialism and 
Communism was the "primary step for improving and consolidating 
peoples communes." In Kiangsu, it was believed that "higher produc-
tion is the key to consolidation of peoples communes." 
Whatever the emphasis, large inspection teams were sent out 
to investigate commune management and operation throughout the country. 
Cadres were "sent down" to communes from urban areas to aid in strength-
ening commune operation. The cadres were expected to gain a better 
understanding of commune problems, and their experience -- although 
this aspect has not been mentioned in Chinese Communist publications --
could prove useful in the event of a concentrated effort to communalize 
urban areas in Communist China. 
At the National Peoples Congress in April 1959, the rapid pace 
with which communes had been established in rural areas was highly 
praised, but the necessity for a continued "tidying up" of the system 
was admitted. Elements in the "tidying up" are as follows: (1) the 
transformation of communes that are mostly on paper to full-fledged 
communes, including the integration of financial and commercial ac-
tivities with production activities (the degree to which each activity 
is brought under control varies with the activity -- for instance, the

formation of standardized statistical and planning departments has 
still not been carried out in many communes); (2) the consolidation 
of central control over the functioning of the communes (an example 
in point is the development of a system of contracts among communes 
that will permit a more smoothly functioning specialization of pro-
duction); (3) the growing insistence on establishing goals in agri-
culture that have a reasonable chance of being fulfilled; (4) the 
reduction of wasteful expenditures of manpower and raw materials and 
the concentration upon achieving efficiency (in an effort to avoid 
spoilage of crops and other wastes in agriculture resulting from 
allocation of a large proportion of the rural labor force to non-
agricultural production, 80 percent of the manpower in rural areas 
is now supposed to be concentrated on agricultural pursuits); and 
(5) the partial retreat from the extreme measures taken to break up 
the prevailing structure of the family (this retreat probably repre-
sents a "one-step-backward, two-steps-forward" program and serves the 
present purpose of conciliating the rural population, whose coopera-
tion is needed to maintain the momentum of the "leap forward" through 
1959). 
III. Organization and Operation of Communes 
A. General Structure  
1. Size 
Whereas many of the preceding APC's had as few as 150 
households, the average commune had 4,000 or 5,000 households when 
first established. Communes vary greatly in size, however, from 
province to province and within any given province. At the end of 
September 1958, for example, the communes in Kwangtung averaged 
9,845 households each, whereas those in Kweichow embraced only 
1,413 households. 12/ The average size of communes in the remaining 
provinces lay between these two extremes. 
The great majority of communes were first established on 
a hsiang (township) framework. The Party resolution of August 1958 
stressed the unity of hsiang and communes. The resolution recommended 
the merging of several hsiang where appropriate in sparsely populated 
areas and the formation of communes on this enlarged base. The ad-
vantages of the "one hsiang - one commune" arrangement were that the 
administrative structure and personnel of the political unit (hsiang) 
could be transferred intact to the new communes, thereby reducing 
disruption of economic activity during the height of the crop season. 
The August directive also stated, however, that federations of communes 
throughout the hsien (county) on a hsien-wide basis would be the pre-
ferred structure as the movement progressed. In September, Li Hsien-nien

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
called for the establishment of these hsien federations, to be followed 
ultimately by complete amalgamation into larger hsien-wide communes --
"one hsien - one commune" -- after basic financial and economic problems 
of the member communes had been worked out. 13/ 
Because the eventual form which rural communes are expected 
to assume is based on the single hsien, and because there are now 
probably fewer than 2,000 hsien, a considerable degree of amalgamation 
of the 26,500 communes must eventually take place. Although there has 
been no announced decrease in the national total of communes, recent 
reports from several provinces indicate that the amalgamation has al-
ready begun. 
At present, then, there are three different patterns of 
organization of the communes. The great majority are -- or at least 
started out -- on a hsiang-wide basis. The second pattern is a tran-
sitional stage, namely, the organization of these hsiang-wide communes 
into federations which loosely tie together all communes in a hsien 
area. The third pattern is believed to be the pattern of the future, 
the hsien-wide commune. In December 1958 it was reported that in Honan 
Province -- which is in the forefront of the commune movement -- there 
were 6 hsien-wide communes, 95 hsien-wide federations of communes, and 
1,242 individual communes with an average of 8,000 households each. 14/ 
2. Membership  
Citizens 16 years of age and older are allowed to become 
full members of communes, and noncitizens such as former landlords and 
rich peasants are allowed to become "unofficial members" until such 
time as their political rights are restored.* The right to vote and 
to participate in the supervision of commune affairs is restricted to 
commune members, but unofficial members "may enjoy the same economic 
treatment as full members." Both full members and unofficial members 
are enjoined to carry out commune resolutions, observe labor discipline, 
and protect public property. 
Upon establishment of communes, APC's have been required 
to transfer their collectively owned property to communes. The shares 
held by former cooperative members no longer bear interest. Except 
for a "small number of domestic animals and fowl," members are re-
quired to turn over such privately owned property as land holdings, 
large farm tools, and livestock. Livestock and holdings of trees, how-
ever, have been considered as investments in the new commune for which 
* Much of the information in this report about the organization struc-
ture of communes is based on the draft of the regulations governing 
the model Wei-hsing (Sputnik) commune. 15/

compensation is to be paid. Much unfavorable criticism of the loss of 
private property -- as well as examples of decreases in output attribu-
table to neglect of property under communal control -- appears recently 
to have brought about a more lenient attitude in regard to private 
property. The most important recent concession to private initiative 
is the granting of permission for individual raising of hogs. Up to 
5 percent of the commune's acreage, but no more than 0.2 mou* per hog, 
may be assigned to support individual hog-raising. If there is con-
tinued failure in the collective raising of meat animals and in the 
collective growing of vegetables and other subsidiary foods, there 
may be further relaxation of private property privileges. In general, 
however, the long-run trend during a decade of Communist control over 
the mainland has been a squeezing out of elements of private ownership, 
and any respite given private property under the communes should be 
regarded as a temporary tactical retreat (except perhaps in certain 
limited areas of economic activity, like the raising of livestock, 
where collective ownership has repeatedly failed). 
3. Top Administrative Layer 
The top layer of the administrative apparatus of a coMmune 
consists of the chairman of the commune, a congress of the commune 
elected by commune members for a 2-year term, and an administrative 
committee elected by the congress. The congress, which includes repre-
sentatives of all sections of the people -- women, youth, old people, 
cultural and educational workers, medical workers, scientific and 
technical workers, managers, agricultural and industrial workers, and 
minority people -- is nominally the locus of highest authority in the 
commune, outside the local Party apparatus. From analogy with similar 
organizations within the nations of the Soviet Bloc, it is believed, 
however, that the congress actually has no power at all. Its members 
are in effect designated from above rather than elected from below; 
they have their own daily jobs and problems and assemble only once or 
twice a year; and their role is presumably limited to applauding the 
top functionaries and voting "aye" after perfunctory discussion of the 
proposals thrust on them from above. 
The chairman of the commune is considerably more inde-
pendent. He is responsible for the over-all direction of the commune 
and appoints the heads of the staff departments and production bri-
gades under which the commune operates. He heads the standing com-
mittee of the administrative committee of the congress. Although the 
announcements about communes often refer to the powers and responsi-
bilities of the "commune committee," it is believed on the basis of 
fragmentary information about the activities of the chairman that his

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
power is closer to that prevailing under "one-man rule" rather than 
that prevailing under a "first among equals" relationship. 
Attached to the top layer are staff departments, each 
covering an important area of the commune's activity -- such as 
agriculture, industry, commerce, finance, credit, communal services, 
planning and statistics, and militia. Although the organization of 
communes is not yet thorou&ly shaken down, it is believed that these 
departments will not ordinarily function as line operating departments 
but will confine themselves to the technical direction of their repre-
sentatives in the production brigades and production teams. Included 
under technical direction would be the promulgation of standard oper-
ating procedures, the introduction of technological change, and the 
support of emulation campaigns and other "leap forward!' techniques. 
4. Lower Layers  
Below the top administrative level is the production bri-
gade, and below the production brigade is the production team.* The 
size of the brigades and teams depends on the region in which the com-
mune is located, the density of population, the degree to which the 
commune program has been pushed, and other local factors. As to a 
general idea of the size of brigades: in Kiangsu the production 
brigades at present are to have approximately 500 households and the 
teams 50 households; and in March 1959, in Chen-lai Hsien in northern 
Kirin, there were 8 communes, 35 production brigades, 361 production 
teams, and 29,309 households. lg 
The primary task of the production brigade is agricultural 
production, but the production brigade is also charged with the man-
agement of industry, commerce, education, and all other economic and 
welfare activities within its jurisdictional area. In some regions 
the principal task of a brigade could be forestry, or the raising of 
livestock, or even mining or industry. 
The production brigade in many instances has apparently 
taken over the personnel and assets of one or more of the former 
APC's together with the commercial, financial, and welfare people 
formerly in the area of the APC's. The brigade constitutes a uni-
fied "accounting center," although profits and losses are pooled in 
the commune as a whole. In some cases the production brigade has 
appeared amazingly autonomous in its operations, as in those instances 
when it has been granted authority to draw up production contracts 
directly with state commercial organizations or to receive directly

the budget subsidies that have been recently authorized to aid poorer 
communes. Because this kind of bypassing of the top administrative 
layer of the commune brings into question the raison dlgtre of the 
commune itself, it is believed that control over the policies of the 
production brigade by the top administrative level of the commune 
will have to be very clearly established in the future. 
Under the production brigades, at the lowest level of au-
thority, are the specialized production teams. Production teams 
carry out agricultural, industrial-, and construction tasks under the 
direct control of the brigade. 
The internal organization of the commune, as described 
to this point, is in three tiers. When several hsiang-wide communes 
are amalgamated into a hsien-wide commune, a fourth tier of control 
is introduced. The new structure presumably would consist of (a) the 
top administrative layer, (b) administrative districts (the former 
hsiang-wide commune), (c) production brigades, and (d) production 
teams. 
Role of the Party 
The Chinese Communist Party plays a prominent role in com-
mune administration, but whereas all other elements -- such as agri-
culture, industry, commerce, finance, credit, communal services, 
planning and statistics, and militia -- are designed to be subordi-
nate in the monolithic structure of the commune, the Party remains 
a separate -- and superior -- element. Each commune? has a Party com-
mittee, headed by a secretary. In addition to several departments 
at headquarters, the Party generally sets up branch committees in 
both the production brigades and the production teams. The commune 
Party committee reviews major problems in commune administration, di-
rects propaganda within the commune, sees to it that state procurement 
quotas are being met, and performs the function of an inspector 
general, acting as the agent of the central Party apparatus. In some 
cases the secretary of the local Party unit is also chairman of the 
commune, and in these cases the separation of commune and Party lines 
of control is not fully realized. This blending of commune and Party 
control, however, is diametrically opposed to the Party line 27/ and 
may be expected to diminish once the communes become established on a 
more solid basis. 
B. Agriculture 
Before communes were established, state plans for agricultural 
production were primarily limited to indirect planning through the 
setting of national goals such as average yields and sown acreage for

major crops. The principal points of contact of the state plan with 
the local levels were the quotas set for the collection of taxes and 
for the purchase of major agricultural commodities. Now, however, 
in addition to their role as basic production units, communes are 
also basic planning units, linked directly to the hsien Party com-
mittees and the state planning organs. The result is a simplifica-
tion of planning procedures and a strengthening of control. 
Since the establishment of communes, attempts have been made 
to determine the most efficient system of control over agricultural 
production. In Shantung, the experience of which is probably appli-
cable to most of the country, the commune is expected to draw up 
plans and set targets for the production brigades and production 
teams. Such plans are to be drawn up "on the basis of unified state 
plans and on the principle of suiting local conditions," with pre-
liminary consultations held at all levels before the final plans for 
the communes are established. Once goals are set, however, the bri-
gades and teams are then required to make detailed arrangements to 
guarantee the fulfillment of their quotas. In some communes a sys-
tem of internal contracts between the top administrative layer and 
subordinate production units has been instituted for this purpose. 
This development may reflect the increase in size of the communes to 
the point where control by the top layer over actual production be-
comes more and more a matter of formalized administrative procedure. 
In their work for 1959, communes are generally planning to 
continue three of the mass campaigns which characterized the "leap 
forward" of 1958 -- conservation of water, collection of fertilizer, 
and the introduction of improved farm tools on a large scale. Com-
munes are expected to offer considerable advantages over APC's in 
carrying out large-scale irrigation, reclamation, and flood control 
construction projects. With greatly increased labor force units re-
sulting both from the amalgamation of APC's and from the establish-
ment of public service facilities, the typical commune immediately 
gains the potential benefits of labor mobility and flexibility. With 
more efficient use of the labor force, less capital will be required 
to achieve the same results in large-scale irrigation and water con-
servation tasks. With a more rational allocation of land, including 
the elimination of many field boundaries, a more efficient program 
for conserving water should be possible. The task of the communes in 
making additional gains comparable to those of the 1957-58 campaign 
is a difficult one, because the pay-off from further extension of 
irrigation diminishes as the program advances into less and less 
tractable areas. The introduction of improved tools on a wide scale 
is considered a basic step in the long-range drive toward the mech-
anization of agriculture, a goal once set for as late as 1977 but now

moved up to the Second Five Year Plan in some areas. lY The cam-
paign to invent new farm tools, to improve old ones, and to mechanize 
as many agricultural operations as possible received a great amount 
of publicity in 1958. The campaign will probably become more urgent 
in 1959, when demands on the labor force are likely to increase still 
further. Results could be increasingly effective, however, with the 
establishment of industrial facilities to support the program and im-
proved channels for distribution of the equipment. In general, how-
ever, technological developments in agriculture in Communist China 
will continue to follow for a long time the principle of the combina-
tion of smn.11 amounts of relatively simple capital equipment with 
large amounts of labor. 
As mentioned above, one of the most important contributions 
expected from the communes is the fuller use of the labor force. 
Off-season agricultural labor is to be used in operating the new 
small-scale industrial facilities of the communes. The need for 
properly planning the efficient use of the large pools of manpower 
on communes was stressed early in the campaign and has continued to 
be stressed. In spite of such emphasis, however, instances of im-
proper and inefficient allocations of a rapidly tightening labor sup-
ply* have frequently been reported, especially in the case of the 
harvest of grain and cotton crops in late 1958. Premier Chou En-lai, 
at the National Peoples Congress in April 1959, claimed that the num-
ber of people engaged in agriculture "should not in general be less 
than 80 percent of the manpower available in the countryside." 12/ 
This statement was a sharp reversal of earlier plans to divide com-
mune manpower about equally between agriculture and industry. 
C. Industry, Including Handicrafts  
The industrial activity of communes is considered one of their 
major responsibilities and also one of their most important advantages. 
The combined ideological and economic importance of such industry to 
communes was editorially stated as follows: "In order to develop the 
economy of the peoples communes rapidly at the present stage and re-
duce step by step the differences between city and countryside and 
workers and peasants over a longer period, it is necessary to carry 
out the industrialization of the peoples communes." 22/ 
* In a study on Communist China a distinction should be made between 
two meanings of the term shortage of labor: (a) the meaning according 
to which labor in the aggregate is scarce relative to land and capital 
(a situation which does not exist in Communist China); and (b) the 
meaning according to Which labor has been subject to high-pressure 
mobilization for many competing purposes in which large amounts of 
labor can be readily used (a situation which does exist in Communist 
China).-

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
The December Party resolution on communes pointed out more 
specifically the mission of commune industry: "Industrial production 
of the peoples communes must be closely linked with agricultural pro-
duction. It should, first of all, serve the development of agricul-
ture and the mechanization and electrification of farming; and, at 
the same time, it should serve to meet the demands of commune members 
for daily necessities, and serve the great industries of the country 
and the socialist market." 21/ 
Industrial production by communes is only indirectly guided 
by the state plan at the present time. Industrial production goals 
are indirectly levied on communes by means of contracts drafted be-
tween the communes and state commercial organizations down to and 
including the hsien level. In the communes, industrial planning may 
be carried out on two levels -- the top administrative level and the 
production brigade. The commune is charged with the fulfillment of 
state plan quotas, which it has contracted to meet. The commune also 
exerts direct control over the plans for major plants and mines under 
its jurisdiction as well as over plan targets for capital construction 
and the production of important products. The production brigade is 
required to fulfill the production and construction targets trans-
mitted down from the top layer of the commune, and the brigade trans-
mits this pressure to its production teams. 
Commline-directed industry covers many types of activity, in-
cluding iron works capable of forging and repairing farm tools; pro-
ducer goods plants producing such materials as cement, fertilizer, 
and iron and steel; small powerplants; plants to supply semiprocessed 
materials to larger industrial enterprises; and plants producing con-
sumer goods such as processed foods, textiles, footwear, paper, and 
household furnishings. Farm machinery plants and traditional ferti-
lizer plants* are the most common types of industrial facilities at 
the present time. 
When communes were set up, the full-time production activities 
of handicraft cooperatives and the part-time handicraft pursuits of 
APC members came under the control of communes, and many small instal-
lations became "industrial plants" overnight. By late 1958 the fantas-
tic figure of 6 million local industrial facilities were claimed to be 
under the operation of communes and hsien governments. 22/ Some 
* In traditional fertilizer plants, various types of organic or in-
organic materials are combined at a low technical level -- for example, 
the process may be the crushing of phosphate rock or the mixing and 
fermenting of human or anims1 manure.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
handicraft production, formerly included in the output of the agri-
cultural sector, now appears to be classified as industrial produc-
tion. "Handicraft" production, under that name, seems to have all 
but disappeared from the rural scene with the advent of communes. 
There are several other reasons for the changing status of 
the part-time production activities carried out by peasants. The 
mass labor projects of the communes have had priority and have quite 
effectively prevented the peasants from working at their traditional 
spare-time pursuits. The decline of the household as the basic unit 
of rural labor, the practical cessation of household agricultural 
production, and the institution of public service facilities on a 
wide scale have prevented the continuation of many of the former 
spare-time activities by individuals. 
The extreme limitation on spare-time production activities of 
individuals -- an effort which was in part devoted to the production of 
supplementary foods such as vegetables and meat -- was a contributing 
factor to the serious difficulties in food supply which arose in the 
fall of 1958. Similarly, the former spare-time output of "handicraft" 
products suffered. Increased emphasis has since been placed on the 
development of all types of so-called sideline occupations, under cen-
tralized commune control. The policy of developing a diversified 
economy has been stressed, and a greater effort to produce much-needed 
consumer goods of a handicraft or home-industry nature should take 
place as a result, but on a more carefully planned basis than previously 
and with wages often replacing profits as an incentive. The economic 
setbacks which result from upsetting the traditional balance of peasant 
off-season labor comprise a lesson which the regime appears to have 
forgotten -- the same type of shortage occurred in 1956 as a result of 
the intense collectivization and construction drive during the winter 
of 1955-56. 
The native iron and steel campaign of 1958 was a much propa-
gandized activity which began on APC's and under local governments 
as a part of the "leap forward" and continued on communes after their 
establishment. Thousands of sman blast furnaces sprang up like mush-
rooms throughout the countryside, often in out-of-the-way locations. 
About 175,000 small native furnaces were reportedly in operation by 
September 1958. 
The campaign was a huge propaganda success, and the smAll fur-
naces even produced about one-third of the total pig iron output of 
1958. But there were many shortcomings in the campaign; men and ma-
terials (notably coal) were inefficiently used, transportation prob-
lems were created, and the quality of the steel was generally poor.

As a result, many of the inefficient units have been shut down in 
1959. Where locational factors permit, however, a native furnace 
may become the nucleus for a small mill. 
D. Commerce 
The commercial departments of communes were formed by taking 
over the supply and marketing cooperatives, which previously had con-
stituted the component of the state-controlled system which distributed 
the bulk of consumer goods and farm tools and supplies in rural areas. 
The funds of the former cooperatives became the operating funds of the 
commune commercial departments, the personnel of the cooperatives were 
transferred to the communes, and the commercial functions of the co-
operatives were assumed by the communes. The commercial departments, 
although within the commune administrative framework, operate under 
the direction of the state commercial departments and maintain sepa-
rate accounting systems, but profits from the commercial departments 
are remitted to the commune.* 
The first responsibility of the commune commercial department 
is to fulfill the quotas for purchases by the state. The department 
is also charged with the purchase and sale of commodities normally 
distributed through the market. In keeping with the principle that 
they should not be allowed to increase their income through excessive 
commercial profits, communes are required in all their transactions to 
abide by the procurement prices and retail prices set by the state. 
The December resolution on communes pointed out that, although 
communes should develop production which directly meets their own 
needs, they should also act to increase production of commodities for 
which they have a natural advantage. Such commodities would be ex-
changed with other communes and with state-owned enterprises. Through 
exchange the communes could get the machinery and equipment needed to 
improve agriculture as well as obtaining the consumer goods required 
to meet the needs of commune members. To insure fulfillment of plans 
for commodity exchange, the institution of an extensive system of con-
tracts between the state and the communes and among communes was called 
for in the December "Resolution to Improve Commune Finance and Com-
merce." 
* Once more we have the problem of dual control over an economic or-
ganization -- in this instance, subordination of commercial depart-
ments to the commune's administration, on the one hand, and to the 
central apparatus controlling commerce, on the other. It is believed 
that, if the communes are to play their fundamental role as the single 
tightly knit unit of control -- which is assigned all responsibility 
at the local level for directing an economy in miniature -- they must 
have a stronger hold over commercial activities than they ndw appear 
to exercise.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
State plans at the national, provincial, and even at the hsien 
levels include targets only for comparatively important industrial 
and agricultural products. Contracts concluded under the new system 
have, however, the intent of encouraging the production and distribu-
tion of many types of less important products which are nonetheless 
important consumer items. The contracts cover a vast range of ma-
terials and commodities, stipulating the type, amount, quality, time 
of delivery, and means of transport in most cases. In producing the 
coMmodities under contract, communes are supposed to receive strong 
support from the hsien commercial departments in the form of "tech-
nical guidance, financial aid, and supplies of raw materials." Al-
though it is not clear how much freedom is allowed or how widespread 
the practice, production brigades in communes are allowed to sign 
contracts directly with state commercial departments. 
E. Finance and Credit  
Financial work is carried out by the financial and credit 
departments of the individual communes. Although both departments 
control commune funds, each has its distinctive functions. The finan-
cial department controls the financial income and expenditures of the 
commune. Commune income is derived primarily from the sales of prod-
ucts, and expenditures are primarily for capital construction, for 
wages, and for purchases from the outside. The credit department 
accepts deposits and makes interest-bearing loans to commune opera-
tional units for use as working capital in agricultural and industrial 
production and in commercial activities. In May 1959, permission to 
extend credit to individuals for the purchase of piglets was one of 
the measures taken to stimulate hog production. 
Theoretically the financial and credit departments are mutually 
supporting as the credit department can concentrate all temporarily 
idle capital which cannot be mobilized by the financial department and 
then can lend this capital to other departments where needed. Credit 
departments have been established in the communes through the absorp-
tion of the personnel, fixed assets, and working capital of the credit 
cooperatives which formerly existed in the rural areas. The financial 
workers of former hsiang and hsien governments and of APC's became 
financial personnel of the communes. 
The most important tasks in the financial work of communeslin 
the order of priority, are the following: (1) the collection of 
taxes for the state, (2) the accumulation of public funds for the com-
mune, and (3) the distribution of the product within the commune. The 
basic taxation responsibilities of the communes were laid out in the 
December financial resolution. EL4/ The "one quota" system, called for

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
in the resolution, represents an attempt to consolidate the various 
types of taxes, heretofore levied on individuals and organizations 
now included within the commune, into one single payment levied on 
the commune as a single tax-paying entity. In computing the "one 
quota" tax, former agricultural, industrial, and commercial taxes 
are combined with income from enterprises recently transferred to 
the commune and income from other sources. Certain administrative 
and operational expenses formerly borne by the state are then de-
ducted and a portion of the difference forwarded to higher authori-
ties. These funds can be either a fixed amount or an amount propor-
tional to the commune income, with allowance being made for basic 
natural and economic differences among the various communes. In 
attempting to equalize tax burdens, the policy is generally to 
place a heavier burden on richer areas, on areas of industrial 
crops rather than food crops, and on areas with a greater develop-
ment of industrial and commercial subsidiary production. _21/ This 
kind of tax policy illustrates the ability of the state under the 
commune system to "extract" more resources from relatively well-to-
do areas than under the former system of organization. 
In addition to assistance in the form of relatively lighter 
tax burdens, the central government can provide to poorer communes 
financial assistance such as the 1959 budgetary a]location of 1 bil-
lion yuan* announced in April 1959 at the National Peoples Congress. 
It should be noted that these same communes might well be paying 
taxes of that amount or more and that there is, therefore, no assur-
ance as to how much of the 1 billion yuan, if any, is net support. 
The second basic task of financial work in communes is 
internal -- namely, the accumulation and maintenance of (1) public 
reserves for investment in productive facilities and (2) public wel-
fare funds for the development of facilities for education, health, 
culture, and other welfare services. Recent editorial comment has 
demanded that agriculture must be assigned top priority in the allo-
cation of public reserves, and the recent emphasis on manpower allo-
cations seems to bear out such a trend. The periodical Hung 0h'i, 
in fact, called for the diversion of "superfluous" capital from indus-
try back to agriculture. 2g 
The third major responsibility of financial work in communes 
is the distribution of income to individual members. A great deal of 
fanfare accompanied the institution of the part-supply and part-wage 
* Yuan values in this report are expressed in current yuan and may 
be converted to US dollars at the official rate of exchange of 2.46 
yuan to US $1. This rate of exchange, however, does not necessarily 
reflect the true dollar value.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
system in the enthusiastic early days of the commune movement. An 
ever-increasing portion of an individual's basic requirements for 
food, clothing, and shelter supposedly was to be distributed on a 
"free supply" basis, according to need. The peasants soon, however, 
began to lose the incentives which were more directly encouraged 
under the labor-day system of remuneration. As a result, there has 
been a considerable toning down of the "distribution according to 
needs" since the appearance of the December resolution on communes. 
Basic' supplies may continue to be furnished in a number of instances, 
but a regular system of wages tied in some way to the individual's 
level of production generally will prevail, and bonuses and other 
incentive measures may be expected to increase in order to maintain 
the productive efforts of the members of the communes. The official 
policy now appears to be a strong return to the socialist principle 
of "to each according to his labor." There now seems to be recog-
nition that production is by no means sufficiently advanced to permit 
consumption to be divorced from production. For example, Peking in 
May 1959 declared that idle people were not entitled to get food from 
public stocks. 
In December 1958, regulations governing the operation of credit 
departments were approved by the State Council. El/ Among important 
features are the stipulations that all cash deposits and loans handled 
within the commune will bear interest and that capital flowing between 
credit departments and upper-level banks will be handled as deposits 
and loans, with a monthly rate of interest of 0.42 percent. Although 
discretion may be exercised in granting loans to various commune de-
partments, funds must not be used for capital construction but must 
remain relatively fluid for continuous support of current production 
activities and commodity circulation. Beginning in 1959 the interest 
rates on agricultural, industrial, and commercial loans have been 
standardized throughout the country at 0.6 percent per month in an 
attempt to promote uniformity of credit operations between the rural 
and urban areas. At the same time, interest on savings deposits will 
be considerably reduced. It is not at present known to what degree 
individuals in communes are coerced into putting money in savings 
deposits, although the doubling of the amount of rural savings de-
posits in 1958 perhaps gives some indication. It hardly seems likely 
that this aspect of an individual's life will escape the scrutiny of 
the state. 
F. Services 
One of the most publicized features of communes has been the 
institution of the public messhalls, which were quickly organized 
during the early stages of the commune movement. Commune members 
were generally forced to eat in the messhalls as soon as they were

set up -- to emphasize this policy, household cooking equipment was 
"donated" to the scrap drive during the 1958 iron and steel campaign. 
Through the use of messhalls and other public services a large supply 
of labor, especially female labor, has been released for other pro-
duction and construction work in the communes. Other advantages are 
claimed to be better control of food supplies, conservation of fuel, 
and general improvement in living standards_. By March 1959, about 
3.6 million messhalls are reported to have been established. 
These messhalls serve more than 90 percent of all commune members 
and have an average of 100 to 150 persons per messhall. There has 
been some relaxation in messhall membership requirements recently, 
however, and members in some areas have been allowed to take food 
home or even to withdraw from membership if desired. There have also 
been some cases in which commune housing construction has included 
individual kitchen facilities for each dwelling unit. Whether peas-
ants are eating better or worse in the messhalls depends largely on 
highly localized economic conditions as well as the time of year and 
the attitude of the commune's administrators. 
Although messhalls are probably the most spectacular form of 
commune public service, other types of facilities have been estab-
lished both to release labor and, ostensibly, to improve living stand-
ards. Nurseries and kindergartens have been established in both the 
rural and urban areas, releasing many women for other tasks. By 
March 1959, nearly 5 million nurseries and kindergartens reportedly 
had been established, with 70 percent of all the preschool children 
throughout the country in attendance. 22/ Schools and "collages" 
have been established, operated under the basic Communist policy of 
combining education and production. Many of the schools are board-
ing schools, allowing more complete control over the part-time educa-
tional and part-time labor activities of commune youth. 
Other commune public service facilities include tailor shops, 
laundries, medical and hospital facilities, old people's homes,* and 
new housing facilities. The construction of communal housing has 
probably been the most controversial "service" outside of messhalls. 
Earlier enthusiasts called for dormitories separated according to sex 
and ignoring family relationships. Such excesses proved to be 
* Old people's homes are given the deftly ironic title of "happy 
homes." The general effectiveness with which the regime can squeeze 
additional productive effort out of the populace is illustrated by 
the assignment of such tasks as raising chickens to the occupants of 
"happy homes." The poetic and often humorous phraseology employed 
by the Chinese Communists in their ruthless march toward their ver-
sion of the brave new world makes interesting reading compared with 
the humorless and boorish administrative language of the USSR.

Is probable that -- in spite of enthusiastic talk about the breakup 
of the bourgeois family -- any separation of members of families was 
almost always caused by assignments to jobs in outlying areas and 
not by deliberate official policy. 
G. Planning and Statistics  
The commune is an integrated unit for planning purposes and 
in some respects represents a miniature planned economy. The develop-
ment of the commune system, however, has not yet proceeded to the 
point where full-blown planning can be carried out. The commune 
similarly represents a central unified point of accounting; all sta-
tistics on production, income, and expenditures are being (or will be) 
collected and compiled by the planning and statistics department of 
the commune. In contrast with the shadowy control formerly exercised 
by the central government, therefore, the communes provide a poten-
tially effective means of control by the central authorities over 
agricultural planning and production and over the handicraft sector 
of the economy. 
In the past, reliable statistics on rural production were most 
difficult to obtain. Effective planning of rural production was not 
possible. Tremendous numbers of smAll reporting units that had no 
established system for keeping records on output or income were in-
volved. The extension of state control into these areas through con-
solidation of the myriad small units -- APC' s, handicraft shops, and 
small industrial units -- into communes permits the central authori-
ties to control local planning more closely and to obtain statistics 
on kinds of output that previously had not been adequately covered. 
In 1958, however, the "leap forward" program brought about a 
situation in which planning and statistical reporting increasingly 
served as propaganda material for the support of emulation drives. 
Local leaders were encouraged to set high goals in order to promote 
"production enthusiasm," and the high goals sometimes seemed to ac-
quire gradually the status of actual production achievements. In 
addition, the system of production was changed drastically, and ac-
counting procedures that had no counterpart in previous economic re-
porting were introduced. The new accounting procedures tended to 
measure not only increases in output but also output not included in

previous statistics oroutput which was achieved at the expense of 
a decline in farm home industry or other household activities not 
previously measured. In addition, there has been a chronic lack of 
statistical workers to cover rural areas in detail, and there have 
been delays in setting up the planning and statistical departments 
of communes. 
H. Militia 
Widely publicized during the latter part of 1958, the militia 
program was established with two announced purposes: to strengthen 
the production effort and to promote national security. The militia 
was expected to contribute significantly to national security, both 
Internal and external, but its importance up to now has been primarily 
in the application of military organization and methods to commune 
production tasks. The organization of labor into quasimilitary bri-
gades wa8 expected to permit a high degree of mobility, to make ad-
justment to collective living easier, and to generate an enthusiastic 
"combat spirit" in production activity. Although more than 18 million 
commune militiamen are claimed to have been trained by units of the 
PLA,* the military character of communes has been considerably deempha-
sized in the past few months. In fact, it was flatly stated in Jan-
uary that the organization of production along military lines did not 
Imply that communes were "troop camps" or that members were "combat-
ants of military units" but merely that "people must work in a more 
organized and orderly manner." 2_7/ 
I. Others 
Depending upon size, natural factors, and the complexity of 
economic operations, the commune may have other staff departments. 
For example, a commune covering a large area may assign to a trans-
port department the responsibility of coordinating the use of the 
limited transport facilities -- primarily animnl-drawn carts, animals, 
and men. In a commune which has as a major economic activity the 
operation of small river boats, the transport department would be 
among the major staff departments. Similarly, in areas where local 
conditions favor concentration on activities such as animal husbandry, 
forestry, fishing, and mining, staff departments for these activities 
would be established. 
Departments of construction and of science and technology 
might also be set up. The building of dams and irrigation ditches, 
construction of industrial plants and dwellings, and other construc-
tion would come under the general supervision of the construction 
department. The science and technology department of a primarily 
agricultural commune would concentrate on the development and in-
troduction of improved farm tools and seeds, better agricultural

techniques, and improvements in animal husbandry. This department in 
a commune with industrial facilities would cover a wider and more 
complex range of scientific and technological work. 
There is in the typical commune a department of internal af-
fairs. So far as is known, this department concerns itself with 
governmental administrative matters rather than economic matters. 
TV. Economic Effects of Communes 
A. On the Economic Control Structure 
Communes represent an unprecedented concentration of control 
over all aspects of economic life in rural areas. Control over agri-
cultural, industrial and handicraft, commercial, and financial ac-
tivity has been unified through the amalgamation of former APC's and 
rural commercial and financial organs into the commune structure. 
Planning is being centralized under the communes, and the system of 
internal and external contracts is affecting an ever-growing number 
of productive and commercial operations. 
B. On the Allocation of Economic Resources  
From the economic point of view, the year 1958 was a year of 
remarkable achievement, but part of the cost of the achievement was 
a gross misallocation of resources in important sectors of the econ-
omy. Three examples follow: 
Relatively Too 
Many Resources Devoted To: 
Growing Main Food Crops ... vs 
Stoking Blast Furnaces ... vs 
Industrial Production ... vs 
000 
O00 
O00 
Relatively Too 
Few Resources Devoted To:?  
Growing Subsidiary Food Crops 
Harvesting Crops 
Transportation 
The mobilization psychology of the "leap forward" program 
was designed to bring forth, above all, more output, and it was 
hardly to be expected that the program could at the same time pre-
serve the niceties of resource allocation as prescribed in bourgeois 
economic thinking. The communes, which affected the allocation of 
resources only in the last few months of 1958, were supposed to re-
duce the organizational tangles associated with the do-or-die mobi-
lization of resources under the "leap forward" program. It should 
be noted, however, that the communes were a powerful force for both 
good and evil. The communes, because of the greater breadth of their 
control over resources, could make grosser mistakes -- as well as 
achieve more striking successes -- in the allocation of resources.

The chairman of a commune, for example, could put people on a 
flood-control project when rice was standing in the field unhar-
vested. The chairman of an AFC could not be induced to do this 
nearly so readily under the old system, and if he did, the conse-
quences would be less widespread. An example of dubious allocation 
of raw materials is the case of the backyard blast furnaces which 
used as much as 5 tons of coking coal per ton of crude steel, com-
pared with the 1 ton of coking coal required in modern mills. 
In the process of "tidying up" communes, the communes were 
ordered, as described in C, below, to switch their allocation of 
manpower between agricultural and nonagricultural activities from 
50-50 to 80-20. Even taking into account the fact that these ratios 
are benchmarks rather than fixed standards imposed on every single 
commune, it would appear that a more blunt instrument for allocation 
of labor resources could hardly be devised, because under a rational 
system of allocation some remote communes should have a 99-1 ratio 
whereas other communes that contain plentiful industrial raw materials 
should have a 50-50 or even smaller ratio. 
It is therefore evident that sometimes the communes have ag-
gravated the difficulties in allocation of resources, difficulties 
encountered previously when the regime embarked on the "leap forward" 
program. In spite of these difficulties the communes on balance in-
creased total output in 1958 above what it otherwise would have been. 
They introduced a shot of adrenalin into the mobilization program and 
brought about a considerable intensification of the degree to which 
resources -- both hmsn and nonhuman -- were worked. It is true that 
many of the gains are of a once-and-for-all nature, notably the in-
crease in the hours of work and the pace of work, but nonetheless the 
communes appear to be for the long run an effective instrument for 
carrying out the economic policies and plans of the regime. 
Within the commune itself the possibilities for bettering the 
allocation of labor, raw materials, and other resources are limited 
by the nature of directives imposed from above. To achieve a rational 
use of resources by the communes, the central leadership will have to 
produce plan directives which take into account the considerable varia-
tion in resources among communes. To the extent that a mobilization 
psychology is considered necessary from time to time to spur enthusiasm 
for the regime, the rationR1 use of resources will be sacrificed to a 
considerable degree, but, judging from the experience of the last 4 
years, the regime is willing to pay the price.

C. On Agricultural Production 
Although much credit is given communes for the bumper harvest 
of 1958, the specific programs to help agriculture, such as increased 
irrigation and application of fertilizer and improved techniques of 
planting and cultivation, were already being carried on before the 
commune movement began. The record harvest of winter wheat in 1957-58, 
for example, was achieved before communes were established. The mo-
bilization of men and materials under the commune structure, however, 
did supply new impetus to the measures already in operation. 
The smalgamation of many ATC's and supporting rural institu-
tions under central control as well as the release of still greater 
numbers of workers through the establishment of public service fa-
cilities gave communes control over unprecedentedly large and mobile 
gangs of workers. Hours of work and pace of work greatly increased 
along with numbers of workers, but so great were the tasks in pro-
duction and construction that shortages of labor in rural areas re-
placed the surpluses of 1957. The intensity with which labor was 
driven in 1958 is illustrated by the warnings given local authorities 
toward the end of the year to allow peasants sufficient rest to pre-
vent serious fatigue or illness. 
Communes, by their very nature, have deemphasized the indi-
vidual and the household in the production process. It appears now, 
however, that in order to increase the agricultural sideline occupa-
tions that were passed by during the "leap forward" program --
especially the raising of livestock and the growing of vegetables 
and other subsidiary food products -- more productive latitude will 
be given individuals and households. In a turnabout typical of 
Chinese Communist economic policy, small plots of land, fertilizer 
and feed supplies, and flexibility in work assignments are being 
given households which raise hogs and other livestock under a policy 
started in May 1959. 
In the early period of communalization a rough rule of man-
power allocation within communes was 50 percent to agriculture and 
50 percent to industry, construction, transportation, commerce, and 
other nonagricultural activities. The assignment of millions of 
peasants to making iron and steel and digging coal, along with the 
heavy labor requirements of large-scale projects in irrigation and 
flood control, often resulted in unharvested or poorly harvested 
crops and a drop in subsidiary agricultural production. Alarmed at 
this trend, Premier Chou En-lai at the National Peoples Congress in 
April 1959 called for the assignment of at least 80 percent "of the 
manpower available in the countryside" to agriculture.

Communes constitute a more effective instrument of economic 
control over agriculture, not only in the mobilization of labor but 
also in the introduction of more efficient methods of cultivation, 
Irrigation, and use of fertilizers. Under preceding collectivist 
and semicollectivist organizations, Chinese agriculture was subject 
to gradual changes, but the commune system like a gigantic battering 
ram has broken down resistance to technological change in response 
to the leadership's drive for more and more change, faster and faster. 
Eventually -- when the future development of the economy of Communist 
China permits the allocation of more complex capital equipment to 
agriculture -- the communes should prove to be an excellent instru-
ment for the mechanization of agriculture. 
Communes have encouraged the "leap forward" technique of a 
highly concentrated effort on a small area with resulting yields that 
are astounding if true. The success of the highly touted experimental 
plot campaign of 1958 was apparently responsible for the adoption of 
the revolutionary policy to reduce sown acreage to one-third its for-
mer size and to concentrate an all-out productive drive on this re-
duced area. This system was put into operation to some extent begin-
ning with the winter wheat crop of 1958-59, but there were complaints 
in April and May 1959 that the acreage sown to wheat was insufficient 
after all and should really have been much greater. In June 1959 the 
policy was officially abandoned. This policy was foolish from the 
start in view of the existence of a huge rural labor force whose po-
tential was becoming more and more fully mobilized under the commune 
system. 
The experience of 1958 in agriculture -- when the production 
of basic food crops increased 20 percent, but the production of vege-
tables, meats, and other subsidiary foods at best held their own --
suggests that (1) the "mobilization psychology" of the communes is 
best suited for large, relatively simple crops compared with subsid-
iary agricultural production, and (2) attempts to obtain diversified, 
balanced agricultural production under the commune system will en-
gender further, limited concessions to private enterprise until the 
commune system is well enough organized to control efficiently the 
allocation of labor in detail. 
D. On Industrial Production 
In 1958, industry which came within the commune system re-
portedly produced approximately one-third of the nation's pig iron, 
about 40 percent of its coal, one-quarter of its steel, and consider-
able quantities of agricultural tools and equipment, fertilizer, and 
insecticides. Quality was the big problem; for example, the steel 
produced by the many small and inefficient blast furnaces was almost

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
universally low in quality. As management and technical skills im-
prove, small-scale rural industrialization should meet many of the 
local requirements, especially of agriculture, where quantity is more 
important than quality at this stage of economiq development. Com-
mune industry will not, however, supplant larger scale enterprises in 
the production of products or equipment where higher quality and lar-
ger investments are required; but if large-scale industry will not 
come to the commune, the commune will come to large-scale industry, 
which may well be organized under communes once the rural areas are 
digested. In order to avoid in the future the disruption of tra-
ditional peasant activities caused by the vigorous Channeling of 
off-season agricultural labor into commune industrial activity in 
late 1958, a more careful allocation of manpower will be required, 
with important agricultural activities granted priority. It seems 
inevitable that -- instead of the development of the all-purpose 
communal man who can drop his manure dipper and pick up his wrench 
at the local farm implement plant -- there will be a tendency to 
develop specialists in certain industrial operations who will grad-
ually lose contact with their original agricultural pursuits. 
Many of the so-called industrial enterprises of communes are 
merely the small and relatively crude handicraft activities which 
have been carried on for many years. Labor, low-quality raw ma-
terials, and some simple equipment were all that were required. Some 
of these activities will not vary much even when the general level of 
technology advances, but others will tend toward increased scale, the 
use of more complex plant and equipment, and the use of raw materials 
of higher quality and greater variety. Potentially the communes af-
ford the chance for rural areas to provide a large part of their own 
needs for agricultural tools and supplies, construction materials, 
and manufactured consumer goods. At the same time, the building up 
of industry in the communes should help reduce the problems formerly 
caused by the migration of large numbers of peasants to the cities. 
E. On the Accumulation of Real Capital 
To the extent that the communes live up to their promise of 
providing an effective system of economic organization, they will 
bring about substantial increases in agricultural and industrial 
production and thereby greatly speed up the accumulation of real 
capital in the economy. Historically, one of the great economic 
missions of the countryside in the Communist scheme of things has 
been to supply a margin of product over and above consumption, this 
margin being necessary to feed and clothe the growing urban popula-
tion, to finance the import of machinery needed for the industrializa-
tion program, and to support a large military establishment. The 
communes are an excellent instrument for maximizing the margin between

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
the output of the countryside and its consumption because (1) the 
greatly increased intensity with which the labor force of the coun-
tryside is worked results in more output and (2) the greatly in-
creased control exercised by the commune over individual consumption 
results in limiting increases in consumption to the level necessary 
to maintain labor's productive efficiency and to reward hard work 
(in this connection, the previous situation in which peasants in rich 
APC's Shared fortuitously in the returns from land and capital is 
being eliminated under the communes). 
F. On the Distribution of Income 
One of the most revolutionary features of the newly estab-
lished communes was the institution of a "free supply" system. The 
regime ordered free grain and other commodities -- the type and 
amount depending upon local conditions -- to be issued to all peasants 
regardless of their productive efforts, and it appeared that the sys-
tem was to be applied more widely once the communes had become better 
organized and had established additional public service facilities 
such as messhalls, dormitories, and tailor shops. This new method of 
distribution was heralded as the first step in realizing the Communist 
ideal of "to each according to his need." The loss of incentive 
which immediately followed, however, forced authorities to revert to 
the previous distribution system under which the distribution is based 
on productive effort. In those cases in which basic supplies continue 
to be issued without money payments, it is now clear, first, that the 
issue will be contingent upon the individual's being productively em-
ployed (or grudgingly admitted to be useless), and, second, that the 
receipt of these supplies will be taken into consideration in setting 
cash wage payments. 
The natural endowments of the former APC's -- especially 
climate, topography, and soil -- varied considerably. With peasants' 
income reflecting such conditions, it was impossible for the members 
of many APC's to achieve more than a bare subsistence standard of 
living. The basic conditions of communes also vary considerably, but 
to a lesser extent because of their larger size. With ownership of 
equipment and control over production more highly centralized than be-
fore, with certain basic supplies and services available to all, and 
with recent plans to aid poorer communes through state budgetary al-
locations, the productive effort of the individual member becomes the 
major criterion for determining the monthly wages and bonuses. 
With the advent of communes, the advantages of urban over 
? rural living conditions have been reduced. Food shortages and severe 
rationing in cities during the first half of 1959 have occurred in 
spite of a claimed bumper harvest in 1958. It is believed that the

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-.T-I-A-L 
rural population has benefited considerably more than the urban pop-
ulation from the estimated 20-percent increase in the production of 
basic food crops in 1958 and that congestion and delay in transporta-
tion caused by the demands of the "leap forward" program on the 
nation's inadequate transportation network have prevented adequate 
quantities of grain from reaching urban areas. The shortage of sub-
sidiary food products -- for example, vegetables and meat -- caused 
by competing demands for the use of peasant labor has greatly cur-
tailed the supply of these products in both rural and urban areas. 
In spite of the recent improvement in the relative position of rural 
areas, it will probably require communalization of urban areas and 
a considerable period of time before the basic superiority of living 
conditions in urban areas will fade away. 
G. On Economic Self-Sufficiency 
An important economic question is whether or not the commune 
is inherently a self-sufficient economic unit. A related question 
is whether or not the policies of the regime call for an all-out ef-
fort to achieve economic self-sufficiency in the communes. The mono-
lithic structure of the commune organization itself -- its tightly 
knit control over all facets of human activity and human existence 
within a given geographical area -- is a giant step toward self-
sufficiency. The fact that for generations the rural areas of China 
have raised their own food, sewn their own clothes, and fashioned 
their own tools and utensils is another important basis for self-
sufficiency. And as for present-day motives for economic self-
sufficiency, the specter of atomic warfare makes attractive the idea 
of a society the central nervous system of which is composed of sec-
tions of ganglia, each section capable of an independent existence 
when cut off from the central brain. This point was raised by the 
regime itself during the Taiwan Straits crisis of 1958. 
The major factor in Communist China's economic situation that 
runs counter to the idea of self-sufficiency in the communes is the 
general necessity for each commune to specialize in a type of output 
for "export" to other parts of the economy for use in the industrial-
ization program -- for example, a "cotton commune" might have as its 
reason for being the ability to supply raw cotton for use in the mills 
of Shanghai. Perhaps a compromise on the issue of self-sufficiency 
will come about -- namely, a policy that each commune is expected to 
take care of the daily needs of the people but will depend on the out-
side for at least the complex types of capital equipment and indus-
trial products and will in turn send out ever-increasing supplies of 
foodstuffs and raw materials for the support of the industrializa-
tion program. Evidence of such a compromise is the present policy 
of becoming self-sufficient in vegetables but dropping production of

industrial products -7 like native steel -- in cases where local raw 
materials and technical skills are wanting. 
H. On the Growth of the Population 
An economic aspect of long-run importance is the opportunity 
potentially afforded by the communes for control over the rate of 
growth of population. The communes constitute a highly efficient 
mechanism for circulation of information on birth control. The birth 
control program, which was being strongly emphasized 2 years ago, is 
now, however, proceeding quietly, completely overshadowed by the "leap 
forward" campaign for production. Because the Party line is currently 
one of regarding the huge population of mainland China as an economic 
asset, there are no immediate prospects for a reinvigoration of the 
birth control program. Even if the regime does not wish to take ad-
vantage of the control over the growth of population afforded by the 
commune, the recasting of family life under the commune system -- the 
taking of women out of the home, the mobilizing of men in work gangs 
for distant projects, the communal raising of children, the separa-
tion of the aged from the family (in the new "happy homes"), the 
establishment of communal eating facilities, and the receipt of in-
come by individuals rather than by heads of families -- will have 
its own nonofficial influence on the rate of growth of population. 
V. Current Problems and Future Course of Communes 
One problem faced by the commune is how to restore or replace the 
output of small-scale industry and commerce that has been disrupted 
or neglected during the decade of Communist control of China. During 
the "leap forward" the mobilization of large gangs of workers for 
concentrated work on large irrigation projects or on main crops has 
adversely affected production of subsidiary foodstuffs such as vege-
tables and meat, and the taking of women from the household and giving 
them full-time jobs has meant a loss of their traditional domestic 
production and the necessity for establishing communal laundries, 
tailor shops, and other service facilities. The commune indeed 
has control over the entire range of economic ,activity in the local 
area, but the putting into effect of this control requires time and 
skill. Meanwhile, shortages of some subsidiary foodstuffs and de-
ficiencies in locally provided services continue. 
Part of the economic difficulty in establishing new systems of 
production under the communes concerns the effect on craftsmanship 
of the decline of individual control over production and the decline 
in individualism in general. Some reports on the communes suggest 
that a new all-purpose worker is being developed, one who works on 
crops for a season and then is transferred to a flood-control or 
-31-

C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
irrigation project for a few months, with his evenings being usefully 
employed perhaps in stoking small blast furnaces. This new type of 
worker is a wage earner, not a peasant who keeps the remainder of his 
crop after the landlord and tax collector have taken their shares; 
neither is he a skilled construction or industrial worker nor a crafts-
man. Although these opinions are largely conjectural, the point is 
that the commune system would seem to face a continuing difficulty in 
maintaining quality in those instances in which individual craftsman-
ship and individual control over production have heretofore been im-
portant. Over the long run, division of labor and acquisition of 
technical skills in communes probably will be encouraged, but that 
part of craftsmanship which depends on the craftsman's identifying 
himself with his own product will be hard to restore. 
The communes have a problem in establishing a system of distribu-
tion of income among the people of the commune. One aspect of the 
problem apparently has been greatly simplified, because the commune 
itself will ultimately be the single point at Which taxes are accounted 
for and collected by the central government. The counterpart of taxes 
paid to the central government will be the real goods that flow out 
of the commune and that are not requited by a flow back in.* 
Once the central government's share is taken, the remaining com-
mune income goes for investment and consumption. Ordinarily invest-
ment and consumption are thought of as competing alternatives, but one 
feature of economic activity in 1958 and early 1959 was that invest-
ment was increased by increasing the hours of work and the pace of 
work. The member of the commune did not sacrifice his meager consump-
tion in order to provide a higher level of investment; instead, he 
sacrificed rest and leisure. 
Investment is usually said to have priority over consumption, and 
indeed one of the purposes of the communes is to regulate the flow of 
foodstuffs and other goods in such a way that individuals or local 
groups cannot withhold too large a share of goods for their own use. 
"Too large" by Communist standards means larger than necessary to 
maintain a reasonably contented and reasonably well-nourished working 
force. Distribution of income will be carried out on a pragmatic 
basis under the communes but will remain a problem for the indefinite 
future because the economy of Communist China is not yet strong enough 
* Total inflows and outflows of all communes taken together do not 
balance off to zero, because (1) the communes are in rural areas, and 
it is the function of the rural areas to provide a "surplus" to sup-
port the industrialization program, and (2) the central government's 
use of resources to maintain a large military establishment is sup-
ported by net outflows from the communes.

to provide appreciably higher levels of consumption and still carry 
out the industrialization and military programs. 
The communes are now in an experimental stage. The degree of op-
position to their formation and to their consolidation varies from 
area to area, but it should be noted that the communes are well suited 
for the isolation and containment of resistance. The major economic 
problem in one area may be lack of fertilizer for the fields; in 
another, poor transportation. Some communes are rich in resources, 
some poor. The final form taken by communes probably will not be 
standardized but will reflect varying local conditions as well as 
the varying local experiences of the first years of operation. 
The extension of the system of communes to urban areas appears 
to be an inevitable development. As in the case of the rural com-
munes, however, the regime can and will adopt any particular set of 
rules of the game and still call the resulting organizations "com-
munes." One important economic difference between rural and urban 
communes is that urban communes would be in a vastly different posi-
tion with regard to self-sufficiency in food, although some attempt 
might be made to include portions of the neighboring countryside in 
urban communes. A second major economic difference between urban 
and rural communes is the difficulty of enforcing upon urban people 
the same level of consumption and the same kind of consumption pat-
tern that exist in rural communes. The leaders of Communist China 
are not under the same economic pressure to form communes in the 
urban areas as they have been in the rural areas, although they ap-
pear ideologically committed to introducing the system eventually.
