 Hanoi comment in the wake of the South Vietnamese withdrawal from
 Laos claims that it was a decisive, "total" victory with strategic
 as well as tactical implications.  Propagandists claim that all
 allied objectives in the operation were thwarted and that President
 Nixon's Vietnamization policy has been dealt a "mortal blow."
 Alleged allied losses in men and materiel are documented in a
 24 March communique from the "Laotian People's Liberation Army"
 which says that 15,400 troops were "put out of action."
 Continued condemnation of the concentrated U.S. air strikes
 against the DRV on 21-22 March includes a "special communique"
 from the DRV War Crimes Commission, released on the 26th, which
 stressed that "no threats, no war acts" can shake the Vietnamese
 people's determination to fight and win.  Vietnamese communist
 media carried the statements by the ARV and PRG delegations in
 Paris boycotting the 25 March session of the talks, but there has
 been no acknowledgment of the U.S. and GVN retaliatory suggestion
 that the 1 April session be postponed until the 8th.
 Peking's jubilation over the "brilliant" victories in Indochina,
 particularly the "rout" of allied forces in southern Laos, is
 expressed in a congratulatory message and a "victory" banquet
 during First Secretary Le Duan's stopover enroute to the CPSU
 congress.  Peking's willingness to mute Sino-Soviet differences
 in an Indochina context was reflected in NCNA's report that the
 Indochinese delegations had left for Moscow.  NCNA's announcement
 on Le Duan's arrival in Peking in May 1970 failed to acknowledge
 that he was returning from the Lenin centennial celebrations in
 Moscow.
 Soviet support for a political settlement in Vietnam, based on
 DRV and PRG proposals, was reaffirmed in Brezhncv's 30 March
 report to the 24th CPSU Congress.  He made no mention of the Laos
 operation in referring to "continuing" U.S. aggression against
 the peoples of Indochina, but routine Moscow propaganda pictures
 the operation as having demonstrated the failure of the Vietnamiza-
 tion policy.
 COMMUNISTS ASSESS "VICTORY" IN LAOS AS TURNING POINT IN WAR
 In the wake of the "decisive" battle on 20 March in the Ban Dong
 area and the South Vietnamese withdrawal from Laos, Hanoi propa-
 ganda assesses the communist "victory."  A particularly detailed

 analysis appears in an articla on the 22d in the army paper
 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN by military commentator "Chien Binh"
 (Combatant).*  Official statistics on the communist "victory"
 are released in a communique of the Laotian People's
 Liberation Army (LPLA) Supreme Command on the 24th and
 welcomed with further authoritative Hanoi comment in a NHAN
 DAN editorial on the 25th.  Feats in Laos are also praised
 in a message from DRV President Ton Duc Thang on the 25th.
 Other comment includes an article by "Quyet Thang"**
 (Determined to Win), broadcast on 28 March and published in
 the March issue of the monthly QUAN DOI NHAN DAN magazine.
 Uniformly, communist comment exultantly claims that the
 communist campaign in Laos against Operation Lam Son 719
 achieved total victory, completely thwarted allied objectives,
 destroyed a major portion of allied troops and equipment, and
 defeated basic U.S. tactics.  In arguing that allied objectives
 were not achieved, propagandists specify that the Laos opera-
 tion, among other things, was aimed at cutting supply routes,
 preventing major offensives by the South Vietnamese and
 Cambodian insurgents, breaking down the "resistance" of the
 three Indochinese peoples, demonstrating the feasability
 of Vietnamization and the Nixon Doctrine, and assuring the
 reelections of President Thieu and President Nixon.
 Hanoi press comment on the campaign holds that it was a
 major turning point in the war marking the inevitable defeat
 of Vietnamization and shifting the balance of forces on the
 battlefield.  This comment also suggests that the communists
 actually sought the confrontation between main forces units
 in Laos, in a departure from the tactics they had followed in
 the past two years.
 *   Chien Binh earlier commented on the Laos incursion in the
 26 February and 4 March issues of QUAN DOI NHPN DAN.  See the
 10 March TRENDS, pages 10-11.
 **  Quyet Thang is a military commentator whose articles have
 frequently appeared in the QUAN DOI NHAN DAN magazine. However,
 the last article known to have been attributed to him--on
 allied strategy in South Vietnam--was published in the January
 1971 HOC TAP.

 LPLA COMMUNIQUE       The LPLA co.:.-unique on Operation Lam Son 719
 ON ALLIED LOSSES      claiming "total victory" in this "historic
 campaign" was released at a press conference
 in Hanoi on the 24th.  Hanoi radio remained on the air throughout
 that night and rebroadcast the communique along with battle
 reports.  And it was featured in special "two-color" issues of
 the Hanoi press on the 25th.  The communique says that the allies
 lost "an important part" of their armed forces and war materials
 including 15,400 troops put out of action, 200 of them Americans,
 and 1,000 others captured,* ":any" of them officers.  The
 communists also claim to have destroyed or captured 496 aircraft
 (mostly helicopters), destroyed or captured 586 military
 vehicles (including 318 tanks and armored cars), destroyed or
 captured 144 heavy artillery pieces, more than 5,000 weapons of
 various kinds, a large quantity of important documents, and
 military equipment.
 Elaborating on the communique's statistics on allied losses,
 the NHAN DAN editorial on the 25th stated that "more than four-
 fifths" of the troops sent into Laos were "exterminated," nearly
 all the military vehicles and artillery pieces lost, and most
 of the brigade- or regiment-size units "annihilated or heavily
 decimated."  The editorial also claimed that the number of
 helicopters destroyed in southern Laos was nearly equal to the
 amount of aircraft mobilized when the operation first began and
 surpassed half the total number of aircraft "mobilized when the
 requirement was at its apex."
 The matter of communist losses in the Laos campaign is predictably
 ignored in the propaganda, but the Chien Binh article on the 22d
 notes that one of the allied objectives was to "attract and
 exterminate" the adversary's troops.  Elaborating, a 29 March
 Pathet Lao radio commentary charges that the allies "hoped to
 deceive the invincible strategic forces of the Indochinese
 countries into gathering on the Highway 9 battlefront so that
 they could use their air forces to put them out of action."
 *  Continuing to exploit ARVN prisoners captured in Laos, the
 communists on 28 March publicize a press conference-the previous
 day, "near the Laos-Vietnam border," featuring ARVN prisoners,
 including Col. Nguyen Van Tho, commander of Saigon's 3d Airborne
 Brigade.  Communist media had broadcast earlier statements
 attributed to Tho and had ridiculed Saigon claims that he had
 not been captured.

 SIGNIFICANCE OF "VICTORY,"     The Chien Binh article is
 IMPACT ON VIETNAMIZATION ebullient in its claims that the
 "defeat" of Operation Lam Son 719
 marks a turning point in the war.  It maintains that "it Is
 obvious that Nixon has sustained a total defeat in a decisive
 strategic battle" and declares that the allies have "entered a
 new phase of decline."  Chien Binh goes so far as to claim at
 one point that the allied "defeat" in Laos is "a strong blow
 to the Nixon clique's aggressive will."  Later he adds that
 there will be "great catastrophes" in the days ahead and, thus,
 "no matter how stubborn Nixon may be, he cannot refuse to change
 his strategy in Vietnam and Indochina."
 Chien Binh declares bluntly that the fundamental allied tactics
 vital to Vietnamization, went bankrupt in Laos, and that the
 most seasoned South Vietamese units were routed.  Deriding
 President Nixon for losing forces which he had carefully built
 up during his term in office, Chien Binh remarks:  "Nixon has
 picked up two years' worth of firewood and burned it in one
 hour."  He maintains that the Saigon army "will never be able
 to get back on its feet after receiving this mortal blow."
 Both the Chien Binh article and the article in the March QUAN
 DOI NHAN DAN magazine by Quyet Thang go on, after stressing the
 impact of the Laos operation on Vietnamization, to point out
 that the South Vietnamese army will be further strained by the
 inevitable withdrawal of more U.S. troops.  Chien Binh remarks
 that the U.S. Administration, following the defeat of the
 Vietnamization program in Laos, is now haunted by the question
 of what  will happen when the South Vietnamese have to fight
 alone.
 Chien Binh's claims for the importance of the Laos campaign
 are echoed in the 25 March NHAN DAN editorial which says that
 the "victory" on Highway 9 is a "major milestone in the history
 of the coordinated fight by the Indochinese peoples."  In a
 possible deliberate mocking of the languag.: of President Thieu's
 8 February announcement of the campaign which noted it was
 "limited in time and space," the paper adds that the "tremendous"
 campaign has an importance which goes beyond the "operation's
 limits in time and space."  According to the editorial:  "The
 U.S. aggressors intended to launch a decisive battle and a test
 of strength with the Indochinese revolutionary forces.  Their
 plan was accepted and they were overwhelmingly crushed in this
 fierce test of strength."

 31 MARCH 1071
 The editorial also claims that the Laos operation has demonstrated
 that the Vietnamization of the war "is doomed to woeful defeat."
 Chiding Nixon for not "learning from the defeats of his
 predecessors," it lists his three "strategic errors" as the
 Vietnamization "scheme" and Nixon Doctrine, the incursion into
 Cambodia, and the "military adventure" on Highway 9.  This
 "new error," according to the editorial, "will lead the
 aggressors to many unforeseen consequences."
 COt+IUNIST ST!ATEGY     Propaganda on the Laos campaign not
 only predictably praises the communist
 forces' leadership in "defeating" the allies but also suggests
 that communists held the initiative and planned the confrontation
 in Laos.  Typical of other comment, the LPLA communique claims
 that the communist "victory" was a victory for their political
 and military line, "talented strategic and operational leadership,"
 and "superior military art."  Like earlier comment on the
 20 March battle in the Ban Dong area, it holds that the allied
 "defeat" came about according to careful plans.  Chien Binh also
 suggests this when he observes that "the U.S.-puppet officers
 have come to realize that the troop movement toward Ban Dong
 was not a success but a quick fall into the enemy trap."  The
 25 March NHAN DAN editorial claims that the "liberation" forces
 "maintained their initiative from the start to the end." and
 "carried out with great precision the strategic design" of block-
 ing the allies at Ban Dong to prevent them from entering Tchepone
 and then dealing then "decisive blows" in Ban Dong.
 The suggestion that the communists trapped the allies into a
 "defeat" in Laos lends new significance to a unique argument
 for such major engagements voiced in Vietnamese propaganda last
 December.  An article by PRG Defense Minister and PLAF Commander
 Tran Nam Trung differed from other propaganda in the previous
 two years by stressing the importance of "big-unit" fighting in
 people's war.*  Tran Nam Trung appeared to be arguing for an
 abandonment of conservative communist tactics and for a return
 to more action by main force units.  He maintained that the
 stepping up of big-unit actions is "required in the development
 of the all-people and comprehensive people's war in order to
 *  The Tran Nam Trung article was first carried by Front media
 on 10 December and by Hanoi media on the 16th; it was discussed
 in the 30 December 1970 TRENDS, pages S 1-3.

 smash the U.S. imperialists' stubborn plots and to crush their
 aggressive will."  Trung did not limit his attention only to
 South Vietnam and even suggested the possibility of a military
 move elsewhere when he stated that the "coordinated offensives"
 in Indochina have "created new offensive forces, new territories
 for offensives, and new abilities for large-scale offensives."
 Trung's call for big-unit engagements was not repeated. in
 subsequent Vietnamese communist propaganda, but there was
 other evidence last year that Hanoi was seeking a new strategy
 in the war and it is possible that the DRV leaders decided,
 in accordance with Trung's argument, to accept a major
 confrontation with the allies if circumstances were deemed
 favorable.
 PEKING BANQUET, MAO MESSAGE CELEBRATE INDOCHINA VICTORIES
 Peking's confident assessment of military developments in
 Indochina, particularly the "rout" of allied forces in southern
 Laos, evolved this week into jubilant celebration of the
 "brilliant victories" throughout Indochina.  This mood of
 jubilation and the complementary belief that victory in "the
 campaign of Highway 9" is an event of "great strategic
 importance to the overall situation" in Indochina were
 expressed in speeches at a "grand victory banquet" in Pelting
 on 26 March and by a message of congratulations on the 29th
 from Mao, Lin Piao, and Chou En-lai to the communist leaders
 in Indochina.
 CHINESE MESSAGE     In the message--addressed to the leaders
 of the Laotian Patriotic Front, the National
 United Front of Cambodia, the South Vietnam National Liberation
 Front and the PRG, and the DRV--Mao, Lin, and Chou extend
 "warmest congratulations" to the "three fraternal peoples of
 Indochina" on their recent battlefield performance, taking
 particular note of the "splendid battle of annihilation" in
 the "campaign of Highway 9."  Characterizing the victory as
 one of "great strategic importance" which puts "the Nixon
 Government in a more difficult position and makes things tougher
 for it," the message contends that "the present situation in
 Indochina is unprecedentedly fine" and that the three Indochinese
 peoples "will certainly overcome all difficulties and win complete
 victory" by persisting in people's war.

 VICTORY BANQUET     Ebullient victory speeches by Chou En-lai,
 Le Duan, the Laotian Patriotic Front's
 Kaysone Phomvihan, the NFLSV's Nguyen Van Hieu, and Sihanouk
 marked the banquet celebrating the "tidings of victory" that
 are "pouring in from the front of resistance against U.S.
 aggression in Indochina."  With particular emphasis on the
 "splendidly fought" battles along Highway 9, the banquet speakers
 claimed that a turning point in the Indochinese struggle-had been
 reached--Chou called it a victory of "great strategic importance"
 creating a "new situation on the entire battlefront in
 Indochina"--proving that people's war can defeat "so-called
 air superiority" and that by coordinating closely with each
 other the forces of the three peoples of Indochina can bring
 about "a thorough defeat of the U.S. aggressors and all their
 running dogs."
 In his speech Chou elaborated on Peking's earlier predictions
 that in the face of the Laotian reversal the United States
 might resort to new measures such as intensified bombing of
 North Vietnam.  Noting the recent bombings and suggesting
 that the Nixon Administration "is even preparing new military
 adventures," Chou added a new warning that during the dry season
 next winter and spring it "will embark on still greater war
 adventures in a last desperate struggle for Nixon's campaign
 for the next presidential elections."  But, Chou contended,
 the United States cannot save itself from its "doomed defeat"
 regardless of the "military adventures" to which it resorts.
 In his banquet speech, Le Duan did not raise the issue of new
 U.S. military adventures or intensified bombing of the north.
 The speakers stressed the united front of the three Indochinese
 peoples and the coordination of the various liberation forces--
 in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam--but placed particular emphasis
 on the "strategic victory" of the "cap*ign,of Highv y 9,"
 generally depicting the forced withdrawal of the Saigon forces
 as a "rout" in order to avoid complete "annihilation."  Kaysone
 Phomvihan alleged that the Nixon Administration undertook the
 Laotian operation "in order to save itself from its defeat,"
 and Nguyen Van Hieu contended that the purpose of the invasion
 was to "obstruct the mutual support and assistance between the
 three Indochinese peoples, destroy the Laotian people's base
 areas for resistance, embellish the South Vietnamese puppet
 forces, and trumpet the so-called victory of the 'Nixon Doctrine.'"
 The speakers all agreed that the "campaign of Highway 9" so lied
 doom for the Nixon Doctrine and the Vietnamization policy.

 Although all contended that the Laotian incursion was a major
 disaster for the United States, only Sihanouk went so far as to
 call it "comparable to the unforgettable and highly historic
 victory of Dien Bien Phu."
 ASIAN UNITY     In addition to celebrating military victories,
 the banquet also served as an occasion for
 welcoming the three Indochinese delegations en route to Moscow
 for the CPSU congress.  Though the DPRK was represented by no
 one higher than its ambassador, Peking turned the occasion into
 a show of Asian communist unity under its auspices, thereby
 flaunting a theme which had emerged following last spring's
 Indochina summit meeting and Chou's visit to Pyongyang.  Chou
 declared at the banquet that the peoples of Vietnam, Laos,
 Cambodia, Korea, and China have "a glorious tradition of unity
 against imperialism" and are now "all confronted with the
 aggression and threats by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys."
 While demonstrating its enhanced role in Asian communist affairs
 in the past year, Peking's treatment of the delegations' stopover
 also reflected its willingness to mute the Sino-Soviet rivalry
 in an Indochina context.  NCNA's reports on the arrival and
 departure of the delegations mention the presence of Soviet
 Ambassador Tolstikov, and the report on their departure notes
 that they left for Moscow.  NCNA's announcement on the arrival
 of Le Duan in Peking on 10 May 1970 did not acknowledge that he
 was returning from Moscow, where he attended the Lenin centennial
 celebrations, but there is a precedent for Peking's acknowledgment
 that a Vietnamese delegation passing through the PRC also had
 Moscow on its itinerary:  NCNA on 21 October 1969 reported that
 Phan Van Dong had arrived in Peking after visiting the Soviet
 Union and the GDR.  During his visit Dong, in a speech in Peking
 duly reported by the Chinese, expressed good wishes for the
 Sino-Soviet talks which had just opened.
 OTHER PEKING     A PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on 28 March, entitled
 COWAENT          "Warm Congratulations on the Spectacular Victory
 on Highway 9," claimed that the results of the
 southern Laos operation represented "not only a tactical but also
 a strategic defeat" that "will surely affect the whole Indochinese
 battlefield in an overall situation."  The editorial supported
 this contention on the ground that the ARVN has been greatly
 weakened, thus helping to "accelerate the bankruptcy" of Vietnamization
 and the Nixon doctrine.

 As in Chou's banquet speech, the editorial addresses itself to
 U.S. presidential politics as a factor in future developments.
 Claiming that the Highway 9 campaign has "aggravated the
 political crisis" of the Nixon Administration, the editorial
 notes that the President staked his political future cn the
 southern Laos operation, hoping to win "an easy victory so
 as to gai. political capital" for the next presidential election.
 Quoting the President as admitting that he faced a credibility
 gap, the editorial said this means more bitter opposition to
 his policy from the American people and "new quarrels and-strife"
 among U.S.  olitical leaders.  An NCNA commentary on the 25th
 took particular note of the President's television interview on
 the 22d, observing that he "once again resorted to the trick of
 lying in a vain attempt to cover up defeats, disclaim his
 criminal responsibility, and continue to deceive the American
 people."
 Another NCNA commentary, on 27 March, was somewhat more specific
 in spelling out the Laotian operation's aim of disrupting
 communist supply routes than was the 23 March PEOPLE'S DAILY
 Commentator article.  Whereas the earlier article attributed
 the incursion to a desire to "occupy southern Laos, cut off
 the close ties among the peoples of the three Indochinese
 countries, and avert their deft,,:; in Indochina," the commentary
 on the 27th notes allied claims that they would occupy Tchepone,
 a "strategic point in lower Laos," and asserts that "they even
 tried to set up a blockade line in the panhandle of lower Laos
 so as to sever the close contacts among the three Indochinese
 peoples."

 BREZI-IVEV IGNORES LAOS OPERATION. MOSCOW SAYS ALLIES "FAILED"
 Brezhnev in his 30 March report to the 24th CPSU Congress
 discussed Indochina only briefly and in general terms.
 Thus, he did not mention the operation in Laos in scoring
 U.S. spread of the war to all the Indochina countries and
 its Vietnamization policy.*  In standard terms, he asserted
 that the Vietnamese resolve to become masters of their own
 country cannot be broken by "direct military intervention,"
 by "sabotaging negotiations," or by "wide employment of
 mercenaries."  He reiterated that the only way to solve
 the Vietnam problem is on the basis of the DRV and PRG
 proposals which the USSR "firmly supports."  Brezhnev
 reaffirmed Soviet "support" for the struggle of "people
 of Vietnam and other countries of Indochina against the
 imperialist interventionists," and to "fraternal support"
 of the DRV in both the "armed struggle" and in "peaceful
 work."
 Moscow's postmortems on the Laos operation echo Vietnamese
 communist propaganda in continuing to count it as a failure
 of the Vietnamization policy.  Foreign-language commentaries
 by Aleksey Leontyev on 27 and 28 March, for example, say
 that Vietnamization cannot "supersede negotiations, but
 will only bring about new adventures similar to the one
 attempted in Laos, which can only prolong the war and will
 never settle any problem."
 Much of the comment centers on the growing "crisis of
 confidence" in the United States in the wake of
 the Laotian "failure" and efforts by U.S. spokesmen,
 including the President in his 22 March TV interview, to
 present the operation as a victory for the GVN troops.
 Some comment, including a 26 March PRAVDA article by
 Strelnikov, asserts that Defense Secretary Laird, in
 his remarks of the 24th to reporters after a hearing on
 Capitol Hill, finally "publicly acknowledged that the
 *  Brezhnev has made no substantial statement on foreign
 policy since November 1970, and it has been left to
 Kosygin, 'i a 10 February speech, and the 25 February
 Soviet Gcvernment statement to denounce the Laotian
 incursion.

 interventionist troops 'have left Laos because of the extreme,
 violent reaction of the enemy."'  Strelnikov notes that the
 "catastrophic failure" of the intervention "aroused a storm
 of critical remarks and caustic commentaries" in the United
 States aimed at the Pentagon and White House.
 TASS on the 26th says that "those senators and congressmen
 who repeatedly spoke against the senseless,-course of
 aggression in Indochina received convincing proof that
 their warnings and misgivings had been justified." Another
 TASS item the same day, commenting in a similar vein, says
 that official Washington claims that the GVN staged an
 "orderly retreat" after accomplishing its mission are
 "ridiculed by all except the most loyal of Pentagon
 apologists."  Concluding that the growing lack of confidence
 in Administration utterances is yet another symptom of the
 desire "shared by a clear majority of the American people
 for a prompt liquidation of the slaughter in Southeast
 Asia," TASS notes that this is manifested in the Democratic
 Party Policy Council's approval of a resolution urging
 Congress to cut off all funds for American operations in
 Indochina after 31 December.
 An IZVESTIYI article by Sagatelyan on the 28th is the only
 known propaganda to repeat the warning in the 25 February
 Soviet Government statement on the Laos operation that U.S.
 actions in Indochina "cannot but affect Soviet-American
 relations."  The IZVESTIYA commentator quotes from a Jack
 Anderson column in the Washington POST to demonstrate
 military pressure on President Nixon to take such extreme
 actions as bombing and mining Haiphong harbor, an action
 which, Anderson noted, would create a threat to Soviet
 ships.*  IZVESTIYA quotes the London DAILY MIRROR as
 saying that the President must not allow his generals to
 convince him that one more "military adventure" will bring
 a decisive success, and that the "defeat" in Laos shows
 that the sooner the Americans withdraw the better.  IZVESTIYA
 concludes that undoubtedly the realism of the British
 editorial was evoked by the Soviet Government statement's
 warning of an adverse effect on Soviet-American relations.
 *  The issue of mining Haiphong harbor has of course rarely
 been broached since the October 1968 bombing halt.  However,
 in April 1969 an &typical routine-level domestic service
 commentary cited the U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT as repo~?ting
 that President Nixon's military advisers recommended the
 resumption of the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

 Some other Moscow comment continues to charge that the
 Americans want to "avenge" their defeats in Laos by bombing
 the DRV, and there are low-level references to the
 possibility of expanded aggression against the DRV.
 A foreign- language commentary by Soltan on 25 March,
 for example, reiterates that in Saigon and Washington
 "one hears threats of open invasion of the territory"
 of the DRV.  Soltan warns that the Americans must not
 assume that the Indochinese countries cannot stage any
 serious resistance, going on to point to Soviet aid to
 Vietnam.  From 25 to 27 March Moscow media report low
 level meetings held in various parts of the Soviet Union
 protesting the 21-22 March air raids on the DRV and
 expressing approval of the Soviet Government's policy of
 aiding Vietnam.
 DRV. PRG SCORE UPS1 "ACTS OF WAR." "THREATS" AGAINST NORTH
 In the wake of the 21-22 March U.S. strikes against the DRV,
 Hanoi and the Front continue to warn of U.S. "adventures"
 against the DRV, albeit with less frequency than in recent
 weeks.  Vietnamese communist media have not carried Xuan
 Thuy's remarks to this effect in a speech in Paris
 commemorating the first anniversary of Sihanouk's Front.
 But such warnings do appear in the 24 March DRV War Crimes
 Commission "special communique"--publicized on the 26th--
 which documents "the most recent war acts" against the
 DRV, and in a NHAN DAN editorial on the 27th.  The war
 communique says that the North Vietnamese along with
 their Indochinese allies "are ready to smash all
 new military adventures" of the United States.  The
 editorial in a now-routine affirmation of heightened
 vigilance says that "we are determined to destroy all
 U.S.-puppet forces that dare to encroach upon the North
 either from the air, the sea, or land." Xuan Thuy had
 used a similar formulation in his speech.  (In the wake
 of the operation into Laos, Hanoi had stressed the
 buildup of allied forces near the DMZ and increased
 U.S. naval activity in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as air
 "provocations" against the DRV.)

 Le Duan speaking at the 26 March banquet in Peking did not raise
 the question of a threat to the DRV, although Chou En-lai speak-
 ing on the same occasion did so.  Le Duan after hailing the
 "strategic victory" of the communist forces in Laos stopped with
 the assertion that "no matter what schemes and maneuvers the
 U.S. imperialists may resort to" the Vietnamese people are
 determined to "strictly continue and to step up their struggle
 against the U.S. aggression until total victory."
 PROTEST OF      Hanoi on 31 March issues its first DRV Foreign
 DMZ STRIKES     Ministry spokesman's statement--protesting U.S.
 actions against the demilitarized zone and
 Quang Binh Province--since the 22 March Foreign Ministry state-
 ment scoring the concentrated 21-22 March U.S. strikes against
 the DRV.  The statement protests action on the 29th and 30th,
 and the strikes on the 30th are apparently those which U.S.
 spokesmen described as being in response to the DRV's moving of
 artillery into the northern part of the DMZ.  But, Hanoi, of
 course, handles them as part of what it claims is continuous
 bombing of the DMZ.  Since the first of this year, Hanoi had
 issued 19 foreign ministry spokesman's protests scoring U.S.
 actions against North Vietnam of which 12 have accused the
 United States of bombing and artillery action in the northern
 part of the demilitarized zone, territory which Hanoi claims
 belongs to the DRV.
 The current protest, similar to the 12 others this year
 cryptically charges that on the 29th and 30th,U.S. aircraft
 "repeatedly dropped demolition and steel pellet bombs over Huong
 Lap village and launched artillery attacks from positions south
 of the demilitarized zone against many villages situated north
 of the 17th parallel inside the DMZ."  It emphasized that "these
 villages belong to the territory of the DRV."
 The protest also charged that on the 28th, U.S. planes "bombed
 and strafed a certain number of localities of Quang Binh Province."
 In routine fashion, the protest "strongly denounced and sternly
 condemned the above acts of war" and demanded an immediate end
 to all actions violating the DRV?'s sovereignty and security.

 LUANG PRABANG INCIDENT NOTED, LAO PRINCES' CONTACTS CONTINUE
 The 21-22 March firing of rockets at Luang Prabang airfield by
 the "armed forces and people of Luang Prabang Province" was
 belatedly mentioned jii a brief Pathet Lao radio report on the
 25th, subsequently also carried by VNA and LPA.  Communist media
 have offered no followup comment, and have also predictably
 ignored another demarche on the incident by Khamphan Panya,
 the Prime Minister's representative, with the British and Soviet
 ambassadors.  On 25 March the Vientiane domestic service reported
 that Khamphan Panya had informed the ambassadors of a Souvanna
 Phouma message to the two governments concerning the "serious
 matter" of the attack on the airport and requesting that the
 governments "take urgent measures as stated in the Geneva agree-
 ments."  Communist media had similarly failed to report Khamphan
 Panya's earlier 22 March request that the two ambassadors notify
 their governments of the extreme seriousness of the Luang Prabang
 incident so the latter could take action in accordance with the
 Geneva agreements.
 0
 A Hanoi domestic service commentary on 30 March did, however,
 display sensitivity over an interview Souvanna Phouma gave to
 AFP on the 25th in which he said that the only explanation for
 the attack on the airport was a North Vietnamese desire "to
 control Luang Prabang and possibly seize King Savang Vatthana."
 The Hanoi commentary protested that Souvanna Phouma once again
 "slandered North Vietnam as being an aggressor in Laos," and
 "distorted the DRV Government's policy toward the Laotian King,"
 but did not mention the Luang Prabang bombardment.  It recalled
 that the NLHS five-point statement "clearly pointed out that it
 respects the royal throne," adding that the DRV has always
 supported the "proper stand" of the NLHS.
 CONTACTS             In his AFP interview, Souvanna Phouma revealed
 BETWEEN PRINCES      that he had received a message from Souphanouvong
 rejecting his previously unpublicized proposal
 that the two princes meet in Luang Prabang without any preconditions,
 an offer Souvanna said he made on 6 March.  According to Souvanna
 Phouma, Souphanouvong once again demanded cessation of "all
 bombings" and withdrawal of all Thai and U.S. forces, but again
 failed to mention the presence of DRV troops.
 On 21 January, at a meeting with Souphanouvong's special envoy
 Tiao Souk Vongsak, Souvanna Phouma had proposed that the long-
 sought plenipotentiaries' meeting be held in Luang Prabang

 "because agreement  could not be reached on the Khang Khay
 site"--a site which Souvanna had proposed on 25 June. Souvanna
 sent two subsequent messages to Souphanouvong--on 11 February
 c., d 1 March--repeating his proposal that talks be held in Luang
 rrabang.
 On 28 March the Pathet Lao news agency reports that Souphanouvong
 sent Souvanna Phouma a message in reply to the latter's two
 messages of 11 February and 1 March.   (This is presumably not
 the same message discussed by Souvanna Phouma in his AFP inter-
 view.)  The message denounces Souvanna Phouma for "colluding"
 with Saigon in the military operation in southern Laos and for
 "ignoring" NLHS "concessions" regarding the plenipotentiaries'
 meeting in Khang Khay, but it does not explicitly reject the
 notion of a meeting in Luang Prabang.  It repeats demands that
 the United States "cease its bombing of Laotian territory" and
 withdraw all U.S., Saigon, and Thai troops, asserting that while
 the troops remain there can be no basis for a peaceful settlement
 "wherever the meeting between Laotian parties may take place,
 including Luang Prabang as you proposed."

 CPSU CONGRESS
 BREZHNEV DELIVERS CENTRAL COWIMITTEE REPORT ON FIRST DAY
 The congress convened on 30 March with Brezhnev delivering the
 Central Committee report to a gathering which included representa-
 tives of 101 foreign communist and noncommunist parties.
 Preceding Brezhnev's report, Podgornyy welcomed the foreign
 party delegations by name, including a roster of nonruling
 communist parties about the same in number--though not in
 composition--as that attending the last CPSU congress in 1966.
 The Chinese and Albanians are absent, as was the case in 1966.
 TANYUG on 26 March said the Chinese "were not even invited" to
 the congress, but the same source on the 29th said the Chinese
 and Albanian parties "have not replied" to invitations.  These
 parties refused bids to the 23d Congress in 1966.  As in 1966,
 Brezhnev did not note the absence of these two parties in his
 remarks on CPSU relations with these and other ruling communist
 parties.
 JAPAN CP     The Japan Communist Party, absent from the 1966
 CPSU congress as well as from the Moscow inter-
 national party conference in 1969, is represented at the
 present congress by a three-member delegation headed by Tomio
 Nishizawa, a member of the Presidium.  On the eve of the
 delegation's departure for Moscow, AKAHATA on the 27th carried
 an interview with Miyanoto in which the JCP chairman based his
 party's acceptance of the congress invitation on "the Soviet
 side's essential assurances," in recent bilai;eral talks,
 "against interference in our internal affairs and against
 contacting anti-party elements."  He prefaced this statement
 with the remark that there are still differences between the
 two parties "on a variety of problems such as, for instance,
 the Czechoslovak issue and the Kuriles problem, which seem to
 be in no way ready for immediate reconciliation."
 OTHER ASIAN        As in 1966, the Vietnamese Workers Party
 REPRESENTATION     is represented by First Secretary Le Duan,
 who repeated his procedure of 5 years ago
 by stopping in Peking before continuing on to Moscow.  This
 year, NCNA on 27 March reported that Le Duan "left here by air
 for Moscow" that morning--in contrast to an NCNA report on
 27 March 1966 which said the VWP leader had been on a "friendly"
 visit in Peking but gave no indication that he had continued on
 to Moscow.

 The North Korean party delegation, which had been headed in 1966
 by the aging President and Central Committee Vice Chairman Choe
 Yong-kon, is headed at the present CPSU congress by KWP Politburo
 member and secre';ary Kim Ili:' As it did in 1966, the Korean
 delegation evidently went di3.ectly to Moscow without visiting
 Peking.
 The NFLSV, represented at a higher level this year than in 1966,
 is led by Nguyen Van Hieu, identified as a member of the Front
 Presidium.  The NFLSV delegation in 1966 was led by Mme. Nguyen
 Thi Binh in her capacity at that time as Front Central Committee
 member.
 The Pathet Lao has sent a delegation to the CPSU congress for the
 first time. The group is headed by a deputy chairman of the NLHS
 Central Committee, Kaysone Phoumvihane, who has also previously
 been identified with the clandestine Lao People - Party.
 EUROPEAN RULING     As at the last CPSU congress, Moscow's Warsaw
 PARTIES, CUB4       Pact allies are represented by their party
 first secretaries.  These delegations also
 include chiefs of state and premiers in all cases except Romania,
 whose premier, Maurer, is absent--possibly because of his slow
 recovery from injuries from an automobile accident last year.
 The Yugoslav party delegation, headed in 3.966 by Rankovic--
 subsequently purged--is headed this year by Todorovic, a member
 of the Executive Bureau of the Presidential Council of the LCY.
 The Cuban delegation headed by President Dorticos is higher
 ranking than in 1966, when it was headed by party Secretary
 Armando Hart.
 NONRULING CP'S     The sizeable array of first secretaries from
 nonruling communist parties does not include
 those from the French and Italian CP's, whose chief delegates
 are deputy general secretaries Marchais and Berlinguer, respectively.
 Opening the congress, Podgornyy said there were "101 delegations"
 from "90 countries," but greeted by name only some 72 ruling and
 nonruling communist parties and 22 "national democratic" parties,
 with the remainder presumably included in his category of "other
 parties."  In addition to the Japan CP, communist parties named
 as present at this congress, but not at the 1966 congress, are
 those of the Dominican Republic, East Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Guyana,
 the new West German Communist Party (DIe), and the Socialist Unity
 Party of New Zealand--recognized by Moscow since the last CPSU
 congress, in place of the pro-Peking New Zealand CP.  Identified as
 present in 1966, but not at the present congress, were the CP's of
 Iceland, the Netherlands, Morocco, Basutoland, Nepal, and "the
 Algerian communists."                        .

 EAST-WEST RELATIONS: STRESS ON SOVIET ROLE IN WORLD PEACE
 Brezhnev in orthodox fashion contrasts the aggressive policy
 of imperialism with the Soviet policy "of the active defense
 of peace and the strengthening of international security."
 In outlining the aims of Soviet foreign policy--which he
 says were formulated at the 23d Congress in March-April
 1966--he reaffirms Moscow's pursuit of a peaceful coexistence
 policy, a pulicy of "rebuffing the aggressive imperialist
 forces," and one striving to save mankind from e. new world
 war.  And he says that the world socialist system is making
 "a tremendous contribution to solving the vitally important
 task" of preventing a new world war.  But he does not take
 the occasion to restate the doctrine on the preventability
 of a world war,* perhaps because of its close identification
 with Khrushchev.  At the 23d CPSU Congress, Brezhnev had
 approached the question in more doctrinal terms, saying that
 "it is our deep conviction that the conclusion of the
 international communist movement that the aggressor car.
 be curbed and another world war averted remains valid."
 Implicit in Brezhnev's stress on maintaining world peace
 is the need to settle outstanding disputes by negotiaticns,
 but he again does not discuss this in doctrinal terms.  Thus,
 there is no echo of his explicit assertion in the congress
 in 1966 that the Soviet Union advocates a settlement of
 outstanding issues by negotiations.
 U.S.-SOVIET    In his attack on U.S. policy, Brezhnev says
 RELATIONS      that the "main crime of the.modern colonialists"
 is the continuing "aggression" in Indochina.
 And he is graphic in his description of the operations of the
 "interventionists" there, noting that "tons of napalm" have
 been used and that nearly 1.5 million Vietnamese have been
 poisoned by chemical weapons.  Brezhnev does not, however,
 declare--as did the 25 February Soviet Government statement on
 the Laos incursion--that operations iii Indochina could
 adversely affect U.S.-Soviet relations.
 *  The thesis on preventability of war has been repeated only
 infrequently in elite statements since 1966.  The main.document
 on the June 1969 international party conference had stated that
 a new world war can be averted through a joint struggle of
 peaceloving peoples; and the conference's "Appeal in the
 Defense of Peace" had said that this joint struggle "can do
 away with the fatal inevitability of a new world war."

 Improved relations between the United States and the USSR,
 Brezhnev says, are both. desirable and possible.  But he
 observes that "we cannot pass by the U.S. aggressive actions
 in various parts of the world."  He questions U.S. sincerity
 "at the conference table."  And he complains that the United
 States has "hardened its position" on a number of international
 issues, "including those which touch on the interests of the
 Soviet Union"; that it has engaged in "frequent zigzags";
 and that it has sought to resurrect "the myth of the Soviet
 threat."  Brezhnev declares that the USSR threatens no one
 and has no territorial claims, concluding that "no one [should]
 talk with us In the language of ultimatums and strength."
 STRATEGIC ARMS       In his remarks on disarmament--which he
 LIMITATION TALKS     says remains "one of the most important
 international problems"--Brezhnev briefly
 touches on the current strategic arms limitation talks.  In
 the first elite remarks on the talks since Kosygin's nn
 11 February at the seabed treaty signing, Brezhnev observes
 that their favorable outcome would help to curtail another
 round in the arms race and would allow the diversion of
 resources to more creative purposes.  The USSR for its
 part, he declares, is seeking to insure that they will
 have positive results.  But in the vein of the 3 February
 Shestov article in PRAV'JA, he warns that no talks on
 disarmament "can be productive unless the interests of
 the security of the parties are considered equally and
 no one seeks unilateral advantage."

 DISARMAMENT:  PARTIAL MEASURES LISTED, CONFERENCES ENDORSED
 In a notable departure from the format of his 1966 speech, Brezhnev
 ticks off the "main concrete tasks" of the USSR and other peace-
 loving states in their pursuit of peace--tasks which range from the
 liquidation of "hotbeds of war" in Southeast Asia and the Middle
 East, through insuring collective security in Europe and implement-
 ing various disarmament measures, to international cooperation on
 environmental problems.
 In the course of listing various disarmament measures, Brezhnev
 says that the USSR favors nuclear disarmament "by all states that
 have nuclear weapons, and are for convening to this end a
 conference of the five nuclear powers--the Soviet Union, the
 United States, the PRC, France, and Britain."  Moscow in 1965
 had endorsed a French proposal along this line; most recently,
 the 13 October 1970 Soviet-French communique following Pompidou's
 visit to the USSR said that both sides "confirmed their com,non
 conviction that the great powers having at their disposal nuclear
 weapons should get together to discuss the questions of disarma-
 ment in this field."  Moscow's domestic service on the 30th
 reports without comment that the British Government in a state-
 ment has indicated that it will seriously study the Soviet proposal
 for five-power talks; the broadcast adds that, according to
 REUTER, the proposal has attracted the attention of the participants
 at the Geneva disarmament talks.
 Brezhnev follows his remarks on a five-power conference with the
 observation that the USSR favors the convening of a worldwide
 conference "to examine every aspect of the disarmament question."
 The proposal for a world disarmament conference--surfaced at the
 October 1964 Cairo Nonalined Conference--was endorsed by Gromyko
 in his December 1964 UNGA address and was hailed with regularity
 in Soviet propaganda through the end of 1965, when the General
 Assembly unanimously approved it.  Since then the proposal has
 been broached only infrequently by Moscow, and not at all since
 February 1967, when the UK-USSR joint communique on Kosygin's visit
 to Britain noted that both sides were ready to attend such a
 conference.
 Brezhnev repeats the USSR's familiar call for treaties prohibit-
 ing nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological weapons, the banning
 of underground nuclear tests, the creation of nuclear-free zones
 "in various parts of the world," and the liquidation of foreign
 military bases.  Additionally, he urges that measures be taken to

 114-6
 reduce the likelihood of "accidental occurrence or premeditated
 fabrication of military incidents and their development into
 international crises and war."  Brezhnev's list is the first
 such comprehensive list to appear in Moscow propaganda since the
 1 July 1968 Soviet memorandum on disarmament.  The 1968 memoran-
 dum did not include the proposal for a nuclear-free zone--which
 does, however, appear with some regularity in both elite and
 routine comment.
 In listing disarmament measures Brezhnev also includes a reduc-
 tion of armed forces and armaments "in areas where armed confron-
 tation is especially dangerous, primarily in central Europe."
 While a variation of this proposal was part of the comprehensive
 partial disarmament program set forth in a December 1964 Soviet
 Government memorandum, it subsequently has normally been discussed
 in the context of European security (and it was not included in
 the July 1968 disarmament memorandum).  In a recent example, the
 26 June 1970 memorandum )f the Warsaw Pact foreign ministers'
 conference in Budapest observed that reduction of foreign armed
 forces on the territory of European states would promote security
 in Europe.
 Brezhnev ressurects another partial disarmament measure that had
 been mentioned in the December 1964 memorandum--reduction of
 military expenditures, "primarily by major states."  This mea-
 sure was last mentioned at the elite level by Gromyko in his
 27 June 1968 Supreme Soviet speech, when he complained that in
 the past the Western powers have rejected this and other Soviet-
 sponsored disarmament measures.
 EUROPEAN ISSUES:  RENEWED CALL FOR SECURITY CONFERENCE
 In his rundown of the main tasks facing the peace-loving nations,
 Brezhnev repeats the call for the convening of a conference on.
 European security.  Elsewhere in his address, he noted that the
 "majority of European states" have come out in favor of the pro-
 posal for a conference, and that preparations for it are moving
 along.  But he does not take the occasion to mention the
 25 November 1970 Finnish proposal--to which Moscow had responded
 favorably--that heads of missions or other representatives in
 Helsinki hold consultations both with the Finnish Foreign
 Ministry and at multila4,eral meetings on the organization of a
 conference.

 Brezhnev reaffirms the readiness of the member states of the
 Warsaw Pact simultaneously to liquidate that alliance and NATO
 or, "as a first step, to liquidate the military organizations"
 of the two groupings.  This proposal, which dates back to 1966
 when it was included in the Bucharest declaration on European
 security, has been broached in elite Soviet propaganda only
 infrequently in recent years.  Most recently, the 17 June 1969
 main document of the Moscow world communist conference had
 called for simultaneous dissolution of the two blocs.  But
 the document said nothing about the liquidation of their mili-
 tary organizations as a first step.
 In reviewing the situation in Europe, Brezhnev hails the posi-
 tive effect of Soviet-French relations, and he points to the
 "substantial shift" in the USSR's relations with the FRG.
 Regarding the ratification of the FRG's treaties with the
 USSR and Poland, Brezhnev says that there is a "sharp demarca-
 tion of political forces."  He observes that "one must believe
 that realistically-minded circles in Bonn and certain other
 Western countries and capitals understand the simple truth:
 Delay of ratification would give rise to a new crisis of confi-
 dence in the whole FRG policy, and the political climate in
 Europe would deteriorG.`-e, as would the prospects of lessening
 international tension."
 On Berlin, Brezhnev says that if the United States, France, and
 the United Kingdom will respect, as the USSR does, "allied agree-
 ments which determine the special status of West Berlin," and if
 they respect "the sovereign rights of the GDR as an independent
 socialist state, the talks which are now being conducted can be
 successfully concluded to the mutual advantage of all interested
 parties, including the population of West Berlin itself."  Lte
 phraseology differs somewhat from that which Brezhnev used in his
 29 November 1970 speech in Yerevan, his last discussion of the
 Berl-n problem.  He said then that it was quite feasible to reach
 an agreement regarding West Berlin, "the only thing needed" being
 "for all sides concerned to display good will and to work out
 decisions that would meet the wishes of the West Berlin population
 and take into account the legitimate interests and sovereign rights
 of the GDR."  By now calling for the Big Three to respect both
 "the special status of West Berlin" and "the sovereign rights of
 the GDR as an independent socialist state," Brezhnev appears to be
 laying down more stringent preconditions for a settlement.

 MIDDLE EAST;  USSR ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL. GUARANTEES FOR AREA
 Brezhnev's brief remarks on the situation in the Middle East  -on-
 tain the usual call for a political settlement, praise for the UAR
 for accepting UN special representative Jarring's proposals, and
 indictment of both Israel and the United States for allegedly
 blocking settlement.  Most notably, Brezhnev's remarks represent
 the first elite affirmation of Soviet readiness "to take part with
 other powers who are permament members of the Security Council in
 creating international guarantees for a political settlement' in the
 Middle East."  Prior to Brezhnev's speech, there had been passing
 references to the issue of international guarantees and an interna-
 tional peacekeeping force, Moscow only indirectly suggesting
 support by indicating, Egyptian acceptance and Israeli objections.
 Brezhnev takes note of the fact that the UAR has "proposed to
 undertake measures for the resumption in the nearest future of
 navigation on the Suez Canal'..."  A foreign-language commentary by
 Glazunov on the 25th, reporting on UAR President Anwar as-Sadat's
 recent interview on French television, had also broached the
 matter of navigation through the canal.  The commentary said that
 as-Sadat has indicated that "the Suez Canal could be reopened to
 foreign a ips if Israeli armed forces are partially withdrawn
 from the ''inai Peninsula; the UAR considers this the first step"
 toward imp-Lamentation of the 1967 Security Council resolution.
 Brezhnev concludes that after a political settlement it would be
 possible:'. to consider further steps aimed at reducing tension
 in the region, "in particular, at turning the Mediterranean Sea
 into a sea of peace and friendly cooperation."

 USSR-EAST EUROPE REUI'iONS: INTEGRATION, COORDINATION STRESSED
 As part of Moscow's effort to preserve the facade of a unitod
 community and to discourage outside efforts to penetrate its East
 European sphere, Brezhnev underlined "the close and diverse
 cooperation, friendship, and cordiality" that pervadeslbscow's rela-
 tions with "the Warsaw Treaty countries--Bulgaria, Hungary, the GDR,
 Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia."  In his more general
 comments on socialist construction in the world movement
 Brezhnev acknowledged the need for a "correct" combination of
 "general regularities" and "national specifics"; but in regard
 to relations with his East European allies, he made it clear
 that national policies must evolve within the disciplined
 framework of the Warsaw Pact and CEMA.  Thus, after
 acknowledging that "the possibilities for the socialist
 division of labor are not yet being fully used," he called
 for economic integration of the bloc and laid particular
 emphasis on the "coordinating foreign policy function" of
 the Warsaw Pact.  These are serious areas of disagreement
 with the Romanians, who continue to oppose bloc integration
 and to insist on maintaining an independent foreign policy
 course.
 Soviet displeasure with Romania, among others, seemed to be
 reflected in a general passage by Brezhnev attacking
 "negative phenomena" in the communist movement and calling
 for a manifold struggle against "right and 'left-wing'
 revisionism, and against nationalism."  He added:  "It is
 precisely the nationalistic tendencies, especially those
 which assume the form of anti-Sovietism, that bourgeois
 ideologists and bourgeois propaganda have most willingly
 relied upon in their fight against socialism and the
 communist movement."
 Briefly touching on relations with the maverick Albanians,
 Brezhnev reiterated the line that the USSR is prepared to
 "normalize" relations with Albania; but the avowal came
 directly after his assault on Tirana's Peking ally for
 following an anti-Soviet line in its propaganda and
 policy.  This expression of Soviet willingness to improve
 relations with its ideological enemy is apparently designed
 to portray Moscow as the innocent party in the dispute and
 to put the onus on Tirana for disrupting communist unity.

 Turning to relations with another ideological adversary,
 Brezhnev vaguely noted that relations with Yugoslavia "have
 continued to develop."  He added that "the Soviet people
 want to see socialism in Yugoslavia strengthened and her
 ties with the socialist community grow stronger   sentiment i
 that the Yugoslavs might find presumptuous.  Despite such
 reservation: about Yugoslav socialism, however, Brezhnev
 made it clear that he would like -to improve party and
 state relations by calling for Soviet-Yugoslav cooperation
 and developing contacts between the CPSU and the LCY.
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA,    Brezhnev updated the Soviet rationale for
 POLAND             the intervention in Czechoslovakia and
 touched in general terms on the developments
 in Poland since December.  While his remarks on Czechoslovakia
 are explicit and fairly extensive, his brief discussion of
 Poland amoui:ts only to a grud.?;ing Soviet acknowledgment that
 "difficulties" had arisen in that country.  Brezhnev declared,
 in obvious response to conjectures on this score, that Soviet
 friendship with Poland "is unshakeable" and registered
 Moscow's "deep satisfaction that the difficulties which
 arose in fraternal Poland have been overcome."  Without
 referring directly to either the coastal riots or the
 economic troubles which had sparked them, Brezhnev
 approvingly noted the Polish party's current meap.4res to
 strengthen its ties wi.th the workers and to "consolidate
 the positions of socialism" in that country.
 On the subject of Czechoslovakia, Brezhnev provided an
 explicit Soviet endorsement of the position taken by a
 December 1970 UPCZ plenum document--belatedly released in
 January 1971--that the August 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
 was in response to "appeals" by the Czechoslt. ?eks
 themselves.  Following a lengthy defensive explanation
 that the "counterrevolutionary" threw endangered not
 only Czechoslovakia but "the positions of socialism in
 Europe as a whole," Brezhnev declared that "in view of
 the appeals by party and state leaders, communists and
 working people of Czechoslovakia" and the danger to socialist
 gains in that country, "we and the fraternal socialist
 countries. jointly took the decision to render internationalist
 assistance to Czechoslovakia in defense of socialism."  He
 added that "we agree with the conclusion" drawn by the
 CPCZ plenum document.

 may have indicated partial disagreement with the compromise
 nupcrt of the C.PCZ document:  Ile referred to the document
 only au "Lessons of the Crisis Development" without Giving
 the rest of the title--including "following the 13th
 Congress" of the CPCZ in 1966.  Husak had apparently been
 allowed, in the document, to indict the Novotny era--not
 dust the ,post-January 1968 Dubcek era--for the 1968 crisis,
 in return for the document's statement that the August
 lnvaaion had been carried out at the Czechoslovaks' own
 request.
 SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS!  PRC'S HOSTILITY SAID TO IMPEDE UNITY
 In the most critical Soviet elite comment on China since
 leaders' election speeches last June, Brezhnev used the
 congress as a forum to deplore persisting Chinese hostility
 in the face of Soviet efforts aimed at normalizing relations.
 He noted that "useful steps" had been taken at Soviet
 initiative to normalize relations, citing the border talks,
 the exchange of ambassadors, and the signing of a trade
 agreement for the first time in several years.  But while
 professing Moscow's readiness to proceed further in this
 direction, Brezhnev declared that the Soviets cannot ignore
 Peking's anti.-Soviet line and denounced Peking's "slanderous
 fabrications" concerning Soviet policy.
 Against the background of Peking's recent ideological
 broadside on the centenary of the Paris Commune, Brezhnev
 made a play to the international communist gallery by
 remarking -t,hat to sow dissension between-the PRC and the
 Soviet Union is particularly harmful now. inasmuch as. it
 coincides with an intensification.of.imperialist'aggression.
 He claimed that the situation "more than ever-before"
 demands unity and joint action rather than hostility
 between China and the Soviet Union.  Respecting the
 Vietnamese communists' avursion to being caught in the
 Sino-Soviet crossfire, Brezhnev did not mention Indochina
 directly in this context.

 Brezhnev's report provided a brief review of Moscow's China
 policy in the post-Khrushehev period.  He observed that Peking
 had followed an ideological and political line incompatible
 with Leninism and had demanded that the Soviets repudiate
 the line of the 20th CPSU Congress and the party program.  He
 also took this occasion to refer to Peking's territorial
 claims against the Soviet Union and to the 1969 border
 clashes, a subject which the Soviet leaders have carefully
 avoided since the opening of the Peking talks.  Seeking to
 show that Moscow had taken a balanced and responsible
 approach to Sino-Soviet tensions, Brezhnev claimed that
 the Soviets had rebuffed attempts to distort Marxism-Leninism
 and to divide communist ranks while maintaining restraint
 and "not yielding to provocations" in the interest of
 normalizing relations.  He gave no hint of the existence
 of current tensions along the border.
 As in his 28 August 1970 Alma-Ata speech, which had served
 as the basic text for the Soviet line on China, Brezhnev
 characterized the Peking talks as "going slowly."  He added
 an implicit criticism of the Chinese approach to the talks
 by observing that not only one side must take a constructi?re
 position if they are to be successful.  Brezhnev repeated
 the assurances in his Alma-Ata speech that the Soviets will
 not forsake their national interests and will continue to
 struggle for cohesion in the communist movement, and he
 reiterated his appeal for not only normalization of state
 relations but also the restoration of "good neighborliness
 and friendship" between the PRC and the Soviet Union.
 Curiously, in view of his censure of the Chinese for
 impeding joint action, he omitted the remainder of his
 appeal in Alma-Ata calling for unity of effort against
 imperialism.
 Taking another swipe at the Chinese, in a passage discussing
 the international communist movement, Brezhnev noted that
 during the period since the last CPSU congress Peking had
 sought to form schismatic groups in an effort to develop
 a counterweight to Moscow's wing of the world movement.
 He lauded the June 1969 Moscow international communist
 conference, at which Brezhnev led a bandwagon attack by
 pro-Soviet loyalists against the Chinese, and he suggested
 that conferences of this sort become a regular. -practice.
 Characteristically, Brezhnev expressed concern over the
 threat to Soviet hegemony posed by nationalist trends and
 the attrr.ctions of an independent stand in the communist
 movemez .

 EAST EUROPE    Prior to the congress Moscow had responded to
 COMMENT        Peking's ideological blast on the Paris Commune
 centenary largely through the proxy of its
 East European a]1ies, apart from an extensive flow of polemical
 reaction in Radio Moscow's broadcasts to the Chinese.  While
 Romania remained silent, the other members of the Soviet bloc
 came to the defense of their chief standard-bearer in comment
 appearing in both East European and Soviet media.  Most
 notably, Polish party chief Gierek, in an article in the
 29 March PRAVDA on the eve of the congress, picked up where
 the fallen Gomulka had left off in professing fealty to
 Moscow as the center of the communist movement.  Serving
 notice that the changes in the Polish leadership offered
 no opportunities for driving a wedge     ''en Warsaw and
 Moscow, Gierek declared that solidar       :: the CPSP?
 continues to be the most accurate tet      oyalty to
 proletarian internationalism and that     .,verahelming
 majority of the fraternal parties, inc    ing his own,

 solidarity with the Soviets.
 East European comment has spelled out the charge--hinted
 at in Brezhnev's congress report--that Peking's attack
 damaged the communist cause by taking place at a time
 of intensified enemy action in Indochina.  A NEUES
 DEUTSCHLAND editorial, summarized in PRAVDA on 29 March,
 severely condemned "the Mao Tse-tung group"--an offensive
 formulation generally avoided by Moscow in its own name
 in recent months--for directing its attack on Moscow
 instead of joining with the Soviet Union and other
 socialist countries at a time of military operations
 in Laos.  PRAVDA did, however, edit its overzealous ally
 by omitting a passage in which NEUES DEUTSCHLAND recalled
 that the Sino-Soviet border clashes in the spring of 1969
 coincided with tensions arising from the FRG presidential
 election in West Berlin.

 SINO-BURMESE RELATIONS
 PRC APPOINTS AMBASSADOR, IGNORES BCP INSURGENCY ANNIVERSARY
 Peking's failure to take note of the 23d anniversary of the launch-
 ing of the communist insurgency in Burma, coming in the wake of the
 recent arrival in Rangoon of the newly appointed PRC ambassador to
 Burma, Chen Chao-yuan, accords with other recent indications of
 Peking's intent to improve state relations with the Ne Win govern-
 ment.  Since last September Peking has virtually ceased propaganda
 support for the Burmese Communist Party (BCP); and since then its
 sparse treatment of Burma has consisted primarily of brief NCNA
 reports on state or diplomatic functions.
 BCP ANNIVERSARY     Peking media's omission of any comment on the
 23d anniversary on March 28 of the launching
 of the communist insurgency in Burma stands in contrast to Peking's
 publicity for that anniversary in 1970, which, in turn, reflected
 a notably milder attitude toward the Ne Win government than the
 harsher attacks on the same occasion in 1969.*  In 1970 Peking
 marked the 22d anniversary with several NCNA articles detailing
 battle actions of the BCP-led insurgents, tempering recollections
 of "outstanding achievements" with warnings that the Burmese
 revolutionaries "will encounter various difficulties" and must
 "continue to display the spirit of waging hard and protracted
 struggle and persevere in their armed struggle under the leader-
 ship of the BCP,:"  NCNA also disseminated reports of foreign
 communist support to the Burmese insurgents--for instance, from
 the Albanians and the communist parties of Thailand and Malaysia--
 but avoided implying any aid for the BCP by the PRC itself and
 omitted any direct expression of Chinese support for its armed
 struggle.
 STATE          Although Rangoon appointed U Thein Maung as
 RELATIONS      Ambassador to the PRC in mid-October 1970 and NCNA
 announced his arrival in Peking, presentation of
 credentials, and meeting with Chou En-lai in late November and
 early December, Peking did not reciprocate until recently.  NCNA
 on 21 March announced that Ambassador to Burma Chen Chao-yuan had
 departed that day for his post.

 Burma during 1969--for instance that surrounding the 1969 anniver-
 sary of the Burmese communist insurgency--employed hostile
 personal attacks on Ne Win, such as "the Ne Win fascist regime"
 and the "Ne Win clique."  By late 1969 Peking had moderated its
 formulations, referring to the "reactionary government," and
 during 1970 this had been softened in Peking-originated comment
 to "Burmese reactionaries," with no direct criticism of Ne Win
 or his government.
 Reflecting a further normalization of PRC-Burmese state relations,
 NCNA on 4 October 1970 reported a greetings telegram from Ne Win
 to Chou En-lai on the occasion of the PRC's 21st anniversary; and
 a January 4 reception in Peking, given by the Burmese Ambassador
 to the PRC and reported by NCNA, was attended by Kuo Mo-jo and
 Pai Hsiang-kuo, the Minister of Foreign Trade.
 SUPPORT FOR        Concurrently with the normalizing of Burmese-
 BCP INSURGENCY                              PRC state relations, Peking media have
 virtually ceased giving any propaganda support
 to the BCP's armed insurgency activities.  Since the comment
 surrounding the 28 March 1970 insurgency anniversary, Peking has
 originated only three commentaries--one each in June, August, and
 September--on the exploits of the BCP-led Burmese people's
 revolutionary armed struggle.  During this period Peking has
 also reported BCP messages and statements on the occasions of the
 Lenin centenary and the Chinese satellite launching in April 1970,
 Mao's 20 May 1970 statement on Indochina, and the 3 March
 satellite launching.  In contrast to Peking's acknowledgment
 of Ne Win's message on the PRC's national day last 1 October, it
 did not mention any message of greetings from the BCP as it had
 customarily done in previous years.  NCNA did take note, however,
 of the presence at Peking's national day celebrations of the
 head of the BCP resident delegation in the PRC, Thakin Ba Thein
 Tin.  Thakin Ba Thein Tin has not been mentioned since that time
 in monitored Peking media.

 PRC  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 PROVINCIAL PARTY CO41ITTEE ESTABLISHED IN KIRIN
 Adhering to the usual format, NCNA on 30 March announced the
 formation of a party committee for Kirin Province.  Within
 the last 4 months, 15 of the PRC's 29 major administrative
 divisions have reconstructed new provincial committees.  As
 in all previous examples, NCNA specifically noted that the
 Kirin committee was elected in accordance with the formula
 of "old, middle-aged, and young."
 The Kirin committee was set up at a gathering of 921 party
 delegates in Changchun from 18 to 24 Mexch.  A six-man
 leadership group--slightly weighted in favor of men with
 military backgrounds. within the province--heads the
 new committee of 74 full and 15 alternate members.  The
 top party spot went to Wang Huai-hsiang, chairman of the
 provincial revolutionazy committee and since 1964 deputy
 political commissar of the Kirin Military District (MD).
 Kirin's four vice-chairmen were named secretaries.   Ho
 Yu-fa and Hsiao Tao-sheng are military men holding
 concurrent positions as commander of the Kirin MD and
 responsible person within the MD respectively.  Veteran
 cadres are represented on-the committee by Juan Po-sheng
 and Cheng Chi-chiao, both former secretaries on the old
 provincial coiitnittee.  Chang Chao-jen, a newcomer to Kirin
 identified only as a responsible person within the province
 in June 1970, was also named a secretary.
 Wang, making the usual speech on behalf of the party
 nucleus group, stressed the need to improve party
 leadership over economic work and step up overall
 production within the province.  As in the case of the
 keynote addresses given by the first secretaries in
 Liaoning, Kwangsi and Kansu--the other border provinces
 with rebuilt party committees--Wang called for strengthening
 Kirin as an "outpost" on China's Northeastern border.
 Unlike the previous examples, however, he did not specifically
 link this task to the need to prepare for war.

 FORMATION OF PARTY AND REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES COMPARED
 The attached table compares the formation of party committees
 with that of revolutionary committees at the same mid-point,
 when 15 of the 29 provincial-level units had managed to
 follow through on the center's instructions.  It will be
 seen that five provinces, plus Peking and Shanghai, were
 among the first 15 in both instances, in forming their
 revolutionary committees as well as their party committees.
 Of the six areas that were not among the first 15 in
 either instance, four--Tibet, Sinkiang, Yunnan and Ningsid--
 share the obvious excuse of remoteness and a dispersed
 populace.  The reasons for the dilatoriness of the other
 two--Szechwan and Fukien--are of a different order.
 The table shows graphically that the old CCP North Region,
 which led the field in er,tablishing revolutionary committees,
 has yielded primacy to the East in party reconstruction.
 The remaining four CCP regions show nearly the same rate of
 committee formation in both instances; there is a disparity
 of only one, plus or minus, for each of these four.

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 UKRAINE AND AZERBAYDZHAN CONGRESSES DIVERGE ON BREZJ-NEV
 In the two final republican congresses, Azerbaydzhan and the
 Ukraine followed prior patterns ir: their treatment of Brezhnev.
 The Azerbaydzhanis praised him while the Ukrainians paid him
 little deference.  Few sensitive issues were raised at either
 congress, but each, in contrast to the other republican
 congresses, was marked by sniping at incumbent or previously
 dismissed republic leaders.
 The Ukraine, unlike Brezhnev's other former home bases of
 Kazakhstan and Moldavia, has not gratuitously hailed Brezhnev
 and did not do so at its congress.  First Secretary Shelest
 paid less deference to Brezhnev in his congress report than
 any other republic First Secretary except Estonia's Kebin, who
 had ignored him entirely.  Shelest's only mention of Brezhnev
 was a short, innocuous quotation of his on the role of the
 party.  Moreover, unlike other republic or regional leaders
 (Kirgiz First Secretary Usubaliyev, Uzbek First Secretary
 Rashidov, Belorussian First Secretary Masherov, and Moscow
 First Secretary Grishin) who had praised Brezhnev's 50th
 anniversary and Lenin centennial reports, Shelest conspicuously
 praised only the party "documents" on these anniversaries.
 Shelest likewise cited only the translation of Lenin's works
 into Ukrainian and ignored the Ukrainian translation of
 Brezhnev's works which had been announced just the week
 before.
 Among other Ukrainian congress speakers, Brezhnev's old
 colleague, Premier Shcherbi.tskiy, quoted him twice, and
 President Lyashko and Kiev city first secretary A. P. Botvin
 cited him once.  The only unusual deference was shown by
 the Ivano-Frankovsk obkom first secretary, V. F. Dobryk, who
 expressed his oblast's "sincere and warm thanks to the CPSU
 Central Committee, Soviet Government, Central Committee
 Politburo, and personally Central Committee General
 Secretary Leonid Ilich Brezhnev" for their concern for
 and aid to the Ukraine (RADYANSKA UKRAINA, 20 March).
 Dobryk, former first secretary of Brezhnev's home town of
 Dneprodzerzhinsk, probably had special reason to be grateful
 to Brezhnev since he was the only provincial city first
 secretary (besides Leningrad) to be elected as CPSU Central
 Committee candidate member in 1966.

 31 MARCH 1971
 The Azerbaydzhanis displayed their traditional deference to
 Brezhnev.  Although they did not elect an honorary presidium
 consisting of the Politburo "headed by" Brezhnev as they had
 done in October 1970, First Secretary Aliyev in his concluding
 ?               speech reiterated the controversial formulation (BAKINSKIY
 RABOCHIY, 12 March).
 OTHER ISSUES     In contrast to most republic first secretaries,
 who had avoided discussion of foreign affairs,
 Shelest joined Uzbek First Secretary Rashidov in praising the
 new treaty with West Germany.  Zionism was attacked by Shelest,
 Zakarpatsk obkom first secretary Yu. V. Ilnitskiy, and writer
 Yu. K. Smolich, and ideological deviations were criticized by
 Shelest, Dnepropetrovsk first secretary Vatchenko, Kiev first
 secretary Tsybulko, Kharkov first secretary Vashchenko, and
 Ivano-Frankovsk first secretary Dobryk.  Vatchenko and
 Vashchenko used these deviations to snipe at ideology
 secretary Ovcharenko (see FBIS TRENDS for 17 March).  The
 economic reform received brief praise from President Lyashko
 and Lvov first secretary Kutsevol, while the production
 associations were encouraged by Shelest.
 The Azerbaydzhan congress was largely preoccupied with the
 1969-1970 purge of the republic leadership.  Some speakers
 urged further punishment for the ousted republic leaders,
 and Academy of Science President G. B. Abdullayev, whose
 organization had become the refuge for former first
 secretary Akhundov, former premier Alikhanov, former
 president Iskenderov, and former agriculture secretary
 Kyazimov, complained about the difficulty of operating
 the academy with such scientifically unqualified cadres
 among its leadership (BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY, 12 March).
 In addition, most of the surviving pre-Aliyev leaders were
 attacked and removed from office.  Ideology secretary
 D. G. Dzhafarov (attacked by name for "subjectivism") and
 longtime industry secretary A. D. Amirov (apparently blamed
 "
 "
 ?              for the
 sharp drop
 in oil production) were dropped from
 the Secretariat at the end of the congress.  Gosplan
 chairman M. I. Allakhverdov, condemned for his "harmful,
 unbusinesslike style of work," was dropped from the Central
 Committee and presumably will soon be removed as Gosplan
 chief.  Second secretary S. V. Kozlov--who, as Russian
 supervisor of the republic, is not so directly unc?.er
 Aliyev's control--and A. I. Ibragimov--promoted to premier
 in 1970--are now the only survivors of the pre-Aliyev
 bureau.
