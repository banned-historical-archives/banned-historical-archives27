 S
 There have been a number of commendable efforts to document debate
 in China over foreign policy issues which arose in the past two decades.
 In this paper, I present some general propositions regarding the impact
 of the Chinese. political process on foreign policy decisions.  My views
 have been shaped partly by reading about earlier debates, but primarily
 are based on my analysis.of developments since Mao's death.  By presenting
 .these hypotheses along with my assessment of current foreign policy options-
 in China, I hope to provide some guidance for understanding how domestic
 and international developments may shape China's foreign policy during the
 next decade.
 Propositions
 1.  As in every other country, there is nearly constant debate over foreign
 policy in China--despite the claims of Chinese leaders to the contrary; al-
 though the intensity and importance-of disagreement varies over-time:-=.
 2.  Domestic and foreign policy approaches become integrated because domestic
 issues are linked.by inherent logic with major strategic considerations
 involving relations with the U.S. and USSR.  These are the foreign policy
 issues in which top leaders thus become involved and which are'most affected
 by domestic political dynamics.  For example, assessments of the severity
 and character of the Soviet threat and of the best means of meeting it--
 including the trust-worthiness and likely lifespan of the U.S. counter-
 balance and the viability of China's own military counterforce--are closely
 tied to decisions about the defense share.of the budget, the priority.. to
 be given heavy industry, the appropriate degree of both domestic. security
 control and economic decentralization, and the importance of ideological'
 and political work.  Estimates of the value of attracting Western input

 ?
 into the Chinese economy relative 'to the dangers' a greater Western in-
 fluence in China are related to debate over relaxing press controls, building
 a more constitutional and legal government, and giving better treatment to
 those with contacts abroad, including ex-capitalists, intellectuals, reli-
 gious believers, and those with overseas Chinese connections.  Estimates of
 the potential for a peaceful reunification with Taiwan and the wisdom of
 delaying a resolution of the issue in exchange for better relations with
 the Wes.t'are tied in with nearly all of these. other issues.
 Debate over these issues often centers on the tradeoffs required
 between short-run..and long-run aims.  In a nutshell, in the 1.980s Chinese
 leaders are debating to what extent it is necessary and productive to rely
 on the U.S..strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union and the Western
 input into the Chinese economy and at what risk to domestic instability and
 the permanent loss of Taiwan and other lesser territorial claims.    '
 3.  Inter-related domestic and foreign policies are forged into policy
 "packages" due to the factional nature of Chinese politics.  These packages
 function somewhat like "campaign platforms" for individual leaders and their
 groups of supporters, with whom they become closely identified.  Partici-
 pants in policy debate use these "platforms" to attract broader support
 within the Politburo-level elite which will have an impact-on the final
 decisions.  For example, a policy package may be "floated" just prior to
 a party work conference in order on one hand, to alert. provincial-level
 leaders and central government officials to the lines of argument they should
 be expected to support and-on the other hand, to determine by watching
 the response from central and provincial organs what the. probable lineup
 of support will be.  After a high-level meeting, similar efforts will-be
 made to urge implementation of those decisions of-the meeting one favors

 and obstruct others and then ascertain whether PrVious recalcitrants have
 been won over.  Foreign policy issues--which are subject to much less wide-
 spread discussion and influence than domestic issues--nevertheless are
 raised to buttress arguments for the larger package in which the domestic
 program is of primary importance for attracting adherents.  In this
 "campaign" process, policy packages become clearly attributable to individuals
 at the top, and efforts by others to share in the glory of his successes
 or his own efforts to spread the blame-for acts that end in failure are
 largely unsuccessful.-
 4.  Due to the Prohibition on the use of official channels of communication
 'or informal personal contacts for such factional political activities, much
 of this "campaigning" is done openly inthc media --albeit  bliclue   to meet
 the requirement for secrecy of policy discussion.  Thus, foreign policy
 debate becomes evident to outsiders in several ways:
 --Differences appear in the ways top leaders treat the official
 foreign policy."line" in their public statements as well as in the-ways
 the official media deal with those statements, perhaps by giving some prom-
 inence and others low coverage or by deleting or including. key phrases in
 different versions of the same statements.
 For example, since at. least mid-1978 CCP Vice Chairmen Deng Xiaoping
 .and. Li Xiannian have differed significantly in their discussion of issues
 central to Sino-U.S. relations, suggesting that Deng has been pressing for
 major compromises on the Taiwan issue to gain strategic cooperation with
 the U.S. while Li has been reluctant to go as far.  For instance, in
 mid-July 1978 Congressman Wolff revealed that Deng Xiaoping told him during
 his visit to Beijing that the CCP could cooperate once again with-the KMT,
 as it had in the past, while making none of the standard references to the

 Approved For Release 2007/09/26: CIA-RDP85-00024R000300430005-0
 ?
 to the probable'need to use force against Taiwan   hus implying reunification
 would be peaceful.  Shortly thereafter, Li repeated the standard references
 to force and when asked about possible future cooperation with the KMT con-
 tradicted Deng's view that it was possible.* Following Chinese media play
 of these issues since then has proved instructive about Deng's progress in
 getting his view adopted as official policy.
 --Rare indirect references are made to high-level debate over.foreign
 policy.  For example, a People's Daily editorial of January-19 this year
 defended the predominantly Dengist policies passed by the party's Third
 Plenum in December 1978 against unnamed domestic ritics.  Since that meet-
 ing had approved the decision to normalize relations with the U.S., the
 editorial's defensive tone in insisting that China's foreign policy "will
 not change" implied there is current questioning of policies associated
 with China's closer ties with the U.S.  Similar defensive editorials earlier
 had revealed debate over China's attack on Vietnam.  On March 26, 1979,
 both the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily discussed the matter,
 and the army paper defensively proclaimed that the punitive attack was a
 "just war" and "it would not do if we had not fought it."
 --Anomalous foreign policy incidents sometimes occur which the
 Chinese foreign affairs apparatus has difficulty handling and explaining.
 For example, in April 1978 just prior to conclusion of the Sino-Japanese
 Peace  and Friendship Treaty, armed Chinese fishing boats converged on the
 Senkaku Islands--controlled by Japan but claimed by China as well.  This
 caused an uproar in Japan over an issue some Chinese leaders--most notably
 Deng Xiaoping--repeatedly had tried to "table" in order to improve Sino-
 Japanese relations.  The incident was smoothed over with difficulty but has
 never been satisfactorily explained, andit suggests that some elements of

 Approved For Release 2007/09/26: CIA-RDP85-00024R000300430005-0
 the Chinese leadership were afraid the treat signTFig would undercut China's
 claims to the territory and purposely tried to force attention to the issue
 at the last moment.
 --The foreign policy "line" on an issue sometimes changes in ways
 not clearly explainable by events.  For instance, there have been anomalies
 in China's public expressions of support for North Korean positions during
 the past few years which suggest PRC leaders are having difficulty resolving
 the incompatible imperatives of developing U.S.-China relations and support-
 ting the DPRK in order to preclude Soviet gains in influence in Pyongyang.
 A 9 September 1979 People's Daily editorial omitted the usual references
 toa U.S. troop pullout of South Korea, to support for reunification, and to
 criticism of the South Korean regime--references which have reappeared since
 then, although still without the stridency given them by the DPRK.  It
 thus seems probable that PRC leadership debate over the compromises in-
 volved in Sino-U.S. detente extend to treatment of relations with North Korea.
 --Media articles appear which use historical allegories or analogies
 to discuss foreign policy issues of current relevance.  Key themes from
 Chinese history have been used in the early 1960s,. in the Cultural Revolution,
 in the mid-1970s, and again in the post-Mao era.  At each period of time,
 recurring lines of argument have been given specific current resonance in
 order to defend or attack individuals then in power and their foreign
 policy preferences.  For example, debate over whether the Boxer Rebellion
 was anti-imperialist and revolutionary or purely xenophobic and reactionary
 as well as debate over whether Li Hongzhang and other late nineteenth
 century modernizers were patriotic or traitorous in their reform efforts to
 adapt Western ways and technology to China have both been vehicles for
 disagreement over China's political and economic relationship with the West.

 Media.re!rences to China's past historil relationship with
 northern barbarians and to early Soviet Russia's peace treaty with Germany,
 signed at Brest-Litovsk in 1918, have both been used to discuss the relative
 risks and gains of opposing or accomodating the USSR.  Recollection  of past
 CCP experiences with the US and the Nationalists has been symptomatic of
 debate over policy toward Taiwan.  Allegories  on all these themes with
 clear current relevance have appeared as late as last month.  In the past two
 years, another similar means of discussing foreign policy has been more
 frequent than in the past.  Media articles rehabilitating Chinese leaders purged
 during the Cultural Revolution either explicitly or implicitly have exon-
 erated the views they held on foreign affairs and thus removed former
 strictures against certain foreign policy options in current deliberations.
 Analysis of these media. revelations of foreign policy debate must
 be kept quite close to the domestic political context.  A. sense of-the
 relative strengths of contending groups and their access to the propaganda
 department and individual media organs is essential.  For example, Guangming
 Daily and professional journals like HIstorical Research are heavily in-
 fluenced by the pro-Deng Xiaoping Academy of Social Sciences and are likely
 to reflect his views, but give biased interpretations of the views of Deng's
 critics.  Moreover, since these critics have had less ready access'to the
 media in general since 1978, we can ascertain their views only from defenses
 against them.  Evidence of disagreement in People's 221.1y and Red Flag,
 especially in editorials, which are supposed to present a party consensus
 view, will mean debate is significant but since it will appear as ambiguity
 resulting from the patching together of contradictory points of view, the
 lines of argument will not likely be revealed.
 One must also take care to determine whether a foreign policy decision
 is being discussed prior to a meeting--in which case our own actions might

 ?                               ?
 influence the outcome--or is being reviewed later for other purposes.  For
 example, evidence of disagreement in late March 1979 over the earlier attack
 on Vietnam, read in its proper context, was not debate over whether to
 attack again but part of a larger critique of the underlying assumptions
 behind the first attack; the foreign policy  decision at stake was rather
 how far to carry the overtures  to  the Soviet Union then underway.  Another
 example would be allegories since 1978 rehashing Cultural Rev6l'ut-i-on -era
 arguments over foreign policy actions of Peng Dehuai and Liu Shaoqi which
 are connected primarily to,efforts to exonerate them and return to their
 domestic policies.  It is difficult therefore to determine whether there is
 equally heated debate over whether to adopt foreign policies similar to Liu's.
 Other evidence must be carefully considered.  For example, when proponents
 of a policy proposal in the early 1960s to reconcile differences with the
 USSR were exonerated just two days  after the PRC proposed to open talks to
 improve relations with the USSR-in early 1979, it became difficult to-argue.-
 the two events were mere coincidence rather.than related results of foreign
 policy Cscussion.

 5./     th the pronib"iticn against facticralism and the "campaign" nature of
 discussion of policy,packages are argued in exaggerated terms." Adhefents
 of a package must prove their proposals are presented in the interests
 of the nation, not of thei-r faction, and` in order to win the argument, tend
 to exaggerate the urgency of adopting their policies over others in order
 to "save the nation."  Thus, one set of policies is presented as "patriotic"
 and its alternative as "capitulationist."  Moreover, given China's commitment
 to Marxist solutions to problems, policy options must be presented. also in
 the language of orthodoxy.  Arguments on behalf of policy programs are but-
 tressed with quotations and examples from the history of Marxism, Western

 and Chinese.  In eneral, in this competitive at   phere, the benefits
 and risks of a given policy package--including its foreign policy components--
 easily become exaggerated.
 6.  When a single element of a policy package is criticized due to obvious
 failure or emergence of problems in implementation, the whole package tends
 to be called into question.  Domestic developments normally carry greater
 weight in opening up debate, determining the credibility of a package and
 affecting the power of its proponents.  Thus, a decisive shift in the
 power balance through the purge or death of a top leader such as Mao
 opens up debate across the board once the transition period is over.
 Lesser events, such as the incidents of political disruption which occurred
 in China in,early 1979 and again in late 1980 attributable to Deng's advo-
 cacy of democracy, can also open discussion of the whole package, as in
 March 1979 and December 1980.
 International events, however, can usually be interpreted differently--
 partly because of their complexity--and assessments can be tailored to
 support preferred domestic programs.  At most, foreign events like problems
 involved in the. attack on Vietnam.will be used to buttress calls for reasses-
 ment engendered by domestic developments.  Only events of great import can.
 trigger major debate, decisively "prove" one view superior to another and great-
 ly affect the domestic power balance.  The most obvious examples include the
 Soviet invasions of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979 which
 swayed argument in favor of those who stressed the risks of accomodating

 marines to Taiwan and to Taipei's claim to have received official invita-
 tions to the Reagan inauguration--at a time when it had appeared the Chin-
 ese would rather "wait and see" how the new Administration's China policy
 evolved--may be explained by the fact that Deng Xiaopi g's whole policy
 package had again come unraveled in late December, bringincritical

 .was helping Taipei strengthen its international posture.
 Current 0 tions for Foreign Policy Strategy
 From mid-1978 through mid-1979, international events and domestic
 politics interacted in such a way as to reveal the existence of competing
 policy packages with quite different foreign policy implications.  This
 period, and the debate over policy involved, have been discussed in detail
 in other papers, so I intend only to summarize these programs as I see them
 and then discuss recent evidence suggesting the likely evotuion=into--the-
 1980s of debate over these options in the wake of the Soviet invasion-of
 Afghanistan.
 The divergence'of views among the Chinese leadership centers on
 how to deal with the Soviet Union and stems from differing evaluations of
 the requirements of China's modernization effort in an uncertain internation-
 al environment.  One viewpoint, associated most prominently with Deng Xiao-
 ping, began to emerge in the Spring of 1978, as Deng consolidated his polit-
 ical, position and regained a dominant role in foreign policy.  His view
 stresses that China is threatened rather immediately by an implacably
 aggressive Soviet Union at a time of serious-economic backwardness and mil-
 itary weakness.     To ensure China's survival and progress in these circum-
 stances, Deng has urged a rapid, all-out economic development effort and
 drastic political reform at home combined with bold efforts to curtail

 Soviet influence abroad in concert with the U.S. and its allies.
 This assessment accounts for Deng's far-reaching domestic reform
 efforts to remove the constraints of Maoist dogma from policy formulation,
 purge officials committed to Maoist policies and promote those willing
 to adopt Deng's pragmatic, technocratic approach to boosting production
 through an increased role for the market mechanism, as.well as to implant
 a more rigorously legal and democratic political system which wi-Tl-be more
 responsive to such efforts.  Since Deng believes the West offers the?g atest
 potential for economic and technological support for such a rapid modern-
 ization effort--including in defense--as well as the strategic counter-
 balance needed to assure China's security for the duration, he has been the
 foremost proponent for closer ties of?a "long-term strategic"nature,
 approaching an alliance, with the U.S. and its allies.  Thus, his liberal
 domestic reforms are formulated with one eye on attracting such foreign
 which aims to
 support, and making credible his approach to Taiwan/encourag 2   eventual
 peaceful reunification through negotiations.
 To stress the urgency of domestic reform and developing ties with
 the West, Deng has been foremost among the leadership in pointing out the re-
 lentless and global character of the threat of Soviet expansion which requires both
 combined international action. to meet it and the maintenance of Beijing's
 traditional hardline approach in bilateral relations with Moscow.  In his
 view, efforts to conciliate the USSR would be dangerous both in that they
 would  frighten off would-be friends in the West who fear the monolithic
 Communist bloc may be reconstituted  and would invite aggression because
 the Soviets "bully the weak and fear the strong."
 Chinese leaders like Chen Yun, Ye Jianying and Li Xiannian, who
 may be described as moderate or centrist, tend to disagree with some or

 all of Deng's policy package.  Their competing views began to emerge
 in the wake of China's attack-on Vietnam in early 1979 when Deng's
 domestic reforms had led to incidents of social disruption and his foreign
 policy to a high state of tension with the USSR. These leaders do not
 endorse Deng's program of far-reaching reform either out of ideological
 reservationsand concern for their own political interests or because
 they fear the potentially destabilizing economic and political effects.
 Instead they urge a more cautious gradual approach in the interests of
 "stability and unity.   In particular, they believe China's economic state
 is so serious that it can neither afford to "buy modernization" from the
 West nor manage to absorb a massive Western input.  Moreover, they believe
 the harmful social effects of a larger Western presence would outweigh
 the economic benefits.  They propose instead a slower, indigenous growth
 of the civilian economy--with heavy defense cuts.
 In foreign policy,, these leaders argue that given the -likely : ---
 long-term state of China's weakness, it cannot afford to actively antagon-
 ize an aggressive Soviet Union.  Such leaders worry that the U.S. may
 prove unreliable as a counterweight to the USSR or even that the U.S.
 might use China's cooperation to put it on the front line.  They want,
 instead, to introduce a degree of detente into Sino-Soviet relations--
 stopping well short of rapprochement, but at least achieving a more
 neutral posture in the case of superpower confrontation.  Given the
 greater mistrust.of the US, and lesser need for the U.S. implicit in their
 approach, such leaders are less -willing to compromise with. the U.S. over
 Taiwan or to delay movement toward reunification.  They may also see-
 some logic to "playing" China's "Soviet card" to induce U.S. adherence
 to Chinese interests in a number of areas, including Taiwan.

 This alternative approach was pursued br  fly in Spring 1979
 when China opened bilateral talks with the USSR, but ground to a halt as
 Deng recovered lost political ground later that summer.  The Soviet invasion
 of Afghanistan served to strengthen once again Deng's argument for stra-
 tegic cooperation with the West, and Chen Yun's views in both domestic and.
 foreign affairs receded into the background through 1980.  Just now, how-
 ever, we are seeing a resurgence of Chen Yun's insistence on-the absolute
 necessity of severe economic retrenchment, enforced political stab l -ty,
 and delays in Deng.'s reform program.  Evidence too of a.Chen Yun argument
 in foreign affairs has again reemerged in the media, indicating it will
 continue to be a live option in the 1980s.
 Since a party work conference. in late December last year, there
 has been widespread evidence in the media that Deng's policy package was
 reopened to questioning and a change in line effected in domestic policies..
 People's Daily editorials have painfully argued that Deng's policies have
 just been delayed,not overturned,and that his foreign policy strategy will
 not change.  The media suggests, however, that Deng's critics are still
 trying to reopen foreign policy issues to further discussion and change
 prior to the party's upcoming sixth plenum.
 The fact of debate over foreign policy was inadvertently revealed
 in a defensive T9 January People's Daily editorial which in insisting on
 the continuing viability of the Dengist policy package. ratified by
 the 1978 third plenum--which included normalization of relations with the
 U.S.--argued that ''policies such as our economic policy of opening up to
 foreign countries on the premise of independence and self-reliance, our
 foreign policy insisting.on opposing hegemonism and safeguarding world
 peace and. so forth...will not change."  That Sino-Soviet relations
 are again at stake was suggested in a long discussion in a 4 February

 Workers' Daily article of the past contributions to the party by    deceased
 party elder Wang Jiaxiang, first ambassador to Moscow and pre-Cultural
 Revolution head of the International Liaison Department.   Wang was first
 exonerated in April 1979/two days after China proposed talks with the USSR
 to improve relations--in an article in. the same newspaper which said
 Wang'.s -early 1960s proposal to moderate hostilities toward the USSR.'
 (along with the U.S. and other potential enemies) was a reasonable option
 at a time of..economic difficulties (similar to those China now faces).
 The 1981 repetition of this appraisal  of'Wang's views, written by several
 currently high-ranking officials with influence in foreign affairs, in a
 political environment strikingly similar to early 1979, was phrased in
 14ang's argument
 most suggestive terms. The article quoted/that "It is better to adopt
 a moderate policy in foreign affairs in order to work against time to
 tide over difficulties and quicken accomplishment of our country's soc-
 ialist construction... During the struggle against imperialism, revision----
 ism and reaction, we should pay attention to strategy and tactics, guard
 against diverting a local war to our country and avoid being taken as the
 main target of attack..."   The article's many pointed references to the
 fact that Wang's views have often been right in the past, but were not pur-
 sued by the leadership seemed to suggest that Wang's proposed approach
 F------ is once again--wrongly--being overruled.
 Other recent media references defending Lenin's signing of the
 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918--at a time of economic chaos and intern-
 ational danger--suggest that the Chinese-leadership is debating whether
 to reopen Sino-Soviet talks, perhaps under secret Soviet prodding.  An
 article titled "Advance and Retreat" in Red Flag's first4issue this year
 defended the new economic retrenchment as a necessary antidote to impe-
 tuous and rash methods which exceeded objective possibility.  To bolster

 . its argument, the article pointed out how the Treaty-of Brest was necessary--
 despite its "regressive" nature--in order to give the "exhausted" state
 .an opportunity to regain its breath" in order to "consolidate the
 proletarian regime, maintain the proletarian leadership over the peasants,
 readjust its economy, build its Red Army to defeat the White Army and the
 foreign armed meddlers and stand rock-firm."
 The reference to the Russian Civil War and foreign meddlers in
 Red Flag may have had current relevanceto debate over how to handle the
 problem of. Taiwan, just as the. other references have obvious relevance
 for current Chinese concern about party control and economic recovery.
 An article in People's Daily on 8 January, in discussing a section from
 the new publication of Zhou Enlai's works, pointedly insisted "we should...
 learn from" a proposal of Zhou's in 1927 to repudiate the Soviet-sponsored
 alliance between the CCP and the KMT and attack Chiang Kaishek in the
 wake of his annihilation of Shanghai's communists earlier that year.
 According to the article, the party wrongly assessed that following Zhou's
 suggestion would bring in imperialist support for Chiang and thus spell
 .certain defeat,  while reducing the chances for aid from Moscow.  The
 article thus seemed to imply that today China should use the threat of force
 against Taipei rather than "hesitate, intending to settle by relaxation
 or preparing for long-term struggle"--an approach which would only re-
 0
 s.ult in "Chiang's political power-becoming more consolidated and his
 relationship with the imperialist powers gradually growing closer."  The
 article seemed to.argue that-if China were to deal more harshly with Chiang
 (Ching-kuo), the U.S. would not back him and that any U.S. aid to the PRC
 which would be.risked through this approach was either  not forthcoming in
 any case, or was not needed.   The article concluded with the argument

 Approved For Release 2007/09/26: CIA-RDP85-00024R000300430005-0
 that "we should rely on the people's revolutiona   strength but should not
 rely on foreign assistance to find solutions-to problems when we are in
 a difficult situation."
 Such insistence-on "self-reliance" with its distinctively xeno-
 phobic flavor has of course characterized debate in China over how much
 to involve China in the international Western economy throughout the 1970s,
 with deeper roots in the bitter 1950s experience with the-Soviet Union and
 in the -anti -imperialism of the late nineteenth century.  Other simil-ar
 recent media references strengthen the conclusion that debate has.again
 broken out on this sensitive subject.
 This People's Daily article
 nderscored the importance of current debate.when it
 insisted the 1927-debate was "not a manifestation of the controversy
 over policy, but was in fact a Struggle between two different strategic
 ideologies... related to finding a path for the revolution."  Like the
 article on Wang Jiaxiang, the theme of this piece reminded the reader of
 a minority opinion which proved later to be right but which was wrongly
 overruled at the time, thus suggesting that Deng's critics are still
 being overruled, but are arguing for reopening of discussion.
 Prospects for the'l980s
 The ways in which domestic political dynamics have influenced
 the course of debate over foreign policy in the recent past suggest :several
 developments.     will be important for the course of Chinese foreign
 policy in the 1980s:
 --The removal through death of top leaders involved in these
 debates, including Deng, Chen, Li, and Ye, will have an important impact
 on-the policy packages adopted.  As with Mao and Zhou, the order of their
 deaths will significantly influence who from the next generation emerges
 at the top, and the relative stability or instability of the succession..

 ?
 The several potential. successors now visible--H.u Yaobang and
 Wan Li (close to Deng), Hua Guofeng (backed by Ye Jianying),and Zhao
 Ziyang (a seeming compromise candidate), each have political weaknesses,
 especially in gaining the backing of the military, and none have much
 foreign affairs experience or influence.  No second-echelon leader with
 foreign affairs experience--such as Geng Biao--is a potential political
 force or is being allowed involvement in top foreign policy decisions.
 --The economic-situation will.prove critical in swaying foreign
 policy:preferences.  The go-slow approach is sensible but unpopular and
 may prove to represent only stagnation, not the slow sure progress it
 claims.  Neith"er.caution nor exuberance have proven capable of solving
 intractable problems and swings in policy are likely, contributing to
 complementary shifts in foreign policy.
 --The working out of evident civil-military tensions too may prove
 quite important to foreign policy, given the evidence with regard-to--
 Vietnam, the Senkakus, and Taiwan,.that an influential group favors more
 militant approaches  .to foreign policy matters.
 --Outside events will be important.  Soviet policy toward China
 may change in the period surrounding Brezhnev's demise.  If an openness
 to improving relations on China's part happend to coincide with an open-
 ness on the Soviet side, progress in decreasing the debilitating.hostil-
 ity between the two may gather momentum. The new U.S. administration's
 policy toward the USSR and toward China, including its dealings with
 Taiwan, as well as developments on Taiwan at the time.of CCK':s death,
 will'be important to China's assessment of,its options.
 While some of. these events may. be some time ahead of us, evidence
 of hot debate in China now suggests a turning point in Chinese policy
 choices may come sooner rather than later.  The timing and combination
 of domestic and foreign events will.prove key to those choices.
