 COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN CHINA
 This report presents a survey of counterrevolutionary activities
 in China, as discussed by the daily newspapers during October and
 November 1950.  The report covers the regional areas of the North-
 east, North China, East China, Central and South China, the North-
 west, and the Southwest.  It 9iscusses the methods used to suppress
 counterrevolutionary activities and gives the provisions of the Law
 on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionists.
 The October and November 1950 issues of various Chinese mainland newspapers
 carried a number of articles and editorials on the counterrevolutionary activ-
 ities which seem to have become prevalent in various parts of the country after
 the start of the Korean War and, particu1 rly, after the Chinese Communist charge
 that the US had bombed Northeast territory.  The counterrevolutionary and sub-
 versive activities are blamed on KMT special agents who are trained and backed
 up by "US imperialists."
 To counteract such activities, the Communists are stressing security and
 propaganda campaigns, warning the people against KMT agents, rumormongeri"g, and
 listening to the Voice of America broadcasts.
 The most recent development is the law providing for the severe punishment
 of counterrevolutionists, which was passed at the 11th administrative conference
 of the Government Administration Council on 20 February 1951.
 I.  COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES DIRECTED BY US IMPERIALISTS
 The general line taken by the government to cope with counterrevolutionary
 activities is indicated by Li Sha (1) Zn-=bers refer to appended character) in
 his article "Smash Counterrevolutionary Rumors," in the 16 October 1950 issue
 of the Shih-shah Shou-tze (Current Events Handbook), which was reprinted by the

 Mukden Tung  ei Jih_pao, 18 October 1950, and various other mainland news-
 papers.                      Li Sha asserted that counterrevolutionary elements are supported
 and manipulated by US imperialists.    He said that US imperialists have es-
 tablished espionage schools to train agents for the purpose of spreading
 counterrevolutionary and subversive activities on the Chinese mainland.
 The.6 November 1950 issue of the Urumchi Sinkiang Jih-par' published
 a Hsin-hua dispatch stating that MacArthur is directing the so-called Third.
 Force organized by KMP agents to carry on subversive activities in China in
 conjunction with US aggression in the Far East.  The paper also stated that
 the me;nbers of the Youth Party are collaborating with Japanese agents to
 counterfeit yuan notes to finance the activities of the Third Force in China.
 These counterfeiters are being smuggled into China via Hong Kong.
 A cartoon in the Dairen Jen-min Jih-pao, 1 November 1950, by Tung Feng
 (2) depicted masked spies in China sent by agencies in Taiwan and Tokyo.  A
 man, representing US imperialism, is sitting in a chair at the Tokyo Head-
 quarters, listening intently to messages sent in by these spies.
 The Chinese Communist Party seems to fear greatly the spreading of
 rumors.  Many editorials and articles have appeared in mainland newspapers,
 warning the people against listening to and spreading false rumors.  Several
 papers carried the above-mentioned Li She article which stated that after the
 start of the Korean War by the LS imperialists, rumors began to increase, and
 that they centered around the start of a third world war; dropping the atomic
 bomb; sabotage of government programs such as tax collection, state bond
 drives, relief, and land reform; and dissension between cadres and the masses.
 The extent of the concern felt by the Chinese Communists about rumors is
 revealed in an editorial by Wang Hui-p'ing (3) entitled "Unify the Movement to
 Study Current Events With the Campaign to Smash Counterrevolutionary Rumors in
 Mukden," which appeared in the Mukden Tung-pei Jih-pao, 20 November 1950.  The
 editorial said in part:
 Recently, a small number of death-defying Chiang counterrevolutionary
 elements infiltrated Mukden to spread rumors and to carry on espionage, sabo-
 tage, and subversive activities in conjunction with the war of aggression in
 Korea and the bombing of the Northeast by the US imperialists.
 They spread exaggerated and unfounded rumors.  These rumors have in-
 fluenced some people due to their ignorance of current events.  Some have lost
 their money and property by believing such rumors.  A worker sold most of his
 household goods to buy kaolin at an exhorbitant price.  An old man, living in
 Shen-ho Ch'u, sold his belongings to find safe abode in the country.  Another
 man, in Pei-shih Ch'u, sold his cart and horse to buy grain.  In this way, he
 lost his means of making a living.
 Due to such conditirsns, the public security agents swiftly arrested
 suspected rumoruongers and counterrevolutionary elements in Mukden.   Those ar-
 rested included remnants of the Chiang bandits, members of reactionary factions,
 reactionary landlords, and rich farmers.  They spread false and slanderous ru-
 mors to hasten the third world war in order to facilitate the early return of
 the Chiang bandits to the Chinese mainland.

 Sum
 To show how widely spread the counterrevolutionary activities are, the
 following information has been selected from various Chinese mainland news-
 papers and arranged according to geographical regions.
 On 29 July 1950, the public security personnel of Fu-lung-ch'uan and
 Nung-an Hsien captured KMT Agents Liu Fu-lu (4), Chang Yu (5), Shi Wan-ch'en
 (6), Yang Sheng (7), Li Yung-fang (8), and C4'i Yu-ts'ai (9), according to the
 Mukden Tung-pei Jih-pao of 25 October 1950.  The paper charged that since the
 start of the Korean War, these KMT agents had secretly organized KMT remnants
 and bandits, and had plotted armed revolt against the people's regime. They
 had bribed public security personnel to obtain travel permits in order to fa-
 cilitate spreading of rumors and instigating people to'rise up against self-
 4efense units and local ch'u governments.
 The 20 October 1950 issue of the same paper reported that in Chang-ch'un,
 the people's court had ordered death penalties for counterrevolutionary agents
 Chai P'i-hsi (10), Chang Chen-feng (11), and Wang Mao-ch'un (12), who were con-
 victed on 15 October 1950 for being implicated in the killing of many revolu-
 tionary cadres and patriotic youths prior to the city's liberation.  Chang;
 formerly a captain in the KMT Northeast Army, was said to have plotted the
 assassination of government and militery leaders in Chang-ling Hsien, the cir-
 culation of counterfeit money, and the looting of people's property.  Wang was
 accused of organizing rich farmers and killing many people.
 2.  Liaotung
 The Mukden Tuna-nei Jib-Rao of 21 October 1950 carried an article describ-
 ing the capture of 19 members of the KKT.agency in Mukden known as the Third De-
 tachment Bureau of the Chinese International Third Party.  The Mukden People's Court
 ordered death penalties for eight of,.the 19 arrested, including Li Chi (13), Pi
 K'o-lu (14), Yu Chen (15), and Fei,g Min-wen (16).  They were accused of collect-
 ing photographs of government leaders in the Northeast in order to assassinate
 them, gathering information from industrial plants, pinpointing important agen-
 cies on a map of Mukden to facilitate swift take-over after the landing of Ch'-
 ang's armed forces on the mainland, mobilizing KMT remnants to expand espionage
 activities, and organizing an agency called the Cheng-i She (Righteous Society)
 whose principal job is to spread rumors.
 On 7 November 1950, the Dairen Jen-min Jih-pao reported that 25 members
 of  another  agency,. the  Cheng-hua She had been arrested and convicted of plot-
 ting armed revolt against the Mukden municipal government.  Death sentences were
 pronounced for the following:  Hsu Ying (17), Liu K'o-chih (18), Lao Hsiao-wu
 (19), Wang Chien-li (20), Yu Ching-hsiu (21), Lu Ch'un-yu (22), Chang Chih-ho
 (23), Chang Ju-chiu (24), Shan Yen-chi (25), and Liu Yung-ch'ang (26).
 The Jen-min Jih-pao gave the following account of their activities:
 After the liberation of Mukden, these agents either failed to reg-
 ister, according to the government decree requiring all reactionary party members
 to register, or registered under assumed names.  The agents carried on various
 espionage activities in Mukden and awaited the return of Chiang's armed forces
 to the Chinese mainland.

 In the spring 1949, Hsu Ying and Ying Chih-liang (27), desir-
 ing to organize an armed group for conspiracy contacted Liu and others and
 formed the Cheng-hua She in.June 1949.  The organization had sections han-
 dling training, economic, and military affairs and a Guerrilla Activity Pro-
 motion Un t,,,,,The mission of the organization was to attack people, to spread
 rumors, to upset the social order, and to sabotage economic reconstruction
 measure, thereby increasing the number of unemployed workere and creating
 dissatisfaction among the people.  The Cheng-hua She also plotted to over-
 throw local governments when the Nationalists made landings on the mainland.
 The people were swindled out of 500 million yuan for operating funds.  The
 Guerrilla Activity Promotion Unit was organized in the Liaosi area by re-
 cruiting former KMT troops, vagabonds, bandits, and stragglers.
 Under Hsu's direction the unit extended its activities into Muk-
 den, Fu-shun, and An-shan.  Various elements were organized and ordered to
 attack cooperatives, to steal people's property, money, trucks, carts, and
 stores.  They were ordered to sabotage agricultural production activities,
 to incite unrest, to sabotage factories, and to spread rumors in schools.
 After the start of Korean War they intensified the spreading of rumors and
 reactionary slogans.
 The Dairen Jen-min Jih-Pao, of 25 October 1950, stated that ten mem-
 bers of the Fu-shun Branch of the KMT Party were arrested because of sabotage,
 spreading of rumors, and plots to carry out armed revolt against the Mukden
 government.  Among the captured were Hsu Wei-kuie (28), chief of the intel-
 ligence section of the KMP 207th Division.  The paper added, "In November 1949,
 Hsu mobilized KMP remnants and special agents who attacked our troops, fac-
 tories, and mines.  This sang also printed and scattered anti-USSR and anti-
 Communist handbills, set up target markers to facilitate bombing by KMP planes
 of vital areas, and sent agents into our public security and peace-maintenance
 agencies to induce personnel to defect."
 The Mukden Tung-pei Jih-pao of 24 October 1950 reported that the
 Liaosi Provincial People's Court had-ordered death sentences for three counter-
 revolutionary agents:  Ho Nai-ying (29), Lo Chen-yuan (30),  and K'an Huai-
 cheng (31).  According to the Tung-pei Jih-pao,  Ho, age 32, had killed cadres
 and had sabotaged land-reform activities in the Third Ch'u of the T'ieh-ling
 Hsien in 1947. Later, he collected CCF troop information for the KMT.  In
 1948, he was assigned to carry out subversive activities in the Mukden area.
 The same source reported that Lo, age 47, had attacked and killed many villag.
 ers in I Hsien; and that K'an had organized a guerrilla unit and attacked CCF
 troops, ransacked farmhouses and granaries, killed the chairman of a peasant
 association, attacked CCF transport units, and pillaged goods.
 4.  Port Arthur-Dairen Area
 The 1 November 1950 Dairen Jen-min Jih-pao carried an article stating
 that the Port Arthur-Dairen People's Court had ordered death sentences for KKT
 Agents Liu Jen-te (32), Liu Shu-jung (33), and Kuo Yang-t'ung (34), who were
 convicted of gathering arms and information; collecting photographs of CCP lead-
 ers to be assassinated; spreading rumors, and plotting the overthrow of the peo-
 ple's regime.
 The Dairen Jen-min Jih- ao of 26 November 1950, stated that in Peiping
 the military tribunal of the Peiping Military Control Committee handed down death
 sentences to five KMT agents of the Hopeh Province People's Self-Defense Army, on

 21 November 1950.  The five agents, Ma Te-fu (35), Yu Mao-chip (36), Liu
 Chen-ya (37), Kuo Tien-yix (38), and Sun Chin-chien (39), were accused of be-
 ing the principals in plotting espionage, sabotage, and subversive activities
 and armed revolt against the Central People's government.
 In Pao-ttng, according to the Mukden Tung-pei Jih-pao of 22 October
 1950, the Shih-chia-chuang People's Court ordere  death sentences for the mem-
 bers of the 813th Unit which later was reorganized and renamed the National
 Salvation Young People's Riot-Suppression Vanguard Unit of the North China An-
 nihilation Regiment (ts'ung-tui).  The 813th Unit was also known as the Kung-
 chiao Pao-kuo Corps, the Min-chung Self-Defense Corps, and the Min-chung Co-
 operative National Reconstruction Promotion Corps.                                  Wu Ya-ko (40), Chao Ya-k'o
 (41), Mi Erh-hai (42), and Yang Tung-lai (43) received death sentences. Yueh
 Lei-ssu (44), Ch.'en Tao-sheng (45), Sung Kuei-lan (46), and Liu T'ung-chu re-
 ceived jail terms.
 The same issue of the Mukden Tu  - ei Jih- ao gave the following ac-
 count of the activities and members of the 813th Unit:
 Using religious activities as a cover, these agents carried on
 counterrevolutionary activities.  In 1947, they organized an espionage group
 in a church and gathered military information in Snih-chia-chuang, Ping-shan,
 Ling-shou, and Chong-ting.  They also placed target markers in vital areas to
 aid KW bombers, and caused huge losses to life and property.  In April 1950,
 all members of the 813th Unit were captured.
 Wu Ya-ko, a native of P'ing-shan Hsien, was a priest of the Roman
 Catholic Church at Cheng-ting.  He joined the KEfP Party in 1946 and was appointed
 a member of the executive committee of Chen-ting Ch'u.  He joined the 813th Unit
 in 1947.  In August 1947, he went to Peiping for special assignment.  He returned
 to Shih-cghia-chuang and formed an espionage organization in Hsi-li Ts'un.  He
 dispatched 70 agents to work in Shih-chia-chuang, Ping-shans. Ling-shou, Cheng-
 ting, Wu-chi, and Kao-ch'eng.  After the liberation of Shih-chta-chuang in No-
 vember 194', he infiltrated the rural areas of Cheng-ting and Kao-ch'eng hsiens,
 set up an intelligence organization, anal carried on spy activities in liberated
 areas.
 In January 1948, he went to Peiping to receive military information
 about Shih-chia-chuaag and Ping-shah sent by his accomplices.  In August, he re-
 ceived three intelligence reports from Mi Erh-hai.  They included a diagram giv-
 ing the location of garrison units in P'S.ng-shorn Hsien and the location of mark-
 ers on Chieh-chien Shan to direct KMT bombers to vital areas, and a diagram of
 Shih-chia-chuang indicating places where red and white markers were placed to
 facilitate the bombing of the city.  On 13 September, Shih-chia-chuang and vicin-
 ity suffered heavy losses in lives and property due to KMT bombings.  Wu also
 assigned Sung and Yang in liberated areas to kill political officers of various
 CCF troops.
 Chao Ya-k'o, a native of Cheng-ting Hsien, was a priest at the Pei-
 ch'iao-sai Church.  In 1940, he worked with a Japanese military police unit in
 Hsing-an Ts'un and Kao-cheng Hsien, and organized the Communist Annihilation
 Corps which killed many revolutionary workers.  In 1947, he joined the 813th
 Unit and was assigned to lead the sixth company of the corps.  He and his col-
 leagues gathered information about military and government agencies, factories
 and storehouses in liberated areas.
 Mi Erh-hai, a native of Ning-chin Hsien, later moved to Ping-shan
 Hsien.  He joined a KMT self-defense corps during the liberation of Shih-chia-
 chuang.                              He was captured, but 2.att, escaped.  In February 1948, he went to Pei-
 ping and joined the 813th Unit.  '.!u assigned him to Cheng-ting and Ping-shan
 to gather information to be sent to Peiping.  In August 1948, he placed target
 markers in Ping-shan to assist KMT bombers.

 Yang Tung-lai was a native of Ling-shou Hsien.  In 1946, he
 joined the Huan-hsiang Tui which killed many revolutionary workers.  In Oc-
 tober 1947, he joined the 813th Unit.  In. April 1948, he drew up man; in-
 telligence reports and gave them to Sung to be forwarded to Wu in Peiping.
 In September, he set fire to a hamlet in Ling-shih Hsien to attract KP
 bombers to the area.  He also plotted to kill Chinese Communist military
 and government leaders.
 Recently, in Nanking 16 members of a secret KMT organization known
 as the Chinese People's Anti-Communist, Anti-USSR National Salvation Associa-
 tion, were arrested according to the 20 October 1950 issue of the Canton Nan-
 fang Jih-pao.  Li Shan-hsiu (47) was in charge of internal affairs and Kao
 Hsia-ch'ang (48), external affairs of the organization.  They and their col-
 leagues were charged with holding secret  meetings at No 11 Ning-hai-lu in
 Nanking to plan such activities as spreading of rumors, distributing reac-
 tionary handbills, and assassination of important Communist personnel.  In
 September 1950, Kao and Li planned the robbery and assassination of,;Butros
 Abadir, former Egyptian charge d'affaires, with the help of Chang Ming-liang
 a servant discharged by Abadir.  Abadir was wounded seriously in this attempt
 in which the KMT agents used the "personal grudge of Chang against Abadir as
 the motive to cover the real intentions of the spy group."
 The Hsin Soochow Pao of 3.6 October 1950, reported the arrest and
 sentencing to death of Chang Chih-hsianon  (40)  and six others by the Wu Hsien
 People's government on 14 October 1950.  Ten others were given prison terms
 or released after indoctrination.  According to the Hsin Soochow Pao, they were
 guilty  of  counterrevolutionary activities within the area controlled by the
 SouUi Kiangsu ?u ministra1ive Office.   The paper  stutcd that Chang  joined the
 puppet Loyal Salvation Army (Chung-chiu-chun) after completing training at
 an, espionage school.  After the liberation of Shanghai, he infiltrated Wu
 Hsien and organized the First Raiding Detachment of the Peiping-Shanghai-Hang-
 chow People's Anti-Communist Self-Defense Regiment of the KMT Ministry of Na-
 tional Defense.  Appointing himself the detachment commander, Chang organized
 50'ibandits into the unit and began raiding activities.  He killed a deputy
 village chief in Yang-ch'eng Ch'u, raided merchant vessels, ransacked 60 farm-
 houses, stole grain, and distributed reactionary pamphlets to incite hatred
 between cadres and farmers.
 The 20 November 1950 issue of the Shanghai Wen-hui Pao reported that
 in Ch'ang-hhu Hsien, the local people's court oraered the,,death sentence for
 "arch-criminal" Ku Hung-nan (50) who while hsiang chief of Mao-Ch'iao Hsiang
 performed "acts prejudicial to the interests of the people."  In Wu-hsi Helen
 Li Ai-chiing (51) was executed on 13 November 1950 because of his counterrevo-
 lutionary activities in the Wu-hsi area.  After the liberation of Shanghai, Li
 and Kao Huan-jung (52), who were also executed; assembled KMT remnants and
 formed the Wu-hsi Detachment of the Peiping-Shanghai-Hangchow Guerrilla Regi-
 ment.  In Feng-hsien Hsien, Yu Chao-ch'iao (53) was executed after a public
 trial on 12 November 1950.  He was convicted of injuring revolutionary com-
 rades and farmers.

 This same issue of the Wen-hui Pao gave the following biographical
 sketches of the condemned men:
 Chin Yung was a leader of the National Salvation Youth Corps of
 the San-min Chu-i Society of China.  The corps members printed and scattered
 rumor leaflets and pamphlets, and conspired with bandits in the Hsi-chung-
 shih region of Soochow area and in the Wu-chiang area to overthrow the local
 people's government.
 Ling Chih-ming was a former army rebel.  When chief of the Com-
 munications Headquarters of the National Salvation Youth Corps of the San-min
 Chu-i Society, he established five stations in Pei-she and Hsin?-t'a in Li-li
 Hsien to buy weapons from Communist soldiers.  These weapons were used in
 armed revolt against our leadership agencies.
 Hsu Jen-chieh was chief of the station at Li-li.  On 25 April,
 he joined Ma A-ken, and Chin Hui-chung to attack our signal corps unit attached
 to the 3d Battalion, 19th Regiment, and escaped with infantry rifles and sev-
 eral hundred rounds of ammunition. On 27 April,,they attacked the She-ming Hsiang
 government but failed to assassinate any key officials.
 Han Chen-chung was brigade commander of the KMT Independent Bri-
 gade, East China Garrison Headquarters.  He joined some 30 bandits in the Wu-
 chiang area and collected public grain, stole money, etc., to disturb the so-
 cial order.
 In Shanghai, the agents of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau cap-
 tured RO members of the KMP snv organization, the National Salvation Youth
 Corps of the Anti-Communist Vanguard Regiment of the KMP Ministry of National
 Defense, according to the Mukden, Tun - ei Jih-pao, of 7 November 1950.  The
 code'-designation for the corps was 3811th Unit and the agents were convicted
 of spreading rumors, distributing reactionary pamphlets  gatheringiiDf'.0 =a+_A0!p,
 and other coutltLIrrevolutionary activities.  The Tung-pei Jih-pao gave the fol-
 lowing report of their activities:
 The principals of the captured group were Li Kuo-ling (58) and
 Chou Hsien (59), members of an espionage group called the Greater Shanghai
 Youth Service Regiment.  In March 1950, Li organized the 3811th Unit with mem-
 bers recruited from EMT remnant troops, merchants, and other reactionary ele-
 ments.  This unit specialized in spreading rumors, gathering information from
 factories, PLA garrison areas, and police stations.  Li sent his agents into
 factories to spread rumors, create :.isunity among workers, and to sabotage
 production by damaging machinery and setting fire to storer.ouses.
 The night before the celebration of National Day, reactionary
 pamphlets were printed to be scattered on streets during the holiday parade.
 The group planned to send special agents into factories to destroy machinery
 during the celebration, but the public security agents rounded up the agents en
 29 September.  Except for about ten persons, all those captured are expected to
 receive death sentences.
 he Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, on 11 and 16 November 1950, carried the fol-
 lowing articles regarding counterrevolutionary activities:
 Two counterrevolutionary agents were convicted and executed at
 the Pang-fu Prison recently.  They were Chang Jung (60) and Shih Ching (61).

 Force of the Southeast People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army.  The
 unit then plotted armed revolt against the people's governments.  It also
 joined with pirates to harass merchant vessels.  Later, the unit was sent to
 a KMT-occupied area for special orders.  It returned to Shanghai with wireless
 equipment to use in sending information to the enemy.
 Shih Ching age 25, was a native of Tung-t'ai.  He received espio-
 nage treining:in the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Regiment, holding positions
 of company commander, regimental adjutant, etc.      After the liberation of Shang-
 hai, he escaped into the bandit-occupied area, and joined the Kiangeu-Chekiang
 Coastal Region Command Post of the Southeast People's Anti-Communist National
 Salvation Army. He and other members of this unit returned to Shanghai, gathered
 military and government information, pinpointed bombing targets for KMT bombers
 destroyed railroads, killed progressive leaders, and scattered anti-USSR rumors
 and false rumors to mislead the people.  The group also planned other large-
 scale counterrevolutionary activities.
 Besides Chang and Shih, 19 others connected with the enemy es-
 pionage organization were giyen jail terms or ieleased after indoctrination.
 Seventeen members of two KMT underground groups were also captured
 by Shanghai and Chia-shan public security. personnel.  The two groups are known
 as the Second Detachment of the Third Command Post, Tien-mu-shan Raiding Col-
 umn of the KW MLnistry of National Defense, and the puppet Chia-Shan Hsien gov-
 ernment.  These agents tr?f!ltrated Shanghai from Taiwan, organized an armed
 guerrilla unit, and circulated counterfeit yuan notes to disrupt the economic
 reconstruction program.
 The captured agents included Ch'i Hung-ya (62). Chao Chen-yu (63),
 Chen Wen-hsiu (64), Ma Mu-pin (65), and Liu Tso-min (66).
 On 15 November 1950, the Shanghai People's Court ordered the execu-
 tion of 17 KMT agents. Prior.to?their execution,, they were placed:,ou_.a red patrol
 wagon bearing a placard reading "These KMT Spies Are Condemned to Die" and were
 paraded through Shanghai's streets to show the people the `fate of all gounter-
 revolutionary agents.  The executed agents included Li Chien-ch'ung (67) and
 Ch'eng Shu-huai (68).
 The Voice of America was accused of being the principal source of..-false
 rumors by the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao in its issue of 13 November 1950.  The paper
 stated that recently rumors have increased tremendously in Shanghai, and attrib-
 uted them chiefly to the "rumor-mongering" broadcasts of the Voice of America
 which has intensified its program of "disseminating lies and slander in conjunc-
 tion with the expansion of aggressive war by the US imperialists."
 According to the Ta Mang Pao, some rumors were started by KMT secret
 agents but the Voice of America was blamed for most of them.  The paper said that
 many people in Shanghai have demanded a ban against listening to the Voice of
 America and that agents of the Public Security Bureau are tracking down the sources
 of rumors and arresting them.
 The Ta Kung Pao report stated:  "Chou, age 28, is a native of Chekiang
 Province.  Since liberation, he has sabotaged all. types of patriotic movements,
 such as the selling of state bonds, collection of taxes, etc.  During the pres-
 ent Resist US, Aid Korea and Defend Home and Nation Movement, Chou has used in-
 formation heard on Voice of America broadcasts to spread rumors.  Also he ob-
 tained military and government secrets to send to the Voice of America."

 The Public Security Bureau in Canton rounded up some 25 KMT special
 agents during July and August 1950, according to the 4 October 1950 issue of
 the Canton Nan-fang Jih-pao.  They belonged to the Intelligence Team of the
 Southern Kwangtung Station attached to the Intelligence Bureau, KMT Ministry
 of National Defense, and the 18th Independent Detachment of the Kwangtung-
 Kwangsi Border Region Anti-Communist National Salvation Self-Defense Army.
 Liao Ch'i-kueng and Huang Han-huan (92), leaders of the respective groups,
 were captured.  The primary mission of these organizations was to gs,ther mil-
 itary information and forward it by radio to the KMT intelligence headquar-
 ters in Hong Kong.  Other missions of these organization included:  pilfering
 granaries, attacking customhouses, merchant vessels, etc., to raise funds.
 On 22 October 1950, the Canton People's Court ordered death sen-
 tences for seven counterrevolutionary members of armed espionage units known
 as the First Column of the Pearl River Delta Anti-Communist National Salvation
 Self-Defense Army and the Northern Kwangtung People's Anti-Communist National
 Salvation Assault Force.
 The captured KMT agents included:  Yu Hsing-huang (93), Liu
 Shen4tsan (94), Ho K'un (95), Chang T'ieh-ch'iu (95), Tseng Hsiang-chen (97),
 Hsieh Tao-n_. (98), and Chang H----fu (99).  They infiltrated Cahtoii in March
 1950 and organized the First Column with bandits and vagabonds.  In July, Yu
 went to Hong Kong to receive instructions from the KMT special agent organiza-
 tion; later he returned to Canton to enlarge his organization and intensify
 subversive activities.
 In May 1950, Chang T'ieh-ch'iu, joined a KMT espionage group in
 Hong Kong called the Northern Kwangtung  People's Anti-Communist National Sal-
 vation Assault Force.  He was appointed a divisional commander.  He joined
 Hsieh Tao-nan and Chang Ran-fu and secretly organized an espionage group con-
 sisting of vagabonds and local rebels to obtain military information.  Hsieh
 and Chang infiltrated the Ch'ing-yuan and Ying-te areas of Kwangtung, secretly
 organized local bandit remnants and carried out subversive activities.
 Tang participated in counterrevolutionary activities in the North-
 east and Tientsin areas.  He followed our troops southward and in 4 October,
 was caught trying to throw hand grenades into our field hospital and storage
 dumps.
 The 14 and 19 November 1950 issues of the Urumchi Sinkiang Jih-pro carried
 the following articles about counterrevolutionary activities in Ch'i-t'ai Hsien
 and in Urumchi:
 The local bandit, Kao Tsung-hai (100), was executed on 27 October 1950
 because of his criminal activities before and after the liberation of Ch'i-t'ai
 Hsien in Sinkiang.  During the KMT regime, he had, been a pao chief in a village

 organized groups to spread rumors and create dissension among the various
 nationalities.  When KMT bandits attacked Tung Hsiang in Ch'i-t'ai in the
 spring of 1950, Kao murdered three farmers and injured another.
 On 14 November 1950, KMT special agents Wu Hsiang-Jung (101) and
 Wu Shou-erh (102) were paraded through Urumchi streets on a propaganda car
 and forced to confess their guilt to the public.  The car was followed by
 another one loaded with public security agents who notified people to be
 on the lookout for such special agents who spread rumors and carry out other
 activities to disturb the social order.
 Southwest
 The Shanghai Ta Kura Pao of 13 November 1950 stated that the public
 security agencies of all levels in Southwest China, during the past 10 months
 had captured 6,008 KML special agents, registered 13,598 special agents who
 voluntarily registered, uncovered 1,391 cases involving insurrection plots,
 and confiscated 113 pieces of radio equipment.  Among the KMT agents captured
 were Hsiung Fu-kuang (103), who murdered Li Kung-p'u (104) and Wen I-to (105);
 and Hu Cheng-chao (106), who killed Tu Pin-ch'eng (107), a Democratic League
 official in Sian.  Among those captured and later executed were two murderers
 belonging to Chiang's special agents in Chungking:  Liu Chih-ch'in (108), and
 Hsu Kuei-lin (109).
 The liberation of Southwest China, according to the same newspaper, was
 somewhat delayed because of various counterrevolutionary activities carried
 out by the Chiang-directed special agents.  The paper stated, "They used feudal
 religious sects as a cover to spread rumors, cost murder, scatter poisons and
 epidemic bacilli, and instigate riots. They infiltrated government agencies to
 gather information, and plotted organized armed revolt.  In cities and towns
 they sabotaged our production and reconstruction activities; in rural areas they
 joined reactionary landlords and sabotaged the rent-reduction and social-reform
 programs and killed active member of peasants associations."
 The Communists are reorganizing agencies throughout China to suppress all
 counterrevolutionary movements, to annihilate all special agents, and to main-
 tain peace and security.  In East China, according to the 19 November 1950 issue
 of the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, an announcement was made on 17 November 1950 re-
 garding the reorganization of the Wu-sung--Shanghai Garrison Headquarters into
 the East China Military District Public Security Headquarters.  Chen I, the
 commander of the East China Military District and Tang Liang (110), deputy chief,
 listed among the many duties of this new agency that of suppressing all counter-
 revolutionary movements, annihilating all special agents, and maintaining public
 peace and security.
 Commenting on the three KMT agents captured in the Port Arthur-Dairen area,
 an editorial in the 1 November 1950 issue of the Dairen Jen-min Jih- ao emphasized
 that special agents must be severely punished.  The editorial quotes Article 7 of
 the Common Program which stipulates that the People's Republic of China must sup-
 press all counterrevolutionary activities, severely punish all KMT counterrevolu-

 The rising tide of counterrevolutionary activities has resulted in severe
 measures as indicated by the 20 February 1951 decree issued by the Peiping
 government.  The decree authorizes the penalties of death or life imprison-
 ment to a long list of counterrevolutionary offenses, according to the New York
 Hua-ch'iao Jih-pao, 1 March 1951.
 The Communists are increasing their vigilance against espionage, sabotage
 and subversive activities in vital industries.  The Mukden Tung-pei Jih-pao,
 31 October 1950, carried a reprint of an editorial, which had appeared recently
 in the Liaotung Ta-chung Pao, urging the expansion of the militia to combat
 counterrevolutionary activities.  Villages in Kirin and Mukden provinces, ac-
 cording to the  Mukden Tung-pei Jih-pao of 24 October 1950, combined the au-
 tumn harvesting with the 'three-def ense movement," i.e., defense against fire,
 defense against traitors and dishonest traders, and defense against special
 agents.  Militia and self-defense units were organized in vi:lages to patrol
 farm areas to prevent sabotage to crops, to check the spread of rumors, and to
 protect production activities.
 The Dairen Jen-min Jih-pao, of 23 November 1.950, carried an article about
 various enterprises in the Northeast increasing public security measures.  Ac-
 cording to the article, factories and mines are holding meetings to discuss the
 threat of saboteurs, organizing patrols to guard vital areas, and formulating
 fire-prevention measures.  The Mukden Public Security Bureau is training per-
 sonnel to increase public security cadres.
 Sabotage against railroads and railroad facilities are being prevented by
 constant vigilance.  Security measures have included registration of reactionary
 party members and special agent organizations.  During the past year, public
 security agents, troops and other organizations guarding railroads and equip-
 ment in the Northeast, North, and South China have accomplished much in the way
 of security.  The Dairen Jen-min Jih-pao of 6 November 1950, stated that, based
 on the date collected during January to July 1950 by the six railroad bureaus in
 China, 116 sabotage plots had been uncovered and 238 suspects captured.  There
 were 270 cases of sabotage committed against railroads and facilities, and 741
 armed special agents captured during the period.
 The Shanghai Military Control Committee announced that, effective 15 Novem-
 ber 1950, the winter security campaign would be started in Shanghai, according
 to the 14 November 1950 issue of the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao.  The article declared
 that the campaign would be carried out in accordance with the "Regulations to
 Insure Suppression of Counterrevolutionary Activities, to Consolidate Social
 Order, and to Protect State Property and Public Enterprises."  The regulations
 -include the following provisions:
 The Shanghai People's Winter Security Committee shall direct all winter
 security activities, and shall be vested with the authority to direct security
 activities in military and government agencies, educational and social organiza-
 tions, and industrial and business enterprises.
 During the campaign, the following violations of security regulations
 shall be handled by the committee or by the people's courts:  organizing illegal
 societies, issuing illegal documents, compromising state secrets, carrying on
 counterrevolutionary activities designed to threaten the stability of government
 and the security of the people, committing arson and setting off explosions, di-
 recting subversive activities to damage land or marine communications facilities
 and public utilities, destroying public property, sabotaging economic reconstruc-
 tion projects.-committing robbery, plotting subversive activities to create fi-
 nancial chaos or to force a rise in prices, fabricating and spreading rumors, and
 other activities which violate the winter security measures.

 During the winter security campaign, reactionary elements and others
 shall be given a chance to repent or to ask for a pardon.. They may petition
 for a pardon or for a commutation of their sentences.
 The Communists are also conducting propaganda campaigns to arouse the
 people to the dangers of counterrevolutionary activities, asking them to re-
 port counterrevolutionary elements to the proper authorities.  According to
 the Shanghai Wen-hui Pao of 19 November 1950, a program was set up in August
 1950 in Tientsin to suppress counterrevolutionary and special agent activities.
 The program began with small discussion groups to familiarize the people with
 the government's policies on suppression of espionage activities and the pres-
 ervation of peace.  Propaganda was spread through newspapers, radio, motion
 pictures, meetings etc; after which the citizens "clearly understood" the
 policy of the people's government to suppress the counterrevolutionary move-
 ment.  This propaganda program resulted in the uncovering of many special
 agents.
 The Communists have stepped up their campaign against armed bandits and
 have decided to take part in the Korean War to defeat the "US imperialists,"
 whom they call the real manipulators of the counterrevolutionary elements in
 China. An article by Li Nan-shah (111), "Continue the Struggle Against Coun-
 terrevolutionary Elements," in the 16 October issue, of the Current Events
 Hardbook which also appeared editorially in the 18 October 1950 issues of the
 Mukden Tung-pei Jih-pao, the Hsin Soochow Pao, and other papers, emphasized
 that the Communists must realize that bandits, special agents, reactionary
 landlords, members of reactionary sects, and feudal elements are all secretly
 banded together against them.  According to Li, arms are supplied to native
 bandits by reactionary landlords to sabotage various government programs, and
 the land-reform program still remains incomplete because of the activities of
 these armed bandits.  He suggested that the task is more difficult because the
 armed bandits must be eliminated before the feudal and reactionary elements can
 be crushed.
 The Mukden Tung-pei Jih_pao, of 20 November 1950, charged that the start
 of the Korean War by US imperialists ended the peace in the Far East, that the
 expanding war is endangering the Northeast, and that the people in the North-
 east are greatly incensed at the US aggressors and have indicated their deter-
 mination to push back and crush the enemy by actual intervention in the war.
 In concentrating their efforts on suppressing rumors, which they consider
 to be one of the most damaging of counterrevolutionary activities, the"Commu-
 nists, after arresting rumormongers, hold meetings to "squeeze out" confessions
 from them. They are also pushing campaigns to Study curxent.events and'.to.,gtit-
 law listening to the Voice of America broadcasts.
 Li Sha, in his previously mentioned article, "Smash Counterrevolutionary
 Rumors," advocated the following methods:  Intensify the campaign against ru-
 mors and to uncover rumormongers; in areas where rumors have been eliminated,
 or where rumors are not prevalent, start the movement to study current events
 to raise the cultural and political level of the cadres and the masses so that
 they can recognize false rumors; and consolidate propaganda forces and inten-
 sify propaganda activities.
 Wang Hui-ping, in his previously mentioned article "Unify the Movement to
 Study Current Events With the Campaign to Smash Counterrevolutionary Rumors in
 Mukden," said:  "The excellent work of the public security personnel in imple-
 menting the movement to study current events to combat counterrevolutionary ru-
 mors has raised the political consciousness of the people, has contributed to-
 ward the understanding of current events, and has given the people peace of
 mind."

 In the drive against listening to the Voice of America, the Tientsin
 Jih-pao of 24 November 1950 carried the following letter to the editor:
 "We in Tientsin are in the midst of the "Resist US, Assist Korea, Pro-
 tect Homes, and Defend Nation" and the "Patriotic Production Emulation"
 drives.  Every citizen must realize that the US imperialists are wicked
 and dangerous enemies.  Since Korea is our friendly neighbor, we are obli-
 gated to help her people.  respite this emergency we are subjected to
 enemy rumors.  The main source of these rumors is the Voice of America.
 Those who listen to the Voice of America cannot distinguish lies from
 truths.  As a result, they start foolish rumors.  They thus inadvertently
 become propaganda agents for the enemy.  The Voice of America is an in-
 strument of the US imperialists to propagandize false and calumnious-ru-
 mors to the peoples of the world.  Therefore, for the good of everyone, we
 propose that the Central People's Government ban listening to the Voice-of-
 America type of radio program."
 The Mukden Tung-pei Jih-pao of 20 November 1950 stated editorially
 that the people must be responsible for maintaining security and reporting
 rumormongers to the proper authorities.
 Wang Hui-ping, in the above-mentioned article, recommended the fol-
 lowing methods for stopping rumors:
 First, organize a mass "crush the counterrevolutionary rumors"
 meeting.  Since counterrevolutionists are forced to confess their guilts
 before the audience, such meetings help to impress the masses with the dan-
 gers of listening to and believing in counterrevolutionary rumors.  Before
 going into the confessions part of the program, the chairman should create
 the proper atmosphere by exposing the real nature of counterrevolutionists
 by giving the facts about the rumors they spread, and by openly analyzing
 and criticizing their actions.  The chairman should also point out that
 these destructive elements create false rumors to mislead and confuse the
 people, that it is done in conduction with the aggressive war expanding to-
 ward our border by the US imperialists, and that to counter false rumors
 it is important for everyone to have a correct understanding of current
 events.
 The meetings should then go into the confessions part of the program.
 The counterrevolutionary rumormongers are made to confess their guilt, to ex-
 plain the purpose of such rumors, and the damage the rumors have inflicted on
 the people.  Speeches should be made by those who were tricked into believing
 counterrevolutionary rumors.  Finally, a responsible government official
 should officially announce that spreading false rumors is unlawful, and that
 rumormongers are enemies of the people.  Minor offenders should be given a
 chance to right their wrongs, but major offenders should be sent to the proper
 authorities to be punished in accordance with the law.
 To carry out anti-rumor meetings effectively, thorough preparation
 should be made beforehand.  Responsible officials from various offices should
 hold a preparatory conference -to decide the aim of the meeting, the method of
 directing the meeting, etc.  They should classify prevalent rumors according
 to nature and categories; they should systematically organize grievances result-
 ing from hearing and believing false rumors submitted by the people's represen-
 tatives, and should find the best method of agitating the people so that they
 will voluntarily stand up and speak out against rumormongering.
 Nast, organize a mass antirumor campaign.  Besides holding various
 forms of antirumor meetings, it is necessary to appeal to everyone to report
 rumors to the public security agencies so that investigations can be made.
 Everyone should be made responsible for exposing the source of rumors.  In this

 The New York Rua-ch'iao Jih-pao of 1 March 1951, published the decree of
 the Central People's government on the suppression of counterrevolutionary ac-
 tivities in China.  The new law, known as the "Law of the People's Republic of
 China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionists," was drafted by Peng Chen,
 vice-chairman of the Political and Law Committee of the Government Administra-
 tion Council.  It was passed at the 11th administrative conference of the Coun-
 cil on 20 February 1951, and approved and promulgated by Mao Tse-tung the fol-
 lowing day.
 In urging the passage of the new law, Pang Cheng asserted that the govern-
 ment must no longer be magnanimous and lenient toward counterrevolutionary ele-
 ments who are enemies of the people and who are trying to disrupt so-ial order
 within China.
 The complete text of the new decree, as published. in the above-mentioned
 Hua-ch'iao Jih-pao, is as follows:
 This law was drafted in accordance 'with Article 7 of the Common Program
 and adopted by the People's Political Consultative Conference of China for the
 purpose of punishing counterrevolutionary criminals, suppressing counterrevolu-
 tionary activities, and consolidating the People's Democratic Dictatorship.
 Article 2
 All counterrevolutionary crimes committed for the purpose of overthrowing
 the People's Democratic Dictatorship or sabotaging the people's democratic pro-
 gram shall be punished in accordance with the regulations stipulated herein-
 after.

 way, everyone can be aroused, to take active part in the campaign against the
 enemy.  But such a campaign should be properly guided and its work consoli-
 dated under the leadership of the public security agencies.  In factories,
 reports should be made to factory heads and peace-preservation iepartments.
 In ch'u, chieh, or tao, reports should be made to the ch'u government and
 a branch office of the public security bureau.
 People should neither exaggerate.nor minimize rumors; they :should take a
 serious,, responsible.,. and cautious attitude. A distinction..ab ild tie..mei6i ibetveen
 real rumormongers and those who merely spread rumors due to ignorance of facts.
 Careless questioning and arrests should be avoided to prevent unnecessary ap-
 prehension among the people which may give the counterrevolutionists and sub-
 versives an opportunity to exploit the situation.
 Finally, organize a propaganda campaign to study current events. All
 available party, youth corps, and union propaganda men should be mobilized
 from factories, offices, schools, and people's organized groups.  They should
 formulate propaganda plans and methods.  By the use of bulletin boards, car-
 toons, posters, plays, and songs, they should propagandize the movement to
 study current events in cultural institutions, newspaper reading rooms, lei-
 sure-time study classes, and various meetings.  People then will acquire a
 basic knowledge of the international situation and their political conscious-
 ness will be promoted.
