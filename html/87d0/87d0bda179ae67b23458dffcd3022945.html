 Priefly Toted
 iaicoms Condemn Yugoslav "Capitalism"
 A recent release by the llewwr China News Agency (I1 1A)
 summarized a  ed1 Flag article which charged that Yugoslavia's
 economy has t? agene:catecl into a capitalist economy" and
 assailed "a,hrt hchev and his follotvors for stubbornly
 asserting" that the .'ugoslav econoziy is socialist.  Red Flag
 pros-,anted "facts" to prove that the relationship between
 "the Tito group" and Yugoslav work-.1:?s 1  that of 'lei ploityr
 and exploited - ruler and ruled."  By endorsing Yugoslav
 policies, aeci ?'lag statecd, the Coviet leaders are introducing
 in the USEhrave danger of the restoration of capital-
 ism.,'
 Yugoslavia is still a Communist state, although the
 Chinese are correct in saying that the Yugoslav economy has
 shifted in a number of ways from Lewin-Stalin doctrine.
 The Yugoslav economy has many unorthodoir feature;, such as
 workers councils and open markets, and state controls are
 more intslli ently used.   The most significant feature is the
 Yugoslav government's effort to let the  l mar!:et -- not administra-
 tive rulings alone -- play a role in deciding how resources
 should be allocated.  What the Chinese c1o not mention is that
 Yugoslav economic well-being, both national and per capita,
 has risen steadily and in direct proportion to the ree- me's
 lessening of executive force as an instrument to shape the
 economy.
 Mlile the base from which the Yugoslav economy started
 was low and percentage growth therefore high, the improvement
 is nonetheless; noteirorthy.  The Yugoslavs' 1963 "Social Plan"
 called for an increase in the "Social Product" (equivalent
 to Gross National Product) of 0.3% over 1962.  The increase
 achieved was 1n%.  The 1963 living standard went up sharply
 in such terms as Real Personal Income (up 7.6%a over 1062 in-
 stead of the planned 4.5%) and Personal Consumption (up 7 -
 over 1062 instead of the planned 4           The 1964 Social
 elan calls for continuing increases in each of these categories
 over the 1002 Plan, and there is every indication that the
 goals will be met, as the Yugoslav Social Plans tend more and
 more to be built un from below rather than dictated by executive
 fiat from above.
 To non--Communist audiences vie air this evidence of the
 CC?0 doggedly demanding the imposition of economic authori-
 taria.nisr, along with political dictatorship In other countries
 in spite of the superiority demonstrated by even a part of the
 free enterprise system, the free market, wherever the latter
 has been allowed to coipete with doctrinaire Harxist economic
 methods.  s7e point out that this amounts to a clear ne ation

 A Case of Co_:aaiunist '. erf i.dy.
 Ieinz Brandt, editor of the ;'lest German raetal workers'
 trade union paper, flew to 'last Berlin in June 1001 to cover
 a congress for Lis passer but vanished.  A weer; later the East
 German news agency A.D1I announced that he had been arrested as
 a Western agent.  Following a secret trial by the East German
 Supreme Court, a 13-year prison sentence was announced on May
 10, 1062.
 Brandt was a veteran Communist who spent 11 years in Nazi
 concentration ca?.ips. After 1945, he worried in the CP propa-
 ganda department In 3ast Berlin.  He was purged for "deviat: on-
 ism" in l?05t_.   In 1953, the Brandt faxily, including three
 Graz lam. children, fled to West Germany because of the impending
 danger of arrest for political reasons.  11-:(is abduction from
 lest Berlin in 1:61 set off a continuing chain of protests by
 international organizations and leading 117ectern figures.
 Brandt was released and permitted to return to West Germany
 on 20 May 1^04.  Shedding some light on the I'idnapping, he re-
 ported that on 16 June 1951 he had a neeting with a West Berlin
 woman who had been introduced to him earlier by Beyerlein, a
 I'iest German petal wor.rers' union functionary.  Shortly before
 leaving the woman's hone, she offered Brandt a drink which con-
 tained a drug.  Brandt collapsed in the street but remembers
 that 4 men carne up to hina, stating:   "VIe have been waiting for
 you."  Brandt cape to in a building of the East German State
 Security Service.
 In a letter dated 14 May 1964, postmar1ed in Vienna on
 13 nay, i.e. prior to any news about Brandt's in-pending release,
 Beyerlein informed his i?nJ.on that lie was terminating his employ-
 ment effective June 70 a.%,d would erpIti.u his action in "due
 cour:3e."  In the me^. tir~e, leg .l prf ~c ~ v~aag s have been instituted
 agalast Beyerlein ico :~ all red 1.ssis t4-area in the kidnapping.
 Beyerlein's rrhereaboats are unknown at this writing.
 According to the union, Beyerlein became a Nazi ?arty
 :aeanber in 1925, was throvn out of the ?arty in 1950 but sought
 desperately to be re-admitted.  Be ,.rtererd the Coraralunist -Party
 in 1945 and remained a me:.gaber until 1955.  Since September 1957
 he had beer- in the employ of the metal workers' union in a train-
 ing capacity, and had worked in another union since 1050.    is
 earlier Cyr membership was known to the metal workers'. union.
 Brandt reported some details about his imprisonment and
 trial.e had been assured his release if he were willing to
 declare that he came to Nast Germany voluntarily, would induce
 his family to follow hi i, and renounce publicly his political
 activities in the West.  Brandt had given Beyerlein so=jae docu-
 ments for safe'.-.eeping before a vacation trip, the contents on
 which were used a ainst him in the trial.

 The Brandt case c1e?,ionstrates again that a persistent,
 unusual volute of protests -- in this case German and inter-
 national, e.g. 1=, 110, ted Cross, many leading international
 fi;ures, including; Bertrand 2ussell who returned the Fast German
 VIPC affiliates' medal because of Brandt's imprisonment, etc. --
 against Communist illegality and inhumanity can cause embarrass-
 ment to Communist regimes and force painful decisions on them.
 But the Brandt affair is also a vivid illustration of Communist
 tactics of subversion and violence and should be used as a re-
 ninder that peaceful co-existence policies notwithstanding,
 Co.;nnunist goals and tactics do not change fundamentally.
 lm artial Answer to Panama Charges.  The International Co:uUssion
 of  Jurists' committee ? three -- from the Netherlands, Sweden
 and India -- investigated charges by the National Bar Association
 of ""?anama that the United States had violated the Human 'E-fights
 Declaration in the rioting which was set off last January over
 flying the Panamanian flag in the Canal Zone.  The Jurists, an
 unofficial organization of judges, lawyers and professors of lava
 in most of the non-Communist countries (recognized by the United
 Nations and with its seat in Geneva) absolved the United States
 of any such violation and found the Government of ?anama negli-
 gent in its handling of the riots which were inflamed and ex-
 tended by organized Corasnunist activity.
 The jurists noted that this was "one of the first occasions"
 on which '.ey provisions of the Universal Declaration of Huiian
 Eights were "invo7ed and construed authoritatively."  They sug-
 gested that this may be "a major contribution" to the evolution
 of a workable international jurisprudence.  Certainly it is a
 precedent for future opportunities to make use of such an organi-
 zation in peaceful, juridical solutions to similar emotional con-
 flicts with potentially ugly international consequences.

 Spanish, is attached herewith for those stations which vie believe

 you do not wish a copy, via will supply you with one or more im-

 Principal Develop;i.ents:
 1.  Soviet leaders and  te:li.a continued to denounce the
 Chinese anc push for an early international conference,
 supported by the :?olish 'party Congress (June 111.-23) as Polish
 boss Go~iu1_ra caste out st ?on ly for such a conference with
 prope ^ pre1oar .tion but without alloying a fevi parties to delay
 it unreel sonably.  Y'Ioviever, the -1i3portant Rumanians, Yugoslavs
 an'  Italians refused to yield.
 2.  The 11umanian rebellion against Soviet domination led
 to at least three pole:  cal attac'-os on Soviet policies during
 this ne ^io-' -- one broacast and two published.  The broadcast
 did not identify the Soviets; t?3e first article used the East
 C ernans as tlhipping boys;  but the mla,j or  12, 33 3-fiord  article on
 June 13     naiad Soviets in speci: is charges.   (See Chrono,

 3.  'tigoslav ?resident Tito stooped in Leningrad on his

 indicate that the two Tito visits viere related and that the

 Significa.n e;
 This period has seen fzrther evidence of Soviet efforts to
 Promote a world. Coaunist conference, with one concrete gain in
 the tender o:  strong support by ?oland's Gomnul'.a  unanimously
 confirmed in his leadership by his ?arty 's congress .  EEoweve,
 the "hard-core" and vitally important hold-outs -- the  u;nanians,
 Yugoslavs, and Italians -- seemed to grow evermore determined
 in their resistance, and Tito stated flatly that such a con-
 ference will not be held at this time.  Obviously, prospects
 for a conf ^rence have ;.roan no less confused.
 On the other side, at least two important Asian parties
 which had triad to maintain neutrality -- the Indonesians and
 the North Vi etaa; iese -- seem to be closing rands more solidly
 with the Chinese.

 CI 0NOL0'GY -- COIMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #31
 6-19 June 1964
 Max (dela ed :   The lead article of the Bulgarian Party's monthly
 theoretical journal Novo Vreme, devoted to the unity of the WCM and the
 Chinese CP., reveals se r 6u  concern with the danger of Chinese influence
 and propaganda,  it states that Chinese propaganda material in tular an
 is sent to Bulgaria' from the U.S.A.
 2 (delayed.):  No. 15 of the Amsterdam bi-weekly De B rug, organ
 t                                                                        of
 t Dutch  o ia'ist;Workers' Party (dissident Communist), carries a 3-
 column article 4,n the nes 1y-appearing anonymous Dutch pro-Chinese dis-
 sident Communist publication De 1 ode Vla$ `(see Chrono #28, April 20 for
 first reports). De Bru.'describes the      publications as "a sloppily
 stenciled sheet" which is "published by representatives of Chinese Com-
 munist views in the CPN.'  It admits the possibility that De Roue Pleag
 could be published by the Binnenlandse"Veiligheidsdienst (Internal
 Security Service) to increase confusion in the C'N, but "as long as
 there is no proof, we hold to the opinion that it is the Chinese."
 June ,5 and continun :  A series of further "independence" moves by the
 Rumanians inc.la e:   1) a June 5 article in the leading Rumanian economic
 journal Viata Economica by Chief Editor Murgescu attacking a "recent"
 article by East derman economist'Willl Kunx under auspices GDR Academy
 of Sciences on Bas,ic Problems of International Economic Collaboration
 between CEMA Membexs," reiterating the familiar Rumanian arguments a-
 gainst economic superstates; (2) a Radio Bucharest domestic broadcast on
 the 5th which c~~rectly rebutted and denounced a May 30'Radio Moscow Ru-
 manian-language' broadcast entitled "Let Us Strengthen the Socialist Com-
 munity" -- although RM was identified only as "a foreign radio station";
 (3) a major attack (12,000 words) in the June 13 issue of Viata'Economica
 against Soviet economists (identified by name) for proposing to establish
 Lower Dantube,"ipte~stete'economic complexes" which would mean "violation
 of the territorial integrity of Rmania, dismemberment of its unity as
 a nation and state' (the Soviet article referred to is published along-
 side this rebuttal -- Chinese style); and Rumanian press announcement
 on the 18th of a June 16, amnesty for 2,500 political prisoners,' with addi-
 tional a=estie, i  preparation so that by August 23 (date set for cele-

 "there will be practically no more political prisoners in Rumania."

 to be forcibly or hastily convened...."  Peking Peo les' Dail publishes

 June 8:  No. 11 of the Chinese CP theoretical journal Red Fla  features
 major article "Yugoslav Agriculture Is Going Down the Road of Capitalism"
 by Shih Tung-hsiang, following another article by the same writer in the
 previous issue on "the degenerate state of the Yugoslav economy."  The
 Chinese Peoples Association'for Cultural. Relations with Foreign Countries
 issues a statement denouncing the  unwarranted attack" and 'fantastic
 calumnies" hurled at the'CCP and the Chinese Government by an article in
 the Czech Party daily Rude travo of`24 May and a speech by Czech First
 Secretary ~Novo,~tn  on 2  May.  The Czechs "slandered China as having 'dis-
 -txibuted slanderous and provocative letters to incite opposition to the
 leadership of other'Communist parties,'"' etc.  (See Chrono, May 25).
 But, Peking says, "the two letters     are forgeries, pure and simple.
 They are so crudely forged 717 the holes in them are so glaring that the
 forgery can be detected at a glance%"  The statement describes clues which
 demonstrate the forgeries, and adds that "if Rude 'ravo and the Czechoslovak
 leader had the least Vol'itical seriousness, the matter could have been
 easily clarified,"}__ also 'that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 had      so 7 on eiaMaa 1964, when the Czech Ambassador to China made a
 r groundless charlodged a protest against China in connection with
 the first forged letter."  By their actions, concludes the statement, the
 Czechs "have placed thernseJves in the position of collaborators of those
 who forged the letters.",

 Junes-10 and 11-12:       The Indonesian' Party daily Harian Rakjat carries in
 two installments on 9-10 a major speech by Second Vice Chairman  Njoto at
 the Aliarcham Political Academy on 3 June on the subject:  "To Strive for
 the Victory of thelndonesian Revolution With the Weapon of Dialectical and
 Historical Materialism."  He denounces the pragmatism of the modern re-.
 visionists who "have gone so far as to abolish the revolutionary spirit of
 Marxist theory and even cast away Marxiot theory itself....From here we can
 .oily see through the hypocritical faces of the renegades of Ma=im The revisionists 'are pe ?6,ntic and very arogant.  They re-
 gard themsel.ves``as great theoreticians; take themselves as cor-
 rect, look down'upbn the opinions of others, and are afraid of
 being criticized.  They lose their temper very easily.  They
 look at the`k=orld from an ivory tower -- perhaps the ivory
 tower of the'" workers ino-~tement 1.... In their opinion, the area
 of Asia, Africa and Latin America is a "bac urard area" without
 any contribution to :rbrld civilization. ...They do not educate
 the masses"to have self-confidence; what they are doing is
 teaching people`to depend on`others. ...In the face of "the weak"
 they put on airs, like wolves before the sheep; but in the face
 of the imperialists  'they act like sheep before the \rolves.
 Starting from their philosophy of pragmatism, their measure
 of what is right and.'wrong is whether it is useful for them or
 not....          a                9,
 We may use the works of Marx, 'Engels, Lenin, Stalin,
 Mao Tse-tung,' and'Aidit, in the Indoneeian version .... The well-
 known writerAnna'Louise Strong, to whom Bung Karno has paid
 high tribute, told me last year that according to her view
 there are stt`present in the world three revolutionary leaders
 whose languageis;the language: of the people:  they are Mao

 793.  3 Seote,ibar :  2 th Anniversary of the Outbreak of World
 17 ar I
 25X1ClOb
 BACKGROUND:   The year 1964 has been marked by an unusual
 number of  new memoirs, new commemorations and new controversies
 concerning World War II.  This rehashing of history affords Com-
 munist propagandists handy opportunities during the quarter-
 century anniversary to clean up Moscow's soiled image in the
 eyes of new generations and less sophisticated individuals.
 Scholarly attempts by historians to identify the single
 or primary "cause" for the outbreak of war     1939       thus
 far not been successful.  Hitler is generr.?-'. Q} <  i- i~ti i:h lion's
 share of blame, though the objective consent s is that EEitler's
 aims were greatly supported by Stalin as well as by Western
 myopia and diplomatic errors.  A prime factor that is too often
 ignored or glossed over is that Hitler and his Third Reich could
 not have come to power in any case without the support of the
 German Communist Party, acting under   rec  ons from Moscow.
 Altho-Ugh  causes  leading to       can be trace   act along
 numberless lines, it is unnecessary to look further than the
 events of the year 1939 itself to demolish the Kremlin's claims
 to anti-Fascism, "love of peace" or international good faith.
 The relatively peaceful period of the winter of 1933-9
 which the apparent success of Munich had bestowed on the nations
 of Europe was shattered by Hitler's brutal takeover of dis-
 nembered Czechoslovakia in March, 1939.  Everything thereafter
 in international relations in Europe flowed directly or indi-
 rectly from this grave violation of the pledged word by the
 German dictator.  With the Nazi occupation of Prague it had be-
 come quite clear that Eitler was not concerned with the revision
 of the Versailles Treaty nor with the principle of national self-
 determination, but simply with naked conquest.
 The destruction of Czeclioslovaltia revealed the Nazi's true
 intentions and led to British guarantees to Poland and other
 States in East Europe.  By the summer of 1939 all the great pow-
 ers in Europe had entered into firm political and military en-
 gageT:ients with one exception - the Soviet Union.  Both sides
 then attempted to obtain the support of the Soviet Union, the
 one Power which still enjoyed a certain freedom of movement and
 decision.  The diplomatic struggle for Soviet support took place
 wide range of documentation supports this point.  Four books
 that bear it out are:  Soviet Espionage, Dallin; Russia and
 the West Under Lenin an  Stalin,  ennan; A Century of "on,  ict,
 :_ ossony; and    e _ o cs o   otalitarian sm,  o n A.  Arms rong

 on two fronts:   the one more or less public; the other quite
 secret. On the visible front, the Western Powers sought to
 bring the Soviet Union into a defensive system to prevent fur-
 ther aggression by IUi.tler.  The possibility of the two ideo-
 logically hostile totalitarian States coming together on ques-
 tions pertaining to the Eastern European States was considered
 out of the question by the Vest.  The German efforts to secure
 Soviet support took place on the secret front, though they are
 now known to a very large extent from the published archives*
 of the German Foreign Office.   These efforts centered on the
 fact that Poland was the next victim on Hitler's schedule of
 conquest, and he desired to forestall interference by the Soviet
 Union, or even to induce it to join in the attack on Noland.
 T7hether the actual moving force behind the Ger-pan-Soviet
 pact of 1333 was primarily Nazi or Soviet will probably never
 be known fog certain in the absence of f i. rs -- t ~~ nd  e ~'ideY~ ce as
 to the secret intentions of Soviet forei~,n 'k:::.icy at ti-  tim3.
 At the end of July, however, the Germans con-Li.-anted the Soviets
 with a clear alternative:  what could Britain offer the Soviet
 Union, afid what could Germany?  Britain could at best offer
 participation in a iuropean war and the enmity of Germany,whi h
 could. scarcely be worth-while goals for Eussia.  Germany, on
 the other hand, could offer "neutrality and the hope of staying
 out of a possible European coif list, and, if Moscow wished, a
 German-Pussian understanding on matters of mutual interest which
 would be to the advantage of both countries as in earlier times."**
 The secret agreement according to which the whole political
 system of Eastern and Central Europe sang to be divided between
 Germany and the Soviet Union was beginning to take shape.
 Amongst other factors which had long affected Nazi actions
 was the desire to avoid a war on two fronts.  Their scheme had
 been to destroy or neutralize all potential enemies on Germany's
 eastern border before opening an attack on the West.  Faced with
 Japan's aggressive attitude and the undeclared Soviet-Japanese
 17ar, Moscow had similar causes for apprehension.  Thus the two
 mowers ended by helping each other out of the snares they had
 laic? or were on the point of laying for each other.
 Stalin's Foreign Minister Molotov signed the German-Soviet
 treaty of non-aggression with Hitler's Foreign Minister nib-
 bentrop on 23 August.   He also signed the secret appendix which
 divided the spheres of interest of Ritler's Germany and Stalin's
 US U in Eastern and Central Europe.  17estern statesmen did not,
 at least openly, challenge the Soviet contention that the pact
 was for "peaceful" purposes or point out its political and legal
 meaning -- i.e. that each side was thereby free to concentrate
 a  ression against third nations.
