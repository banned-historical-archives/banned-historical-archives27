 A SOURCE PAPER ON AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES-
 COLLECTIVES IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 The Chinese Communist regime maintains that the development
 of China into an industrialized state can best be achieved through
 implementation of its agrarian program.  This, it claims, can
 only be done if agriculture prospers because the raw materials
 on which industry depends must be :'urnished by the peasants.
 The regime promised the peasants that they would be landowners
 in their own name, and that the products sold on the markets would
 benefit them by raising their standard of living.   It also claimed
 that wages paid to workers would enable them to live comfortably,
 and that industrial goods produced would be within the reach of
 all.   China thus would be self-sufficient and ultimately produce
 all commodities necessary for the well being and comfort of its
 citizens.
 The attached documentation shows, however, that forced collectivi-
 ,zation of the agrarian population of Red China has not produced the
 utopia promised to the nation.  The agrarian program has resulted
 in discontent and growing restlessness on the part of the popula-
 tion.  The regime has blatantly disregarded its promises to the
 people whose needs it has proven unable to anticipate.
 Farmers are not interested in cultivating their crops for a
 regime which is bleeding them white.   Available evidence indicates
 that they are malingering in their tasks, deserting their harvests
 and view the future without hope.  Prices are rising, food is
 becoming scarce, industrialization is hampered and unemployment
 is wide-spread.   Crime is increasing, desertions from the agricul-
 tural producers'                    cooperatives (APC's  are numerous and armed re-
 volts are prevalent.   Consequently this program, unworkable in a
 country predominantly agrarian, cannot serve as a model for other
 nations anxious to increase their agricultural potential.
 Chairman MAO Tse-tung, in side-stepping the Red hierarchy by
 forcing acceleration of collectivization, may have made a monu-
 mental mistake which might trigger a movement that could ultimately
 sweep him from control and possibly restore China to the Free
 World.   The agrarian situation in China,  as revealed in the at-
 tached documentation, bears careful scrutiny during the coming
 months.

 A SOURCE PAPER ON AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES-
 COLLECTIVES IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 I.   Agrarian Program
 Totalitarian countries have long recognized the necessity of
 rigid control over their peasants, e-specially when they constitute
 the majority of the nation.   Communist China is no exception.
 The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued
 on 15 December 1951, the first draft decision on mutual-aid and
 cooperation in agricultural production.   This measure was designed
 not only to control peasants politically but also to enforce govern-
 ment regulations concerning the collection of taxes,  the percentage
 of farm products to be  sold by the government at stipulated rates,
 the share to be retained by the peasant,  the kinds and quantities
 of crops to be grown, and the sum to be paid for labor performed.
 When this draft decision was issued, there were already approxi-
 mately 300 agricultural producers'  cooperatives (APL's)  in Communist
 China.   On 16 December 1953,  when the number of APC's had grown to
 14,000,  the Party Central Committee issued its decision regulations
 which stated that, between the winter of 1953 and the autumn of
 1954,  the cooperatives should be increased to 35,800.   Statistically,
 the number reached 100,000.
 The Central Committee, at its October 1954 meeting,  decided
 to increase the cooperatives to 600,000,  Of the 670,000 actually
 formed,  20,000 were eliminated  iLn June 1955 because they were not
 functioning properly.   These ccoooperat.ives, mainly in the northern
 provinces, were composed of 16,900,000 households.
 In the spring of 1955 the Central Committee urged the forma-
 tion of one million cooperatives.   However, MAO Tse-tung,  in a
 speech on 31 July 1955,  not only complained about the  slow forma-
 tion of these cooperatives, but ordered that they should be
 speeded up rapidly, with a 1960 deadline for the collectivization
 of all peasants, and a 1962 deadline for transforming all agri-
 cultural enterprises into state--operated farms.
 Consequently, by December :1955 the membership in the APL's
 reached 1,900,000.   In January .1.950,  this time-table was changed
 in a draft program of agricultural development submitted by the
 Politburo of the Central Committee for 1956-1957, ordering the
 completion of socialization of Chinese farming by the end of 1958.
 The regime claimed in December :i95E0 that 96 per cent of all farm
 households had been enrolled in cooperatives, and that fully
 four-fifths of the cooperative farmers were in the collectives.
 Six stages were announced by the government in the regimenta-
 tion of the rural population.  Five stages have more or less
 been completed while the  sixth stage is to be developed slowly,
 because it depends on mechanization.

 The first stage was the confiscation of the land of large land-
 owners and wealthy farmers and its distribution to land-poor
 peasants.
 The second stage was the formation of mutual-aid teams.   In
 this stage, neighboring families pooled their labor, animals and
 implements for particular tasks during certain seasons, but the
 peasant remained an individual agent.
 The third stage was the formation of an APC.  Land and farm prop-
 erty were pooled and the individual peasant was paid a share of the
 produce based on labor performed and the value of the capital contri-
 bution invested.

 II.   Problems Resulting from the Agrarian Program
 A. Failure of Government to Carry Out Promises and Regulations
 The Chinese Communist Goverr.:ment, in the development of its
 agrarian program, assured the farmer that he is free to join or
 reject the state-sponsored organizations.   If he joins voluntarily,
 his right of private ownership of land and equipment will not be
 abrogated.   These principles are clearly stated in the following
 promises,  decisions and regulations made by the leaders of Red China.
 1.   MAO Promises Private Owrership
 MAO Tse-tung,  in his work On Cooperatives published in 1943,
 said:    With a transformation of the individual form of pro-
 duction to a collective form of production, it would
 still be impossible to increase labor productivity.
 Thus it is imperative that we develop cooperative
 labor organizations on the basis of private economy,
 that is,  the private ovirership of property by individual
 producers will not be destrroyed.   Only by so doing we
 greatly increase labor productivity in agriculture....
 This kind of transformation   .. is a revolution in
 method of production.
 2.   Vice Chairman LIU's Views
 Addressing the First National Conference of Representatives
 of Cooperative Workers, Vice-Chairman LIU Shao-ch'i said:
 It would be a leftist deviation if we operate the
 cooperatives like state-owned stores.  On the other
 hand, it would be a rightist deviation if we manage
 cooperatives like private stores.  We should deviate
 neither to the left nor to the right; we should oper-
 ate the cooperatives in the strictly correct way.
 This is a basic principle governing the operation
 of all cooperatives.  We must not deviate from this
 principle.   If we do, our cooperatives would not look
 like real cooperatives.
 3.  Organizational Regulations Stress Voluntary Principle
 The People's Practical Economic, Dictionary-  Cooperatives in
 China (published in Shanghai, 1953),  defines the
 principles
 governing the organization of cooperatives as follows:
 p    [qtass line must be followed in the admission
 of new members into cooperatives.   Only working people
 (i.e.,  workers,  peasant::., and individual producers)
 should be admitted into cooperatives....
 The voluntary principle should be followed in the
 organization of cooperatives....   Compulsory member-
 ship and commandism are  strongly rejected in the
 organization of any cooperative.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02771 R000300180002-5
 CPYRGHT
 The mass line must be followed.  A cooperative must
 be organized according to democratic procedures....
 The policy that cooperatives should serve the interests
 of their members must be followed faithfully at all
 times.  The profit-seeking motive of the capitalists
 must be rejected by all cooperative members.  Those
 who try to make profits in the name of the cooperative
 must be expelled.
 Agricultural producers' cooperatives are an advanced
 phase of collective production.  They can be organized
 only when there is machinery.  When small peasant
 holdings still prevail in the countryside, it is really
 impossible to urge farmers to organize into agricultural
 producers' cooperatives.   In the first place, the
 peasant masses would not respond to such a call.   In
 the second place, state industry is still not in a posi-
 tion to provide the peasants with sufficient modern
 agricultural implements.   Without large-scale invest-
 ment by the state, agricultural producers' cooperatives
 cannot be organized, and will not operate successfully
 even if they are organized. Thus at the present time,
 China's agricultural production problem is not how to
 organize agricultural producers' cooperatives, but how
 to use the supply and marketing cooperatives as a means
 to stimulating production.  Mutual aid-teams also
 operate with the help of supply and marketing cooper-
 atives....  No compulsion should be used to promoting
 such mutual-aid teams; farmers must be allowed to parti-
 cipate in such teams voluntarily.
 These promises, however, were quickly forgotten and completely
 abandoned in the head-long rush of forcing the farmer into the
 collectives and stripping from him not. only the ownership of
 his farm, but also of his implements, his livestock, grain, seeds
 and fruit trees

 B.   Coercion Used to Implement Agrarian Program
 The following documentation indicts the Red leaders for
 deliberately violating their promises and forcing collectivization
 on the peasants.
 1.   Foreign Observers Report Force Used
 Five independent accounts from different sources charge the
 People's Republic of China with using force to compel its farmers
 to join the APC?s.
 a.   Chaudhry Rahmatullah, a prominent Pakistani labor
 leader who headed a Pakistani Trade Union Delegation to Com-
 myp,($na, wrote in The Comment (Karachi, 21 July 1956)
 Throughout my trip, i did riot see any concre e ex-
 amples of development, progress or advancement to
 benefit the peasants who make up 85 percent of
 China's 500,000,000 population....  During my long
 Journeys in China I did not. witness any proof of
 modernization nor did I see the tractors, tubewells
 and other modern agricultural implements.  The situa-
 tion in villages is much less pleasant than in the
 cities.  There is no doubt that some land reform of
 a drastic nature has taken place; the Communists
 have uprooted all the landlords, who, according to
 them, were strangling the poor peasants.  However,
 the size of holdings in the villages is so small
 that it is very difficult for a family to make ends
 meet.  Besides they have to pay the taxes and their
 quotaswto the Government and thus the Communist
 Government has replaced the exacting landlord.   Peas-
 ant discontent in different parts of China is increas-
 ing....  The peasants who once were promised land
 with all sorts of rights and-who were the backbone
 of the revolution on the basis of these promises are
 now being deprived of these lands which are distributed
 to them.  The Communist Party workers are ordered to
 lead the peasants towards collectivization.  The
 slogan of "land to tillers'' has vanished and is never
 mentioned, and according to the orders of the Central
 Committee of the Communist Party, the land has come
 back to the State again.  While industry flourishes
 in the great developmental schemes, the farmer is
 left to feed the hungry nation with little help from
 his Government, with no effects at modernization and
 the constant yellings of the Communist Party bureau-
 crats in his ear.
 b.  The Hindustan Time}_ (4 January 1957) commented on a
 r  b1-FRC   mittedo the Indian Co-operative Union as follows:
 On China, the report states that on "official Com-
 munist evidence" only "pro for'na results" have been
 obtained.   Peasants have been and are being made to
 Join co-operatives through force, the threat of
 force or irresistible administrative pressure exer-
 cised through discriminatory taxes and other measures.

 CPYRPHTThe Asian ,Analyst
 February 1957) cites the following.
 It is now fairly clear that in spite of the official
 call for "voluntary" formation of agricultural pro-
 ducers' cooperatives and collectives, direct and in-
 direct coercion has usually played a major part in
 the movement and provoked fierce and prolonged popu-
 lar resistance.  Thus a Party Congress report about
 Changchih special district in Shansi province---one
 of the "early-liberated" areas where "land reform"
 was complete by 1947--reveals that for two years
 afterwards a bitter internal struggle raged, reviving
 again during the Korean war:   Taoist secret organiza-
 tions were feverishly active.   In 1953 "some excesses"
 of the Party in organizing "mutual aid teams" aroused
 the peasants and "one county   almost erupted in revolu-
 tion."  In the spring of 1955 "counter-revolutionaries"
 again stirred up resistance to the monopolized purchase
 of foodstuffs by the State and to collectivization
 (Peoples Daily, 26 September).   Out of 610,000 house-
 holds In the district, 2,759 "elements" have been
 "handed over to the collectives for labor under surveil-
 lance," and 2,387 are "either serving prison sentences
 or laboring outside" the district (probably in "reform
 through labor camps").   And this took place in one of
 the most "reliable" old Communist areas in the country.
 ul  aln, w o was in Shanghai six months before
 and after the Communist take-over of the mainland and who
 revisited the new regime in 1955, made the following accusa-
 tion against the Chinese Communist government in The New
 RI   I-1113 May 1957):
 The Communist regime is busily engaged in taking
 away from the Chinese peasant the "Good Earth" which
 it had given to him.  The change is now virtually
 accomplished, and the collective system has already
 almost replaced the private ownership concept which
 was an article of faith in early revolutionary plan-

 I was in Peking in October 1955, when
 President MAO announced his collectivization plan in
 a report to the party, intimating that the first
 stage of land socialization was to be completed within
 six months, and attacking with an unaccustomed vio-
 lence those who might be inclined to resist or slow
 down his design....  Voluntary adherence by the peas-
 ants to the agricultural production cooperatives
 which preceded collectivization... existed more in
 fancy than in fact.  No sooner had MAO made his
 declaration, however, than the regime unleashed a
 violent campaign of propaganda and persuasion (a
 word which seems to have a special meaning in China).
 Collective pressure on individuals was intensified,
 and within eight days .., even millions of peasants,
 had "spontaneously" given their support to the coopera-
 tives.,,,   I have visited several agricultural coopera-
 tives, mainly in Hopei, an established agricultural
 region, Manchuria, the pilot province and Kansu, the
 Far West of the New China... it was clear from visits
 to the villages that a virtually irresistible pres-

 CPYRGHT
 The state determines what each farmer shall plant,
 fixes land taxes in advance, and decides, often in a
 quite arbitrary manner, what purchases to make in each
 village after the harvest.   Sooner or later the
 individualist peasant, having lost all liberty, will
 have no alternative but to take the "road to socialism"...
 e.   C. M. Chang in his article, "Communist China, Fact
 and Myth 14 published in The New Leade.r (24+ September 1956) had
 th   YR      concerning the c,ol7.ectives<
 The collectivization deLve has been both expensive
 and bloody.  But  no  obstacle, however formidable,
 can stop the Communist planners.   Indeed, the very
 magnitude of the obstacles means that the pace must
 be accelerated, and har,;her and still harsher methods
 will be employed.  The  Soviet experience is considered
 relevant to the Chinese situation.  Collectivization
 is, in Communist thinking, the prerequisite for social-
 ist transformation,.   And,  in the present world situa-
 tion, China must complete the process of socialist
 transformation in a hurry.
 2.   Chinese Communist Official. Admit Use of Force
 The Minister of Agriculture, LIAO Lu-yen, in an address on
 25 July 1955 to the National Congress on agricultural policies,
 disclosed the following-
 Of course, in the victorious advance of the coopera-
 tive farming campaign, ;rho-tcomings still exist.
 In some localities, mi;take'es of compulsion and vio-
 lation of the policy of voluntariness and mutual bene-
 fit have occurred.   Such shortcomings as poor opera-
 tion and administratioii and poor production organization
 also still prevail....   Some people have been heard
 to say that the peasant.'  enthusiasm in production is
 Jeopardized because of poor results in the cooperativi.-
 zation of agriculture and =door food work....
 The following year, he admitted in a report to the Third
 Session of the First People's ("ong re ss held in Peking on 15 June
 1956 that:
 ... there are still man  shortcomings and faults
 in agricultural cooperation and agricultural pro-
 duction.   In the work of c,oo-reration, there have
 been rather serious extravagance and waste and abuse
 of manpower and materiaL resources in a number of
 agricultural producers, cooperatives.  Prices fixed
 for draft animals taken into the cooperatives have
 not been fair enough and the work of tending and
 managing public livestock has been poor, leading
 to the weakening and death of draft animals....
 In the work of agriculture, a number of cooperatives
 in some places have set their targets for increased
 production higher than the technical abilities could
 encompass....

 The Chairman of the State Planning Commission, LI Fu-ch'un,
 in presenting the Five Year Plan to the First National People's
 Congress in July 1955, acknowledged that there were instances of
 d
 l
 un
 u
 y hasty and coercive practices and warned that-
 If these mistakes are not corrected production not
 only will not increase but may even decline.
 Chinese Communist Newspapers and Radio Admit Coercion
 In late 1956 a copy of the Shensi Daily News which reached
 Hong Kong reported the arrest of 100 "counter-revolutionists"
 after they had sacked a People's Council building, burned the
 records and killed the secretary in June.  The Peso le's Daily
 (Peking), commenting on the event on 23 August 195b, stated that:
 The Provincial Party Committee held between August 8
 and 16 criticised itself in familiar terms for
 "commandism" which had "aroused dissatisfaction
 among the masses and suppressed the enthusiasm of
 the peasants."
 An excerpt from the People's Daily (27 June 1956) disclosed
 the following:
 Now that the great majority of the peasants have
 joined cooperatives, local party organizers can
 terrorize them through both political and economic
 means.  They say:   "Now that the cooperatives own
 the land, we have the peasants' throat and they
 dance to our tune."
 The Kwangming Daily (Peking, 8 July 1956) admitted that:
 Many local organizers are acting illegally,  they
 are searching houses, arresting and torturing people,
 forcing couples into marriage and stealing collective
 property.
 The Kwangtung Provincial Committee of the Communist Party re-
 ported on 8 May 1957 that-
 Since last winter 117,916 households have withdrawn
 their membership in agricultural cooperatives; of
 these, however, 10,214 have rejoined.   In the course
 of consolidating the agricultural cooperatives,
 harsh measures to restrict the withdrawing members
 were used in some localities, thereby resulting in
 a certain degree of tension which should not have
 arisen....   In areas where there have been great
 economic changes and in the calamity-stricken areas,
 little has been done to improve the livelihood of
 the people.
 By the admission of the Chinese Communist leaders themselves,
 by their press and radio broadcasts, and by the testimony of
 foreign travelers who have visited Red China, the government has
 been guilty of brazenly disregarding its promises to the peasants.
 It has eliminated private ownership of farm lands and stock,
 established unequal wage standards, arbitrarily distributed
 food, and failed to provide equipment.   It also has used adminis-
 trative pressure,  coercion and commandism to herd 96 per cent
 of the Chinese farmers into state-controlled cooperatives-
 collectives.

 C.  Effects of Forced Collectivization on Peasants
 The regime has repeatedly proclaimed that its agricultural pro-
 gram will benefit the population by raising the standard of living.
 Peasants have been promised that the income of APC members will
 be increased, food will become plentiful, children of peasants
 will receive a good education and that farmers will be provided
 with machinery to lessen their drudgery.
 The following documentation indicates, however, that all these
 promises have been broken by the regime.   Peasant morale is low
 and discontent widespread among the population, undermining the
 sociological structure and threatening the economic stability of the
 country.  The failure of forced co-'lectivization to raise the standard
 ov living has resulted in large scale desertions from the APC?s and
 migration to the cities.
 1.   Peasant Morale Low and Discontent Widespread
 The morale of the peasants Is extremely low as a result of the
 forced herding of farmers into the state-controlled agrarian
 organizata~~ions.
 ~~u1lliaFnTsays in his article that -
 The peasant state of mind  in the early winter of
 1956 was conclusively revealed in the sabotage of
 the preparations for the spring crops of 1957.
 The People's Daily comp ?_ained that the cooperatives
 were not carrying out their, winter tasks; winter
 sowing was being held up and maintenance work was
 being neglected.  This was claimed to be the case
 in Shantung, where the peasants were discouraged;
 the accounts had not been feompiled and the workers
 still did not know how much they were to be paid
 for their work during the past year.  The organizers
 did not dare to push the peasants, and both workers
 and their superiors,  said the Daily, made no pretense
 at the enthusiasm which wa,3 shown when recruitment
 was initiated the previous winter.
 The People's Daily stated in November 1956 that there was a
 wider use of coercion by the authorities often "directly stimulated
 by the plans and arbitrary decisions made by the higher authorities."
 To control discontent, local organizers called "accusation meetings"
 which gave the peasants an oppo 't.uiity to voice their grievances
 and the cadres a chance to imp(-)-,e additional controls.
 The new rural bureaucracy LL?Lso was rapidly gaining in number.
 In one cooperative in Shansi there were a total of 300 officials
 for 400 homes while in another cooperative in the same area 100
 officials were being used to control 200 families.  The peasants
 were required to attend meetings lasting far into the night,
 then rise the following morning, at five for work, still tired and
 distressed.
 Local leaders often furnished false reports to their superiors.
 The cooperative accounts were badler kept because the accounting
 system was too intricate for the semi-literate peasants to compre-
 hend.  The most serious complaint by the peasants was that there
 were numerous injustices and errors in calculating their wages
 for work done.

 2.  Living Standards Low
 For the last two years, the farmers' income has decreased, as
 indicated in the following items:
 a.     The text of the Grain Distribution Directive, re-
 leased by Peking on 25 November 1956,  states that 10 per-
 cent of the members of agricultural cooperatives suffered
 "income decreases," due either to natural calamities or to
 improper management, of such severity as to cripple them
 from operating unless assisted by the regime.
 b.  The Christian Science Monitor (3 July 1957) credited
 Frank Robertson, Special Correspondent, Hong Kong, with the
 following statement:
 In spite of claims that agricultural. production
 for 1957 will reach a record of 191,000,000 tons,
 it is admitted that the revenue from collectives
 and the few private peasants :Left has fallen off
 considerably....
 A study of the Chienchin APC in Yungping County, Yunnan, showed
 that while 70.6 per cent of its total income was distributed to
 the peasants, the  were only paid 0.-i-6 yuan for each working day
 which averaged 3.4 yuan per month, proving that the peasants'
 living standards are still very low.   In this cooperative, a num-
 ber of peasants kept no hogs and not even the chicken most of
 them had before collectivization.
 The New China News Agency stated on 18 August 1956 that in a
 certain district in Kwa.ngtung Province 21 out of 87 ACP's had
 been dissolved due to living standards having been reduced.
 On 20 November Peking Radio informed its listeners that in the
 Chunli cooperative in Hupeh seven out of eight production team
 leaders were encouraging 100 members to neglect their agricul-
 tural production in favor of trade.
 Tgq''s Daily (244 August 1956), in an article on the
 cooperatives in Changsha Hsien, Hunan, said that
 a.. There are altogether 163 such co-operatives,
 which constituted 13 percent of the total number
 of cooperatives of the hsien.   Of these 163 coopera-
 tives, 71 will suffer a decrease in production
 ranging from 10 percent to 40 percent in comparison
 with last year.  None of the remaining 92 coopera-
 tives can fulfill this year's plan for increased pro-
 duction....  Over 7,000 households which are members
 of these cooperatives will, without exception, re-
 ceive less income this year than last year.  Under
 such circumstances, many cooperatives have lost
 confidence and members have become restless; 4 per-
 cent of the members have withdrawn from the coopera-
 tives; 7 percent of the members are asking to with-
 draw and 19 percent of the members have grown pessi-
 mistic and disappointed and have given up production
 work....

 This year, increased agricultural production assign-
 ments of a number of agricultural cooperatives in
 the Mienyang Special District, Szechuan Province,
 were not fulfilled satisfactorily as a result of
 improper business management.
 The World Today (Hong Kong, 1 May 1957) quoted a woman who
 recently  ed  rroomlRed China concerning conditions in the farming
 districts of Kwangtung Province:
 We were working in rural. districts mostly.  Farmers
 there were living a life e~;-en poorer than beggars.
 They were wearing patched clothes, and didn't have
 enough food to eat.   As far as we know, each of them
 was given four ounces of rice a day, and had to buy
 potatoes to make up the shortage.   Even so, each of
 them was allowed to buy only one catty of potatoes
 each day.   Each got only four ounces of oil and the
 same amount of sugar a month.  No pork was on sale.
 You can imagine how scanty their life was.
 John Roderick, in his dispatch from Hong Kong to the Washington
 Post (14 July 1957), indicates the reasons for the low standards
 of living on mainland China?
 For this was a nation beset with economic troubles,
 dissatisfied with the bureaucracy of government,
 still aching from the effort to convert itself
 from near-feudalism to ;,ocLalism.  Floods, drought
 and a disastrous 1956 typhoon had laid waste to
 millions of acres of land and brought suffering to
 70 million people.  The country had gone into debt
 partly because of the }wavy expense of bringing
 relief to ravaged area,,.  `here were still food
 shortages.   Officials E-:a.dmi lted graft and corruption
 in newly-created agricu_cltu-al. producer cooperatives.
 Party members were inc?-easingly arrogant and more
 and more concerned with their own comforts.   Party
 cadres among the union;; were inept ....
