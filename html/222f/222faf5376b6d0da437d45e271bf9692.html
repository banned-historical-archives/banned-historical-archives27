 There has been a substantial change in Poland's
 domestic and foreign circumstances since the national-
 istic "October Revolution" in 1956 and the coming to
 power of the Gomulka regime in the face of Soviet op-
 position.   The retreat from the libertarian domestic
 innovations instituted in 1956 has proceeded to the
 point where Gomulka,  formerly a barely tolerated out-
 cast in the Communist world, is now considered Moscow's
 staunchest ally.
 In terms of the Gomulka regime's goals, however,
 Poland is on course.   It is more secure than ever in
 a firm anti-German alliance with the USSR,  and it is
 influential in both the Communist and the Western
 worlds.
 The Polish party's innovative principle of "unity
 within diversity" has become an accepted theoretical
 norm--even if not always applied--for most other East-
 ern European states.   Some,  like Rumania, have pur-
 sued diversity so far down the road to national in-
 dependence that Poland today seems comparatively lag-
 gard, its policies stagnant and rigid.   Awareness of
 this contrast has contributed to a growing restive-
 ness among the Polish party and people alike, and
 constitutes a fundamental long-term threat to the
 stability of the Gomulka regime.
 In the early months of the
 Gomulka regime, domestic policies
 were libertarian to an extent
 never experienced under Communism
 in any country.   This permissive-
 ness, however, owed less to
 Gomulka's convictions than to the

 Gomulka's Poland--
 From Outcast to Ally
 Since 1956,      Gomulka has
 gradually won "Soviet acceptance
 of his ideas and policies by co-
 ordinating with Moscow his views
 on issues of primary importance
 to the USSR.   Essentially, these
 issues have concerned foreign
 policy toward the West and mu-
 tual support within the Commu-
 nist movement.   In order to ac-
 complish this, Gomulka was from
 the beginning required to reas-
 sert party control at home and
 to convince the Soviet leader-
 ship that his concept of "dif-
 ferent roads to socialism" posed
 neither a threat to the Polish-
 Soviet alliance nor an ideologi-
 cal challenge to the USSR.

 weakness of the party and the
 consequent instability of the
 Polish "experiment," as it was
 originally regarded.   Gomulka
 moved rapidly,  first to consoli-
 date his own position,  and then
 to gain Soviet confidence by re-
 building the party according to
 his own specifications.   In the
 process, he gradually eliminated
 those liberal gains of 1956 which
 he had never favored and which
 were condemned throughout the
 Communist world.   These moves in-
 volved purging both Stalinist
 and "revisionist" extremists from
 the party.   It is a measure of
 Gomulka's basic conservatism that
 he has always considered the lat-
 ter more dangerous.
 To be successful, however,
 Gomulka's efforts at consoli-
 dation depended on a change in
 Soviet attitudes toward him.   In
 October 1956, he barely avoided
 Soviet armed intervention.   To-
 day, he is vulnerable to charges
 that Moscow's friendly embrace is
 too stifling.   Russian support
 for his initially "deviationist"
 views was years in coming, how-
 ever, and involved an interact-
 ing process of Poland yielding
 to Soviet pressures and a concur-
 rent mellowing in Moscow's view
 of what was possible and proper
 in its relations with Eastern Eu-
 ropean states.
 Until late 1957, Gomulka
 refused to subscribe to Moscow's
 claims to primacy within the
 bloc and the Soviet party's in-
 sistence on unity on ideologi-
 cal issues.   His refusal stemmed
 not from opposition to these pos-
 tures as such., but from a fear
 that acceptance would compel
 full conformity in domestic pol-
 icies as well.   When Gomulka
 finally yielded--though not un--
 equivocally--on the principle of
 Soviet primacy at the November
 1957 multiparty conference in
 Moscow, he did so in return for
 guarantees of domestic party
 autonomy, which were applicable
 throughout the Communist world.
 Although the conference en-
 dorsed the principle that all
 national Communist parties are
 co-equal, a significant Soviet
 concession that led Polish
 Premier Cyrankiewicz to declare
 "the Soviet Union is now on a
 path more or less parallel to
 Poland," the Poles nevertheless
 clearly viewed this Soviet move
 in guarded terms.   By mid-1958,
 however, Gomulka seems to have
 received sufficient assurance
 about Moscow's good intentions

 to concede the second point,
 unity on major ideological is-
 sues.                     He did so by joining in
 the Soviet denunication of the
 Yugoslav "revisionism" of the
 time and by endorsing the execu-
 tion of rebel Hungarian premier
 Imre Nagy.
 These developments were ma-
 jor turning points in Polish-So-
 viet relations and  signaled a
 change in Moscow's attitude from
 grudging toleration to support.
 Soviet endorsement of Gomulka
 as a "great statesman," both at
 the 21st CPSU congress in Febru-
 ary 1959 and during Khrushchev's
 visit to Poland the following
 July, ended the period of War-
 saw's defensiveness toward Mos-
 cow and brought an increasingly
 positive'Polish role in support
 of the USSR both within and out-
 side the bloc.
 Since 1959, the Soviet lead-
 ers have shown every sign of
 considering Gomulka primus inter
 pares in Eastern Europe.   This
 has been demonstrated repeatedly
 not only in public displays of
 fraternal sentiment, but in fre-
 quent consultations prior to mu-
 tual policy decisions affecting
 both bilateral and intra-Commu-
 nist relations.   Gomulka's
 favored position was recently
 illustrated during the celebra-
 tions in Moscow of the 50th an-
 niversary of the Soviet revolu-
 tion, when he spoke immediately
 after Soviet party leader Brezh-
 nev.
 "The policy line ...[should be]...in accordance
 with  the  Leninist  principles  of proletarian  inter-
 nationalism, the observance of the equality and sov-
 ereignty of all states and nations, and the unity of the
 socialist countries and forces to oppose imperialist ag-
 gression and to defend peace."
 Gomulka speech at ninth plenum PZPR,
 15 May 1967
 "Every Communist party independently fixes
 its political line and is responsible for its policy be-
 fore its nation and the working class and nobody can
 take this responsibility from it.  But every Commu-
 nist party, which within the framework of its own
 country implements or strives to implement the uni-
 versal idea of socialism, must be characterized by pro-
 letarian internationalism....   Differences of views...
 should not undermine internationalist unity in the
 struggle against imperialism."
 Gomulka speech at Kremlin,
 3 November 1967
 and of solidarity against "im-
 perialism."   It is a measure of
 Gomulka's consistency that his
 statement in Moscow in November
 1967 should echo so closely the
 principles of bloc relations he
 had first put forward in May 1957.
 It is a paradox, however, that
 the concept which made him a
 dangerous  "deviationist" a dec-
 ade ago should now be held out
 as a minimum requirement for re-
 storing unity among states which
 Gomulka himself did so much to
 transform from a Soviet-domi-
 nated bloc to a badly splintered
 "socialist commonwealth."

 Poland no longer appears to
 be a special case within the
 Communist world.   On the con-
 trary, Gomulka's increasingly
 close alliance with the USSR has
 made it seem to many that he
 has turned his back on the legacy
 of 1956 and is out of step with
 burgeoning nationalist trends
 elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
 This view, however, mistakes
 appearances for reality.   The
 forces of nationalism take dif-
 fering paths in the countries of
 the region, and impel the Poles
 and others to employ differing
 methods.
 Gomulka has always been
 deeply aware that his regime is
 ultimately dependent on strong
 Soviet support.   Moreover, he
 has never seen any contradiction
 between Polish nationalism and
 a firm Polish-Soviet alliance,
 considering them mutually de-
 pendent.   The strong alliance
 with the USSR is thus the founda-
 tion of Polish policy, and the
 test of loyalty in Gomulka's
 Poland is adherence to his pro-
 Soviet stance.   Fundamentally as
 nationalistic as Rumania's
 Ceausescu, Gomulka understands
 Bucharest's aspirations, but he
 strongly differs over methods.
 Unlike Ceausescu, he has gained
 elbow-room for the pursuit of
 Poland's national interests by
 paying the price for Soviet con-
 sent in political compromises.
 Gomulka evidently is convinced
 that this approach will not only
 have more lasting benefits than
 Ceausescu's militancy, but will
 avoid further disunity within
 the Communist world.
 Gomulka has acted in the
 belief that Poland does not have
 the option to pursue Rumanian-
 style independence without be-
 coming a weak pawn in the power
 struggle in central Europe.   He
 views Poland's alliance with the
 USSR as historically unavoidable,
 and as the only alternative to
 another of the national disasters
 which he believes have resulted
 from past Polish alliances with
 Western powers.   His conviction
 on this score was most recently
 illustrated by his firm rejec-
 tion of President de Gaulle's
 overtures during the latter's
 visit to Poland in September.
 "What would Poland mean in the Western alli-
 ance?...                                                                                                   It would occupy a lowly place, after Eng-
 land, Germany, France, and Italy in Europe, and doz-
 ens of other states on a world scale.... In the socialist
 camp, the proportions are reversed: Poland. as the
 largest People's Democracy, is third on the list ofso-
 cialist states after the Soviet Union and China, and
 second in Europe."
 Pro-regime Catholic daily Slowo Powszechne
 22 Nlar-h 1958
 "It is our duty to tell you how we see our role
 in the building of European security, our tasks and
 our place in Europe.  In the period between the two
 world wars, Poland and France were linked with a po-
 litical and military alliance. For rnany reasons, which
 I shall not mention today,  the alliance functioned
 badly...and did not save either Poland or France from
 the catastrophe of defeat....
 "Reborn Poland has drawn all the conclusions
 from its historical experience... the entering on the
 road of friendship and alliance with its great Eastern
 neighbor, the Soviet Union. This alliance... is the cor-
 nerstone of the policy of the Polish People's Republic
 and the basic guarantee of its security.  [It] made it
 possible for Poland to find its permanent and impor-
 tant place in Europe, a place which our fatherland has
 been unsuccessfully seeking since the 18th century."

 National Interests Versus
 Communist Solidarity
 precedented commitment by Poland
 to the support of East Germany.
 After a firm Polish-Soviet
 alliance, Gomulka views Communist
 solidarity--with deference to na-
 tional aspirations--as the second
 major building block of his poli-
 cies.                         His near-obsession with
 "unity in the face of imperialism"
 is rooted in the fear that further
 diversity within the movement,
 especially in Eastern Europe, will
 ultimately affect the cohesion of
 the Polish-Soviet alliance,  and
 hence, Poland's security.   He thus
 believes that the Chinese and
 some Eastern European leaders lean
 too heavily on nationalism as the
 foundation of state policy to the
 detriment of the security to be
 gained from a stable, pro-Soviet,
 "socialist commonwealth."
 The expression of Eastern
 European nationalism evidently
 assumed alarming proportions in
 Gomulka's view in February 1967,
 when Rumania established diplo-
 matic relations with West Germany
 in disregard of Polish and East
 German interests.   Hungary, Bul-
 garia, and Czechoslovakia seemed
 ready to follow suit immediately.
 Bucharest's move caused Gomulka
 to join with East Germany's U1-
 bricht and the USSR's Brezhnev
 in a multifaceted effort to bol-
 ster Eastern European solidarity
 against: Bonn's initiatives.   As
 a result,  a series of new or re-
 newed mutual security treaties
 was concluded between Eastern
 European countries.   These pacts
 do not bind any regime in the area
 to a common policy against West
 Germany, however.   The Gomulka
 regime's role in these efforts
 nonetheless has resulted in an un-
 Gomulka intensified his ef-
 fort to rally Eastern Europe in
 support of his German policy later
 in 1967.   In an article published
 in the 29 October issue of the
 Soviet party daily Pravda, he dis-
 regarded the well-known Soviet
 view that German reunification
 is a matter to be solved by Bonn
 and Pankow, asserting that the
 permanent division of Germany and
 support for East Germany accords
 with the vital interests of "all"
 peaceful nations.   In public,  at
 least, Gomulka's thesis has been
 ignored by the USSR and most East-
 ern Europeans, except for Hungary,
 which has issued what amounts to
 a rebuttal.
 Gomulka's linking of Poland's
 European interests with those of
 East Germany is a potentially
 dangerous step.   Moscow may fear
 that it will blight the chances
 for achieving Eastern European
 solidarity on this issue.   More-
 over, in the long term it could
 lead to the kind of diplomatic
 and political isolation of Poland
 that it was initially designed to
 "The  division  of Germany  into  two German
 states... does not contradict the interests of any Euro-
 pean peoples. On the contrary, as long as the German
 Federal Republic continues  to pursue its policy,
 headed yesterday by Adenauer and Erhardt and con-
 tinued today--with the aid of new tactics--by Kie-
 singer's government, this division will correspond to
 the interests of all peace-loving peoples.

 prevent--an inevitable sequel if
 Moscow's   interests in the future
 should dictate improved relations
 with Bonn.
 The Sino-Soviet Dispute
 In contrast to his sharp re-
 actions to Eastern European as-
 sertiveness, Gomulka has exhibited
 a great deal more caution and pa-
 tience in dealing with Chinese
 "great power chauvinism."   His
 forbearance,   however, does not
 stem from sympathy for Communist
 China, but from dissatisfaction
 with the way the Soviets have used
 the dispute to strengthen their
 claims to primacy within the Com-
 munist movement.
 For nearly a year after Go-
 mulka returned to power in 1956,
 his regime entertained hopes that
 the Polish "experiment" had the
 support of Peking, which at the
 time was engaged in Mao Tse-tung's
 "hundred flowers" campaign.   The
 Poles apparently believed that
 Peking favored a relaxation of
 Soviet controls within the bloc
 and was, therefore, a possible
 source of support for Gomulka's
 principles of greater diversity
 and party autonomy.   Although
 it. was mainly the still-undisci-
