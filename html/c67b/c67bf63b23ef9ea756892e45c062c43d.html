 Murder Is Not a Childish Prank
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS

 HqN. BRUCE ALGER
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HHoUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Th rsday, may 25, 1961
 Mr. AL ER.                     Mr. Speaker, it is time
 we faced  p to the fact that coddling
 criminals b cause they happen to also be
 teenagers i not the answer to so-called
 Juvenile de inquency. There is a differ-
 ence betw en breaking windows and
 committing murder.  Our laws must rec-
 ognize Seri us crime for what it is if we
 are to mee and solve one of America's
 gravest pro lems:
 GE    NG AWAY WrrH MURDER
 On readin             President Kennedy's proposals
 for a feder Ily directed "total attack" on
 juvenile deli quency.  a responsible parent
 may wonder whether he and Mr. Kennedy
 are worrying about the same thing.
 The Presid nt, it seems to us, has missed
 an opportun ty- to inject some clarity into
 the discussio of a fogbound subject, per-
 haps because he misses the-point of the Na-
 tion's cone 'r .                         Nowhere in his remarks is
 the   euphe  ism   "juvenile   delinquency"
 pulled apart to reveal the multitude of evils
 it embraces.
 What alar s a community is not truancy,
 window brea ing, and apple filching.  It is
 robbery, ra  , and murder, committed by
 criminals wh happen also to be teenagers
 or even young r. And "criminal" is the exact
 word.  In Ne York City the other day, a 15-
 year-old stabbed to death a 14-year-old he
 had never s  n before." His explanation:
 "He   got  sno y."   This  was  the  seventh
 youth gang   urder in that section of the
 city this year, and the fourth in just 17 days.
 In too man places, the merely wayward
 youngster an the truly dangerous youth
 alike have enj yed society's impartial solici-
 tude.  In the f ce of alarming evidence to the
 contrary, the sentimental assumption per-
 sists that eve y young hoodlum can be re-
 deemed if mci ty will only love and under-
 stand him.  B t this turns the issue upside-
 down.                      The ne essity for understanding does
 not rest with society, but with the young
 criminal who  s contemptuous of its rules.
 The remedy for the worsening problem of
 juvenile crime does not lie mainly in more
 study, worksh ps or projects.  Indeed, there
 is no pat solu ion.  But a big step toward
 a solution would surely be for all commu-
 nities to draw  he line between delinquency
 and crime.
 No community needs Federal help to make
 that commonsense distinction.  Those com-
 munities which let young criminals literally
 get away with murder are already shirking
 their responsibilities.  If they let Washing-
 ton try to take over the problem, they are
 abdicating their responsibilities.

 Mr. ROUDEBUSH.  Mr. Speaker, this
 is our Memorial Day around the world.
 Memorial Day, May 30, is distinctly an
 Americari institution. It is a deeply sig-
 nificant, sentimental custom established
 by our people more than 90 years ago.
 The American Memorial Day is being
 observed in every community across our
 Nation, also in many foreign lands upon
 the high seas.
 This special day is the brief moment
 we set aside from our busy lives to pause
 before the resting places of our departed
 loved ones-to remember them and to
 eulogize the honored dead.  This is the
 day of tribute to those who live only in
 history.      -   -
 When we have concluded our short
 ceremonies here and turn back to our
 daily tasks, we shall leave with the dead
 our tributes, expressed in words and with
 flowers.  But of even' greater import is
 the fact that we, ourselves, will have
 gained new spiritual and mental enlight-
 enment through this experience.
 This is not a day for sadness.  In fact,
 when we consider all of its facets, we
 find that Memorial Day has great beauty
 and that it has truly inspiring depths.
 There are the colors of our flag and
 flowers for the eye to admire. There are
 the carefully chosen words of prose, po-
 etry, song, and prayer for the ear to
 hear.  All these touch our hearts and
 minds and our conscience.  They re-
 awaken in us a new realization that we
 are influenced in large measure by those
 who have gone before us, and by their
 contributions to our lives.
 It does i?ot matter who we are, nor
 the differences between our religious
 thinking on racial stock. The principles
 represented by this Memorial Day are the
 same to each of us. We are all Ameri-
 cans.  This is our special day, and here
 we stand together in tribute to our own
 national family.
 Following the same line of thought,
 ,when we honor the dead we-do not weigh
 the stations they held in life.  It does
 not matter whether they were rich or
 poor, young or old, whether they were
 intellectuals, craftsmen, students, or la-
 borers.  At the poet John Ingalls ex-
 pressed it, in the democracy of the dead,
 all men at last are equal, There is nei-
 ther rank nor station nor prerogative in
 the republic of the grave.
 In those days of combat, it did not
 matter who our fellow defenders were,
 And so it is now in our homage to them.
 It makes no difference whether they
 May 25
 were native sons or the foreign born,
 whether they were white or black or
 brown, gentiles or Jews, Protestants or
 Catholics. In the final analysis, all that
 has ever counted is the fact that they
 were Americans and that they gave their
 lives in the defense of our homes and of
 our ideals of freedom.
 Now, it may be a little difficult for us
 who are gathered hereto realize that we
 are part of a vast, worldwide, commemo-
 rative service on this special day.  We
 are but a small portion of the living who
 are honoring the dead. And these souls
 to whom we are directing our immediate
 attention are but a very few of the total
 number  of  American  honored dead
 around the world.
 What we are doing here is actually
 symbolic. Our contribution to the over-
 all Memorial Day observance is being du-
 plicated by millions of other people
 throughout our land and in several for-
 eign countries. To make the point clear,
 let us consider the following facts:
 There are more than 1 million names
 on the honor rolls of the American war
 dead.  Those are the men who have
 fought and died for our country since
 this Nation was founded some 185 years
 ago.
 What we say here today expresses our
 tribute to all of those honored ones.
 The praise we give the other departed
 war veterans of our personal acquaint-
 ance is, in reality, praise for all who
 have served in the Armed Forces of our
 Nation.
 We cannot return the dead, therefore
 the only remaining course is to extend
 ourselves to them through the sincerity
 and beauty of our memorial services.
 That is what our people are doing today
 at home and abroad. Let us look at the
 whole picture for a moment.
 Throughout the 'United States and in
 some 25 American military cemeteries
 beyond our shores, the mortal remains
 of some 400,000 Americans who gave
 their lives in World War I, World War II,
 and the Korean conflict are buried-or
 they are recorded as missing in action.
 On this Memorial Day, special cere-
 monies are being held at 8 American
 military cemeteries or special memorials
 in France, England, and Belgium, where
 nearly 31,000 World War I dead are
 Similar services are being held for
 76,000 World War II dead at 14 other
 American   cemeteries   in   England,
 France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland,
 Italy, and Tunisia.
 Also, special services are being held
 for more than 90,000 other World War
 II and Korean -war dead buried or re-
 corded as missing at American ceme-
 teries in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska,
 and the Philippines.
 In addition, special services are being
 held for the war dead at the Tomb of
 the Unknowns and some 99,000 other
 war dead buried at Arlington National
 Cemetery, on Virginia soil, across the
 Potomac from Washington, D.C.
 Most of these final resting places are
 a long way from us.  But, in reality,
 they are very close to our hearts.

 EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION BY
 SENATOR MORSE
 Mr. MORSE    Mr. President, I would
 .not want the RECORD to close without
 taking some time to express my appre-
 ciation for the wonderful assistance I
 received throughout the consideration
 of  the Federal-aid-to -education  bill,
 starting from the day the bill was re-
 f erred to my Subcommittee on Education
 until the historic hour this evening when
 the bill was passed by such a fine ma-
 jority of 49, t  34.  Mr. Baker advises
 me that if all  enators had been present,
 the bill would have been passed by a
 vote of 59 to 41
 Many of n y  colleagues have been
 kind enough    express very flattering
 words about m work on the bill. Every
 Senator knows that no one person car-
 was carried t

 cooperated with me and
 with me from the time
 we first consi
 committee.
 It is always dangerous to start thank-
 ing some persons for services rendered
 far beyond the line of duty, without run-
 ning the risk of forgetting someone
 else.  However, I will run that risk in
 order to make certain that the RECORD
 will show that credit is given to some to
 whom I shall always be indebted for their
 wonderful cooperation.
 Th6re would have been no chance for
 the passage of the bill if we had not re-
 ceived-at-all times the complete coopera-
 tion of the majority leader, the Senator
 from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD].  I am
 sure that few Members of the Senate
 fully appreciate the great help the Sen-
 ator fromMontana was to the boys and
 girls of this country in connection with
 the magnificent work he did in helping
 to clear the way for the final considera-
 tion of the bill today.  In behalf of my
 subcommittee I say to the Senator from
 Montana that we thank him very much.
 I also wish to express my. sincere
 thanks to the chairman of the Commit-
 tee on Labor and Public Welfare, the
 incomparable  Senator' from Alabama
 [Mr. HILL].   We all know that no mat-
 ter how hard a subcommittee may work
 on a piece of legislation, if the subcom-
 mittee cannot receive the complete co-
 operation of the chairman of the full
 committee, any bill the subcommittee
 seeks to bring out is headed for rough
 travel through the parliamentary pro-
 cedures of the Senate.  The Senator
 from Alabama has been one of the great
 friends of Federal aid to education
 ever since I  first  came to  the Sen-
 ate, starting back in 1947, when the
 Senate first considered the bill that year,
 followed by the bill of 1949, and again
 last year, by S. 8.  The Senator from
 Alabama has long been of great help in
 the area of Federal aid to education just
 as he has been one of the great propo-
 nents of Federal aid to various health
 and hospital projects.  One of the great
 pieces of legislation on the statute books,
 known as the Hill-Burton 'Act, has
 caused us frequently to refer to LISTER
 HILL as probably the greatest friend the
 people of the country have in the Senate
 in connection with health legislation.
 I express my sincere thanks, too, to
 all the members of the subcommittee.
 The senior member of the subcommittee
 is the very wonderful Senator from
 Michigan, PAT MCNAMARA.  Never at any
 time during the consideration of the bill,
 either in committee or on the floor of
 the Senate, did I ask any help from Sen-
 ator McNAMARA and not get it in over-
 flowing measure.                                                             I want him to know
 that I deeply appreciate his help, as I
 appreciate also the help of the Senator
 from  Pennsylvania  [Mr.  CLARK],  the
 Senator from West Virginia [Mr. RAN-
 DOLPH], and the Senator from Texas [Mr.
 YARBOROUGH],   the  other Democratic
 members of the subcommittee.
 Moreover, there would have been no
 chance of voting on the bill tonight if
 we had not had the understanding as-
 sistance-although they did not agree
 with us in some particulars on some
 parts of the bill-of every Republican
 member of the committee. I express my
 appreciation to the Senator from New
 8461
 York [Mr. JAV>TS] and the Senator from
 New Jersey [Mr. CASE], who voted in the
 subcommittee. and in the full commit-
 tee to report the bill.
 Although he is not a member of the
 committee, I want to voice my thanks,
 also, to the Senator from Montana, LEE
 METCALF, who is now presiding over the
 Senate.  As a Member of the House of
 Representatives, he was coauthor of the
 Murray-Metcalf bill, an important fore-
 runner ofthe measure we have just
 passed.
 The Senator from Montana attended
 our conferences with administration rep-
 resentatives and was of great help to
 us with his wise counsel. I shall always
 appreciate his outstanding contribution.
 Even though they did not vote with us,
 I wish to thank the Senator from Ari-
 zona [Mr. GOLDWATER] and the Senator
 from Illinois [Mr. DIRKSEN].  All of us
 know that in committee work if there
 is an opposition that wishes to exercise
 all the parliamentary weapons it can
 keep in its parliamentary arsenal, it is
 sometimes very difficult to get a bill out
 of subcommittee to the full committee
 and from the full committee to the floor
 of the Senate.
 So I appreciate the fine, sportsman-
 like cooperation we received from the
 Senator from Arizona [Mr. GOLDWATER]
 and the minority leader, the distin-
 guished Senator from Illinois [Mr. DIRK-
 SEN], because they threw no parliamen-
 tary roadblocks, so to speak, in our way.
 They roughed us up from time to time
 in expressing opposition to our point of
 view, but that is to be expected and is
 apart of the parliamentary process. Not
 only is it their right, but I believe it is
 their duty to express themselves in op-
 position to a bill with which they do not
 agree.
 I only regret that I was not more per-
 suasive with them.  I only regret that I
 was not a better teacher, because they are
 good students.  Something was wrong
 with my teaching process, because they
 were not won over to my point of view.
 In addition, I thank them as individual
 members of the full committee.
 Senators alone do not carry bills
 through committees or through the Sen-
 ate.  We would not be successful in the
 passage of any bill if it were not for
 the dedicated service which we receive
 from the very loyal staff members.  I
 would not want the RECORD to close with
 my expression of thanks and gratitude
 to Senators only.  I express very deep
 appreciation to the wonderful staff mem-
 bers on both sides of the table-both the
 majority and the minority staff mem-
 bers-who did such wonderful research
 and preparation work for the committee.
 They made it possible for us to meet the
 questions which were presented to us
 in the course of the debate on the basis
 of the facts as shown by the record of
 our hearings and deliberations.
 So to John Forsythe, known to all
 of us as Jack, and who is general coun-
 sel of the committee, and really the
 right-hand assistant to the chairman of
 the committee, the Senator from Ala-
 bama [Mr. HILL], I express in behalf of
 the full committee and the subcommit-
 tee my sincere thanks.

 Mr. President, this is a very keen anal-

 As chairman of the Senate Subcom-

 In short, I do not believe that the anal-

 upon.
 I hope that everyone in the adminis-

 Cuban affairs will read the analysis and
 will take it to heart.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Is there
 objection to the request to print the
 article in the RECORD?
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 iFrom the Washington Post, May 25, 1961]
 AN OLD MISTAKE REPEATED IN CUBA
 The Invasion of Cuba failed because of a
 misreading of the nature of revolutions, and
 especially of contemporary revolutions.  A
 genuine revolution, as distinct from the mili-
 tary coup so common in Latin American
 politics, involves far-reaching social and eco-
 nomic change.  Such change means dispos-
 session of the former ruling class, which
 naturally protests loudly and violently.
 But these protests represent a minority
 viewpoint if the revolution has effected land
 distribution, social services, educational op-
 portunities, and the like.  Consequently, to
 accept the opposition of the dispossessed as
 representative of the views of an entire peo-
 ple, or the predominant proportion of a peo-
 ple,   is  to  seriously  underestimate  the
 strength and backing of a revolution.
 This may seem obvious and platitudinous,
 and yet this underestimation has been made
 of every significant revolution of modern
 clines. For example, at the Paris Peace Con-
 ference following World War I, Lloyd George
 opposed Allied intervention against the Bol-
 shevik regime in Russia on the following
 grounds: "The peasants accepted bolshevism
 for the same reason that peasants accepted it
 In the French Revolution, namely, that It
 gave them land.  Is any one of the Western
 Allies prepared to send a million men into
 Russia?  The mere idea of crushing bolshe-
 vism by a military force is pure madness."
 Yet, this madness was pursued because of
 the credence given to reports of emigres and
 diplomats that the Soviet regime had little
 popular support.
 The invasion of Cuba failed for the same
 basic reason that Intervention failed against
 the French and Russian revolutions, that is,
 underestimation of the popular support for
 a revolutionary regime.
 In recent years, some French military and
 political leaders have studied Mao Tse-tung's
 military tactics and have tried unsuccess-
 fully to apply them in Algeria.  In our own
 country, there are reports that Che Guevara's
 handbook on guerrilla warfare is being used
 as a possible guide for U.S. forces.
 One must never forget, however, that the
 basic strength of the guerrilla is his revolu-
 tionary program.  He is  identified in the
 mind of the peasant as one who offers relief
 from a despised usurer or landlord.  Without
 such identification at the grass roots, the
 guerrilla is simply a saboteur able to blow up
 a few installations or kill a few people, but
 powerless to generate widespread popular
 backing.
 In other words, to read Che Guevara or
 Mao Tse-tung on guerrilla tactics and not on
 political  and social  change is to mistake
 technique for the underlying and determin-
 ing substance.
 The conclusions that may be drawn from
 the above are-
 1. Further  invasions  by  Cuban  emigres
 are likely to be as futile as their first at-
 tempt.  Arms from the Communist block
 would be part of the explanation, but by no
 means entirely; witness the collapse of Ba-
 tista despite abundant American arms.
 2. Direct American intervention  will  be
 regarded and interpreted In most of the un-
 derdeveloped and uncommitted world as cor-
 responding to the policies of the Holy Alli-
 ance in the early 19th century,                                                                          Indeed, the
 antagonism will be much more widespread
 and intense because of modern mass com-
 munication media.
 3. Even if direct American intervention did
 not lead to international complications, it is
 highly probable, if not certain, that winning
 the battle for Cuba in this manner would
 mean losing the battle for Latin America.
 Cuba could become as serious a thorn in
 our side as Algeria has been for France.
 Is it possible that we should talk to Castro
 either directly or through a third country?
 Is it necessary that we refrain from diplo-
 matic trade and travel contact with Cuba?
 For one reason or another, an understand-
 ing with Castro may well prove impractical.
 In that case we must expect the rapid de-
 velopment of Cuba into a Communist show-
 place in the Western Hemisphere.  That in
 turn will create a situation in the Americas
 similar to that in Asia.  Just as we now must
 give massive aid to India; so that she will not
 be  hopelessly  surpassed  by  Communist
 China, so we will then need to give, massive
 aid to at least certain. selected Latin Ameri-
 can countries so that they will not be sur-
 passed by Cuba.  This aid will need to be on
 a much larger scale than any contemplated
 thus far.
 The basic danger in the future probably
 will come not from Soviet bases or Cuban
 agents, but from the appeal of a prosperous
 and growing Communist Cuban economy for
 the  Impoverished  and  dissatisfied  Latin
 American peasant.

 DEATH OF DAVID LYNN
 Mr. MANSFIELD.   Mr.  President,
 David Lynn, who served as Architect of
 the Capitol from 1923 to 1954, died to-
 day, after a short illness.  Prior to his
 service as Architect, Mr. Lynn served
 for 22 years under the previous Archi-
 tects, Edward Clark and Elliott Woods,
 Mr. Lynn was appointed Architect of
 the Capitol by President Coolidge on Au-
 gust 22, 1923. He came from an old fam-
 ily, of Frederick and Allegany Counties,
 Md., who for many generations had been
 distinguished in the judicial, military,
 business, and social life of the State. His
 great-great-grandfather,  Judge David
 Lynn, was one of the three Commission-
 ers appointed in 1751 to lay out the town
 of Georgetown.
 Mr. Lynn was born in Wheeling, W.
 Va., November 10, 1873; was educated in
 public schools of Cumberland and the
 Allegany County Academy.  He entered
 the Office of the Architect of the Capitol
 on July 1, 1901, during the tenure of Ed-
 ward Clark as Architect.                                                                                                 He was ap-
 pointed the seventh Architect of the
 Capitol, following the death of Elliott
 Woods.
 During his tenure as Architect, there
 were constructed and added to the build-
 ings  in the legislative  and  judicial
 groups, the New House Office Building,
 the First Street wing of the Senate Of-
 fice Building, the U.S. Supreme Court
 Building, the central refrigeration plant,
 and other additions to the Capitol power-
 plant, the annex and addition to the
 Main Library of Congress Building, and
 the legislative garage.
 During his tenure, the 62 acres of land
 lying immediately north of Constitution
 Avenue were acquired and developed as
 part of the Capitol Grounds park area;
 the Capital, Senate, and House Office
 Buildings  were  completely  air  con-
 ditioned; the roofs over the Senate and
 House Wings of the Capitol were re-
 constructed, and the interiors of the
 House and Senate Chambers were re-
 modeled; the terraces of the Capitol
 Building were reconstructed.
 The U.S. Botanic Garden was relo-
 cated to its present site, and the new
 conservatory was constructed and the
 grounds developed under his direction.
 In connection with construction proj-
 ects, Mr. Lynn served as a member of the
 Commission for Enlarging the Capitol
 Grounds; the United States Supreme
 Court Building Commission; the Joint
 Commission to acquire a site and addi-
 tional buildings for the Library of Con-
 gress; and was a member of the Zoning
 Commission of the District of Columbia
 and the Alley Dwelling Authority.
 He served as Acting Director of the
 U.S. Botanic Garden, from 1934 to 1954.
 Mr. Lynn retired as Architect of the
 Capitol on September 30, 1954.  Until
 his death, he continued to reside at his
 residence,  3700  Quebec  Street NW.,
 Washington, D.C.

 Monday, in he city of San Francisco, I
 spoke at a Maritime Day luncheon. I
 ask unanimous consent that the com-
 ments I   Iade on that occasion be
 printed in tle body of the RECORD.
 There bei g no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows: ~
 CALIFORNIA'S $TAICE IN THE MARITIME INDUSTRY
 (Address by Hon. THoMAs H. KUCHEL, U.S.
 Senator, at the National Maritime  Day
 Luncheon ~ of the Propeller Club of the
 United States, San Francisco, Calif., Mon-
 day, May 22, 1961)
 As our closest neighbor, the sea has tradi-
 tionally bee  important to California both
 as a source  f income and as a natural route
 of commerc and communication.
 But, it to k a war fought from two shores
 to open stil . undreamed-of maritime oppor-
 tunities for us. It brought new nations into
 focus off our western shores.  And it dem-
 onstrated to the eastern seaboard the grow-
 ing industrial capability of the Pacific coast.
 What has this meant for California?
 It has meant the growth of a shipbuild-
 ing industry.  Today, we are, indeed, a mari-
 time State.  Once content to handle repairs
 and conve sIons, we now boast 22 of the
 principal   ipbullding and repair yards in
 the country. Currently, in these yards, we
 are building 15 new merchcant ships-one-
 fifth of the nationwide total under con-
 struction,
 It  has !meant  progress  for  our  ports.
 Amounts 4 cargo handled through our har-
 bors are i 'creasing.  During 1960, $1%4 bit-
 tin worth 4f goods entered our ports, one-half
 billion do Lars through San Francisco Bay
 alone-a  3-percent increase over the previ-
 ous years, I might add.
 And proudly, we are keeping pace with
 the sweling demand.  Our entire boast is
 bustling  ith new facilities.
 In San Diego, we have a multimillion-
 dollar covered pier; In the East Bay, new
 containerization facilities-fully automated
 and the most modern "of its type;  in Los
 Angeles, new passenger facilities and a con-
 tainer terminal; in Sacramento, an entirely
 new $35 million port; in Stockton, new bulk
 ore and bulk grain facilities; in San Fran-
 cisco, a $50 million bond issue, to put into
 motion a multitude of improvements.
 And pointing the way to still greater pro-
 gress, plans are now underway for many
 improvements along our coast.
 We hardly realize the wealth brought to
 California by the maritime industries.  The
 ramifications are, in fact, staggering.
 Building and loading ships mean employ-
 ment opportunities for a highly skilled labor
 force.   Longshore  industry  workers alone
 number some 25,000 in the State.  Last year,
 they worked 20 million man-hours.      They
 earned in the neighborhood of $75 million,
 and about $42 million of that here in San
 Francisco.  Some 12,500 Californians are on
 the payrolls at private shipyards in the State;
 and,  in  1960, they earned more than $40
 million.  These are labor dollars that pump
 energy into our economy.  These are dollars
 that  purchase  food  and clothing,  finance
 homes and cars, and pay taxes.
 The effect on our State economy certainly
 does not stop here.  Ships are good cus-
 tomers.  There are a thousand and one prod-
 ucts whose end use is found aboard American
 tankers, freighters and luxury liners.
 Take the simple matter of light bulbs.  A
 large freighter uses about 800 light bulbs
 each trip.
 Or, take soap.  One American line recently
 reported that one of its ships uses, each
 trip, 2,400 bars of face soap, 200 bars of lava
 soap, 1,200 bars of laundry soap, and 210
 packages of soap powder.
 Multiply this by the 1,400 American ves-
 sel arrivals in our ports.  The consumption
 of light bulbs and soap alone is significant.
 And so long as the ships continue to con-
 sume, we shall continue to supply.   This
 goes, too, for the taxi that makes repeated
 trips to the docks; the retail shops that sell
 to the tourist and the embarking vacationer;
 the doctor and the lawyer who lend their
 talents to the maritime industry;  and the
 batiks that finance the cargo.  The amount
 invested in ships, shoreside facilities, ship
 and repair yards reaches high in the mil-
 lions.  Shipping is, indeed, a benefactor to
 the economy of our State.
 This is the nuclear era, the age of outer
 space. We are spending, as we should be,
 billions of dollars to reach out to the moon
 and to the stars. But I suggest to the Amer-
 ican people, and to the Government, that
 we do not shunt the sealanes into obscurity.
 That great mariner of another day, Sir Wal-
 ter Raleigh, was eternally correct when he
 said:  "Whosoever commands the sea, com-
 mands the trade; howsoever commands the
 trade of the world, commands the riches of
 the world, and consequently, the world it-
 self."
 Our country, as well as our State, is de-
 pendent on the sea, for trade and commerce,
 for food, and for the security of our people.
 The seas are our road of communications
 with our allies and with the newly emerging
 states-many  of  which are not  far away
 from our own shores.  Across the oceans, we
 move 99 percent of our foreign commerce,
 exclusive  of our   contiguous neighbors,
 Canada and Mexico.    Our foreign commerce
 represents 10 percent of our gross national
 product, now in the proximity of $500 billion
 a year.   And the portent for tomorrow is one
 of expansion. Trade will irresistibly con-
 tinue and will inevitably grow.
 The importance of exports cannot be over-
 estimated.  They are outlets for our indus-
 trial output.  Consequently, they are an im-
 portant factor in our national income.                                                                                   And
 just as significantly, they are a means of
 sharing our democratic way of living with
 new and impressionable nations.
 In `speaking of the importance of Aports,
 I am delighted, at this point, to report the
 passage of a bill by the Senate (S. 1289),
 which I coauthored with Senator MAGNUSON.
 It eliminates the archaic and statutory oath
 requirement on shippers' export declarations.
 Though just one of the little things we so
 frequently overlook, it will save exporters
 thousands  of  unnecessary man-hours  an-
 nually.  It will also pare thousands of un-
 necessary dollars off our mounting export
 costs, which, unfortunately,  overprice our
 goods in highly competitive world markets.
 The sea road of commerce is two way.
 Over it comes the raw materials of the free
 world which we require for our own economic
 existence.  Without vast imports of mag-
 nesium, bauxite, tin, rubber, nitrates, and
 iron ores, we could not produce steel nor
 aluminum.   Without them,  we  could  not
 fully fertilize our fields nor have a myriad
 of products upon which we have come'to
 depend.
 Let's not forget, either, that by buying
 the products of other nations we mutually
 strengthen the free world.  A nation wthout
 outlets,  particularly the  single-commodity
 nation, is economically weak.  And a nation
 economically weak is politically vulnerable.
 In essence, our exports and imports are
 major tools with which we wage our de-
 fense in the cold war of economics and ideas.
 American merchant ships successfully op-
 erating in peacetime trade are one of the
 greatest assets this Nation can possess.  And
 because they are ready and able to serve
 the country at a moment's notice should the
 need arise, they are rightly and admirably
 called our fourth arm of defense.  We are
 now living in the most dangerous world in
 history.  Despite our fervent hopes and ef-
 forts through collective security systems to
 maintain a just peace, situations may sud-
 denly develop which will demand instant re-
 sponse from our shipping industry.  Suez
 and Lebanon are two recent examples.
 In the Korean war, we feverishly took 600
 vessels out of mothballs to supply the United
 Nations' needs in that conflict.  But they
 were old and they were slow. Meanwhile,
 the tempo of the times was dramatically
 quickened.  There is, I think it fair to say,
 an increasingly high premium on an active
 merchant marine, swift and sure, to play
 its part in peace or in emergency.
 And now Russia has recognized the truth
 of  that  maxim.   In  1956,  the  Russians
 stopped producing naval surface vessels in
 their yards and began to build merchant
 ships.  Russia now operates about 800 mer-
 chant ships-against our 990. And, by 1965,
 the Russians plan to double that figure.
 Their dry cargo accommodations will  in-
 crease 120 percent and their tanker capacity,
 80 percent.  In all, they will have about 13
 million tons of shipping, or about 8 percent
 of the world total.  Last year, ship construc-
 tion orders around the world declined 25
 percent, but the Soviet increased its demand
 for new tonnage by 88 percent. And, I think
 the importance  which  international com-
 munism  attaches                                                                                                                                                     to  the  sealanes  of  the
 globe is devastatingly clear in her subma-
 rine fleet of more than 500-more than Hitler
 had in 1939.
 We need only look around us to verify So-
 viet ambitions to penetrate all the commer-
 cial areas of the world.  Ninety miles from
 our  shore,  Russian  ships  are  arriving  in
 Cuba every day.   One hundred percent of
 all petroleum products are entering Cuba
 in Russian tankers.   Russian ships call reg-
 ularly at African ports.    Russian ships ar-
 rive in the ports of the Persian Gulf, in the
 Mediterranean Sea, and in the seas of south-
 east Asia.  It can be clearly seen that Rus-
 sia, with leaping strides in merchant ship-
 ping-not to mention her undersea craft-
 is emphasizing the role of seapower.

 development in the Soviet bloc that we

 DOLLAR GAPSMANSI-UP
 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, . I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed into
 the RECORD a report which was prepared
 for me on the possible adverse affect of
 the administration's proposal to cut from
 $500 to $100 the amount of goods return-
 ing to the United States which tourists
 can bring in duty free.
 There being no objection, the report
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 U.S. "dollar gapsmanship" could backfire
 on both our balance of trade and our Latin
 American relations in several key areas.
 Back in February, President Kennedy pro-
 posed to cut from $500 to $100 the amount
 of goods returning U.S. tourists can bring
 in duty-free.  The $500 limit was originally
 set to help European economies back onto
 their feet.  That was in the days when U.S.
 attention was focused on European recovery.
 Now administration leaders feel that Europe
 no longer needs help-and we need the tour-
 ists' dollars here.
 But Mr. Kennedy's proposal-now formal-
 ized into H.R. 6611 just passed by the
 House-has poked a stick into the hornet's
 nest  of  Latin  American  and  Caribbean
 economies.  For the $500 tourist exemption
 has been a boon to south-of-the-border na-
 tions         hungry  to  earn  American  tourist
 dollars.
 Thus, amid general satisfaction with the
 $500  million Alliance  for  Progress Latin
 American aid  bill, a discordant note was
 slipped into the May 15 session of the Eco-
 nomic Commission for Latin America.           The
 ECLA pointed out "foreign exchange income
 from tourism is of vital importance for the

 In addition to the all-important oil ship-
 ments, each year Curacao brings in $29 mil-
 lion of such staple American goods as De-
 troit  cars,  Louisville refrigerators,  Kansas
 grain, and Philadelphia  air conditioners.
 The Dutch Antilles together import about
 $70 million of U.S. goods each year.
 These imports from the States dwarf the
 $5 million American tourists paid out in
 1959 during their shopping tours through
 Curacao-generally regarded as the favorite
 shopping center of the tax-free Caribbean.
 Curacao is thus most susceptible to the
 Kennedy measure.  The Island's Director of
 Economic Affairs and Development, Dr. F. P.
 Jansen, points out that local tourism is not
 "residual". Eighty-seven percent of tourist
 dollars are spent for goods-not hotels and
 services.
 The proposed 80 percent cut in the tour-
 ist allowance means many of the Curacaons
 now directly employed in the tourist indus-
 try  may  find  themselves  out  of  work.
 Spritzer & Fuhrmann, largest jewelry and sil-
 ver merchant there, says large scale layoffs
 will be inevitable among their 600 employees.
 With the island's second laregst industry
 threatened and with the underpinnings of
 their Economic Development Plan weakened,
 Curacaons are joining others in Latin Amer-
 ica in regarding the Kennedy measure as an
 unreasoned or unfriendly act.  They wonder
 if this is the United States' answer to years
 of friendship and heavy purchases from the
 North American giant.
 As one leading Curacao figure exclaimed,
 "It makes little sense for the United States
 to adopt tourist policies that may bankrupt
 us, and then pros  d t  put us on American
 relief." ~~JJ

 DRIVE 1O RANSOM CASTRO
 CAPTIVES NEEDS HELP
 Mr. PELL. Mr. President, on the floor
 of the Senate last evening I made a brief
 statement in support of the effort by our
 fellow Americans to raise funds in an
 Castro prisoners.  My statement yester-
 day contained my reasons for taking this
 modities to be traded, so many irreplace-
 able  individuals  for so many replaceable
 things-whether dollars, tractors, or trucks,
 the commodity that  Hitler  demanded  to
 spare  the lives of  a million Hungarian
 Jews.
 Although the Government has paid ran-
 som in the past to win freedom for American
 citizens unjustly jailed behind the Iron Cur-
 tain, Castro's proffered deal is different in
 many respects.  The 1,200 hostages are not
 American  citizens.   Nor  are  they  merce-
 naries, as Cuban propagandists claim.                                                                                                                            They

 save their Nation from Fidelista dictator-
 ship of the Left just as they sought before
 to end the military dictatorship of Batista.
 By the same token, this Government is pre-
 cluded from taking any active role in a
 "trade" that would suggest Washington re-
 gards the rebel survivors now as mercenaries
 salvageable for a price.
 But these philosophical and official con-
 siderations do not have to inhibit Ameri-
 cans as individuals.                                                                                                                    By their response to
 the  fundraising  appeal  of  Mrs.  Eleanor
 Roosevelt, Walter Reuther and Dr. Milton
 Eisenhower   for  Cuba's  freedom   fighters,
 private American citizens can demonstrate
 to the world that this country's vaunted
 concern for humanity, for individual hu-
 man beings, is more than an empty phrase,
 more than a demagogic lure.
 Indeed, there is an obligation of sorts on
 Americans to render what assistance they
 can as individuals to the imprisoned anti-
 Castro force.  The American  Government,
 which acts in the name of the people, has
 acknowledged a  responsibility extending
 over both the present and past administra-
 tions for the failure of the Cuban rebel
 invasion.
 The American people can make amends
 to the anti-Castro volunteers for whatever
 mistakes  Washington  made  in  its  covert
 support of the invasion by helping to re-
 deem at least the lives of the survivors.                                                                                                                      As
 distasteful as  political  blackmail  is, the
 fundraising effort also gives the American
 people an occasion to demonstrate thei

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 I will admit that the statistics relat-
 ing to classroom and teacher shortages
 are open to question. Yet we must have
 some basis upon which to justify this
 program. I shall accept the figures
 offered by the U.S. Office of Education.
 In 1953, the Comissioner of Education
 reported a shortage of 312,000 class-
 rooms.          A year later this estimate rose
 to 370,000 with predictions that further
 increases in the classroom shortage were
 expected.  While these statistics were
 being compiled, the States managed to
 construct classrooms at an average rate
 of almost 70,000 per year, thus exceed-
 ing the goal set by the Department of
 Health, Education, and Welfare. By the
 fall of 1960, the classroom shortage had
 been reduced to 142,100.
 In order to offset this magnificent rec-
 ord, proponents of this bill contend that
 the States cannot continue to finance
 the educational needs of the 1960's and
 therefore Federal aid is essential. Once
 again,,the record reveals otherwise as
 the taxpayers of America continue to
 approve school bonds to improve educa-
 tional facilities. But, even if we accept
 this contention, this bill offers no relief.
 In order to receive its full entitlement,
 each State must maintain a minimum
 effort based on the average Stale effort
 over the three preceding fiscal years.
 This simply means that the States
 must maintain their present level of
 progress.  I believe they will meet their
 educational needs without the coercion
 of the Federal Government and notwith-
 standing the pessimism of those who
 support this bill.
 In staffing our public schools, the
 States have also proven their ability to
 proceed without Federal Aid. Since 1900,
 public school enrollment increased by
 140 percent while the number of teach-
 ers rose by 250 percent.  We now have
 one teacher per 24.4 pupils whereas in
 1900 one teacher served 35.6 pupils.  At
 the same time teachers' salaries have
 more than kept pace with those of other
 wage earners.  Again, the record fails
 to justify Federal intervention.
 In praising the States for their efforts
 in meeting the educational needs of the
 Nation, I take special pride in the prog-
 ress made in my own State of Maryland.
 Since 1950, the number of pupils in
 Maryland public schools has increased
 by 70 percent while the number of teach-
 ers increased by 90 percent. During this
 same period, teachers' salaries have been
 Increased by 63.8 percent.  Maryland's
 average salary of classroom teachers is
 now $5,680 per year.  Maryland thus
 ranks 11th in the Nation in the pay-
 ment of teachers. We are spending $415
 per pupil in average daily attendance.
 This is above the national average and
 represents an increase of 86.9 percent
 during the past 10 years.
 It has not been easy for Maryland to
 meet these educational needs.  It will
 not be easy for us to meet future needs.
 But we are prepared to meet them-that
 is, if the Federal Government will hold
 the line and not require Maryland tax-
 payers to finance a national program
 which will cost $1 for every 75 cents re-
 ceived from Washington.
 I have no illusions that this bill will
 be defeated nor that it will be improved
 by the adoption of worthy amendments.
 Nevertheless, I deem it to be the duty
 of those who oppose S. 1021 to point out
 the shortcomings of this bill and support
 amendments to improve the bill. It has
 been implied, during the debate, that op-
 ponents of the bill should not offer
 amendments if they are not prepared to
 support the final product.  I sincerely
 hope that the time will never arrive
 when any Senator must forfeit his right
 to amend pending legislation merely be-
 cause he intends to oppose final passage
 of the legislation.
 Accepting the fact that this bill will
 pass, I wish to comment on some of the
 more glaring inequities and ' shortcom-
 ings of S. 1021.
 Returning to the declaration of pur-
 pose, we find it to be the intent of Con-
 gress that "inequalities of educational
 opportunities within and between States
 will be substantially reduced." This bill
 endorses a principle of equal opportunity
 in education while permitting Federal
 funds to be used to support segregated
 schools-an actively clearly in violation
 of the Constitution.
 An amendment to prohibit such use of
 Federal funds was rejected by the pro-
 ponents of S. 1021 on the grounds that
 it was not germane to this bill and that
 it would jeopardize the benefits which
 would accrue to the little boys and girls
 of America.  I would remind the pro-
 ponents of this bill that there are
 thousands of Negro boys and girls who
 are entitled to equal educational op-
 portunities.                                                                It is about time that we
 stop treating the Negro as a problem
 unrelated to the issues which affect the
 American people. It is about time that
 we lay aside the cloak of expediency and
 give something more than lipservice to
 those principles which we claim to en-
 dorse.
 I sincerely believe that Government
 should not do for the people that which
 the people can do for themselves. I be-
 lieve that Government which is closest
 to the people is best. For these reasons,
 I itm opposed to shifting the responsibil-
 ity for educating our youth from the
 local school districts to the States or the
 Federal Government.
 None of us are so naive as to believe
 that the program we initiate today will
 end after the expiration of 3 years. On
 the contrary, this is just the beginning.
 As the program progresses, it will be
 necessary to set additional standards and
 controls.  Ultimately, the Federal Gov-
 ernment will assume the responsibility
 for educating our youth.  If I may en-
 gage in the game of foretelling the
 future, I predict that it will not be long
 before we are asked to approve the estab-
 lishment of a Department of Education.
 I oppose this shift of responsibility.  I
 do not share the lack of faith and trust
 of those who contend that the parents
 of America will not demand and provide
 the best possible education for their
 children.
 Finally, I would address myself to
 titles II and III of S. 1021, which extend
 Public Laws 815 and 874.  If we are to
 talk about germaneness, then I submit
 that these titles have no place in this
 bill. The impacted areas legislation was
 not enacted to improve the educational
 standards of this Nation.  Rather, the
 purpose of these laws is to compensate
 the States for land taken off the tax rolls
 by the Federal Government.  If not for
 these Federal activities, this land would
 represent a lucrative source of revenue
 far in excess of the payments now being
 received.  I support the continuation of
 these programs.  However, I shall not
 trade my vote on this issue, important as
 it may be, for the acceptance of a Fed-
 eral aid program which I know to be
 unjustified and inherently wrong.
 Federal aid to education is not a new
 concept.  It has come before the Con-
 gress periodically since 1871.  Each time
 voices of pessimism warned of the col-
 lapse of our educational system.  Each
 time these warnings were proved to be
 wrong as the States met current needs
 with positive action.  I am confident
 that the needs of the future will be met

 night there occurred a colloquy on the
 floor of the Senate between the Senator
 from Florida [Mr. SMATHERS] and my-
 self about the anti-Castro fighters for
 whom a private U.S. committee is ne-
 gotiating to free.  During the colloquy
 I suggested that perhaps in addition to
 taking whatever action was advisable on
 the military prisoners, in line with a hu-
 manitarian viewpoint we ought to give
 some thought to the 150,000 political
 prisoners who now languish in Cuban
 jails.
 It seemed to me at that time, as we
 .were discussing the subject on the floor
 of the Senate, that whatever action was
 taken by a private group, more intelli-
 gent and effective action could be taken
 by either a committee of the United Na-
 tions or a committee of the Organization
 of American States or by the Interna-
 tional Red Cross or by any other group
 or mechanism which could help free
 some of the larger group of people who
 are being held as political prisoners in
 the prisons of Cuba.

 The  PRiSIDING  OFS'ICER.  Without objec-
 tion, it is so ordered.
 Mr. CARROLL. Mr. President, this is a very
 important !sub ject.  I know the able Senator
 from Florikda has studied it very carefully.
 Will he inform us as nearly as he is able to,
 based on what he has been able to learn
 from the press and in other ways, how many
 prisoners are being held in Cuba, today, by
 Castro?

 147,000.  H
 Mr. SMAT
 the night o:
 147,000 or 1
 rIIERS. Over and above the so-
 om fighters?
 )LL. Yes, the 1,200.
 mzas. Over and above the 1,271,
 ,tion is--although I cannot vouch
 enticity-that in the neighbor-
 060 people are being held.
 LL. A few days ago I read in the
 that the estimated number was
 wever, whether it be 100,000 or
 teas. The information isthat on
 the revolution, Castro picked up
 7,000. Since then, approximate-
 'e been released; but 100,000 are
 ,ated in theaters and in pensof
 der the most terrible conditions
 ly 50,000 ha
 still incarce
 Mr. CARRO
 let us say
 Castro is on
 ,L. In order to be conservative,
 hat the number still held by
 y 50,000. But regardless of the
 exact number of prisoners Castro still holds,
 certainly the negotiations are most impor-
 tant, for thy involve thousands of people.
 So If the G vernment of the United States
 has to negot ate on this basis, let the nego-
 tiations be a roes the board.
 Mr. SMATx Rs. I do not disagree with the
 Senator,  I merely say I do not think the
 Government, itself, is in a position to be-
 come  involy d  in  this  particular  matter.
 The whole b rden of what I was trying to
 say is that ci izens' groups do a much more
 effective job I  understand  the Govern-
 ment has to en no particular position with
 respect to t is question, and I hope that
 will continue to be the case; but I agree that
 we ought to try to have every prisoner in
 Cuba release, and, for that matter, any-
 where else.   here are three boys in Ecuador
 who need to a released.
 Mr. CARROL  Would the Senator not say
 that, if we are to negotiate for 1,271 prisoners,
 we should to k about all the people who
 are now in p isons, whether it be done by
 private group , or by a commission of the
 Government,  r by the U.S. Government?
 Mr. SMATIIE    . I could not disagree with
 the Senator. ertainly, we want to see that
 all people who' are incarcerated wrongly are
 freed.  Certainly, there are some in Cuba.
 Certainly, if we are to try to free 1,200, we
 ought to try to free more.  Certainly, we
 should try to free  Cuba.   Certainly, we
 should try to get rid of communism there.
 Mr. CARROLL. Emphasis has been placed on
 some 1,200 people.  Some persons call it
 a ransom, some call it backmall, to exchange
 machines for men.   What about the thou-
 sands who languish in the jails of Cuba?
 It seems to me, they also represent a proper
 basis for negotiation.
 Mr. SMATIIERS. The Senator is correct.
 Mr. CARROLL.                             Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the entire edi-
 torial which appeared in the New York
 Times may be printed in the RECORD at
 this point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 CASTRO'S  CIVILIAN  PRISONERS
 While international efforts are being made
 for the release or over 1,200 military prison-
 ers in Cuba, the world must not forget the
 civilians  incarcerated  by            Premier  Fidel
 Castro's regime.
 Newsmen have estimated that 200,000 men
 and women were rounded up after the un-
 successful landing in April.                                                                                                         Exiles talk of
 5,000 persons penned in a 150-seat theater
 in Havana, 19 dying the first day.  Relatives
 in many cases have been unable to learn
 whether vanished kin are in custody.     Only
 slowly have any of those confined in the
 latest roundup been winning release.    Other
 political prisoners are reported to have been
 held without trial for months.        Summary
 executions have been rumored.
 There was a time when Fidel Castro was
 himself a rebel against the Fulgencio Batista
 government.
 Then Dr. Castro was declaring in a broad-
 cast of August 21, 1958: "The victories we
 have won in arms, without murdering, tor-
 turing, or even questioning the enemy, show
 that attacking human dignity can never be
 justified."   IF
 Then he    was  arguing:  "If in  any war
 cruelty is stupid, it never is so much so as
 in a civil war, where the fighters will have
 to live together some day and the victors
 will  finds themselves  before the   children,
 wives, and mothers of the victims."
 Then he was insisting: "The example that
 our combatants are giving must be held up
 as an edifying stimulus for our future gen-
 erations, as against the shameful and de-
 pressing examples given by the murderers
 and torturers of the dictatorship."
 In those rebel days, Fidel Castro was call-
 ing for the International Committee of the
 Red Cross to take over prisoners and to pro-
 vide medicines.  He was proud that on July
 24, 1958, his rebels had released 253 captured
 Batista troops to an International Red Cross
 delegate, and 169 more to the Cuban Red
 Cross a few days later.
 This would be the time once again to in-
 voke the international  Red  Cross-or  an
 inter-American governmental committee or
 a United Nations mission-to alleviate con-
 ditions of detainees, to report lists to fam-
 ilies, to press for respect for the universal
 declaration of human rights.
 Article 9 of that declaration states: "No
 one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile."  Article 10 says: "Every-
 one is entitled in full equality to a fair and
 public hearing by an independent and im-
 partial tribunal, in the determination of his
 rights and obligations and of any criminal
 charge against him."
 This should be a cause for the United
 States and the governments of the Western
 Hemisphere, in particular, as well as for those
 governments  that sought so ardently for
 human rights for the late Premier Patrice
 Lumutnba of the Congo.  If Dr.  Castro
 May 25
 should see fit to regard the International
 Red Cross in the same humanitarian light as
 he did his own revolt, it would be an advance
 for human rights-and for Cuba.
 Mr. CARROLL.  I wish to read again
 briefly from the editorial.  After outlin-
 ing three or four important factors, it
 states:
 This would be the time once again to in-
 voke the international,3ted Cross-or an in-
 ter-American governmental committee or a
 United Nations mission-to alleviate condi-
 tions of detainees, to report lists to families,
 to press for respect for the universal decla-
 ration of human rights.
 Article 9 of the declaration states:  "No
 one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile."  Article 10 says: "Every-
 one is entitled in full equality to a fair and
 public hearing by an independent and im-
 partial tribunal, in the determination of his
 rights and obligations and of any criminal
 charge against him."
 I do not profess to be an expert in
 these matters, but it seems to me that
 the purport of the editorial and the dis-
 cussion we had the other night is noth-
 ing more than the application of com-
 monsense.  The President said that he
 looks upon these men as brothers.  Are
 the 150,000 people who languish in jails
 anything less than our brothers and
 sisters
 Therefore, when we talk about this
 private group functioning, I say let them
 go ahead.  Let them exchange tractors.
 However, I advocate we take an addi-
 tional step, but not by private groups.
 I advocate that through the Organiza-
 tion of American States or through the
 United Nations or through an interna-
 tional organization like the Red Cross,
 an immediate, continuing and unrelent-
 ing effort be made to free the 150,000
 civilian prisoners who languish in jails
 in Cuba.  Let us hear an answer from
 Castro on this to the people of Latin
 America.  Let him attempt to answer it
 to the peoples of the world.
 Mr.  MANSFIELD.  Mr.  President,
 will the Senator from Wyoming yield,
 with the understanding that he will not
 lose his right to the floor?
 Mr. McGEE.  I yield.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.   Mr. President, I
 wish at this time to make only two com-
 ments on the President's message.  The
 first is to remark on the extraordinary
 range of subjects which he discussed.
 There is scarcely an aspect of our na-
 tional security that did not receive
 attention in the course of his address;
 yet no one could say that his remarks
 were disparate or unrelated to a sense
 of the totality of the struggle that faces
 us.
 I can recall few speeches in the past
 decades that have more clearly and
 forcefully demonstrated the complexity
 of the issues before us, or the Interde-
 pendence of our foreign and domestic
 responsibilities.
 My second comment is that the Presi-
 dent showed throughout his address his
 profound sense of optimism that we can
 expect to meet the great changes before
 us.  I share his optimism, and I honor
 him for his faith in Congress and in the
