 PREFACE
 Ever since China became a land of New Democ-
 racy, following the triumph of the revolution, there
 has been a constant stream of visitors from all parts
 of the world to this country to see for themselves how
 things are going under the people's rule.
 In the spring of 1953, trade union leaders from
 twenty countries and representatives of the World
 Federation of Trade Unions came to China, at the
 invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions, to attend the May Day celebrations and the
 Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions. During
 their brief stay, they visited factories and farms,
 schools and institutions, construction sites in cities
 and villages; they talked with workers, peasants,
 intellectuals, the young and the old, men, women and
 children.
 The following is a collection of radio speeches
 made by delegates from countries of Southeast Asia
 and by Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World
 Federation of Trade Unions, and a poem written by
 Rewi Alley of New Zealand.
 As the purpose of this booklet is to give the
 delegates' impressions of People's China, it is thought
 advisable to omit those parts of the speeches which
 do not directly concern this country.  Where no title
 is available, the editor has ventured to give one that
 reflects the general idea of the speech.

 CHINA'S THREE REALITIES
 Louis Saillant
 General Secretary
 The World Federation of Trade Unions
 On this tour I was able to come into direct con-
 tact with the realities of People's China.  There are
 three kinds of reality that have strongly impressed
 me: political, economic and social.  These realities
 together present a vivid picture of the intense activity
 going on in present-day China.
 What is the dominant political reality?  The
 adherence by the Chinese people to the policy of the
 Central Government, to the policy defined by the
 Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
 The fact is that the people of China regard the Cen-
 After its Seventh Con-
 gress, the All-China Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions
 gave me the opportunity
 to make a study tour of
 several areas of China.
 For me, this tour was
 of great interest and I
 am grateful to the All-
 C h i n a  Federation  of
 Trade Unions for having
 given me this chance to
 become better acquainted
 with China and its people.

 tral Government of the People's Republic of China
 not as a government, but as their government.  And
 this is true of the worker as much as of the peasant,
 of the intellectual, of the merchant as much as of the
 patriot among the national bourgeoisie.
 What is one to think of China's economic reality?
 The process of industrialization has been launched
 on a very large scale.  To fulfil high production
 quotas and to evolve new production methods is the
 goal of nation-wide emulation campaigns that one
 encounters in all spheres of production.  China today
 is successfully changing her economic basis in a
 magnificent display of creative and constructive effort
 by all the living forces within the nation.
 What can one say of the social reality?   I could
 speak on this topic for a long time.  Yesterday, that
 is, before the triumph of the people's revolution, social
 reality in China was characterized by the absence of
 social gains.  The inability of the government organs
 to solve the most elementary social problems was
 matched by the opposition to popular demands on the
 part of the ruling class.  This is no longer so today.
 Social services for children, for women, for men, for
 old workers, are developing at ever-increasing speed.
 These are the political, economic and social reali-
 ties of People's China, realities for which this old
 country deserves to be called "New China."
 We have seen these realities.  We have listened
 to men and women, young and old, telling us of their
 new life.  We have studied carefully every one of
 the replies made to our questions.

 By "we" I mean the delegates of the trade unions
 of some twenty countries who went on this tour.
 This group of delegates was characterized not
 only by its multi-national composition; it also in-
 cluded representatives of national trade union organ-
 izations in India, Burma and Indonesia not affiliated
 with the World Federation of Trade Unions.
 The diversity of opinions represented made this
 meeting of delegates a great experience in itself.  It
 was an experience of jointly studying an event as
 formidable as the transformation of China, a semi-
 feudal and oppressed country only yesterday, into a
 country that is modernizing itself, that is in the van-
 guard of the struggle, waged by the peoples of the
 world in defence of peace against imperialism, be-
 cause it has' become free and independent.
 This group of trade union delegates has been
 unanimous in admitting the tremendous will with
 which the Chinese people are building a new life
 leading them towards socialism.
 How was this unanimity in admitting and ap-
 preciating such a fact possible?
 It was possible because truth is an irresistible
 force and facts are eloquent and convincing.
 The old miner in Fushun, the textile worker in
 Shanghai, the peasant and the teacher in the small
 village of Pa Chiao were not engaging in oratory
 when they answered our questions.  They were giv-
 ing us the facts.  They were asking us to verify their
 claims, immediately, on the spot.
 They explained to us:  "Before the people's rev-
 olution, we were over-exploited,                                          humiliated  and

 robbed seven days a week.  That is all over with us
 now, and neither we nor our children will ever know
 such circumstances again."  One of them told us:
 "At last, we occupy the place in society that befits a
 human being.  We had nothing before . . . here is
 what we have now."  And one of them showed us his
 farm tools, and the other his land:  "Here are our
 plans for tomorrow!"  And yet another spoke to us
 of a municipal plan of social construction and service
 which will make possible immediate industrial devel-
 opment.
 Why should the trade union delegations, invited
 by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, not
 have been unanimous in admitting this simple,
 though highly demonstrative, truth: that great atten-
 tion is being paid to the solution of problems con-
 cerning the children and education, housing and
 public health?  The worker is assured labour safety
 at his factory. Yesterday, the factory to him was
 hell.  Now, he works joyfully, striving to do still
 better.
 Old workers are now assured a comfortable life
 in homes for the aged, especially reserved for them.
 Our Chinese comrades have told us that greater
 numbers of such homes are needed and will he built.
 There is no unemployment in China.  What do
 you think of this, you, workers of India who are
 unemployed by the million?
 The Chinese people no longer know the atrocious
 evil of going hungry, of being daily gnawed by
 hunger.  What do you think of this, workers of the
 Southeast Asian countries where millions are under-

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 nourished, knowing only long days without joy, years
 of hunger?
 In People's China, the trade unions are endowed
 with extensive rights but also great responsibilities,
 both of which are recognized by the state.  Trade
 unions play an active role at the very core of the
 new society.  What do you think of this, workers of
 Japan, you who have experienced brutal police inter-
 vention, the exploiters' constant manoeuvres against
 your trade unions, their constant attacks against your
 trade union rights which are inseparable from your
 democratic rights?
 The Chinese people stand as much for peace as
 for their national independence.  They are united in
 a single force behind their Government which ex-
 presses their will to peace.
 These people sing and shout openly and publicly
 their love of peace.  They have proclaimed their
 active support of all those in the world who effec-
 tively and sincerely defend peace.  What do you
 think of this, you peoples of Asia and Australasia,
 inhabitants of countries where to be an ardent peace
 partisan is a crime in the eyes of governments that
 obey the orders of imperialism?
 Since we made this tour of China we have come
 to understand better why the imperialists and remnant
 feudal elements are dissatisfied with the changes that
 this vast country is undergoing.
 In the old days, they were able to humiliate and
 enslave China as a nation.  Up to only a few years
 ago, they scandalously exploited the Chinese people.
 To reap bigger and bigger profits they worked out

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 new plans for making their mastery absolute.  They
 fostered corruption.  They found traitors inside the
 country to help them in their despicable plots.
 Today, this situation has been definitively re-
 moved.  The Chinese people have become the masters
 of their own destiny.  Never again will they be
 humiliated and scoffed at. On the contrary, they are
 feared.
 These are the rightful objectives which the peo-
 ples who are still slaves to imperialist law and the
 colonial yoke wish to attain.  These peoples have
 every reason to want to attain such objectives.  At
 present, the Chinese people as a whole are helping
 them by proving that it is possible to end all this
 odious, unbearable imperialist exploitation, to end
 the enslavement by feudal lords.
 Finally, we must admit yet another thing: that
 in China the strength of proletarian internationalism
 is developing, thanks to the power of a patriotism
 that is of the purest and healthiest kind.
 We have admired the Chinese people for their
 deep-rooted friendship for the Soviet Union.  We
 have also seen the sincerity of their generous feelings
 towards the peoples of all countries with whom they
 desire to have nothing but friendly and fraternal ties.
 These are the conclusions that I have drawn
 from my tour of China, from my contacts with its
 people.
 Such is People's China.

 VICTORY FOR PEACE
 Bang Tai Uk
 President of the Miners' Union of the Federation of
 Trade Unions of Korea
 On that May 1, columns after columns of people
 plan.
 Chinese people were enjoying a happy life under the
 leadership of their Communist Party and Chairman
 Mao Tse-tung, and how they have rallied round this
 leadership.  We were moved by the love for peace the
 Chinese people displayed, no less than by their deter-
 mination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
 We were also impressed by the inexhaustible fighting
 spirit they showed for the successful accomplishment
 of their historic first five-year economic construction
 The May First parade
 in Peking, in celebration
 of International Labour
 Day, was on a gigantic
 scale. More than 500,000
 people - workers,  peas-
 ants,  government . em-
 ployees,    students                                         and
 ordinary  citizens - took
 part in this magnificent
 demonstration.    During

 China, we had many op-
 portunities to see how the

 were streaming past Tien An Men Square, holding
 aloft colourful flags symbolizing their love for peace
 and the unity and solidarity of the labouring people
 throughout the world.  They were carrying along
 portraits of Chairman Mao Tse-tung and the leaders
 of the Soviet Union, Korea and the other People's
 Democracies.  The marching columns were reviewed
 by Chairman Mao from the rostrum on Tien An Men
 while the people poured their great affection and
 admiration out for him.  A column of 7,000 Young
 Pioneers, gaily marching past with a poster inscribed
 "Always Ready," released doves in great numbers.
 The workers' columns held up posters on which
 was written:  "Let's make every effort to improve
 our work!"  "Carry out the patriotic labour emula-
 tion!"  "Learn from advanced Soviet experience!"
 "Fulfil and over-fulfil the 1953 state plan for econom-
 ic construction!"  They also carried charts showing
 production targets, charts and models illustrating
 both their new achievements in industrial production
 and the strength of unity in their ranks.  Peasants
 carried posters showing their endeavour to produce
 more food and demonstrating agricultural produc-
 tion achievements and record harvests.  The students
 in the parade expressed their determination to study
 Marxism-Leninism and advanced scientific technique
 in order to serve their country better.
 What we saw during the May Day parade in
 Peking gave us a clear picture of the power that is
 New China with her 500 million people.  In partic-
 ular, we realized all the more clearly that the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China, giving the blood of her best

 sons and daughters to the Korean people's war
 of liberation, possesses immeasurable strength and
 monolithic stability.  This knowledge bolsters up our
 faith in the ultimate victory of the camp of peace,
 democracy and socialism and of the peace-loving
 people in the whole world.
 Apart from the May Day celebrations, we also
 had the opportunity to attend the Seventh All-China
 Congress of Trade Unions.  This Congress, attended
 by 800 delegates from all parts of China, had great
 significance.  Also present were more than 105, trade
 union delegates from 20 countries.
 The Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions
 met as China was launching her historic first five-
 year plan which will transform the country from an
 agricultural into an industrial one on the road to
 socialism.  The Congress proved not only that the
 Chinese working class movement is entering upon a
 new era, an era of struggling for the country's indus-
 trialization; it also was a tremendous factor in
 strengthening working class unity and solidarity
 throughout the world and in consolidating the camp
 of peace, democracy and socialism.  New China's
 achievements in various spheres of construction since
 the victorious conclusion of the people's revolution
 constitute a source of inspiration and encouragement
 to the Asian countries, particularly the people of the
 colonial, semi-colonial and capitalist countries, in
 their struggle for national liberation.
 The Chinese working class and the Chinese peo-
 ple as a whole have, under the leadership of Chair-
 man Mao Tse-tung and the Communist Party, not

 only defeated the domestic and foreign reactionary
 forces, but also scored many brilliant successes in
 the sphere of national construction.  Through their
 joint effort, they brought about in the past four years
 the restoration and development of the national
 economy and carried out many social reforms.  The
 result is that China presents a greatly changed pic-
 ture.  One needs only to glance at the output of a
 few major industries to understand this.
 As compared with 1949, the production of pig
 iron in 1952 had increased 7.64 times, that of steel
 8.46 times, of crude oil 3.58 times and of electrolytic
 copper 10.2 times.  With few exceptions, the level of
 China's industries has surpassed the peak reached
 before the War of Resistance to Japanese Aggression.
 In the production of daily necessities, output of cotton
 yarn has increased twofold, of cotton cloth 2.87 times.
 Agriculture has also remarkably progressed.  In
 1952, the gross yield of grain reached the highest
 level ever registered in the history of China, totalling
 163,750,000 tons.  Raw cotton output in the same
 year came to 1,290,000 tons, or double that of 1949.
 Progress has also been rapid in the development of
 the railways and other means of transportation, of
 posts and tele-communications, water conservancy
 and commerce, as well as of culture, education and
 public health.
 There has been a steady rise in the people's
 purchasing power as a result of the rapid restoration
 and development of the nation's economy and the
 attainment  of  financial  and  economic  stability
 throughout the country.    Together with their ma-

 terial life, the people's cultural life has also steadily
 improved.  This is borne out by what we saw at the
 railway repair shop at Changhsintien and in Liang-
 chia Village, on the outskirts of Peking.  When we
 visited the former, we learned that the workers now
 have five times as many new living quarters as they
 had under  Kuomintang rule.  Besides, the plant
 recently set up a library, a nursery, an over-night
 rest-home and a technical school.  In 1952, wages
 increased 3.15 times over what they were under the
 Kuomintang when workers often were starving, with
 nothing to eat but soya bean cakes and thin rice
 gruel.  Now they have good rice and wheat flour for
 their staple food.  Every worker is able to buy new
 furniture for his home.
 In the three years since land reform, the peasants
 of Liangchia Village which we visited have shown
 great spirit in agricultural production.  They have
 turned dry fields into watered land; they have helped
 each other working the waterwheels to irrigate their
 fields so that grain production has increased.  Seven
 new classrooms have been added to the primary
 school in the village.  A peasant in the village by
 the name of Li Chung, who was a farm hand under
 the Kuomintang, was treated like a beast of burden.
 It mattered little whether he was suffering cold or
 hunger, he had to toil all the year round.  And yet,
 his three children died of starvation.  In the land
 .reform, he was given land and built himself a house.
 He was also financially able to clothe his family ade-
 quately and buy sufficient bedding for them.  The

 family now eats rice and white-flour steamed bread
 daily and is leading a happy life.
 These are but two examples, typical of the
 drastic changes from a life of grinding misery that
 have come over China's millions.  They give us suf-
 ficient insight into the happiness of China's workers
 and peasants who ascribe this happiness and well-
 being, with heartfelt gratitude, to Chairman Mao Tse-
 tung and the Communist Party in whom they place
 their complete trust.
 The Chinese working class and the Chinese peo-
 ple as a whole are now struggling to implement the
 three directives laid down by Chairman Mao Tse-
 tung: e.g., to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S.
 aggression and aid Korea; to carry out the first five-
 year plan of national construction; and to convene
 the All-China People's Congress.  The first five-year
 plan is of vital importance to China.  The plan lays
 emphasis on the development of the country's indus-
 try, particularly heavy industry, to transform China
 from a backward, agricultural country into a modern,
 industrial one so that China will gradually advance
 towards a strong socialist society.  The plan is unan-
 imously and whole-heartedly supported not only by
 the labouring people throughout the country, but also
 by all the peace-loving people in the world.  The
 rapid development of China's industry will be a
 significant contribution to the cause of world peace.
 In order to fulfil the first five-year plan, many
 factories and mines throughout China have carried
 out emulation drives for increased production and
 econorny.  Many have fulfilled or even over-fulfilled

 The victory of the Chinese people means also

 VISTAS OF THE LAND OF
 NEW DEMOCRACY
 Tran Bao
 President of the Supervisory Committee of the Viet-Nam,
 General Con/ederation of Labour
 On our visits to fac-
 tories and villages, we
 saw the happy life and
 labour enthusiasm of the
 Chinese people. On May
 3, we visited the Chang-
 hsintien     Locomotive
 Plant.   More  than  50
 years old, this plant, be-
 fore it was taken over by
 the people in 1948, had
 been successively owned
 by the French and Jap-
 anese  imperialists,  the
 warlords and the Kuomintang.  In 1951, it topped
 the number of locomotives produced under the Kuo-
 mintang by 121.5 per cent, and the number of rail-
 way carriages by 508 per cent. By April 1953 it
 fulfilled 102 per cent of its production plan, the over-
 fulfilment of which was intended as part of the prep-
 arations for the International Labour Day on May
 1 and the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade
 Unions.
 The living conditions of the workers of this plant

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 have greatly improved.  Before the liberation, the
 workers very often did not have enough to eat and
 wear, and most of the workers were forced to subsist
 only on millet and maize.  Today they are not only
 amply provided with food and clothing, but also enjoy
 a full cultural life.  The plant has a library, a spare-
 time school with an enrolment of over 700 students
 and a sanatorium situated in peaceful surroundings.
 Every week workers see films at their club.  The
 workers live in their own pretty houses, and their
 wages are increasing year by year.
 We also visited Liangchia Village on the out.
 skirts of Peking.  The peasants of this village told
 us that since the liberation it had undergone radical
 changes.  One of the peasants we visited was Li
 Chung, a poor peasant before the liberation, heavily
 oppressed and exploited by the landlord.  Three of
 his children had starved to death.  But now he is
 quite well off, his eldest son is married and his young-
 est son goes to a secondary school.                                     His wife, Mrs.
 Li, opened some chests and showed us the pretty
 clothes they had recently bought and the little dresses
 and bedding for their future grandchild.
 We called on Cheng Chung-ching, a poor peas-
 ant before the liberation.  He was given land in the
 .land reform and now lives as owner in the house of
 his former landlord. Because of his initiative in pro-
 duction, he was elected model worker, and his pro-
 duction records found their way into the newspapers.
 One of the Chinese People's Volunteers has written
 to him from Korea, thanking him for supporting the
 front by conscientious production.  He showed us

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 the letter, and said that he would strive to increase
 production to support the front, to make his country
 more wealthy and prosperous and to help establish
 lasting world peace.  Today, the peasants of this
 village are organized into many mutual-aid teams;
 they are also preparing to set up an agricultural
 producers' co-operative next year.
 We have come to realize that once the peasants
 have been organized and have been given political
 and economic rights, they can contribute much to the
 revolution.  From this we have come to understand
 the importance and necessity of the decision of our
 Party and Government to mobilize the masses so that
 they themselves implement the policy regarding
 reduction of rents and interests.
 Our visit to the Peihai Kindergarten will long
 remain in our memory.  The children sang and
 danced to welcome us.  We were extremely moved
 when they asked us about the health of Chairman
 Ho Chi Minh and the children of Viet-Nam.  We took
 a look around their dining-room, playroom and class-
 rooms.  Their life is indeed a very happy one.  Here
 they receive the best type of education.  As we were
 leaving, they brought out many pictures they had
 drawn for us to give to their little friends in Viet-
 Nam.                                     I shall never forget their rosy cheeks, charm-
 ing smiles, and their sweet little faces, nor how they
 kept on waving to us as we were leaving.
 The Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions
 opened on May 2.  Apart from the trade union dele-
 gates from various parts of China, there were over
 20 foreign delegations attending the Congress, as

 well as Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the
 WFTU, and Comrade Liu Shao-chi, Secretary of the
 Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
 After hearing the speech delivered by Comrade Liu
 Shao-chi, and various other speeches and reports, we
 came to understand the great historic significance of
 the Ccngress.  The Chinese working class movement,
 led all along by the Communist Party, has achieved
 a brilliant victory.  In the past three years, condi-
 tions have been prepared for China's large-scale
 economic construction.  At the beginning of this
 year, it entered the stage of large-scale construction.
 In order to foster the initiative and creativeness of
 the working masses in accomplishing this glorious
 task, the Seventh All-China Congress of -Trade
 Unions discussed ways and means to intensify Com-
 munist education among the workers, to. raise their
 political consciousness, and to improve their cultural
 and material life.  It also discussed the international
 task of the Chinese working class, i.e., its struggle
 for the solidarity of the world working class and the
 unity of the working class movement, and its strug-
 . gle for world peace and security.  Comrade Liu
 Shao-chi stated:  "The Chinese working class which
 has already won its victory must whole-heartedly
 render all kinds of aid to the working class and
 labouring people in capitalist as well as colonial and
 semi-colonial countries."  Acting in accordance with
 the directive of Comrade Liu Shao-chi, delegates in
 their reports critically examined the defects still
 existing in their work.  They unanimously declared
 that they were determined to overcome various dif-

 ficulties so as to lead the working masses to carry
 out the large-scale national construction plan and to
 fulfil the international task of the Chinese working
 class.
 The speech of the Viet-Namese delegate was
 warmly received by the Congress.  The words "To-
 gether with the people of Khmer and Pathet Lao, the
 people of Viet-Nam are resolved to smash the French
 aggressors and the American interventionists, and
 to struggle for final victory," were greeted by thun-
 derous applause expressing support for our struggle.
 At the end of his speech, all the delegates rose and
 applauded him warmly for a long time.
 We were extremely touched by this show of real
 friendship.  A Chinese woman said to us:  "Your
 victory is near, and you are sure to win, for now you
 are strong."  These words from the mouth of an
 ordinary Chinese woman are truly expressive of the
 sincere faith the Chinese people put in the resistance
 of our people, and of their goodwill.

 more akin to us than any other people in the world.
 This makes us feel that we and the Chinese people
 are brothers.  The question how the Chinese workers
 and people in general feel towards the Japanese peo-
 ple has always been of great interest to us; now we
 have obtained a very clear answer.  Much as they
 hated the Japanese imperialists, the Chinese people
 have always cherished great friendship for the people
 of Japan.  They have drawn a sharp line between
 the Japanese people and the handful of Japanese
 rulers who calumniate China and pursue an aggres-
 sive policy against her.
 We can bear witness to the tremendous changes
 that have taken place in the new China.  This coun-
 try is progressing along a path entirely different from
 that taken by present-day Japan and the Western
 capitalist countries.  The people of China, led by the
 working class which has a staunch ally in the peas-
 antry, are now leading a free and happy life.  As
 masters of the country whose living conditions are
 constantly improving, the workers are doing their
 utmost to increase industrial production, with a con-
 sciousness worthy of their hard-won new status.
 China's peasants are now working happily and
 enthusiastically; gradually discarding their individu-
 alistic ways, millions of them have taken to co-
 operation, and are increasing their agricultural pro-
 duction through improved farming methods.  The
 wretched life of the Chinese peasant, as we used to
 know it before the liberation, has become a thing of
 the past. The students of China are attending schools
 with modern facilities; tuition fees and other expenses

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 are borne by the Government.  Trained by competent
 teachers, many of these students have been able to
 play an important part in the building of a new
 society since their graduation. The others, conscious
 of their importance as cogs in the wheel, are studying
 hard and preparing themselves for their future tasks
 with great confidence.  China's children, whose mis-
 sion it will be to build their country in the days to
 come, are regarded as the most precious property by
 the state; and as such future builders, they are ex-
 tremely well cared for.  These are the people we
 have met and seen in New China.
 When we discuss these new phenomena among
 ourselves, we cannot help asking:  Why is it that the
 great majority of the Japanese people cannot live as
 happily as the Chinese now do?  Tackling this ques-
 tion from different angles, we have traced it to two
 main causes:  (1) Japan has not yet won complete
 independence; (2) the rulers of present-day Japan
 only'protect the interests of a handful of monopoly
 capitalists.  We have come to the conclusion that the
 Japanese people must free themselves from the
 shackles of U.S. imperialism to win complete inde-
 pendence, and set up a government that protects the
 interests, not of a few monopoly capitalists, but of
 the Japanese people as a whole.  It is impossible,
 however, to achieve this end if our people are not
 united as one and if we do not have the help and
 support of all the Asian peoples. The friendship be-
 tween the peoples of China and Japan is, therefore, of
 extreme importance.  The Chinese people welcome
 more and more delegations like ours to visit their

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 country.  Seeing the facts for yourselves, you will
 realize not only the falsehood of the slanderous prop-
 aganda directed against this new China, but also the
 significance of Sino-Japanese friendship.
 There is still another important point which
 must be clarified.  Some people say that China will,
 some day, invade Japan.  I can tell you that such
 talk is nothing but lies. China and Japan are like
 brothers, both culturally and in their ways of living.
 It is China's aim to promote the prosperity of both
 to ensure a brighter futura for the two countries.
 This being the case, we must ask ourselves:  Why is
 it that the present Yoshida government forbids the
 Japanese people to come to China?  Why does it ban
 trade with China although such trade would be done
 on a basis of mutual benefit and of equality?  On
 what grounds does it base its charge that China will
 invade Japan? The answer is that such false charges
 provide the Yoshida government with a pretext for
 rearmament, for the building of more military bases
 and for putting Japan back on a war economy basis;
 but all of this will only mean greater sufferings for
 our people.  These are questions which do not worry
 me alone; in fact, they concern the Japanese people
 as a whole.  After our return to Japan, we shall dis-
 cuss them further with our compatriots.

 First, the new China is entirely different from
 the old China.  Influenced by past experience and by
 the malicious propaganda launched by U.S. imperial-
 ism, many Japanese people still think that New
 China, four years after liberation, is still the same as
 old China.  This is an entirely mistaken view.  The
 workers of New China are quite different from work-
 ers in the past.  They have become the masters of
 the country in the true sense of the word and their
 living standards have immeasurably improved.     In
 social status, they rank first among the population
 and, compared to workers in capitalist countries, their
 spirit and cultural level are excellent.
 A complete change has also taken place in the
 life of the peasants who were given land and are
 assured of a stable livelihood.  Their cultural level
 and knowledge of agricultural technique have been
 raised to an amazing degree.  Whichever village you
 visit, you will be struck by the peasants' joy over
 their liberation and by their determination for build-
 ing a new and better life.  The same may be said of
 other sections of the working population.
 At the same time, through the broadest applica-
 tion of the "mass line," the Communist Party and its
 leader, Chairman Mao Tse-tung, and the Chinese
 People's Government have achieved solid unity with
 the people.  The five hundred million people of China
 are displaying great initiative and creative power;
 they have developed Into a perfect organism for
 united action.
 We have seen the tremendous construction going
 into the building of the famous Kuanting Reservoir
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 on the Yungting River, the new machine-tool fac-
 tories and reconstructed cotton mills in Shanghai, the
 state farms and agricultural producers' co-operatives
 that have made such great achievements; we have
 seen workers' living quarters with modern conven-
 iences, workers' cultural palaces and various schools.
 The gigantic motive force which has brought about
 all this construction springs from the complete in-
 tegration of the working people-who are, in all their
 creativeness, the masters of the new China-with the
 Communist Party and the People's Government
 through the "mass line."  This is a motive force
 which will ensure the success of China's greatest
 task at the present stage: the First Five-Year Plan of
 economic construction.
 The factories we visited all had fulfilled or even
 overfulfilled their 1953 production targets already in
 November.  Today, New China has reached a high
 level not only politically, culturally, economically and
 in production technique, but also in the people's living
 standards, and is progressing at a pace second only
 to that of the Soviet Union.  Here I appeal not only
 to the working people of Japan, but also to our na-
 tional capitalists, in the hope that they will cast away
 their former outlook on China and their superiority
 complex, so that they can look objectively at China
 and learn from her.  I firmly believe that this is
 essential if the Japanese people want to overthrow
 the occupationist rule of U.S. imperialism and achieve
 national independence and peace.
 In the second place, I have to tell our country-
 men that the Chinese people stand for peace as

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 whole-heartedly as the Soviet people do.  They show
 genuine sympathy, fraternity and concern for us, the
 Japanese people.  In years past, we working people
 of Japan were hoodwinked by our imperialists and
 forced into army uniforms; as soldiers we inflicted
 long years of hardships and devastation upon the
 Chinese labouring masses.  It was this that made
 my heart heavy before I came to China.  But what
 surprised me is that the Chinese people, not only
 their leaders but also ordinary workers, peasants and
 students, all think that their enemy is Japanese im-
 perialism whose onslaught they are determined to
 check whenever necessary; that, in the aggressive
 wars against China, the Japanese working people
 were victimized, just like the Chinese people; and
 that today, as in the past, there is a common interest
 between the working people of both China and Japan.
 Fully aware of the sufferings endured in long years
 of imperialist occupation, the Chinese people are
 nevertheless deeply sympathetic towards us Japanese
 who are at present groaning under the jackboots of
 the U.S. imperialists.  They have great concern for
 our struggle for liberation, and are always ready to
 give us their. fraternal support.  These sentiments I
 have heard expressed by all sorts of people in China,
 from outstanding leaders down to primary school
 pupils wherever I went, in Peking, Nanking or
 Shanghai.
 The wild tale that the Soviet Union and China
 will attack Japan is nothing but a brazen lie, com-
 pletely without foundation, invented by the U.S. im-
 perialists in league with our domestic reactionaries.

 Such vilification only reveals the foul plot hatched
 by the U.S. imperialists and the Yoshida government
 and their attempt to use the Japanese working people
 once again as cannon fodder, in another war against
 China.  But, this time, we shall not allow this to
 happen. The Communist Parties and the Govern-
 ments of the Soviet Union and China and the
 millions of their people have no hostile intentions
 towards us Japanese.  We must, therefore, learn to
 view China from a completely different standpoint.
 The China of today is no longer the China of the
 past, and the China of tomorrow will be even more
 different.  To understand China as she is, to learn
 from the experiences of the Chinese people and
 strengthen our fraternal ties with them-these are

 WHAT THE CHINESE PEOPLE
 HAVE ACHIEVED
 S. S. Yusuf
 Vice-President of the All-India Trade Union Congress
 The May Day celebra-
 tion  was  an                                                                historical
 event, which will remain
 ever green in our memo-
 ries.  The colourful dis-
 play  in  a                                                                  disciplined

 half a million participants

 Day   parade carrying
 with them flags, banners
 and   flowers cheerfully
 and enthusiastically at Peking manifests the great
 faith the people of China repose in their leaders and
 the Government.  The joy and enthusiasm of the
 people I have noticed at the parade can be better
 imagined than described. How this miracle was
 wrought during such a short period of three and half
 years!
 During my month's tour of the country, during
 which I visited villages and industrial cities in China,
 things began to unfold themselves one by one.

 Firstly, the great transformation that has been
 brought about in the countryside in the lives of the
 peasants by agrarian reforms whereby the land
 belongs to the tiller of the soil.  This has created
 great enthusiasm among the peasants.  I visited
 several villages near Peking and Mukden and saw
 the entire life of the peasants revolutionized.  The
 peasant who was leading a life of want and starva-
 tion before the liberation, now has plenty to eat, to
 clothe himself and his family, for building new
 houses; he has also been enabled to send his children
 to school.  The Government is continuing to help
 the peasants by granting loans, seeds and improved
 implements and machinery for cultivation. - All these
 things have made it possible for the peasants to
 increase agricultural production and today China is
 not only self-sufficient in food-grains, but is in a
 position to export, whereas, before the liberation,
 food-grains were imported.
 The concern of the Government for bettering the
 circumstances of the peasants is indicated also by
 the attention paid to harnessing rivers like the Huai
 and Yungting, which used to devastate huge areas
 of lands with floods in the past.  Now these rivers
 are being controlled through the construction of
 dams.  As many as 40,000 workers are vigorously
 carrying out the construction work at the Kuanting
 Reservoir on the Yungting River under unfavourable
 weather conditions.  At the speed with which the
 work is progressing, it is likely that construction will
 be completed before the stipulated time.  When
 completed, the project will not only save many

 villages from floods, but will also provide irrigation
 in the near future for several hundred thousand
 acres of land.
 Great efforts are being made to industrialize the
 country.  At Mukden, Fushun and Shanghai, I visit-
 ed several factories.  At Mukden and Shanghai,
 heavy machine-tools like automatic high-speed lathes
 and other tools are manufactured.  The surrounding
 areas will be converted from a state of destitution
 and hunger into a land of plenty and joy.
 The patriotic zeal shown by the peasants is
 confirmed by the formation of several thousands of
 mutual-aid teams and agricultural producers' co-
 operatives.  The initiative shown by every peasant in
 organizing collective discussions to improve the
 methods of agriculture indicates the new life spring-
 ing up in the villages of New China.
 The factories which were merely repair shops
 before the liberation are now being converted into
 manufacturing centres.   Workers  are performing
 their day-to-day work with fervent zeal and en-
 thusiasm.  Their supreme object is to industrialize
 their motherland  rapidly.  Many model workers
 have emerged from the labour emulation drives.
 They have all opportunities to display their skill,
 with the result that many of the innovations they
 evolved have been installed in the factories.  These
 latest methods have not only reduced the amount of
 labour, but also improved working conditions.
 At the Fushun open-cut mine, as well as in the
 pits, the process of extracting coal has been highly
 mechanized.  The huge oil refinery at Fushun, manti-

 facturing gasoline and various other by-products
 from shale, bears ample testimony to the progress
 made in the industrial field.
 in Shanghai, I visited the Textile Machinery
 Works. -The huge automatic machinery used for
 moulding is a marvellous innovation, the like of
 which I had not seen before.  I was amazed when
 I was told that this was an invention of the workers.
 This confirmed my belief that, given proper en-
 couragement and opportunities, the workers exhibit
 great skill beyond all imagination.
 I was deeply impressed by the great attention
 paid by the management and the Government to
 labour protection by improved working conditions,
 e.g., the proper casing of transmission belts, in-
 stallation of air-conditioning at factories to keep the
 temperature at the work-spot cool, and proper ven-
 tilation to avoid injurious gases.
 The wages of the workers have been constantly
 rising, year after year.  In addition to improved
 standards of living, many model workers have been
 promoted to the rank of director and deputy director
 in the factories.  Huge amounts are set apart for
 rewarding the workers who suggest improvements
 in the use of machinery.
 The Government appropriates annually a great
 sum for the construction of living quarters for the
 workers.  Many workers who were living in hovels
 for long years are now housed decently with all
 modern amenities like running water, electricity and
 proper sanitation.
 The Labour Insurance Regulations which have
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 been enforced in all enterprises, whether state-owned
 or private, fully safeguard the workers during sick-
 ness, and temporary or permanent disablement re-
 sulting from accidents.  Special care is bestowed on
 the women workers. Maternity benefits are drawn
 from the Labour Insurance fund.
 One very remarkable feature of labour welfare
 activities is the provision of spare-time rest homes,
 hospitals for workers and sanatoria at well-known
 health resorts.  In China, the worker as the pro-
 ducer of wealth is fully cared for.  Homes for the
 aged have also been established, with all modern
 comforts of civilized living.
 Unemployment has been completely eradicated.
 Workers have no fear of the morrow or insecurity of
 employment.
 Today, great emphasis is laid on the training of
 cadres to man the huge projects and factories that
 are springing up.  Special facilities are afforded in
 technical colleges to students of workers' and peas-
 ants' origin.  At the People's University at Peking,
 the Institute of Technology at Mukden, the College
 of Textile Technology at Shanghai and the Engineer-
 ing College at Canton, several thousands of students
 are studying free of any expense.  Not only is there
 no tuition fee; even board and lodging expenses are
 met by the Government.  Students in need of clothes
 and other necessities are also provided for.
 Another very notable feature of the new life that
 is surging forth in China is the provision of equal
 opportunities for women. They are treated on a par
 with men and given the same pay, on the principle
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 of equal pay for equal work. Today, women are
 seen doing highly skilled work and, in some cases,
 managing factories.  Women have been completely
 liberated from the thraldom to which they were sub-
 jected for ages.
 The  eradication of  bribery,  corruption  and
 nepotism has created a great enthusiasm among the
 people.  Beggary and prostitution have also been
 eliminated and become things of the past.
 The criticism occasionally levelled by reaction-
 aries at the lack of civil liberties in China is not
 borne out by the facts.  We have been free to go
 wherever we liked and to meet people.  Further, the
 people are allowed to criticize the actions of the
 Government through their newspapers.  The Gov-
 ernment has adopted criticism and self-criticism as
 the basis for development.  This is proved by the
 highly self-critical reports made at the Seventh All-
 China Congress of Trade Unions in the presence of
 many international delegates.
 Even though such commendable achievements
 have been accomplished, yet the leaders of China are
 very modest and one cannot find any trace of
 arrogance in them.  I am fully convinced that they
 are pursuing peaceful construction to industrialize
 their motherland with patriotic zeal and fervour.
 Therefore, they love peace above all and their aim is
 to defend world peace.  If the mad warmongers of
 American imperialism think they can subdue China,
 they are thoroughly mistaken.  The Chinese people
 who have paid a great price for their liberation and

 who now enjoy the truils, of this liberation know that
 no power on earth can enslave them.
 In conclusion, I thank the people of China and
 the workers and leaders of the All-China Federation
 of Trade Unions for the warm reception accorded to
 us wherever we went and the care and hospitality
 shown us.  Finally, I salute the great people of
 China and wish them great success in their construc-
 tion work and assure them that, on return to our
 country, we will utilize the lessons and experiences
 gained during this visit.

 NEW SP1111T IN THE LAND
 S. Saksena
 President of the All-India Sugar Mill and Distillery
 Workers' Federation
 I came to China as an
 impartial but sympathetic
 and eager student of the
 Great  Chinese            Revolu-
 tion. I am not a member
 of the Communist Party
 of India and my testi-
 mony can therefore be
 regarded as that of an
 impartial observer. I am
 a member and one of the
 chief organizers of the
 All-India  Kisan  a n d
 Mazdoor    Praja  Party,
 i.e., the All India People's
 Party under the leadership
 of workers and peasants, in the largest Indian prov-
 ince, the province of Uttar Pradesh which has a
 population of nearly 63 millions.
 The thing which has impressed us most power-
 fully is the spirit which the new Government in China
 has infused in the people.  The May Day Parade and
 the celebrations by the common people in the Tien
 An Men Square at night after the Parade gave the

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 most powerful demonstration of this spirit, which
 has permeated the masses.  All pe ple, men, women
 and children of all ages in China seem to feel that
 they have a great destiny and that this destiny can
 be realized under the new People's Government and
 its leader, their beloved Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
 For the fulfilment of this great destiny of the Chinese
 people, every individual, man, woman and child
 seems anxious to do his or her utmost.  It seems
 that the achievement of the Government during the
 last two and a half years has produced in the people
 unbounded faith and confidence in the wisdom,
 goodness and creative ability of this Government.
 It may be that there are still many hidden enemies,
 consisting of those who have lost their previous
 positions and opportunities to indulge in luxury, but
 we are convinced that the vast majority and the
 overwhelming masses of the people are solidly
 behind the new Government.  This is our impres-
 sion No. I and we Indian delegates are unanimous
 about it.
 We have tried to find out how the new Govern-
 ment and ils leaders have succeeded in infusing this
 new spirit amongst the people.  The personal ex-
 ample of the topmost leaders of the Government and
 their unbounded trust in the people appear to be
 the secret of success of the new Government.  The
 policies which the new Government has put into
 effect in the last two and a half years are the result
 of mature experience in the last thirty years of the
 revolutionary war which was led by these same
 leaders of the present Government.  In fact, the

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Agrarian Reform Law which the new Government
 has put into effect during the last two and a half
 years, and which probably is their greatest and most
 revolutionary achievement, is nothing but the out-
 growth of directives issued by Chairman Mao Tse-
 tung as early as 1933 for distribution of land during
 the guerilla warfare against the Kuomintang forces
 and the reactionary landlords.
 During the last thirty years of their revolution-
 ary struggle and by practical administration of large
 areas which they liberated and administrated during
 all this period, these leaders have acquired a perfect
 knowledge of the needs and psychology of their peo-
 ple and they have before them a clear-cut vision of
 the new China of their dreams which they know how
 to build and construct.  They have, therefore, wasted
 no time on foolish experiments but have set about
 their business in right earnest.  The way in which
 they have put an end to corruption which was so
 rampant under the Kuomintang regime and the speed
 with which they have put an end to inflation and
 stabilized the currency and prices is unique in his-
 tory.  The land reform which has already liberated
 over 350 millions of people and which it is proposed
 to carry through amongst the remaining 125 millions
 of people in the next two and a half years has released
 such tremendous enthusiasm among the rural masses
 that the production per acre of land has almost
 doubled.  Everywhere in the fields we have seen
 amazing bumper crops all through our travels.  We
 have found that though there are still poor people
 in China and the standard of life is low in some vil-
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 lages, still there is plenty of food and nobody starves
 for want of it.  It is obviously due to the increase in
 agricultural production, which has resulted from the
 land reform.
 The manner in which the land reform has been
 carried out shows the practical ability, experience
 and far-sightedness of the new Government and its
 leaders.  That they were allegedly deviating from
 Marxist theory did not trouble them at all.  Social-
 ism for them is an ideal which has to be achieved
 through many stages.  Therefore, we find that al-
 though the landlord class has been liquidated, the
 rich peasant and the well-to-do peasant classes and
 the national bourgeoisie have been allowed to live
 and are even regarded as fulfilling an essential func-
 tion in the economy of New China.  Even the land-
 lords have not been physically annihilated, and they
 have been allowed to live and earn their livelihood
 like all honest citizens.
 The practical advantage of this wise method has
 been that the Government has antagonized only a
 microscopic minority in the villages, i.e., the land-
 lords who did not form even one percent of the rural
 population.*  The ten percent of the rich peasants
 and almost an equal number of well-to-do peasants
 have been neutralized by this wise policy and this
 has enabled the land reform to be completed smoothly
 * According to the report on the Agrarian Reform Law
 made in June 1950 by Liu Shao-chi, Vice-Chairman of the
 Central People's Government, landlords and rich peasants
 constituted less than 10 percent of China's rural population

 without any powerful opposition.  Gradually the rich
 peasants and the well-to-do peasants as well as the
 national bourgeoisie are realizing the anomaly of
 their position in the new set-up and it should not
 take much time to convert them, and particularly
 their children, through political education to social-
 ism when that stage arrives.  The transition to
 socialism will be a long process but already the wis-
 dom of farming through mutual-aid groups and co-
 operative and collective farming is being realized by
 the rural masses in villages where mutual-aid groups
 have been formed and co-operatives and collective
 farms have been introduced.  This wise policy of the
 new Government has enabled the greatest agrarian
 revolution in history to be accomplished without
 almost any bloodshed or even large-scale resistance.
 In fact, it has been the most peaceful agrarian revolu-
 tion in history and it has laid the foundations of all
 future industrialization and the progress of China
 towards its cherished goal.
 Ours is a trade union delegation and naturally
 we were most interested in studying the role of the
 trade unions in the new set-up in China.  Trade
 unions in our country are constantly engaged in
 struggle with the management for better wages and
 better conditions of service and the Government very
 often backs the capitalists.  The management and
 even the Government very often look upon trade
 unions as a necessary evil and they seldom take them
 into confidence.  Often they try to divide the unity
 of labour by sponsoring yellow trade unions which
 are able to exist and function only on account of the
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 patronage of the Government.  The trade unions on
 the other hand are constantly engaged in devising
 sanctions and forging strength for the fulfilment of
 their most elementary demands, through various
 methods including strikes.
 Here in China the situation is entirely different.
 So the functions and the responsibilities of the trade
 unions are also completely different.  Here in China
 you have a People's Government.  The trade unions
 are, therefore, the real rulers of New China.
 Though the organization of the trade unions is
 separate and distinct from that of the Government,
 yet there is such close liaison and co-operation be-
 tween the trade unions and the government organ-
 ization at every level that they work in complete
 unison.  It was, therefore, that although our various
 trade union delegations had been invited by the All-
 China Federation of Trade Unions and we were their
 guests, yet for all practical purposes we were the
 guests of the People's Government of China.  It is
 this complete identity of the trade unions and the
 government organizations that ensures to the work-
 ing class its leading role in the direction of the Peo-
 ple's Government of China.  The trade unions in
 China, therefore, are the means through which the
 Government secures the co-operation and guidance of
 the working people in the formulation and carrying
 out of their policies.
 We were greatly struck by the marvellous enthu-
 siasm of the workers for increasing production.  This
 enthusiasm was mainly due to the fact that every
 worker feels that it is his government and he must
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 do his utmost to help the Government in increasing
 production and in carrying out government policies
 and  programmes.   The  Government  has  large
 schemes for raising not only the standard of living
 of the workers but also for raising the political con-
 sciousness and the intellectual level of the workers
 as a whole and of the leading cadres of the trade
 unions in particular.  The People's University at
 Peking was a wonderful demonstration of the anxiety
 of the Government to equip the most promising
 cadres of the trade unions with the highest education
 and learning.  Our visit to the factories at Mukden
 and Shanghai has given us the most happy experi-
 ence of our life.  The workers' clubs, dormitories,
 theatres, sanatoria, creches, clinics, cultural palaces
 and numerous other amenities which have been pro-
 vided for them show that the Government pays its
 highest attention to the well-being of the workers.
 Naturally, therefore, the workers regard the Govern-
 ment as their own.  They are, therefore, every minute
 doing their best to help the Government and to in-
 crease production.    We could not get detailed figures
 and statistics about wages and production in each
 factory owing to the hurried nature of our visit and
 the limited time at our disposal.  But it was obvious
 that the condition of the workers is much happier
 today than what it was before under the Kuomintang
 rule.  The system of honouring the most efficient
 workers by calling them model workers and labour
 heroes raises the enthusiasm of all the workers in
 their work, and encourages everyone to emulate these

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 labour heroes in producing more and more at less
 cost and in less time.
 The most remarkable demonstration of the work-
 ers' enthusiasm in their work was seen during our
 visit to the Huai River Project.  We have larger river
 valley projects in India like the Damodar Valley pro-
 ject, the Bakha Naugal project and several others
 like these.  But the manner in which the Huai River
 Project has been completed is unique and incompa-
 rable.  With almost no machinery, this project has
 been completed with record speed and the millions of
 people who have worked in completing the project
 have been inspired with a strange zeal and enthu-
 siasmn.  This enthusiasm for production with the
 highest speed and at the cheapest cost and with the
 minimum amount of waste is the highest achieve-
 ment of the new Government and is its greatest asset.
 While so great an emphasis is paid to production
 in New China we were greatly impressed to find that
 the cultural development of the people is not given
 a secondary place.  In. fact the most useful lesson
 that China has to teach is the manner in which litera-
 ture, art, music, drama, cinema and radio have been
 harnessed to increase the people's enthusiasm for
 production,  and for fulfilling the Common Pro-
 gramme of the People's Government.  In this man-
 ner, literature and art have themselves been enriched
 and have been carried to the masses. They now re-
 flect the sentiments and the feelings of the masses.
 This is a very great achievement.
 Another very striking feature of Now China is
 its wonderful women and children.  The equality of
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 man and woman has become a concrete fact here.
 The enthusiasm of women is marvellous.  We have
 seen them working in fields as well as in factories.
 They even do heavy work in machine-tool factories.
 And they seem to be so happy under these new condi-
 tions.
 But what we shall never forget are the children
 of New China.  Their discipline is wonderful and
 their enthusiasm unbounded.  We can never forget
 the affection with which they welcomed and greeted
 us everywhere throughout China.
 Many people in India believe that the peace
 movement is merely a propaganda of the Communist
 Party of India.  But in China we realized how in-
 tense is the longing for peace.  Those alone who
 have known the horrors of war can realize the value
 of the peace movement. India was fortunately spared
 from the actual horrors of war.  The peace movement
 in India is therefore confined to the intellectuals.  In
 China it is a mass movement.     The longing for peace
 is real and genuine.  It is also a national necessity.
 Given ten years of peace, China's reconstruction will
 be completed, and it will have marched very for to-
 wards its cherished goal of socialism.  We are, there-
 fore, convinced that the Chinese peace movement is
 real and genuine, and its 475 million people are all
 for peace.
 The peace movement led by Soviet Russia and
 China embracing 700 million people is, therefore, in
 our opinion one of the greatest bulwarks of world
 peace.
 The Chinese people's love and admiration for the

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Russian people and its leader Marshal Stalin is re-
 markable.  Soviet Russia has given real help to the
 Chinese people to carry out their reconstruction pro-
 gramme.  The alliance of Soviet Russia and the Peo-
 ple's China is not an alliance of convenience or polit-
 ical strategy but it is a genuine and deep-rooted
 unity.  This unity is bound to grow more and more
 as the years pass by.
 The world was amazed at the heroism of the
 Korean people and the Chinese Volunteers who help-
 ed the Koreans to resist American aggression so
 successfully.  We now know the secret of this suc-
 cess of the Chinese people.  It is the new spirit of
 the Chinese people which Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 has infused in them.  This spirit is invincible.  It is
 unconquerable.  The American bacteriological war-
 fare cannot bend this new spirit of the Chinese people
 and the atom bombs cannot conquer it.

 and America during my 28 years of trade-union life.
 I will never forget the little children and the youth
 of New China who welcome us so well and who are
 playing a very enthusiastic part in the building of a
 new era.  This is the most encouraging feature of
 this country.
 In the first place, the wonderful May Day Parade
 in the Tien An Men Square in Peking has left an
 unforgettable impression on my mind  and was
 symbolical of the fact that all sections of the com-
 munity are politically conscious of the great role they
 are called upon to play in the building of a socialist
 economy and May Day is the occasion for celebration
 of their determination.
 Before I came to China, I had the feeling that I
 was going to see a country with signs of war damage
 everywhere and a poor railway system.  Under the
 leadership of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, New China
 has completely effected her economic recovery and is
 well on the road for fulfilment and even overfulfil-
 ment of her Five-Year Plan for economic advance-
 ment towards socialism.
 Her railways are not only well maintained but
 are being expanded at a rate not to be compared with
 any other part of the world.  I have so far travelled
 some 4,000 kilometers on the Chinese railways and
 the impression I have is that maintenance is second
 to none, and in a short period the standard of
 management will be ahead of many so-called ad-
 vanced countries.  The bad legacy left over by for-
 eign imperialists, bureaucrats, and capitalists is being
 rapidly liquidated and several innovations are being

 introduced to increase the efficiency of rail transport.
 I had the pleasure of meeting at Mukden Comrade
 Tien Kwei-ying, China's first woman locomotive
 driver and hearing from her first hand how she was
 trained to become such a good model worker.
 The railway wages system in India has all the
 symbols of an old capitalist society with a variety of
 grades providing for the highest official a wage ex-
 ceeding 50 times the earnings of the lowest paid
 worker.  In the Chinese, railways, it does not exceed
 more than five times for the corresponding categories
 of workers and the principle followed is each accord-
 ing to his labour and it is amazing to observe how
 the workers determine their wages.
 The railway workshops I visited are doing a
 magnificent job and are models of enthusiastic co-
 operation between the administration and the work-
 ers.                               The railways are run in the interests of the
 country and for the development of her national re-
 construction.
 The success of the management of Chinese in-
 dustrial concerns is due to the close co-operation be-
 tween the managerial staff and the trade unions.
 The enthusiasm and the political consciousness of
 the workers are the keynote everywhere and careful
 planning and keen desire not only to fulfil but over-
 fulfil the targets are in evidence everywhere.
 The new land reform has demonstrated how in-
 crease in agricultural production can be secured and
 the standard of life improved for the peasants.  The
 new river valley projects are calculated to avert
 famine and benefit the peasantry.

 The interesting and instructive report of Com-
 rade Lai Jo-yu at the Seventh All-China Congress of
 Trade Unions showed how industrial production re-
 sults have been achieved and improvements in pro-
 ductivity effected both in quantity and quality.  His
 report gave a note of warning against bureaucratic,
 economist and syndicalist tendencies in trade unions
 and rightly emphasized that improved standards of
 living cannot be divorced from production results.
 Stabilization of commodity prices is a great achieve-
 ment.
 The delegations from foreign countries gave the
 Congress the character of an international labour
 conference and it was truly stressed that, without
 peace, democracy and socialism will be jeopardized
 and that it should be the joint endeavour of the work-
 ers of the world to unite and strive for peace.
 The people and the Government in China are
 determined to build for socialism.  I congratulate
 the workers and peasants of New China on their
 magnificent achievements and I wish them all hap-
 piness and success in completing their new Five-Year
 Plan ahead of schedule.

 Technological -Institute' which is housed almost en-
 tirely'in new buildings.  We examined their methods.
 of construction with great interest.  They have a

 conditions in the various industries. The first place
 we visited was Shenyang (Mukden) in Northeast
 China.  Leaving Peking at 3 p.m. on May 14, 1953,
 we arrived at Shenyang at nine the next morning.
 At the railway station we were warmly received by

 very large number of students-over six thousand!
 We were told that last year 1,500 students graduated
 from the Institute.  Class-rooms were completed only
 two years ago.  Most of the students live in.  The
 many buildings-administration offices, class-rooms,
 with student dormitories on top-were very impres-
 sive.  All the students were very earnestly at work:
 at lectures, in the laboratory or doing other practical
 work. Whenever they had time the students would
 join the workers while construction was still in pro-
 gress on the school buildings.  On one of the largest
 buildings the foundation had just been laid and
 ground work was beginning. We were amazed to
 learn that the building would be completed in August
 -only three months off!
 In the morning of May 16 we visited an indus-
 trial exhibition where the display of all sorts of
 machinery, from iron smelting to the manufacture of
 porcelain and glass-ware-all made in the People's
 Republic of China--thrilled us.  In one section of
 the exhibition peasants ,'were shown how to make and
 use fertilizer. The industrial exhibition was arranged
 in two parts-actual products in one, charts statistics
 in the other-to show how China was to be trans-
 formed into a socialist country.                                            We did not have
 time to go through all the rooms of the exhibition.
 But what we were able to take in was immensely in-
 teresting.
 In the afternoon that day we visited a machine
 works.  This was the first time in my life that I saw
 such a big factory.  We saw Soviet-made machines
 and similar machines that were being turned out by

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 that factory.  All the workers were very busy.  The
 factory had been severely damaged by the Japanese
 invaders during the war; now it was almost com-
 pletely restored.  Before the liberation, the workers
 had been on the verge of starvation; now they lived
 well.  This visit to a factory was convincing evidence
 of China's assured industrial progress.
 The following day, we went to a coal mine near
 Fushun where we spent the whole day from 10:30
 a.m. onwards. In the town, new workers' residences
 were to be seen everywhere.  We went into the open-
 cut mine.  There were two parallel tracks on every
 level.  Electric trolleys delivered the coal to a point
 from which other electric trolleys took it to the dump-
 ing ground.  The car by which we travelled into the
 mine was also electrically operated.  To our delight,
 we found that every part of the mining process was
 power-operated.  Working conditions were, here too,
 greatly improved and the workers' living standards
 rising steadily.
 In the late afternoon, we paid a visit to the home
 for the aged and the nursery established by the col-
 liery.  The nursery had spacious, bright rooms; bath-
 rooms were spotless.  We were entertained with a
 performance by the children.  In the home for the
 aged, everything was neat and tidy, too.  The oldest
 inmate was 85 years of age.   All rooms were very
 nicely furnished, some even beautifully.  When we
 talked to these old people, they told us of their suf-
 ferings under Chiang Kai-shek's rule; they pointed
 to the contrast in their life now, under the loving care
 of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Tse-

 tung. The home was comfortable. All workers enjoy
 labour insurance which grants them pensions in
 their old age.
 We did not have enough time to see all of Fu-
 shun.  But what we saw in the way of the number of
 schools convinced us that a great deal was being
 done in education and culture.  It was already dark
 when we left the mining; town.
 On the morning of May 18 we visited a village.
 We were particularly interested in seeing it because
 it was at some distance from the railway line and the
 highway.  The village consisted of about one hun-
 dred households; at each of these, outbuildings and
 farm implements were in good order.  The peasants
 were eating well and their women were well-dressed.
 We also visited the village school which was neat and
 well-kept. The village had two co-operatives.  The
 people told us that the peasants who had formerly
 been very poor now had surplus grain and that they,
 whose homesteads used to be seized by the land-
 lords, could now safely call their homes their own.
 We also learned that formerly only 35 out of 105
 school-age children had been able to attend school
 and that of these 35, 15 were from landlords' families.
 Now there were 127 children of school-age and all
 of them could go to school.  We visited a nursery
 that had 20 children and four nurses to care for them.
 The nursery's library had several hundred books,
 showing what emphasis was placed on proper educa-
 tion.  I took notes on some of the interesting things
 we saw in this village:  They had, for instance, a
 chart showing how much rice had been produced in
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 the previous year and how, much would be -produced
 this year; another chart showed how much fertilizer
 was required to produce how much rice.  It seemed
 this small village was quite advanced;. but if this
 small village, was so advanced, .then it. was easy
 to imagine the, advances made by other villages
 throughout the People's Republic of China.
 We saw many two- or three-storied houses with
 modern conveniences recently built and many more
 going up. -Clothing is unpretentious; all dress in
 blue cotton uniforms.  Under Chiang Kai-shek's re-
 gime, the working people were in rags; now they not
 only have adequate clothing, but also special clothes
 to suit the type of work each worker is engaged in.
 While in the past, the workers were continuously
 threatened by starvation and often had nothing but
 wild herbs to eat,- they now have rice regularly and
 other nutritious foods and are entirely free from the
 want of food and clothing.
 With progress made in communications 'and dis-
 tances greatly shortened, goods move freely from one
 part of the.country to the other.  As wages have been
 rising, the workers have been able to buy bicycles,
 wrist watches and radio sets.      There is no need to
 worry about getting an education since everybody
 can attend school and new schools have been estab-
 lished in great numbers.

 Joint Statement by the Delegation of the
 All-Indonesia Central Organization of
 Trade Unions (SOBSI) and the
 Delegation of the Federation
 of Indonesian Trade
 Unions  (GSBI)
 At the invitation of the All-China Federation of
 Trade Unions, delegations of the All-Indonesia Cen-
 tral Organization of Trade Unions and the Federa-
 tion of Indonesian Trade Unions, which are the two
 largest trade union organizations in Indonesia, parti-
 cipated in the 1953 May Day celebrations in Peking
 and attended the Seventh All-China Congress of
 Trade Unions.  After that, the delegates went on a
 sight-seeing tour of various places in New China,
 from Shenyang (Mukden) in the north to Canton in
 the south.
 The delegates saw with their own eyes the social
 transformation taking place in the largest country in
 Asia, transformation of an agricultural country into
 an industrial power.  This transformation is now
 being pushed ahead at a fast pace with the great
 First Five-Year Plan of economic and industrial con-
 struction.

 with other trade union delegates from Asia, Europe,

 Africa and Australia, have had the opportunity of
 visiting factories, cities and villages.  They have ob-
 tained first-hand knowledge of the life of all strata of
 the Chinese people who overthrew the corrupt Kuo-
 mintang regime which had been supported by the
 imperialists.  They have paid particular attention to
 the heroic expression of patriotism of New China's
 working class in creative emulation drives in the
 building up of the country which is now their own.
 Thanks to the deep concern in the workers' material
 and cultural life displayed by the Government of the
 People's Republic of China, the Chinese workers'
 standard of living is going up daily.  New living
 quarters, sanatoria, hospitals, nurseries and spare-
 time schools for workers are being built all the time.
 Labour insurance, old-age pensions and other social
 amenities receive the attention of the trade unions and
 the Government.
 This visit has convinced the Indonesian trade
 union delegates that the workers play an important
 part in the building of their country.  The workers
 can be filled with high labour enthusiasm only when
 they realize that they are working for their mother-
 land and not for monopoly capitalists.
 The working class plays a leading part in the
 struggle for complete national independence.  Re-
 calling the struggle of the Shanghai workers, the
 Indonesian trade union delegates realize how acute
 this struggle was against oppression by the Japanese
 fascists and the Kuomintang rulers.  The ruthless
 slaughter of workers' leaders could not cow the
 Shanghai workers, imbued with patriotism as they

 were.  They carried on the fight for their rights to
 the very moment the People's  Liberation Army
 marched into Shanghai.
 At present the primary task of China's trade
 unions is to mobilize all forces for increased produc-
 tion, so as to carry out China's First Five-Year Plan.
 Having noted the efficiency shown by China's
 workers, in building the Kuanting Reservoir and in
 the manufacture of all kinds of machines, the Indone-
 sian trade union delegates are convinced that the
 Chinese workers .will be able to accomplish their
 tasks with brilliant results.
 The daily growing prosperity of New China and
 the daily rising living standards of its workers are a
 great contribution to world peace and international
 trade.  They also greatly inspire the Indonesian peo-
 ple who have always been shackled by round-table
 conference agreements and are striving for complete
 independence.
 It is the hope of the Indonesian delegates that
 the Indonesian workers. will also be able to lead a
 life as the Chinese workers do, and to contribute
 their immediate efforts to the build-up of their coun-
 try and to the defence of their national interests.
 The workers of New China have many things the
 Indonesian workers can learn, especially their ex-
 periences both in the struggle before the liberation
 and in national construction at present.  The In-

 feel happy now that they

 magnificent successes for
 the benefit of the people

 In Chungking, for instance, the workers com-
 pleted thousands of new houses in order to greet the
 approaching May Day Festival; and so, thousands of
 workers with their families are now able to celebrate
 May Day in new homes with modern conveniences.
 Last year, China appropriated 2,800,000 million yuan
 for building new houses for the people; these provide
 pleasant living quarters for a million workers and
 their families.
 During the labour emulation movement to greet
 May Day, another dam, 697 metres long, was com-

 pleted on the Huai River.  In the past, particularly
 under the corrupt rule of Chiang Kai-shek's govern-
 ment, floods caused death and injury to thousands of
 people, destroyed millions of yuan worth of property,
 good rice fields and land. But now, after the com-
 pletion of the Sanho Dam, 1,720,000 hectares of rice
 fields will be irrigated.  In consequence, the peasants
 and other inhabitants of the area will be able to live
 happy, prosperous lives.
 In my country, the people's health is miserably
 neglected.  Even Minister of Health Dr. Leimena
 despairs when he is faced with the situation of one
 doctor to 60,000 patients, and of 10,000 people fight-
 ing over eight accommodations in a hospital!  In
 China we found an entirely different situation. Pe=
 king, with a population of 2,400,000 (less than the
 population of Djakarta), has 10 large hospitals, not
 counting the clinics sponsored by every factory,
 school and organization.
 In our country, according to the statistics of the
 Indonesian Teachers' Association and the Ministry of
 Culture and Education, 2,300,000 children of school-
 age cannot go to school as a result of the lack of
 school buildings and teachers.  These children, un-
 able to obtain the necessary scientific schooling, thus
 cannot become educated and useful people.  In the
 People's Republic of China, not only have great
 numbers of school buildings been erected for the
 country's younger generation who will be the pillars
 of her future.  But 152 parks and cultural palaces
 have also been established for them.  This number
 does not include the cultural establishments and

 stadiums in all the factories and mines.  Nor does it
 include the 20,000 dramatic, dancing and choral
 troupes that entertain the people with their perform-
 ances and inspire them with greater energy for the
 country's large-scale economic construction, for a
 happier future and for a lasting world peace.
 Since all the people are now living lives of hap-
 piness and prosperity, and since their cultural as well
 as material requirements are being satisfied, it is na-
 tural they should make May Day such a gay event.
 We saw 500,000 workers, peasants, students, Young
 Pioneers, women, athletes, artists and writers, carry-
 ing many-coloured flowers and flags, marching in
 columns 5 kilometres long.  They cheered their be-
 loved leader, Chairman Mao Tse-tung with songs and
 shouts and slogans for three whole hours.
 To-day, the Chinese workers and the Chinese
 people have achieved their emancipation and are
 leading a happy life.  But they are not stopping at
 this.  In fact, they are aiming at further progress.
 The Chinese working class, which played a major
 role in the liberation struggle and is now playing the
 major role in national construction for the benefit of
 the entire people, is whole-heartedly behind the
 Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions.  All
 the minds and thoughts of China's workers are con-
 centrated on one thing: how to guarantee the fulfil-
 ment of the Five-Year Plan of construction which will
 bring still greater happiness to the people.
 The success of the Congress of the Chinese work-
 ing class and the launching of the Five-Year Plan
 constitute part of the victories won by the people in

 their fight for freedom and peace, against imperialism
 and the warmongers.  Hence, every victory won by
 the freedom and peace-loving people is also a victory
 for our Indonesian people.
 The victory of the Chinese working class and
 the Chinese people under the brilliant leadership
 of Chairman Mao Tse-tung was possible only after a
 long series of bitter and persistent struggles.  If the
 Chinese workers and the Chinese people have succeed-
 ed in changing their life into one of happiness and
 prosperity, that is the result of the struggle by the
 masses themselves based upon the policy of a national
 united front of all democratic and patriotic people,
 regardless of political or religious belief, in the
 struggle against imperialism, for better living con-
 ditions, complete national independence, democracy
 and lasting world peace.
 The theory of such a struggle has been put into
 practice in China.  What is more, the correctness of
 this theory has thus been proved.  We have seen
 with our own eyes the magnificent accomplishments
 achieved with this theory.
 The people of Indonesia must come to believe that,
 by strengthening our national united front and inter-
 national unity, we will be successful in our fight
 for better living conditions, for complete national
 independence and for a lasting world peace.

 as well as achievements
 It is twenty-five days
 since we came to the
 People's   Republic   of
 China.  During this time,
 we  saw  the May     Day
 celebrations;  we   took
 part in the Seventh All-
 China Congress of Trade
 Unions, held in Peking;
 we visited other big cities
 and also villages where
 we  could  observe  the
 large-scale economic con-
 struction now going on,
 made in the cultural and
 educational fields; we were able to come into contact
 with workers, peasants, intellectuals, university stu-
 dents, children . . . the old as well as the young.
 In Indonesia as ;:n other countries, which are
 still under direct or indirect imperialist domination,
 we were given to believe that the freedom of religious
 belief, of political conviction, of trade, and even of
 loving one's own kinsmen is suppressed in the Soviet
 Union and in the People's Democracies, including

 the People's Republic of China.  That this is contrary
 to fact has been shown by the Moslem member of our
 Indonesian delegation.  He had the opportunity of
 meeting freely with Moslems in Shanghai.  He found
 that they are free to exercise their religious rights.
 In Djakarta there are only six mosques for more
 than 2,500,000 Moslems in the city, whereas in
 Shanghai there are 13 mosques for only 30,000
 Moslems.  One of, the Shanghai mosques was in
 bad repair during the Japanese occupation and the
 Kuomintang regime.  But after the liberation, the
 district people's government appropriated 270,000,000
 yuan (270,000 rupiah) to repair it and to install
 modern conveniences.
 The imperialists have been shouting that personal
 freedom is suppressed in the Soviet Union, in the
 People's Democracies and in the People's Republic
 of China.  If there were any suppression in China
 at all, then it had been directed against the activities
 of a few, which were detrimental to the interests of
 the people as a whole, activities which should be
 suppressed.  This suppression started in January
 1952. with the "San Fan"* and "Wu Fan"** mass
 movements.
 The people throughout the -country took an
 energetic and conscious part in both these move-
 *
 A movement among government workers against cor-
 ruption, waste and bureaucratism.
 **,A movement among industrialists and traders against
 the bribery of government workers, tax evasion, theft of
 state property, cheating on government contracts and stealing
 economic information for private speculation.

 ments.  Since then, everyone in China is helping to
 do away with bad practices in daily life.  We have
 seen with our own eyes some of the achievements
 of these mass movements.
 For instance:  One day, when we took a walk,
 we saw an iron box with a glass top at a busy street-
 corner.  Inside the box. were postcards, stamps and
 envelopes.  Many people took some of these out by
 themselves, then dropped the money into the box.
 No one was there to watch the box, but then nobody
 cheated.
 In Indonesia, appropriations for culture and
 education constituted only 8.9 per cent of the 1951
 budget, but in the People's China 14.9 per cent of the
 1953 budget, a sum of 34,807,700 million yuan
 (equivalent to approximately 34,807,700,000 rupiah),
 was allocated for this purpose.  And this at a time
 of national economic construction which is taking
 up 44.34 per cent of the total 1953 budget.
 With the achievements in national economic
 construction, the rate of the increases in the wages
 of the working people in 1952 ranged from 60 to 120
 per cent, as compared with 1949.  In a textile mill
 we visited, we were not surprised to find that among
 the 340 workers 110 owned wrist watches; 102 had
 purchased a total of 323 books, and 95 per cent of the
 workers went to the cinema three times a week because
 nowadays films are educational as well as recreational.
 To meet the ever-increasing people's demand for
 culture, the People's Government has produced and
 shown 143 feature and documentary films.  Besides,
 Soviet, Czech, Polish, Hungarian and other educa-

 tional films, on the topics of democracy, socialism
 and world peace have been widely shown in China.
 In 1950, 146,380,000 people saw films; in the first
 half of 1952, this number had risen to 213,500,000.
 We have been greatly impressed by the fact that the
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions has 500 pro-
 jection teams with 817 cine-projectors touring the
 country to show films exclusively to workers . . . a
 fact impossible at present in Indonesia.
 The main task of these projection teams is the
 political and cultural education of the workers.
 Apart from 2,436 cultural centres set up-in the
 whole country, the workers are given material assist-
 ance to carry on cultural activities at places where
 they work, in factories as well as in government or-
 ganizations.  The owners of the enterprises or the
 administration appropriate funds for cultural ex-
 penses -not deducted from the workers' wages -
 equivalent to 1.5 per cent of the total workers' payroll.
 Sports stadiums and theatres have been built, too.
 Writers and artists are invited regularly to give
 lectures; and exhibitions are often held of the workers'
 artistic or literary creations.  The workers' cultural
 and art teams also give performances in the country-
 side and help the peasants organize their own
 cultural and art groups.  The trade unions have set
 up classes training dance, singing and sports in-
 structors.  Recently, the railway workers' trade union
 mobilized one hundred of their trained members to
 instruct the people in field and track events, as well as
 other sports.
 The working people of Indonesia also have the

 right to enjoy cultural and recreational activities, but
 without political and economic guarantees this is
 hardly possible.  In order to meet the cultural de-
 mands of the Indonesian working people, our slogan
 today remains:    Rally around the united front of the
 workers and the national united front to struggle for
 improved living standards, complete national in-
 dependence, democracy and lasting peace.

 EDUCATION IN NEW CHINA
 Sudjono
 President of the Indonesian Teachers' Trade Union
 delegation have already spoken of their experiences,
 conclusions and. hopes in the various fields in which
 they specialize.  As a teacher, I would like to say a
 few words about what I have seen in the field of
 education.
 I cannot describe in detail everything that I have
 seen, and the material that I have collected is by no
 means exhaustive.  This does not mean, however,
 that I cannot draw any conclusions.  While on tour,
 I have had the opportunity of discussing problems
 with educationists, trade unionists, teachers and

 Seventh All-China Con-

 that was held recently in
 Peking and was given a
 chance to visit the key
 cities of China. Although
 our tour has not yet come
 to an end, I am, sure it is
 going to be a great suc-
 cess.
 Some comrades of our

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 students.  The following is a summary of my impres-
 sions.
 First, I have been deeply impressed by the fact
 that every school pays great attention to the well-
 known and advanced educational principle, that is,
 to the principle that there should be no discrepancy
 between words and deeds.  In the education of chil-
 dren, theory is stressed in the same manner  as
 practice. It is true that to put this method into effect,
 there is need not only of teachers but also of sufficient
 experimental apparatus, and this sometimes causes
 difficulties.  Nevertheless, this method is extremely
 beneficial to the mental and physical development of
 children.  What the schools train for the society are
 not students who are acquainted only with theory but
 not practice; they are turning out cadres who are pre-
 pared to engage in economic construction.
 Secondly, the system of People's Democracy is
 widely applied in the field of education and this is
 borne out by the establishment of short-term second-
 ary schools for workers and peasants. These schools
 are like ordinary secondary schools except that the
 course is very short, ranging from six months to one
 year.  They do not admit ordinary students.  They
 are for the talented youth of worker and peasant
 origin who have contributed to the development of
 the society by their work.  I visited such a school in
 Shenyang (Mukden) where I met a student named
 Tien Kuei-ying, a woman locomotive driver and a na-
 tionally famous model worker.
 Thirdly, I have noticed that the teachers and stu-
 dents of the schools I have visited are very happy.

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 They study seriously and get on well with each other.
 They do not show the least sign of embarrassment
 when they meet new people.  I think that all who
 have visited the schools have had the same experi-
 ence.
 Fourthly, New China pays great attention to
 technical  schools.  Technical schools  of different
 kinds (including agricultural technical schools) are
 set up everywhere to meet the needs of the large-scale
 industrialization of the country.
 Fifthly, nurseries contribute much to the mental
 and physical health of children and make it possible
 for mothers to engage in productive work.  From a
 very early age, the children are trained to adapt
 themselves to collective life.  It should be pointed
 out that this is all to the good, for parents who are
 apt to spoil their children at home have fewer oppor-
 tunities of doing so.
 Lastly, as an official of a teachers' trade union
 I should not forget to mention the prospects and liv-
 ing conditions of the teachers in China.  I have seen
 with my own eyes that their life has improved sub-
 stantially since the liberation.  They are paid several
 times more than they were in the Kuomintang days
 and, moreover, they enjoy the benefits of social
 amenities (living quarters with water and light, free
 medical service and sanatoria).  No wonder that
 under such circumstances they work whole-heartedly
 and happily.  In addition, they attend lectures on
 various special subjects and have access to all neces-
 sary reference books so that they have a good chance

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 to increase their general knowledge as well as their
 professional knowledge.
 These are the impressions I have obtained dur-
 ing my short stay in China.  It is quite clear that
 New China's Government and society lay great
 emphasis on education.  They do so because they
 believe that education is an essential condition for
 national construction.  The Government appropriates
 a large sum from the budget for the development of
 education.  This is only possible when state power is
 in the hands of the people.  What I have seen is, in
 fact, only the beginning of their plan.  I believe
 their educational work will expand along with the
 development of national construction.

 the Chinese people but also to all peoples in colonial,
 semi-colonial and capitalist countries who are fight-
 ing for national liberation, democracy and peace.
 It is an event which has given great hopes and
 confidence to all freedom-loving peoples all over the
 world.  At this historic congress we were able to ob-
 serve the great unity of the Chinese working class,
 their political maturity, their iron discipline and their
 overwhelming enthusiasm to overfulfil the national
 construction programme to lay the foundation to
 make New China a mighty industrial power.
 During the six weeks of our stay we have visited
 many cities and villages.  When we visited Shang-
 hai we were able to see many machine-tool factories
 for the manufacture of machinery for heavy as well
 as light industries.  We saw many such factories in
 Mukden and Nanking too.    This vast production of
 machinery and tools is for the purpose of starting
 heavy and light industries throughout the country
 to increase the wealth and prosperity of the country,
 for the Chinese people to have a richer and happier
 life.
 We were also able to notice in many cities and
 villages, how the Central People's Government is
 taking great concern in providing living quarters for
 the people.  Large building construction schemes are
 in progress in every city and throughout the villages
 to provide decent houses for the people.
 Workers who lived in shanties, hovels and mud
 huts before the liberation are living in well-ventilated,
 well-furnished modern houses with electricity and
 drainage.  We saw tens of thousands of such houses

 Approved For Release 2007/09/10: CIA-RDP83-00418R007700130004-8
 in Shanghai, Mukden, Nanking; Tientsin and many
 other cities.
 Workers are also provided with decent rest
 homes and sanatoria to spend their annual holidays
 and periods of convalescence after illness.  These
 rest homes and sanatoria which we visited are pro-
 vided with all modern conveniences and comforts.
 Facilities have been provided for indoor and outdoor
 games.  Reading rooms, libraries and theatres are
 provided for cultural activities.
 All facilities are provided to look after the wel-
 fare of mothers and children.  Nurseries have been
 established in factories, in different parts of cities
 and villages to nurse the children when mothers are
 at work.  These children are given vitamin-rich food
 and they are given toys to play. Trained nurses look
 after these children and teach them to sing and dance.
 During our travels we observed that the Central
 People's Government is paying very great attention
 to child-welfare and also to the welfare of women
 workers.
 Women workers get equal pay with men and
 during the period of confinement and after childbirth
 special attention is paid to their health.  They get
 56 days' leave with full pay during confinement and
 sometimes this period is extended.
 In the villages the conditions of the peasants
 have improved very considerably after land reform.
 I visited many villages and we were able to observe
 the great love the peasants have for Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung and the Chinese Communist Party for
 liberating them from the yoke of the landlords and

 the reactionary Kuomintang rulers.  They are work-
 ing with very great enthusiasm to increase produc-
 tion.  The peasants not only have enough food to
 eat, they have reserve stocks in their barns.
 We noticed that the conditions of the Chinese
 peasants are much better than the middle peasants
 in our country who are fast getting indebted and
 pauperized.
 Health and sanitation is another factor that
 strikes any visitor to New China.  The patriotic
 health movement launched at the call of Chairman
 Mao Tse-tung has produced marvellous results.  The
 first city that we visited in the course of our tour in
 New China was Canton.  Canton was one of the
 most insanitary cities in China before the liberation.
 But we saw a different picture when we visited this
 city.  The streets in this city were perfectly clean.
 We noticed common people and even children observ-
 ing cleanliness in every detail.  During the three
 days and three nights we stayed in Canton we did
 not see a single fly, mosquito or any other insect
 injurious to public health.
 In Canton we saw the new People's Hospital
 with all the modern conveniences and comforts pro-
 vided for indoor patients.  This was only one of the
 many hospitals in Canton.  The hospital had 1,200
 beds and it was provided with all modern equipment
 and appliances.  The number of doctors, nurses and
 attendants in that hospital was amazing.  A hospital
 of that size in our country does not have even one
 third of that staff.

 who laugh, sing and play most joyously.  They ex-
 tend their genuine friendship so happily, as they clap
 their hands, and seek to hold ours, or insist that we
 join in one of their games that, very often, try as
 we may to resist, we are compelled to respond to such
 friendship with tears of joy.
 We talked to the school children at Peking, where
 1,700 happy children looked up to us and cried, "We
 want peace," "Long live peace," while we thought
 of rich warmongers in our country, who talk of using
 atom bombs which would murder millions of children.
 After seeing the many thousands of happy, healthy
 children, the need for action in their defence becomes
 a most pressing need.

 of the minds of our children and youth by American

 would increase our activity a hundredfold, could we,
 as in China, see, hear or play with children whose
 minds are completely free from that or any other
 poison.
 One of the most amazing actions of the people
 of China is the manner in which they quickly defend-
 ed themselves against the use, by America, of
 bacteriological warfare.  The People's Government
 organized a nation-wide campaign in action to rid
 China of the fly menace by regarding every fly as an
 imperialist enemy agent, which had to be destroyed.

 The result is that in the thousands of miles of travel
 in China we have not seen one fly.
 Another aspect of life in China which makes a
 deep impression is the large amount of building in
 course of construction or recently completed.
 In one year alone, 1952, the People's Govern-
 ment of China provided 41.6 million pounds for hous
 ing construction, and, in that year alone housed one
 million people.
 Urgent building construction is proceeding in an
 amazing fashion in China.  Yet, because of their love
 of their country, its history and culture, large sums
 of money, much labour and materials are used to
 restore and repair palaces of culture, museums and
 historical buildings.
 Many economic demands for which we in Aus-
 tralia are still compelled to struggle, are already
 enjoyed by the trade unionists of China.  For ex-
 ample, equal pay for the sexes operates in China.
 Prices of commodities are stabilized, while wages
 have on the average doubled since 1949 and are still
 increasing.
 Recognition of union representatives is an issue
 about which many a long industrial battle has been
 fought in Australia.  The Trade Union Law of China
 prevents the transfer or discharge of any union rep-
 resentatives and, in fact, of any worker until or
 unless the relevant trade union approval has been
 secured.
 The same law provides that state or private
 enterprises, employing 200 to 300 employees, must
 employ, at full wages, one full-time trade union of-

 ficial and a further official for each additional 500
 employees!
 This is explained by the fact that the working
 class is the leading class in China and not the ex-
 ploited or oppressed class as in Australia.
 It creates a deep impression to recall the head-
 lines, billboards, front and other pages of newspapers
 in our Australia which predominantly deal with
 murder, incitement to war, or disgraceful and fan-
 tastic lies and slander against other nations, and
 compare the Australian position with that in China.
 The newspapers and posters in China, we find,
 tell of the accomplishments of the Chinese people in
 production, in the arts, the sciences or literature, and
 they tell of the rights of the people.
 There are thousands of posters in China calling
 for world peace.  In each village, at each school,
 factory or job which we visited, the peasants, workers
 and their children cried in voices full of sincerity,
 "Long live peace."
 The majority of the people wear emblems of some
 kind which bring to mind the call for Peace.
 The May Day procession in Peking which con-
 sisted of 500,000 people-and this was because of a
 decision to limit the participants to that number-
 made the call for peace and peaceful construction of
 their country the main theme.
 There are not any words to describe a procession
 of 500,000 people, marching 70 abreast like a human
 tidal wave, with every marcher carrying something,
 flags, beautiful silk flags, flowers, balloons, doves of
 peace, ribbons, streamers, or posters.

 Words such as "stupendous," "super colossal,"
 "marvellous" fail, by far, to describe the procession,
 but the inadequacy of our language is greater, when
 one is attempting to describe the enthusiasm of the
 people.
 The workers and peasants in the May Day pro-
 cession not only marched but almost jumped out of
 their skins with joy and enthusiasm, as they jumped,
 cheered, clapped and sang or shouted, "Long live
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung," "Long live peace" so
 loudly that, very often, the brass band with its 500
 performers could not be heard.
 One group released hundreds of doves, another
 hundreds of toy aeroplanes into the sky, while at the
 same time rockets were releasing beautiful, red, silk
 flags of China, anchored to parachutes, to sail away
 fluttering in the breeze.
 The colour, joy and enthusiasm of the people, or
 the grandeur of the spectacle, is indescribable.  While
 500,000 marched on May Day in Peking, and half a
 million sang, danced and shouted with joy in the
 evening, the people in every other part of China car-
 ried out similar celebrations.  For example, 600,000
 marched in the May Day procession in Shanghai.
 May Day, in spirit and enthusiasm, was an ex-
 pression of the people of China at work and at play.
 We have been inspired to do all in our power, to
 help promote full recognition of China, help promote
 peaceful relations and trade between Australia and
 China and, in this way, assist towards securing
 world peace.

 HAT I SAW IN NEW CHINA
 James H. Young
 President of the Sydney Branch of the Waterside
 Workers' Union of Australia
 Since our arrival  in
 Peking, trade union rep-
 resentatives from Hung-
 ary, Rumania, Bulgaria,
 East Germany, Thailand,
 Burma,  Indonesia   and
 Viet-Nam and others are
 quartered  at  the same

 friendliness, and peaceful
 relations with the peo-
 ples                                                              of  other      nations,
 irrespective of race, creed
 or colour must have a profound impression on a visi-
 tor to China.  This must prompt the question, "Is this
 show of peace and friendship only on the surface?"
 Allow me to answer in the most factual way that I
 know.
 China has become in its three years of liberation
 a nation able to supply food, sufficient for its own
 population, and also a surplus for export.  This pro-
 ductivity of food has been obtained through the
 system of land reform, whereby the peasants have
 been given areas of land in proportion to the size of
 their families.

 When one travels only from Canton to Peking,
 a distance of 2,000 miles over land rich and fertile,
 one realizes that the whole of the Asian world has a
 "Bread Basket" in China.
 We Australians visited farming villages, and
 saw land which had never before been cultivated be-
 cause the individual landowners had no interest in
 the national economy.  This land was delivering now
 two crops of rice a year.
 In Australia we know, from our own observa-
 tions, how hard the Chinese work in the vegetable
 gardens surrounding the cities.  Imagine millions of
 Chinese peasants, who previously worked as farm
 labourers on rented land, earning enough to provide
 food for six months of the year on a level of poverty,
 where it was common for parents to give children
 away rather than see them starve, to suddenly have
 a government that introduced land reform, which
 gave poor peasants land, and supplied farm imple-
 ments and seed.  The result is that the peasants are
 showing their appreciation by producing more food
 than ever before. In one village production had in-
 creased by 230 per cent over the past three years
 mainly through land reform.  The peasants had im-
 proved their homes, and had three times more cloth-
 ing than before liberation.  Primary schooling had
 been extended for 250 students, whereas three years
 ago there were only 30, they being the children of
 the wealthy.  Previously 90 per cent of the peasants
 were illiterate, but now adult education at day and
 night schools is provided.  A government who helps
 the peasants in these matters naturally is popular.

 On the industrial side, China has commenced a
 five-year plan to industrialize the whole nation.  Coal
 mines and large iron and steel works are already
 producing.
 To supply the technical skill, universities such
 as the one we visited near Peking, are training many
 thousands  of  civil,  electrical,  mechanical     and
 hydraulic engineers, on a scale never attempted
 before.  Side by side with this work is the building
 programme of new homes, schools and hospitals, and
 I might say that the total number of beds available
 has more than doubled in three years.  All this makes
 China a hive of industry.
 What part have the women of China played in
 this revolutionary change?  This question is one in
 which all Australian women, whose heartfelt sym-
 pathy has always been expressed towards the women
 of China, would be interested.
 No words of mine could ever describe the noble
 and courageous role they have played in the making
 of New China.  No more is it humiliating nor is it
 a tragedy to be born a girl.  Gone is the inherent
 knowledge that, as mere children, they could be sold
 into marriage or slavery like mere chattels by whose
 sale a whole family could avoid starvation for a part
 of a year.
 The People's Government has abolished this by:
 1. Banning polygamy, 2. Revising the Marriage Law,
 giving women equal legal rights with the male, 3.
 Equal pay for both sexes.
 This reform has made the Chinese women the
 most happy and dignified humans in Asia, and for

 that matter the whole world.  One admires the pride
 and dignity in their marriage, their creative genius
 as leaders in industry, and their intense love of their
 country.  Both young and old have at last found
 their freedom, and believe me, accepting it, in that
 humble, sincere manner, which is characteristic of
 the Chinese people.  One could say that People's
 China is women's China.
 These changes are the direct result of the Peo-
 ple's Government being determined to break the
 shackles that for so long bound women to a life of
 slavery.
 Never have I seen such love for a leader as that
 extended to Chairman Mao Tse-tung, the head of the
 People's Government, who every Chinese is con-
 vinced is responsible for the better life they now
 enjoy.  One can never forget the demonstration of
 love and affection bestowed on this man at the May
 Day Celebrations in Peking.
 A half-million of people marching 70 abreast,
 each carrying either a silken flag, flowers, or stream-
 ers, making a most colourful scene.  As they march-
 ed, they shouted as one, "Long live People's China,"
 "Long live Chairman Mao."  He stood on the ve-
 randah of Tien An Men, the Gate of Heavenly Peace,
 with a  number of his ministers.  No armed guard,
 no bullet proof windows, or slinking security police
 to protect him, and waved his hand in salute to his
 people, who jumped with joy when he waved to each
 group.  For three hours they marched, and at its
 conclusion a huge wall of people who were onlookers
 packed the square, cheering wildly as Chairman Mao

 acknowledged their affections.  It was an unforget-
 table sight, for we Australians had always believed
 that the Chinese were not demonstrative.
 I feel that China extends to Australia and other
 nations the hand of peace, friendship and trade and
 that we in Australia should accept this offer.  We
 have as our nearest neighbours 1,200,000,000 Asian
 people, who really desire peace and the ending of
 exploitation by other nations.
 Australian trade with China amounted to many
 millions of pounds prior to the war, when the pur-
 chasing power of its, people was miserably low.
 With the rising level of the Chinese standard of liv-
 ing enormous opportunities for the export of Aus-
 tralian primary and secondary products exist.
 The cry of the Asian people is for peace, and the
 right to live a decent life in security and comfort.
 In my opinion, this will not be denied to them, for
 China will never again be an insulted nation.

 penetracion comunista, puesto que en la mayoria de los paf-

 expresan sus necesidades :materiales en terminos de aspira-

 La F. S . M . tampoco pace ningun secreto de su papel
 esencial de dirigir a los Sindicatos en apoyar el "programa"
 de los movimientos inspirados por los comunistas, de "inde-
 pendencia nacional" y favorece, por ende, las alianzas que
 puedan explotarse para llevar a. los comunistas al poder.
 Asi, di Vittorio, Presidente del Congreso Sindical Mundial de
 Viena en 1953, dijo:
 "...Las tareas de In clase trabajadora y de los Sin-
 dicatos :obreros en los paises capitalistas se amplfan y
 nuevas oportunidades de alianza con vastos sectores
 de la.poblacion se abren ante ellos ....  Hablando en
 sentido general, ningun renacimiento economico y so-
 cial es posible en los paises coloniales y semi-colonia-

 ci6n de tales reformas radicales, tan vitales para los
 pueblos coloniales, ester condicionada por su liberaci6n
 nacional y el fin de toda dorm naci6n imperialists y
 colonial"... Por esta razon, los sindicatos obreros en los
 paises coloniales deben siempre -empleando las for-
 mas y metodos mss adecuados a su particular situa-
 cion- vincular la luchc por sus demandas econ6mi-
 cas y sociales con la lucha por In independencia na-

 sujetos a los controles econ6micos y politicos del im-
 perialismo norteamericano, la lucha por la indepen-
 dencies nacional constituye una base objetiva para
 una vasta alianza de diferentes sectores de la pobla-
 cion en torno de la clase trabajadora.

 trolados por comunistas, sino que ademas . maniobra por
 medio de organizaciones y movimientos propagandisticos,
 los mas conocidos de los cuales son el "Movimiento Pro

 (F . I . D . M . ), la Federacion Mundial de Juventudes Democrc - .

 (M. I . E .) y la Asociacion Internacional de Abogados Demo-
 crdticos (A.1. A . D .) . Algunos dirigentes de la F. S . M . son
 iambien dirigentes de estas otras organizaciones, y las acti-
 vidades propagandisticas de todos forman un diseno cohe-
 rente y caracteristico. Dentro de los poises del bloque sovietico, las orga-
 nizaciones "de fachada" y sus afiliados forman parte del me-
 canismo del Gobierno y del Partido. En este papel ayudan
 a la sistemc tica supresion de la libertad individual y han

 En los poises fuera del bloque Sovietico los Sindica-

 peciales para ellas como esposas y madres y ostensible-
 mente abogando por sus derechos- al "Movimiento Pro
 Paz" (19), y utilizarlo como campo donde reclutar comunis-

 El quinto punto del programa de Stalin para lograr
 un asidero en las regiones poco desarrolladas es el de
 "asegurar la vinculacion del movimiento de liberacion na-
 cional con el movimiento proletario (es decir, Comunista)
 de los poises adelantados".
 Las actividades de los Comunistas locales y de las
 "crganizaciones de fachada" controladas por comunistas en
 este aspecto, se han indicado ya.  Sin embargo, hay otras
 dos fuentes posibles de ayuda directa para un movimiento
 do "independencies nacional": Los gobiernos Comunistas (el
 Gobierno Sovietico, el Gobierno Chino y los Gobiernos Sa-
 telites bajo su control) y las fuerzas simpatizantes en el mun-
 do Libre.
 La ayuda que los gobiernos Comunistas pueden pres-
 tar depende de su fuerza militar e influencia politico en el
 pals en cuestion. Cuando el movimiento de independencia
 nacional ocurre en un territorio adyacente, no vacilan en
 darle ayuda militar directa en su intento de aduenarse del
 poder por la fuerza, como en Grecia, Corea e Indo-China.
 Cuando una intervencion, ayudan con la accion diplom&ti-

 ca y con la adecuada manipulacion de su politica econo-
 mica y hasta cultural. De este modo, los convenios comer-
 ciales, las ofertas de asistencia tecnica y comercial, las visi-
 tas de "buena voluntad", los intercambios  culturales,  los
 campeonatos deportivos internacionales, etc., se emplean
 para ayudar a los movimieritos de "independencia" nacio-
 nal, debilitando a las fuerzas que les ofrecen resistencia.
 Quiza de mayor importancia, sin embargo, es la ayu-
 da que pueden sacar los Comunistas que trabajan bajo la
 mascara de un mmovimiento de "independencia nacional", de
 ciertas fuerzas y corrientes de opinion del mundo libre. La
 principal entre estas, tal vez, la proporciona el tema del "an-
 ti-imperialismo": la idea de que la politica de las Potencies
 Europeas Occidentales y los Estados Unidos hacia los poi-
 ses poco desarrollados este determinada por un deseo de
 controlarlos y explotarlos, y que la accion hostil a las Po-
 tencias Occidentales y a los Estados Unidos debe ser, por
 lo tanto, ventajosa para los pulses poco desarrollados.  Es-
 ta conviccion ester a menudo acompanada de una ingenua
 falta de informacion sobre la naturaleza del imperialismo
 comunista ruso y chino.
 Tambien hay el "anti-colonialismo": la creencia de
 que la existencia de territorios dependientes es moralmen-
 te injusta, y la consecuente tendencia a suponer que cual-
 quier movimiento que incluya entre su miras el independen-
 tizarse de la Potencia Colonial de que se trate, necesaria-
 mente merece apoyo. Hay el "anti-imperialismo" y el rece-
 lo hacia la politica de los Estados Unidos. Hay la gran fuer-
 z.x del trabajo internacional ozganizado, vigilante pare pro-
 teger la libertad de asociacion y los derechos de los obre-
 ros e instintivamenfe simpatizante con cualquier movimien-
 to que parezca o pretenda favorecer sus intereses. Hay el

 Las conclusiones de este estudio pueden resumirse
 Como sigue:
 1) Los pafses y erritorios poco desarrollados se estan
 convirtiendo en un objetivo coda vez mess importante pares
 la actividad y penetracion Comunistas.
 2)  El metodo preferido por los Comunistas es la ex-
 plotacion del nacionalismo.
 3)  La actividad y la penetracion Comunista se rea-
 lizar&n, por lo tanto, siempre que sea posible, bajo la mas-
 cara de un movimiento de "liberacion nacional" o de "in-
 dependencia nacional". En los Estados soberanos tomard
 la forma de ataques contra las alianzas extranjeras y con-
 tra el gobierno  existente  come no representativo, anti-
 democratico y titere de los intereses extranjeros. En los te-
 rritories no-autonomos adoptara la forma de un movimien-
 to pare la autonomia complete o bien la Cesion.
 4)  Los comunistas intentaran formar una coalicion
 de "independencia nacional" con cuantos partidos politicos
 sea posible, sobre la base de un manifiesto con amplios in-
 centivos que atraigan al pueblo.

 5)  En el ,clano popular se intentard asegurar el apo-
 yo de las masas al manif:iesto y a in coalicion por medio de
 organizaciones cle "masas" y especialmente, mediante los
 sindicatos obrercs.
 6)  A este fin se realizara un esfuerzo especial para
 cpoderarse de in direcc:ion de los movimientos sindicales
 existentes y parcx establecer nuevos Sindicatos obreros ba-
 jo el control de la F. S. M. y se procurara un aumento in-
 cesante de confErencias, visitas, viajes, "intercambios cultu-
 rales" y publicidud dirigida bajo los auspicios de la F. S. M.
 7)  Se har6n intentos para fomentar el descontento
 social y la intranquilidad obrera, especialmente por medio
 de huelgas y deinandas de elevacion de salarios.
 8)  AT miEmo tiempo, se hardn preparativos para el
 caso de fragmentacion eventual de in coalicion de "inde-
 pendencia nacional" y para in ocupacion Comunista del Po-
 der mediante la infiltraciin de los servicios slave (gobierno
 central y local, :coder judicial, escuelas, policia) y la colo-
 cacion de Comunistas en los puestos de mando dentro de
 In misma coalicion de "independencia nacional".
 9)  Los  gobiernos  comunistas  procurardn  prestar
 ayuda directa e indirecta a los comunistas que trabajen en-
 cubiertos por in mascara de movimientos de, "independencia
 nacional", extendiendo y explotando su influencia politico,
 militar, economica y cultural en el mundo libre.
