 reform program, but we believe major obstacles remain that threaten its
 realization and that will force Hu to compromise with his opponents. We
 expect that:
 ? Beijing will meet stiff resistance in attempting to reform the lower
 administrative reaches of the party and government and may be forced to
 soften its reformist initiatives.
 ? Hu will continue to face opposition from senior military traditionalists
 who pose the most serious challenge to his succession, despite efforts to
 curry favor by moving closer to them on some issues.
 ? Beijing will continue to grope for solutions to its economic problems, and
 will have difficulty in meshing a party purge and development goals so
 that economic performance does not suffer.
 ? Ideological exhortation will fail to reverse the loss of faith in the party,
 and the reformists will resort to more authoritarian methods to stifle
 criticism and preserve their rule.
 Gains made by Deng Xiaoping at the 12th Party Congress include:
 ? Placing nine supporters on the Politburo and removing former party
 Chairman Hua Guofeng.
 ? Replacing over half of the Central Committee with members who
 support his policies.
 ? Winning official endorsement of a party purge that will last three years
 and will target members who question his policies.
 Deng failed, however, to remove prominent critics of both his program and
 his succession arrangements from the Politburo Standing Committee. In
 our judgment, Deng will now attempt to shift the focus of policymaking
 and power from the Politburo to the party Secretariat, headed by Hu.
 The Congress acted on the entire range of policy questions before the
 leadership:
 ? Military. A number of senior Army officials were relegated to advisory
 status at the Congress, presaging significant shifts in the regional
 military commands. Nonetheless, the influential old guard remains a
 generally conservative force on the political scene, skeptical of the reform
 program, and unconvinced of Hu Yaobang's ability to lead.

 generally conservative force on the political scene, skeptical of the reform
 program, and unconvinced of Hu Yaobang's ability to lead.
 ? Economy. The Congress endorsed the reformist program and indicated
 that, despite acknowledged problems, it will continue. Economic develop-
 ment was declared the number-one priority, but the Congress documents
 and available reporting suggest to us that the Chinese are still uncertain
 how to proceed. The goal of quadrupled national output by the century's
 end, a 7-percent gain each year, in our view, is attainable only in the un-
 likely event the Chinese can overhaul their managerial infrastructure.
 ? Ideology. We believe the Congress's generally conservative ideological
 tone and its concern about the public loss of confidence in the party
 foreshadow increasing emphasis on stricter ideological guidelines and on
 combating the spread of Western values in China.
 ? Foreign Policy. The Congress endorsed the more nationalistic foreign
 policy line of the last year. It declared an interest in broadening relations
 with the United States but stressed that the Taiwan Relations Act
 remains "a cloud" over the relationship. The Congress also indicated an
 interest in expanding low-level contacts with the Soviet Union, but
 declared that any significant improvement in relations depends upon
 Moscow taking "practical steps" to diminish its threat to China.

 China's 12th Party Congress:
 People, Policy, and Prospects
 The 12th Party Congress, which met in Beijing
 1-1 1 September 1982, did not allow Deng Xiaoping
 all the organizational changes he wanted, but we
 believe he made impressive gains that improve Gener-
 al Secretary Hu Yaobang's chances of staying in
 power after Deng dies. Appointments and removals of
 party leaders significantly strengthened Deng's and
 Hu's positions in the Politburo and Secretariat, as
 well as in the Central Committee.' The Congress
 officially endorsed their pragmatic domestic and for-
 eign policies, including a prospective purge of the
 party membership.
 Deng's gains
 Party reformers under Deng succeeded in removing a
 mixed bag of seven full and two alternate members of
 the Politburo, replacing them with nine leaders of
 demonstrated loyalty to Deng and the reform pro-
 gram. Four full and two alternate members of the
 Secretariat were named to vacancies created by the
 reshuffle. Three of these are longstanding associates
 of Hu and two are close to Deng.
 Dengist gains on the Central Committee were even
 more impressive. Of the 210 members, 53 percent are
 new or were promoted from alternate membership in
 the 1 1 th Central Committee. The percentage is higher
 for new alternates. Reflecting Deng's priorities, over
 two-thirds of the new members are under 60 years
 old, and 17 percent of the total membership are
 functional specialists, an eightfold increase. Signifi-
 cantly, the military share of full and alternate mem-
 bership in the Central Committee declined from
 roughly 30 percent to under 20 percent.
 Most important, Deng also obtained his party's en-
 dorsement of a major campaign to extend over three
 years, starting in late 1983, to bring about "overall
 ' See appendix A for a detailed breakdown of the new Central
 Committee. Appendix C is a list of appointments and dismissals.=

 rectification of party style and consolidation of party
 organizations." This nonviolent purge will investigate
 all party members expressly for adherence to the
 party's line since the third plenary session of the 11th
 Central Committee in 1978, at which Deng's policy
 orientation became dominant, a test we believe party
 conservatives and ideologues resisted. By calling in
 the party cards of 39.6 million members for examina-
 tion by the Discipline Inspection Commission, the
 reformers will begin the tortuous process of winnow-
 ing out opponents of reform and of Hu's succession to
 Deng.
 The Congress also dropped former party Chairman
 and Premier Hua Guofeng, a symbol of loyalty to
 Mao and of resistance to reform, from the Politburo

 Standing Committee to mere membership on the
 Central Committee. The titles of party chairman and
 vice chairman were eliminated, leaving Hu Yaobang
 at the top of the party structure as General Secretary,
 charged with running daily party affairs and conven-
 ing meetings of the Politburo
 Politburo Politics
 Although some Western observers have interpreted
 Deng"s failure to remove senior party elders and
 former Vice Chairmen Ye Jianying and Li Xiannian
 from the Politburo Standing Committee as a major
 setback for the reformers, we believe such a charac-
 terization is incorrect. The pattern of events and
 Deng's past behavior lead us to conclude that Deng
 realized some time before the preparatory meetings
 for the Congress, held in Beijing in early August, that
 he would have to change tactics in the face of the
 obstinate refusal of Ye, Li, and the other elders to
 retire.
 It is our judgment that Deng and the reform camp
 were forced to retain as members of the Politburo
 elderly officials who wished to remain and then opted
 to pack the body with elderly allies. Deng was unable
 to have a reduction in the role of the Politburo and its
 Standing Committee written formally into the new
 party constitution, but public statements by senior
 reformers indicate that the Deng camp intends to
 make the Politburo a "second-line" institution. Deng's
 group plans to shift the focus of policymaking and,
 therefore, power to the younger, more energetic Sec-
 retariat, headed by Hu and staffed by people close to
 him and Deng.l
 In our view, Deng essentially is gambling that Hu
 Yaobang's control of daily affairs through the Secre-
 tariat will be backstopped by trusted lieutenants' orr-
 the Politburo. He is also wagering that Ye and Li will
 be unable to exercise great influence from the Politbu-
 ro Standing Committee because of their obviously
 increasing infirmity. We believe the average age of
 the new Politburo, 72-six years above its predeces-
 sor--means that it will be a less active institution in
 any case
 The Leadership Mix
 Politburo. We believe it is a solid demonstration of
 Deng's strength in the party that he was able to name
 nine full and alternate members to the Politburo
 without acquiescing in the new appointment of a
 single known opposition figure. Old adversaries, how-
 ever, such as Politburo and Secretariat member Yu
 Quili, who takes exception to parts of current econom-
 ic policy, remain in top offices. Similarly, military
 officers who we suspect of resistance to Deng's efforts
 to professionalize and depoliticize the armed forces,
 such as Wei Guoqing and Zhang Tingfa, also retained
 their seats.
 The Politburo and its Standing Committee now con-
 tain an absolute majority of leaders who generally
 support reform policies, although differences within
 the reform camp on specific issues have emerged and
 will continue to complicate policymaking.Z The key
 gains for the reformers, viewed from the perspective
 of guaranteeing Hu Yaobang's succession to Deng,
 were the removal of Hua Guofeng and Politburo and
 Secretariat member Peng Chong from the leadership.
 Hua steadily lost power after 1978, when Deng
 succeeded in killing the personality cult then growing
 z On the Standing Committee the reform majority comprises Deng,
 Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, and Chen Yun. Unlike Hu and Zhao,
 Chen is not one of Deng's proteges. He is a veteran party leader and
 economic specialist holding high office in his own right. Since
 returning to power in 1978, he has generally supported the reform
 leadership, although tending to impose outer limits on the pace and
 scope of change. Deng has assiduously cultivated his support, and
 the two have frequently been paired in the media as China's most

 around Hua and began a slow rewriting of party
 history and ideology. Nonetheless, Hu and Deng
 could not afford to leave this symbol of loyalty to Mao
 and opposition to their program on the Politburo
 during the succession period. We believe Hua still
 commands some popular support in the provinces, and
 conceivably could have served as a rallying point for
 anti-Hu forces.
 The demotion of Peng Chong was an astute move that
 denies high office to one of the very few individuals
 young enough and sufficiently well connected to
 become a rival of Hu on his own. Peng was entrusted
 by Hua Guofeng with subduing Shanghai leftists
 when the Gang of Four was arrested in 1976, and
 after going to Beijing was responsible for the security
 apparatus
 The promotions of military men to the Politburo leave
 the overall proportion of representation by the armed
 forces roughly the same as before, but with a more
 reformist cast. Yang Shangkun, who is also Perma-
 nent Vice Chairman of the party Military Commis-
 sion and thus oversees its daily business, has had
 longstanding ties to Deng and was pilloried in the
 Cultural Revolution for his leadership of the party's
 sensitive General Office from 1945 to 1966. In a
 promotion we view as intended to help protect the
 physical security of Hu and the reformers when the
 succession to Deng takes place, Beijing Military
 Region Commander Qin Jiwei was made an alternate
 member of the Politburo. Qin served under Deng in
 the 1940s, was purged during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, and has moved ahead in step with Deng in recent
 years.
 Of those Politburo members dropped at the 12th
 Congess, one stands out as anomalous. Geng Biao,
 who was appointed Defense Minister under Deng's
 sponsorship against stiff military resistance in 1981,
 retired to the Central Advisory Commission without
 advance warning. We believe Deng may have been
 forced to trade Geng away in order to obtain the other
 military appointments he desired.

 secretary.' In our view, Hu is slowly building a
 personal power base in the Central Committee depart-
 ments, and the Congress saw new gains for him.
 Three officials with longstanding ties to Hu were
 elevated to the Secretariat, and three other appoint-
 ments went to officials with strong reform credentials.
 Hu's longtime protege, Hu Qili, already heads the
 party's General Office, guiding paperwork and ad-
 ministration. We expect he will assume new authority
 on the Secretariat in organizational and security
 affairs and will have a major role in the rectification
 campaign. Yang Yong's appointment to supervise
 military affairs brings a fully trusted lieutenant of
 Deng Xiaoping to the job. Deng chose Yang Yong as
 his deputy when Deng regained the position of Army
 Chief of Staff in 1977.
 Coping With Ye and Li
 We believe the retention of the Politburo Standing
 Committee and its composition pose some risks for
 Deng. The continued presence of Ye and Li will
 ensure them somewhat more direct access to the
 levers of power than if they had been relegated to the
 Advisory Commission. Thus, we believe they will be
 able to continue supporting their patronage networks

 Given these circumstances, we believe Deng may have
 judged that the political cost of forcibly retiring the
 two elders was too high. The parternalistic nature of
 Chinese politics, moreover, channels power into the
 hands of individuals, not institutions. Relocating Ye

 The new party constitution is written in a way that will prevent the
 death of Ye or Li from automatically forcing the leadership to
 replace either man. Only four positions in the party leadership must
 be filled by members of the Politburo Standing Committee, which
 now has six members. Deng, Hu Yaobang, and veteran Chen Yun
 hold all four titles: Chairman of the Advisory Commission (Deng);
 General Secretary, (Hu); First Secretary of the Discipline Inspec-
 tion Commission, (Chen); and Chairman of the Military Commis-
 sion, (Deng). Ye, Li, and Premier Zhao Ziyang do not hold such
 positions, thus their departure would not create a void on the
 Standing Committee that would require immediate party action to

 The Congress committed the party to a thorough

 Congress was vague about the mechanics of the
 campaign, other than to indicate that it will begin at
 the top and work its way down. In our view, the delay
 in starting is probably to establish and staff the
 organs that will be responsible. The purge is to be
 carried out gradually over three years and will involve
 a review of the dossiers of all members. Those found
 wanting will not have their party credentials revali-
 dated.
 Minister of Culture Zhu Muzhi, who was the press
 spokesman for the Congress, told correspondents that
 the number of those ultimately dismissed would not
 be large because all who are found deficient would be
 given an opportunity to repent and undergo reeduca-
 tion. We believe, however, Beijing would not have
 given itself a year to prepare for the rectification and
 another three years to conduct it to purge a small
 number of recalcitrants. In our view, the number to be
 purged is far greater than that suggested by Zhu-
 perhaps several million.

 Also on the agenda for next year is the extension of
 the restructuring of the central party and state organs
 to the provinces. The process has already begun in a
 few places where conditions are "especially ripe." The
 presence on the Central Advisory Commission of
 seven provincial first secretaries, three governors, four
 military commanders, and five regional political com-
 missars leads us to believe that preparations for a
 fairly extensive shakeup of local organizations are
 well advanced. Although it is as yet unclear whether
 officials-aside from Deng-will be permitted to sit
 on the advisory body and retain other party or state
 positions, we expect that, in line with Deng's plans, if
 those appointed to the Advisory Commission return to
 their old jobs, it will be to preside over the transition
 to successors. The installation of fresh leadership in
 the provinces presumably will spur further adminis-
 trative changes, first when new administrators seek to
 emplace their own teams and later, as initial person-
 nel moves take root, the network of trustworthy
 replacements expands in trickle-down fashion
 Army-Party Relations
 Deng was able to make some small inroads into the
 military's influence at the Congress, but we believe
 senior political operatives in the Army remain a major
 obstacle to the smooth transfer of power to Hu.
 Military representation on the Central Committee
 was significantly reduced, and most military members
 are now commanders and technocrats, not political
 commissars. A number of senior military officers also
 retired to the Central Advisory Commission, creating
 headroom for the younger officers needed to further
 Deng's plans to professionalize the military.
 The Soldier-Politicians. In our view, Deng is con-
 tending with the military on two levels. First, he is
 trying to limit and reduce the political influence of a
 group of largely elderly, respected military leaders,
 led by Ye Jianying, whose importance in the party
 rose during the 1960s. This group is unwilling to yield
 power and is particularly reluctant to accept the
 leadership of Hu Yaobang. The reformers have ad-
 vanced a variety of schemes to dilute the influence of
 the military as a whole in the party's internal affairs.

 In what we see as an important impediment to the
 reformers' ambitions, the new party constitution re-
 tains a major political role for the military commis-
 sion. We see this as perpetuating the Army's direct
 influence in the deliberations of the Politburo Stand-
 ing Committee, from which the commission chairman
 must be chosen. Although the Congress apparently
 failed to enhance Hu's personal influence on the
 commission, we believe that body is no political threat
 to Hu's standing as long as Deng is chairman.I
 Below the Top. In order to bring about changes in the
 armed forces that will make Hu's task easier, Deng
 and some reform-minded senior officers are pressing
 changes on the Army at a level below the top soldier-
 politicians. We estimate that Deng did comparatively
 well in this area at the Congress as well as in the
 months before it, when "leading organs" under the
 military commission were revamped. The sharp re-
 duction of military representation in the Central
 Committee illustrates this effort. Most members are
 professional soldiers, and political commissars hold
 less than a third of the military share of seats. On the
 Politburo, the three new military members have
 backed the reform program.
 The disproportionately large share of military retirees
 on the new Central Advisory Commission creates, we
 believe, additional opportunities for reformers. More
 than a third of the Commission consists of senior
 Army men whose withdrawal from active duty will
 give Deng the opportunity to promote more tractable
 officers. The retirement of six old-line administrators
 from the Army's leading staff schools may also
 facilitate modernization of training and tactics.
 Plans for the military Commission itself remain
 murky. In keeping with past practice, the membership
 of the Commission was not announced, and the
 publicly released list of its vice chairmen disclosed no
 new names. In his report, Hu indicated that the
 reformers plan to increase the government's role in
 daily management of the Army through its new
 Central Military Council. Nonetheless, after the Con-
 gress, reformist Politburo member Hu Qiaomu dis-
 closed that military Commission members will hold
 joint appointments on the government body. We
 Chen Yun, allied with Deng on
 most issues, sets economic poli-
 remain skeptical that the reformers can reduce the
 influence of the old guard in the military Commission
 on the management of the Army in the near term.
 The Economy
 The Congress strongly endorsed the controversial
 economic reform program begun at the Third Plenum
 in 1978, and while acknowledging abuses and prob-
 lems, stated that additional reforms are planned. Both
 Hu's report and the new party constitution hold that
 economic development is the party's principal task for
 the rest of the century. Hu reaffirmed that raising
 living standards will continue to be a top priority but
 noted that improvements will depend on increases in
 labor productivity, which we believe will be hard to
 come by
 Goals. In his report, Hu stated that China's "strategic
 objective" is to quadruple the national product by the
 year 2000, with special emphasis on resolving prob-
 lems in agriculture, energy and transport, and educa-
 tion and science. The remainder of the 1980s, he said,
 will be spent on reforming the economic management
 system, and growth will be moderate. Hu predicted
 that an "all-around upsurge" would follow in the
 1990s.
 Quadrupling the national product is not a new goal.
 Deng made reference to it in January 1980, and both
 Deng and Hu have discussed it with recent foreign
 Approved For Release 2007/02/21: CIA-RDP84S00554R000100170005-5
 Secret
 visitors including Australian Prime Minister Fraser.
 Chinese treatment of the goal and comments by
 senior economists at the Congress reflect a certain
 defensiveness, however, that leads us to conclude some
 Chinese officials believe the target is too ambitious.
 One leading economist rejected a comparison of the
 current goal with Great Leap Forward targets, and
 another insisted that the targets have been carefully
 worked out.
 We believe the target is very ambitious, and attain-
 able only in the unlikely event the Chinese are able to
 complete the radical overhaul of their economic man-
 agement structure scheduled for this decade. Quadru-
 pling output by the year 2000 requires an annual
 average growth of 7 percent, somewhat higher than
 the 6-percent annual growth rate of the past 30 years.
 Hu did not present a detailed plan for achieving this
 goal, but he did give the most explicit timetable we
 have seen since 1980, when the reform program was
 slowed to allow Beijing to deal with the dislocations
 caused by it. According to Hu, "the readjustment
 period," during which Beijing will focus on bringing
 down bloated investment rates, eradicating budget
 deficits and inflation, and redressing imbalances
 among production sectors, will last for the remainder
 of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85); it was original-
 ly scheduled to run three years, 1979-81. This sug-
 gests to us that the leadership is aiming for growth of
 perhaps 5 to 6 percent per year for the rest of the
 1980s and 8 to 10 percent thereafter. Hu expressed
 confidence that a master plan for reform can be
 designed prior to and implemented during the Seventh
 Five-Year Plan (1986-90)
 Reforms. Although the Congress strongly endorsed
 the goals of the economic reform program, it frankly
 acknowledged the abuses and dislocations that have
 accompanied it. Hu addressed specifically the thorny
 issues of decentralization of economic decisionmak-
 ing, the role of market forces, and China's economic
 relations with the outside world, all subjects of inter-
 nal debate.
 Hu indicated that Beijing will reduce the discretion-
 ary powers of local governments and enterprises to
 invest and allocate scarce inputs. We expect they will
 resist, further complicating Beijing's efforts to reas-
 sert central control over the economy. He also reiter-
 ated that the government intends to curtail "indis-
 criminate" payment of bonuses to workers and that
 procurement prices paid to peasants will be tightly
 controlled. We remain skeptical about the govern-
 ment's ability to do so, as similar efforts the past year
 In keeping with the general theme of reasserting more
 central control over the economy, the Congress
 stressed the paramount role of central planning and
 the "subsidiary" role of market forces. The Congress
 announced that a three-tiered planning structure will
 be implemented in China. According to Hu, most of
 the economy, including most capital and consumer
 goods, would continue to fall under the direction of       2
 the central "mandatory plan." A new "guidance
 plan" will cover goods whose production and distribu-
 tion by collective and private enterprises can be
 guided by "economic levers," such as pricing, fiscal,
 and monetary policies. Market forces, the last tier,
 will govern seasonal goods and small commodities
 produced and sold locally. The Congress did not
 elaborate on how these three plans will mesh, when
 the system will go into effect, or exactly which sectors
 of the economy will fall under each component. The
 apparent complexity of this system and China's lack
 of experience with what will be a fundamentally new
 management structure for the economy suggests to us
 that successful implementation will be a long time in
 coming.
 The Congress reaffirmed China's commitment to an
 open-door economic policy and a "vigorous expansion
 of foreign trade." Hu made this point a number of
 times in his address and turned aside criticism from
 those concerned about foreign influence in China. He
 acknowledged that contact with capitalists can lead to
 corruption and bourgeois values, but he insisted that
 the solution is not to abandon present policy.
 Ideology
 The Congress stressed a pragmatic approach to Chi-
 na's problems and a retreat from Maoist strictures,
 but also struck a more conservative, classically Lenin-
 ist, tone on ideological issues. Hu returned repeatedly

 Approved For Release 2007/02/21: CIA-RDP84S00554R000100170005-5
 in his address to a lack of popular confidence in
 Communism and, by extension, the leadership of the
 party-China's so-called crisis of confidence. In re-
 sponse he stressed a harder line, indicating that
 anyone who sullies socialism or the party-a reference
 to China's quarrelsome intellectual and artistic com-
 munity as well as to widespread antiparty sentiments
 among the young-can expect harsh treatment.
 The defensiveness of Hu's comments and an implicit
 reference to events in Poland underscore our judg-
 ment that the leadership as a whole-reformers and
 conservatives-believe they face a major problem in
 reviving popular respect for the party. In our view,
 there are differences within the party on how best to
 accomplish this rejuvenation. With the specter of
 Poland in the background, some take the view that a
 more open system, a responsive party, and other
 domestic reforms provide the best solution. Others see
 the need to crack down hard against all sources of
 potential disruption. The central party leadership has
 attempted to placate both groups, to the general
 satisfaction of neither.
 In the ideological realm, we believe the party will
 continue its movement toward more orthodox
 Marxism-Leninism. To shore up the party's image,
 propaganda extolling socialist values will attempt to
 persuade the Chinese of their superior system. More
 important, however, is the tightening up that is almost
 certain to accompany the propaganda campaign. We
 expect recent party and government decrees that
 discourage contact between private Chinese and for-
 eigners will be strictly enforced and perhaps supple-
 mented. The dangers of bourgeois values will remain
 a prominent topic, as will unfavorable characteriza-
 tions of life in the West. We expect to see prepara-
 tions for the coming rectification campaign stress
 orthodox themes that will reinforce this trend.I
 Foreign Policy
 Deng's opening speech to the Congress reflected
 extreme sensitivity toward issues involving Chinese
 sovereignty and independence, and we believe Deng
 struck an aggressive posture on this score in part to
 preempt critics of his handling of foreign affairs.
 Deng has repeatedly been forced by conservative
 Deng Xiaoping, architect of the
 Congress and its policies, re-
 mains the most powerful man

 elements in the leadership to defend his "open-door"
 policy publicly over the past year and to make
 adjustments giving his policy a more independent
 cast, less biased toward the West. The policy state-
 ment approved by the Congress endorsed this new line
 in terms free of doctrinaire ideology that focused
 instead on the concrete problems in China's relations
 with the United States, the Soviet Union, and other
 countries.
 The line adopted in Deng's speech and Hu's report did
 not depart significantly from that evolved over the
 past two years. With added emphasis on the Taiwan
 issue, Deng repeated in the same priority the goals for
 the decade first enunciated in 1980: "to intensify
 socialist modernization, to strive for reunification and
 particularly for the return of Taiwan to the mother-
 land, and to combat hegemonism and safeguard world
 peace."
 Relations With the United States, USSR. The de-
 tailed portions of Hu's report asserted China's interest
 in expanding relations with the United States, but
 indicated that relations will develop "only if" the
 United States adheres to the provisions of the US-
 China communique on arms sales to Taiwan. This
 recapitulates the line taken when the communique
 was announced in August. In a statement by the
 Foreign Ministry spokesman, and in a People's Daily
 editorial, the Chinese hold that the Taiwan Relations
 Act remains a "cloud" over the relationship that
 forces Beijing to monitor US arms sales closely.

 Secret
 Policy toward the USSR similarly followed lines
 evolved over the past year. Beijing enumerated the
 USSR's "grave threats to the peace of Asia and to
 China's security"-Soviet armed forces on China's
 borders, support for Vietnam, and the invasion of
 Afghanistan. Hu echoed the Foreign Ministry's earli-
 er response to General Secretary Brezhnev's call for
 improving relations in Tashkent last March by saying:
 "We note the Soviet leaders have expressed more than
 once the desire to improve relations with China. But
 deeds, rather than words, are important." Hu called
 for "practical steps to lift their threat" to China's
 security. The 1977 Congress document similarly
 called for deeds rather than words.
 The Congress, nonetheless, reaffirmed China's will-
 ingness to "safeguard and develop" friendship be-
 tween the Soviet and Chinese peoples. We believe this
 formulation provides justification for continuing and
 expanding low-level contacts with Moscow begun
 early this year. Beijing agreed to exploratory discus-
 sions with Moscow at the vice foreign minister level,
 thus resuming the contacts interrupted in early 1980
 after the invasion of Afghanistan. We believe the
 Chinese awaited the outcome of discussions with the
 United States over Taiwan before agreeing to meet
 with the Soviets. In our view, Deng may also have
 believed that timing his reply during the party Con-
 gress would offset criticism of his handling of the
 communique and foreign affairs generally.
 Fraternal Parties. Hu's report repeated the recent
 themes of China's ecumenical approach toward other
 Communist parties. The report stressed that each
 party operates under specific conditions and cannot
 give or accept directions from outside. This is meant
 in part to reassure Southeast Asia where several states
 remain nervous about Beijing's refusal to break ties
 with indigenous Communist parties and concerned
 about potential Chinese assistance to these insurgen-
 cies. It also tones down the strident language con-
 tained in the 1977 Congress document
 Hu said the Chinese party is willing to learn from
 "all" parties on a basis of equality and noninterfer-
 ence, probably a hint of interest in relations with the
 Soviet-dominated East Europeans who do not have
 party relations with Beijing. Beijing has long pursued,
 General Secretary Hu Yao-
 ban  Den 's chosen successor.
 I               :J
 to Moscow's annoyance, a "differentiated approach"
 to the Soviet and East European parties, refusing all
 dealings with the Soviet party while sounding out its
 satellites. Hu's report reinforced this distinction in an
 unmistakable reference to Moscow that reminded the
 Congress "our party has suffered from the attempt of
 a self-elevated paternal party to keep us under con-
 trol."
 Since proclaiming the reform agenda in speeches in
 1980, Deng and his allies have, we believe, made great
 progress in putting the past behind them by producing
 a party judgment on Mao Zedong and publicly trying
 the Gang of Four and Lin Biao's followers. This year's    2
 reorganization of the party, government, and Army
 bureaucracies marked a long stride toward rejuvena-
 tion of the upper stratum of China's officialdom.
 Their gains notwithstanding, we believe Deng and Hu
 have their work cut out for them in coming months.
 The Congress endorsed their policies and made some
 personnel shifts that will help, but major obstacles
 remain.
 Rectification
 The rectification campaign slated to begin next year
 will be Hu Yaobang's opportunity to clean house at
 the middle and lower levels of the party. These have
 remained largely untouched since the Cultural Revo-
 lution, and we believe they constitute a source of
 opposition to reform through foot dragging, inaction,
 and even outright resistance. The patronage networks

 that extend downward from Ye and Li to these levels
 would not have disappeared even if the two elderly
 leaders quietly retired, but we believe their obstinate
 refusal to do so will stiffen the resistance of their
 hangers-on.
 Even with the three years alloted by the reformers for
 the campaign, we expect the rectification will be a
 contentious, difficult process. Hu Yaobang may be
 forced to compromise on policy to pursue his enemies
 and promote his followers. We expect that Ye, Li, and
 the forces of conservatism they represent in the party
 will continue to keep pressure on Hu, inhibit reformist
 initiatives, and force a hard line on some social and
 political issues, including foreign policy.
 The Army
 Deng's efforts to professionalize and depoliticize the
 military are in the beginning stage and have produced
 only limited results so far. The resistance of soldier-
 politicians at the top has forced Deng to adopt
 circuitous means to reform the military. We believe
 this process will probably require more time than
 Deng has. As a result, we expect Hu Yaobang will
 still face suspicion in the military by the time Deng
 leaves the scene. Up to now, Hu has demonstrated a
 preference for accommodation over confrontation
 with powerful adversaries. He may well try to win
 support by moving toward the positions of conserva-
 tive Army leaders on policy questions, restoring and
 supplementing the Army bud et and ad'ustin the
 reform agenda for the Army.
 The Economy
 While it endorsed reform, the Congress did little to
 clarify specific economic policies, and we believe they
 will continue to be a major focus of discussion and
 dissension in the coming year. The lack of specifics
 about the development program and the delay of
 economic management reforms until after 1985 un-
 derline that three years of experimentation have left
 the Chinese still "groping" for solutions.
 We expect the National People's Congress (NPC)
 later this year to focus on this problem. At a mini-
 mum, it should provide further details on economic
 goals. A fuller version of the 1982 economic plan and
 a preview of the 1983 plan are likely, and the NPC
 apparently plans to finalize and adopt the Sixth Five-
 Year Plan. We doubt that full details of this plan will
 be made public. Nor do we expect to learn much more
 about economic management reform because the im-
 plementation of that initial program has been pushed
 back to at least 1986, the start of the Seventh Plan.
 Chinese leaders must also find a way to mesh econom-
 ic reform and the upcoming rectification program so
 that economic performance does not suffer as it has
 during past campaigns.
 The Crisis of Confidence
 We believe that restoring the party's image may be
 the most difficult issue to make progress on. The
 solution offered at the Congress-more ideological
 education and exhortation-is unlikely to produce
 significant results in our view. Other campaigns, such
 as the one against corruption, that are designed to
 restore popular confidence in the party, seem to have
 just the opposite effect and drive home its shortcom-
 ings.
 The clear trend we see in coping with this issue is
 toward stifling all real and potential criticism. Deng
 and Hu, who generally sympathize with intellectuals,
 have in the past favored some loosening of strictures.
 We believe they no longer can do so lest their
 opponents accuse them of fostering dissent.
 As practice in the Soviet Union has demonstrated,
 once such a crackdown begins, it is very difficult to
 ease the situation later. We believe this tendency,
 combined with Hu Yaobang's evident need to bargain
 with opponents in order to secure his position, will
 significantly reduce the pace and scope of reforms
 over the next several years. Senior reformers, includ-
 ing Deng and Hu, appear to appreciate the interrela-
 tionship between the failure to reform and the party's
 declining prestige. Nonetheless, we believe they have
 little choice but to act first to preserve their positions
 atop the leadership and only then to grapple with the
 ills of the society and economy.

 Highlights of Hu Yaobang's Report to the
 12th Party Congress, 1 September 1982 6
 Mao, Hua, and the        The "left" mistakes made before and during the Cultural Revolution had a deep
 Cultural Revolution      and extensive influence and caused serious damage... This unavoidably involved
 the mistakes made by Comrade Mao Zedong in his later years. Comrade Mao Ze-
 dong's contributions to the Chinese revolution were great and indelible; that is why
 over long years he enjoyed enormous prestige in the party and among the people
 and will continue to do so in the years to come... During the two years before the
 third plenary session of the 11th Central Committee, the question of rights and
 wrongs in the party's guiding ideology was not clarified as it should have been and
 the work of setting things to rights proceeded haltingly; this was because in the
 early days after the smashing of the Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique, our
 party was not ideologically prepared for an overall liquidation of the "left"
 mistakes and also because the principal leading comrade (that is, Hua Guofeng) in
 the Central Committee at the time continued to make "left" mistakes on a series
 of important issues.
 Class Struggle           It is wrong, in a socialist society where the system of exploitation has been
 abolished and the exploiting classes have been eliminated, to declare and act on the
 principle of "taking class struggle as the key link.". . . However, within certain
 limits, class struggle will continue to exist for a long time and may even sharpen
 under certain conditions. This is not only because pernicious influences left over by
 the exploitative systems and classes cannot be eradicated within a short time, but
 also because we have not yet achieved our goal of reunifying our motherland and
 other forces hostile to our socialist cause will seek to corrupt us and harm our
 country.
 The Crisis of Confidence The decade of domestic turmoil confounded the criteria of right and wrong, good
 in Communism             and evil, and beauty and ugliness. It is much more difficult to undo its grave spiri-
 tual consequences than its material ones. For this and other reasons, many serious
 problems concerning standards of social conduct now exist in our country. The
 Central Committee of the party is determined to effect a fundamental turn for the
 better in standards of social conduct in the next five years.
 The view that Communism is but a "dim illusion" and that it "has not been tested
 in practice" is utterly wrong. There is Communism everywhere in our daily life, of
 which it forms an inseparable part.
 All the splendid successes of the party and the people have been achieved precisely
 through the inspiring example given by such a fine core of members of the party.
 This is the principal aspect of our party, and whoever fails to see it, or deliberately
 denies it, is committing a grave error.

 (If we believe otherwise) we will not be able to safeguard the socialist orientation of
 China's modernization, and our socialist society will lose its ideals and objectives,
 its spiritual motivation and fighting will lose the ability to resist the inroad of cor-
 rupt influences and even develop distortedly and degenerate. Comrades, this is not
 just alarmist talk but a conclusion drawn from present realities at home and
 abroad (for example, Poland).
 The establishment of the socialist system makes it possible for us to build a high
 level of socialist spiritual civilization while striving for a high level of material
 civilization, just as the development of a modern economy to a certain level and the
 appearance of the most advanced class of our time, the working class, and its
 vanguard, the Communist Party, make it possible to succeed in socialist spiritual
 civilization which, in its turn, gives a tremendous impetus to the former and
 ensures its correct orientation. Each is the condition and objective of the other.
 The Economy              Of the various tasks for bringing about an all-round new situation, the most
 important one is to push forward the socialist modernization of China's economy
 ... The general objective of China's economic construction for the two decades
 between 1981 and the end of this century ... is to quadruple the gross annual val-
 ue of industrial and agricultural production-from 710 billion yuan in 1980 to
 2,800 billion yuan or so in 2000.
 In the period of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85) ... We must devote our main
 efforts to readjusting the economic structure in various fields, streamlining,
 reorganizing, and merging the existing enterprises and carrying out technical
 transformation in selected enterprises ... During the Seventh Five-Year Plan
 (1986-90), we shall carry out the technical transformation of enterprises on an
 extensive scale and gradually reform the system of economic administration, in
 addition to completing the rationalization of the organizational structure in
 various fields ... Therefore, it will not be possible for the national economy to de-
 velop very fast in this decade. But if we complete the above tasks, we can solve the
 problems left over from the past and build a relatively solid basis for economic
 growth in the decade to follow. The 1990s will witness an all-round upsurge in Chi-
 na's economy which will definitely grow at a much faster rate than in the 1980s
 ... In the five years between this party Congress and the next ... we must achieve
 significantly better economic results, a steady basic balance in finance and credit
 and basic stability in commodity prices.
 A basic principle guiding our economic work is "first, feed the people and second,
 build the country."
 In many fields, the economic results have been far from satisfactory, and there has
 been appalling waste in production, construction, and circulation ... Apart from
 some objective factors not subject to comparison, the main causes for this are the
 "left" mistakes of the past, which resulted in blind proliferation of enterprises, an
 irrational economic structure, defective systems of economic administration and
 distribution, chaotic operation and management, and backward production
 techniques.

 Secret
 Economic Reform          In the past few years, we have initiated a number of reforms in the economic sys-
 tem by extending the powers of enterprises in planning and by giving scope to the
 role of market regulation. This orientation is correct and its gains are apparent.
 However, as some reform measures have not been well coordinated with each other
 and the corresponding forms of administrative work have lagged behind, cases of
 weakening and hampering the state's unified planning have been on the increase.
 This is not good for the normal growth of the national economy. Hereafter, while
 continuing to give play to the role of market regulation, we must on no account
 neglect or relax unified leadership through state planning.
 The responsibility system for production set up in various forms in the countryside
 in recent years has further emancipated the productive forces and it must be
 adhered to for a long time to come. The thing for us to do is to gradually perfect it
 on the basis of summing up the practical experience of the masses. In no case must
 we make rash changes against the will of the masses, still less must we backtrack.
 Recently, the economic responsibility system has also been initiated in industrial
 and commercial enterprises with some good results. Although industry and
 commerce are vastly different from agriculture, the application for the economic
 responsibility system (including the system of responsibility for profit or loss in
 some of the state enterprises) similarly helps to implement the Marxist principle of
 material benefit, to heighten the workers' sense of responsibility as masters of the
 country and to promote production.
 Bonuses and Subsidies    We can no longer increase peasant incomes mainly through raising the prices of
 farm produce or through lowering the fixed quotas of state purchases and
 enlarging the scope of negotiated prices. The increase of the average incomes of
 the workers and staff must necessarily be less than that of labor productivity. We
 must put a stop to the indiscriminate handing out of bonuses and subsidies without
 regard to actual state of production and profit.
 Economic Principles      To bring about an all-round upsurge of China's socialist economy, we must
 continue to carry out in all our economic work the 10 principles for economic
 construction approved by the Fifth National People's Congress at its fourth
 session, paying special attention to solving the following major questions of
 principle. First, concentrating funds on key development projects and continuing to
 improve the people's living standards ... Second, upholding the leading position of
 the state economy and developing diverse economic forms ... Third, correctly
 implementing the principle of the leading role of the planned economy and the sup-
 plementary role of market regulation. Fourth, persevering in self-reliance while
 expanding economic and technological exchanges with foreign countries.
 Economic Planning and    Planning should take different forms in different circumstances. Plans of a
 the Role of the Market   mandatory nature must be enforced in regard to the production and distribution of
 capital goods and consumer goods in the state sector which are vital to the national
 economy and the people's livelihood, and especially in key enterprises vital to the

 Approved For Release 2007/02/21: CIA-RDP84S00554R000100170005-5
 whole economy ... In addition to plans of a mandatory nature, guidance plans,
 whose implementation is mainly ensured by means of economic levers, should be
 used in regard to many products and enterprises ... As for a number of small com-
 modities which are low in output value, great in variety produced, and supplied
 only seasonally and locally, it is neither necessary nor possible for the state to con-
 trol them all by planning. Enterprises may be allowed to arrange their production
 flexibly in accordance with the changes in market supply and demand ... We
 must correctly define the respective scope and limits of mandatory plans, guidance
 plans and market regulation and, on the premise that basic stability of commodity
 prices is maintained, gradually reform the pricing systems, and establish an
 economic administrative system suited to China's conditions so as to ensure the
 healthy growth of the national economy.
 Population Growth         Family planning is a basic policy of our state. We must do our utmost to keep our
 population within 1.2 billion by the end of this century.
 Reforming the Party       A grave problem at present is that in quite a number of organizations party
 discipline has slackened, right and wrong are confounded, rewards and punish-
 ments are misused and there is failure to criticize or punish when necessary. This
 is a problem of long standing, and no marked improvement has yet occurred in
 some places .... Local party committees and party commissions for discipline
 inspection at all levels have attained notable results in their major efforts to uphold
 party discipline and correct the style of the party. But they have met considerable,
 and in some cases, shocking, obstruction in their work.
 To solve correctly the question of party leadership over government organs and
 over enterprises and institutions is a highly important task in the organizational re-
 form. It is necessary to achieve a proper division of labor between the party and the
 government and between party work and administrative and production work in
 enterprises and institutions. The party is not an organ of power which issues orders
 to the people, nor is it an administrative or production organization. The party
 should, of course, exercise leadership over production, construction, and work in all
 other fields ... But party leadership is mainly political and ideological leadership
 in matters of principle and policy and in the selection, allocation, assessment, and
 supervision of cadres. It should not be equated with administrative work and the
 direction of production by government organizations and enterprises.
 The stipulation in the new party constitution that "the party must conduct its
 activities within the limits permitted by the constitution and the laws of the state"
 embodies a most important principle. It is impermissible for any party organiza-
 tion or member, from the Central Committee down to the grass roots, to act in
 contravention of the constitution and laws. The party is part of the people. It leads
 them in making the constitution and laws, which once adopted by the supreme or-
 gan of state power, must be strictly observed by the whole party.
 The new party constitution explicitly stipulates that the party "forbids all forms of
 personality cult."

 The practices of "what one person says goes" and of each going his own way are no
 longer allowed.
 During the organizational reform, we will relieve our many veteran cadres who are
 advanced in age of their heavy responsibilities in "frontline" posts and at the same
 time enable them to continue their service to the party, the state, and society by
 utilizing their rich experience in leadership work.
 In the future, in our use and promotion of cadres, we must attach importance to
 educational background and academic records as well as to experience and
 achievements in work.
 Party Rectification      The pernicious influences of the 10 years of domestic turmoil have not yet been
 eradicated, and there has been some increase in the corrosive inroads of exploiting-
 class ideologies under new conditions. It is true that impurities in ideology, style,
 and organization still exist within the party and that no fundamental turn for the
 better has been made in our party style. In the leadership work of some party orga-
 nizations, signs of flabbiness and lack of unity abound.
 To achieve a fundamental turn for the better in the style of our party, the Central
 Committee has decided on an overall rectification of party style and consolidation
 of party organizations, which will proceed by stages and by groups over a period of
 three years beginning from the latter half of 1983. This task will undoubtedly be of
 primary importance to the party.
 In matters of organization and leadership, the consolidation will start with the
 leading organs and cadres and then proceed, from top to bottom, with the leading
 bodies at different levels which have already been consolidated leading the
 consolidation of the subordinate and primary organizations. Bad elements must on
 no account be permitted to take this as an opportunity to frame and attack good
 people. We must act in, and develop further, the spirit of the Yan'an rectification
 movement of 1942, follow its principle of "learning from past mistakes to avoid fu-
 ture ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and its twofold objective of
 "clarity in ideology and unity among comrades" in unfolding earnest criticism and
 self-criticism, and take appropriate measures to solicit opinions from the masses
 outside the party. In the final stage, there will be a reregistration of all party mem-
 bers and, in strict accordance with the provisions of the new party constitution,
 those who still fail to meet the requirements for membership after education shall
 be expelled from the party or asked to withdraw from it. At the same time,
 concrete measures should be worked out to strengthen and improve party
 leadership so as to effect an improvement in the work of party organizations at all
 levels.
 As for persons who rose to prominence by "rebellion," who-are seriously
 factionalist in their ideas, who have indulged in beating, smashing, and looting,
 who oppose the line followed by the party's Central Committee since its third
 plenary session, or who have seriously violated the law and discipline, we must
 remove with a firm hand those among them who are still in leading posts. Persons

 who have violated criminal law must be investigated and dealt with according to
 law. Such people, of course, must never be put up as candidates for promotion to
 leading posts.
 Party Organization       According to the draft constitution, the Central Committee is to have no chairman
 but only a general secretary, who will convene meetings of the Political Bureau
 and its Standing Committee and preside over the work of the Secretariat. Advisory
 committees are to be established at the central and provincial levels to give our
 many veteran comrades rich in political experience a role as consultants in the
 service of the party's cause. Commissions for discipline inspection are to be elected
 by party congresses at the respective levels and, within limits prescribed by the
 party constitution, they are to supervise party committees and their members at
 the respective levels below the Central Committee, and they may report to the
 Central Committee any breach of party discipline by any of its members.
 Party Control of the      We must work hard to turn the People's Liberation Army into a regular, modern,
 Military                  and powerful revolutionary armed force and enhance its defense capabilities in
 modern warfare.... We must continue to strengthen the militia.... After the new
 draft constitution is discussed and adopted by the forthcoming National People's
 Congress, the Central Committee will continue to exercise leadership over our
 armed forces through the State Central Military Commission which is due to be
 set up. We must stick to the successful practices which the party has long followed
 in leading the armed forces.
 Intellectuals and Dissent In the past, owing to the influence of "left" ideas and the small-producer
 mentality, erroneous views such as underestimation of the importance of educa-
 tion, science, and culture and discrimination against intellectuals were rife in our
 party over a fairly long time.... We are determined to do everything possible to
 create favorable conditions in which the mass of intellectuals can work with ease of
 mind and in high spirits in the interest of the people. In this regard, there is still a
 good deal of painstaking ideological and organizational work to do.
 We must lay special stress on the role of the intellectuals, improve the work of
 ideological and political education among them to suit their special characteristics,
 and actively recruit into the party intellectuals who are qualified for membership.
 While exercising their freedom and rights, citizens must not impair the interests of
 the state, society, and the collective, or the freedom and rights of others. While we
 strive to develop socialist democracy, all our measures must help to consolidate the
 socialist system and promote social production and work in other fields. On no
 account will hostile, antisocialist elements be given any freedom to carry out
 sabotage.

 Secret
 Our struggle against grave criminal offenses in the economic sphere is now being
 intensified. Among those guilty of such crimes, apart from lawbreakers in society
 at large, are a tiny number of degenerates in party and government organizations
 and in the armed forces who have been corrupted by capitalist ideology.... Such
 destructive elements must be severely punished by law. We have won some initial
 successes in this struggle. The whole party must enhance its understanding of this
 struggle, take a firm stand in it, and unswervingly carry it through to the end. This
 will be an important guarantee for our adherence to the socialist road.
 The ideological, political, and organizational requirements (the) draft constitution
 sets for party members and cadres are stricter than those in all our previous
 constitutions. In stipulating the duties of party members, the draft absolutely
 forbids them to use public office for personal gain or to benefit themselves at the
 expense of the public interests, and requires that they firmly oppose factionalism
 and be bold in backing good people and good deeds and in opposing bad people and
 bad deeds.
 Opening to the Outside   It is our firm strategic principle to carry out the policy of opening to the outside
 World                    world and expand economic and technological exchanges with foreign countries in
 accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit.
 We must refrain from indiscriminate import of equipment, and particularly of
 consumer goods that can be manufactured and supplied at home.... In no
 circumstances must we forget that capitalist countries and enterprises will never
 change their capitalist nature simply because they have economic and technologi-
 cal exchanges with us. While pursuing the policy of opening to the outside, we
 must guard against, and firmly resist, the corrosion of capitalist ideas and we must
 combat any worship of things foreign or fawning on foreigners.
 On the one hand, we must persist in the policy of opening to the outside as well as
 in our policies for invigorating the economy domestically and, on the other, we
 must resolutely strike at the grave criminal activities in the economic, political,
 and cultural spheres that endanger socialism. It would be wrong to attend only to
 the latter aspect and be skeptical about the former, and it would be dangerous to
 stress the former aspect to the neglect of the latter. All party comrades must have
 a clear understanding of this principle without the slightest ambiguity.
 Independent Foreign      Being patriots, we do not tolerate any encroachment on China's national dignity or
 Policy                   interests.... Our adherence to an independent foreign policy accords with the
 discharging of our lofty international duty to safeguard world peace and promote
 human progress.... China never attaches itself to any big power or group of
 powers, and never yields to pressure from any big power.... The Chinese people
 will never again allow themselves to be humiliated as they were before, nor will
 they subject other nations to such humiliation.

 Relations With the     Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the United States of
 United States          America in 1978, relations between the two countries have developed in the
 interests of the two peoples.... However, a cloud has all along hung over the
 relations between the two countries. This is because the United States, despite
 having recognized that the Government of the People's Republic of China is
 China's sole legal government and that there is only one China and Taiwan is part
 of China, has passed the Taiwan Relations Act which contravenes the principles
 embodied in the joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations,
 and it has continued to sell arms to Taiwan, treating Taiwan as an independent po-
 litical entity.... Sino-US relations can continue to develop soundly only if the
 principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and noninter-
 ference in each other's internal affairs are truly adhered to.
 State Relations With the The relations between China and the Soviet Union were friendly over a fairly long
 Soviet Union           period. They have become what they are today because the Soviet Union has
 pursued a hegemonist policy. For the past 20 years, the Soviet Union has stationed
 massive armed forces along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders. It has
 supported Vietnam in the latter's invasion and occupation of Kampuchea, acts of
 expansion in Indochina and Southeast Asia, and constant provocations along
 China's border. Moreover, it has invaded and occupied Afghanistan, a neighbor of
 China, by force of arms. All these acts constitute grave threats to the peace of Asia
 and to China's security. We note that Soviet leaders have expressed more than
 once the desire to improve relations with China. But deeds, rather than words, are
 important. If the Soviet authorities really have a sincere desire to improve relations
 with China and take practical steps to lift their threat to the security of our
 country, it will be possible for Sino-Soviet relations to move toward normalization.
 The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is of long standing, and we
 will strive to safeguard and develop this friendship, no matter what Sino-Soviet
 state relations are like.
 Party-to-Party Ties    Our party develops its relations with other Communist or working-class parties in
 strict conformity with Marxism and the principles of independence, complete
 equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in each other's internal affairs....
 Communist parties should of course help each other, but it is absolutely
 impermissible for any of them to issue orders or run things for others from the out-
 side. Any attempt by one party to impose its views on other parties or interfere in
 their internal affairs can only lead to setbacks or failures in the revolutions of the
 countries concerned. As for the practice of one party compelling other parties to
 make their policies serve its own party and state policies, or even resorting to
 armed intervention in other countries, it can only undermine the very foundation of
 the international Communist movement.... We hold that all Communist parties
 should respect each other ... we wish to establish similar contacts with a greater
 number of progressive parties and organizations.

 Relations With Japan     Japan is China's neighbor.... The Japanese militarists unleashed one war of
 aggression after another against China.... Now some forces in Japan are
 whitewashing the past Japanese aggressions against China and other East Asian
 countries and are carrying out activities for the revival of Japanese militarism....
 Together with the Japanese people and with far-sighted Japanese public figures in
 and out of government, we will work to eliminate all hindrances to the relations be-
 tween our two countries and make the friendship between our two peoples flourish
 from generation to generation.
 Taiwan, Hong Kong, and   At this point, it should be emphasized that our party faces yet another historic
 Macao                    task, that of joining hands with all our patriotic fellow countrymen in a common
 endeavor to accomplish the sacred task of reunifying our motherland. Taiwan is
 part of the sacred territory of our motherland, and the people in Taiwan are our
 kith and kin.... It is China's internal affair with which no foreign country has the
 right to interfere. We hope that our compatriots in Taiwan, Xianggang (Hong
 Kong), and Aomen (Macao) and Chinese nationals residing abroad will urge the
 Kuomintang authorities to take a realistic view of the situation and put the future
 of our country and the interests of the nation above all else, instead of persisting in
 their obdurate stand, so that talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist
 Party may be held at an early date and, together, we can bring about the peaceful
 reunification of our motherland.
 Policy on Insurgencies   ... Revolution cannot be exported but can occur only by the choice of the people of
 the country concerned. It is on the basis of this understanding that we have always
 abided by the five principles of peaceful coexistence. We do not station a single sol-
 dier abroad, nor have we occupied a single inch of foreign land. We have never in-
 fringed upon the sovereignty of another country, or imposed an unequal relation-
 ship upon it. In no circumstances will we seek hegemony.
