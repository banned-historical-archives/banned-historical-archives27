			   	The  eminent  Americ~n  historian  on  foreign  affairs   	(Erneet  R.  May),  incisively
			   	points   	to  the  danger  that,  in  rendering  irreversible  and  essential  foreign

			   	of  this  new  era  of  Japan-China  friendahip,  we  are  naw  imbued  with  deeper  fear

			   	It  ia  not  necessary  for  me  to  ~:~int  out  that  this  fear  and  anxiety  has  been
     	'		   	umplified  by  the  fluid  political  situation  in  China,  which  surfaced  in  mid-

		     	situaeion  which~  in  general,   	could  have  been  foreseen.
		     	Of  course,   	to  Choae  who  remain  obsessed  with  Maoiat  mythg,   	the  presenC  etate
		     	of  affaire  muat  indeed  have  been  shocking.    	tIowever,  within  China's  society
		     	itself,   	criticism  of  Mao  was  so  latent  :and  recurring  that  it  ie  no  exagger-
		     	ation  to  say  all  "line"-related  strugglea  in  the  past  had  been  parC  of  thie
		     	criticism.    	Also,  during  the  recent  seven  or  eight  montha,   	the  de-Maoifica-
		     	Cion  proceas  wea  taking  a  concreCe  form  incernally.    	Therefore,   	China's  de-
		     	Maoification  ia  definitely  different  from  the  procesa  of  de-S~alinization
		    	which  required  the  ahock  treatmenC  of  iconoclasm.    	For  the  ma~ority  of  the
		     	Chinese  masses~  iC  muet  have  been  an,inevitable  phenomenon.
		     	China  has   	thus  begun  to  "Cake  off"  from  a  cloaed  society  of  Maoist  mytha.				   	"
		     	Hawever~   	this  does  not  mean  that  de-Maoification  will  proceed  amoothly  be -
		     	cause  there  are  eCill  elements  at   	the  center  of  power  which  have  inheri~ed
		     	the  legacies  of  Mao's  policies  and  because   	the  Maoiet  regime  continuea  to
		     	exiat  as   	a  social  syetem.    	Nonethelesa,  becauae  the  absence  of  clarity  dur-
		     	ing  the  post-Mao  eucceasion  to  pawer  is  beginning~~Co  be  definitely  criti-
	 	_	   	cized,   	there  is  no  denying  that  the  preaent  state  of  affairs  is   	causing
		     	Premier  Hua  Guofeng  himself  to  tremble  with  fgar  behind  the  "shadoa  of
		     	Mao  2edong,"  who  was   	the  source  of  his  political  existence.
		     	When  the  present  tranaition  ultimately  reaults  in  the  so-called  "total

	 	_		   	is   	th e  unawareneee  of  the   	conepicuoue  lack  of  symm~etry  regarding  decieione
			    	on  pollcy  and  intentiona  between  Japan  and  China.    	ir  ie  abundantly  clear
			    	that,   	from  the  etandpoint  of  present-day  China,   	the   	two  decieive  factors
			    	which  made  necessary  a  Japan-China  peace  and  friendehip  treaty  with  a  pro-
			    	~vision  on  "hegemony"  were  China's  global  atrategy   	(the  forging  of  an  anti-
			    	"hegemony,"  i.e.,   	anti-Soviet,  alliance)   	and  her  national  goal   	(the  four
			    	"mode rnizations").    	In  this  regard,   	despite  the  emphasis  on  a  relationship
			    	of  two  nationa   	"separated  only  by  a  narxow  strip  of  water"  and  two  peoplea
			     	coming  from  the  eame  atock  and  uein~  the  same  script~"  auch  a  global
			    	etrategy  and  national  goal  are  inconceivable  for  our  nation.    	To  begin  with,
			    	we  may  be  the  on.1y  "pawer"  without  a  national  goal  or  global  atrategy.
			    	Therefore~  our  policy  decioiona   	could  be  described  as  being  very  faithfully
	 	-		   	patterned  after  the  general  models  of  internatianal  nnd  domeatic  policy  de-
			    	cisions.    	It  goes  without  saying  that  thie  treaty  wae  greatly  influenced  by
			    	the  varioua   	(political)   	factora  of  our  inCernal  affairs  under  the  Fukuda
			    	adminiatration  and  by  economic  demands  steaming  from  a  long  period  of  re-
			    	ceasion.    	Although  Foreign  Miniater  Sonoda's  tenacity  and  the  antiquated
			    	theatrics  he  diaplayed  in  the  proceae  of  concluding  the  treaty  were  con-
			    	apicuous,   	it  cannot  be  claimed  that  our  bureaucratic  atructure   	(the  Foreign
			    	Office)   	asaumed  the  leaderehip  in  th~  policy  decisions  per  se.    	Nor  were
			    	public  opinion,   	the  mess  media  and  p~essure  groups  decieive  factors  in  this
			    	c as e.
			   	The  proceas  of  the  policy  formulation  leading  to  the  conclusion  of  the  Japan-
		~		   	China  pact  thue  extremely  lacked  symmetry  and,  wherers  China's  position  was
			   	determined  solely  on  a  strategic  basis,   	our  natton  adopted  a"low  policy"			  	'
			   	in  concluding  the  treaty.    	We  concentrated  our  attention  passively  on  the
			   	wording  of  the  "hegemony"   	clause,  worried  about  the  direct  responae  from  the
			   	USSR  and  were  unable  to  maintain  a  broader  strategic  perapective  concerning
			    	the  post-treaty  situation.    	Due  to  thia  difference,  despite  our  earneat  ad-
			   	vocacy  of  an  "all-directional  foreign  policy,"  the  nations  of  the  world  in
			   	general  evinced  l~ttle  interest  in  our  "all-directional  foreign  policy."
			   	They  saw  in  the  treaty  only  the  significance  of  China's  strategy.
			   	It  may  be  redundant   	to  point  out  China's  global  strategy  vis-a-vis   	the  USSR,
			   	but  what  about  the  stake  our  political  end  financial  circles  are  placing  on
			   	the   	"four  modernizations"  which  constitute  China's  present  national  goal?
			   	From  Deng  Xiaoping's  present  position,   	the  strengthening  of  his  awn  politi-
			   	cal  base  may  not  be  possible  except  by  puehing  furward  the  "four  moderniza-
			   	tione "  with  an  urgent  sense  of  mission.
			   	Meanwhile,   	the  greater  the  development  of  Japan-China  economic  relations,
			   	the  more  dissociated  China  would  become  from  the  principle  of  "salvation
			   	through  self-help"  and  the  greater  its  riek  of  ma~or  problems  in  the  future,

		  	Paying  a  Two-fold  Price
		  	M~anwhile,   	the  enormity  of  the  price  being  paid  by  Japan's  foreign  policy
		   	for  a  stake  in  China  became  quickly  and  abundantly  evident  through  two  re-
		   	cent  developmenta.    	One  is   	the  aigning  of  the  Soviet-Vietnam  friendahip  and
		   	cooperaCion   	treaty  on  3  November.    	The  other  is   	the  foreign  policy  �iaeco
		  	suffered  by  Japan  during  the  UN  Security  Council  election  for  nonpermanent
		  	member  seaCa.    	The  Soviet-Vietnam  treaty  was  clearly  a  direct  reaction  to
		   	Che  Japar: China  peace  and  friendahip  treaty.    	Furthermore,  when  we  realize
		   	that  the  concluaion  of  the  former~  which  includea  a"coneultation"  clauae				  	`
		   	(stating  that  the  partie~s   	concerned  will  consult  on  military  and  political
		  	matters  in  an  emergency  situation)   	initiated  by  Moscow,  is  a  hidden  and
     	~	   	fuuuamental  element  of  the  so-called  "'Asian  collective  aecuYity"  concept
		   	(for  details  see  the  chapter,   	"What  Is  the  Meaning  of  the  Asf an  Collective
		   	Security?",   	in  my  article:    	"The  Choice  of  Japan's  Foreign  Policy--BeLween
		   	the  Global  Strategiea  of  the  U.S.,  USSR  and  Ci?ina";  TOKYO  KEIZAI  SHINPOSHA,
		   	1978),  one  cannot  deny  that  the  aignificance  of  this  treaty  in  terms  of
		   	Asia's   	future  is  very  great.    	With  even  the  currenC  military  clash  betwQen
		   	China  and  Vietnam,   	the  Japan-China  cooperation  is,  of  course,   	a  major  threat
		   	to  Vietnam,   	forcing  Vietnam  to  aeek  strong  tiea  with  the  USSR.    	This  marked
		   	increase  in  Soviet  presence  on  the  Indochina  Penineula  may  invite  the  "re-
		   	turn"  of  the  United  States  which  "::�{*hdrew"  from  Asia.    	This  cannot  help  but
		   	increase  the   	tenaion  in  Asia.															  	`
		   	The  latter  fact  has   	clearly  exposed  the  weakness  in  the  foundation  o~  Japan's
		   	foreign  policy  which  is  oriented  taaard  the  ma~or  powera.    	Regardless  of  how
		  	we  may  bank  on  Japan-Chinb  relations,  when  we  realize   	the  cold  reality  that
		   	China  itself  failed  to  vote  on  our  side  and  that  some  of  the  ASEAN  co~ntrles,
		   	for  example,   	on  whom  we  had  counted  did  not  vote  for  ue,  we   	feel  that  this
		   	indicates   	the  cautious   	attitude  of  the  cotmtries  surrounding  China  toward
     	.	   	"a  union  of  Asia's  giants."
		   	Therefore,  in  apite    	of  the  optimism  that  our  international  environment  would
		   	become  peaceful  and  atabilized  with  the  conclusion  of  Che  .~a~an-China  peac~
		   	and  friendahip  treaty,   	reality  could  be  said  to  be  much  worse�    	Meanwhile,
		   	why  was  our  government  unable  to  perceive  even  such  a  short-range  outlook?
		   	Our  Foreign  Office  has  apparently  erred  in  its  evaluation  of  the  U.S.-Ching
		   	r.approachement,   	the  9lbanian  resolution  (on  China  representation),   	the  anti-

			    	The  characteristics  of  the  current  international  aituation,  in  contraet  to			 	~

			    	by  the  two  powera  in  internal  conflicts  around  the  world  has  intensified
			     	along  with  the  danger  of  limited  wara.    	Moreover,   	the  addition  of  the  China-		    	-

				3.    	Pitfalls   	of  the  Defense  Debate
		     	Meaning  of  the  "Emerg~ncy"  DebaCe
		     	The  recent  debate  on  "emergency"  in  Japan  arose  coincidentally  under  the
				aforementioned  internaCional  circumetances.    	In  the  light  of  the  interna-
				tional  situfition,   	Che  "Japan-U.S.  ~aint  measures  guidelines"  between  the
		     	U:S.   	forces   	and  Japan's  Self  Defense  Force  under  the  Japan-U.S.  security
				treaty,  which  were  reported  in  late  November  last  year,  contain  a  great
		     	many  irritating  problema.
		     	The  detailed  atudy  of  these  problems  rauat  be  left   	to  the  military  and  de-
		     	fense  experts.    	Hawever,   	the  most  problematical  issues  concern  the		~,.argency
		     	legis~ation"  and  the  "Japan-U.S.  ~oint  measures  guidelines."    	In  contrast  to
		     	the  criticism  which  is  expected  fram  some  opposition  party  members,   	the
		     	policymakers   	and  defense  authorities  in  Japan  seem  not  anly  to  be  virtually
		     	unaware  of  th~  dangerous  direction  of  internatior~al  affairs  surrounding  Japan,
		     	but  have  been  r~garding  Japan-China  relations  within  a  bilatera].  framework.
		     	They  also  seem  to  be  dealing  with  the  various  problems  related  to  the  Jap az.-
		     	U.S.   	security  tre aty  as  bilateral  problems   	or  as  measures  between  our  two
		     	countries   	for  the  purpose  of  strengthening  Japan's  ~e~ense  power.						  	-
		     	Frankly,  becaus~  they  are  highly  pleased  with  China's  acceptance  of  the
		     	Japan-U.S .  secur~ty  pact  c~z~d  China's  anticip~tion  of  the  strengthening  of
		     	Japan's  Self  nefenae  Force  as  the  bankruptcy  of  the  so-called  "unarmed
		     	neutrality"   	concept,  Japaneae  Government  auth~rities  lack  awareness  of  the
		     	overall  structure  of  the~"cool  war"  and  cannot  see  th~  price  they  are  pay-
		     	ing  for  their  choice  of  the  imminently  approaching  danger.    	Of  course,  some
		     	of  Che  supporters  of  an  anti-Soviet  Japan-China  alliance  seem  to  be  whole-
		     	heart~dly  in  favor  of  a  U.S.-Japan-China  anti-"hegemony"  alliance.    	However,			   	-
		     	the  ma~ority  of  government  leadera,  including  Prime  Minister  Fukuda  and
		     	Secretary  General  Ohira,  have  not  gone  that  far.    	This  is  why  they  ha~e
		     	supported  the  s~.ogan  of  an  "all-direc~ional  diplomacy."
		     	I  noted  earlier  that  "coincidence~'  of  our  national  "emergency"  debate.

		     	internatianal  situation  all  problems  related  to  foreign  policy  involve  na-
	 	-	   	tional  security.    	And,   	conversely,  it  can  be  suggested  that  our  national

		  	Abetinence  Neceaeary  in  China  Relations
		  	In  this  case,   	the  firat  problem  worth  attention  in  the  Japan-China  poat-
		  	treaty  re lationa  conce rns   	the  danger  of  viewing  theae  relations  through  the					'

		  	solidarity  of  the  one  billion  people  of  China  and  Japan."    	This  alogan  may
		  	sound  pleasant   	from  the  Chinese  aicle,  aince  900  million  of  the  one  billion

			 	to  our  national  security.
			 	In  effect,   	our  nation  ~hould  ~trictly  avoid  the  dangeroug   	line  of  a  Japan-
			 	U.S.  ~~curity  syatem  edvocaC~d  by  both  the  United  5tate~  and  China  in  form-

			 	concerning  the  important  international  task  of  coping  with  the  North-South
			 	problem.		From  this  standpoint~   	the  summit  conference  of  advanced  nationa
			 	(the  Tokyo  summit),  which  will  be  held  in  Japan  for  the  firat  time  in  June
			 	1979,  Will  prob~bly  become  a  touchatone   	for  our  foreign  policy,   	as  to
			 	whether  we  can  escape  from  the  fremework  of  the    	traditional  "world  econanic
			 	conference"  and  embrace  all  of  these  problems.
			 	Need  To  Coneider  a  Detour  Approach
			 	Thirdly~   	there  ia  tr~e  question  of  a  detour  approach  to  the  problem  of

			A  final  but  serioue  problem  is  the  fact  that  foreign  policy  as  a  strategy
			con tinuea   	to  hold  an  inferior  position  in  comparieon  to  the  priority  con-
			sideration  given  t4  the   	traditional  areas  of  politics  and  economics.    	In  the
   	'	   	preaent  international  situation,   	foreign  policy  is  in  effect  also  a  game  of
			images.    	It  is,   	of  course,   	at  :he  a.ame  time  the  human,  cultural  and  informa-

			cultural  contacts.    	Such  cultural  diplomacy  can  be  an  important  contribution
			to  our  national  security.    	Also,  in  the  preaent  cress-fire  of  the  global				    	~
			strategies  of  the  United  States,  China  and  the  ~,oviet  Union,   	our  nation,
			which  is  characterized  by  a  modern  and  diverse  ~:ulture,  has  reached  the
			point  where  it  must  give  further  aubstance  to  its  cultural  diplomacy.

			Of  course,  in  this  respect,   	the  International  Exchange  Fund  and  Overaeas

			policy  strategy  conetitutea  a  dileoama,  with  a  conce:n  about  "cultural  in-

		     	[Exr,erpts]    	Question:    	What  is  the  rec~cCion  of  Che  Nippon  'Celegraph-'Celephnne
		     	public  Corporation   	[NTT~   	to  the  U.S.  demand  for  giving  foreign  companies
		     	access  to  its  procurementa?
		     	Answer:    	I  canriot  understand  why  the  NTT  t~as  become  an  issue.    	It  may  be   	thaC
		     	tiic  bigger  ~  business  becomes,   	the  more  severe  criticiam  it  receives.    	NTT
		     	operations  ~re  very  specialfzed  and,  perhaps  for  Chis  reasQn,   	the  issue  is			     	-
		     	not  even  fully  understood  Within  Che  NTT.    	I  am  certain  that  it  is  beyond
		     	the  comprehension  of   	the  general  pu6lic.
		     	Since  it  is  not  a  domestic  issue  and  is  entirely  left  to  diplomatic  negotia-			  	-
		     	tions,   	there  simply  is  nothing  I  can  do  about  it.    	I  am  just  counting  on
		     	Mr  Ushiba   	(govexnment  representaCive  to  the  Tokyo-round  negotiations)   	and				 	_
		     	other  specialists  in  the  diplomatic  field.    	I  think  that  this  is  the  first
		     	time  the  ~oreign  Ministry  has  become  involved  with  the  telecommunications
		     	area  although  ministry  officials  are  highly  familiar  with  economic  problems.
		     	(~uestion:    	It  may  indeed  be  an  iasue  that   	is  di�ficult  to  understand,   	but
		     	how  do  you  explain  your  position  to  the  U.S.   	side?
		     	Answer:    	if   	the  United  States  needs  to  understand  the  facts  involved,   	then
		     	we  c:in  gtve  them  to  it  one  by  one.    	However,  We  will  be  in  trouble  if  the					!
		     	United  States  is  aware  of  all  the  facts  and  refuses  to  hear  us  any  further.			   	~

		     	Anot}~er  problem  is  that  we  can  hardly  find  an  independent  U.S.   	office  with

		     	Qucstion:    	The  Tokyo-round  negotiations  are  now  in  their  final  phase  and  a
		     	settlement  on  the  NTT  issue  has  become  a  gressing  demand.    	Judging  from  the

			  	,     	Anawer:    	The  British  Telegraph-Telephone  Public  Corporation  ehiftad  from
				  	private  contracts  to  bidding  in  1969,   	resulting  in  a  deterioration  in
				  	quality  oE  materials,   	conatruction  delays  and  trouble  gt  work~iCea.
				  	Consequently,   	it  reverted  to  private  contracts  only  2  years  after  the  change.
				  	Question:    	It  seems  an  overstatement  to  say  that,   	if  the  NTT  opens  itaelf
				  	up  to  foreign  companies,   	it  will  lead  to  bankrupCcy  for  many  businesees
				  	related   	to  the  NTT,   	correct?
				  	Answer:    	If  we  adopt  a  competitive  bidding  system,   	I  am  afraid  that  it  would
				  	entail  a  drain  from  the  cauntry  of  techniques  develop:d  bp  the  efforta  of
				  	our  speci.ylists.    	This  would  app'_y  not  nnly  to  the  NTT  but  to  other  manu-

				  	would  be  mnJe  public,   	it  would  demoralize  the  specialista.    	There  will  be
				  	no  suc1~  thin~  as  all  related  businesses  going  bankrupt,  one  right  after
				  	:~nother,   	but  we  should  remember  that  some  companies  partially  or  entirely
				  	depend  upon  the  NTT,   	including  Nippon  Denki  and  Fi~itau.    	Nippon  Denki
				  	depends  on  the  NTT  for  20  percent  of  its  business  and  Fujitsu,  22-23  percent.
				  	Question:    	Will  the  NTT,   	after  all,   	be  left  outside  the  Tokyo-round  inter-

				(TextJ    	Industry  has  started  to  make  gains,   	buC  with  rhe  government  giving
				up  its  1  percent  growth  "pledge,"  the  future  is  noC  at  all  clear.    	Where
				is  ttie  Japanese  economy  of  1979  headed?    	Has  there  been  any  change  from
		_	     	~ukuda  to  Ohira?    	We  have  spoken  with  the  positive  Hisao  Kinamori  and  the
				cnutious  Toshihiko  Yoshino.
				Kinamori:    	I  think  1979  will  be a.relatively  good  year.    	For  one  thing,   	dur-
				ing  1978  the  economy  finally  got  a  grip  on  recovery.    	F'ive  years  after  the
				oil  shock,   	industry  is  ad,justing  well  and  has  found  the  sCrength  for  self-
				recovery.    	Prices  have  also  stabilized  and  business  loans  and  inventory
				have  decreased--things  are  looking  good.    	Investment  in  equipment,  which
				up  until  now  has  been  very  sluggish,   	started  to  move  in  1978  with  the  focus
				on  service  industries.    	Isn't  this  quite  a  change?
		     	Also,   	because  fairly  aggressive  public  investment  policiea  were  enacted  in
				1978,   	demand  has  recoverEd,  mainly  in  construction  induatries  and  construc-
				tion  machinery.
		     	On  the  other  hand,   	the  end  of  1978  saw  exports  greatly  reduced  because  of
				the  rise  of  the  yen.    	But  when  you  look  at  the  pluses  and  minuses  together,			    	-
				i   	think  the  plus  side  is  still  stronger.    	Won't  this  trend  be  carried  for-
		     	ward  into  the  new  year  and  won't  1979  be  bright?

			     	a~?eagurc  for  reducing  our  internetional  balance  of  pgymenCa  eurplus.    	Con-		   	`
			     	~idering  the  probleme   	of  dome~tic  unemploymen~  and  those  of  industrial  mgn-
			     	ngemrnt,   	i  cannnt  view  it  ep  something  J~pan  decided  on  voluntarily.
			     	Tl~erefore,   	I  oppos~  tf~e  ~  percent  growth,  whi.ch  Che  Ohira  adminietration
			     	know~  ie  impoestble.    	I   	Chink  thaC  planCing  the  seeds  of  future  in~fl.ation
			     	and  greatly  increasing   	the  national  debt,  which  are  the  result  of  a  general
			     	expensi,an  o�  spending,   	are  thinga  we  should  not  do  at  this  time.
			     	However~   	I  am  not  saying  for  a  minute  that   	the  more  we  restrain  the  rate  of
			     	gY~owth,   	the  better.    	I   	think  we  should  find  other  ways  to  deal  with  employ-
			     	ment  ~nd  the  eurplus  in  international  paymenta--and  not  by  generally  increas-
			     	ing  the  growth  rate.
			     	Kinamori:     	I  think  the  economy  has  gradually  improved,  but   	the  growth  rate
			     	is  still  not  aufficient.    	Even  though  domestfc  demand  is  at  a  good  level,
			     	exports  }tnve  decreased  more  than  expected.    	The  government's  interpretation
     	_		     	is  thaC  Chis  has  depressed  everything.    	Exports  also  exert  an  importanC
			     	influence  on  the  employment  problem,   	and  when  we  take  thia  inCo  account,   	I
			     	think  t}ie  queation,  after  all,   	is  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  economy.    	If
		     	,		grawth  is   	lower~   	khe  employment  problem  will  be  difficult  to  solve.    	Because
			     	Japan  lias  a  very  high  raCe  of  rise  in  producCivity,  when  the  growth  rate  is
			     	about  5  percent,   	industry  can  get  along  even  without  hiring  more  people.
			     	At  a  S  percent  rate,   	the  number  of  ~obless  people  has  increased  about  200,000
			     	over   	last  year.
			     	isn't   	the  most  impor~ant  target   	of  economics  the  employment  problem?    	As
			     	usual,   	there  is  a  surplus  in  international  payments,   	and  equipment  is  in
			     	g~od  supply;   	even  the  rate  of  price  increases  is  extremely  low.    	Wholesale
			     	prices  have  probably  fallen  4  percent  relative  to  last  year.    	Therefore,
			     	isn't   	it  an  important   	task  for  the  new  year  to  go  ahead  with  a  more  positive
			     	policy  and   	to  stabilize   	the  economy~  which  has  finally  begun  to  recover?
			    	Yoshino:    	Althougl~  I  have  several  reasons  why  we  should  not  always  oppose
			    	a  7  percent  growCh  rate,   	one  is  that  I   	fear  inflation  will  result  if  we
			     	reach  for  a  predetermined  growth  rate  whatever  the  cost,   	and  if  we  must
			     	increase  public  consumption  based  on  a  large  increase  in  Che  budget  in  order
	     	~			to  makc  up  for  what  is   	lost  in  exports.    	In  1978,   	although  we  issued  national
			    	bonds  nmounting  to  11  trillion  and  several  hundred  billion  yen,   	I  think
			     	ttiut  in  1979  so  large  an  amount  will  not  be  permissible.    	If  thoae  national
			    	bonds  are  satisfactorily  absorbed,   	I  am  certainly  not  opposed  to  taking  in
			    	excess  capital  by  increasing  the  national  debt  and  stimulating  the  econamy
			     	financtally.    	However,   	conditions  have  changed  since  April  1918,  when  we			   	-
			    	reformecl  the  regulations   	for  issuing  national  bonds,   	and  lowered  the  10-
			    	yer~r  bond  interest  rate   	to  6.18  percent.    	In  other  words,   	the  sellers  of
			    	national  bonda  have  increased  and  the  buyers  have  decreased.    	If  the  value
			    	oE  national  bonds  is  lawered,   	absorption  is  hindered.    	Hereafter,   	if  we
			    	further  increase  the  national  debt  by  a  great  amount,   	this  tendency  will

		     	nmounea.    	A1Chough  I  won't  go  so  far  as  to  say  that  danger  immediaCely  follows
		     	when  we  buy  naCional  bondg  in  the  same  way  as  we  aupport  t'he  dollar,   	by

		     	worked  hsrd   	eo  stabiliz~,  wi11  go  up  again?    	In  that  aense~   	I  think  that
		     	~xcesaive  attention  to  increasing  the  money  aupply  and  the  policy  of  gener-
		     	a11y  increasing  demand  is  an  old  way  of  thinking.
		     	Rather,   	the  important  thing  ia  to  pay  a  little  more  heed  to  how  to  reemploy
		     	people  of  middle  and  upper  age  leve la  who  are  the  victima  of  their  place  in
		     	the   	industrial  hierarchy~   	in  what  can  be  callel  a"structural  recession."
		     	At  any  rate,   	I  am  noC  opposed  to  a  broad  rate  of  growth  in  1979.    	More  than
		     	that,   	I  ti~ink  it  is  a  year  to  Cake  specific  steps  regarding  the  imporCant
		     	emplayment   	problem.
		     	Interest  ratea:    	will  they  go  dawn  or  not?
     	,			Kinamori:    	If  we  do  not  continue  the  recovery  of  fiscal  initiative  at  least
		     	Eor   	1  morc  year,   	in  1.979,   	I  think  there  is  the  possibility  that  the  ecoaomy,
		     	wliich  has  ~ust  begun  to  recover,  will  deteriorate  again.    	In  order  to  make
		     	recovery  permanent,   	a  broad  expansion  of  public  investment  is  necessary.
		     	At  this  year's  level,   	the  national  debt  is  11  trillion  yen.    	ThaC  is  unaccept-
		     	able.    	If  we  do  not  raise  an  additional  S  to  6  trilli~tt  yen,  we  will  not  be
		     	able   	to  put   	together  the  necessary  budget.    	Although  it   	ia  a  question  of
		     	whether  or  not   	it  can  be  absorbed,  we  had  better  improve  the  so-called  tech-
		     	nical  problem  of  diversifying  the  national  debt.
		     	However,~as  a  whole,   	there  is  an  excess  of  savings  in  Japan.    	If  interest
		     	rates  are  unrestricted,   	I  do  not  think  we  will  be  unable  to  sell  the  necess.:ry
		     	national  bonds.    	However,   	because  we  have  a  system  of  controlled  currency,   	I
		     	think  that  a  policy  is  required  vis-a-vis  the  level  of  interest  rates  whereby
		    	we  ad~just  those  ratea  to  the  point  at  which  necessary  growth  can  be  realized.
		    	ThereEore,   	by  lowering  bank  interest  rates  a  little  more  and  by  issuing
		    	national  bonds,  we  will  expand  necessary  public  investment.
		    	Yet  there  is  a  problem  of  balance  in  using  public  investment  alone.    	Because
		    	I   	think  it  is  desirable  to  consider  the  economy  as  a  whole,   	it  has  been  my
		    	opinion  for  a  long  time  that  we  should  match  our  demands  for  public  invest-
		    	ment  with  a  decrease  in  taxes.
		    	However,   	because  there  is  a  strong  feelins  that  it  is  nonsense  to  talk  about
		    	reducing  taxes  when  the  economy  is  in  trouble,   	I  think  there  is  no  prospect
		    	of  a  lowering  of  taxes.    	Therefore,   	don't  public  investment  and  lowering  bank
		    	interest  ratea  somewhat  become  central  concerns?

					Yomhind:    	Until  n  1ow~ring  o�  Ch~  price  of  national  bonde  occurred  in  Apri1
					1978,   	I  was  rarely  in  agreem~nt  with  Mr  Kinamori.    	Rather,   	untiZ  that  time
					Y  thoub'~t  we  ehould  low~r  taxes~    	Nowever,  because  I~udge  the  change  3n  the
					condiCion  of  Che  narional  bond  market  since  April  Co  be  an  omen  of  great
					danger,   	I  t~ave  come  to  think,   	from  that  time~   	that  eax  reduction  is  not
					appropriate.    	The  reason  ia  that  if  we  lower  taxes,  we  must  increase  our
					naCional  debt.    	At  that  time,   	if  we  cannot  smoothly  abeorb  that  debt,  we
					wi11  carry  ouC  massive  buying  aupport  in  order  to  check  the  fa11  3n  the  mar-
					ket  value  of  national  bonda.    	Becauae  there  ie  the  danger  that  this  will  be-
					come  the  basie  for  greatly  increased  currency  producCion  in  the  future  and
					a  source  of  price  increasea,   	I  have  changed  my  mind,   	and  think  we  should
					grit  our  teeth  and  give  up  the  ideu  of  reducing  Caxes.
					And~   	concerning  Mr  Kinamori's  point  that  Japan's  intPrest  rates  are  Coo
					high,  my  view  is  a  bit  differenC.    	The  official  raCe  between  America  and
					Japan  is  6  percent,   	and  the  prime  rate  can  go  higher.    	America  fa  far  higher
					and  Japan  is  far  lower.
					The  rate  of  increase  in  consumer  pri.cea  hae  reflected  the  riae  of  the  yen
					up  uneil  nnw.    	Up  to  the  present,   	the  base  raCe  for  the  country  as  a  whole
					lias  been  3  percent.    	But  when  Che  yen  went  down  when  Preaident  Carter  announced
					his  support  of  the  dollar  on  1  November  1978,   	wholesale  prices  since  November
			 	'     	liave  had  a  reactionary  rise.    	Now  interest  rates  on  1-year  fixed-term  depoaits   	~
			     	~re  4-5  percent,   	but  if  this  trend,  which  has  appeared  in  wholesale  prices,
					affects  consumer  prices,   	I  think  the  day  is  near  that  savings  will  decrease.
			     	Cert~inly,   	if  we  lower  interest  ratea  on  loans,   	industry  will  benefit.    	To
					that  extent  I  think  it   	is  desirable,   	b~t  given  the  conditiona  of  present
			     	banking  facilities,   	1   	think  that  we  cannot  lower  interest  ratea  on  loane  to
					the  extent  that  Mr  Kinamori  says  without  greatly  lowering  savings  interest				_
					rates.
		    	.	  	Kinamori:    	America  has  a$20  bi;,lion  international  balance  of  payments  deficit.
					Imported  goods  cost  that  much  more  than  goods  made  domestically.    	Thus,  I
			     	think  it   	is  appropriate  that  the;r  raise  interest  rates  and  don't  use  tao
			     	much  money.    	However,   	in  the  case  of  Japan,  although  we  repeatedly  say  we
			     	will  lower  our  surplus,   	in  1978  won't  it  be  about  $17-$18  billion?    	Therefore,
			     	isn't  it  appropriate  that  on  the  one  hand  we  uae  if  financially,   	and  on  the
			     	ot~~er  hand  lower  interest  rates  so  we  can  use  more  equipment  investment
			     	domesticAlly?
			     	Regarding  prices~  wholesale  pricea  have  declined  4  percent  and  are  the  same		     	l�~~~
																									 	6  ;
			     	as    	ast  year.    	Certainly~   	if  the  exchange  rate  is  lowered,   	prices  may  go  up
			     	because  costs  for  imported  raw  materials  will  go  up.    	However,   	there  is  no
		    	_	 	previous  postwar  example  in  Japan  of  prices  having  acutally  gone  down  4

			     	worry  about  inflation  at  such  a  time.
			     	As  for  a   	3  percent   	rise  in  consumer  price,this  too  is  historically  very  low,

			  	in  profite  continue?
			 	Yoahino:    	I  am  not  gayittg  we  already  have  inflati.on  now.    	~'he  raCe  of  in-
			  	cr~ase  in  wholesale  prices  relative  to  last  year  is  minua  4.01  percenC--it
			  	has  really  gone  down.    	If,   	however,  you  divide  it   	into  domestic  and  foreign
			  	factore,   	gnd  then  if  you  divide  foreign  factore  into  contract  and  exchgnge
			  	factors~   	exchange  factora  emerge  as  minus  4.18  percent.    	Thia  means  that
			  	t}ie  decreased  portion   	is  almoat  entirely  becauae  of  the  rise  of  the  yen.
			  	Although  wholesale  pricea  have  gane  down  4  percent  compared  to  lasC  year,			    	~
			  	the  rise  in  consumer  pricea  is  at  the  same  time  close  to  4  percent.    	If
			 	wholesale  pricea  set  off  a  reactionary  increase  in  pricea,   	there  is  no  doubt		     	,
			  	thnt  consumer  prices  will  go  up  more.    	If  thia  occurs,   	there  is  naCurally
			  	the  possibiliCy  that  the  vicioua  circle  of  wage  and  price  i~  :reases  will
			  	occur  again,   	and  soon  a  consumer  price  increase  rate  of  the  sort  that  will
			  	exceed  the  int~rest  rate  of  fixed-period  eavings  will  occur.    	I  am  older
			  	than  Mr  Kinamori,   	and  although  it  may  ~e  the  fault  of  nervousnesa,   	I  really
			  	do  not  think  it  is  that  simple  a  thing.
			  	Lookin~  next  at  the  economy,  what  will  happen  to  industrial  profits  is
			  	important.    	In  the  past  a  separation  of  macroeconomics  and  microeconomics
			  	was  spoken  of.    	Macro  wae  good;  micro  was  bad.    	I  am  opposed  to  that  view
			  	now.    	Although  salea  have  declined  2.7  percent  compared  to  the  previous
			  	period  becauae  of  liquidations  in  the  period  ending  September  1978,   	earn-
			  	ings  have  increased  11.6  percent.
			  	As  the  government  expected,   	the  growth  rate  has  been  low,   	and  therefore  un-		  	~
			  	employment  has  increased.    	Why  does  this  kind  of  macro  and  micro  separation
			  	occur?    	Because  of  the  rise  of  the  yen,   	things  purchased  from  abroad  are
			  	cheaper  and  there  are  companies  which  make  a  great  marginal  profit  on  ex-
			  	change.    	Also,   	even  companies  which  buy  domestically,   	processing  things
			  	which  other  companies  have  imported  without  importing  things  directly  from
			  	foreign  countries,  are  able  to  say  to  other  companies,   	"Because  you  have
			  	bought  at  a  cheap  price,   	isn't  it  strange  to  sell  at  such  a  high  price?"
			  	Industry  is  not  the  same  as  conaumers.    	If  induatries  are  united,   	there  is			  	~
			  	much  room  for  negotiation.    	When  the  exchange  market  price  goes  up,   	cases			    	'
			  	often  come  up  where  they  even  put  in  a  sliding  clause  which  says  they  will			  	I~
			  	lower  the  price  by  that  much.    	Therefore,   	the  cost  of  imports  has  generally				~
			  	decreased  considerably.    	If  we  look  at  the  Bank  of  Japan's  import  price					i
			  	index,   	compared  to  the  same  month  last  year,   	it  has  gone  down  more  than  20
			  	percent.    	About  two-thirds  of  the  reason  that  industrial  profits  took  a
			  	favorable  turn  ia  the  benefits  from  the  rise  of  the  yen.    	The  other  one-
			  	third  is  that  the  Bank  of  Japan  enacted  a  policy  of  low  interest  rates,   	and
			  	rates  fell.    	Added  to  this,   	consumer  prices  have  stabilized  and  wages  have
			  	not  gone  up  very  much.

				  	but   	there  ia  a  subtle  diffei~ence  between  l~ng  and  ahort-term  rates.    	Still,
				   	for   	the  time  being,   	I  think  short~term  ratea  will  continue  to  decllne,  but
				   	aeen  as  a  10-year  national  debt,  won't  long-Cerm  rates  probably  cease  to  go
				  	down?
				  	Also,   	if  the  falling  rate  of  wholesale  prices  brings  down  peraonnel  expenses,
				   	and   	if  the  riaing  rate  of  conaumer  pricea  increases,   	the  rare  of  wage  increase
				  	wi11  probably  go  up.
				   	One  more   	Ching  concerning  Che  rapid  decrease  in  the  workforce--I  think  this,
				   	after  all,  will  run  into  resistance  from.society.
				   	Kinamori:    	Macro  is  not  very  attractive,  but  micro  has  improved.    	Thus,  I
				   	Chink  the  feelings  of  industry  have  greatly  changed  and  have  become  brighter.
				   	industrial  sales  have  fallen  off,   	but  pro�its  have  increased.    	When  you  ask
				   	why   	this  happens,   	I  anewer  that  it   	ia  because  differences  find  some  outlet.
				   	One   	is  abroad.    	Japanese  industry  makes  money~  and  because  it  buys  lawer
				   	from  abroad  and  sells  higher,   	foreign  countries  lose.    	Another  reason  is  be-
				   	cause  wages  have  not  gone  up  much  and  the  workfo~ce  has  decreased,  and  rhe.
				   	rate  of   	labor-aharing  has  gone  dawn.    	Another  reason  for  increased  profit
				   	!s,   	I   	think,   	the  government's  deficit.    	Because  the  government  has  apent
				   	more   	than  it  has  received,  induetrial  profits  have  risen.    	However,   	I  do
				   	not   	think  this  increaee  ~.n  profits  while  sales  as  a  whole  decline  will  con-
				   	tinue  for  very  long.    	Certainly,  we  cannot  have  such  a  reduction  of  the  work-
	    	=		     	force.    	The  rate  of  labor-sharing  has  risen  a  little  too  much.    	I  Chink  this
				   	effeet   	on  industrial  profits  came  about  in  the  course  of  normalization,  but
				   	by  a  certain  time,   	if  sales  do  not  increase,   	profits  won't  go  up  either.
				   	Even   	though  we  may  somehow  make  it  through  March  1979  under  these  conditions,
				   	I  feel  profits  may  drop  around  September.
				   	Thus,   	for  another  year,   	in  1979,  we  must  boost  finances.    	And  isn't  it
				   	necessary  to  bring  increased  revenues and  profits  into  the  new  year?    	The
				   	expansion  of  a  monetary  deficit  is  definitely  a  problem,  but  for  a  while  we
				   	must   	close  our  eyes  to  it.    	Closing  our  eyes  will,  I  think,  expand  the  mone-
				   	tary  deficit  a  little  more.    	If  we  look  at  it  only  f rom  this  angle,   	it  is
				   	certainly  not  a  desirable  situation,  but  if  we  do  not   	take  the  long  view
				   	that   	the  economy  will  improve,   	the  resu3t  will  be  that  we  must  continue
				   	issuing  national  bonds  indefinitely.    	Therefore,   	even  if  the  deficit  expands		 	_
				   	for  a  short  while,   	taking  the   	longer  view,   	if  we  don't  use  finances  so  that
				   	the  economy  improves,   	it  will  be  a  bad  situation.
				   	The  yen  market:    	200  or  210  yen?
				   	Yoshino:    	One  important   	factor  in  thinking  about  the  economy  is  what  will
				   	happen  to  the  yen  exchange  rate.    	On  1  November  1978,   	President  Cart~r			    	~

			  	announced  a  policy  of  dolLar  protection.    	America  deposited   	(traded)   	currency
			  	with  other  countries,  withdrew  capital  from  the  Tnternational  Monetary  Fund
			   	(IMP),   	and  sold  Special  Drawing  Rights   	(SDR).    	On  the  one  hand  they  expressed
			  	Cheir  detcrminAtion  to  maintain  the  dollar  and  procur~~  funds  up   	ta  $30  billion.
			  	And  because  they  even  took  steps  once  to  raise  the  official  raCe  by  1  percent,
			  	a  movement  resulted  whereby  the  excesaive  ri.se  of  the  yen  was  revised.    	How-
			  	ever,   	I  really  do  not   	think  this  will  take  us  back  to  the  level  prevailing
			  	around  the  end  of  1977.
			  	Although  the  calculation  differs  depending  on  who  is  doing  it,   	the  amount
			  	of  dnllars  which  has  gone  from  the  U.S.   	Cu  foreign  countries  is   	at  least
			  	$450  billion,   	and  many  people  say  $600  billion.    	Taking  an  average  of  $500
			  	billion,   	speculating  10  percent  would  be  $50  billion.    	Twenty  percent  is
			  	$100  billion.    	There  are  plenty  of  reasons  to  suspect  that  $30  billion  is
			  	not  enough  to  aupport   	the  ciollar.    	Moreover,   	because  America's  international
	  	"			payments  deficit  still  continues,  excess  dollars  continue  to  increase.    	There-
			   	fore,  American  inflation  is  clearly  coming  to  an  end   	[sic~.    	It  would  be  good
			  	if  the  inCernational  paymenCs  deficit  were  reduced,   	but  as   	long  as   	it  is
			  	not,  ~ust  how  long  we  will  have  a  policy  of  dollar  protection  is  problematic.
			  	If  you  see  things  that  way,   	I  think  there  will  be  a  movement  from  190  to  200
			  	yen.
			  	Kinamnri:    	Because  America  has  taken  the  position  of  buying  and  supporting
			   	the  dollar  with  $30  billion,   	Che  dollar  has  recovered,  but  the  basic  causes
			  	have  r;ot  changed  that  much.    	I  do  not  think  American  inflation  will  readily
			  	end,   	and  Japan's  surplus  in  balance  of  payments  will  continue  for  the  time
			  	being.    	This  factor  still  works  in  the  direction  of  raising  Che  yen.    	If
			   	the  veneer  of  policy  wears  off,  won't  the  yen  become  still  stronger?    	The
			  	desirable  level  is  about  200  yen.    	If  the  yen  does  not  get  a  little  weaker,			  	-
			  	Japan's  export  industries  will  not  be  able  to  carry  on  normal  business,   	I
			   	think,  and  because  our  domestic  economy  is  suffering  and  our  international
			  	surplus  in  balance  of  payments  continue,   	the  possibility  that  a  rise  in
			   	the  yen  may  recur  i~  very  real.
			  	We  cannot  con~ecture  about  matters  of  foreign  governments,   	but  the  American
			  	government  says  that  because  the  dollar  is  its  currency,   	it  must  protect  it.
			   	I  think  they  feel  that  if  the  dollar  becomes  a  little  weaker,  more  strength
			  	would  accrue  to  American  goods  in  export  competition,  and  if  the  balance
			  	oE  payments  improved,   	it  would  be  good.    	However,   	that  is  not  the  only  rea-
			  	son  why  they  are  giving  positive  support  to  the  dollar:    	they  are  worried
			   	that  OPEC  will  greatly  raise  its  prices.    	Moreover,   	an  important  thing  is			   	~
			   	that  American  inflation  has  bzcome  very  pronounced.    	If  the  dollar  gets				 	I
			  	weaker,   	American  domestic  prices  will  increase.    	And  the  popularity  of  the			  	~
			  	government  will  decline.    	Therefore,  I   	think  that  policies   	to  fight  infla-
			   	tion  are  an  extremely  important  goa.l.    	However,  America  does  not  have  basic
			  	confidence  in  the  dollar  now.    	Therefore,   	even  if  we  think  that   	the  dollar
			  	has  now  stabilized,   	1  feel  that   	the  possibility  is  strong  that  this  will
			  	not  last.

			     	Added  to  this,   	the   	lowering  nf  import  cogts  besed  on  the  rise  of  the  y~n
			     	had  an  unexpectedly  great  effect.
			     	Kinamori:    	But  exports   	from  Japan  have  decllned  in  amount  nf  revenue  and
			     	in  quuntity.    	This   	ie  a  rare  thing  for  Japen.    	Even  if  the  rise  of   	the  yen
			     	is  ndt  directly  related  to  bankruptcies,   	there  are  in  reality  many  induatri~a
			     	which  can  no  longer  afford  to  export.    	A18o,   	there  are  many  which  do  ~Qt
			     	export  any  more  because  it   	is  aenseless  to  do  so.    	In  the  automobile  snd
			     	home  electric  industries,  where  up  until  now  exports  were  favorable,   	even
			     	domescic  demand  has  o~sified.    	Because  profits  originally  Wpre  relatively
			     	good,   	tlie  dreaded  bankruptcies  did  not  occnr.    	NoWever,   	I  think  there  is  no
			     	mistnkc  thnt  the  decrease  in  exports  has  been  a  fairly  large  negative  factor
			     	for  the  economy,    	Therefore,   	to  say  it  again,   	I  think  things  will  be  bad  if
			     	we  do  not  make  it   	[he  basis  of  our  policy  to  give  careful  thought  to  thoae
			     	points  and  to  cover  that  portion  by  expanding  domestic  demand.
			     	Yoshino:    	An  importan[   	Ching  is  how  to  keep  Japan's  economy  on  the   	track  of
			     	stnblc  growth.    	In  other  words,  we  are  not  presently  in  a  period  of  high-
			     	level  growth  like  beEore.    	How  can  we  best  deal  with  the  unemployment  that
			     	comes  about  in  the  course  of  thnc?    	And,  because  we  have  too  great  a  sur-
			     	plus  in  the  international  balance  of  payments,  we  hgve  exposed  ourselves  to
			     	fierce  international  criticism.    	We  are  not  solving  the  problem  of  hoa  beat
			     	to  deal  with  that.    	Thcrefore,  governmenc  ~olicies  should  put  great  stresg
			     	on  measures  which  directly  shrink  the  surplus  in  the  international  balgn~e
			    	of  paymcnts,  and  on  unemployment  countermeasures.    	Moreover,  naa?  is  not  [he
			     	time  to  think  about   	the  redenomination  of  the  yen,  Which  has  almost  no  re-
			     	lation  to  the  substance  of  economies.
			    	Kinamori:    	No,   	I  think  we  had  bet[er  carry  out  redenomination.    	With  S1
			    	now  equal  to  200  yen,   	it   	is  very  strange~   	internationally  speaking,   	and  for
			    	business,   	too,   	it   	is  inconvenient.    	I  think  that  prices  will  atabilize,   	and
			    	that  now  is  a  good  chance  to  do  i[.
			    	However,   	taking  the  long  view~  because  Mr  Fukuda  has  been  replaced,   	the
			    	time  Eor  carrying  it  out  has  receded  a  little.

			    	provements  are  neceaeary  such  as:    	(1)   	Expaneion  o�  the  target  group  of  con-
			    	sumers;   	(2)   	simplification  of  handling;   	and   	(3)  expansion  and  liberalization
			    	of  borrowing  purposee.    	The  clasaic  example  of  this  is  the  bank  card  loan.
			    	Mnreover,   	the  equipping  of  a  personal  credit  reporting  system  network  and  a
			    	warraiity  structure  are  indispeneable.    	Because  it  vill  be  connected  with  the
			    	problem  of  personal  privacy.  a  peraonal  credit  reporting  syatem  in  particular
			    	involvea  some  very  difficult  aepects,   	but  in  any  caee  it  will  probably  take
			    	the  form  of  a  link-up  between  the  National  Bank  Aesociation'e  personal
			    	credis  data  bank  plan  now  under  study  and  the  organized  credit  fi~.e  of  the
			    	rest  of  the  credit  industry  when  this  ia  completed.    	In  addition,   	the  equip-
			    	ping  of  collection  organization~  and  a  conaumer  protection  system  are  also
			    	likely  to  cause  probleme.
			    	Creat  Convenience  With  Interbank  On-Line
			    	Next,   	let  us  look  at  the  forecaet  for  individual  products.  Firat,   	the  card
			    	loan  will  probably  be  the  heart  af  consumer  credit  for  exieting  producCe.
			    	In  functional  terms,  for  example.   	innovations  euch  as  aets  of  varioua  types
			    	af  accounts;  agreed  upon  repayment  plans;   	and  transfer,  depuait,  and  With-
			    	drawnl  of  funds  by  telephone  are  envisioned.  Alao,   	through  interbank  on-line
			    	hookups,   	it  will  prabebly  be  poasible  to  make  and  repay  loane  at  anq  time
			    	through  the  automatic  caeh  disbursal  machines  of  any  financial  institution.
			    	Until  now,   	the  principal  type  of  peraonal  loan  has  been  a  joint  loan  tying
			    	toRether  household  appliance  and  automobile  companies.    	Recently,  however~
			    	the  trend   	is  to  move  away  ~rom  things,   	that  is,  loans  for  the  purpose  of
			    	purchasing  speciPic  products,   	toaard  loans  for  the  purchase  of  aervicea,

				 	Moreover,  automobile  makers  and  large  dietributions,  auch  as  department

				 	ing  as  an  alternative  to  the  "wage  earner"  loah  sharke.    	Their  future  de-
				 	velopment  will  be  watched.
				 	Meanwhile,  with  reapect  to  new  product  development,  t~ith  the  improvement  of
				 	computer  uae  technology,   	the  development  of  all  eorts  of  conaumer  credit  is
				 	said  to  be  theoretically  posaible.    	The  three  remaining  major  problems  are:

				 	the  development  of  coneumer  credit  based  upon  a  neW  system  such  as  that  of
				 	the  Japan  Data  Center   	(NDC)  plan.
				 	The  NbC  Plan  Suggesta  Future  Direction
					The  NDC  plan  was  unveiled  last  November.  ~~Since  then,   	atudy  by  Japan  Tele-
				 	phone  and  Telegraph~   	financial  institutiona,  distributora,  and  othere  has
				 	been  progresaing.    	The  essential  elementa  of  the  plan  are:   	(1)  shopping
				 	service  at  retail  storea;   	(2)   	remittance  by  telephone  instruction  (Data
					Phone);   	and   	(3)   	in-store  cash  advance  aervice.    	The  shopping  aervice  system,
					which  is  the  cnain  pillar  of  the  plan,   	is  shown  in  the  preceding  figure.    	At
					present  its  prospects  for  realization  are  faint,  but  it  is  believed  to  in-
					dicAte  the  future  direction  of  consianer  credit.

		 	for.the  development  of  the  H-2  rocket   	for  manned  epace  development.
		 	bevelopment  Coat  About  180  Billion    	m
		 	The   	total  development  coet   	for  the  H-1  rockeC  is  expected  to  be  about  180
		 	billion  yen.    	This  includes  60  billion  yen  for  rhe  development  of  a  LH-LOX
		 	propulsion  system  to  launch  a  500  kg  artificial  satellite,   	60  billion  yen
		 	for  C?~e  launch  aite  and  ground  test  faciliCies,  and  60  billi.on  yen  for  two
		 	test   	Elights  in  FY  1984.
		 	There  has  been  the  opinion  in,some  quarters  as  to  wheCher  it  wouldn'C  be
		 	clieaper  to  make  use  of  American  space  shuttles  instead  o�  spending  all  of
		 	this  time  and  money  for  rocket  development.    	Taka  Tsunashima,   	deputy  chair-
		 	mnn  of  the  Space  Uevelopment  CommitCee  atates  however  that  "when  considering			    	_
		 	a  practicAl  satellite  for  the  future,   	there  is  no  assurance  that  shuttle
		 	launch  will  be  ad~ueted  to  our  schedule,  and  also  when  we  have  to  consider
		 	the  possibility  of  having  to  launch  a  aecond  satelliCe  in  case  of  failure
		 	of  the   	first,   	it  is  necessary  to  have  rocket  development  based  on  our  own
		 	technology."    	There  is  no  denying  the  fact  that  the  establishment  of  our
		 	own  unique  technology  is  a  necessary  condition  when  there  will  naturally
		 	ensue  many  problems  involving  international  cooperation  in  space  develop-
		 	ment.
		 	!'rototyE~e  Manufacture  and  Testing  From  FY  1980
		 	In  the  N-1   	rocket  development  schedule,   	research  atarted  in  FY  1974  with
		 	basic  studies  on  the  second  stage  engine,   	critical  to  development  of  the
		 	entire  system,   	preceding  that  on  the  first  and  third  stages.    	Basic  studies			    	;
		 	on  the  third  stage  and  the  guidance  control  system  will  start  in  the  next
		 	fiscal  year,  and  prototype  manufacture  and  testing  start  in  FY  1980.

			    	Starting  with  Japan's  first  rocket,  the  pencil  rocket  developed  by  the  Space
			    	and  Aeronautical  Research  Institute  of  Tokyo  Univeristy  in  1955,  both  aize
			    	and  performance  have  increased  through  the  Baby,  Kappa  (K),  Lambda   	(L)~   	and
			    	Mu  (M)   	series  of  rockets,  with  a  Lambda-4S  rocket  launching  Japan's  first
			    	~rtificial  satellite  Osumi  into  apace.    	On  the  other  hand,  with  reapect  to
			    	practical  applications  or  rocketa  and  satellitea  for  apace  communicationa
			    	and  meteorological  observation,   	the  Science  and  Technology  Board~   	the
			    	Ministry  of  Posts  and  Telecommunications,  and  the  Minietry  of  Transportation
			    	tinve  been  conducting  research  since  1960,  and  the  development  work  has  now
			    	been  tnken  over  and  pursued  since  1969  by  the  corporation.
			    	The  N-rocket  currently  used  by  the  corporation  is  a  liquid-liquid-solid
			    	1-stage  rocket  capable  of  launching  a  roughly  130-kg  stationary  satellite.
			   	'fhe  first  stage  has  three  solid  propellant  booster  rockets.    	Particularly
			    	the  second  stage  uses  N204-A-50  as  a  propellant.    	The  next  rocket  in  line
			    	for  development,  namely  the  N-2  model  capable  of  launching  a  roughly  350-kg
			   	stationary  satellite,   	is  simply  a  scale-up  of  the  N-model.
