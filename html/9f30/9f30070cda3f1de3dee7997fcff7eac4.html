 STUDY HISTORY, DISPLAY PATRIOTIC SPIRIT
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 2-5
 [Article by Wang Zhen [3769 7201]]
 [Text] Editor's note:  Recently Comrade Wang Zhen invited a few comrades
 from the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee, the Research
 Office of the CCP Secretariat and the CYL Central Committee to a discus-
 sion meeting at which he expressed his views on studying the modern
 history of China.   In his talk, Comrade Wang Zhen recommended a new book
 by Hu Chen entitled "From the Opium War to the May 4th Movement," stressing
 the importance of studying modern history and calling on all people to
 promote cadres' and youths' study of history and to boost the upsurge of
 the fine general mood of the society related to book learning, so as to boost
 the people's morale, inspire their fighting will and display the patriotic
 spirit of working hard for the growth of the Chinese nation.  This talk is
 of great significance in promoting among the broad ranks of cadres and youths
 the study of history, the building of socialist spiritual civilization
 and the strengthening of education on patriotism.  We hereby publish the full
 text of it.
 Today, I am going to have a talk with you.
 During the past 2 years, I spent the time when I was recuperating after
 operations by reading a few books on the history of Russia's aggression
 against China,  the biographies of a few historical figures, such as
 "Biography of Sun Yat-sen," "Biography of Lin Zexu," "The Chronicle of
 the Life of Huang Xing" and a biography on Yan Fu's life.  Later I rela-
 tively carefully read a new book by Comrade Hu Chen entitled "From the
 Opium War to the May 4th Movement."  The book contains 27 chapters and a
 total of 700,000 characters.   I originally planned to read it in 2 months,
 but I finished it in 1 1/2 months.   Comrade Hu Chen is a scholar in our
 party and is an old friend of mine.  His book narrates the 80 years of the
 Chinese nation's history of repeated serious disasters and gives a clear
 description of every historical event.   For us who have taken part in the
 struggle when our nation's existence was in peril, we feel ever greater
 pride when we read the history of that period.  Historical books of this
 kind are very useful, especially in educating cadres and youths about

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 history.  Such books will make them understand the history of the imperialists'
 oppression and the Chinese people''s resistance, strengthen their sense of
 patriotism and make them know better why they should support socialism and
 the party's leadership.
 I have had no schooling and little learning.  However, I am quite familiar
 with the history from the Opium War to the May 4th Movement.   The history
 of this period is not only recorded in history books but also spread far
 and wide among the people.  None of my forefathers were scholars either.
 My father was, a farm laborer.   In my childhood, I heard him tell us stories
 about the Taiping army, called "long hair" at that time, who fought against
 the Qing army and stories about Tao Shu, an official of the Qing Dynasty
 (editor's note:  Tao Shu, a native of Anhua County, Hunan Province, was
 appointed governor of Jiangsu, governor of Anhui and viceroy of Liangjiang.)
 I also heard legends about the Hongjiang Hui (Hongjiang River Society),
 the Ge Lao Hui (Society of Brothers).  and other revolutionaries from my
 father.  However, it was not until I joined the revolution that I gained a
 relatively correct understanding of the history of this period.   Chairman Mao
 once told me that Lin Biao had not even the least knowledge of Chinese
 history.  He told me to draw a lesson from Lin Biao and learn some history.
 Therefore, I am very pleased when I read a good history book.
 The China today has been developed from the China of the past.   In the preface
 of his book, Comrade Hu Chen gives a simple outline of the Chinese feudal
 society before the Opium war.  The whole book narrates and analyzes how China
 was reduced, step by step, to a semicolonial and semifeudal country due to
 the aggression of the capitalist powers and narrates and analyzes the
 several upsurges and setbacks in the revolution in China in the time period
 of acentury.  A history book of this kind can be used as a textbook to
 teach people to understand the law governing the development of the Chinese
 history and understand the origin of China's present situation.  Reading
 a history book of this kind can relatively systematically teach people to
 be aware of the difficulties in founding the PRC and, at the same time, help
 us to understand many problems raised in the "Resolution on Certain Questions
 in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC."  For example,
 the question on the evaluation of Chairman Mao.   If we have studied modern
 history and have a complete view of the great changes during the time period
 of little more than a century, we will find that compared with other histori-
 cal figures, Chairman Mao was a statesman of rare gifts and bold strategy,
 of extensive knowledge,.of deep insight and of strong will and a statesman
 who achieved great merits.  We all know that Comrade Chen Yi was a man of
 great talents and that it was difficult for people to win his admiration;
 nevertheless, he said that he did admire Chairman Mao.  Of course, there
 have been quite a few outstanding figures in China's modern history, such
 as Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi and Zhu De, who were all outstanding leaders of
 our party and our people.  Besides, there have been many well-known thinkers,
 politicians and generals and excellent scholars and artists.  We must say that
 without these outstanding historical figures and particularly without
 Chairman Mao, the Chinese nation could not be what it is today.  We should
 not negate Chairman Mao's immortal contributions in Chinese history because

 he committed mistakes during the "Great Cultural Revolution"'  When we have
 read some history books and have got some understanding of China's history
 over the last century, we will naturally and logically affirm Chairman Mao's
 historical position.
 This book by Comrade Hu Chen contains a great amount of materials and makes
 a historical materialist analysis of people and events.  This shows Comrade
 Hu Chen's meticulous scholarship.  We should hold such scholars in respect.
 Regarding China's modern history, there are quite a few books available,
 even when not including this one written by Comrade Hu Chen.  Moreover,
 there is not merely a single area of historical research in all of the
 academic and theoretical circles.  For many years, many comrades have done
 a great deal of hard work in various academic fields and have achieved great
 results.  What they have done is very necessary and very valuable for our
 socialist modernization and for our struggle for world peace.  Any scientific,
 literary or artistic works and any effective creative labor that contribute
 to the four modernizations and contribute to arousing the people's fighting
 will and their patriotism for our great motherland must be affirmed.  Whether
 we have adopted a correct policy in treating our intellectuals and whether
 we have adopted a correct attitude toward the excellent results of mental
 labor and spiritual production is a major issue that concerns the success
 and failure of the socialist cause.  When I was young, I had many contacts
 with intellectuals.  After the May 4th movement, I was a janitor for some
 railway senior clerks.  Because of the ideological influence of the May 4th
 movement and because of the influence of the workers movement, these clerks,
 school-aged children, had changed their attitude toward workers.  They not
 only did not look down upon us workers or treat us as servants, but also
 made friends with us.  The times were progressing and so were the intellectuals.
 I should say that since my first contact with such progressive intellectuals,
 they have made a good impression on me.   In the long-term revolutionary
 struggle since then, I have never committed mistakes related to intellectual
 problems.   Chairman Mao once said to me, "Wang Shiwei would not have been
 killed if he had been in a place in your charge."  Naturally, there have been
 reactionary and bad intellectuals, but their number has been small.
 My purpose in inviting you to come here today is to recommend Comrade Hu Chen's
 history book and to propose to you that our cadres and youths should read
 some books about China's modern history.  We all keenly feel that our social
 morality has been much corrupted since the "Great Cultural Revolution."  Our
 party has done a great deal of work in order to change this situation.
 Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech on the adherence to the four basic principles
 and Comrade Ye Jianying's speech at the 30th anniversary of the founding of
 the PRC contributed to bringing about such a change.   The "Resolution on
 Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the
 PRC" approved by the party's sixth plenary session, Comrade Hu Yaobang's
 speeches at the 60th anniversary of the founding of the party, at Lu Xun's
 100th birthday and at the 70th anniversary of the 1911 revolution, and
 Comrade Zhao Ziyang's report concerning the 10 principles for economic construc-
 tion also contributed to bringing about such a change.   In order to bring
 about such a change, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the CYL Central
 Committee, the All-China Women's Federation and other organizations have put

 forth the "five stresses" and "four points of beauty" and the PLAhgs raised the
 call for "four haves, three stresses and two nonapprehensions" [having
 lofty ideas, good morality, knowledge and good health; stressing the army's
 standard on appearance and bearing, good manners and good discipline and
 not being apprehensive about either hardship or bloodshed and sacrifice].
 By all the above and in addition to the PLA's Fakashan and Koulinshan
 battles for national defense and against the Vietnamese aggressors, by the
 heroic struggle against floods and drought in many provinces and areas last
 year, by the arduous efforts made by the public security and judicial
 departments in order to safeguard public security, by achieving great results
 on the agricultural front and in all the sectors which make up the economic
 front, by making tremendous progress in scientific, educational, cultural,
 hygiene and sport fields and by opening up a new situation on diplomatic
 front, we are displaying our nation's heroism and revolutionary spirit.  A
 nation must have its own healthy national trend which constitutes a great
 strength in uniting the masses and encouraging everybody to actively make
 progress.  Comrade Hu Yaobang said that he particularly upheld livening
 things up and inspiring and developing our national spirit and morality. A
 good national spirit and a good national morality marks the prosperity of
 a nation.  Encouraging book learning and establishing a good style of study
 will open up a path for establishing a good national spirit and a good
 national morality.  We should guide our broad ranks of cadres and youths
 to study hard, and that includes studying history.  One usually has some
 leisure time after 8 hours of work, labor or study.  We should teach people
 to spend more of their leisure time in reading instead of taking part in
 recreational activities, and thus create a new social mood of book learning
 and a new social trend of study.  Ours is a socialist country.   In this
 country, unhealthy trends in whatever form are not allowed to run rampant,
 to pollute the society, to corrupt the people's morality or to hinder our
 four modernizations.  We should mobilize the whole party and the whole people
 to pay attention to encouraging the practice of studying, especially to paying
 attention to the studying by youths.  The CYL, the trade unions, the women's
 federations and all other social organizations should strive, under the
 leadership of the party, to promote a new upsurge in the practice of studying.
 As Lenin pointed out, "First, study; second, study and third, study."  This
 will remain a slogan that we will lay great stress on.
 We should learn modern science and technology and, at the same time, we should
 learn the social sciences including history.  We should not forget the arduous
 course our nation has undergone and we should not forget our past.   In the
 past, our country was a semicolony divided up at will by other countries.
 But today our status has been greatly changed.  For example, in Comrade Hu Chen's
 boo, he mentioned the fact that a few imperialist powers scrambled for the
 right to build railways in China.  Today, we not only have the full
 sovereignty in building railways, but also have a strong technical capacity in
 this respect including hundreds of thousands of railway corpsmen.   I was
 once commander in chief of the PLA Railway Corps and, at that time, I was
 opposed to situating our headquarters in Beijing..  Comrade Peng Dehuai agreed
 with my view and said to me that we should build our railway up the Himalayas

 completely taken its destiny into its hands and has not only gained inde-
 pendence in deciding its own policies, but is also having political,
 economic and cultural contacts with various countries and nations in the
 world on the basis of the principle of equality and mutual benefit.  More-
 over, we are playing our role in the just cause of world peace and human
 progress.
 The enemies at home and abroad caused grave disasters to the Chinese people.
 Could there have been such a new situation as today if the Chinese people
 of all nationalities had failed to carry out their prolonged brave struggle,
 if they had failed to firmly unite or if they had failed to display their
 great national heroism and patriotism of striving for the prosperity which
 has been forged through struggle?  Today we have raised our magnificent
 target of realizing socialist modernization and have charted a path for
 socialist modernization that suits the national conditions of our country.
 The strong response this target has aroused from our people has proved that
 there has been a profound objective basis that underlies this national
 spirit.  We can completely affirm that our socialist system will certainly
 be able to develop the Chinese national spirit to an ever-higher standard.
 Of course, in our country, besides the sabotage activities of counterrevolu-
 tionaries and various kinds of criminals, there are still quite a few
 corrupt, backward and unreasonable practices.  These include graft, embezzle-
 ment, smuggling, speculation, bribery, confiscating public property for
 personal use and other activities that violate laws or discipline.  They
 also include unhealthy practices, such as superstition, gambling, extravagant
 weddings and funerals, worshiping-;and having blind faith in things foreign,
 under-the-counter relationships and. using one's official position to achieve
 private ends.  There are also the bureaucratic phenomena of organizations
 being overstaffed, shirking responsibility and having low work efficiency.
 Some people employed in natural scientific undertakings have nothing to do,
 but on the other hand, people are loudly complaining that they lack scientific
 personnel.  All these phenomena must be changed or brought to an end.  Never-
 theless, these phenomena are not something to be feared or to be disappointed
 about, for our party is resolutely and unswervingly fighting against such
 phenomena and is making progress in the course of fighting against these
 phenomena.
 The progress of modern China's history is the best evidence that we will
 certainly be victorious in our struggle.  That is why we should encourage
 the study of history; especially China's modern history.   In analyzing
 historical personalities, we should avoid simplicity and one-sidedness.
 Generally speaking, officials in a feudal society oppressed the people.
 But regarding specific persons we should not fail to see that they differed:
 some were hard working and others lazy, some were good and others bad and
 some were corrupt and others honest.   Some officials were incompetent and,
 in addition to their high salaries, seized land, exploited the people,
 extracted extra levies and led extravagant and lewd lives.  But there were
 others who had some insight and had achieved some merits.  For example, in
 the Han Dynasty, we had heroes such as Zhangqian and Banchao, and in modern

 times, we had such national heroes as Lin Zexu, Feng Zicai and Deng Shichang.
 Even a personality such as Zuo Zongtang should be concretely analyzed.   On
 the one hand, he committed the crimes of suppressing the people, but on the
 other hand, in his later years, he contributed to our nation and country
 by defending China's sovereignty and territory, safeguarding China's unity
 and resisting the expansion of Britain and Russia.  We should make con-
 crete analyses of-historical personalities and should even affirm the
 outstanding roles of some personalities of the ruling classes.  This is
 by no means contradictory to the thesis that history is created by the people.
 Chairman Mao in a speech at Yanan said that we should not only know the China
 of today but also the China of yesterday.  He called on us to study the
 present situation as well as history and Marxist theory.   This call is
 even more important for today's youths.  I believe that by conscientiously
 reading, by making reading a constant practice so as to be armed with the
 weapons of social sciences and the science of history, our youths will not
 only increase their knowledge, talents and competency, but can also firm up
 their confidence in the revolution and set high aims and lofty aspirations.
 Of course, whatever subjects our youths choose to major in, we should encourage
 and support them.  However, through the study of history, our youths will
 see that it was owing to the undaunted and heroic struggle of our great
 people and their bravery in the face of bloodshed and death that our country
 has survived so many national disasters and so many aggressors.   In this
 course, we had undergone innumerable failures and setbacks until we finally
 found Marxism, set up the CCP, led the people to overthrow the three great
 mountains and founded the PRC.  This took us more than a century to achieve.
 We should treasure what we have achieved and strive for prosperity on the
 basis of what we have achieved.
 Only by intensifying their study will our youths be able to be devoted to
 their work and to have a sense of responsibility.  Not only the youths who
 major in social sciences should study history, but those who major in natural
 sciences should also study history.  Youths who pursue whatever profession
 should learn something of history.  Stalin said that a Leninist should not
 be a specialist only in the subject of a science he likes,; he should, at the
 same time, be a politician and a social activist and he should concern
 himself with the destiny of his country, understand and know how to make good
 use of the laws governing the development of society and do his best to take
 an active part in the political leadership of his country.  For this, one
 should study Marxist theory and study history.  We should conduct education
 in history and in patriotism among the youths in a better, more flexible
 and more lively manner.  Naturally, in order to build socialism and make
 China prosper, we must study and strive to master and introduce foreign
 advanced science, technology and management and, moreover, we must study
 them for our socialist motherland and must resolutely fight against the
 disgraceful practice of worshiping and having blind faith in things foreign.
 It is necessary for an old, weak man like me to resign all his posts and
 retire from his office.  Though retired, a man like me can find some work
 he is capable of doing.  As an old CCP member, one should do what one should
 do.   In this sense, no official titles or authorization are needed.  Maybe

 what is left of my life are only a few months or days, but as long as I can,
 I will go around, look around and do the present urgent task of training
 successors. For example, I will take up the task of working with youths,
 such as guiding them in the study of history.  This is a very important task.
 My aim in having you talk with me today is that you will boost the study
 drive to a new upsurge.  I hope that I can do, together with other retired
 old comrades, what we can do in our remaining years.  Old comrades can
 draw on rich experience.   Some of them are experts in some special fields,
 for example, some of them have some special technical or academic knowledge,
 some have good penmanship and some are skilled in painting.  They are all
 precious wealth of our party.  Though owing to their health they cannot be
 engaged in the busy posts in the first line, they can use what they are good
 at in training the coming generation and play their role to the full in
 building the socialist spiritual civilization throughout the country.  The
 world is vast.  As far back as in the Eastern Han Dynasty, Ma Yuan said, "A
 man who dies in the border area and whose body is wrapped in horse hide
 should be carried back to be buried in his homeland.  How can he die in
 the arms of a woman?"  Today, we need not wrap our bodies in horse hide
 nor be buried in our homeland.  As long as our health permits, we must regard
 the vast world as our home and never should we madly cling to Beijing and
 other big cities.
 I believe that so long as the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Commit-
 tee and the Central Committee of the CYL take the lead, so long as the old
 generation, and that includes me, goes all out to make more efforts, so
 long as scholars like Comrade Hu Chen carry out their studies and research,
 and so long as the many specialists in the theoretical circle and our colleges
 in the arts play their roles to the full and jointly promote as one the
 book learning of our youths, we are sure that we can set the fine style of
 study and the healthy trend in our society.

 ACQUIRE A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF GUIDING THOUGHT CONCERNING CORRECT
 RURAL WORK
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 6-10
 [Article by Chen Pixian [7115 0012 7309]]
 [Text]   In the past few years, like other rural areas of the country, the
 countryside of Hubei has all along witnessed a very favorable situation.
 Fast progress has been achieved.  This has been a source of great inspira-
 tion.                       But amid progress, certain new conditions and new problems have
 appeared.   This requires us to further understand guiding thought con-
 cerning rural work.  Otherwise, the development of the very favorable
 situation in the countryside is likely to suffer.
 What is the guiding thought that we must further understand in our current
 rural work?  Generally speaking, we must further properly handle the rela-
 tions among the state, the collective and the individual; insist on taking
 the planned economy as the primary factor and regulation by market mechanism
 as the secondary one; direct peasants' enthusiasm toward the study of agri-
 cultural science and technology; the proper introduction of scientific farm-
 ing and the improvement of management and operations; blaze a new trail of
 overall development and attention to economic results; do a better job in
 increasing agricultural yields and income; and make the countryside get rich
 in a. gradual and healthy manner.  All this we must do in the process of
 continuously carrying out a series of economic policies in the countryside
 introduced since the 3d Plennary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee
 and in the process of steadily perfecting the production responsibility
 system.   Under the guidance of national plans, we must lead the masses of
 peasants in an effort to develop production and tap the potential in their
 own enterprises.  We cannot always look to the higher levels and count on
 the state to give the peasants more benefits at present by further raising
 purchase prices.  In this respect, we must have unified awareness.  We must
 make the countryside rich but this should be achieved in a healthy manner.
 Can we get rich by allowing the peasants to act as they please and to take
 expedient measures that are of benefit only to themselves?  No.  This would
 only interfere with national plans and impair the overall interests of the
 country, thus injuring the peasants' fundamental interests.   Can we just
 rely on the state to make the peasants rich?  No.  This is because the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 existing resources of the state are limited.   Prices for agricultural pro-
 ducts have in the past few years been raised greatly and much has been
 done with regard to agricultural subsidies.  Therefore, we must insist on
 taking planned economy as the primary factor and regulation by market forces
 as the secondary one, and integrate the interests of the state, the collec-
 tive and the individual.  Only in this way can we achieve the aim of getting
 rich in a healthy manner.
 Agricultural production for Hubei Province last year, generally speaking, was
 satisfactory.   It was a year that can be considered far better than the
 average.  Output of grain, cotton, edible oil and agricultural and sideline
 products in the second and third categories, except for live pigs, rose
 compared with the preceding year.  The province's diversified economy
 registered relatively fast growth.  There was also relatively great progress
 in developing communes' family sidelines.  Peasants' income chalked up a
 general increase.  However, some time ago, the business of purchasing and
 turning over agricultural and sideline products to the state was not done
 well enough in some respects.   1) Everyone reported an increase in grain
 output, and there was really a big increase in some cases.  But when it came
 to the purchase and marketing of grain, there was always a demand for pur-
 chasing less and selling more on the market.  2) There were increases in
 second and third category agricultural and sideline products, in regard to
 both output and purchases.  But the job of turning over products to the
 state was not done well enough.  There was a demand for turning over more
 of what is unsalable to the state or keeping less of it, and a demand for
 turning over less of what is salable to the state or keeping more of it.
 3) Where there had been a drop in the number of live pigs, state purchases,
 or sales to the state, showed a still poorer record.  There were many causes
 for this situation, both objective and subjective.  There was the problem of
 inadequate attention having been paid to work and a display of laxity and
 weakness on the part of the leadership.  There was also the problem of
 certain people having a weak sense of planning and a weak concept of viewing
 the situation as a whole and not acting according to state plans.
 This situation appears to be a concrete problem concerning the matter of
 purchasing and turning over agricultural and sideline products to the state.
 Actually, it is a problem of guiding thought concerning our current rural
 work.  The core of it is how to properly treat the relations among the
 state, the collective and the individual.   In a speech at a conference marking
 the centenary of the birth of Lu Xun, Comrade Hu Yaobang said: "In certain
 departments and, primarily, in economic departments, some comrades lack a
 concept of viewing the situation as a whole.  Anything that does not serve
 their partial interests or appeal to their own taste is shunned or not acted
 upon.   This is a wrong departmental act injurious to the overall interests
 of the state."  Comrade Hu Yaobang also pointed out:   "Among the cadres of
 certain industrial and mining enterprises and' certain rural communes and
 brigades, the practice of acting against the concept of viewing the situation
 as a whole and taking the interests of the state, the collective and the
 individual into consideration--a concept hitherto advocated by the party
 and the state--and the practice of flaunting the banner of acting in the
 interests of the masses actually represents a backward idea among some workers

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 and peasants.  At the first opportunity, they make claims upon the state
 and demand a high price.  This is a wrong act injurious to state interests."
 Comrade Hu Yaobang's speech tells us that we must thoroughly implement the
 guideline of paying simultaneous attention to the interest of the state,
 the collective and the individual.  We must conduct relevant education among
 the cadres and the masses.  We cannot one-sidedly stress individual interests,
 to the neglect of state and collective interests.  Between September and
 October last year, we began to take note of the problem of purchasing and
 turning over agricultural and sideline products to the state, and directed
 quite an effort to this matter.   In November, we again emphasized discussing
 the problem of simultaneous attention to the interests of all three sides
 at meetings of secretaries of prefectual and municipal party committees,
 and succeeded in raising awareness.  After such meetings, the whole province
 upheld this spirit.  The situation quickly turned for the better, as far
 as the matter of purchasing and turning over products to the state was
 concerned.   At the end of last year, purchase quotas for grain and oil seeds
 were overfulfilled.  The pace of purchasing cotton lived up to expectations.
 The number of live pigs purchased and turned over to the state showed a big
 increase compared to before November.  Facts show that so long as we have
 a clear idea of guiding thought, the masses of cadres and people in the
 countryside will support us.  Of course, we have now only raised the level
 of thinking and awareness initially.   In future, we must conduct education
 in a penetrating and sustained manner, enabling such guiding thought to
 permeate all the province's rural work.
 In the past several years, our country chiefly relied upon three ways to re-
 vive and develop our agriculture:   1) correcting "leftist" mistakes and
 relaxing restrictions; 2) raising the prices of agricultural and subsidiary
 products; 3) importing a given quantity of grain every year.   These three
 policies were aimed at arousing the peasants' enthusiasm, developing a
 diversified economy, raising the commodity rate and enlivening the rural
 economy.  As far as the future is concerned,  the first must be adhered to.
 In no way can we relax attention to grain production and the energetic
 development of a diversified economy.  Various versions of the production
 responsibility system and such practices as keeping private plots, promoting
 family sidelines, holding country fairs, and so forth must not be changed.
 The third policy of importing grain must also be continuously carried out
 within given limits, so as to facilitate the readjustment of the structure
 of agricultural production.  As to the second policy, the prices for
 agricultural and sideline products must be basically stabilized and cannot
 be further raised.   In the past few years, the state has spent much on
 subsidies for raising the prices of agricultural and sideline products,
 for selling prices, and on subsidies for the prices of imported grain, cotton,
 sugar, and so forth.  This is entirely necessary.  But at present, the
 state cannot afford to further raise purchase prices and subsidies.   If we
 just raise the prices of agricultural and sideline products without a great
 development in industrial production, and if we thus fail to satisfy the
 peasants' demand for industrial goods and cannot withdraw currency from
 circulation in a normal manner, this will not help stabilize the prices of
 industrial products.  What benefits the peasants derive from the state will
 also end up being lost.   Therefore, given the existing resources of our state
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 and the level of industrial production, a further big increase in the prices
 for agricultural and sideline products is unrealistic.   In improving the
 living standard of the peasants in future, we must not chiefly rely on
 raising the prices for agricultural and sideline products.  Instead, we
 must rely on policy and science in the overall development of agriculture,
 forestry, animal husbandry, sidelines and fishing.  We must thus energeti-
 cally raise the commodity rate and improve economic results.  In this respect,
 guiding thought is very important.   If the matter of guiding thought is not
 properly taken care of, problems will arise in purchasing and turning over
 agricultural and sideline products to the state.  If what should be purchased
 is not procured and what should be turned over to the state is not handed
 over, this will directly affect industrial production and affect the-life of
 urban residents, the worker-peasant alliance and even the economic construc-
 tion of the state as a whole.   Therefore, we must strengthen socialist and
 patriotic education among rural cadres and commune members, so that they can
 understand the great importance of paying simultaneous attention to tri-
 partite [state-collective-individual] interests, consciously make greater
 contributions to the state, strive to fulfill state plans and support cities,
 industry, export promotion and socialist construction.
 It should also be noted that if our guiding thought concerning rural work is
 not correct,  the development of agricultural production itself will suffer.
 For example, regarding the cultivated area, we must stress the need of
 guidance from state plans.  On this basis, we must bear local features in
 mind and make rational arrangements for the distribution of crops.  As far
 as the area sown to grain is concerned, the province had 83.17 million mu
 in 1978:and 79.01 million mu last year, a drop of 4.16 million mu.  Such a
 readjustment, generally speaking, is rational.   But it must also be noted
 that the sown area must not be further reduced.   Given not a big increase in
 per mu output, an excessive reduction in the total area sown will affect
 the total output of grain.  Also, the area sown to cotton must also be kept
 at a steady level.  Another problem is'a serious situation of good land
 being occupied to build rural housing.  According to incomplete statistics,
 the communes and brigades throughout the province have occupied a total of
 1.65 million mu of land for building housing since 1970.  For a commune in
 a certain county, the area occupied for building housing averaged nearly
 2 mu per household.  This was 8 times the 0.25 mu for a general residential
 unit.  We must pay great attention to this problem.  We must set great store
 by every inch of land.  We must strengthen education and inspection and
 strictly act according to regulations laid down by the State Council and
 the provincial people's government.  We must change the situation of freely
 occupying and using cultivated land.  The situation of freely appropriating
 vegetable fields in urban construction is also very common and must be
 brought under strict control.  Also, we must perfect the production
 responsibility system.  One of the important principles to be followed in
 this.regard is that the responsibility system must embody and contribute
 toward the proper handling of the relations among the state,  the collective
 and the individual.  We must pay particular attention to guarding against
 and resolutely overcoming the erroneous practice of distorting the produc-
 tion responsibility system and destroying and occupying collective property.

 The problems mentioned above have a bearing on the correct handling of the
 relations among the state, the collective and the individual.   Since the
 third plenary session, we have corrected "leftist" mistakes in the country-
 side, turned chaos into order, introduced a policy of relaxing restrictions
 and enlivened the economy.  This guideline is entirely correct.  In the
 future, we must continue to firmly and unswervingly carry out our party's
 various economic policies toward the countryside and further perfect various
 versions of the production responsibility system.  In certain fields, such
 as the area of circulation, we must further study policies and measures
 for better handling rural commerce.  The problem at present is by no means
 one of changing policy or retracing the old road toward rigid control.
 Instead, the problem is to realistically carry out the guideline of taking
 planned economy as the primary factor and regulation by market mechanism as
 the secondary one and to flexibly use:the market as a regulation factor
 within the limits of a planned economy.  This is to say that what should be
 controlled should be realistically controlled.  What should be enlivened
 should be persistently enlivened.  We should never freely make changes.
 At present, we must resolutely overcome anarchism, departmen.talism and the
 erroneous viewpoint of one-sidedly stressing mass interests.  Within the limits
 of planned economy, we must enliven the economy in a more healthy manner.  We
 must correctly handle the relations among the state, the collective and the
 individual, divert peasants' attention to the development of production and
 the tapping of the potential in.given enterprises.  We must direct energetic
 efforts toward scientific farming and the improvement of management and
 operations.  The earlier this guiding thought is made clear and the more
 conscious we are, the greater initiative we will have in our work.  Otherwise,
 our leadership over rural work will be marked by laxity and weakness, hampering
 the healthy growth of the rural economy.
 As far as the existing actual conditions of the countryside of Hubei Province
 are concerned in light of this guiding thought, several important problems
 must be put forth for discussion and study.
 1.   Planned cultivation.   In guiding agricultural production,.we must respect
 the autonomy of the production team, so that it can, with local features in
 mind, properly arrange for the distribution of crops and act according to
 objective laws.  This is a prerequisite for the proper handling of agricul-
 tural production.  But we must also be guided by state plans.  This principle
 must not be given up.    State plans are based on the actual conditions of the
 country as a whole.  We must integrate different conditions, as far as both
 the whole and parts are concerned.  Only in this way can we really get down
 to earth.   In arranging for grain production, we must take into consideration
 the needs of the whole province and the whole country and must guarantee a
 sown area of 80 million mu.  As to cotton, we must likewise consider the needs
 of the whole province and the whole country and guarantee a sown area of
 8.5 million mu.  We must make plans after discussions among cadres and the
 masses and see to their firm implementation at every level.  We must also
 strengthen planned guidance concerning other economic crops and multiple
 undertakings, especially certain principal items of production.  This is to
 avoid doing things blindly, submitting conflicting reports about production
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 figures, effecting sudden big changes and thus causing great economic losses
 to the state and peasants.  Therefore, we must strive to do a proper job of
 forecasting economic development.  We must make forecasts item by item, con-
 cerning the social demand for certain main products and the relevant pro-
 duction capacity.  This will provide a scientific basis for drawing up plans
 and guiding production.
 2.   Purchase and sale of grain.   In the future, we must continue to intensify
 our efforts toward grain work and cannot relax our efforts.  Concretely
 speaking, we must keep the cultivated area at a steady level, as far as
 production is concerned.  We must pay primary attention to per mu production
 and an increase in total output.   In regard to distribution, we must adhere
 to the policy of planned purchase and marketing by the state.  We can in no
 way show the least hesitation for that matter.  Nor can we rely upon in-
 creasing purchases obtained as a result of negotiations and reducing planned
 purchases to solve the food problem.   It should be clear that planned pur-
 chase and marketing by the state is a fundamental policy in our distribution
 of grain.   Given a continuous development of production, we must properly
 increase purchases and rationally control sales, fulfilling quotas for pro-
 ducts turned over to the state and adding gradually to stocks in reserve year
 after year.   Thus, the aim of a balanced budget and a surplus can be achieved.
 3.   The purchase and transfer of second and third category agricultural and
 sideline products to the state.  According to the stipulations of the State
 Council, the general principle should be that we insist on taking planned
 economy as the main factor and regulation by market mechanism as the
 secondary one; pay simultaneous attention to the interests of the state,  the
 collective and the individual and coordinate the autonomy of the production
 team, the peasants' initiative and the requirements for the state's planned
 economy; and correctly handle the relations between the state and the
 peasants, between the central and local areas and between the producing
 area and the area where sales are effected.  This is to facilitate the
 readjustment of the national economy, further develop production, and enliven
 the economy.  The leadership at all levels must exercise supervision and
 make inspections.   Those products that should be turned over to the state
 must be turned over, with both quantity and quality requirements guaranteed
 and with the fulfillment of the quota resolutely guaranteed.
 4.   The problem of live pigs.   Pork in Hubei Province is in relatively short
 supply.  On the one hand, the increased income of urban and rural residents
 h,js resulted in a great demand for pork.  On the other,  there was a drop in
 the province's figures last year for live pigs raised, purchased and turned
 over to the state.  There were many causes for the drop in the number of live
 pigs raised, purchased and turned over to the state.   Two years ago, Hubei
 Province experienced an unusually serious flood disaster which caused a sharp
 drop in grain production.  This was an important factor.    But we cannot simply
 blame everything on this one factor.  With the introduction of the responsi-
 bility system in the countryside, new measures for encouraging pig breeding
 and the fulfillment of purchase quotas were not carried out in time.  This
 was also one important factor.  Therefore, to basically solve the problem
 of live pigs, we must stress doing our work well in the following two respects.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 a.  We strive to guarantee the normal supply of pork to meet urban needs.
 This is an important problem concerning the life of urban residents.  We
 must constantly conduct education among cadres and peasants, so that they
 can strengthen the concept of the state and the concept of viewing the
 situation as a whole and ensure the fulfillment of quotas for products
 turned over to the state.   The city, for its part, must also strengthen
 control over the supply of pork and achieve the aim of making rational
 arrangements for supply.
 b.  From now on, we must direct vigorous efforts toward pig breeding and
 bring about a big increase in the number of live pigs raised this year.
 Party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen leadership.
 We must devote considerable efforts and several meetings a year to the study
 of a solution to the problem of breeding, purchasing and turning over live
 pigs to the state.  We must realistically draw up plans for the breeding of
 live pigs and adapt ourselves to such practices as basing remuneration on
 output, with each laborer and each household held responsible--practices
 followed since the introduction. of the production responsibility system.
 We must see to it that purchase quotas are duly fulfilled by each household.
 We must conduct education among rural cadres and commune members, so that
 they can understand that the fulfillment of purchase quotas is a proper
 contribution to the state.
 We must continuously carry out the guideline of combining collective and
 private pig breeding with the main emphasis on the latter.  We must seriously
 carry out the party's policy of encouraging private pig breeding among commune
 members.  We must encourage raising as many pigs as we can and refrain from
 obstructing the pig-breeding effort or limiting the number raised.  We must
 pay particular attention to taking good care of those households that con-
 centrate on pig breeding or specialize in the effort.   The "responsibility
 plot" fixed must be allowed to stay on a stable basis, so that the commune
 members can stop worrying and display enthusiasm in raising pigs and collect-
 ing and applying manure.  Meanwhile, we must advocate the collective raising
 of sows and the breeding of piglets by the production team, so that the
 source of pigs can remain stable and the species can be improved upon.   Every
 effort must be made so that we can independently breed and raise pigs ourselves.
 Collective pig breeding must also be guided by a contract or responsibility
 system, with the team, the household or the individual held responsible.
 We must firmly carry out the policy concerning fodder.   In raising pigs, we
 must use various kinds of fodder.  But we cannot do without a fixed main kind
 of fodder.  We must understand the principle "the more pigs raised, the more
 manure and the more grain."  On the surface, it seems that raising pigs calls
 for more grain.  Actually, by raising pigs, more manure is made available.
 This in turn leads to a greater output of grain.   In solving the fodder prob-
 lem, not only must the production team contribute a little collectively but
 the state must contribute a little.   Fodder is sold to pig-breeding house-
 holds at special prices fixed by the state, so that the peasants can profit
 by raising and selling pigs.  Peasants must take care of the state's needs

 and interests.   The state for its part, must also take care of the. peasants'
 rational interests.  The interests of all three sides must be really.. taken
 care of. Only in this way can pig breeding be developed.
 We must also improve management and operations in purchasing live pigs.   The
 commercial departments must energetically support the development of pig
 breeding and give the masses every convenience in selling pigs.   In the
 season when fat pigs can be taken out of the pen for sale, we should never
 repeat the previous practice of stopping collection and limiting the number
 purchased.  Meanwhile, we must strengthen control and take immediate action
 to stop the sale of pork by unlicensed vendors in the market.  Licensed
 vendors can also only deal in the pork that the peasants keep for themselves.
 5.   The problem of vegetables.   In the past few years, various cities in
 Hubei Province have attached importance to vegetable production and have
 achieved some results.  A trend toward growth has marked the variety and output
 of vegetables.  The problem now is that things sometimes improve and sometimes
 deteriorate.  Market supplies are unbalanced.  Prices of vegetables traded
 at country fairs are often relatively high.   The masses have much to complain
 about.  The supply of vegetables represents a major event in the life of urban
 residents and concerns millions of households.   Therefore, we must pay adequate
 attention to this work.  We must adhere to the guideline of calling for the
 suburbs of a city to concentrate on vegetables in its agricultural production.
 The area planted to vegetables must be put on a fixed basis.  A protected
 vegetable area must be defined and kept from being appropriated.  Those fields
 not belonging to the protected area must also be subjected to strict control
 and properly treated, if they should be appropriated.  All vegetable teams
 must resolutely uphold the principle of "basing output on needs and producing
 slightly more than is sold."  Under the guidance of state plans, they must
 introduce the economic contract system and strictly fulfill contracts,
 giving awards for those performing well and imposing economic sanctions on
 those violating a contract.  They must do well in planned production (including
 planned variety), planned marketing and planned pricing.  No matter what
 the version of the production responsibility system introduced, the vegetable
 teams must help with planned production and planned marketing.   They should
 also improve the control and handling of vegetables, introduce the commercial
 operation responsibility system, overcome the idea of eating out of a "big
 pot," gradually improve operating conditions, cut losses and waste, reduce
 costs and improve economic results.
 6.  The base taken for products purchased and turned over to the state.
 How should we pay simultaneous attention to tripartite interests in pur-
 chasing and turning over agricultural and sideline products to the state?
 It seems that fixing a base and letting it stand for several years at a time
 is a relatively satisfactory method.   There has been a base for planned
 state grain purchases.  This has produced a good effect.  Now some areas
 report that the masses hope that a base should also be fixed for purchases
 exceeding given quotas--a base that should not be discussed yearly.  This
 approach is worth consideration.  Not only grain but also agricultural and
 sideline products--products where conditions permit--can also be provided

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 with a fixed base for planned state purchases or allotted purchases.  This
 base must be firmly upheld not only at the production team level but at the
 household level.  Only in this way can we adapt ourselves to new conditions
 arising after the introduction of the responsibility system with output link-
 ed to labor and to each household.  There is also the problem of turning
 over products to the state.  Where conditions permit, we should also adopt
 the method of fixing a base.   Concerning what exceeds a given quota for
 second category agricultural and sideline products turned over to the
 state--products that sell well--we may adopt the method of fixing proper
 proportions for distribution.  Of course, when it comes to a fixed base
 in concrete practice, there are many complicated problems calling for serious
 study and rational solution.
 We must acquire a clearer idea of guiding thought concerning current rural
 work.  We must set straight the relations among the state, the collective
 and the individual.  We must first of all properly solve ideological problems
 within the party and rectify the party's work style.  Our party represents
 the interests of the people.   It must not only show concern for the immediate
 and partial interests of the people but also take care of their long-term
 and fundamental interests.  It must unify interests in these two respects.
 However, at present, some cadres do not understand that only on the basis
 of developing production can we gradually improve the living standard of the
 people.   Instead, they fix their eyes on the state thinking that only with
 money from the state can something be done for the people.   Some turn to the
 state for help under the signboard of showing concern for the interests of
 the people.   Some act against the interests of the state and the collective
 and one-sidedly stress individual interests.  Some even abuse their authority
 to serve private ends.  Other similar cases may be cited.   The party
 organizations in some areas have failed to persistently conduct socialist
 and patriotic education.   They have lacked the courage to criticize erroneous
 ideas and to fight unhealthy, practices.   This has reflected laxity and
 weakness on the part of the leadership.    Therefore, the party organizations
 at all levels of the province must seriously study the spirit of "Comrade
 Deng Xiaoping's speech on rectifying the party work style," Comrade Chen Yun's
 "Tell the Truth, Do Not Save Face," and the central forum on problems on
 the ideological front.   They must put rectifying the party's work style
 and strengthening ideological leadership high on the party committee's
 agenda.   So long as those within the party have a clearer idea of the guid-
 ing thought concerning current rural work and rectify the party's work
 style, we can surely lead the masses of cadres and people of the countryside
 of the whole province in scoring still greater achievements in socialist
 construction and making proper contributions toward rejuvenating China.

 THE PROGRESSIVE FORCES ARE BOUND TO TRIUMPH OVER THE DECADENT FORCES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 11-12
 [Ideological commentary by Shi Jian [0670 6015]]
 [Text]  Over 5 years ago, our party carried out the people's will by smash-
 ing the counterrevolutionary clique of the "gang of four," which had com-
 mitted countless crimes and deserved to be brought to judgment.   This was
 a great victory of historic significance for the progressive forces over
 the decadent forces in China's socialist period.   Since the downfall of
 the "gang of four," especially since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th
 CCP Central Committee, our party has led the people in bringing order
 out of chaos on various fronts.  Thus our country has become stable, the
 people are united, production has developed and an excellent situation, the
 likes of which have not been seen since the 1960's, has emerged.  The broad
 masses of people and some people of insight abroad unanimously have praised
 this excellent situation.  However, there are still a small number of
 people in our ranks who are perplexed ideologically and who are beset with
 worries that the "gang of four" will "rise again" and "stage a comeback."
 This reflects their lack of confidence in the ability of our party to lead
 the people in the drive to accomplish the four modernizations as well as
 their insufficient understanding of the law of historical development.
 According to the viewpoint of a historical materialist, human history in-
 variably develops in a way in which the progressive forces are bound to
 triumph over the decadent forces and the newly emerging classes are bound
 to replace the declining classes.   This is an objective law independent of
 man's will.   Engels said: "In the course of development, all that was pre-
 viously real becomes unreal, loses its necessity, its right of existence,
 its rationality.  And in the place of moribund reality comes a new, viable
 reality."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," vol 4, p 212)  Has not
 all human history developed in this way?  The slave-owning class and the
 landlord class were a reality in history, but what happened to them?  With
 the development of history, the newly emerging landlord class triumphed
 over the decadent slave-owning class and the newly emerging bourgeoisie
 triumphed over the decadent landlord class.   The capitalist system is

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 likewise a "reality," but it will eventually become "unreal" and the
 socialist system will eventually replace the capitalist system.  This change
 has become an important modern historical process.  From the end of the
 1920's to the 1940's, Chiang Kai-shek ruled over the country.  He command-
 ed massive forces and, with a butcher's knife in one hand and a murderous
 look on his face, itched to wipe out all of the revolutionary and progres-
 sive forces overnight.  However, after 22 years of bloody battles, our
 party led the Chinese people in eventually defeating the most reactionary
 and decadent force in China's modern history.  That the revolutionary and
 pro gress.ive forces should succeed in vanquishing the decadent forces is,
 fundamentally speaking, due to the fact that the former conforms to the
 historical trend of the times and reflects the interests and demands of
 the people while the latter goes against the trend of the times and
 violates the interests and will of the people.
 Naturally, the developments of history do not follow a straight line but
 have their twists and turns.   In the course of historical development, as
 a result of the decadent forces being temporarily stronger than the
 progressive forces or the leaders of the progressive forces committing
 serious mistakes of line, it often occurs that the progressive forces
 suffer setbacks or even defeats.  With respect to the emergence of this
 tragedy in history, we must be good at seeing through appearances to get at
 the essence and not be misled by false impressions.  The defeat of the
 progressive forces and the decadent forces holding; the upper hand can only
 be temporary phenomena which will. never last long.  "A bad experience is
 the best teacher."  So long as the progressive forces conscientiously sum
 up and draw experiences and lessons and rally their forces, it is not only
 possible but also unavoidable for. them to "rise again" and "stage a comeback."
 Here we call to mind an interesting argument in ancient China.  Over 2 cen-
 turies B.C., Xiang Yu who was known as the "conquerer of Western Chu" was
 defeated by Liu Bang who was born to a petty official family.  Xiang Yu
 did not have the face to meet the elders and brethren east of the Chang
 Jiangandso committed suicide by cutting his throat.:by the Wu Jiang.  A
 lot of comrades know of this historical event.  Over 1,000 years later, a
 poet of the Tang Dynasty, Du Mu, and a politician of the Song Dynasty,
 Wang Anshi, held two diametrically different views on this historical event.
 Du Mu wrote a poem entitled "An Inscription on the Wu Jiang Pavillion,"
 expressing his sorrow for Xiang Yu who committed suicide at the Wu Jiang
 pavillion.   The poem read:   "For a military commander, winning or losing a
 battle is a common occurrence that is often unexpected; it is in the nature
 of a man to bear shame and humiliation.   There were a lot of talented persons
 among the elders and brethren east of the Chang Jiang; who knows?  One
 could stage a comeback some day."  According to Du Mu, Xiang Yu should not
 have committed suicide.  There were a lot of talented persons east of the
 Chang Jiang.   If he had not committed suicide, he could have returned to
 the east of the Chang Jiang and recruited a large number of qualified per-
 sons.  There was still a possibility of "staging a comeback."  However,
 Wang Anshi did not agree with Du Mu's view.  He also wrote a poem entitled

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 "The Wu Jiang Pavillion" in which he said:   "After repeated battles both
 commanders and fighters were sad and exhausted; the defeat in the central
 plain made it difficult to turn the tide.  Although the brethren were
 still east of the Chang Jiang, were they willing to stage a comeback with
 the ruler?"  Wang Anshi was worthy of the name "China's reformist of the
 11th century" as acclaimed by Lenin, for he noticed that Xiang Yu's defeat
 was a trend of the times that was irreversible.  Although there were still
 a large number of talented persons to the east of the Chang Jiang, they
 would not be willing to reverse the inexorable trend of historical develop-
 ment.  Xiang Yu was the representative of a major anti-Qin force after the
 failure of the great peasant uprising led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang at
 the end of the Qin Dynasty.  He had won numerous battles but he failed
 because he lavishly granted titles to the nobles and attempted to again
 enslave the peasants under the feudal lords.  Although Liu Bang had suffer-
 ed numerous defeats, he achieved the final victory because he represented
 the interests of the newly emerging landlord class and adopted some
 policies that met some of the peasant's demands.   The reason for the
 differences in their fates lie in the fact that one was the representative
 of the progressive forces and the other was the supporter of the decadent
 forces.  Wang Anshi and Du Mu reached different conclusions because they
 had different appraisals of the situation at that time.   One understood
 clearly the "inexorable" trend of historical development while the other
 completely failed to notice it.  Naturally, there were also instances where
 the decadent forces "rose again" and "staged a comeback," but that was
 due to the force in power at that stage being more decadent than the one
 that had been defeated earlier.  Thus we can see that a correct analysis
 of the situation in a given historical period is a fundamental basis for a
 correct understanding of the possibility of the decadent forces "staging
 a comeback."
 Will the counterrevolutionary clique of the "gang of four" that has been
 smashed by the party and the people return to power?  In the last few years
 many people showed great solicitude about this question.  However, our party
 Central Committee is always very sober and has constantly kept great vigi-
 lance.   In order to prevent the "gang of four" from staging a comeback,
 our party has led the people to adopt a series of resolute measures.
 Politically, we have thoroughly exposed the "gang of four" in its true
 antiparty and antipeople counterrevolutionary colors and have carried out
 just historical trials of their countless crimes.   Ideologically, we have
 thoroughly criticized and eliminated the "gang of four's" reactionary
 fallacies and are continuously eliminating their pernicious influence in
 various fields.   Organizationally, we have thoroughly destroyed the "gang
 of four's" factionalist setup and have stipulated that anyone who began
 his career by following the "gang of four" in rebellion and anyone who
 entertains serious factionalism or who has participated in beating, smash-
 ing and looting must not be admitted into the leading groups at various
 levels.   If already admitted, he must be resolutely dismissed from the
 leading groups.  As for those who have committed mistakes by following the
 "gang of four," we have handled their cases in different ways in accordance

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 with the specific natures of their cases and in accordance with the party's
 policies.  By so doing, we have educated and reformed them rather than
 beating them to death with a big stick.  Thus, we have united the majority
 of them and isolated a few obstinate elements.  Now we can safely say that
 we have already thoroughly destroyed the foundation on which the "gang of
 four" depended for its existence.  Through exposing and criticizing the
 "gang of four" and handling their cases, we have vigorously educated the
 broad ranks of cadres and the broad masses of people and made them
 understand that in our society those who entertain ambition and use schemes
 and intrigues to achieve this ambition will certainly come to no good end.
 Now the key lies in whether we who are in power will live up to the expec-
 tations of the people.  It will be dangerous, if we who are in power prove
 to be more rotten than the rotten force we have overthrown or if we commit
 irreversible mistakes. If we do not do so, it is only a dream that any
 rotten and degenerate force could try to stage a comeback and restore their
 rule.   How can the "gang of four" be an exception!  Therefore, we should
 educate the broad ranks of our full-time cadres in this historical material-
 ist viewpoint, pay close attention to maintaining our political conformity
 with the party Central Committee, ensure that we do not commit serious
 mistakes concerning the political line, strive to prevent and overcome
 various corrupt practices and maintain our loyalty to the party and the
 people.   By rectifying the party style, we mean essentially that all the
 cadres in power should have good party style.  We should do this educational
 work well.  Once the party style is really rectified, who will follow the
 "gang of four," even if the ghost of the "gang of four" is still wandering
 here and there?  We must see that the leading group of our party Central
 Committee is strong and powerful and enjoys the confidence of the masses
 of people and that our party's line is correct and is supported by the
 masses of people.  This constitutes a reliable guarantee against the come-
 back of any corrupt force.  There certainly are some people in the party
 who do not live up to the expectations of the people, but their number is
 small.   So long as we, the cadres who are in power at various levels now,
 maintain conformity with the party Central Committee and steadfastly combat
 various unhealthy trends so as to bring about a radical change in the
 party style,  our party and state will have a great future and the pros-
 pects for socialism will be infinitely beautiful.  "History will never
 retrogress."   We should forever remember these well-known words of Mr Lu Xun.

 ENHANCE THEORETICAL CULTIVATION, RAISE THE IDEOLOGICAL LEVEL--STUDY
 VOLUME 1 OF THE 'SELECTED WORKS OF LIU SHAOQI'
 [Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 13-15
 [Article by Wu Liping [0902 7812 1627]]
 [Text]   The recent publication of the first volume of the "Selected Works
 of Liu Shaoqi" by the Editorial Committee on Party Literature is a major
 event in the political life of our country.  As an excellent textbook for
 the study of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, it provides favorable
 conditions for further study of Marxist theory and for the raising of the
 ideological level.   Reading the first volume of the "Selected Works of
 Liu Shaoqi" as an old student of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's, I was deeply
 touched.
 Comrade Liu Shaoqi was one of the outstanding important leaders of our
 party and country.   He dedicated all of his life's energy to the Chinese
 people's revolutionary cause.  During his lifetime he fought resolutely
 to combine the universal theories of Marxism with China's revolutionary
 practice.   He was both a practitioner of revolution as well as a theorist
 of revolution.  His major achievements in the unification of theory and
 practice made a great contribution to the formation and development of
 Mao Zedong Thought.  Works such as "How To Be.a Good Communist," "Response
 to Comrade Song Liang," "Liquidate the Menschevist Ideology Within the
 Party" and "Speech to First Year Students of the Marxist-Leninist Institute"
 all devote considerable space to the discussion of how cadres, particularly
 leading cadres, should enhance their theoretical cultivation.  The study
 of these works in the light of practice in the four modernizations is
 undoubtedly of great practical significance.
 Comrade Liu Shaoqi believed Marxist theory to be a weapon that could be
 used to investigate and resolve all questions.  A leader who fails to
 enhance theoretical cultivation will be unable to correctly recognize and
 resolve problems encountered in the course of revolutionary struggle and
 there arises the danger of confused bearings and deviation from the
 proletarian revolutionary stand.  This is to say that the existence or
 absence of Marxist theoretical cultivation is an important question that
 relates to the success or failure of revolution.   In March 1943,

 Comrade Shaoqi and I went to southern Jiangxi to organize an upsurge of
 production in the tungsten mines.  After arriving at the mines, Comrade
 Shaoqi used ordinary language to explain Marxist theory to the workers
 and used correct ideology to guide the workers' actions.  Production at
 the tungsten mines was quickly raised, which helped to support the revolu-
 tionary cause.   Comrade Shaoqi often said:   Only when the party is led
 by an advanced ideology will it be able to fulfill its role as an advanced
 fighter.   Since revolutionary action is guided by revolutionary theory,
 if the theory is correct the action will be correct and the revolution
 will succeed.  Otherwise, the revolution will be doomed to failure.  How-
 ever, there are a few comrades who do not entirely understand Comrade
 Shaoqi's viewpoint.  Some comrades believe that as long as the fighting
 is courageous and the work enthusiastic there is really no need to study
 revolutionary theory.  To counter this viewpoint Comrade Shaoqi would
 always carry out earnest and patient education.  After affirming that
 revolutionary tenacity and fighting courage are valuable qualities that
 every Communist Party member should have, he would also point out that
 only when the question of how effective revolution is to be made and how
 correct struggle is to [be] carried out have been correctly resolved through
 the study of theory is it then possible to achieve revolutionary victory.
 During the initial period following the foundation of our party, there
 developed in the party an atmosphere of opposition to theoretical research
 generated by an excessive emphasis on the experiences of actual combat.   It
 was also as if there were no need for theoretical study and as long as there
 existed some experience of actual combat the revolution could be guided
 toward victory.  The existence of this erroneous thinking seriously in-
 fluenced efforts to raise the ideological level within the party.
 Comrade Shaoqi often used the lesson learnt from this period of party his-
 tory to arouse cadres' enthusiasm for theoretical cultivation.  He said:
 Our party has one major weakness, which is that ideological preparation and
 theoretical cultivation are insufficient.  The repeated defeats suffered
 by our party in the past have all been due to failures in guidance.  Mis-
 takes in the guidance of the revolutionary cause have caused us to suffer
 grievous losses and have led to partial and sometimes unnecessarily serious
 damage to the revolutionary cause.   It is because of this that from the
 Yan'an period onward Comrade Shaoqi repeatedly raised the question of
 enhancing the theoretical cultivation of cadres.   It was to enhance the
 theoretical cultivation of cadres that on the eve of the founding of the
 People's Republic the party Central Committee established a high-level party
 school. that was named after the Marxist-Leninist Institute in Yan'an and
 had Comrade Shaoqi as its president.   From the speech given by Comrade Shaoqi
 at the beginning of the school term to the first class of students, we
 can see the importance he attached to the raising of the cadres' theoretical
 cultivation.   In the speech Comrade Shaogi related his own personal experiences,
 giving a moving and profound explanation of the importance of theoretical
 cultivation.   He said:  During the course of the revolution there have been
 many regrettable moments; what we must do now, however,  is not regret past

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 events but prepare and study for the future.  The Chinese revolution has"
 now succeeded and it simply will not do not to study.  Before in the
 mountains things were still simple; now that we have come down from the
 mountains and entered the city the questions are far more complex.  If
 we want to run the whole of China, things will be even more difficult.
 Now that the revolution has succeeded it is especially important that we
 do more reading of the works of Marx and Lenin and the works of
 Chairman Mao, and further familiarize ourselves with revolutionary theory;
 otherwise, it will be impossible to do our work well and we may even make
 mistakes.
 If one studies the teachings of Comrade Shaoqi in the light of the practice
 of the 32 years that have passed since the founding of the People's
 Republic, one cannot help but feel admiration.  It cannot be denied that
 during the period before and just after the founding of the People's
 Republic our cadres made considerable theoretical preparation and were
 exceptionally successful in their work to manage the whole of China.   In
 general, however, our cultivation of the theory of socialist reconstruction--
 including the cultivation of knowledge in the fields of politics, economics
 and culture--has been less than complete.  This is an important reason for
 us having taken several wrong turns over the past 30 or so years.  Happily,
 since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee our party
 has revived the fine tradition of emphasizing the study of theory, cleared
 up the influence of leftist errors on our party's guiding ideology, and
 pointed out a correct road for socialist reconstruction that suits the
 conditions in our country.  The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the
 History of. Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC," adopted by the sixth
 plenary session, gives a scientific summary of our party's merits and
 demerits, gains and losses since the founding of the People's Republic.
 The recently held 4th Session of the 5th NPC also adopted Comrade Zhao Ziyang's
 government work report and put forth the ten principles for future economic
 construction.  This shows the great concern our party has for Marxist
 theoretical cultivation and expresses the relatively mature knowledge the
 party has of our country's socialist construction.
 At the same time as emphasizing the need to enhance cadres' theoretical
 cultivation, Comrade Shaoqi also stressed that theory must be both connected
 with reality and united with practice.  He said:   "Marxist theory is a theory
 that was formed in revolutionary practice and also a theory that serves
 revolutionary practice.  As long as revolutionary practice is closely inte-
 grated with our study, use and mastery of theory it will be possible both
 to understand the internal connections of things around us and to determine
 the correct line of action.  Comrade Shaoqi offered incisive criticism of
 certain representatives of dogmatism, pointing out that they have acquired
 only a superficial knowledge of certain Marxist phrases and had completely
 failed to study the essence of the spirit of Marxism.  While they may have
 read Marxist works, they are neither able to use the theories and conclusions
 of these Marxist texts as a guide for action nor to employ them in their

 real and concrete work.  They derive satisfaction from being able to recite
 selected theories and conclusions and pose as "real" Marxists.   In actual
 fact, however, they are not real Marxists at all as their methods of action
 have nothing in common with those of Marxism.
 For Comrade Shaoqi successfully study and investigation were the most im-
 portant aspects of the unity of theory and practice.  He believed that only
 by carrying out down-to-earth study and investigation, by attentively
 listening to the suggestions and criticism of the masses, by carefully
 examining actual problems in life and work and by carefully summarizing
 lessons drawn from practice is'it possible to discover whether one's
 understanding and use of Marxism are correct or to discover and correct
 one's own failings and mistakes.  Only in this way can one's work be improved.
 Comrade Shaoqi solemnly criticized the inability of dogmatists to use Marxist
 theory in accordance with the changes in objective conditions; and pointed
 out that their decisions on policy and direction derived not from an examina-
 tion of the surrounding situation but from identical or similar events found
 in books or history.   In practice they are idealists.   Comrade Shaoqi's
 criticism of dogmatism still has instructive significance for us today.
 As Comrade Qiaomu has pointed out, failing both to acknowledge the historical
 necessity and victorious practice of China's revolutionary development and
 to accept a series of discussions by Lenin before and after Russia's October
 Revolution and the new development of international socialism in the 20th
 century, some people have over the past few years made dogmatic statements
 that socialism must be built on a foundation of highly developed socialized
 production and must eliminate the production of commodity products.  On the
 basis of this, they conclude that China's economy is backward and that it
 is neither possible nor desirable to establish socialism.    Surely people,
 who propagate such mistaken views might have something to learn from
 Comrade Shaoqi's criticism.
 Comrade Shaoqi believed that it was not at all easy to successfully integrate
 theory and practice as it required an end to all lazy thinking.   He said:
 If one is to understand a complex question or a truth, it is essential that
 one be both rigorous and independent in spirit and work.  Whenever
 Comrade Shaoqi judged whether a leading cadre was qualified or not he would
 always use the ability to make independent decisions as an important criterion.
 lie often said that if one wants to be a good cadre qualified for leading
 work, one must be able to make independent decisions.  Anyone who is unwilling
 to take on hard work alone will be unable to do a good job of anything.   For
 this reason, in addition.to firmly upholding the guiding principles of
 Marxism and resolutely implementing the line, principles and policy of the
 Central Committee, it is necessary to go deep among the masses, to do pains-
 taking investigative work, and to do one's utmost to closely integrate
 Marxist theory and the principles of the Central Committee with the actual
 conditions of each area and each unit.  This unity of Marxist theory and
 practice is an ideological approach and method of work that was consistently
 and steadfastly upheld by Comrade Shaoqi.  During the early period of the
 war of resistance against Japan, Comrade Shaoqi first made a rapid break-
 through in the north China region, mobilizing the broad masses of the
 people against the Japanese.   This was achieved through an examination and

 understanding of favorable opportunities.  Afterward he went to central
 China, where he formulated a correct political and military policy on the
 basis of the correct principles of the Central Committee and the actual
 conditions in the area, and managed to rapidly establish firm democratic
 bases of resistance against the Japanese in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui,
 Henan and Hubei provinces.  All this was the result of Comrade Shaoqi's
 efforts to firmly uphold the unity of Marxist theory and practice and
 his full use of the spirit of individual creativity.
 Comrade Shaoqi also placed a great deal of emphasis on the question of
 combining theoretical cultivation with ideological cultivation.  He believed
 that a truly qualified leading cadre must have both theoretical and ideo-
 logical cultivation and should be able to combine transformation of the
 objective world with the transformation of the subjective world.  He said
 that we must change ourselves and develop our proletarian ideology not
 only through revolutionary practice, but also through the study of Marxist
 theory.   Soon after the beginning of the war of resistance against Japan,
 our party grew in strength and these party members were undoubtedly the
 outstanding daughters and sons of the Chinese people and were the advanced
 element of the proletariat.  However, in old China there existed an
 exploiting class as well as a vast class of small capitalists and, owing
 to the differences in background and motives of those entering the party,
 all kinds of nonproletarian thinking unavoidably entered the party.  For
 example, some cadres are always seeking the limelight or hoping to be
 individual heroes, others are individualistic or selfish in their thinking
 and there is even a minority who share the ideology of the exploiting class.
 In this way various ideological differences have emerged within the party and
 unhealthy trends and evil practices have begun to spread, causing controversy
 and dissension to arise within the party.  How party members, particularly
 party cadres, should overcome all types of nonproletarian thinking is now an
 important problem that must be solved.   Comrade Shaoqi did considerable work
 on this question of overcoming nonproletarian ideology within the party.
 Comrade Shaoqi said:  When studying Marxist theory one must correctly combine
 this study with ideological cultivation and should use Marxist-Leninist
 thinking to resist and overcome all forms of nonproletarian thinking.
 Comrade Shaoqi often said that only when one has a correct viewpoint is it
 possible to study and use Marxist theory.   The correct viewpoint is the
 proletarian viewpoint.  Without a clear and firm proletarian viewpoint and
 without a correct and pure proletarian ideology it is impossible for a
 Communist Party member either to thoroughly understand and truly master the
 methods and theory of Marxism or to use them as weapons in revolutionary
 struggle.  That is to say, for one to have relatively good cultivation of
 Marxist theory a steadfast proletarian viewpoint is absolutely essential.
 Or put in another way, if a Communist Party member neither diligently
 studies the theory and methods of Marxism nor uses Marxism to guide his
 own thinking and action it will be impossible for him to either resolutely
 uphold the proletarian viewpoint in all revolutionary struggle or to ever
 embody proletarian ideology.  Only through a serious understanding of
 Marxist theory is it possible to consciously consolidate, strengthen and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 develop this kind of proletarian viewpoint.  We should approach all types
 of thinking and suggestions within the party by first clarifying which is
 correct and favorable to the party and revolution and which is incorrect
 and damages the party and revolution.  In this way we can decide what to
 praise and what to oppose, how to raise and develop proletarian righteous-
 ness and how to resist all unhealthy trends; we will learn not to fear
 necessary struggles within the party and not to tolerate the development
 of any form of mistaken thinking or unhealthy tendency but will struggle
 resolutely against them; we will be able to combine a clear unwillingness
 to compromise on matters of principle with flexible methods of struggle
 and the spirit of patient persuasion, and in the course of long-term
 struggle we shall be able to educate, criticize, train and transform those
 comrades who have committed errors but are not completely incorrigible.
 Comrade Shaoqi's discussions on the need to overcome all forms of non-
 proletarian ideology through the enhancement of leading cadres' theoretical
 cultivation not only played a positive role in the establishment of our
 party but also have important practical significance today.
 While 10-odd years have passed, the important question still lies in the
 study of Marxist theory.   In the past Comrade Shaoqi urged us to study
 Marxist theory in order to "run the whole country"; today in this new
 historical period the four modernizations and the "renovation of China"
 also demand that we act according to Comrade Shaoqi's demands and study
 Marxism.  Only by continuing to raise the level of cultivation of Marxist
 theory will we be able to guarantee that all our future work is successful,
 that we do not repeat past mistakes and that the cause of our country's
 socialist construction moves forward steadily and effectively.

 IT IS NECESSARY TO PAY GREAT ATTENTION TO THE STUDY OF MARXIST THEORY--AFTER
 READING LIU SHAOQI'S  'REPLY TO COMRADE SONG LIANG'
 Beijing RED FLAG in   Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 16-18
 [Article by Yu Haocheng [0060 3185 2052]]
 [Text]   In his article "Reply to Comrade Song Liang" written 40 years ago,
 Comrade Shaoqi stated that our party was not well prepared in theoretical
 work.  He held that in addition to the general practice of opposing theo-
 retical study which existed inside the party in its early stage and which
 had prevented our party's theoretical level from improving, there were
 three other factors which had given rise to this problem:   1) The period
 since the introduction of Marxist works itito China was not long, whereas
 Marxism had already been disseminated in Europe for nearly a century;
 2) The moment after it was founded, the Chinese party was drawn into a great
 and practical revolutionary struggle, not having enough time for doing
 theoretical study and for summing up its experience in carrying out struggle;
 3) Not much about China was mentioned in the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin
 or Stalin.  Therefore, it was especially difficult to use the principles of
 Marxism to explain and guide the historical practice of Chinese society.
 Comrade Shaoqi held that for these reasons, and especially because our
 party had not made sufficient efforts to this end, it had not been able to
 overcome its weakness of lack of theory even though our party had had rich
 experience in practical struggle.
 "Reply to Comrade Song Liang" was written in 1941.  This was followed by
 the rectification campaign throughout the whole party.  Party members and
 cadres were educated in Marxism-Leninism, and revolutionary experiences
 and lessons were summed up in the light of the party's history.  Making
 investigations and studies, seeking truth from facts and integrating theory
 with practice became our party's work style.   Consequently, a foundation
 for winning the victory of the new democratic revolution was laid.  However,
 viewed from the situation of all the cadres of our party, we could not say
 that we had basically done away with the weakness of la&k of theory.
 After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our party, guided by
 Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, led the people of the whole country in
 the socialist revolution and socialist construction and made tremendous

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 achievements.  However, as stated in the "Resolution on Certain Questions in
 the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC," "new China has
 not been in existence for very long, and our successes are still preliminary.
 Our party has made mistakes, owing to its meager experience in leading the
 cause of socialism and subjective errors in the party leadership's analysis
 of the situation and its understanding of Chinese conditions.   Before the
 'Cultural Revolution' there were mistakes of enlarging the scope of class
 struggle and of impetuosity and rashness in economic construction.  Later,
 there was the comprehensive, long-drawn-out and grave blunder of the
 'Cultural Revolution.'  All these errors prevented us from scoring the
 greater achievements of which we should have been capable."
 Since the smashing of the "gang of four," especially since the party's,
 third plenary session, things have indeed taken on a new aspect in theoreti-
 cal work.  Marx said, "How well theory is realized in a country depends on
 how well theory meets the needs of this country." ("Collected Works of
 Marx and Engels," vol 1, p 10)  The reason theoretical work has made such
 headway is entirely because it has been suited to the needs of the revolu-
 tionary struggle and practical work.
 At present, our party has been gradually establishing a correct road to build
 the socialist modernizations that is suited to our country's conditions.  The
 10 basic points of this road have been expounded in the "Resolution on
 Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC."
 These 10 points are basically a summary of the positive and negative exper-
 iences gained since the founding of our country, particularly of the lessons
 drawn from the "Great Cultural Revolution."  Under the present circumstances,
 does the situation of our lacking theoretical preparation and cultivation
 as mentioned in Comrade Liu Shaoqi's article "Reply to Comrade Song Liang"
 no longer exist?  If all the cadres are taken into consideration, we should
 not be too optimistic in our estimation.  We should understand that when we
 say that our party has already fulfilled the task of bringing order out of
 chaos during the period from the third plenary session to the sixth plenary
 session, we are talking about the party's guiding ideology.  Viewed from
 the whole party's practical work in different fields, we have to continue
 to fulfill the task of bringing order out of chaos.  Therefore, we cannot
 say that Comrade Liu Shaoqi's opinion is outdated.  When we reread "Reply
 to Comrade Song Liang" today, we still find that it touches our hearts.
 First, theoretical work still falls far behind the needs of practical work.
 We have not yet gone deep into many aspects of the great practice of realiz-
 ing the four modernizations in our country and of the new situations and new
 problems we encounter in this practice, nor have we worked out solutions that
 are of great significance in giving guidance.  We have not carried out
 thorough study of many important. theoretical questions.  We have not even
 done enough work in making comprehensive investigations and surveys and in
 systematically accumulating materials.
 Second, the tendency to look down on theoretical study and research still
 exists to varying degrees among some comrades in some places.  As pointed
 28

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 out by Comrade Liu Shaoqi in his article "Reply to Comrade Song Liang,"
 these comrades seem to think that they can be content and lead the revolu-
 tion to victory so long as they have experience in practical struggle and
 that they do not need profound theoretical study.  They seem to think that
 the Marxist theory can be mastered without being seriously and thoroughly
 studied over a long period of time.   Some comrades think that theoretical
 study, especially theoretical study of social sciences, is not of much
 use and that it is not essential.  The phenomenon of "attaching importance
 to science and engineering and looking down upon literature and history"
 in the society may be related to this.   Some people seem to think that the
 four modernizations need only natural sciences and not social sciences.   It
 seems that it will be enough just to carry out economic readjustment and
 to develop production, whereas political reforms and promoting democracy
 are of no consequence.   It seems that it is enough just to build a material
 civilization and the building of a spiritual civilization is an unnecessary
 move.   This kind of understanding is apparently one-sided and erroneous.
 Third, discussion and debate of theoretical problems have not been suffi-
 ciently carried out.  There is a kind of habit formed over many years.   It
 seems that only a certain leader is responsible for developing revolutionary
 theory.  Whenever we come across a problem, we can only try to find a ready
 solution to it in classical works.  We need not use our brains at all. Even
 if we have some ideas, we dare not put them forth.   This study style of
 "daring only to repeat the words of saints" has caused theoretical work to
 stagnate or even shrink.  Marx once said, "Truth is established through
 debate." ("Complete Works of Marx and Engels," vol 28, p 286)  Comrade Mao Zedong
 also said, "Only by comparing can one distinguish.   Only by making distinctions
 and waging struggle can there be development."    Without controversies with
 different views, truth cannot be found, nor can it be developed.   In his
 speech given at a meeting to discuss ideological guidelines for theoretical
 work, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "We must resolutely implement the policy
 of 'letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought
 contend' in studying and discussing ideological and theoretical problems.
 We must resolutely implement the policy of not seizing on mistakes, not
 sticking political labels on others and not using the big stick.  We must
 resolutely implement the policy of emancipating the mind, doing away with
 superstitions and proceeding from reality in everything.   All these aspects
 were decided at the third plenary session.   I have now restated them, and
 no wavering is permitted."  Truly implementing the above policies is the
 key to the prosperity and development of science and theory.
 In our country, upholding the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought
 is incontestable.  But is it permissible to probe into and discuss Marxism-
 Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought?                              The answer should be positive.   The reason is
 that if we want to uphold Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, we must
 answer the question what is Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  People's
 understanding of this question varies.  Therefore, much discussion is needed.
 Not only discussion but also criticism is permitted.  Comrade Mao Zedong
 said, "Since Marxism is accepted as the guiding ideology by the majority of
 the people in our country, can it be criticized?  Certainly it can.  Marxism
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 is scientific truth and fears no criticism.   If it did, and if it could be
 overthrown by criticism, it would be worthless."  "Marxists should not be
 afraid of criticism from any quarter.  Quite the contrary, they need to
 temper and develop themselves in the teeth of criticism and in the storm
 and stress of struggle." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," vol 5, p 391)
 The main problem on the theoretical front today is that the discussion
 of theoretical problems has not been correctly carried out.   Some comrades
 regard themselves as infallible and will not listen to any criticism.   The
 moment some comrades hear views which differ from theirs, they usually
 silence them in an oversimplified and crude way and will not solve a problem
 by means of discussion on the basis of equality.  This attitude runs counter
 to Marxism and is harmful to defending and developing Marxism.
 In order to ensure that theoretical work can be carried out more normally
 and healthily and without interference, we must pay attention to differentiat-
 ing theoretical study from theoretical propaganda.  Newspapers and radio
 stations should, under the leadership of the party, unfold lively and
 feasible discussions on correctly understanding and implementing various
 policies and principles of the party.  This is conducive to carrying out
 thorough propaganda and education among the cadres and the masses.  But
 this kind of discussion should not become an open debate of
 the
 right and
 wrong of the party's basic policies and principles, in order
 to
 avoid
 causing confusion among the masses.   Similarly, for the sake
 of
 listening
 to opinions from all quarters, questions involving policies
 and
 principles
 or some important political questions that have not yet been decided on by
 the Central Committee may also be openly discussed in newspapers if the
 Central Committee has agreed to do so.  But we must be ready to make con-
 clusions within a certain period of time during this kind of discussion so
 that the cadres and the masses will not be at a loss as to what to do or
 to act as they think correct.  Otherwise, it is not advisable to have such
 discussion.   Even greater prudence is needed in publicizing policies and
 important measures which are still in an experimental stage.  We must
 objectively and comprehensively reflect the situation and should draw
 hasty conclusions.
 The "Resolution of Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the
 Founding of the PRC" has pointed out, "It is imperative for the whole party
 to engage in a more diligent study of Marxist theories, of the past and
 present in China and abroad, and of the different branches of the natural
 and social sciences."  Let us seriously study the works of Marx, Engels,
 Lenin and Stalin and the works of Comrades Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and
 Liu Shaoqi, strive to go deep into theoretical problems that emerge one
 after another in reality and make new contributions in making use of and
 developing Marxist theory, studying new situations and solving new problems.

 SOCIALIST HUMAN RESOURCES SYSTEM ENGINEERING
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 19-22
 [Special commentary by Qian Xuesan [6929 1331 2773]]
 [Text]   In our socialist country, the people are the masters.  The state
 is responsible for the people and has the duty to cherish the entire people,
 organize the people, bring the enthusiasm of the people into the fullest
 play, give scope to the intelligence and wisdom of the people, and build
 socialism in the interests of the people.  What we mean by the people is
 the workers, peasants, intellectuals and other patriotic people.   Thus the
 concept of talented people has been expanded.  What we mean by talented
 people refers to the talents and capabilities of the people in all trades
 and professions among the people rather than the so-called geniuses.   Such
 a question of talent did not exist in any society in the past and only
 under socialism can it be put to the fore.   So it is a brand-new question.
 On this important and wide-ranging question, what I am going to touch on is
 naturally limited and premature.  However, I would like to air my view so
 that everyone can discuss the question together.
 Where do man's abilities come from?  Are they inborn or acquired after birth?
 The studies of modern psychology and physiological psychology have shown
 that most of man's abilities are acquired gradually after his birth, namely,
 acquired step by step through practice.  An animal is different from man.
 Its abilities are mostly hereditary.   A cat's instinct is to catch mice and
 a worker bee instinctively gathers honey.  Man's "natural gift" lies, as
 it is said, in the extremely great plasticity of man's brain.   A man studies
 and enhances his abilities and wisdom all his life.   Comrade Zhou Enlai
 said:   "Learn, work and remold yourself as long as you live."  Facts are
 really like this.   This is a scientific thesis.  Then do we hold that there
 is no difference between one man and another?  Certainly not.   For instance,
 a man is possibly born with hereditary or embryonic defects, but this case
 constitutes a tiny minority.  What is more important is that the immense
 variety of things and practice a man undergoes after his birth and the
 varied education and practice he receives later are the chief causes of the
 31

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 difference in men's abilities.   It is a pity that up to now psychology and
 pedagogy have not found out a complete set of laws.  Very often people
 say that this child is clever and that child is stupid, but they do not
 know why.  To find out this law,, it is necessary to engage in the study
 of the science of thought.  At present we have to rely on some incomplete
 "wise remarks of experienced persons" and on things like autobiographies
 of some people who have had very successful careers and famous scientists
 in developing the intelligence of children.  Therefore, the science of
 thought as well as psychology and pedagogy are really the foundation for
 developing intellectual resources.  We must attach great importance to
 the study of these sciences.   It is unfortunate that during the 10 years
 of internal disorder the work in this field was attacked and wrecked in
 varying degrees and the bad influence has remained to be felt up to this day.
 Apart from intelligence, man's ability consists of knowledge.   That is to say,
 the recorded practice and experience of mankind and the knowledge of the
 objective world derived therefrom are summarized into branches of learning.
 This knowledge concerning branches of learning can be taught to the new
 generation and to those who need it.   Either the teachers give lectures on
 the knowledge and the stud=ents attend these lectures, or the students
 master it through self-study.  By education, we mean chiefly this matter.
 The importance of education in developing man's ability is intimately known
 to all.
 By dividing intelligence and knowledge into two separate parts, I mean to
 stress that there is a difference between the two.  How to develop man's
 intelligence has remained an obscure problem up to now, but it is relatively
 easy to increase one's knowledge.  There is a complete set of effective
 measures in this respect.   Of course, intelligence and knowledge are related.
 Those people who show a lot of intelligence can acquire knowledge very
 quickly.   Substantial knowledge contributes to the improvement of intelli-
 gence.  In increasing his knowledge and experience, instead of depending
 mainly on his intelligence, a man has to study.
 After a man is born, no matter how, his ability varies owing to different
 experiences and different conditions for study.  The difference is manifested
 in two fields:   one is that man's ability might be great or small, and the
 other is that men's abilities are different.   The former refers to the
 fact that the results of work in a certain field are different, different
 in both quality and quantity.  The latter refers to the fact that men's
 abilities are different.   Some people can do certain work well in both
 quality and quantity, but they might do work in another field badly in both
 quality and quantity.  Therefore, so far as the state is concerned, it is a
 big problem how to put the most suitable people in the most suitable work
 posts.  This is a question of using people and central to this question is
 judgment of people.  People like to mention the historical story of Bo Le's
 spotting a horse that could cover 1,000 li a day, and even call it the
 theory of Bo Le.   Quite a few young people consider themselves to be
 32
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 1,000-li horses in the march toward science and always complain that they
 have not been spotted by a Bo Le.   For this reason, they take delight in
 talking about this question.  We must take a scientific approach to it.
 First, a 1,.000-li horse is only one type of horse.  A horse that covers
 1,000 li a day might not necessarily compare favorably with a draft horse
 in drawing a heavily laden cart.  Building socialism requires all kinds
 of talented people.   So a 1,000-li horse is not necessarily more superb
 than any other horse.  This depends on the type of work.  The so-called
 "geniuses" trumpeted by the old society frequently did not recognize
 the talents in all trades and professions among the people.   This is a
 manifestation of narrow-mindedness and can also be said to be a class
 prejudice.  We need not only 1,000-li horses and Bo Le's who can spot them
 but also other types of horses and people who are good judges of them.
 Second, was Bo Le's ability magical?  Of course not.   Invariably, objective
 things have their own laws.  We must understand these laws.  Is it so
 difficult to understand the laws?   It does not seem so.   In the scores of
 years of revolutionary struggle, has our party not discerned and selected
 large batches of cadres from among,tens of thousands of revolutionaries
 and not promoted fine leaders from among them?  Has it not been very
 successful?  The success in the promotion of revolutionary cadres and
 revolutionary leaders shows that it is possible to master the laws of
 judging fine people who are engaged in revolutionary work.   If we can
 understand one aspect of a thing, we will be able to understand two or
 three other aspects....   The question of knowing people covers the study
 of the characteristics of able people in all trades and professions in
 the course of building socialism so that we can discern these characteristics
 promptly and accurately.   This is the real task of the theory of human re-
 sources.  The scope of study of the theory of human resources is extensive,
 and it must not be confined only to discerning people qualified in scientific
 research.
 Above, we have studied the differences and changes between one man and
 another in terms of the process of the development of man's ability.   That
 is so not only in terms of experience and practice but also in terms of
 physiology.  A middle-aged man is different from a young man, and needless
 to say, being physically weak, an old man is naturally different from a
 middle-aged or young man.  Therefore, the ability of one man and another
 is not only different, but changes as a man ages.  The work which best
 suits a young man will not necessarily suit the same man in -his middle
 or old age.  In order to suit a person to his work and put the most suit-
 able persons in work posts, a flow of personnel must be allowed.  This
 state of affairs is commonly seen in foreign countries, where no one remains
 for a lifetime in one position.
 There is another reason for changes in work, viz, that science and technology
 are advancing and society is developing, thus resulting in the constant

 evolution of the affairs that man must handle.  With the changes in work
 fields, those departments which formerly needed many hands have become
 departments which need only a few hands, and posts which did not exist in
 the.past have now emerged.  This state of affairs might not have been
 noticeable in feudal society, for history progressed slowly at that time and
 there were few changes in a man's lifetime.  Now, things are new and different
 every day.  Changes take place in the period of scores of years and even in
 a very few years.   Great changes are expected to take place in our country
 between now and the year 2000.
 Owing to the above-mentioned reasons, to put the most suitable persons in
 the most suitable positions, the positions of personnel must not be fixed.
 In our socialist country, the problem is how to realize the flow of
 personnel.  Must there be a spontaneous flow of personnel and must people
 look for jobs themselves?  This will lead to social chaos and is therefore
 not desirable.  This work should be rationally arranged by the state in a
 planned way by taking into consideration the situation as a whole.
 Another problem in China's personnel work which requires a solution is
 how to arrange the retirement of cadres in their old age and how to take
 care of their livelihood and arrange appropriate activities for them after
 retirement.  At present, China has about 200 million cadres and they will
 possibly grow in number with the development of the socialist cause.   If
 we say that a cadre will retire after he has worked for the people and the'
 country for 40 years and live, on average, 10 more years after retirement,
 the ratio will be 4 to 1.  Hence, there will be 5 or 6 million retired
 cadres in our country.  This figure does not include the retired staff and
 workers plus the retired workers of the enterprises under the system of
 ownership by the whole people.   In the near future the number of retired
 personnel that the state will have to take care of will increase.  Our
 present rules and regulations in this regard are imperfect.   The arrangement
 of life and appropriate work for the retired personnel is mostly delegated
 to the units they belong to, thus becoming a burden to the units and result-
 ing in failure to give full scope to the roles of the retired personnel
 and to let them really have a new life and serve the people within their
 power while spending their remaining years in jubilation.  The state
 assumes full responsibility for providing for the retired personnel.
 This is a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system.  We
 must take a step further and look upon these personnel with rich experience
 as the valuable treasure of the country rather than as a negative burden.
 Only in doing so can the inherent superiority of socialism be brought into
 full play.
 The existing state of affairs in China in which the various units separately
 handle their own affairs in personnel work exist not only among the retired
 personnel but also among the youths waiting for jobs.  Drawbacks have
 cropped up with this method.   In fact the phenomena of decentralized manage-
 ment can be found widely.   For example, apart from a small number of.senior

 cadres who are subject to the centralized administration of the central
 authorities, the overwhelming majority of cadres and the whole body of
 workers should be taken care of by their respective units.  The institu-
 tions of higher learning which train young people are only partially
 subject to the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, and
 quite a few institutions of higher learning are put under the management
 of the various departments under the State Council and various provinces,
 municipalities and autonomous regions.  The overwhelming majority of
 technical schools at the secondary educational level are managed by the
 various departments themselves.  On-the-job study has become the exclusive
 business of the departments concerned.  Assignment of jobs or positions to
 people who have received an education is, therefore, also put under decen-
 tralized management.   So the practice of "a waterfront pavilion getting the
 moonlight first"--benefiting because of the favorable position one is in--
 is difficult to avoid.
 In my opinion, the emergence. of this state of affairs is understandable.
 After all, our country was established directly on the basis of the feudal
 society with more than 2,000 years of history and on the basis of a semi-
 feudal and semicolonial system with more than 100 years of history.   In the
 interval, there was no social system based on mass production.  Only 20 years
 or more have elapsed since the basic completion of socialist transformation;
 this is too short a time.  In between there were also the "10 years of
 internal disorder."  However, the drawbacks of this decentralized management
 system have become very pronounced.   I had previously appealed that reforms
 should be made, that the training, promotion and use of personnel be put
 under centralized management, that a good job be done in cherishing as
 well as organizing and taking care of 1 billion people, and that the people's
 abilities should be enhanced, on the one hand, and that suitable posts be
 arranged for everyone, on the other hand, so that everyone could make the
 best use of his ability.   This is also a matter of prime importance in
 building socialism and also an important matter which did not exist in the
 past society and other countries and which demands our pioneering efforts.
 To train, promote and use 1 billion people and arrange their retirement and
 life after retirement well, it is imperative for the state to establish a
 unified, centralized and graded management system.   Is this work too compli-
 cated?  Can it be managed well?  Let us make a concrete analysis of the
 following things:
 First, our party has 60 years of experience in governing the cadres, of
 which quite a few experiences have been successful, as we mentioned above.
 There has also been quite a lot of experience in the 32 years since the
 founding of the PRC.  We must earnestly sum up these experiences.
 Second, we can use our good experience in using people and the experience
 of foreign countries in training, promoting and using talented people for
 reference.'  Because the social systems are different, these experiences must
 35
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 not be copied and applied everywhere indiscriminately and mechanically.
 However, the experiences of the capitalist countries in using people have
 been obtained under the conditions of socialized mass production and of
 highly developed science and technology.  For instance, personnel are
 released from their regular work to take part in short-term training and
 are promoted to higher positions based on the results of their studies.
 This method goes around and begins again.  Thus more professionally
 competent people are selected time and again.  Those who have failed to do
 their work satisfactorily are transferred to new posts where they can
 give scope to their specialities.  This method is scientific and we must
 use it for reference.
 Third, the management technique of keeping dossiers on cadres.  Once a
 centralized and graded management system is in force, it will possibly
 be necessary to concurrently assess tens of thousands of people and to
 select the most suitable from the dossiers of tens of thousands of people.
 It does not really work to use the old method of leafing through the
 dossiers file after file.  Now, there are electronic computerized systems
 for reviewing archives, and thus looking into archives becomes automatic.
 It works 10 million times faster than the method of looking into archives
 manually.   So long as the conditions for selecting cadres are fixed,
 electronic computers can automatically select the most suitable people.
 Archives are recorded on tapes, which can be constantly replenished.  The
 conditions of a man's work and the reactions and comments of the masses,
 his colleagues and leadership to him can be sent to the archives and added
 to his dossier through normal channels.  This complete set of techniques
 has now been fairly well perfected and is available for use.   So there is
 no need to worry about falling short of one's wishes and about being
 unable to manage the work well.
 Fourth, to really begin this system in education work, not only must primary
 schools, middle schools, secondary technical schools, secondary vocational
 schools and institutions of higher learning be greatly developed, there must
 also be a great variety of all kinds of short-term training classes attended
 by people not engaged in production or not withdrawn from production.   Is the
 organizational work of centralized management too elaborate?  Like the pre-
 vious question,  the answer to this question is that the work can be wholly
 done by electronic computers and there are no difficulties at all.
 Fifth, the modernization of teaching work can substantially raise efficiency
 and save money.  This "education with electronic audio-visual aids" is
 already known to all.  Lectures given by an experienced teacher with great
 learning who is an excellent teacher can be recorded and then broadcast
 throughout the nation with thousands upon thousands of students hearing them.
 Our television has now begun to adopt this method and has achieved marked
 results.   In fact, this work is expected to be done better in the future.
 We can use synchronous earth satellites over the equator to rebroadcast
 television programs or we can go more directly and use the direct broadcasting
 television satellites on a synchronous orbit to broadcast educational programs

 with electronic audio-visual aids to any border region.  This technology
 is readymade.  Besides, the number of television sets is increasing in
 the countryside.  Putting into practice this modern teaching method is
 no longer a matter within sight but beyond reach.
 Sixth, the ability to discern talented people.  This can also be summed up,.
 The key to this question lies in finding out people who know the business.
 Bo Le could spot a horse that could cover 1,000 li a day, but he might not
 necessarily be able to distinguish other types of horses.   It is not
 difficult for a professor of physics to spot a physics postgraduate student
 and to judge whether to enroll him as his student, because he knows the
 characteristics which a postgraduate of physics should possess; even if he
 fails to find the characteristics from the answers in the postgraduate's
 examination papers, he will solve this problem easily by speaking to the
 student face to face.   So face-to-face speaking between experts and pros-
 pective candidates is a good method to discern talented people.   This has
 been proved for a long time.  Then must specialists in all kinds of fields
 be on the spot to judge and assess the detailed archives in using the
 techniques in the third and fourth points mentioned above?  Of course not.
 There is now a new manmade intelligence technique operated by electronic
 computers called a "specialist system."  This specialist system can draw
 on the methods of judgment and assessment of experts being fed into the
 computers and let the computers learn to manage the abilities of the experts.
 When the experts are not on the spot, the computers can do the work for
 them.   So the question of judging people is not difficult to handle.
 Seventh, systems science and systems engineering.   It is an unprecedentedly
 large-scale organizational and administrative task to have the state assume
 all-round responsibility for training, promoting and using 1 billion people
 from birth to death.   If this question were raised 40 or 50 years ago, people
 would have thought that the question was so extensive that they would not
 know where to begin.   Now we have already entered the 1980's.  The systems
 engineering developed during this stage and its pure operational research
 have become a mature discipline and are gradually forming a branch of
 learning--systems science.  Wiith systems science it is not difficult to
 face the questions of governing socialist human resources which I have
 mentioned above.  Our objects are in fact a giant system with 1 billion
 units.  This. system consists of a number of components, namely, educational
 subsystem, archive storage and retrieval subsystem, and retired personnel
 subsystem.  Every subsystem consists of some levels.   For example, the
 province is a level and the state is the highest level.  Problems can be
 solved first in the lower level, but the solution of problems must not be
 confined to one level.  When no satisfactory solution is arrived at, the
 problems can be advanced to a higher level and be handled there.   So the
 whole system, the giant system, is still unified under the state's cen-
 tralized management.  Establishing and operating such a human resources
 system can be called socialist. human resources systems engineering.  By the
 term socialist we mean that this human resources system is based on the
 fundamental principles of socialism.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 With the above-mentioned seven things which can be used to establish our
 human resources system and do concrete work, in my opinion, provided we
 realize the importance of the question of human resources to the building
 of socialism and are resolved to promote this work, then this brand new
 undertaking can be fulfilled in not too long a time because we have ready-
 made science and technology to use.  Of course, in doing so we need some
 new equipment, and some investment is indispensable.  Compared with the
 investments poured into the state's various capital construction projects,
 the investment in the completion of socialist human resources systems
 engineering itself is much smaller.
 What can be attained is not necessarily just around the corner, but rather
 will take a certain amount of time.  Besides, everything cannot always be
 perfect, leaving no problems to be solved.   It will take time to start
 our socialist human resources systems engineering.  Once it is established,
 it will still require constant improvement.  The country is advancing and
 so is the socialist cause.  Any established system invariably fails to keep
 abreast of the changes in reality.  That is to say, the socialist human
 resources systems engineering can solve the problems of substantial
 importance, but it cannot solve all problems in the work of training, pro-
 moting and using talented people, and there exist contradictions in it.
 What should be done concerning the contradictions?   In handling the con-
 tradictions, we must still rely on ideological consciousness and on taking
 the interests of the whole into account.  In other words, it is of great
 importance to always persist in ideological and political work among the
 people.  People look upon ideological and political work as the work of
 building the socialist spiritual civilization, and in fact the training,
 promotion and proper use of people's talents is also the work of building
 socialist spiritual civilization.

 GIVE THE PEASANTS MORE AND BETTER SPIRITUAL NOURISHMENT
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 23-26
 [Article by Zhou Weishi [0791 1550 1492]]
 [Text] Amid the sound of gongs and drums to jubilantly celebrate bumper
 harvests in the vast countryside, the Ministry of Culture held a national
 meeting in recognition of advanced collectives and advanced workers in
 rural cultural and art work, thus ushering in a year of new developments
 in rural culture and art undertakings.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, there has
 been now a vast panorama full of vitality in the rural areas throughout
 the nation, and the large numbers of commune members have been full of joy
 because of the gradual implementation of rural economic policies and the
 continuous perfection of the production responsibility system.  Agricultural
 development is now on. the upswing.  This is an excellent situation rarely
 seen in many years.  With the development of production and improvement in
 the people's livelihood, the broad masses of peasants have continuously
 raised new demands for improvements in cultural life.  This has brought
 about a new situation in our country's rural cultural work and also has
 imposed new tasks on us.
 Under the correct leadership and kind attention of the CCP Central Committee,
 the leadership at various levels and the vast numbers of literary and art
 workers have adopted positive measures to enrich the cultural life of
 800 million peasants through all kinds of forms, have carried out education
 on collectivism and patriotism among the peasants and have encouraged them
 to struggle to build a new socialist countryside with a prosperous economy
 while enhancing their lofty spirit.   In the past few years, the rural
 cultural and art undertakings have been greatly restored and developed and
 the rural cultural activities have been relatively enlivened.  At present,
 there are nearly 90,000 rural film projection units, 3,000 county cultural
 palaces, over 1,500 libraries at county level and 27,000 commune cultural
 centers throughout the country.  Over the past 2 years, financed by the
 state,  3,000 more commune cultural services have been set up and more than
 3,000 cinemas and theaters in rural market towns have been rebuilt or built

 by relying mainly on the strength of the collective economy of the communes
 and their subdivisions.   Between January and September of last year, the
 rural film projection units and the cinemas and theaters in rural market
 towns provided more than 16 million film shows to a total audience of
 13.3 billion, which averaged 16 film shows per person.  The vocational
 performing art troupes went to the countryside and put on 560,000 or more
 performances in 1980 and the number of performances staged by commune art
 troupes and amateur peasant troupes was even greater.   Many cultural
 palace centers, and in particular cultural services, provide every cultural
 activity imaginable, including entertainment and study.  There are not
 only recreational activities but also study guidance provided and technical
 research and sports meets in the cultural palaces and service centers.
 Their programs are substantial and colorful and are, therefore, warmly
 welcomed by the peasants.   These cultural activities have met not only
 the demands for the cultural life of the peasants and enhanced their
 political consciousness, but also have played a positive role in developing
 agricultural production, consolidating the situation of stability and unity,
 changing the general mood of society and bringing up a new generation in
 the countryside.   So, generally speaking, the rural cultural situation is
 good and substantial results have been made in rural cultural and art
 work.  However, it must be soberly realized that the rural cultural work
 is still far from meeting the needs of the cultural life of the vast
 numbers of peasants.  The peasants in some mountainous border areas have
 sighed that "We have no worries about food and clothing, but what we worry
 about is that there are no films or plays to see."  This state of affairs
 exists rather widely.  The peasants who have some cultural activities have
 voiced the opinion that "we do not have to worry about food, clothing
 and housing, but what we are anxious about is that the cultural activities
 are not adequate."  The peasants in regions where the cultural activities
 are fairly rich also raise the demand:   "We have become prosperous.  We
 eagerly hope to see performances by leading and famous actors and actresses
 of the big troupes."  Thus, it can be seen that to satisfy the new demands
 of the large number of peasants at the new stage is an urgent task confronting
 the leadership of the party committees at various levels and the departments
 concerned, and also a bounden glorious duty for the broad masses of literary
 and art workers who are determined to serve the people.
 Ours is a big socialist country with a population of 1 billion, of which
 800 million are peasants.  Doing a good job of rural cultural and art work
 is of great significance to overall socialist construction and especially
 to the building of a spiritual civilization.   Serving 800 million peasants
 is where the future of the development of various literary and art under-
 takings lies.  There exists a large audience and body of readers and a vast
 cultural and art "market," and there is ample scope for utilizing the
 abilities of literary and art workers there.   Only when a genuine and proper
 job is done in rural cultural and art work can we be regarded as having taken
 care of the peasants in satisfying the people's needs for spiritual nourish-
 ment.  Developing rural culture and art work is not only a question of
 culture but also a question of politics.  Only if rural culture and art
 work are done well can we create the necessary spiritual conditions for

 promoting cooperation between city and countryside, strengthening the worker-
 peasant alliance, and gradually reducing the difference between city and
 countryside and between industry and agriculture.  Our multitudinous
 minority nationalities mostly reside in the vast countryside, mountainous
 areas and border regions.  Only when a better job is done in rural culture
 and art work can the backwardness in the cultural development of the minority
 nationalities be brought to an end; this is a problem left over from
 history.  In building culture in the border rural areas and pastoral areas,
 there is a serious need to resist capitalist and social imperialist cultural
 infiltration and to struggle against antagonistic ideologies and culture.
 This task is extremely arduous and requires long, hard struggle.  Only in
 so doing can success be achieved.
 In his report on government work delivered at the 4th session of the 5th NPC,
 Comrade Zhao Ziyang made a profound exposition of the relationship between
 socialist cultural and material development:  "In the work of socialist
 modernization, we must strive for a high level of both material and cultural
 development.  The two are inseparable.  Only by doing this can we ensure
 the sustained growth of the national economy and the socialist orientation
 of material development."  The experiences of quite a few rural communes
 and their subdivisions have proved, both positively and negatively, that
 doing a good job of cultural development is a guarantee for material develop-
 ment and can play a motive and promotive role; when things do. not go well,
 it might play a negative role; abandoning cultural development means letting
 capitalist and feudal cultural trends spread unchecked.  This will inevitably
 play a disruptive role in the rural situation of stability and unity.   The
 view and opinion that regard rural cultural work as "singing and dancing,
 chatting and laughing, playing and fooling around and of being of no importance"
 and neglecting it are extremely harmful and detrimental to the all-round
 construction of a new countryside.  We must proceed from a strategical per-
 spective and from the great task of bringing up new socialist peasants who
 can get a good grip on the building of rural culture step by step.   In
 particular, we must not ignore the building of rural culture in remote
 districts where feudal and superstitious activities are rampant and in
 frontier areas where the cultural struggle is acute.
 In the present rural culture and art work, one striking new problem is un-
 balanced development; one prominent demand is to closely combine populariza-
 tion with the raising of standards and to correctly handle the relationship
 between popularization and the raising of standards both in ideology and
 work.   Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:   "By the raising of standards, we
 mean the raising of standards on the basis of popularization; by popu-
 larization, we mean popularization under the guidance of the raising of
 standards."  The popularization of rural culture and art means giving more
 healthy, progressive and revolutionary nourishment to the broad masses
 of peasants and, proceeding from this, it is necessary to enrich their
 cultural life, foster their ideology and morality, arouse their revolutionary
 spirit, and at the same time raise their levels of science, education and
 health so as to bring into full play their roles in building the socialist

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 material civilization and spiritual civilization.  Our culture and art must
 not only suit the acceptance and appreciation abilities of
 the
 great
 numbers of peasants but also continuously foster and raise
 the
 levels
 of their acceptance and appreciation abilities so that they
 can
 steadily
 widen their realm of thought to include knowledge of aesthetic
 perception,
 By doing this we can achieve genuine popularization and really
 raise
 standards.  The practices of indulging in self-admiration and cutting
 oneself off from the masses will not play any role at all.  We mean this
 in terms of the interrelations between popularization and the raising of
 standards and the general goal.   In terms of work, it is necessary to treat
 the relations between popularization and the raising of standards according
 to different cases, each having its own stress.  Seen from the present
 situation in which rural cultural life is relatively animated but is
 developing unevenly, first and foremost, much work is still required in
 order to popularize it extensively.  Take the structure of rural culture
 and art work for example.  Throughout the nation there are still some
 prefectures,  (municipalities, autononmous prefectures and leagues) which
 have no mass cultural palaces; a considerable number of counties have no
 libraries and cultural palaces; more than half of the communes have not
 yet set up cultural centers, and the communes which have set up cultural
 centers and initially formed cultural services are very few in number.
 Quite a few counties and communes and particularly those in mountainous
 border areas, the areas where minority nationalities reside, and the
 frontier regions have no cinemas and theaters; quite a few production
 brigades and production teams have no cultural rooms or clubs; in quite
 a few regions there are no places for the peasants, herdsmen and fishermen
 to read books and newspapers and no places for them to engage in recreational
 activities.  Owing to the lack of genuine cultivation of the idea. of serving
 the countryside, some localities and departments. have attached insufficient
 importance to rural. cultural and art work.   For instance, some localities
 pay excessive attention to the construction of cinemas and theaters in
 market towns. This is of course correct, but they relax the leadership and
 management over rural film projection units, thus giving rise to the phenomena
 in which some film projection units only concern themselves with revenue
 and only want to show films in economically prosperous places which have
 good transportation services.  There are also phenomena in which some
 vocational performing art troupes as well as actors and actresses are afraid
 of difficulties and hardships and unwilling to put on performances in the
 rural areas.  Under these circumstances, although the localities with
 fairly good conditions have built new cultural facilities such as rural
 cinemas and theaters, they have not played their proper role in rural
 cultural services because there is no way to guarantee fixed performances
 or cultural activities.  Therefore, it is imperative to proceed from actual
 conditions and get a good grip on popularization work.   In accordance with
 the principle of adapting demands to possibilities, it is necessary to
 gradually develop more rural cultural facilities by relying chiefly on
 the strength of the collective economy of the communes and their subdivisions.
 Special consideration should be given to the needs of regions where peasants
 find it difficult to enjoy cultural life.   The state should support them
 in this respect as much as possible.  When performing art troupes go to the
 countryside, they must try their best to give performances in these regions.

 The localities where the popularization work of the rural culture and art
 is done fairly well must put on their important agenda the raising.of the
 standard of art cultivation of the cultural and art workers and the
 quality of art production.   "The people want popularization and then the
 standards raised.  They want the standards to be improved year by year and
 month by month."  If we invariably cling to the pattern of "men, hands,
 mouths, knives, cows and sheep" and have. not for a long time improved the
 ideological contents and the quality of art and technical level, our work
 will deviate from the practical requirements and from the people, and the
 masses will not want to see it and will voice many complaints.
 The raising of the standards of culture and art, first and foremost, means
 improving the ideological content, the creative quality and the level of
 aesthetics.   In regard to cultural administrative departments, it is
 imperative to exert strenuous efforts together with the various associations
 of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to grasp well creations
 and provide the vast numbers of peasants with more and better nourishment.
 Last year the Ministry of Culture called a symposium on creating rural
 subject matter and sponsored performances of traditional operas and quyu
 (folk art forms including ballad-singing and storytelling) before fellow
 artists, encouraged creations on rural themes and awarded a number of fine
 works.  The propaganda and cultural departments of the CCP committees of
 various localities have paid close attention to creation in this field and
 are mobilizing and organizing writers and artists to go deep in the country-
 side, go down to grassroots units and immerse themselves among the masses
 to learn about the situation, observe and learn from real life and engage
 in creation.  Many rural amateur writers are also enthusiastically carrying
 out creative work.  In the past few years, great changes have taken place
 in the countryside.   In the countryside a host of new people and new things,
 good people and good deeds have emerged, a scene of inspiring people with
 enthusiasm which can help up broaden our horizon and expand the ideological
 realm, thus creating very favorable conditions for creating rural subject
 matter and constantly improving the ideological contents and the quality
 of art.  We believe that under the guidance of the policy of letting a
 hundred flowers blossom and weeding through the old to bring forth the
 new, large numbers of fine works that reflect rural real life will constantly
 emerge.
 Another question is the improving of professional skills.   The ways and means
 for raising professional skills are multifarious.  Over the past few years,
 various localities have selected a number of key leadership and professional
 members of the art and cultural palaces, county vocational performing art
 troupes, libraries and film projection units and allowed them to engage in
 advanced studies in their cultural areas, sponsored various vocational
 training classes or training classes in rotation so as to improve the
 vocational levels of the key members of the grassroots literary and art
 activists; the vocational cadres of the art palaces, libraries and film
 companies have directly gone down to give guidance in vocational study of
 training to the communes and their subdivisions.   These practices are
 desirable.   It is necessary in the future to sum up the experiences in this
 respect and push these practices forward a step further on the existing
 foundation and carry them out in a better way.

 Here I would particularly like to'discuss the questions of the vocational
 performing art troupes persisting in going to and performing in the country-
 side and mountainous areas and to the raising of level professional work.
 The distribution of China's performing art troupes is very irrational owing
 to historical and practical causes.  The vocational performing art troupes
 are too concentrated in some big and medium-sized cities.  Over the past
 few years, although the performing art troupes of the big and medium-sized
 cities have more frequently given performances in the rural areas, they
 have not paid due attention to this work, resulting in an abnormal pheno-
 menon in which there has been a fall in the attendance at performances in
 cities put on by some opera troupes, very few vocational performing art
 troupes have staged performances in rural areas and the peasants have not
 been able to see any operas.   In the future, all kinds of vocational
 performing art troupes at various levels must organize a contingent of
 handpicked actors and actresses of great attainment and go to the country-
 side to give performances to the large numbers of peasants with simple
 and convenient stage properties and good programs.  This must be made a
 regular practice and systematized.  We hold that the troupes at central,
 provincial, municipal and autonomous regional levels should devote
 15 to 30 percent of their time in a year to giving performances in the
 countryside and mountainous areas; those at municipal level, about half
 of their time, and those at prefectural and county levels at least two-thirds
 of their time to putting on performances mainly in the countryside (pastoral
 areas).  Since the art types are different, the number of performances might
 also vary.   The performing art troupes have at present difficulties acquiring
 revenue.  Together with the concerted efforts of the financial, agricultural,
 and forestry departments, quite a number of provincial and municipal cultural
 departments have drawn a certain amount of undertaking funds with which they
 gave awards or policy subsidies to the troupes which have done well in the
 work of giving performances in the countryside and mountainous areas.  These
 methods and experiences deserve study and recommendation.
 In going down to the countryside, the vocational performing art troupes have
 three tasks:  to meet the cultural needs of the peasants, improve their
 ideological level and the level of art appreciation; to provide vocational
 coaching to professional art personnel and the key amateur literary and
 art activists and raise their professional skills; and to learn from the
 vast numbers of peasants, grassroots cultural and art workers and amateur
 literary and art activists and improve their ideological quality and artistic
 levels.  Of course, the aim for the vocational performing art troupes to
 go down to the countryside is chiefly to do popularization work, but this
 does not, in the slightest degree, mean that they can weaken their own
 tasks and roles in the work of raising standards.  The performing art troupes
 of big and medium-sized cities, in particular, must all the more put the
 tasks of the raising of standards to an important position.  These kinds of
 performing troupes have numerous famous actors and actresses, strong creative
 forces and high level of performance.  They must not only give the peasants
 brilliant programs but also play an exemplary role for the prefectural,
 county, commune and amateur opera troupes and shoulder the tasks of improving

 professional skills of the actors and actresses of these opera troupes.  As
 for the performing art troupes of the big and medium-cities themselves,
 there is also a problem of raising standards.  It is of great use for laying
 a .foundation for portraying and performing well the life of the peasants
 and raising vocational work to go to the countryside and mountainous areas
 to perform for the peasants, to learn from the peasants and society, to
 acquaint oneself with the new look of the countryside and to substantiate
 one's own ideological cultivation.   In short, doing a proper job in the
 work of vocational performing art troupes in the countryside and mountainous
 areas is both a must in upholding the party's literary and art orientation,
 doing well the work of popularization and the raising of standards and meet-
 ing the growing needs of the peasants and an important measures to raise
 one's own ideological quality and the quality of art.   This kills many
 birds with one stone.  We must have an adequate understanding of this matter.
 The practice over the past few years has proved that doing well and develop-
 ing the rural cultural and art undertakings require vigorous support from
 all trades and professions, and the key to this work lies in whether the
 local party committees attach great importance to it or not.  Wherever the
 party committees attach great importance to rural cultural work, cultural
 and art undertakings spread, develop and improve at a fast rate.  Therefore,
 future rural cultural work depends mainly on local party committees.  Here
 I would like to stress that in times of difficulties, instead of remaining
 inactive to wait for something to happen and grumbling, our rural cultural
 and art workers must try their best to win the concern and support of the
 local party committees and do their utmost to overcome difficulties and
 do their work satisfactorily of their own accord as the vanguard fighters
 and model workers who are active on the rural cultural and artistic front
 have done.  We fervently expect that the vast numbers of writers and artists
 and literary and art departments will  make new contributions to the building
 of a rural socialist spiritual civilization and of cultural and art
 undertakings that will serve 800 million peasants with new practical actions
 in the new year.

 PERSIST IN STUDYING MODERN CHINESE HISTORY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF MARXISM-
 LENINISM-MAO ZEDONG THOUGHT--COMMENTS ON 'FROM THE OPIUM WAR TO THE
 MAY FOURTH MOVEMENT'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 18, 27-29
 [Book review by Qi Longwei [4362 7893 1218]]
 [Text]   Comrade Hu Sheng's monograph "From the Opium War to the May Fourth
 Movement" has been published by the People's Publishing House.   This work
 is an achievement of an author who persisted in studying the history of
 modern China under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.
 I really benefited from reading this book.
 In old China, there were almost no works on the history of modern China
 written from the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism.  At that time, I read many
 books on modern Chinese history which covered the period since the Opium
 War.  These books can be classified into two groups on the basis of content:
 The first group consists of "histories in which the strong preyed on the
 weak" written by apologists for imperialism.  The second group includes
 "histories of internal disturbances and foreign aggression" written by
 landlord and bourgeois literati.   In going all-out to vilify and attack
 the Taiping Rebellion, the reform movement of 1898, the Yihetuan Movement,
 the Revolution of 1911,  ...  These writers aimed at opposing the people's
 great revolution led by the CCP.   Landlord and bourgeois literati always
 oppose studying history from the viewpoint of class and class struggle.
 For example, the old specialist Jian Youwen, who had studied the history
 of the Taiping Rebellion for over 50 years, flatly denied that there were
 classes and class struggles in the modern China and simply negated the
 nature of the Taiping Rebellion as an antifeudalist agrarian revolution.
 Fallacies like this always divorce the reader from the truth of history
 and make him feel as if he is lost in a thick fog.
 While leading the Chinese revolution to win the great victory of liberating
 hundreds of millions of people, Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought also
 put historical studies on the right track.   In seeking the laws of the
 Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong made use of historical materialism
 to draw a series of scientific inferences in the light of the actual situation
 in China.   This forced people to reinterpret Chinese history, which stretches
 back several millennia, especially the history of the last 100 years since
 the Opium War.

 Comrade Mao Zedong said, "We are historical materialists who oppose his-
 torical idealism."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," vol 4, p 1452)  The
 basic principles of historical materialism are the class analysis of class
 society and the analysis of problems from the viewpoint of class struggle.
 The Chinese communists headed by Comrade Mao Zedong found two major con-
 tradictions in modern Chinese society:   the contradiction between imperial-
 ism and the Chinese nation and the contradiction between feudalism and the
 broad masses of people, the former being the most important.   It is against
 the background of these two contradictions that the anti-imperialist, and
 antifeudalist revolution of the Chinese people was sparked and developed.
 Just as Comrade Mao Zedong put it, "The process by which imperialism,
 together with Chinese feudalism, turned China into a semicolony and then a
 colony can also be regarded in another way as the process by which the
 Chinese people resisted imperialism and its running dogs."  ("Selected
 Works of Mao Zedong," vol 2, p 595)
 Only by upholding the viewpoint of class struggle in interpreting the
 history of the last 100 years since the Opium War can we expound scienti-
 fically the objective laws governing the historical development of modern
 China and thus teach the people and serve proletarian politics.
 Comrade Hu Sheng has made great contributions in this aspect.
 In the early 1950's, the People's Publishing House published "Imperialism and
 Chinese Politics" by Comrade Hu Sheng.   In this book, he focused on the most
 important contradiction in modern Chinese society, linked it to extremely
 complicated historical phenomena and thus thoroughly revealed the fact that
 imperialism was the number one enemy of the Chinese people.
 Soon after that, Comrade Hu Sheng published his article "On the Problem
 Concerning the Division of Modern Chinese History Into Periods" in the
 first issue of HISTORICAL STUDIES.   In this article, inspired by the trend
 of anti-imperialist and antifeudalist struggle of the Chinese people, the
 author put forth the original concept of three revolutionary high tides
 reflecting the progressive historical trends of modern China.
 On this basis, Comrade Hu Sheng gradually accumulated the results of his
 research on modern Chinese history and finally managed to write the book
 '.'From the Opium War to the May Fourth Movement."
 Apart from the "preamble," the book is divided into five parts in accordance
 with the concept of three revolutionary high tides:  part 1--"The Opium War
 and the Taiping Agrarian Revolution," covering the two opium wars and the
 Taiping agrarian movement and reflecting the rise and fall of the first
 revolutionary high tide; part 2--"The Shaping of the Semicolonial and Semi-
 feudalist Ruling Order," covering the period from the defeat of the
 Taiping Rebellion in 1864 to the end of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895,
 and during which a new high tide of the Chinese revolution was developing;

 part 3--The Reform Movement of 1898 and the Yihetuan Movement,,"which reflects
 the rise and fall of the second revolutionary high tide; part 4--"The
 Revolution of 1911 Led by the Bourgeoisie," which reflects the third
 revolutionary high tide; and part 5--"The Transition to the New Democratic
 Revolution," which marks the turning from darkness to light.
 There is no doubt that historical science research in our country has made
 unprecedented progress under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong
 Thought since the smashing of the "gang of four," in particular since the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee.   The publication of
 Comrade Hu Sheng's new works is significant proof of this.  However, owing
 to the pernicious influence of the "use of innuendo in writing about
 history" by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques and
 the infiltration of foreign bourgeois thinking, the authors of some articles
 published in newspapers and journals in the last few years have deviated
 from Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and have thrown away the method
 of class analysis in interpreting modern Chinese history.  Under these
 circumstances, the publication of Comrade Hu Sheng's new work is greatly
 needed.  Back in 1951, when discussing the film "The Life of Lu Xun,"
 Comrade Mao Zedong did criticize some writers for "not bothering to find
 out what new economic formations of society, new class forces, new personali-
 ties and ideas had emerged in China during the century and more since the
 Opium War of 1840 in the struggle against the old economic formations and
 their superstructures (politics, culture, and so on), before they decided
 what to commend and praise, what not to, and what to oppose."   ("Selected
 Works of Mao Zedong," vol 5, p 47)   Comrade Mao Zedong called for upholding
 class analysis in making this serious criticism, and this is the right
 method and principle for the study of the history of class society, includ-
 ing the study of modern Chinese history.  This method and principle were
 illustrated throughout the works of Comrade Hu Sheng, where the most
 prominent part is his important insight into the problem of the key to
 modern Chinese history.
 Who represented the progressive trend in modern Chinese history?  A number
 of arguments have been advanced in the historiographical circle in recent
 years.  One of the schools upholds class struggle as the key and advocates
 that modern Chinese history was characterized by agrarian wars, bourgeois
 movements (including reforms and revolutions) and proletarian revolution.
 The other school upholds the abstract hypothesis of the "movement to learn
 from the West" as the key, and puts forth the new concept of "Westerniza-
 tion-reform-revolution."  According to the logic of the latter, agrarian
 wars such as the Taiping Rebellion, the Yihetuan Movement and so on should
 be excluded from the main trend of modern Chinese history and be replaced
 with the Westernization movement which was promoted by the feudal rulers.
 Comrade Hu Sheng stuck to his clear-cut stand in opposing such logic.
 In the preamble of "From the Opium War to the May Fourth Movement," he
 solemnly declared,  "The author of this book does not think that there is
 any reason to depict the progressive historical trend in this period in
 48

 the light of the trend of 'Westernization movement--reform movement of
 1898--revolution of 1911."'  I wholeheartedly agree with Comrade Hu Sheng
 on this point and realize that his opinion conforms with Mao Zedong Thought
 and the viewpoint of class struggle.
 It is necessary to make a class analysis of the hypothesis of the "movement
 to learn from the West."  In the course of modern Chinese history, the
 peasant class, the bourgeois reformers and the bourgeois revolutionaries
 all learned from the West.  As pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong,  "Since
 the defeat of the Opium War of 1840, progressive Chinese underwent
 innumerable-hardships-in seeking the truth from Western countries.   Hong
 Xiuquan, Kang Youwei, Yan Fu and Sun Yat-sen were the representatives of
 those personages who sought the truth in the West's experiences before the
 founding of the CCP." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," vol 4, p 1406)   The
 four historical personages mentioned here were precisely the representatives
 of the Chinese peasant class and the national bourgeoisie (including reform-
 ers and revolutionaries) during the period of the democratic revolution
 of the old type.  Leading the progressive trend in history, they "learned
 from the West" in order to save China.  Why did not Comrade Mao Zedong
 classify the representatives of the feudal nobility, warlords and bureau-
 crats such as Yixin, Li Hongzhang, Zhang Zhidong and so on, who promoted
 "Westernization," in the same group?  The reason is that these people did
 not follow the progressive trend of history but went against it.
 The focus of the problem is that we must use the viewpoint of class struggle
 to assess the Westernization group and the Westernization movement.  We
 should not compare the present to the past and thus "prettify" the Westerni-
 zation group and the Westernization movement, under the pretext that our
 country is now importing technologies and equipment from foreign countries
 to promote the "four modernizations."  The Westernization movement occurred
 after the Second Opium War ended.  To assist the Qing government in
 "exterminating the Taiping and Nian rebels,"the foreign imperialist invaders
 tried by every means to arm the Qing army with "foreign rifles" and
 "foreign cannons."  The Hunan army and the Anhui army fighting against the
 Taiping army in Jiangsu and Zhejiang used weapons supplied by Britain and
 France; the "Eight Banners Army" guarding the Beijing and Tianjin region
 used weapons given by Russia.   The people in authority in the feudal ruling
 class then began to split into two groups:   the diehard group persisted in
 "closing the country to international intercourse," while the Westernization
 group called for "self-strengthening by learning foreign ways."  The
 latter group met the needs of the invasion of foreign capitalists better
 than the former group.  As pointed out by Comrade Hu Sheng in chapter 10 of
 the new book, "The Westernization group emerged under the historical condi-
 tions of the feudal landlord class turning into a pillar supporting the rule
 of imperialism in China."  How should we respond to imperialist aggression?
 The Westernization group flaunted their tactics of "pitting the foreigners
 against each other."  However, as pointed out by Comrade Hu Sheng in
 chapter 14 of the new book,  "The so-called tactic of 'pitting the foreigners
 against each other' was by no means a tactic in which the country made use
 49

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 of the contradictions between the imperialist powers independently and on
 its own initiative, but rather a practice of trusting the country's sur-
 vival to the contradictions between the imperialist powers."  The tactic
 of "pitting the foreigners against each other" was in essence a kind of
 capitulationism.   The Westernization group promoted first the "training of
 army" and then the "manufacture of armaments."  Their efforts not only
 gave birth to a number of armies armed with new-type weapons, but also
 brought about the establishment of a small number of industrial branches
 which used foreign machines for production.  However, we cannot claim that
 these developments were new in modern China although none of them had
 ever been seen in feudal China.  We cannot label one of the two belligerent
 parties in a war as a rising force and the other as a decaying force solely
 on the basis of the state of their armaments.   Can we say that the
 Westernization group, which was showing off its "foreign rifles" and
 "foreign cannons" and controlling the modern war industry was new, while
 denouncing as old the peasant armies, which were resisting invasion and
 fighting against feudalism with long spears and broadswords?  There is no
 doubt that the Westernization group borrowed a few "new things" from foreign
 countries.  However, just like the diehards, the Westernization group was
 in fact a decaying force in a certain society and was not qualified to
 represent the progressive trend in history, as they made use of all those
 "new things" to oppose the people's revolution.
 During the period of the Revolution of 1911, Sun Yat-sen, the great revolu-
 tionary forerunner of China, named himself "Hong Xiuquan number two" and
 publicly declared that he was carrying on and developing the cause of
 the Taiping Rebellion; while his antagonist, Yuan Shikai publicly proclaimed
 himself the successor to Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang.   Such a vivid contrast
 reveals very profoundly the existence of two historical trends of different
 natures in modern China; one of them was Red while the other was Black.
 Therefore, the elements of the so-called "Westernization movement-reform
 movement of 1898-Revolution of 1911" can never be linked.
 The academic argument on the trend of modern Chinese history reflects a
 difference in methodology.   Should we uphold class analysis or replace it
 with abstract analogy?  This question deserves a thorough discussion.
 Comrade Hu Sheng's new work is a splendid extract of the rich collection
 of historical materials in which he gives full play to the scientific style
 of "interpretation based'on facts."  For example, owing to the lack of
 material sources,  there has long been a difference of opinion on the issue
 of whether Wei Changhui killed Yang Xiuqing under the "secret edict" sent
 by Hong Xiuquan.   Some writers who did not want people to criticize
 Hong Xiuquan emphasized that the "secret edict" was an out-and-out fabrica-
 tion.  On the other hand, some comrades at the other extreme affirmed the
 veracity of the "secret edict" so as to bolster the claim that Hong Xiuquan
 was responsible.   In the light of the historical materials which have
 been found so far, Comrade Hu Sheng honestly narrates the course of the
 "internal strife between Yang Xiuqing and Wei Changhui" without making any

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 subjective judgment.  In chapter 5 of the new book, he writes, "Some sources
 said that he was instructed by Hong Xiuquan to kill Yang Xiuqing.  This
 is probably true.  As for the issue of whether he did make use and in what
 way he made use of Hong Xiuquan's name in magnifying the murder of
 Yang Xiuqing into a large-scale massacre, there is no proof at all."
 What a serious attitude this is:  In the eyes of Comrade Hu Sheng, we can
 only correctly sum up historical experiences and make them serve the con-
 struction of socialist modernization today as long as we strictly adhere
 to historical materials and respect facts.   In the foreword of the sixth
 edition of "Imperialism and Chinese Politics," he wrote,  "Only by completely
 liberating itself from the rule and oppression of imperialism and thoroughly
 overthrowing the Chinese reactionary classes which were the tools of
 imperialism could China 'genuinely achieve unity of the country, democracy
 for the people and prosperity of the country's economy.   Imperialists would
 never give up their goal of destroying by every means the revolutionary
 cause of the Chinese people.  The national independence of China could never
 be achieved under the leadership of the bourgeoisie but only under the
 leadership of the proletariat.   In order to make all these matters clear to
 readers, the author of the book does not need to distort the truth of
 historical facts.  On the contrary, the deeper he goes into the essential
 and regular aspect of historical facts, the more clearly he can expound on
 history."  This is really a splendid exposition, and his new book "From the
 Opium War to the May Fourth Movement" is based on such a scientific spirit.
 By his own practice, Comrade Hu Sheng shows us that historical materials can
 never take the place of historiography; historical materials must undergo
 class analysis.  However, historiographic practices must be based on a rich
 collection of historical materials and must be. adhered to so as to achieve
 an integration of historical materials and historical interpretation.
 Historical interpretations made on the basis of historical analogy and
 under the guidance of pragmatism are always groundless.
 Comrade Hu Sheng's book is written in a vivid and compendious style.   For
 example, he reveals the traitorous nature of the Westernization group's
 diplomatic policy of "pitting foreigners against each other," using the
 Chinese idiom "inviting wolves into the house."  Under the the title "The
 Old Viceroys Under the New Cloak of Commanders-in-Chiefs," he profoundly
 exposes the true colors of some reactionary bureaucrats who, in order to
 preserve their own strength, used the revolution for their own ends during
 the stormy period of 1911.  He also uses the saying "prohibiting others
 from participating in revolution" from "The True Story of An Q" by Lu Xun
 to sharply denounce the criminal deeds of those bureaucrats who pretended
 to be revolutionary and those warlords who put down the people's uprisings.
 The theories of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought are integrated with
 abundant historical materials and presented in a fluent and vivid writing
 style--this is the distinguishing feature of the new book by Comrade Hu Sheng.

 Of course the book does have some defects.   A more profound elaboration is
 necessary on certain theoretical problems; and there are some inaccuracies
 in the verification of certain historical. facts.  We suggest that the
 author revise all these points before the book is reprinted.
 The number of printings of this book's first edition was too small and

 LAY A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR THEORETICAL STUDY BY CADRES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 p 30
 [Article in "Comment and Study" column by Li Xu [7812 2485]]
 [Text]   In a cadre's theoretical study, it is necessary to emphasize the
 laying of a good foundation in the theory of Marxism.
 Marxism comprises philosophy, political economics and scientific socialism.
 These are interrelated and embody each other.   These three components make
 up the complete scientific system of Marxism and equip the proletariat and
 the revolutionary masses with an ideological weapon and a guide for action
 in the course of understanding the world situation, transforming the world
 and accomplishing the great goals of communism.   Mao Zedong Thought is the
 application and development of Marxism in China.   Its main content and
 lively spirit have already been expounded on in the resolution of the 6th
 Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee.  Laying a good founda-
 tion means primarily mastering the fundamental knowledge of Marxism-Leninism-
 Mao Zedong Thought and understanding the fundamental principles.   A further
 requirement is mastering the Marxist stand, views and approaches which run
 through the principles, enabling them to become our own guiding ideology and
 the criteria for judging our words and deeds.   The fundamental. task of our
 cadres at all levels is to popularize Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought
 among the masses, organize and arm the masses with Marxism-Leninism-Mao
 Zedong Thought, and lead the masses in implementing the party's line,,
 principles and policies and in realizing the targets of struggle put forth
 by the party.  Therefore, whether a good theoretical foundation has been
 laid is of primary significance for whether a cadre can do a good job in
 his practical work and fulfill all his obligations.
 Some people might think that this is a "platitude" and may even object to
 it.  However, reality has proved once again that without a theoretical
 foundation, or without a firm one, people will waver, be led astray or even
 make mistakes.  For instance, some people treat emancipating the mind and
 upholding the four basic principles as two contradictory things.   To them,
 emancipating the mind means discarding the "four uphold's" and promoting
 bourgeois liberalization.  On the other hand, some think that advocating
 the "four upholds" means advocating a rigid way of thinking and negating

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 the need to emancipate the mind.   Some people tend to neglect centralism
 when they stress democracy; some neglect discipline when they stress free-
 dom; some neglect ideological and political work when they stress material
 interests, or vice versa.   In summing up historical experiences, people
 either affirm or negate everything.  As far as the question of ideology
 is concerned, it seems that opposing all "left" things and not doing
 things in simplified and rude ways means being weak and lax and abandoning
 leadership, and so on.  All these are, in fact, closely related with a
 shaky theoretical foundation.  As some comrades say:  "When people cannot
 tell what is right or wrong in theory, they are bound to waver, politically,
 and they will act blindly."  Only by working hard to lay a good foundation
 and actually improve one's Marxist theoretical level can we overcome such
 wavering, one-sidedness and blindness and avoid making "left" or right
 mistakes.
 Economic construction is now the focus of all our work.  Whether there is
 a Marxist economic theoretical foundation is closely related to whether
 we can do a good job in economic work.   In the past, we did not attach
 importance to research on the Marxist theory of reproduction or research
 on the laws governing a socialist economy.  As a result, we could not avoid
 making those mistakes which could have been avoided.  Now, there is still
 a number of cadres playing leading roles in economic construction who lack
 the basic knowledge of economic theory.   It is undeniable that this is a
 major factor accounting for the backward situation, low productivity and
 poor economic results in certain units.
 In order to lay a good foundation, it is essential to conscientiously study
 some basic works on Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, to uphold the
 principle of integrating theory with practice, and to integrate the study
 of theory and summing up of experiences with the transformation of our
 world outlook.  Many of our comrades adhere to all these things in their
 actual practice.  However, owing to the long-term sabotage of Lin Biao and
 the "gang of four," the sinister trend of paying no attention to theoretical
 study or to transforming their world outlook still exists among some comrades.
 It is for this reason that their words and deeds are always different or
 even'deviate from the Marxist stand, views and approaches.  Such a situation
 does not accord with the obligation of each cadre or the demands of socialist
 construction, and we must strive to overcome it.

 AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT GUIDING THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM--
 STUDYING COMRADE CHEN YUN'S  'NEW PROBLEMS AFTER THE BASIC COMPLETION OF
 SOCIALIST TRANSFORMATION'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2,  16 Jan 82 pp 31-34
 [Article by You Lin [2589 2651]]
 [Text]   Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, with
 economic readjustment as the core, we have undertaken local and experimental
 reforms on the system of economic management, and have made remarkable
 achievements.  Now, our task in this regard, just as Comrade Zhao Ziyang
 pointed out in his government work report, lies in summing up the reform
 experiences of the previous period, undertaking thorough and careful
 investigations and studies, and conducting repeated scientific discussions
 and demonstrations in order to formulate in the shortest time possible an
 overall plan for reforming the economic management system and to gradually
 implement such a plan.  Under such circumstances, it is especially heart-
 warming when we read once again Comrade Chen Yun's talk "New Problems After
 the Basic Completion of Socialist Transformation" at the Eighth National
 Congress of the Communist Party of China.
 Since this talk of Comrade Chen Yun's was given 20-odd years ago, the actual
 situation has undergone great changes.  However, the problems pointed out
 in his talk still exist, the measures conceived are still applicable, the
 basic perceptions regarding economic management are still of realistic
 significance.   For these reasons, this talk should be regarded as an important
 document for guilding the restructuring of our economic management system
 and be very well studied.
 In his talk, Comrade Chen Yun affirmed the great achievements of the socialist
 transformation, analyzed the problems that had emerged, elaborated the
 measures that should be taken, and in particular he presented the basic
 perception regarding the would-be conditions of the socialist economy of
 our country at the present stage.  He said:   "The conditions of our socialist
 economy will be as follows:   in industrial and commercial management, the
 state and collective operations will comprise the main part, but with a
 certain amount of individual operations.  Such individual operations are a

 supplement to the state and collective operations.  Regarding production
 planning, the majority of the industrial and agricultural products of the
 whole country will be produced according to plans.  In the meantime, however,
 a part of the products will be produced freely according to the variations
 of the market and within the scope permitted by the state plans.  Planned
 production will be the main part of industrial and agricultural production,
 while the free production dictated by market variations and permitted by
 the state will be a supplement to the planned production.   For this reason,
 the market of our country will never be the free market of capitalism,
 but a unified market of socialism.   In the unified market of socialism,
 the state market comprises the main part, supplemented by a free market
 of certain scope under the guidance of the state.  Being under the guidance
 of the state and a supplement to the state market, such a free market is a
 component of the socialist unified market."  In the following, I would like
 to present my understanding of three aspects of the above passage of high
 generality with reference to Comrade ChenYun's whole article as well as
 other articles.
 Here, first of all, Comrade Chen Yun very clearly points out that at the
 present stage in our country the basic form of social economy comprises the
 socialist state economy and the collective economy with a certain amount
 of individual economic entities participating in labor as a necessary supple-
 ment to the socialist public ownership system.  In a socialist country like
 ours, the state economy must predominate.  Otherwise, economic life will be
 thrown into confusion and the overall interests of the state will not be
 ensured.  However, it is impossible and unnecessary for the state to take
 charge of all enterprises regardless of their size, whether large, medium,
 or small, and to take charge of all their products regardless of their
 importance, whether primary products or secondary products.   If the state
 takes charge of all such things while barely having the strength to do so,
 very unfavorable consequences will follow, as. shown by facts of the past.
 The conditions of the relations of production depend upon the conditions
 of the productive forces.  The large enterprises represent socialized
 large production.  As determined by their very nature, they need to be
 possessed and controlled by the whole society and should be, or rather
 must be, operated by the state, the representative of the society.  As to
 the small enterprises and a part of the medium-sized enterprises which
 basically employ manual labor and have a low level of mechanization, they
 are suitable for collective operation and some are only suitable for
 individual operation.  However, we did not make such distinctions in the
 past.   In the latter stage of the three great transformations mistakes appear-
 ed in demands being too urgent, crude and careless work, excessive speed
 of change, oversimplification and unification of forms, and so on.   The
 above generalization made by Comrade Chen Yun was directed at such situations.
 Then, we persisted in "promotions" and "transitions" and hastily "promoted"
 the handicraft cooperatives to state factories and the cooperative stores
 to state stores. Even the newly established collective ownership enter-
 prises were also "promoted" without a moment's thought.   This "promoted"
 the genuine collective ownership enterprises owned and run by the broad

 masses of the people to enterprises belonging to the neighborhoods, districts,
 and municipalities, or in other words, to enterprises of "collective" owner-
 ship possessed and controlled by various levels of local governments.  With
 such a situation, the state economy became almost the sole economic form
 in the cities.   Consequently, this was very unfavorable to mobilizing the
 enthusiasm of all concerned, causing the decrease in varieties of products
 and the down-grading of quality and causing the diverse and ever-changing
 demands of the consumers to fail to be better satisfied.
 As indicated by the conclusion of historical experience and the analysis of
 the actual situation of our country, in the cities it is not only necessary
 to work hard to develop the collective ownership economy of the laboring
 masses and the individual economy of the working people in a proper way,
 but also to carry out the necessary reform of state enterprises.  The small
 enterprises as well as part of the medium-sized enterprises that produce
 general products should be allowed to operate on the basis of responsibility
 for their own profits and losses.   The important departments such as banking,
 railway transportation, civil aviation, posts and telecommunication, and so
 on, should be operated by the state.  The same is true of the large enter-
 prises as well as a part of the medium-sized enterprises in such fields as
 the iron and steel industry, nonferrous metal industry, the fuel industry,
 electricity generation, machine building industry, chemical engineering,
 construction materials, textiles, and light industry, as well as other
 industries.  Only by commanding these departments and industries can the
 state control the economic lifeline and play its leading role over the
 diversified economic forms.  The owner of this category of enterprises
 should be the entire working people, and the workers of these enterprises
 are only a part of the entire working people.   Since the managers of these
 enterprises run these organizations in the capacity of representatives of the
 state, the enterprises must produce and operate in conformity with the plans
 of the state, and profits must be handed over to the state as stipulated.
 Of course, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the enterprises the
 state should also give the enterprises certain authority and profits.  However,
 they cannot produce and operate independently, nor be responsible for their
 own profits and losses, as are the small enterprises and a part of the medium-
 sized enterprises mentioned above.
 Next, Comrade Chen Yun pointed out that planned production should constitute
 the main part of industrial and agricultural production and be supplemented
 at the same time by free production as dictated by variations of the market
 and permitted by the state plans.   It is upon the foundation of public
 ownership that we must bring about our planned economy and give play at the
 same time to the supplementary function of regulation by market mechanism.
 The planned economy, the national economy run consciously in accordance
 with present plans,  is closely related to the system of public ownership.
 It comes into being with the system of public ownership as its foundation
 and shows an important side of the economic essence of socialism.   It is
 undeniable that the socialist economy must be developed in a planned way.
 However, the scope and extent of planning depends upon the degree of public
 ownership.  With the present level of productive force in our country, we

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 are far from the completion of the socialization of the entire means of
 production, as a commodity production still exists, making it impossible to
 include the entire social production in a single unified plan and to carry
 on production and operation entirely according to plans without regulation
 by the market mechanism.  The following procedure is more in line with the
 actual situation:   first, the important economic departments, the large
 enterprises and a part of the medium-sized enterprises should be owned by
 the state.   It is these enterprises which produce and operate according
 to the unified plan of the state.  As these departments and enterprises
 predominate in the national economy with their production and operation
 carried on according to plans and coupled with the unified purchasing and
 assigned purchasing of farm produce which in practice constitute production
 by plans, planned production is ensured as the main part of our industrial
 and agricultural production.  Second, the other category of enterprises
 (the collective ownership enterprises and state enterprises with
 responsibility for their own profits and losses) should produce and operate
 freely according to the fluctuations of the market and within the scope
 permitted by the plans.  Should these enterprises be guided by the state
 plans?  Very much so.   In addition to such measures as taxation, credit,
 pricing, and soon, reference targets can also be passed down.  All these
 measures are used to channel the production and operation of these enter-
 prises as much as possible into the state plan and to subject the regulation
 by market mechanism to the guidance of state planning.  The trouble with our
 planned management system is that everything is listed in the plans and
 everything is controlled by plans.  As a result, the economy becomes very
 rigid.   In brief, what should have been put under strict planning has not
 been so planned and controlled, whereas what should not have been included
 in the plan was.  Comrade Chen Yun has always been opposed to such practices.
 In his article, he pointed out that products such as consumer goods for
 everyday use, handicraft products, small local products and so on, with only
 very few exceptions, should not be included in state plans.  The requirements
 of the state plans regarding the output value of these products, the reduc-
 tion of costs of the consumer goods for everyday use, and the enhancement
 of labor productivity, as well as other requirements, are only taken as
 reference targets.  The producers are allowed to fix their own targets in
 relation to the market conditions to carry on their production without being
 committed to the reference targets.   These measures, as viewed, are basically
 applicable.
 Recently, when speaking of the relationship between planned economy and
 regulation by market mechanism in his report on government work, Comrade
 Zhao Ziyang quoted the following words of Comrade Chen Yun's in his article
 under discussion:  "Planned production will be the main part of industrial
 and agricultural production, while the free production dictated by market
 fluctuations and permitted by the state plans will be a supplement to
 planned production."  Comrade Zhao Ziyang also pointed out:   "This idea of
 Comrade Chen Yun's is still of realistic and guiding significance to our
 present reform."  Comrade Zhao Ziyang also said:   "We envisage that different
 management methods should be applied to different groups of enterprises in

 terms of the different positions they occupy in the national economy, in
 their ownership system, the importance and categories of their products,
 and the varieties of their specifications.  Generally speaking, there are
 four categories.  To the first category belong those enterprises which
 produce according to the directives of the state plan.  These are the back-
 bone enterprises which command the economic lifeline of the country and
 produce the main products for the national economy and the people's liveli-
 hood, and their output value accounts for the majority of the total output
 value of industry and agriculture despite the fact that the varieties of
 their products are not numerous.  Under the second category are the products
 which are produced according to the fluctuations of the market and within
 the scope permitted by the state plan.  These are the small commodities of
 many different varieties, scattered among and produced by numerous small
 enterprises and individual workers.  It is impossible and inconvenient to
 subject them to unified planning and management.  They only account for
 a small part of the total output value of industry and agriculture.  Between
 these two major categories, there are two more categories of enterprises
 and products.  One category produces most of its products according to the
 state plan and leaves the minority of its products to small enterprises
 which have a free hand in organizing their production.   This category is
 basically similar to the first major category, though not without dissimi-
 larities.                            Another category leaves most of its products to enterprises
 which organize their production according to the fluctuations of the market,
 and the minority of its products to the planned production of the state.
 This category is basically similar to the second major category, also with
 certain dissimilarities.  A management like this differs not only from the
 one we had, which was far too rigid, but also from the market economy of the
 capitalist countries.  It combines the centralized and unified leadership of
 the state and the enthusiasm of the enterprises, and ensures the result of
 control with flexibility, flexibility free of disorder, greater economic
 benefits, and organization and development of production in accordance with
 the needs of society."  This is a very important step with crucial signi-
 ficance to the reform of the management system.
 Lastly, Comrade Chen Yun also pointed out that the state market must comprise
 the main part of the socialist unified market, and be supplemented by the
 free market under the guidance of the state in stipulated terms.  The main
 part of our industrial and agricultural production is planned production.
 Similarly, the main part of our commodity  circulation must also be planned
 circulation.   The important departments and the backbone enterprises must be
 run by the state.  The backbone enterprises of commerce and large stores
 also must be run by the state.   The state market is operated according to
 plans.   In fact, many products such as grain, cloth, and so on, are distributed
 through the market according to plans.  However, the state market can only
 be the main part, but never the whole.  This is to say, aside from the state
 market, there must also be a free market.  Without such a market, the produc-
 tion and development of industry and agriculture will be unfavorably affected
 and the people will be inconvenienced.

 However, very frequently we failed to give such all-round considerations
 to our problems in the past, always thinking that the more unitary our
 ownership system the better, and the less the circulation channels the
 better. As a result, both the unitary aspect of our ownership system and
 the paucity of circulation channels have been achieved only to be accom-
 panied by the monotony of the market and the economic life of the people.
 Actually, such troubles were burgeoning when the three great transforma-
 tions were basically completed.  The measures that were adopted to restrict
 capitalist industry and commerce and proved to be unnecessary after the
 completion of the three great transformations, as mentioned by Comrade
 Chen Yun in his article, all had a bearing on this problem.  All those
 measures needed transformation, and they did undergo alteration at the
 suggestion of Comrade Chen Yun. However, under the subsequent influence
 of the "leftist" guiding principle, no problem was really solved and
 instead problems piled up to give rise gradually to the situation in which
 planned production and distribution ruled with regulation by market mechanism
 reduced to nil and with the commercial sector accepting whatever the
 industrial sector produced, not only in regard to the kind of products but
 also their quantity.  During the readjustment period from 1961 to 1963,
 things were slackened to a certain extent, the rural fairs were revived,
 the commodity circulation under the unified leadership of state commerce
 and with the coexistence,of state commerce, cooperative commerce, and
 rural fair trade was approved, and some municipalities allowed free
 purchasing of handicraft articles.  However, the transformation did not per-
 sist.  As the "Great Cultural Revolution" came along, even worse rigidity
 ruled.
 While pointing out the existing problems, Comrade Chen Yun presented his
 measures to overcome them.   One measure was to replace the processing orders
 placed by the commercial sector on the factories by letting the factories
 purchase the materials and sell the products themselves.  Another measure
 was to replace the monopolistic unified purchase of a part of the unimportant
 agricultural and sideline products such as small local products by the supply
 and marketing cooperatives with free purchasing and free selling by the
 state stores, cooperative stores, cooperative teams, and the supply and
 marketing cooperatives.   If a shortage of supply should occur due to compe-
 titive purchasing, the supply of the goods should be allocated under the
 guidance of the local government according to the order of urgency in regard
 to the needs of the various units.   Still another measure was to implement
 price policies that stimulated production, which included pricing by quality,
 free purchasing, free fluctuation of prices of small local products which
 were allowed to be peddled freely, and so on.  We should carefully study the
 measures presented by Comrade Chen Yun to provide solutions for the problems
 that existed, and then substantiate and develop them in the light of the
 new situation in order to ensure the practical and reliable implementation
 of the principle that the state market should comprise the main part and be
 supplemented by the free market.

 To sum up, in his article, Comrade Chen Yun has laid the fundamental basis
 for the reform of our economic system in respect of ownership structure,
 production management and circulation management.  We should put his
 concepts into a concrete form in the light of the specific situation at
 present, and plan our reforms in the several aspects of planning and the
 management systems of finance, taxation, prices, banking, commerce and
 wages.

 QUESTION:   IN OUR PRESENT EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT THE ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY
 SYSTEM, WE EMPHASIZE INTEGRATING RESPONSIBILITY, POWER AND INTERESTS; HOW
 DOES THIS RELATE TO INTEGRATING THE THREE INTERESTS OF THE STATE, THE
 COLLECTIVE AND THE INDIVIDUAL OF WHICH WE USUALLY SPEAK?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 34-35
 [Article in "Questions and Answers" column by Li Guangyuan [2621 0342 6678]]
 [Text]  Answer:   The integration of the interests of the state, the collec-
 tive and the individual worker is the basic principle in accordance with
 which the relationships of socialist economic interests are handled.   The
 integration of responsibility, power and interests, as embodied in the
 socialist economic responsibility system, is a means of effecting the
 integration and simultaneous growth of the interests of the state, the
 collective and the individual worker.  The integration of responsibility,
 power and interest must be subordinate to the requirements of the principle
 of the integration of the interests of the state, the collective and the
 individual worker.  Why do we say this?
 Socialist public ownership is a system whereby individual workers jointly
 exercise ownership.  Workers are masters of the state and the collective.
 Therefore, the interests of the state are tantamount to the common interests
 of all individual workers, and also tantamount to the common interests of
 all workers' collectives.   The interests of a collective are tantamount to
 the common interests of a specified group of workers.  The ultimate aim of
 all activities of the state and the collectives is to bring about the
 constant growth of the interests of all individual workers.  This objective
 relationship of interests gives rise to the principle of the integration
 of the interests of the state, the collective and the individual.  The main
 substance of this principle includes the following:   First, due consideration
 must be given to the interests of the three parties, because although the
 interests of the three parties coincide there are also conflicts of interests
 between them.  Therefore, we can and we should give due consideration to
 their interests.  Second, the individual's interests must be subordinated
 to those of the state and the collective.  The interests of the collective
 must be subordinated to those of the state.  This is because the common
 interests of a community are above and more important than the interests of
 any individual or any part of the whole community..  The former is the basis

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 on which the latter can be safeguarded.  For example, the strengthening of
 the state and the development of the national economy constitute the basis
 on which improvement of the individual's livelihood can be ensured.  Third,
 enhancement of the interests of the collective and the state serves the
 ultimate purpose of promoting and safeguarding the enhancement. of the
 interests of all individual workers.  What is "taken from the people" must
 ultimately be given to the people."  .
 Generally speaking, the 'integration of responsibility, power and interests
 is not a principle peculiar to socialist economic relationship.  It is a
 principle universally applicable to all categories of relationships of
 commodity exchange, because any commodity exchange relationship is tantamount
 to a contract relationship.  Whether contracts are written or not,  this
 relationship always, determines some sort of integration of the. responsibility,
 power and interests of the two parties under consideration.  When one party
 assumes responsibility for supplying commodities to the other party, it will
 correspondingly acquire the power to obtain a supply of commodities from the
 other party and will hence gain certain benefits.  Various essentially
 different commodity exchange relationships give rise to essentially different
 ways' of integration of responsibility, power and interests.
 The integration of-responsibility, power and interests in the socialist
 economy is radically and essentially different from the integration of
 responsibility, power and interests of commodity exchange relationships
 under private ownership.  The difference is that in the exchange of commodities
 under private ownership, such integration is a means of safeguarding the
 conflicting private interests of various owners of private property; whereas
 in the socialist economy, such integration is a means of achieving the inte-
 gration of the interests of the state, the collective and the individual
 workers as well as a means of safeguarding the simultaneous enhancement of
 these three parties' benefits.   In the exchange of commodities under private
 ownership, the two opposing parties are owners of private property with con-
 flicting interests.,  Each of them only cares about its own private gain, and
 supplying commodities to the other party is only a means of achieving private
 gain.  Therefore, each party strives to give as little as possible and take
 as much as possible.   Transactions are concluded after bargaining between
 the two parties. because they are forced to do so by the spontaneous compe-
 tition in the market. In socialist economic-relations, the parties between
 whom conflicts exist are three parties whose interests coincide, namely,
 the individual worker, the worker's own collective and his own state.   Each
 party cares about the integration of the three parties' interests, aside
 from its own interests.   In. the socialist economy, responsibility, power
 and interests are integrated.  They are also divided between various parties
 in the light of the specific circumstances of the development of the socialist
 cause and in the light of various specific conditions of the state, the
 collective and the individual.   Such integration and division are aimed at
 the simultaneous enhancement of the interests of?the three parties, and are
 decided and carried out in'a planned way. If so, then how does the integration
 of-responsibility, power and interests serve the integration and enhancement
 of the interests of the state, the collective and the individual?

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 First, in practicing the economic responsibility system, we must specifically
 determine the responsibility, power and interests to be assigned to various
 parties and also determine the mutually restrictive relationship between
 responsibility, power and interests.  Thus, we can have specific criteria
 and methods for integrating the interests of the state, the collective and
 the individual.  With these criteria and methods, everyone will know how
 he can make contributions and how greater contributions will benefit both
 the whole community and himself.  Thus, we will be able to do away with
 egalitarianism and "eating out of one big pot," which is characterized by
 confusion about what responsibilities each should shoulder, ignorance of
 what is right or wrong, unclear rewards and punishments, and equal pay to
 all regardless of the amount of work done.  When these things are done
 away with, the enthusiasm of all parties can be mobilized so that they will
 all do their best to make greater contributions to the simultaneous enhance-
 ment of the interests of the three parties.
 Second, when we determine the responsibility, power and interests to be
 assigned to various parties in practicing the economic responsibility
 system, we must proceed from the principle of integrating the interests of
 the three parties and avoiding one-sidedness.   For example, why must we
 specify comprehensive targets for assessing the work of industrial enterprises
 that practice the economic responsibility system?  In addition to targets
 for profits, why must we also require the enterprises to produce marketable
 products, raise product quality, reduce the consumption of resources and
 promote industrial safety?   In practicing the reward system, why must average
 advanced quotas be taken as the basis?  The reason is that these are required
 by the basic principle of the integration of the interests of the three
 parties.   In instituting the system of responsibility in rural production,
 what forms should be adopted?  What should be centralized?  What should be
 decentralized?  Should the basic figures in contracts be high or low?
 These should all be determined according to what measures will be conducive
 to the integration and enhancement of the interests of the three parties
 in various circumstances.
 Lastly, we must more vigorously educate the cadres and the masses in the
 ideologies of patriotism and collectivism.  We must both overcome the
 tendency of neglecting the individual interests of the masses and oppose
 individualism and departmental selfishness.  Thus everyone can really realize
 the coincidence of the interests of the three parties and consider themselves
 to be masters of society.  The majority of peasants and rural cadres not
 only hope for increased individual income, but also want to make the greatest
 possible contributions to the state and the collective.  The majority of
 workers and cadres of enterprises wish to share the burden of the state and
 enhance the state's gains, and they consider the retention of profits by
 the enterprises and the distribution of bonuses to workers to be of less
 importance.   This is the main trend.   It is precisely this socialist ideology
 and collectivist spirit of the masses and the cadres that enables the
 practicing of the responsibility system to bring about the fine situation
 of continuous development in production and simultaneous enhancement of the

 interests of the state, the collective and the individual.  However, we
 must also note that a minority of people still do not consider themselves
 to be masters.   In viewing socialist economic relations, they are still
 accustomed to those concepts concerning responsibility, power and gains
 that are characteristic of commodity exchange relationship under.px4vate
 ownership.  They only want to gain greater benefits for themselves.  They
 disregard the overall situation of the socialist cause and even try by
 all means to exploit, to their own advantage, "loopholes" in the policies
 and systems formulated by the state.  They practice fraud and violate
 public interests for their own private gain.   In view of this, we must
 persist in educating people in the integration of the interests of the
 state, the collective and the individual.   Thus, we can ensure that the
 responsibility system involving the integration of responsibility, power
 and interests develops healthily along a socialist orientation.

 by the cadres and masses emerged in the early 1950's.   The upsurge in
 theoretical study at that time was an inevitable product of the development
 of the revolutionary situation; it was an important ideological preparation
 for the cadres and masses in fulfilling the revolutionary and construction
 tasks in the new period.
 The Chinese revolution was won under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-
 Mao Zedong Thought.  Therefore, the people naturally had an urgent desire
 to study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought when they hailed the victory
 of the revolution.  Although many comrades who had worked in the liberated
 areas had valuable experience in the revolutionary struggle, they were
 unable to carry out systematic theoretical study under the conditions of
 hard struggle.   So they felt the need to study again when confronted with
 the new situation and tasks which were unfamiliar to them.   In the light
 of specific conditions, our party did a great deal of ideological and
 organizational work concerning theoretical study, so that the study campaign
 at that time could develop healthily throughout the country and achieve
 remarkable results.
 The theoretical study in the early 1950's began with the study of the history
 of the development of society--the study of historical materialism, and it
 lasted for several years.   In the study, by closely referring to the develop-
 ment of the situation, they carried out the principle of combining theory
 with practice; energetically mastered some basic viewpoints of historical
 materialism such as the attitude to labor, the attitude to the masses, the
 class viewpoint and the Marxist theory of state; and conscientiously remolded
 their ideology.  They initially or further understood some basic principles
 of Marxism.  All this laid a good foundation for a profound theoretical study.
 On the above basis, the study of Marxist political economics was launched
 in various places throughout the country, and in respect of socioeconomic
 relations,  the cadres and masses further understood the law governing social

 development, especially the inevitability of socialism replacing capitalism.
 This had great significance for understanding the character of Chinese
 society, solving the problems that emerged in the construction of the new
 democratic economy, conscientiously implementing various economic policies
 of the party and forming a revolutionary outlook on life.  The study of
 political economics-was a step forward in the theoretical requirement's'
 of the cadres and masses, as well as the need to solve our practical'
 problems.  Therefore, it further stimulated the people's initiative to
 study.   During the study of the above-mentioned subject, everyone, in
 accordance with their own theoretical level and by means of various organiza-
 tional forms, studied Lenin's "On Imperialism," Stalin's "Problems of the
 Socialist Economy in the Soviet Union" and "Textbook of Political Economics"
 and some important documents concerning economic problems issued by the
 party Central Committee.   In the study and discussions, they energetically
 combined theory with practice and achieved good results.
 In 1952, the party Central Committee put forward the general line for the
 transitional period.   In 1953, China began its first 5-year plan and entered
 the period of large-scale economic construction.  What was the transitional
 period?  How should we carry out industrialization and the socialist trans-
 formation of the ownership of the means of production?  How should we unfold
 our large-scale economic construction in a planned way?  The people were
 eager to have a correct theoretical explanation of these questions so they
 could suit their own work to the requirements of the new situation.  There-
 fore, our party timely organized the study of the 9th to 12th chapters of
 "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik)" and
 Lenin's and Stalin's works concerning socialist economic construction, while
 extensively organizing the study of the general line for the transitional
 period.  Many people who had such an experience still remember how large
 numbers of people energetically took part in the study.
 The above-mentioned theoretical study was carried out in combination with
 the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works.  After the victory of the revolu-
 tion, hundreds of millions of people, with energetic propagation by the
 party, studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works with great eagerness.  Before
 the publication of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," people in various
 places mainly studied such basic works of Comrade Mao Zedong's as "On
 Practice," "On Contradictions" and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship."
 From 1951 to 1953, volumes 1, 2 and 3 of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"
 were published successively, and a systematic study of each volume was
 energetically organized.   In this way Mao Zedong Thought was popularized
 on an unprecedented scale.
 As far as organizational and leadership work was concerned, the theoretical
 study at that time was noted for its regularity.   In the early period of the
 founding of the People's Republic of China, study committees and study groups
 (generally divided into two grades) were set up in various institutions and
 organizational bodies.   Sufficient time was devoted to theoretical study

 because the cadres earnestly wanted to master basic theoretical knowledge.
 After 1951, the theoretical study of employed cadres began to gradually
 embark on the road of regularization.  Part-time political schools were set
 up one after another in various places throughout the country; centralized
 unified study plans were carried out; and the regular system of roll call,
 asking for leave, making up missed lessons, examinations, and rewards and
 punishment was implemented.  A strict method of grouping more employed
 cadres into classes was beginning to be implemented according to their
 educational levels and basic theoretical knowledge, instead of according to
 their rank or position.  The cadres who took part in the study were divided
 into Group A, Group B and Group C (which were changed to advanced group,
 intermediate group and elementary group after the latter half of 1952).  They
 had different contents and requirements for their study and implemented a
 system of giving regular tests and examinations and of making promotions.
 Various institutions, organizational bodies and units at the battalion level
 and above in the army were gradually provided with theoretical instructors,
 theoretical teachers and study advisers.  Lecture groups were also formed
 in some regions.  After the party Central Committee's instructions concerning
 the cadres' theoretical education from 1953 to 1954 were transmitted
 throughout the country, attention was further focused on the training, pro-
 vision and grouping of theoretical teachers.  Large numbers of Marxist-
 Leninist evening schools and training courses were set up to train theoretical
 teachers.  A network of theoretical study by employed cadres was formed in
 some regions.   In addition, high-ranking cadres in many regions who were
 comparatively highly self-cultivated in theory were required to independently
 study in a systematic way the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and
 Comrade Mao Zedong, especially works that were closely related to the work
 in their own departments.  They were to write study theses and reports,
 regularly help common cadres with their study and explain to them the questions
 they might come across during their study.  Because the study system was
 regularized, the cadres' theoretical study was further carried out under
 unified leadership, in a planned way and with checkups.  This was an important
 reason why the study campaign at that time could last so long and achieve such
 good results.
 Another characteristic was that party organizations at all levels paid exten-
 sive attention to giving guidance with specific aims.   Party organizations
 at all levels placed the cadres' theoretical education in an important
 position in the party's work.  The Propaganda Department of the party Central
 Committee, the branch bureaus of the party Central Committee and party
 committees in various places often made a study of the situation of theoreti-
 cal study, worked out study plans and issued, with specific aims, instruc-
 tions for intensifying and improving the cadres' study.  They also compiled
 teaching materials in a timely manner.  The outline for the study and
 propaganda of the party's general line in the transitional period compiled
 by the Propaganda Department of the party Central Committee played an
 important role in pushing forward the political theory study at that time.
 Study rooms, research rooms and special institutions in charge of employed
 cadres' theoretical education were formed in many provinces.

 Here I would like to mention the guidance work of the magazine XUEXI [STUDY]
 in the study campaign at that time.  As a periodical which gave instruc-
 tions concerning cadres' theoretical study and which was under the direct
 leadership of the Propaganda Department of the party Central Committee, this
 magazine was extensively welcomed by the cadres and masses for its guidance
 on specific aims.  Its main role was as follows:
 1.   In the light of the study content and the people's actual ideological
 condition, it repeatedly explained the necessity for all cadres tp?study
 Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought while familiarizing themselves with
 their own professional work.   It used various forms (such as commentaries
 and study comments) to energetically propagate various important instructions
 issued by the party with regard to theoretical study and to guide the
 localities in implementing the instructions.   It actively propagated the
 important significance of various study contents.   It particularly emphasized
 that the study had to focus on the actual problems of the revolution and
 construction in China, and took Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as
 the guiding principle.   It issued large numbers of articles with regard to
 the major problems in various courses and with regard to the theoretical
 problems the cadres were concerned about in order to make it convenient
 for everyone to study, refer to and discuss them.
 2.   It provided teaching and reference materials.  For instance, for the'
 study of the history of social development, the magazine XUEXI gave wide
 coverage to the "forum on the basic knowledge of social sciences."  For the
 study of chapters 9 through 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union (Bolshevik)," it not only provided the study reference outline
 for the intermediate group, but also provided systematic reference materials
 for reading.  In order to help the elementary group, staff and workers,
 and young students to study basic knowledge concerning social sciences and
 economic construction, the magazine publishing house, from 1951 onward,
 edited and published the elementary edition of XUEXI, the "Book of Political
 Knowledge" and "Book of Knowledge for Economic Construction."  It also
 provided the study outline, answers to questions, explanations of terms
 and phrases and the relevant materials for each chapter in each book.
 3.   It energetically did a good job in answering questions.  XUEXI attached
 great importance to this work.   The magazine regarded this not only as its
 basic responsibility for helping the cadres with their theoretical study,
 but also as an important method for understanding the situation and improving
 its editorial work.  Letters kept coming in from readers expressing their
 questions answered.  This fully reflected their study and the need for study.
 XUEXI had a group specially responsible for answering the readers' questions
 sent to the magazine.   It seriously handled all questions put forward by the
 readers and answered them after careful consideration.   Some answers were
 given individually, some were carried in the "Questions and Answers".column
 of the magazine.  This was well received by the readers.

 There were various shortcomings in the cadres' theoretical study at that
 time, but on the whole the success was remarkable.  The theoretical study
 enabled the cadres and masses to receive a profound education on Marxism-
 Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and trained a group of cadres who had a firm
 theoretical basis, who had formed a proletarian world outlook and who had
 lofty ideals.  It promoted the realization of the unprecedented change
 China was experiencing at that time.
 The study campaign showed that great changes are the best ways to make people
 learn new things and study new problems.   So long as we are good at arousing
 and promoting the consciousness of the people in their theoretical study
 by educating them to have lofty ideals and realistic aims, we can stimulate
 the people's enthusiasm for theoretical study and create an atmosphere in
 which the people study hard for the revolution and construction.
 The study campaign showed that the study of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong
 Thought, organized according to the development of the situation and the
 cadres' different conditions, is well received and can achieve the best
 results, and therefore it is most vigorous.   In addition, giving guidance
 with specific aims in study is an important link in doing a good job,in
 study.
 The study campaign showed that it is of extreme importance to have the
 attention and firm leadership of party organizations at all levels.  Without
 strong ideological and organizational leadership, it is not conceivable
 that thousands of people could take part in the study campaign profoundly,
 persistently and effectively.

 RELY ON THE COLLECTIVE ECONOMY TO BUILD MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL CIVILIZATION
 IN THE RURAL AREAS--THE SUPERIORITY OF THE SOCIALIST SYSTEM SEEN FROM THE
 VAST CHANGES IN NANHAI COUNTY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 38-41
 [Investigative report by Lin Hong [2651 3163], Zhou Jingying [0719 4842 5391],

 the Propaganda Department of the Guangdong Provincial CCP Committee]
 [Text]  Nanhai County is located in the northern part of the Zhujiang delta,
 near Guangzhou municipality.   It has a population of 800,000 people.  A land
 of fish and rice, it has 800,000 mu of farmland, including mulberry tree
 plantations and fish ponds.   Since liberation and particularly since
 cooperativization, people in Nanhai County have successfully built a material
 and spiritual civilization by means of the strength of their collective
 economy.  Vast changes have taken place in industrial and agricultural pro-
 duction, in the people's standard of living, and in their spiritual appearance
 and social habits.
 The vast changes in Nanhai County are, above all, manifested in the rapid
 development of industrial and agricultural production.   In 1980, the gross
 value of the county's industrial output amounted to over 473 million yuan,
 an increase of 11 times over that of 1949; the gross value of its agricul-
 tural output amounted to over 415 million yuan, an increase of 36 times over
 that of 1949; grain production increased from 250 million jin in 1949 to
 780 million jin and the per mu yield increased from 492 jin to 1,500 jin,
 an increase of over 25 times; and production of peanuts, sugarcane, silk-
 worms, pigs and pond fish increased respectively by 8 times, 5.9 times,
 13.6 times and 3.9 times.  On average,  the per capita industrial and agri-
 cultural output value was 1,105 yuan (not including the household sideline
 income of the commune members), or $624.
 What is the principal reason for the rapid increase in the industrial and
 agricultural production of Nanhai County?

 First, the county has relied on collective strength to continuously change
 production conditions, to develop large-scale capital construction in farm-
 land water conservancy, to build up large tractors of high-yield farmland
 which is resistant to drought and waterlogging, and to carry out basic
 farm mechanization to ensure a continuous high and stable yield in agricul-
 tural production.
 Before liberation, water conservancy conditions in this region were in a very
 bad shape.  Whenever a flood occurred, the river embankments would collapse
 and large tracts of good farmland would be inundated.   In the two relatively
 large floods in 1947 and 1949, river embankments collapsed in a score of
 places and in these years respectively, 250,000 mu and 60,000 mu of ricefields
 were inundated.  The disaster-stricken peasants had nothing to eat but chaff
 and wild herbs.   Some of them had to leave the county to escape the famine
 while countless numbers died of hunger.
 After liberation,  the party led the peasants to take the road of cooperativiza-
 tion and to carry out, in a planned manner and step by step, water conservancy
 construction work in the farmland.   First, beginning in the 1950's, a large
 number of river embankments were built.   In all, 35 river embankments with
 a total length of over 400 kms were completed.  This protected the largest
 part of the farmland from flood.  In 1968, the biggest flood in history
 occurred in the region, but not a single river embankment collapsed.  After
 the 1960's, an electically powered irrigation system covering the entire
 county was gradually completed.  Nowadays, rains as heavy as 200 mm in a
 single day can be drained off within 3 days.   In the 1970's, work was mainly
 concentrated on levelling land so that garden-style cultivation of the great
 proportion of land in the whole county could be achieved.  At the same time,
 much progress has been made in farm mechanization.  At present, the county
 owns nearly 4,000 tractors of various kinds and over 1,000 electric motors,
 in addition to a large assortment of processing machines for agricultural
 products and mechanical conveyances for water and land transport;  75 percent
 of the farmland has now been put under mechanized farming. Mechanization of
 the processing of farm products and of farm transport has basically been
 realized, as has the electrification of irrigation.   The level of scientific
 farming has also been noticeably improved and, as a result, the labor pro-
 ductivity rate in agriculture has been greatly enhanced.
 Obviously, if they did not rely on the powerful strength of the collective
 economy but relied solely on the small economy of the individual farm house-
 holds, it would have been impossible within a short period of time to complete
 such a huge scheme of farmland water conservancy and the initial stage of
 agricultural mechanization.
 Second, the county has brought into full play the superiority of the systems
 of unified management and rational division of labor under the collective
 economy,  "firmly grasping the main structure (grain) and developing the two
 wings (industrial sideline occupations and the planting of rearing trades),"
 and continuously developing the scope and depth of production.

 Nanhai County has a plentiful supply of labor power.   Because of its
 proximity to large cities and towns, it possesses advantageous conditions
 for the development of industrial sideline production and the commodity
 economy.  But it was only after the populace had been organized that this
 superiority was brought into full play.   Following the cooperativization
 of agriculture, and particularly since the 3d Plenary Session of the-,llth
 CCP Central Committee, people in the county have emancipated their minds,
 rationally readjusted the structure of their agricultural economy, and
 gradually implemented the guideline of "grasping the main structure,
 developing the two wings, and bringing into play the combined operations
 of agriculture, industry and commerce."  That is to say, under the logical
 premise of ensuring a gradual increase in grain production, freely develop-
 ing industrial sideline production and multiple operation forms.  In
 addition to the large-scale production of agricultural sideline products,
 industries such as those producing chemical fertilizer, hardware, electronics
 articles, household electrical machines, textiles, garments, plastics,
 printed matter, leather goods, metallic products, machines and construction
 materials all started from scratch and were swiftly developed. Some of these
 industrial products have been marketed in other parts of the country and
 abroad.  As a result, the whole rural economy has steadily been enlivened.
 The income of the communes and production brigades from the collective economy
 has swiftly increased while their income from industrial sideline occupations
 and from the planting and rearing trades, and the proportion these occupy
 in the collective economy gross income, have also greatly increased.   In
 the year before last, the composition of the collective income of the county
 as a whole was as follows:   grain, 27.9 percent; industrial sideline occupa-
 tions, 39.1 percent; and the planting and rearing trades, 33 percent.
 As a result of specialization and division of labor in industries run by the
 communes and production brigades and the growth of cultural and educational
 enterprises in the rural areas, a large number of peasants have become
 workers or personnel with specialized training.  At the same time, the small
 cities and towns where the people's communes are located have become the
 political, economic and cultural centers of the rural areas.   The disparity
 between worker and peasant and between city and countryside has gradually
 shrunk.   Thus, the development of such social maladies as overpopulation,
 unemployment and a high crime rate caused by the influx of a large number
 of poor or bankrupt peasants into the large cities and towns, frequently
 seen in capitalist countries in the course of their industrialization, has
 been avoided.   This is of deep and penetrating significance.
 Following the rapid growth of the collective economy,  the peasants have quickly
 become affluent.   In 1980, the average per capita income of the rural commune
 members in Nanhai County was 341 yuan, the highest in Guangdong Province and
 equivalent to 4 times the national average.  At present, in the countryside
 of Nanhai County there are three signs of plenty:   plenty of savings deposits,
 plenty of new houses, and plenty of purchases of high-grade commodities.
 In the year before last, the gross amount of bank deposits of commune members
 73

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 in the whole county was 83.3 million yuan, averaging 128 yuan per peasant.
 The majority of new houses built in the countryside of Nanhai County consists
 of two-storied brick and tiled buildings with attached veranda.  Many families
 of commune members have electric fans, radios, dining sets and sofas.  Some
 have television sets, radio-recorders, steel and wooden furniture, and
 electric rice cookers.  When talking about their present living standard,
 the affluent peasants are all smiles.  They say that if the present policies
 of the party are continued for another 3 to 5 years, their standard df living
 will be even better.
 These facts are incredible unless they are seen or heard personally.  Before
 liberation, because of the heavy taxation levied by the reactionary govern-
 ment and the many natural disasters, the broad masses of peasants in Nanhai
 County lived under the tragic circumstances of not having enough to eat
 and hardly any clothing to wear.  For example, what is now the Nansha
 production brigade of Xiaodong people's commune was so poverty-stricken
 that there was a common saying that "no girls want to marry into a Nansha
 family."  But now, Nansha is greatly changed in appearance.   In the year
 before last, the gross rice output of the whole brigade amounted to
 2.25 million jin, averaging over 1 ton of grain per mu.  Collective income
 amounted to over 5 million yuan, averaging 996 yuan per commune member.
 Twenty households had an income of over 10,000 yuan each.  The collective-.
 accumulated funds of the brigade amounted to over 3.7 million yuan.  Over
 recent years, this production brigade, which has some 500 households and a
 population of over 2,100, has built 535 new residences and bought over
 1,000 wristwatches, 482 bicycles, 375 electric fans and over 70 television
 sets.  Its members have deposits of 1.42 million yuan in the savings society.
 The former tragic era of "not marrying a daughter into a Nansha family" has
 gone and will never return.
 Under the spiritual guidance of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP
 Central Committee, the Nanhai County party committee and the Nanhai County
 people's government, on the one hand, actively encouraged communes and brigades
 favored with better conditions to become affluent first, and, on the other
 hand, vigorously supported communes, brigades and teams in difficulties to
 quickly extricate themselves from their impoverished condition and proceed
 toward affluence.  Over each of the last few years, the county has granted
 loans to impoverished teams or made investments amounting to 6 to 7 million
 yuan.  The relevant departments accorded to these teams "seven priorities."
 These relate to:   the supply of the means of production; arrangements for
 bank loans; providing facilities for mechanized farming; repairs of damaged
 farm machines; purchase of agricultural sideline products; absorption or
 employment of personnel in industrial sideline occupations; and supply of
 transport facilities.  These measures were of immense help to the impoverished
 units.  As of the end of the year before last,  in the whole county there
 remained only four production brigades which had average per capita incomes
 of less than 150 yuan.  These constituted only 1.6 percent of the total
 number of production brigades in the county.

 Concurrently with the swift growth of the socialist collective economy and
 the noticeable improvement in the standard of living of the people, the
 spiritual state of the populace has also changed considerably.  Proceeding
 arm in arm on the road to affluence, the people have gradually evolved
 common ideals and new moral concepts.  A new type of relationship between
 human beings has taken shape.  Following the call by the party Central
 Committee to help the peasants become rich as soon as possible, cadres at
 various levels shared the same thoughts and the same feelings of urgency
 as the peasants.  They devised various ways and means to help the produc-
 tion teams enhance production.  For this they were greatly welcomed by the
 commune members.  As a result, the relations between the cadres and the
 masses became increasingly friendly.  Between the commune members them-
 selves, the spirit of unity, comradeship and mutual help was also greatly
 enhanced.  Based on the continuous development of the collective economy,
 collective welfare work progressed steadily.  Cooperative medical care
 was introduced into all communes and production brigades in the county.
 Many of the comparatively affluent communes and production brigades
 instituted a retirement scheme for aged commune members.  Under the system,
 the pensions of retired members are equivalent to 50 to 70 percent of
 their average work points over the 3 years immediately prior to retirement.
 In the year before last, 83 retired members of the Nansha production brigade
 received, on average, a pension of 504 yuan per person.  The maximum amount
 received was 859 yuan.   In addition, there are no charged for infants attend-
 ing nurseries, for children going to school (up to senior middle school)
 or for commune members seeking medical care.  At the same time, firewood,
 tap water and movie shows are provided free of charge.   Funerals for deceased
 commune members are subsidized.  All these things caan be summarized as
 follows:  nurseries for the infants, schools for the young, medical care
 for the sick, provision for the aged, and funeral services for the dead.
 The socialist economy has brought enormous material benefits to the peasants
 of Nanhai County.   In turn, the peasants have closely tied their destiny to
 the socialist enterprises and to collective production.  They have only one
 objective, namely, how to make the collective economy grow and prosper so
 that all can become affluent in the shortest time possible.  When the
 collective meets with difficulties, everybody will try by all ways and means
 to resolve the difficulties.  For example, when a commune or production
 brigade plans to start industrial sideline production but is short of funds,
 the commune members enthusiastically raise the necessary funds.   Some offer
 money from their own reserves that were put aside for marriage or house
 building, while others loan their surplus grain to the production team at
 a discount.   The richer they become, the more concerned they are with the
 state and the greater are their contributions to the state.   In 1980, the
 county supplied over 378 million jin of grain to the state.   Of this amount,
 some 100 million jin was surplus grain which the peasants voluntarily sold
 to the state.  An increasing amount of other agricultural sideline products
 has also been sold to the state.

 The development of material culture has changed certain old habits in the
 countryside. The commune members have begun to care about hygiene, to have
 a liking for science, and to be concerned with domestic as well as foreign
 affairs.  Many peasant families currently subscribe to one or two news-
 papers, while the communes, one after another, are setting up cultural
 centers.  Various kinds ofsparetime technical schools have sprung up like
 bamboo shoots after a spring rain.  This is a new picture of the Nanhai
 countryside not seen over the last several thousands of years.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, Nanhai County
 has thoroughly implemented the guidelines and policies of the party Central
 Committee.   In particular, it has grasped the following:
 First, it has respected the decision-making or autonomous power of the produc-
 tion teams and has brought into play, and relied on, the commune members'
 spirit of being masters of their own future.
 In the past, anything concerning the fields of production teams, such as
 what crops to plant, what crops not to plant, when to plant, and when to
 harvest, was determined from above and the decision was a vertical one.
 In this way, to be realistic and practical was well-nigh impossible and
 the masses were unable to display their spirit of being masters.  After
 the third plenary session, the Nanhai County party committee, following the
 principle of being practical and realistic, improved their methods of leader-
 ship, respected the autonomous power of the production teams and allowed
 the peasants the power to determine their own production affairs.  First,
 in regard to politics, they respected the wishes of the commune members,
 and instituted a democratic system of electing the various levels of leader-
 ship.  Moreover,  they made a bold decision--that of allowing the masses to
 choose "leaders" from among the county's organs at various levels.   The
 masses were at liberty to recommend, from among the county's organs at
 various levels and from other units, capable persons suitable for.leader-
 ship.work on the production front and the county committee would then make
 the necessary follow-up arrangements.  Acting on the recommendations of the
 masses, over the past 2 years, the county party committee has transferred
 14 cadres from the various sections and bureaus of the county administra-
 tion to fill gaps in leadership work at the basic level.   In this way, a
 close relationship with the commune masses has been engendered,  the cadres
 and masses are of one heart and purpose, and good results have been achieved
 in various kinds of production work.
 Second, on the production front, all commune members gained decision-making
 power on matters ranging from simple production arrangements to scientific
 farming.   In this, the Julong production team of Pingzhou people's commune
 offers an especially good example.  This team is located near Guangzhou and
 used to be well-known for flower planting and the raising of ornamental fish.
 However, in the past, the hands of its members were firmly tied by "leftist"

 restrictions.  They were not allowed to plant flowers or to raise fish.   Each
 member was allowed, on average, a plot of land only 0.8 mu in size to grow
 grain. However, after the third plenary session, they were allowed to make
 the necessary production arrangements according to their own actual condi-
 tions, such as planting flowers, raising fish, producing bricks and tiles,
 or making rattanware.  Thus, by opening wide the production avenues and
 engaging in multiple forms of operations, they became affluent in only 2 years.
 What has drawn public commendation is that their flower nursery, which
 occupies only 3 mu of land, was converted from a tract of wasteland into a
 "treasure bowl" in less than 2 years.  It earns an income as high as
 60,000 yuan a year.  This shows us that only by earnestly respecting the
 autonomous rights of the production team can the wisdom and creativeness
 of the commune members be brought into full play.   In regard to such.problems
 as how to make good use of a piece of land, say, only one-tenth of a mu in
 size, or how to make good use of a pond, or how to bring into full play the
 various superior conditions or the special talents of an individual, they
 are perfectly capable of giving the matter careful thought and making the
 necessary and satisfactory arrangements.   In this way production will
 certainly succeed.
 Second, the county has adopted the production responsibility system in its
 various forms and has fully carried out the principle of distribution accord-
 ing to work.
 In the past, under the influence of "leftist" thought, this socialist basic
 principle of distribution according to work was unreasonably criticized as
 being capitalist.  For years, the practice of making only a rough calculation
 of work points and "eat-ing out of one big pot" had seriously dampened
 the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.   Since the third
 plenary session, comrades in Nanhai County have overcome egalitarianism and
 carried out the principle of distribution according to-work, grasping these
 steps as pivotal points in emancipating and developing the productive forces.
 Based on the actual condition of the solid strength of the collective economy
 in this county, the rapid growth rate in production and the high level of
 distribution as well as the wishes of the broad masses of commune members,
 these comrades have comprehensively implemented the system of assigning
 responsibility to specialists and linking remuneration to output for produc-
 tion personnel.   They have also implemented the system of assigning
 responsibility for task completion in financial affairs to financial and
 accounting personnel and the responsibility system of cadres and administra-
 tive personnel taking personal responsibility for tasks.   Since these various
 forms of the responsibility system are directly linked to the material
 interests of the individual, they have outstandingly activated the production
 enthusiasm of the cadres and the masses.  The Xincun East brigade of Pingzhou
 people's commune had long been known for its poor performance in production.
 In the year before last, it adopted the system of assigning responsibility
 for production and linking remuneration to output and forthwith its appearance
 was changed.   Its average grain yield per mu rose from 1,240 jin in 1979
 to 1,670 jin, and the average per capita income of its members increased from
 144 yuan to 310 yuan, an increase of more than 100 percent.

 Third,. the county has promoted industrial sideline production among its
 communes and brigades and brought into full play its own superior condi-
 tions in this respect.  Nanhai County borders Guangzhou and Foshan.  It
 is an extremely advantageous position to develop the commodity economy.
 Unfortunately, in the past, under the influence of "leftist" thought, its
 superiority in this regard was labelled as a "breeding soil for capitalism"
 and it was subjected to various criticisms and slanderous slogans such as
 the criticism of the so-called "three heavy's and three light's," and to
 calls urging that the "tail of private ownership" be cut off, that the
 "underground factories" be uprooted, that the "upstarts" be struggled
 against, and so on.  During the 10 years of domestic turmoil, it actually
 happened that in a locality. such as Nanhai, which is gifted with good
 natural conditions, some production teams could earn only several fen a
 day.  This is hardly imaginable.  It made people ask in disgust:   "Could
 this be socialism?"
 Fortunately,  the mist of dismay in the people's hearts was wiped away by
 the third plenary session of the party.   Since then, the people have begun
 to realize that the universal poverty was not caused by real socialism
 but rather by the fake socialism of the "gang of four."  In order to quickly
 enrich the peasants, the county party committee advocated the slogan "three-
 horse carts can pull a load faster than two-horse carts."  It rectified
 the former rule permitting only the commune and the production brigade,
 but not the production team,  to engage in industrial production.   It en-
 couraged production teams to go all out in industrial sideline production.
 Thus, they were able to realize the concept of "making the best and fullest
 use of the advantageous conditions of a locality, the value of materials
 and the talents of the individual."  In 1980, the gross income derived
 from industrial sideline occupations by production teams in the whole county
 amounted to nearly 100 million yuan, an increase of two times over that of
 the preceding year.   This alone increased the average income per person
 by 120 yuan.   Concurrently with extensively taking industrial sideline
 production, the teams, acting in the Chinese proverbial manner of the
 "eight immortals crossing the sea, each one showing his special prowess,"
 developed various pursuits such as planting fruit trees, melons, vegetables
 and flowers; lumbering; raising birds, insects, fish and so on--all of which
 have become broad avenues for the advance to wealth and success.
 Never before have the people of Nanhai been so full of confidence in socialism
 as they are today.  They are determined, under the party's leadership, to
 .struggle for the realization of the target set by the Nanhai County party
 congress, of building a "socialist new Nanhai which is industrialized,
 abounds with gardens and forests, is economically and collectively developed,
 and which has a beautiful environment and people enjoying a rich and
 prosperous life."

 CARRY FORWARD THE SPIRIT OF REVOLUTIONARY HEROISM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 42-44
 [Article in "Learning From the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team" column by
 Liu Junqi [0491 0193 2978]]
 [Text]   The championship won by the Chinese women's volleyball team in
 the third world volleyball cup finals has inspired the revolutionary
 enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people.  We must learn from
 the revolutionary heroism of the members of the Chinese women's volley-
 ball team, which is characterized by-hard training, heroic stubbornness,
 hard struggle and daring to win victory.
 In order to learn from the spirit of the team and carry forward revolutionary
 heroism,  it is imperative for us to follow the example of the team in cherish-
 ing great ideals and aspirations.  Great achievement stems from great ideals.
 We will be able to maintain our steadfastness, to have a definite orienta-
 tion, to arouse our spirit, to be stubborn and to persist in our fight only
 when we have a firm proletarian world outlook.  In their revolutionary
 struggles, the proletariat has always combined work with great ideals and
 carried out all work vigorously.   Such is the attitude of the women's
 volleyball team.  The players of the team have always put the interests of
 the party and the people before everything else.  They play volleyball for
 the revolution, and they have combined their revolutionary faith with their
 actions and spared no efforts to play every match well.   They say:   "The
 1 billion people are concerned about us, and the prestige of the motherland
 comes above all other considerations."  Their goal is to "wave the flag,
 receive medals and win championships."  They never think of personal gain
 or loss.  They are determined to change the backward situation in the three
 types of ball sports in our country and "view each match as a step toward
 remedying this situation."  With this goal in mind, they have experienced
 countless difficulties, played a match even when they were sick, and put
 off love and marriage.  They take as their motto the words spoken by the
 country's veteran sportsman Jong Guotuan:   "We have a limited chance to fight
 in our life."  With this motto, they trained stubbornly and eagerly to
 improve their individual skills and their team coordination.  Owing to their
 efforts, they won the world championship and defeated many strong rivals
 because of their unique style and skills.   The ideal for which they had been

 fighting was realized.   Such a spirit of great ideals and aspirations and hard
 work is valuable, and we need it in carrying out revolution and the construc-
 tion and modernization program.  This spirit is an indispensable and great
 motive force for social progress, development of the state and the boosting
 of the morale of the nation.  The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the
 History of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC," pointed out:   "In the
 new historical period, all members of the party and the people of various
 nationalities across the country must continue to maintain lofty revolutionary
 ideals and revolutionary vigor and carry out the great socialist revolution
 and socialist construction to the end."  The socialist modernization program
 now being carried out in our country is on a grand scale and is a hard task.
 It can in no way be carried out smoothly; on the contrary, our road of
 progress will no doubt be full of contradictions, difficulties and setbacks.
 Consequently, it is imperative for us, under the party's leadership, to
 cherish great ideals and aspirations, display our initiative in directing
 history, solve contradictions, overcome difficulties, and do a good job in
 building material and spiritual civilization.   The comrades of the women's
 volleyball team have set a brilliant example for us, and we must learn to
 emulate them in our actions.  The cause of our country will be very hopeful
 if we all act like the members of the women's volleyball team.
 In learning from the spirit of the women's volleyball team and in carrying
 forward revolutionary heroism, we must follow the attitude of the players,
 which is characterized by hard work, dauntlessness, and stubbornness in
 overcoming difficulties and in winning victory.  The attitude to be taken
 by revolutionaries toward difficulties and obstacles on the road of advance
 is an important question.  According to the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong,
 we must despite difficulties strategically and pay attention to them tacti-
 cally, and surmount difficulties with doggedness.   This is what the comrades
 on the team have done.   In the past China was quite backward in three types
 of ball sports and it required strenuous effort to reach world standards.
 Displaying the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither "hardship nor death,"
 the members of the women's volleyball team decided to catch up, whatever
 the cost, and for this purpose they were ready to sacrifice everything to
 obtain their goal.  Over the past few years, they have proceeded from
 actual matches and carried out strenuous and scientific training charac-
 terized by difficult maneuvers and strict requirements.  They would not
 take their meals or rest until they completed their training.  Ignoring
 fatigue, they would not leave the battlefield even when they were injured.
 They played each game with the spirit of "winning the game at the cost of
 their lives."  They understood that in order to reach the world standard
 they had to train hard, that when hardship ends joy will come and that the
 "blossoms of victory would burst forth in the form of sweat."  With a
 stubborn will and determination, they have surmounted various difficulties
 and obstacles, climbed tortuous paths, and advanced with every gust of wind
 and with every wave.   It would have been impossible for them to have
 defeated so many strong rivals and win the great victory in the world
 volleyball arena without carrying out regular and hard training and mastering
 the necessary skills.   This fact proves that as long as we are able to pay

 attention to difficulties and spare no efforts to overcome them, we will
 be able to create miracles.  In fact, the history of the Chinese revolution
 is one of strenuous struggle by the Chinese people.  Recalling the past, we
 still remember that the old China was characterized by a backward economy,
 backward culture and.backward physical culture, and China was ridiculed
 as the "sickman of east Asia."  Under the leadership of the party and
 through protracted revolutionary struggles, the Chinese people ultimately
 overthrew. the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism and bureau-
 cratic capitalism and established the People's Republic of China.  Following
 the tremendous victories in socialist revolution and construction, our
 various causes, including physical culture, have made great progress.  The
 Chinese people quickly removed the label of the "sickman of east Asia" and
 stood anew among the nations in the world.   It can be said that backwardness
 in itself is not dreadful, but what is dreadful is the spirit of accomplish-
 ing nothing and of being content with backward situations.   Lu Xun said:
 "When I am watching sports I often think that the winners are respectable;
 the runners who lag behind and persist in running to the finish line and
 those who watch them with respect and without laughing are the pillars of
 China's future."  The women of the team and the hundreds of thousands of
 people who are working hard on various fronts are the ones praised by Lu Xun
 as having the spirit of being confident in the face of backwardness, undaunted
 in the face of difficulties, able to constantly find strength within them-
 selves and to work with perseverance.  These people are the real pillars for
 building the morale of the Chinese people and the motherland.
 In learning from the spirit of the team and carrying forward revolutionary
 heroism, it is imperative to follow the examples of the team's members in
 combining the lofty aspiration to climb to the top with the spirit of being
 down-to-darth, and hard working so as to become actual doers and promoters.
 The proletariat and the working people are direct producers and creators
 of the goods and wealth in the world; they are modest doers.  They understand
 that in revolutionary struggles and daily life they have to personally take
 part in practice so as to attain their anticipated goals.  The team has
 also set an example in this aspect.  The members of the team considered
 neither fame nor gain and dedicated their lives to physical culture with a
 strong sense of responsibility for their work.  The team has charged from
 being weak to being strong, from being backward to being advanced and from
 being unknown to being famous at home and abroad, and this was made possible
 through hard training and work on the part of the players.  There have been
 changes in the team's membership since it was formed, but all along it has
 carried out hard training with strict demands and worked painstakingly.
 Therefore, the team members are the actual doers that merit respect.   They
 considered it meaningful that they are able to have exciting lives during
 their youth.  They say:   "When we all become old and recall our life today,
 we will certainly feel proud.  This is because our lives have been meaningful
 and our youth had been dedicated to the motherland."  What vivid and moving
 words!   These words fully reflect the beautiful souls and deeds of the
 players.  Those who speak empty words and are reluctant to do their work
 in a down-to-earth way should be enlightened upon heaving these words.   It

 will not do to simply lie, brag or speak empty words.  We can only do. our
 work in a down-to-earth way.  Lenin said:  "Talk less beautiful words and
 do more daily ordinary work."  Comrade Zhou Enlai said in his poem "Part
 and Never To Meet Again":   "When we sit and talk, how can we stand and
 walk?"  All these are useful sayings.   Great ideals can be realized only
 through actual deeds, and difficulties and obstacles can be resolved only
 through actual deeds, and the edifice of socialism can also be completed
 only through actual deeds.  We must follow the example of the comrades of
 the women's volleyball team, do our work strenuously and promote the
 development of our cause.
 There are no difficulties in the world we cannot overcome as long as we
 dare to climb.  Our country is now experiencing a new historical period;
 therefore, it is imperative for us, under the leadership of the party and
 led by hundreds of thousands of heroes, to form a vigorous revolutionary
 army to overcome various difficulties and obstacles on our road to advance
 and to realize the great goal of the modernization program.  The victory
 won by the team has inspired the Chinese people and strengthened their
 national confidence.  What the team could do, all other trades can also do.
 The whole of China can be changed from being backward to being advanced
 and can become one of the world's strong countries.   Since the players
 were able to fully display their skills in international competition and
 win merit for the motherland, likewise, millions of Chinese people who also
 cherish ideals can also achieve great changes for the country.  We must
 inspire revolutionary spirit, display revolutionary vigor, lose no time to.
 catch up, march forward courageously, and make contributions to realizing
 the modernization program and to building our country into a powerful
 socialist country with a high level of democracy and civilization so as to
 live up to the expectations of our forefathers and the succeeding generations.

 LEARN FROM THE COLLECTIVE SPIRIT OF THE WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 pp 44-45
 [Article in the "Learning From the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team" column
 by Sun Shijie [1327 1102 2638]]
 [Text] The history of the struggle of the Chinese women's volleyball team,
 characterized by hard training and close cooperation, is a song of collec-
 tive spirit.
 It has been a long dream of all members of the team to win the world
 championship and win merit for their socialist motherland.   To realize such
 a goal naturally required each member of the team to have high skills, but
 what is more important is that the team had to be turned into a strong
 collective with close coordination and unity in their fight.  The comrades
 of the team deeply realized through practice that volleyball is a sports
 event characterized by collectivity and that individual skills can be im-
 proved only through the collective, and they can display their roles only
 through collective efforts in matches.  They also realized that if they lack
 the collective spirit and discipline related to such a spirit, they would
 not be able to defeat so many strong rivals in sharp competition even if
 they had mastered the skills.  Consequently, in their "march toward the
 world" they had the national condition at heart, put the interest of the
 collective in first place, and closely united and supported each other for
 the common goal and eventually formed a very good interrelationship.   Such
 a collecgive spirit has become the standard for their life and morale and
 the source of their wisdom, and strength. In particular, when they are in
 very adverse conditions, they will be able to draw on incomparable courage
 and confidence from their collective spirit and to fight dauntlessly for
 the victory of the collective cause.
 Of course, it is not easy to handle well the relationship between individuals
 and the collective and to nurture a highly collective spirit.   It requires
 a protracted and stubborn education and tempering.
 The members of the team are ordinary people in their life; they have no
 so-called inborn miraculous power.  They have sweated and shed tears during
 unprecedentedly hard and strenuous training, and they often experienced

 temporary misunderstandings among themselves because of the mistakes made
 during competition..  All this required a process of correctly handling the
 contradictions between the individual and the collective.  When a member
 of the team, Chen Zhaodi, fell on the floor and could hardly move during
 hard training, she quietly scolded instructor Yuan as "cold-blooded," and
 Sun Jinfang made a face during a fierce match because another player,
 Lang Ping, did not take her hint.  All this serves as a vivid example of
 the contradictions.   Such contradictions are real and convincing, but
 they are not in the interests of cooperation during a match.  Thus, as
 contradictions constantly cropped up and were constantly resolved, the
 misunderstandings among the players vanished and they became more and
 more amicable both in their thinking and feelings, and eventually they
 cherished the collective spirit profoundly.  Within the ranks of members
 of the team, the coaches are closely united and cooperate with the players,
 and this is also the situation with regard to players on the field and
 reserve players and with regard to second passers and main attackers.
 The reason for this situation is that they.are all linked by collective
 thinking.  If we broaden the field of our vision and think of the nameless
 heroes who are responsible for accompanying them during training and doing
 logistics work, of the veteran players who have been tirelessly working for
 the "emancipation of big balls," and of the concern and encouragement of
 the hundreds of millions of Chinese people, compatriots in Hong Kong and
 Macao, overseas Chinese and international friends, we will further under-
 stand that "the championship that we have been struggling for has at last
 been won by the players" and consequently we can see the brilliance of
 the proletarian collective spirit.
 A number of bourgeois scholars have put forward the view that "proletarian
 collectivism means the elimination of personality." Is this true?  The
 practice of the women's volleyball team has powerfully refuted this view.
 The team's coach, Comrade Yuan Weimin, said:   "The 12 members of the team
 will be able to play with flying colors only when they have their own
 personalities.  If their personalities are at ground-level, the team will
 be hopeless."  What a good expression!  We can say that Yuan Weimin is not
 only a volleyball coach with specialized skills, but also an ideological
 worker who understands Marxist dialectics.  Thus, under his guidance and
 that of deputy coach Deng Ruozeng, each member of the team has her own
 skills and character.   For example, Sun Jinfang is agile, Lang Ping is
 straightforward, Zhang Rongfang is calm, Chen Zhaodi is pungent, Cao Huiying
 is quiet, Chen Yajing is stubborn, Zhang Jieyun is ingenious, Zhou Xiaolan
 is decisive, Liang Yan is shy, Zhu Ling is lively, Zhou Luming is clever, and
 Yang Xi is natural and unrestrained.  In short, each has her own character.
 They are not made out of one mold.  Therefore, we can clearly see that,
 instead of eliminating personality, the collective provides full conditions
 for developing personality.  Marx and Engels said:   "It is only in the
 collective that individuals will be able to acquire the means for making
 al all-round development;  that is to say, they will have individual freedom
 only in the collective." ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," vol 1, p 82).

 Stalin once compared the-Marxist view on the correct relationship between
 the individual and the collective with the anarchic view, and he made a
 comprehensive theoretical generalization when he said: "Anarchism, which
 is based on individuals, holds liberating individuals as an important
 condition for liberating the masses and the collective.  Accordirig, to the
 anarchic viewpoint, there will be no mass liberation until individuals
 are liberated and consequently its slogan is 'all for the individual.'
 On the other hand, Marxism is based on the masses and it holds that mass
 liberation is the main condition for the liberation of individuals.  That
 is to say, according to the Marxist viewpoint, there will be no individual
 liberation until the masses are liberated.  Therefore, the Marxist slogan
 is 'all for the masses'."  ("Collected Works of Stalin," vol 1, p 273).
 The collective cause that is characterized by joint 'struggle improves and
 develops individual talent, while a full display of individual talent
 guarantees the victory of the collective cause.   Such is the correct rela-
 tionship between the individual and the collective, which has been vividly
 reflected by the women's volleyball team.  It is becamse the team realized
 the dialectical unity between general character and individual character
 that it has become a harmonious, lively, strong team And has come first
 in the international volleyball arena.  And when the members of the team
 mounted the rostrum as world champions amid a solemn atmosphere and when
 the five-starred Red Flag was being hoisted, they did not rejoice with the
 mean and selfish joy of individualism but with the feelings of collective
 proudness for the great motherland and the whole nation.  In such an exciting
 atmosphere, the heroines. of the team profoundly felt that they "were the
 happiest people in the world" and such feelings represent the most ardent
 praise for proletarian collectivism.
 The proletarian collective spirit shows the nature of communist morality,
 and it is the core of socialist spiritual civilization.  To correctly combine
 the interests of the collective, the state and the individual should be
 the socialist economic principle and the principle for socialist morality.
 To see things from such a high point, we can understand that the lofty
 collective spirit displayed by the women's volleyball team, just like its
 patriotism and revolutionary heroism, constitutes a spiritual wealth which
 is highly significant for the cadres and the masses on various fronts and
 a vivid manifestation of the spirit of the socialist era.  Our work will
 be done better and better and our country will become strong as long as
 we are able to conscientiously learn from and display such a spirit and
 use it in the practice of the socialist modernization program.

 THE IMPACT OF THE ENERGY QUESTION ON THE ECONOMIES OF THE DEVELOPED CAPITALIST
 COUNTRIES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16.Jan 82 pp 46-48
 [Article in "Forum on Economic Problems of Imperialism" column by
 Qian Jinxi [6929 0093 2497]]
 [Text]   Crude oil is a type of energy which has good flammable qualities
 and a high calorific value, and can be stored and transported readily.
 It occupies a proportion of 56 percent of the world's structure of primary
 sources of consumable energy.  Together with natural gap, its natural
 partner and close associate in both storage and collection, the combined
 proportion is over 70 percent.  Hence, the current talk about the energy
 problem of the world economy is essentially talk about crude oil.
 Since crude oil is an indispensable source of energy for the nations of
 the world, particularly for the developed capitalist countries, it occupies
 an important position in world trade.  At present, trade in crude oil
 accounts for 22 percent of the gross volume of world trade.  It makes up
 51 percent of the gross tonnage of the world's export commodities, and
 the oil tanker fleet accounts for 44 percent of the gross world tonnage of
 oceangoing vessels.  Hence, whenever internationally there is a crisis in
 crude oil supply or a sudden rise in the price of oil, the economies of
 the developed capitalist countries are tremendously affected.
 The world's concern with the crude oil problem began in the 1970's.  Prior
 to that time, although the oil-producing countries in Asia, Africa and
 Latin America had already started a series of struggles for the protection
 of their own oil interests and had at various times achieved successes in
 such matters as the crude oil tax rate, marked prices, share participation
 rights, nationalization, and so on, yet for a time the power of fixing
 oil prices remained in the hands of the world's transnational oil corpora-
 tions.  All the Western countries did their best to keep the oil price low
 so that they could reap exhorbitant profits.   In the 1950's and 1960's,
 the economy of the imperialist world rose rapidly.  One of the basic
 reasons for this success was the plunder from the developing countries of
 large quantities of crude oil, a cheap and good-quality source of energy.

 As a result of this plunder from abroad, the capitalist countries found
 themselves becoming increasingly dependent on imported oil.  After the
 Middle East hostilities in October 1973, the Arab oil-producing countries
 enforced an embargo on oil exports to the United States, West Europe and
 Japan.  This caused a serious oil crisis in these countries.  The conse-
 quences were that many plants had to shut down, transport capacity iJ.as
 drastically curbed, goods piled up in wharves and storage areas, and
 there were long lines in gasoline filling stations.  The oil embargo
 was subsequently lifted, but the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
 Countries [OPEC] soon announced their decision to take back the power of
 fixing oil prices.  Beginning from 1 January 1974, the basic oil price
 was raised from $3.011 to $10.651 per barrel.  At the same time, the
 petroleum monopoly corporations of the West took the opportunity to raise
 the spot price of oil on the market in order to reap exhorbitant profits
 for themselves.   This was the first steep rise in oil prices after the
 war.  Naturally, it was a serious blow to Western countries, which heavily
 depended on crude oil for domestic consumption and had to depend heavily on
 imported oil. Without doubt, it played an important role in causing and
 aggravating the serious 1974-1975 postwar economic crisis in the Western
 world.
 Since 1979,  the crude oil market in the West has been full of vacillations
 and changes.  Oil supply on the market was tight at times, but it eased
 slightly at other times.   For example, in the early autumn of 1980, the
 stockpile of crude oil in the West had reached a saturation point and on
 the international market there had been a surplus of crude oil averaging
 2.5 million barrels a day.  Soon afterward, in September, hostilities
 erupted between Iran and Iraq.   Badly battered by the war, both nations
 suspended their oil exports,and on the international market oil supply was
 reduced by about 3.5 million barrels a day.  Meanwhile, the price of oil
 was rising steeply.  By 1 January 1981, OPEC announced that Saudi Arabia's
 basic oil price would be $32 per barrel while the highest oil price from
 other sources ranged from $36 to $41 per barrel.   This represented an
 increase of.3 to 3.5 times compared with the oil price in 1978.  Beginning
 from the first quarter of 1981, owing to the steady decline in the
 Western economy and the enforcement of various oil economy measures, oil
 consumption declined.   On the world oil market, there was a surplus of an
 average of 2 million barrels a day.  The price of oil stabilized and actually
 dropped slightly.   In October 1981, OPEC agreed on a new unified oil price:
 the standard oil price was fixed at $34 per barrel.  At present, in the
 capitalist world the supply and demand of energy is generally in a balanced
 state.   The oil price can be expected to remain stable for a period of time.
 In this way, the second steep rise in oil price, which had lasted for 2 years,
 came toa close.
 Nevertheless, factors can still be found working for another steep rise in
 the oil price.  They are:   1)  In accordance with the law of the cyclical
 movement of the capitalist energy economy, a stability in oil price can very
 well promote an economic recovery, which in turn will result in a rise in
 oil consumption and in another shortage in oil supply.   2) More recently,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 in an effort to curtail the purchase of oil at a high price, the capitalist
 countries have dipped heavily into their oil reserves and as a consequence
 their oil stockpile has been gradually diminishing.  When replenishment
 is due in the future, the market will be affected.  3) The war between
 Iran and Iraq is still continuing.  Even when the war ends it will still
 not be easy for these countries to quickly restore their full oil produc-
 tion and export capacity.  4) The geographical distribution of oil deposits
 and production in the world is still very unbalanced.   Contradictions
 between the petroleum-exporting countries and the major petroleum-consuming
 countries might yet be intensified.  Thus, another steep rise in the oil
 price can hardly be avoided.
 The large-scale rise in the price of crude oil in 1973 was a serious blow
 to the economies of the Western countries, which were then in a state of
 "stagflation."  Its impact was rather broad.  The outstanding features were
 as follows:  '                  '
 1.   It reduced the speed of the growth of the economies of the Western
 countries.   A lack of energy supply frequently impeded the development of
 the national economy.  It was estimated that the impact of every 10 percent
 rise in the oil price caused a drop of 0.35 percent in the value of the
 gross national product of the Western countries.
 2.   It increased the international payments deficits of the Western countries
 and reversed, in part, the direction of their capital exportation.  In 1978,
 before the second upheaval in the oil price, the developed capitalist
 countries had a surplus of $31 billion in their ordinary revenues and
 expenditures.   In the course of the price rise,.the surplus became a deficit.
 In 1979, the deficit was $35 billion and in 1980 it increased to $73 billion.
 From 1974 to 1978, as a result of the price rise, OPEC obtained a large amount
 of petrodollars, amounting to $660 billion in all.   Of this, 75 percent was
 subsequently spend on importing commodities and labor services from.the
 Western countries and on purchases of real estate there, or were deposited
 in Western banks or invested in Western enterprises.   In 1979 and 1980, OPEC
 reaped a surplus of $184 billion from their ordinary revenues and expendi-
 tures.  Of this surplus, a sizable amount flowed back to the Western
 countries.   In this way, on the international capital market, aside from
 the developed capitalist countries exporting capital to the developing
 countries, a new feature developed, namely, the developing countries also
 transferred their capital funds to the developed countries.
 3.   It aggravated the currency inflation in the Western countries.   During
 the period of the large-scale rise in the oil price, a high tide of currency
 inflation occurred in the Western countries.   In the nine-nation West
 European community, the rate of currency inflation was 6.8 percent in 1979.
 It went up to 8.9 percent in 1979 and climbed to over 12 percent in 1980.
 In 1980, the growth rate of currency supply in the United States surpassed
 the original target of 6.5 percent and went up to over 8 percent.

 In short, the steep rise in oil price aggravated the "stagflation" of the
 Western economies and weakened the economic potential of the Western
 countries.
 The tremendous impact of the rise in oil price on the Western economies
 forced the various Western countries to adopt countermeasures to lessen
 the effect on their economies as well as to find a way out.  The measures
 taken can be summarized as follows:
 1.   Formulation of a detailed energy policy and mapping out a general outline
 for energy supply; and establishment of an energy planning center which
 devotes its efforts to raising the effective utilization rate of energy and
 at the same time lowering the growth rate of energy consumption.  For
 example, the policy outlines of countries like the United States, Japan,
 West Germany, France and Canada all had as their starting point an economic
 evaluation of the supply sources of the multiple forms of energy or of an
 individual source of energy, and proceeded with a comprehensive survey of
 the various phases relating to energy such as prospecting, developing,
 geographical distribution, price structure, allocation, comprehensive
 utilization, and the import and export trade.  They served as the basis for
 the subsequent formulation of detailed guidelines, laws and regulations.
 2.  Development of multiple forms of energy and changing the energy consump-
 tion composition, such as raising the proportions of coal, nuclear energy,
 and hydroelectricity in the energy consumption makeup, and at the same
 time lowering the relevant proportions of crude oil and natural gas in
 the makeup and paying great attention to the utilization of energy that can
 be regenerated or reclaimed.   In particular, the work on conversion of coal
 into a liquid or gaseous state has been given much attention by the various
 countries.   In June 1980, the American Government snactioned an appropriation
 of $25 billion for the establishment of a special organ to study and promote
 synthetic fuels.  Likewise, commencing in 1979, the Japanese Government
 strengthened research on the development of substitute forms of energy,
 particularly nuclear power generation.   It is estimated that by the year 2000,
 in the primary energy consumption makeup of the Western countries, the
 proportions of crude oil and natural gas will decline respectively to
 37 percent and 16 percent, whereas the proportions of coal, nuclear energy,
 hydroelectricity and solar energy, and synthetic fuels will possibly rise
 respectively to 24 percent, 10 percent, 9 percent and 4 percent.
 3.   Stepping up the prospecting and development of new oil areas.   In the
 past, certain large oil areas in the Western countries such as those in the
 North Sea, Alaska and the sea areas of the United States adjacent to the
 Gulf of Mexico had seldom been developed owing to various deterrent factors
 such as poor natural conditions, or the complex nature of the oil deposits,
 or the extraction cost being much higher than the selling price.  However,
 since the rise in oil prices, the production cost has become lower than the
 89

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 selling price and, as a result, in the 1970's, commercial production was
 resumed in these areas one after another.  Of them, the oil fields in the
 North Sea and Alaska have become the largest areas in West  Europe and
 North America respectively.  But the confirmed oil deposits of the North
 Sea oilfield are 3.2 billion tons and the output is about 100 million tons
 (1 year) while the confirmed deposits in the Alaska oilfield are 1.2 billion
 tons and the annual output is 70 million tons.  Neither of them can offset
 the enormous deficit between oil production and. consumption where they are
 located, namely, about 600 million tons in West Europe and about 400 million
 tons in the United States.  Thus far they have been able only to resolve
 the problem of energy shortage in individual countries like England and
 Norway.   For this reason, recently the United States has begun the
 exploration and development of the.."(Nanpo) [0589 0980] oilfield" on the
 northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico and the adjacent exploratory fields
 outside the gulf.  Likewise, Britain has proceeded with prospecting in the
 Irish Sea and the English Channel.
 4.   Improving the oil extraction or procurement rate.   The extraction or
 procurement of crude oil is divided into three stages.    At present, it is
 confined mainly to the primary and secondary stages.  Western countries
 are now turning their attention to studying the methodology for the third
 stage. It is estimated that if this stage can be extensively developed,
 the equivalent of an increase of 20 to 30 percent in the volume of crude
 oil deposits will be effected.
 5.   Taking the road of "pluralization" in crude oil trade.   For Western
 countries which are short of oil, ensuring the source of supply is highly
 important.  These countries are deeply aware of the uncertainty of the
 political conditions in the petroleum-exporting countries and the wide
 divergence in their economic policies.  Hence, the overcentralization
 in any one locality in the geographical distribution of foreign trade
 in crude oil is highly disadvantageous.  Therefore, they strive for
 "pluralization" of the petroleum trade.  Take the United States for
 example:   following the large-scale rise in oil price for the second time,
 it has increased its oil imports from Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Mexico,
 Indonesia, Britain and Norway.   Formerly, Japan derived 90 percent of
 its oil imports from the Middle East.  Now, its imports from the Middle
 East have dropped to 78 percent and imports from Southeast Asia have
 increased to 15 percent.   In addition, plans are being made to expand its
 imports from China, Mexico, the Soviet Union and Africa.  Western Europe
 has also increased its oil imports from Africa, the Soviet Union and
 Central and South America.   In particular, since the sharp decline in oil
 exports from Iran and Iraq, the Soviet Union has become West Europe's
 second largest supplier of crude oil next to Saudi Arabia.
 6.   Establishment of energy-saving organs and strengthening of energy-saving
 work.  For example, in 1974 France established an energy-saving bureau and
 in 1976 a transdepartmental energy-saving commission.  Many other Western
 countries have set up similar organs.  All the countries have adopted
 guidelines encouraging and promoting energy-saving measures and conversely
 imposing sanctions on wasteful practices in energy consumption.  On the side

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100220001-3
 of encouragement, special privileges are given to industrial enterprises
 in the form of providing them with funds and equipment for the installation
 and use of energy-saving facilities or granting them loans at low interest
 rates for the installation of energy-saving facilities.  To encourage
 residences and households to save energy, heat-insulating materials are
 supplied to them and solar collectors are installed.   Economic sanctions
 are imposed on enterprises and individuals that violate energy-saving
 regulations.  A surplus tax is levied on enterprises whose products are
 found to have exceeded the prescribed standard for energy consumption.
 Take, for example, fuel consumption of motor vehicles:  the American
 government originally stipulated that 1975 ex-factory motor vehicles must
 attain the target'of 18 miles per gallon of gasoline.  In 1980, the target
 was raised to 20 miles per gallon, and it is planned that by 1985 the target
 will again be raised, to 27.5 miles per gallon.  In order to attain this
 objective, the motor vehicle manufacturing industry is currently engaged in
 renovation work starting with the car engine and embracing the car body and
 tires.
 Developed capitalist countries have adopted various measures and policies
 aimed at energy development and savings.  They have devoted large amounts
 of capital and labor power to the energy departments within their countries.
 They have transferred to the developing countries those production depart-
 ments which habitually consume large quantities of energy.   In short,
 they have resorted to various ways and means to cut down their energy
 consumption and thereby reduce their overdependence on foreign countries.
 Needless to say,:these policies and measures have had a considerable impact
 on the world's distribution of productive forces and on the economic
 structure and economic development of the developed capitalist countries.
 However, within a fairly lengthy period, it will still be impossible to
 basically change the production and consumption structure of energy in the
 world or to change the state in which the developed capitalist countries
 depend on the developing countries for oil or to replace all at once crude
 oil with a new kind of energy that will take over the top-ranking energy
 position.  Hence, the economy of the capitalist countries will continue to
 be harassed by the energy question.

 HOW DID LIU SHAOQI COMMENT ON 'THE INSIDE STORY OF THE QING COURT'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 2, 16 Jan 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Wu Zhitang [0702 2535 2768]]
 [Text]  How did Comrade Liu Shaoqi comment on the film "The Inside Story
 of the Qing Court" when it was screened shortly after the founding of the
 People's Republic?  Did he really praise it as a "patriotic" work?  This
 has been a question of public concern for over a decade.
 The origin of the question has to be traced back to the spring of 1967.
 On 1 April that year, Qi Benyu trotted out an article entitled "Patriotism
 or National Betrayal?--Commenting on the Reactionary Film 'The Inside
 Stofy of the Qing Court."'  In this article, he obstinately asserted that
 Comrade Liu Shaoqi once lauded "The Inside Story of the Qing Court" as
 a "patriotic" film.  Seizing on this, he went on to sling mud at
 Comrade Liu Shaoqi, saying that Liu had all along practiced "national
 betrayal" and was "the top party person in power taking the capitalist road."
 He was not going to be content with anything less than Liu Shaoqi's destruc-
 tion.  The real facts of history show that all these allegations were
 charges fabricated by Lin Biao, Jiang Qing and Qi Benyu for the purpose of
 framing Comrade Liu Shaoqi.
 In fact, shortly after the screening of the film "The Inside Story of the
 Qing Court," Comrade Liu Shaoqi, just like Comrade Mao Zedong, held a critical
 opinion of the film's ideological trend and deemed that it preached reformism.
 This was clearly reflected in Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech at a study forum
 organized by the CPPCC National Committee for Democratic Personages.
 Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech that day focused on the study of Marxism-Leninism
 and the question of the interrelationship between reforming the objective
 world and reforming the subjective world.  Discussing the film "The Inside
 Story of the Qing Court" in connection with the widespread movements carried
 out at that time commencing with the movements for land reform, to resist the
 United States and aid Korea and to suppress the counterrevolutionaries, he
 criticized this film and said it was not worth any positive appraisal because
 it preached reformism.  He said:   "The Inside Story of the Qing Court"
 preaches reformism.   It gives people the impression that had Guang Xu been
 able to do this or that, we could have lived without the revolution, without

 Dr Sun Yat-sen and even without what we are pursuing now.  Comrade Liu Shaoqi
 also pointed out:  Reformism has been tried out, but it did not work.  There
 is no compromise on the question of class struggle.  In a given historical
 .period in the development of a society, it is necessary to overthrow the
 reactionary class in the interest of the overwhelming majority of the
 people.  Today, if you wholeheartedly support land reform instead of opposing
 it, you stand for truth and progress.  The same applies to the building of
 socialism in the future.   It is evident that in these remarks, Comrade
 Liu Shaoqi was criticizing the ideological trend of the film "The Inside
 Story of the Qing Court" as reformist.  He had no intention whatsoever of
 lauding it as patriotic.
 It was precisely for this reason that when Qi Benyu's defamatory article was
 trotted out, Comrade Liu Shaoqi was able to justifiably knock the bottom out
 of. this violent attack which stood truth on its head and confused enemy
 with friend and say:   "There are many lies in this article.  When did I say
 that this film (referring to "The Inside Story of the Qing Court") was
 patriotic?  When did I talk about becoming a "Red comprador'?  These claims
 do not tally with facts and are false charges."  These few forceful words have
 hit the nail on the head and laid bare the whole essence of the question.
 Lies written in ink cannot change the iron-clas facts of history.  As the
 "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding
 of  the PRC" pointed out:   "Irrefutable facts have proved that labeling
 Comrade Liu Shaoqi a "renegade, hidden traitor and scab' was nothing but a
 frameup by Lin Biao, Jiang Qing and their followers."  Irrefutable facts
 have also repudiated all the slander and libel of Comrade Liu Shaoqi by
 Lin Biao, Jiang Qing and their followers in connection with the film "The
 Inside Story of the Qing Court."
