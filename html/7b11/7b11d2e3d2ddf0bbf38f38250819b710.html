 Prime Minister Bakhtiar is deeply concerned by the
 prospect that Ayatollah Khomeini may return to Iran once
 the Shah leaves.   Khomeini,  meanwhile,  is increasing the
 pressure on the regime by trying to undermine the loyalty
 and morale of the military--apparently with some success.
 Bakhtiar is especially concerned that K omeini s return
 could split the military between senior officers and
 elite units loyal to the Shah on the one hand and the
 more religiously oriented lower ranks on the other     25X1
 thereby precipitating civil war.
 Bakhtiar says he probably would "resign immediately"
 if Khomeini returns.   While some of his comments were
 doubtless intended for effect,  the Prime minister and
 other key government officials are clearly disturbed by
 the prospect of Khomeini's arrival in Iran.   These offi-
 cials recognize that any move against Khomeini risks
 provoking massive unrest.   Hardline military officers,
 however, might well demand that Bakhtiar arrest Khomeini.
 25X1
 Some kind of negotiated settlement between Khomeini
 and the military is essential if widespread violence is
 to be averted in the days ahead.   There is no guarantee,
 however,  that either side has the wisdom to make the
 necessary compromises.   This week will likely conclude
 with major demonstrations Friday and Saturday to mark
 the traditional 40th day after Ashura--the holiest day
 in Shia Islam--an occasion when the ability of the Ira-
 nians to resolve their crisis will be tested severely.

 Khomeini already is attempting to win over the rank
 and file in the military.   He appealed yesterday to hi25X1
 followers to treat soldiers with "brotherly kindness"
 and to avoid unnecessary provocations.   The incidents of
 fraternization between demonstrators and soldiers appear
 so far to be isolated, but they are symbolic
 in the military toward a decline in morale.

 NATO:    Reactions to Guadeloupe
 25X1
 25X1
 Secretary General Luns was appreciative of Ambassa-
 dor Bennett's briefing on the summit but termed it "pre-
 liminary" and made it clear that the Council hoped to be
 provided more details.   Several unidentified Permanent
 Representatives approached Ambassador Bennett to second
 Luns' comments.                                         25X1
 So far, the Italians have been the most vocal cri-
 tics of the summit.   Italian President Pertini,                                        for exam-
 ple, told Ambassador Gardner last week that the favorable
 Italian view of the US would be seriously eroded were a
 Guadeloupe "directorate" to be institutionalized.
 25X1
 While most of the smaller NATO members would agree
 that the US, UK, West Germany,  and France have the right
 to meet privately among themselves,  they want to be kept
 fully informed about discussions that might affect their
 security.   If the smaller NATO members perceive that an
 institutionalized, two-tier system is developing within
 the Alliance, cooperation on a host of issues could be-
 come more difficult.

 SOUTH KOREA - JAPAN:   Concern About Relations
 Officials in South Korea are reportedly apprehen-
 sive that the normalization of relations between Japan
 and China has begun to undercut the priority Tokyo at-
 taches to its ties with Seoul.   The South Koreans are
 always concerned about shifts in relationships among
 their larger neighbors,  and this concern has been inten-
 sified by uncertainty about the foreign poZicy   oats
 of the new government in Japan.                            25X1
 South Korean anxieties have focused on Japanese
 Foreign Minister Sonoda's recent remarks noting Tokyo's
 continued interest in seeking government-to-government
 contacts with North Korea.   Sonoda's remarks have led
 some officials in Seoul to believe that Tokyo has begun
 25X1
 with improving Sino-Japanese relations.
 Prime Minister Ohira has long supported a Japanese
 policy favoring close relations with South Korea, and he
 is unlikely to sponsor initiatives that would undercut
 Seoul's security or diplomatic equities.   Even so, Ohira
 is less closely associated with the pro - South _Korean 25X1
 than was former Prime Minister Fukuda.
 Some South Korean officials are said to be consider-
 ing more activist measures--such as highlighting their
 displeasure over Japan's burgeoning trade surplus with
 South Korea--as responses to real or perceived shifts
 in Japanese policy toward the peninsula.   At this junc-
 ture, however, the South Koreans seem more likely to
 concentrate on broadening their contacts with the Ohira
 government.

 More violence has erupted in Spain's troubled Basque
 region the past few days amid signs of renewed vigilante
 activity by extreme rightists.   The military is unlikely
 to become directly involved,  however,  unless terrorists
 follow up on threats to assassinate additional senior
 army officers.                                                     25X1
 The Basque terrorist organization, ETA,  is likely
 to retaliate quickly and harshly for the near-fatal at-
 tack on one of its leaders in southern France on Satur-
 day.                                 Two far-right groups in Spain have claimed respon-
 sibility for the shooting; members of the paramilitary
 Civil Guard, however, are widely believed to form the
 core of such rightist groups, and the ETA will probably
 seek revenge by killing prominent police officials.
 Last month, another ETA leader was killed by a     25X1
 bomb in southern France.   The attacks on the two ETA
 leaders seem likely to signal a resurgence of far-right
 terrorist groups in the Basque region.                    25X1
 ETA could also retaliate by pursuing its avowed
 intention of killing senior military officers.   The
 Spanish military is already incensed by the assassina-
 tions earlier this month of two army officers, which
 resulted in public protests by the military.   Further
 attacks on army officers could unleash emotional forces
 difficult to control.
 25X1
 Key military commanders still appear committed to
 staying within the bounds of the constitution, and they
 do not relish the prospect of becoming directly involved
 in the Basque situation through the imposition of mar-
 tial law.   At the very least, however, they would be
 likely to exert intense pressure on the government to
 crack down hard on the Basques by using the extraordi-
 nary police powers granted last year.

 According to a Kuwaiti Government announcement,
 Yugoslav President Tito will visit Kuwait from  3  to  6
 February.    The Kuwaiti press  is  speculating that Tito
 may go on to Iraq and Syria in an effort to narrow those
 two countries' differences with Egyptian President Sadat
 over the Camp David accords.   Tito may speak favorably
 about the accords in private but is unlikely to press
 leaders in Baghdad and Damascus to drop their opposition
 to an Egyptian-Israeli treaty.                              25X1
 Tito continues to oppose Israel's stand on most of
 the unresolved issues, but distrusts Sadat's go-it-alone
 strategy.   He does, nevertheless, place a high priority
 on re-creating an aura of unity among Arab members of
 the nonaligned movement.   Yugoslavia is also interested
 in maintaining improved relations with the US, and this
 probably accounts for its uncharacteristically construc-
 tive approach in not condemning the Camp David agreement.
 25X1
 The 86-year-old Tito has not traveled abroad since
 his trip to Washington and London last March; his doctors
 probably are unhappy about his present travel plans.   F

 LEBANON:   More Army Teams to South
 Defense Minister Khoury yesterday told Ambassador
 Dean that he and the commander of UN peacekeeping forces
 had decided to send an additional 16 Lebanese Army person-
 nel to south Lebanon on Wednesday to join UN battalions
 as liaison representatives.   Eight were sent to the UN
 units last week in the first stage of a plan to establish
 a Lebanese Government presence in the south before 19
 January, when the UN forces' mandate comes up for re-
 newal.   Khoury's decision to send more teams this week
 probably will anger the Israelis and their Christian
 militia allies, who are suspicious of government in-
 tentions in the south.   The Israelis had been informed
 of the Lebanese plans, but they had requested further
 consultations before the teams were deployed.

 IRAQ-SYRIA:   Reopening of Pipeline
 The Iraqi Petroleum Corporation pipeline, which runs
 from Iraq through Syria to the Mediterranean, is scheduled
 to begin operating by the end of January.   The opening
 of the pipeline--which has been closed for nearly three
 years because of strained political relations as well
 as disagreement over the price of the oil and transit
 fees--is symbolic of growing rapprochement between Iraq
 and Syria.   The US defense attache in Damascus believes
 that the pipeline is now ready to use after recent re-
 pairs.   No prices or fees have been announced;  in the
 last full year of operation, Syria realized around $130
 million in transit fees.

 ANGOLA:   Airfield Capture
 Angolan Government and Cuban forces have captured
 M'Pupa airfield, where foreign-provided military equip-
 ment and supplies destined for Jonas Savimbi's National
 Union for the Total Independence of Angola have arrived
 during the past year.   The airfield, a longtime govern-
 ment objective,                                apparently was taken during an offensive
 last month
 The loss of M'Pupa will disrupt UNITA's
 ogi.s lc network, but it will not seriously impede UNITA's
 effective guerrilla campaign.. The insurgents are now
 looking for alternative airstrips;  they may have diffi-
 culty,, however,  finding one secure from government at-
 tack.

 China's post-Mao  leadership has  launched an ambi-
 tious program to acquire Western machinery and technology
 to help modernize the country's backward industrial base.
 The effort,  covering the entire industrial spectrum,
 potentially could cost more than $40 billion in foreign
 exchange by 1985.   The leadership is only beginning to
 recognize the difficulties that will eventually force
 China to slow the pace of the program and probably ex-
 tend the 1985 goals into the 1990s.                        25X1
 Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping  (Teng Hsiao-ping)  has been
 the driving force behind the program to bring the economy
 up to "front-line status" by the end of the century.
 Since October 1976, China has contracted for whole plants
 and technology valued well in excess of $7 billion, more
 than twice the value of all such contracts signed be-
 tween 1972 and 1975.   China is considering contracts for
 at least $33 billion more in plants and technology.   Em-
 phasis is on petrochemicals and synthetic fibers, metals,
 fuels, transportation,  and communications.
 The first stage of modernization is scheduled to  25X1
 entail the completion by 1985 of 120 major projects,  in-
 cluding a variety of basic industrial complexes and trans-
 portation facilities.                                      Many,  if not all, of these proj-
 ects will require massive infusions of Western technol-
 ogy.
 Bold Policy Shifts
 China has eased a number of restrictive policies
 in its efforts to spur acquisition of technology and to
 create an environment encouraging the absorption of new
 techniques into industry.   Perhaps the foremost policy

 turnaround is the new willingness to send thousands of
 students to the West to study.   In addition, more than
 2,000 Chinese technicians and specialists have visited
 Western factories over the last two years,  shopping for
 the latest in industrial technologies.   China has also
 encouraged visits by Western businessmen who are flock-
 ing in to promote their products and services.
 China also has moved to reconcile its internal  25X1
 policies with international business and financial
 practices.   In a major concession to Western business-
 men concerned about patent infringements,  China is lay-
 ing the groundwork to recognize the International
 Patent Protection Agreement.   The Chinese have also
 been compelled by the massive foreign exchange require-
 ments of their program to consider a variety of schemes
 they would not permit before,  including joint ventures,
 barter and product payback deals,  long-term credits, and
 even government-to-government loans.                     25X1
 Western money markets are well disposed to extend
 the $15 to $20 billion in credits that China would re-
 quire over the next several years to finance a $40-
 billion capital import program.   China has already ob-
 tained commitments for nearly half that amount.
 Potential Problems
 A combination of technical, political,  and finan-
 cial constraints will preclude full attainment of the
 modernization goals on schedule.   The sheer size and
 speed of the effort is the primary constraint.   China
 does not have the skilled manpower or management resources
 to coordinate the purchase,  construction,  and operation
 of the large number of projects it plans to complete
 by 1985.                                                   25X1
 The standdown of higher education in China between
 1966 and 1976 left a 10-year gap in the supply of en-
 gineers and scientists.   Past import programs often met

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/23: CIA-RDP81T00368R000100010024-1
 with technological,  supply, transportation, personnel,
 or other problems that limited the impact of imported
 plants and equipment.   Similar problems will hamper this
 much more ambitious program.                              25X1
 The reluctance of many cadres and workers fully to
 embrace the leadership's program could become a criti-
 cal constraint.   Past policy shifts--in particular the
 Great Leap Forward  (1958-60)  and the Cultural Revolu-
 tion                                 (1966-69)--had drastic economic and political re-
 percussions; many middle-level industrial officials
 and Communist Party members,   fearing another dramatic
 shift in priorities,  are wary of taking initiatives that
 may backfire in a few years.   Further,  as foreign-trained
 technicians and students enter the work force, their dif-
 ferences in outlook from less-educated workers and cadres
 who gained their positions during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion could spark disruptive clashes.                      25X1
 As problems multiply, China's leaders will reduce
 the speed and the scope of the program, resulting in a
 stretch-out of 1985 targets into the 1990s.   Even so,
 the achievement of even a fraction of the goals would
 add significantly to China's drive to become a major
 industrial power.

 OVERNIGHT REPORTS

 They are prepared overnight by the Office of Current
 Operations with analyst comment where possible from
 the production offices of NFAC.)
 Press reports from Tehran indicate that the Shah
 left Iran today without holding the expected press con-
 ference.   Just before his departure,  the Majlis,  Iran's
 lower house of parliament, gave Prime Minister Bakhtiar's
 government a vote of confidence by a surprisingly wide
 margin--149 to 43 with 13 abstentions.   The Iranian
 Senate had given its approval to the Bakhtiar government
 The Israelis apparently retaliated late last night
 for the Palestinian terrorist attack on Maalot on Satur-
 day.                                                     Israeli  25X1
 patrol boats and artillery shelled a large Palestinian
 refugee camp south of Tyre, Lebanon.   The various Pal-
 estinian factions in southern Lebanon were expecting an
 Israeli action                             This is the second
 Israeli reprisal attack in the past four weeks. Last
 month Israeli aircraft bombed Palestinian targets in
 southern Lebanon in response to terrorist incidents.

 The US Embassy in London concludes that the
 Callaghan government is not likely to fall today follow-
 ing the debate on economic policy in the House of Com-
 mons.   It is not certain whether the opposition Con-
 servative leadership will push for a vote of confidence;
 according to one late press report,  they have decided
 not to do so.   In a vote of confidence, according to the
 Embassy,  the Tories might have support from the Liberals,
 but members of Parliament representing Northern Ireland
 and the Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties would be
 likely to side with the government.   The Embassy be-
 lieves the Tories may decide to allow the government
 more time to try to resolve the issues posed by strikers
 in the hope that it will embarrass itself in the process.
 Meanwhile,  today's one-day national rail strike--threat-
 ened to be resumed on Thursday--will further disrupt
 long-distance freight transport already seriously ham-
 pered by the truck drivers'  strike.
 Thailand-Kampuchea
 In an assessment of the current situation, the US
 Embassy in Bangkok reported yesterday that the Thai are
 drifting into acceptance, albeit reluctant, of Vietnam-
 ese forces on their border. The prospect of direct Thai
 military action in Kampuchea, never very high, is reced-
 ing daily.   The Embassy believes there are numerous pos-
 sibilities for miscalculation as Vietnamese forces pursue
 remnants of the Pol Pot regime.   The Thai do not appear
 eager to consider cooperating with the Chinese in encour-
 aging guerrilla warfare in Kampuchea.

 Bolivia
 According to press reports,  a spokesman for the
 Padilla government last night announced the resignations
 of 15 of the 18 ministers in the nearly all-military
 cabinet.   The ministers allegedly resigned to give Presi-
 dent Padilla a free hand in choosing his team for guid-
 ing Bolivia toward a return to democracy.   The spokesman
 said the new cabinet would be named today.   Elections
 are scheduled for .1 July,  and reforms to make them more
 democratic were announced last Thursday.   Padilla ousted
 the more authoritarian Juan Pereda in a bloodless coup
 two months ago.
 Angola-Cuba
 Defense Minister Carreira on Thursday said that   resi-
 dent Neto is planning to fly to Cuba on 23 January for a
 four- or five-day visit.   Carreira indicated that Neto
 would attempt to disentangle Luanda from an agreement
 signed by former Deputy Premier Rocha in December pro-
 viding for an "exorbitant number of additional Cuban
 advisers" in Angola--apparently some 6,400 more techni-
 cians.   Carreira asserted that Neto relieved Rocha from
 his post last month primarily because he signed the
 agreement without approval.   The Defense Minister added
 that Neto would visit President Pereira of Cape Verde
 on the way home from Havana.
