 rary journalism, but has always been, and
 probably still. is, a hawk in the Vietnamese
 debate.  He tells us that "the Nation's armed
 services have almost exhausted their trained
 and ready military units, with all available
 forces spread. dangerously thin in Vietnam
 and elsewhere. * * *  The commitment of
 more than 2(10,000 men to Vietnam, supported
 by  strong  air  and naval  forces,  and the

 save reduced the forces in the United States
 to a training establishment."
 This report poses for the President the
 enormously diflicult question of how much
 longer he can overrule the Joint Chiefs of
 ;'.i,aff on a limited mobilization of Reserve
 forces.  It also poses the question of whether
 ecretary kiosk realizes what he is saying
 when he tells us we have some 40 unilateral
 military commitments and that we must be
 prepared to fulfill them all.  How can the,
 American people have confidence in an ad-
 ministration which expands its commitments,
 to the extent that Secretary Rusk expands
 them in the face of the condition of the
 military foreest'
 Mr. Baldwin'.-, article raises the question,
 too, whether Secretary Rusk realizes what
 lie Is saying when he keeps telling us that the
 credibility of all our alliances all over the
 world is at stake in South Vietnam.  Can he
 really believe that our value as an ally in
 Ilurope rises when we have to draw more anti.
 more trained men out of our Armed Forces In.
 Europe  and replace  them with untrained
 mnen'?  Mr. Rusk has entangled himself in
 Lite error of failing to realize that it is not
 what the United States is willing to do but
 what in fact it is willing and able to do which
 determines the credibility of any one of its
 alliances.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 1Vlorada?l, February 14, 1966
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. Speaker:
 U' S. Policy in the Vietnam war appears to
 be definitely settled for the time being-
 The Tirnes-Picayune of New Orleans
 declares.
 It is one of building up military and cce-
 rnondc  strength  in  South  Vietnam  and
 hoLigh it may take years, to exterminate or
 banish the Vietcong-
 The newspaper states. And it adds:
 President Johnson has now indicated the
 definitive shape of the policy by saying that
 lie had the overwhelming  backing of the
 country an.cl of Congress for the course the
 ;l,dniinistra tit iii is pursuing.
 ')'he editorial declared:
 Why we are in Vietnam, it seems to us, is
 becoming better understood.  The short rea-
 son: To stop aggression.  But it is not merely
 to :atop the attempted take-over of the Viet-
 natnese.  It is even more to raise a barrier
 to the almost limitless plans of the Peiping
 Reds to spread their wars of liberation as fast
 as they can find opportunities * * *.  A long
 war in Vietnam carries with it some hazards.
 But the hazards of failing to meet the chal-
 lenge now are probably much more grave.
 Isere is a thought-provoking article on
 an issue of national concern and I am
 making it available for the REcono, where
 others can study it in depth:
 [From New Orleans  (La.)  Times-Picayune,
 Feb. 14, 1966]
 U.S. VIET POLICY SEr.SIS SETT: :D
 U.S. policy in the Vietnam war appears to
 be definitely settled for the time ;icing. It
 is one of building up miiitary and economic
 strength in South Vietnam and,  liough it
 may take years, to exterminate cur banish
 the Vietcong.
 President Johnson has now rods. ated the
 definitive shape of the policy by sr_?,ing that
 he had the overwhelmin; backin?; of the
 country and of Congress for the course the
 administration is pursuing.  He avers that
 there is little or no difference bet'xeen that
 policy and what main witnesses  .,a.ve said
 before the Senate Foreign Relations Commit-
 tee.   "No  one wants  to escalate the war
 no  ;nc wants to surrender and pull
 out," he said.
 Ac we read it at the moment th:: outlook
 is this: A long gruelling war with  radually
 rising pressure on the Communist; but also
 restrictions on escalation that mi;.lit result
 in a bigger war; intensified efforts to elimi-
 nate the guerrillas combined with economic
 improvement projects to lift the spirit of
 the Vietnamese in the villages and strengthen
 their will to thrust out the Vietcong infil-
 trators.
 The economic-morale problem won't be
 solved. in a, month or a year but it has to
 be a part of a winning war (and ;  tar war)
 strategy.  Experts believe that th.+ job can
 be clone if it is pursued with the c 'termina-
 tion  that should mark all aspects of the
 war effort.
 This country will pursue its drive for nego-
 tiations  to  end  the  hostilities.   Nothing
 promising has yet developed.  Un, it it does,
 there is no alternative to gcttini; on with
 the war business.
 The "quit Vietnam" element in ,no United
 ht,.i ces hoc; been having its say.  From here
 out it probably will be looked on with in-
 creasing disapproval whirrever it is shown
 to  interfere  with  the  deadly se:ions  war
 effort.
 Why we are in Vietnam, it sears to us,
 is becoming better understood.  't'he short
 reason: To stop aggression.  But it is not
 merely to stop the attempted t; umcover of
 the Vietnamese.  It is even more to raise a
 barrier to the almost limitless plains of the
 Peiping R,,ds to spread their wars of libera-
 tion as fast as they can find opportunities.
 There is nothing secret about thee; Chinese
 sponsored national liberation front:. as stand-
 ing policy with the Mao regime and its satel-
 lites.  Any success with i; in Viet: am would
 probably open up a bag of troubles in areas
 outreaching southeast Asia.
 A long war in Vietnam carries wi;,ti it some
 hazards.  But the hazards of faili !r, to meet
 the challenge now are probably much more
 grave.

 February 21, 1966        CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 addressed a letter to the President of the
 District Board of Commissioners, in
 which he transmitted a draft of a bill
 which had been prepared by the Board of
 Optometry in cooperation with the Dis-
 trict of Columbia Department of Occupa-
 tions and Professions, the Optometric
 Society of the District of Columbia, and
 the American Optometric Association. It
 was designed to improve the District law
 as it pertains to the practice of optom-
 etry.  The bill I have proposed contains
 all of the essential provisions of the
 Board's draft.  As pointed out in Dr.
 Ephraim's letter, there is nothing in it
 that is not now contained in the laws of
 one or more of the States.  The purpose
 of the revision is to bring the standards
 of practice in the city of Washington up
 to a level which exists in most of our
 States and will provide adequate protec-
 tion for the visual needs of persons seek-
 ing vision care within the District of Co-
 lumbia.
 As the Nation's Capital, we have visi-
 tors from all over the world and from
 every part of our country. They are en-
 titled to the same high standards for the
 practice of optometry which prevail in
 their home communities.  Mr. Speaker,
 that is the purpose of the bill which I
 have introduced. I hope that it will re-
 ceive prompt and favorable action by
 the House District Committee and the
 THOSE WHO COUNT
 (Mr. HULL asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute and to revise and extend his remarks
 and include an editorial.)
 Mr. HULL.  Mr. Speaker-
 America has the courage, the will, and
 the resources to defend the frontlines of
 freedom against the tide of Communist ag-
 gression.
 These words appeared recently in an
 editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer,
 which properly believes that America's
 purpose and commitment in Vietnam
 were made a matter of formal public
 record in the historic Hawaii meeting.
 Meanwhile, the -newspaper states:
 With  Vice  President  HUMPHREY  accom-
 panying the South Vietnamese leaders back
 to Saigon on the first leg of an extensive
 diplomatic mission to rally the forces of free-
 dom in Asia, the implementation of policies
 agreed upon at Honolulu is underway.
 Even as the war goes on, the Inquirer
 believes :
 There will be an acceleration of coopera-
 tive programs by American and South Viet-
 namese officials to improve the economy of
 South Vietnam, raise the living standards,
 fight  hunger  and  disease and  build  the
 foundations of a democratic, self-governing
 society.
 The Inquirer is convinced that:
 The United States, in alliance with South
 Vietnam, holds the trump cards-in mili-
 tary power, in economic resources, and in
 the moral issue of self-determination versus
 Communist enslavement.
 This is an impressive, forthright sum-
 mation of the situation and I would like
 to make it available to others by having
 it printed in the RECORD.
 THE DECLARATION OF HONOLULU
 America's purpose in Vietnam, and Amer-
 ica's commitment to the South Vietnamese
 Government and people, have been made a
 matter of formal public record in the historic
 conference at Honolulu.
 With the return of President Johnson and
 his advisers to Washington, and with Vice
 President   HUMPHREY   accompanying  the
 South Vietnamese leaders back to Saigon on
 the first leg of an extensive diplomatic mis-
 sion to rally the forces of freedom in Asia,
 the implementation of policies agreed upon
 at Honolulu is underway.
 What,  precisely,  are  these  policies  pro-
 claimed jointly by the United States and
 South Vietnam?
 Essentially, they are a mutual resolve to
 frustrate Communist attempts to conquer
 the territory and people of South Vietnam
 by armed aggression and terrorism.
 The Red assaults will be counterd by de-
 fensive military action, of whatever intensity
 is required and for as long as necessary.
 Tireless  efforts  to  achieve  a  negotiated
 peace will continue.
 Meanwhile, even as the war goes on, there
 will be an acceleration of cooperative pro-
 grams by American and South Vietnamese
 officials to improve the economy of South
 Vietnam,  raise the  living standards, fight
 hunger and disease, and build the founda-
 tions of a democratic, self-governing society.
 How, it is being asked in some quarters,
 are these noble goals of freedom and peace
 and democracy-so solemnly proclaimed in
 the Declaration of Honolulu-to be achieved
 when the Communist North Vietnamese re-
 fuse to negotiate and when the South Viet-
 namese                                                                   vow  never  to  recognize  the  Red
 Vietcong?
 There is no clear answer because, in our
 judgment, it is the wrong question. The
 wailing voices of woe, who call constantly for
 an American surrender in Vietnam, manage
 always and very conventiently to overlook
 the problems confronting the Communists.
 The United States, in alliance with South
 Vietnam, holds the trump cards-in military
 power, in economic resources, and in the
 moral  issue  of  self-determination  versus
 Communist enslavement.
 We believe that He Chi Minh and his com-
 rades in Hanoi are the ones who ought to
 be worrying the most about escalation of the
 war-and we suspect they are.
 America has the courage, the will, and the
 resources to defend the front lines of free-
 dom against the tide of Communist aggres-
 sion.                                                                   Let this be the message Vice President
 HUMPHREY conveys.
 ALLOWANCE OF TAX DEDUCTIONS
 FOR MOVING EXPENSES
 (Mr.  RONCALIO  asked  and  was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute and to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. RONCALIO.   Mr. Speaker, to-
 day it is my pleasure to introduce a
 bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code
 to avoid tax discrimination against the
 construction worker.
 These builders of America have been
 truly the forgotten and neglected people
 of our generation. Too often their needs
 have been given a back seat to the less
 meritorious  demands  of  more  en-
 trenched groups.
 Specifically, the inequity which I hope
 to correct is in the allowance of deduc-
 tions for moving expenses for workers of
 the trades and crafts of the construction
 industry.
 The Internal Revenue Code provides
 a general rule that:
 There shall  be  allowed  as a  deduction
 moving expenses * * * in connection with
 the commencement of work by the taxpay-
 er as an employee at a new principal place
 of work.  (Internal Revenue Code 217.)
 This is a good principle, Mr. Speaker,
 and it has general application for almost
 everyone  except  those  who  need  it
 most-the construction worker.
 The code goes on, in its conditions for
 allowance of the deduction, to provide
 time limitations and other requirements
 which virtually eliminate the construc-
 tion worker.  In short, the effect is that
 the worse a construction worker needs
 this deduction, and the more he really
 deserves it-the less his actual chances
 are of obtaining it-Internal Revenue
 Code, section 217 (c) (2).
 This, Mr. Speaker, is the inequity my
 bill is designed to correct and it is my
 sincere hope that my colleagues will see
 its merit and offer their active support
 for this amendment.
 FOOD FOR FREEDOM
 (Mr. TODD asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. TODD.  Mr. Speaker, President
 Johnson said in his food-for-freedom
 message:
 A balance  between agricultural produc-
 tivity and population is necessary to prevent
 the  shadow                    of hunger  from becoming  a
 nightmare of famine.
 This last week, at the gracious invita-
 tion of Chairman COOLEY of the House
 Committee on Agriculture, I was privi-
 leged to hear 10 distinguished experts
 submit their predictions and then offer
 their recommendations as to how this
 "nightmare of famine" might be avoided.
 Their recommendations fell into two
 broad categories, as I understood them:
 First. Make every effort to reduce
 rates of population growth.
 Second. Make every effort to increase
 agricultural productivity in these same
 lands faced with the blight of famine
 closing in over them.
 Every witness emphasized that there
 was no apparent means of providing
 adequate food for those who have joined
 the banquet of life while the population
 explosion becomes more violent.   The
 last witness, Prof. Theodore Schultz, of
 the University of Chicago, urged that
 adequate  American  agricultural  re-
 sources be devoted to providing food for
 those now starving; that we follow the
 recommendations of the President in
 assisting our friends to modernize their
 agriculture; and that we allocate a por-
 tion of the funds received from the sale
 of food for freedom to family planning
 and birth control activities.
 I offered this last idea to the House in
 a speech made following the President's
 message.  Since then, I have explored it
 more fully, and considered it in the light
 of the remarks of these outstanding ex-
 perts which have appeared before the
 distinguished Committee on Agriculture.
 I should like to offer it in more detail

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE        February 21, 1966
 today, so that it may be further dis-
 cussed and improved.
 On February 14, the gentleman from
 North Carolina [Mr. COOLEY] introduced
 the food--for'-freedom bill, H.R. 127135.
 Section 103(b) of title I includes a pro-
 vi.;ion that the President may determine
 that foreign currencies may be received
 as payment for food for freedom in order
 to implement certain purposes defined
 by subsections (a), (b), (c), and (e) of
 section 304.  I suggest that section 103
 (ii) he extended to include a new sub-
 section t i i of section 304.
 I suggest that to section 304 be added
 a new suosection (i), which might read
 as follows :
 E'er financing programs emphasizing ma-
 Cereal, child health and nutrition, and family
 planning services, and research activities re-
 lai;ed to the problems of population growth,
 for which purpose not less than fifteen per
 centum of the currencies received pursuant
 to title I shall be available, through and un-
 der the procedures established by the P resi-
 dent upon request of the country with which
 the agreernent is made: Provided, That the
 t're:adent is authorized to carry out the fore-
 going provisions of this subsection through
 any agency of the United States, or any i.n-
 te' r,ational  agency and/or organization of
 which the United States is a member, and
 which he determines is qualified to a.dnainis-
 Lee such activities.
 This would mean that food for freedom
 would be used twice: one, to help fill
 empty stomachs now; and twice, to avoid
 empty stomachs in the future.  This is
 the basic merit of the idea.
 Now let us explore the idea in some-
 what more detail.  It suggests providing
 a total family service-to the mother, to
 her children, and to the entire family
 group.   it is directed to the health, well-
 being, and happiness of all of them. And
 if the program were implemented as a
 unit-directed to the mother, father, and
 the children, it would achieve its greatest
 effectiveness at the least cost.
 Dr. W. H. Sebrell, Jr., director of the
 School of Nutrition Sciences at Coluni-
 bia University, testified before the coin-
 mittee:
 i'roteirl  calorie malnutrition  is  actur.lly
 one of the largest causes of the death of
 children.         It  is  estimated  that  70    per-
 cent of the children in developing areas suf-
 fer                              from  malnutrition  and    upward  of  3
 million children die annually from malnutri-
 Lion, largely of this type.  This fact is hid-
 den because these deaths often are recorded
 being from diarrhea, parasites, and in-
 fectious diseases.  If these children were well
 nourished, they would not die of the inter-
 current diseases.  In those millions it does
 not kill, nelnu.trition permanently impairs
 their growth and probably causes irreversi-
 ble  meulul  and emotional  damage.   'l'ate
 mother's ignorance is of the greatest irn-
 purta.nce to the nutrition of the small child
 1i that she does not recognize that the child
 is suiferiug irons malnutrition.
 My provision would look to this child
 health and nutrition problem.  It wo'ald
 look to the health of the mother.  And it
 would provide her, if she wished, in-
 formation on family planning and birth
 control, so that she and her husband
 nri,ht space and number their family in
 the manner in which they feel they could
 best support it. Therefore, this provision
 would assist the parents, and offer them
 personal help.
 It would assist the children, now be-
 ing., and those unborn, to better realize
 their potentials, and it would move to
 eliminate the social and political in-
 stability which accompanies hunger and
 frustration.
 What of the other part of the prob-
 lem-providing more food for the total
 increases in population which will occur,
 even if family planning programs are
 given a great push.    In hi, message,
 President Johnson said:
 Many of the developing countries urgently
 need to give a higher priority to improving
 and modernizing their own production and
 distribution of food.
 Section 103 of title I of the bill intro-
 duced by Chairman COOLEY says "take
 into account efforts of countries to help
 themselves toward a greater degree of
 s1-1f-reliance,  especially  in  providing
 enough food to meet the needs of their
 peope, and the resources required to at-
 tain that objective." The bill ;s intended
 to help increase the agriculture pro-
 ductivity of nations as rapidly as pos-
 sible-which is the other side of the coin.
 Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I believe the
 addition of the section I have suggested
 would round out this important legisla-
 tion,                                                                            s id make it a total attack on
 hunger, deprivation, and the terror of
 famine.  Today,  unlimited  population
 growth is on a collision course with
 limited food supply.  Only total attack
 will ave t disaster.
 OUR FRIENDS, THE 1'EDS
 (Mr. WELTNER asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr.  WELTNER.   Mr.  Speaker,  my
 friend Opie L. Shelton, executive vice
 president and general manager of the
 Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, has long
 since established hirnseif as a man of
 unusual clarity and vision.  One of his
 many services to Atlanta and the State
 of Georgia is his continuing attempt to
 effect a realistic attitude toward the Fed-
 eral Government.  I laud his most re-
 cent effort, an article in the February
 is sue of Atlanta magazine.  It is a force-
 ful presentation, and I include it at this
 point in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:
 [From the Atlanta Magazine, February 1966]
 One FRIEND:, THE FED';
 (By Opie L. Shelton)
 The  reason Atlanta has becooie partners
 with the Federal Government in so many
 projects is that Georgia's State government
 has failed to enter the world of reality where
 her  cities are concerned.
 The old county ilni   system, one of the
 greatest calamities  any State ever experi-
 enced, was the prime villain.  I. placed the
 absolute control of State government in the
 bands of people who were openly antagonistic
 to the cities.   Atlanta was their favorite
 whipping boy.
 Today Atlanta receives less financial as-
 sistance from the  state                                                                                  than any of the
 largest 25 cities of the Nation.  l(ven though
 the county unit has been abol;shed (cour-
 tesy of the Federal Government)  many of
 the people who run the State still think in
 county unit fashion.  They still don't under-
 stand the problem, nor do many of them
 seem to want to understand.
 Georgia  has moved from a rural to an
 urban society, but so far as the State govern-
 ment's reaction to urban  needs,  are  con-
 cerned one might think we were still living
 in a cotton-dominated economy.
 The State highway department is a good
 example.  If it had not been for the Federal
 Government we wouldn't have even the piti-
 fully few major thoroughfares we have today.
 That department's philosophy has been so
 politically-oriented that the cities have been
 systematically shunted aside when the high-
 way tax dollar has been divided.
 State government that isn't responsive to
 the needs of its cities is soon going to find
 itself * * * useless * * *     America   will
 double its population by the year 2000, we are
 told, and better than 90 percent of that
 growth is going to be in urban areas.
 The Federal Government appears to un-
 derstand these simple facts of life.                                                                                                                                                And
 that is why Atlanta and every other growing
 city is forced to beat a path to Washington.
 A city that is treated as an unwanted child
 must, of necessity, seek a foster parent.
 Most of the people who yell loudest about
 States' rights and cry havoc about big Fed-
 eral Government are those who have done the
 least to exercise the responsibilities that go
 along with States' rights.  They are phonies
 and frauds to the core.
 If State governments arc to survive they
 had better take inventory and begin to ex-
 ercise better judgment in their treatment of
 their cities.
 SUBCOMMITTEE ON REGULATORY
 AGENCIES OF THE SELECT COM-
 MITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS
 Mr. DINGEI-L.  Mr.  Speaker, I ask
 unanimous consent that the Subcommit-
 tee on Regulatory Agencies of the Select
 Committee on Small Business have per-
 mission to sit this afternoon during gen-
 eral debate; and I make the same re-
 quest for Wednesday and Thursday of
 this week.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 There was no objection.
 WATCH THE TROJAN HORSE
 (Mr. MONAGAN asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. MONAGAN.  Mr. Speaker, Sena-
 tor KENNEDY and others would have us
 welcome the Vietcong into the process of
 settling the fighting in Vietnam by in-
 viting them to be a part of any future
 government there.
 History  indicates  that  this  course
 would be full of danger.
 In this connection, it is appropriate
 to quote the words of the distinguished
 historian, Samuel Eliot Morison, in his
 recently published "Oxford History of the
 American. People."  Writing about the
 Iron Curtain and the diplomatic mistakes
 which the Allies made at the close of the
 war, he says:
 The final mistake was the assumption that
 a joint regime, Communist and non-?Cori-
 munist, would work in defeated or liberated
 countries, like the "popular front" govern-
 ments before the war.
 Later, he says:
 The' event proved that no popular front
 with Communists could have any other re-
 sult but a Communist Party takeover.
 It is clear that we must proceed care-
 fully in this respect.  This does not mean

 Kabriel said Belton shouted out, "It's
 your duty to get up to the captain," crawled
 over to the reluctant radioman, grabbed the
 apparatus and moved up under fire to his
 captain.
 Spriggs has used him as his radioman
 ever since.
 "Belton in his conduct and bearing has
 been above average as a soldier and a valu-
 able asset," Sprigg said.  "He has worked in
 very well socially and he has got along with
 the men.
 "I am personally satisfied that he now
 honestly believes his actions in the past have
 not been consistent with being a soldier or a
 man.
 "I personally wrote to the commanding
 general recommending that he be promoted
 and his sentence remitted.  Belton has seen
 men fight and die for his country, and he has
 felt the honor that comes when you do fight."
 Spriggs tried to promote Belton 2 months
 ago, but the Army wanted to wait longer.
 Spriggs was told he must be absolutely sure
 Belton had changed his ways.
 "I told Belton he deserved to be pro-
 moted," Spriggs said.  I knew he was happy.
 SHRDLU
 (Mr. HOSMER asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. HOSMER.  Mr. Speaker, many
 Federal Government employees availed
 themselves of the retirement benefits
 which were theirs provided they retired
 by the end of December 1965.  Perhaps
 it is the loss of well-trained oldtimers in
 the printing business which is causing
 the Government Printing Office diffi-
 culties in preparing the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD.
 Whatever the problem, I call attention
 to the garbled form in which my exten-
 sion of remarks appeared in the RECORD
 on February 7, 1966, page A545, entitled
 "Nuclear Nonproliferation Resolution,"
 and on February 8, 1966, page A613, en-
 titled "Special Report on Vietnam."
 I ask unanimous consent that these
 two statements be reprinted correctly at
 this point in the RECORD and the perma-
 nent bound RECORD be corrected accord-
 ingly:
 From: Representative CRAIG HOSMER, chair-
 man, Committee on Nuclear Affairs.
 To: House GOP Conference.
 Subject: Senate Resolution 179 urging nego-
 tiation of a nonproliferation treaty.
 Tomorrow the Joint Committee on Atomic
 Energy will take testimony from Secretary of
 State Dean Rusk on Senate Resolution 179
 and companion bills in both Houses which
 urge the negotiation of a treaty banning the
 spread  of  nuclear  weapons.   Negotiations
 toward this end currently are going on in
 Geneva  at  the   17-Nation     Disarmament
 Conference.
 Present members of the nuclear club in
 order  of seniority  are  the  United States,
 United Kingdom, U.S.S.R., France, and Red
 China.  Sidewalk estimators claim 10 to 20
 more countries could achieve nuclear weap-
 ons if they want to spend the money to do, so.
 The most frequently mentioned candidates
 for membership are India, Israel, and the
 United Arab Republic.  The Russians also
 talk much about their dread of West Ger-
 many getting the bomb even though it does
 not appear to be doing anything about it.
 Senate Resolution 179 undoubtedly will
 pass,  It is doubtful the Joint Committee on
 Atomic Energy can find any persuasive wit-
 nesses favoring the spread of A-bombs and
 H-bombs.  Politically being proproliferation
 is about the same as being pro-sin and anti-
 motherhood.  Therefore passing the resolu-
 tion will be something of a pious platitude.
 It could achieve significance, however, if it
 is amended as follows:
 1. To recommend that the nonprolifera-
 tion agreement be accomplished by amend-
 ment of the existing limited test ban treaty;
 and
 2. To recommend that the limited test ban
 treaty be further amended at the same time
 to  permit  the  peaceful  use  of  nuclear
 explosives.
 Present terms of the limited test ban treaty
 make these uses practically impossible. The
 United States has a real need to dig a second
 Panama Canal and using nuclear excavating
 techniques will make the second canal eco-
 nomically feasible.  We will have other proj-
 ects requiring these techniques, so will many
 other countries even including the U.S.S.R.
 For mankind's benefit it is time the peace-
 ful nuclear explosives' locker be unlocked.
 This is a way to do it.
 SPECIAL REPORT ON VIETNAM
 (By Congressman CRAIG HOSMER)
 "Vietniks" demand we get out of Vietnam.
 Mothers wonder why their sons are  sent
 there. The President wants to negotiate.
 Military leaders want a victory.  Most Ameri-
 cans believe we should see it through. There
 are many questionp about the war.
 What is the country like?         Half the size,
 but similar in shape, population, and coast-
 line to California.  It's rugged-mostly thick
 tropical forests, dense mangrove swamps, and
 concealing rice paddies.  Vietnam is more a
 collection of small villages and hamlets than
 a strong nation to which the people give
 allegiance as we do to our country.   The
 people are very poor.  Until recently their
 only contacts with their Government were
 visits from the tax collector with no benefits
 in return.  Along with Laos, Cambodia, and
 North Vietnam, South Vietnam was created
 from French Indochina after France's 1953
 defeat in Dienbienphu.
 Who are the Vietcong?  The Vietcong are
 strong Communist forces seeking to seize
 South Vietnam with the same war of libera-
 tion strategy used successfully in Cuba. Fol-
 lowing 1953, the North Vietnamese Commu-
 nist dictatorship of He Chi Minh saw the
 south as ripe for takeover by this means.
 The war now is in its 12th year.  Red China,
 just to the north, encourages the aggression
 by supplying great amounts of munitions.
 How do the VC fight war of liberation?
 Strictly according to Communist doctrine.
 Cadres of VC political organizers and disci-
 plined military units infiltrated South Viet-
 nam.  Glittering Red promises of a better
 life recruited thousands of South Vietnamese
 into VC. ranks.   Where  promises  failed,
 threats were used. Systematic terrorism be-
 gan.  Village chiefs, school teachers and offi-
 cials were murdered wholesale.' Kill-and-hide
 tactics-so effective in Vietnam's concealing
 terrain-were used by VC military units to
 capture much of the country.  Final victory
 was to be capped by consolidating guerrilla
 bands back into regular military regiments
 for the last battles.
 Why haven't the VC won?       For two rea-
 sons:  First, millions of South Vietnamese
 would rather be dead than Red.   They've
 fought back desperately and valiantly. Sec-
 ond, the United States has helped them fight.
 To begin with, by supplies and military ad-
 visers and now directly with over 160,000
 men and more coming every day.  Early this
 summer the tide of battle began to change.
 Now it's the VC who suffer setbacks.
 Why Is the United States fighting?  For at
 least three strong reasons: (1) Born in free-
 dom, our country cares for the freedom of
 others.  (2) Should South Vietnam fall, so
 will  Laos  and  Cambodia-then  Thailand,
 Malaysia, Burma, and Indonesia. Ultimately
 all of Asia-the Philippines, Formosa, Korea,
 Japan, and New Guinea-could pass behind
 the Bambo Curtain.  We fought World War
 II to keep the Far East from domination by
 a single, determined aggressor who would
 force our first line of defense back to the
 Pacific coast.  We fight in Vietnam for the
 same reason.    (3) Castro got away with his
 war of liberation..  If we don't defeat this
 one; the Communists surely will start more
 of them all over Latin America, Africa and
 elsewhere in the world.  U.S. troubles will be
 endless.
 What we are doing in Vietnam is morally
 right, militarily sound and geopolitically
 correct.
 How do U.S. forces fight?  At sea Navy
 Task Force 77's carrier aircraft share with
 the U.S. Air Force  an  around-the-clock
 harassment of North Vietnam, bombing and
 strafing anything that moves on roads, rails,
 or trails. In South Vietnam they blitz sus-
 pected Vietcong concentrations.  They are
 on immediate radio call to aid friendly units
 engaged  on  the  ground.  The Navy  also
 hunts and sinks Vietcong shipping in South
 Vietnam's inland waterways and along the
 coastline. Its  guns  fire at  enemy units
 ashore.  A  U.S.  naval  officer assists the
 captain of each Vietnamese Navy ship.
 On land the Vietcong enemy wears no uni-
 form and assumes many disguises. He may
 be anywhere-a laborer or farmer by day, a
 guerrilla at. night. There are no front lines.
 One is seldom out of range of the fighting
 anywhere in South Vietnam.  The U.S. Army
 and marines fight independently and in co-
 operation with Vietnamese forces to search
 out and destroy the enemy.  Often the Viet-
 cong cannot be identified until he fires at
 you.
 How  is  U.S,  morale  In   Vietnam?  It's
 tops-ashore, afloat, and in the air.  A fight-
 ing day may last 16 to 20 hours-our men
 are glad to take it. They know their job
 and its importance.  They want to win and
 are  determined to do so.   I talked with
 many wounded in field hospitals.   They want
 to recover quickly and get back to their
 fighting units.  They feel the demonstrators
 at home stab them in the back as they face
 the enemy and are as hostile to them as the
 Vietcong.
 Do planners in Washington try too much
 to run the war?  Most probably.  The volume
 of instructions to generals and admirals on
 the spot is tremendous.  They know as much
 about fighting this kind of war without let-
 ting it get out of hand 'as Washington does.
 They know the circumstances at hand much
 better.  It would seem wiser to give them
 more  authority  while   still  reserving  top
 policy decisions to the Pentagon.
 What would happen if we pulled out of
 Vietnam?  Our resolve and action is the key-
 stone of free world resistance to Communist
 aggression all over the world.  Pull out that
 keystone  and  everything  collapses.   Red
 China and the U.S.S.R. get a green light to
 take over most of the world.
 Why not declare war, bomb Hanoi, block-
 ade the north, etc.?  Wisdom of these actions
 must be kept under constant review.     For
 the present we do a good job destroying sup-
 plies from Red China and reinforcements
 from North Vietnam.   Also, supplies from
 the U.S.S.R. and other bloc countries are
 coming in less quantity than might be ex-
 pected.  Should we escalate in North Viet-
 nam, it would give Ho Chi Minh cause to call
 on his allies for more effective help.  Thus,
 these are two sides to the coin when con-
 templating these possible actions.  We want
 the best one up.

 Should we use atomic weapons?  In ray
 judgment this amount of force is not needed
 against targets in North Vietnam and the
 Ideation  of friendly forces  and people in
 Louth Vietnam is too close for their safe use.
 slow about using nonlethal gases?  These
 agents, such as tear gas and nausea gas,
 could be uued very effectively. Example:
 clean out enemy caves and tunnels with non-
 lethal gas Instead of lethal explosives.                          A
 let of killing could be avoided and the work
 of our forces made easier.  The gas here sug-
 gusted for use does not kill and does not
 icave lasting aftereffects.  It is unlike World
 War I's deadly gases which created so much
 Ii rrrnr.
 tan we !lght cold war along with the hot?
 faaeed we do.  Realizing this is the key to
 understanding why military victory over the
 Vietcong is only part of the job in Vietnam.
 To win final. victory and get out we must
 create  a,  strong nation there--stable  and
 able to t;,ke care of itself militarily and in
 other ways.  This means convincing the peo-
 ple that Communist promises are hollow-
 that the better life comes from their own
 free government and alliance with the United
 S cites.
 I: low do we fight. cold war?  In addition
 to lightin  every one of our servicemen does
 something to make the people's lives better.
 As they liberate a village they bring in food
 grad  medical  supplies;  they help  rebuild
 schools,  roads  and  other public services.
 This is clone through and in cooperation
 with Vietnamese Government officials.     It
 t+-aches the latter how government should
 serve the people.  It demonstrates to the
 hviple tl;at real benefits--riot just hollow
 promises---foitow  allegiance  to      their  own
 government.  It also demonstrates to     the
 Vietcong they have chosen the wrong side-
 ivany are  defecting from                               the  Communist
 Salo.
 WW V,, also have in Vietnam many hundreds of
 d?ciicated U.S. civilians in the U.S. Inlor-
 tro-tion Service and AID mission.  They risk
 their live; daily to carry the war for men's
 minds to the rice roots-right inside enemy
 strongholds.  They also help build up the
 country's economy to make it self-sustain-
 ing.  They often fly through heavy barrages
 of  antiaircraft  fire  to  drop  millions  of
 lc:i.ilets urging surrender o1 the Vietcong and
 rallying the people to their government.    An
 irnoortanc part of their ammunition is re-
 110 supplies for the people bought by con-
 tiibutiont; Iron Americans.
 W, When wilt we win in Vietnam?  No one
 f.-in  predwt when or how the military war
 will end.  Right now it looks like the Vietcong
 .fort will intensify for a while, then it could
 liter our; niter some months-hut terror
 tactics will  continue  much  longer.  Final
 victory will take a long time.  We must vin

 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 tiail eons matter.)
 Mr. SAYLOR.  Mr. Speaker, with the
 celebration  of George  Washington's
 birthday, I must call the attention of the
 Congress to a series of recent editorials
 emphasizing the imminent danger to the
 view from Mount Vernon if Congress
 does not act during this session.
 These excellent editorials testify to the
 efforts of my colleague, the gentleman
 from Maryland, HERVEY MACI1EN, to prod
 the administration and the Congress into
 fulfilling the commitment niade in the
 early 1960's with the  passat"  of Public
 Law 87-362, to save the view horn Mount
 Vernon.  This law was introduced by
 Senator CLINTON ANDERSON lil the Sen-
 ate and by the gentleman from Colorado,
 Chairman WAYNE ASPINALL, and myself
 in the House.
 `Kith the passage of that law--without
 a dissenting vote--the Accokc,,k Founda-
 tion under the presidency of our beloved
 colleague, the gentlewoman rom Ohio,
 FRANCES  BOLTON,  along with the Alice
 Fer>,uson Foundation, agreed to donate
 to the Federal Goverfunent, without cost,
 about half the land needed to protect the
 view.
 l3eyond that, over 130 private landown-
 ers have, without cost, donated scenic
 easements to the Department, of the In-

 view from Mount Vernon.
 The State of Maryland has Passed pio-
 neering tax reform legislation recogniz-
 Lig the public purpose of these donations,
 and  the  Prince  Georges  County has
 passed the first local scenic space laws
 in the land, giving tax credits to the
 donors.
 This is the greatest joining together
 of private, foundation, county, State, and
 Federal efforts to preserve our heritage
 for the people of this Nation.
 Here is the one shining example of a
 project where everyone has done his
 part-except the Federal Government.
 Unless the Federal Government acts
 now-at this session of Colgress-this
 great pilot project will  dismally fail.
 Other States, counties, organizations, and
 Lidividuals throughout the Nation, who
 have watched the development of this
 unique project, may well be discouraged
 in their efforts.
 ]Fortunately, my colleague, the gentle-
 man                                                                  from  Maryland,  HERVE?Y  MACHEN,
 who took office in January 1965. and who
 represents the area in Marlland oppo-
 site Mount Vernon, has placed before us
 a, bill to get the Federal Government
 moving again.  This bill provides for the
 hlcreases in land prices due to the Gov-
 es'nment procrastination in purchasing
 the remaining acreage needed.
 We have been constantly reminding
 the Congress and the executive that fur-
 ther delays and procrastination will be
 the death knell of this project to which
 so many have devoted so much.  Con-
 gressmal'1 MACHEN deserves our full sup-
 port in this campaign to complete this
 task so well begun..
 'T'o lose all that has been accomplished
 would be a real tragedy.  They loss would
 he not only of the millions of dollars
 worth of lands and rights in lands being
 patriotically donated without cost, but
 also the loss of the pilot project in which
 Federal funds are outweighed by foun-
 dation and private donations, and the
 protection of natural beauty of a large
 area is accomplished without increased
 expense, dislocation of families, and at-
 tendant problems.
 Congressman MACHEN has thought-
 fully said:
 If we can show the country how we can
 carry out an experiment in cooperative and
 coordinated scenic protection such as this
 program at Piscataway Park opposite Mount
 Vernon, we are setting the stage for a great
 movement, across the country.
 11 the Congress does not act on Con-
 gressman MACHEN's bill this session, we
 will have failed.  We cannot wait loner
 for the Department of the Interior to
 make up its mind whether or not to sup-
 port the President's year-old program
 to make the Potomac a "model river of
 scenic and recreation values for the
 country."
 Let us move quickly to do our part, as
 indicated in these recent editorials:
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star,
 Dec. 15, 1965 [
 TIIREAT AT PISCATAWAY
 Back in                                                                                    1961 Congress leaped at a rare
 opportunity to preserve forever, at moderate
 Federal cost, more than 1,100 acres of choice
 shoreline property along the Potomac near
 Maryland's Piscataway Creek-directly across
 the river from historic Mount Vernon.
 fn brief,  this  remarkable  deal  provided
 that the Federal Government need buy only
 about half the newly authorized Piscataway
 Park.   The remainder,  it was understood,
 would be acquired entirely by private dona-
 tion.                                                                                                                                    And the 1961 law also authorized the
 Park Service to seek scenic easements--also
 free-restricting obtrusive development in a
 vast area of an additional 2,596 acres con-
 tiguous to the park.
 Well, the private part of the bargain has
 progressed. with phenomenal success.  Thus
 far, private foundations have actually do-
 nated or committed themselves to donate
 some 499 acres for the park.   Scenic case-
 m.euts have been contributed by more than
 1.20 landowners, involving about 900 acres
 of land.  These generous donations are con-
 ditioned, however, as might be expected, on
 the firm understanding that the Government
 meet its obligation.  And the sad fact is that
 the time when these donations may begin
 to  revert from Federal  control is rapidly
 approaching.
 For the Government has not held up its
 end.   Thus  far,  only 97 acres have been
 bought-largely because the figure author-
 ized for expenditure by Congress in the 1961
 act has proved to be grossly inadequate. Be-
 fore further funds will be appropriated, i,he
 authorization needs to be increased some
 $2.5 million.  Representative Ilmnmy MAC, 11 EN
 is leading the sensible legislative fight for
 the increase, and seems to have rmet a :done
 Wall.
 The latest frustration surprisingly came
 from the conservation-minded Interior De-
 partment itself, which the other day recom-
 mended to Congress that the Machen bill be
 "deferred"' pending the outcome of "a broad
 study" of all of Interior's land-acquisit,on
 programs.  The presumption is tlu:it the study
 will wind up early next year.  But there is
 no assurance of that, and, even if there were,
 any loss of time at this stage of the Piscata-
 way project constitutes a threat.

 washy approach, Secretary Udall should be
 boating the drums for the Machen bill. With
 assurance that the Federal Government in-
 tends to carry out its agreement, there is
 every reason to believe that other donations
 of land, and many more donations of ease-

 ing war threatened this Nation, the Coast
 Guard found it necessary to expand as
 rapidly as possible, and thus the Coast
 Guard Reserve came into being.
 With the outbreak of war in Europe in
 September  1939, Coast Guard ships,,
 planes, and stations were ordered to car-
 ry out extensive patrols to insure that
 merchant ships in our waters did not vio-
 late the neutrality proclaimed by Presi-
 dent Roosevelt.  The next summer the
 Coast Guard began its port security oper-
 ations under the revised Espionage Act of
 1917 and the newly enacted Dangerous
 Cargo Act.
 On November 1, 1941, the Coast Guard
 was ordered to operate as part of the
 Navy.  The next month Pearl Harbor
 was bombed, and we were in the war. As
 in World War I, a big part of the Coast
 Guard's task was antisubmarine warfare.
 Coast Guard cruising cutters and convoy
 escorts helped with the battle of the At-
 lantic as they sank 11 U-boats.  At the
 same time, more than 4,000 survivors of
 torpedoings and other enemy action were
 rescued from the Atlantic and Mediter-
 ranean by Coast Guardsmen.
 But there were losses too. The cutter
 Hamilton went down while in tow after
 being torpedoed off Iceland.  The Aca-
 cia was sunk in the Caribbean; Escanaba,
 Leopold, Muskeget, and Natsek in the
 Atlantic; Serpens in the Pacific.  Only
 two of the crew survived Escanaba-no
 one, on board Muskeget, Serpens, or Nat-
 sek. More than 90 percent of those who
 went down with these vessels were mem-
 bers of the newly established Reserve
 component of the Coast Guard.
 When she was desperately needed for
 convoy duty in the North Atlantic and
 was thrown into the breach to help stem
 the mounting losses to German subma-
 rines, the Escanaba was based at Grand
 Haven, Mich. The members of her crew
 and their families were a valued and
 highly respected part of that small com-
 munity. The tragic loss of the Escanaba
 with all but two of her crew was a deep
 and personal tragedy to that entire re-
 gion.  Today,  those  men  are  still
 mourned in Grand Haven. Each year,
 memorial exercises are conducted there,
 in memory of the Escanaba and the gal-
 lant men who perished when that ves-
 sel went down.

 ment Act.
 Through its intensive and well-or-

 Guard Reserve is today a highly trained
 and efficient organization which, I am
 confident, that if called to the, defense
 of this Nation, would prove to be both
 ready and reliable and once again would
 serve with honor and distinction.  I am

 BOYCOTTING SHIPS OF NATIONS
 SUPPLYING NORTH VIETNAM
 (Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker,
 the action taken on February 18, 1966,
 by the Maritime Trades Department of
 the AFL-CIO in proposing a boycott of
 ships of nations which permit any of its
 flag vessels to carry or supply goods to
 North Vietnam clearly reflects a deep
 concern about this intolerable situation.
 It is indeed tragic that the administra-
 tion has remained so indifferent that it
 has become necessary that individual
 efforts be undertaken to pressure our
 Government into halting this aid and
 comfort to our enemy.
 The recent administration action pro-
 hibiting vessels which engage in trade
 with the Hanoi regime from carrying
 U.S. Government financed cargoes, while
 certainly necessary, is clearly insufficient
 to bring about an end to free world
 traffic into the harbor of Haiphong.
 If the administration is not sufficiently
 concerned to stop this trade then it is
 clearly the responsibility of the Congress
 to do so.  Legislation to close our ports
 to those helping to supply North Viet-
 nam is now pending before the Congress
 and should receive our early and favor-
 able consideration.
 Mr. Speaker, this is a simple issue, and
 I predict that if the administration con-
 tinues to abdicate its responsibility of
 leadership it will continue to be shoved
 into doing whatever necessary to stop
 this trade.
 Many more reservists manned landing
 craft that hit the invasion beaches with
 assault troops at Guadalcanal, Anzio,
 Tarawa, Attu, north Africa, Salerno, Ma-
 kin,  Kwajalein,  Eniwetok,  Normandy,
 southern France, Luzon, Guam, Saipan,
 Iwo Jima, Okinawa-the Coast Guard
 Reserve made all those stops and a lot
 in between. At the conclusion of the
 war the Coast Guard had 802 vessels of
 its own and in addition was manning
 351 Navy and 288 Army craft.
 Total personnel had reached a peak of
 approximately 174,000 and of that num-
 ber more than 150,000 were Coast Guard
 reservists who had entered the service
 for wartime duty.  Many of that num-
 ber formed the nucleus for the establish-
 ment of our regular peacetime Reserve
 and are still serving with Reserve com-
 ponents.  Others have completed their
 20 or more years of satisfactory service
 and, having reached the age of 60, are
 POSTSCRIPT ON A SOLDIER
 (Mr. CALLAWAY asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks and include extraneous matter.)
 Mr.  CALLAWAY.  Mr.  Speaker,  on
 October 6 of last year I rose on the floor
 of this House to express my regret and
 deep concern over a soldier from the
 1st Cavalry Division-Airmobile,-who
 had gone on a self-imposed hunger strike
 protesting his assignment to Vietnam on
 the grounds that he disagreed with our
 policy there.  On that day, Mr. Speaker,
 the world had heard a great deal about
 this  soldier, Pvt. Winstel  Belton,  and     Sp5c. Larry Kabriel of Summerfield, Kans.,
 relatively little about the newly formed  recalls that the company was under heavy

 now a matter of record; while the story
 of Private Belton has been out of the
 news entirely.  But, Mr. Speaker, while
 he has been out of the news, a great
 change has come over this soldier.  He
 has distinguished himself in the service
 of his country, he has won honor on the
 battlefield, and has earned a promotion
 to private, first class. Therefore, I think
 it only fitting that I insert in the RECORD
 the very gratifying postscript to the story
 of Winstel Belton, as reported last week
 in an article from the Atlanta Journal:
 SOLDIER WHO WENT ON STRIKE WINS HONOR
 ON BATTLEFIELD
 (By Peter Arnett)
 BEN  CAT,       SOUTH  VIETNAM.-SiX  months
 ago a university graduate named Winstel R.
 Belton staged a 7-day hunger strike at Fort
 Benning, Ga., to dramatize his distaste for
 being drafted and his refusal to fight in
 Vietnam.
 Thursday a big, proud smile flashed across
 Belton's face as he was promoted to private,
 first class, on a battlefield in South Vietnam.
 Looking just as proud was his company
 commander, Capt. R. E. Spriggs of Mexico,
 N.Y., a professional soldier who hated every-
 thing Belton's hunger strike had stood for.
 Spriggs was furious last November when
 he returned to his unit after recovering from
 a bullet wound to find Belton assigned there.
 Spriggs said Thursday he would take the
 26-year-old Winslow, Ariz., soldier into com-
 bat with him anytime, anywhere.
 Belton  arrived  in  Vietnam  with  a  12-
 month suspended jail sentence hanging over
 his head because of his hunger strike in
 mid-August.  A court-martial had given him
 a bad conduct discharge, total forefeiture of
 pay and the jail sentence.
 But he was also given a chance.
 Belton, a Negro, was told that if he went
 to Vietnam and proved himself, he would
 not have to serve his jail sentence.  If he
 failed, he would serve it.
 His old unit, the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry
 Airmobile Division, wouldn't take him back.
 The 1st Infantry Division accepted him.
 Spriggs was the only man in A company
 of the 2d Battalion, 28th Regiment, who
 knew that the new radio-telephone operator
 was the hunger striker Belton.
 Lt. Gus Berzines, a weapons platoon-com-
 mander  from  Kalamazoo, _ Mich.,  recalled
 talking with Belton one day about various
 things and finally saying, "You mean you're
 that Belton?"
 More and more men in the unit began
 realizing that Belton had publicly protested
 what they  themselves had accepted as  a
 patriotic duty.  None of them brought up
 the subject with him except the company
 commander, and few ever discussed it among
 themselves.
 "That was his business," said Sgt. Fred-
 erick Range of Dallas, Tex.  "We treated him
 like any other soldier."
 Belton, holder of a bachelor of science de-
 gree in education, was initially cold  and
 reserved with his buddies. But the heat of
 battles in December and January melted his
 attitude and forged ever-tightening bonds
 with Spriggs  and the other men  in the
 company.
 Initially given the job of laying wires be-
 tween the company headquarters and the
 platoons, he began carrying Spriggs' radio,
 Early in January, he proved he had what

 that Vietcong, as individual South Viet-
 nainese, would not be listened to along
 with  Buddhists,  Catholics,  Montag-
 nards,                  North  Vietnamese  exiles,  and
 others. It would mean, however, that
 they would not be given an opportunity
 to move into sensitive government de-
 partments and take over by indirection
 as was done in Eastern Europe.
 It is also erucational to recall Presi-
 dent Kennedy's statement in Berlin, in
 1963, when he said:
 I am not impressed by the opportunities
 open to popular fronts throughout the world.
 I do not believe that any democrat can suc-
 cessfully ride that tiger.
 Recent dispatches from Peiping and
 Hanoi have suggested growing doubts
 about the conduct of their military effort,
 the strain on the economy, and the re-
 sulting emergence of a peace element.
 Now is the time to emphasize firmness
 rather then vacillation.
 '1'bLEVISING OF HOUSE
 1''IGOCEEDINGS
 (Mr. ICHORD asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. ICHORD.  Mr. Speaker and Mem-
 bers of the House, the eyes of the Na-
 tion last week were focused on the South
 Vietnam hearings conducted by the Sen-
 ate Foreign Relations Committee.  Most
 of the appraisals of the hearings that I
 have heard on this side of the Congress
 have been very unfavorable, but I submit
 to the Speaker-and I speak primarily to
 the House majority floor leader and the
 Speaker of the House--that there is one
 thing we should have learned from these
 hearings:   Under  no  circumstances
 should we ever permit House proceedings
 to be televised.  The televising of House
 proceedings, Mr. Speaker, is the most ef-
 fective way I know to convert serious de-
 liberative proceedings into a first-class
 comedy.
 RAE:[O FREE ASIA
 (Mr. ROONEY of Pennsylvania asked
 and was given. permission to address the
 House for 1 minute and to revise and ex-
 tend his remarks.)
 Mr. ROONEY of Pennsylvania.  Mr.
 Speaker, I have this morning sent a let-
 ter  to  Mr.  Crawford H.           Greenewalt,
 chairman of the board of directors of
 Radio Free Europe, urging that his orga-
 nization investigate the feasibility of es-
 tablishing a Radio Free Asia in an effort
 to counteract the relentless barrage of
 hate  propaganda  now  being  dissemi-
 nated            by   the          Communist   Chinese
 throughout southeast Asia.
 My admiration and respect for Radio
 Free Europe is boundless. It has been,
 and continues to be, one of the most ef-
 fective private means of disseminating
 truth to the captive nations of Eastern
 Europe ever devised in modern society.
 It is my hope that a similar effort can
 and will be made in the strife-ridden
 areas of Asia.
 With your permission I should like to
 read the text of my letter to Mr. Greene-
 1walt and urge my distinguished col-
 leagues to associate themselves with it if
 they share my belief that a Radio Free
 Asia can be an important ally in our
 struggle for the minds of Asia's peoples:
 DEAR Ma. GRSENEWALT: It is imperative that
 our Nation, through its private citizens as
 well as through its Government, do every-
 thing possible to offset the fantastic volume
 of vicious propaganda now being drummed
 into the minds of the Asian peoples i?y the
 Red Chinese.
 Since World War II, few organization::: have
 done a more effective job of presenting the
 truth to captive nations and their people
 than Radio Free :Europe.  Most of the time
 the only access the peoples of Eastern Europe
 have to the truth. is through our own Gov-
 ernment's agency? the Voice of America and
 through Radio Free Europe.
 It becomes increasingly apparent, in these
 perilous times In Asia, that there is a grave
 and pressing need for an operation similar to
 Radio Free Europe in this part of the world.
 Communist propagandists are expending mil-
 lions of dollars and thousands of hours of air
 time  in  an  unceasing  barrage  of  hatred
 against America and the free world.
 We must counteract this relentless cam-
 paign through every effective channel avail-
 able to us as a free country.
 I therefore strongly urge that you and the
 members of the board of your organisation
 give serious consideration to the formation
 of a Radio Free Asia.  Such action, I an). con-
 vinced, will assist the official agencies of our
 own Government and those of other free na-
 iions in. this world in their effort to was the
 minds of millions away from the seductive
 and totalitarian influence of Red China.
 The bulk of the world's population lives
 in this troubled and terror-stricken region.
 '['here is no doubt, whatever, that the Chinese
 Communist regime recognizes the pivot:ei role
 the commitment of these millions of human
 heigns  will play in their quest for world
 domination.
 Our American Government and its people
 stand firmly against the encroachment of
 communism  in  southeast Asia.   We  have
 made our stand known through economic
 assistance and through the commitment of
 iron and arms to aid South Vietnam in its
 heroic  fight  against  aggression from the
 North.
 We must sees to win the propaganda war
 is well.  And in that war there is no greater
 weapon than truth.
 The American people should be given the
 opportunity to enlist in that struggle through
 voluntary,  nonprofit,  nongovernmental
 agency in addition to all the official effort
 new being made.  Radio Free Asia can be-
 come a reality.                                                                         I pray that you, the miembers
 of your board and the expert advisers you
 have working with you may be able to make
 It so.
 "LOVE-INS"
 (Mr. GROSS asked and was giver. per-
 mission to address the House for i min-
 ute  and  to  revise  and  extend  his
 remarks.)
 Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, according
 to U.S. News & World Report of Feb-
 ruary 28, 1968, the Board of Supervisors
 of Los Angeles County has ordered an
 inquiry into what one of the supervisors
 terms "love-ins," permitted under the
 welfare progam :in Los Angeles.
 At issue is a rule which permits aid to
 a family with dependent children, even
 though the elan. who lives in the house
 is neither married to the mother nor is
 the father of the children.
 Said Supervisor Frank G. Bonelli:
 We have had sit-ins and lie-ins, and now
 we have love-ins.  This places a stigma and
 Indictment  upon   supervisors  unless  we
 actively challenge this phase of the welfare
 program.
 Taxpayers must not be forced to subsidize
 any welfare program that has the inherent
 danger  of  promoting  illegitimacy, to say
 nothing about apparent outright Immorality.
 RESOLUTION TO BAR DISCRIMINA-
 TION AGAINST U.S. EMPLOYEES
 (Mr.  SCHWEIKER  asked        and     was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute and to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. SCHWEIKER.   Mr. Speaker, I am
 today introducing a concurrent resolu-
 tion calling for an end to discrimination
 in the assignment of U.S. employees to
 overseas posts.
 The administration has been practic-
 ing religious discrimination in its as-
 signment of employees abroad, thereby
 preventing assignment of qualified Jew-
 ish employees to U.S. posts in Arab-bloc
 countries.
 The resolution which 1 am introduc-
 ing today expresses the sense of the
 Congress that the President should take
 such steps as may be necessary to as-
 sure that the assignment of U.S. em-
 ployees  in the United States  and at
 posts abroad shall be made without re-
 gard to race, religion, color, or national
 origin.
 By its demonstrated willingness to go
 along with the anti-Semitism practiced
 by these Arab.-bloc countries when, as-
 signing U.S. personnel abroad, the ad-
 ministration  is  guilty  of  following  a
 double  standard,  properly outlawing
 discrimination by private employers at
 home, but improperly discriminating in
 assigning its own employees abroad.
 Mr. Speaker, I would welcome the sup-
 port of my colleagues on both sides of
 the aisle for this important measure.
 A TRIBUTE  TO  THE  U.S.  COAST

 (Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and was

 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. Mr. Speaker, 25

 Coast Guard Reserve.
 From my personal experience and long

 Committee, I can state with a great deal
 of conviction that its members, whatever
 their individual backgrounds may be. re-
 flect one thing in common-devotion,
 extreme pride, and an intense feeling of
 national responsibility.
 Prior to the outbreak of World War II,
 the Coast Guard had no organized re-

 less than 20,000 officers and men.  With

 If  communications between Washington

 IMPORTANCE OF THE OFFICE OF
 VICE PRESIDENT
 (Mr. GRAY asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr.  GRAY.  Mr.  Speaker,  the  im-
 portance of the office of the Vice Presi-
 dent has been increasing steadily over
 the past several years.  At the present
 time, the United States does not own or
 maintain a permanent residence for the
 Vice President.  Such a residence is
 badly needed.  The Vice President is
 called upon to entertain diplomats, vari-
 ous officials from' this country  and
 abroad very frequently.
 Accordingly, I have introduced today,
 a bill authorizing the General Services
 Administration to plan, design, and con-
 struct an official residence for the Vice
 President of I the United States on a
 10-acre site at the U.S. Naval Observ-
 atory on Massachusetts Avenue NW.
 We propose a three-story brick and
 stone   structure,   three-car   garage,
 grounds to be properly landscaped and
 fenced.  The bill calls for a maximum of
 $750,000, including the furnishings.
 The Senate passed a bill last year pro-
 viding for an authorization of $1 million.
 Public hearings have been scheduled
 for 10 a.m., on Thursday, February 24 in
 the Full Public Works Committee Hear-
 ing Room 2167, the Rayburn Building.
 Congressman  GEORGE  FALLON,  Full
 Committee Chairman on Public Works
 and I, invite all interested colleagues or
 their constituents to appear before the
 committee or submit a written state-
 ment concerning this important matter.
 We also welcome cosponsorship of the
 bill.
 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE GAM-
 BIA ON ITS INDEPENDENCE DAY
 ANNIVERSARY
 (Mr. MATSUNAGA asked and was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute and to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. Speaker, The
 Gambia, which achieved independence
 on February 18, 1965, as a constitutional
 monarchy within the British Common-
 wealth, has just completed its first year
 of independence.
 My warmest congratulations are ex-
 tended to Prime Minister Dawda Kairaba
 Jawara and the people of this young but
 important member of the family of Afri-
 can independent nations.
 The estimated 325,000 population of
 The Gambia live on a stretch of land,
 from 7 to 20 miles wide, that extends
 from the west coast of Africa to a point
 200 miles inland.  The country's econ-
 omy is almost entirely agricultural, with

 LINCOLN, OF SPRINGFIELD
 (Mr. FINDLEY (at the request of Mr.
 HUTCHINSON) was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.),
 Mr. FINDLEY.  Mr. Speaker, on Feb-
 ruary 12, the 157th anniversary of the
 birth of Abraham Lincoln, the Governor
 of Pennsylvania, the Honorable William
 W. Scranton, spoke at a dinner in
 Springfield, Ill., sponsored by the Abra-
 ham Lincoln Association.
 It was my privilege to hear this ex-
 cellent address.  I was struck by the
 parallel drawn by the speaker between
 present-day national circumstances and
 those. that prevailed during the period
 when Lincoln was a citizen of Spring-
 field.  In my view, the speech points the
 way of opportunity for the Republican
 Party, and for our country.
 Here is the text:
 I do not possess profound scholarly knowl-
 edge of the life of Abraham Lincoln, but,
 as apparently with you, the example of his
 life among all Americans has always held
 first place for me.  In one critical moment
 of my own life, I found myself asking, "What
 would Lincoln have done?"  And Lincoln's
 answer led me to the right decision.
 Lincoln's life is probably more familiar to
 the average person than that of any other
 American-more familiar even than those of
 Washington or Jefferson.
 We know of him as a young man in the
 small village of New Salem.  The tales of the
 early life of Abe Lincoln,- the railsplitter,
 still inspire and entertain each succeeding
 generation of Americans.
 And we know him of course for his un-
 matched accomplishments in the Presidency
 from 1861 to 1865-the Saviour ofthe Union,
 the Great Emancipator, the first successful
 national leader and virtual founder of the
 Republican Party.
 But it is about neither of these Lincolns
 that I will talk tonight-neither the New
 Salem Lincoln, the struggling and humorous
 youth; nor the Civil War Lincoln, the leader
 who "belongs to the ages."
 Rather it is about the Lincoln who dwelt
 in this very city of Springfield from the time
 that he began a law practice in 1837 until
 he left for Washington in February of 1861-
 a period of almost 25 years.
 These were the prime years of Lincoln's
 own  life.   During  this  time  he  married,
 raised  children,  bought  a  home,  entered
 politics as a Whig-formed the views and
 confirmed the character to which he later
 was to give such magnificent expression.
 They are the least well-known years of
 Lincoln's career.  Nevertheless, they should
 have particular interest and significance for
 us today.
 It was in many ways a time very like
 our own.
 During most of this period, the Nation was
 governed by a Democratic combination bent
 on achieving consensus that offered some-
 thing to everybody-something to farmers,
 something to bankers, something to south-
 ern  slaveowners,  something  to                                                                                                                                  northern
 factory hands-and something, of course, to
 the politicians  themselves. The  minority
 party, the Whigs, were chiefly negative in
 outlook and captured the Presidency only
 when led by a military hero. An extremist
 group broke and for a time seemed about to
 take over the minority party.  Discrimina-
 tion was debated as a great national issue.
 The country became involved in an interna-
 tional war which was severely criticized by
 many of the leading intellectuals of the day.
 And  while  all  this  was  happening, un-
 precedented economic growth and expansion
 were taking place.
 All of these factors find echoes in our own
 time.
 At first glance, there does seem to be one
 major difference between the two periods.
 During the era that culminated in the Civil
 War, the great moral issue of slavery infected
 and colored and finally overwhelmed every
 other  subject  of  political  debate.  Look
 where you will at the issues of the time-
 national expansion, monetary policy, States
 rights, the tariff, even  construction  of  a
 transcontinental railroad.  In the end each
 of them comes down to one question: What
 effect will it have on slavery?
 Slavery was indeed the irrepressible issue.
 Beside it, all other questions sank into at
 least momentary inconsequence.
 There is nothing quite like it today.  And
 yet there is a moral issue that today con-
 fronts every one of us and pervades the en-
 time political and intellectual firmament.
 That is the question of peace or war.  We
 can no longer define war simply as a more
 forceful extension of diplomacy.  Either war
 is going to cease or the human race will.
 It is the issue that comes back to us, either
 in a whisper or a roar, from every discussion
 of politics or economics or culture or indeed
 existence itself.
 So even in this respect our own time is not
 so very different from those critical decades
 of the forties and, the fifties in which Abra-
 ham Lincoln passed most of his mature years.
 Consider some of the problems of political
 principle and national morality with which
 Lincoln dealt in those years.
 This is of interest for what they tell us of
 Lincoln, the man.  Of interest, too, for what
 they tell us of ourselves, and of the problems
 that now confront us.
 There was first of all the issue of the
 Mexican War.
 President Polk and his administration de-
 fended the invasion of Mexican territory, on
 the ground of national interest-then known
 as manifest destiny.  Our presence in Mexico,
 they claimed, was dictated by our national
 interest.  To leave would be to imperil our
 strategic position in the Western Hemisphere.
 Most of the intellectuals of the day left
 little doubt as to what they thought of that
 argument.  Henry  David  Thoreau,  in  his
 customary outspoken way, declared.    "The
 people must cease to make war on Mexico,
 though it cost them their existence as a
 people."  If. Thoreau had been living today,
 he probably would have burned his draft
 card.  As it was, he simply refused to pay
 taxes.
 Lincoln did not support this position.  As
 a Whig Member of Congress, he questioned

 the wisdom and even the constitutionality
 of the war.  But once it had begun, he sup-,
 ported its vigorous prosecution.
 He  did  not,  however, believe  that the
 minority party in time of war should abdi-?
 cate its responsibility to criticize.
 Again and again, he questioned the as-.
 surnpt.ions on which the war was being car-
 ried on.                      He rejected the doctrine of na-
 tional interest, at least: in its simple form.
 He insisted that the Nation's aims be de-
 Fined in moral as well as in military terms.
 During his own Presidency, Lincoln said
 it was not so important that God be on our
 side, as that we be on God's side.  This con..
 viction found its roots in his observation of
 the confused maneuvering of the Polk ad-?
 ministration during the Mexican War.
 Second, there was the issue of extremism
 on Lincoln's own side of the political spec-
 trum.
 The Whig Party never really got off the
 ground as an instrument of government in
 the United States.  Although it elected two
 Presidents, it never captured the imagina-
 tion of the American people and was unable
 to achieve a record off stable continuity in
 office.
 By the 1850's, it was evident that some..
 thing new  was needed.  The people were
 crying out for change, and the Whigs were
 unable to offer attractive or exciting change.
 For it few years, it seemed that know-noth-
 ingism might provide the answer.
 The know-nothings were formed as a re-
 sponse to the growing tide of immigration
 from  non-Anglo-Saxon  countries  to  the
 United  States.  They  had  a  very simple
 creed: If you are not like us in race and
 religion and national origin, we don't want
 you here.
 They fed on fear-the fear of those who
 had achieved some measure of security to-
 ward those who were still struggling upward
 from the bottom of the ladder.  They of-
 (erect  deceptively simple  and brutal solu-
 tions, to difficult social and economic prob-
 lems.
 They were, as we would now say, extrem-
 lets.
 Know-nothingism was a particularly dif-
 ficult problem for Lincoln.  He found many
 of his closest friends and political allies in
 the   know-nothing  movement.   When  he
 ran for the State legislature in 1854, he was
 offered the know-nothing endorsement. At
 first he hesitated to make his views known.
 tint he could not hesitate long.  He was,
 after all, Lincoln.
 The  know-nothing  party,  he  said,  was
 "wrong in principle."
 He wrote to his friend, Josh Speed:
 "I am not a know-nothing; that is certain,
 flow could I be? How can anyone who ab-?
 hors the oppression of Negroes be in favor
 of degrading classes of white people? * * *
 When it comes to this, I shall prefer emi-?
 grating to some country where they make
 no pretense of loving liberty-to Russia, for
 instance, where despotism can be taken pure,
 and without the base alloy of hypocrisy."
 Lincoln dealt forthrightly with extremism.
 He said that it had no legitimate connection
 with  true  conservatism.  He  warned that
 conservatives who lent it a sympathetic ear
 would do ultimate damage to their cause.
 Lincoln was proven right.     Within a few
 years, the  lever  of know-nothingism  had
 passed. If it had not been stubbornly op-?
 posed by men like Lincoln, the birth of the
 new if publican Party might have been long;
 delayed or might never have taken place.
 Slavery  would have dug itself  ever  more
 deeply into the national fabric. Conserva-.
 tism would have been discredited, and would
 have been unable to play its necessary role
 in the development of our country.
 The  final  great  national  problem with,
 which Lincoln had to deal during his Spring-
 field yearn was the formation of a new politi-
 cal combination to take the place of the
 Democrats as the governing party.
 The Democratic Party was wrecked by the
 issue of slavery.  Constructed on the twin
 pillars of patronage and compromise, it failed
 to evade the moral issue.
 Slavery would have to go, or the Nation
 would be torn asunder.  The Democrats were
 unable  to  accept  either  alternative,  and
 therefore collapsed.
 The question remained: Who would take
 their place?
 During the long period of Democratic su-
 premacy, the minority party had Iwo great
 leaders:  Daniel Webster, of Massachusetts,
 and Henry Clay, of Kentucky.
 Both had an overpowering itch r.e become
 President, but neither ever made it.  Both
 made many valuable contributions to our na-
 tional development, but neither provided a
 satisfactory  response  to  the fundamental
 moral issue of the time.
 These two great leaders held different views
 on haw the minority party should be con-
 verted into a stable governing combination.
 Webster believed that his party should ad-
 here to the business interest, and that it
 would eventually come to power a:. surely as
 day follows night.  He is reputed to have
 said: "Let Congress take care of the rich, and
 the rich will take care of the poor."
 The United States, he reasoned  was in-
 evitably becoming a business civilization, and
 the party of business was sure to be the gov-
 erning party within a very short time.
 Henry Clay did not share his colleague's
 certainty on this point.  Clay believed in the
 art of political maneuver.
 "All.  legislation,  all  government:,  all  so-
 ciety," he declared, "are founded upon the
 principle of mutual concession."  In short:
 If you want to get along, go along.
 Lincoln, although he admired both of the
 old Whig leaders, particularly Cla v, in the
 end could agree with neither.
 To Webster's contention that the conserva-
 tive party should rest its cause on the busi-
 ness interest, Lincoln replied, "Republicans
 are for both the man and the dollar, but in
 case of conflict the man before the dollar."
 Clay's argument he found more compelling.
 Henry Clay had been Lincoln's parti ular hero
 since the time of his first entrance into poli-
 tics.  Lincoln himself had spent hit: share of
 time in the political back rooms, and he knew
 that it man who is unwilling at the proper
 time to compromise is unable to govern.
 But Lincoln did not believe that compro-
 mise alone could be made the b::sis for a
 political party.
 In 1.859, Lincoln said, "If we shall adopt a
 platform that fails to recognize or express
 our purpose * * * we not only take nothing
 by our success, but we tacitly admit that we
 act upon no other principle than a desire to
 have 'the loaves and fishes.' "
 Lincoln knew that no successfu' political
 leader can afford to neglect "the loaves and
 fishes."  In a democracy, they supply the in-
 dispensable  motivation  to  command  the
 loyalty of the party shock. troops on election
 day.  At the same time he knew that a party
 that relies on, tangible rewards alone may
 win an election or two, but it will never win
 a generation.
 With Emerson, Lincoln saw that the con-
 servative party of his time "contained the
 best men."  But with Emerson, too, he real-
 ized that the conservative party could never
 become the governing party so long as it was
 merely defensive, merely negative, untrans-
 formed by any overriding spirit of idealism.
 It was just this act of transformation which
 Lincoln achieved within the new Republican
 Party.
 For the first time since the days of the
 Founding Fathers, it was the conservative
 party that looked confidently toward the fu-
 ture.   It was the conservative party that
 spoke up for the rights of man.  It was the
 conservative party that offered land to the
 dispossessed, liberty to those who were in
 chains, and the prospect of economic ful-
 fillment to all.
 The result of course is history.   A new
 political party came to power and. for the
 next 70 years remained the principal insti u-
 ment of government in the United States.
 It is entirely in the spirit of Lincoln that
 I conclude tonight with the suggestion that
 once again our country is in need of such
 an act of transformation.
 The party that Lincoln helped to create is.
 now as then, the only available substitute Jor
 the current majority party.
 I cannot, in all candor, tell you that an act
 of transformation  has as yet  taken photo
 within the Republican Party.
 But I believe that it will.
 It will because it must.
 The problems are too grave-the issues ton
 serious-the   prospect   too   glorious- Jar
 merely partisan maneuvering in 1966.
 The minority will become the majority
 when it has seized the spirit of idealism that
 is latent within our people-when it has di-
 vested itself of any association with extrem-
 ism-when it has offered real solutions to
 the real problems of our country.
 I am a Republican-and I believe that is
 going to happen.
 But more than that I am an American
 and I believe that it has got to happen
 And  if  it  does  not,  we  will  not  have
 America.
 WHO WILL HE SACRIFICE?
 (Mr. GURNEY (at the request of Air.
 HUTCHINSON) was granted permission. to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous 1110,t-
 ter.)
 Mr. GURNEY.  Mr. Speaker, the re
 cent administration announcement that
 $190.6 million would be cut from the aid
 to schools in federally impacted areas is
 a severe blow to education.  The Presi-
 dent tells us in one breath that he will
 spread our high standards of education
 to the world by the new worldwide sear
 on poverty.  Then with the next breath
 he says that he will cut a vitally ho -
 portant  educational program  here  at
 home in half.
 There was concern expressed for cc4 ;--
 cational excellence in the state of the
 Union message, and grand new pro-, rarnri
 promised.  But actions speak louder than
 all the speeches and the ringing;- phrase::.
 I recall one phrase vividly-the Presi-
 dent asked of those of us who believe
 in fiscal responsibility "Who v! ill they
 sacrifice?"
 I think it, has become very clear who
 the President will sacrifice.  He is askin?g
 us to sacrifice the schoolchildren who
 seek a good education to prepare them
 for a complex world.  He is aski; g u^ to
 sacrifice education standards of the ma'T,v
 towns and counties of this Nation where
 Federal installations have brought in a
 great influx of workers and their faru-
 ilies.  These people work, and often Eve,
 on tax-exernpt land, for which the local
 government receives none of the taxes;
 that other citizens must pay.
 The Federal Government has a clear
 and well-established responsibility here
 for they are the cause of both the in-
 crease in schoolchildren and the loss of
 tax sources.

 Our colleague, the gentleman from
 Georgia [Mr. MACKAY], a member of the
 Committee on Interstate and Foreign
 Commerce, has gone into this problem
 very thoroughly and has proposed legis-
 lation to establish a National Traffic
 Safety Agency to provide national lead-
 ership to reduce traffic accident losses.
 I am introducing a similar bill.
 The National Traffic Safety Agency,
 which would be headed by an Adminis-
 trator comparable to the Federal Avia-

 lowing :
 Establish a National Safety Research
 and Testing Center.
 Provide leadership to achieve a more
 uniform traffic environment, including
 more uniform rules of the road, more
 adequate standards of safety in the man-
 ufacture of new vehicles and inspection
 of vehicles in use, better definition of
 fitness to drive, and a more uniform
 physical driving environment.
 The proposed new agency should not
 seek to supplant existing public and pri-
 vate agencies, but it should provide ag-
 gressive leadership to achieve a concert
 of action.
 It is my hope that the legislation will
 be enacted promptly so we can begin a
 real effort to reduce wanton destruction
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 a previous order of the House, the gen-
 tleman from Alabama [Mr. SELDEN] is
 recognized for 1 hour.
 (Mr. SELDEN asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks and include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. SELDEN.  Mn Speaker, the Na-
 tion in recent weeks has watched with
 great interest and concern the hearings
 conducted by the Senate Committee on
 Foreign Relations in regard to our policy
 in southeast Asia.
 Last week both Secretary of State
 Dean Rusk and Gen. Maxwell Taylor
 presented excellent arguments for a
 policy of firmness in dealing with the
 threat of communism in Vietnam.  In
 view of the persistent carping of foreign
 policy soft liners, who would have this
 country retreat in the face of Communist
 aggression, it was most refreshing to
 hear the statements of experienced and
 knowledgeable spokesmen such as Sec-
 retary Rusk and General Taylor.
 With regard to the recent Senate
 Foreign Relations hearings, I read with
 interest the accounts of testimony given
 to the committee by Mr. George Kennan.
 Mr. Kennan seems to argue that the U.S.
 commitment to South Vietnam has as-
 sumed exaggerated proportions and that
 this country should therefore limit or
 curb our efforts there.
 Mr. Kennan, as we know, is credited as
 the creator of the original policy of con-
 tainment which this country followed in
 its dealings with Soviet communism in
 Europe during the period immediately
 following World War II.  Now it would
 appear that Mr. Kennan has evolved a
 latter-day policy of containment regard-
 ing the U.S. commitment to defend
 southeast Asia from the threat of aggres-
 sive communism.  But, unlike his first
 containment policy, the general thrust of
 his current advice is that in 1966 we
 should contain our own efforts in meet-
 ing Communist expansionism in south-
 east Asia.
 Needless to say, Mr. Kennan's remarks
 received wide attention in the press and
 on television.  It is unfortunate that the
 American public has not been given as
 great exposure to the facts, circum-
 stances, and results of a meeting held in
 Havana last month-the so-called Tri-
 Continent Conference-which spelled out
 the future course of Communist aggres-
 sion in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
 The  recommendations  and  policy
 statements coming out of this Havana
 Conference represents a veritable "Mein
 Kampf" of international Communist de-
 signs and aims throughout the world in
 the 1960's and 1970's.  And although the
 Soviet Union was represented by a 40-
 member delegation, it is well to note that
 the chief result of the January Havana
 Conference was to implement and foster
 the Chinese Communist thesis for event-
 ual Communist seizure of power in coun-
 tries alined to the free world.
 Critics of present U.S. policy in South
 Vietnam, such as Mr. Kennan, make
 much of the ideological split between the
 Soviet Union and China.  It is, in fact,
 currently fashionable in some U.S. for-
 eign policy circles to accuse those of us
 who speak of the threat of communism
 as being simplistic in our approach.  We
 are told that we should differentiate be-
 tween the so-called various forms of
 communism-whether we refer to Soviet
 or Chinese or even North Vietnamese
 communism.
 Yet the unanimity which the delegates
 of the Havana Tri-Continent Conference
 demonstrated on the matter of waging
 Chinese-style wars of liberation through-
 out the world points up the futility-if
 not the real danger-of this polemic
 fragmentizing of communism in the
 world today.
 It may be true that communism is no
 longer monolithic as it was in the im-
 mediate post-World War II era. But the
 threat of Communist expansion-and
 the Communist design for subversion
 and domination of countries of the free
 world-is monolithic and universal in
 every Communist capital.
 Thus it was that the basic theme of
 the so-called Tri-Continent Conference
 in Havana-a theme repeated by Soviet
 and  Chinese  Communist  spokesmen
 alike-was a strident call for war on all
 fronts against the free world.
 As the Soviet delegate to the Confer-
 ence, Sharif P. Rashidor, stated:
 We are participating in a major event in
 the history of the national-liberation strug-
 gle of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin
 America.  The anti-imperialist struggle, with
 its demands for the unshakable unity of its
 fighting forces, has brought the peoples of
 our continents to a realization of the urgent
 necessity for an even greater consolidation,
 and an even greater coordination, of our
 struggle against our common enemy-im-
 perialism  and,  first  and  foremost,  U.S.
 imperialism.
 The Soviet delegation. earnestly appeals to
 all the  national organizations  and their
 movements represented at this Conference
 to unite in the struggle for this great goal.
 Let our Conference be a new stage on this
 road.  Let it multiply and strengthen the
 unity of our ranks, and impart new force to
 the liberation struggle throughout the world.
 The resolutions approved by the Con-
 ference are in the same aggressive and
 militaristic vein.  They call for an in-
 tensified campaign of subversion and po-
 litical warfare against democratic re-
 gimes of the free world.
 But the larger significance of the Tri-
 Continent Conference in Havana does
 not lie in the unified pronouncement of
 revolutionary aims among Communist
 nations.  For only a fatuous self-delu-
 sion has ever persuaded the soft-line
 Kremlinologists of the free world that
 the Soviets and the Chinese alike seek
 Communist world domination, and by
 violent revolutionary means.  They are
 as one, differing only on tactics, and
 timetable, and those who doubt this fact
 should be furnished the record of the
 Havana Conference as required reading.
 No, the truly alarming significance of
 the  Havana Conference  last  month
 stems from the scope and nature of par-
 ticipation by nations of Asia, Africa, and
 Latin America-many of which, while
 purporting to be "neutralist" as between
 Communist and the free world, in fact
 are providing political and other support
 to the revolutionary and subversive aims
 of Communist bloc nations.
 Indeed, all the speeches, resolutions,
 and actions of the delegates of the 82
 nations represented at the Conference
 were geared to the propaganda needs and
 aims of agressive international commu-
 nism.                                                                                                      In fact, the Tri-Continent Con-
 ference went much further than any
 similar meeting in recent years in spell-
 ing out the aggressive designs of world
 Communist leadership toward nations of
 the free world.
 As chairman of the House Subcommit-
 tee on Inter-American Affairs I am es-
 pecially concerned with the serious im-
 plications of the Conference as regards
 our vital national interests and commit-
 ments to the defense of the hemisphere.
 The Organization of American States
 expressed its alarm regarding the Ha-
 vana Conference in a resolution of con-
 demnation, approved February 2, 18-0,
 with Mexico and Chile abstaining.
 The  OAS  resolution  reflects  hemi-
 spheric concern regarding the possibil-
 ity of new attempts of Communist take-
 overs in a number of countries, including
 Venezuela, Guatemala, Colombia, and
 Uruguay.  And the Tri-Continent Con-
 ference itself serves to reemphasize the
 appropriateness of House Resolution 560,
 which only last year expressed the sense
 of the House regarding the need for firm
 U.S. policy to meet the threat of Com-
 munist intervention in the Western
 Hemisphere. In the light of last month's
 meeting in Havana, that resolution is
 even more pertinent today than when it
 was passed by an overwhelming majority
 of the House in September 1965.
 So-called neutral, unalined countries,
 with delegates participating at the Ha-
 vana meeting, would do well to ponder

 '1he book of clippings wort a reversal and
 freedom for Dr. Sam last year, but the re-
 ersal was itself reversed by the U.S. Court
 ,if Appeals in Ohio when it said: "Our jury
 ,ystem cannot survive if it is now proper to
 presume that jurors selected with the care
 i.aken in this case, are without intelligence,
 courage,  and  integrity  necessary  to  their
 ,bedience to the law's command that they
 ignore the kind of publicity here involved."
 Four Supreme Court Judges believe that a
 constitutional question is involved--and this
 may  intensify  the press-bar conflict    par-
 ticularly if it disturbs the status quo on
 contempt.
 'I'ho landmark cases protecting both in-
 dividual  and  press.  from punishment                         for
 contempt, have thus far concerned prejudic-
 ial publication as it, concerned judges only.
 The Pennekamp, Bridges, Los Angeles Times-
 Mrrror cases fir id others brought about the
 "clear and present danger" concept--that a
 constructive contempt, away from the imme-
 d.iate presence of the court, would not be
 punished unless it could be shown that a
 clear and present danger existed to the ad-
 ministration of justice.  The theory is that
 udges would not be so endangered because,
 Forsooth, they are judges.
 Yet,  judges  hive  been  throwing  news-
 papermen in jail for generations.
 Ralph Conley is a 53-year-old reporter for
 the Wheeling, W. Va., Intelligencer. He is a
 Ill-year veteran with that paper, and a 25-
 .,ear senior in newspaper work.  He was as-
 zdgoed to cover the New Martinsville area.
 On Saturday, January 15 of this year he
 wrote a story listing five civil actions which
 ho.d been set for trial on Tuesday, January
 13 in the Wetzel County Circuit Court by
 Judge  Lloyd  Arnold.   After  listing  them
 he wrote this:
 Probably  the  most interesting  case is
 that of Mrs. Fr;uiccs Ripley versus the city
 P laden City.
 "Mrs. Ripley, a resident of Paden City, and
 wife of Leo Ripley, fell into an open side-
 walk grating on January 22, 1965, and seeks
 recovery of damages for $24,000.
 In her petition, she claims permanent in-
 jury and that the fall resulted in a com-
 pound fracture of her left leg, and other
 injuries.
 "The city carries a $100,000 liability in-
 :;urance policy and the city council acknowl-
 ^dged fault and recommended in a letter
 to the insurance carrier that the claim be
 paid.   However, no payment has been re-
 ceived and the suit followed.
 "Attorney  Jack.  Hawkins  represents  the
 plaintiff,  and Hassig & Sndyer are attor-
 neys for the defendant."
 On Monday, January 17 Judge Arnold sent
 an. officer to ask Conley to come to his office.
 At. the conclusion of the interview and after
 Conley left, the judge prepared a rule of
 contempt directed to Conley.  It was served
 on. Conley that morning.
 A courtroom hearing before Judge Arnold
 was scheduled at 2 p.m. the same day.
 Judge Arnold concluded the hearing by
 finding that publication of the news story
 obstructed and impeded the operation of his
 court and that accordingly Conley was In
 contempt.   The judge sentenced him to 5
 days in jail, fined him $10 and ordered the
 sheriff to place him in jail immediately.
 Attorneys for  Conley  appeared  before
 Judge Arnold the next morning and orally
 moved that the judgment of contempt be set
 aside, that a new hearing be awarded, and
 that Conley be discharged from jail. Argu-
 ments on these motions were heard at 1
 p.m. Tuesday.  The attorneys submitted four
 grounds for the motion, including the first
 amendment, and the judge overruled the mo-
 lions.    Thereon the attorneys for Conley
 moved for a stay of the proceedings in order
 that they might appeal the judge's dec':sion
 to the Supreme Court of Appeals.  The judge
 granted a 60-day stay, setting bond in the
 amount of' $50.   Conley was subsequently
 released after 24 hours in jail, and went back
 to work.
 The case is pending.
 The city council action was a matter of
 record.
 'hen there was the 1964 case of Will l3ar-
 rison, a 50-year-old columnist for the New
 Me rican,  :14,000  circulation,  published  at
 Santa Fe.  He presumed to make an adverse
 coraparisorr of two drunk driving cases before
 a Santa Fe judge.
 In one case, a Mexican-American boy filled
 up on wine, had an. auto accident and killed
 -three  persons.   He was sentenced to the
 penitentiary for 1 to 5 years.
 In  the  other case,  a  former  assi::tant
 district attorney wiped out a family of five
 while driving under the influence, but was
 given a $500 fine, the fine was suspended and
 the judge :announced that at the end of the
 year he would pronounce further sentence.
 Will Harrison cried "outrage" and was con-
 victed for contempt of court on the grounds
 that the lawyer defendant was :;till on proba-
 tion, thus the case was still before the court.
 Will Harrison died a couple of months ago,
 and he was, in my opinion, an unsung hero.
 Ho had been vindicated by the State Supreme
 Court October 4, 1965, on the grounds that
 no clear and present danger to the achnm-
 istration of justice had been shown.
 But  when  you  study  constructive  con-
 te:mpt, think about this one: In December,
 1965, in Montgomery, Ala.,  three Ku Klu
 Kinsmen were convicted of criminal con-
 spiracy changes in the death of a civil rights
 worker.   She was   Viola Liuzzo,  a Detroit
 housewife.
 '1.'he judge held the jury in deliberation for
 11 hours over the protest of the defense at-
 torney, and the defense attorney announced
 that an appeal would be filed and bond for
 three men was set at $10,000 cash.
 Whereupon the President of the United
 States  said:  "The whole Nation can take
 heart from. the fact that there are those in
 the South who believe in justice in racial
 matters and were determined not to stand
 for acts of violence."
 Many of us joined him in cheering that
 verdict in a great national example of ron-
 st:ructive contempt of court for commenting
 on a case still in the process of adjudication.
 Where was the voice of the bar when that
 transpired?
 And where was the self--restraint of the
 press?
 Both were lacking, and both must be sup-
 plied before we know whether we should
 be talking about fair trial and free press or
 fair trial versus free press.
 Wiggins  said  It  in  1964:  "Newspapers,
 judges, and lawyers alike ought to try to im-
 prove the reporting of criminal trials.                                                                                                                               What
 Is needed is more and better crime reporting,
 not less of it."
 Burch said it in 1955: "It is the newspa-
 per's duty to print the facts not to try them.
 That is the duty of the courts.  We want
 every defendant to have the benefit of due
 process-the whole treatment, with all the
 trimmings.  But we see too much of the un-
 due processes that help armies of dangerous
 malefactors to escape conviction, indictment,
 or even arrest."
 Vermont Royster said it in 1965: "Here the
 lesson experience, a thousand years of experi-
 ence, was that the judicial process mutt be
 open to inspection from its beginning to its
 end, to the purpose that all should lie under
 the public gaze so that if error could not he
 obviated it could at least not be hidden.  One
 instrument for this was the open court with
 the accused and the accusers openly con-
 fronted.  Another instrument was the open
 press, so that nothing could be hidden from
 the first accusation to final judgment.    The
 lesson of the common law was that the two
 were not irreconcilable, they were mutually
 dependent."
 Today it is necessary to recognize that, the
 hunt for the uninformed juror is fruitless,
 and that our reliance on the integrity of our
 peers is not misplaced.  That is the nub of
 the problem, and it will not be solved by
 speculation; rather by careful research.
 TRAFFIC SAFETY-ACTION NEEDED
 NOW
 (Mrs. BOLTON (at the request of Mr.
 HUTCHINSON)  was  granted  permission
 to extend her remarks at this point in
 the RECORD  and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mrs. BOLTON.      Mr. Speaker, the Na-
 tional Trial Lawyers Association pre-
 dicted recently that unless the Federal
 Government does something soon, deaths
 from motor vehicle accidents will reach
 100,000 a year by 1975-double the pres-
 ent auto death :rate.
 The report of this same  group of
 lawyers noted that while 605,000 Amer-
 cans have died in all wars from the Revo-
 lution to Vietnam, road deaths in the
 United States have totaled 1,500,000 in
 only 25 years.  The study revealed that
 the number of persons injured in highway
 accidents in 1964 is the same number
 as the total beds in all hospitals in the
 United   States--1,700,000.  These   corc
 shocking figures.
 I have thought for sometime that we
 should take steps at the national level
 to standardize highway signs, speettls,
 and so forth, in an effort to cut this need-
 less death, injury, and destruction on
 our  highways.  Although  the  Federal
 Government has spent millions building
 interstate highways, we have done little
 or nothing at the national level to pre-
 scribe and enforce safety standards. Sev-
 eral years ago, when we became alarmed
 at the increase in accidents involving air-
 liners, we established the Federal Avia-
 tion Agency to coordinate and improve
 safety in the air.  Now we should estab-
 lish an agency to improve safety on the

 tion.  It must be made abundantly clear,
 not only to Communist nations, but to
 others which seek to advance their own
 interest by lending themselves to Com-
 munist aims, that the United States does
 not intend to remain inactive in the face
 of any external threat to the security of
 the Americas.
 While I am reasonably certain few, if
 any, nations will admit that participants
 at the Havana meeting were official dele-
 gates of their governments, the fact that
 some of the delegates even at this mo-
 ment hold official positions in their re-
 spective governments is shocking indeed.
 For example, the Syrian delegation
 included Mohammad All Al Khatib,
 Secretary General of that country's Min-
 istry of Information.  Attending as an
 invited guest was Mohamed Fayed from
 the United Arab Republic who is Director
 of the African Affairs at the Presidency.
 African countries were well repre-
 sented by official members of their gov-
 ernments.  Tanzania sent Salim Said
 Rasuld, the Deputy Finance Minister.
 The head of Guinea's delegation was Ab-
 doulaye Diallo, Director of Political Af-
 fairs in the Foreign Ministry, and also
 included the Guinean Ambassador to the
 United  Arab  Republic,  Fade  Cisse.
 Ghana was represented by Ofory Bah-
 Emmanuel, Director of that country's
 Bureau of African Affairs; and Pauline
 American defeat, withdrawal or aban-
 donment of Vietnam would not simply,
 as some have phrased it, roll back our
 Pacific front line to Wakiki.  The roll-
 back would be to the Andes, and beyond,
 for Ho Chi Minh's battle plan in Viet-
 nam is a blueprint, approved both in
 Moscow and Peiping, for subversive wars
 of aggression in Asia, Africa, and Latin
 America.
 Once again we have been warned by
 our enemy.  The United States and the
 free world will overlook or dismiss the
 Communist "Mein Kampf," as spelled
 out at the recent Havana Tri-Continent
 Conference, at its peril and the peril of
 future generations.
 The following schedule shows in detail
 the delegates, observers, guests, and for-
 eign press from the various countries.
 The data was compiled by Cuban author-
 ities from the actual registration sheets.
 Delegates from 63 countries and 19 pro-
 tectorates, commonwealths or colonies
 were in attendance.
 List of accredited participants up to Jan. 10,
 1966, "Year of Solidarity," 1st Solidarity
 Conference of the Peoples of Africa, Asia,
 and Latin America
 Ghana.  Lakhdar Brahimi, representing
 Algeria, is that country's Ambassador to
 the United Arab Republic.
 Since many of the nations which were
 represented at the Havana Conference
 have been and are now receiving hun-
 dreds of millions of dollars of U.S. aid,
 I have written to the Secretary of State
 with the request that he determine the
 status of the delegations to the Havana
 meeting.  I also asked the Secretary to
 give consideration to the termination of
 U.S. assistance to those nations who par-
 ticipated with official or semi-official
 delegations in accordance with section
 620(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act.
 This provision of that act prohibits as-
 sistance under this or any other act, in-
 cluding sales under the Agricultural
 Trade Development and Assistance Act
 of 1954, to any countries which the Presi-
 dent determines is engaging in or pre-
 paring for aggressive military efforts di-
 rected against the United States or to
 any countries receiving assistance from
 the United States.
 The proceedings at last month's Tri-
 Continent Conference made a prima
 facie case regarding preparations for
 such aggression.
 It would seem, therefore, that a State
 Department investigation is in order to
 determine, at the very least, whether U.S.
 economic aid should not be terminated
 to certain nations which were repre-
 sented at the Havana meeting.
 Immediately following my statement,
 I am attaching a full list of delegates in
 attendance at  the  January  Havana
 meeting, as reported by the Cuban press.
 Mr. Speaker, the Tri-Continent Con-
 ference clearly established that what is
 occurring in Vietnam is not simply local-
 ized Communist aggression, but is merely
 one front in a worldwide campaign
 against the free world.

 present policy tends to blend the two to-
 gether; it confuses the Asian situation
 with the European situation in the days
 preceding Hitler's attempt to conquer
 I?,urope.
 Mr. CLARK.  I agree with the Sen-
 ator.  I wonder whether he would be
 willing to pursue this alleged analogy a
 little further, because while there is a
 certain superficial resemblance between
 the European situation at the time before
 Hitler struck, and the situation in south-
 east Asia today, my own view is that the
 analogy is fundamentally unsound, that
 we should anproach the South Vietnam-
 ese-American-Chinese situation, really,
 almost "de novo," or on an "ad hoc"
 basis, without placing much reliance on
 alleged analogies at other times and in
 other places.
 I would ask my friend this.  A good
 deal of emphasis has been placed by ad-
 ministration spokesmen on the fact that
 perhaps we are being confronted with
 another Munich and if we do not stand
 up and fight now, all of southeast Asia
 will fall and Chinese communism will
 prevail in all that part of the world.
 There is, of course, a surface similarity
 between nazism and fascism on the other
 other hand and Chinese communism on
 the other.  They are all totalitarian
 doctrines.
 I wonder if the Senator would not
 agree with me that in each instance the
 ideology is merely a cloak of idealism
 thrown over a policy of expansionist
 nationalism.
 The trouble is that we Americans, with
 our  democratic  tradition,  become  so
 mesmerized  with  opposition  to    any
 form of totalitarianism, that we are not
 astute enough to recognize, as perhaps
 we should, that what we are dealing
 with in both cases is expansionist na-
 tionalism, but expansionist nationalism
 in vastly different areas and under vastly
 different conditions.
 Mr. CHURCH.  First of all, let me say
 that I find Fascist and Communist to=
 talitarianism equally repugnant.  Sec-
 ond, with respect to the present war
 in Vietnam, I think it cannot honestly
 be maintained that this is a struggle be-
 tween the forces of tyranny on the one
 hand and the forces of freedom on the
 other.
 Mr. CLARK.  Can the Senator expand
 on that?
 Mr. CHURCH.   I mean that neither
 the government in Hanoi nor the gov-
 ernment in Saigon is in truth a free
 government. It is just possibly the rea-
 lution and recommends Chinese methods  east Asia, with the possible exception of
 to Communists in other Asian lands.    the Philippines.
 It strikes me that this is a very impor-     Mr. CHURCH.  There are free govern-
 tant distinction, Mr. President.  There                   meats in Asia today.  India, Malaysia,
 is a difference between the problem posed the Philippines, and Japan are the best
 examples.  I want  to  give  them                                                                full
 credit.  Particularly   the  Indians,  I
 think, deserve credit for tremendous de-
 termination against odds-conditions of
 great adversity-in maintaining a dem-
 ocratic                                                             government.    But  most  Asian
 and African governments are not free.
 They are not democratic governments.
 Certainly, this applies to the present re-
 gime in Saigon supported by the United
 States.
 So ][ think, if we are going to approach
 the war in Vietnam on a purely ideologi-
 cal basis, then we must be careful to
 recognize that the struggle there is pres-
 ently between two despotisms.  I hope
 the Government in Saigon will one day
 become a true democracy, that it will
 find a wider basis of popular support, and
 that it will come to foster a broadening
 freedom.  But that is not the case at the
 present time.
 If I may go to the third point the
 Senator from Pennsylvania raised, which
 was the point of expanding nationalism,
 I say again, relating the Senator's ques-
 tion to the situation in Vietnam, that the
 expanding nationalism we face there is
 not Chinese nationalism, but Vietnamese
 nationalism.  Oftentimes the Secretary
 of State has referred to the war in Viet-
 nam jcs Ho Chi Minh's war.  When he
 appeared before the Senate Foreign Re-
 lations Committee, I asked him if the
 aggression he kept referring to was not
 the aggression of North Vietnam rather
 than of China, and he admitted this was
 60.
 I think, given the history of this
 struggle, the facts are that Ho Chi Minh
 was the original revolutionary leader who
 led the Vietnamese people successfully in
 their war for independence against the
 French, and that the division between
 North and South Vietnam which emerged
 from that war at Geneva, in 1954, was
 meant to be temporary, and that the
 elections on the question of unification
 for the entire country, which were sup-
 posed to have taken place 2 years later,
 in fact never occurred.
 Mr. CLARK.  And why did they not
 occur in the south?
 Mr. CHURCH.  The regime in South
 Vietnam at that time, Diem's regime, was
 opposed  to  the elections.  President
 Eisenhower,  in his  book,  makes  the
 statement that the best opinion lie could
 marshal indicated that, had the elections
 occurred, perhaps as many as 80 percent
 of the people would have voted for Ho
 Chi Minh.
 Mr. CLARK.  So we have either active-
 ly encouraged or acquiesced in prevent-
 ing a democratic solution of the overn-
 mental problems in South Vietnam.
 Mr. CHURCH. I may say to the Sen-
 ator that there were good reasons to ques-
 tion whether an election at that time-
 in the north. as well as the south--would
 have been a free expression of popular
 opinion, but that begs the point, I think,
 because part of the Geneva Pact of 1951
 was the agreement that elections would
 be held, and. that agreement was broken.
 either side has kept the agreement, as
 the Senator well knows.  But the ques-
 tion of determining whether or not the
 line of demarcation between north and
 south would remain as a common bound-
 ary, or would remain as it was, was
 never put to the test of ballots.  So, 1.0
 years later, it is being put to the test of
 bullets.
 If there is in this situation an element
 of nationalist expansion, it is Vietnamese
 in character.  It is the attempt of Ho
 Chi  Minh,  the  original  revolutionary
 leader, to lay claim upon the whole coun-
 try, and it comes after a failure of the
 Geneva Pact    to permit the elections
 which were to settle that issue 10 years
 ago.
 Mr. CLARK. Does it not also include a
 failure on the part of the Diem govern-
 ment and its successor to go to the peo-
 ple of South Vietnam in a democratic
 way to determine what they wanted to
 do with their own destiny?
 Mr. CHURCH. I can only say the elec-
 tions were never held. The reasons giv-
 en have been several.
 The most frequently heard has been
 that no meaningful elections could have
 occurred in North Vietnam because it
 was a  closed Communist society and
 everyone would have had to vote way.
 Mr. CLARK. I agree with that state-
 ment.
 Mr. CHURCH.  I agree, too.
 But, at the time the agreement was
 entered into in Geneva, it was known
 that North Vietnam was going to ]become
 a Communist country. Nevertheless, the
 elections were agreed to.  But they were
 not held.  'Chen Ho Chi Minh began
 his effort to bring down the South Viet-
 nam regime by force.
 Mr. CLARK.  If the Senator will yield
 further, I suggest that the principal rea-
 son for not holding an election in South
 Vietnam was that Diem's government
 would have gotten licked.
 I take it from something that was said
 earlier by the Senator that we still have
 a totalitarian government in South Viet-
 nam which we are supporting, so that
 unlike the situation with Hitler and his
 aggression against the democratic na-
 tions of Western Europe, we find our-
 selves intervening on the side of one dic-
 tatorship against another dictatorship.
 Would the Senator care to comment
 on that?
 Mr. CHURCH.  In all honesty, this
 is the existing situation. We do it upon
 the grounds that the north is attempting
 to forcibly seize the south, and that we
 are committed to the Saigon regime to
 prevent the success of an aggression
 being perpetrated by Hanoi.
 I believe that there is much evidence
 to sustain the supposition that the Hanoi
 Government is in fact giving all possible
 help, encouragement, direction, and as-
 sistance to the Vietcong rebels in the

 south. I have no quarrel with that fact.
 It must be recognized. The evidence
 makes it quite irrefutable.
 The distinction that I am trying to
 draw is one between North Vietnam and
 China.  Here, it seems to me, is an ob-
 vious attempt by Ho Chi Minh to com-
 plete the revolutionary war in Vietnam,
 which began against the French, and
 which now continues against the Amer-
 icans.
 From the standpoint of Hanoi, this is
 one continuous effort to achieve Viet-
 namese independence by driving the
 Western nations out.
 We do not see our role as romotely
 corresponding to that of the French be-
 cause,           as  the  Senator  knows,  the
 French purpose was to restore French
 control over Vietnam and reestablish the
 French colony there.
 Our purpose is quite different. We
 have no interest in establishing an
 American colony in South Vietnam.
 We know that our purpose is quite
 different.
 The important question is: How does
 it appear to the Vietnamese?  After so
 long and bloody a struggle on their part
 to drive out the French, it must seem to
 many Vietnamese that this is but a
 continuation of that war, looking to the
 eventual 'establishment of Vietnamese
 independence after Western nations have
 been driven from the land.
 Mr. CLARK.  The Senator is correct.
 This situation is fundamentally different
 from the Nazi aggression in World War
 II where, I take it, the Senator would
 agree with me unquestionably that free-
 dom and democracy were at stake.
 The Western democracies, which were
 of the same philosophical bent as our-
 selves,  were fighting for their lives
 against totalitarian and nationalistic
 German aggression. We, in my opinion,
 justly, rightly, and necessarily, went to
 their assistance.
 But is that not an entirely different
 situation from the situation which con-
 fronts us in Asia today?
 Mr. CHURCH.  Yes; the struggle in
 Vietnam is essentially a civil war be-
 tween groups of Vietnamese to determine
 which government they shall have, and
 whether the division line shall remain
 in effect.  When I went to school that
 was a civil war.
 We keep asserting to the world that
 this is not a civil war in Vietnam. But,
 no matter how one divides the Viet-
 namese, north and south, Communist
 and non-Communist, they still remain
 Vietnamese. We are the only foreigners
 to have intervened, apart from the small
 numbers  of  Australians  and  New
 Zealanders, and the one combat division
 of Koreans that we have summoned
 there.
 So, to Asians this war does have a very
 different appearance.  In no case is it
 comparable to the situation that con-
 fronted us when Hitler sent his armies
 across Europe in an attempt to con-
 quer the continent.
 If the Chinese were sending their
 armies south into Vietnam, Laos, Burma,
 and Malaysia; then we would have a
 comparable situation, with the Peiping
 government  undertaking  to  conquer
 other Asian lands. That, in my opinion,
 would be a situation similar to that
 which we faced in Europe in the days of
 Hitler.
 Mr. CLARK. I would like to make one
 more distinction with respect to the al-
 leged analogy to Hitler and Munich, and
 then I will let the Senator return to his
 speech.
 There is no doubt in my mind-I won-
 der if the Senator agrees-that Hitler's
 Germany represented a military menace
 which, if not stopped, would have over-
 run not only Western Europe but also
 Great Britain and would in the end have
 posed a very real threat to both Russia
 and the United States.  It possessed a
 military machine, the efficiency of which
 probably has not been equaled since the
 days of Napoleon.
 The Senator makes the point, and it is
 a good one, that this is a war of North
 Vietnam against South Vietnam.  But
 we both know that North Vietnam is
 being enormously encouraged to main-
 la~id China.
 I ask the Senator if the administra-
 tion spokesmen who argue the Hitler-
 Mao Tse-tung analogy might not con-
 sider this distinction:
 China has no airpower.  Hitler had
 enormous airpower.  China has no sea-
 rower.  Hitler had a great fleet of sub-
 marines     and  pocket                                                      battleships  in
 the Atlantic. Hitler had enormous fire-
 power in terms of tanks and heavy ar-
 tillery and eventually in V-bombs and
 rockets.
 China has very little of that.  China is
 a primitive nuclear power, a country
 having very little heavy artillery and, so
 far as I know, an insignificant rocket
 capability.  In vast contradistinction to
 Hitler,-China's military might lies almost
 entirely in its large land army.
 Its capacity for offensive action is lim-
 ited to the perimeter of mainland China,
 although it might include North Vietnam,
 and even South Vietnam.  The with-
 drawal of Chinese troops from India
 leads me to believe that the State De-
 partment has vastly overemphasized the
 threat arising from the offensive military
 capacity of mainland China. There can
 certainly be no comparison with the ag-
 gressive military capabilities of Nazi
 Germany.
 Mr. CHURCH.  I would agree with the
 Senator from Pennsylvania that modern,
 highly industrialized Nazi Germany rep-
 resented a military threat of a different
 dimension than that presently posed by
 China.  The important thing, however,
 is to recognize that-whatever may be
 the threat of Chinese aggression in Asia
 today-we are presently engaged in a war
 that concerns the Vietnamese.  If we
 press that war far enough north toward
 the boundaries of China, a point will be
 reached-no one knows exactly where;
 but a point will be reached-a point
 where the Chinese will come down into
 Vietnam, just the way they came down
 into Korea.  Then, of course, we would
 find ourselves engaged in a war of an en-
 tirely new character.
 Mr. CLARK.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator further yield?
 Mr. CHURCH.      I stress this point be-
 cause when we fail to distinguish between
 the problem of China, on the one hand,
 and the problem of North Vietnam, on
 the other, we get ourselves into a frame
 of mind which is all too prevalent: that
 is, in the name of defending Asia against
 China, we fight against North Vietnam.
 This, of course, leads us to confusion;
 and what we need is more clarity and less
 confusion if we are to fashion a workable
 policy in Asia.
 I now yield to the Senator from
 Pennsylvania.
 Mr. CLARK.  In an effort to help to
 clarify that policy, I wonder if the Sena-
 tor from Idaho would agree with this
 observation: If we push mainland China
 to the point of coming in with her
 ground army in defense of North Viet-
 nam, and to assist the North Vietnamese
 and the Vietcong in their aggression; we
 have only two choices.  The first is to
 pour hundreds of thousands of addi-
 tional American troops into that area to
 stop that ground warfare.  The second
 is to use nuclear weapons to destroy
 China.  I ask the Senator to comment
 briefly on what he believes Russia might
 well be expected to do under those cir-
 cumstances.
 Mr. CHURCH. If that tragic sequence
 of events were to occur, the danger of a
 general nuclear holocaust would be very
 grave.
 Mr. CLARK. There is no doubt about
 what that would mean to the people of
 the United States of America.
 Mr.  CHURCH.  No,  indeed.   The
 stakes are mortal. This is the reason
 the Committee on Foreign Relations
 came out from behind closed doors to
 examine the issue of Vietnam. The
 American people are entitled to know how
 grave might be the circumstances of a
 widening war in Asia.  I believe the
 public hearings of the Committee on
 Foreign Relations have performed a vital
 service.  The American people were in-
 vited to witness our deliberations.  As a
 result, the people of the country are bet-
 ter apprised of the war in Vietnam, its
 present implications, and the possible
 consequences that might attend a widen-
 ing war in southeast Asia.
 I thank the distinguished Senator
 from Pennsylvania for emphasizing the
 differences  between  the  problem  we
 faced in the days preceding the outbreak
 of the Second World War in Europe and
 the problem we now face in Asia.    Un-
 less we understand these distinctions,
 we have no chance of fashioning a policy
 that is designed to deal with the realities
 in Asia today.
 The gulf that separates Europe from
 Asia is immense. Most of the newly inde-
 pendent Asian governments-like those
 in Africa-contend with internal up-
 heaval. Most are hard pressed to satisfy
 the demands of their suddenly unfettered
 peoples.  Most lack democratic tradi-
 tions,"and have instead "strong man" re-
 gimes  under  one-party  rule.  Their
 people wretch in poverty, and often bear
 the yoke of ancient wrongs. "Capital-
 ism," not "communism," is the ugly
 word, conjuring up images of a hated
 colonial past. Socialism prevails by force
 of circumstances, since adequate private
 capital Is unavailable.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD --- SENATE       February 21, .1966
 With these countries, the United States
 enjoys no close communion, no cultural,
 political, economic, or ethnic bond. We
 are an alien in Asia, a suspect rich
 Western power, the only one that re-
 mains after the others have fled.
 In these circumstances, it is meaning-
 less to talk about military alliances which
 have raised a "barrier" against com-
 munism around the rim of Asia.  If the
 SEATO and CENTO alliances bar com-
 munism, then a sieve bars water and
 plate-glass window bars light.  SEATO
 has not responded to the Communist
 threat in Vietnam; the United States
 takes its stand there practically alone.
 Apart from the regime we sustain in Sai-
 gon, the only military allies we can hon-
 estly claim in Asia-South Korea, Tai-
 wan, and '.i'hailand--account for less
 than 5 percent of the Asian  people.
 Rather than flaunting our meager alli-
 ances as evidence of a sound Asian policy,
 we should view them as shocking proof
 that we lack one.
 Given the grievances of most Asian
 peoples, future revolutions are inevitable.
 So, too, the Communist determination to
 Lake them over.  In Eastern Europe, the
 Red army implanted Communist re-
 gimes; in Asia Chinese troops have not
 penetrated neighboring lands to thrust
 up Communist governments.

 Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH       I yield.
 Mr.  INOUYE.   Would  the  Senator
 from Idaho describe the Chinese military
 occupation of Tibet?
 Mr.  CHURCI-I. The  occupation  of
 Tibet was the laying of forcible control
 upon an area over which the Chinese
 have long asserted dominion, and which
 most of the rest of the world has also
 acknowledged as being within traditional
 Chinese claims.
 I do not, for a moment, condone the
 methods that were used by the Peiping
 government to assert that dominion, but
 I am fully aware that Chiang Kai-shek,
 who is, as the Senator from Hawaii well
 knows, the presiding head of the Chinese
 Government recognized by the United
 States, a government presently situated
 on the island of Taiwan, also claims
 Tibet as a part of the traditional land
 area over which the Chinese have as-
 serted dominion.
 I therefore believe that Tibet falls in
 a different category than other inde-
 pendent nations which lie beyond the
 traditional boundaries of China.  I do
 not believe that Tibet can be compared,
 let us say, with Burma, Thailand, or Viet-
 nam. which are generally recognized as
 sovereign and independent nations.
 Mr. INOUYE.  Mr. President, I thank
 the Senator.
 Mr. CLARK.   Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH.  I yield.
 Mr. CLARK.   I thought the comment
 of the Senator on Tibet was a very good
 answer to an extremely intelligent ques-
 tion.  However, it was largely put on
 political and diplomatic grounds.
 I point out that, from a military point
 of view, the situation in Tibet was vastly
 different because there was no feasible
 possibility there of Indian forces or
 American forces or other forces opposed
 to the mainland Chinese Government de-
 livering a military counterpunch to drive
 the Chinese Communists out of Tibet.
 The situation existing there is very
 much like that which existed in Hungary
 in 1956.  We had great sympathy for the
 people of Tibet.  We had great sym-
 pathy for the freedom fighters of Hun-
 gary.  However, we came to the reluc-
 tant, but I believe the correct, conclu-
 sion that that was not a place in which
 one could intervene.
 Mr. CHURCH.  Mr. Presiden   As I
 have stressed, a distinction must be
 drawn between the threat of Chinese ag-
 gression, on the one hand, and the prob-
 lem of communism, fostered by revolu-
 tion, on the other.   American policy
 keeps blending the two together, presum-
 ably because the two threats were synon-
 ymous in Europe.
 This leads me to Mr. Ball's second
 point, that the Vietnamese war is not
 "an indigenous rebellion," but a case of
 "external  aggression."  The evidence
 shows clearly enough, Mr. Ball writes,
 "that the Communist regime in Hanoi
 never  intended  that  South  Vietnam
 should develop in freedom."  From the
 start, we are told, the Vietcong rebels
 have been trained, directed, and supplied
 from the north in "a cynical and .ystem-
 atic  aggression"  which                                                                  Secretary  of
 State Dean Rusk describes as "lio Chi
 Minh's War."
 While citing the evidence, Mr. Ball
 might also have mentioned-but did
 not--that the line of demarcation, sep-
 arating North and South Vietnam, as
 agreed upon at Geneva in 1954, was not
 intended as a permanent boundary, and
 that the elections on the question of uni-
 fication which were scheduled for 1956,
 never occurred.  The reason, widely ac-
 cepted at the time, was that "Uncle Ho,"
 the revolutionary hero who had won in-
 dependence for both parts of Vietnam,
 would have garnered as much as 80 per-
 cent of the total vote.
 So what was not settled with ballots
 10 years ago, is now being settled with
 bullets, in a civil war among the Viet-
 namese, northern and southern, Commu-
 nist and non-Communist.  We can por-
 tray this war as a case of external ag-
 gression, but most Asians are not likely
 to see it that way.  After all, we are the
 foreigners in Vietnam today.  The North
 Vietnamese are not foreigners; they are
 Vietnamese.  There     are  no  Chinese
 troops fighting in South Vietnam.   The
 only non-Vietnamese soldiers there are
 American, along with some of our Aus-
 tralian, New Zealand, and Korean allies.
 And race is a factor, on a continent
 whose people have so recently thrown off
 the domination of white, Western na-
 tions.                                                              We are  engaged in a war in
 which we, a Western power, are fighting
 Vietnamese who are oriental, and we
 are fighting them in Vietnam.  As Har-
 vard's John K. Fairbank, a noted Ameri-
 can authority on Far Eastern affairs, so
 graphically put it in a recent article:
 We are sleeping in the same bed as the
 French slept in even though we are dreaming
 very different dreams.
 They are dreams indeed if we think
 that by interjecting American troops
 into ex-colonial lands we shall stifle the
 spread of communism for long.  No na-
 tion-not  even  our  own-possesses  a
 treasury so rich, or an arsenal so large,
 as to quench the smouldering fires of
 revolution throughout the whole of the
 emerging world.
 Violent convulsions are bound to oc-
 cur in many countries of Africa, Asia,
 and Latin America, wherever injustice
 lacks a remedy and progress must spawn
 on force.  Should suppression of revolt
 abroad become an American obsession,
 we will yield to the Communists the one
 prize they most covet, an uncontested
 claim upon every incipient revolution.
 If we do not attempt through our diplo-
 macy and by our example to guide these
 currents toward democratic ends, rather
 than trying in vain to stem them, the
 Communists will be left to ride their
 crest.
 Worse still, the importation into Asia
 of troops from the Western World, fur-
 nishes the Communists with an issue of
 great popular appeal; it invariably con-
 demns the challenged government to the
 contemptible charge of puppetry.
 We would do well to remember that,
 despite our massive intervention in South
 Vietnam, the war persists and intensifies.
 Far from being extinguished, it spreads
 now into Thailand.
 Yet the Burmese Government, without
 our intervention, snuffed out a Commu-
 nist insurrection.  U.N. Secretary Gen-
 eral U Thant recently said about Burma:
 The Burmese Communist Party is still un-
 derground after  17 years and still illegal.
 Burma has over a thousand miles of land
 frontier with mainland China.  If the Bur-
 mese Government had decided at some stage
 to seek outside military assistance, then I
 am sure that Burma would have experienced
 one of two alternatives: either the country
 would be divided in two parts or the whole
 country would. have become Communist long
 ago.
 Mr. CLARK.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I yield.
 Mr. CLARK.  Mr. President, I believe
 that the Burmese analogy is well worth
 stressing, and I hope that it will receive
 appropriate attention in the press :reports
 of the Senator's speech.  To me, it is
 quite convincing.
 Is it not true that in another Asian
 country, Indonesia, an anti-Communist
 movement-with some overtones which
 I must say I am not very happy about-
 succeeded in. getting rid of the Chinese
 Communist Party  and reestablishing
 control of Indonesia for the Indonesians?
 It was perhaps a totalitarian control, but
 I draw the tentative conclusion that we
 do better in the fight for freedom and
 against Chinese communism if we keep
 America out of it, than we do if America
 goes in.
 Mr.  CHURCH.  Mr.  President,  the
 Communists are not doing very well in
 their effort to seize control of the under-
 developed world.
 Mr. CLARK. Except where we try to
 move in.
 Mr. CHURCH.  On the whole, they are
 making very little progress.  In Viet-
 nam they had the momentum of nation-
 alism to carry communism forward.

 This is sheer sophistry.  If anything
 should be clear, it is that the present
 equilibrium of power between the United
 States and the Soviet Union rests upon

 spheres -of influence.  We did not dis-

 these countries, and even encourage
 their governments to be more independ-

 ernment, that we are willing to recognize
 the neutrality of that government-and,
 indeed, that entire region-and that we
 want no military bases there.
 In all of these respects, I am in full
 agreement with the President. However,
 I am troubled that, 13 years after the end
 of the fighting in Korea and 10 years
 after the Chinese have withdrawn all of
 their troops from North Korea, and with-
 out any kind of guerrilla war to justify
 our continued presence in South Korea,
 we nonetheless keep an army of not less
 than 50,000 American troops stationed in
 that country.
 We must not permit the same thing
 to happen to us in South Vietnam. The
 American interest is not served by such
 military toeholds in southeast  Asia.
 They are unnecessary from the stand-
 point of our own security.  They tend
 to mire us down and to impede our
 mobility. I hope that we avoid in South
 Vietnam what we failed to avoid in
 Korea.
 Mr. CLARK. I take it that the Sena-
 tor would also agree with me, that if the
 Hanoi government were to commit the
 remainder of its well-trained army-and
 I take it that he would also agree that
 there is a substantial part of its well-
 trained army which has not yet been
 committed to South Vietnam-and par-
 ticularly if the Chinese should come into
 the war with "volunteers," we might
 then of necessity be required, in order to
 stay where we are and not be driven out
 by force, to further increase our ground
 forces in South Vietnam, this being coun-
 terescalation on the other side.
 Mr. CHURCH.  I agree with the Sen-
 ator.  We shall have to take the neces-
 sary military steps to prevent the Hanoi
 government from forcing us out of South
 Vietnam. Whether we ought to have
 gone there in the first place, or whether
 it was in the American interest to make
 pledges to Saigon in the aftermath of
 the French defeat is quite another ques-
 tion.
 We did so, and having made those
 pledges, we must honor them. We can-
 not permit the Hanoi government to
 force us out of South Vietnam.
 I think it should be evident that there
 is no disagreement on this score. None
 of us who have criticized American
 policy in southeast Asia, no member of
 the Committee on Foreign Relations, to
 my knowledge, no Member of the Senate,
 has advocated an American withdrawal
 from South Vietnam in repudiation of
 the pledges we have made to Saigon.
 Mr. CLARK. I say to the Senator that
 I am in complete agreement with that
 statement, and further, that I intend to
 address myself, on the floor of the Sen-
 ate, to the broad questions of our policy
 in Vietnam later this week.
 I will make an observation, and ask the
 Senator to comment on it: Assuming
 that the forces ranged against us ' in
 South Vietnam are not drastically in-
 creased by either the commitment of ad-
 ditional regular North Vietnamese troops
 or the commitment of Chinese volun-
 teers, does the Senator agree with me
 that it would be a tragic mistake to fur-
 ther increase substantially the American
 forces in South Vietnam, to make an ef-
 fort to conquer the real estate which
 we have lost, and pursue a policy of
 search and destroy in areas which have
 not been held by ourselves or our allies
 for months if not years, with the result
 that the American casualty rolls will nec-
 essarily increase?  Does the Senator
 agree that the wiser policy would be to
 follow the advice of General Gavin and
 former Ambassador Kerman, to make do
 with what we have, to encourage our
 South Vietnamese allies to press with
 their troops to recover the ground which
 they have lost, remembering the injunc-
 tion of President Kennedy, given only a
 couple of months before his assassina-
 tion, that this is their war, that they
 must win it or they will lose it, that we
 can help them with arms and with ad-
 vice, but that in the end if there is not
 the will to win by the South Vietnamese,
 to pacify their own country, we should
 not attempt to do the job for them?
 Mr. CHURCH.  I say to the Senator
 that if we had remembered the Kennedy
 injunction, we would not have 200,000
 troops in Vietnam today. We have gone
 beyond that point.
 We decided, when it became evident
 that the South Vietnamese were unable
 to overcome the rebellion, that we would
 move in our own combat forces and un-
 dertake to do so ourselves.  To be sure,
 we fight alongside the South Vietnamese.
 They have suffered heavy casualties: I
 do not mean to make light of their gal-
 lantry.   But increasingly, the burden
 falls upon American troops, as the size
 of our army there grows.  We are told
 now that perhaps there may be 300,000,
 400,000, half a million, or 600,000 Ameri-
 can troops in South Vietnam by the end
 of this year. I do not know.
 I do not wish to leave the impression,
 however, that I believe in the enclave
 theory. I think that under the present
 circumstances, we cannot afford to hole
 up in fixed position along the seacoast,
 and still retain much chance of secur-
 ing a satisfactory settlement.
 We are there. We have converted this
 struggle into an American war effort;
 and' now I think we must pursue a dy-
 namic strategy in South Vietnam. I am
 not a military man; I cannot pass upon
 the requirements of that strategy, but I
 think that we must look for guidance
 to our officers in command, who are on
 the ground, know the condition and the
 situation, and have to deal with it there.
 I do wish to stress, however, that I
 think the American military effort must
 be concentrated in South Vietnam, and
 that whatever the difficulties are, what-
 ever the strategy we pursue in the south,
 we must not let the frustrations of this
 war lead us toward widening the battle
 ever northward toward the boundaries
 of China.  I think that there will come
 a place, if we do, where the Chinese will
 come in, as they did in Korea.
 Mr. CLARK. One final question-and
 in advance of asking it I again thank the
 Senator for indulging me in this colloquy,
 and also express again my admiration
 for the splendid speech he has made.
 It is still official State Department and
 Defense Department doctrine that the
 major burden of this war is being carried
 by the South Vietnamese.  We are told
 again and again that four out of every
 five military incidents in the South are
 South Vietnamese initiatives, and not
 American initiatives. We are told of the
 upward of a half million South Viet-
 namese men under arms, fighting, we are
 told, for the defense of freedom in their
 country.
 I refer again to the Kennedy statement
 of 2 or 3 years ago. If that is the fact, as
 the State Department and the Defense
 Department continue to insist it is the
 fact, why do we not let the South Viet-
 namese win this war, with the support
 which we can give them with the 200,000
 troops and with the untold treasure we
 are pressing in there; why do we have. to
 make this an American war?
 Mr. CHURCH.  I say to the Senator,
 the question is a poignant one, but it
 is no longer a timely one.  The war has
 become an American struggle. Ameri-
 can troops are now committed to it in
 such numbers that I think this reality
 must be faced.
 I believe, however, that the distin-
 guished  Senator  from                                                                                                         Pennsylvania
 underscores the fact that guerrilla war-
 fare, in the last analysis, depends upon
 the internal situation within the coun-
 try victimized by Communist insurrec-
 tion.  In the long run, the Government
 challenged will prevail, or will be toppled,
 depending upon the willingness of the
 people of the country to rally behind it.
 The Greek Government was able to
 put down a Communist rebellion, one
 that the State Department itself likens
 to the war in .Vietnam. The Greek Gov-
 ernment had aid from the United States,
 to be sure, but not American combat
 troops. The Greeks put down the rebel-
 lion with their own troops.
 The Philippine Government put down
 a somewhat comparable insurrection, in-
 volving Communist elements, without
 the intervention of foreign troops.  It
 was done by Filipinos.
 The Burmese were able to snuff out a
 Communist-led  insurrection  in   their
 country, despite a thousand miles of
 common frontier between Burma and
 mainland China.
 On the other hand, the Batista govern-
 ment in Cuba was unable to put down a
 Communist-led rebellion.
 I think, Mr. President, that we must
 get used to the fact that we live in a
 generation of revolution;  that many
 governments are going to be challenged,
 in many countries in the underdeveloped
 world, from Asia to Africa to Latin
 America, and that the United States
 simply cannot intervene in all of these
 situations for the purpose of imposing
 American solutions.  If we try to do this,
 our country will soon be regarded as the
 sentinel of the status quo, as the self-
 appointed  defender  of  governments
 despised by their own people. Thus, we
 will give to Communists everywhere the
 banner  they most want to uphold;
 namely, an unchallenged claim upon
 every incipient revolution, the compel-
 ling assertion that they alone are the
 champions of change.
 Mr. President, it will not work.  It
 cannot work. I hope and pray that we
 will find the wisdom to avoid any policy
 so foredoomed.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE        February 21, 1966
 From the lessons of the present and
 the past, we must begin to find the guide-
 lines for a new policy much better suited
 to the problem of revolutionary wars in
 the underdeveloped world.
 If we summon a sense of restraint, I
 do not despair for the future because,
 unlike many others, I am not afraid of
 communism.  I have been in Communist
 lands.  The system has little to com-
 Iriend it.                     It is inefficient.  It is tyran-
 nical.  It is bureaucratic.  It is not pos-
 sessed of any dynamic attraction that is
 likely to ensnare and subdue the world.
 Mr. President, the great quest of men
 everywhere is for freedom.  Not many
 countries have achieved it in full meas-
 ure, but people everywhere yearn for it.
 It is the very force working within the
 Communist world to change the Commu-
 nist system itself.  It is the force work-
 ing outside the Communist world, the
 very force which produces revolutions.
 In the long run, the ancient yearning
 of mankind for freedom will prevail.
 Communism will never inherit the world.
 EXHIBIT 1
 ARE WE Too DEEP IN AFRICA AND ASIA?
 (Py the Honorable FRANK CHURCH, U.S. Sen-
 ator from Idaho, before the Economic Club
 of Detroit, Feb. 22, 1965 )
 In 1957, his first year in the Senate, it was
 CnuacH who modified the jury trial amend-
 ment to the civil rights bill, to assure Negroes
 the right to serve on Federal juries, a pro-
 cedural safeguard which opened the way for
 the first Senate action on civil right in nearly
 a century.
 FRANK  CIIrscros  has not been content to
 assess the international situation from his
 Senate office In Washington, but has traveled
 extensively throughout the world.  He was a
 delegate to the economic conference of the
 Organization of American State in Argentina
 in 1957, and to the International Parliamen-
 tary Union at Warsaw, Poland in 1959.  He
 led a delegation on a 5-week factfinding tour
 of Africa in 1960, and then made a personal
 inspection of American bases and trouble
 spots in the Pacific area late in 1962.
 The senior Senator from Idaho has been
 outspoken in his belief that our key to Asia
 is a satisfactory settlement of the political
 war in Vietnam.  It is a pleasure for me to
 present to you. the Honorable FRANK CHURCH,
 U.S. Senator from Idaho, who will discuss
 "Are We In Too Deep in Africa and Asia?"
 Senator CHURCH.   [Applause.]
 Hon.  FRANK  CHURCH. Thank  you  very
 much, Joe Hudson, for an extremely nice in-
 troduction, Mayor Cavanagh, General Bork,
 and gentlemen of the Economics Club of
 Detroit.
 Our time is limited but let me just say in
 the way of amenities that I am very proud to
 be here.  I know your two fine Senators, PAT
 McNAMARA and PHIL HART, very well.  They
 -ire good friends of mine and I respect them
 highly.  It is a special privilege to come and
 address so distinguished an audience in the
 great State they represent in the Senate of
 the United States.
 PART I. FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER
 "We can never again stand aside prideful
 in isolation," so spoke Lyndon B. Johnson at
 his inauguration.
 All Americans should agree with the Presi-
 dent.   Head.-in-the-sand isolationism  died
 a generation ago.  It isn't likely to be re-
 surrected.
 As a confirmed     internationalist, I favor
 strong American support for the United Na-
 tions, and I believe in a sensible foreign aid
 ;program.
 But the pendulum of our foreign policy
 can swing from one extreme to the other.
 Once we thought that anything which hap-
 pened abroad was none of our business; now
 we evidently thing that everything which
 happens abroad has become our business.  In
 the span of 30 years, an excess of isolationism
 has been transformed into an excess of inter-
 ventionism.
 Since the days of the Marshall plan, the
 United States has constantly expanded the
 scope of its commitment to foreign govern-
 ments.   From  Western  Europe,  we  have
 moved into Africa, the Middle East, and the
 Far East, until the dimension of our involve-
 ment has become global. Our troops are now
 stationed in no less than 30 countries, we are
 pledged. to defend 42, and we are extending
 aid, in one form or another, to nearly 100
 nations.
 Why have we spread ourselves so thinly?
 What compulsion draws us, ever deeper, into
 the internal affairs of so many countries in
 Africa and Asia, having so remote a connec-
 tion with the vital interests of the United
 States?
 The answer, I think, stems from our in-
 tensely ideological view of the cold war.  We
 fancy ourselves as guardian of the "free"
 world, though most of it isn't free, and never
 has been.  We seek to immunize this world
 against further Communist infection through
 massive  injections  of  American  aid, and,
 wherever necessary, through direct American
 intervention.  Such a vast undertaking has at
 least two defects: first, it exceeds, our na-
 tional capability; second, among the newly
 emerging nations, where the specter of West-
 ern imperialism is dreaded more than com-
 munism, such a policy can be self-defeating.
 As a seasoned, friendly :foreign diplomat re-
 cently put it: "The United States is getting
 involved in situations where no one-not even
 it nation of saints-would be welcome."
 This is not to say that we should write off
 Africa or Asia.  It is to say that a foreign
 policy of intervention, which was right for
 Western Europe, is apt to be wrong for those
 continents  which  have  just  thrown  off
 European rule.
 We were welcomed back to war-devastated
 Europe  in  1945 to be a nuclear sentinel
 against further Russian aggression. It was
 the expansion of hostile Russian power which
 summoned us, not the color of the red ban-
 ner, or our distaste for the way of life inside
 the Soviet Union.  There was no confusion
 among the NATO allies as to the identity of
 the enemy.  As long as the Russian threat
 remained imminent, we all faced in the same
 direction, united by a single will.
 There was still another reason for the suc-
 cess of our intervention in Europe-- a condi-
 tion so obvious that it is often overlooked,
 and yet so fundamental that its absence in
 Africa and Asia accounts for most of our set-
 backs on those continents.   In Europe, we
 stood among people with whom we shared a
 common ancestry, whose political and eco-
 nomic systems were similar to our own, and
 whose traditional values derived from the
 same mainstream of historical experience that
 we call Western civilization.  This cultural
 bond meant that most European generally
 shared our aims and our point of view.
 But if the inhabitants of Western Europe
 tend to see the world as we do, as a global
 arena  in  which  free  people  are  arrayed
 against  Communists,  it  does  not  follow
 that Africans and Asians share this view.
 They have been participants in a different
 revolution, more  potent   and  widespread
 than the   Communist brand-a revolution
 foreshadowed  two centuries  ago,    by  the
 American War for Independence, and whip-
 ped into flame by Woodrow Wilson's ringing
 reaffirmation of the right of self-determina-
 tion.  Neither Marx nor Lenin fathered the
 revolt against colonialism, and we needn't
 permit their successors, in Moscow or Peiping,
 to exploit the colonial issue to Communist
 advantage.
 To avoid this, we must understaand that,
 for most Africans and Asians, our concept of
 self-government and individual freedom is
 totally unreal,  having  never been experi-
 enced.                                                                                                                               In many, if not most, of these emer-
 gent lands, it is colonialism, not communism
 which is the ugly word.
 Because these facts are so well known, It
 puzzles me that American foreign policy in
 Africa and Asia has not been tied to them.
 We have plunged into these former colonial
 regions as though we had been designated
 on high to act as trustee in bankruptcy for
 the broken empires.
 First of all, we strained relations by try-
 ing to induce governments to line up with
 us in the cold war, a struggle in which few
 felt any real interest.  Forgetting that we
 ourselves had insisted upon our right to stay
 neutral for most of our history, we assailed
 neutralism as a kind of Communist trick.
 Later,  having painfully learned that cold
 war neutrality always served as a badge of
 independence and sometimes even as an um-
 brella for it, we changed tune, but, even then,
 we kept on administering our aid programs
 in ways designed to freeze out the Russians
 and Chinese.
 In regions craving aid from any source,
 our freezeout policy was bound to give rise
 to cries of undue interference.  Soon, African
 and Asian governments were demanding aid
 without  strings  attached,  while  accusing
 the United States of practicing neocolonial-
 ism.   Worse still, sensing that we feared
 competition from Communist sources, many
 a government craftily raised the ante on us,
 threatening to go to the Reds for help if
 we failed to meet some new demand.
 Worst of all, we have permitted ourselves
 to be drawn into the internal political affairs
 of so many African and Asian countries that
 anti-American feeling is rising at an alarm-
 ing rate.  Our Embassies are being subjected
 to increasingly  frequent   attacks,  our  in-
 formation libraries  are  being sacked,  and
 demagog from     Cairo  to  Djakarta court
 popular favor by rebuking us. Afro-Asian
 delegates at the U.N. castigate us with words
 of extraordinary violence.  Clearly, the pol-
 icy of intervening too much in the volatile
 ex-colonial regions  of Africa and  Asia,  is
 backfiring on the United States.
 PART II.  MISTAKES  IN  AFRICA
 Much of this could have been avoided.       I
 visited Africa in 1960, immediately after John
 F. Kennedy's election, in company with two
 of my colleagues and the President's young-
 est brother, Ten.  Wherever our presence be-
 came known, eager crowds would gather to
 shout, "Kennedy, Kennedy."  The word had
 spread through Africa that the newly elected
 President of the United States had, as a Sen-
 ator in 1957, spoken up for Algeria in her war
 for independence against France.   For the
 first time our country was being identified,
 by Arab and black alike, with legitimate Afri-
 can aspirations.  Opportunity was beckon-
 ing our way.
 If we had continued to champion Africa.
 natidnalism, the cause that counts with the
 people; if we had declared ourselves strongly
 in favor of rightful independence for the
 Portuguese territories, the flaming issue in
 Africa today;  if we had held ourselves at
 arm's length   from  the  shifti,ag  factional
 fights for power within the seething young
 African countries, regardless of the labels
 chosen to solicit outside support, I have no
 doubt that our influence in Africa would
 have kept on growing.
 But we haven't yet managed to harness our
 zeal.  Rational restraints give way to emo-
 tional involvement, which, in turn, leads to
 more intervention.   Fortunately, the Rus-
 sians have made the same mistake in Africa,
 and now the Chinese seem eager to repeat it.
 Here are two examples, one Russian, one
 American, which constitute, in my judgment,
 showcase illustrations of how not to conduct
 a winning foreign policy in Africa:

 HOW MANY DOMINICAN REPUBLICS AND
 VIETNAMS CAN WE TAKE ON?
 (By FRANK CHURCH)
 Throughout the country there is uneasi-
 ness about our foreign policy, coming from
 such different quarters and expressed in such
 divergent ways that the underlying reason
 for the  apprehension  is  often  obscured.
 Americans are always prepared to fight when
 their country is threatened; no foreign power
 can intimidate us.  The doubt and the dis-
 agreement relate to how deeply we should in-
 volve ourselves in civil wars of other coun-
 tries.  Young idealists protest our efforts in
 behalf of so many tottering governments
 afflicted by decadence and despotism and
 frequently despised by their own peoples.
 Scholars warn that the United States must
 not function as the global sentinel of the
 status quo.
 These are merely different ways of ques-
 tioning American military intervention as a
 means  for  coping with  guerrilla wars  in
 foreign lands.  People are wondering:   Are
 we to be self-appointed firemen scurrying to
 quench every revolutionary blaze, no matter
 how repugnant the government that sounds
 the alarm?
 This, many suspect, is the mission we are
 embarked   upon.  Since   it   is   an   un-
 accustomed role that clashes with our own
 revolutionary origins  and our  natural re-
 luctance to furnish a shield for any kind of
 despotism, we seek refuge in soothing se-
 matics.  We downgrade freedom by equating
 it with the absence of communism; we up-
 grade a host of dictatorial regimes by digni-
 fying them with membership in what we like
 to call the "free world."  We tell oursolves
 that the remedy for their hungry and op-
 pressed is a ration of foreign aid, with which
 we seek to buy a little reform, some small
 measure of relief, as a substitute for revolu-
 tion.  Finally,  we  suppress  any  lingering
 doubts with a heady dose of evangelical zeal.
 Thus we appear to have launched our-
 selves upon the most of far reaching Ameri-
 can crusade of this century. Dissenters are
 not apt to be forgiven for their heresy, but
 hotly branded as "appeasers" held up to scorn
 for being either "soft on communism" or sold
 on surrender.  Plainly the course of prudence
 is to march in step.
 Nevertheless, there are dissenters who will
 not be silent. Among them are senior law-
 makers in the Senate who, for differing rea-
 sons, harbor misgivings about the apparent
 trend in American foreign policy.  These men
 cannot be lumped together and dismissed
 as "neoisolationists"  Seasoned Senators like
 FOLBRIGHT, of Arkansas, RUSSELL, of Georgia,
 AIKEN, of Vermont, and MANSFIELD, of Mon-
 tana are not escapists who yearn for the re-
 turn of bygone days when we behaved as
 though we could keep out of all foreign wars.
 Such an interpretation profoundly miscon-
 strues the nature of the current anxiety in
 the Senate, where even the most outspoken
 foreign policy critics-Oregon's WAYNE MORSE
 and   laska's  ERNEST  GRUENING-are  any-
 thing but a new breed of isolationists.
 Senators such as McGovEas, of South Da-
 kota, CLARK, of Pennsylvania, GORE, of Ten-
 nessee, and the author of this article are con-
 firmed internationalists-strong supporters
 of the United Nations, of sensible foreign
 aid programs, of the Peace Corps and of
 vigorous U.S. support for the NATO alliance.
 We have upheld the President's quest for a
 settlement in Vietnam and opposed any uni-
 lateral withdrawal of American forces.
 The skeptical mood in the Senate derives,
 not from nostalgia for the past, but from a
 searching examination of the present-this
 age of ferment in which we live.  In a brief
 20 years, rampant nationalism has swept like
 a tidal wave over the once-imposing colonial
 empires.  Half a hundred newborn countries
 struggle for life, hard pressed to satisfy the
 demands of their suddenly unfettered peo-
 ples.  Everywhere the remnants of the old
 order are being challenged.  Instability is in-
 evitable.                                                                                 An erupting volcano cannot be
 capped.  No nation-not even our own-pos-
 sesses an arsenal so large, or a treasury so
 rich, as to damp down the fires of smoldering
 revolution throughout  the  whole  of  the
 awakening world.
 Even our most militant interventionists
 concede that the United States alone cannot
 protect every tottering government from vio-
 lent  overthrow.   Our                                                                            purpose,  they  say,
 should he to abstain from interfering with
 "good"  revolutions,  while suppressing the
 "bad."
 But since insurgencies these days usually
 include Communist elements, forecasting the
 end result becomes a very chancy business.
 When Batista was overthrown in Cuba, we
 gambled on Castro and lost; when the mil-
 itary junta in Santo Domingo faced rebel-
 lion in the streets, we decided not to gam-
 ble.  Instead, we dispatched 20,000 troops to
 put down the revolt, and thus assumed the
 responsibility for an occupied country.
 How many Dominican Republics and Viet-
 nams can we take on?  What if revolutions
 should now occur in Bolivia, Nigeria, and
 Iran?
 The question, we are told, will somehow
 find its answer in Vietnam.   This is our
 trial-by-ordeal, the third and final test of
 our capacity to resist Communist aggression.
 Having taught the master plotters that out-
 right invasions will be beaten back (Korea),
 that nuclear intimidation will fail (Cuban
 missile crisis), the United States must now
 teach the Communists that managed up-
 risings from within, guerrilla "wars of na-
 tional liberation," are also in vain.  Then the
 prospects for peace will brighten again.
 This is a form of self-delusion. Guerrilla
 wars, after all, are not the links of a single
 chain that can be broken in any one place.
 They can be better compared to a contagious
 disease, the germs of which are carried on
 the winds of change.  The danger of infec-
 tion is universal with immunity confined
 only to countries enjoying good internal
 health.
 So we have seen guerrilla wars, often in-
 fected by the Communist virus, erupting in
 the Dominican Republic, on the opposite side
 of the world.  At this very moment, there
 is serious danger of similar uprisings in a
 score of countries across Asia, Africa, and
 Latin America.
 The causes of these impending revolutions
 are essentially indigenous, whatever the name
 of the ideology proclaimed or the colors of
 the banners unfurled.  Regardless of the out-
 come in Vietnam, we shall have to live in a
 world beset with guerrilla wars for many
 years to come.
 In these circumstances, we should start
 to exercise a prudent restraint and develop
 a foreign policy more closely tied to a sober
 assessment of our own national interests.
 For too long we have tilted with windmills
 in world affairs.
 As President of the United States, Lyndon
 B. Johnson can no more protect the world
 from  insurrection  than  Woodrow  Wilson
 could make it safe for democracy.
 Emphatically, this does not mean that we
 should ignore Communist-infested guerrilla
 wars in the future;  rather, it means we
 should keep our intervention commensurate,
 in each case, with what we as a nation really
 have at stake.  From our current involve-
 ments, we should learn some lessons, and
 apply them as guidelines in the future.
 . In the case of the Dominican Republic, for
 example, the potential threat of a Commu-
 nist takeover occurred in a region of prime
 strategic importance to the United States.
 The  Cuban  missile  crisis  of  1962,  which
 brought us to the brink of nuclear war,
 decisively  demonstrated    how  much   is  at
 stake for the American people in the Carib-
 bean.  We will not abide another Castro-
 type regime so close to our southern shores.
 Although we  can  debate whether  or not
 Communists had actually seized control of
 the uprising in Santo Domingo, the Presi-
 dent's decision to send in American troops
 sprang from his most fundamental respon-
 sibility as Commander in Chief-the defense
 of the country.
 In Vietnam, on the other hand, the se-
 curity of the United States is not the issue.
 Saigon  doesn't  stand  guard  over  Seattle.
 By defeating Japan in the Second World
 War, we conquered the Pacific Ocean.       We
 police it, patrol it and reign over it with un-
 challenged  naval  and  aerial                                                                                                                                              supremacy.
 There is no way for the land-locked forces
 of Asia to drive us from the Pacific.
 In all honesty, we are fighting in Vietnam,
 not to defend Honolulu or Seattle, but to
 defend our national reputation.  We have
 promised much, and now we must make
 good or risk a loss of confidence in us.  The
 Spector  of  a  spreading  desertion of   the
 United States around the rim of Asia-not
 the threat posed by a Communist govern-
 ment in Vietnam-is the real fear thrusting
 us into the jungles of Indochina.
 The lesson to be learned from Vietnam
 is that when the outcome of a guerrilla war
 does  not  threaten the  vital  interests  of
 this country, we had better deal with it at
 arm's length.  If we decide to give money,
 food or guns, the aid should be rendered
 from  afar.  Every  precaution     should  be
 taken to   avoid  implicating   ourselves  so
 deeply as to convert the conflict into an
 American war.
 Military intervention on our part, even
 where it cannot be avoided, is always an
 expensive  and  protracted  adventure.     Al-
 ready we are finding it mucl'j harder to get
 out of the Dominican Republic than it was
 to get in. In South Korea a dozen years
 after the truce, we still have more than
 50,000  American troops  on duty and       the
 country is sustained by a yearly injection of
 a half-billion-dollar American dole.

 EXHIBIT 2
 IS VIETNAM ANOTHER GREECE?
 (By George C. Voumas)
 The speech of the Honorable George W.
 Bali  before  the  Northwestern  University
 Alumni Association at Evanston, Ill., pub-
 lished in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of Janu-
 ary 31, 1966 (vol 112, No. 15), deserves some
 comment, if not elucidation.
 The writer concedes at the very outset that
 his knowledge of Asian affairs would hardly
 qualify him to either offer suggestions or ob-
 servations on Vietnam or the related ques-
 tion of Chinese containment.  However, the
 analogy of U.S. intervention in Greece, if
 allowed to go unchallenged, may lead us to
 dangerous assumptions.  Both premise and
 conclusions are based on error and do vio-
 lence to the truth, giving validity to the
 often repeated charge abroad that the United
 States has a "sense of mission but no sense
 of history,"  Mr. Ball states:
 "The Soviet Union under Stalin embarked
 on a reckless course of sseking to extend
 Communist power."
 And further:
 "But in terms of tactics on the ground,
 Greece is a closer analogy.  For there, 20
 years ago, as in South Vietnam today, the
 Communists sought to achieve their purpose
 by what is known in their lexicon as a war
 of national liberation.
 "They chose this method of aggression both
 in Greece and Vietnam because tactics of
 terror and sabotage, of stealth and subver-
 sion, give a great advantage to a disciplined
 and ruthless minority, particularly where,
 as in those two countries, the physical ter-
 rain made concealment easy and impeded
 the use of heavy weapons."
 The past 20 years have separated fact from
 fiction on this subject, and the facts are well
 established.  First honors for dispelling the
 fog must go to Winston Churchill's "Triumph
 and Tragedy" (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1953);
 second, Vladmir Dedijer's "Tito" (Simon &
 Schuster,  1963);  and  last,  but not  least,
 Milovan Djilas' "Conversations With Stalin"
 (Harcourt, Brace & World, 1962).
 1. There was not a question of war of na-
 tional liberation in Greece.                      The Greek war
 for national liberation was fought in 1821-
 27, receiving acclaim and support from free-
 dom-loving persons the world over.
 During World War II the Greeks, after a
 magnificent  resistance  to    the  German-
 Italian occupation, followed closely on the
 heels of the retreating Germans, and occu-
 pied the entire Greek territory.                     Since the
 EAM (national liberation front) was in con-
 trol practically of the entire country,  no
 question of liberation was involved. The
 issue over which tens of thousands lost their
 lives was the form of government to be es-
 tablished.
 The EAM, to which the overwhelming ma-
 jority of the Greek people belonged, was
 suspicious of English motives-particularly
 after Churchill's insistence upon the return
 of King George II.  The resistance fighters
 opposed  it.  They knew  that   the  Greek
 dynasty and its local retinue were the instru-
 ment and symbols of what the Chinese now
 call "neo-colonialism." It is an historic fact
 that the Greek dynasty was imposed upon
 Greece by British diplomacy.  (King George
 I, a Danish prince and founder of the Glyks-
 burg dynasty in Greece, was in the pay of
 the British Exchequer from the day he first
 set foot on Greek soil in 1863 to the day he
 was  assassinated  in  Salonica  in  1913.)
 George II, after an exile of years, returned
 to Greece in the middle thirties. Soon there-
 after                  he    sanctioned  the  Metaxas  quasi-
 Fascist dictatorship-a regime that filled old
 Greek jails and forts with political prisoners
 and the waterless islands of the Aegean with
 exiles.
 2. The issue which caused the clash in
 Athens in 1944 was settled by the Varzika
 Agreement, the King-then in London-hav-
 ing agreed to the appointment of a Regent.
 General Scobie, while ordaining Greek Cabi-
 net with a liberal facade, armed and counte-
 nanced rightist gants (known as "X"-ites)
 and otherwise promoted a reign of terror at
 the countryside, presenting all former par-
 ticipants in the EAM with the  choice to
 either be slaughtered like Iambs or be shot
 like wolves.  Under such provocation "even
 a saint would turn savage."
 The world did not know then what Mr.
 Churchill  proudly   records  in  his  history
 ("Triumph     and  Tragedy,"  p.  227)    that
 he and  Stalin had agreed on the division of
 the Balkans on October 9, 1944:
 (Churchill) " * * Let us, settle about our
 affairs In the Balkans  Your armies are in
 Rumania and Bulgaria.     We have interests,
 missions, and agents there.  Don't let us get
 at cross purposes in small ways.  So far as
 Britain  and  Russia  are    concerned, how
 would it do for you to have 90 percent pre-
 dominance in Rumania, for us to have 90
 percent of the say in Greece, and go 50-50
 about Yugoslavia?'    While this was being
 translated, I wrote out on a half sheet of
 paper:
 Rumania:                  Percent
 Russia----------------------------
 The others------------------------
 Greece :
 Great  Britain  (in  accord  with
 United States) ------------------ 90
 Russia----------------------------    10
 Yugoslavia-------------------------- 50-50
 Hungary----------------------------- 50-50
 Bulgaria:
 Russia----------------------------    75
 The others----------------------- 25
 I pushed this across to Stalin, who had by
 then heard the translation.  There was a
 slight pause.  Then he took his blue pencil
 and made a large tick upon it, and passed
 it back to us.  It was all settled in no more
 time than it takes to set down."
 Mr. Churchill was elated with this agree-
 ment.                                                                              Referring to it years later, he de-
 clared: "I made an agreement with Stalin,
 and he kept it."
 Then we have Tito's biographer, Vladimir
 Dedijer, who, after enumerating the various
 acts and deeds of the British in Yugoslavia
 and the support given by Churchill to King
 Peter, etc., states (page 250) :
 "For those reasons Yugoslavia's early post-
 war attitude toward events in Greece was
 dictated by the danger which threatened its
 independence  and  free  development from
 that quarter."
 Mr.  Dedijer  attributes  the  Tito-Stalin
 breach to the Greek revolution and Stalin's
 suspicion that Tito supported it.
 Then we have Milovan Djilas' (both Djilas
 and Dedijer have been jailed by Tito) "Con-
 versations With Stalin."                                                                                 He states (page
 131) :
 "In Greece a civil war was being fought.
 Yugoslavia had been charged in the United
 Nations with giving it material aid and in-
 spiring it; while Yugoslav relations with the
 West, and especially with the United States,
 were strained to the breaking point.
 "When I think back, it seems to me that
 the Soviet Government not only looked with
 satisfaction at this sharpening of Yugoslav-
 Western relations, but even incited it, taking
 care, of course, not to go beyond the limits
 of its own interests and possibilities.  Molo-
 tov. almost embraced Kardelj in Paris after
 the shooting down of two American planes
 in Yugoslavia, though he also cautioned him
 against shooting down a third.  The Soviet
 Government took no direct action with re-
 spect to the uprising in Greece, practically
 leaving Yugoslavia to face the music alone
 in the United Nations, nor did it undertake
 anything decisive to bring about an armis-
 tice-not until Stalin found it to his in-
 terst."
 And on page 181:
 "Stalin then turned to the uprising in
 Greece.  'The uprising in Greece has to fold
 up.' (He used for this word 'svernut', which
 means literally to roll up.)   'Do you be-
 lieve'-he turned to Kardelj-'in the success-
 of the uprising in Greece?'
 "Kardelj replied, 'If foreign intervention
 does not grow and if serious and political
 and military errors are not made.'
 "Stalin went on, without paying attention
 to Kardelj's opinion: If, if.  No, they have
 no prospect for success at all.  What do you
 think, that Great Britain and the United
 States-the United States, the most power-
 ful state in the world-will permit you to
 break their line of communication. In the
 Mediterranean  Sea.   Nonsense.   And  we
 have no navy.  The uprising in Greece must
 be stopped, as quickly as possible.
 3. To say, "The Soviet Union under Stalin
 embarked on a reckless course of seeking to
 extend Communist power," on the basis of
 the Greek experience, is totally untenable.
 All the polemics, releases, and communiques
 by the White House and State Department at
 the time notwithstanding, the established
 fact remains that Stalin-as far as the Greek
 revolution was concerned-was on the side of
 Truman.  (On this very point it would be
 pertinent to quote a paragraph from an
 article which appeared in the Nation maga-
 zine-issue of January 17, 1966, written by
 Howard Zinn under the title, "Setting the
 Moral Equation," p. 62, 2d col., 5th line:
 ("A political scientist doing strategic re-
 search for the Government told me recently

 cided not too long ago that they had been
 completely wrong about the premise which

 postwar period-the premise that Russia
 hoped  to  take  over  Western  Europe  by
 force.")
 The United States did not intervene in
 Greece until after Great Britain threw in
 the sponge.  In other words, the aim of the
 Greek fighters-elimination of British neo-
 colonialism-was realized.  When the United
 States intervened, the conflict could be nego-
 tiated and amicably settled if political con-
 ditions in Washington permitted it.   We
 must not forget that the reservoir of good-
 will in Greece is great, indeed, going back to
 1821, the struggle for Greek independence
 from the Turks, and the aid America gave to
 the cause.  The United States is looked upon
 not only by Greeks, but by the better-in-
 formed the world over as the fairest daughter
 of Greek classicism.  In addition, present-
 day America is the host country to many
 hundreds of thousands of erstwhile Greek
 immigrants who are part of the American
 Commonwealth.     (Every  fifth  family  in
 Greece  has  a  close  relative  living  in
 the United States.)  However, McCarthyism
 at home, growing daily into hurricane force,
 permitted no such ending.   "Anticommu-
 nism" became a substitute for policy, with
 the result that soon thereafter U.S. presence
 was extended to Turkey, then Iran, etc., etc.,
 around the periphery of the Soviet Union.
 That Is how and when the cold war was born.
 4. U.S. Intervention, being free of neo-
 colonialism, succeeded where Great Britain
 failed.  King George II was restored to the
 throne and Greece, thanks to American aid,
 recovered to an extent from the ravages of
 war, occupation, and civil strife.  The past
 20 years or so have been more or less tran-
 quil.  The last elections-the first truly free

 governed since by a coalition of minority
 parties  with  royal  blessing.   The  fragile
 Greek economy, however, saddled as it has

 has raised its ugly head.  This, in turn, has

 WASHINGTON: THE RUSK DOCTRINE
 f By James Reston)
 WASHINGTON,  February  19.-Secretary of
 State Rusk has put a grim doctrine before
 the people of this country. He was a respon-
 sive and forthright witness before the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee and it is im-
 portarrt that we understand what he thinks
 our duties and responsibilities are in the
 world.
 First, in Vietnam, we are to commit to the
 battle whatever is necessary to end the ag-?
 gression and bring about the freedom and
 security of South Vietnam.
 What this means, he conceded, depends
 primarily on what the enemy commits (the
 Chinese committed 1 million men to the bat??
 tie in Korea).  He would not say there was
 no limit to the men and material the United
 States would send to Vietnam, but he stuck
 to his proposition that we would maintain
 military superiority there no matter how long
 it took to stop the fighting.
 RUSKS OBJECTIVE
 This objective, it should be noted, was not
 made conditional on what the South Viet-
 namese or any of the other allies contributed
 to the fighting.  There is no longer much
 talk here of victory depending primarily on
 the South Vietnamese Army.  Mr. Rusk dis-
 cussed the freedom of South Vietnam as a
 vital American interest, essential to our own
 security and critical to all the other security
 commitments we have taken to over 40 other
 countries.  'This is a formidable doctrine.
 Second, the Secretary of State gave an in-
 teresting interpretation of America's obli-
 gations as a member of the Southeast Asia
 Treaty Organization.  In the event of armed.
 aggression against the territory covered by
 that treaty, he said, America's obligation to
 oppose the aggression did not depend on aal.
 the members agreeing to oppose it., but it
 was America's duty to do so regardless of
 what the others did (which in Vietnam is
 very little).
 THE  AMERICAN  COMMITMENI
 This did                    not mean,  Secretary Rusk re-
 marked, that the United States was obligated
 to oppose Communist aggression everywhere
 in the world or that we were going around
 looking for fights to put down.              For example,
 we did not oppose Communist China's ag-
 gression in Tibet or the Soviet Ur.on's ag-
 gression in Hungary, for we had not taken
 any commitment to do so, but this still leaves
 us with commitments the like of which no
 sovereign nation ever took in the history of
 the world.
 For the United States is committed to op-
 pose Communist aggresion all alone the pe-
 riphery of the Communist nations from the
 North Cape of Norway through the heart of
 Europe to Greece and Turkey (NATO)); along
 the southern frontier of the Soviet Union
 in the Near and Middle East (the Eisenhower
 resolution);  and thence through southeast
 Asia (SEATO) to Australia, New Zealand, the
 Philippines, Japan, and Korea.  And if you
 add our obligations under the Organization
 of American States and our obligations un-
 der the United Nations, you take in most of
 the rest of the world.
 The Rusk doctrine makes the Monroe Doc-
 trine or the Truman doctrine seem rather
 cheap.  Monroe limited his commitments to
 the Western Hemisphere.  Truma l wanted
 to oppose communism primarily by economic
 means.  And even John Foster Dulles, who
 was not a timid man, thought eac%r alliance
 should stand on its own terms and depend to
 some degree on what the other members of
 the alliance did.
 But the Rusk doctrine draws si distinc-
 tion between powerful industrial democratic
 states  in Europe  and  weak  undemocratic
 states in Asia.  His view seems to be that
 the United States must redeem the promises
 of every alliance it has signed regardless of
 what the other signatories do, and that fail-
 ure to keep everybody's promise in one alli-
 ance Will destroy the confidence of the world
 in all other alliances we have signed.
 THAT BLANK CHECK
 If this is true, it is odd that mr,st of our
 allies in Europe, the Middle East and even in
 Japan. are critical of our operation  in Viet-
 nam, but this is the thesis Mr. Rusk placed
 before the Foreign Relations Committee.
 And the interesting thing is than the Sen-
 ators cannot really do much about it, which
 accounts for all the frustration they have
 demonstrated on the TV screens in the last
 few days.  For in the moment of crisis dur-
 ing the Communist attack on our ships In
 the Gulf of Tonkin, President Johnson asked
 for a blank check to deal with aggression all
 over southeast Asia-including the right to
 use  any force  he  deemed  necessary-and
 once he had published that request, the Con-
 gress had no choice but to grant it to him
 or--what was unthinkable-repudiate him
 in the face of the enemy.
 '511:E SENATE'S DILEMMA
 NOT can the Senate do anything to take
 back this  promise  under present. circum-
 stances.  If Senator MoasE presses his resolu-
 tion to withdraw the Tonkin Gulf resolution,
 obviously few if any Congressmen are going
 to vote with him and turn their backs on
 the 200,000 Americans now fighting in Viet-
 nam.
 But their helplessness merely emphasizes
 the transformation that has taken place in
 American and world politics.  The President,
 if he chooses his time carefully, can obviously
 get almost any commitment he likes from
 the Congress in the moment of crisis, and
 under the Rusk doctrine, we are then obliged
 to redeem each commitment, regardless of
 what the other parties to the agreement do,
 or risk the destruction of the entire system
 of American alliances created since the last
 war.
 All this goes well beyond Vietnam in space
 and time.  Mr. Rusk has asked the Senate to
 contain  the  expansion of communism all
 along the periphery of the Communist em-
 pire, by force of arms and without allies if
 necessary, and the Congress cannot oppose
 him in present circumstances without op-
 posing its own men in Vietnam, which it
 obviously will not do.
 [From the New York Times, Feb. 21, 1966(
 ERROR IN VIETNAM POLICY
 To the EDITOR:
 Perhaps the most significant remark made
 by George F. Kennan in his testimony be-
 fore the Senate Foreign Relations Commnit-
 tee on February 10 was that "From the long-
 term standpoint, therefore, and on principle,
 I think our military involvement in Vietnam
 has  to  be  recognized  as  unfortunate,  as
 something we would not choose deliberately
 if the choice were ours to make all over
 again today.
 This,    in substance, agrees with Senator
 FRANK CHuecli's recent assertion that "In
 Vietnam, the security of the United States is
 not the issue. * * * In all honesty, we are
 fighting in Vietnam not to defend Honolulu
 or Seattle, but to defend our national repu-
 tation."
 Here we have the bare, blunt facts before
 us; that if we had the 'choice to make over
 again, we would not follow the course we
 did and involve ourselves in affairs in Viet-
 nam.  Does anyone doubt that truth of this?
 We admittedly made a mistake in involving
 ourselves again in a land war on Asian soil,
 for which error in judgment American lives
 and resources have been and are now being
 paid, with no knowing what the future hclds
 in store in the way of continued sacrifices,
 and the possibility of an ensuing nuclear
 war with its catastrophic consequences.
 Under  such  circumstances,  is  it  any
 wonder that there has been so much adverse
 criticism regarding our policy in Vietnam?
 I believe that what the President and the
 American people are going to have to decide
 is: Shall we be stubborn and remain in Viet-
 nam not for the sake of our national secu-
 rity but for the sake of our national security
 but for the sake of our national reputation?
 Or shall we swallow our pride, recognize the
 mistake we have made, and withdraaw?  We
 have no other choice-it is one or the other.
 NO ADVERSE EFFECT
 I believe we are big enough and strong
 enough to withstand any adverse effect that
 a withdrawal. might engender.  In fact, I be-
 lieve                                                                                                                                 we would gain  in         stature  in  world
 opinion, rather than the reverse, by doing
 so, just as I believe Pope Paul VI and Sec-
 retary General U Thant would applaud and
 commend such action on our part.
 While it may be that there is a moral
 issue involved in a withdrawal from Viet-
 nam, is there not a far greater moral re-
 sponsibility on our part at stake, win. to
 remain can lead to a devastating nuclear
 war, entailing, as it would, the possibility of
 a virtual wiping-out of civilization?   Cer-
 tainly, doing so will save American lives, and
 would leave the onus of war upon others
 The Soviet  Union's  relation with      Corn-
 munist China would not be improved were
 the latter to become too aggressive in Asia
 The issue of war should be allowed to lie
 between them, not with us.

 nation while enslaving even a smaller one.
 Would you please ask Secretary Rusk about
 this.  I'll be watching.     I have, do, and will

 Ore., and more recently from my husband,
 Sgt. R. M. Omalley, USMC with whom you
 had dinner on 't'hanksgiving Day, 1965, at
 USNH at Yokuska, Japan, he was there re-
 covering from wounds received in Vietnam.
 Until my husband was wounded I had not
 paid much attention to our U.S. foreign pol-
 icies, since that time I want to learn the
 reasons my husband has to fight and risk his
 life, l: have now read and listened about the
 war as much as possible during the Foreign
 Relations Committee hearings.  I am in full
 :,greement with you and the other Senators
 who are against our foreign policy in Viet-
 nam.                I also feel that the U.S. Government
 ins no right to give our money and aid to
 Communist nations which in turn support
 the governments which are killing our men.
 I feel that U.S. policies need a good looking
 at, what can I do to express my opinion and
 Delp change our policies. My husband is also
 against  this  military action.   Requested
 rile to get informaton on the Senate debate
 and forward them to him. Can you help me
 to do this again.  I want to say I am 100 per-

 stand regarding Vietnam.  Practically speak-

 ly,  with the World Council of Churches.
 You, however, are our spokesman.  Further,
 it is perhaps time that the President be re-
 minded of his moral responsibilities to the
 world as well as his legal restrictions under
 the U.S. Constitution.  A war Is a war is a
 war.  Time was when aggressive military es-
 ercise was legislated not executed.  A twist of
 semantics seems to have taken this legality
 right out of the laps of Congress and placed
 it in the hands of a paranoic megalomaniac
 I only pray that you, Senator FULBRIGHT, and
 men such as Mr. Kennan, and General Gavin
 can persuade your colleagues of your  own

 so are the beds and the dreamers themselves.
 Let us compare them and see when the end
 of the night may come.
 Nothing could be more valuable for Ameri-
 can leaders at the moment than a close ex-
 amination of the disastrous errors made by
 the French in Indochina from 1945 to 1956.
 To know the faults of a friend may not cure
 one's  own,  but  from  France's  experience
 America might well learn something of what
 has gone so dreadfully wrong in Vietnam
 today.
 The French had three great dreams for
 Indochina and each led them into a different
 and more ugly phase of the war.  At first, in
 1946, they clung briefly to the dream of re-
 establishing their prewar empire in Indo-
 china.  Indeed, for one hopeful moment they
 seemed to be on the verge of a promising
 new colonial policy: General Leclerc, sent out
 to reconquer the territory, decided instead to
 negotiate with  the  Vietnam revolutionary
 leader, Ho Chi Minh. Leclerc recognized Ho's.
 Vietnam as a "freestate," connected with
 France, but controlling its own diplomacy.
 army, and finances.  This was the first agree-
 ment made  between  a European colonial
 power and the Asian revolution--and one of
 the shortest lived and saddest in retrospect.
 For within weeks the intrigues of colonialists
 in Saigon and Paris and extremists among
 the Vietminh and its nationalist allies suc-
 ceeded in scrapping it.  The way was now
 open for France to plunge into full-scale
 colonial war.  But it soon became clear to
 everybody that this would have been a hope-
 less venture, doomed from the start by the
 half-ruined state of France, the lack of an
 air force and navy, and the disapproval of
 the Russians and Americans.
 At this point the French conceived their
 second Indochinese dream which led them
 into a second 'war, lasting from 1948 to 1951.
 Now they would  transform  their colonial
 struggle into a civil war.  Against Ho's Viet-
 minh they would set in opposition the "inde-
 pendent" Emperor Bao Dai, encouraging him
 to cultivate his own anti-Communist but na-
 tionalist leadership-a policy described by
 the distinguished Scholar Paul Mus as "na-
 tionalist counterfire."
 Perhaps it might have succeeded if the
 nationalists had been  given  a  chance  to
 make it work.  But their power and prestige
 and autonomy were always limited.     While
 Vietnamese  and  French  troops  died  cou-
 rageous.  Bao Dai preoccupied himself with
 tiger hunting, his ministers with profiteer-
 ing.  The Vietminh methodically liquidated
 Bao Dai's officials, dominated the country-
 side, and organized its soldiers into clivision:.
 soon after the Chinese Communists arrived
 on the northern frontier in 1950.
 After this decisive event and the outbreak:
 of the Korean war, France dreamed once
 again of transforming  the nature  of  the
 war in Vietnam, this time into an interim.
 tional conflict with communism.   In Sep
 tember 1951  General de Lattre arrived  in
 Washington to argue that France, faced with
 Vietminh  subversion supported  by    Corn -
 munist China, now needed and deserved to
 have its risks shared.  He was given both
 credits and weapons.   But later, in 1954, on
 the eve of Dienbienphu, the French Gov-
 ernment demanded far more: It requested
 that several hundred American bombers b,-
 ordered to attack the enemy from Manila.
 To these requests Washington  finally  re-
 sponded that "Indochina does not tall within
 the perimeter of the area vital to the de-
 fense of the United States."
 We can now admire the wisdom which led
 President  Eisenhower  to  reject both the
 agitated  appeals  of the French  and  the
 advice of Admiral Radford and Vice Presi
 dent Nixon, both of whom recommended in-
 tervention.                                                                                                                                              But we may well ask why a
 country not considered of vital importance

 with a small and poorly armed country; its

 fearing a crushing American response.  Cer-
 tainly it is a Communist government, but
 one presided over by a min who in 1946 and
 1954 was able to prove to the Frenc It his will-
 ingness to accept compromise.  And of the
 four points posed as conditions by 13anoi last
 year, Washington now accepts three.  Why
 then  doesn't  Ho  play  Lyndon  Johnson's'
 game?  In a conference the North Vietnamese
 would hold so many trumps that   heir pres-
 ent position is hard to understand.
 But perhaps they were not in a position
 to negotiate at all. If we look ba+-k over the
 history of the NLF we find support for the
 view that Hanoi is not able to speak for the
 front.  First for psychological reaons: The
 published  program of  the  NLF  expressly
 mentions the possibility of an independent
 powerful  revolutionary  organization  sup-
 ported by the North and already in control
 of the largest part of the national territory.
 More important is the task of reestablishing
 the  constitutional legitimacy which Diem
 embodied for a brief period-reactionary as
 he was-and which has since vanished.  The
 NLF is an essential element of this lei*Ititnacy
 because it is the heir to the revolt against.
 Diem's totalitarianism as well as the princi-
 ple force of resistance to foreign interven-
 tion.  But there are others who make up tho
 social and  political  society  as  well--Lute.
 Buddhists, the Catholics, and also the Army,
 a bourgeoisie in uniform.
 An effective policy to bring about, a peace-
 ful settlement should begin by making it
 possible for each of these groups to return tar
 an active political role.  While General Ri,
 after having won his sole victory of the war
 at Honolulu, occupies the stage, we may be
 sure that the other groups are ready in the
 wings, waiting for the protection and en-

 the NLF.  The democratization of power in
 South Vietnam Is not a fantasy.  The de-
 struction of the small democratic movements
 struggling to survive under Diem was among
 the factors that led to the civil war.
 French colonial policy was only too familiar
 with these very diverse political factions and
 brilliantly played them off, one against the
 other.   But to divide and rule became a
 pathetic policy as France's control became
 more  feeble.  An  American  policy  which
 seeks a peaceful settlement must take ac-
 count of both the sociopolitical pluralism of
 South Vietnam and its extraordinary capac-
 ity for finding original-and local-solutions
 to its problems. Surely it is time for Ameri-
 can leaders at last to confront the people
 with whom they have become so inextricably
 involved.

 unut oxgarertes probably caused cancer, heart
 disease, and chronic coreopsis.
 An alarmed Congress, concerned with our
 welfare above all, took the momentous step
 of ordering warnings printed on all cigarette
 packages that the coffin nails therein might
 be bad for us.  It then voted continued sub-
 sidies to the farmers to go on growing more
 cigarette tobacco.
 But many a smoker, on viewing the warn-
 ing, cried: "Good heavens.  Cigarettes may
 be bad for me.  I never would have thought
 it."  And, naturally, the cigarette industry
 was gravely concerned.
 The dilemma seemed insoluble. But the
 Department of Agriculture has now stepped
 into the breech.  It's spending $210,000 on a
 filmed commercial entitled "The World of
 Pleasure."  It's designed to stimulate more
 cigarette smoking.  But that's OK, because
 we're only going to show it abroad.

 Rural America Must Not Be Shortchanged
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. GLENN CUNNINGHAM
 OF NEBRASKA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 21, 1966
 Mr.  CUNNINGHAM.  Mr.  Speaker,
 Congress should give serious considera-
 tion to a statement issued by the Na-
 tional Farmers Union Executive Com-
 mittee.                                                                                                        Rural America must not be
 shortchanged, as such neglect would
 .have grave consequences so far as our
 national welfare is concerned.
 The statement referred to follows:
 STATEMENT  OF  NATIONAL  FARMERS  UNION
 EXECUTIVE  COMMITTEE  MEETING  IN  DEN-
 VER, COLO., FEBRUARY 8, 1966
 The Johnson administration's new budg-
 et, if put into effect, would be a slap in the
 face for America's hard working and already
 disadvantaged farm and ranch families. We
 fail to see any reasonable justification for
 the heavy cutbacks in funds for soil conser-
 vation, the commodity programs, farm and
 home loans, rural electrification, vocational
 agriculture and the land grant college and
 extension education when a hungry world
 is crying for food.  The slashing of school
 milk funds is a tragic oversight.
 Few people realize most of these moneys,
 except for agricultural  education,  are  on
 matching  funds  or  reimbursable    lending
 basis  and contribute   importantly       to  the
 gross  national  production  in addition  to
 adding strength to rural living.  Yet these
 vital functions are being seriously weakened
 while there has been no such cutback in
 Federal aid to the big bankers, as the budget
 shows this interest item for the Federal debt
 has been set at the astounding level of near-
 ly $13 billion annually.
 We call upon Members of Congress to re-
 move these gross deficiencies in the Johnson
 budget that adversely affect agriculture and:

 VOTE ON VIETNAM
 Policies that the United States is pur-
 suing in South Vietnam have emerged out
 of convictions matured over a generation.
 They are based on the settled policies of
 one government after another.   They rest
 legally and constitutionally on the resolu-
 tions and appropriations and actions of Con-
 gress.
 The hearings before the Senate Commit-
 tee on Foreign Relations, especially in the
 testimony of Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
 have reminded the country of how we ar-
 rived  at  these  convictions.   They  have
 focused  attention  on  the premises upon
 which we have acted.   They have made clear-
 er the continuity of American policy. They
 have reminded Congress and the country of
 the legal and constitutional framework of
 our policy.
 The southeast Asia resolution of August
 10, 1964, was inspired by a particular crisis
 but it did not initiate a new doctrine, de-

 February 21, 1966      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-' APPENDIX
 by Russian Boyars, Poland tried to form a
 union with Russia, but this did not bring
 positive results.  In this period (1566-1632)
 the Polish Armies under the leadership of
 Hetmari Stanislaw Zolkiewski, occasionally
 occupied Moscow and the Kremlin.
 In 1920, Poland, with future federation in
 mind, helped Ataman Semen Petlura to form
 an independent Ukraine, and in a battle with
 Soviet armies, the Polish forces liberated the
 capital of the Ukraine, Kiev.
 FIRST REPUBLIC
 As for internal constitutional forms, from
 the year 1573 the Polish nobility began to
 elect its kings, and thus Poland became the
 first republic, although only nobiliary.
 Political freedom flourished, manifested by
 such outgrowths as "Pacta Conventa," or
 argeements made by the nobility with the
 elected kings which imposed various polit-
 ical and financial obligations on them, and
 "Liberum Veto," which made it possible for
 only one deputy to parliament (the Sejm)
 to dissolve the parliament and  annul it's
 resolutions.   (In a sense the veto in the
 United Nations Security Council can trace
 its ancestry to Poland in the 17th century.)
 This led to an anarchy in political life and
 the collapse of the inner strength of the
 nation and contributed to the partitions of
 Poland.
 Nevertheless, it was an expression of the
 spirit of freedom.  Finally, the modern con-
 stitution of May 3, 1791, did away with this
 anarchy, restoring hereditary monarchy and
 a  strong  government  and  canceling  the
 "Liberum   Veto."   Three  years    later,  on
 May  7,  1794.  Gen.  Tadeusz   Kosciuszko
 issued   the  Polaniecki   Manifesto which
 served to partially free the peasants from
 serfdom while during the    1863  uprising
 against  Russia the   National  Government
 freed them from these duties completely.
 COUNTRY OF FREEDOM
 During the course of history Poland be-
 came the country of religious freedom and
 tolerance, insured by the Warsaw Confedera-
 tion of 1573 which guaranteed the free wor-
 ship of any religion.  Arians, Lutherans and
 Calvinists, Poles and foreigners, enjoyed this
 freedom.  From  the  11th  century  Jews
 settled in Poland in their flight from perse-
 cution in other European countries.                  Before
 the Second World War more than 3 million
 Jews, enjoying full rights, lived in Poland.
 Jewish religious life flourished. The most
 important Hebrew universities  and  pub-
 lications  were  to  be  found  in                      Poland
 (Jeszybot in Lublin),  The Hitlerite occupa-
 tion put an end to this--at this time the
 Polish Jews were exterminated, except for
 300,00 hidden by the Polish people, al-
 though they were threatened with the death
 penalty for helping them.
 In present-day Poland there is no room
 for religious tolerance, but nevertheless the
 Catholic Church and the Polish people suc-
 cessfully oppose the religious persecution by
 the Communist regime.
 POLISH MILLENNIUM-CONCLUSION
 SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION
 Poland's  contribution  to  the  scientific
 achievement of the world is considerable.
 Here may be mentioned  the Jagiellonian
 University founded in 1364, which celebrated
 of  distilling  oil  and  the founder of the
 world's first oil mine near Krosno, Ludwik
 Zamenhoff, the inventor of the language of
 esperanto (1887) and Maria Curie-Sklodow-
 ska (1867-1934) Nobel Laureate for the dis-
 covery of radium.
 In the field of literature the following
 writers gained recognition: Wladyalaw Rey_
 wont (1867-1925), who received the Nobel
 Prize mostly for his novel "The Peasants";
 Henryk Sienkiewicz  (1846-1916), who also
 received this prize mostly for his epic "Quo
 Vadis," and Jozef Conrad-Korzeniowski, a
 Pole writing in English, an author of world
 fame.
 In music Fryderyk Chopin  (1810-49)  is
 one of the world's best renowned composers;
 besides him there are Stanislaw Moniuszko
 (1819-72), Ignacy Paderdwski (1860-1941),
 and Karol Szymanowski  (1882-1937).  In
 the theater and cinema Helena Modrzejew-
 ska-Modjeska (1840-1909), Pola Negri, born
 1897, gained world fame.
 POLES IN UNITED STATES
 At the time of the Polish partitions, Polish
 life also began to develop outside of Poland,
 particularly in the United States, where
 thousands of people emigrated.  Poles took
 part in the American Revolution.
 The first five Poles arrived in America on
 the English ship Mary and Margaret land-
 ing in Jamestown on October 1, 1608.
 General  Tadeusz  Kosciuszko    came  to
 America in August 1776, and General Kazi-
 mierz Pulaski in 1777, and both of them took
 part in the Revolutionary War under the
 leadership of George Washington.
 At the end of the war Kosciuszko was
 called "the father of American artillery,"
 and Pulaski, who fell in the battle of Savan-
 nah, was called "the father of American
 cavalry."  The American people honor them
 to this day.  Statues of Kosciuszko may be
 found in the square before the White House,
 in West Point, and Pulaski's on Pennsylvania
 Avenue in Washington, and in many other
 places.   Many towns, bridges and highways
 in the United States bear the names of these
 American heroes.
 During the Civil War 168 officers and about
 4,000 men of Polish extraction served in the
 Union Army, among them Generals Wlodzi-
 mierz Krzyzanowski, Jozef Karge and Albin
 Schoepf, and in the Confederate Army there
 were 17 officers and about 1,000 men of Polish
 extraction,  among  them  General  Kacper
 Tochman.
 Approximately    900,000  Polish-Americans
 served in the American Army in World War
 II.
 In 1860 the Polonia in the United States
 numbered 30,000; at present it numbers more
 than 10,000,000 Americans of Polish descent,
 and the capital of Polish-American organi-
 zations comes to approximately $500,000,000.
 There are more than 50,000 members of the
 Polish-American  intelligentsia  (professors,
 attorneys, judges, doctors, engineers, jour-
 nalists, etc.).  In the present U.S. Congress
 there is 1 Senator of Polish extraction, ED-

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. ROBERT N. C. NIX
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 21, 1966
 Mr. NIX.  Mr. Speaker, the Commu-
 nists have let loose an idea in southeast
 A851
 Asia which cannot be stopped by bul-
 lets-but only by another idea, more
 appealing and more meaningful to the
 hearts and minds of the people.
 Because of this, it was wise of this ad-
 ministration to realize that the Vietnam
 war is a war on two fronts, and both
 must be waged at the same time.
 The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin of
 February 8 had a thoughtful editorial
 along these lines the other day, and it
 pointed out that:
 The task has always been understood.  The
 difficulty was and remains a related problem,
 how to protect the civilian aids in areas
 still open to Vietcong attack.
 Yet, the editorial continued-
 Protection and progress must go hand in
 ,hand.  That will require a massive effort, in
 which   the Saigon  government seems dis-
 posed to try to play a more effective role, with
 greater resources, than it was ever able to
 play before.
 The need for, and the problems of re-
 construction and a general building up of
 Domes and schools and crops in this land
 of agony is one which concerns us all, and
 because of this, the editorial-so en-
 lightening on the subject-is offered for
 the RECORD.
 RECONSTRUCT{ON IN VIETNAM
 As Premier Ky has expressed it, the cen-
 tral problem for the Vietnamese Government
 is "not only to root out the Vietcong from
 the rural areas, but also to root ourselves in."
 This means, as it has for the past 10 years,
 the training of thousands of young Viet-
 namese to go out in teams to isolated villages
 after the army, with American assistance,
 has cleared the area.  Their purpose will be
 to replace the sinister and shadowy domina-
 tion of the Vietcong with something visibly
 better in the way of health and sanitation,
 school construction, police, crop manage-
 ment, land reform, and local self-government.
 The task has always been understood.  The
 difficulty was and remains a related problem,
 how to protect the civilian aids in areas still
 open to Vietcong attack.  Over the years,
 the  Communists  have  relied  on  a cold-
 blooded campaign of assassination,                                                                                                                                     which
 has bled South Vietnam of thousands of
 trained young workers. Combined *ith sab-
 otage,  it  has  effectively                                                                                                                                terrorized  the
 villagers.
 Not until they know that participation in
 Government reconstruction will not bring
 savage reprisals from the Vietcong will the
 farmers of South Vietnam and their families
 be able to join wholeheartedly in rebuilding
 their community life in peace.  Protection
 and progress must go hand in hand.    That
 will require a massive effort, in which the
 Saigon Government seems disposed to try to
 play a more effective role, with greater re-
 sources, than it was ever able to play before.

 Mr. BERRY.                                        Mr. Speaker, in this

 whom. he proposes to cut are the young-
 sters who are getting a warm school
 lunch at noon and who are getting a glass
 of milk.
 Of  all  the  worthwhile,  established
 programs, Mr. Speaker, the school lunch
 program is the best, and does the most
 good and, of course, this is a ripe plum
 to be picked by the welfare state in order
 that they may substitute some fancy
 newfangled political program, not with
 a view of aiding the poor, but with a view
 of aiding some poor politician who may
 get himself it real nice salary out of it.
 I have a letter from a superintendent
 of schools in my State who has described
 this cut in the school lunch program
 much more eloquently than I.
 The  letter  with the name and the
 school district stricken is as follows:
 On behalf of our school patrons and board
 of education l: am writing to ask that you
 use all of your influence to obtain reinstate-
 ment of the funds which have been taken
 from the school lunch program.
 This program has long since proven itself
 to be  highly worthwhile  and  valuable  to
 schools in South Dakota.  We have kept the
 costs to a remarkably low level of 25 cents
 per pupil in order to keep it within the
 reach of nearly all families.  For those who
 cannot afford even this low charge we glad-
 ly furnish lunches entirely free while still
 others are given some sort of minor work
 detail whereby they can earn their lunches.
 Surely no one can question the value of a
 hot lunch which supplies all the nutritional
 needs, to every child.
 We cannot possibly maintain this program
 without an increased charge or through gen-
 eral fund subsidy which would increase the
 school tax that is already at or near the legal
 limit in most of our schools.  If we increase
 the per pupil cost we will shut out some who
 cannot afford it and are too proud (thank
 God we still have some such)  to take  a
 "dole" or "handout."
 It was a nip-and-tuck battle to make ends
 meet at the 5 cents per meal and 4 cents
 per one-half pint of milk reimbursement
 plus the  commodities  which  we once re-
 ceived.                          With a cutback in the latter, from
 5 to 4 cents per meal and a 10-percent reduc-
 tion in the milk program we cannot continue
 the program without one or the other of the
 above-mentioned policies.
 Why have these cuts been made in the face
 of the liberal appropriation under 89-10 for
 title I and others?  How can one justify cut-
 ting back programs which are tried, tested,
 and proven valuable on the one hand and
 then turn around and offer the money for
 something new which must still be tested?
 I take the liberty of enclosing a bit of my
 own thinking on the whole Federal aid con-
 cept.  Frankly, I am sick to death of the
 "giveaway" program and scared to death of
 the controls which most assuredly will follow
 in due time. I don't care to hand my chil-
 dren and grandchildren an inheritance of
 Federal controls and socialism which seems
 to be the direction in which we are heading
 ,ill too fast.

 Mr. O'HARA of Illinois.  Mr. Speaker,
 with a warm appreciation of the good
 works of the League of United Latin
 American Citizens, popularly known as
 LULAC, I join in the laudatory com-
 ments of my colleague from Texas [Mr.
 WHITEI, in this Chamber on Thursday
 last, the 37th anniversary of the found-

 It has been my privilege and pleasure
 to participate with the members of the
 league in the patriotic observances that
 annually are a vibrant feature of the
 Fourth of July holiday in the district that
 I am honored to represent in this body.
 American citizens of Latin blood are a
 numerous and proud part of our com-

 fied place of eminence in all the activi-
 ties of our people.  The brilliant record
 of one of the leaders of LULAC, the Hon-

 National Security and the Merchant
 Marine
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JACK EDWARDS
 OF ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 21, 1966
 Mr.     EDWARDS  of  Alabama.  Mr.
 Speaker, an effective statement of what
 the U.S. merchant marine means to our
 national security was delivered recently
 by Capt. J. W. Clark, president of the
 Delta Steamship Lines, and chairman of
 the Committee of American Steamship
 Lines.
 Speaking on February 8, to the Mis-
 sissippi Valley Association here in Wash-
 ington, Captain Clark highlighted in ex-
 cellent fashion the need for action to
 bring our merchant shipping capability
 to the level required by the national
 security.
 His remarks serve to reinforce state-
 ments made by several members of the
 Merchant Marine and Fisheries Commit-
 tee of the House recently, including mine
 of February 113.
 I am inserting Captain Clark's state-
 ment in the Appendix of the RECORD:
 THE  AMERICAN  MERCHANT  MARINE'-  KEY  TO
 NATIONAL SECURITY
 (An address by Capt. J. W. Clark, president,
 Delta Steamship Lines, Inc. (New Orleans),
 (chairman, Committee of American Steam-
 ship                                                                    Lines),  Mississippi Valley  Associa-
 tion's 47th annual meeting, War?hington,
 D.C., February 8, 1966)
 American-flag shipping is a key to our na-
 tional security,                                                                   and our national security
 involves not only the defense aspect. but also
 the commercial aspect-the ability of our
 manufacturers to effectively compete in in-
 ternational commerce with foreign products.
 American-flag shipping is today, however,
 only a. "skeleton" key to national security
 (although we can still. open many foreign
 trade doors), and I say this because our
 maritime authorities have permitted this im-
 portant key to national security to be re-
 duced from its former proud position of first
 merchant fleet in the world to the status to-
 day of a poor sixth-we rank far behind Great
 Britain, Norway, Japan, Russia, and Liberia.
 Most of you, no doubt, are aware of the
 controversy  currently boiling  around pro-
 posals to revise our national maritime policies
 and  to  restructure  the  so-caned  subsidy
 programs.    On October 7, 1965, there was
 issued  a report entitled  the  "Interagency
 Maritime Task Force Report."  This is fre-
 quently referred to as the "Boyd report," after
 my fellow panelist, Under Secretary of Com-
 merce for Transportation, Alan S. Boyd.  The
 interagency report was followed promptly by
 a report prepared by the President's Maritime
 Advisory Committee.  The interagency report
 was prepared by Government personnel: the
 principal architects were the Maritime Ad-
 ministrator and his planning staff.
 Maritime Administrator Nicholas Johnson
 is a brilliant young law professor, with con-
 siderable charm, who has the oratorical de-
 livery to sway almost any lay audience to his
 point of view--and in this case his selected
 mission has been to "sell" the interagency
 report.
 The MAC report was prepared by profes-
 sionals, drawing heavily on the maritime in-
 dustry for advice, including shipowners, mari-
 time labor, and shipbuilders.
 Secretary of Commerce  Connor  publicly
 stated on January 25, that "if the Govern-
 ment had been fulfilling its obligations to-
 ward building up the merchant marine over
 the years, the balance-of-payments problem
 would be resolved because there would be
 adequate  American-flag  tonnage  to  haul
 American  commerce."     Secretary  Connor
 serves as chairman of the President's Mari-
 time Advisory Committee, and has been it
 consistent supporter of American-flag ship-
 ping.
 Under Secretary Boyd, on the other hand,
 in a recent article in the U.S. News & World
 Report, stated that only intuition causes him
 to feel that we need an American merchant
 marine.  He further stated that ships built
 today in foreign shipyards cannot be regis-
 tered under the American flag.  This is not
 so;  they can be "imported"-and without
 duty.   'there are practical problems which
 discourage such practices.  Under Secretary
 Boyd has also made the statement that the
 only valid reason for financial assistance to
 American-flag ships is for reasons related to
 national defense.
 In all fairness to Mr. Boyd, I must say that
 we suspect that the interagency report was
 probably completed before he assumed his
 present position of responsibility.  In assem-
 bling the information presented in the con-
 troversial  interagency  report,  the  MARAD-
 planning group conferred with Government
 experts in various departments and agencies
 Professional shipping men view these largely
 theoretical recommendations of these experts,
 as impracticable, and we draw the conclusion
 that this is primarily due to lack of experi-
 ence and practical knowledge.
 Thinking of these "experts," I am reminded
 of the story about the fellow who was appear-
 ing on the television show,  $64,000  Ques-
 tion."
 After going through all of the preliminary
 questions and reaching the final $64,000 ques-
 tion, the gentleman was advised that he could
 have the services of an expert to assist him
 with the final question.  As the question in-
 volved was one with three parts, dealing with.
 the subject of love, our friend thought long
 and hard and finally decided that he would
 obtain the  services  of  a  Frenchman  well
 known for his romantic expertise.  Came the
 big night and our contestant faced the master
 of ceremonies.   The first part of the question
 was given to him as, "if you were walking in a
 forest and came up a clearing, and you saw it
 beautiful chalet in a most romantic setting,
 and a lovely, blossomy young lady appeared
 in the doorway, completely in the nude, what
 would you do?"   Our friend, without any
 hesitation whatsoever, promptly responded,

 As to the importance of merchant shipping
 to    our national  security,  several eminent
 naval officers in recent months have spoken
 out in favor of the tremendous contributions
 of the American merchant marine to the de-
 fense effort in Vietnam, and to the outstand-
 ing qualities of our modern vessels which
 participated in the "steel pike" landing exer-
 cises off the Spanish coast.
 Let us, for a moment, reflect on World War
 II and the fleet of American-flag merchant
 ships which supplied the logistical support
 for our major campaigns in Europe and in
 the Pacific areas.
 American-flag ships played a major role in
 the Korean conflict and, as usual, the mer-
 chant marine is heavily involved in the Viet-
 nam conflict.  It is disturbing to note the
 lack of cooperation received from our NATO
 allies in the Vietnam war and, just as in the
 case of Cuba many of our fair-weather friends
 are serving Communist masters contrary to
 U.S. interests.  On checking through recent
 issues of Lloyd's  "Shipping Index Voyage
 Supplement;" I learned that ships flying the
 flags of Great Britain, Norway, Greece, and
 other European countries have been calling
 at Haiphong and at Chinese and Russian
 ports.  A typical example of one of these voy-
 ages involves the Norwegian ship Herborg, as
 listed in the January 21, 1966, Issue of Lloyds.
 $2 billion-paid for by the Department o
 Defense-and predictions have been made
 that this 360-top flying "Holland Tunnel"
 will promote a tremendous increase in future
 air-cargo services.   Strangely enough,  the
 principal commercial airlines of the United
 States who are usually the beneficiaries of
 heavy subsidization in plane design and de-
 velopment through Defense Department con-
 tracts, are reported to be lukewarm on the
 project.  The C5-A could be another "Great
 Republic"-the oversized and ill-fated clipper
 ship of a century ago.  According to a No-
 vember article in Fortune magazine, the C5-A
 "will liberate the Army from dependence on
 sea transportation except for low cost bulk
 items such as fuel."  There are certain prac-
 ticable  considerations                                                                                  which  immediately
 come to my mind.      In the first place, these
 planes are expected to land on relatively
 short runways in remote areas under adverse
 circumstances, and such runways are subject
 to damage or destruction by enemy action.
 These planes would also make a nice fat
 target for enemy aircraft and missiles.  By
 comparison,  seaborne  transports   provide
 highly flexible logistical support-with naval
 support-ships can be moved from one port
 to another and are not necessarily dependent
 on fixed facilities for delivery of war material.
 As troop carriers, giant planes such as the
 C5-A could carry 600 to 700 fully equipped

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN J. RHODES
 OF ARIZONA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 21, 1966
 Mr. RHODES of Arizona.  Mr. Speak-
 er, William R. Mathews, editor and pub-
 lisher of the Arizona Daily Star, of
 Tucson, has traveled widely in the Far
 East. He has studied its people, its gov-
 ernments, and has well-formed ideas
 concerning the appropriateness. of our
 actions in that part of the world.
 In the Arizona Daily Star, of Janu-
 ary 30, 1966, Mr. Mathews published an
 editorial which is so well considered that
 I am sure it should be read by every
 Member of the House and Senate.
 The editorial follows:
 MAKE THE BEST OF A TRAGIC MESS
 (By William R. Mathews)
 Rather than shed more tears about the
 President and Vietnam, the time has come
 when our Nation should unite to make the
 best of what unmistakably is a tragic mess.
 The President's peace campaign, unreal-
 istic as it has proven to be in bettering things
 in Vietnam, has produced the positive results
 of improving the  image of the President
 throughout the world, as well as at home.
 It'has damaged seriously the image of the
 Peiping Communists and North Vietnam by
 making themselves appear to be rigidly un-
 reasonable.  Johnson has neutralized those
 wso posed as negotiators, conferencemakers,
 peacemakers, and so on by seriously trying to
 do what they pleaded he do.
 The  uncompro:aising attitude of  North
 Vietnam leaves no other alternative than to
 wage war in traditional American manner.
 That it amounts to sheer stupidity on the
 part  of  North  Vietnam,  becomes   more
 apparent.
 If, for instance, North Vietnam had re-
 sponded to the President's pleas, it could
 have caught him out on a limb.  He prom-
 ised over and over again unconditional sur-
 render.  Yet when he was pinned down by his
 fellow countrymen and others, he insisted on

 "I would say 'hello.'" The master of cere-
 monies said, "You're absolutely right."  The
 second part of the question was, "and then
 what would you do?" Our lad, again without
 hesitation, answered, "I would introduce my-
 a,e1J'."  "Absolutely right," said the questioner.
 Then he went up to say that in view of the
 :ritical importance of the final part of the
 question, the contestant should think long
 and hard: and should seriously consider seek-
 the advice of his "expert" before answer-
 ingg.  The last pairs of the question for $64,000
 ,vas--"and then what would you do?"  So,
 our contestant, realizing the situation, con-
 ierred with his noted adviser.
 The Frenchman, with face somewhat red,
 :idvised: "You har.f better answer for yourself,
 f. was wrong on the first two questions."
 I would like to make it clear that I cer-
 1..i.inly mean no d.urespect to Under Secretary
 of Commerce Boyd, or to his expert advisers,
 Cut  at the same time I cannot agree that
 they have been right about even the first two
 questions concerning the maritime industry.
 .lrrreric:in-flag Hripping contributes almost
 :l billion yearly to our balance of payments.
 idur Casa Lines alone contribute in excess of
 500 million a ye:;r in favorable payments.

 s     extensive  trade  promotional  activities,

 fly comparison, we regret to say that the
 i`da>ritinne Administration, which is charged
 necificaliy by the Merchant Marine Act of
 i93fr to promote the foreign commerce of the
 ifni.ted States and the American Merchant
 1.1nritie, has publicly displayed little interest
 iii this mandate of Congress.  To the con-
 hairy, the public statements of the Maritime
 Administrator,  however  well  intentioned,
 have resulted in considerable confusion not
 only  among  indnsi,ry  members,  but  also
 truing international traders and the public.
 ft    has  been .llcn.ed that American-flag
 :.tripping is excesa;ively subsidized, and that

 ^All of this simply is not true, and I only
 wish that. I could take enough of your time
 o rcluto each and every criticism of Ameri-

 L'ut, briefly, let me answer loud and clear
 a.  few of these inferences.
 Liu-A, Americanflag shipowners do not re-
 "eive One penny of subsidy.  Costs ashore,
 arch  its  overhead  (including my  salary),
 rr;o-lion dling expenses, and the vast mill it-

 equipment, in the 'United States.  These ex-
 penditures, along with the salaries paid to
 our American citizen employees, constitute it
 major contribution to the Nation's economy
 and security.
 Conversely, when foreign-flag shippi,+III is
 used, 73 cents of every freight revenue dol-
 lar is taken away from the United States.
 It night interest you to know that we re-
 cently made a study of the purch.asinrr: and
 repair practices of one of our Scandinavian
 competitors.  We found that this line regu-
 larly obtains the greater part of its sul plies
 from .foreign sources, even foodstuffs.  When
 m:r.jurr repairs and drydocking are required,
 tic r shins are gent back to Europe on a voy-

 wages are sent back to the old country isr the
 form of family allotments.           In other words,
 these people spud as little dollar exchange
 in this country as they possibly can, and
 drain away "Invisible" payments idoller ex-

 which are now being copied by our for.eign-

 with negligible Government assistance.      We
 have used our own money in the dev.alop-

 has the Maritime Adminisstrtion dome to
 help technological development?      As 1 un-
 derstand it, the Maritime Administrai join's
 Ural red research and development funds have
 grate principally into the Savannah program,
 initiated  10  years  ago,  but  a substantial
 amount has gone into such exotic dev -'.op-
 ments as the hydrofoil and air-cushion ves-
 sel projects, which primarily involve :.mall
 craft and are related to national defer :e or
 short-range    passenger    transportation    I
 personally know of no sirngle major pr:;ect
 involving: large ocean-going vessels to which
 the  present   Maritime     Administration  has
 made any significant contribution.
 c. lei  rresLRENCFI
 F ur year's our foreign-flag competitors have
 cl ai,ored long :and loud in protest against
 our cargo preference laws wbic.e require that
 50 percent of all Government aid or Go,, c ru-
 mcist financed  cargoes  be  transported  by
 Air.crican-flag vessels. The in.teragenc~' re-
 port recommends elimination of these cargo
 proferersce statutes, and it does so wil.h a
 very naive approach. I was amazed to .earn
 that few of our high Government oll.cials
 realize that there are two considerations, a.f-
 fct:ting cargo preference--(1)  routing (u'ef-
 crance and (2) rate preference.   The irrter-
 agcricy report eecornmendation that cargo
 preference ba eliminated is confusing and
 is based on the false philosophy that el,ini-
 nation oil cargo preference and payment of
 "ic.centhe"  subsidy  would  enable a  row
 bulk  carrier fleet to successfully con Pete
 with foreign flag competition. This is ab-
 surd.                                                                           There is no objection to the phr.nng
 our, of *'rate" di:lferentials as new bulk :ear-
 rrr                                                                   ; are placed in operation,  ,ut it is . !)so-
 lutely imperative that preferential "routing"
 be retained or there will be little opport: City
 for the tr-?naportation of any bulk U.S  aid
 eaesyues.  It is a well-knovr_r fact that foreign
 go-c'nmeat: ',i' 1 divert aid cargoes to ..lair
 nw'a vessels for 'political" r. axons.  Fun, tier,
 the trade rn swan. and foreign freight l,rok-
 eri appointed by foreign Government ; to
 handle these sh;pmer_ts are highly susc,alrti-
 ble to nationalistic control.  With bulk im-
 ports large 1 r dint't 'rolled by industrial e' oats
 who favor their own "flags of con .venie.rrae"
 fleets, and. the complete lack of any a,cur-
 ances   that   American-flag     hulk  carriers
 would participrai,e in U.S. aid cargoes, it can
 hardly be  expected  that  amt responsible
 owner will venture the necessary risk cal-;ital.
 The proposed elimination of cargo rA?ef-
 erence, including PR 17, would leave us to
 the tender mercies of foreign Governments
 and there would remain no effective instru-
 ment for leverage in assuring fair and equi-
 table treatment for U.S.-flag vessels.  There
 is ample evidence that the elimination of
 many discriminations against U.S.-flag ves-
 sels has  only been accomplished through
 cargo preference leverage.  To the contrery,
 the routing aspects of cargo preference leg-
 islation should be made more effective.
 If U.S.-flag vessels do not carry such car-
 goes then obviously they will be carried by
 foreign-flag vessels to the detriment of the
 U.S.  economy through adverse balance of
 payments and national income.
 Our cargo preference laws and mar it tree
 policies have been adequately defended in
 the past by the U.S. Government.  The de-
 fense of our present statutes is a matter of
 international record.
 There  is  a  further  misconception  that
 cargo preferences result in higher freight
 rates. This is basically incorrect with re-
 gard to all cargoes which move in the liner
 trades. Freight conference rules and rates
 apply equally to American- and foreign-flag
 vessels, and freight conferences are strictly
 controlled  by  the  U.S.  Federal  Maritime
 Commission.
 As to the proposed Russian grain doil,
 there is no assurance that Russia or any of
 the Communist satellite countries would reg-
 ularly  purchase  large  quantities                                                                                                                                  of  U.S.
 ,wheat when and if the Government restric-
 tion imposed for the use of American-flag
 vessels is eliminated.  It is my opinion that
 Russia has seized upon the 50 percent shin
 American policy as a propaganda tool to stir
 up further trouble with our NATO allies.  It
 should  be  recalled  that  several  of these
 European countries, notably Germany, have
 recently protested against the aggressive use
 of Russian-controlled vessels to break pre-
 vailing freight rate structures.
 Russia is building up a large merchant
 marine aml, by her own admission, intcrnls
 to utilize her shipping as an instrument of
 foreign policy without regard to cost.  If the
 Russian  objective  is achieved in building
 up a huge merchant marine and utilising
 same  to force    down  international  freight
 rates, the maritime nations  of the world
 would soon find their respective fleets with-
 out cargoes and facing virtual bankruptcy.
 Therefore,  only  through  an effective    and
 active U S. merchant marine, operating with
 minimum Government  restraint, yet with
 adequate C:overnment protection in the di-
 rection of cargo routing, and with Govern-
 ment backing to eliminate foreign govern-
 ment discriminations, can we avoid. put!.uug
 ourselves completely at the mercy of Corn-
 munist-dominated shipping.
 In view of the affinity of our NATO ::ales
 to serve the Communist trades in Cuba, the
 Middle East, Communist China, North Viet-
 ram and Russia itself, it follows that In con-
 sideration of charters and the concession of
 participation of Communist trades, foreign-
 flag shipping could be influenced to assist
 the Communist program to dominate Amer-
 ican foreign trade.
 DO".LARS AND CENTS ECONOMY
 As  to  commercial  justification  for  sire
 American merchant marine, the adrnieistr:s-
 tion will undoubtedly be greatly irifluer'eed
 by the dollars-and-cents costs of Arne  ea.ar-
 flag shipping operations.  While we drti l 'se
 with many of the interagency projectii  :s,  I
 would like to spotlight one glaring ques" ion
 mark on the part of the people who pre-
 pared the interagency report.
 The proieste.d hcigh savings frequently r.-
 fered to by interagency report advocate:  i?
 highly questionable.  This is largely
 on a projected increase in Government 'tid
 cargoes and a doubling of the rate differa'n-
 tials,  amounting  to                                                                                                                                  a  projected savior;s

 they would have driven him into a corner.
 But such an attitude on the Communists'
 part seemed to defy the centuries-old tradi-
 tion of the Chinese and most Orientals, to
 take their time and make haste slowly.
 Time would have been on their side, if they
 had restrained the Vietcong and themselves
 to the point that would have made American
 military forces no longer necessary.  Within
 a few years the odds would be greatly on
 their side.  In a few years they could win by
 subversion, which would have allowed them
 to make communism appear to be a peaceful
 political philosophy.
 That they abandoned their basic political
 philosophy of confidence in time, apparently
 has  been  caused  by  the  corrupting  of
 Marxism of the West, which calls for glorify-
 ing violence and actual war.
 The world, not just America, should take
 note of this change.  It confirms how un-
 compromising and unreasonable Communists
 are.   It confirms  how undependable their
 word is.  Their violation of their own pro-
 posed cease-fire amounted only to a trap to
 bring in more supplies and regroup their
 forces.  That Lenin himself made a peace in
 1918 with Germany, in order to give time to
 consolidate the Russian  revolution,  these
 oriental Communists seem to forget.
 As to the role of China, it appears more
 and more as a great big bluff.  It is worth
 noting how she withdrew from her invasion
 of India,  when  India showed   her will to
 fight.  We have to do the same thing.  If
 President Johnson limits the bombing of
 targets in North Vietnam, we are confessing
 our fear of China.  If the President extends
 bombing to strategic targets like electric gen-
 erating plants, oil storage tanks, and various
 industrial complexes, we are definitely calling
 the Chinese bluff.  We will be shortening the
 war, not prolonging it.  Of course, tactical
 bombing against railroads, bridges, and other
 military targets must continue with an in-
 creased tempo.
 China does have vast manpower, but she
 can supply North Vietnam, and the Vietcong,
 with only a part of the weapons they use.
 The latter have  to  depend upon supplies
 from Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.
 At the present time, China has only a few
 atomic bombs.   If she dares make use of
 them, we must retaliate until we break her
 power to make nuclear and other weapons.
 It is hard to believe that China would run
 the risk of being completely destroyed now,
 when she knows that by keeping at peace she
 will grow stronger daily and yearly.  She will
 keep on bluffing as long as we evade calling
 her bluff by strategic bombing in North Viet-
 nam.

 I'd snare me a sunbeam and fasten it tight
 In the threads of the silken band;
 And I'd weave a legend for all to read-
 Georgia, by cherished land I
 CHORUS
 I'm weaving a song of Georgia land-
 The land that I adore;
 Her smiles and tears throughout the years
 Make rainbows evermore.
 My shuttle hums a merry tune
 As heart and loom combine
 To weave a prayer of thankfulness
 That Georgia land is mine.

 I'd catch the spark of a baby's smile;
 The joy of a love devine;
 The rippling sound of a singing brook;
 The scent of a jasmine vine.
 I'd match the carmine of the soil
 With the blue of a distant hill;
 I'd capture a wild bird's melody,
 And the sing of the whippoorwill.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 21, 1966
 Mr. DERWINSKI.  Mr. Speaker, one
 of the latest developments in the mass
 confusion over our foreign policy is the
 dangerous advice being given by the rad-
 ical left Members of the U.S. Senate.
 The Chicago Tribune commented edi-
 torially on this situation in this morn-
 ing's issue, and I am inserting their edi-
 torial in the RECORD:
 Ho CHI KENNEDY
 Senator BOBBY KENNEDY has reached a level
 of irresponsibility without parallel even for
 him in suggesting that the way out of the
 war in Vietnam is for the United States to
 accept a coalition government in South Viet-
 nam  which  would  admit  the  Communist
 Vietcong as a ruling element.
 Mr. KENNEDY could only advance an idea
 of this sort if he was entirely ignorant of
 history and experience.  We conclude that
 he is utterly deficient in both.
 The record of coalitions with communism
 demonstrates that any coalescence of this
 sort leads inevitably to a surrender to com-
 munism.   Czechoslovakia, after World War
 II, tried the experiment.  It led to a com-
 plete Communist takeover.
 Gen. George C. Marshall was dispatched to
 China after the end of the same war with
 instructions written  by State Department
 appeasers to force the Nationalist China of
 Chiang Kai-shek into a coalition with the
 Communists who had been fighting his gov-
 ernment for 20 years.                                                                            When Chiang refused
 this suicidal deal, the United States cut off
 all supplies to his forces for a year and a half.
 Meanwhile,  the  Communists,  armed  with
 weapons   taken  from the  Japanese  army
 which had surrendered to the Russian Com-
 munist forces in Manchuria, were gathering
 the strength to conquer the country, as they
 did.
 Most recently the coalition formula was
 invoked in Laos, which, like Vietnam, is a
 splinter state out of the former French pos-
 session of Indochina.  In that country an
 uneasy combination was attempted among
 disparate elements of the pro-Western and
 anti-Communist monarchy, a neutralist ele-
 ment of the military, and the Communist
 Pathet  Lao.  The  Comunists  have  taken
 over great areas of the country and intend
 to take it all.  The idea that such antago-
 nistic forces will or can cooperate is a myth-
 the myth promulgated by the Kremlin that
 "peaceful coexistence" is a means of recon-
 ciling sheep and wolves.
 Mr. KENNEDY might be dismissed as the
 demagog that he is If he were ignorant of
 this' history, but he may not be excused for
 his ignorance of the origins of the war in
 South Vietnam.  If he had read the state-
 ment of Secretary of State Dean Rusk last
 Friday, he would know that the Communist
 Vietcong, and its political sponsor, the so-
 called National Liberation Front,  are not
 indigenous elements of a civil war in South
 Vietnam, but are the deliberately contrived
 "fronts" of the Communist government of
 North Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh.
 The third conference of the North Viet-
 namese Communist party in Hanoi decreed,
 in  1901,  that South  Vietnam  was  to  be
 abolished as an Independent state and ren-
 dered subject to the Communists.                                                                                                                                     For this
 purpose, a dummy political arm, designated
 as the National Liberation Front, was estab-
 lished as a pretender to authority in opposi-
 tion to the noncommunist regime in Saigon.
 The Vietcong became the mjlitary extension
 of this invented political cat's-paw of Hanoi.
 It has no more standing as an authentic
 element in the political or social organiza-
 tion of South Vietnam than the Hebrides
 Islands in relation to the United States.
 Senator  KENNEDY,  out of  his  ignorance
 and political ambition, has compromised his
 loyalty to the United States when it is at
 war by subscribing to Communist myths and
 adopting them as his own, in opposition to a
 national policy, which is supported by an
 overwhelming majority of American citizens.
 He is not the junior Senator from New York.
 He is the senior senator from Communist
 North Vietnam--Ho Chi Minh's Trojan horse
 in the U.S. Senate.

 EXTENSION OF REMAi'1KS
 OF
 HON. DEL CLAWSON
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESEN'TATIVES
 Monday, February 21, PAX
 Mr. DEL CLAWSON.  Mn Speaker,
 a singular honor has come to a section
 of miy constituency, the city of Compton,
 Calif., and I am pleased to .hare the
 recognition with my colleague,,.
 In. a way, this honor synthesizes a
 number of interrelated issues which
 have had our attention for a i Ong time.
 We speak of poverty, of racial tensions,
 of law  violation.   There  is  general
 agreement that the heart of the matter
 is education and  understanding-and
 the heart of education, we have been
 told many times, is "money"-as if
 "money" alone could buy the skill to
 inspire children to learn, prevent drop-
 outs, and give to a community ii deep and
 penetrating interest in raising, the edu-
 cational level of its citizens.
 Ti'hhe fullest measure of money means
 little without the zeal to do, the imagina-
 tion to conceive, the willingness to dare,
 and genuine dedications to a cause.
 In this city of Compton, there are peo-
 ple with all these qualities-and their
 dedication  is  to  education-although
 their wealth is modest.  These are the
 people who administer its school sys-
 tem under the able leadership of Mr.
 Leonard C. Erickson, superintndent of
 the Compton city schools.
 More  than  17,000  pupils  crowd its
 classes. We are advised the cc,t of edu-
 cating each student is the lov est in all
 of Los Angeles  County-and  under-
 standably so-as Comoton is a. city with
 a number of poverty areas-and no Fed-
 eral funds are allocated for building new
 sel loot structures.
 Yet; this community voted is increase
 its property tax, to increase it so that
 new schools could be built.  'i he entire
 community voted this sacrifice.  An en-
 tire multiracial  community                                                                      'voting  in
 favor of the future.
 This, however, is not unusual
 It was decided to build the first of
 these schools in the area of the city where
 the need was the greatest.  This, too, is
 not unusual.
 But rather than merely decide to build
 a school that would house a specific num-
 ber of pupils, the goal was more ambi-
 tious.  It was decided to build a school
 that would be beautiful, one in which
 the community would take pride, one
 that would provide a welcome atmos-
 phere, one that the people would cherish,
 one that would  motivate students  to
 learn, an oasis of knowledge-a center of
 learning worthy of any city-anywhere.
 And all this they hoped to achieve on
 the slimmest of budgets.
 Long,  tedious hours  went  into the
 search for the answers. It would have
 been easy to merely press a button or
 two and have a school much like all other
 schools-and no one would complain, for
 they would be getting what they would
 naturally expect.
 But the city of Compton can be proud.
 This school., designed by the architectural
 firm of Carmichael-Kemp, ALA, to be
 built in a section designated by Los An-
 geles County as a hard-core poverty
 area, has just received a national award
 for its  excellence  in architecture--its
 beauty, its warmth, its color--and its
 functional use in education, from the
 American Association of School Admin-
 istrators' Architectural Jury of the Na-
 tional Education Association.  This ar-
 chitectural jury is composed of three of
 the Nation's leading architects selected
 by the American Institute of Architects,
 and three of the Nation's most eminent
 educators.
 This is no small school. It is 2 stories
 with more than 30 classrooms, and gen-
 tlemen, the cost of building this school
 will be well within the budget set; by
 the State of California as the average
 cost for similar size structures.  It is fit-
 ting, too, that this institution of learn-
 ing will be named the Clarence A. Dicki-
 son Elementary School, honoring a pio-
 neer of the city of Compton, who was
 not only its first mayor, but who also
 made his contribution to education as a
 teacher, vice principal, principal, and a
 member and president of the Compton
 City Elementary School Board.
 And as if Compton needed  further
 honor, the California State Department
 of Schoolhouse Planning is considering
 using this award-winning school for a
 pilot study relative to the savings effected
 by its type of structure in heavily popu-
 lated areas.
 This coveted award, naturally, means
 a great deal to Mr. Erickson, the Board
 of Education and to the architects, D.a Z
 Carmichael and Dick Kemp, but it means
 immeasurably more to the people of the
 area.  A school worthy of the wealthiest
 city anywhere is theirs.

 pie of the State of Hawaii and the cit-
 izens of the city of Bruyeres in far-off
 France. Perhaps some of my colleagues
 will recall that Bruyeres is one of the
 French towns which were liberated by
 the men of Hawaii's 442d Infantry Regi-
 ment and the 100th Infantry Battalion
 in World War H. Having been a mem-
 ber of the 1030th Infantry Battalion, I
 am greatly pleased that out of the fierce
 struggle for Bruyeres among the forested
 foothills of the Vosges Mountains has
 come about a lasting friendship between
 two peoples.  Many of our brave fighting
 men were felled in Bruyeres, and they too
 would rejoice that they did not die in
 vain.
 Although the relationship between the
 people of Hawaii and the citizens of
 Bruyeres had a dramatic beginning.  I
 am sure that "Bruyeres" would today be
 a mere memory of a battle, had it not
 been for dedicated individuals who have
 devoted much time and effort in the in-
 tervening years to keep this friendship
 alive.  I stand before you today to pay
 tribute to a man who has done so much
 to foster this friendship. He is a French
 citizen and a councilman in the city of
 Bruyeres M. Gerard Deschaseaux.
 The unselfish devotion of Councilman
 Deschaseaux has been movingly re-
 counted in a recent letter I received from
 Mr. Wilbert S. Holck, deputy clerk of
 the city and county of Honolulu.  As one
 who also has been instrumental in pro-
 moting this friendship and the sister city
 affiliation between Honolulu and Bru-
 yeres, Mr. Holck points out that the
 Hawaii State Senate and House jointly,
 the City Council of Honolulu, and the
 442d  and  100th  Infantry  Clubs  in
 Hawaii intend to pay tribute to Council-
 man Deschaseaux.
 Mr. Speaker, at this point I am Insert-
 ing in the RECORD the inspiring story of
 Mr. Deschaseaux's accomplishments as
 related by Mr. Holck:
 "Councilman Deschaseaux is one of the
 many who are instrumental in creating the
 congenial pro-American attitude among the
 citizens of France, particularly within the
 Vosges area.  His newspaper articles describ-
 ing our citizens  of  the mainland United
 States and Hawaii during a visit in 1963 was
 most revealing. His articles provided the
 French citizens with a most intimate under-
 standing of the people of our Nation.
 He has established close contact with the
 U.S. officials in the people-to-people program.
 Today there are three cities in France par-
 ticipating and cooperating with the United
 States people-to-people program.  These are
 Marseille, Strasbourg, and Bruyeres.  Indi-
 viduals in charge in each of the three cities
 arrange for our young U.S. students to live in
 the privates homes of their cities for a few
 days.  Mr. Deschaseaux, who is responsible
 for Bruyeres, also takes in two U.S. students
 each year.
 In addition to the above, Mr. Deschaseaux
 has been unselfish in giving his time, energy,
 and money in providing for visitors from
 Hawaii.  He personally entertains all Hawai-
 ians and arranges for all 442d and 100th
 veterans to tour former battle areas and meet
 old wartime friends.  Any Hawaiian visiting
 Bruyeres is immeditaely made to feel at home
 by many citizens of that town until Mr.
 Deschaseaux arrives to take over.  Hawaiian
 servicemen and women and their families in
 Europe are welcomed by the people there
 because of Mr. Deschaseaux's untiring efforts
 to maintain good will and his sincere beliefs
 in the Honolulu, Hawaii-Bruyeres, France sis-
 ter city relations.
 The people of Bruyeres honor the men of
 the 100th and 442d Infantry killed in the
 battle to liberate their town on the third
 Sunday of every October.  Since October of
 1961 they also celebrate the anniversary of
 their sister city affiliation with Honolulu,
 Hawaii.  The celebrations really commence
 on the day before and terminate on the eve-
 ning of the third Sunday.                                                                                    Mr. Deschaseaux,
 being the chairman of the Bruyeres, France-
 Honolulu,  Hawaii,  sister                                                                                        city   committee
 of Bruyeres, is also program chairman.  He
 arranges for hotel and private home accom-
 modations for all visitors                                                                                        (primarily from
 Hawaii)  and coordinates  the  celebration
 activities.
 Since 1961 Mr. Deschaseaux has made ar-
 rangements for all students of Bruyeres to
 have a pen pal in Hawaii.  This pen pal asso-
 elation  continues till this day with high
 school students from Farrington Castle, and
 the Catholic schools.  His goal is to educate
 the young people of France and other nations
 through correspondence so that better under-
 standing and good will can be developed.  He
 long-range plan is to have an exchange of
 young students such as that undertaken in
 the U.S. people-to-people program.
 Mr. Deschaseaux is of high moral char-
 acter and a well-respected man in the Vosges
 area. Although he could be elected in higher
 political offices, he has refused only because
 of devotion to his ocupation.  He is an engi-
 neer of natural resources  (forestry, water,
 and game) in the Vosges area.
 Mr. Speaker, the world would be a
 much better place in which to live if we
 had more men like M. Gerard Deschase-
 aux, I take great pleasure and deem it
 an   nor to pay tribute to this great
 F,ra i hman and world citizen.
 L.B.J.'s Big Week Left the World Gasping
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RICHARD BOLLING
 OF MISSOURI
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 21, 1966
 Mr. BOLLING.                                                     Mr. Speaker, Presi-
 dent Johnson's untiring efforts to make
 this a world of stability and peace were
 hailed by the Kansas City Times, which
 noted that he "made the 7 days of Feb-
 ruary 6-12, 1966, a, week to remember.
 The President was positively dazzling in
 the pace and breadth of his personal per-
 formance."
 The paper noted that in Honolulu:
 The military campaign was played down.
 The greater emphasis was on the struggle
 against poverty,  disease, and  illiteracy in
 South  Vietnam.   The  Saigon  government
 was represented as pushing social-economic
 betterment programs with the enthusiastic
 support of the Johnson administration.
 As a summary of efforts to attain peace
 the "big week" as reviewed by the Times
 is noteworthy, and I am including it in
 the RECORD:
 L.B.J.'s BIG WEEK LEFT THE WORLD GASPING
 Lyndon B. Johnson made the 7 days of
 February 6-12, 1966, a week to remember.
 The President was positively dazzling in the
 pace and breadth of his personal perform-
 ance.
 On very short notice he flew into Hono-
 lulu for a whirlwind conference that re-
 focused the picture of the U.S. efforts in
 Vietnam.  The military campaign was played
 down.  The greater emphasis was on the
 struggle against poverty, disease, and illit-
 eracy in South Vietnam.  The Saigon gov-
 ernment was represented as pushing social-
 economic                                                                                                                                         betterment         programs  with  the
 enthusiastic support  of  the Johnson ad-
 ministration.
 The Johnson style  demands more than
 words, however. The President summoned
 Vice President HUBERT HUMPHREY    to meet
 him at the Los Angeles airport for a run-
 down on the Honolulu  conference.  Then
 Mr. HUMPHREY was whisked off across the
 Pacific  to dramatize the administration's
 peaceful  intentions  in Vietnam. Orville
 Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture, was
 also dispatched to Vietnam on a food-coun-
 seling and inspection trip that had been
 scheduled earlier but fitted perfectly into
 the Johnsonian timetable.
 Upon returning to Washington, President
 Johnson scarcely paused before sending Con-
 gress a message outlining a 5-year American
 food-for-freedom program, with the promise
 of expanded foreign food assistance based on
 a requirement that hungry areas help them-
 selves.
 Late Friday President Johnson called a
 press  conference  to  discuss,  anl.ong  other
 matters, the U.S. military operations in Viet-
 nam.                                                                                                                                             He placed his own interpretation on
 the  Senate   Foreign  Relations      Committee
 hearings, which some people thought the
 President wanted to consign to the shadows
 by the drama of his newsmaking trip to
 Hawaii.  Mr. Johnson commented that the
 two chief witnesses, retired Army Gen. James
 Gavin, and George Kennan, a former diplo-
 mat, both said that they did not want "to
 escalate or get out" and "that's how we feel."
 But he also said that American troops would
 be sent to Vietnam as needed by the field
 commanders.
 Still full of spizzerinctum, Mr. Johnson
 announced that he has picked a new man to
 be his press secretary, a new Chairman of
 the Federal Power Commission, and a new
 Comptroller General-all highly important
 posts.
 The average American must have felt, worn
 out from just trying to keep up with Presi-
 dent Johnson's performance last week.  As
 for L.B.J. himself, he gave the impression
 of not even being winded. Nevertheless,
 even for him, this man of such amazing
 energy and inventiveness surely made it a
 memorable 7 days.

 asking: Why has nothing thus far been
 done about prosecuting these characters?
 The editorial follows:
 JUSTICE  lUN  TRIAL
 ,I'.icre must be no jusLice, in the minds of
 Noise two UI's who sold their uniforms to
 some East Germans woo wanted to go over
 the wall.  The Army has scheduled a court-
 martial where the two could draw as much
 as 2 years and 4 months in jail and dishon-
 orable discharges.
 1ne soldiers broke the law.  So did the
 three East Germans a'ho bought and wore
 urilorms against Western Allied regulations.
 11111 what of some other recent lawbreaking
 incidents?
 f.t,eniember those three "factfinders" who
 dropped in on North Vietnam not long ago?
 Well, they're back home now.  One, a pro-
 Leass)r, has been all over the newspapers and
 television with his inside tips on how to get
 out, of Vietnam: Give up and throw ourselves
 on the mercy of the Communists.
 The  "factfinders"  have  Communist and
 other leftist affiliations that fill several type-
 written pages.             They blatantly defied a State
 Department ban on travel to North Vietnam
 a.nd are subject to 5-year prison sentences
 :anti lines of up to $5000. So far, no prose-
 cution or reprimand.
 And what of the 't'ransit Workers Union
 which violated two State laws with an illegal
 striae that cost New York City at least a bil-
 lion  dollars?   The  charges  were  dropped
 when the strike was settled, and the law-
 breakers, instead of drawing stiff fines, got
 fat pay raises.
 Yet the Army is preparing to punish two
 young men for helping a small group of
 Communist captives flee to freedom.  Is it
 justice?
 The answer lies in the Western concept of
 law and order.  Under our system, laws are
 trade to be enforced, and agencies are set
 up to handle enforcement.  Police depart-
 ments fall into this category, and so, in a
 larger sense, do the Armed Forces.
 Law enforcement should begin with those
 who enforce the law.  Thus it is that police-
 men  are  suspended            and soldiers  court-
 niactialed for breaking laws and regulations.
 Itecause enforcers of the law should set
 an impeccable example of law and order, the
 Army's course of action is just.  Hopefully it
 win: be contagious.
 HON. ROBERT H. MICHEL
 OF III,INOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, February 21, 1966
 Mr.   MICHEL.   Mr.  Speaker,  under
 unanimous consent, I wish to include the
 following editorial from the February 9,
 1966, issue of the Peoria Journal Star:
 AN IN'rERESTINC UNION  PROPOSAL
 A group of Peoria in!un chiefs are spear-
 heading a plan which, if the details can be
 ironed out, looks like one of the most pro-
 r*rrssive programs to come down the road in
 Iang time.
 It is a bold, imaginative, pioneering effort
 that might make central Illinois a national
 model for peace in the construction indus-
 try-a condition that should do a great deal
 to further stimulate economic development
 here and make construction work plentiful.
 The idea is simple.  The details are terribly
 complex.
 Construction is complicated  on the one
 hand by the extremely flexible sys':em of it
 general contractor and a series of subcon-
 tractors, brought together on the basis of
 the specializations needed on each given job.
 On the other hand, construction worker,;
 are organized into a variety of specialities,
 each with its own union and its o;cn juris-
 diction
 One of the problems for all concerned has
 been the fact that often when a dispute over
 which union jurisdiction is appropriate rears
 Its head the contractor, the unions directly
 involved,  and  all  the other union worker
 groups employed on the job are apt to suffer
 as the job lies idle for all concerned while
 the dispute is ironed out.
 Most of those  injured are innocent by-
 standers-the unions not a part of the dis-
 pute who would otherwise be working, the
 contractor, and the preson who is counting
 on  the  factory,  dwelling,  or  commercial
 building he is paying for and has contracted
 for but which isn't getting built.
 Yet,  for a union to yield jurisdiction in
 such a dispute means not only the loss of
 work  involved in the one case but might
 prejudice all such jobs in the future.
 Indeed, in a craft union, if jurisdiction is
 chipped away the union is out of business
 and ceases  to existand its members are
 without work.
 With the variety of unions involved and
 the variety of contractors and subcontrac-
 Lo?s involved,  .5  variety of such problems
 have arisen and the overall problem has be-
 come very serious.
 So serious that a great deal of sober and
 responsible effort has gone into the problem
 of how to fairly decide and consistently re-
 solve such disputes---and establish fixed and
 known and stable jurisdictions.
 These efforts were climaxed in the estab-
 lishment of a national joint board and an
 appeals board for the specific settlement of
 jurisdic`ional disputes in the building and
 construction industry.
 Further, basic  agreements and decisions
 that have been made are compiled in what
 the trade calls  "the green book"  for  the
 guidance of all concerned so as to avoid the
 same dispute erupting twice.
 This structure was hammered out by the
 Building and Construction Trades Depart-
 ment of the AFL-CIO and the two major
 contractor associations with the President
 of the United States as witness.
 It is a significant step forward, but far too
 often this machinery doesn't come into play
 until it job is underway and the job itself
 is held up until the procedures for settle-
 ment are completed.
 What is now proposed, at the initiative of
 local leaders in the construction unions, is
 a general meeting of all interested parties,
 contractors, union representatives, and oth-
 ers---such as bank finance people.
 The purpose would be to iron out a further
 step, providing for procedures wh,reby the
 plans and work outline  of any job, once
 contracted, would be made available in ad-
 vance in a "plan room" or by some other
 arra ngc ment.
 Within  1  week  of  this availability,  the
 various unions would be required to formally
 claim which work fell into their jurisdic-
 tions.   If                                                                     claims  overlapped,  creating   the
 conditions for a dispute, a hearing would bc
 scheduled in an attempt to iron it out, and
 when all the hearing evidence was in regard-
 ing past agreements, past decisions in like
 cases, and if need be, lacking such case his-
 tories, reference to past local practice, the
 contractor would make his decision as to
 which of the disputing unions he believes
 has the best claim of jurisdiction.
 The union in contention may then, it it
 chooses, appeal that decision to the already
 established  and presently  functioning  na -
 tional joint board.
 In the meantime, the contractor's decision
 stands and the work must go forward without
 disruption or it work stoppage.  If the na-
 tional joint hoard agrees with the contractor,
 he goes forward as is.  If it reverses him, he
 must shift the work over to the designstenn.
 union.
 In either case, there is a pledge of no work
 stoppage because of the dispute.
 In short, the local leaders propose to take
 a further step on present procedures designed
 (1) to detect it jurisdictional dispute or prob-
 lem in advance, (2) to settle it by orderly and
 recognized processes, and (3) to get this done
 before the work commences so it will not
 interfere with the work, and in any case to
 outlaw  a work  stoppage  during  the  pro-
 cedural steps if the matter does go to appeal
 at the present national joint board level.
 Such a purpose, and such initiative among
 union leaders in this area, can only be ap-
 plauded.  The complex details of an effective
 "plan room," of signatories to such an agree-
 ment, and of the rights of appeal---all involv-
 ing in some way both many unions and many
 contractors may pose problems, and differ-
 ences of approach.
 But it is certainly worth while to attack
 those details and try to work them out fairly.
 Success in such a conference would produce
 it labor landmark of national significance.
 It would be a leadership step here in this
 area that would focus the attention of the
 entire industry, and a climate that would en-
 courage development in this area to the joint
 benefit  of  contractors  and  construction
 unions-as well as the community as a whole.
 It could also be a classic example of -now
 people engaged in the same basic activity in
 different ways can make much more progress
 by finding those areas where pulling together
 provides a mutual advantage, rather than
 fostering differences to mutual disadvantage.
 And it is significant for the potential future
 of this area that the initiative, the energy.
 and the responsible study bringing forth this
 effort has come from the ranks of labor.

 Monday, February 21, 1966
 Mr. MATSUNAGA.   Mr. Speaker, be-
 cause much has been made of recent
 differences between our Government and
 the Government of France, I take partic-
 ular pleasure today in unfolding to you
 and to my esteemed colleagues a heart-
 warming story of friendship between the
 United States and France. Although this
 friendship is probably not one that would
 lead to world-shaking decisions, it should
 serve as an inspiration for those of us
 who are continually striving to promote
 good will among the different peoples of
 the world.  For, after all, are not Gov-
 ernments made up of people?
 I refer, Mr. Speaker, to the steadfast
 friendship that exists between the peo-

 Dr. Starr's heroism when they were given
 400 acres of land in his memory.
 A similar grant is named after Maj.
 James Converse whose heirs benefited
 from his distinguished service to the
 colony.  The son and two daughters of
 the Reverend Benjamin Rolfe were given
 600 acres after escaping an Indian raid in
 1,708, in which the parents and another
 sister lost their lives.
 It is from these heroic deeds and sac-
 rifices of the pioneer settlers that Ash-
 burnham got its start, and it is from the
 spiritual strength, resourcefulness and
 determination of these early forebears
 that our Nation got its strength and pur-
 pose to become the great country it is
 today-truly a giant among the nations
 of the world, the most powerful, richest,
 and most advanced with the highest
 standards of living the world has ever
 known.
 Among the great names still echoing
 from that rugged and glorious period of
 growth and progress in golden history of
 Ashburnham is that of Cushing, which is
 with us today in the living memorial of
 presented in the area, and the cannon

 would not have surprised him.
 I think, Mr. Speaker, that on the
 whole George Washington would have
 been well pleased with the birthday year
 of Ashburnham and all the wonderful
 events which went into making it the
 .great memorable celebration that it
 was-the Boy and Girl Scout participa-
 tion, the helicopters and antique auto-
 mobiles, the lovely and gracious bicen-
 tennial queen, the time capsule with its
 ballpoint pen and modern razor among
 its contents, the parties and balls.
 I think also that George Washington
 would have been convinced that Ash-
 burnham has not stood still, but has
 kept pace with the times and the de-
 mands of the age in which we live.  He
 would draw inspiration, as we all can,
 from the great and glorious history of
 our past, as reflected all over America
 by the growth and prosperity of hun-
 dreds upon hundreds of thriving com-
 munities like Ashburnham.

 I trust you are a backer of the administra-

 its people must not be betrayed and aban-
 doned  into  Communist   hands.  In  South
 Vietnam the United States must stand firm.
 If you must deal with people who insist
 that the Vietcong are our brothers and only
 want peace, you can ask them to come to
 South Vietnam and take note of the Viet-

 Mr. STANTON.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 not in the habit of inserting into the
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD   letters  from
 constitutents in my district; in fact, I
 have never done so until now.   How-
 ever, when I received a letter from Mr.
 John C. Friese, director of food services
 at Kent State University, I was thor-
 oughly  impressed  with  his                                                                                                                                          eminent

 Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to
 insert Mr. Friese's letter into the RECORD.
