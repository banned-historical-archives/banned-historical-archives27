 CHINA
 ,5r
 A meeting of the standing committee of
 the National People's Congress, China's
 legislature, opened on November 30 in
 Peking. The last and most important item
 on the agenda is appointments to and
 removals from high-level government
 positions.
 China's foreign minister, Chiao
 Kuan-hua, has been replaced by former
 UN Ambassador Huang Hua, one of
 Peking's most seasoned diplomats.
 A possible explanation for Chiao's
 political difficulties is the reported anger
 of Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying, now
 the number-two man in China and a
 staunch supporter of the ousted vice
 premier, Teng Hsiao-ping, over Chiao's
 apparent eagerness to join the attack on
 Teng.
 The Foreign Ministry in any case
 appears to be in for a major shakeup.
 Chinese ambassadors to Canada, West
 Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Turkey,
 and the UN have all been recalled, ap-
 parently permanently. Some of these men
 may be in line for new posts at home, but
 nearly all have been identified to some
 degree with Peking's more outward-look-
 ing foreign policy of the 1970s.
 Thus far, the Chinese have been at
 pains to emphasize continuity in their
 foreign policy since the death of Mao, and
 the new foreign minister does not seem
 likely to make major changes.
 The meeting on November 30 featured
 a brief speech by Party Chairman Hua
 Kuo-feng, who nominated Chou En-lai's
 widow to be one of the vice chairmen of
 the standing committee of the National
 People's Congress. Hua, whose speech
 was greeted with "thunderous applause,"
 is plainly trying to capitalize on the im-
 mense popularity of the late Chou En-lai.
 National People's Congress Vice
 Chairman Wu Te also gave a speech. Wu
 hailed Hua's appointment as party chair-
 man and acclaimed the fall of the leftists.
 He reiterated the conciliatory attitude,
 announced in a People's Daily editorial on
 Sunday, toward lower level followers of
 the leading leftists. Wu also called for the
 continuation of criticism of Teng Hsiao-
 ping.
 It has been rumored that Teng will be
 rehabilitated now that his major detrac-
 tors have fallen, but Wit's comment
 strongly suggests that Teng's rehabilita-
 tion, while still likely in the longer run, is
 SOUTH KOREA
 There are continuing signs of concern
 and uncertainty in South Korea over the
 prospects for US-Korean relations.
 South Korean official statements con-
 tinue to insist that US policy under
 President-elect Carter will not change
 radically, that the US will consult fully
 with both Tokyo and Seoul, and that the
 Korean government will be able to con-
 vince the US of the correctness of its
 current policies.
 At the same time, underlying themes
 suggest uncertainty. South Korean of-
 ficials insist that any increased pressure
 on them on the human rights issue will be
 rejected as unacceptable interference in
 Korean internal affairs, and that South 25X1
 Korea can "go it alone" if the US begins
 troop withdrawals.
 prominently in the government-controlled
 press in the past week or so. Editorials
 have criticized the "excessive interference
 of our developed-nation allies" and called
 for Korea to "develop in accord with our
 own history, culture, and tradition."
 South Korean officials, in conversations
 with US embassy officers, have also
 stressed the serious consequences if the
 US presses too hard on South Korean in-
 ternal affairs.
 Despite the firm line taken by Pak and
 other South Korean officials, the govern-
 ment has recently taken several tentative
 measures to loosen up domestic political
 controls. Christian leaders have been
 allowed to hold a series of conferences on 25X1
 human rights, press censorship of foreign 25X1
 news has been eased slightly, and an op-
 position assemblyman was allowed to
 testify at a trial of opposition figures.
 There are rumors that a fairly sweeping
 leadership shakeup is coming soon and
 that it will involve such insiders as Korean
 CIA Director Sin Chik-su, key Blue
 House aide Kim Chong-yon, and a
 number of cabinet officers. President Pak
 may intend to signal by such moves that
 he is not completely inflexible as he enters 25X1
 a new phase in US-Korean relations, one
 that he clearly expects to be rocky at

 BANGLADESH
 General Zia ur-Rahman, de facto
 leader of Bangladesh since November
 1975, assumed full powers as chief martial
 law administrator this week. The title had
 been held by President Sayem, who
 remains president but is relegated to a
 ceremonial status.
 Within hours of Zia's former takeover,
 leaders of most major political parties
 were under arrest; reports indicate that
 some 100 politicians have been tar-
 geted for detention. Some of them may
 be tried for corruption. Khondakar
 Mushtaque Ahmed, leader of the
 Democratic League, may be tried for his
 alleged role in the murder of several
 political leaders. Mushtaque, installed as
 president of Bangladesh by the army of-
 ficers who killed former president Mu-
 jibur Rahman in August 1975, was
 himself ousted in the first of two military
 coups in November last year.
 Zia probably decided to act now in
 order to head off possible active opposi-
 tion to his government's decision, an-
 nounced on November 21, to postpone the
 national election. President Sayem had
 publicly promised an election by next
 February and probably pushed within the
 government for a return to normal
 political activity. Other government and
 military officials apparently persuaded
 Zia that a return to partisan political ac-
 tivity would regenerate political violence.
 No open opposition to the postponement
 of the election has yet appeared.
 US embassy sources report that several
 influential politicians may have been
 secretly organizing opposition to the
 government. Zia may have learned of the
 plotting. In any event, he presumably
 wanted to remove any rivals-particularly
 Mushtaque, who has significant popular
 support-at least temporarily from the
 public eye.
 Effective opposition to Zia's actions is
 unlikely. Most Bangladeshis are ap-
 parently satisfied with the relative stabil- 25X1
 ity  and  prosperity  the  martial  law 25X1
 administration has brought to the coun-
 try during the past year.
 Soviet General Secretary Brezhnev, in
 a speech on November 30 honoring
 visiting Secretary of the Treasury Simon,
 summarized Soviet grievances with the
 US, but expressed hope for expanded
 cooperation in the future. His comments
 were clearly intended for the incoming US
 administration and the new Congress.
 Brezhnev laid a special emphasis on the
 importance of eliminating discriminatory
 US trade legislation, as was appropriate
 to the occasion-the fourth session of the
 US-Soviet Trade and Economic coun-
 cil-but he also devoted considerable
 attention to strategic arms limitations and
 other arms control issues. He-blamed the
 US for holding back progress in both
 trade and arms control and implied the
 US must take the initiative in overcoming
 current obstacles.
 Brezhnev was blunt, as was Foreign
 Trade Minister Patolichev earlier that
 same day, in criticizing US trade policy
 toward the USSR. He repeated Soviet
 warnings that US businessmen will con-
 tinue to lose Soviet business unless US
 trade discrimination against the USSR is
 eliminated.
 The Soviets have given renewed atten-
 tion recently to the subject of US-Soviet
 trade, suggesting that they hope the new
 administration will be able to work out an
 acceptable compromise with Congress.
 In his remarks on November 30,
 Brezhnev decried the anti-Soviet rhetoric
 of the US election campaign and
 emphasized the "clear and consistent"
 nature of Soviet policy toward the US, es-
 pecially in attempts to curb the arms race.
 Praising past Soviet  proposals and
 US-Soviet agreements in this area, he
 said the USSR is prepared to go further in
 cooperation with the new administration
 "if it is prepared to act in the same spirit."
 Brezhnev voiced strong support for lim-
 iting strategic offensive arms and called
 for an intensification of efforts to sign
 a new SALT agreement. He said that it is
 "high time to put an end to the freeze of
 this important question imposed by
 Washington" and that he expects an
 agreement to be based on the Vladivostok
 understandings. He added that the USSR
 is prepared to discuss possible new
 measures to prevent the proliferation of
 nuclear weapons and reduce the threat of
 nuclear war.
 EGYPTIAN TALKS / J - /1
 The USSR and Egypt both appear un-
 willing to make the first concession as
 they maneuver on the question of rap-
 prochement.
 The talks in Bulgaria several weeks ago
 between foreign ministers Gromyko and
 Fahmi do not seem to have had any tangi-
 ble results. Soviet and Egyptian polemics
 have continued unabated after the two-
 day meeting. The Soviets in particular
 have gone out of their way to underscore
 their grievances with the Egyptians. The
 USSR clearly does not want to risk losing
 face by making concessions before any
 sign of change in Egyptian policy.
 The two sides have encountered dif-
 ficulties in their preliminary discussions
 on renewal of the annual trade agreement
 for 1977. A Soviet trade delegation left
 Cairo on November 27 apparently
 without having reached a settlement on
 the types and quantities of goods to be in-
 cluded in next year's agreement.
 President  Sadat has publicly

 acknowledged the need for continued con-
 tacts and last week disclosed that he had
 sent a note to General Secretary Brezhnev
 proposing a summit meeting. The Egyp-
 tian President added that the Soviet
 leader will have to "take me as I am and
 not as he wants me to be," apparently
 signaling that Egypt is not prepared to
 return to a friendship treaty or even to a
 statement of principles as the basis of a
 new relationship.
 Egypt has, however, come out in favor
 of the Soviet proposal to resume the
 neva conference on the Middle East,
 a better a mosp ere for improved
 Soviet-Egyptian relations, but we see no
 indication of any rapid movement toward
 a rapprochement.
 Sadat is trying to get US attention by
 reviving his Soviet connection, but he ap-
 parently does not want to make any move
 toward the USSR that would compromise
 his dealing with the next administration in
 15._20
 Soviet party chief Brezhnev made his
 first formal visit to Romania from
 November 22 to 24; each side projected
 the impression of improved relations
 without making any fundamental con-
 cessions.
 Outstanding differences came to the
 surface during the toasts and speeches,
 but the bland joint declaration glossed
 over these issues and highlighted areas of
 agreement.  There was no mention,
 however, of a growing "unity of views" as
 there was during President Ceausescu's
 meeting with Brezhnev in the Crimea last
 summer.
 Brezhnev pushed hard for increased
 Soviet-Romanian cooperation, but the
 declaration-which stresses closer party
 and state ties at all levels-provided few
 specifics. The two men did agree to con-
 sult more frequently on bilateral and in-
 ternational matters in order to "har-
 monize" their positions. It is doubtful,
 however, that Romanian policy will
 change significantly.
 During the negotiations, the
 Romanians reportedly found it necessary
 to remind the Soviets of language about
 party autonomy contained in the final
 document of last June's European com-
 munist party conference.
 The international section of the
 declaration bears a distinct Romanian im-
 print in its reference to the nonaligned
 movement, to disarmament, and to the
 Middle East. There reportedly was
 "intensive discussion"  of Ceausescu's
 views supporting a new international
 economic order, and compromise
 language emerged in the declaration. On
 other issues, such as Balkan cooperation
 and Romania's proposal for a nuclear-
 free zone there, Brezhnev refused to
 budge.
 Ceausescu reportedly did not succeed in
 wresting a commitment from the Soviets
 to supply Romania with additional raw

 materials and some oil. The two leaders
 pledged only to "pursue" overfulfillment
 of the 1976-80 bilateral trade agreement,
 and the declaration suggests there will not
 be a substantial expansion in trade before
 1980. The two leaders also decided to
 postpone indefinitely the meeting of the
 bilateral joint economic commission,
 originally scheduled for last October.
 Both sides are probably satisfied with
 the talks. A Romanian diplomat noted
 that Brezhnev's visit signifies that the
 USSR has achieved "a certain understan-
 ding" of Romania's positions. For their
 part, the Soviets are no doubt pleased at
 the semblance of unity the visit evokes.
 Romania balanced its favorable media
 coverage and impressive welcome of
 Brezhnev with extensive attention to the
 simultaneous visit of US Commerce
 Secretary Richardson and references to
 the "friendly visit" to Peking of a Roma-
 nian  deputy  defense  minister.
 Z~ MEAT SHORTAGES
 he timing bf the USSR's recent
 purchase of 42,000 tons of meat from
 Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand is
 somewhat puzzling because the worst of
 the Soviet meat shortage is apparently
 over. Recent purchases bring total meat
 commitments for 1976 to nearly 200,000
 tons, and talks under way with Australia,
 New Zealand, and the EC might lead to
 an additional 150,000 tons. If such con-
 tracts are concluded, Moscow's hard-
 currency outlays for foreign meat may
 reach $250 million this year.
 We had expected large Soviet
 purchases of meat earlier this year to
 offset sharply reduced domestic meat
 production, a consequence of last year's
 harvest failure. Instead, purchases were
 minimal at the time when domestic meat
 shortages were at their worst. The
 leadership seemed to have weathered a
 potentially difficult period with little
 evidence of public discontent.
 The current interest in meat purchases
 may result from:
 ? A larger-than-expected reduction
 in meat inventories.
 ? An improved hard-currency out-
 look. This year's abundant harvest has
 reduced pressure to use hard currency
 for grain imports in 1977.
 ? A recognition that even the re-
 duced plan for domestic meat pro-
 duction-13.3 million tons this year-
 cannot be met. Industrial meat out-
 put in October was the lowest for that
 month since 1970 and at the end of the
 month was running 21 percent be-
 hind last year's level.
 Soviet meat supplies will remain un-
 usually tight until early next year, when
 an increase in domestic Soviet meat
 production is likely.
 Diets in general this winter will
 nevertheless be more varied than last
 winter.  Supplies of dairy products,
 potatoes, winter vegetables, sugar, and
 bread reportedly are adequate at gov-
 ernment-controlled prices in most major
 cities; rural areas are still experiencing
 shortages of butter, eggs, and flour.
 ORDER TALKS WITH CHINA
 Deputy Foreign Minister Ilichev,
 Moscow's chief negotiator at the long
 stalemated Sino-Soviet border talks
 returned to Peking on November 27 and
 reportedly met with his Chinese counter-
 part, Deputy Foreign Minister Yu Chan,
 on November 30. Ilichev had been absent
 from the talks since May 1975, the longest
 absence of a chief Soviet negotiator since
 the talks began in October 1969.
 Soviet Ambassador Tolstikov told
 reporters at the airport in Peking that
 Ilichev's return was a Soviet initiative.
 Moscow probably views it as another step
 in its continuing effort to build a public
 record of Soviet reasonableness in dealing
 with  Mao's successors. Chinese Vice
 Premier Li Hsien-nien's strongly negative
 speech on Sino-Soviet relations two weeks
 ago may have made the Soviets believe
 that they had to try harder to keep alive
 the possibility of a Sino-Soviet rapproche-
 ment.
 We doubt that the Chinese have given
 the USSR any sign of willingness to en-
 gage in serious negotiations on the border
 problem. Chinese propaganda continues
 to be as hostile as ever toward the Soviets.
 About two weeks after the death of
 Mao, Moscow sent its deputy at the talks,
 General Gankovsky-who also had been
 absent from China for a prolonged
 period-back to Peking; all indications
 are that he has had only minimal contacts
 with the Chinese.
 Ilichev, nonetheless, may carry some
 new proposals that take into account
 China's reason for rejecting the last
 Soviet offer for a settlement of the eastern

 Cross-border strikes by white-led
 Rhodesian forces against insurgent camps
 in Mozambique, which have continued in-
 termittently since the end of October, are
 apparently paying at least short-term
 military dividends.
 The raids have resulted in the destruc-
 tion of sizable quantities of munitions,
 demonstrated the vulnerability of both the
 guerrillas and their Mozambican
 defenders, and probably forced the in-
 surgents to move farther back from the
 border. The Rhodesian security forces
 have also retaliated in force against
 Mozambican military units that initiated
 border actions; in at least one case, the

 Rhodesians used jet fighters.
 Inside Rhodesia, the security forces
 have apparently tracked down numerous
 guerrilla bands, including many in-
 filtrating for the first time. Nearly 250
 guerrillas were killed last month, accord-
 ing to Rhodesian communiques. The
 weakness of the guerrillas' military train-
 ing was evident, and they have also been
 hampered by factional fighting at camps
 inside Rhodesia.
 Although the Rhodesian security forces
 apparently intend to keep up the pressure
 on the guerrillas, the insurgents will
 probably make a stronger showing in the
 weeks ahead. The heavy rains are getting
 under way and beginning to provide
 significantly improved vegetation cover
 for the guerrillas. Moreover, their ranks
 will be swelled as more of the large
 numbers of black Rhodesians recruited
 over the past year become available.
 Some of these recruits are currently being
 moved from Mozambique to more secure
 training camps in Tanzania,  where
 Chinese instructors have long been
 stationed.
 At the Geneva conference, the par-
 ticipants finally moved last weekend from
 the independence date issue to begin dis-
 cussions on the form and substance of a
 transition government. A group of key in-
 surgent military leaders returned to
 Geneva on December 2 to augment
 Robert  Mugabe's  Zimbabwe  African
 National Union delegation, the group
 that has taken the hardest line in the talks.
 The participation of these militants,
 who apparently continue confident that25X1
 their guerrillas can soon achieve a
 military victory, seems sure to complicate
 efforts to reach an agreement.
 ANGOLAN    3 5
 A new government lineup announced
 last weekend in Angola suggests that
 President Agostinho Neto has strengthen-
 ed his domestic political position.
 The new cabinet is composed mainly of
 Neto loyalists, particularly in the most
 important posts. Lopo do Nascimento, a
 long-time Neto supporter, remains prime
 minister. He will be assisted by three
 deputies, at least two of whom are Neto
 stalwarts. The new foreign minister, a
 white, has long served as Neto's
 right-hand man.
 Absent from the new cabinet is Nito
 Alves, an outspoken critic of Neto who
 had been interior minister. Since the end
 of the civil war last winter, Alves has been
 working at building a personal power base
 among black radicals in the military and
 the large number of unemployed black
 Angolans.
 A communique issued after a party
 meeting last month had seemed to point
 to Neto's formal assumption of the posi-
 tion of prime minister. Instead, it is ap-
 parently intended that he will take over
 some of the functions previously exercised
 by the prime minister, particularly in es-25X1
 tablishing policy guidelines in both
 domestic and foreign affairs.

 NAMIBIA _%b
 A meeting last week between South
 African Prime Minister Vorster and a
 committee of the multiracial Namibian
 constitutional conference apparently fail-
 ed to resolve the impasse that has
 developed between the conference's white
 and nonwhite participants..
 The committee had requested the
 meeting with Vorster because its efforts to
 devise a multiracial interim government
 to oversee the transition of the South
 African - administered territory to in-
 dependence were stalled by basic dis-
 agreements among the I1 delegations to
 the conference. The delegations represent
 the whites and the 10 nonwhite ethnic
 groups inhabiting the territory.
 Most of the white members of the com-
 mittee have insisted on interim
 arrangements that would diffuse power
 among the existing ethnic homelands in a
 loose federal system instead of setting up
 a strong central government. Such a
 system would enable the whites to main-
 tain control of Namibia's rich mineral
 resources even though they make up only
 12 percent of the population.
 Shortly before the committee went to
 Oct
 Pretoria to meet with Vorster, some of its
 nonwhite members told the press that a
 loose federal system was unacceptable.
 They also said they intended to ask
 Vorster to press the hard liners in the
 white delegation to yield to the nonwhite
 majority.
 According to the US embassy, guarded
 commentary from several participants at
 the meeting indicates that Vorster stress-
 ed the urgency of reaching an early con-
 sensus on forming a government, but
 made no clear effort to encourage the
 white hard liners to compromise with the

 Syrian peacekeeping forces in Lebanon
 were forced to delay their plansto move
 into key cities in southern Lebanon this
 week because of repeated warnings from
 Israel that it would not tolerate the
 presence of a non-Lebanese military force
 so close to its border. The Israelis last
 week increased their military strength in
 northern Israel slightly-but with much

 Syrian units had intended to take up
 positions in the southern port city of
 Tyre-where Palestinian and Lebanese
 leftist groups are still receiving arms
 shipments-and to secure the Palestinian
 stronghold at Nabatiyah. Syrian forces
 have not moved any farther south than Az
 Zahrani, however, and are not in a posi-

 border operations against Israel or to
 quell continuing clashes between Israeli-
 backed Christian troops and Palestinian
 and leftist forces along the southeastern
 border.

 trying to find a compromise solution, but
 Israel's position seems to give him little
 leeway.

 JORDAN 44 " ~~
 The changes in the Jordanian cabinet
 announced on November 27 represent a
 modest political victory for Crown Prince
 Hasan and his ally, Prime Minister
 Badran, and a setback for their political
 opponent, former prime minister Zayd
 Rifai. For the past several months Rifai
 has served as an unofficial adviser to King
 Husayn.
 Most of the six members dropped from
 the cabinet were supporters of Rifai who
 were having difficulty working with
 Badran. Their replacements are generally
 nonpolitical technocrats or politicians
 with ties to the Crown Prince and his
 associates.
 One of the new cabinet members is a
 well-known political adversary of Rifai
 and an advocate of Bedouin tribal in-
 terests. His appointment confirms the
 King's interest in having Badran put
 together a cabinet that will help assuage
 East Bank and army unhappiness.
 Although the cabinet shuffle suggests
 that Rifai may be less influential than he
 was expected to be in his advisory role, it
 does not mean that policies he promoted
 are being abandoned.
 Rifai has been identified mainly with
 Jordan's efforts to work out close
 economic and military cooperative
 arrangements with Syria. The King sup-
 PERSIAN GULF
 The foreign ministers of the countries
 on the Persian Gulf were unable to agree
 on a formula for closer cooperation on
 regional issues during a two-day con-
 ference in Oman last week.
 The conference was the fourth meeting
 since July 1975. Each has ended with talk
 of further sessions, but the prospect for
 meaningful cooperation,  especially on
 regional security, is receding.
 The attendance of Iraq at the meeting
 assured its failure. Iraqi leaders support
 regional cooperation only among Arab
 states-thus excluding Iran-and only on
 such prosaic subjects as information and
 ports this policy and apparently is prepar-
 ing to take additional steps during Syrian
 President Asad's visit to Amman early
 this month.
 IRAN

 Iran's current-account surplus, which
 probably will total $5.6 billion this year,
 does not support the Shah's argument for
 a large oil price hike.
 Even with no oil price increase next
 year, Iran probably would run a $4.2-
 billion current-account surplus. A 10-per-
 cent oil price hike would raise the 1977
 surplus to $5.6 billion.
 Iran experienced a financial setback
 last year when imports almost doubled
 and exports declined in response to the
 slump in world demand for heavy crude
 oil. Imports of capital goods, industrial
 raw materials, and transport equipment
 rose dramatically as Iran rushed ahead
 with its ambitious development program.
 The current-account surplus in 1975
 dipped to $3.6 billion from $13.2 billion in
 1974.
 Oil exports began to rebound early this
 year, and crude oil liftings were close to
 capacity. As a result, we expect total ex-
 ports to rise by $3.2 billion this year.
 Imports, on the other hand, will remain
 health. They refuse to discuss regional
 cooperation on security matters.
 The Iraqi foreign minister attended the
 meeting only after failing in his efforts to
 have it called off. He insisted that dis-
 cussions be limited to the question of
 freedom of navigation through the Strait
 of Hormuz.
 Iraqi diplomacy is aimed at blocking
 any regional formula that limits the
 movement of ships through the strait.
 Iran, supported by Oman, takes the
 position that the Persian Gulf is a closed
 sea from which foreign military presence
 should be excluded.
 The Shah of Iran has advocated a com-
 prehensive multilateral security pact for
 at about the 1975 level. In the first nine
 months of this year imports from the US,
 Iran's largest supplier, were down 17 per-
 cent from last year's level.
 The economy has not yet digested last
 year's rapid increase in imports. Port ex-
 pansion and modernization projects have
 made little headway; the volume of cargo
 clogging Iran's major ports has reportedly
 doubled since the end of 1975. Food and
 military equipment imports have been
 given priority; consumer durables, con-
 struction materials, and capital goods
 deliveries are caught up in the backlog.
 Slow progress in clearing and ex-
 panding the ports and the government's
 decision in June 1975 to stretch out
 the development plan should hold down
 import gains for the next few years.
 The increase in this year's trade surplus
 has been partly offset by a rise in net ser-
 vice payments. Much of the rise in the ser-
 vices deficit reflects larger expenditures
 for foreign managerial services to carry
 out development projects.
 On the capital account, Iran may
 register a deficit of as much as $2.9 billion
 this year, partly reflecting capital flight.
 In late October, the Shah admitted that
 an outflow of $2 billion of private funds
 had occurred over the preceding 16
 months, largely in reaction to the strict
 limitations on profit margins enacted in
 mid-1975.

 the Gulf region. He regards such a pact as
 a way to consolidate Iran's already strong
 position and as a vehicle for employing
 Iranian power in a policing role.
 Political developments in early 1975,
 including a political accord between Iran
 and Iraq, encouraged the Shah to believe
 progress on a pact was possible. Subse-
 quent developments have almost certainly
 convinced him a pact is not now at-
 tainable.
 Bilateral ties, like those developed in re-
 cent years between Iran and Oman, offer
 an alternative way of employing Iran's
 power in the region, the Shah may be
 switching the emphasis of his diplomacy
 to this channel.

 MEXICO
 Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo,
 sworn into office December I, devoted
 most of his inaugural address to economic
 policy, stressing the need to restore con-
 fidence in the government. His remarks
 indicate that he plans an orderly shift
 away from the expansionary fiscal
 policies of his predecessor.
 On November 30, outgoing President
 Echeverria used his last full day in office
 to polish his populist image. I-Ie gave
 peasants titles to 445,000 hectares of land
 that had been expropriated in past years
 and ordered a new expropriation of some
 3,500 hectares to be split into small plots
 for peasants' homes.
 In his inaugural speech, Lopez Portillo
 said the current crisis in public confidence
 in the government is a danger to the
 economic and political future of the coun-
 try. He warned that continued economic
 disorder could cause domestic strife that
 would have to be dealt with by force. He
 said a period of austerity will be necessary
 and that it will include import controls
 and cuts in government spending.

 He referred several times to the coun-
 try's many current problems and to his
 commitment to solve them. He said he
 needs time to find solutions. Many of his
 remarks were intended to ease the climate
 of uncertainty that marked Echeverria's
 last months in power.
 Although he did not spell out clearly his
 views on agricultural reform, the new
 President indicated that he views land dis-
 tribution as the wrong way to solve the
 urgent rural problem because peasants
 cannot produce efficiently on small
 parcels of land. These sentiments, in
 direct conflict with the expropriations
 carried out by Echeverria, will be received
 well by conservatives, but will not help
 those landowners already affected by
 Echeverria's actions.
 Lopez Portillo will be under pressure to
 revoke the expropriations, although any
 effort to reverse Echeverria's actions
 would risk a peasant uprising.
 Lopez Portillo's cabinet is composed of
 close associates with strong ad-
 ministrative records rather than
 well-known political figures, indicating
 that he will emphasize administrative ef-
 ficiency rather than the political rhetoric
 that characterized Echeverria's years.

 CHILE-PERU-BOLIVIAN   /
 Chile's blunt rejection of a Peruvian
 formula for providing Bolivia with a cor-
 ridor to the sea seems to set the stage for a
 deadlock that could get the US involved
 in the long-festering dispute.
 Chile had earlier offered to grant
 Bolivia exclusive sovereignty in a corridor
 on the Chilean side of the present
 Chile-Peru border. The Peruvian counter-
 formula called for tripartite control in
 part of the corridor.
 Chile asserts that the Peruvian in-
 itiative represents "a clear and manifest
 modification" of Chilean sovereignty as
 established by a 1929 treaty. Chile argues
 that Peru's prerogatives under the treaty
 are limited to approving or rejecting
 Chilean plans involving disposition of the
 territory, which Chile conquered from
 Peru about a century ago.
 If the two sides are unable to come to
 terms, the US may become involved un-
 der a provision of the 1929 treaty that
 refers any dispute over interpretation of
 the treaty to the US president.
 Peruvian Foreign Minister de la Puente
 announced last week, before Chile's rejec-
 tion, that if Chile and Bolivia rejected
 Peru's counterproposal the situation
 would return to "point zero." An official
 response to Chile on November 26,
 however, implied that Peru is still willing

 Two new opposition groups emerged recently in Israel

 greatest challenge in next year's general election.

 Israel: Domestic Political Scene in Flux
 The recent emergence of two new op-
 position leaders on the Israeli political
 scene is symptomatic of rising popular
 dissatisfaction with both the Rabin
 government and the equally lackluster
 and faction-ridden Likud opposition bloc.
 With a hard election fight coming
 next fall, Prime Minister Rabin and
 other Labor Party leaders are almost
 certain to urge the US not to press
 Israel to engage in serious negotiations
 with the Arabs until after the election
 lest they harm Labor's chances of stay-
 ing in power.
 Yigael Yadin,  a highly respected
 former Israeli chief of staff, recently an-
 nounced the establishment of a new
 political party that is likely to have a
 moderate, reformist cast.
 Ariel Sharon, a controversial and pop-
 ular general who led the Israeli armored
 attack across the Suez Canal in the 1973
 war, recently broke with the conservative
 Likud to establish his own hard-line
 group.
 The actions by both men will affect the
 outcome of the general election next fall.
 Yadin, a moderate on peace negotiations,
 poses the greater threat to Prime Minister
 Rabin's Labor Party. He will probably
 pick up support among splinter groups
 and independents who favor "dovish"
 policies on Arab-Israeli issues. He is also
 likely to make some inroads among long-
 time supporters of the Labor Party who
 have become disenchanted with the Rabin
 government but are reluctant to vote for
 Likud, especially under its present
 leadership.
 Sharon, despite his personal appeal, is
 likely to have a more limited impact on
 the outcome than the less dynamic Yadin.
 A political maverick and rigid hard-liner
 on Arab-Israeli issues, Sharon is likely to
 draw more votes from Likud than from
 Labor, but only enough to win a few seats
 at best.
 Other Political Challenges
 The Labor Party has other problems.
 The small Independent Liberal Party,
 with four Knesset seats, apparently is
 about to drop out of the governing coali-
 tion.
 This  will  leave  the  Labor
 Alignment-the ruling coalition's core
 group composed of the Labor Party and
 the left-wing Mapam-more dependent
 on its hard-line coalition partner, the
 National Religious Party, which controls
 10 of the government's 63 remaining seats
 in the 120-member Knesset.
 Mapam, for its part, is considering
 breaking up the Alignment to run an in-
 dependent slate of candidates next fall,
 although it apparently would stay in the
 present government.
 Mapam leaders have felt frustrated in
 the minor role assigned their group and
 are threatening to pull out of the election
 alliance with Labor unless Rabin and
 other party leaders support a much more
 dovish party platform for the election.
 Labor Party Divisions
 Potentially the most serious of Labor's
 problems are the divisions within the par-
 ty itself. Rabin faces challenges to his
 leadership from former foreign minister
 Abba Eban, a leading dove, and Defense
 Minister Peres, a hard liner.
 Consequently, Rabin would prefer to
 see the party adopt a vaguely worded
 plank on negotiations that would allow
 him to head an outwardly united Labor
 Party into the fall campaign. He fears-
 justifiably-that if he bows to Mapam
 demands former defense minister Moshe

 Dayan and some other Labor Party
 hawks will bolt the party, leaving Labor
 even more divided than it is now.
 The net effect of the present jockeying
 is to create increasing doubt about the
 outcome of next year's balloting. Some
 observers believe the Labor Party could
 lose for the first time since independence
 in 1948.
 Even if Labor emerges with a plurality
 again, which still seems likely, it will
 probably be a reduced one. In that case,
 Egypt's efforts to diversify its sources of military equip-
 ment are complicated by financing problems, by the long lead
 times before West European equipment will become available,
 and by the need to find the money just to maintain existing
 stocks of Soviet-made weapons.
 negotiations over cabinet positions would,
 at a minimum, be even more arduous and

 product could well be an even less flexible
 Israeli negotiating team than the present
 one.

 its weapons supply base.

 The Search for Other Sources
 Egyptian efforts to obtain spare parts

 Cairo began to look for new sources of
 arms after it expelled most of the Soviet
 military technicians stationed in Egypt in
 1972; it intensified this effort after the
 Soviets failed to replace all of Egypt's
 1973 war losses of weapons and equip-
 ment. In late 1973, Saudi Arabia gave
 Egypt 38 Mirage jet fighters as grant aid,
 although deliveries were not completed
 until this year. Cairo's procurement in-
 itiatives were subsequently slowed by a
 lack of financial resources and Arab
 reluctance to bankroll Egyptian arms
 purchases indiscriminately.
 sile boats, the navy's top priority require-
 ment, also have been postponed for lack
 of money.
 In the long run, Egypt hopes not only to
 refit its forces with Western equipment
 but also to expand domestic military out-
 put. The Arab Industrial Organization
 was established last year by Egypt, Saudi25X1
 Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab
 Emirates to encourage development of a
 domestic armaments industry in Egypt.
 Egypt's current arms output is limited
 to light infantry weapons, ammunition,
 explosives,  and transport vehicles.
 Although Egypt's defense industry out-
 paces that of other Arab nations, it is
 small by Western and Israeli standards. It
 will continue to provide only a small por-
 tion of Egypt's defense requirements for
 many years even with Western assistance.
 Financing Problems
 The conversion from Soviet to Western
 equipment will be delayed by financing
 problems caused by the high cost of the
 equipment, Egypt's reliance on wealthy
 Arab states for monetary assistance, and
 competition with the civilian sector for

 limited funds.
 The conversion also will severely tax
 the country's technical and maintenance
 capabilities. Egypt will be hard pressed to
 maintain and operate sophisticated
 Western military equipment without ex-
 tensive retraining of personnel and
 reorganization of the logistic system to
 accommodate the new types of equipment
 and parts.
 Substantial deliveries of Western arms
 are still a long way off because of
 Europe's lack of large arms inventories
 available for immediate export and the
 long lead times required for increasing
 weapons production. New acquisitions
 almost certainly will not keep up with the
 attrition of older equipment over the next
 year or so. Even if production were not a
 constraint, Egypt will require several
 years to equip and to train Egyptian
 forces in the effective use of the new
 equipment.
 Egypt, meanwhile, will be forced to
 continue to seek assistance to maintain its
 Soviet equipment. Unless such relief is
 found, Egypt's armed forces will ex-
 perience increasing shortages over the
 next year that will further degrade its
 capabilities and widen the military im-
 balance between Egypt and Israel.
 Egypt's potential for waging war,
 however, will not be completely eroded
 even if the supply and maintenance situa-
 tion becomes worse. Under peacetime
 conditions, Egypt probably will be able to
 maintain a viable defensive posture and at
 least a limited offensive capability by 25X1

 The Labor government faces some tough tests in the

 the traditional throne speech outlining
 objectives for the coming year. The
 government pledged to give top priority to
 attacking inflation and to promoting an
 industrial revival.
 The establishment of regional
 legislative assemblies for Scotland and
 Wales will be the government's major
 legislative initiative for the new session.
 Labor will also reintroduce its controver-
 sial bill to nationalize the aircraft and
 shipbuilding industries that was blocked
 in the last legislative session.
 Although the government succeeded in
 turning back-only  by narrow
 margins-most opposition challenges in
 the session that ended on November 22,
 serious political and economic problems
 lie ahead. Labor, nevertheless, still stands
 a reasonable chance of avoiding an early
 election at least until next spring and
 perhaps longer.
 One immediate problem is the lagging
 economic recovery, which in turn will con-
 tribute to social and political discontent.
 The trade union rank and file, who have
 been prevailed upon to restrain wage
 demands, are certain to grow more
 restless as real wages decline, inflation
 continues, and unemployment remains
 high. The middle classes are also pressed
 by high rates of taxation.
 Many of these problems will remain
 and some will grow worse if the Callaghan
 government is forced to accept massive
 cuts in public spending as a condition for
 the $3.9-billion loan it is seeking from the
 International Monetary Fund. Britain's
 recovery has stalled and additional
 deflationary measures would only worsen
 the situation. The gross national product
 will grow by about 1 percent this year and
 by about 2 percent next year, far short of
 the Labor government's earlier optimistic
 forecasts of 4.5-percent growth through
 the end of 1977.
 The Labor government must reduce the
 public sector borrowing requirement to
 help restore foreign confidence in sterling
 and strengthen industrial recovery. In
 order to achieve this goal, Prime Minister
 Callaghan must maintain the
 government's alliance with the trade un-
 ions, the key to sustaining Labor Party
 unity in Parliament. Thus far, the
 leadership of the Trades Union Congress
 remains committed to the government,
 although the strains are becoming more
 evident as the unions are asked to accept
 more sacrifice while relief remains a dis-
 tant hope.
 A Bright Spot on the Horizon
 The one bright spot on the economic
 horizon is North Sea oil. Oil revenues will
 help reduce Britain's current-account
 deficit, which reached $2.8 billion in 1975
 and is expected to rise to $3 billion this
 year. According to government estimates
 published last summer, North Sea oil
 production will reduce the current-ac-
 count deficit by about $1.7 billion next
 year.
 Talks with IMF officials on the terms
 for a loan are nearing a conclusion. The
 British cabinet has reportedly agreed in
 principle that it will have to reduce the
 budget deficit in order to get an IMF
 credit and increase the possibility of an
 international  guarantee
 sterling balances.
 The remaining dilemma for the Labor
 government centers on the size of the cuts

 Jack Jones, a key government
 ally in the trade unions
 and their domestic political acceptability.
 There is considerable ministerial
 resistance to heavy cuts in public spending
 that would result in an immediate rise in
 the high unemployment level. Those
 cabinet ministers arguing against harsh
 deflationary measures have received
 powerful backing in recent days from the
 Trades Union Congress and two unex-
 pected sources, the prestigious National
 Institute for Social and Economic
 Research and the Confederation of
 British Industry.
 In anticipation of IMF conditions, the
 government in recent weeks has taken a
 number of steps to limit the growth in
 money supply and domestic credit expan-
 sion. It has raised the minimum lending
 rate to a record high, increased special
 deposits with the Bank of England, and
 imposed new restrictions on bank expan-
 sion of interest-bearing deposits. The
 Callaghan government has also an-
 nounced a reduction in the level of central
 government financial support for local
 government spending.
 To help secure Labor Party and trade
 union acceptance of what may be a
 "deflationary" IMF package, Callaghan
 wants an international guarantee for of-
 ficial  sterling  balances.  The  Prime
 Minister probably thinks a guarantee
 would signal international support for his
 economic recovery strategy and provide a
 much-needed political boost at a time
 when Labor's fortunes are sagging.
 Any budgetary adjustments required by
 the IMF would probably have to be ac-
 companied by concessions to Labor lef-
 tists. These could include import restric-
 tions and further reductions in defense
 spending as part of any overall budget
 cuts.
 If the Labor government is able to
 secure domestic acceptance of the tough
 measures that are expected to accompany
 an IMF loan, Callaghan's prospects for
 hanging on to power would improve con-
 siderably in spite of his vulnerable posi-
 tion in Parliament.
 End of Labor Majority
 Labor lost its absolute majority in the
 House of Commons on November 4
 following the loss of two of three normally
 "safe" seats in by-elections. From that
 point until the end of the parliamentary
 session on November 22, the government
 struggled against a Conservative opposi-
 tion determined to cause Callaghan max-
 imum embarrassment.
 The opposition parties, in an unusual
 display of unity-and aided by right-wing
 Labor defections-were able to gut a bill
 in Commons important to Jack Jones,
 one of the government's key trade union
 allies.
 In addition, persistent upper house op-
 position to nationalization of the aircraft
 and shipbuilding industries resulted in the
 failure to secure full parliamentary ap-
 proval of the bill before the end of the ses-
 sion. The government intends to rein-
 troduce the bill in the new session under
 procedures that would bypass the House
 of Lords. Labor's one-vote working ma-
 jority in Commons, plus the possibility of
 further by-election losses, means that the
 government will have a difficult time get-
 ting its way on the nationalization
 measure.
 Aside from nationalization, the Labor
 leadership can assert that over the past
 two years it has fulfilled the bulk of its
 election promises. This should leave the
 new parliamentary session largely free of
 ideologically  divisive legislative
 proposals. The main issues will be home
 rule for Scotland and Wales, and direct
 elections to the European Parliament.
 Both questions are controversial, but the
 arguments cut across party lines and
 could easily end up with "free" votes in

 which parliamentary discipline would not
 be enforced.
 Tough Tests Ahead
 The really tough tests for Labor will
 come on economic issues, chiefly the
 budget next spring or any mini-budget
 Chancellor of the Exchequer Healey
 might introduce in relation to the IMF
 credit. On. such votes there would be a
 danger of leftist defections. Potential
 left-wing dissidents, however, will be kept
 in line by the knowledge that their dis-
 loyalty could risk an early election and the
 coming to power of the Thatcher-led
 Tories-a prospect most leftists and trade
 unionists fear. Moreover, the Conser-
 vatives themselves would be hard pressed
 to vote against the kind of austerity
 measures they have been recommending.
 On the other issues, however, the
 Conservatives will be able to take advan-
 tage of Labor's precarious parliamentary
 situation. The government's slim overall
 edge will mean that the Tories and their
 potential allies among the minor opposi-
 tion parties will occasionally unite to deal
 Callaghan a heavy blow on important
 legislation and will be able to score tac-
 tical victories on a variety of issues.
 Confidence votes are another matter.
 Dissident Laborites who may have
 strayed on earlier votes can probably be
 relied upon to return to the fold when the
 government's life is at stake. Further-
 more, the Conservatives are likely to find
 many of the members of Parliament
 representing minor parties to be fickle
 allies in any serious effort to topple the
 government.
 The Liberals in particular would be
 heavy losers in an early election and for
 that reason would probably balk at voting
 against the government on a confidence
 motion. Labor has. also apparently struck
 a deal with the Welsh nationalists for their
 support on confidence votes in return for
 concessions on home rule for Wales.
 Political liberalization in Spain now depends in part on the
 willingness of the democratic opposition parties to play a
 positive role in the process-on terms set largely by the govern-
 ment.
 With the Spanish reform bill safely
 through the Cortes, Prime Minister
 Suarez must now try to get the noncom-
 munist opposition to participate in the
 democratic processes established by the
 new law.
 The government has two immediate
 goals: to persuade as many opposition
 parties as possible to signify their endorse-
 ment of the reforms by applying for
 legalization, and to head off an opposition
 campaign for abstentions in the referen-
 dum scheduled for December 15.
 The broad lines of the government's
 position were laid down on November 23
 by Interior Minister Martin Villa, who
 told a press conference that only officially
 approved parties will be allowed to par-
 ticipate fully in the referendum campaign
 and that proscribed political par-
 ties-Communists and left-wing ex-
 tremists-will be denied any role.
 Spain: A Role for the Opposition
 The Socialists, Christian Democrats,
 and other left-of-center parties, which
 have not yet applied for legalization, will
 be restricted to holding indoor meetings
 and denied access to television and other
 government-controlled media.
 A Gesture of Leftist Solidarity
 Failure of the left-of-center parties to
 apply for legalization is partly a gesture of
 solidarity with the Communists, who are
 likely to remain banned at least until after
 the legislative election next spring. It is
 also an expression of the parties' dis-
 pleasure at not being fully consulted on
 the reforms and their reservations about
 the government's commitment to free and
 fair elections.
 The leftist parties will probably seek to
 use the question of their full legal par-
 ticipation as a bargaining chip when they
 try to persuade the government to
 negotiate with them on the law governing
 parliamentary elections.
 The government's hard line on restric-
 ting the freedom of nonlegalized parties in
 the referendum campaign may be a
 negotiating ploy. If, on the other hand,
 the government is serious about stifling
 the leftist abstention drive, it may find the
 approach counterproductive; heavy-hand-
 ed action by security forces could unite
 the opposition at a time when it is showing
 signs of splintering. The government may
 also be vulnerable to accusations of
 manipulating the referendum.
 The Moderate Opposition
 There are signs that the more moderate
 opposition groups are uncomfortable with
 the move-led by the Communists and
 the Socialist Workers Party-to cam-
 paign aggressively for abstention unless
 various demands, including legalization of
 the Communist. Party, are met.

 regional opposition groups ranging from
 Communists to center-left Liberals and

 U P/
 Social Democrats held a meeting in
 Madrid on November 27 and called on
 the government to open negotiations with
 them. The groups agreed to various con-
 ditions-again including legalization of
 the Communist Party-which they con-
 sider necessary to give democratic
 legitimacy to the referendum and election,
 but they did not threaten to abstain if
 these conditions were not met.
 Two leaders of the small Popular
 Socialist Party recently told the US am-
 bassador that they believe it is unwise to
 expend resources opposing the referen-
 dum when the government is certain to
 win anyway.
 In any case, the Popular Socialist
 leaders said they believe the election next
 year is far more important than the
 referendum. They believe the more
 moderate groups will probably concen-
 trate on efforts to ensure a fair legislative
 election,  leaving  participation  in  the
 referendum up to each party member.
 Opposition leaders may now push for
 the appointment of three or four "wise
 men" as ministers without portfolio to act
 as intermediaries for negotiations on the
 election law and to supervise the election
 process itself. This theme was recently
 touched on in a press interview by Chris-
 tian Democrat Ruiz Gimenez, who
 suggested that the "wise men" need not be
 leaders of the opposition-they could be
 eminent jurists and experts on election
 law who have the confidence of the op-
 position.
 Consultation with Opposition
 Suarez met on November 29 with
 Christian Democratic leaders in what
 may be the first step toward broader for-
 mal consultations with the opposition.
 The government probably hopes to per-
 suade noncommunist opposition groups
 that they should not be so adamant in
 their support for legalization of the Com-
 munist Party that they jeopardize not only
 their own political futures but the coun-
 try's progress toward democracy as well.
 The major socialist group, the Socialist
 Workers Party, is in a particularly
 awkward position. Because it is com-
 peting with the Communists for workers'
 votes, it is vulnerable to accusations of
 selling out to the government. This is
 probably the main reason it is pushing for
 abstention in the referendum.
 Government officials recognize the par-
 ty's dilemma. Because they see the party
 as a key factor in the struggle to involve
 the noncommunist opposition in the
 reform program, they have privately ex-
 pressed a willingness to lean over
 backward to win its cooperation.
 A Socialist Workers Party congress,
 now scheduled for December 5 to 8, has
 received government authorization. In ad-
 dition, the government is reportedly con-
 sidering a modification of the law that
 would allow the Socialists to become25X1
 legalized without having to swear
 allegiance to  Francoist  institutions.

 The outcome of the Japanese election on December 5 is not
 likely to have much impact on the balance of political forces in
 the country. It will have an effect on the leadership battle within
 the ruling party.
 Japan: The National Election
 The ruling Liberal Democratic Party in
 Japan will retain a Diet majority and con-
 trol of the government after the national
 election on December 5.
 Despite almost ten months of pervasive
 national attention to the Lockheed scan-
 dal, the unprecedented indictment of a
 former prime minister, and an intense
 power struggle within the ruling party, the
 Liberal Democrats will be able to end up
 controlling at least 271 of the 511 seats at
 stake-enough to give them full control of
 the legislative process in the lower house.
 The margin of the party's victory will
 play a major role in former deputy prime
 minister Fukuda's challenge to Prime
 Minister Miki, which is likely to resume
 shortly after the election.
 The Conservative Edge
 Since the formation of the Liberal
 Democratic Party in 1955, urbanization
 in Japan has produced a gradual decline
 in the party's share of the popular
 vote-from 63.2 percent in 1955 to 46.9
 percent in the most recent lower house
 election in 1972.
 The party has maintained a relatively
 comfortable Diet majority in part because
 of firm support from rural constituencies.
 There,  traditional ties, an effective
 political organization, and attention to
 agricultural interests in the Diet have
 enabled the Liberal Democrats to win
 close to two thirds of all rural and
 semi-rural Diet seats.
 More important, the value of the rural
 vote to the party has increased because
 with few exceptions Diet seats have not
 been reapportioned to reflect the declining
 rural population. When reapportionment
 pressures have arisen, the ruling party has
 increased the size of the Diet; last year, it
 added 20 new urban and suburban seats.
 Even so, malapportionment remains ex-
 treme.
 The population shift has also given the
 party some opportunities for political
 gains. Since the late 1960s in particular,
 the growth of small- and medium-sized
 cities has outpaced growth in
 metropolitan  areas.  The Liberal
 Democratic Party has done reasonably
 well in the smaller urban centers, winning
 53 percent of these races in 1972, com-
 pared to only 30 percent of the contests in
 the larger metropolitan districts.
 Prime Minister Miki
 UP/
 The ruling party this year has limited
 the number of its official candidates to
 avoid excessive competition among its
 own candidates, which could fragment the
 vote. Under the Japanese system, Diet
 members are elected from mul-
 timember-three to five men-districts,
 where the voter casts only one ballot.
 Controlling the endorsement process is
 always difficult for the party. Each of its
 internal faction leaders tries to get as
 many endorsements as he can for his own
 candidates to increase his faction's
 relative strength. The problem was clearly
 evident in 1972, when the party ran a total
 of 339 candidates; this helped cause it to
 lose 11 seats. The Liberal Democrats this
 year have endorsed only 319 candidates.
 The party will also benefit from the ad-
 dition to its ranks of some of the
 "independents" who will be elected next
 week. Indeed, the party will probably
 need the addition of victorious in-
 dependents to achieve the necessary 271
 seats.
 Most of these candidates-generally
 conservatives who failed to gain the par-
 ty's official endorsement-are un-
 successful;  only  14  out  of  134
 "independents" were elected in 1972. This
 time, about the same number will
 probably be elected, and most will subse-
 quently  affiliate with the Liberal
 Democrats.
 One of the best known "independents"
 running this year-former prime minister
 Tanaka-is likely to win re-election easi-
 ly. Although Tanaka is portrayed as the
 villain of Lockheed, his election prospects
 clearly indicate that even such highly
 publicized national issues can have only a
 limited impact on local election contests.

 Whatever the Liberal Democratic Par-
 ty's final election totals, the results are
 certain to play a major role in the internal
 battle for leadership of the ruling party.
 Miki's opponents have tried throughout
 the summer and fall to force his resigna-
 tion. Miki's refusal to step down,
 however, and sentiment in the party that
 the leadership issue should be resolved
 after the election, forced Miki's op-
 ponents-former deputy prime minister
 Fukuda and Finance Minister Ohira-to
 put off their challenge.
 Post-Election Battle
 Fukuda and Ohira have now set the
 stage for a post-election battle with Miki.
 In late October, nearly two thirds of the
 Liberal Democrats in the Diet publicly en-
 dorsed Miki's removal and Fukuda's in-
 stallation as party president and prime
 minister. Fukuda moved into more open
 opposition by resigning his cabinet post in
 early November. Since then he and other
 anti-Miki leaders have made a change in
 party leadership a primary issue in their
 campaign.
 Miki, in turn, has emphasized his
 stewardship of the party throughout the
 Lockheed affair and his success in
 promoting Japan's economic recovery.
 The factional balance within the party
 is not likely to be directly affected by the
 leadership battle. In the anti-Miki camp,
 the Tanaka faction is the most vulnerable.
 The Fukuda faction may also lose some
 incumbencies, but neither Miki nor his
 party ally, former party secretary general
 Nakasone, seems likely to make major
 gains at their rivals' expense.
 Miki has already asserted that the elec-
 tion of 271 officially endorsed party can-
 didates-the minimum number permit-
 ting the party to control the lower
 house-will represent a personal "vic-
 tory." His opponents suggest that unless
 the party wins more than 280 seats, its
 election performance will constitute
 grounds for Miki's replacement.
 In any event, Miki is certain to face a
 serious challenge to his leadership after
 December 5 when the party deliberates on
 its new slate of cabinet officers. Then, by
 law, the entire cabinet must resign and a
 new prime minister must be elected by the
 Diet. In view of the forces arrayed against
 him, Miki could well step down voluntari-
 ly and arrange a peaceful succession. In so
 doing, he could make a graceful exit while
 perhaps preserving some influence in the
 next administration.
 The balance in the party remains
 against Miki. A recent poll of 345 Liberal
 Democratic and conservative independent
 candidates indicated that only 19 percent
 would support Miki's re-election as prime
 minister, while over 55 percent were in-
 clined toward Fukuda. Neither Miki's
 self-styled image as a political reformer
 nor the party's more general concern
 about voter reaction to the party's widely
 criticized operating style has improved his
 chances.
 The Opposition
 The Japan Socialist Party and the
 Japan Communist Party are not likely to
 make major gains in the election. The
 large number of undecided voters at this
 point in the campaign suggests that there
 may well be some increase in the strength
 of the Clean Government Party, the
 Democratic Socialist Party, and the new
 Liberal Club-a group of dissident con-
 servatives who split from the ruling party
 earlier this year.
 The battle between the Clean Govern-
 ment Party and the Japan Communist
 Party has been particularly heated this
 year because of the Clean Government
 Party's effort to win back the seats it lost
 in 1972. The representation of both par-
 ties is heavily concentrated in
 metropolitan districts.
 The Communists made dramatic gains
 in 1972 when they increased their
 membership in the lower house from 14 to
 39, and again in 1974 when they raised
 their upper house contingent from 11 to
 20.
 Still, the Communist Party finds itself
 somewhat on the defensive this year,
 which will complicate its efforts to attract
 the kind of antigovernment protest vote it
 garnered in 1972. Communist attempts to
 advance the party's "peaceful and
 democratic" image have come under
 heavy attack from the other opposition
 parties.

 The Japan Socialist Party, the largest
 opposition party, also faces problems. Its
 difficulties stem in part from a gradual
 decline in support from the younger ranks
 of the party's traditional labor union
 allies, the party's weak organization, and
 competing ideological strains within the
 party.
 The Democratic Socialist Party is like-
 ly to do little better than hold its own at
 the polls. The party's popular vote, which
 has fallen to about 7 percent, reflects the
 limits of its traditional support from the
 labor unions as well as its inability to at-
 tract promising young candidates. Even
 so, party leaders hope that the trend
 toward more moderate policy positions by
 the leftists this year will give the party a
 boost; they have clearly tried to identify
 their party as the one most likely to
 enter a coalition with the Liberal Dem-
 ocratic Party whenever the conserva-
 tives lose their majority.

 Skillful promotion of Japanese exports to the developed
 countries has helped double Japan's trade surplus since last
 year. It has also stimulated concerns in the other industrialized
 countries that could result in new trade barriers against
 Japanese goods.
 ~ ~ q I   Japan's Trade Surplus Rising Rapidly
 Since late 1975, Japan has engineered a
 successful export drive by pushing high-
 value items-cars, steel, and electronic
 products-into  developed-country
 markets.
 Data through October suggests that
 Japanese exports this year will exceed
 total 1975 overseas sales by 18 percent.
 The trade surplus is running at more than
 a $10-billion annual rate, double last
 year's level. Exports have supplied
 roughly one half of gross national product
 growth in 1976.
 Sales to developed countries have ac-
 counted for 86 percent of the rise in
 Japanese exports this year. Partly re-
 flecting the export drive, Japan has re-
 built its share of key markets in the in-
 dustrial countries to about the level of
 1972, before the oil crisis and the appre-
 ciation of the yen raised prices of Japa-
 nese exports.
 The EC Market
 In the EC, Japan's market share has
 been at least stable; in traditional
 developed-country markets such as
 Australia and New Zealand, its share has
 risen moderately.
 Japanese car sales in the US have in-
 creased at the expense of other foreign
 suppliers; retail sales of Japanese cars are
 up 7 percent this year, while those of other
 foreign makes have declined 26 percent.
 As a result, Japan's share of the foreign
 car market has jumped from 52 percent to
 61 percent. Helped by higher car
 shipments, Japan has pushed its share of
 total US imports of manufactures from
 22.6 percent in 1975 to 24.5 percent in
 1976.
 Japan has also increased its share of
 total steel exports to the US from 50 per-
 cent in 1975 to 60 percent this year.
 Japanese firms hold one third of the total
 market for television sets in the US, up
 from only 11 percent in 1975.
 Less dramatic inroads have been made
 in the EC market for cars, electronic
 products, and steel, but EC steelmakers
 are complaining that Japan is pushing
 them out of the market in smaller
 developed countries.
 In late 1975, Japan was in the best posi-
 tion to boost sales to the US and other
 key developed countries because of 'its
 superior marketing system. While Euro-
 pean  automobile manufacturers-par-
 ticularly Volkswagen-were cutting back
 outlets in 1974 and 1975, Toyota, Honda,
 and Nissan were increasing both the
 number of outlets and showroom space.
 The Japanese auto firms also apparent-
 ly benefited from US consumer resistance
 to the sharp rise in Volkswagen prices and
 to the new line of models replacing the
 Beetle.
 Japanese electronics firms have concen-
 trated on the lucrative 19-inch color TV
 market. To increase sales of televisions,
 Japanese firms teamed up with leading
 US retailers-Sears, JC Penney, and
 Montgomery Ward-and now produce 80
 percent of the portable color TVs
 marketed under these labels. Japanese
 firms also supply sets and components to
 brand-name producers such as
 Magnavox.
 Trading Firm Subsidiaries
 Japanese producers-particularly of
 steel, textiles, and machinery-have made
 extensive use of rapidly expanding
 Japanese trading firm subsidiaries both in
 the US and Europe. Since 1970, nearly
 500 subsidiaries have been established in
 the  US, mainly wholesale dis-
 tributorships. Many of these outlets
 accept lower profit markups to increase
 sales.
 In response to the recent world
 economic downturn, Japanese firms were
 first to cut export prices to key markets
 well below their competitors. Export

 prices, for example, dropped 21 percent in
 dollar terms from early 1975 until early
 1976. Japanese steelmakers cut prices
 roughly $80 per ton for the US market.
 Japanese traders have not taken advan-
 tage of economic recovery by rapidly in-
 creasing export prices. In September, yen
 prices were still 5 percent below what they
 were at the peak in the fourth quarter of
 1974. In contrast, West German export
 prices (in national currency) increased 6
 percent over the same period. A
 depreciating yen exchange rate also con-
 tributed to Japan's market com-
 petitiveness in late 1975.
 Japanese traders are concerned that
 they are approaching their peak share of
 present consumption for key exports.
 Assuming US consumer tastes continue
 to lean toward the medium-sized car, the
 Japanese car industry would have to cut
 further into other foreign sales just to hold
 its current share of US consumption.
 US Production Facilities
 Partly to avoid trade barriers and
 counter rising production costs at home,
 Japanese firms have been acquiring
 production facilities in the US. The
 Japanese have already shifted some
 production of ball bearings, steel items,
 and textiles. Toyota is considering a plant
 in the US, but will probably delay a deci-
 sion at least until 1978.
 Japan will face new trade barriers if it
 continues to make inroads in industrial
 country markets. Formal and informal
 studies are under way in the US covering
 Japanese sales of steel, television sets, and
 other products. The EC has been putting
 pressure on Japan to reduce its trade sur-
 plus with Western Europe, and some
 members have threatened unilateral ac-
 tion against Japanese exports. The EC
 will issue a declaration this week simply
 noting some progress on EC-Japanese
 trade problems.
 If foreign pressure continues to mount,
 we expect Japan to try to secure orderly
 marketing agreements that will allow its
 industry to hold on to as much of its ex-
 panded markets as possible. Tokyo may
 impose selected unilateral restraints on its
 key exporters, as it has done in the past.
 Electronics firms already have restrictions
 on sales of many individual items in the
 UK; the steel industry recently agreed to
 extend limits on shipments to the EC
 through 1977.
 The government has agreed to
 stimulate imports of processed food and
 tobacco products from the EC. Most
 businessmen, however, are openly skep-
 tical about the long-run success of a plan
 to boost purchases from the Community
 because EC manufactured goods are
 heavily weighted toward capital equip-
 ment, which Japan now imports mainly
 from the US. So far, Tokyo has giver25X1
 only limited ground on nontariff barriers,
 and those mainly in the auto trade area.
