 DEVELOPING AND INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY REACTIONS TO CIEC:
 IMPLICATIONS FOR NORTH-SOUTH RELATIONS.  .  .  .  .  .
 Most participants in CIEC appear to be gener-
 aZly satisfied with the outcome of the confer-
 ence;                        a wide gap persists, however, between
 what the LDCs are demanding and what the in-
 dustrialized states are willing or able to con-
 cede.
 CHINA AND NORTH-SOUTH RELATIONS  .  .  .  .  .
 China uses the North-South dialogue as one of
 many diplomatic instruments in its efforts to
 mobilize support against the Soviet Union;
 China's interest in the substance of the LDCs'
 economic demands is decidedly secondary.

 The articles in this section of International Issues
 build on analyses published in the April, May, and June
 editions of this publication.  The present articles ex-
 amine:
 -The state of North-South relations halfway between
 the conclusion of the Conference on International
 Economic Cooperation and the meeting of the UN
 General Assembly.
 -The internal and external dynamics of one of the
 emerging regional forums in which a large portion
 of the North-South dialogue will probably be carried
 out in the future.
 In the coming months we will continue to analyze the
 role of key actors and institutions involved in the North-
 South dialogue and seek to illuminate the relationships
 and linkages between the LDCs' economic demands and other
 economic and political issues that affect and are affected
 by them.

 Developing and Industrial Country Reactions to CIEC:
 Implications for North-South Relations
 This is the first of two planned articles that will
 explore prospects for this fall's round of UN-sponsored
 North-South meetings.   The focus here is on the implica-
 tions of the conclusion to the final ministerial meeting
 of the Conference on International Economic Cooperation
 (CIEC)  for the negotiating strategies of the industrial-
 ized and developing countries.   Next month,  the focus
 will be on the nature of the issues Likely  to be raised
 at these UN meetings, and their potential impact on re-
 cent US initiatives on North-South relations.
 Developing Country Reaction to CIEC
 The reactions of the developing countries to the
 conclusion of CIEC reflect a growing pragmatism about
 negotiations with the industrialized countries and about
 the likelihood of actually achieving a "New International
 Economic Order"  (NIEO).   Especially when it comes to the
 latter,  there is a striking degree of acknowledgement by
 LDCs that the NIEO as presently formulated is unrealistic
 and probably unattainable,  and that continued insistence
 on it may prove damaging to what can be achieved.   Few
 LDCs now expect OPEC to lend substantial support to LDC
 demands for an NIEO, moreover, and most appear to recog-
 nize the limits on bloc solidarity imposed by the clash
 of national economic interests over such key issues as
 the UNCTAD Integrated Program on commodities and auto-
 matic debt-relief schemes.
 The most immediate testing ground of the pragmatism
 of the LDCs will be,  first,  the reconvened 31st UN Gen-
 eral Assembly which will meet for four days in mid-Sep-.
 tember to formally review the results of CIEC and, sec-
 ond, the 32nd General Assembly (scheduled for September
 through December.)  Despite the present atmosphere of

 accommodation in North-South relations, there still exists
 a considerable gap between the expectations and demands
 of even the more moderate LDCs and the concessions most
 industrialized countries are willing to make.   This gap
 will continue to represent a source of tension and strain
 in UN politics.
 Within the LDC camp, there are widely different in-
 terpretations of what was achieved at CIEC, especially
 over the issue of establishing a common fund, and this
 will inevitably lead to charges by some LDCs of industrial
 country "backsliding" when the round of UNCTAD-sponsored
 negotiations resumes late this fall.   Moreover, the UNCTAD
 leadership  (particularly Secretary General Gamani Corea)
 has branded CIEC a failure, and blamed the intransigence
 and behind-the-scenes maneuvering of the industrialized
 countries for the lack of progress on most key NIEO is-
 sues.   Corea and other third world spokesmen have called
 on the Group of 77  (G-77)--the LDC caucus--to formulate
 a negotiating strategy for future conferences that would
 minimize the internal differences that were exploited
 by the industrialized countries at CIEC.   Also recommended
 is the formation of a "producers-exporters council" to
 increase LDC leverage at upcoming commodity negotiations.
 There are, moreover, unconfirmed reports of interest on
 the part of some OPEC countries  (e.g., Venezuela and Ku-
 wait)  in financing the establishment of such a council.
 Finally, some of the more advanced and rapidly growing
 LDCs appear to have reacted negatively to recent US ini-
 tiatives at the UN's Economic and Social Council to ad-
 vance a strategy in response to NIEO that would concen-
 trate on satisfying the "Basic Human Needs" of the world's
 poor.
 Nevertheless, the US may be heading toward a General
 Assembly session where the key issues will be less polit-
 icized by events and developments in North-South relations
 than any held since 1970.   The preparatory meetings of
 the G-77 suggest that most LDCs appear to prefer to con-
 tinue using nonconfrontational tactics to achieve their
 demand for increased transfers of resources from the in-
 dustrialized countries and especially for establishment
 of a common fund to finance commodity buffer stocks and
 to improve LDC terms of trade.   In contrast to past
 years, when highly politicized General Assembly sessions
 were considered by the LDCs as essential to maintaining

 the momentum behind the North-South dialogue,  spokesmen
 for developing countries now feel that such a session
 would adversely affect prospects for the negotiations
 on a common fund and other issues planned for this fall.
 The LDCs ate also concerned lest a return to confronta-
 tion alienate the US at a time when its policies toward
 North-South relations are under review.
 The preoccupation of some key "radicals"  (e.g., Al-
 geria) with domestic problems,  the change of administration
 in others  (e.g., Mexico), and the desire on the part of
 many to have smoother relations with individual indus-
 trialized countries,  also have contributed to the LDCs'
 downplaying of confrontational tactics at the UN.   Such
 radicals remain interested in substantive changes in the
 international economic order, but for the moment they
 appear to accord systemic change a relatively low pri-
 ority in foreign policy for 1977.   The lower profile of
 most radicals,  in addition, has given the more moderate
 LDCs--who have consistently favored a nonconfrontation.al
 approach to North-South relations--a higher leadership
 profile in the G-77 than at any time in the past.
 Currently the moderates themselves are far from
 being of one mind about priorities and commitment to the
 G-77.   Some  (e.g.,  India) believe that tangible progress
 toward resource transfers for the world's poorest coun-
 tries is now essential,  and that the G-77 should aim at
 achieving greater pledges of aid especially from OPEC
 countries.    Others  (e.g.,  Indonesia and the Philippines)
 appear to believe that the common fund is a symbol of
 such paramount political importance to G-77 solidarity
 that it should receive priority attention.   At the same
 time, many moderates  (as the article on page 25 suggests)
 have also turned to regional forums in the hope that
 greater progress toward their goals in the areas of trade
 preferences,  technology transfer, and regulations on the
 activities of multinational corporations can be made out-
 side the cumbersome framework of the G-77.
 But regardless of their differences over priorities
 and venues, the moderates will especially look to what
 the industrialized countries are actually prepared to
 do in response to LDC demands.   Many believe that for
 the current nonconfrontational atmosphere to continue, the
 North-South dialogue must now produce tangible results

 appealing to a broad range of LDCs.   Thus,  regardless
 of what happens at the UN this fall, the moderates are
 likely to put  heavy  and persistent pressures on the in-
 dustrialized countries over the next few months to ad-
 dress those North-South issues on which little progress
 was made at CIEC.
 Industrialized Country Unity
 Most industrialized countries considered CIEC a
 qualified success.   They succeeded in meeting their pri-
 mary goal of avoiding a confrontation with the LDCs and
 conceded relatively little in exchange.   The agreement
 to participate in negotiations on the establishment of a
 common fund,  for example, did not tie the industrialized
 states to a specific plan,  let alone the $6 billion com-
 mon fund proposed by the UNCTAD Secretariat.
 Some industrialized states were concerned about the
 failure of the conference to establish an ongoing energy
 dialogue.   Most agree, however,  that the concessions that
 would have been necessary to obtain further energy talks
 would have been excessive.   Some members of the govern-
 ment and most of the political opposition in West Germany
 have actually complained that too many concessions were
 made at CIEC,* but the only Dutch and Scandanavian govern-
 ments--among the industrialized states--have expressed dis-
 pleasure at the lack of sufficient progress by the CIEC
 on issues of basic interest to the LDCs.
 One point on which all of the industrialized coun-
 tries at CIEC have agreed is that the preservation of a
 nonconfrontational atmosphere at CIEC is attributable in
 large part to their ability to maintain a united front
 during the CIEC ministerial meeting.   The industrialized
 states have long perceived the tactical benefits of a
 united position in negotiations with the LDCs, but until
 CIEC,  a common program and agreed set of strategies and
 tactics had eluded them.
 The article on page  7 analyzes pressures on the
 West German foreign policy making process on North-
 South issues.

 The industrialized states are likely to concentrate
 during the next several months on maintaining that unity
 while further developing a common negotiating position
 for talks with the LDCs.   Reaction to a US proposal to
 continue consultations among the eight industrialized
 participants at CIEC* in preparation for economic talks
 in UN bodies this fall has been favorably received.   The
 Group of,8 has been a more effective caucusing forum than
 the full OECD meetings, and while some of the smaller
 OECD states who are not directly represented in the G-8
 have opposed the US proposal, most of the EC states have
 endorsed it.   France has expressed some reservations be-
 cause,  as usual, it is concerned with the level and au-
 thority of the EC spokesman in the caucuses; but the
 Giscard government will probably not block establishment
 of the group.
 An expanded Canadian role in North-South negotia-
 tions will also contribute to greater unity.   Long shut
 out of what it considers a rightful place in international
 economic decision-making, Ottawa is taking full advantage
 of its position as cochairman of the CIEC to insist on
 a major Canadian role in future North-South talks.   More-
 over, the similarity in Canadian interests--as a major
 exporter of raw materials--with the interests of raw
 material exporting LDCs has convinced the Canadian govern-
 ment that it can serve as a bridge between the industri-
 alized and developing worlds.
 Notwithstanding the drive for unity there will con-
 tinue to be pressures on the governments in industrialized
 countries for following distinct rather than common pol-
 icies toward the LDCs.**  During the next several months
 the most important of these factors will be the percep-
 tion of the degree of confrontation that may develop
 as the G-77 reconsiders its goals and strategies.   The
 more likely a confrontation, the greater the strains on

 policy during this period, because most will want to
 isolate themselves from the US position--and the attendant
 criticism from LDCs--if they believe that LDCs will react
 negatively to US initiatives.
 The tendency to follow separate paths could also be
 accelerated by a number of noneconomic issues that have
 a North-South orientation.   Among these could be a clash
 over Southern African or Middle Eastern issues.   The
 pending US decision on a possible withdrawal from the
 International Labor Organization is another political
 issue which could raise tensions between the North and
 South.   The perennial questions over the status of the
 two Koreas and the alleged colonial status of Puerto
 Rico are further examples of developments that could
 cloud the atmosphere of talks on economic issues.
 Conclusions
 The general atmosphere of accommodation that has
 been developing in North-South relations, the moves for
 accommodation by key LDCs, and the efforts to maintain
 unity among industrialized countries, should not obscure
 the fact that there exists, and will continue to exist,
 large differences between what the LDCs are demanding--
 economically and politically--and what the industrialized
 countries are willing or able to grant.   Thus, while the
 overall level of tension between North and South will
 probably not increase during the next six months, the in-
 evitably slow progress of talks in the common fund, debt,
 aid, and other LDC demands, will threaten the atmosphere
 in multilateral forums and could in the long run, rein-
 force the growing tendency on the part of some LDCs and
 industrialized countries to increasingly resort to bila-
 teral or regional relationships as an alternative to a
 full scale North-South dialogue.

 China and North-South Relations
 China's interest in the contentious issues between
 the developing and industrial countries is distinctly
 secondary to its interest in using North-South relations.
 as part of its overall foreign policy effort to constrain
 Soviet power and influence.   Thus,  the Chinese seek si-
 muZtaneously to bolster (1) their reputation as a more
 effective supporter of LDC causes   than the USSR,  and (2)
 the strength of the industrial democracies as a counter-
 weight to Soviet power.
 Often,  in the North-South context,  the Chinese lend
 rhetorical support to LDC demands against the industrial
 states.    But at times Peking acts behind the scenes as if
 it supports compromises.   Insofar as the US is also working
 to reduce North-South tensions,  the Chinese are unlikely
 to take steps--rhetoric aside--to complicate matters.
 Furthermore, when North-South initiatives are taken either
 to embarrass or to isolate the USSR in UN politics,  China
 can be expected to endorse such efforts.
 China's Stake in North-South Relations
 Peking accords minimal priority engagement in the
 negotiations between developing and industrial states
 over a New International Economic Order  (NIEO).   China
 participates in UN sessions that address questions such
 as debt relief, commodity support,  and increased aid to
 the LDCs.   China, however, is not a member of the most
 influential caucus of developing states--the Group of
 77--that formulates LDC negotiating postures.   Nor did
 China participate in the Conference on International Eco-
 nomic Cooperation in Paris, which has set the tone for
 the next round of economic talks between industrialized
 and developing nations.
 The issues involved in the North-South dialogue are
 exploited by China primarily to bolster the political
 aspects of its foreign policy, although the dialogue is
 perceived to have some long term economic potential for

 enhancing its world position.   Since the 1955 Bandung
 Conference of Afro-Asian Nations, the Chinese have stressed
 Mao Tse-tung's view that a "common bond" of anticolonialism
 and anti-imperialism exists between China and the develop-
 ing countries.   Although Peking's relations with individual
 LDCs have waxed and waned,  it has consistently sought to
 exploit what are perceived to be mutual interests in al-
 tering the international system.   China's political and
 psychological appeals and its economic assistance pro-
 grams to the developing states are intended to support
 China's goal of diffusing superpower influence globally,
 to enhance China's diplomatic and political influence at
 the lowest cost to Peking, and to encourage the LDCs
 to accept China's ideological leadership.   China is ex-
 tremely reluctant, however, to participate in international
 agreements which might restrict its freedom to maneuver.
 China's Foreign and Domestic Priorities
 The Chinese have used meetings of UN agencies and
 of the General Assembly as platforms from which to try to
 discredit the Soviet Union's emphasis on East-West con-
 flict in the eyes of governments which believe that the
 need to redress the world economic balance is the para-
 mount global issue.   China,  for instance, supports the
 common LDC view that the USSR should be treated as a.
 "northern" industrial country with attendant responsi-
 bilities for concessions to LDCs on important economic
 issues.   Moreover,  the Chinese argue that the socialist
 bloc no longer exists and that Moscow's contention that
 East-West cleavage is the fundamental source of world
 tensions is a subterfuge to resist significant economic
 change.
 The Chinese also use UN economic sessions, from time
 to time, as forums to court Western Europe and Japan to
 plead for mutual cooperation between them and the develop-
 ing countries in resisting perceived Soviet global de-
 signs.   Peking's formula for explaining its insistent
 advocacy of cooperation between the developing states
 and the "imperialists" is that Western Europe and Japan
 are the core of a "second world" whose interests are
 distinct from the "first world" of the superpowers.
 Hence Peking commended the joint French-Moroccan-Egyptian
 intervention in Zaire as an excellent example of the po-
 tential inherent in "second" and "third" world coopera-
 tion against superpower threats.

 Indeed, China believes that Western Europe and Japan
 are an important counterweight to the expansion of Soviet
 power.   To curry European and Japanese favor, China has
 given assurances that it disapproves of the formation of
 resource cartels aimed against their interests.   China
 is apparently concerned that the economic disorder that
 would result from LDC collective economic pressure, simi-
 lar to the OPEC oil boycott of 1973, could adversely af-
 fect the European and Japanese economies, diluting their
 willingness and ability to resist Soviet military or po-
 litical maneuvers in Europe and East Asia.   Peking has
 given rhetorical support to raw materials cartels in or-
 der to bolster its  position in the third world, but it
 has not joined such cartels or lent them effective sup-
 port.
 China's increased emphasis on acquisition of foreign
 technology for modernization also encourages Peking to
 adopt a tolerant attitude toward the so-called second
 world countries.   China's leaders have facilitated trade
 expansion with the industrial democracies by enlargement
 of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and appointment of ex-
 perienced personnel to the ministry.   Moreover, Peking
 has seriously considered establishing long-term trade
 relations with Europe and Japan and has held talks with
 European and Japanese financial circles regarding import
 financing.
 LDC Perceptions of China
 Many LDC leaders doubt China's commitment to their
 cause in the North-South dialogue and perceive a gap be-
 tween their interests in a NIEO and those of the Chinese.
 On one level, China has long given rhetorical support to
 the developing countries'  collective grievances against
 the wealthier states concerning inequitable global eco-
 nomic conditions.   Peking's policies are intended to ab-
 solve the poor countries of direct responsibilities for
 their plight, and to place the industrial states--espe-
 cially the US and the USSR--in a defensive position.
 Basic differences between China and the LDCs, however,
 were already evident during the formulation of LDC views
 on the NIEO.   The Chinese voted only reluctantly for the
 UN Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States in
 1974,  saying that they were upset by what they felt were
 Soviet contributions to the document.   The Chinese felt

 Approved For Release 2007/03/(cfA-RDP79T00912A002300010005-9
 Soviet efforts had watered-down the text and they char-
 acterized the Charter as partly "irrational" and "com-
 promising."
 The concern with maintaining their political in-
 fluence with LDCs contributed to the 1976 Chinese assur-
 ance to Gamani Corea, the Secretary General of UNCTAD,
 that Peking would assist the developing states in gain-
 ing their NIEO objectives.   Later Chinese support of pro-
 posals to strengthen UNCTAD at the expense of the General
 Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and to revamp the UN in-
 stitutionally, were also probably reflections of Peking's
 attempt to mollify key LDC leaders.
 However, as previously indicated, China has refused
 to participate in organizations of producers of raw ma-
 terials, apparently unwilling to compromise its national
 interest.   Furthermore,  in 1976 when world prices for
 tin were extremely low, China--a major producer--coinci-
 dentally increased its production, contributing to a
 market surplus.   Malaysia and other members of the Inter-
 national Tin Council were upset by the Chinese action,
 but were unable to pursuade China either to cut production
 or to join the cartel.   Similarly,  although many develop-
 ing states believe that the United Nations Industrial
 Development Organization  (UNIDO)  is a major vehicle to
 promote national industrialization programs, the Chinese
 have said they will decrease their support of UNIDO.
 China explains its behavior by referring to its long-
 standing "principles" of national "self-reliance" and
 protection of its natural resources from outside inter-
 ference.
 Thus, the developing states are skeptical of China's
 desire for freedom of action in world markets and its
 unwillingness to modify autarkic policies in favor of
 contributing to LDC economic power and development proj-
 ects.                            Many LDCs are also critical of Peking's unwilling-
 ness to participate in multilateral forums that might
 subject China's interests to a wide spectrum of in-
 fluences.   Finally, the Chinese are exceedingly reluctant
 to take substantive positions on issues on which the
 LDCs themselves disagree, such as loan moratoriums,  since
 China would then have less flexibility in appealing to
 the third world to support its own foreign policy ob-
 jectives.

 On another level, China's economic assistance to
 the LDCs--low-key projects in agriculture, transportation,
 health, and light industry, with short gestation periods,
 and low interest or interest free loans--has been well-
 received by the poorest developing states.                                           Ostensibly
 such aid is based on Peking's general belief that the
 developing states should offer each other mutual support
 and assistance.   But other developing states have been
 critical of China's practice of restricting its aid to
 countries that Peking believes will join its anti-Soviet
 crusade.   Similarly,  although China in principle exhorts
 the LDCs to strive for regional autonomy, it tends to
 assess the merit of regional experiments by the degree
 to which the influence of the superpowers  (especially
 the Soviet Union)  is obstructed.
 Conclusion
 In general, China's perceived national security
 need to contain the power and influence of the Soviet
 Union will probably cause it to continue to seek low-
 cost ways to retain or even expand its third world con-
 nections.   Over the next several years, the Chinese can
 be expected to maintain a low profile in the North-South
 dialogue except where a substantive position would help
 gain support for Chinese political positions at the ex-
 pense of the superpowers--especially the USSR--and, at
 the same time, not involve economic costs to China.   Thus,
 China should view favorably US efforts to reduce North-
 South tensions  (this, from the Chinese viewpoint, would
 strengthen ties between the "second" and "third" world
 at superpower--i.e., Soviet--expense).   Also, the Chinese
 should support enthusiastically any efforts to embarrass
 the USSR because of its relative inattention to LDC eco-
 nomic problems.

 Saudi Arabia:   Views of CIEC and the North-South Dialogue
 Saudi Arabia was encouraged by the results of the
 recent Conference on international Economic Cooperation
 (CIEC) negotiations held in Paris.   A Saudi observer of
 the negotiations noted that the North-South dialogue had
 come a long way,  primarily because the US has adopted a
 more realistic attitude toward the developing world and
 has shown an interest in redressing some of the economic
 imbalances facing the developing countries.
 The Saudis feel that a major problem now facing the
 dialogue is to reduce the expectations of the underdevel-
 oped world to a more realistic level.   Saudi Arabia be-
 lieves that some of the economic problems faced by the
 developing nations can be alleviated, but that an immedi-
 ate and dramatic reversal of what the LDCs consider to
 be historic inequities is unrealistic and should not be
 expected.   The Saudis believe that LDC demands should be
 met within the context of a greater share of the growth
 in world products,  and not simply by a redistribution of
 existing wealth.
 Saudi attitudes toward CIEC and the North-South
 dialogue have been ambivalent for the past few years.
 Their historical, social, cultural and, to some extent,
 political sympathies are with the LDCs.   Since the oil
 embargo of 1973-74, however, Saudi Arabia's enormous
 wealth, combined with its long-term political friendship
 with the US, has caused the Saudis to identify increas-
 ingly with the economic and political views of Western
 industrial countries.
 Riyadh wants to keep the dialogue alive.   The Saudis
 believe that by supporting the dialogue, they enhance
 their third world credentials with other developing
 countries, and prevent, or at least dissipate, charges
 that they are acting as a stalking horse for the US or
 the developed countries in general.   Saudi Arabia's third
 world rhetoric on the duties of the industrialized states
 toward the LDCs is combined, however, with a marked de-
 fensiveness over its peculiar status as a developing
 country that has recently become extremely wealthy.

 Supporting the North-South talks costs the Saudis
 little and produces certain benefits for them.   They have
 been able to accomplish some of their broader international
 objectives--UN support for Arab positions on Middle East
 issues, for example--by using the implicit threat of ex-
 ercising their economic leverage against the North.   The
 developing countries, moreover,  are well aware that this
 Saudi leverage is essential to any progress in the general
 North-South dialogue.
 Some Saudi officials are concerned, however, that
 the dialogue may not be meeting Saudi Arabia's broader
 objectives.   One ranking Saudi official and observer of
 CIEC trends and prospects noted that Communist countries
 were most likely to gain from the CIEC talks.   At a
 minimum, he thought that the demands and expectations
 fostered by CIEC among the LDCs would put Western in-
 dustrialized countries on the defensive, thereby presumably
 undermining their collective economic unity and political
 strength.   At worse, he thought that a failure of the
 talks would net the Communists even greater gain because
 of the resultant radicalization of the LDCs' positions.
 Despite press reports and occasional public state-
 ments by Saudi Oil Minister Yamani, we have no reason to
 believe that the Saudis ever seriously considered tying
 their oil price decisions in OPEC to results at the re-
 cent CIEC negotiations.   The recent Saudi decision to
 compromise with other OPEC members on oil prices was
 based on factors other than progress in the North-South
 dialogue or CIEC, although some propaganda points may
 have been scored by emphasizing the link between the two.*

 Arab States:   Scientific and Technical Cooperation
 Most Arab states have established bodies to formu-
 late national science policy,  and they have taken steps
 through the Arab League,  to mobilize scientific and tech-
 nological resources.                              These efforts are hampered by lack
 of commitment and understanding on the part of many
 officials, wide differences in resources among the various
 states, and shortages of trained personnel.   Despite
 official rhetoric, most Arab leaders still prefer to hire
 whatever expertise they need from the industrial states,
 which undercuts programs  to build an indigenous technical
 base.   Although limited, Arab efforts  to form common
 science and technology policies for research and devellop-
 ment should aid the Arab states in presenting a united
 regional position on North-South issues.
 Arab policymakers often say that science and tech-
 nology are important for development, but they frequently
 lack the technical sophistication to comprehend how to
 relate science to development needs.   Established scien-
 tific institutions do not yet play a significant role in
 development decisions, and national budget allocations
 for scientific and technical research are small.   Even
 rich countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, whose
 officials pay lip service to the importance of developing
 a technical capability, are likely to hire outsiders to
 supply the expertise when they want a project done.
 Egypt and Jordan provide two typical examples of
 science policy formulation in the Arab states.   The Egyp-
 tian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology, es-
 tablished in 1971, is the fifth in a series of institutions
 created to formulate Egyptian science policy.   In 1976,
 the academy sponsored 120 research projects related
 t  n
 to
 national problems.   Its efforts to direct more Egyp
 scientific efforts to industry-sponsored contract research
 have been hampered, however, by resistance from scientists
 and by lack of funds, facilities, and specialized training.

 The Jordanian Royal Scientific Society has worked
 since 1971 with the National Planning Council in an effort
 to develop industry and technology within the framework
 of a larger development plan.   After six years, however,
 there is an admitted lack of program coordination, and
 problems exist with duplication of effort among various
 groups.   The experiences of the science policy organiza-
 tions of Lebanon, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, and Tunisia are
 variations on the same theme.
 Comparable problems will undoubtedly handicap efforts
 under way among Arab nations to mobilize and coordinate
 their scientific and technological resources.   There are
 wide differences in resources among Arab states, and the
 majority lack trained personnel, a major obstacle to
 implementing programs.   Any regional effort would be
 dominated by the one or two states who could contribute
 most of the funds and personnel.   These states could as
 easily pursue their interests independently.
 Despite the difficulties, the attempts at cooperation
 are potentially significant.   The first conference of the
 ministers of Arab states responsible for the application
 of science and technology to development--co-sponsored by
 UNESCO and the Arab League--was held in Rabat in August
 1976.   The most important result was the creation a $500-
 million Arab science and technology research fund to sup-
 port programs in five areas--water resources, nonconven-
 tional energy, marine and coast development, geological
 studies, and ecology of arid lands.   There is no evidence,
 however, that any participant has committed itself to
 supply a specific amount of money and no firm information
 about how much,  if any, money has been paid into the fund
 so far.
 Even if the ministers'  conference achieves no produc-
 tive research and development cooperation, however, it
 could still play an important international political role,
 particularly in the debate on North-South issues.   The
 final declaration of the Rabat conference stated that the
 next ministers'  conference would develop a unified Arab

 ASEAN:   Filling a Gap After the Dissolution of SEATO
 The official dissolution of the Southeast Asia
 Treaty Organization  (SEATO)  last month emphasized the
 significant transformation of political perceptions and
 relationships in Southeast Asia that has taken place in
 recent years.   Established by the Manila Treaty in 1954,
 SEATO was a response to fears of Chinese expansion in
 the wake of the Korean War and the Communist victory in
 North Vietnam.   Detente,  the US opening to China,  and
 signs of growing US disillusionment with entangling mil-
 itary commitments in Asia influenced the non-Communist
 nations in Southeast Asia to drift toward rapprochement
 with China and North Vietnam in the early  1970s.    Now
 they see the long-term prospects for regional security
 best served by engaging Vietnam in cooperative ventures
 while keeping US military power out of sight, but close
 at hand.
 The Communist victories in Indochina accelerated
 the decline of SEATO.   By mid-1975, with the withdrawal
 of British military forces east of Suez an accomplished
 fact and the protective US umbrella seemingly less reli-
 able, the Southeast Asian governments felt pressed to
 come to terms with their victorious Communist neighbors.
 The decision to phase out SEATO was made in Septem-
 ber 1975 by the six remaining members--the US, the UK,
 Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand.
 The Philippines and Thailand, which were attempting to
 normalize relations with China and North Vietnam, re-
 quested the move.   France and Pakistan, original sig-
 natories of the pact, had pulled out earlier.
 Post-SEATO Alignments

 The states of Southeast Asia are suspicious of
 Vietnam's intentions and eager to preserve a continuing
 US military commitment in the region.   Only Malaysia has
 argued for a total withdrawal of all Western military
 forces from the region, and in the past year or so it
 has pulled back from actively pushing this position.
 The US bases in the Philippines are viewed by Ma-
 nila's neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian
 Nations  (ASEAN)  as an essential element for stability
 in the region, and they have acknowledged President
 Marcos' special role as principal spokesman for the
 ASEAN states'  security ties with the US.   This does not
 preclude efforts by Indonesia and Thailand to secure bi-
 lateral military assistance and favorable credit terms
 from the US for military purchases.    Thailand, in par-
 ticular, has sought specific reassurances that US com-
 mitments to Thailand's defense under the Manila Treaty
 and the Rusk-Thanat agreement are still in force.
 The end of the Vietnam war has modified relation-
 ships on the Communist side as well.   Hanoi has broken
 out of the relative isolation imposed by the war and is
 trying to carve out a broader and more independent role
 in international affairs.   Although the USSR and China
 never obtained much leverage over Hanoi from their aid,
 the Vietnamese leaders are nonetheless sensitive about
 their dependent relationship and are trying to reduce it
 by broadening their political and economic ties as much
 as possible.
 Hanoi has been surprisingly successful in attract-
 ing Western aid, but the greatest amount of economic
 assistance still comes from the USSR, China, and Eastern
 Europe and argues for the preservation of a carefully
 balanced relationship with Vietnam's wartime allies.
 Vietnam's post-war links with China have been
 strained as territorial disputes and signs of a growing
 competition for influence in the region have come to the
 surface.   Sino-Vietnamese differences have been kept
 within careful bounds, however, and recent visits of
 senior Vietnamese officials to China--and the warm wel-
 come they received--indicate they are trying to restore
 a more cordial relationship.

 Hanoi's dream of an Indochinese federation under
 Vietnamese influence has been frustrated by the prickly
 independence of the Communist regime in Cambodia.   Laos,
 on the other hand, has clearly become a malleable client
 and an occasional stalking horse for Vietnamese foreign
 policy.
 China's entrenched presence in the northern Laotian
 provinces along its border has not been challenged,  al-
 though the official Soviet mission in Laos has grown
 substantially to between 400 and 600.  Vietnam's inter-
 ests and influence are still predominant in Laos, how-
 ever, and Vietnam's determination to control this buffer
 state and corridor to Thailand is reflected by the fact
 that at least 20,000 Vietnamese troops are now in Laos.
 An Emerging ASEAN
 There is clearly a new sense of regionalism in
 Southeast Asia, although its practical manifestations
 are emerging slowly.   ASEAN was created in 1967, but re-
 mained a very flaccid organization until Hanoi's victory
 and the retrenchment of US power shocked ASEAN's members--
 Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand,  and Singa-
 pore-.-into a determined effort to make the organization
 more viable.
 Despite their underlying fears of Vietnamese aggres-
 sion, the ASEAN leaders have noted that the more signifi-
 cant Communist challenge is internal--festering Communist
 insurgencies and other dissident movements which could
 grow beyond control if underlying socio-economic problems
 are not adequately tackled.
 The Bali summit conference in February 1976 was the
 first meeting of the five ASEAN heads of government.   It
 underlined a commitment to economic cooperation along
 with resolutions to eliminate subversive threats and to
 work for the early establishment of a "Zone of Peace,
 Freedom, and Neutrality."   Economic cooperation faces
 significant stumbling blocks largely because the ASEAN
 economies, except for that of mercantile-industrial
 Singapore, are similar and competitive rather than com-
 plementary.

 A framework for cooperation has nonetheless been
 established, and modest progress is being made toward
 implementing a preferential trade accord and parceling
 out development projects among the member states.   The
 ASEAN members are anxious to enlist US and Japanese par-
 ticipation in regional development plans.   They see US
 involvement as not only balancing what would otherwise
 be a dominant Japanese presence, but also as a symbol of
 continuing US interest in the region.
 ASEAN is also attempting to organize a common ne-
 gotiating position on trade and aid to gain more lever-
 age with Japan, the US, and the EC.   The second ASEAN
 summit takes place in August and should be a better meas-
 ure of ASEAN's progress.
 While the emphasis in ASEAN is clearly on economic
 cooperation, there has been a notable increase in low-
 profile bilateral collaboration on security matters out-
 side the formal ASEAN framework.   This is largely re-
 stricted to
 occasional Joint exercises,   u recent    ai- a aysian
 operations against the insurgents in southern Thailand
 demonstrate the sense of common concern that is sub-
 merging the rivalries and suspicions that have plagued
 regional relationships in the past.
 Military cooperation is not likely to go much be-
 yond this.   Old memories die hard, and the confrontation
 between Malaysia and Indonesia in the mid-1960s, Malay-
 sia's past involvement in the Muslim insurgency in the
 southern Philippines, Thai suspicions of Malaysian sym-
 pathy and support for Malay separatism in Thailand, and
 the enduring ethnic tensions between Malay, Chinese, and
 Thai have left residues of mistrust.   These old sores
 will continue to restrain cooperation--as will the desire
 of ASEAN members to avoid confrontation with Indochina.
 The ASEAN states have made a conscious effort to
 avoid creating the impression that ASEAN is or could be-
 come a new military alignment against Hanoi.   ASEAN cau-
 tion indicates that a military pact would only provoke
 the Vietnamese without providing sufficient security
 against Vietnamese aggression.  1          -1

 US-Asean Relations and the North-South Dialogue
 In the past year,  the Association of Southeast Asian
 Nations  (ASEAN)  has shown signs of developing into an or-
 ganization that can promote intra-regional cooperation,
 including a united approach to international economic issues.
 The ASEAN members have approached their major economic
 partners among the industrial nations--Japan,  US,  EC,
 Australia,  New Zealand,  and Canada--and sought to improve
 their terms of trade and to promote assistance for regional
 development.   The second ASEAN summit meeting in Kuala
 Lumpur on August 4-6 will undoubtedly evaluate the prog-
 ress of these negotiations in preparation for a series
 of dialogues on issues of regional interest to be held with
 Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the US immediately
 after the summit.
 Expectations that ASEAN can function as a regional
 negotiating forum for the entire spectrum of North-South
 issues,  however,  would be premature at this time.   ASEAN
 internal unity will continue to be strained by disagree-
 ments over the pace and scope of regional cooperation it-
 self,  as well as over the specific goals to be pursued in
 negotiations with the industrial nations.   These strains
 will complicate any corporate ASEAN negotiations with
 industrial countries on North-South issues,  as will the
 current debate among the ASEAN states over the desirability
 and costs of maintaining LDC solidarity in the next phase
 of the North-South dialogue.
 In particular,  at the negotiations with the US sched-
 uled for September in Manila,  the ASEAN states are likely
 to be cool toward discussion of those North-South issues
 (for example,  commodities,  debt relief,  institutional
 reform)  that might appear either to conflict with posi-
 tions developed by the LDC negotiating caucus  (the Group
 of 77),  or to signal a softening of the developing countries'
 demands for a New International Economic Order  (NIEO).
 Thus,  the most ZikeZy areas for US-ASEAN agreement would
 be those that advance regional interests without threaten-
 ing G-77 political positions:   special trade treatment,

 greater private and official assistance for development,
 and scientific and technological transfers.
 In the wake of the May ministerial-level Conference
 on International Economic Cooperation  (CIEC), divisions
 among the LDCs over how to continue the North-South dia-
 logue have surfaced as "fissures" in G-77 solidarity.
 Some LDCs, especially the poorest African bloc nations,
 advocate negotiating solely in global forums to preserve
 G-77 solidarity and leverage.   They view smaller forums,
 where some LDCs may be tempted to compromise at the ex-
 pense of the group, as potential threats to G-77 unity,
 to progress toward a NIEO, and to their own national
 economic interests.   Some "moderate" and relatively
 prosperous LDCs--the five members of ASEAN*--are leery
 of the empty rhetoric and potential for confrontation of
 the global forum.   Although they feel that negotiations
 with industrial nations in regional or specific commodity
 forums are more likely to produce tangible results, they
 are concerned about protecting their credentials and
 leverage within the G-77.
 In February 1976, at the first ASEAN summit,  the mem-
 bers agreed to develop a united approach to dealing with
 other regional economic groups  (the EC)  and with major
 industrial trading partners  (Japan, US, Australia, New
 Zealand, and Canada).   ASEAN moved quickly to establish
 a permanent secretariat  (in Jakarta)  and agreed to coordi-
 nate rice and crude oil policies, to plan five large-scale
 jointly owned industrial projects, and to stimulate intra-
 ASEAN trade.   By acting as a collective unit,  ASEAN hopes
 to increase its leverage in negotiations with industrial
 nations on measures to promote regional development and
 integration.
 ASEAN negotiations with industrial nations, however,
 will continue to be affected by the limited degree of

 consensus on regional cooperation thus far reached among
 the members.   Despite greater efforts to cooperate, ASEAN
 is by no means a fully coordinated group.   The members
 are still in the delicate process of consensus building
 which involves balancing individual national with collec-
 tive regional concerns.
 The disparate levels of economic and social develop-
 ment and conflicting national economic policies and goals
 have produced basic differences,  for example, over the
 nature of intra-regional preferential trade arrangements
 between Singapore and the Philippines on the one side.
 and Indonesia and Malaysia on the other.   Singapore and
 the Philippines, with industrialized or mixed economies,
 stand to gain from such arrangements, while Indonesia and
 Malaysia are more concerned with protecting their infant
 domestic industries.   Members have also been reluctant to
 sacrifice existing bilateral agreements with industrial
 nations for currently unspecified multilateral arrangements.
 Continuing disagreement over the agenda,  timing, and
 representation  (foreign or economic ministers)  of talks
 with industrial nations and over the extent of leadership
 to be exercised by the ASEAN secretariat reflect the slow
 progress in this consensus-building process.
 ASEAN Relations With the Third World
 At the same time that ASEAN has pursued regional-
 level negotiations with industrial nations,  the member
 states acknowledge the political importance of a united
 G-77 position in global forums for achieving the long-
 term goal of a NIEO.   Hence,  the ASEAN states--in partic-
 ular Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines--want to
 avoid charges that such regional negotiations contribute
 to fragmenting G-77 solidarity.   In fact,  Indonesia,  a
 leading G-77 spokesman, believes that regional and bilateral
 discussions should complement but not substitute for other
 North-South forums, and has recently indicated a preference
 for conducting substantive negotiations on commodity issues
 solely at the meetings in Geneva on an Integrated Program
 for Commodities.
 The sensitivity of some ASEAN members to the opinion
 of the third world will continue to influence the progress
 of consultations with industrial nations.   Both Indonesia
 and the Philippines want to maintain their leading roles

 in the G-77, in part to gain third world approbation
 for controversial domestic policies  (Indonesia's annexation
 of East Timor and the Philippines'  handling of the Moslem
 Moro rebellion).   In addition, the Philippines, after its
 long, close relationship with the US, wants to establish
 itself as a nonaligned nation.   Indonesia and Malaysia,
 influential proponents of a neutralized Southeast Asia
 (zone of peace, freedom, and neutrality), want to avoid
 creating any unfavorable impression that ASEAN is seeking
 a mutual security organization.*  All three, therefore,
 have approached all consultations cautiously--out of fear
 of arousing Vietnamese antipathy for the association and
 of tainting its nonaligned and apolitical image--and have
 strongly advocated negotiating with each industrial nation
 separately.   While neither Singapore nor Thailand fully
 share this sensitivity to third world opinion, they have,
 nevertheless, agreed to proceed at the pace and in the
 direction set by the other three.
 Thus,  in deciding the agenda and timing of consulta-
 tions with industrial nations, ASEAN states will be forced
 to weigh continually their pragmatic,  immediate national
 and regional needs against G-77 political solidarity and
 the long-term ideological goal of a NIEO.   In talks with
 Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, ASEAN is seeking to
 change its economic relationships with these nations.
 ASEAN views Japan as a leading industrial nation,
 the region's major market and supplier, and a neutral
 Asian power.   In a series of ASEAN-Japan forums,  Japan
 has been asked specifically to extend financial and
 technical assistance to the five regional industrial
 projects to establish a system for stabilizing
 export earnings, and to promote ASEAN-Japan traae Dy
 giving preferential treatment to ASEAN products.
 ASEAN policy toward Australia and New Zealand re-
 flects the importance the association places on the
 geographical proximity of both countries to the ASEAN
 area.    The overriding concern is to draw them into an
 associate status with ASEAN,  or at least to make them
 more sympathetic to the interests of their regional
 neighbors than to their nonregional,  industrial allies.

 The ASEAN nations are clearly aware that Australia and
 New Zealand are not in a position to do much economically
 for the region.   ASEAN objectives in the consultations
 have centered on continuation of rather limited technical
 and financial assistance to existing joint projects,  access
 to markets for ASEAN products, and scientific and tech-
 nological cooperation.
 To date,  the results of these talks have been dis-
 appointing for ASEAN.   Japan in particular has been accused
 of "divide and conquer" tactics because of its unwilling-
 ness to grant financial assistance to the five joint in-
 dustrial projects and its continued preference for bilateral
 economic relations. General reluctance on the part of all
 the industrial trading partners to grant preferential trade
 treatment to ASEAN products has caused Malaysia and Singa-
 pore to call for increased cooperation among ASEAN nations
 to enable them to retaliate against protectionist measures
 imposed by the industrial nations  (particularly Australia).
 ASEAN members have also talked about asking Japan to
 create a special preferential economic relationship with
 the association.
 Implications for US Polite
 Given the internal strains on ASEAN unity,  the
 limits of consensus reached thus far on economic dis-
 cussions with industrial nations,  and the failure of these
 discussions to meet initial ASEAN objectives,  it would be
 premature to consider ASEAN an effective regional
 negotiating forum for relations with industrial nations,
 especially on highly politicized North-South issues.   Over
 the next 18 months,  the pace of economic integration with-
 in the region will continue to be slow and the outcome
 of ASEAN discussions with industrial nations is unlikely
 to achieve much that could not have been obtained bi-
 laterally.   ASEAN members will probably remain committed
 to developing a unified position on international economic
 issues. Momentum in this endeavor will be constrained,
 however, by the degree of consensus reached among the
 members on the trade-off between need for immediate
 national/regional economic development and support for
 the long range, politically symbolic goal of a NIEO.
 ASEAN will want to continue discussions with indus-
 trial nations on some North-South issues which augment
 regional cooperation--special trade treatment, greater

 private and government assistance for development, and

 be cool toward US initiatives to discuss other North-South
 issues which could create tensions between ASEAN and the
 rest of the G-77.   If pressed too aggressively,  some
 ASEAN members could even perceive these initiatives as
 threats to their nonaligned status and to their role and
 influence within the G-77.   This reaction could especially
 affect Indonesian and Philippine attitudes toward recent
 US initiatives in the North-South dialogue and possibly
 aggravate bilateral relations already subject to strain
 over US policies in the areas of human rights and arms
 transfer restraint.

 The Evolution of Soviet Reaction to Dissent
 When the Soviets signed the CSCE accord in August
 1975,  they took a calculated risk that acceptance of the
 human rights provisions of Basket III would not create
 serious internal difficulties.   After Helsinki and
 especially during the last year,  however,  several devel-
 opments heightened the concern of Soviet authorities
 about dissent.   This increased anxiety gradually  trans-
 lated into increasingly tough stands on issues of ideology
 and social control and produced the current crackdown on
 internal dissent.
 The Dissident Problem
 The human rights provisions of Basket III of the
 CSCE accord signed in Helsinki provided a common ground
 for Soviet dissidents with a wide range of views and
 concerns, thus for the first time in many years raising
 in Moscow the specter of a unified "opposition."   The
 most important dissident group to emerge was the CSCE
 monitoring group, organized by physicist Yury Orlov in
 Moscow in May 1976.   Regional branches were established
 in the Ukraine,  Lithuania, Armenia,  Georgia,  and Lenin-
 grad.   These branches were tiny and the degree of actual
 coordination among them uncertain, but the emergence of
 a dissident organization with links throughout the coun-
 try was unprecedented in recent Soviet history.   By
 espousing the causes of a wide variety of aggrieved
 religious and national minorities, moreover,  the moni-
 toring group established some claim to being the center
 of a broader protest movement.
 Although this incipient support of religious and
 national minorities could have provided a mass base for
 human rights activism,  the intellectual dissidents re-
 mained estranged from the bulk of the working-class
 population.   Working-class discontent, which has basi-
 cally economic rather than political roots, has not con-
 verged with intellectual dissent.

 Food Shortages and Unrest
 Nonetheless, official apprehension that such a
 convergence could take place has evidently grown since
 the bad harvest of 1975.                Although consumerism is not
 as potent a political force in the Soviet Union as in
 some East European countries, the Soviet population has
 come to expect a gradual improvement in its standard of
 living.   Food shortages have caused widespread discon-
 tent, and over the last year and a half there have been
 reports of a number of instances of active protest and
 of general unrest.
 Although recent instances of violence, some of them
 related to food shortages, were not perpetrated by human
 rights activists, the Soviet leadership may not always
 distinguish clearly between different sources of protest.
 Attack From the Eurocommunists
 Since early 1976, the Eurocommunists, including the
 once docile French Communist Party, have become more
 openly critical of the Soviet Union than at any time
 since the invasion of Czechoslovakia.   The Spanish Party
 has been the most vocal, but the larger French and
 Italian parties pose the more serious problem for the
 Soviets.   From the Soviet perspective, the chief danger
 implicit in Eurocommunism is not that it has diminished
 Soviet influence in West European Communist parties, but
 that it offers a Marxist alternative to the Soviet model
 in Eastern Europe--and perhaps ultimately within the
 Soviet Union itself.

 Moscow has thus been upset by Eurocommunist support
 to dissidents in Eastern Europe and the USSR.   Particu-
 larly annoying to the Soviets was an unprecedented visit
 in late December of an Italian Communist delegation to
 dissident Soviet Marxist Roy Medvedev in Moscow.   The
 Italians presented Medvedev with an Italian edition of
 one of his books and reportedly asked him to write arti-
 cles for an Italian party historical journal.
 Unrest in Eastern Europe
 At the same time, the Helsinki conference had a
 catalytic effect on East European dissent, which began
 a movement across national borders.   Dissidents from
 different East European countries have reportedly coor-
 dinated their activities to a limited degree.   Last
 winter some Soviet leaders were evidently genuinely
 alarmed that post-Helsinki conditions were creating an
 unstable situation in Eastern Europe,  especially in Po-
 land and to a lesser degree in East Germany and Czechoslo-
 vakia.
 The growth of unrest in Eastern Europe increased
 chronic Soviet fears of a spillover into the Soviet
 Union itself.   Soviet authorities have always been alert
 to the danger of a political "virus" from Eastern Europe
 spreading into the polyglot borderlands of the Soviet
 Union, which have historically been susceptible to in-
 fluences from that quarter.   This pervasive fear was evi-
 dently a factor in the Soviet decision to invade Czech-
 oslovakia in 1968.
 The US Human Rights Initiative
 The new US administration's human rights "campaign,"
 and especially the personal involvement of President
 Carter in public appeals on behalf of Soviet dissidents,
 further disturbed Soviet authorities.   Many Soviet offi-
 cials, already fearful of being put in the dock at Bel-
 grade, reportedly regarded the campaign as a deliberate
 attempt at subversion by the US.   At the same time,  US
 protests about Soviet repressions temporarily emboldened
 Soviet dissidents to make more vigorous protests and to
 channel their appeals directly to the US administration.

 The Soviet Response
 It is largely as a response to all these related
 pressures that the current harassment of dissidents must
 be seen.   It is clear that at least the initiation of
 the crackdown, although not its present scope, predates
 the change in US administrations.   The factor of great-
 est importance in the minds of the Soviet leaders at the
 outset of the crackdown probably was the desire to clean
 house and silence the dissidents before the Belgrade re-
 view conference was convened.                          Indeed, some dissidents
 have charged that the climate in the Soviet Union dete-
 riorated immediately after, and as a direct result of,
 the signing of the Helsinki accords.   Recent emigre
 Bukovsky, among others, has claimed that conditions in
 his prison "tangibly worsened" after Helsinki.   In 1976
 there were a few trials of dissidents, balanced by occa-
 sional conciliatory gestures.
 The first clear evidence that a campaign against
 dissidents might be under way did not come, however,
 until late December 1976, seven months after the forma-
 tion of the Orlov group in Moscow.   Soviet authorities
 then moved in a limited way against the CSCE monitoring
 group, by conducting searches of apartments of the mem-
 bers of its subgroup in the Ukraine.   But there is no
 evidence to indicate that at this time the Soviets in-
 tended the crackdown to assume the major proportions it
 did in the spring.   Rather, it seems likely that they
 intended to continue "carrot and stick" tactics aimed
 at controlling dissent by a careful combination of coer-
 cive and conciliatory measures, while holding in reserve
 the option of intensifying repression if circumstances
 warranted.
 The new US administration's public defense of Soviet
 dissidents apparently reinforced and exacerbated the
 related Soviet anxieties about the coming Belgrade CSCE
 meeting,  the situation in Eastern Europe,  the behavior
 of the Eurocommunists,  and the food situation at home.
 The net effect was to impel the leadership increasingly
 to conclude that harsher measures against the dissidents
 were required.   Since February the Soviets have moved to
 suppress the Orlov group and its regional subgroups by
 arresting leading members and encouraging others to
 emigrate.   Moreover,  in the spring the Soviets began to

 place more and more limitations on the access of West--
 erners in Moscow to the dissident community and to link
 the dissidents with espionage activities.
 Two incidents in June were indicative of the changed
 atmosphere in Moscow:   the interrogation of newsman
 Robert Toth  (the first such case in the detente era),
 and the surfacing of further suggestions that dissident
 Shcharansky is under investigation for treason.   If
 Soviet authorities do charge him with treason, Shcharansky
 may become the first intellectual dissident since Stalin's
 day to be tried for this crime.   Meanwhile, since Toth's
 departure,  the Soviet media have expanded insinuations
 that he was engaged in espionage.
 Conclusions
 The Soviets originally believed that they. could
 afford to permit their citizens greater contact with the
 West. Otherwise, they would never have signed the Hel-
 sinki accords, allowed greater movement between East and
 West Germany, and stopped the jamming of some Western
 broadcasts to. the Soviet Union in 1973.   The events of
 the last year, however, have led them to reassess their
 policies.   Many Soviet officials have probably decided
 that acquiescence on Basket III was a mistake.
 Objectively, Soviet dissent does not appear to pose
 a serious threat to the Soviet system, but Soviet offi-
 cials evidently perceive a greater danger than objective
 analysis would seem to warrant.   Both Russian history
 and Leninist ideology impel them to exaggerate the po-
 tential importance of opposition groups, however small.
 They have always been preoccupied with problems of con-
 trol.   The importance that the leadership attaches to
 dissent can.be seen by the fact that decisions about
 individual dissidents are sometimes made at the Politburo
 level.
 It is not merely intellectual dissent that disturbs
 the Soviets.   They fear that the "freer movement of
 people and ideas," which they conceded on paper at Hel-
 sinki and which to a certain extent the circumstances of
 a modern technological world force upon them, will open
 their society to a host of ideas and influences from the
 West that are,  in?their view,  socially disruptive and
 morally unhealthy as well.as politically subversive.

 Identifying Western concepts of liberty with license,
 they are apprehensive that extensive contact with the
 "decadent" West will expose the Soviet people not only
 to alien political ideas but also to crime,  terrorism,
 pornography, and drugs, which could combine to produce
 a general breakdown of order and discipline.   To the
 extent that they are concerned about the stagnation of
 their economy, the Soviets may also fear that consumer
 dissatisfaction will become a more serious political
 problem in future years.
 In view of the problems the Soviets confronted in
 the winter and early spring, some sort of domestic crack-
 down was to be expected.   The intensity and duration of
 the Soviet response, however, is not entirely explained
 by objective circumstances.   Some of the pressures on
 the Soviets in fact seem to have diminished since the
 February-March period.   The tense situation in Eastern
 Europe has eased, and the food supply in the Soviet
 Union, while still a matter of considerable concern,
 seems to have improved somewhat.   Meanwhile, Soviet
 attempts to muffle internal and external criticism have
 paid off to a considerable extent.   Although occasional
 outbursts of protest continue to take place, the more
 prominent dissidents have been effectively silenced.
 Nevertheless, Soviet repression of dissent continues to
 intensify.
 It is true that even now the picture is not one of
 unrelieved repression.   Two prominent Jewish activists,
 for example, were recently allowed to emigrate.   And
 Orlov, the key figure in post-Helsinki dissent, has been
 charged only with the relatively minor offense of de-
 faming the Soviet state and social system.   There are
 still some constraints on Soviet behavior toward dissi-
 dents; the Soviet leadership has no desire, if indeed it
 has the power,  to move in the direction of reinstituting
 the Stalinist terror apparatus.   Nevertheless, the cur-
 rent campaign against dissent in the Soviet Union has
 become the toughest of this decade.
 This increase in the relative harshness of Soviet
 policy is to some extent a natural partner of the more
 defensive and pugnacious tone the Soviets have recently
 displayed in many facets of foreign policy--particularly
 regarding the Eurocommunists and the United States.   The
 recent expansion of Soviet actions against dissidents is

 thus related to irritation over the lack of progress in
 other areas of US-Soviet relations, as well as to the
 Soviets'  desire to keep dissent closely controlled during
 the Belgrade review conference.   At the same time, the
 exaggerated sensitivity of Soviet policy, both externally
 and internally, may reflect aggravated leadership ten-
 sions.   A confluence of policy difficulties, coming at
 a time when Brezhnev's health is uncertain, may have
 strengthened the arguments of those within the leader-

 The Legal Outlook for Arrested Soviet Dissidents
 The three most prominent incarcerated dissidents--Yury
 OrZov, Aleksandr Ginsburg,                and AnatoZy Shcharansky--
 could be brought to trial within the next month or two,
 but a decision by Soviet authorities to proceed along
 these lines is by no means assured.   The Soviet criminal
 justice system is flexible enough to permit a variety
 of outcomes,  and political rather than Legal considera-
 tions undoubtedly will be determinative.
 The Three Key Dissidents
 The current Soviet crackdown against dissent has
 focused particularly on members of the "Public Group to
 Support Implementation of the Helsinki Accords," the
 CSCE monitoring group formed under the leadership of
 physicist Yury Orlov in May 1976.   Two members of the
 group's Ukrainian chapter have already been convicted
 of anti-Soviet agitation and were sentenced late last
 month to long labor-camp terms.
 The Soviets have moved to break up the group's Mos-
 cow chapter by allowing several of its founding members
 to emigrate and by arresting Orlov, Aleksandr Ginzburg,
 and Anatoly Shcharansky.   The legal cases against them--
 which are still in the investigatory stage--apparently
 are being built under different sections of the RSFSR
 (Russian Republic)  Criminal Code.
 Ginzburg was the first to be arrested (on February
 3).    As the administrator of a fund for arrested dissi-
 dents and their families provided by exiled author
 Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Ginzburg clearly is vulnerable
 to nominally nonpolitical charges related to his deal-
 ings in foreign currency.   He may actually have engaged
 in illegal transactions.   There recently have been indi-
 cations, however, that Ginzburg could instead face trial
 for anti-Soviet agitation.
 "Anti-Soviet Agitation and Propaganda" is consid-
 ered an "especially dangerous crime against the state,"

 and it is punishable by up to seven years'  imprisonment
 with the possibility of an additional five years of in-
 ternal exile.   Recidivists  (like Ginzburg)                          face up to
 10 years in a labor camp.                 The offense is defined by
 Article 70 of the RSFSR Criminal Code* as agitation or
 propaganda aimed at "subverting or weakening" the Soviet
 regime or at committing especially dangerous crimes
 against the state.   The offense also includes "the cir-
 culation,  for the same purpose of slanderous fabrica-
 tions which defame the Soviet state and social system,
 or the circulation or preparation or keeping,  for the
 same purpose, of literature of such content .  .  .  .  "
 (emphasis added).
 Orlov was arrested on February 10, but his case is
 reportedly being geared to Article 190-1, a "crime
 against the system of administration," which is of con-
 siderably less consequence than anti-Soviet agitation.
 It is punishable by a maximum three-year prison term.
 Article 190-1 forbids "the systematic circulation in an
 oral form of fabrications known to be false which defame
 the Soviet state and social system."   The preparation
 or circulation "in written, printed or any other form
 of works of such content" also is prohibited.**
 *Each union republic has its own codes of criminal Law
 and procedure,  but they all conform to aZZ-union "Funda-
 mental Principles" and hence are basically the same in
 substance.   Thus,  the Ukrainian dissidents Rudenko and
 Tikhy were tried under Article 62 of the Ukrainian Re-
 public Criminal Code, which corresponds to Article 70
 of the RSFSR Code.
 **The shorthand phrase  "anti-Soviet slander" commonly
 used in the Western press is ambiguous and hence confus-
 ing in that it can apply to either Article 70 or 190-1.
 The language regarding defamation of the Soviet state
 is similar in the two articles,  but there are two key
 distinctions.   To fall under the more serious Article
 70,  fabrications must have been circulated for the pur-
 pose of subverting or weakening the regime or of commi-
 ting other especially dangerous crimes against the state.
 This requirement need not be met under Article 190-1,
 but--unlike Article 70--fabrications must have been
 "known to be false."   The knowledge of falsity provision
 of Article 190-1  raises the interesting theoretical pos-
 sibility of a defense based on the assertion of belief
 in the truth of the material circulated.

 The "fabrications" at issue in regard to Ginzburg
 and Orlov are of course the documents dealing with CSCE-
 related issues that the monitoring group assembled and
 distributed to the embassies of Helsinki accord signa-
 tories.   The documents deal with matters such as Soviet
 persecution of religious believers, the discriminatory
 treatment of political prisoners, restrictions on free
 emigration, official interference with international
 postal and telephone communications, and Soviet abridg-
 ment of the rights of national minorities.
 The indication that Orlov might be treated rela-
 tively leniently could be part of the Soviet effort to
 dissuade the West from vigorously pressing the issue of
 "Basket III"  (human rights)  implementation at the main
 CSCE review conference in Belgrade this fall.   It is
 also noteworthy that unlike Shcharansky and Ginzburg,
 Orlov is not Jewish and has no previous convictions for
 dissident activity.   He also has the status of a corre-
 sponding member of the Armenian Academy of Sciences.
 By far the most serious case is being orchestrated
 against Anatoly Shcharansky, who until his arrest on
 March 15 was active among both Jewish refuseniks and
 human rights activists.   The charge that has been linked
 to Shcharansky is treason, which can carry the death
 penalty or up to 15 years in a labor camp plus five
 years of internal exile.
 Treason is defined by Article 64 of the RSFSR Crim-
 inal Code to include the "transmission of a state or
 military secret to a foreign state."   It also encompasses
 espionage, which is defined by Article 65 to include
 "the transfer, or the stealing or collection for purpose
 of transfer,  to a foreign state or foreign organization
 or its secret service, of information constituting a
 state or military secret, or the transfer or collection
 on assignment from a foreign intelligence service of
 any other information for use to the detriment of the
 interests of the USSR."
 An apparently key element in the case being con-
 structed against Shcharansky is his association with
 Los Angeles Times  correspondent Robert Toth.   Toth was
 interrogated at length by the KGB about this relation-
 ship before leaving Moscow at the end of his tour last

 month.   The questioning was clearly aimed at establish-
 ing that Shcharansky collected and passed to Toth infor-
 mation that can be construed by the Soviets as state se-
 crets.                             Recent Soviet allegations that Toth was engaged
 in espionage activity have several purposes beyond the
 Shcharansky case--for example, to help bolster charges
 of US interference in Soviet internal affairs and to in-
 hibit contacts between Soviet citizens and foreigners--
 but the assertion that there is evidence that Toth worked
 for an intelligence agency "related to the Pentagon" may
 also be meant to signal that the Soviets believe they
 have all the formal elements of proof needed to make a
 treason charge against Shcharansky credible.
 The Outlook
 Two factors seem to favor a Soviet decision to move
 ahead with trials for Ginzburg, Orlov, and Shcharansky
 between now and the fall.   The first involves the timing
 of the Belgrade CSCE conference.   The Soviets could see
 the August-September hiatus between the end of the pre-
 paratory session and the beginning of the main meeting as
 an opportunity to dispose of the cases with less inter-
 national publicity and attention than would be likely
 later in the year.
 Another consideration involves the fact that the
 RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates a maximum
 of nine months "confinement under guard in connection
 with the investigation of a case"  (Article 97).   To re-
 main in compliance with procedural rules, therefore,
 Ginzburg and Orlov would either have to be freed--at
 least temporarily--or have judicial proceedings init_i.-
 ated against them by November, and the nine-month period
 for Shcharansky would expire in December--that is,  in
 the midst of the CSCE review conference.
 There are some countervailing considerations, how-
 ever,  and the Soviet criminal justice system is convo-
 luted enough to afford opportunity for a variety of out-
 comes.   Holding trials for the three dissidents in ad-
 vance of the main CSCE review session would lessen some-
 what Moscow's ability to imply that their fate may de-
 pend on Western willingness to take a noncontentious ap-
 proach toward reviewing implementation on human rights

 provisions of the Helsinki accord.*   The Soviets could
 not, moreover, count on Western inattention even if the
 trials were held during the CSCE intersession and while
 many officials in West Europe and the US might be on
 vacation.
 It is unlikely that the Soviets have yet resolved
 the conflicting gains and losses--that is, the suppres-
 sive and deterrent domestic impact versus adverse inter-
 national publicity and strained relations with the US--
 of holding the trials before or after the main CSCE meet-
 ing gets under way in late September or early October.
 It is thus possible that Ginzburg, Orlov, and Shcharansky
 will be released when the nine-month period of investi-
 gatory detention expires, but that the investigations
 of their cases will continue.**
 Such a move would carry the implicit message that
 the outcome of the investigations might depend on devel-
 opments in Belgrade and on the conduct of the dissidents
 themselves.   Another way in which the Soviets could
 delay final disposition of the cases--perhaps until the
 CSCE session ends--would be to move ahead with initial
 judicial proceedings but have the cases "returned for
 supplementary investigation" under Article 232 of the
 Procedural Code.
 The Soviets may ultimately choose not to exploit
 the opportunities for trials that they have created, and
 this course would not necessitate any extralegal maneu-
 vering.   Recent reports that the dissidents have been
 "charged" with the offenses mentioned earlier are mis-
 leading in their implication that proceedings against
 the dissidents are at a more advanced stage than actu-
 ally seems to be the case.
 *Even after conviction and sentencing, however,  the So-
 viets could still hint that expulsion and exile in lieu
 of prison remained a possibi Zi ty .
 **Article  133 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure
 provides for prolongation of preliminary investigations
 in exceptional cases.   No time limit is specified.

 What appears to have happened so far in the Ginz-
 burg, Orlov, and Shcharansky cases is that each of the
 dissidents has moved from the status of "suspect" to
 that of "accused."   But "Prosecution as the Accused"
 under Article 143 of the RSFSR Procedural Code is only
 an intermediate step in Soviet criminal justice.*   It is
 not equivalent to "prosecution" in the sense of indict-
 ment and trial, and it does not necessarily mean that a
 trial eventually will be held on the specific accusation
 or any other charge.
 Upon completion of an investigation there may be a
 "conclusion to indict," but even this does not guarantee
 that the accused will actually be brought to trial.**
 The Procedural Code specifies that the accused and his
 defense counsel*** must be allowed to acquaint themselves
 with all materials of the case when the investigator
 deems the preliminary investigation to be completed and
 the evidence gathered to be sufficient to draw up a
 "conclusion to indict"  (See Articles 200-204).   There
 has been no indication that any of the cases of the
 three key dissidents has yet reached this stage.
 *Article 143 says that  "if there exists sufficient evi-
 dence to provide a basis for presenting an accusation
 of the commission of a crime" the investigator shall
 "render a reasoned decree to prosecute the person as
 the accused."   One effect of the decree apparently is
 to permit employment of additional investigatory proce-
 dures.
 **See Article 199 of the Procedural Code.   Other possi-
 ble outcomes of an investigation include a "decree to
 terminate the case," and a "decree to refer the case to
 a court for consideration of the question whether to
 take compulsory measures of a medical character."  Arti-
 cZes 213 and 214 describe the supervisory role of the
 Procurator,  who can confirm the conclusion to indict,
 order a supplementary investigation,  or terminate the
 case.
 ***Article 47 provides that defense counsel shaZZ be per-
 mitted to participate in a case from the moment the ac-
 cused is informed of the completion of the preliminary
 investigation.   Defense counsel apparently m    be per-
 mitted to participate earlier,  that is,  from the moment
 the accusation is presented,  by authority of the Procu-
 rator.

 It thus remains difficult to predict the legal out-
 come for Ginzburg, Orlov, or Shcharansky.   Any or all of
 the three may soon be brought to trial, or never tried
 at all, or tried on charges in addition to or in lieu
 of those to which they have been linked thus far.*   The
 dissidents'  fates clearly hinge on political rather than
 legal considerations, and the Soviet criminal justice
 system is amply ambiguous and sufficiently flexible to
 permit all but the most bizarre politically-determined
 outcomes to be orchestrated within the bounds of social-
 ist legality.
 *Ginzburg,  for example,  could still be tried for cur-
 rency offenses rather than for anti-Soviet agitation.
 He would not necessarily be better off in terms of pos-
 sible sentences.   Article 88 of the RSFSR Criminal Code
 specifies up to eight years' imprisonment for violations
 of rules for currency transactions.   "Large scale" iZZe-
 gal speculation is punishable by up to 15 years' impri-
 sonment or by death.
