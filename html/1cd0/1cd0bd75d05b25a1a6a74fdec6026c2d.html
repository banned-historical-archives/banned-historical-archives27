 Statement by Mr Brian Crozier, Director of the Institute for
 the Study of Conflict, London, in testimony before the Sub-
 Committee on Internal Security of the Committee on the
 Judiciary, United States Senate.
 TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM
 I am going to be .yin with definitions, for I believe that it is important
 that we should know what we are talking about.  You will notice that I use
 the term:-ii "transnational terrorism' , rather than "international terrorism".
 The distinction between the two in ay seem pedantic to some people, but to
 my mind it is a real one. "International terrorism" might imply the
 existence of a "terrorist international" in the sense of an international
 body coordinating the activities of terrorists in different countries.
 There is really no such thing, although a number of terrorist groups are
 affiliated to the Trotskyist Fourth International with its headquarters in
 Brussels.  However, a striking aspect of the new wave of terrorism that
 faces us today is that the great majority of the proliferating terrorist
 groups deceive help of one kind or another across international boundaries,
 either from other terrorist groups or from. governments that support what
 they are doing or the objectives which they claim to be furthering.  With
 these few preliminary remarks, I propose the following brief glossary:
 Terrorism:  motivated violence for political ends (a. definition that
 distinguishes terrorism from both vandalism and non-political crime).
 Terror:  measures of extreme repression, including torture, used
 by States to oppress the population or to repress political dissenters (the
 converse of terrorism).
 E, xtremist: prepared to break the law, with particular reference to
 political violence.
 Subversive centres:  countries that provide assistance, whether with
 money, training, arms or various facilities, to extremist movements
 engaged in challenges to the security of other States.
 Guerrillas (urban or rural):  groups or individuals practising guerrilla
 warfare.  The term "urban guerrillas" is often a misnomer for "urban
 terrorists".
 Revolutionary war:  a form of warfare in which the ultimate objective
 is the total destruction of the society in which the conflict is occurring,
 and of the government and administration of the area.
 Subversion:  a systematic attempt to undermine a society with the
 ultim,.ate objects of bringing about a total collapse of the State by bringing

 a regime into disrepute, causing a loss of confidence on the part of the
 ruling establishment, institutions and government,  and provoking a
 breakdown of law and order.
 Subversion and Terrorism
 It is very important to understand that terrorism, which is our main
 concern today, may or may not be a phase in a subversive campaign or
 in a revolutionary war.  The relationship between subversion and terrorism
 is the same as that between the whole and the part.  A revolutionary war,
 essentially based on the pattern developed by Mao Tse-tung in China and
 by Truong Chinh and Vo Nguyen Giap in Vietnam, and later practised in
 Algeria and other countries, usually goes through various phases.  It will
 begin with the creation of a subversive apparatus ; the second phase will
 consist of terrorism;  there will be a third phase of guerrilla war; and a
 final phase of full-scale war leading (if the-revolutionaries are successful)
 to the "revolutionary final offensive" - of which we have just witnessed a
 tragically successful example in Vietnam.
 Now the point I want to make is this, that terrorism is in the final
 .analysis much more grave and important if it is a phase in a process of
 subversion or revolutionary war than if it is practised for its own sake
 as an isolated phenomenon.  It is a very -important element in the counter-
 action to terrorism to be certain in diagnosis of the challenge.  If the
 terrorists have ultimate revolutionary objectives, they must be prevented
 from reaching Phase 3 and at all. costs Phase 4.
 One of the most striking and curious aspects of the contemporary wave
 of terrorism, however, is that in a number of cases there appears to be
 no discernible ultimate political objective.  Terrorism becomes a way of
 life. I am not making the mistake of suggesting that such. forms of
 .apparently unmotivated terrorism are unimportant.   On the contrary,
 they contribute to the erosion of liberties and of the fabric of society.
 They must not be allowed to go on, but it must be borne in mind that the
 ultimate beneficiaries - if any - of such terrorism are unlikely to be
 those that actually practise it.
 The Objects of Terrorism
 I think it is fair to say that there is no absolute unanimity among
 specialists on the aims or objects of terrorism.  I myself have always
 distinguished between two main categories of terrorism:  disruptive and
 coercive.
 The aims of disruptive terrorism are:  self publicity; to build up the
 movement's morale and prestige;  to discredit and demoralise the
 authorities;  to provoke the authorities into taking excessively harsh
 repressive measures, likely to alienate the population and force a rising
 spiral of official expenditure in arms, lives and money, resulting in

 Approved For Release 2007/02/07 : CIA-RDP77M00144R000300100029-0
 public clamour for the abandonment of counter-action.
 The aims of coercive terrorism are:  to demoralise the civil popula-
 tion, weaken its confidence in central authority, and instil fear of the
 terrorist movement;  to make an example of selected victims, by torture
 and/or death to force obedience to the leadership of the movement.
 There is an important observation to be made at this point:  terrorism
 is a weapon of the weak.  This, at any rate, was the normal experience
 in the recent past.  Usually, terrorists graduated to guerrilla war and
 then to outright war when and if they felt strong enough.  If they abandoned
 guerrilla war to return to terrorism, this could normally be taken as a
 sign of returning weakness.  It must be stressed, however, that the con-
 temporary wave of terrorism provides many examples that do not conform
 to this facile rule; and it may well be that the readiness of terrorists to
 stick to terrorism even when they are visibly growing in strength, may
 help the security forces to determine whether the prevailing terrorist
 situation represents an end in itself or is a phase in a wider revolutionary
 action.  There are many examples, but the ones that have struck me most
 forcibly are those of the Red Army Group (the Baader-Meinhbf gang) in
 the Federal Republic of Germany;  and the prolonged terrorist activities
 of the Ejercito Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP) and the Montoneros in
 Argentina.
 Two more observations are called for at this point.  One is that
 terrorism is a barometer of success or failure, and a fairly precise
 indicator of public support or its absence.  Whenever terrorists find it
 necessary to kill more people on their own side than on the enemy side,
 it must be presumed either that their cause is widely opposed, or that
 at least it leaves the population indifferent. In many situations I have
 studied, the terrorists normally killed more of their presumed supporters
 than of the supposed enemy.  The other observation is that terrorism, in
 general, appears to be a useful auxiliary weapon rather than a decisive
 one.  It may even be counter-productive, by alienating the population.
 The Main Strands of Terrorism Today
 Any classification of terrorist groups is bound to be arbitrary, in that
 overlapping is inevitable.  In recent study groups and conferences of the
 Institute for the Study of Conflict, we have been in broad agreement on
 the following classification of the main categories of terrorist groups.
 We had Western Europe primarily in mind, but these categories are
 operative all over the world, including the Western Hemisphere:
 1.  Ethnic, religious or nationalist groups.  In general, these are
 minority groups which feel themselves different from the majority of the
 population, on ethnic, religious, linguistic or cultural grounds.  They
 include the Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the
 Palestinian group Al Fatah with its extreme terrorist wing, Black
 September, and on. this side of the Atlantic, the Front de Liberation du

 Quebec (FLQ).  At different times, of course, you have had Black
 extremist groups in this country as well.  You will note that these
 ethnic or religious groups may be either "right-wing" or "left-wing".
 Initially, both the Provisional IRA and Al Fatah were to the right
 rather than to the left.  On the other hand, the FLQ and the Official
 wing of the IRA, which is Marxist, are of course left-wing.
 2.  Marxist-Leninist groups.  I should like to emphasise the im-
 portant point that although a number of revolutionary groups of the
 extreme left, such as the Trotskyists, are often at loggerheads with
 each other and usually violently opposed to the Moscow-line Communist
 Parties, they are all nevertheless branches from the same mother tree,
 in that they are all. Marxist-Leninist.  The same obviously applies to
 the so-called Maoist groups, which may or may not be affiliated to the
 Chinese People's Republic.  The Guevarists and Castroites must also
 be considered in this group. The Official wing of the IRA certainly
 belongs in this group as well as in group 1;  along with the Portuguese
 Maoist Reorganisation. Movement of the Party of the Proletariat (MRPP),
 the Basque ETA (VI Assembly) and the Maoist Brigate Rosse in Italy.
 It should be remembered that most of the orthodox Communist parties
 are more or less responsive to the current Soviet line in favour of a
 .''consitutional path to power".  Nevertheless, there are a number of
 striking examples of Communist parties that have latterly been involved
 in violent action.  These include the Portuguese Communist Party (for
 about two years until May 1973, through the terrorist ARA);  the North
 Vietnamese (Lao Dong);  the North Korean and the Cuban parties.  Nor
 should it be overlooked that Moscow, while in general advocating
 "constitutional" methods is nevertheless engaged in clandestine assistance
 for a number of terrorist groups, not limited to those of Marxist persuasion.
 3.  Anarchist groups.  These are neither as numerous nor as important
 as the groups in our second category, but Anarchism may now be on the
 increase.  In Spain, which has a strong Anarchist tradition, the Movi-
 miento Iberico Libertario has emerged recently in Catalonia.  The
 German security authorities classify the Baader-Meinhof gang as
 "Anarchist", but this is arguable.  The "ideology" of the gang is con-
 fused and eclectic.  To the extent that it possessed an ideology at all,
 the Angry Brigade in the United Kingdom could be classified as "Anarchist".
 4.  Pathological groups or individuals.  Where group violence appears
 to be a way of life, in that the political objectives are never clearly spelt
 out, it may be helpful to regard such groups as pathological rather than
 political.  Some experts would hold that such American groups as the
 Weathermen or the Symbionese Liberation Army, are organisations that
 may be considered analagous to the group responsible for the Manson
 killings.  The motivation may have more to do with personal inadequacy,
 hatred of family, or a specifically white middle-class guilt-feeling than
 with an acquired ideology.

 5.    Neo-fascist and extreme right-wing groups.  In Latin America in
 recent years, a number of groups that may be regarded loosely as "right-
 wing" and that appear to have enjoyed the tacit support of the authorities,
 have sprung up in reaction to left-wing terrorism.   Examples include
 the Eye for an Eye (Ojo por Ojo) in Guatemala and the Death Squad
 (Escuadrao da Morte) in Brazil.  There has in fact been very little true
 right-wing terrorism in most Western countries, with the important
 exception of Italy, during the past two years or so.
 6.  Ideological mercenaries. This is a true "transnational" phenomenon.
 Traditionally, mercenaries sold their military talents for money; the
 ideological mercenaries are ready to cross international borders in pursuit
 of an ideological cause.  A pioneer in this field is the Japanese United Red
 Army (Rengo Segikun).
 The Subversive Centres
 Relatively few terrorist movements are entirely home-grown and self-
 sufficient, although it is equally true to say that unless a group has roots
 in its home territory, it is unlikely to flourish, regardless of foreign
 support.   The point, however, is that foreign support does enable such
 groups in many cases to increase their effectiveness and pursue their
 efforts until final victory.  Recent history has brought dramatic examples
 of this proposition.  For instance, the victory achieved by the North
 Vietnamese forces and the Vietcong would not have been possible without
 massive supplies of sophisticated armaments from the Soviet Union.  This
 was equally true, incidentally, of the Vietnamese Communist victory over
 the French forces at. Dien Bien Phu in 1954.  Again, the anti-Portuguese
 terrorists and guerrillas in Mozambique and elsewhere would probably
 not have achieved their final political victory without substantial support
 in money, arms and training from the Soviet Union, China and certain
 Western countries, among them Sweden.
 As my earlier glossary puts it, countries which provide such assistance
 for movements in other countries must be regarded as subversive centres.
 By far the greatest subversive centre in the world is the USSR, which is
 actively supported in Eastern Europe, especially by East Germany,
 Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.  The Chinese People's Republic is also
 involved as a subversive centre in support of groups in South and East
 Asia, in the Middle East and in Africa.  North Vietnam is similarly
 involved, in Laos, Cambodia and Thailand.  North Korea's involvement
 in subversive support has had a bizarre geographical spread, including
 Mexico and Chile.  Cuba under Fidel Castro has likewise exported
 subversion and terrorism to most other countries in Latin America, on
 a very minor scale in the United States, and in certain African countries,
 and even in the Middle East.
 It should not be supposed that the activities of these Communist
 countries are necessarily coordinated.  On the contrary, they are often
 conducted in rivalry with one another, and I have termed this phenomenon

 Approved For Release 2007/02/07 : CIA-RDP77M00144R000300100029-0
 "competitive subversion".  There has been competitive subversion
 between China and Russia, especially in Africa and the Middle East.
 But it would be a mistake to suppose that these rivalries are entirely
 to the benefit of threatened countries.  The Russians and Chinese may
 currently be pursuing policies of mutual hostility, but all Communist
 states that are involved in subversion are aiming at the same objectives
 -the elimination of "colonialism", "neo-colonialism", "imperialism",
 and "capitalism".  The proliferation of revolutionary groups, regardless
 of their allegiance or the degree of their autonomy merely complicates
 the job of security forces and intelligence services in the target countries.
 Apart from the Communist countries, a number of other countries,
 mostly of left-wing or revolutionary tendencies, have also been involved
 in the export of subversion and terrorism in recent years.  These include,
 or have included, Algeria, Tanzania, Zambia, the Republic of the Congo
 (Brazzaville) and Zatre;  the Popular Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY),
 Iraq, Syria and the Lebanon (the latter probably involuntarily).  An important
 newcomer in the field has been Libya under the Ghadaffi regime, which has
 involved itself in terrorism in many places, including Northern Ireland,
 Chad, and even the Philippines.
 I am now going to tread on more controversial ground.  The terrorists
 of yesterday quite often turn into the respected citizens of today.  This is
 clearly happening in Mozambique, and in Guinea-Bissau, and will shortly
 happen in Angola.  It is a curious fact, nevertheless, that during the
 period when such movements as FRELIMO were involved in terrorist
 activities against the Portuguese authorities, a number of private organisa-
 tions - most prominently, the World Council of Churches - and various
 Western governments provided financial assistance to the terrorists.
 These included Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Norway and Finland.  In all
 cases, the aid provided was said to be "humanitarian" in character (that
 is, destined for medical supplies, schools, etc.) and not military.  To the
 extent that such assistance relieved the budgets of FRELIMO and other
 organisations, they were enabled to increase their purchases of military
 material.
 I end this section with some remarks about Soviet bloc involvement in
 support for terrorist movements.  The year 1968 was a turning point.  In
 that year, three major events focused the attention of Soviet ideologists
 and policy-makers on political violence and in particular on the so-called
 New Left.  These events were:  the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia,
 which in a sense brought a New Left government to power, forcing the
 Soviet armed forces to occupy the country;  the TOt offensive in Vietnam
 and President Johnson's decision not to seek re-election, which could be
 attributed at least in part to the protest movement;  and the disorders in
 Paris in May and June, which almost brought down the government of
 General de Gaulle.  A new policy and attitude towards the extreme left
 or. ig;inated .in Moscow at that time.  It was a very sophisticated policy,
 'which amounted to this:  That the orthodox parties everywhere could denounce
 the extremism of the left and advance their own credentials as the alternative

 government and the party of order;  whereas Soviet assistance to
 terrorist groups, including some ideologically incompatible with the
 Moscow line, could continue on a clandestine basis.  A striking exam-
 ple of this came to light with the seizure at Schiphol airport in Holland
 in the autumn of 1971, of a large shipment of Czech arms destined for
 the Provisional (that is, non-Marxist) wing of the IRA.  The Russians
 have also been involved in support of terrorist activities in Portugal,
 in Mexico, in Colombia and in Chile, among other places.
 The Portuguese example is particularly relevant.  I have already
 mentioned the Portuguese Communist Party's involvement in violence
 through the ARA.  The point is that the PCP has always been entirely
 responsive to Soviet directives.  It has never questioned Soviet policy,
 even on such traumatic issues as the Nazi-Soviet pact, the invasion of
 Finland , the occupation of Hungary or the occupation of Czechoslovakia.
 The Soviet Union was also involved for many years in the training of
 terrorists and guerrillas from African countries, including the Portug-
 uese territories.
 In addition, Soviet weapons have reached the Palestinian groups and
 the Turkish People's Liberation Army some year s ago.  In fact, the
 USSR offers courses in terrorism, sabotage and guerrrilla warfare in
 two distinct streams, according to whether the candidates are members
 of a Moscow-line Communist party or of a "national liberation movement".
 The Communists attend courses run by the Lenin Institute, otherwise
 known as the Institute of Social Sciences, the Institute of Social. Studies
 and the International School of Marxism-Leninism - the terms being
 interchangble and all referring to the same organisation controlled by
 the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party.  Each course
 lasts about six months and at any given time between 300 and 600 men
 and some women are enrolled.  The largest group is from Latin America;
 next come the Arabs, but Europeans, Asians and Africans are present
 in smaller numbers.
 The second stream -- national liberation movements - is channelled
 through the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, and eventually finds
 its way to training camps at Tashkent, Odessa, Baku and Simferopol.
 I should add in fairness that the Russians hold ambiguous views on
 terrorism.  They are on record as opposing the hijacking of international
 airliners, for instance - not least because this kind of action has happened
 in the USSR itself.  But they are in the terrorist business on a large scb.le,
 and this fact should he remembered at a time when "detente" is supposed
 to be the order of the day.
 The Response to Terror. ism
 In all advanced industrial countries, there are wide and deep divergences
 of opinion about the nature of society and the desirability of change.  But
 there i.s a broad consensus that terrorism cannot be tolerated.  Even if

 change is needed, it cannot he change imposed by the force of a
 fanatical minority.  If society tolerates the assassin or the bomb-
 thrower or does not react to terrorism with sufficient awareness
 and determination, then by degrees the terrorist may appear to be
 the spokesman for legitimate pressure groups.  Terrorists act in
 defiance of the law and of the social consensus; the rule of law must
 be enforced against them.  It may well be that the terrorist group
 has fastened on a genuine social or minority grievance.  Any intelli-
 gent. counter-action must take steps to remove the grievance that is
 exploited by the terrorist group, as well as to suppress those practi-
 sing terrorism.
 Inevitably, the terrorist has the initiative, since they can attack
 places of their own choosing and in their own time.  It is essential,
 therefore, to penetrate the terrorist organisation or acquire reliable
 intelligence about its plans.  The terrorists must be isolated, by being
 denied the essential aids they need, such as food, money, medical
 treatment and safe houses.
 A successful  counter-action must be coordinated.  The brunt of it
 will fall on the national police force and on the internal security and
 external intelligence services.  But paramilitary organisations of the
 state, and other state organisations - such as immigration control,
 frontier and coastal guards, and any official information services that
 may exist - will also be involved.  In the last resort, the armed
 services may also have a part to play, when the incidence of terrorism
 has escalated to a level that is beyond the competence of the police to
 deal with.  In terms of organisation, the various ministries and agencies
 involved must be brought: under a single authority, who may be the Prime
 Minister or the President or Head of State.
 The role of intelligence is absolutely crucial.  All intelligence gathered
 by separate agencies must be pooled, computerised if necessary and
 centrally assessed.  In any anti-terrorist campaign, it is desirable to
 set up a national task force drawn from the various agencies involved,
 and dedicated to research, investigation. and the coordination of counter-
 measures.  One of the most successful examples of anti-terrorist action
 in recent times was the incident in 1-Tolland on 31 October 1974.  Fifteen
 hostages held by armed criminals in Scheveningen gaol were released
 by a commando assault by a Dutch counter-terrorist squad.  The psycho-
 logical methods included noise, flares, smoke bombs and sirens, and
 skilled marksmanship played its part.
 A particularly important aspect of a counter-campaign is information
 and publicity.  Especially in an open society and a representative demo-
 cracy, the public must be fully informed about the need for counter-
 action and - as far as is consistent with security - the need for certain
 measures.  In practice,  he med i.a, especially television, have usually
 provided a one-sided account of terroriser; and the response to it - one-
 sided in favour of the terrorists.  This is not; entirely the fault of the

 professional media people, hut is inherent in the nature of television.
 All counter-measures can be presented, with a special focus on any-
 thing that may be described as police brutality, or excesses on the
 part of the authorities.  The terrorists, on the other hand, do not
 normally invite television teams to witness people being beaten up,
 or tarred and feathered or (as in Vietnam) the disembowelling of
 recalcitrants.  Certainly, television interviewers have been known
 to present terrorists in a sympathetic light.  But if society is to be
 protected from terrorism, it is incumbent on the authorities to make
 the extra effort needed to enlist the cooperation of media personnel -
 not to present a distorted view in favour of official action, but merely
 a fair present ation of the need for counter-measures in the common
 interest.
 Much remains to be done in preventing terrorists from gaining
 access to explosive materials and to weapons.  I realise that in the
 United States you have a special problem because of the wide availability
 of guns.  But the availability of explosive materials can be limited.
 Companies entitled to stockpile such materials should be required to
 guard their supplies.
 ?   As regards such crimes as the hijacking of passenger aircraft,
 very inadequate progress has been made in international law.  The use
 of new technology and the rigorous enforcement of security measures,
 especially in the United States, has drastically reduced the incidence
 of hijacking on internal flights.  On international flights, no real progress
 will. be made until countries offering a safe refuge for hijackers are
 suitably penalised.
 This statement does not, of course, pretend to be exhaustive.  I have
 sought to analyse the problem in its principal aspects.  It is a problem
 that is still growing in scope and danger.  And it is a problem that can-
 not be solved in one country alone:  international as well as national
 action is required.
