				   	[Text]    	Comment~
				  	Tlie  material  you  are  setting  out  to  read  is  a  dialog  between  me  and  Mr  SY~ah~:okh				-
	    	'		    	Vaziri  in  Azar  1356   	(December  1g77)   	for  the  compl~tion  of  his  doctoral  disserta-
				  	tion  which  he  would  be  defending  at  Lausanne  University   	(Swi~zerland).    	The  dis-
	    	-		    	sertation  was  ~o  be  entitled  "From  Qanat  to  Oil  Pipeline--Petroleum  and  Power."
				  	It  was  agreed  that  Mr  Vaziri  co~uld  use  any  part  of  our  discussion  he  considered
				  	useful  for  his  paper  with  my  consent.
				  	The  processing  of  the  dissertation  was  delayed  for  various  reasons,   	including  some		  	~
				  	of  a~  academic  nature.    	It  explains  why  the  intarview,  which  was  held  in  Azar  1356
				   	(December  1977)   	is  only  now  being  published  after  more  than  a  year's  delay.    	I  must
				  	o'~  necessity  remind  you  that  the  contents  of  the  ir~~erview  were  ineluctibly  con-
	    	-		    	strained  by  the  limit~tion  of  the  questions  as  formulated.    	Therefore:
				  	1.    	Given  its  limitations  and  brevity,   	the  interview  falls  short  of  satisfying  the
				  	inquisitiveness  of  the  reader;
				  	2.    	Concepts  have  been  intermixed  in  the  process  of  the  interview.
				  	Over  the  year  that  has  transpired  since  the  date  of  this  interview  and  the  delay,
				  	which  has  not  been  of  my  doing,   	our  compatriots  have  embarked  on  a  vehement  struggle
	     	~		    	against  the  shah's  regime  which  is  daily  gathering  momentum.							     	-
	    	-		    	The  altruism  and  valor  of  our  people  in  their  fight  against  ~ne  present  oppressive,
	    	_		    	bloodsucking  regime  and  to  establish  demociatic  freednms.and  political,   	soci.~~.,
	    	_		    	economic  and  cultural.  reforms  suited  to  the  characteristics  of  our  coun~ry  and  people,
				  	have  become  a  source  of  wonder  and  adulation    	by  the  world.    	In  this  revolutionary		  	=
				  	situation  in  which  the  ~overnment  can  only  rule  by  daily  massacre,   	in  which  tha.
				  	peot~le  refuse  to  put  up  with  this  oppressive,   	despotic  and  corrupt  government  any
				  	longer  and  want  ta  bring  it  to  an  end,   	a  dis:iplined  and  experienced  gol~.tical  or-
				  	ganization  which  can  cc~mmand  the  confidence  of  the  people  and  of  the  toiling  ma-
				  	jority  of  the  Iranian  r,~ation  in  such  a  way  as  to  assume  their  leadership  in  this
				  	struggle  or  at  least  to  participate  in  the  struggle  effectively  is  nonexistent    	in
				  	our  country.    	This  is  the  unpardonable  sin  of  those  who  have  been  sitting  as  ex-
				  	patriates  in  "socialist  countYies"  for  more  than  20  years  and  who  "rule"  over  a
				  	handful  of  party  members   	from  a  distance,   	a  group  of  party  members  who  are  desperate,
	    	-		    	malcontents  and  forced  into  silent  immigration.    	Thus  they  are  incapable  of  provid-
				  	ing.the  peoplp  of  Iran  with  an  or.ganfzation  which  can  offer  a  lucid  political,  so-'
				  	cial,  economic  and  :ultural  platform.													    	_

				 	Foreword																						-
				 	I  did  not  find  the  opportunity  within  the  context  of  this  study  to  go  into  the  role
				 	played  by  the  So,viet  Union  in  Iran  throughout  the  course  of  the  nat:onalization  of		  	-
				 	~l~e  ~ranian  oil  indus~:ry~    	Thls  was  not  because  I  considered  the  issue  incansequen-
				 	t~a~l,  but  because  au~hentic  information  and  reliable  :estimony  about  the  role  of  the
				 	~ouiet  Union  in  tt~e  matt2r  was  absolutely  unavailable.    	This  was  also  the  case  with		 	~
				 	regard  to  the  activities  of  the  Tudeh  Party  up  to  the  time  it  was  declared  illegal
				 	and  barred  from  activity.    	This  was  particularly  true  as  regards  the  policies			    	-
				 	adopted  by  some  of  the  leadzrs  of  the  Tudeh  Party  of  Yran.    	As  will  be  seen,  they
	    	_		   	deviated  from  the  political  line  declared  by  the  party.
				 	The,following  interview  enables  us  to  shed  light  on  the  details  and  some  abscure		     	�
				 	goin~s  of  the  role  and  activity  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  Tudeh  Party  of  Iran  at		  	-
				 	tl~is  stage  and,  in  my  opinion,   	it  further  serves  the  purpose  of  bringing  out  the		     	�
				 	role  of  some  intellectuals  in  tihe  political  life  of  their  country--particularly
				 	appl.icable  to  the  developing  countries--and  shows  how  the  intell~gentsia  is  over-
				 	whelmed  by  events  if  the  intellectuals  are  sincere,  and  how  their  activity  comes
				 	up,against  the  opposition  and  intervention  of  forcign  powers  and  t~:ei~  agents  is~
				 	th,eir  political  affairs.
	   	'		   	Dr  Kesl~avarz,,  who  consented  to  this  interview,   	is  a  well-lenown  palitical  peraonage
				 	in,Iraa.today.    	He  is  a  noted  and  highly  celebrated  leader  of  the  Tudeh  Party  be-
				 	caus~~he  was  a.member  of  the  pxrty  Central  Committee  and  the  Executive  BoArd.
	   	_		    	BoXn.i.u.]:9U7,  Dr.  Keshavarz  completed  his  study  in  medicine  in  Paris.    	After  spec~al-
				 	izi~ng  i~,pedia~ri;cs,  he  went  td  Iran.    	His  practice  constantly  brought  him  up  against
				 	t}}e  3~~ustice  ~nd  s;ta~rk  social  disparities  in  Ixan.    	This  kin~;led  in  him  the  urge
				 	~,o,  tal~e:  po~:iti~al  actio~,  ii?  order  to  bring  about  profound  economic,   	social  snd  po13.-
				 	t~~:ca~:;  cl~a~g,e  in.  Irau;.    	That  e~tplains  why  he  3oined  the  TudQh  Party  of  Iran  at  its
				 	i~nceptinn.    	1~he  Tudeh  Party  of  Iran  was  the  only  organized  party  at  th~  time  that
				 	proclaimed  a  progressive  political  policy  and  declared  +the  impexativeness  of  deep

				  	IntervieW  With  Dr  Keshavarz
				  	Question:    	Dr  Keahavarz,  before  entering  into  the  subject  of  our  interview,   	I  would
				  	2~ke~tia  ask  you,~to  intra~.auce  yaurself  and  to  talk  generally  about  your  political

				  	anytbing  publ.ishec~  in  t~e  last  30  years.    	Part  of  those  2  years  I  was  a  professor		    	~

				  	tind~r  my  name  apart  from  those  articles  I  mentioned.    	Therefore,   	this  is  the  first
				  	time  that  my  views  and  o~iuions  are  to  see  the  light.    	However,  I  must  remind  you		    	-
				  	tt}.a.t  my  vie~ws  and  opinions  have  been  aired  and  defended  inside  the  Tudeh  Party  of		    	-
				  	Iran  and  its  Central  Committee  starting  in  1951,   	that  is,   	2  years  after  my  emigra-

	 	~			of  Irsn,   	the  one  which  was  established  in  1320   	(1941),  about  40  years  ago.    	I  was
			 	a  member  of  the  highest  organ  of  the  party  leadership.    	Therefore,   	I  share  respon-		     	-
			 	sib ility  for  the  decisions  of  these  organs,   	even  when  I  was  against  their  adoption,		    	~
			 	up  to  15  Bahman  1327   	(February  1949),  that  is,   	the  day  the  shah  was  shot  at  and
	 	-			when  the  party  went  underground.    	I  hold  myself  responsible  because  I  left  Irgt1
			 	with  Secretary  General  Radmanesh  in  July  1949  at  the  behest  of  the  party  Executive
			 	Board.																	     	~
			 	2.    	After  extensive  study,   	education  and  thinking,   	I  have  come  to  deeplq  believe			  	-
	 	~			in  scientific  socialism.    	I  was  among  the  first  100  m~mbers  of  the  party,  and  if
			 	my  party  membership  card  was  under  number  150  it  taas  because  the  party  membership
			 	cards  were  printed  and  issued  with  a  time  lag  of  a  few  months  due  to  the  party  going		  	-
			 	underground  in  its  infancy.    	Only  a  few  of  those  members  of  the  party  leadership  at		   	:
			  	the  time  are  still  around  and,  like  me,  were  elected  to  the  party  leadership  by  the
			 	First  Tehran  Conference,  later  confirmed  by  the  only  two  congresses  of  the  party.				~
			  	They  can  be  counted  on  the  fingers  of  one  hancl.
			  	The  fixst  elective  gathering  of  the  Tudeh  Party  of  Iran  was  the  First  Tehran  Con-
			  	ference  which  met  secretly  in  Tehran  ixi  1942,   	exactly  1  year  after  the  party's			     	-
			  	establishment.    	Party  leader  Soleyman  Mirza  had  chosen  my  house  for  holding  the			   	~
			  	conference,  but  my  house  was  too  much  in  the  public  eye.    	Therefore,  the  conference
			  	was  held  in  the  house  of  my  younger  brother,  Jamshid  Keshavarz,   	on  Tir  Street,  at			,
			  	my  suggestion.    	He,   	too,  had  become  a  party  member  by  then.    	Less  than  90  persons				~
			  	attended  the  meeting.    	(The  number  I  remember  was  87,  not  the  round  figure  120,   	as		    	;
			  	recorded  by  the  party  leadership.)    	In  this  conference  I  was  elected  as  one  of  15				~
			  	members  of  what  was  later  called  the  "Tehran  Provincial  Committee."    	This  ~ommitiee
			  	was  assigned  to.run  the  party  until  the  convention  of  the  First  Congress  of  the
			  	party.    	The  conference  took  only  one  day,  a  Friday.    	In  the  two  congresses  of  the
			  	party  held  to  date,   	I  was  elected  to  membership  in  the  Central  Committee  and  the			 	,
			  	Executive  Board.																			  	!
			  	The  shooting  at  the  shah  took  place  on  15  Bahman  1327   	(4  February  1949),   	some  3			  	~
			  	years  after  the  defeat  of  the  Azarbayjan  De~ocratic  Party  and  exactlr  9  months			    	'
			  	after  the  holding  of  the  Tudeh  Party  Second  Congress,  which  had  3ust  sur~ri~ed  a
			  	clamorous  bifurcation.    	The  split  came  at  a  juncture  when  the  Tudeh  Party  of  Iran		     	~
			  	had  hardly  begun  to  heal  its  wounds  and  put  its  house  in  order.    	A  young  party  only		  	,
			   	7  years  of  age  was  declared  illegal  at  this  time  and  had  to  go  unde�rground,  while
	  	~		 	it  had  not  even  the  least  experience  for  clandestine  activity.    	/The  third  congress
			   	of  the  party  has  not  been  convened  to  this  date./    	In  May  1958,  upon  my  seli-exile		    	_
			   	to  Moscow  20  years  ago,  after  our  comrade,  Khosrow  Ruzbeh,  had  been  executed   	(19.  May
			   	1958),  I  resigned  from  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Tudeh  Party  of  Iran  and  wrote:
			   	/"I  am  ashamed  of  my  membership  in  this  Central  Committee."/    	One  of  the  reasons
			   	that  forced  me  to  resign  and,   	in  fact,   	Che  very  drop  that  ma.de  mq  "cup  of  p3tience"
	  	-		 	run  ove~  was  the  insults  and  accusations  that  Kambakhsh  and  Kianuri  levelled  against		 	;
			   	Ruzbeh  in  the  corridors  during  the  Fifth  Plenum  of  the  party  when  we  received  news
			   	of  the  arrest  of  Comrade  Ruzbeh.    	Kambakhsh  accused  Comrade  Ruzbeh  of  wanting  to
			   	appear  as  a  hero  (as  he  put  it,  Ruzbeh  "was  playing  the  hero").    	Kianuri  said		   	�
			   	Ruzbeh  was  weak  and  in  possession  of  a  lot  of  information  t1~at  he  might  divulge.			 	�
			   	Later  on  we  learned  in  Moscow  that  when  the  group  escape  from  Qasr  Prison  of  10
			   	members  of  the  party  Central  Committee  was  being  planned,  Kianuri  insisted  that			   	-
	  	_		 	Ruzbeh  should,   	for  the  reason  alleged  earlier   	(that  is,  weakness),   	take  the  place
			   	of  our  officer  comrade,    	Tafreshian,  who  was  supposed  ta  be  among  the  escapees.

				   	.
			    	se.veral  pages)   	I  wrote  (and  I  ask  you  to  print):    	"As  I  said  at  the  Fifth  Plenum,
			    	I  do  not  consider  my  continued  mEmbership  in  the  Central  Committee  to  be  in  the
			    	i~;teres~t  of  the  party  any  longer.    	Although  in  practice  I  have  stayed  away  from

			    	as   	'resignation'   	proper,   	I  hereby  resign  from  this  Central  Committee,  which  in  my
			    	opinion  has  /been  a  source  of  shame  and  notoriety  for  the  liberation  movement  of
			    	Yran,  and  no  effor~s  are  being  made  in  it  to  purge  the  leadership  of  the  party.
			    	~tuch  as  I  take  pride  in  membership  in  the  Tudeh  Party  of  I ran  for  whose  cause  the
			    	best  children  cf  Iran  have  been  martyred,   	equally  do  I  feel  ashamed  of  inembership
			     	3n  the  present  Central  Committee  whose  members  are,   	in  my  opinion,  mostly  competent,
			    	but  wrongdoers  whose  wrongs  are  only  a  hairbreadth  from  treason."/
			    	After  I  had  submitted  this  letter  of  resignation,  a  commission  represeating  the
			    	Central  Committee  and  comprised  of  then  Secretary  General  Radmanesh,   	current  Secre-
			     	tary  General  Iraj   	Eskandari  and  Kambakhsh,  who  was  then  one  of  the  three  party
			     	secretaries,   	called  on  me  at  my  house  in  Moscow  to  "convin~e"  me  to  withdraw  my
			     	resignation  in  a  move  to  avert  damage  to  the  party.    	In  the  course  o~  the  negotia-
			     	tion,  Kambakhsh  claimed  that  my  resignation  would  hurt  not  only  the  Tudeh  Party
	  	_		   	but  also  the  Soviet  Union.     	(Such  arm  twisting    	based  on  the  insinuation  of  "anti-
			     	Soviet  attitudes,"  attempted  by  Kambakhsh  and  Kianuri,   	often  worked  on  party  mem-
			    	bers.)    	At  this  pAint  it  came  to  my  mind  that  a"dossier~'  had  been  fabricated  to
			     	fr~me  my  brother,   	Jamslzid  Ke3havarz,  who  had  emigrated  to  the  Soviet  Union  before
			    	me.    	Tt~ey  had  accused  him  of  speaking  in  unflattering  terms  about  Stalin;   	they
			    	w~ere  planning  to  have  him  exiled  to  Siberia.    	Only  last  minute  intervention  by
			     	Central  Committee  member  Reza  Rusta  had  headed  off   	this  plan.    	That  was  why  I  was
	 	-		   	pers,uaded  to  withdraw  my  resignation,  but  I  pointed  out  that  the  accusations  I
			     	liad  levelled  against  the  Central  Committee  were  well  founded.    	Immediately  after
			     	this  meeting  I  plunged  into  diligent  preparations  to  make  my  exit  from  the  Soviet
			     	Union.    	When  I  was  about  to  leave  the  Soviet  Uni~.on,   	the  party  Central  Committee
			     	threatened  that  I  would  be  expelled  from  the  Central  Committee  if  I  left  the

			     	diss,uade  me  from  leaving  the  Soviet  Un~on.    	Thus,  after  my  resignation,  and  its
			    	withdraw,al  as  a  result  of  the  threat  from  Kambakhsh,   	I  was  "expelled"  from  the
			     	Central  Committee.    	In  addition,   	the  Gentral  Committee  of  the  Tudeh  Party  of  Iran
	 	_		   	wxote  a  letter  to  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union

			    	which  was  attributed  to  me  in  a  case  which  is  still  open.    	It  is  necessary  to  point
			     	out  here  that  I  did  not  have  the  faintest  idea  of  this  shooting  incident  nor  any
			     	passible  connection  with  it.    	Neither  did  the  Central  Committee  nor  the  Executive
	    	-		 	Board  of  the  party.    	Even  the  secretary  general  was  completely  ignorant  of  the
			     	matter.
	    	_		 	Some  years  after  this  incident,   	something  which  I  will  explain  later  happened  when
	    	.		 	we  learned  in  Moscow  that  Kianuri  had  been  in  touch  with  Nasser  Fakhrara'i,  the  ,
			     	would-be  assassin,  some  months  before  the  shooting  attempt  on  the  shah.    	The  two
			     	counts  on  which  I  was  condemned  to  death,   	to  which  I  r~ferred  earlier,  indicate
			     	that  my  activity  as  a  member  of  the  party  leadership,  as  a  deputy  to  the  National
			     	Consultative  Assembly  (Majles),   	and  as  minister  of  culture  and  higher  education
	    	-		 	had  been  eff ective  enough  to  stir  the  indignation  and  spite  of  the  ruling  elite  of
			     	Iran  against  me.    	This  matter  has  also  been  mentioned  in  my  biography  inserted  in
	   	~		 	the  journal  MARDOM  (PEOPLE),   	the  organ  of  the  party,  which  I  place  at  your  d'.aposal.
			     	Brecht  put  it  aptly  in  his  statement:    	"Bein~  sentenced  to  execution  is  not  given
			     	as  a  present;   	it  is  earned."    	So  that  you  ~aay  have  an  indication  of  how  much  my
			     	activities  had  irritated  the  rulers  of  Iran,   	it  would  be  sufficient  for  you  to  know
			     	that  the  day  after  the  death  sentencee  on  some  members  of  the  Tudeh  Party  had  been
			     	announceci,   	all  the  newspapers  printed  a  list  ~f  the  party  leaders,  which  was  topped
			     	by  my  name  as  leadar  of  the  ~udeh  Party  of  Iran,   	printed  even  above  the  name  of  the
			     	party  secretary  general.    	Such  a  designation  did  not  exist  in  the  party  after  Soley-
			     	man  Mirza.																			'
			     	Ever  since  I  have  been  an  emigre,   	those  party  comrades  who  dissent  from  the  leader-
					ship  of  the  party  and  many  of  my  compatriots  ~~ith  varying  political  leanings  have

					that  I  have  never  and  in  no  way  heen  a  member  of  any  group  or  party  other  than  the
					Tudeh  Party  of  Iran./    	My  real  activity  in  the  Tudeh  Party  of  Iran  and  in  its  lEader-
					ship,  like  the  real  activity  of  a  number  of  other  members  of  the  leadership  and
					cadres  of  the  party  who  emigrated  from  Iran,  was  cut  off  as  of  15  Bahman  1327   	(1949),
					i.e.,  the  day  the  attempt  on  the  shah's  life  was  made.    	From  then  on  the  members  of

	    	_		 	Yazdi  and  Boqrati,  on  the  other.    	The  latter  g~oup  was  weak  in  information  and
					theory,   	and  inert  and  listless  in  action.
					It  was  only  from  around  1956  onward  that  the  party  Central  Committee  assumed  the
					leadership  of  the  party  again--in  exile.    	That  was  after  some  membera  of  Che  Execu-

	  	~		 	in  Iran  and  in  the  world.
			   	On  the  foreign  score,   	after  residing  in  the  Soviet  Union  as  a  political  emi~re  for		    	i
			   	many  years,  I  was   	invited  to  Baghdad  as  professor  of  children's  diseases  in  195Q  at
			    	the  personal  instruction  of  the  late  Gen   	'Ab d  al-Karim  Qasim,   	Iraq's   	f irst  presi-
			    	dent.    	The  party  Central  Committee  opposed  my  departure  from  the  Soviet  Union  /and
			    	requested  of  the  Central  Committee  of  Che  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Unon  in  a				,
			    	letter  that  I  be  denied  an  exit  visa./    	In  this  cor.nection,   	it  became  necessary  for

	  	-		  	Comir~unist  Party  of   	the  Soviet  Union  for  several  hours.    	These  officials  told  me  that
			    	they  had  a  problem  because  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Tudeh  Party  had  asked  them
			    	to  prevent  me  from  leaving  the  Soviet  Union.    	Af ter  my  departure  from  the  Soviet
			    	Union,   	the  Central  Committee  of  the  Tudeh  Party  wrote  a  letter  to  all  sister  parties,
			    	informing  them  that  I  had  been  expelled  from  the   	Central  Committee  of  the  party  and
			    	that  I  was  barred   	from  contacts.    	The  text  of  th is  letter  was  given  to  me  by  the
			    	secretary  general  of   	the  ruling  Communist  Party  of  a  European  country.
			    	I  deem  it  necessary  to  tell  you  that  the  Centr.al   	Committee  does  not  recognize  me
			     	even  as  a  simple  member  of  the  party   	(without  my  having  been  expelled  from  the
	  	_		  	party  and  without   	this  expulsion  or  its  reason  having  been  printed  o r  announced
			     	anywhere).    	However,   	I  have  long  since  denounced   	this  party  "leadership"  as  illegi-

			 	cerity.    	The  principles  of  scientif ic  socialism  have  always  been  my  watchword.
			  	(Many  of  my  party  comrades  and  compatriots  who  have  met  me  know  that  I  have  long			 	~
	 	~		 	given  up  the  use  of  the  term  "Marxism-Leninism"  because  I  have  come  to  the  cott-
			 	clusion  that  "Marxism-Leninism"  does  not  fully  define  scientific  social~.sm.    	This
			 	pvsition  of  mine  does  not  mean  that  the  respect  I  have  always  had  fox  gtr~at  men
			 	has  diminished  in  any  degree.    	Not  at  all,   	for  Marx  and  Lenin  were  great  men  and
			 	two  geniuses  in  the  history  of  mankind.    	Pasteur  and  Koch,   	too,  were  great  men  and		    	_
	 	-		 	p~dminent  scientists  who  rendered  great  services  to  mankind.    	They  were  the  founders
		_		 	of  microbialogy  and  new  medicine.    	However,  nobody  thought  of  coining  the  term
			  	"Pasteurism-Kochism"   	for.  defining  microbiology.    	Each  science  wds  developed  and
		~		 	advanced  as  a  result  of   	the  efforts  and  work  of  hundreds  and  thousands  of  persons.
			  	Among  these  scientists,   	a  couple  or  a  handful  were  stronger  and  more  outstanding
			  	and,  as  tt  were,  geniuses.    	Imagine  what  confusion  would  reign  if  the  names  of  a
			  	number  of  these  scientists  were  trsncated  one  after  another  in  order  to  designate
			  	eacli  science.    	Besides,   	Marx,   	Engels  and  Lenin  themselves  were  against  this.)
	 	-		 	In  all  my  talks  with  foreign  statesmen  and  heads  of  governments,including  those  of		    	_
			  	the  Soviet  Union,  I  made  it  quite  clear,  politely  but  firmly,   	that  I  was  not  a
			  	quiet  man  in  the  sense  that  I  would  succumb  to  the  orders  of  internal  or  foreign
			  	authorities.    	tn  short,   	that  I  caould  not  become  a  lackey,  buC  that  my  brain  and
			  	my  lifetime  experience  were  my  guiding  lights,   	that  I  would  preserve  my  independence			_
			  	of  will.    	I  made  it  clearly  understood,  among  other  things,   	that  despite  my  severe
			  	criticism  of  and  deep  disagreement  with  the  policies  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the
			  	countries  of  the  Eastern  bloc  and  of  China--God  knows  what  severe  criticisms  and
			  	deep  differences  of  opinion  I  had  with  them--I  was  not  the  kind  of  person  who  would
		_		  	villify  this  or  that  person  at  the  behest  of  others  in  order  to  be  rewarded  with
			  	the  title  of  secretary  general  of  this  or  that  party  or  to  gain  material  conces-
			  	sions.    	This  is  something  to  which  those  concerned  can  attest  in  all  honesty.
		=		  	I  am  not  of  the  fiber  of  vituperators  and  killers.    	I  am  a  physician  and  m.entally
			  	open  to  discussion  and  negotiation.    	When  I  was  in  the  party  I  always  observed  the
			   	constitution  of  the  party.    	Outside  the  party,   	I  have  followed  the  human  code  of
			   	conduct  and  expression.
			  	However,  later  on,   	in  the  world  we  see,  in  which  the  declared  socialism  is  not  so-
			   	cialism  proper,   	in  which  internationalism  is  only  a  veneer  masking  narrow-minded
			   	nationalistic  views  and  an  excuse  for  prescrib ing  interventionist  policies,   	I  came
			   	Co   	the  conclusion  that  under  the  circumstances  the  national  liberation  movements
			   	of  the  developing  countries  should  jealously  and  tenaciously  cling  to  their  inde-
			   	pendence  of   	thought,  judgment  and  action.    	Help  can  be  accepted,  but  or  the  proviso
			   	that  there  be  no  political,   	economic  or  military  strings  attached,   	that  it  not  make
			   	them  dependent  followers  and  not  damage  the  true  independence  of  these  movements.
			   	The  quandary  in  which  I~Iulla  Mustafa  Barzani  got  himself  caught  by  accepting  "help"
			   	from  the  shah  of  Iran  had  grave  consequences  for  the  Kurdish  movement--and  this
