 April 1, 1965            CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 the applicant's probabilities of parole ad-
 justment  based  on  behavior  attitudinal
 changes  and  accomplishments within the
 institution.
 He will probably be released without any
 real preparation for the job secured for him
 and placed under the supervision of a parole
 officer whom he has never seen before and
 who on the first contact makes sure the
 releases is fully aware of the fact that he
 can be sent back for any of a whole series of
 violations, many of which are ludicrous in a
 contemprary society.  Or he may on the
 other hand have spent part time during the
 last few months in the institution attending
 prerelease meetings, may have met his parole
 officer and may have found in that officer, a
 counselor, a friend and guide.
 But the very real probability is that be-
 ginning with arrest through the jail until
 final release from probation or parole, he will
 have  had  an  experience  which  reflects
 nothing of a continuous, meaningful, super-
 vision and experience.  All too little of his
 experiences will have been with anyone ex-
 cept other offenders and officers of the court
 or institution. He will have very little feel-
 ing that he has undergone a kind of social
 process in which he has relationships with
 normal people leading normal lives in a
 normal community.  With few exceptions,
 we have a long way to go in this country to
 create, develop, and administer a continuous
 correctional process which is designed to re-
 train, redevelop, and create maximum im-
 pact toward social adjustment of offenders.
 When I referred earlier to the need for re-
 search and development I perhaps sounded a
 little too academic and you may well have
 wondered: Can we really apply the principle
 of research and development to corrections?
 I think so.  If a correctional administrator
 genuinely and seriously wants to determine
 the extent to which his system is succeeding
 or failing in reaching accepted goals then he
 needs research.  He will then want to de-
 termine whether more effective techniques,
 methods and programs can be designed than
 those which have been traditionally used.
 This means setting up new kinds of ap-
 proaches and measuring the results against
 those which have been traditionally used.
 This may apply to a wide range of program
 elements.   It may mean a complete reex-
 amination of the philosophy on which tradi-
 tional approaches have been based.  Results
 of self-study, and research, and demonstra-
 tion projects may, in turn, have tremendous
 impact upon modifying, revising, and chang-
 ing the philosophy of correctional adminis-
 tration.
 What new kinds of development can we
 foresee?  Let's examine together for a mo-
 ment one recent major development in cor-
 rections: a rising interest in the halfway
 house.  Community groups-including sev-
 eral religious organizations-saw the need
 for a bridge between institutions and the
 community.   Halfway  houses were  estab-
 lished in a number of cities including Los
 Angeles; Chicago; Minneapolis; Wilmington,
 Del.; St. Louis; and others.  These took a
 variety of forms from small family residential
 units to larger come-one-come-all programs.
 An institution in New York State for de-
 linquent  girls  developed  several  halfway
 houses which were  In  reality residential
 facilities within a city supplementing the
 residential programs at the institution.
 In our Federal correctional system, we now
 have four prerelease guidance centers for
 youthful offenders, in New York, Detroit, Los
 Angeles, and Chicago.  A fifth will open this
 spring here in Washington, D.C.
 I believe the halfway house concept should
 be extended to selected adult prisoners, now
 that it has proven its worth among youthful
 offenders.
 Another imaginative new program that I
 believe would prove successful for Federal
 prisoners is a work-release program similar
 to those employed in such State systems as
 Wisconsin and North Carolina.  This plan
 was conceived as the Huber law in Wiscon-
 sin.  Under the plan, penitentiary inmates
 are employed outside the prison during the
 day, after suitability has been determined by
 staff evaluation.
 In a visit to North Carolina last year, I
 learned that of 10,000 prisoners committed
 to the North Carolina prison system, nearly
 1,000 work under this work-release program,
 paying expenses for board and room at the
 prison, supporting families, sometimes saving
 money  and  maintaining  and  developing
 skills. Transfers from Institutions to the
 community become almost a paper trans-
 action;
 The entire State of North Carolina, as rep-
 resented by newspaper editorials, accepts and
 is extremely proud of its development.  I
 learned recently that California is now cre-
 ating an extensive work-release program.
 In  this  kind  of  change  we  can foresee
 changes in philosophy as the result of eval-
 uatign and demonstration projects which
 may well pinpoint a revolution in our field.
 Professor  Glaser's study of inmates re-
 leased from Federal institutions which has
 been carried on for the past 5 years under
 a grant from the Ford Foundation, Is re-
 sulting in revision of institutional programs
 in the Federal system.  All of us are ac-
 quainted with the California research on
 probation officer caseloads, on intensive pa-
 role  supervision,  in  administration.  Al-
 though I cite only a few examples, I hope
 they are perceptible as indexes of the kind
 of  correctional  administration which can
 produce planned change.
 The need for completely new concepts of
 management in personnel training and de-
 velopment Is becoming abundantly clear.         I
 suggested earlier that we are inclined to
 think we have a good correctional institu-
 tion If we have an experienced warden and
 some staff people who have been trained in
 the behavioral sciences.  But thus far, our
 training of line personnel-that is the people
 who have the regular day to day contacts
 with   institution   inmates-Is  restricted
 usually to not more than high school grad-
 uation.  In service training is devoted pri-
 marily to correctional skills such as counts,
 locks, locking devices, use of gas, riot plans,
 escape plans.  Yet these are the people who
 -deal most directly and have the greatest im-
 pact upon the inmates of our institutions.
 Because of the compelling need for this kind
 of training, our center at Southern Illinois
 University Is designing a subprofessional
 training curriculum for correctional officers.
 Briefly, this is planned to be a 2-year sub-
 professional curriculum, designed to instill
 insights and understandings from the be-
 havioral sciences and some skills in dealing
 with behavior problems.  We can't possibly
 insist that every correctional worker must
 have a college degree.  As a matter of fact,
 unemployed youth and young  adults can
 be remotivated and given training for jobs in
 corrections.  This will elevate the base com-
 petence of the whole body of correctional
 personnel.
 Moreover, we need extended and continu-
 ous training in public administration for our
 administrators.    We need training at the
 supervisory level and continuous develop-
 ment of people working in the behavioral
 disciplines.    It is   from  this  kind  of
 philosophy of personnel administration that
 we can accelerate the evolution of correc-
 tions.
 Finally, I have spoken of our failure to use
 community resources.    All too often we think
 that in corrections we can't get on with the
 job unless we have all the staff needed on
 our immediate payroll.   This simply isn't
 true.  A new trend to build correctional in-
 stitutions in close proximity to universities
 is a case in point. Universities offer tremen-
 dous resources which have been used all too
 -6381
 rarely and all too little in years gone by;
 and yet, in terms of personnel training and
 development,  research  in  the behavioral
 sciences and consulting services in sociology,
 in education, in special education, and voca-
 tional training 'are available in the larger
 universities. This conference is evident of
 the fact that universities are available as re-
 sources for correctional development.
 But beyond this there are available a wide
 variety of other resources.  Talent can be
 brought into the institution from the com-
 munity. munity.  Inmates can be taken from the in-
 stitutions into the community for purposes
 other than a work-release program.  I need
 only mention League of Women Voters, or
 women's clubs, various professional societies
 who are always willing to help in public in-
 stitutions;  libraries, recreation associations
 and so on through a long list of community
 resources which we have rarely attempted to
 use.  In probation and parole, I like these re-
 cent                                                                                                                                   experimental programs which  bring
 small groups of probationers and parolees to-
 gether under the guidance of psychologists
 and group therapists, or skilled probation of-
 ficers who can discuss with a group their
 common problems.  This I think will one
 day lead to the development of new kinds
 of community correctional facilities based
 right in the community as contrasted to our
 present jails and prisons all too often off in
 some far part of the community or the State,
 Yes, we must look to the use of community
 resources in a way never dreamed of up to
 this time,
 I am convinced that one of our serious mis-
 takes is to try to rehabilitate everyone.  We
 extend the same processes, procedures, and
 programs to all,  I get a little weary some-
 times of going to large penitentiaries and
 seeing old, recidivistic offenders being given
 vocational  training,  education,  and the
 gamut of our treatment processes for the
 third, fourth, or fifth time. Now this is a
 little dangerous to say.  I don't mean that
 we should return to the old bighouse philoso-
 phy.                                                                                                                             On the other hand, I think we must
 begin to be selective in the use of our re-
 sources, particularly personnel and funds.
 When we try to give the same kind of edu-
 cation, treatment, and therapy to the old
 lugs that we give to the youthful and young
 adult offenders, we usually wind up with the
 youth and young offenders getting a pretty
 skimpy  program.  Realistic  administration
 must concentrate the resources on those
 offenders and in those areas which are most
 promising.  This, coupled with research and
 development, would suggest  that  we  can
 become much more realistic than we have
 up to now.
 I told you of my recent visit to North
 Carolina.  I asked Mr. George Randal, com-
 missioner of corrections, how he was able
 to accomplish all these interesting new de-
 velopments in his State.  He leaned back
 in his chair, "Well, I am tired of hearing cor-
 rectional administrators declare 'I have noth-
 ing to do with politics in my system'."  Says
 Randal, "That's not at all realistic.  I have
 to look to the legislature and to State offi-
 cials                                                                                                                             for  support,  for  understanding, for
 funds, for personnel, and for the means to
 accomplish about everything I want to. I'm
 one of the most active politicians in my
 State."
 "I know everybody in the legislature. I see
 them frequently.  I don't go through a State
 senator's county without stopping to say
 hello.  I argue the hard facts of corrections   -
 with them.  I do everything in my power to
 influence them to support corrections and
 they are supporting it.  And it does pay off."
 I suggest that Commissioner Randal has
 a convincing approach to the relationship be-
 tween corrections and political realities.
 Another fact I have seen demonstrated in
 a number of places around the country, not
 only in North Carolina,, Is that correctional
 administrators all too often underestimate

 the public.  If we give them the information
 and spell out the public's stake in good cor-
 rections. we may well discover that they're
 far ahead of us In accepting new approaches
 in corrections. The Huber law, under which
 jail inmates work in the community and re-
 turn to the jail at night, Is fully accepted In
 Wisconsin.   When the public understands
 the issues Involved, they are intrigued with
 the human approaches and will Insist upon
 them.  In North Carolina the new kind of
 program which places a thousand working
 inmates in the community each day is ac-
 cepted editorially by every newspaper in the
 State. I am coming to believe that the old
 saw that "we can't move very far ahead of
 the public" is a delusion and is perpetuated
 by many of us In corrections as an alibi for
 our own failures to get on with the job which
 the future demands.

 States, Including New York.  That is why the
 liberal Senator JACOB JAVrrs is going along
 part of the way.
 Also. DIRKSEN senses the need for haste
 even on such a large and significant ques-
 tion. The battle to get fair reapportionment
 by the. Court's  standard has hardly been
 joined.  As it progresses, if it Is allowed to,
 the  public's understanding of what is at
 stake will mount.  This is especially true of
 the civil rights forces, who stand to gain the
 most under the voting rights bill which now
 preoccupies them.
 There are many extraordinary aspects of
 the Senate's haste to fall in line behind
 DIRKSEN's banner.
 The big States with their great cities are
 the base of the Democratic Party's strength
 and must continue to be.   The  topheavy
 majorities that they have enabled the party
 to gain in Congress seem to have no place
 In the thinking of Senate Democratic Leader
 MIKE MANSFIELD, who once more is prepared
 to swing along with his opposition leader.
 Really staggering, however, is the Senate's
 near-total indifference to the- true condition
 of the State legislatures in today's world.
 Even casual readers of newspapers must ob-
 serve their many internal weaknesses,  Ex-
 perts have come to question their capacity
 to deal with new and complex questions.
 Their  conflicts of interest are a cliche.
 These arise out of the poor support they get
 from home as well as their poor pay.
 It would appear that the Senate should be
 welcoming the winds of change to air the
 stale legislative chambers and give the States
 a better chance.  Instead, it seems bent on
 defending the indefensible, and It is a charge
 upon the whole Senate to explore what is
 r.
 Mr. F.Xwident, recently
 the               s 1tution  editorially
 sought reason for the decline in the stra-
 tegic position of the United States in
 southeast Asia.   Editors of the paper
 view our air strikes in North Vietnam
 as evidencing our ineptitude in the type
 of warfare we have faced there, causing
 policymakels to shore up our positionby
 resort to quite a different type warfare-
 one in which we excel.  But these editors
 warn that in order to realize our policy
 goals in Asia, we have still to solve the
 fundamental problem: How to win in
 nonmilitary warfare.
 We may win battles in the name of peoples,
 but unless we win the peoples themselves
 they will go their own way regardless of
 how the battles went.  Most South Vietna-
 mese care little about ideological terms like
 communism and democracy.  They'll go with
 the government that offers them the best
 system for meeting their own needs.
 It is more clearly stated. The Atlanta
 Constitution identifies the area of our
 weakness:
 Bombing may end the shooting, but the
 Vietcong may win the war.  If our counter-
 insurgency effort In South Vietnam was in-
 ffi

 favorable ones, and communism can still take
 the underdeveloped world.
 This states the problem very plainly.
 Strategic computations indicate that we
 can hold on militarily in southeast Asia.
 But a military holding action is only
 temporary. Real victory will be achieved
 by one side or the other through superior
 application of techniques of nonmilitary
 warfare-persuasion, popular conviction
 that either one governing system or the
 other "offers them the best system for
 meeting their own needs."
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the full text of the editorial en-
 titled "United States Must Not Quit Too
 Easily on Basic Problem in Vietnam,"
 from the Atlanta Constitution of March
 6, 1965, be printed in the RECORD at this
 point in my remarks.
 The Atlanta Constitution, incidentally,
 has editorially endorsed the Freedom
 Academy bill.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Atlanta (Ga.)  Constitution of
 Mar. 6, 1965]
 UNITED STATES MUSTN'T QUIT Too EASILY ON
 BASIC PROBLEM  IN VIETNAM
 Our American tendency to leap to whole-
 hog conclusions may yet dissipate and de-
 stroy the hard lessons we have learned in
 Vietnam.
 The current bombing of North Vietnam
 has reconstituted the U.S. position in South
 Vietnam.   It has probably made negotia-
 tions for a cease-fire possible.
 If luck runs well, the United States may
 soon be able to sit down across the table
 from the Communists and settle the war as
 we have known it.
 If this had been tried a month ago, the
 Communists would have been able to dero-
 gate U.S. demands and ask, "If we don't agree,
 what are you going to do about it?"  Under
 the old rules the United States could only
 have said, "We will fight you in the paddies
 for 10 more years," and might have had to.
 Now, if negotiations come to pass, and the
 Communists ask, "What are you going to do
 about it if we don't agree?" the United States
 can reply, "We are going to remove a dozen
 more of your North Vietnamese towns from
 the map of Asia."  Thus the bombing has
 presented to the Communists a wholly new
 encouragement to talk seriously about peace.
 This is altogether to be desired.  And if
 negotiations now come to pass, and end to
 the guerrilla war may be in sight.
 But we Americans will be throwing away
 everything we have learned in Vietnam if
 we jump to either of two assumptions: First,
 that this means South Vietnam will stay
 non-Communist, and second, that this means
 U.S. military counterinsurgency in the pad-
 dies is a failure and that bombing alone is
 decisive.
 The fact is that while bombing in con-
 junction with the years of counterinsur-
 gency may bring the war to a decision point,
 the decision may be delusive.   For if we
 assume that a mere guaranteed cease-fire
 and a graceful U.S. withdrawal can settle the
 Communist issue for the South Vietnamese,
 we're probably wrong; they may promptly
 opt for communism themselves, under the
 various prevailing pressures.
 Communism has long assumed it can meet
 southeast Asia's needs better than free sys-
 tems can, and even if the Vietcong is forced
 by our bombing to make a surface peace
 now, their long-range assumption will per-
 sist.                                                                 The only real answer to the Commu-
 nist assumption is to prove our own assump-
 tion-that free systems can excel commu-
 nism in meeting the needs of people.  This
 has been a major part of our 10-year ground
 effort in South Vietnam, with the military
 spearheading it.  It has been inconclusive.
 Otherwise the bombing of North Vietnam
 wouldn't have been needed.   While it has
 failed in many areas of the country, however,
 it has succeeded in many areas. It also is
 the really meaningful combat out there.  It
 has been a start along the right track.
 Yet if bombing of North Vietnam proves
 superficially effective in bringing a surface
 end to the short-range shooting in the south,
 Americans may be tempted to writeoff the
 counterinsurgency, civic action, and special
 forces techniques on the ground, and assume
 bombing is all we need.  There are indica-
 tions within the U.S. Army itself that this
 mistake is about to be made.  It would be
 a dangerous mistake.  Bombing may end the
 shooting, but the Vietcong may win the war.
 If  our counterinsurgency effort  in South
 Vietnam was insufficient, then we must value
 the lessons learned and perfect the system,
 not overlook the lessons and abandon the
 system.
 No matter  what short-term papers the
 bombers may force the Communists to sign,
 the long-term dispositions in southeast Asia
 will be decided by the people who live there.
 And if communism offers them more effec-
 tive political, economic, social, and military
 systems than we can muster, our failures on
 the ground will endure long after our heroics
 in the air have been forgotten.  Our failure
 in Vietnam has been primarily political, not
 military,  and  superficial  bombing  cannot
 erase the need for some long-range learning
 on the part of the United States.  The start
 we made over the past 10 years in Vietnam
 may have been one of the most valuable
 strides toward realistic competition with
 communism that this Nation has under-
 taken.  Military power is required to force
 decisions, as we have learned.  But political
 effectiveness must accompany it, or the deci-
 sions will be unfavorable ones, and commu-
 nism                                                                 can still  take  the  underdeveloped
 world.
 Mr. MUNDT.  Mr. President, a recent
 New York Times article concurs in the
 contention of our inadequacy in psycho-
 logical warfare.                                                                    Written by Seth S.
 King, the article quotes an American ad-
 viser to the South Vietnamese:
 They [the Vietcong] always take the initia-
 tive and we can only try to run around and
 put out the fires.
 To be perfectly honest, the Army of South
 Vietnam just isn't interested in psychologi-
 cal warfare.  They think it's a waste of time
 even if we are willing to make most of the
 effort for them.
 I ask unanimous consent that this ar-
 ticle, entitled "Vietcong Ahead in Propa-
 ganda War", from the New York Times
 of March 17, 1965, be printed in the
 RECORD at this point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the New York Times, Mar. 17, 1965.1
 VIETCONG AHEAD IN PROPAGANDA WAR
 (By Seth S. King)
 BANMETHUOT, SOUTH VIETNAM, March 15.-
 Rejoin your loved ones who are longing to
 see you.                                  You are only being used as bullet
 shields by the Communists.  Your Govern-
 ment will help you return to your homes."
 Leaflets bearing this message have been
 floating down on towns and villages in the
 sparsely populated but strategically vital
 Central Highlands of South Vietnam.
 The leaflets have been aimed at persuad-
 ing young Vietnamese who have joined the
 Vietcong guerrillas to desert and return to
 their families.
 The effort is part of a new campaign of
 psychological warfare inspired and financed
 by the United States and pressed upon the
 South Vietnamese Army by young American
 military advisers.
 The United States is planning to expand
 the large information force already in South
 Vietnam and to provide it with more money.
 In the last 6 weeks as the struggle for con-
 trol of the highlands has moved into a new
 phase as the Vietcong try to out South Viet-
 nam in two.  The propaganda war that ahs
 accompanied this drive has also been stepped
 up, and once again the Vietcong appear to
 have sped past the Government.
 Vietcong agents have been matching the
 Government at every turn, even in the dis-
 tribution of expertly printed leaflets in two
 colors.
 Where the Government must fly over the
 sector in American planes  equipped  with
 loudspeakers, the Vietcong go into the vil-
 lages and spend several days employing the
 "three withs"-eating with, sleeping with,
 and working with the people.
 Communist guerrillas have shown unex-
 pected speed  and dexterity  in spreading
 their propaganda in the highlands.
 REGIME EFFORT ASSAILED
 A Vietcong leaflet picked up at Quaingduc,
 near the Cambodian border, contained on
 one side the following:  "Struggle for bet-
 ter pay and guarantee of long life.  Do not
 support the Government in its fighting.  If
 you do you will die and your life will be
 wasted."
 On the other side of the leaflet was a brief
 newsletter telling of Vietcong successes in
 the attack on the American billet at Quinhon
 and in closing Route 1 along the coast.  It
 ended by saying that members of the Gov-
 ernment "are fighting each other in Saigon
 even now."
 The leaflet was dated February 19, the day
 of the most recent coup d'etat attempted in
 Saigon.
 Other leaflets have been found all over
 the area promising "help and kind treat-
 ment" to regular soldiers who are "anti-
 American"  and  who  "throw  down  their
 weapons."
 The Vietcong have been equally quick to
 turn the Government's propaganda to their
 own advantages.  Government troops re-
 cently found booklets in a number of vil-
 lages.  The cover was the same as that of a
 Government" booklet  explaining  the  pro-
 tected-hamlet program;  inside was a Viet-
 cong propaganda tract.
 Since the first week in February, when
 the Vietcong opened their drive in the Cen-
 tral Highlands, the guerrilla influence has
 trebled  in Darlac Provience  an  American
 adviser said.
 "They always take the initiative and we
 can only try to run around and put out the
 fires;" he said.
 "To be perfectly honest," he went on, "the
 Army of Soilth Vietnam just isn't interested
 in psychological warfare.  They think it's a
 waste of time even if we are willing to make
 most of the effort for them."
 Mr. MUNDT.  Mr. President, if we
 had instituted something like the Free-
 dom Academy when the concept was first
 approved by the Senate in 1960, we would
 have had a facility at which to familiar-
 ize Vietnamese officials with the art of
 nonmilitary warfare.  One can marvel
 at their hesitancy to utilize psychological
 techniques in their fight against Com-
 We may win battles in the name of peo-
 ples, but unless we win the peoples them-
 selves they will go their own way regardless
 of how the battles went.  Most South Viet-
 namese care little about ideological terms
 like communism and democracy.  They'll go
 with the government that offers them the
 best system for meeting their own needs.

 munist subversion, but one must also
 marvel at why our Government has been
 so hesitant to recognize that our failure
 to provide pertinent training in this field
 for foreign nationals who want it is
 opening a void In total defense against
 Communist and other totalitarian ag-
 gression.
 Sponsors of the Freedom Academy bill
 in  the Senate,  Senators  CASE,  DODD,
 DOUGLAS, FONG, HICKENLOOPER, LAUSCHE,
 MILLER,   PROUTY,   PROXMIRE,     SCOTT,
 SMATHERS, MURPHY, and myself, have, in
 introducing the bill, asked Congress to
 appraise U.S. global strategy in its en-
 tirety. We perceive critical fault 111 this
 country's appraisal of contesting world
 forces.  As a Government, we refuse to
 accredit sincerity to the long-range chal-
 lenge we face.
 As I have discussed this matter in
 recent   weeks - CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD
 pages    4059,  4751-4753, 5276-5281-a
 whole new academic discipline concen-
 trated around nonmilitary aggression has
 grown to maturity over the last genera-
 tion, and is functioning under Commu-
 nist direction; but the United States has
 not kept apace.  By section 2(a)(2) of
 the Freedom Academy bill, Congress
 would recognize this Inadequacy.  We
 state:
 The Communist bloc and the various Com-
 munist parties have systematically prepared
 themselves to wage a thousand-pronged ag-
 gression in the nonmilitary area.                   Drawing
 on their elaborate studies and extensive prag-
 matic tests. Communist leaders have devel-
 oped their conspiratorial version of nonmili-
 tary conflict into an advanced, operational
 art in which they employ and orchestrate
 an extraordinary variety of conflict Instru-
 ments In the political, psychological, Ideolog-
 ical, economic, technological, organizational
 and paramilitary areas enabling them to ap-
 proach their immediate and long-range ob-
 jectives along many paths.  This creates
 unique and unprecedented problems for the
 United States in a  conflict that is being
 waged in student organizations, peasant vil-
 lages, labor unions, mass communication sys-
 tems, in city and jungle, and Institutions and
 organizations of every description, as well as
 In  the world's  chancelleries.   Recognizing
 that nonmilitary conflict makes extraordi-
 nary  demands upon its practitioners,                        the
 Communists for several decades have inten-
 sively trained their leadership groups and
 cadres In an extensive network of basic, in-
 termediate,  and  advanced  schools.                                The
 Sino-Soviet conflict capacity has been im-
 measurably increased by the mobilization of
 research, science, industry, technology, and
 education. ? ? +
 Now one of the great American au-
 thorities on military affairs, Hanson W.
 Baldwin, military editor of the New York
 Times, has contributed his evalution of
 total U.S. strategy; and his evaluation
 is consistent with these findings In the
 Freedom Academy bill.  Writing in the
 November-December, 1964, Issue of Ord-
 nance, Mr. Baldwin says of our position:
 ? ' + the threat  [we facet  Is opportu-
 nistic, massive, and unrelenting, and It takes
 many forms-ideological, political, economic,
 psychological, and military. We must be
 prepared for a spectrum of conflict from
 such nuclear power confrontations as the
 Cuban missile crisis to a twilight war against
 Communist puppets.
 But by far the greatest threat--one that
 has so far frustrated us-Is the so-called
 "war of national liberation." the kind of
 guerrilla, terrorist, and insurgency conflict
 now being waged in South Vietnam.
 By establishing something like the
 Freedom Academy, Congress would move
 meaningfully toward squarely confront-
 ing this threat.  We propose intensive
 research into a new spectrum of warfare
 about which we know so little. We pro-
 pose to train our people and our allies'
 people in knowledge about the new spec-
 trum, to improve their effectiveness in
 resisting nonmilitary aggression where it
 occurs.  Our defense depends on these
 people.  They should be fully knowl-
 edgeable about tactics used against us.
 We do not propose to imitate Com-
 munist methods.  We do propose to un-
 derstand Communist methods, in order
 to be more effective against them.
 Hanson Baldwin concisely assesses our
 strategic situation.
 A great many of the new nations
 rarer almost certainly destined to disap-
 pear from the map of history.  Many ? * ?
 do not have the political, economic, or mili-
 tary power, or the population, skills, and
 resources to continue to exist ? ? ' as in-
 dependent countries.
 There is underway a contest to de-
 termine where allegiances in these na-
 tions                                                                  will  be  directed.   Communist
 powers remain dedicated to world rev-
 olution.
 Moscow's expansionist philosophy has not
 been  abandoned, though  the methods  of
 achieving it have changed.  And a new and
 far more aggressive Communist power-Red
 China-has complicated the global picture
 and worsened It.
 Thus the political world we live In Is still
 dominated by a major struggle between corn-
 munism  and  anticommunism.   But now
 there are several brands of communism and
 many kinds of anticommunism and non,com-
 munism.
 Where is the contest waged?
 ' ? ? In Africa, Latin America, and, most
 threatened, the Middle East and southeast
 Asia.  Hundreds of millions of uncommitted
 peoples-passive, Ignorant, poverty-stricken,
 with no sense of identification with either
 side, no real sense of national loyalties-are
 the weathervanes of tomorrow's history.
 The stakes are huge ? ? ?.
 He identifies our antagonists:
 Over and above all other considerations,
 we face a continuing struggle, with no end
 in sight-against an aggressive, expansion-
 lot  Communist  Russia  and  Communist
 China, and against plain "have-not" nations,
 Intent on acquiring what we have.
 Yet, among the millions of uncom-
 mitted whom Baldwin discusses are lead-
 ership groups friendly to us, They are
 friendly to us at least to the degree that
 they do not want their own governments
 undercut and taken over by Commu-
 nists.
 We have mutual interest with these
 people.  To the degree that the Com-
 munist stance would be strengthened by
 converting these people and their re-
 sources to the Communist cause, so the
 Communist potential for strength is
 weakened as we help these leadership
 groups maintain their own national in-
 dependence from Communist subversion.
 They do not understand the method of
 aggression against them.  We do not
 fully understand It.  It is in our inter-
 est. as well as In theirs, to familiarize
 them as well as we can with the chal-
 lenge they face, while at the same time
 acquiring full comprehension of the
 threat ourselves.
 The problem calls for dual effort: In-
 tensive research and extensive training.
 This is what we propose in S. 1232.
 What works against enactment of this
 bill?  Mr. Baldwin's discussion of do-
 mestic factors affecting our global strat-
 egy affords some insight:
 The quality of idealism in the American
 people, which  Is  reflected  in  our foreign
 policies ? ? ? ]is]  an essential and desir-
 able part of the American dream.  But it has
 found expression In such unrealistic terms
 as "to make the world safe for democracy";
 a "war to end-war"; "the Four Freedoms";
 "universal and complete disarmament."  And
 it can and often does mean a trend toward
 "do-goodism. "  toward  unrealistic, extreme
 aims or naive goals.
 Perhaps this quality explains the State
 Department contention that Freedom
 Academy sponsors propose to imitate
 Communist methods.  We emphatically
 do not.
 We propose to understand Communist
 methods, in order to prepare our people
 to counteract those methods more effec-
 tively.
 Mr. Baldwin poses, and then answers,
 several final questions:
 Where does all this lead ui?  What should
 our national strategy be?  What should be
 the principles that govern it ? ? ??
 The principles should be:
 1. Collective security-not isolation. +  ?  ?
 2. Flexibility-the  avoidance  of  frozen
 thoughts and ideas and structures.
 3. A national and Presidential will and
 determination to defend our vital interests.
 Power is of little value without the will to use
 It.
 Establishment of the Freedom Acad-
 emy would be consistent with, and re-
 sponsive to Mr. Baldwin's understanding.
 It would lead to better comprehension of
 the struggle we are in and to far supe-
 rior dissemination of this understanding
 among people who need it.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the full text of the Hanson W.
 Baldwin's article, entitled "U.S. Global
 Strategy," appearing in Ordnance for

 U.S. GLOBAL STRATEGY
 (Hanson W. Baldwin)
 National strategy is the utilization of all
 elements of a nation's power to achieve its
 objectives.  It must be couched in the ac-

 Implementation of a course of action-not
 merely the formulation of It.
 The equations produced In the process of
 strategy formulation do not lend themselves
 to computer solutions, or to percentage cal-
 culations.  For we are dealing, in the last
 analysis, with human beings.  Whether hu-
 man beings are rational or not is a matter
 of debate, but certainly it is true that the
 emotions which make human beings tick are
 intangibles.  How, for Instance, do you crank
 anger into a calculating machine?
 This is simply to suggest that we must be-
 ware of too great a dependence upon the

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE             April 1, 1965
 France today has joined the "nuclear club"
 in a small way; in time, Paris will achieve
 a significant capability,  Red China recently
 detonated her first atomic device. Now that
 she has, the political and psychological ef-
 fects will reverberate through the Orient.
 It  will be  a  long  time before  Peiping
 achieves a really important or significant nu-
 clear delivery capability, but when this oc-
 curs the world may be in real danger.
 Other nations soon may Join the atomic
 club.    With each new membership the world's
 power balance, particularly in the regions af-
 fected. shifts slightly.
 7.       A seventh factor is the growing chal-
 lenge of Soviet aerospace power and partic-
 ularly of Soviet maritime power.
 Soviet strategic thought has grown from
 the introverted "heartland" concept of war-
 fare to the extroverted global and extrater-
 restial "new look."
 In the past, danger had always come to
 Russia by land.  Hitler, and Napoleon before
 him,  almost-but  not  quite-conquered
 Russia.  The land marshals until relatively
 recently dominated Soviet strategic think-
 ing;                 the buffer states of  Eastern  Europe
 attested to Moscow's fear of land invasion,
 Today. Russia is looking upward to sky
 and space, and outward toward the seven
 seas. Her space achievements need no chron-
 icling; they will continue, and if we have
 any doubts about Soviet determinaton to put
 a "comrade" on the moon, we may awake one
 morning to another disagreeable surprise.
 Russia already has become a major air and
 space power-ahead of us in the utilization
 of man in space.
 Not so well know are her accomplishments
 at sea.  She is second In total naval power,
 first  in numbers  of submarines,  first  in
 numbers of small craft, such  as mine-
 sweepers, motor torpedo boats, and coastal
 defense  vessels.  (The  United States   has
 nothing like the missile-equipped Bomar
 torpedo boats.)
 Russia is first in deep-sea fishing fleets-
 both in numbers and quality.                       She already
 operates more ocean-going merchant ships
 than we do, and her total tonnage is expected
 to pass our declining merchant marine with-
 in the next two years.
 Moscow  plans  a  tremendous  merchant
 fleet-which can only be used for global
 trade purposes and for the export of sub-
 version as well as goods-which may approxi-
 mate 20,000,000 to 25,000,000 gross tons by
 1975-1980-the largest in the world.
 The United States and all the maritime
 nations of the non-Communist world face
 major competition on the seas and in world
 trade.
 So much for some-but by no means all-
 of the international factors that must be
 considered in the formulation of our objec-
 tives and our strategy.
 What are some of the domestic factors?
 First and perhaps of greatest long-term
 importance is the lack of national homo-
 geneity in the American Nation.  We are no
 longer "one, people" in the old sense of 50
 years ago.  There are now major religious,
 ethnic, and racial-as well as political-dif-
 ferences which cannot to easily healed (e.g.,
 civil rights and the school-prayer issue).
 The growth of big government and the
 trend toward centralization of power, with all
 the difficulties and delays that size, redund-
 ancy, and bureaucracy imply,  make  the
 formulation of policy-and sometimes its im-
 plementation-exceedingly slow.
 Command and control systems of uncanny
 global capabilities can conn a destroyer off
 Cuba or direct a battalion in Vietnam, but
 It has yet to be proved that this centralized
 Washington command post can win wars.
 Never in the history of human conflict
 have so many been able to say "No"-so few
 to say "Yes."
 The tremendous increase in the power of
 the Presidency and the decline in the power
 of Congress Is another factor to be con-
 sidered.  Congress is supposed to have the
 constitutional power to declare war and to
 raise and maintain armies and navies.  But
 In the age of the technological revolution
 and of $50 billion defense budgets, the effec-
 tive power has passed from the hands of Con-
 gress to the hands of the Executive,                                                                         The
 President can put us into war overnight by
 action, or inaction; Congress can only coun-
 tersign.
 The power of the Presidency-partly be-
 cause of modern communications-trans-
 cends today by an immense margin what our
 Founding Fathers Intended it to be.  And,
 correspondingly, the personality, and the
 character of the President, his strength of
 will, his purpose and judgment, are major-
 perhaps decisive-factors in strategy formu-
 lation and particularly in implementation.
 Leadership and personality are the x factor
 In history.
 The quality of idealism in the American
 people, which Is reflected in our foreign poli-
 cies.  Make no mistake, this is an essential
 and desirable part of the American dream.
 But it has found expression in such unrealis-
 tic terms as "to make the world safe for de-
 mocracy"; a "war to end war"; "the Four
 Freedoms"; "universal and complete disarm-
 ament."  And it can and often does mean a
 trend toward "do-goodism," toward unrealis-
 tic, extreme alms or naive goals.
 The need for explanation.  The American
 public's "right to know" is not only a con-
 stitutional safeguard to our system of gov-
 ernment and a monitor of government, but
 public information about and explanation of
 national objectives Is essential to the attain-
 ment of these objectives.
 This is particularly true in the kind of war
 we at+e most likely to have to fight-the type
 of counterinsurgency conflict we are now
 waging in Vietnam.
 Public support for any long-drawn-out war
 of attrition Is essential to success. A frank,
 comprehensive, and reasoned public-infor-
 mation policy on the part of all branches of
 government Is essential to enlistment of that
 support for the duration.  Otherwise public
 frustration or apathy or even opposition is
 bound to develop.
 Washington, which so successfully enlisted
 Madison Avenue In the domestic political
 hustlings, has made a botch of retaining pub-
 lic support for some of its national policies.
 The quality of our peoples is another fac-
 tor of importance to our consideration of
 strategy.  What has been called the "crisis
 of values" has influenced contemporary his-
 tory-and particularly Western civilization.
 The loss of old values, the lack of faith in
 ancient symbols and old loyalties, are re-
 flected In our rising crime rate, juvenile de-
 linquency, Inflated divorce statistics.  And
 the draft rejection rate of 40 to 50 percent
 reflects the physical as well as the mental
 softness of too many American youths.
 Slums, the problems of automation, un-
 employment, our decaying cities, our obso-
 lescent railroads, depressed areas, inadequate
 education-all of these factors will influence
 the capability of the peoples of the United
 States for democratic self-government and
 for the projection of national power.
 There are, of course, other domestic fac-
 tors. which need not even the briefest eluci-
 dation.  For instance: the capabilities of our
 economy  and  our  Industrial  base:   Its
 strengths and limitations; the capabilities of
 our Armed Forces; their strengths and limita-
 tions. Including the effects of current trends
 upon their morale and leadership and the
 downgrading of professional experience and
 judgment; the "civihanization" of the mili-
 tary profession; and, most important, our
 Interpretation of foreign and potential enemy
 strengths and capabilities-our global Intel-
 ligence system.
 So much for some of the factors that go
 Into the formulation of our objectives and
 our strategy.
 Here are some of our national objectives
 which will, of course, influence the-formula-
 tion of our strategy:
 1. Economic prosperity and political free-
 dom.  This implies a vigorously expanding
 gross national product and some accommoda-
 tion for the racial problem, for the problem
 of automation, and for depressed area.
 2. Maintain our global lead in industrial
 power, particularly in the capital-goods in-
 dustries.  Easier said than done; there are
 some serious lags now-machine tools, ship-
 building.
 3. Stress educational quality, rather than
 quantity-particularly at collegiate levels; ex-
 tend technical and trades training and physi-
 cal fitness to lower age levels.
 4. Foster educational, historical, religious,
 civic, and other appropriate programs for
 inculcation Into the body and mind politic
 of the lasting values that have, in the past,
 made us great.
 5. Extend the program of Peace Corps activ-
 ities and civic action-including construc-
 tion, training, and health programs by the
 Armed Forces.
 6. Maintain-and If possible extend-the
 overall U.S. lead in the technological revolu-
 tion, particularly In weapons applications.
 7. Lead the world in the exploration and
 exploitation of space and the ocean depths.
 8. Maintain and improve a global and space
 reconnaissance, surveillance, and intelligence
 system.
 9. Maintain qualitative and quantitative
 naval and air superiority, and qualitative
 superiority on land.
 10. Maintain U.S. entree to the Eurasian
 "rimlands"-the Islands and coastal regions
 of Europe and Asia.
 11. Delay, and If possible prevent, the in-
 dustrialization and modernization of Com-
 munist China.
 12. Exploit frictions and strains in the
 Communist world.
 13. Weaken and ultimately eliminate Com-
 munist government in Cuba.
 14. Revitalize and strengthen the Monroe
 Doctrine; i.e., prevent Communist coups and
 conquests In the Western Hemisphere.
 15. Strengthen the Western and anti-Com-
 munist position In southeast Asia.
 Fundamentally  the  Nation's  objectives
 might be summed up as follows:
 Globally-a more stable world (note I do
 not say a peaceful world).
 Domestically-a nation where government
 and machine serve humanity.
 It may be said that these objectives repre-
 sent merely the old formula of being against
 ain and for God and country.  This may be
 a fair criticism.  But a nation's objectives
 must. "like a man's reach exceed his grasp,
 or what's a heaven for?"
 Objectives, too, should be accorded pri-
 orities.  What is clearly vital to the Nation's
 survival and welfare must be so identified;
 what is attainable In the short-term view
 must be so labeled; and more distant objec-
 tives must be so itemized. Too often we tend
 to label as "vital," Interests which actually
 are remote.
 Certainly what happens in many parts of
 Africa Is not immediately vital to the United
 States and is not likely to become so unless
 there is a threat of Communist domination
 of the entire continent.
 It may even be argued that we assumed
 too casually the obligations of power when
 we interviewed in southeast Asia.  Is Laos
 vital to the United States?  Is South Viet-
 nam?  These are the $64 million questions
 which policymakers must answer when they
 enunciate national objectives.
 Where does all this lead us?  What should
 our national strategy be?    What should be
 the principles that govern It-the principles
 derived from the factors considered and the
 national objectives just summarized?
 The principles should be:

 SOVIET PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS
 Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey.  Mr.
 President, 20 years ago the most terrible
 war ever fought by mankind came to an
 end. With it there came the hope that
 religious persecution would forever be
 banished from the face of the earth.
 The shocking discovery of the scope of
 Jewish persecution under Hitler initiated
 vows by all men never to allow such
 events to happen again.
 These vows wee founded on something
 more than naive idealism, for while such
 action is against every conceivable code
 of moral order and decency, It is also a
 fact that such persecution will bring
 about the degeneration of a country by
 excluding from the national life a valu-
 able portion of the intellectual and man-
 power resources of the country.  It has
 become Increasingly evident, however.
 that the Soviet Union is in the process of
 throwing these beliefs and hopes against
 the rocks with all the force its totali-
 tarian strength can bring to bear.
 The Soviet Union has extreme methods
 to hide events in its country that it feels
 might not be considered in good taste
 The resolution Is clear in its intent.
 It states, in brief, that because we stead-
 fastly believe in the freedom of all peo-
 pies to practice their religion, without
 interference of any sort; because the evi-
 dence overwhelmingly points to pur-
 posely vicious persecution of Its Jewish
 population. and because the Soviet Con-
 stitution clearly defends religious free-
 dom; we, therefore, condemn the Soviet
 Union for its betrayal of the principles
 of li11man rights and decency, in the hope
 that the Soviet Union will restore the
 rights of the Jews to practice their re-
 ligion, free from harassment, and to
 maintain their culture as they have done
 throughout their history.
 At this time, I urge every Senator to
 support this resolution reaffirming our
 belief in human rights; I urge all Mem-
 bers of the House of Representatives to
 join their Senate colleagues in the sup-
 port of this resolution; and I urge all
 freedom-loving people the world over to
 join hands with the American people in
 asking freedom and dignity for the Jew-
 ish citizens of the Soviet Union.
 LOW UNEMPLOYMENT GOOD NEWS
 Mr. McGOVERN.  Mr. President, we
 are now entering the fifth year of contin-
 ued improvement in our economy.  This
 is the longest sustained economic expan-
 sion in the postwar period.  As the em-
 ployment statistics announced by the
 Labor Department today show, this fifth
 year promises to be one of the brightest.
 The unemployment figures for the
 breadwinners of the country have been
 cut almost in half since the first quarter
 of 1961.  At that point married men had
 an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent and
 today it has dropped to 2.6.  This is
 equal to the low level recorded during
 the 1955-57 expansion period.
 The economic growth since March a
 year ago-1,650,000-has meant jobs for
 800,000 more adult men, 700,000 more
 adult women, and 200,000 more teen-
 agers.
 This is truly good news.  It demon-
 strates that bold leadership given the
 tools to work with can keep the Nation
 on a prosperity-bound course.
 We are indeed "continuing" toward
 the Great Society President Johnson
 seeks.
 by those outside the Iron Curtain. Yet
 all of its suppression has not been suffi-
 cient to hide its dastardly acts toward its
 Jewish population.  For the past 20
 years, free people everywhere have hoped
 that persecution of religious peoples had
 ended for all time; yet, at this very in-
 stant, the persecution in Russia is look-
 ing distressingly similar to the persecu-
 ton that took place during the Third
 Reich.
 We see the singling out of the Russian
 Jews for allegations that have no basis
 whatsoever.  As under the tyrannical
 regime of Hitler, the Jews in the Soviet
 Union have been singled out as the cause
 of the country's economic failures.
 The propaganda that has been aimed
 at the Jewish population of the Soviet
 Union has been of the most vulgar na-
 ture, depicting the Jews in the same
 stereotype that was used by Goebbels.
 under Hitler, for the vilification of re-
 ligion grid all those who practice it.
 There has also been widespread exclu-
 sion of the Jews from the same educa-
 tional, cultural, and employment oppor-
 tunities that the other Soviet citizens
 have been offered.
 Mr. President, in view of these facts.
 I think the time has come for all good
 people to unite and, in a voice that will
 shatter the stone walls of the Kremlin,
 demand that these practices of persecu-
 tion, bigotry, and hate be put to an end.
 We have before us a concurrent reso-
 lution, submitted by the able Senator
 from Connecticut, that will inform the
 dictators of the Soviet people of our de-
 termination to put a stop to religious
 persecution in all Its forms, wherever it
 occurs on earth.  I have cosponsored
 Senate Concurrent Resolution 17 In the
 belief that the United States has an
 obligation, as the leader of free peoples.
 to step forward and condemn these
 malicious practices.
 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILD-
 ING: STAR-SPANGLED ARCHITEC-
 TURAL BLUNDER
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  Mr. President, Mem-
 bers of the Congress apparently are so
 well aware of the barbarian architec-
 tural qualities-if one can use the word
 "qualities" in this regard-of the third
 House office building that it Is hardly
 necessary to bring to their attention ad-
 ditional informed judgments.  Never-
 theless, I think the RECORD should in-
 clude a recent appraisal of the Rayburn
 Building by Miss Ada Louise Huxtable,
 as published in the New York Times of
 March 30, 1965.
 Miss Huxtable concludes her lament
 about this artless and unbelievably ex-
 pensive structure with a reference to a
 saying that "there's no point in crying
 over spilled marble."  But if we should
 not cry, we must at least be severely em-
 barrassed, and should resolve to hal,
 these economic and architectural atroci-
 ties on Capitol Hill.
 I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
 ticle be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the New York Times, Mar. 30, 19651
 THE   RAYBURN   BUU.DING:   HOUSE   OFFICE
 STRUCTURE Is DESCRIBED AS A DULL, VULGAR,
 CORRUPT BLUNDER
 (By Ada Louise Huxtable)
 it is moving time on Capitol Hill for 169
 Congressmen eligible for space in the new
 Rayburn House Office Building.  The struc-
 ture's three-room suites complete with re-
 frigerators and safes are being raffled off to
 applicants who may have a view of the Capi-
 tol dome or an interior court, depending on
 seniority.  Even seniority, however, does not
 give any legislator a door leading from his
 office, or his aid's office, to his working staff
 without passage through a waiting room full
 of constituents and special pleaders.   To
 correct this small planning error would add
 $200,000 to costs already estimated at any-
 where from $86 million to $122 million for
 the expensive and controversial building.
 Some Congressmen are moving In reluc-
 tantly.  Representative TAOMAS L. ASHLEY,
 Democrat, of Ohio, for one rejected his office
 on sight.  But he Is making the move any-
 way this week because his present quarters
 are too small.
 "This layout could paralyze us," he said
 during his inspection tour.  "It's an ugly
 building."
 Mr.  ASHLEY  is not  alone.   The profes-
 sional architectural press has been bitterly
 critical  as construction progressed.   (The
 building has taken 7 years and $22 million
 more to complete than originally estimate
 largely as the result of expensive miscalcr
 lations; change orders have reached 300 pe-
 cent over Government average; bid estimat
 on contracts have been as much as $45 In
 lion off.)
 There have been accusations of secret plat
 ning, pork barrel commissions and possib
 misuse of public funds.  The fact that tl
 general contractor was Matthew J. McCloske
 Democratic Party stalwart of Philadelphi
 has not escaped notice. But the storm swir
 uselessly around a behemoth that Is obv:
 ously here to stay.
 DEFECTS ARE NUMEROUS
 Architecturally, the Rayburn Building I
 a national disaster.  Its defects range fron
 profligate mishandling of 50 acres of space tc
 elephantine esthetic banality at record costs
 The costs are now being investigated by the
 General Accounting Office.
 Equal to the question of costs, however, is
 the question of what Congress and the capital
 have received for the investment.  It is quite
 possible that this is the worst building for
 the most money in the history of the con-
 struction art.  It stuns by sheer mass and
 boring bulk. Only 15 percent of its space
 is devoted to the offices and hearing rooms
 for which It was erected.
 Forty-two percent of the floor area is used
 for parking. Endless corridors have been
 likened to "Last Year at Marienbad." Stylis-
 tically, it is the apotheosis of humdrum.
 It is hard to label the building, but ii
 might be called Corrupt Classic.  Its empt:
 aridity and degraded classical details are
 vulgarization without drama, and to be both
 dull and vulgar may be an achievement of
 sorts.
 The structure's chief deslgp features are
 hollow exercises in sham grandeur.  A super-
 colossal exterior expanse of stolid, Mussolini-
 style pomp is embellished with sculpture
 that would be the apogee of art in the Soviet
 Union. where  overscaled muscles and ex-
