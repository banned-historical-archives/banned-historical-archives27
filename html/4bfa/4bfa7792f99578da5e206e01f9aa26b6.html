can life is an attempt to "be with them," or 
to be "integrated." This fear of total integra-
tion is an illusion. I've never yet met a black 
person who has been integrated into white 
society; he may think so, he may hope so, 
but it just ain't so. If any of us, at this point 
In time, believe such nonsense, we're suffer-
ing from a severe form of hallucination. 
The inner-city must also avoid swallowing 
the hook thrown to the American Indian: 
"You'll be able to thrive and prosper on your 
very own reservation, surrounded by us." If 
we don't learn anything from history, we 
must relive the past. The time is over for 
asking or even demanding human rights, in 
or out Of the theater. We no longer ask for 
manhood or womanhood or dignity; all we 
can do is express what we have to the degree 
that we have it. All whites aren't bad or good, 
the same goes for blacks?but this fact 
equalizes nothing. The whole racism mess is 
based upon the action of white supremacist 
deed an thought. 
The theater must reflect, to some degree, 
that we live in a land where no White man 
has ever been executed for the murder of a 
black man, woman, or child, not one. A cul-
ture can be no better than the people from 
whom it springs. There are teachers who have 
taught for many years in segregated, black 
neighborhood schools and do not live in that 
area, or send their children to school there. 
And they oppose that rejected, hemmed-in 
community's gaining the power to create 
something constructive that will rescue chil-
dren Wounded by a century of white-suprem-
acist "education." Their opposition is based 
upon the premise that self-determination will 
interfer with the seniority rights of adults 
who mainly live, work, play, and spend their 
Money elsewhere. There is more drama off-
stage than on, in American theater. 
Kennedy, King, Kennedy . . . murdered, 
buried with ceremony, followed by discreet, 
uncomfortable silence; the message reaches 
us and we adjust our lives quietly or noisily. 
There is almost as ninth injustice in the 
theater as there is in the rest of the land, 
but there's no need of begging. Cope! Cope 
anyhow, anywhere you can, to the best of 
your ability. When opposed, we must bear in 
mind that a slave is a human being who lost 
a battle some place and has to find his way 
out of the bind. Also remember that whites 
who are proven brothers, like John Brown, 
are called "nigger-lovers" or madmen. In the 
past 40 years only 18 plays by black writers 
have been presented on Broadway. Soon we 
may have to read our works on the sidewalks 
of inner-city and "mainstream" Broadway. 
Time is up. I've a play to write that may 
never be seen by any audience anywhere, but 
I do my thing. Who has ears to hear, 
hear . . . all others, later. 
A CHILDISH ATTACK ON THE 
ROTC 
HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI 
Or ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
- Friday, February 7, 1969 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
need not observe that the Chicago Trib-
une has a very spirited and solid editor-
ial philosophy. I thought that the edi-
torial commentary in its issue of Tues-
day, February 4, concerning the ROTC 
activities at Yale and Dartmouth, was 
very much to the point. The editorial 
follows: 
A CHILDISH ATTACK ON TILE ROTC 
Other professions may or may not be older, 
but the soldier's profession must inevitably 
rank at the top of any list if you consider 
honor as well as antiquity. It is little short 
of inconceivable, therefore, that the faculties 
of two prominent eastern colleges?Yale and 
Dartmouth?have taken steps to strip mili-
tary training of its academic standing and to 
relegate the Reserve Officers Training corps 
to the status of an extracurricular activity. 
The chairman of -the Yale faculty com-
mittee on the curriculum went so far as to 
say that "R.0,T.C. is like singing in the 
Wiffenpoofs?,a perfectly fine activity but one 
that we don't think merits any academic 
standing."/ . 
This is/an utterly asinine statement and 
reflects /the childish attitude of those who 
think yhey can put an end to war by going 
about/ picketing recruiting offices and 
chanling the name of Ho Chi Minh?who, 
alont with Mao Tse-tung is one of the cham-
exponents of military aggression in the 
ld today. This attitude is wholly un-
thy of any professor, let alone the chair-
of a faculty committee. 
re we to conclude that in the arrogant 
nion of these gentlemen our educational 
itutions are above such menial and inci-
al activities as securing the freedom 
ndependence of the United States, or 
ving its unity, or defeating the Nazis, or 
unseat g dictators like Napoleon, or, more 
current , defending freedom against the 
manifest esigns of the Communists? 
How mu good would all the liberal arts 
degrees in e world do if there were not 
the freedom i which to profess and practice 
these arts? Ho would Yale and Dartmouth, 
with their great reputations for academic 
freedom, fare in a orld which was allowed, 
by default, to fall der the sway of com-
munism?like Cuba?where there is no 
truth but the party truth' 
We are as eager as anybody to see an 
end to war; but a glance alV the world 
today should make it quite tar that war 
is still here and that our security still de-
pends largely on a well trained military force. 
College R. 0. T. C. programs havkbeen of 
Inestimable value in training reservekto sup-
plement the men trained at the nAlitary, 
naval, and air force academies. \ 
, 
By voting to withdraw academic credit ?kom 
R. 0. T. C. courses and to deprive the afters 
in charge of those courses of their standipg 
\ 
as professors, the faculties are yielding o 
the transient demands of a vociferous m - 
nority which is almost sure to forget a 
about R. 0. T .C. as soon as the Viet Nam wa 
is over. The messages on the placards being 
waved by campus demonstrators are not 
likely to qualify as eternal verities.

REFORMING THE WELFARE 
SYSTEM 
HON. RICHARD D. McCARTHY 
OF IqpNT YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 1969 
Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have 
today cosponsored a bill with the gentle-
men from New York (Mr. CAREY and Mr. 
HALPERN) , and a number of my col-
leagues to begin the urgently needed re-
form of the Federal welfare system now 
in use. Our welfare system, as it is now 
designed, is not working. It satisfies 
neither those who bear the costs, those 
who attempt to administer it, or those 
who are dependent on it for support. This 
bill is designed to establish national 
minimum- standards of welfare for all 
States in the Union. It is a first step in 
the constructive overhaul that is re-
quired. 
By setting national minimum stand-
ards for welfare payments, we will cor-
rect a fundamental deficiency in the 
system as it now stands. Today, there are 
wide ranges in welfare payments from 
State to State. The average payment of 
aid to dependent children in New York 
State is $61.70 per month; in Mississippi 
it is $8.40. This variation in payments 
has caused the poor in one State to move 
to other areas where payments are high-
er; an understandable desire when we 
consider the gross inadequacy of a pay-
ment of $8.40 per month for a child. 
But, this movement has placed a strain 
on those States that provide welfare pay-
ments in keeping with their social re-
sponsibilities. The welfare roles of New 
York State, Pennsylvania, California, 
and others have been swollen by the 
movement of the poor from the South 
and from rural areas. In New York City 
this year, the welfare bill is going to in-
crease by $400 million, to a total of $1.7 
billion. And it is estimated that there will 
be close to 1 million welfare recipients 
out of the city's 8 million citizens. This 
growth is far larger than that which 
would occur with normal population 
growth. Part of this migration reflects a 
genuine desire to improve one's oppor-
tunities, to take advantage of better job 
opportunities in a new location. But 
there are also cases where welfare re-
cipients are searching for higher levels 
of welfare payments. This incentive 
should be removed. 
Although the migration of the poor to 
our urban centers is in the tradition of 
the search for new frontiers, a home-
stead, a new opportunity, the conditions 
of modern industrial society do not favor 
this migration. The underskilled and 
undereducated migrant from a rural area 
finds that he does not have the talents 
demanded in the urban job market. He 
is forced to work in the marginal areas 
of the employment market where wages 
are low?too low to keep him and his 
family alive in a high cost of living area?
and where unemployment first makes 
itself felt. It is no surprise, then, that 
this migrant winds up on the welfare 
roles. 
The bill that I have cosponsored re-
vises the welfare system to halt this 
migration. By providing a national mini-
mum standard of welfare, welfare pay-
ments will be removed- as an artificial 
inducement to move. This revision has 
been recommended by the Advisory 
Council on Public Welfare, President 
Nixon's task force on public assistance, 
and has been endorsed in principle by 
Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare Finch. 
Going beyond the corrections contained 
in this legislation however, minor revi-
sions of our welfare system will not be 
enough. The concept of welfare as we 
now know it is not acceptable. It is not 
acceptable because it has created within 
our society a group of citizens who grow 
up totally dependent on welfare pay-
ments for existence. The young girl 
whose mother is on welfare grows up 
knowing no other pattern of life other 
than having children and collecting wel-
fare checks. The system is designed to 
break up homes. The young boy grows up 
without a man in the house; he has no

father who goes to work each day, who 
can establish a pattern of living which 
the young boy can emulate. 
The system is also unaccepthle be-
cause it places burdens on other wage 
earners that are not necessary. If a sys-
tem can be devised that allows the father 
or mother to earn as much as they can 
and still receive public funds that will 
allqw them to maintain a minimum 
standard of living, welfare costs may be 
reduced and the cycle of welfare de-
pendency that the present system creates 
may be broken by reestablishing the 
family unit. 
I am exploring the concepts of nega-
tive income tax, family payments, exten-
sion of the minimum wage laws to end 
the situation where an employee works a 
full week but still doesn't earn enough to 
support his family. We will need to con-
tinue payments to the sick, the aged, 
the orphaned and others obviously in 
need. But we must find a better way to 
prevent the growth of what Gunnar 
Myrdal has called an "underclass," an 
undereducated, underemployed group of 
citizens dependent on welfare for their 
existence. Our society can do better, it 
must. 
NATIONAL BOY SCOUT WEEK 
HON. CLARENCE J. BROWN, JR. 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 1969 
Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the 
week of February 7-13, 1969, is of special 
significance to the millions of American 
boys and adults who are affiliated with 
the Boy Scouts of America. It is Boy 
Scout Week, the annual commemoration 
of the founding of the movement in our 
country, and the 53d anniversary of the 
chartering of the Boy Scouts of America 
by Congress. 
In every one of the 50 States, young 
men from 8 to 18 are celebrating Boy 
Scout Week with displays and special 
events in their communities, directing 
attention to the training and skills de-
veloped through one of the free world's 
greatest youth movements. Under the 
guidance of their able leaders, these 
young men are showing and telling the 
American people about the contributions 
Scouting is making to the future of our 
country. 
During observances of the 50th an-
niversary of the chartering of the Boy 
Scouts by Congress, I had the pleasure of 
Preparing a survey of the 89th Congress 
to determine the influence of Scouting 
on its Members. I was asked by the Boy 
Scouts of America to update the survey 
for the 90th Congress and again for the 
91st. I am, pleased to report the results 
of the most recent survey which reveal 
that 335, Or over 60 percent, of the Mem-
bers of Congress have participated in 
the Scouting program either as Scouts or 
as adult volunteer leaders. And although 
the 11 women Members of Congress have 
not been counted in the statistics as 
eligible to participate in Scouting, one 
has served as a Cub Scout den mother 
The Eagle Award, which is the highest 
rank that can be attained by a Scout, was 
earned by 28 of the 280 Members who 
were Scouts: Of the 148 who served in an 
adult volunteer capacity, eight have been 
.presented the Silver Beaver Award, given 
for outstanding volunteer service at the 
local council level. One Member has 
earned the coveted Silver Buffalo Award 
for contributions at the national level, 
and two others have been awarded the 
Silver Antelope for outstanding service 
to one of the 12 Scout regions. 
Mr. Speaker, that such a large propor-
tion of the Members of Congress have 
come under the influence of the Scouting 
program, subscribing to an oath pledging 
"Duty to God and Country" speaks well 
not only of Scouting and this Congress. 
but of the foresight displayed by our 
predecessors 53 years ago when they 
granted a charter to the Boy Scouts of 
America. 
Under unanimous consent I make the 
results of my survey part of the Racoaa 
in observance of National Boy Scout 
Week, February 7 through 13, 1969. 
TAX REFORM 
HON. WILLIAM D. FORD 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 1969 
Mr. Wu:1'1AM D. FORD. Mr. Speaker, 
I have this week cosponsored legislation 
to double personal income tax exemp-
tions from the present $600 to $1,200 per 
dependent. 
This is a long-overdue change which 
would directly aid the great mass of our 
Nation's taxpayers?the low- and mid-
dle-income worker and the younger peo-
ple who are struggling to raise families 
in the face of a constantly increasing 
cost of living. 
The $600 exemption has been un-
changed for 21 years. During that period, 
the cost of every basic item has risen 
sharply. Food has nearly doubled, rent 
and clothing have more than doubled, 
medical costs have gone up over 90 
percent. 
It is unrealistic to maintain that today 
$600 will even come close to the cost of 
raising a child or caring for an aging 
or dependent parent. 
This legislation represents a second 
step in the desperately needed overhaul 
of our income tax laws. Last week, I co-
sponsored a bill calling for a 13-point 
tax reform program, aimed primarily at 
closing the loopholes which enable large 
corporations and wealthy persons to 
avoid paying a fair share of the tax 
burden. 
I was pleased to note in the press this 
week that the Nixon administration ap-
parently supports the bulk of these over-
due tax reforms. Perhaps enough of my 
Republican colleagues will join with 
Democrats who have long sought this 
goal, and we will finally be able to 
achieve meaningful tax revisions. 
A most excellent third step in this di-
rection would be the adoption of legis-
ary " 
and another has been named an "Honor- lation to establish a minimum tax for committed to the c to/ ough ra-

posal was made in the 89th Congress by 
the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy, but 
it was pigeonholed in committee. I sup-
ported the idea thin, and I think today 
It is only fair to .et such a minimum 
tax. I was pleased to see that in his 
press conference of this week President 
Nixon has endorsed the principle of a 
minimum tax for an taxpayers. This type 
of tax wourd move toward correction of 
the unbelievable situation of 155 Amer-
icans with adjusted gross incomes of 
over $200,000 paying no income tax at 
all in 1967. Too many wealthy people 
and pig corporation; today either pay no 
tax at all, or pay a ridiculously low 
amount, because of loopholes and gim-
micks in the Intern al Revenue Code. 
As I told the House last week, the 
demand for tax reform has grown so 
loud that the Coneues dare ignore it 
no longer. 
DEPARTMENT OF PEACE 
HON. JOSEPH E. ICARTH 
OF 11/N oTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 1969 
Mr. KARTH. Mr. Speaker, while peace 
is a major concern of every thoughtful 
American, our countey, lacking direction, 
has often failed to convert its peacekeep-
ing desires into a peacekeeping reality. 
I, therefore, rise today in support of 
legislation to redirect this Nation's ener-
gies toward a lasting peace. Yesterday, 
together with many of my colleagues, I 
introduced legislation for the establish-
ment of a Department of Peace and 
World Order. While no panacea, this new 
Government function, if adopted, will be 
given a mandate to discover nonviolent 
means of resolving the inevitable inter-
national conflicts that arise between 
other nations and our own. 
Mr. Speaker, the search for peace 
within our time has been hampered by 
some who hold that war is an inevitable 
product of "human nature". I say this 
view is false. 
As every student oi history knows, at 
various times during the past '7,000 years 
of human experience, large and complex 
populations inhabiting vast areas of set-
tlement have lived in peace through 
many generations. 
The world today, however, is at latest 
count divided into at :east 140 sovereign 
states, each vying for existence. The 
idea of politically merging each of these 
separate powers into a single, peaceful 
world government is just not realistically 
possible. Compoundin the difficulty is 
the grim threat of nuclear or bacteriolog-
ical extinction. 
The simple truth is, civilized man must 
place an urgent new priority upon peace. 
In the free world, and within the United 
States especially, a new balance must be 
struck between our spectacular techno-
logical advances versus the relatively 
primitive state of the social and political 
sciences. 
Sanity and survival demand that we 
divert toward peace at least a portion of 
the organized, masanie resources now

tional, nonviolent means rather than 
through ever more sophisticated instru-
ments of death. 
It is in this spirit, Mr. Speaker, that I 
join my colleagues in the House in our 
plea for support of this new legislation 
to create a Department of Peace. 
For the record, let me point to the long 
precedent for action such as we are pro-
posing. Between the 04th. and 90th Con-
gresses, 1955-68, no less than 85 bills 
were introduced into the House or Sen-
ate to create a Department of Peace. In 
fact, from Revolutionary times forward, 
various American groups have advanced 
a similar idea that a Secretary of Peace, 
at Cabinet level, be created to balance 
the Secretary of Defense?formerly the 
Secretary of War. 
Despite this long tradition, never have 
any of these measures been moved from 
committee or voted upon within the Con-
gresg of the United States. Moreover, if 
repoits are correct concerning President 
Nixon's reaction to this legislation, a 
vote upon this proposal will be difficult 
to obtain. 
With all due respect to the wisdom of 
the executive branch, Mr. Speaker, I 
must maintain that neither the Depart-
ment of Defense nor the Department of 
State are charged with the responsibility 
of using vast resources for researching 
ways to achieve the peace. 
John Foster Dulles, in 1957, indicated 
that in his view the function of the De-
partment of State, is neither to foster 
peace nor prevent war, but to promote 
the "national interest." Certainly we can-
not maintain that all of the planes, 
tanks, bombs, and assorted other vehicles 
of the Department of Defense have 
brought us any closer to the illusive peace 
we seek, for it is that agency's respon-
sibility to defend our country at all costs. 
However, to saddle them with an equally 
Important responsibility would be to 
dilute both. 
And so, in summary, I urge my col-
leagues to work toward the success of 
this measure. Peacemaking should be our 
country's full-time concern. Achievement 
of this goal would be among the most 
important enactments of the 91st Con-
gress. 
SE /C AND SUBVE4SION 
HON. JOHN R. RARICK 
LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 1969 
Mr. RARICK. Mr. Speaker, little chil-
dren are denied prayer in school, and in 
many, instances forbidden to salute our 
flag or repeat the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Yet, parents are being persuaded to ac-
cept as a matter of academic truth that 
their children can be protected from 
future psychological disorder by a full 
exposure in their early years to the mys-
teries of sex. 
Furthermore we find creeping into 
their textboaS iridOctrination in violence. 
Any rational individual examining the 
deterioration of the classroom textbooks 
can but conclude that the promoters of 
such programs are either dangerously 
sick or are undertaking subversive efforts 
to destroy the moral fiber of America's 
future by warping the minds of our 
youth.. 
In practice, sensitivity training?or 
self-criticism?has been used by Com-
munist leadership to reduce the dignity 
of man in their enslaved countries to sub-
human status for pacification and easy 
control of the masses. Many examples of 
collective manipulation to maintain 
power thusly are presently in operation. 
As recently as Wednesday, January 22, 
1969, the Washington Post carried a re-
port from Hong Kong describing the re-
indoctrination of Teng Hsiao -ping to re-
place dictator Mao Tse-tung. The 
article described reports from Peking 
that Teng has been attending Red con-
fessional meetings to absolve himself of 
his supposed sins. The report continued: 
SEEN AT CONFESSIONAL 
Though his return to prominence has not 
been officially announced, reliable reports 
reaching here from Peking say that Teng has 
lately been attending confessional meetings 
in the Chinese capital in order to absolve 
himself of his supposed sins. 
This practice of "self-criticism" is stand-
ard Chinese Communist procedure designed 
to, permit alleged deviationists to correct 
their errors. 
The mothers and fathers of American 
youth are already incensed at the in-
decencies and violence purveyed to their 
children through the television, movies, 
and even the radio. But the mental 
manipulators through their ratings and 
polls have been made aware that mother 
and dad are turning off television and 
staying away from the movies to shield 
their children. 
So it became necessary to reach the 
minds of the children that they launch 
a new attack?via the classroom and the 
textbook. 
Today we find the classrooms of Amer-
ica have been turned into a battleground 
to subvert the minds of our youth. 
Mr. Speaker, I insert a paper by Gary 
Allen entitled, "Sex Study" from the 
March, 1969, American Opinion, and re-
leases from the National Enquirer for 
January 26, and the Washington Post for 
January 22, 1969, following my remarks: 
From American Opinion, March 1969] 
SEX STUDY: PROBLEMS, PROPAGANDA, AND 
PQRNOGRAPHr 
(Norm?Gary Allen, a graduate of Stanford 
University and one of the nation's top au-
thorities on, civil turmoil and the New Left, 
is author of Communist Revolution In The 
Streets?a highly praised and definitive vol-
ume on revolutionary tactics and strategies, 
published by Western Islands. Mr. Allen, a 
former instructor of both history and Eng-
lish, is active in anti-Communist and other 
humanitarian causes. Now a film writer, au-
thor, and journalist, he is a Contributing 
Editor to American Opinion. Mr. Allen is also 
nationally celebrated as a lecturer.) 
Sex education in the schools is not new. 
Most high schools have for year's conducted 
courses which teach the biological facts of 
life. What is new is that these are now 
sneered at by sex educationists as "plumbing 
courses," inadequate for "modern social 
needs." What is needed, we are told, it a jet-
age "sex education" which really gets down 
to the nitty gritty. 
And that is just what we are getting. 
As the Saturday Evening Post related be-
fore its recent demise, the "sex-education" 
E 965 
programs which are now "mushrooming all 
over the country are newer than the new 
math. . . . America seems to have suddenly 
discovered an Urgent need for universal sex 
education?from kindergarten through high 
tchool, some enthusiasts insist?and is gal-
loping off in all directions at once to meet 
it." The Post trumpeted that fifty percent of 
public and parochial schools are now provid-
ing the glories of academic sexuality, and 
that at the present rate the figure will pass 
seventy percent within a year. 
Nothing happens in a vacuum, and the 
educationists' sex explosion would not be 
taking place unless a great deal of influence, 
organization, and money were being poured 
into its promotion from somewhere, It it. 
The organization behind the new "sex edu-
cation" now sweeping the nation is 
S.I.E.C.U.S., Sex Information and Education 
Council of the United States. (Pronounced, 
seek us.) As the Post noted, "Among the 
organizations shaping the structure of Amer-
ican sex education, by far the most influen-
tial is S.I.E.C.U.S." McCall's puts it this way: 
"Today's atmosphere in sex education can-
not be described without mention of a high-
voltage, nonprofit organization called 
S.I.E.C.U.S., which is without doubt the 
single most important force in sparking sex 
education in our schools. . . ." The Wall 
Street Journal records that "S.I.E.C.U.S. re-
ports fifty to seventy inquiries a week from 
schools, churches, and other organizations 
seeking guidance on tax education." 
A leaflet distributed by the National Edu-
cation Association describes S.I.E.C.U.S. as a 
voluntary health agency founded in New 
York City, in 1964, to provide "assistance to 
communities and schools wishing to embark 
on sex education programs. S.I.E.C.U.S. will 
act as a clearinghouse for research and edu-
cation in tex, as a source of information 
about sex education in the schools, and as a 
public forum where consideration of various 
aspects of man's sexuality can be carried out 
in dignified and objective fashion." 
The tax-free S.I.E.C.U.S. organization op-
erates largely from foundation grants?which 
means that American taxpayers are ultimate-
ly footing the bill. Those who write to the 
Department of Health, Education and Wel-
fare concerning "sex education" are now ad-
vised to contact S.I.E.C.U.S. The Department 
of H.E.W. is also putting your money where 
its commitment is, and in 1967 granted $1.5 
million to support the new "sex education" 
programs in thirteen school districts. In addi-
tion, officers of the U.S. Office of Education 
have served, or are serving, on the Board of 
Directors of S.I.E.C.U.S. 
Chief torchbearer for S.I.E.C.U.S. is Dr. 
Mary Calderone, the organization's Executive 
Director?referred by McCall's as the Com-
mander-in-Chief of "sex education" forces. 
Since the Commander-in-Chief's attitudes 
must of necessity be reflected in the choice of 
materials for the S.I.E.C.U.S. program we are 
all required to subsidize, her views have 
undergone close scrutiny by concerned par-
ents. Dr. Calderone has, for example, often 
made clear her commitment to the "New 
Morality"?as old as Sodom and Gomorrah. 
In speaking to 320 boys at Blair Academy in 
New Jersey, S.I.E.C.U.S. Director Calderone 
commented: "What is sex for? It's for 
fun . . . for wonderful sensation. . . . Sex 
is not something you turn off like a faucet. 
If you do, it's unhealthy." And, she con-
tinued: "We need new values to establish 
when and how we should have sexual experi-
ences." 
What sort of "new values"? 
According to Look magazine, when a stu-
dent asked: "What is your opinion of pre-
marital sex relations among teenagers?" Mrs. 
Calderone snapped back: "What's yours? No-
body from on high [God] determines this. 
You determine it. . . . I don't believe . . . 
the old 'Thou Shalt Nota' apply anymore." 
She certainly doesn't.

E 966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? Extensions of Remarks February 7, 1969 
In Seventeen magazine, the S.I.E.C.U.S. 
Executive Director claimed "sex is not the 
prerogative of Christianity," and the Satur-
day Evening Post quotes her as declaring that 
sexual "do's and don'ts" cannot be imposed 
on the young. After telling her youthful audi-
ences that "there doesn't f:eem to be any 
correlation between premarital sex and suc-
cess in marriage," she regularly leaves the 
decision of premarital interoourse up to the 
glands of her young listeners. The Boston 
Globe of December 5, 1968, quotes her as 
telling a blushing audience of five hundred 
high school boys and girls: 
"The question goes -far beyond Will I go 
to bed?' and it's one you must answer for 
yourselves. You boys may know a girl is 
physically ready, but you have to ask your-
selves: 'Am I ready to take the responsibility 
to say, yes, she is ready emotionally and 
psychologically?'" 
Though described by Post as a Joan of 
Arc for "sex education," Dr. Calderone is 
more often referred to as "a sweet-faced, 
silvery-haired grandmother" who shocks 
audiences by using four-letter words to 
make her point. Her motto is "tell them 
everything and tell them early." Acoording to 
the Saturday Evening Post. 
"Contrary to the views of most child 
psychoanalysts, Dr. Calderone holds that sex 
education should start in the nursery. 
Around the age of three the child should 
assimilate such knowledge, along with the 
correct terminology such as The penis of the 
father is made to carry the sperm into the 
mother through the vagina.' Kindergarten 
teachers should then impar t additional clini-
cal details." 
Tha,t's right, kindergarten teachers! 
As you might expect, the S.I.E.C.U.S. Ex-
ecutive Director also has very progressive 
ideas concerning homesexuality. As she is 
fond of telling youngsters: "Almost every-
body has some atraction to people of the 
same sex, . . I cannot condemn it." Every 
boy in an urban environment, she says, "is 
going to have a homesexual advance made 
to him, and therefore he should understand 
what it is and what his attitude about it 
and about himself should be." 
And what should that attitude be? Con-
cerning homesexuals, the S.I.E.C.U.S. Com-
mander-in-Chief smirks to boys in her lec-
tures: ". . you owe that person your respon-
sibility and understanding, even if you don't 
share his conviction." Dr. Calderone adds, 
sadly, that "it will be some time before homo-
sexuality receives general acceptance." Un-
less, of Course, her "educational" efforts on 
behalf of S.I.E.C.U'.S. are successful. 
If Dr. Mary Calderone is the Joan of Arc 
of the school-sex revolution, Dr. Lester Kir-
kendall, Professor of Family Life at Oregon 
State University, and a member of the 
S.I.E.C.U.S. Board of Directors, is its Pied 
Piper. Dr. Kirkendall, a prolific author of sex 
books and magazine articles about every 
conceivable sexual foible, will never be ac-
cused of being an old fuddy-duddy by even 
the hippiest of the pornopoliticians. Still, 
Kirkendall is referred to by Reader's Digest 
as "without question, one of the most re-
spected authorities in the whole field of sex 
education and family life." He has a accord-
ing to the Digest, "helped to create today's 
new generation of sex educators." 
Lester Kirkendall says he believes that "if 
present trends continue, premarital inter-
course will almost certainly increase." But, 
the Professor adds, he doesn't feel this is 
necessarily bad. He writes in Sex And Our 
Society that if couples "do experiment with 
sex only to have their relationship flounder, 
their honest efforts to understand and be 
responsible to one another may well have 
been more gain than loss." 
Like Mrs. Calderone, S.I.E.C.U.S. director 
Kirkendall is not "hungup" with the reli-
gious and moral foundations of sex. lie is, 
in fact, a past director of the anti-religious 
Approved For Release 2000/09/14: CIA-RDP711300364R000500190002-1 
American Humanist Association, and has 
written in its magazine that morality cannot 
be found in the context of "supernaturalism 
or a supernatural deity." Instead, he defines 
his religion as a "respect for and a belief in 
people, and a concern for true brotherhood 
among, men." Just as Kirkendall rejects God 
for "people," he also rejects patriotism, actu-
ally going so far as to brand defense of one's 
country as immoral. In "Searching for the 
Roots of Moral Decisions," he writes: 
A tremendous feeling of national unity, a 
sense of closeness, good will, and harmour 
may result from fearing another natipI or 
from the effort of trying to destroy not her
nation, Such unity . . . is imm/l. 
Another founder of S.I.E.C.0 .?and its 
longtime Treasurer?is Isadore ubin. He too 
shares Dr. Kirkendall's rejeciiit 
on of patriot-
ism. Rubin was on May 3, 155 identified in 
sworn testimony before thr House n Commit-
tee( o Un-American Acti 'ties as a member 
of the Communist Par by Mrs. Mildred 
Blauvelt, an undercover perative within the 
Conununist Party for t e New York Police 
Department. Rubin wa.s subsequently Editor 
of the New York Teache News, published by 
the New York Teacher Union?which was 
expelled from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. when it was 
found to be controlled J the Communists. 
So total was his commi ent to the Reds 
that he even had to be smissed from his 
job as a teacher in New ? City because 
of his refusal to deny his m bership in the 
Communist Party. 
In addition to his subvejjve work for 
S.I.E.C.U.S., Comrade Rubin ikw edits the 
notorious- - Sexology magazin Although 
S.I.E.C.TJ,S. proclaims that one of tks purposes 
Is to counter exploitation of se its own 
officers are involved in the wlldesk sort of 
sex exploitation. Rubin's pulpy xology 
magazine dwells on sex sensationalis , with 
lurid pictures of men and women i the 
most intimate positions, presenting rass 
articles dealing with the worst sort of e - 
version. Examples of features in recent '-
sues include: "Can Humans Breed With A 
mals?," and "Witchcraft And Sex-1968:',' 
and 'The First Sadists," and "Wife Swapping 
In Naples," and "My Double Sex Life (the \ 
story of a bisexual)," and "Gangs That Hunt i 
Down Queers," and "Why I Like Homosexual t, 
Men," and "Unusual Sex Demands," ad ' 
nauseam. In addition, Sexology also features 
film reviews of the latest "adult movies," 
carries advertisements for rank sex books. 
and has published its own titillating work 
on Transvestism. 
Mr. Rubin's Sexology periodical has for 
years been available at certain seedy stores 
around the country (often from behind the 
counter, with the pages stapled together), 
but bigger and better things are in store for 
the magazine. Speaking in December of 1968 
to a group of educators at an institute on 
"sex education" sponsored by the Interna-
tional Business Machines Corporation, S.I.E. 
C.U.S.'s Lester Kirkendall revealed that 
Sexology is currently being revised with 
different cover and titles so it can be used 1 
the schools? 
Now, get this: Dr. Lester Kirkendall, erves 
with Communist Isadore Rubin as ay/ Editor 
of Sexology magazine, Also on the staff of 
this pornographic sheet are S.I.E.C.U.S. di-
rectors William Genn8, John Money, and 
Wardell Pomery. 
Another of those laboring with Communist 
Isadore Rubin and his fellow pornographera 
on the Board of Directors of S.I.E.C.U.S. 
Mrs. Elizabeth Koontz, the newly elected 
President of the million-member National 
Education Association. The radially Leftist 
Mrs. Koontz urges teachers to ". . . organize, 
agitate, and strike." In parphrasing the 
CommuniSt Black Panther to call for 
"Teacher Power," she explains: "We cannot 
teach democracy and ignore what is 
wrong. . ." It is thus nct surprising that 
sN.E.A. has been in the forefront of promoting 
S.I.E.C.ST.S. throughout thc nation, and that 
Mary Calderone has been a contributor to 
the N.E.A. Journal. 
Earlier we mentioned Sexology staffer Wil-
liam Genne?a director, founder, and officer 
of S.I.E.C.U.S. who calls himself "Reverend" 
and is Director of the Commission on Mar-
riage and Family Life of the National Coun-
cil of Churches. The "Reverend" Genne, who 
offers the view that those who think 
"Wherever healing takes place, Christ is 
present, no matter what the Church sa,ys 
about fornication," has quite a background 
himself. In addition to his consultation in 
pornography at Sexology. the files of the 
House Committee on Un-American Activi-
ties record that Gentle has affiliated himself 
with such Communist Fronts as the Stock-
holm Peace Petition, the World Peace Ap-
peal, the National Committee to Repeal the 
McCarran Act, the Comniittee for Peaceful 
Alternatives to the Atlantic Pact, etc, 
Then there is S.I.E.C.U.S. director William 
Masters, who published with Virginia E. 
Johnson the best-selling Human Sexual Re-
sponse. That incredible volume records Dr. 
Masters' studies in intercourse and auto-
manipulation of 694 persona. Masters had 
no qualms about employing unmarried sub-
jects to perform before the cameras for this 
subsequently popularize udy of inter-
course, and used an artificial plastic phallus 
which recorded female responses. The 
S.I.E.C.U.S. director was (incited in Playboy 
(May, 1968) describing the tortuous device 
as follows: 
"The equipment can be adjusted for phys-
ical variations in size, weight and vaginal 
development. The rate and depth of penile 
thrust is initiated and controlled completely 
by the responding individaal." 
The immediate past-President of 
is sociologist David Mace, who stated 
his case for the "New Morality" in the April, 
1968, issue of Sexology at. follows: 
"The simple fact is that through most of 
our history in Western Christendom we have 
biased our standards of sexual behavior on 
premises that are now totally insupport-
able?on the folklore of the ancient Hebrews 
d on the musings of medieval monks, 
ncepts that are simply obsolete." 
The current Presidens: M S.I.E.C.U.S. is 
Jester Doniger, said to be the former Pub-
isher of Pulpit Digest, Director of Pulpit 
Book Club, and President of the Pulpit 
Press. Curiously, Doniges's autobiographical 
note in Who's Who In World Jewry does not 
mention his Protestant publishing business, 
and he has variously l,sted his birthplace 
as Raczki, Poland, and Vienna, Austria, We 
do know that the GreaS Neck [New York] 
News of February 14, 197, carried an article 
entitled "US-USSR Committee Announces 
Meeting," which reported that a forum would 
Kirkendall, according to the Anaheim 
Bulletin of December 19, 1968, ridiculed those 
at the I.B.M.-sponsored sex institute who 
noted that Isadore Rubin was identified as a 
Communist before the House Committee on 
Un-American Activities. "Rubin," said Kirk-
endall, "only wrote a paper for the Daily 
Worker." The sworn testimony of the New 
York detective who was in the same Red 
cell as Comrade Rubin contradicts Dr. Kirk-
endall's claim. 
2 Mrs. Koontz has just been named by 
President Nixon to head the Women's Bureau 
of the Department of Labor. 
3 S.I.E.C.0 S. director , Calderone is also a 
member of that N.C.C. Commission. 
4 Listed as sponsors M S.I E.C.U.S.'s second 
annual dinner were the notorious Hugh Hef-
ner of Playboy, John Cowles of Look, Sec-
retary of State and Mrs. Robert Strange Mc-
