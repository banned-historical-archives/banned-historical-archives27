 improvement of ties can occur. A third issue is the
 interesting character of ideological differences. The
 original issues, so important to the origin and early
 development of the Sino-Soviet dispute, have largely
 disappeared.  For the most  part, they have been
 replaced by comparative attitudes stemming from
 changes--especially in China but since 1985 also in
 the Soviet Union-in their respective political and
 economic orders. A final issue is not even that; much
 of the "problem" of Sino-Soviet relations is merely
 the "atmosphere'-'? produced by the-bad .Wood..betweeo
 the two sides since the late 1950's (one might even
 say, the late 1920's). That will improve only when a
 new track record of positive accomplishments has been
 established.
 The strategic triangle and bilateral issues go much
 of the way to explain what has happened between
 Beijing and Moscow. But more general factors are
 also influential. For instance, Sino-Soviet develop-
 ments are an excellent example of what happens when
 two modernizing (i.e., increasingly powerful) states
 have to grapple with each other. As both increase
 their strength, their range of interests generally and
 toward each other changes, and with it, their attitudes
 and policies toward one another. Modernization, power,
 border negotiations, and with the Soviet Union, as
 during the withdrawal of Soviet technicians in the
 1960's. The Kremlin selectively recalls the Mongol
 invasions many centuries ago and the enormous rise
 of Chinese population levels as justification for over-
 reacting to the 1969 border clashes and overarming
 the border with China thereafter. Political culture and
 the expression of these qualities oonfigurc the extent
 and direction of Sino-Soviet relations.
 A REVOLUTION IN_ _WEAPONRY_ _ _ _
 What happens between Moscow and Beijing turns
 on trends and events over which neither has much
 control. Since World War II, a triple revolution in
 weaponry has occurred: infinite destructibility, infin-
 ite accuracy and instant delivery. Soviet and Chinese
 military budgets must reflect these realities, and their
 security policies toward each other must take these
 developments as given. Many of their respective mil-
 itary policies follow. In the political sphere, the lateral
 ditTusion of power across the Northern Hemisphere,
 the rise of economic interdependence, and the emerg-
 ence of North-South relations all constrain how far
 the Kremlin and Tian An Men can go in competing
 (indeed, cooperating) with each other throughout the
 'rest------g                         creasing.dQ.
 law of international relations. No amount of negoti-
 ation and agreement will eliminate the. fact that the
 Soviet Union has accumulated many new interests in
 Asia stemming from its newly projectable power there
 or that latter-day economic modernization in China
 has enabled China to begin to assert itself around its
 peripheries and, with increasing conviction, in the
 Middle East and in the global strategic realm. Eco-
 nomic reform in the Soviet Union will accentuate this
 tendency only to the extent that Moscow is able to
 build up power more rapidly.
 Sino-Soviet relations are also a textbook illustration
 of what can happen when two different political cul-
 tures interact once power and interest bring them into
 increasing contact. There is an annoying racial ele-
 ment in Russian and Chinese attitudes, and hence
 policies, toward each other. The personalities of the
 top decision makers--China's Chairman Mao Zedong,
 Premier Zhou Enlai,-and present leader Deng Xiaop-
 ing, and Soviet leaders Josef Stalin, Nikita Khrush-
 chev, Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev-
 helped set the tone and the direction of Moscow-Beij-
 ing developments. Each nation has a national style
 that influences the process of negotiations, often rub-
 bing the other the wrong way and helping to deter-
 mine, for instance, what kinds of military strategies
 and levels of deployments to field against the other.
 Finally, China and Russia have historical memories
 of varying intensities and length. China selectively
 recalls negative aspects of past encounters with Rus-
 sia, as during the eighteenth and nineteenth century
 finance of technological change. Moscow and Beijing
 have found themselves increasingly far behind the West.
 Their separate but increasingly similar domestic reform
 movements are partial responses to the need to catch
 up lest they fall permanently behind. That common-
 ality eliminates areas of discord and hence tends to
 draw them together.
 Another example of systemic influences is the trend
 toward arms control. The United States and the Soviet
 Union have found, over the last three decades, a need
 to limit through negotiated agreements at least some
 of the destructive potential of contemporary weapons
 systems. As it rises to global military status, China
 also finds its security affected by the state of play in
 this aspect of American-Soviet talks, whereas the
 superpowers themselves tend more and more to take'
 bating table.
 On the basis of a "weighted average" of the inRu-
 ence of these five determinants of Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions, it is possible to forward some probable statements
 about the future. Three developments seem all but
 certain. First, the border question (and hence the troop
 disposition issue) is ripe for rapid resolution. The bor-
 der issue has never been supremely important for its
 own sake, since all that is at stake is a number of
 small islands in the Ussuri and Amur Rivers, and the
 exact location of the boundary in the Tien Shan
 Mountains that forms the division between Xinjiang
 Uygur and Uzbekistan.
 The only point of real difference has been the own-

 ership of the Hei Hsai Tzu Tao at the confluence of
 the two rivers directly across from downtown Kha-
 barovsk. The Russians illegally seized this land from
 the Chinese in the nineteenth century. But it is this
 island that Gorbachev in effect told the Chinese they
 could have back in his July, 1986, Vladivostok speech,
 when he assented to the Thalweg (channel course)
 Principle as the means of determining who owns the
 island. The two nations have already agreed to send
 out joint boundary locating teams, which will report
 back on completing their work in about-two years. -
 The more important problem of the level and kind
 of forces arrayed along both sides of the boundary
 must, of course, be dealt with as well. But this, too,
 is well on the way to solution, as the Soviet General
 Secretary, in the same Vladivostok speech, announced
 token Soviet troop withdrawals (one division) out of
 Mongolia, with the promise of more to come as nego-
 tiations proceeded. While it would be too much to
 expect a total demilitarization of the Sino-Soviet bor-
 der, a la the Rush-Bagot Treaty establishing the
 American-Canadian boundary, some kind of arms
 control agreement between Moscow and Beijing
 appears to be in the oiling. That would have to see
 the drawing down of a significant portion of the
 59-plus Soviet-divisiotts~ 'irre avtr2,~OV-~1r-cr~ft~'dlria-
 the more than 1,200 nuclear missiles deployed against
 China, as well as somewhat smaller relocations of
 Chinese forces.
 It is true that such an agreement could be followed
 by the appearance of an additional 20 or 30 Soviet
 divisions across the Iranian border, ready to invade
 the Persian Gulf area. That would be a strategic dis-
 aster for the West (to say nothing of similar possibil-
 ities of Chinese forces reconfigured to attack Taiwan
 or India or Vietnam). But the chances are reasonably
 good that these forces will in fact revert to skeleton
 status, as both countries seek to benefit economically
 from a reduced military burden. Indeed, that may be
 a principal motive on the Soviet side.
 A third near certainty is increasingly close eco-
 nomic and cultural ties. Having been so completely
 estranged for a quarter century, the potential for
 improvement is vast. Both nations have come to real-
 ize the need for better state-to-state and people-to-
 people relations. The economics-first policy orients-
 tion in both capitals can only drive trade to record
 levels (it is already increasing steeply each year). And
 each society is comparatively liberal-reformist at home,
 so that political attitudes and social structures tend
 to dovetail rather than diverge, as they did during the
 Cultural Revolution.
 Leninist-directed societies tend to have many insti-
 tutions and policies in common to start with; Mikhail
 Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping are pulling their re-
 spective societies in similar directions. This is of his-
 toric magnitude: two of the world's three largest and
 most powerful nations are, for the first time (even
 compared with the positivist orientation of the 1950's),
 approaching each other in a spirit of commonality and
 friendship. Each is genuinely interested in the other;
 each realizes the other has much to offer; and each
 has come to admit that the other has legitimate rights
 and needs. Out of such feelings lovers patch up their
 quarrels and nations establish a solid base for broad
 and long-lasting rapprochement. That is exactly what
 is happening in Sino-Soviet relations in the late 1980's.
 On the strength of these three near certain~es;-t then;  -  -  -"
 ties between Moscow and Beijing will develop rapidly
 in coming years. That enhances the likelihood, if not
 the surety, of four other developments. The first is the
 lessening of any ideological differences. Ideology has
 long since ceased to be a central aspect ofSino-Soviet
 differences; the Kremlin and the Tian An Men early
 on exhausted themselves and essentially, each gave
 up trying to convert the other. But a fundamental
 change has taken place, first in China after 1976 and
 then in the Soviet Union after 1984: both countries
 took as their first task the all-around, rapid modern-
 ization of their economies and a concomitant freeing
 up of social and (to a lesser extent) political controls.
 Both concluded that the strict central planning, state
 owners tp, par  - trechon sty e'T  o~'eco`nomic Bevel-~~"~
 opment had failed. Each admitted that the econ-
 omy-and with it living standards, cultural levels and
 modes of political leadership and expression-was a
 disaster and that nothing short of major movement
 toward a mixed economy would suffice.
 Such a process of repair, now well under way in
 both nations, will occupy the policy attention of both
 parties for t}ic next decade. Facing common problems
 of similar origin and adopting not-dissimilar solu-
 tions, Gorbachev and Deng have found they have more
 to talk about and that old arguments have become
 increasingly irrelevant. Thus, each has begun to eye
 the other's efforts with cautious approval, and a sym-
 biotic relationship between them has begun to emerge.
 As modernization proceeds and as the two societies
 become more complex and tolerant of diversity, the
 ideological distance between the Soviet and the Chinese
 approaches to Marxism-Leninism will lessen greatly,
 if not entirely disappear. Already gone are the notions
 of ideological primacy, of the absolute correctness of
 one model of socioeconomic organization, and of the
 unqualified superiority of socialism. It may not be too
 long before the Chinese and Soviet leaders meet face
 to face not only to sign a new border treaty but to
 talk over common ideological problems stemming from
 latter-day modernization.
 A similar likelihood follows from the lessening of
 tensions associated with differences in stages of mod-
 ernization. The Soviet Union began economic mod-
 ernization in earnest in the late 1920's, and political
 modernization (e.g., the emergence of mass nation-

 ested in reasonably good relations with their neighbors
 in order to avoid conflict and enhance trade, and with
 improving ties among themselves, those balances may
 well undergo change. In particular, the international
 relations of all three Asian regions, until recently highly
 dependent on Sino-Soviet enmity for their form, will
 probably change. In northeast Asia, the Soviet Union
 has supported (with reservations, to be sure) North
 Korean policy toward the South, while China has
 moved (in fact, although not often admitted in public)
 to the side of South Korea and has become Seoul's
 second security guarantor, after the United States.
 In southeast Asia, Moscow has bankrolled Viet-
 nam's economy and has supplied the military where-
 withal for its invasion/occupation of Kampuchea.
 China, fearing a southeast Asia entirely under Hanoi's
 control, has stood behind Thailand, again along with
 the United States, has occasionally moved directly
 against the Vietnamese, and has assisted the three
 Cambodian rebel groups against Pnom Penh.

 come to play the role of China's representative in
 dealing with the Russians in this arena-witness the
 wrangling over where and how many Soviet SS-20
 missiles should be allowed in a new treaty.
 None of the members of the strategic triangle wish
 China actually to become an active third party, because
 the degree of complexity would rise so much as to
 endanger the success of the talks. But China's role
 must be taken into account more and more as its mil-

 emerging Chinese nuclear missile and submarine forces;
 for a decade or more, they have been of concern only
 to Moscow, but with the deployment of a true inter-
 continental range missile and a fleet of nuclear mis-

 threat to the United States as well. The global stra-
 tegic equation is thereby trilateralized.

 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
 (Continued from page 281)
 10,000 joint organizations of this sort were in existence.
 As China enters the post-Deng era, its strategy for
 scientific and technological modernization will
 increasingly reflect the attempt to combine elements
 ofstate and market. State-led policies-many of which
 will be a product of the leading group for science and
 technology-will be aimed at developing an adequate
 infrastructure for promoting indigenous development
 and absorbing foreign technology, while the market
 will be used to ensure that enterprise and research
 managers are concerned with innovation opportu-
 nities. This strategy, in many respects, is one that is
 being used by many of the newly industrialized Asian
 nations. While this strategy may not be able to pro-
 duce all desired technological advances or create over-
 all technological competitiveness, it certainly influences
 the process.
 At the same time, however, there are strict limits
 on scientific reform unless political and economic
 reforms are also introduced. In the political realm,
 these reforms will have to include a further dimin-
 ished role for the Communist party in the research
 sector, as well as an improvement_in the status and
 treatment of scientific intellectuals. Some of this has
 begun with the recent housecleaning that has taken
 place at the level of China's municipal and provincial
 science and technology commissions.
 Yet, while such changes have proceeded, the polit-
 ical demonstrations and subsequent events of
 198fr1987, involving the removal of Fang Lizhi as
 vice president of the University of Science and Tech-
 nology in Hefei and the seemingly forced resignations
 of Lu Jiaxi and Yan Dongsheng, respectively president
 and vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sci-
 ences, remind us that change will not be easy in China.
 The issue is not so much that China will require a
 democratic political system to make progress as the
 fact that sociopolitical changes and scientific and
 technological changes cannot be divorced from one
 another. This is an issue with which China has been
 grappling for over 150 years. For better or worse, it
 will be continued as Chinese leaders map out their
 future modernization strategy.
 In the economic realm, further price reform is
 essential. Until there is substantial price reform, the
 technology market will not function effectively, and
 the issue of price will limit the number of persons who
 will turn to this type of mechanism to sell or acquire
 technical know-how. Management training is another
 essential element. As many Western nations have
 learned, it is management that makes technology work
 and not vice versa. All too often, Chinese factory man-
 agers still consider technological innovation to be more
 of a bother than a benefit; they are afraid to accept
 the risk of employing a new product or component
 when they feel secure with their existing technology.
 Chinese managers need to understand the role of tech-
 nology and how to use technology to their advantage.
 Most important, the elTort to attain substantial lev-
 els of growth and technological advance can only be
 accomplished after a workable scientific and techno-
 logical infrastructure has been put into place. Policies
 for science and technology are part of an entire pack-
 age, involving all sorts of inputs ranging from finance
 to marketing. Over the last year, China has taken
 _ _
 some bold steps to stimulate forward momentum. Tbe--
 success of this elTort will not come from rigid adher-
 ence to catchy themes or strategies based on the polit-
 ical fear of falling behind. Rather, the long-term viability
 of China's present "mixed strategy" will be deter-
 mined by allowing the strategy to evolve in conjunc-
 lion with the further changes that are needed in the
 economic system.
 Government policy can have its desired impact only
 when the economic signals being sent to various actors
 in the system are, on balance, logical and internally
 consistent. In this regard, lleng Xiaoping is correct;
 what is needed is a Chinese type of modernization,
 sensitive to both the size and the complexity of the
 Chinese economy and the political system.~0ut of this
 search for a Chinese style of modernization may come    '
 a model for combining state-led initiatives with mar-
 ket forces more effectively than most developing nations   i
 or socialist countries have yet been able do.   ^
 SING-SOVIET RELATIONS

 the Iran-Iraq War and the resistance against the Soviet
 Union in Afghanistan. What can happen is graphi-
 cally displayed by the Iranian deployment of Chinese
 "Silkworm" missiles astride the Persian Gulf, ready
 to strike American-flagged vessels. Such moves force
 both superpowers to react. These kinds of Chinese
 "interventions" in a(Tairs that previously were the
 exclusive province of the Americans and Russians will
 rise in number and seriousness to the extent that
 Chinese power grows and the strategic triangle stn-_
 bilizes in equilateral form.
 The list of certainties and likelihoods in future Sino-
 Soviet relations indicates that things will change greatly.
 But other factors will tend to hold back the upswing,
 so that on balance the trend will not be so revolu-
 tionary as the above developments would indicate. In
 at least three areas, the most important developments
 are negative. For instance, it is improbable that the
 Soviet Union will consent to remove all three "obsta-
 cles" demanded by China as a condition to improving
 Sino-Soviet ties. The Kremlin cannot pull its forces
 out of Siberia and the Soviet Far East, drop its sup-
