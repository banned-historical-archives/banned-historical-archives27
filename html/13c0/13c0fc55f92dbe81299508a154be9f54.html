 Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal for the establishment

 clear from Soviet and East German statements--that Germany can
 be reunified only after establishment of a European security
 system and a rapprochement between the two German states.                    On
 the subject of East-West contacts, the USSR is seeking an agree-

 the program of international conferences and exchanges of dele-
 gations which Moscow has been promoting.

 Bolshevik Revolution Anniversary:  The 38th anniversary of
 the Bolshevik Revolution included the traditional
 speech at the Bolshoi Theater and a gay diplomatic recep-
 tion, both conforming closely to the Soviet Union's tac-
 tics of moderation.  The economic portion of the speech
 focused on the need for increasing labor productivity,
 suggesting that this problem will receive particular em-
 phasis in the forthcoming sixth :Five-Yeas Plan.  The
 ceremonial military parade display            weapons  and
 Zhukov's speech was perfunctory.                             Page  1

 Faure Continues Fight for December Elections:  The French
 National Assembly on 10 November refused by a. five-vote
 margin to accept the Council of the Republic's amendment
 to Premier Faure's bill calling for dissolution of the
 assembly on 2 January.   Faure has posed a question of
 confidence for 12 November on a bill calling for elections
 in December, using the 1951 law without the provision
 for party alliances.   If the motion is passed, elections
 may still be held next month.  The American embassy in

 lead to a serious weakening of the currency.  Fed by an
 unbalanced budget and large expenditures from the counter-

 expected to expand by 80 percent during the fiscal year
 ending 30 June 1956.  This could result in a price rise
 of as much as 140 percent and a rresumptior of bitter

 the foremost champion of anticolonialism and that the Communist
 threat has disappeared, to encourage them to follow neutral
 foreign policies, and to promote closer ties with the Orbit.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 AFGHANISTAN'S TIME OF DECISION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 3
 The forthcoming visit of Soviet premier Bulganin and party
 chief Khrushchev to Kabul in connection with their Indian trip
 focuses attention on Afghanistan's position between the Soviet
 bloc and the Western powers.  Afghanistan has always been suspi-
 cious of foreign aid and of both Soviet and Western activity
 within its borders.  However, in recent years, intensified
 conflict with Western-supported Pakistan and domestic political
 developments have resulted in increased susceptibility to Soviet
 overtures.
 EAST-GERMAN CAMPAIGN FOR WESTERN RECOGNITION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  7
 East Germany's campaign to gain Western recognition as an
 independent state has included a continuing trade offensive,
 incessant propaganda, economic and political pressures, and
 efforts to gain full or provisional status in various inter-
 national organizations.  Although no non-Communist country has
 yet formally recognized the German Democratic Republic,  several
 have taken steps in that direction.   Bonn officials have
 indicated privately that they will threaten to break relations
 with any power recognizing the GDR.
 SIGNS OF TROUBLE FOR THE COLOMBIAN DICTATORSHIP .  .  .  . .  . Page  9
 The regime of General Rojas Pinilla in Colombia faces an
 opposition which is growing in numbers and improving in organi-
 zation.  Although Rojas has tried to organize mass support for
 his government, its backing now comes almost solely from the
 armed forces, which are likely to turn against the dictator if
 popular dissatisfaction continues to mount.
 AGRICULTURAL COLLECTIVIZATION IN SINO-SOVIET BLOC .
 . Page
 Drives to collectivize agriculture have been stepped up in
 Communist China and renewed in the East European Satellites
 during 1955.   In the Soviet Union, where collective and state
 farms covered about 95 percent of the total cultivated area as
 early as 1938, the present emphasis is on expanding output of
 crops in a system already socialized.   China and especially the
 Satellites are apparently avoiding the worst excesses practiced
 by the USSR when it introduced collectivization, and are applying
 methods which may be more effective in the long run in achieving
 the goals of a collective system.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 November 1955
 PART I
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 ARAB-ISRAELI S ITUAT ION
 Israeli and Arab forces
 have remained on the alert
 since the clash. in the E1 Auja
 demilitarized zone on 2 Novem
 ?ber, but no further incidents
 of,serious proportions occurred
 during. the week.   Foreshadowing
 possible future trouble, how-
 ever,.was a clash between small
 Egyptian and Israeli forces in
 the vicinity of Eilat,   Israel's
 port on the Gulf of Aqaba.
 The El Auja action was
 followed by sporadic incidents
 along the Jordanian border,
 possibly the result of encour-
 agement given the Arab refugees
 there by Egypt, and by terror-
 .ism attributed to Egyptian or
 Syrian-trained Fedayeen bands
 operating inside Israel.   The
 extensive mobilization of Israe-
 li  forces, which had taken
 place just before the attack
 of 2 November, was reportedly
 relaxed, however, and all the
 buses and' 'some trucks  requisi-
 tioned by the Israeli army were
 returned to civilian use.
 The clash near Eilat on
 8 November, while possibly in-
 advertent in itself, recalled
 an earlier threat by Egyptian
 prime minister Nasr that Egypt
 would not counter Israel in
 the Gaza strip but would strike
 elsewhere, and the vigorous as-
 sertions by Israeli prime min-
 ister Ben-Gurion that Israel
 must break the Egyptian block-
 ade of the Gulf of Aqaba, Isra-
 el's alternative to the' Suez
 Canal route to the East.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE-WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 November 1955
 The border flare-ups coin-
 cided with Israel's contention
 that Western d,plomatic action
 and arms aid are essential to
 prevent the outbreak of a new
 Arab-Israeli war.   In this at-
 mosphere,  Israeli foreign minis-
 ter  Sharett followed up his
 talks with the foreign ministers
 attending the Geneva conference
 with.a trip to the United States.
 Sharett's movements evoked the
 usual barrage of hostile state-
 ments from the Arab capitals.
 A press report that the United
 States was giving consideration
 to Israeli. arms requests suf-
 ficed to bring an expression of
 FOREIGN ; MINISTERS' CONFERENCE
 Germany and European Security
 Foreign Minister Molotov's
 proposal of 2 November for an
 all-German council, which he
 strongly defended on 8 November,
 was based on a plan offered
 by the East German government.
 It merely spells out the Soviet
 Position--already clear from
 East German statements--that
 Germany can be unified only af-
 ter establishment of    Epro-   .
 pean security system and a rap-
 prochement between the two Ger-
 man states.   Unlike Moscow's
 frequently proposed provisional
 government, whose primary goal
 would have been the holding of
 all-German elections, the new
 all-German council would con-
 centrate on closer relations
 between the two German states in
 such fields as trade, finance,
 and communications.
 The USSR has not been as
 blunt as East Germany in stat-
 ing that the "internal prerequi-
 sites" for unity and free elec-
 tions necessitate changing West
 "serious concern" from the Iraqi
 foreign minister.
 Egypt's handling of the
 incidents in its propaganda,
 which claimed that Egyptian
 forces had counterattacked in
 the El Auja area on 3 November
 and driven the Israelis back
 with heavy casualties, was in-
 terpreted by Israeli officials
 and other observers to mean
 that Egypt was not ready at this
 time to take on Israel,in a
 war?   The Cairo regime appeared
 to be continuing to concentrate
 on building up its. armaments.
 F__         I
 Germany's economic and social,,
 pattern to close the gap be-
 tween it and East Germany and
 driving "militarists".from
 power in Bonn.   Moscow has shown
 its support of this principle,
 however, by insisting on rap-
 prochement between East and West
 Germany as the first step to
 reunification.   At the 8 Novem-
 ber conference session, Molo-
 tov stated more clearly than
 ever that one reason why all-
 German elections are now impos-
 sible is that they might result
 in the destruction of the East
 German economic system.
 Having bluntly argued that
 the division of Germany will
 continue for a long time and
 can ultimately be ended only by
 the Germans themselves, the USSR
 is apparently willing to devote
 some effort to building up the.
 prestige and stability of the
 East German Communist regime.
 Molotov repeated old pro-
 posals for a prompt withdrawal.
 of all but limited contingents

 of troops from Germany and for
 an agreement by the two German
 states on the strength of their
 "armed units."      He criticized
 the West for withdrawing Eden's
 proposal for an inspection of
 forces in a zone on either side
 of the East-West German line.
 He also claimed that the Western
 security plan fails to protect
 Germany's neighbors and in par-
 ticular provides no safeguards
 if Germany should dacide at
 some time to ignore its treaty
 obligations.
 East-West Contacts
 The USSR has continued to
 insist that free East-West
 trade must precede any increase
 in other contacts.   It argues
 that Western strategic controls
 are the major obstacle to world
 trade, and are therefore the
 only important topic for discus-
 sion by the subcommittee of
 experts concentrating on East-
 West trade.   The USSR's tactics
 have indicated that it hopes to
 exact an agreement or promise
 on loosening trade controls
 as part of any general agree-
 ment on increasing East-West
 exchanges.
 The Soviet objective in
 the negotiations of a second
 subcommittee of experts on
 East-West contacts appears to
 be an agreement reaffirming in
 general terms the programs the
 USSR has been encouraging.
 These could include internation-
 al  conferences and exchanges
 of delegations in scientific,
 technical, industrial, agricul-
 tural, cultural, and other
 fields, exchanges of publica-
 tions, and increased tourism.
 On the other hand, the
 Soviet delegate has used every
 filibustering and evasive de-
 vice he could to keep Western
 representatives from making
 demands which he says would
 interfere with Soviet internal
 affaLirs.   These include the
 ending of censorship and jam-
 ming procedures, better exchange
 rates for tourists, and free-
 dom                                                        of diplomats to travel
 and free sale of publications
 within each country.   The USSR
 appears to be concerned by the
 West's success in pointing to
 those aspects of the Soviet
 system that still, inhibit mean-
 ingful East-West contacts.

 PART II
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Bolshevik Revolution Anniversary
 The 38th anniversary of
 the Bolshevik Revolution was
 highlighted by the traditional
 speech at the Bolshoi Theater
 and the currently fashionable
 gay diplomatic reception the
 next evening,  at which Soviet
 leaders undertook to dance po7.-
 kas, mazurkas,  and gavottes in
 demonstration of their human
 qualities.
 Since 1947,  the honor of
 delivering the important annual
 year-end review has rotated
 among members of the party pre-
 sidium.   This year's spokesman,
 L. M.  Kaganovich, a first deputy
 premier and chairman of the
 State Committee for Wages and
 Labor, restricted himself to
 previously well-defined themes
 of the party line.   He remained
 in character as an Old Bolshevik
 on a Bolshevik occasion, com-
 bining doctrinaire attitudes
 and expressions with the Khru-
 shchev-Bulganin coexistence
 policy.
 His speech,  although it
 utilized such cliches of the
 revolution as "dictatorship of
 the proletariate," "class strug-
 gle," and "belief in the vic-
 tory of Communism in the 20th
 Century," nevertheless managed
 not to distort the Soviet Union's
 current peace line.
 Foreign Policy Implications
 Kaganovich reaffirmed the
 USSR's loyalty to "the struggle
 for peace and coexistence" but
 reiterated the adamant Soviet
 stand on the German issue and
 the need for agreeing on a
 European security plan.   His
 brief reference to disarmament
 marked time along the lines of
 Bulganin's 19 September letter
 to President Eisenhower in
 stressing the necessity of end-
 ing the armaments race and ban-
 ning atomic weapons.
 Kaganovich devoted partic-
 ular attention to the USSR's
 good relations with the Bandung
 powers and affirmed the signifi-
 cance of Bulganin's and Khru-
 shchev's coming visits to India,
 Burma,  and Afghanistan.   He de-
 clared that the Soviet Union
 will always remain on the side
 of the peoples of Asia, and
 Africa in their struggle for
 freedom and independence.
 Kaganovich analyzed the
 nature of Communist revolution
 at some length, in an apparent
 attempt to rebut Western. charges
 of international Communist con-
 spiracy while reaffirming faith
 in the inevitable world triumph
 of socialism.   This was the
 first public speech by a top
 Soviet leader which rationalized
 the relationship of the USSR
 and non-Orbit Communist parties
 within the framework of "relaxa-
 tion of tensions."
 Internal Implications
 Kaganovich carefully steered
 around the troubled question
 of the composition of the Soviet
 leadership. He did not even
 dimly echo any implied criti-
 cism of Molotov, and discreetly
 observed the "collectivity prin-
 ciple" by balancing praise for
 Khrushchev's and Bulganin's
 speeches before "our central
 committee."  Achievements of the
 Soviet Union were prudently as-
 signed to the leadership of
 Lenin and the Communist Party.
 Reflecting present Soviet
 preoccupation with the sixth
 Five-Year Plan to be promulgated
 at the Twentieth Party Congress
 in February 1956, Kaganovich
 focused attention on the labor
 productivity problem in indus-
 try, transport, and agriculture.
 He stressed the necessity f-ar
 rapid introduction of up-to-date
 scientific and technological

 achievements and rationalization
 of labor. This emphasis probably
 anticipates the major methods
 for expanding industrial output
 which will be employed in the
 forthcoming plan.
 Kaganovich called for
 Satellite implementation of
 "the Lenin plan for construction
 of Socialism."  He stressed co-
 ordination of bloc economic
 plans and, unlike recent dis-
 cussions of the same subject,
 said nothing about special con-
 ditions in each of the Satel-
 lites.   Such projected co-opera-
 tive economic planning may
 signify an increased role for
 the Council of Mutual Economic
 Assistance.
 Military Parade
 Marshal Zhukov's 10-minute
 oration preceding the 7 November
 parade was the mildest address
 delivered by a military figure
 since Stalin's death.   There
 were no references to encircling
 military bases,  imperialist
 threats,  or military groupings,
 and only an indirect call for
 strengthening the Soviet armed
 might, a standard ingredient of
 such speeches.
 The display of military
 force, conforming to this pattern,
 was of modest proportions.   No
 new Soviet aircraft were dis-
 played in the parade fly-by,
 which included one BISON jet
 heavy bomber, nine BADGER jet
 medium bombers, and fewer than
 50 jet fighters.   Similarly,
 in contrast to previous Soviet
 celebrations, the parade re-
 vealed no new ground equipment
 and was a perfunctory display.

 For December        ec ions
 The French National Assem-
 bly on 10 November refused by a
 five-vote margin to accept the
 Council of the-Republic's amend-
 ment to Premier Faure's bill
 calling for dissolution of the
 assembly on 2 January. Faure
 has posed a question of confi-
 dence for 12 November on a bill
 calling for elections in Decem-
 ber using the 1951 law without
 the provision for party alli-
 ances.   If the motion is passed,
 elections may still be held
 next month.   The American em-
 bassy in Paris does not expect
 the council to oppose the gov-
 ernment a second time.
 The tight schedule implied
 in Faure's 3 November proposal
 demanded immediate compliance
 with his wishes.   Under law, the
 Ministry of the Interior must

 amendment added by the council,
 specifying a different election
 procedure than that suggested
 by Faure, would have ruined the
 premier's schedule because it
 would have necessitated new
 electoral district boundaries.
 Under the new plan report-

 November, elections would be
 held under the 1951 law which
 permits departmental party lists

 The single-candidate sys-
 tem suggested by the council
 has been championed by Mendes-
 France, who won Radical Socialist
 support for it over Premier
 Faure's opposition during the
 party congress of 3-6 November.
 Under this system, each party
 could present one candidate in
 each electoral district of ap-
 proximately arrondissement size.
 If no candidate won a majority
 on the first ballot, a plurality
 would suffice in a runoff vote.
 Much of Faure's coalition,

 preference for the 1951 law with

 French Opinion
 Increasing y  ritical of NATO
 There has been a marked
 decline in French support for.
 NATO during the past year as
 the North African situation has
 deteriorated.  France has been
 forced to withdraw troops com-
 mitted to the defense of Western
 Europe and periain' nationalist
 leaders have been calling for
 steps which would have an even
 more drastic effect on the
 Western alliance.
 The French government holds
 to the position that NATO, the
 cornerstone of Western defense,
 is not a subject for East-West
 discussion; but this firmness
 has been attributed more to For-
 eign Minister Pinay than to the
 more "flexible" Premier Faure.
 At Geneva last July, Faure
 seemed on the verge of officially
 advocating the idea, proposed
 by former premier Mendes-France
 before the UN General Assembly
 ent electoral law, many Social-
 ists would also probably favor
 it over a single-candidate
 system.   Moreover, the resolu-
 tion reportedly offered by Faure
 for the 12 November confidence
 vote is the system voted for by
 the assembly's Universal Suf-
 frage Committee which was based
 on a Socialist proposal to re-
 move the alliance provision.
 The Communists, who voted
 with the government on the 3
 November dissolution bill,  had
 been hoping to turn the method
 of party affiliation permitted
 in the 1951 law to their favor.
 by alliances with the Socialists.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEIE1LY SUMMARY
 10 November 1955
 Mendes-France's address
 to the Radical Socialist Panty's
 congress on 3 November was an
 apparent move to exploit such
 sentiment in the coming national
 elections.   Urging the party
 to adopt a social and economic
 reform program to be financed
 primarily by savings in the
 military budget, he further
 proposed that after the North
 African problem is solved the
 military conscription term be
 reduced immediately from 18 to
 15 months, and as soon as
 possible to 12 months.
 A more immediate threat
 to NATO stems from the French
 government's determination  to
 reinforce North Africa at the
 expense of NATO-committed mili-
 tary forces in Europe.   Many
 troop transfers have been made
 during the past year with only
 summary notice to SHAPE, and
 half of the French army's com-
 bat strength is now across the
 Mediterranean.   The minister of
 national defense.  indicated to
 Ambassador Dillon  on 5 November
 that there might be additional
 transfers of NATO-committed
 ground forces from Europe.
 Even more drastic moves are
 being demanded in other quarte:cs.

 cabinet on 5 November, opens a

 PART II
 Gau7Llist senator Michel Debre,
 perhaps the most influential
 member of the Council of the
 Republic, recently told Dillon
 that most Frenchmen now consider
 NATO "the wrong kind of alliance
 in the wrong place," i.e., a
 military alliance in Europe,
 where no fighting is taking
 place, instead of in North Africa.
 Ile proposed that NATO be en-
 larged--in area as a basis for
 a common Western policy for
 North Africa, and in scope by
 stressing economic and social
 functions along lines already
 advocated by Scandinavian mem-
 ber countries.
 An editorial in the influ-
 ential leftist Paris daily Le
 Monde suggested in mid-September
 that France cut its NATO military
 commitments to a few M-day di-
 visions and retain'the remainder,
 of its forces for purely national
 missions,  as Britain and the
 United States have done.   During
 the :military budget debates in
 the National Assembly in July,
 the chairman of the assembly's
 defense committee proposed that
 France's primary NATO defensive
 mission be the Western Mediter-
 ranean and Africa.
 The government must
 soon request assembly approval
 of additional military expend-
 itures because of the expanded
 North African operations.
 Renewed recriminations can be
 expected against the subordi-

 interests to those of the

 cession to the throne in 1927,
 he is almost certain to resort
 to his former obstructionist
 tactics in relation to the
 French.
 Despite Ben Youssef's cor.-
 dial conversations with French
 government officials,  terrorism
 in Morocco remains at a record
 level.   His failure to mention
 the continued terrorist activity
 in his press releases is caus-
 ing uncertainty and cynicism
 among French residents in Mor-
 occo.   The French settler organ-
 ization, Presence Francaise,
 bowing to the inevitability of
 Ben Youssef's reinstatement,
 has turned to the defense of
 French long-term interests in
 Morocco and now demands "numer-
 ically equal" representation
 for French and Moroccans in all
 government councils.   The organ-
 iza.tion also requests represen-
 tation during the negotiation
 of reforms and the proposed new
 French-Moroccan treaty.
 Relations between the sul-
 tan and the dominant nationalist
 party,  Istigla.l,  are not yet
 clear,  although the party has
 indicated its willingness to
 participate in a. Moroccan gov-
 ernment.   The less important
 Shoura,  also known as the Dem-
 ocratic Party of Independence,
 is intensifying its campaign to
 build up its organization at
 the expense of the Istiglal
 party.
 Many  rreviously pro-French
 Moroccans
 are said  to have
 joined the Shoura in an effort
 PART II
 to get on the nationalist band-
 wagon.   French officials who
 have in the past played off one
 nationalist group against the
 other probably will try to cap-
 italize on this rivalry among
 the nationalists.
 Algeria:   The seriousness
 of the 'military  situation in
 Algeria prompted the French
 minister of defense to request
 the United States to make avail-
 able 20 to 30 large helicopters
 in addition to the seven on hand.
 The defense minister said that
 in view of the difficult terrain
 conditions,  the only alternative
 to increasing the number of heli-
 copters in use by French forces
 was to augment French troops in
 Algeria to 300,000.   Present
 military strength is estimated
 at 145,000, and any appreciable
 increase could be made only at
 the further expense of France's
 NATO commitments.
 Slow progress is being made
 to implement Governor General
 Soustelle's modest reform pro-
 gram.   Algerian Moslems now are
 contemptuous of such measures
 as recognition of Arabic as a
 second language and separation
 of the Moslem religion from
 state control,  though they had
 agitated for these measures for
 more than 10 years.
 Soustelle has advocated
 that parliamentary elections
 not be. held in Algeria simul
 tanEeously with those in France
 and that revision of the Alger-
 ian Statute be postponed until
 after Algerian elections are
 held.   Such delays might cause
 more of the moderate Algerian
 Moslems to adopt the hardened
 position of the extremists.

 Afghan-Pakistani Situation
 Tension continues high on
 the Afghan-Pakistani border as
 Kabul prepares for a Grand
 Assembly of the Tribes       (Loe
 Jirgha) scheduled for 14 Novem-
 ber to discuss national policy
 on Pushtoonistan.   Opponents
 of Prime Minister Daud may
 attempt to use the meeting to
 discredit him, but Daud will
 probably be able to obtain the
 assembly's support for his un-
 yielding policy on Pushtooni-
 stan and will try to interpret
 this as approval of his over-
 all foreign policy.
 While continuing to deny
 any hostile activities, Afghan-
 istan is apparently keeping up
 pressure on the Pakistani bor-
 der.                 Press stories have re-
 ported border incidents and
 sabotage within Pakistan, one
 of which has been confirmed
 by the Pakistani Foreign Minis-
 try.
 No major disturbance is
 likely, however, until the as-
 sembly has passed on the Push-
 toonistan issue.   If Daud is
 able to obtain even an equivo-
 cal expression of confidence
 from the tribesmen, he will have
 demonstrated his independence
 of other elements of the royal
 family, and may then pursue his
 anti-Pa.kistani and pro-Soviet

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 President Rhee personally
 canceled a decision of the
 National Assembly to increase
 government revenues from the
 sale of monopoly goods and serv-
 ices.   Income taxes were re-
 cently reduced, although Ameri-
 can officials believe that the
 tax burden has not yet reached
 a desirable maximum.   The deci-
 sion to let surplus rice deteri-
 orate rather than sell it to
 Japan, as well as the general
 ban on trade with Japan, has
 hurt the economy.   Reports also
 suggestthat a considerable
 portion of imported aid goods
 are being diverted from govern-
 ment to private channels.
 Closer Relations
 Between Ecuador and Soviet Bloc
 Closer relations seem to
 be developing between Ecuador
 and the Soviet bloc.   Ecuador's
 primary aim is apparently the
 acquisition of arms, while the
 bloc's interest seems to be in
 increased penetration of Latin
 America.
 ere have been several
 examples of efforts by
 mem ers of the Soviet bloc to
 cials.
 The exchange rate is fixed
 at its present levels until
 September 1956 by US-South
 Korean agreement.   President
 Rhee has argued for years that
 constant changes in the rate
 were responsible for past infla-
 tion, and that a fixed rate
 would automatically stabilize
 prices.   Should this theory be
 proved false by a significant
 rise in prices in the coming
 months--as is certain at the
 presently jlanned level of
 foreign assistance--he is likely
 to shift responsibility to the
 United States by renewing his
 charges of nonco-operation on
 the part of American aid offi-
 expand relations with Ecuador.
 Czechoslovakia, besides attempt-
 ing to increase its general
 trade with Ecuador, has added
 a commercial attache and re-
 portedly a military attache to
 its legation and has established
 a regular courier service.
 Poland, whose minister
 accredited to Quito is resident
 in Mexico City, has been making:
 "unbelievably favorable" offers
 of merchandise in an effort to
 increase its sales in the
 Ecuadoran market.
 Ecuador's desire to get
 arms from Soviet bloc sources
 evidently stems from its long-
 standing boundary dispute with
 Peru and the fears of Peruvian
 intentions which caused it to
 bring charges of aggression
 before the Organization of
 American States in early Septem-
 ber.   Ecuador has not been able
 to obtain the arms it wants from
 sources in the western hemis-
 phere.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECT IVES
 SOVIET AIMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH ASIA
 Moscow's recent successes
 in the Middle East have been
 accompanied by increased Sino-
 Soviet diplomatic and economic
 activity in South Asia, where
 Premier Bulganin and Party
 First Secretary Khrushchev are
 scheduled to visit later this
 month.   The aims of Soviet
 policy are to convince non-
 Orbit Asian states that the
 Communist threat has disappeared,
 to encourage them to follow
 "neutralist" foreign policies,
 and to promote closer ties
 with the Orbit.
 Moscow probably believes
 it car exploit "the Geneva
 spirit" and, together with
 Communist China, employ divi-
 sive tactics that will exclude
 Western influence in the area
 in an ever-increasing degree.
 It is unlikely the South Asian
 states will ignore overtures
 from Moscow and Peiping.   There
 has already been a report that
 the Thai premier fears US-
 Chinese Communist negotiations
 will leave Thailand in the
 lurch with its "tough policy"
 toward Communist China.
 Bulganin and Khrushchev
 are scheduled to visit the
 three Asian states which thus
 far have responded most favora-
 bly to Soviet approaches--
 Afghanistan, India, and Burma..
 They undoubtedly hope their
 visit to the area will cause
 even the most pro-Western
 states of Africa. and Asia to
 re-examine the wisdom of their
 present policies.
 In encouraging closer
 relations between the Sino-
 Soviet bloc and the more "neu-
 tralist" members of the Arab
 League and South Asian states,
 the USSR aims to "encircle"
 the Baghdad powers and isolate
 the Asian members of the Manila
 pact--Thailand and Pakistan
 in particular--as a first step
 toward weakening their ties
 with the West.   The Soviet
 leaders will probably try to
 convince their Asian hosts
 that both the Baghdad and
 Manila, pacts must be dissolved.
 Aid Policy
 Moscow's current policies
 toward the Bandung nations--
 all the major states of the
 Middle East and South Asia--
 have been carefully designed
 to take advantage of popular
 attitudes and the aspirations
 of individual states or groups
 of states, regardless of the
 fact that many are pursuing
 firmly anti-Communist internal
 policies.   Moscow's military
 assistance to Egypt and its
 formal support, along with
 that of. Nehru and U Nu, to the
 "five principles" and the
 objectives of Bandung are cases
 in point.
 The USSR's prompt response
 to requests by "neutralist"
 Arab League states for mili-
 tary assistance will serve
 as a cogent example to the
 South Asian states of the
 advantages of reaching long-
 range commercial agreements
 with the Soviet bloc, ostensi-
 bly free from the threat of
 Communist subversion and on a,
 basis profitable to both sides.
 Kaga.novich said in his October
 Revolution address on 6 Novem-
 ber that the USSR ha.d no
 designs for exporting revolu-
 tion.
 Moscow will probably con-
 tinue to present its offers
 to the South Asian states with-
 out strings attached,  in a
 form most likely to be accepted
 by the sensitive Asian national-
 ists.  The Soviet Union prob-
 ably will emphasize the favor-
 able prospects for expanded

 Soviet economic and technical
 assistance to the South Asian
 states, rather than the mili-
 tary aid which it found more
 appropriate for the "neutral-
 ist" Arab states.
 Participation in Conferences
 The USSR probably will
 press for full participation
 in Middle Eastern affairs at
 an early date.   Soviet spokes-
 men have already indicated that
 Moscow would be willing to
 sign a treaty in conjunction
 with other powers guaranteeing
 the neutrality of the area.
 There have been several indica-
 tions that the USSR might press
 for a separate conference on
 Middle East problems following
 the foreign ministers' meeting
 in Geneva.
 Izvestia declared on 3
 Novem er  however, that the
 USSR would not adhere to the
 1950 tripartite declaration by
 the US, UK and France on the
 Middle East and thereby become
 a party to the "colonizing"
 approach of the Western powers
 toward the Arab states,  es-
 pecially Egypt.
 In the absence of talks
 with the Western powers on
 Middle East problems, Moscow
 will. attempt to accomplish its
 aims by unilateral efforts to
 increase its influence with
 the Bandung powers.
 A Soviet correspondent
 in Geneva believes the USSR
 will be invited to participate
 in a. second Asian-African con-
 ference, which he understands
 will be held in Cairo in the
 spring of 1956                          25X1

 premier Nasr.  Prime Minister
 U Nu has already expressed his
 personal willingness to accept
 the Soviet Union as a partici-
 pant.  Moscow would have a
 unique opportunity at such a
 conference to press for its
 objectives.
 Baghdad and Manila Pacts
 There are already signs
 that Moscow and Peiping are
 making overtures designed to
 "dissolve" the Baghdad and
 Manila pact alignments.   Moscow
 protested to Tehran when Iran
 adhered to the Baghdad pact on
 12 October and remained offi-
 cially cool toward Iranian
 officials for several weeks.

 AFGHANISTAN'S TIME OF DECISION
 The forthcoming visit of
 Soviet premier Bulganin and
 party chief Khrushchev to Kabul
 in connection with their Indian
 trip focuses attention on Af-
 ghanistan's position between
 the Soviet bloc and the Western
 powers.   Afghanistan has always
 been suspicious of the politi-
 cal implications of both So-
 viet and Western activity with-
 in its borders.  However, in
 recent years, intensified con-
 flict with Western-supported
 Pakistan  and domestic politi-
 nations of the Pacific, includ
 ing the United States, would
 participate.   In Moscow's view,
 this would replace such align-
 ments as the Manila pact.
 Sino-Soviet Co-ordination
 The USSR and Communist
 China appear to be in accord
 with regard to over-all Commu-
 nist policies toward the Arab
 and South Asian powers and there
 are, in fact, some signs of
 close co-ordination between Mos-
 cow and Peiping.   Both have de-
 fined their policies toward the
 Bandung powers as being based
 on the "five principles" and
 the Objectives of the Afro-Asian
 conference.   They also have p r o-
 moted India as the leader of
 the area and as a candidate for
 "sixth great power" status in
 international affairs.   A suc-
 cessful Sino-Soviet effort to
 promote a"neutralist" bloc of
 Asian states with India and
 Egypt as keystones would accom..
 plish the immediate aims of
 both the USSR and Communist
 China.
 cal developments have resulted
 in increased susceptibility to
 Soviet overtures.   The Soviet
 Union has taken advantage of
 these developments to cultivate
 a closer relationship with Af-
 ghanistan.
 Bulganin and Khrushchev
 probably will try to take ad-
 vantage of these circumstances
 to attempt to  ::ie Afghanistan
 in.more closely with current
 Soviet strategy in the Middle
 East.

 10 November 1955
 Traditional Afghan Orientation
 For almost 150 years Af-
 ghan policy has aimed almost
 exclusively at maintaining in-
 dependence in the face of pres-
 surefrom Russia on the north
 and Britain on the south and
 profiting from competition be-
 tween the great-powers.  At
 some times, Russian influence
 has been predominant.; at others,
 British.  Afghanistan has al-
 ways managed to shake off both.
 Even though the British
 withdrew from India in 1947,
 the Afghans have assumed that
 the competition continues,,par-
 tially as a result of the Ameri-
 can interest in the area. Their
 traditional policy remains un-
 altered.  King Zahir Shah in
 opening the Afghan National As-
 semlily on 2 July 1955 expressed
 it simply:   "The pursuit and
 preservation of neutrality has

 was received from the United
 States.            Export-Import Bank
 loans totaling $39,200,000 fi-
 nanced development of the Eel-
 mand Valley by the American
 construction firm of Morrison-
 Knudsen.                                   Afghan;.c+   's trade
 with nonbloc countries was
 three to five times greater than
 with the USSR.
 Recent Developments
 In 1954, the USSR extended
 the equivalent of $6,200,000
 and Czechoslovakia $5,000,000
 for development projects, such
 as grain and gasoline storage
 facilities, road-building equin-
 ment, and small industrial
 plants.   These are to be repaid
 in goods over an extended: pe-
 riod.
 The Pakistani blockade
 of normal Afghan trade routes
 in the summer of 1955 apparently
 resulted in.a stepping up of
 deliveries under the barter
 agreement with the USSR, al-
 though these were inadequate
 to meet all the shortages caused
 by the blockade.   After the
 blockade was lifted, Afghanistan
 continued to attempt to develop
 transportation channels inde-
 pendent of Pakistan, including
 those through the USSR which
 were provided for in a transit
 a reement signed last -Tune.
 Afghan export.-import trade with
 West Germany is already reported
 moving over this route.  Afghan-
 istan is attempting to improve
 its road connections with the
 Soviet border.
 Negotiations for arms from
 Czechoslovakia are under con-
 sideration and deliveries under
 a $3,000,000 cash deal are
 apparently already being made.
 An Afghan military mission is
 about to depart for Prague
 and two Czech arms experts are
 reportedly in Kabul.   Neti:So-
 viet offers to provide without
 charge teachers and equipment
 for Kabul University and a
 500-bed hospital for the capital
 have recently been reported.
 All Soviet-Afghan deals in the
 past, however, have been on a
 cash or credit basis, and many
 previous offers of gifts were
 not carried out.
 Radio Moscow has with
 increasing frequency in the past
 few months linked Afghanistan
 with Egypt, Syria,  .nc' others
 which have rejected the "northern
 tier" defense arrangement,  tail-
 ing them the "neutral, peace-
 lOving nations of the Middle
 East."  This propaganda may be
 preparatory to modification by
 the USSR of its past individual,
 cautious approach to Afghanistan
 in favor of an attempt to in-
 clude Afghanistan in the Soviet
 Middle Eastern strategy.
 Afghanistan's Present Attitude
 Afghanistan has recently
 indicated increase:?. dissatis-
 faction with the long-termas-
 pects of the Helmand Valley
 program and suggested several
 changes.  At least two of these
 may cause a: rouble when a pending
 Import-Export Bank mission,
 which has to approve the changes,
 reaches Kabul.   They are a pro-
 posal to abandon a project to
 develop roads connecting Afghan-
 istan with Pakistan and to begin
 development of the Helmand del-
 ta area on the Iranian border.
 The latter proposal raises the
 danger.of intensifying a long
 smouldering dispute with Iran.
 A possibility of increased
 American economic aid under the
 President's Fund for Asian Re-
 gional Development, which is
 tied into co-operation with Pak-
 istan, has received a cool ini-
 tial reception.
 Afghanistan's new national
 airline, Aryana, which is managed
 by an American, has also proved
 unsatisfactory to the Afghans
 and probably added to their dis-
 content with Western assistance.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE. SYEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 November 1955
 Afghanistan has recently
 "been vigorously attempting to
 determine what it can expect
 from both power blocs.   It has
 made clear that its main de-
 sire is political support for
 itc, unrealistic demands for in-
 dependence for the Pushtoon
 tribal ;areas of Pakistan.   It
 has received no encouragement
 on this from the West and lit-
 tle from the Soviet Union.
 Soviet economic activities,
 however, such as the recent de-
 livery of Kabul's first modern
 buses and taxicabs, have attracted favorable attention and have
 served immediate needs.   The
 $5,000,000 Czech credit extend-
 ed in 1954 is to be repaid in
 goods at 3 percent interest..
 This probably compares favorably
 in Afghan minds with the Export-
 Import Bank loan, which requires
 repayment in dollars at 3.5 and
 4.5. percent .
 Afghanistan's long-standing
 attempt to obtain arms from
 nonbloc.sources has had little
 success, in part due to the
 fact that the material would
 probably be forbidden transit
 by Pakistan, through which it
 would have to come.  Afghani-
 stan's interest in the recent
 ,Soviet bloc arms deal with Egypt
 and its dealings with Czecho-
 slovakia for arms are there-
 ,fore not surprising.
 Future Trends
 The Afghans evidently be-
 lieve. they are not getting what
 they want from the United States.
 They may believe they can get
 it from-the Soviet bloc.   The
 fact that several years of
 American activity has resulted
 in no political pentration may
 lead them to feel that similar
 ties with the USSR can be safely
 undertaken.   Consequently, they
 may, especially  in view of the
 crisis with rakistan, be in a.
 SECRET
 mood to accept Soviet aid with-
 out the restrictions they have
 imposed'in the past.  These
 restrictions apparently have
 limited Soviet activities,,to the
 northern part of the country
 and prevented the permanent
 stationing of. technicians in
 Afghanistan..
 Perhaps the most important
 factor in the Afghan decision
 is Prime Minister Daud, who
 has always been less suspicious
 of the Soviet Union than other
 Afghan leaders.   Daud.has been
 unable to obtain Western sup-
 port for his extreme policies
 against Pakistan and for rapid
 modernization of his country..
 He reportedly told the Afghan
 parliament on 17 October that
 he now proposes to see what
 he can get from the USSR.
 The calling of a rare Grand
 Assembly of the Tribes by King
 Zahir Shah for 14 November in-
 dicates a major policy deci-
 sion is pending.   Unlike the
 "rubber-stamp" parliament, the
 tribal assembly cannot easily
 be controlled by Daud and may
 upset his plans. Presumably,
 however, he will attempt to
 limit discussions to the Push-
 toonistan issue with Pakistan,.
 and if he obtains support for
 this, will try to use it to
 justify the over-all policy of
 his government.
 Although influential ele-
 ments in the Afghan government
 probably remain opposed to in-
 creasing dependence on the USSR,.
 Daudi is stubborn and impetuous
 and unlikely to retreat from
 a policy to which he is already
 deeply committed.   Consequently,
 if he stays in control, he may
 be receptive to new Soviet offers
 when Bulganin and Khrushchev
 visit Kabul, reportedly for a
 stay of three or four days.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 November 1955
 EAST GERMAN CAMPAIGN FOR WESTERN RECOGNITION
 East Germany's campaign to
 gain Western recognition as an
 independent state has included
 a continuing trade offensive,
 incessant propaganda., economic
 and political pressures, and
 efforts to gain full or pro-
 visional status in various in-
 ternational organizations.
 Western recognition of
 the German Democratic Republic
 (GDR)  is an important goal of
 Soviet policy.  The Moscow
 treaty of 20 September by which
 the USSR ostensibly granted
 East Germany full independence,
 was clearly designed to raise
 the GDR. to equality with the
 Federal Republic and to enhance
 its capabilities for obtaining
 recognition.
 No non-Communist country
 has formally recognized East
 Germany but several have taken
 steps in that direction, and
 some will be susceptible to
 new overtures.
 While East Germany will
 probably concentrate its pres-
 sure on the West Germans, it
 is unlikely to gain recogni-
 tion from Bonn as long as
 Adenauer remains in power.   In
 fact, Bonn officially has pri-
 vately threatened to break re-
 lations with any power recog-
 nizing the GDR.   Bonn must, how-
 ever, deal with East Germany
 on a. variety of subjects and
 will probably be willing to
 meet it on a, governmental level
 on such essential matters as
 trade and transport.
 travelers except officials of
 Western occupying powers.
 Sovereignty over its air
 space, granted by the Soviet-
 East German protocol of 25
 March 1954 and emphasized in
 the September 1955 treaty, pre-
 sumably includes the right to
 impose some controls on the
 existing French, British and
 American commercial air services
 into West Berlin,  and to demand
 government-level negotiations
 on their continuation.
 Government-level air agree-
 ments' will probably -result from
 the opening of East Germany to
 commercial service.   The Soandi-
 nav:ian  Airways System recently
 inaicated that it may apply
 to East Germany for overflight
 rights to Berlin.
 The GDR will probably ex-
 ploit its control over the
 means of communication between
 the Federal Republic and West
 Berlin to the fullest in an
 attempt to force West Germany
 and other countries to deal
 with it on a government level
 and thus gain some measure of
 recognition.   One possible move
 in this direction would be to
 require Western countries, in-
 cluding the United States, Brit-
 a i ri and France, to obtain East
 German permission for any means
 of nonmilitary transport to
 West Berlin.   Sweden and Den-
 mark have railroad connections
 into East Germany, and pressure
 may be brought on them in an
 attempt to get them into govern-
 ment-level negotiations.
 Air and Land Communications
 East Germany now possesses
 enough of the rights and func-
 tions of an independent state
 to be able to force Western
 countries to deal with it on
 certain problems.   Among these
 are sovereignty over its own
 air space, control over com-
 munications between the Federal
 Republic and West Berlin, and
 the power to issue visas to all
 The GDR has also obtained
 from the USSR the right to visa
 passports of all travelers en-
 tering its territory, with the
 exception of American, French,
 and British occupation offi-
 cials, who are given Soviet
 documentation.   Personnel of
 other Western military missions
 stationed in Berlin, however,
 are required to obtain East
 German visas.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The East Germans launched
 a trade offensive in the spring
 of 1954, and have since had per-
 manent official trade missions
 accepted by six countries--Fin-
 land, Egypt, Burma, Lebanon,
 Austria and India.  With the ex-
 ception of Austria, each of
 these countries has signed a
 government-level trade agree-
 ment.
 In addition, barter agree-
 ments have been concluded be-
 tween the East German state-
 owned foreign trade agency and
 semiofficial trading corpora-
 tions in many non-Communist
 countries.  East German trade
 delegations have visited many
 countries in all quarters of the
 globe in efforts to find new
 markets, especially in under-
 developed areas.
 East Germany has shown a
 willingness to exploit its trade
 with West Germany in the cam-
 paign to force recognition, even
 at some cost to its own economy.
 This willingness has been dem-
 onstrated by East Germany's
 maintenance of the toll on truck
 traffic to Berlin in the face
 of the Federal Republic's retal-
 iatory ;mbargo on some iron and
 steel products.
 Potentially, one of East
 Germany's most effective means
 of gaining international stature
 may be through participating in
 international organizations,
 although Western countries gen-
 erally have opposed its admis-
 sion, especially in cases where
 the West Germans have protested.
 Nevertheless, the GDR has al-
 ready taken the first steps in
 SECRET
 this direction, and can be ex-
 pected to persist in its efforts.
 Free World Stand on Recognition
 Three countries--Egypt,
 Finland, and Yugoslavia--are
 'Tn.own to be considering recog-
 nition.     Finland has already
 exchanged quasi-diplomatic rep-
 resentatives, the East German
 emissary in Helsinki having the    25X1
 authority to issue visas.
 Austrian officials feel
 their government should take
 a "neutral" approach to the
 separate Germanies by postponing
 establishment of formal relations
 with Bonn and recognition of the
 GDR.  They also say, however,
 that an East German offer to
 return Austrian property to Aus-
 tria would necessitate a "more
 tangible" response to current
 informal East German requests
 for closer relations.
 On the other hand,  37 non-
 Communist countries said they
 are not willing to recognize
 the East German regime.         The
 East Germans are probably real-
 istic enough,  therefore,                                                                  not to
 aspire to general recognition by
 the West in the foreseeable fu-
 ture, but they may hope to a-
 chieve a more or less official
 status by the establishment of

 SIGNS OF TROUBLE FOR THE COLOMBIAN DICTATORSHIP
 The regime of General Rojas
 Pinilla in Colombia faces an
 opposition which is growing in
 numbers and improving in organ-
 ization.  Although Rojas has,
 tried to organize mass support
 for his government, its backing
 comes almost solely from the
 armed forces, which are likely
 to turn against him if popular
 dissatisfaction continues to
 mount.
 When he overthrew Laureano
 Gomez in the June 1953 coup,
 Rojas was generally acclaimed
 by all but the Gomez faction
 of his own Conservative Party;
 and also by the other tradi-
 tional party, the Liberals.
 He was expected to bring a re-
 turn to constitutional govern-
 ment, probably through a Con-
 servative-Liberal coalition,
 and end the political violence
 that had plagued Colombia since
 the Bogota riots in 1948.
 Neither expectation has
 been realized.   Rojas, who
 styled his administration "The
 Government of the Armed Forces
 Constituent Assembly "elected"
 him president for four years
 and voted to continue itself in
 office for the same period, thus
 postponing general elections.
 Plenary sessions of the assembly
 have now been postponed indef-
 initely.   Rojas has made no move
 '-.o draw Conservative and Liberal
 Party leaders into the govern-
 ment .
 To silence political crit-
 icism, Rojas decreed a sweeping
 calumny law in October 1954 and
 later banned opposition radio
 commentaries while insisting on
 free radio time and sole tele-
 vision rights for government
 propaganda.   Shortly afterwards,
 the government formed a national
 publications board to control
 the import of newsprint and
 publish an official daily news-
 paper.  Finally on 3 August,
 the government closed the in-
 fluential Liberal daily El Tiempo,
 one  of Latin  America's best-
 known newspapers.   Although the
 original. censorship decree has
 been "lifted," a new "code of
 ethics" appears to have --t, net
 effect of greater stringency.
 after a few months began to move
 toward authoritarianism rather
 than the constitutional govern-
 ment which had prevailed for
 45 years.
 The traditional political
 parties, particularly the Lib-
 erals, became increasingly
 critical.   Rojas, meanwhile,
 attempted to build up an or-
 ga,nized mass following of his
 own.  His attempts to end guer-
 rilla activity by political and
 economic malcontents, which has
 upset the eastern and central
 parts of the country, have met
 with such little success that
 the majority of the armed forces
 is now engaged in efforts to
 maintain public order.
 Moves Toward Dictatorship
 Rojas has refused to lift
 the six-year-old state of siege.
 In August 1954 his hand-picked
 In the sphere of economic
 policy, the government has a-
 roused considerable opposition
 by its high expenditures on the
 armed forces and propaganda and
 intelligence services, and on
 costly projects such as the pro-
 posed new capital buildings.
 Although Colombia is presently
 enjoying relative prosperity,
 mainly because of good coffee
 exports, merchants are concerned
 over the regime's erratic im-
 port control policy, with its
 favors for the military estab-
 lishment and other official
 bodies.  There is also widespread
 criticism of the government's
 failure to implement promised
 social welfare measures.
 Search for Political Support

 ical support from either the

 Liberals or the Conservatives.
 Since the closing of El Tiempo,
 the Liberals have shown new
 party unity and shifted from
 "loyal" to complete opposition.
 The right-wing Gomez faction of
 the Conservative Party continues
 in opposition, and is now being
 joined by the more moderate Con-
 servatives under former president
 Ospina Perez.
 The president's attempt to
 build up a mass organization
 first took a fnrm reminiscent
 of Peron's build-up of the trade
 unions.   Early this year Rojas
 extended official recognition
 to a new labor group, the N,,.-
 tional Confederation of Workers
 (CNT), and tried to activate a
 government-sponsored national
 trade union council in a move
 to increase.state control over
 This attempt,
 however, would have
 subtracted strength
 from the Conservative
 Pasty and the dominant
 Union of Colombian
 Workers, both under
 strong clerical influ-
 ence, and so antag-
 onized the politically
 powerful Roman Catho-
 lic hierarchy.   Since,
 that time the church
 felt further affronted
 by government moves in
 the field of secondary
 education undertaken
 without sufficient con-
 sultation of the hier-
 archy.   As a result,
 a steady crystallization
 of church opposition
 to the government has
 taken place during the
 past year.
 These efforts to
 create public support having
 failed, the president and his
 followers attempted to inflate
 the president's son-in-law,
 Moreno Diaz, to a leading po-
 sition in the Conservative Par-
 ty.   Moreno's unpopularity is
 such, however, that success of
 this effort would further an-
 tagonize Conservative Party
 elements.   Rojas has already
 failed to elicit Conservative
 Party support for his closing
 of the.Liberal journal.
 Dependence on Armed Forces
 Although Rojas seems gen-
 erally unaware of the extent
 of popular dissatisfaction, he
 has come to depend more and
 more on the armed forces.  The

 AGRICULTURAL COLLECTIVIZATION IN SINO-SOVIET BLOC
 Drives to collectivize
 agriculture have been stepped
 up in Communist China and re-
 newed in the East European Sat-
 ellites during 1955.  The present
 campaign in China appears to be
 the direct result of a top-level
 party decision ner.sonally pre-
 sented by Mao Tse-tung, while the
 drive in Eastern Europe has prob-
 ab l y  .?esulted from a Soviet
 ruling that the relaxation of
 collectivization efforts per-
 mitted during the "new course"
 years of 1953 and 1954 is no
 longer to be tolerated.
 In both areas,  the programs
 now under way are utilizing
 propaganda and intimidation to
 induce peasants to co-operate,
 but are avoiding the force and
 physical violence characteristic
 of Soviet collectivization in
 the 1930's.
 Communist China
 An increased emphasis on
 collectivization has been evident
 in Communist China since the sum-
 mer of 1955.  According to cur-
 rent  Communist estimates, the
 proportion of peasants  in  ag-
 ricultural  producers' co-op-

 more direct control over agricul-

 Mao, in one of his rare
 public pronouncements, called
 on 31 July for a, speed-up of
 rural socialization and an end
 to "conservative and indecisive
 attitudes" among party members.
 Mao asked that the co-operative,
 movement include half of China's
 500,000,000 farm population by
 early 1958.   Subsequent changes
 in regional plans,attributed to
 Mao's urging, advanced this goal
 a year.
 Intense political and
 economic discrimination against
 individual farmers in recent
 months makes them afraid not
 to join co-operatives.   In
 particular, the campaign against
 counterrevolutionaries has
 intimidated all peasants and
 terrorized the rich and upper
 middle-class peasants, who will
 be treated by Peiping as bit-

 Peiping's immediate eco-

 The higher-than-av-

 for by their prefer-

 In view of the
 disruptive economic
 effects of rapid
 collectivization and Peiping's
 refusal to allocate investment
 funds to support plans for sub-
 stantially expanding agricul-

 few years, there is little

 In June and July 1955,.
 several Satellite regimes
 sharply stepped up propaganda
 urging agricultural socializa-

 and Czech party first secretary
 Novotny implied that harsh
 measures would be instituted
 to make the collectivized sec-
 tor predominant by 1960.   The
 Polish and Bulgarian regimes
 also delineated policies of
 expanding collectivization,
 albeit on a more modest scale.

 that the percentage of arable

 land controlled by the collec-

 from 35 to 33 percent since
 January, the government empha-

 oci,als.
 The decision to press
 ' lectiviza.tion was made
 several months before the
 outcome of the current harvest
 661ld be known by the Satellite
 regimes.   It was undoubtedly
 a political decision motivated
 by the need to re-emphasize
 the regimes' socialist goals
 in reaction to the stress of
 the "new course" on current
 production at the expense of.
 co]Llectiviza.tion.   The relative
 satisfaction of the Satellites
 with the 1955 bread grain, root
 and vegetable harvests will
 contribute to their willingness
 to continue to push the pro-
 gram during the next year..
 Current indications are,
 however, that collectivization
 will proceed without the harsh
 measures implied in the June
 pronouncements of the Hungarian
 and Czech leaders.   Since early
 August, the Czechoslovak regime
 has refrained from repeating
 its threats to appropriate
 land for collectives despite
 its apparent failure to expand
 the socialized sector signifi-
 cantly.   The Hungarian party

 local cadres against excessive
 zeal in collectivizing.
