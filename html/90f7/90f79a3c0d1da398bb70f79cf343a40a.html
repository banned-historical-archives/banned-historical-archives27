 FOREIGN BROADCAST INFORMATION SERVICE
 HONG KONG BUREAU
 MH K-60 x:03
 4 March  1986
 MEMORANDUM FOR:   Director, Foreign Broadcast Information Service
 THROUGH          . Chief, Operations Group
 SUBJECT          . Monthly Report--Hong Kong Bureau--February 1986
 A.  My recent Monthly Reports have highlighted our preoccupation with
 the Philippines;  February, with its controversial climax to the
 presidential  election and the military--inspired ousting of  Marcos,  was a
 different matter altogether.   We came close to being completely consumed
 by it all.     The tentative lull  that followed the official  proclaiming of  a
 Marcos' victory was shattered the evening of the 22d when AFF' reported
 that troops had occupied the Defense Ministry and Defense Minister Enrile
 was to be arrested.   Thus began 6 days of round-the-clock operations and
 an exhausting,  frustrating effort to cover radios which were being blown
 off the air and which, even in good times, are often unmonitorable.
 Bureau staff,  many of whom were already weary from the months-long
 Philippines coverage effort,  responded admirably,  quickly adjusting work
 schedules and putting  in  long hours,  some with  little or no sleep the
 first few days.    The celebrating that took place throughout the
 Philippines after Marcos fled was duplicated  in the bureau,  everyone
 fervently hoping that the situation would return to something close to
 normal.  (See Section II,  Monitorial/Editorial,   for more details?)
 We had another record monthly output on the Philippines:  548,990
 publishable words from Philippine radio/press, AFP, and Beijing Tagalog.
 Total  bureau production for the month was  1,266,730,  which with a short
 month amounted to a daily output not much below last month's record  1.44
 million words.
 B.  The Consulate has provided tentative estimates of  what  it will
 cost each agency when all  employees are housed in the new Shousan Hills
 and Bonham Road apartment complexes.   The 30-plus apartments at Shousan
 Hills,  located on the backside of Hong Kong Island and overlooking Deep
 Water Bay,  are nearly all occupied;  the Bonham Road building,  which  is now
 due for completion late this year, will house the remaining 90-plus
 families attached to the Consulate.   The Bonham Road apartment  is located
 about a mile west of  the Consulate near the University of Hong Kong.
 A bit of background for those unfamiliar with all this:     State, with
 agreement from all  the attached agencies,  decided  in the early 1980's to
 purchase quarters to accommodate all  families.    This was done at a time
 when rental costs were increasing dramatically each year and it was felt

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/21 : CIA-RDP87-01104R000100050011-5
 buying would ultimately save the government money.   Unfortunately, this
 has now become a dubious assumption,  or at least less certain than when
 the decision was made some years back.   Moreover, the security aspect of
 having so many people all  housed  in one building was not a  major
 consideration then,  as it is now.   On top of  all  this,  both buildings have
 been surrounded by controversy:    Shouson was nearly      years late in
 opening due to faulty construction and legal    disputes with the
 contractor;   Bonham is also behind schedule, but that is far less concern
 than the building itself,  which  is considered  inadequate for American
 families.   The complaints center around the small    size of  the apartments,
 the location of  the building,  and the absence of  amenities  (there is to be
 a swimming pool, but shared with families who will be living in a twin
 tower).
 But there now seems little that can be done about any of this.   The
 Consul  General told a recent Country Team session that the Department was
 seeing if there was any legal way out of the Bonham venture.      But this
 seems very unlikely.   That being the case, people would have to be
 assigned to Bonham.   He emphasized that he did not want section or  agency
 chiefs trying to persuade him that their employees should not be assigned
 to Bonham.   The only exception would be families with too many children to
 be accommodated in the number of bedrooms available, plus section/agency
 heads who would remain  in privately-leased,  representational-size
 apartments.
 The plan  is that each agency will  pay a certain percentage of  the
 annual cost of purchasi rig the building, based on the number of families.
 The cost per family,  inclusive of  management fees and utilities,  is
 extimated to be US$42,000 per year initially.   This will  increase each 2
 years by about  19%.  The building  is to be paid off  after  10 years and the
 annual  "rental"  charge will  then be discontinued.   While this appears at
 first glance to be a sizeable increase over what we are presently paying
 per year for our privately-leased apartments, over     10 years the total
 outlay is in  line with what we project paying for current quarters at a
 10% per year increase in rental  and utility costs.   We will  provide
 further information on all of this as it becomes available.
 A. Monitorial/Editorial
 1.  The events of  February which led to the overthrow of Marcos
 are now history?  the 7 February presidential  election;  the inconclusive,
 then disputed results;  calls for civil  disobedience by the opposition and
 church;  the U.S. Government's involvement highlighted by the Habib visit;
 Aquino's efforts to challenge the Batasan declaration of    a Marcos victory;
 the Enr i l e-Ramos break with Marcos;   the dual  inaugurations of both Marcos
 and Aquino;   the standoff at. Camps Aguinaldo and Crame and the  "people
 power" demonstrations throughout greater Manila;   the flight of Marcos and
 the fall  of  Malacanang Palace;  and finally,  Cory Aquino's ascendancy.
 The bureau's efforts to report on all  these and the many related
 events throughout the month are also now pretty much a part of    the record.
 What happened the evening of  the 22d came as no surprise,  as much as we

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/21 : CIA-RDP87-01104R000100050011-5
 had hoped for  a period of  quiet.   As we had done for the two previous
 Saturdays in order to handle speeches and other developments,  the bureau
 extended  its operating hours as it started to become apparent that
 something serious was going on.   By late evening,  the
 bureau chief
 associate editor            Tagalog monitor  and teletypist
 had re ort    for   u y  .o assist and relieve the beleaguered team of
 and tel etypi st    most of                       whom had been on
 duty since  0800  that morning.
 In the first highly-charged hours,  Marcos made two broadcast
 statements accusing the     "rebels"  of  planning to assassinate him and  Imelda
 and to carry out a coup.   Meanwhile,  Radio Veritas was broadcasting
 interviews with Enril.e and Ramos, in which they explained their reasons
 for  turning against Marcos, and an appeal      by Cardinal  Sin for Filipinos to
 support the move against Marcos.   Amidst all  this were the reports of
 people flooding  into the streets and around Camp Aguinaldo to prevent the
 military from attacking.           By early morning it was clear that there would
 be no quick solution to the crisis and the bureau geared up for  indefinite
 round-the-clock operations which,  as it turned out,  lasted for 6 days.
 The bureau's reporting on the crisis was severely hampered after the
 first day as the few stations moni t.orab l e at Hong Kong started going off
 the air.   By Tuesday both Radio Veritas and the government MBS radio had
 ceased broadcasting due to damage to transmitters and broadcast facilities
 by hostile forces.   That  left only FEBC and an unidentified radio
 broadcasting on single sideband on a non-public broadcasting frequency
 (7045 KHZ).   We learned of  this station from USIS,  who in turn had been
 tipped off by a DXer in Macau.   Apparently a military transmitter run by
 forces sympathetic to the Enri.le-Ramos movement,  it was manned by various
 announcers and moderators who made frequent public service announcements
 and appeals to the public to gather  at Camps Agui nal do and Crame and
 around Channel 4 television facilities  (by then in the hands of pro-Aquino
 forces).   There were frequent called-in reports from  "mobile units''
 reporting on the situation around the military camps and Manila in
 general.   Though the transmitter's public broadcasting status was
 ambigious, given the value of the information being reported we chose to
 file the materials obtained openly  to  consumers.   On instructions from MOD
 later in the week, we began treating the take from this station as OUO.  By
 the end of  the week and as the situation began to calm down following the
 departure of Marcos, two new radios were being heard, both on old MBS
 frequencies:  Radyo Ng Bayan  (Radio of  the Nation)  and DZFM Radio.  Toward
 the end of the week Radio Veritas had been heard again, also using an MBS
 frequency temporarily and announcing that  it would return to its own
 facilities and frequency on Monday,  the 3d.     However, the station has not
 been heard again as of  today.  Coverage of the crisis was also hampered by
 the lack of newspapers from Manila.     With Manila's International Airport
 closed for several  days and no flights to Hong Kong,  we were left without
 papers until  Wednesday,  the 26th.

 As with all  ex  post facto reviews of  a crisis,  we can see where we
 might have done things a little differently or better were we to do it
 again.   But I don't think we could have asked for any more effort or
 dedication than what we received from our staff.   Everyone contributed.
 If  I   had to  single out any one individual   performance it would have been
 that of                           manned the radio room for upwards of  16 hours a   STAT

 day the first several  days.   With no in-house cruising or radio room
 personnel  to assist,         almost si.nglehandedly kept the editors informed  STAT
 as to what was happening with all  the radios.   His knowledge and
 experience from handling the Philippine radios over the years proved
 invaluable;  we would have floundered without him.   The assistance we
 received from Bangkok and Okinawa was most helpful,   as was the
 encouragement and praise from Headquarters and the BBC.
 2. The bureau filed several flash/immediate reports from AFP on
 the assassination of  Swedish Prime Minister Olaf  Palme,  two of  which were
 run on the Wire.
 In China,  PRC media covered here reported that Deng  Xiaoping
 had reappeared in his home town in Sichuan Province following another
 lengthy absence.   The PRC reacted for the first time to the Larry Chin
 case,  a Foreign Ministry spokesman denying that China had any links with
 Chin.   And  in Shanghai,  sons of  several  leading party officials were
 sentenced to death for having committed rape and other crimes over a
 number of  years.
 4.  Two new publications were added to the bureau's coverage
 during the month:  the PRC journal  QUN YAN  (Popular Journal)  and the
 Philippine DAILY ENQUIRER, the latter still  being received intermittently.
 B.  Lateral  Services
 We received two requests for special  servicing on the
 Philippines;  one we responded to, the other was overtaken by events.
 Twice during the month we were asked by Seoul       Bureau to file priority and
 above items on the Philippines to the embassy in Seoul.   The day before
 the crisis erupted, we were asked by the embassy in Manila to file reports
 of Cary Aquino's daily program on Radio Veritas for the attention of the
 ambassador.   The bureau had processed only one of  her programs,  which were
 reportedly discontinued after several  days.
 C.  Communications
 We had a number of  outages during the month.   Fortunately most
 were of short duration and did not occur during the height of  the crisis
 or  at other  key times during the month. We had one lengthy outage on the
 4th which was due to computer problems at Clark RRF and a series of  in-out
 periods on 8 and 9 February.
 D.  Ter_hnical
 1.     Our new microwave  (Megamux)  backup system,  using Hong Kong
 Telephone circuits and digitized terminal equipment, was made available
 for on line testing as of the 18th.     We have been running the system
 parallel  with the microwave except for several  days during the Philippines
 crisis when we left it on microwave to insure that we would have no
 problems.   We have had several  outages on the Megamux system so far but it
 appears that these are only teething problems,  or so we hope.   Another

 problem developed over the weekend which has been traced to a telephone
 line outage somewhere between Wanchai  and Mt.  Butler.   The telephone
 company is working on this presently.    Testing will resume once this
 problem is sorted out.
 2.  AFF''s local  office advised during the month that our service
 will  be upgraded to 300 baud,  probably in April  or May.   We plan to lease
 a new printer from Cable  & Wireless and they will carry out the
 installation and hookup of          the new service.
 In January,)               (carried out a minisurvey of  Philippine
 radios from other locations around Hong Kong Island.   He used a Sony
 2001-D portable receiver and Mt.  Butler as a reference point.  He found
 reception at Mt.  Butler was better than at any of  the three locations he
 checked.   Checks of other locations were put aside for now due to our
 current preoccupation with the Philippines and presumption,  based on the
 other checks,  that Mt.  Butler remains the best monitoring site.
