 August 16, 1965          CONGRESSIONAL. RE  R          -
 in a different world and on borrowed
 time.
 I not only introduce the legislation; I
 support it and trust that the Ways and
 Means Committee will open hearings
 during the present session or during the
 recess.  We must act before those who
 have little sympathy for our industry go
 to  the  extremes  now  contemplated,
 namely, a 50-percent tariff cut across the
 board withy -or eptions.
 SETTIN    H _      CORD STRAIGH
 The SPEAKER. Under previous or-
 der of the House, the gentleman from
 New York [Mr. ROSENTHAL]  is recog-
 nized for 60 minutes.
 Mr. ROSENTHAL.  Mr. Speaker, it is
 with considerable regret and a heavy
 heart that I take this time this afternoon
 but I do so on a matter of great im-
 portance, in my judgment, both to the
 House of Representatives and certainly
 to myself.
 On last Thursday the gentleman from
 Ohio  [Mr. HAYS] made some remarks
 which I think were probably among the
 most serious ever made by one Member
 against another Member in the history
 of this body.
 The United Press of that day reported
 as follows :
 WASHINGTON.-Representative  WAYNE   L.
 HAYS, Democrat, of Ohio, said today current
 unofficial hearings at which Congressmen
 have been soliciting views on Vietnam are
 giving "aid and comfort" to the Communists.
 HAYS in a House speech directed his critical
 remarks particularly at Representative BEN-
 JAMIN S. ROSENTHAL, Democrat, of New York,
 one of several Members who have conducted
 such informal sessions.
 HAYS said the sessions have provided a
 forum for "crackpots" to air their views in
 opposition to U.S. participation in the Viet-
 nam fighting.  He said ROSENTHAL had been
 "helping the Communists" by holding such
 meetings.  "He's giving aid and comfort to
 them," he said.
 The dispatch continued:
 HAYS' remarks were prompted by a state-
 ment          by         ROSENTHAL   on  another  issue.
 ROSENTHAL had told the House U.N. Ambas-
 sador Arthur J. Goldberg, according to press
 reports, would announce shortly a more flex-
 ible U.S. policy toward Russia's nonpayment
 of V.N. peacekeeping assessments.
 HAYS said  he  doubted  that  ROSENTHAL
 knew, since the matter was still under study,
 and that anyway  ROSENTHAL  was helping
 Russia by suggesting to Russia in advance
 that she need not make further concessions
 in this U.N. dispute.
 He said ROSENTHAL was "aiding the Com-
 munists" in this case "just as he has been
 helping the Communists  in  Vietnam" by
 holding  meetings  on  Vietnam.  He  said
 ROSENTHAL  had   been incorrectly implying
 that the hearings were sponsored by the For-
 eign Affairs members.
 For the attention of those Members
 who have not had the opportunity to
 read these remarks in the RECORD, they
 appear at page 19607 of the RECORD of
 August 12, 1965.
 It seems to me that when one Member
 accuses another Member of aiding the
 Communists and giving aid and comfort
 to the Communists, he is bordering on
 the charge that the other Member is
 guilty of treason.  This, I believe, is a
 very serious charge and must be an-
 swered in its entirety, not only by my-
 self by by other interested parties.
 Frankly, when the gentleman from
 Ohio made his remarks, I was rather
 taken aback and shocked.  My subse-
 quent reaction was one of hurt, because
 Mr. HAYS is the chairman of my sub-
 committee on State Department Affairs.
 He is, in my judgment, a respected Mem-
 ber of the House, a man for whom I have
 considerable respect and even admira-
 tion, a man with whom I have had the
 0leasure of having lunch at the same
 't'able in the House restaurant perhaps
 100 times since I have been in Congress,
 and a man who has done me a number of
 personal favors.  Only within the last
 week or two he did something for which
 I was very grateful to him. Thus; when
 he made these very serious charges, I
 wondered if perhaps there was not some-
 thing wrong with me-if there was not
 something I had done directly to Mr.
 HAYS to cause him to make what I believe
 is probably one of the most serious
 charges ever made in this Chamber.
 At the time of the incident, I could
 have, as all Members know, risen to a
 point of order and asked that his words
 be taken down.  At that point had the
 Speaker ruled in my favor, the words and
 Mr. HAYS' remarks would have been re-
 moved from the body of the RECORD.
 But the damage would have been done in
 the press.  It was my immediate judg-
 ment, whether. good or bad, that it would
 be better to face the entire issue, and
 better to face the remarks so that we
 might all reflect on them at some other
 time rather than have the matter dis-
 posed of at the moment.
 I was at a loss to explain Mr. HAYS'
 attack. Yet I knew he must have realized
 that anything he said, one Democrat
 against another, would carry very, very
 serious political implications.  When I
 had thoroughly exhausted the possibil-
 ities of my behavior having caused his
 remarks, I then began to wonder about
 him. Of course, I had no basis for any
 personal feelings for him other than re-
 spect and admiration and, a modest
 degree of affection. I then waited until
 the next day, until the newspapers re-
 ported the incident. I should be honest
 and tell you I had hoped there would be
 little press reaction.  But in the Long
 Island Press of Friday, August 13, which
 is the most important paper in my dis-
 trict, there appeared a headline in about
 1-inch type which said, "Abet the Com-
 mies?  Absurd:  ROSENTHAL."  In other
 words, while I did have a chance to make
 a response, the attack had put me com-
 pletely on the defensive.
 New York Times of Friday, August 13,
 1965, carried the first half of the UPI
 story. But they carried the charge and
 not my response.  They said as follows:
 Representative WAYNE L. HAYS, Democrat,
 of Ohio, said today that unofficial hearings
 at which Congressmen had been soliciting
 views on Vietnam were giving "aid and com-
 fort" to the Communists.
 Mr. HAYS, in a House speech, directed his
 critical remarks particularly at Representa-
 tive BENJAMIN S. ROSENTHAL, Democrat, of
 Queens, one of several members who have
 conducted the informal sessions.
 Mr. HAYS said the hearings had provided
 a forum for "crackpots" to air their views in
 opposition to U.S. participation in the Viet-
 19735
 nam fighting.  He said Mr.-ROSENTHAL had
 been "helping the Communists" by holding
 such meetings.
 And the New York Daily News of the
 same day, Friday, August 13, 1965, car-
 ried the story which said in the head-
 line, "L.B.J. Supports Lodge on Viet-
 nam," but, in the bottom of the story,
 recorded the same essential charge that
 I was giving aid and comfort to the Com-
 munists.
 It was then that I realized the matter
 had to be faced directly, then that I was
 obliged to look at what Mr. HAYS had said
 in the past remarks on the floor of the
 House, then that I sought to discover
 whether he had ever questioned the in-
 tegrity of other Members of Congress.
 I supposed if I could find some clue along
 these lines, I might then find the answer
 as to why he chose to attack me.
 I was particularly surprised at one of
 the gentlemen's statements, made on Oc-
 tober 31, 1963, on page 20679 of the REC-
 ORD, where Mr. HAYS said:
 Mr. Speaker, I have been reading in the
 press  about  various  people  being  called
 pinkies, Communists, and what-have-you by
 other Members of the House.    I have never
 stooped to calling anybody a Communist or
 any other vile name, but I would point out,
 having some knowledge of communism, that
 one of the Communists' chief tricks and one
 of their chief tactics, as well as the Nazi
 murderers'  principal  tactics,  was  to  call
 somebody they disagreed with a dirty name
 such as a Communist or for a Communist
 to call someone a Nazi.  I wonder if those
 who play this game should not be suspect
 as. to their own political philosophies?    In
 other words, the big lie technique.
 Given the quality of his attack on me,
 I was puzzled by.the very tolerant senti-
 ments of that particular statement.
 I continued looking at other com-
 ments and came across one which indi-
 cated another saddening tactic-the old
 charge of guilt by association. This oc-
 curred on June 7, 1957, on page 8533,
 where Mr. HAYS said as follows:
 I have always been told if you have evi-
 dence introduced-I am not an attorney, so
 I am trying in my feeble way to refute this-
 if you have evidence introduced, you con-
 sider  from  whence  this  evidence  comes.
 Since Mr. PowELL is the sole source of this
 statement and since Mr. POWELL has made
 this accusation against Members from Penn-
 sylvania and Ohio, maybe we should con-
 sider some of his previous statements.  Why
 he made this accusation I do not know. I
 suppose that is as hard to explain as it
 would be to explain why he appeared with
 Earl Browder and William Z. Foster at a joint
 rally of the Communist Party in Madison
 Square Garden in 1944 and shared top bill-
 ing with those two.  Or it might be as hard
 to explain why he was the editor of a news-
 paper and the author of a column in which
 he one time identified the New York Times
 as "a Salsberger journal of first-class Negro
 baiters."
 I have heard the New York Times called
 just the opposite on this floor by many more
 people than the gentleman from New York,
 Mr. POWELL.  Or why when one time, when
 the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Texas,
 Mr. Dies, had the temerity to summon one
 of the columnists of Mr. POWELL's newspaper
 before his Committee on Un-American Ac-
 tivities, the Reverend Mr. POWELL wrote, "The
 sooner Dies is buried, the better."  And he
 goes on quoting a lot of other trash that I
 will not quote because I do not want it to
 appear in the RECORD.

 Approved For Release 2003/10/14: CIA-RDP67B00446R000300130013-1
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE          August 16, 1965
 He [Mr. Powm[.] winds up by saying, "The
 death of Dies Is just as Important as the
 death of Hitler." Well, Mr. Dies is here, full
 of vim, vigor, and vitality, I am happy to
 say.  So that wish of the reverend gentle-
 man from New York had no more reason
 that his dishonest statement against Mem-
 bers of Congress from Pennsylvania and
 Ohio.
 Mr. HAYS seems to have been par-
 ticularly worried about other Members'
 attitudes toward communism.  In ex-
 change with Mr. CURTIS, of Missouri, on
 page 4305, March 15, 1962, the gentle-
 man from Ohio said this:
 Mr. HAYS. I would just like to say to the
 gentleman who is interested in fighting com-
 munism that in my opinion each one of us
 who fights down here in the well by doing a
 lot'of talking is not doing any effective fight-
 ing like some of us do back in the pre-
 cincts.
 Such matters, as we all know, are po-
 litically very delicate.  They deserve re-
 straint and caution. But so do any re-
 marks made by Members about fellow
 Democrats. This is why I was disturbed
 by remarks by the gentlemen on page
 6540, of the RECORD of April 18, 1965:
 Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should say this
 about the great golfing Governor of Ohio-
 Incidentally,  the  Governor  was  a
 Democrat, just as I am.
 the Governor of Ohio who reputedly shoots
 a lower score than the President and who
 has through his  opposition to adequate
 financing tried to ruin the school system of
 Ohio and who in his tenure as Governor has
 permitted Ohio's highways to deteriorate
 until they are among the worst in the
 Nation.  Knowing him as I do, perhaps I
 should say in my opinion, he would have
 kicked the farmers of the Nation in the
 teeth before he teed off on the first hole;
 he wouldn't have waited to have a conference
 in the golf shop on the ninth hole.
 I have found, to continue, that I was
 not the first to take time to respond to
 charges made by Mr. HAYS.  On page
 21103, September 27, 1962, Mr. Alger, of
 Texas, had the following to say:
 Mr. Speaker, I am happy to report to the
 House that the statement made yesterday by
 the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. HAYS, in which
 the gentleman from Texas now addressing the
 House and the gentleman from New York,
 Mr. Pillion,; were mentioned, I have been
 assured privately, in no sense was intended
 to be derogatory, that we would be slow to
 hit the beaches with the gentleman from
 Ohio in case we ever, God forbid, became
 engaged In combat.  I understand that no
 such implication was intended either in that
 part that was added under permission to
 revise. which we did not hear on the floor.
 That a Member of this body had seen
 fit to question the courage of his fellows,
 apparently to deny it later-all this
 seemed to me deeply puzzling.  Yet there
 were other unexplainable incidents.  On
 January 17, 1963, page 542 of the RECORD,
 appears the following:
 Mr. HAYS.  Mr. Speaker, I listened with
 a good deal of interest to a great part of the
 speech which was made by the chairman of
 the Committee on Appropriations, the gentle-
 man from Missouri, Mr. Cannon.  I am sure
 all of us are concerned about the debt,  But
 I might say in the 14 years I have been here
 I have never been before the Committee on
 Appropriations one single time and asked
 them for one single appropriation.  But I
 would have been a lot more impressed still
 If I had not been around here last year and
 had seen the spectacle of the light for pres-
 tige that went on and a considerable number
 of weeks of the time of the Congress and the
 country wasted.  I would have been more
 impressed if the chairman would have de-
 voted himself at that point to trying to
 reduce the debt instead of trying to increase
 his own prestige.
 Is there not a better way to conduct
 the discourse of politics, regardless of
 how strong one's sentiments?
 Mr. Speaker, other Members have
 taken special orders to respond to Mr.
 HAYS before with reference to his ac-
 cusations,  One such example was May
 18, 1961, at page 8405 of the RECORD
 when the distinguished gentleman from
 Iowa, Mr. Schwengel, had the following
 to say:
 Mr. SCHWENGEL. Mr. Speaker, on occasions,
 Members of the House get carried away or
 for some reason become careless with their
 thinking and speech and in the process re-
 flect upon the good character and record
 of distinguished public servants and private
 individuals in our country.
 This, in my opinion, was the case, Mr.
 Speaker, when the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.
 HAYS], referred to a very dear friend of mine
 and a friend of thousands of people in Iowa
 as a broken-down politician during a col-
 loquy on the House floor when we were dis-
 cussing some matters that had little rela-
 tionship, if any, to people like Mr. Whitney
 Gillilland of whom the gentleman from Ohio
 spoke when he said, I quote:
 "If they cannot find a Kennedy, maybe they
 can find a broken-down politician from Iowa
 like Gillilland that Eisenhower put on the
 CAB,"
 Is such an approach really necessary?
 Does it fit the traditions of this body?
 Mr. Speaker, I also discovered that
 both Senators from Ohio had felt the
 sting of Mr. HAYS' tongue.  Perhaps this
 was State politics.  However, in my case
 I really cannot understand how there
 would be any political motivation by
 making remarks that would apparently
 increase the chances of my not being
 returned to this body.
 Yet Mr. HAYS had been active in Ohio.
 On November 12, 1963, at page 21578,
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio said the following:
 This article by Tom Talburt, Washington
 correspondent for the Scripps-Howard news-
 papers, contains the following specific state-
 ments made by Representative HAYS:
 "Congressman WAYNE HAYS, Democrat, of
 Ohio, says he understands why both of Ohio's
 Democratic Senators oppose a congressional
 pay raise. He says they're not worth It.
 "HAYS, who's backing a proposed pay boost,
 said he'll offer an amendment to pay legis-
 lators                                                                       on  a  sliding  scale  from  $5,000 to
 $35,000 a year and let each Member decide
 for himself how much he is worth.
 "'If  my  amendment  passes  and  either
 Ohio  Senator says he's worth more  than
 $5,000, he could be tried for perjury,' snapped
 HAYS.
 "After placing rather dubious prices on
 the heads of Senators FEANx LAIISCHE and
 STEPHErr YOUNG, HAYS was asked to evaluate
 his own performance.
 "'I'm worth the maximum,' he declared."
 I am not pleased with such remarks.
 I am not happy to have to bring them to
 the attention of the House.  But I have
 been attacked, and made vulnerable to
 serious political charges at home. That
 I am obliged to defend myself is not my
 fault.  And this is why I am taking the
 time of the House today.
 Mr. Speaker, other examples, some
 more pungent and some less pungent, of
 the gentleman from Ohio's habits of
 political discourse.  But perhaps Mr.
 HAYS himself summed up his own style
 when on May 24, 1950, at page 7636 of the
 RECORD of the House, Mr. HAYS, of Ohio,
 said as follows:
 Mr. HAYS. Mr. Speaker, I also recognize
 that the statement which I inserted is a
 technical violation of the rules.  The re-
 marks which were made were not, in my
 opinion, particularly offensive to the gentle-
 man in the other body, and I might say, not
 anywhere near as offensive, not one-tenth
 of 1 percent as offensive as some statements
 I have made from the public platform with-
 out congressional immunity about the afore-
 mentioned  gentleman.  With  that  state-
 ment, I ask unanimous consent that the
 remarks be withdrawn.
 Mr. Speaker, I have neither the expe-
 rience nor the training to understand
 why there are times when the gentleman
 from Ohio chooses to say unexpectedly
 critical things about other Members.
 And sometimes they have been almost
 as serious as the one he said about me.
 What, then, Mr. Speaker, did he charge
 me with?  He charges[ me with three
 things: He charged me with breaching
 and violating the security of the briefing
 given by Ambassador Goldberg to the
 House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and
 of announcing in advance what this
 country's position is in regard to the
 United Nations.  He then charged me
 with giving aid to the Communists by
 holding public hearings in my district.
 And he charged me with being mislead-
 ing in suggesting that these hearings had
 the official sanction of the House.
 With regard to the first citation, the
 briefing held by the committee, I would
 like to advise you, Mr. Speaker, this was
 not the first occasion on which Mr. HAYS
 has charged a Member of the House with
 violating security.
 On October 23, 1964, he charged the
 gentleman from Delaware [Mr. McDoW-
 ELLI with probably the "biggest intelli-
 gence break that Peiping has had vis-a-
 vis the United States." And he also said
 he hoped the people of Delaware would
 take cognizance of the action of Mc-
 DOWELL in breaking American security.
 Is this proper politics between Demo-
 cratic colleagues?
 What I read to you is a direct quote
 from the Wilmington Evening Journal
 of October 23, 1964:
 Mr. McDowELL, in response to Mr. HAYS'
 accusation,  said,  "The insinuation that I
 broke any security regulation is completely
 false."
 HAYS said "McDOWELL'S remarks were of
 unquestionable and inestimable value to the
 Chinese Communists."
 Mr. McDOWELL said he could not un-
 derstand Mr. HAYS' reaction.  He said
 any one of the U.S. methods of surveil-
 lance have been fully available to the
 public press for several months.
 So I was not the first Democrat charged
 by Mr. HAYS with breach. of security. In
 any case, the charge against me was
 quite without foundation.
 In the RECORD of August 12, 1965, I be-
 gan my remarks by saying:
 Mr. Speaker, on next Monday it is reported,
 Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg will  an-

 pounce a more flexible American position on
 peacekeeping-
 And in the next to the last paragraph
 I stated:
 if this is to be the substance of Am-
 bassador Goldberg's speech to the 33-nation
 committee on United Nations finance, then
 I am anxious to register my highest regard
 for such enlightened policy.   v
 I inserted in the RECORD at that point
 a New York Times editorial of that morn-
 ing, August 12 which said:
 Washington's plan to announce a more
 flexible position on peacekeeping assessments
 may prove a lifesaver for the United Nations.
 . The editorial goes on to discuss the
 United States proposal for a new ap-
 proach to peacekeeping assessments.
 With regard to the United Nations, on
 August 11, 1965, a New York Times car-
 ried a story under the byline of Richard
 Eder. The headline, says, "End of U.S.
 Fight on U.N. Dues Seen."  Below that,
 "Goldberg Is Reported Ready To An-
 nounce Policy Shift."
 The Washington Star headline of
 August 10 stated, "U.S. To Abandon Fight
 for Soviet U.N. Dues."  And immediately
 under, a subheading, "Goldberg Monday
 Will Agree To Scrap Article 19 for Con-
 tribution Device."
 A United Press dispatch appearing
 that morning before the House met
 reads as follows:
 As it stood, before the last-minute hitch
 yesterday, the administration planned to
 make an announcement in New York Mon-
 day to this effect:
 The United States still holds to its legal
 view that the U.N. Charter means what it
 says.
 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
 to insert this dispatch in the RECORD at
 this point, together with the other news-
 paper stories I referred to.
 The SPEAKER. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from New
 York?
 There was no objection.
 The matters referred to follow:
 UPI RELEASE
 As it stood, before the last-minute hitch
 yesterday,  the            administration planned to
 make an announcement in New York Mon-
 day to this effect:
 The United States still holds to its legal
 view that the U.N. Charter means what it
 says, that "the expenses of the organization
 shall be borne by the members as appor-
 tioned by the General Assembly," and that,
 under article 19, a member more than 2 years
 in arrears "shall have no vote."
 However, if the U.N. membership is unwill-
 ing to enforce article 19 the United States
 will go along, but will regard its own pay-
 ments  as  voluntary  contributions  rather
 than mandatory.
 This would be a major U.S. shift. On Oc-
 tober 8, 1964, the United States submitted a
 memorandum to the United Nations saying
 that failure to enforce article 19 would
 "undermine the constitutional integrity" of
 the world organization.
 The memorandum said such a view would
 be a repudiation of the International Court
 of Justice, which ruled in 1962 that assess-
 ments are mandatory, and would "tempt
 members to pick and choose" which U.N.
 obligations they would fulfill.
 "How could any organization function on
 such a fiscal quicksand?" the memorandum
 asked.
 What brought about the U.S. change was
 a realization that the U.N. membership was
 not prepared to enforce article 19.  The or-
 ganization has virtually paralyzed itself for
 the past year by suspending voting in order
 to avoid a showdown.
 Administration officials were well aware
 their move would be seen by some critics as
 a U.S. "surrender."  Representative H. R.
 GROSS, Republican, of Iowa, said after a
 Goldberg briefing yesterday that the United
 States was getting ready to "tuck its tail be-
 tween its legs."
 But the administration argues that it is
 better to slide around a legal point than to
 see the United Nations paralyzed for still an-
 other year.  As one U.S. diplomat put it: "All
 those legal opinions we wrote a year ago are
 still true. But this has become a matter of
 practical politics."
 The move would be significant in U.N. his-
 tory.  Under the charter, an assessment of
 expenses on members was the only so-called
 mandatory power  given  the  General  As-
 sembly.
 UNITED STATES To ABANDON FIGHT FOR SOVIET
 U.N. DUES-GOLDBERG MONDAY WILL AGREE
 To SCRAP ARTICLE  19 FOR "CONTRIBUTION"
 DEVICE
 (By William R. Frye)
 UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.-Next Monday, the
 United States plans to abandon its long fight
 to force Russia to pay her United Nations
 dues, it has been learned here.  Russia then
 is expected to make a "voluntary" contribu-
 tion in September or October.
 Defeat for Washington on the Russian-
 dues issue has been considered inevitable for
 months.  U.N. diplomats long have known
 the United States did not have the votes to
 put the squeeze on the Kremlin, requiring
 payment or taking away Russia's voting
 rights.
 Next Monday,  U.S. Delegate  Arthur  J.
 Goldberg will  bow  publicly  out  of the
 effort, according to the present plans. He
 will agree to shelve article 19 of the U.N.
 Charter, which says countries 2 years in ar-
 rears shall have no vote in the General As-
 sembly.
 After the Russians have, cast several votes
 in the 1965 Assembly, which meets in Sep-
 tember, they are expected to make a "volun-
 tary" contribution that will be "substantial"
 but much less than the $62 million they owe.
 Thereafter the United States, too, is ex-
 pected to contribute to a "save the U.N."
 fund and other countries will do the same,
 In the hope of erasing a $108 million U.N.
 deficit.
 In addition, however, the U.N. must pay
 off some $180 million in bonds floated to pay
 for peace operations in the Congo and Mid-
 east.  Russia has refused to pay her share
 toward amortizing this debt.
 The Johnson administration's decision to
 swallow defeat came after long and careful
 consultation ? ? ? which felt that the over-
 riding time an explosion of indignation was
 feared.
 The  danger  apparently  was  overrated.
 Sources say there proved to be three major
 factions in Congress:
 1. Those who felt the United States should
 fight to the end.   This group dwindled as
 the months passed, and at the last was very
 small.
 2. A group, largely pro-U.N., which felt
 that the overriding necessity was to free the
 world organization from paralysis over the
 issue, even though it would mean loss, for
 the foreseable future, of the U.N.'s legal
 power to tax its members for peacekeeping
 actions.
 3. A group, largely anti-U.N., which wel-
 comed loss of the U.N.'s tax power, fearing it
 might one day be used to embarrass the
 United States.
 19737
 MAJORITY   IN  ANY   CASE
 By whatever process of reasoning the con-
 clusion was reached, a majority decided the
 United States should bow out of the struggle
 as gracefully as possible.
 The  administration                                settled  upon  this
 course in late spring or early summer, and
 thereafter the only problem was how to save
 the most face.
 One device, urged by British Delegate Lord
 Caradon, was to save the law by changing
 the facts, that is, to have the U.N. Assembly
 convert all past contributions for peacekeep-
 ing into voluntary contribution8, so that
 anyone who had not made a contribution
 was not legally in arrears.
 U.S. experts considered that this wouldn't
 wash, that it was too drastic and too ob-
 viously  contrived.  It  could  still  happen,
 even now, despite American skepticism; but
 the United States is not expected to urge it.
 Instead, the United States is expected to
 endorse a relatively simple Ethiopian plan,
 or some close variant of it, under which the
 U.N. would merely decide that article  19
 should not. or will not be raised in the As-
 sembly.  This will mean that business can
 "proceed normally" in September when the
 Assembly reconvenes.
 SHOWDOWN  AVOIDED
 Previously,  ever since January  of  1964,
 the Assembly has been unable to act on
 controversial issues for fear of an explosive
 showdown on article 19.  Beginning in De-
 cember 1964, a device of unanimous consent
 was    adopted to avoid determining which
 countries had the right to vote.  Only a
 relatively few matters could be handled this
 way.
 The result was that the 114-nation As-
 sembly was rendered inoperative, with the
 veto-bound Security Council the U.N.'s only
 practical  resource  in  the  political  field.
 This in turn enhanced the power of the
 Soviet veto.  Virtually nothing could be done
 of which Russia did not approve.
 The forum in which Goldberg will dis-
 close the new American stand is expected to
 be a 33-nation Finance Committee which is
 due to resume August 16.  The present plan
 is for  Goldberg  to  be  among  the  first
 speakers.
 There will be a note of irony for the
 new  American representative in that his
 first major appearance will be to break bad
 news to the American public and to accept
 reversal of a World Court opinion.
 Goldberg came to the U.N. from the U.S.
 Supreme Court, and has said he wants to
 build up the rule of law.  The World Court
 ruled in 1962 that article 19 could be enforced
 in the present case.

 END OF U.S. FIGHT ON U.N. DUES SEEN-GOLD-
 BERG  Is  REPORTED  READY  To  ANNOUNCE
 POLICY SHIFT
 (By Richard Elder)
 WASHINGTON, August  10.-The United
 States will give up its long fight to get the
 Soviet Union to contribute to peacekeeping
 operations of the United Nations, according
 to reliable official sources here.
 This policy shift, which has been consid-
 ered inevitable since last December, is to be
 publicly announced next Monday.  At that
 time,  Arthur  J.  Goldberg,  the new  U.S.
 representative at the United Nations, will
 address a special 33-nation committee that
 has been stdying the question of delinquent
 assessments.
 The Soviet Union and its allies and several
 other countries have refused to contribute
 to peacekeeping operations in the Congo and
 the Middle East.  Other nations contended
 that the arrears of the objecting members
 had built up past the point at which, accord-

 ing to article 19 of the charter, those coun-
 tries were no longer entitled to vote in the
 General Assembly,.
 The sum charged to the Soviet Union as
 arrears is $62,236,000, of which $21.6 million
 would be for this year. The total of the sums
 carried as arrears stands at $1.28 million.
 Other countries that have refused to Con-
 tribute to the peacekeeping operations are
 Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, the Ukraine, Ru-
 mania,  Poland,  Cuba,  Hungary,  Albania,
 France, and South Africa.
 Throughout last year, the United, States
 lobbied vigorously to obtain a General As-
 sembly majority for compelling the Soviet
 Union to pay or lose its vote.  Although the
 majority was believed to have been available,
 some U.S. officials contended that to force
 the matter would disrupt the United Nations.
 This argument prevailed.
 The United States agreed to avoid a show-
 down,  and  a  complicated  formula  was
 adopted under which no votes were taken
 during the last Assembly session. Because
 of this next to no business was done.
 APPROACH DISCUSSED
 Officials here believe that the decision to
 avoid' a showdown  has  undermined any
 chance of rallying a new anti-Soviet majority
 at the 20th Assembly session which opens
 September 21.  It is believed that the United
 States could, at best, fight only a rearguard
 action against the Soviet right to vote.
 The current discussion in the administra-
 tion is on the manner in which the United
 States should signify that it has given up the
 fight.
 Some officials and Other persons close to the
 situation report that Mr. Goldberg favors
 making a clear-cut announcement Monday
 that the United States has dropped its insist-
 ence on linking the penalties of article 19 to
 peacekeeping operations authorized by the
 General Assembly.
 Other State Department officials are re-
 ported to oppose this, saying the United
 States should insist that the Soviet Union
 pay while indicating quietly that it would
 accept whatever the General Assembly de-
 cided this fall.
 CONTRIDUTION OP'PEEZO
 Mr. Goldberg issued a statement calling
 reports that the United States would drop its
 insistence on enforcing article 19 not accu-
 rate.  He added that the question was still
 being discussed and that the U.S. posi-
 tion will be  explained fully and clearly
 when the committee of 33 convenes on
 August 16.
 The United Nations delegate discussed the
 question before a closed session of the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee this morning.
 Later this week he will appear before the
 House Foreign Affairs Committee.
 The Soviet Union contends that only the
 Security Council can authorize peacekeep-
 ing operations, and that it is not obliged to
 pay for operations authorized by the General
 Assembly.  The United States,  and most
 United Nations members, argue that the Gen-
 eral Assembly can act when the Security
 Council is unable through vetoes to do so.
 Mr. ROSENTHAL.  Mr. Speaker, an-
 other Interesting part of this experience
 is that on the previous day there was a
 colloquy on this floor between Mr. HAYS
 and Mr. SISK, of California.  This col-
 loq.uy is to be found on page 19242 of
 the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, of August 11,
 1965.  Mr. HAYS said:
 If I were the gentleman from CaI ornia,
 and he is a very close friend of mine and
 a distinguished Member of this body, I would
 not go too far out on the limb betting that
 that story is wrong.
 That was referring to the 17N story.
 Then Mr. Sis,K replied:
 I might say to my good friend I am not
 betting on it one way or the other.  I am
 simply saying, based on the information I
 have, I think the story is not necessarily
 true because the decision has not been made.
 It may be that the story in the future may
 prove to be true but I question its truth-
 fulness as of last night or as of this time.
 Mr. HAYS then replied:
 I do not know how true it was last night
 and I do not know how true it is this min-
 ute, but if I were a betting man I would
 be .willing to bet a year's salary that the
 new Ambassador to the United Nations will
 make that statement next Monday.
 That is the statement by Mr. HAYS
 which was made approximately 24 hours
 before my own statement was made in
 the well of this House.
 Other of his charges accuse me of giv-
 ing aid and comfort to the Communists
 in holding hearings in my congressional
 district seeking grassroot opinions on the
 war in Vietnam.
 On this matter, I think it is interesting
 to bring to the attention of my col-
 leagues, Mr. Speaker, the remarks Mr.
 HAYS made on September 30, 1964, in the
 Appendix of the RECORD of that day
 which are on pages 5035 and 5036 as
 follows:
 Mr. Speaker, in an effort to reacquaint its
 officers with the thinking and views of Amer-
 icans in communities across the land, the
 Department of State is encouraging Foreign
 Service officers on leave from foreign assign-
 ments to accept invitations to meet with
 community groups, service clubs, churches,
 and other organizations.  This program is
 under the direction of Mrs. Katie Louch-
 heim, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State,
 and long an advocate of an increased dialog
 between American communities and the For-
 eign Service officers who represent us abroad.
 Through such contacts our Foreign Service
 officers are able to familiarize  themselves
 with grassroots thinking on a host of do-
 mestic and international subjects and to be-
 come acquainted with developments in our
 rapidly changing society.
 He goes on to insert an article entitled
 "New Communications With Grassroots
 America," which endorses the idea that
 members of the executive branch ought
 to find out what people are thinking.
 Ought this not also be the duty of Con-
 gressmen? On what grounds would the
 gentleman endorse those meetings and
 attack mine?
 A story of the Long Island Press of
 August 7, 1965, which announced my
 hearings, said:
 ROSENTHAL To  HOLD VIET HEARINGS
 FswAY
 Congressman  BENJAMIN  S.  ROSENTHAL,
 Elmhurst Democrat, will hold an open hear-
 ing                                                     on  Vietnam                                          at  9:30 a.m. Friday  in
 Borough Hall, Kew Gardens.
 The hearings, which the lawmaker says are
 to get the grassroots sentiments of his con-
 stituents, will be held in the old traffic court-
 house.
 A member of the House Foreign Affairs
 Committee, ROSENTHAL  asked all those in-
 terested in expressing their views to write his
 Washington office.
 Although the hearings are not official, Ros-
 ENTHAL said he would compile a report to be
 distributed to Congress, the State Depart-
 ment and the White House.
 A New York Times story that followed
 the hearings on Saturday, August 7, 1965,
 is an article written by Tanta Long; It
 said:
 However, the all-day session was unofficial,
 but a stenographic record was taken.
 In my opening remarks at the hearing,
 of which I hold in my hand a steno-
 graphic record, I said on page 2: "This
 unofficial congressional hearing will be-
 gin a little late."
 On page 5 of those hearings, I said, and
 I quote:
 I want to emphasize that this is an un-
 official hearing, not authorized by any con-
 gressional committee, but will be conducted
 in accordance with the Rules of the House of
 Representatives with the one exception that
 the press, radio, and photographers will be
 permitted.
 There could hardly have been any am-
 biguity here.  I was quite clear in em-
 phasizing the unofficial nature of the
 hearings.
 At the hearing, Mr. Speaker, 35 wit-
 nesses testified, all residents of my con-
 gressional district or those representing
 organizations whose principal activities
 are conducted in my congressional dis-
 trict, offering many and varied views.
 What was the reaction to such hearings?
 Many seemed to agree with the viewpoint
 of the New York Times.
 On this Saturday, August 14, 1965, the
 New York Times carried the following
 editorial entitled "Listening Posts on
 Vietnam."  I read as follows:
 The gloominess of the options the United
 States faces in Vietnam makes it important
 that the country's policymakers keep open
 the fullest opportunities for two-way com-
 munication between them, and the Ameri-
 can people.   President Johnson has  been
 alert in recent woks to the necessity for
 informing both Congress and the country
 of the motivations and limitations of Ameri-
 can involvement.
 A small group of Congressmen have de-
 cided that they can best discharge their ob-
 ligations in helping to shape policy by hold-
 ing unofficial hearings in their districts, at
 which opponents and proponents of Ameri-
 can actions in Vietnam set forth their views.
 Most of these hearings have elicited a broad
 range of opinion in keeping with the best
 traditions of free inquiry and expression.
 The one-sidedness that too often has char-
 acterized college teach-ins has been notably
 absent.
 Despite this accent on the democratic in-
 terplay of Ideas, the hearings have come un-
 der attack in the House by Representative
 WAYNE L. HAYS, of Ohio.  He charges that
 they provide a forum for "crackpots" and
 give aid and comfort to the Communists.
 The notion that free discussion must be a
 casualty of the Vietnamese war impresses
 us at much more destructive of American
 values than any viewpoint that might be
 set forth at the hearings. We hope more Con-
 gressmen will hold them as a demonstration
 of democratic vitality.
 Those Members of whom the Times
 editorial speaks--who have either held
 or participated in such hearings-are:
 Representatives KASTENMEIER, BINGHAM,
 DIGGS, BROOMFIELD, RYAN, RESNICK, and
 FARBSTEIN.
 I have received dozens of letters, Mr.
 Speaker, on the subject since the articles
 about Mr. HAYS' charge appeared in the
 paper.  One that came in not from my
 district but from an adjacent district
 across the Long Island Sound I would
 like to read.  It is from Pastor George
 Koski   of  the  Bernadotte  Evangelical
 Lutheran Church, Strang and Murdock
 Avenues in the Bronx.    It says:

 August 16, 1965'-proved ForC;c"pE?MA/~4Itf8-IZDP67HOUGR000300130013-1
 DEAR MR. ROSENTHAL: It is good to see that
 you are holding informal sessions at which
 the people can voice their views on the com-
 plicated questions of the war in Vietnam.
 Of course, these hearings are not a fully
 satisfactory substitute for the official inquiry
 which should be launched by the Foreign
 Relations and Foreign Affairs Committees,
 but at least they represent the beginning of
 a congressional search for understanding
 which can lay the basis for sound policy.
 I cannot agree with those who feel that
 the Communists are receiving "aid and com-
 fort" from these meetings.  Our Nation has
 grown great not through the suppression of
 dissent but rather through the full exercise
 of our freedoms of belief, expression, and as-
 sociation.  Contrary to the views of some
 legislators, it is not the constitutional duty
 of Congress to duck big questions.  Vietnam
 is a big question. It should not be ducked.
 Your sincerely,
 Pastor GEORGE Kosax.
 Mr. Speaker, I have sought to answer
 strong charges made against me by a col-
 league and fellow Democrat.  I regret
 that these have been made. I regret
 even more that I have had to respond
 to them in this fashion. But I knew of
 no other way to clear my own good name
 which, it seems to me, is put in question
 by accusations that I am the sort to
 "give aid and comfort to the enemy."
 This has been an unfortunate affair.
 Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. ROSENTHAL.  I am happy to
 yield to the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. BINGHAM.  Mr. Speaker, as a
 new Member of Congress I have been
 deeply impressed. by the courtesy gen-
 erally extended by Members to each
 other on this floor, even when they differ
 profoundly on issues. I was therefore
 deeply shocked by the attack that was
 made last Thursday by the gentleman
 from Ohio [Mr. HAYS] on my colleague
 from New York [Mr. ROSENTHAL]. I do
 not believe it is necessary for me to dis-
 cuss in detail the reasons given by the
 gentleman from Ohio for his criticisms.
 They have been dealt with very ably and
 completely by my colleague from New
 York. I should like merely to add a few
 comments.
 First, it was clear, as he had just now
 told the House, from Mr. ROSENTHAL's
 statement on August 12, that he was re-
 ferring to press reports as to what Am-
 bassador Goldberg's position was going
 to be and that he was not disclosing or
 discussing any confidential information.
 Nor was he making any announcements
 of U.S. policy.
 Secondly, my colleague was expressing
 his support for the idea of a flexible
 U.S. position on the article 19 issue.  I
 likewise expressed my support for such
 a position on August 12.  This is essen-
 tially the position which President John-
 son, through Ambassador Goldberg, has
 now announced.
 Third, at the invitation of my col-
 league [Mr. ROSENTHAL], I joined him in
 the informal hearing he conducted in his
 district 10 days ago.  Various points of
 view were expressed there, just as they
 had been at, a forum I.helped to put on
 in my district some weeks before. If such.
 expressions of opinion at the grassroots
 of our country give aid and comfort to
 the Communists, then I say God help us.
 The day we seek to choke off the free
 expression of citizen opinion, that day
 we will have taken a long step toward
 totalitarianism.  We shall be in danger
 of losing the very freedom we are fight-
 ing for in Vietnam.
 Parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, and so
 that there may be no misreading of my
 position, I want to say that in spite of
 great concern and misgivings on some
 points, I support the broad outlines of
 the President's policy in Vietnam as I
 understand it. I expect to have more to
 say on that subject in a day or two.
 Fourth, the gentleman from Ohio was
 quite mistaken in his charge that my col-
 league from New York had given the
 impression that the hearing in his dis-
 trict was some sort of Foreign Affairs
 Committee hearing.  It was clear from
 Mr. ROSENTHAL's statements both before
 and after the hearing that this was an
 informal session with no official status.
 It was on this basis that I took part in it.
 These   are   agonizing   days,   Mr.
 Speaker, for the President of the United
 States and for all of us. We are con-
 fronted with awesome and difficult de-
 cisions on which good men and true,
 loyal Americans, may differ.  When a
 private citizen accuses another private
 citizen with whom he disagrees of giv-
 ing aid and comfort to the enemy, that
 serves no good purpose and is regretta-
 ble.  When one Member of this House
 so accuses a colleague on the floor of this
 House, it is deplorable, and it will only
 impede the important work we have to
 do here.
 I take it, Mr. Speaker, that is the rea-
 son for the rules of this House requiring
 that Members control their tempers and
 enjoining courtesy upon them.
 If I may, as a freshman Member, say
 so, those rules are wise.
 I thank the gentleman from New York
 for yielding to me..
 Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Speaker,
 will the gentleman yield to me?
 Mr. ROSENTHAL. I will be happy to
 yield to the distinguished gentleman
 from Wisconsin.
 Mr. KASTENMEIER. Mr. Speaker, I
 want to thank the gentlemen from New
 York for yielding to me so that I might
 take this opportunity to offer some ob-
 servations in connection with the pro-
 ceedings known as "Hearings on Viet-
 nam" held in various Members' districts.
 I do this because I think in certain
 quarters a considerable misunderstand-
 ing has arisen as to the nature of these
 proceedings and as to what they purport
 to be.  At a later dato I will report more
 fully the unofficial hearings conducted
 by myself in Madison on July 30 and 31.
 I support what the gentlemen from
 New York [Mr. BINGHAM and Mr. RosEN-
 THAL]                                                          have already said in connection
 with the proceedings that they partici-
 pated in.
 However, at this time I should like to
 state that at the very outset the proceed-
 ings were described as unofficial or not
 authorized by a congressional committee
 or the Congress and were further de-
 scribed as being conducted in my repre-
 sentatives capacity as a Member of Con-
 gress solely.  There was no suggestion
 that these were official and to my knowl-
 19739
 edge this inference was not drawn by
 anyone who had taken the trouble to
 read or inquire what the proceedings
 were about.  Secondly, I would like to
 make a brief observation or two about
 the participation in these hearings. I do
 this because some quarters, including in
 my case, one State senator from the
 State of Wisconsin, Senator Gordon
 Roseliep, who has taken the liberty of
 transmitting to various Members of Con-
 gress an undated press release in criticism
 of the proceedings I was conducting, have
 betrayed a woeful lack of information on
 this matter.
 The principle misconception is that the
 hearings were conducted solely or pri-
 marily to provide these administration
 critics of Vietnam policy or even in some
 cases "leftists" a forum to express their
 views.  In all the hearings that I have
 been familiar with, and certainly I can
 speak for the Madison proceedings, or-
 ganizations and experts were invited and
 in fact did participate in support of the
 administration and in some cases in ad-
 vocacy of the military policies beyond
 that of the administration so that at the
 very least a reasonably balanced hearing
 took place.
 In the case of the Wisconsin State
 senator, I am sure that, since he released
 his press release before the hearing took
 place, he was unmindful of the fact that
 such organizations as Young Americans
 for Freedom, Young GOP, The American
 Legion, Reserve Officers of America, Cit-
 izens To Support the People of South
 Vietnam, and many other organizations
 participated voluntarily in the proceed-
 ings. I say this because his release inti-
 mates that these proceedings are some-
 how sinister and darkly motivated. This
 just simply is not true.  Various Mem-
 bers of Congress or, indeed, other citi-
 zens may differ whether proceedings of
 this sort are useful, desirable, or neces-
 sary.  This may depend on one's district
 or one's personal views.  But as far as
 I am concerned the cause of democracy
 and a free society is served by open and
 public discussion of policy issues of the
 highest concern to all citizens. We have
 done this to some extent in public tele-
 vision debate; it was done some months
 ago in March in the House hearings On
 the Sino-Soviet conflict, and it is clear
 to me that it is well that public discus-
 sion goes on concerning the issue of
 gravest importance at this time to all
 Americans.
 A further misconception inherent in
 the release circulated in the name of Wis-
 consin State Senator Roseliep alleges the
 hearings play in the hands of our ene-
 mies by encouraging the communities in
 their belief that America is divided over
 the war in Vietnam.
 What the gentleman seems to be say-
 ing is that free discussion of important
 policy matters is a luxury a democracy
 cannot afford in times of crisis, a prop-
 osition which is contradicted through-
 out the history of this Nation.
 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
 to include excerpts from four editorials
 from prominent newspapers in Wiscon-
 sin, three of which are Republican,
 which have clearly supported the idea of
 having hearings on Vietnam back home
 at the grassroots.

 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
 Objection, it is so ordered.
 There was no objection.
 [From the Monroe (Wis.)  Evening Times,
 July 23, 1965]
 A good many persons from the Monroe
 area have indicated interest in hearing what
 KAsTxNMErER has to say.  And we hope the
 meeting can be held in a manner by which
 we all learn something of value concerning
 the Vietnam situation.
 We don't expect any great answers to the
 problems of the world.  But it should give
 us a better insight into just what Vietnam.
 can mean to you and the fellow who lives
 next door.
 [From the Portage (Wis.)  Daily Register,
 Aug. 2, 1965 ]
 Wisconsin Congressman     ROBERT ]KASTEN-
 rzEn has led the way in what we cannot
 help but think is an admirable cause.  It is
 a political cause, too.  It will help the ener-
 getic KASTENMErER's image; but, mainly, it is
 an attempt to wake up the people of the
 home district and make them aware that the
 national and international problems which
 face our Nation face them also.
 BOB KASTENMErEa may have gained pub-
 licity by holding his hearing.  If so, he richly
 deserves it, for we, in turn, have gained some
 small lesson in the degree of our apathy
 toward the decisions of our Government,
 and in the necessity of our becoming more
 aware of what Is happening on the national-
 international scene.
 fFrom the Waukesha Freeman, July 21, 1965]
 It Is responsive to this overwhelming sen-
 timent that he wants public discussion of
 the issue.  It is our feeling, as well as his,
 that the American people ought to be heard
 on what this country's course shall be prior
 to involvement so serious that there would
 be no other choice than all-out war.
 {:From the Madison Capital Times, July 19,
 1965]
 If ever there was a need for discussion and
 debate on any issue faced by the American
 people it is on this question of the gather-
 ing war in Vietnam.
 We are well on the way to what might be
 the most destructive war in history.  But
 there has been scarcely any debate on the
 decisions which have so deeply involved this
 country.
 Mr. DOW. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-
 tleman yield?
 Mr. ROSENTHAL. I yield to the gen-
 tleman from New York [Mr. Dow].
 3r. DOWN Mr. Speaker, I shall not
 take long to express my thinking. I have
 read the remarks of the gentleman from
 New York and I have read the remarks
 of the gentleman from Ohio.  In my
 opinion, Mr. Speaker, the remarks of the
 gentleman from New York, coupled with
 his observations today, much better serve
 the cause of free speech in this country,
 much better serve our historic American
 tradition of freedom, and much better
 serve the cause of freedom today than
 the remarks of the gentleman from Ohio.
 Mr. FRASER,  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. RO$  1'rHAL.  I yield to the gen-
 tleman from Minnesota.
 Mr. FRASER.  Mr. Speaker, I want to
 join in the remarks of my colleagues
 concerning the incident which has been.
 the subject of this discussion this after-
 noon.
 Mr. Speaker, I read the statement
 which my distinguished friend from New
 York [Mr. ROSENTHAL] made about the
 prospective policy position of the U.S.
 Government In connection with the pay-
 ment of United Nations assessments.  I
 thought that his statement was not only
 in order but was well reasoned and timely
 and, certainly, breached no confidence of
 any kind with respect to any committee
 hearing. I can say that with some confi-
 dence, Mr. Speaker, because I attended
 the committee hearings to which the
 gentleman from Ohio referred.  I have
 also read the press reports, and I am cer-
 tain that what the gentleman from New
 York was talking about was a matter of
 public knowledge, having been fully dis-
 cussed in the press of this Nation.
 I might also say, Mr. Speaker, that I
 am amazed that there should be this in-
 tolerant attitude toward the Idea of hold-
 ing hearings in the district of a Member
 of this House. In a way, it seems to me
 that these hearings are analogous to the
 practice of those Members who seek to
 ascertain public opinion through the use
 of polls.  I know that many Members of
 the House take advantage of this oppor-
 tunity. Also, in a way, it is analogous to
 the invitation extended by the newspa-
 pers of this Nation to have the readers
 comment in the newspaper giving their
 private and individual views.
 Mr. Speaker, it is my judgment that
 holding hearings of the kind that the
 gentleman from New York held pro-
 motes the public interest and serves to
 develop a deeper public understanding
 of the issues involved and helps to en-
 lighten the Members whose responsibility
 it is to both serve the constituents of
 their own districts and the welfare of the
 Nation.
 May I say, Mr. Speaker, I discussed
 with the gentleman from New York the
 nature of the hearings he was proposing
 to hold. It was clear to me then, that
 there was no suggestion that these were
 to be official hearings, but were unofficial.
 I have since verified that by reading the
 press release which announced such
 hearings.
 I had the opportunity to help arrange
 for a speaker for a teach-in at the Uni-
 versity of Minnesota, one of the great
 universities of this country, and I was in
 touch with the Department of State to
 gain from them a spokesman for the
 administration's point of view.
 It is my belief that these teach-ins,
 these hearings, and every other forum
 in this country which provide for a dis-
 cussion of an issue as crucial as that
 of Vietnam deserve our support and do
 promote the public interest.
 Lastly, Mr. Speaker, let me say that I
 serve with my colleague from New York
 [Mr. ROSENTHAL] as a member of the
 Committee on Foreign Affairs.  He is
 one of the hard-working effective mem-
 bers of that committee.  He has demon-
 strated on that committee a very deep
 and genuine concern for the welfare of
 the American people and for their Gov-
 ernment.
 I am glad to associate myself with the
 efforts which he has made to try to in-
 form himself more completely about the
 views of his 'constituents on Vietnam
 and in promoting a broader public dis-
 cussion of the policy alternatives which
 continue to confront this Nation.
 Mr. ROSENTHAL.  I thank the gen-
 tleman from Minnesota.
 (Mr. RYAN (at the request of Mr.
 FRASER) was given permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD.)
 Mr. RYAN.  Mr. Speaker, I join with
 my distinguished colleague, the gentle-
 man from New York [Mr. ROSENTHAL]
 in his remarks on the importance of un-
 official congressional hearings on the
 importance of unofficial congressional
 hearings on the Vietnam situation. It is
 unfortunate that public debate should
 ever become the casualty of war.  It is
 alarming that debate should ever be
 stifled because views expressed differ
 from official governmental policy.
 The Congress has yet to undertake a
 full-scale discussion of the American
 military and political role in Vietnam.
 Nonetheless, decisions are made every
 day that touch the life of every American
 family.  Congressmen need, and the
 American people deserve, all the illumi-
 nation that can be brought to bear on
 the issues.
 The hearings I held on August 12 and
 13 in New York City were designed to do
 just that.  Panels were balanced with
 witnesses who presented various points
 of view-some in support of and some in
 opposition-to  administration  policy.
 Informed citizens exchanged views and
 debated the issues in a free and open
 forum.
 To label such hearings crackpot or the
 participants propagandists is to cloud
 the importance of what was said.  It is
 to divert attention away from the debate
 by the most tactless name-calling.
 I am shocked that any Member of
 Congress would attack another Member
 for encouraging this kind of public dis-
 cussion and impugn his motives.  Cer-
 tainly the gentleman from New York
 [Mr.  ROSENTHAL]   is  owed  a public
 apology.
 People in a democracy bear the re-
 sponsibility of being attentive at all
 times to decisions and events which
 shape their lives. Quiescence is never
 the duty of a citizen.  A silent democ-
 racy is in fact, a dangerous democracy.
 Informed public discussion, on the other
 hand, is a sign of a vital citizenry.  I
 for one have no fears of citizens speaking
 out.
 Mr. GROVER,  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield'?
 Mr. ROSENTHAL.  I am happy to
 yield to the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. GROVER.  Mr. Speaker, there is
 an honest difference of opinion as to the
 wisdom of these teach-ins and I sub-
 scribe totally to the fact that there is
 an honest difference of opinion, and also
 to the wisdom of having broadcast in
 the country a program of informal so-
 called hearings.
 Again, I subscribe to that fact, that
 there is an honest difference of opinion,
 but I have known the gentleman from
 New York [Mr.  ROSENTHAL)  for some
 10 years and his loyalty, his integrity,
 and his patriotism is unquestioned.
 Mr. Speaker, the remarks which were
 made and which I have read in the
 RECORD certainly were ill-advised and in-

 ADVERTISING  SALESMAN  RECALLS  TERROR  OF
 Los ANGELES RIOTING
 (NOTE.-Robert Richardson, 24, a Negro, is
 an advertising salesman for the Los Angeles
 Times.  He witnessed rioting in South Los
 Angeles for nearly 8 hours Thursday night.)
 (By Robert Richardson)
 Los ANGELES, August 13.-It was the most
 terrifying thing I've ever seen In my lilfe.
 I went along with the mobs-watching,
 listening.
 It's a wonder anyone with white skin got
 out of there alive.
 I saw people with guns.  The cry went up
 several times-"Let's go to Lynwood" (an all-
 white neighborhood) whenever there weren't
 enough whites around.
 Every time a car with whites in it entered
 the area, the word spread like lightning down
 the street:
 "Here comes 'Whitey'-get him."
 The older people would stand in the back-
 ground,  egging on the teenagers and the
 people in their early twenties.  Then the.
 young men and women would rush in and
 pull people from their cars and beat them
 and try to set fire to their cars.
 Olie white couple, in their sixties, hap-
 penened to be driving along before the block-
 ades were put up.  They were beaten and
 kicked until their faces, hands, and clothing
 were bloody.  I thought they were going to
 be killed.  How they survived I don't know.
 Those not hitting and kicking the couple
 were standing there shouting "Kill!  Kill!"
 Finally, they turned them loose.  An am-
 bulance was called, and they were taken
 away.
 Two white men ducked when rocks bom-
 barded their car.  When they ducked, the car
 hit a car with Negroes.
 They were beaten so badly one man's eye
 was hanging out of the socket.  Some Negro
 ministers made their way through the crowd
 and carried both men into an apartment

 Mr. HANSEN of Idaho. Mr. Speaker,
 I take the floor today with a deep feeling
 of apprehension.
 The events of the last. few days in Los
 Angeles, Chicago, and other parts of the
 country-but especially in Los Angeles
 and southern California-are enough to
 make one's blood run cold.  Here we
 have seen rioting conducted to such an
 extent that it can only be called armed
 insurrection.  Here we have seen armed
 thugs running rampant in the streets
 burning, pillaging, and killing.
 I received a telephone call yesterday
 from a constitutent who is now in Los
 Angeles.  He described to me the hell
 and horror of that city during the past
 few days and said, "This isn't America."
 I include at this point in my remarks
 three newspaper clippings-the first a

 MOB SLASHES POLICEMAN IN
 CHICAGO OUTBURST
 CHICAGO, August 13.-A crowd of Negroes
 attacked and slashed a white policeman to-
 night as he drove to work through a racially
 troubled West Side neighborhood.
 Blood streamed from face cuts onto his
 civilian clothes as other policemen led him
 through a shoving, shouting crowd of about
 200 Negroes.  He was identified as Robert
 Wiens, 25.
 A uniformed policeman was reported to
 have been knocked unconscious when a bot-
 tle sailed through the window of his squad
 car and hit him on the head.  His identity
 was not immediately known.
 The attack on Wiens took place 1 block
 from a civil rights rally sponsored by ACT,
 a civil rights group.  The rally swelled to
 about 300 after the attack on Wiens.
 The all-Negro crowd at the rally shouted
 "revenge" and "fight" as ACT leader Law-
 rence Landry exhorted them: "You are mis-
 used in a white-controlled society."  Lan-
 dry's speech did not make a direct call to
 violence.
 During the demonstration, 2 dozen crowd
 members marched into the intersection of
 Wilcox  Avenue  and Pulaski  Road, where
 they waved signs, stopping traffic for 5 min-
 utes.
 No arrests were made immediately.
 At one point, a segment of the crowd
 surged several blocks down the street to the
 Goldblatt  Bros.  Department  Store,  where
 they shouted obscenities against "the white
 man's  store"  and attempted to break in.
 Police from six nearby squad cars quelled the
 attempt in minutes.
 A group of about 15, mostly teenagers and
 including girls, broke windows of the store.
 Earlier, city officials suspended three fire-
 men and began an inquiry after a fire truck
 accident * killed a  woman  bystander  and
 provoked a racial demonstration last night.

 Results of the poll also indicate strong
 support for the President's efforts to find
 an alternative to war, his efforts to reach
 a peaceful settlement through negotia-
 tions which our Communist adversaries
 still refuse to participate in.
 Mr. President, I Ain proud that the
 people of my State are so clearly in sup-
 port of President Johnson's policies in
 Vietnam. I ask unanimous consent that
 the Minnesota poll of August 8, 1965, be
 printed in its entirety in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the poll was
 ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as
 follows:
 [Prom the Minneapolis , (Minn.) Tribune,
 Aug. 8, 19Q5]
 FIFTY-EIGHT  PERCENT  APPROVE  SENDING  OF
 TROOPS TO SOUTH.,. VIETNAM
 Most Minnesotans  (58 percent)     support
 U.S. policy of sending more troops to battle
 in South Vietnam, a statewide survey by the
 Minneapolis Tribune's Minnesota poll indi-
 cates.
 Thirty-one percent of the men and women
 questioned in home interviews disapprove of
 enlarging the Nation's role in Vietnam, as is
 being done by the Johnson administration.
 The rest of the people are undecided or
 have special opinions to offer.
 Approval is based mainly on the feeling
 that "we have committed ourselves and have
 got to end the war as soon as possible" or
 that U.S. involvement in the war needs to be
 increased to stop communism.
 Such endorsements often are expressed
 reluctantly in the survey.  "I don't like the
 idea, but we have to do it," a Bloomington
 housewife said.
 A farmer from Otter Tail County put it
 not to feel locked. into.. their, previous opin-
 ions when they were asked:
 "President  Johnson  has  said  that  the
 United States is in South Vietnam to help the
 people there secure their independence and
 to show the world we. keep our promises to
 fight for freedom.            Do you think those are
 good reasons or poor reasons for being In
 South Vietnam?"
 Per-
 cent
 Good  reasons-------------------------  77
 Poor reasons--------------------------  14
 Other answers-------------------------   3
 No opinion---------------------------    6
 Total---------------------------- 100
 Almost half of the people (47 percent) who
 said on the earlier question that our partic-
 ipation in Vietnamese affairs was based on
 unsound principles thought the President's
 explanation was good.

 CENTENNIAL OBSERVANCE OF
 KALAUPAPA SETTLEMENT
 Mr. FONG.  Mr. President, 100 years
 ago a tiny settlement was established on
 the island of Molokai in the Hawaiian
 Kingdom for the victims of leprosy, now
 known as Hansen's disease.
 Last week a 3-day centennial observ-
 ance was held at the Isolated settlement.
 Guests from the outside world were in-
 vited by the nearly 200 active and inac-
 tive  patients  for  a  luau-Hawaiian
 feast-and a display of crafts made
 there.
 It is difficult to imagine now the pa-
 thetic condition of those who were sent
 to the settlement at Kalaupapa in the
 early years.  Into this valley of death
 and despair came Father Damien, who
 ministered to the afflicted until he him-
 self succumbed to the disease.
 The dramatic story of the Kalaupapa
 settlement and the heroic sacrifice- of
 Father Damien has been retold on this
 centennial occasion in an article in the
 Honolulu Star-Bulletin of August 11,
 1965.  Ably written by Tom Kaser, the
 article describes the settlement as it was
 and as it is today.
 I ask unanimous consent to have
 the article printed in the REcoRD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 KALAUPAPA MARKS A CENTURY OF ISOLATION
 (By Tom Kaser)
 KALAUPAPA, MOLOKAI.--You can't help but
 feel a little humble at this place, especially
 when you consider its geography and its his-
 tory.
 Kalaupapa, located on. a peninsula at the
 foot of cliffs on Molokai's rugged north coast,
 is one of only three centers for the treatment
 of Hansen's disease (leprosy) In the United
 States today.
 Hale Mohalu, In Pearl City, and a U.S. Pub..
 lie Health Service hospital in Carville, La.,
 are the only other institutions in the coun-
 try that exclusively treat communicable or
 "active" cases of Hansen's disease,
 It is possible that leprosy, as it was known
 before 1874, was diagnosed In the Hawaiian
 Islands as early as 1823, when a Protestant
 missionary wrote in his journal that "cases
 of ophthalmic scrofula and elephantiasis"
 were on the increase.
 The first officially recorded case of leprosy
 in Hawaii was in 1853, and by the late 1850's
 the disease had spread to almost epidemic
 proportions.
 King Kamehameha V finally declared, in
 January 1865, that those afflicted with lep-
 rosy must be Isolated, and the site chosen
 by the board of health was a peninsula on
 the north coast of Molokai.
 For $1,800, the board bought most of the
 land on the peninsula, including from 15
 to 20 houses and rights to use nearby Wai-
 kolu and Wainiha Valleys.
 Nine men and three women were on the
 first boat that arrived at the peninsula, on
 January 6, 1866. Part of the group consisted
 of kokuas or helpers.  Also included was a
 health department superintendent, but nei-
 ther he nor several of his successors spoke

 whom they can make their case. I refer
 to section 16, amending section 209 (e)
 of the act. It is an amendment I had the
 honor to offer.
 I call attention also to an amend-
 ment offered by the Senator from Ver-
 mont [Mr. PROUTY], which he described
 in his very interesting address, making.
 the National Advisory Council under the
 act really meaningful.
 I call attention also to a very impor-
 tant amendment, sponsored by the Sen-
 ator from California [Mr. MURPHY] and
 the Senator from Vermont [Mr. PROUTY],
 with respect to the possibility of politi-
 cal manipulation, which extends the
 political activity restrictions of the Hatch
 Act, now applicable only to State and
 local officials operating under the act,
 also to private persons whose salaries are
 paid predominantly by the Federal funds
 under the Antipoverty Act.
 The Senator from Arizona [Mr. FAN-
 NIN] offered an amendment specifically
 including consumer education, which is
 a crucial lack among the poor, in the list
 of areas which community action pro-
 grams are encouraged to cover.
 I call attention to another amend-
 ment which I had the honor to propose,
 under which the public is given a greater
 degree of information on the local level
 than the House provided. It is found in
 section 9 of the bill amending section
 202(a) (5) of the act.  It permits public
 hearings at the request of appropriate
 local community groups, as well as open-
 ing books and records of a participating
 agency to the light of day of the press,
 radio, television, and other agencies of
 public information, which can zero in on
 what is being done in the programs. This
 is the best carthartic I know of to deal
 with excesses and inequities.
 Another amendment which I had the
 honor to offer calls for continuous con-
 sultation with State antipoverty agen-
 cies at every stage of the planning and
 conduct of community action programs,
 and is to be found in section 14 of the
 bill amending section 209(a) of the act.
 Too often, the office in Washington has
 announced approval of programs which
 the States have not seen before, this is
 clearly unreasonable in those States
 which are fully cooperating in the anti-
 poverty effort.
 We have not at all done what we ought
 to do about the right of a Governor to
 veto a proposed program.  I feel that we
 made a great mistake in wiping out al-
 together the provision for a Governor's
 veto.  It was done by a close vote in the
 committee; the vote was 8 to 7.  We
 should have left in the bill an effective
 procedure, under a modified version of
 the House provision. A Governor should
 be given the opportunity to express his
 disapproval, as he has every right to do.
 If the Director wishes to override him,
 there should be a public hearing, which
 would put the Director of OEO in Wash-
 ington to his proof. In short, the Gov-
 ernor should not be permitted to kill a
 program, but neither should his disap-
 proval stand if the Director, in the court
 of public opinion,'can prove his case.
 That subject will probably be the most
 serious one. we shall have to deal with
 tomorrow and the next day in consider-
 ing additional amendments with respect
 to this legislation.
 My colleagues, who also proceeded on
 such amendments in the committee, will
 be offering cuts in the authorizations of
 funds.  Whether or not I favor such
 cuts, I believe the Senate should give
 them serious attention, because it is true
 we must not be profligate if there is no
 opportunity to retain control over the
 program.
 In addition, there are "other amend-
 ments with which we shall have to deal.
 Finally, as I announced last week dur-
 ing consideration of the conference re-
 port on the Peace Corps, it is my inten-
 tion to offer an amendment-and this
 will be my final effort in this regard-to
 confine the Director of the antipoverty
 program, Sargent Shriver, to one job,
 namely, his direction of the antipoverty
 program.  I feel that this subject should
 not be labored unduly, but I feel we must
 decide it in respect of how we want this
 poverty program to operate.
 Senators should bear in mind, if we
 get into a discussion-and there are
 many openings for one-in which it is
 found that the administration of the pro-
 gram was at fault, that we should under-
 stand that we had an opportunity to cor-
 rect the situation, and that we either
 did or did not do it in an advised way.
 I have grave concern as. to the propriety
 and wisdom of continuing to let Sargent
 Shriver-an excellent public servant-
 carry both jobs.  I deeply feel that it
 will result in a serious diminution of
 capability in bringing about success in
 both jobs-and most likely it will be felt
 most in the antipoverty program.
 I therefore hope very much that the
 Senate will express itself firmly and
 finally on that subject.  I shall be pre-
 pared to argue the question of constitu-
 tionality of such action taken by the
 Senate, as I believe it is entirely consti-
 tutional and entirely in accordance with
 the powers and authority of the Sen-
 ate-indeed, its duty-in this matter.
 I look forward, therefore, to disposi-
 tion of the amendments and the bill in
 the spirit which I have described, the
 spirit of being very much for the war
 on poverty, and of understanding the pit-
 falls which are involved and therefore
 endeavoring,"by every means open to us,

 RIVERS has long years of experience in
 the field of military affairs from his dedi-

 out that his independent and objective'
 views have caused confrontation with
 far more experienced officials, including
 even the Secretary of Defense. I should
 also like to point out, however, that the
 distinguished chairman has been deal-

 from a responsible position, far longer
 than the Secretary of Defense, not to
 mention his Johnny-come-lately critics.
 In the final analysis, the American
 people must judge what is and what is
 not un-American.  The President has
 stated categorically that we are en-
 gaged in a war in Vietnam. Representa-
 tive RIVERS states that anything short
 of victory in this war would be treason,
 and his other remarks merely expressed
 the hard realities of what may be neces-
 sary to achieve that victory. I am sure
 that Representative RIVERS is satisfied,
 as I am, to leave it to the judgment of
 the American people as to which is un-
 American-victory in the war, or ap-
 peasement of the enemy.
 SUPPORT  FOR  U.S,  MERCHANT

 a friend of the American merchant ma-
 rine, I am extremely interested in the
 work of the Presidential Task Force on
 Merchant Marine Policy, which is headed
 by Alan S. Boyd, Assistant Secretary of
 Commerce.

 The declaration of policy of the mer-
 chant Marine Act of 1936 set forth the
 objectives of the Congress.  Since these
 objectives have since been obscured and,
 in some instances, ignored, I would like
 to quote from this declaration of policy:
 It is necessary for the national defense
 and development of its foreign and domestic
 commerce that the United States shall have
 a merchant marine (a) sufficient to carry its
 domestic waterborne commerce and substan-
 tial portion of the waterborne export and
 import  foreign commerce of the United
 States and to provide shipping service on all
 routes essential for maintaining the flow of
 such domestic and foreign waterborne com-
 merce at all times;  (b)  capable of serving
 as a naval and military auxiliary in time of
 war or national emergency; (c) owned and
 operated under the United States insofar as
 may be practicable, and (d) composed of
 the best-equipped, safest, and most suitable
 types of vessels, constructed in the United
 States and manned with a trained and effi-
 cient citizen personnel.
 It is hereby declared to be the policy of
 the United States to foster the development
 and encourage the maintenance of such a
 merchant marine.
 I believe that these are worthy ob-
 jectives.  From the point of view of
 national defense, there is no question
 that a large and efficient merchant
 marine, coupled with a healthy ship-
 building and ship repair industry, can
 make a major contribution to our na-
 tional security.  Vessels are needed for
 troop transport: The entire First Cavalry
 Division embarked for Vietnam last week
 by ship.  They are needed for supply
 functions as well. Some 600 ships were
 required to supply American troops in
 Korea, and the present situation in
 southeast Asia has demonstrated the
 continuing need for such vessels.  The
 shipyards, both naval and private, must
 also be ready, to activate and repair ves-
 sels for service in the national defense.
 The conclusion of the Harvard Business
 School study for the Navy Department in
 1945 still holds true today:
 The controlling factor in the determina-
 tion of the characteristics of sbippipg and
 shipbuilding activities in the United Stites
 in peacetime as well as in wartime is the
 national security.
 The value to U.S. commerce of a
 healthy merchant marine is equally
 clear.  There will be gains in employ-
 ment, in returns to the American econ-
 omy, and in reliability if "a substantial
 part" of our commerce is carried In U.S.
 bottoms. This is particularly important
 in light of persistent balance-of-pay-
 ments difficulties. Yet today only 9 per-
 cent of our foreign commerce moves in
 American-flag vessels.  Norwegian car-
 riers transport twice as much of the
 American foreign trade as U.S. flagships;
 Liberia carries three times as much as we
 do.  And even from this poor position,
 we are losing ground.
 These concerns become all the more
 urgent in view of the rapid buildup of
 the fleets of other nations, most es-
 pecially of the Soviet Union. The United
 States ranks only fourth in the world
 in number of ships afloat, even discount-
 ing the disastrous effects of the current
 maritime strike.  The Soviet Union has
 already surpassed us in number of ships
 in the active fleet, and may shortly ex-
 ceed us in total tonnage afloat.
 While nations like Japan and Norway
 are engaged In determined efforts to
 build up their fleets, we are falling far-
 ther and farther behind. We now rank
 no higher than 11th among shipbuild-
 ing nations of the world.  The United
 States-the leading trading nation in
 the world-risks becoming low man on
 the totem pole of international shipping.
 The need, then, is clear. My sugges-
 tions fall into four general classifications.
 First.  Probably most important is
 the matter of subsidies.  The Govern-
 ment pays out nearly $400 million a year
 in direct and indirect subsidies to the
 shipping and shipbuilding industries.
 Under normal circumstances, a nation
 whose economy is based upon free enter-
 prise regards a subsidy system as alien
 and undesirable.  It seems to me, how-
 ever, that there are certain goals-the
 ones enumerated in the 1936 act-which
 can be achieved only through the main-
 tenance of a healthy American shipping
 and shipbuilding industry.  Due to sev-
 eral factors, notably the high standard
 of living of American workmen, these
 goals simply cannot be met without Gov-
 ernment subsidy.  It Is for this reason
 that, although I sympathize with those
 who dislike the general principle of Gov-
 ernment subsidy, I feel that certain
 forms of subsidy are essential in this
 case.
 Construction subsidies are an impor-
 tant means of insuring the adequacy of
 the merchant marine and of the ship-
 yards.  It seems to me to be advisable
 to continue the present system of con-
 struction differential subsidies to the
 liner fleet.  The U.S. liner fleet is the
 finest in the world, due in large part to
 the Government aid program-80 per-
 cent of the 20-knot cargo liner vessels in
 the world have been built and operated
 in the United States.  This part of the
 program should continue, with up to 55
 percent of the construction cost being
 paid by the Federal Government.
 The first Subcommittee of the Mari-
 time Advisory Committee, after long and
 careful study of U.S. needs, has concluded
 that a bulk carrier construction aid pro-
 gram is desirable.  This has long been
 my position.
 Given the requirement that ships be
 built in the United States, we must rec-
 ognize that this county will never ac-
 quire an efficient bulk carrier fleet with-
 out Government subsidy. And it is most
 certainly in the national interest that
 such a fleet of dry bulk carriers be devel-
 oped.
 According to the analysis made by the
 Presidential Task Force, the average cost
 of each bulk carrier would be $11 mil-
 lion, approximately half of it to be paid
 by the Government. A fleet of 250 ves-
 sels, to be built by 1985, has been sug-
 gested.
 Such a program would add $169 mil-
 lion to the annual subsidy of nearly $400
 million, at the outset, for a total expendi-
 ture of approximately $570. million.
 I do not believe that this is too large a
 price to pay for the development of a
 bulk carrier fleet, which can be of in-
 estimable value to this country in the
 future.  Moreover, as the Maritime Ad-
 visory Subcommittee has pointed out:
 Much of the cost will be recouped by the
 Government through additional revenues.
 A substantial portion of every dollar
 of subsidy will return to the Government
 in the form of income or corporation tax.
 I would not presume to give detailed
 advice as to the number and design of
 such vessels, of course. But I believe that
 subsidy for such construction would be
 highly appropriate. It would undoubedly
 prove to be one of the best investments
 that this Government could make.
 It might prove necessary, once the
 contruction of the new dry bulk carriers
 is completed, to grant an operating sub-
 sidy to this segment of the fleet as well.
 I would propose, however, that no such
 action be undertaken until a detailed
 study of the requirements had been com-
 pleted.  With the modernization of the
 fleet and the continuation of the cargo
 preference assistance, the dry bulk car-
 riers might well prove to be self-support-
 ing.                    Y
 I have already cosponsored in the Sen-
 ate a bill S. 1858, which would allow the
 creation of tax-free reserve funds for the
 construction of new vessels. The enact-
 ment of such a proposal would provide
 construction assistance to the other non-
 subsidized shippers. The continuation of
 present trade-in procedures is also to be
 recommended.   Taken  together,  this
 construction assistance for liners, dry
 bulk carriers, and others would provide a
 well-rounded program of modernization
 of the U.S. cargo fleet.
 Another important  area in which
 Government assistance is given is that of
 operating subsidies.  :Due to the high
 standard of living of American seamen,
 there appears to be no alternative to con-
 tinued operating subsidies, if we are to
 continue to hire American crews and op-
 erate ,vessels under the American flag.
 These subsidies must therefore be con-
 tinued.  '.
 It may be noted, however, that a sig-
 nificant increase in construction sub-
 sidies, s}tch as I have urged, would pro-
 duce a much more modern and efficient
 American fleet.  This in turn would re-
 duce the amount of operating subsidy
 needed.
 Second. Another area in which the
 Government can be of great assistance
 in promoting a healthy merchant ma-
 rine is the policy of cargo preference.
 Public Law 664, enacted in 1954, pro-
 vides that at least 50 percent of U.S.
 Government-generated cargo shall be
 carried in American flag vessels, if such
 vessels are available at "fair and rea-
 sonable rates."  Public Resolution 17,
 enacted in 1934, declares that all agri-
 cultural products financed by U.S. loans
 shall be delivered in U.S. vessels, if they
 are available.  In addition, all military
 cargoes must be shipped on American
 flag ships.
 Three years ago, the late President
 Kennedy reaffirmed the importance of
 this cargo preference, stating in particu-
 lar that the 50 percent requirement "is a
 minimum, and It shall be the objective

 There being no objection, the article

 as follows:
 SCREWBALL IDEAS
 (By Barry Goldwater)
 Senator WAYNE  MORSE, of Oregon, sug-
 gests that there is a rising demand among
 the American people to impeach President
 Johnson.     He             made this  astounding  an-
 nouncement recently in the Senate.
 Senator MORSE, who is noted for going to
 any lengths to make a point In favor of his
 own position? claimed that this is due to
 the administration's Vietnam policy, which
 he opposes.
 "In my trip across the country," the Ore-
 gon Democrat told his colleagues on August
 3, "I have been alarmed by the rising de-
 nuciation of the President and his adminis-
 tration for their Vietnam policy.
 "I have heard the word 'impeach' used
 more often in the last week than I have
 heard it since President Truman sacked Gen-
 eral MacArthur.
 "I have been asked by more people than
 I would have thought possible if there is not
 grounds for impeachment of the President,
 and how the process can be set in motion.
 I have been advised about petitions that
 have been circulated and hundreds of peo-
 ple are signing asking for the President's
 impeachment," he stated.
 "Much of this talk stems from objections
 to a war being undertaken without congres-
 sional declaration.  Most of these people see
 the President as waging an executive war
 in violation of the Constitution.  They think
 the impeachment clauses of the Constitu-
 tion must apply to such a case."
 Senator MORSE accused President Johnson
 in the same speech of conducting an illegal
 war in Vietnam.  He added:
 "In my judgment, we cannot jutify the
 homicides for which the President or Rusk
 or McNamara or Bundy or Lodge and the
 rest of them are responsible in conducting
 an unconstitutional war In South Vietnam."
 These statements, coming from a Demo-
 crat, raise some interesting questions.
 One wonders just who  Senator MORSE
 talked to during his trip across the country.
 Since all the public opinion polls show
 the American people overwhelmingly sup.
 port the President's policy in Vietnam, it
 must be concluded that the Senator spent
 his time consulting the intellectual extrein-
 latA who keep suggesting that the President
 Is "out of control" because he has decided to
 stand firm against Communist aggression in
 Asia.  It is safe to assume that most Amer-
 icans                           never heard  the  suggestion of  im-
 peachment until senator MORSE cut loose.
 What did he expect to accomplish by his
 remarkable statement?
 He carefully says that he was "alarmed"
 by what he heard.   But It is important to
 note that his concern did not prevent him
 from giving the widest possible .circulation
 to a ridiculous suggestion of removing the
 President.
 Senator MORSE also coupled his comments
 with a demand that the administration give
 heed to Congressional critics of its Vietnam
 policy and that the Congress remain in ses-
 sion so that the stream of criticism can con-
 tinue for the remainder of the year.
 Senator MORSE should pause to consider
 why people with such an qutlandish idea as
 impeachment of the President should seek
 him out for questioning.  Such charges as
 once  accusing  administration  officials  of
 homicide make him the logical repository
 for screwball ideas.
 This certainly should be the source of his
 concern.  It proves beyond any doubt that
 the fax-left critics of President Johnson's
 foreign policy have become irrational in their
 objections and that they are running far
 beyond the bounds of intelligent debate.
 They are certainly "out of control."
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I could
 not find a better recommendation for my
 position on any issue than to discover
 that Goldwater is against it. The reason
 why he made such little imprint on
 American public opinion in 1964 is well
 illustrated by the tactics to which he re-
 sorted in publishing this article.
 I should like to suggest to Mr. Gold-
 water that, he give instructions to his
 ghost writers at least to tell the whole
 story.  However, we do not expect that
 from Mr. Goldwater and his ghost
 writers.
 Mr. President, the column takes great
 exception because I painted out in the
 Senate that there are those in this coun-
 try who seek to resort to impeachment
 proceedings against the President of the
 United States because of his undeclared,
 unconstitutional, and  illegal  war  in
 southeast Asia. But, there Is not a word
 in the Goldwater distortions to show
 that I made perfectly clear that I com-
 pletely disagree with the position taken
 by those talking about impeachment.
 The first reference to communications
 which I received, and discussions which
 I have heard concerning impeachment,
 was in reference to comments I made in
 the Senate on August 3 setting forth
 again as I have so many times, my dis-
 approval of the President's executive
 handling of the conduct of the war with-
 out the slightest constitutional authority
 to do so.  I pointed out in that speech
 of August 3 that the President has come
 under criticism for conducting a war
 without a declaration of war.  Further,
 I pointed out that it should be evident
 that if Congress goes ahead with its
 present plan to adjourn by Labor Day,
 or shortly thereafter, the war in Viet-
 nam will be even more completely an
 executive war than it is now, because
 Congress, at least at the present time, if
 it wills, has the constitutional checks
 which it can apply to the President, the
 Department of State, and the Depart-
 ment of Defense.
 I also pointed out that Congress cod
 do more to protect the President from
 impeachment talk if it remained in ses-
 sion, because it would be in-a position to
 exercise its checking function; whereas
 with Congress out of session for 3 or 4
 months, the President, would be exposed
 to rising charges that he is conducting
 a war without reference. to the Consti-
 tution.
 During the past few weeks I have said
 over and over again that I believe the
 best friends of the President in Congress
 are those who wish to keep Congress in
 session.  I have suggested that if Con-
 gress feels that its schedule permits it
 to take a recess of 4, 2, or 3 weeks at a
 time, It might consider doing that, but to
 adjourn sine die would be something
 different.
 I do not believe we can morally justify
 adjourning  Congress  sine  die  with
 American boys dying in southeast Asia
 In a war that could spread rapidly.
 We have a clear duty, connected with
 our positions of public responsibility, to
 stay in session, if it is for no other re a-
 son than to remain here to participate
 in our constitutional duties as a cheek
 upon the executive branch of the Govern-
 ment under our system of three coequal
 and coordinate branches of government
 while a war, even though in this instance
 an unconstitutional war, is being fought
 and supreme sacrifices are being made.
 There is not the slightest reference in
 the Goldwater trash that he published
 in his column yesterday about the speccki
 I made on August 4. He quotes from my
 August 3 speech. On August 4 I repeated
 the language to which Goldwater refers
 from my August 3 speech. Then I went
 on to say, quoting from my August 4
 speech:
 Then I went on to make a statement as
 why, in my judgment, Congress should not
 adjourn sine die but should remain in ses-
 sion until January 1,  I pointed out that
 we should remain in session and carry out
 our constitutional responsibility of serving
 as a legislative check upon- executive action.
 There are those, judging from the inter-
 views with the press today, and from tele-
 phone calls that the senior Senator from
 Oregon has received, who interpret my re-
 marks as indicating that I advocate the im-
 peachment of the President.
 Of course, such an interpretation is
 nonsense.
 Then I proceeded to develop my rea-
 sons for opposing any suggestion about
 impeachment, and set out the contents
 of the letters that I had sent out in
 answer to such suggestions, in which I
 made perfectly clear that I thoroughly
 disapprove of any impeachment pro-
 posal.
 I ask unanimous consent that certain
 excerpts from the August 4, 1965, speech
 be printed at this point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the excerpts
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, yesterday I said
 In a speech on the floor of the Senate.
 "Mr. President, in my trip across the coun-
 try and back since I spoke on the floor of the
 Senate last Wednesday, I have been alarmed
 by the rising denunciation of the President
 and his administration for their Vietnam
 policy.  I have heard the word "impeach"
 used more often in the last week than I have
 heard it since President Truman sacked
 General MacArthur.  I have been asked by
 more people than I would have thought pos-
 sible if there is not grounds for impeach-
 ment of the President, and how the process
 can be set in motion.  I have been advised
 about petitions that have been circulated
 and hundreds of people are signing asking

 marks as indicating that I advocate the

 Of  course,  such  an  interpretation  is
 nonsense.
 Mr. President, I have been receiving a great
 deal of mail in regard to this matter and
 many people have talked to me at meetings
 at which I have spoken in opposition to the
 President's war in Vietnam.  I have been
 answering all of the mail on the impeach-
 ment matter with a letter that contains these
 two paragraphs.  I read two paragraphs from
 a letter dated July 6, 1965.  I have sent simi-
 lar letters before and since that time: ?
 "In your letter, you asked me for my views
 concerning your suggestion that steps should
 be taken to impeach President Johnson and
 perhaps some other officials.  It is my view
 that such an impeachment attempt would
 be a very serious mistake.  All it would do
 would be to divert attention away from the
 basic issues involved in American foreign
 policy in Asia and center attention on Presi-
 dent Johnson, as an individual.            It would
 cause many people who disagree with his
 foreign policy to rally behind him, because
 they would consider such a movement to be
 an ad hominem approach.     Attacking John-
 son, personally, will not change his course
 of action, and it will not win supporters for
 a change of foreign policy in Asia, but to
 the Contrary, it will drive supporters away.
 In my opinion, there is no question about
 Johnson's sincerity or his patriotism or his
 desire for peace.  It Is Johnson's bad judg-
 ment and mistaken reasoning in respect to
 the war in Asia that constitute the basis of
 the crucial problems that confront us in try-
 ing to get a change in Johnson's policies in
 Asia.  To attack him, personally, by propos-
 ing impeachment would be the most seri-
 ous personal attack that could be made upon
 him.   It would  rally  the  Nation  behind
 him and result in his policies being escalated
 into a major war at a much faster rate.
 Those of us who oppose Johnson's foreign
 policies must meet his views on their merits.
 We should never attack him, personally."
 I wish the RECORD to show that this letter
 represents the position the senior Senator
 from Oregon has taken in all correspondence
 on the subject.  Also, it represents my an-
 swers to questions on impeachment at all
 rallies I have attended, and in all my con-
 versations with those who urge impeachment
 of the President.
 Those that I have talked to and who have
 written to me suggesting impeachment of the
 President are not extremists in the sense
 that they are irresponsible persons.  Many
 of them are on the faculties of American uni-
 versities.  Many of them are out of the pro-
 fessional life of our Nation.
 I have no intention of joining them in such
 a program.  Neverthless, I believe it is a
 significant fact that there is growing discus-
 sion in this country of an attempt to stop
 the President from his illegal war in south-
 east Asia, even to the extent of circulating
 impeachment petitions.
 Mr. MORSE. I merely wish to say in reply
 to the Senator from Ohio that it is not at
 all surprising for people in the country who
 think the President is following an uncon-
 scionable and illegal course of action in
 South Vietnam to turn to the Constitution
 and  look  for  what procedural  protection
 they have. They have a perfect right to turn
 to the impeachment procedure.   I believe
 that they are making a great mistake in
 judgment.   I, of course, would defend them
 in their right to exercise their constitutional
 rights.  But, in one sense, I should like to
 say to the Senator from Ohio that until the
 President follows his constitutional obliga-
 tion by coming before this body and asking
 for a declaration of war, the President is en-
 gaged in an illegal war. It is a war now con-
 ducted by the Chief Executive, in South
 Vietnam without a scintilla of constitutional
 right.    This Congress is likewise guilty of
 violating its duties under the Constitution
 by seeking to delegate to the President a
 power that it cannot constitutionally dele-
 gate.                                                 It is the duty of the Congress under
 article I, section 8, either to declare war or
 to  stop  the  President . from  slaughtering
 American boys in southeast Asia.  I have no
 doubt that impeachment talk will increase
 if the President qontinues to conduct an un-
 constitutional war.
 Mr. MORSE.           Mr. President, let me
 make very clear that the more Barry
 Goldwater attacks me the better I like
 it, because that will only show how right
 I am.  He was dead wrong throughout
 the campaign in his shocking proposals
 for military action which would have in-
 volved us in a major war in Asia. It is
 with great regret that I find my Presi-
 dent has followed to too great a degree
 the very unsound position that Gold-
 water took during the campaign.
 I still hope, upon further reflection
 and as more and more evidence comes in
 with respect to the great concern that
 exists throughout the country with re-
 spect to our military course of action in
 southeast Asia, that my Government will
 return to the framework of international
 law and that we will put the members of
 the United Nations on the spot by for-
 mally submitting the entire subject to
 the Security Council, and in that way
 find out who it is who really believes in
 substituting the rule of law for military
 might as a means of settling disputes
 which have raised this serious threat to
 the peace of the world.
 THE DEADLOCK IN CONFERENCE
 ON THE FOREIGN AID AUTHOR-
 ZATION BILL
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, as the
 country now knows, the Senate confer-
 ees and the House conferees have been
 in deadlock over the foreign aid author-
 ization bill. The Senate committee and
 the Senate adopted the Fulbright-Morse
 amendment to the foreign aid bill. The
 first part of the proposal submitted by
 the Senator from Arkansas would au-
 thorize a 2-year extension of foreign aid.
 The second part, the amendment which
 I offered-and which I have offered for
 several past years-seeks to bring the
 present program of foreign aid to an
 end.  The date of my amendment this
 year was the beginning of fiscal year
 1967. In  the  intervening  period  a
 thorough study of foreign aid would be
 made by a special committee, to the end
 of starting a new foreign aid' program
 on the basis of new rules and procedures
 and policies, to the extent that the old
 program needs to be changed, as found
 by that study; and the objective should
 be that the new program should seek to
 limit the foreign aid program to 50
 nations, although we made very clear,
 as the RECORD will show at the time the
 Senate debated the matter, that there is
 nothing 'fixed about the figure 50, and
 that if the study showed that it ought to
 19829
 be a higher number or a lesser number,
 another number ought to be selected.
 Mr. President, it is highly significant
 that the Foreign Relations Committee
 this year formally adopted my amend-
 ment.  The present Presiding Officer of
 the Senate [Mr. LONG of Louisiana], a
 member of the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee, knows that for the past 2 years
 serious consideration has been given to
 the Morse proposal. In my two dissent-
 ing reports in the past 2 years on foreign
 aid I pointed out that the majority in
 their report was kind enough to point
 out that their feeling was there had been
 great errors in foreign aid, but that they
 felt the administration should be given
 a further opportunity to bring about the
 necessary changes and reforms.
 The Presiding Officer knows that in
 the past 2 years I have said that the
 majority of the committee had made my
 case for me, and that when they admit
 that reforms are necessary it clearly be-
 comes the responsibility of the Foreign
 Relations Committee to make recom-
 mendations for reforms.
 This year, in contrast to the majority
 position of the last 2 years, the commit-
 tee started adopting some reforms. The
 Fulbright proposal for a 2-year authori-
 zation, coupled with the Morse proposal
 for ending the program at the beginning
 of fiscal year 1965, and starting a new
 program, was really a matter of major
 moment in connection with foreign aid.
 Without disclosing any privileged mat-
 ter, as the papers have stated, the For-
 eign Relations Committee met last week,
 on August 12, with the Secretary of
 State, Mr. Rusk, and the director of for-
 eign aid, Mr. Bell, and they discussed the
 impasse that has developed between the
 Senate conferees and the House con-
 ferees, and it was pointed out that there
 was a deadlock.
 The Presiding Officer knows that dead-
 locks are resolved. The Presiding Officer
 knows that someone will recede.
 I say to my colleagues in the Senate
 that I pay high tribute to the chairman
 of the Senate conferees, the Senator
 from Arkansas [Mr. FULBRIGHT].  I am
 indeed proud of the insistence of the
 Senate conferees in conferences with the
 House, in their attempt to work out a
 conscionable accommodation of the dif-
 ferences which exist between the two
 conference groups.
 We also know that the administration
 has put on the heat. The administration
 wants a conference report. I can under-
 stand that. However, I believe that in
 getting a conference report, unless the
 suggestion I am about to make is ac-
 cepted, the end result will be closer to
 what the House wants than what the
 Senate has passed. I hope not, but that
 is my fear.
 I have made clear that I cannot vote
 in conference for the renewal of the old
 program. The American people are en-
 titled to something better. I believe that
 the real friends of foreign aid should
 insist on something better. In my judg-
 ment, if we continue foreign aid on the
 basis which has characterized it in the

 past,. the American people will rise up
 against it at the polls and make perfectly
 clear to the Members of Congress that
 they are fed up with it.
 They should have done it several years
 ago.  Since 1946 we have had a program
 costing some $111 billion which is so
 honeycombed  with  inefficiency  and
 shocking waste, and is the cause of so
 much corruption in so many parts of the
 world,that it ought to be stopped.  I be-
 lieve the military aid aspects of foreign
 aid explain to a remarkable degree some
 of the serious plights in which the United
 States finds itself in those areas of the
 world where strong anti-American feel-
 ing is developing; and more of that is
 entering.  I  mention  it  in  passing
 tonight only because I wish to say that
 those of us who are insisting upon a
 reform of foreign aid are the true
 friends of  foreign  aid.  Officers of
 the present administration who wish to
 continue foreign aid as it has been will,
 in my judgment, run into such strenous
 opposition from the American people that
 they are the ones who will do great
 damage  to  the  positive,  affirmative
 aspects that could characterize a sound
 foreign aid program.
 I shall not sign a conference report and
 I shall not vote for a conference report,
 as I made very clear to the conference,
 and as I have made very clear heretofore
 in the Senate, that is merely a conference
 report that would give the American tax-
 payers more of the same-more waste,
 more inefficiency, more corruption, and
 more expedients to postpone the' day of
 reckoning .,in the underdeveloped areas
 of the world. So I have-proposed a con-
 tinuing resolution on foreign aid on a
 temporary basis until there can be some
 crystallization of a foreign aid program
 that will at least include some procedures
 therein which will make it possible for
 us to go ahead with the reform of foreign
 aid.
 But, It is said, "What about Vietnam?"
 Let us face it.  Vietnam no longer has
 anything to do with the foreign aid pro-
 gram.  Vietnam is in a class by Itself.
 The funds for Vietnam are included
 in the foreign aid bill, but everyone knows
 that, in the months ahead, we shall re-
 ceive requests from the administration
 for additional funds for Vietnam, and
 those measures will be passed.
 I do not believe, in connection with
 the continuing resolution with respect
 to foreign aid, that Vietnam presents
 any sound argument against such a con-
 tinuing resolution.
 What we should do is to give consid-
 eration to a continuing resolution on
 foreign aid.  The Senate ought to con-
 sider a continuing resolution rather
 than a new foreign aid bill which, in my
 judgment, would entrench more deeply
 the existing evils of our present foreign
 aid bill.  I make these comments today
 because I wish to make them as a mat-
 ter of public record in the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD, and to express the hope that
 my President, the Secretary of State,
 and the directcr of foreign aid, Mr. Bell,
 will give careful thought to the sug-
 gestion.
 I am not alone in making the sugges-
 tion, because other members of the com-
 mittee, in effect, said in the presence of
 the Secretary of State the other day that
 they would like to have the Department
 of State be prepared to advise us as to
 what insurmountable problems would be
 created by such a continuing resolution,
 if any-and I do not believe there are
 any.
 It is better for the Senate and for the
 House to adopt a continuing resolution
 of aid as it now exists rather than to go
 ahead and adopt a new foreign aid bill
 before we have had the time to make the
 necessary reforms or time to make the
 necessary reforms for a new foreign aid
 program.  So I make that suggestion
 tonight in the hope that the administra-
 tion will consider it.  If a conference
 report based upon a receding by the Sen-
 ate conferees, or a majority thereof,
 comes to the floor of the Senate, it will
 stir up a considerable discussion in the
 Senate and in the country, because the
 public generally, in my opinion, wishes
 foreign aid cfeaned up.
 The bill before us for conference with
 the Fulbright-Morse amendments elim-
 inated would give the American people
 no hope for cleaning up of foreign aid
 under that bill. The Senate should con-
 sider and adopt a continuing resolution
 because of a deadlock in conference and
 because there is a growing recognition of
 the situation on the part of the confer-
 ees, the members of the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee, and Members of the
 Senate; and the sentiment is also preva-
 lent in the House.  There is one House
 conferee who goes even further than I
 go In regard to foreign aid.  He would
 lead one to believe that he would be per-
 fectly willing to end it for all time.
 Interestingly,  I consider myself  a
 stronger advocate, or an advocate of
 foreign aid as strong as any Member of
 the Senate, bar none, but an entirely
 different type of foreign aid than has
 been fleecing the American taxpayers
 out of billions of dollars for so many
 years.
 So if we really wish to be friends of
 foreign aid, the Senate and the House
 ought to support a resolution that would
 continue, for another year, foreign aid as
 it was administered under the old bill.
 Such action would not prevent it from
 being adopted with the clear understand-
 ing that Vietnam is excluded, and Viet-
 nam will be considered by itself in the
 light of the needs as that illegal war
 progresses.
 ADJOURNMENT
 Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, if there
 is no further business to come before the
 Senate at this time, I move that the
 Senate adjourn until 12 o'clock noon
 tomorrow.
 The motion was agreed to; and (at 6
 o'clock and 8 minutes p.m.) the Senate
 adjourned  until tomorrow,  Tuesday,
 August 1.7, 1965, at 12 o'clock meridian.

 Brother E. L. Schovajsa of Temple.  We were
 delighted to talk briefly to the group and
 meet the students individually.   They are a
 well-mannered, alert, and pleasant group of
 young people.  Their instructor is Brother
 John L. Chervenka, who is principal of Rogers
 High  School,  and  also  teaches  Spanish.
 Czech I is taught the first year and Czech II
 the next.  Last year's Czech I class numbered
 23; this year's Czech class numbers 10, which
 is about normal.  The classes use the Mikula
 text, published in 1936.  No State funds are
 available for the purchase of newer or revised
 texts, because of a State education require-
 ment that before a free text can be supplied,
 over 10,060 students must be enrolled in a
 particular course in the State.  The class is
 very  short  on  dictionaries.   Your  editor
 promised that he would try to help them out
 in this regard. A good Czech-English and
 English-Czech dictionary is available through
 the   Czechoslovak Publishing Co., here    in
 West, for a price of $6. Here is a good chance
 for someone who wants to do something good
 and worth while for the cause of the Czech
 language and its survival in what is probably
 the last outpost of Czech instruction in the
 whole United States of America.   Anyone
 wishing to purchase this dictionary for the
 permanent use of Rogers High School Czech
 classes may do so by making out their check,
 payable to the Czechoslovak Publishing Co.,
 indicating on the check what it is for, and
 we will do the rest.  The Vestnik will publish
 the list of donors, and if -you'd like, we'll
 insert the name of each donor in the dic-
 tionary.                             A lot of people wax strong about
 the sad plight of the Czech language here in
 Texas.  Here then, is a direct way to aid the
 cause.  They need your help.  How about it?
 Now is the time to prepare for the fall school
 semester.
 Brother Chervenka is a member of SPJST
 Lodge No. 69, New Colony, and is doing a
 fine job with these young people, considering
 the tools he has available.  His brother, Cal-
 vin, is also an SPJST member, and teaches
 at Temple Junior College.  The SPJST is
 well represented among the young people at
 Rogers High.
 Our sincere thanks to Brother Schovajsa
 for his invitation, and to Brother Cher-
 venka, students and faculty at Rogers High,
 our congratulations, and may every success
 be yours.  -

 CZECH LANGUAGE CLASS AT ROGERS ONLY ONE
 IN NATION           -
 (By Beth Allen)
 RoGERs.-A teenage boy stood in front of
 a class .last week and read a newspaper arti-
 ticle about President John F. Kennedy pub-
 lished on the first anniversary of his assas-
 sination.
 But he's not a member of a civics class
 whose time-sense is out of whack.
 He's a member of the only public high
 school Czech class in the Nation and he'd
 already read the article in Czech.  Now he's
 translating.
 The article appeared in the Vestnik, the
 Czech-English newspaper published in West,
 in central Texas, and the student is a mem-
 ber of the' Czech II class at Rogers High
 School.
 The Vestnik is used as a supplementary
 text.  J. L. Chervenka, who teaches the class,
 said they have about a year's supply of old
 Vestniks theyeised for reading.
 The State-adopted text is the oldest in
 the State, according to Chervenka.  It was
 published back in 1936 and adopted in 1937
 and is loaded with drills but has little read-
 ing matter.        -
 Because it's the only public high school
 Czech class in the Nation, the Rogers class
 finds reading matter a little hard to come tifully commemorates the former Presi-
 by.  Hence, the use of the Vestnik.                                                                                  dent and made him live again by apply-

 So Czech at Rogers High School is not ac-
 tually taught as a foreign language, Cher-
 venka said.
 Most of the students already speak Czech
 by the time they enroll in the course.  How-
 ever, they are actually illiterate in the lan-
 guage, just as English-speaking students are
 illiterate in English until they study it in
 school.  In other words, they can speak it
 fluently, perhaps with faultless    grammar,
 but can't read or write the language.
 So the emphasis in the Czech classes
 (Czech I is taught one year and Czech II the
 next) is not on obtaining a basic vocabulary
 and learning the grammar from scratch, but
 enlarging the students' vocabularies and im-
 proving their grammar.
 The textbook is used to provide grammati-
 cal rules and drill.  The Vestnik provides
 practice in reading aloud in Czech and trans-
 lating from Czech to English and from Eng-
 lish to Czech.  Mr. Chervenka uses a program
 with "a lot of original writing in Czech.
 These Czech themes are reproduced and dis-
 tributed  to  the  class  for  translation  to
 English.
 Last year's Czech I class numbered 23.
 This year's Czech II class is smaller, as is
 usual with language classes.  There are 10
 in the group.
 The credits these students earn are ac-
 cepted in colleges across the land as foreign
 language credits.
 Chervanka also teaches Spanish at Rogers
 High School and is principal.
 The class was first organized in the fall of
 1957 and has been offered every year since
 then on the alternating basis.
 B. F. Harbour, superintendent of schools,
 figures Rogers High School is a fine place to
 offer the course,  "About 85 students out of
 the 205 enrolled in high school are Czech,"
 he said.
 Rogers' unique place in modern language
 instruction came to light in a nationwide
 survey made by a language association.  A
 school in Illinois listed the course, but no
 current class was reported.  .
 Students enrolled in Czech II this year are
 Margaret Malina, Johnnie Elsik, Willie Jana-
 cek,                                                                         J.  W.  Pechal,  Shirley Pekar,     Anton
 Hutka, David Vanicek, Calvin Motl, Linhart
 Pechal, and Edward Skrabanek.
 Hoover's 91st Birth Date
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 RATIVE PROGRAM, WEST BRANCH, IOWA, AU-
 GUST 10, 1965
 (Address by Richard M. Nixon)
 This distinguished gathering, honored by
 the presence of General Eisenhower, is in
 itself, an eloquent tribute to one of America's
 greatest leaders.  The honor which has been
 accorded to me to add to that tribute pro-
 vides a wide and rich choice of subjects.
 For over 50 years Herbert Hoover walked as
 an equal among the giants of the earth.
 We could honor him for his service as Pres-
 ident of the United States.
 We could honor him for his achievements
 as an engineer and as an author.
 We could honor him for his contribution
 to the cause of more efficient government
 through the reports of the Hoover Commis-
 sions on Government Reorganization.
 We could honor him for the selfless service
 which earned him worldwide recognition as
 the great humanitarian of the 20th century.
 But, great as were his achievements, Eu-
 gene Lyons was probably correct in conclud-
 ing that Herbert Hoover will be remembered
 more for what he was than what he did.
 In terms of public esteem, never has one
 man fallen so low and risen so high.  Thirty-
 three years ago he left the White House
 vilified by his enemies and forsaken even by
 some of his friends.  Like Secretary Rusk,
 he had learned how viciously cruel so-called
 scholars can be in writing of their contem-
 poraries.
 In that  dreary March of  1932,  Herbert
 Hoover - could well have been described as
 the "man nobody knows."  This warm, kind,
 generous, shy, witty, and progressive human-
 itarian was painted as a' cold, heartless, self-
 ish, aloof, humorless reactionary.
 But time has a way of healing the wounds
 inflicted by excessive partisanship.   If the
 commentators of the decade were cruel, the
 historians  of the century will be kinder.
 Before his death he became a living example
 of the truth of the words Sophocles wrote
 2,000 years ago.  "One must wait until the
 evening to see how splendid the day has
 been."
 His legion of friends can be forever grate-
 ful that Herbert Hoover was one of those
 rare leaders who lived to hear the over-
 whelming  favorable verdict of history  on
 his public career.
 No words can add luster to the special
 place he has earned in the h

 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 16, 1965
 Mr. LIPSCOMB,   Mr.  Speaker,  on
 August 10, 1965, former Vice President
 Richard M. Nixon delivered a commemo-
 rative speech in West Branch, Iowa, as
 part of his tribute to one of our greatest
 Americans, former President Herbert
 Hoover. This remarkable address beau-
 versity will be an everlasting example to
 those who would achieve greatness.  A lesser
 man would have lashed back at his critics.
 But, Herbert Hoover was one of those unique
 individuals who was capable of great anger
 against corruption, brutality, and evil but
 never against people.
 His serenity, in the face of the most brutal
 attacks, in the end made his detractors seem
 like pygmies and allowed his fellow Ameri-
 cans to see even more clearly the great char-
 acter of the giant who walked among them.
 To limit my remarks on this occasion to
 a discussion of his achievements would cer-
 tainly be appropriate. But the highest trib-
 ute a nation can pay to one of its great men
 is to honor his principles in the adoption of
 national policy.  In that spirit, let us test
 our policy in Vietnam against the foreign
 policy principles of Herbert Hoover.     -

 It would be presumptuous to say what
 position he would take on Vietnam if he were
 alive today.  But the principles which would
 guide him in making that decision ring out
 true and clear from the record of his public
 statements.
 Speaking at the Republican Convention in
 Chicago in 1944, he said:
 "We want to live in peace.
 "We want no territory.
 "We want no domination over any nation.
 "We want the freedom of nations from the
 domination of others.
 "We want it both in the cause of freedom
 and because there can be no lasting peace if
 enslaved people must ceaselessly strive and
 fight for freedom."
 There was  no fuzzymindedness in his
 analysis of the cold war.  To him the choice
 between communism and freedom was crys-
 tal clear.  He said: "The world is divided by
 opposing concepts of life.  One is good, the
 other is evil."
 Yet, while he hated the Communist idea
 the great humanitarian had no hatred for
 the Russian people.  It was his leadership
 after World War I which-helped feed and save
 the lives of millions of Russian children.
 In summary, the principles which Herbert
 Hoover would apply in making a foreign
 policy decision could be summed up in one
 sentence.  He wanted peace, freedom, non-
 intervention, self-determination, and prog-
 ress for all peoples and all nations.
 America's critics at home and abroad con-
 tend that our policy at. Vietnam is diametri-
 cally opposed to every one of these principles.
 They contend that America is intervening
 in a civil war.
 They contend that we are fighting a losing
 battle to perpetuate white colonialism in
 Asia.
 They contend that we are on the side of
 reaction, resisting the forces of change and
 progress.
 .  They contend that we are increasing the
 danger of world war III.
 Even among the majority  of Americans
 who support our policy too many seem to
 believe that we had no business getting in-
 volved in Vietnam in the first place and that
 all we can hope or try to do is to make the
 best of a bad situation.
 There is no reason for Americans to be
 defensive or apologetic about our role in
 Vietnam.  We can hold our heads high in
 the  knowledge  that-as  was  the  case  in.
 World War I, World War II, and Korea-we
 are fighting not just in the interests of
 South Vietnam or of the United States but
 for peace, freedom, and progress for all
 peoples.
 This is not a case of American intervention
 in a civil war.  We are helping South Viet-
 nam resist Communist intervention.
 We are not attempting to impose American
 colonialism in Vietnam. We are there to pre-
 vent Communist colonialism'and to preserve
 the  rights  of  self-determination  without
 outside intervention for the people of South
 It is true because, if aggression is rewarded
 those who advocate the hard line in Peiping
 and Moscow will have won the day over those
 who favor peaceful coexistence, and we shall
 be confronted with other Vietnams in Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America.
 It is true because, if the Communists gain
 from their  aggression in  Vietnam,  all  of
 southeast Asia would come under Commu-
 nist domination, and we would have to fight
 a major war to save the Philippines.
 A crucial issue is being decided in Viet-
 nam: Does the free world have an answer
 to the Communist tactic of taking over a
 free country not by direct attack as in Korea,
 not by winning a free election, but by fo-
 menting and supporting a revolution?   If
 this tactic proves unsuccessful in Vietnam,
 the steady Communist march to world dom-
 ination will be halted.  If it succeeds, the
 Communists will have the green light for
 conquest by support of revolution all over
 the world, and we will be helpless to stop it.
 This is one of those critical turning points
 in history.  Today Russia and Red China are
 not allies.  Red China without Russia is a
 fourth-rate military power with no signifi-
 cant nuclear capability.  Five years from now
 the two Communist giants may have patched
 up  their  differences. Even  if  they  have
 failed to do so, Red China will then have a
 dangerous nuclear capability.
 Time, therefore, is not on our side.    If
 the Communist aggressors are not stopped
 now, the risk of stopping them later will be
 infinitely greater.
 Too much of the discussion on Vietnam
 has been in the dreary terms of day-to-day
 tactics, of targets to be hit or excluded, of
 the cost involved.
 It is time for all Americans to raise their
 eyes proudly to the great goals for which we
 are fighting in Vietnam.
 We are fighting in Vietnam to prevent
 world war III.
 We are fighting for the right of self-deter-
 mination for all nations, large and small.
 We are fighting to save free Asia from
 Communist domination.
 We are fighting for the right of all people
 to enjoy progress through freedom.
 We are fighting to prevent the Pacific from
 becoming a Red sea.
 To achieve these goals, Americans must be
 united in their determination not to fail the
 cause of peace and freedom in this period of
 crisis.
 The noisy minority which constantly talks
 of the need to make concessions to the Com-
 A4541
 must insist that where the security of the
 United States is directly threatened by inter-
 national  Communist  aggression,  the  final
 policy decision must be made by the United
 States and not by the United Nations.
 We respect the views of nations who choose
 to remain neutral in the struggle between
 communism and freedom.  But in evaluating
 those views let us remember that no nation
 in  the  world  could  afford  the luxury of
 neutrality if it were not for the power of the
 United States.
 The struggle will be long.  The cost will
 be great.  But the reward will be victory over
 aggression and a world in which peace and
 freedom will have a better chance to survive.
 Herbert Hoover's record gives us guidance
 also with regard to our future policy when
 peace finally comes in Vietnam.
 The man who hated communism helped
 save the lives of millions of Russian people
 living under communism after World War I.
 The man who hated dictatorship set up
 the Committee for Small Nations to aid the
 people forced to live under Hitler's dictator-
 ship in World War II.
 Herbert Hoover took a dim view of trade
 or aid programs which might strengthen the
 power of dictatorial governments over their
 people.  That is why he insisted that Ameri-
 can aid to the starving Russian people be
 administered not by the Communist govern-
 ment but by the American Relief Adminis-
 tration which he headed.
 We must continue to step up our air and
 sea attacks on North Vietnam until the Com-
 munist leaders stop their aggression against
 South Vietnam.  But completely consistent
 with that policy would be the establishment
 now of an American Committee To Aid the
 People of North Vietnam.
 What I am suggesting is not a govern-
 ment-to-government program which would
 simply strengthen the domination of the
 Communist Government of North Vietnam
 over the people o that unhappy country but
 a people-to-people program.  The American
 people, through contributions to such a
 committee, would send to the people of
 North Vietnam food, medicine, clothing, and
 her materials which would help them re-
 cover from the devastating destruction of
 war.
 If the government of North Vietnam raised
 objections to allowing an American agency
 to administer the program, the distribution
 of supplies could be undertaken by an in-
 dependent agency like the International Red
 munist aggressors in order to gain peace are           Certainly a program of this type would be
 defeating the very purpose they claim to               in the great humanitarian tradition of Her-

 1960 It had been victim of a legislative jam

 With reintroduction in the House and Sen-

 The report outlined the effectiveness and

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. KARL E. MUNDT
 OF SOUTH DAKOTA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Monday, August 16, 1965
 Mr. MUNDT.                             Mr. President, unani-
 mous committee approval in the House
 of the Freedom Academy bill has stimu-
 lated greatly expanded Interest in and
 support for the Inauguration of this
 badly needed program for training Amer-
 ica's peacetime operatives in the cold war.
 Likewise, our continuing problems in
 Vietnam provide a daily reminder of the
 deficiencies involved in a national pro-
 gram which relies too greatly on guns
 and bombs, on blood and bullets, to win
 enduring victories which cannot be ob-
 tained without a sharply revised and
 reenforced approach to the problems
 of training our friends in South Vietnam
 on the important and imperative tech-
 niques required to maintain a stable,
 sound, and strong civilian government
 capable of preserving the victories won
 in a shooting war.
 South Dakota, newspapers have with
 great unanimity expressed their ap-
 proval of the Freedom Academy ap-
 proach and I ask unanimous consent that
 there appear in the Appendix of the
 RECORD a recent editorial from the Aber-
 deen, S. Dak., American News under the
 heading  of  "Freedom  Academy  Bill
 Advancing."
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 FREEDOM ACADEMY BILL ADVANCING
 South Dakotans, aware of the merits of
 the Freedom Academy proposal that has
 ferred to as nonmilitary, political, unconven-
 tional, total, or fourth-dimensional warfare,
 protracted  conflict,  etc.  ?  * * Communist
 capabilities in this new type of warfare are
 the result of a massive development and
 training program which began decades ago,
 in secret, conspiratorial meeting and has
 been continued in and through a vast net-
 work of so-called political warfare or political
 training schools.
 "The challenge to the United States and
 its allies today is not to atomize the military
 installations and capital cities of world com-
 munism.  Rather, It Is to meet the Commu-
 nists on all fields of battle in this new form
 of warfare and emerge victorious in order
 that nuclear war may be prevented *  ?  S.

 on the front which ? * * could be as decisive
 as the military front * * ?.  fit. is essential
 that a thoroughgoing program of research,
 education, and training in the area of Com-
 munist political warfare be established."
 Developments In world affairs since Sena-
 tor MUNDT started his campaign for the Free-
 dom Academy bill should strengthen the
 support for it.
 Many Americans would like to see Congress
 approve the bill without further delay.
 Military Construction Appropriation Bill,
 1966
 HON. JULIA BUTLER HANSEN
 OF WASHINGTON
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, August 10, 1965
 The House In Committee of the Whole
 House on the State of the Union had under
 consideration the bill (H.R. 10323) making
 appropriations for military construction for
 the Department of Defense for the fiscal
 year ending June 30, 1966, and for other
 purposes.
 Mrs. HANSEN of Washington.  Mr.
 Chairman, last November the Depart-
 ment of Defense announced closure of
 several bases. Among them was an Air
 Force radar station at Naselle In Pacific
 County in my congressional district in
 the State of Washington.
 The contemplated closure of this 13-
 year-old Naselle air base will remove
 from Pacific County 180 military and 20
 civilian workers and their families with
 a payroll of more than $1 million-about
 8 percent of the annual nonfarm in-
 come.
 Estimates indicate that about 350 per-
 sons will be affected. Naselle School Dis-
 trict will lose 81 students and undoubt-
 edly also will lose Federal payments for
 their education as other school districts
 have lost such funds when defense bases
 have been deactivated.
 Total population of :Pacific County in
 1964 was approximately 14,000 and the
 loss of the personnel now manning and
 serving Naselle Radar Station will mean
 that a substantial percentage of the
 population will be lost to this area.
 For many years Pacific County has
 been one of the depressed areas under
 the criteria developed by the Area Re-
 development Administration.  On Feb-
 ruary 1, the unemployment rate was ap-
 proximately 17 percent.. It has not risen
 above that mark for more than a few
 months in the last decade. Thus, the
 significance of the radar site at Naselle
 to the economic health of the community
 is readily apparent.
 The Air Force invested considerable
 money in this installation.  It must be
 presumed that  its technicians  knew
 what they were doing when in 1950 this
 base was built as an aircraft control and
 warning installation on top of a 2,000-
 foot mountain at a cost; of about $6 mil-
 lion.  -These  technicians  must                                                                                                   have
 known also what they were doing when
 an additional $650,000 was invested to
 convert the equipment to a SAGE heavy
 radar site.
 Again, the Air Force technicians must
 have known what they were doing when
 in 1962 a further sum of $72,000 was
 invested in an improved communications
 system which was placed in service on
 November 15, 1962.
 Further confidence in the Naselle site
 was evidenced by the Air Force when in
 1963. the Naselle site was selected as a
 key link in the improved communica-
 tions system now being built by the Air
 Force.
 At this time, we should be reminded,
 also, that this Naselle Air Radar Station
 has an outstanding record. It has been
 operating when others in the immediate
 vicinity had broken down or in some
 way had failed to carry out their in-
 tended mission.
 Consistently, the efficiency of the base
 has ranked high among similar installa-
 tions.

 ing like passengers on a bus whose driver

 Considering the speed wl which this

 can also be reasonably said that the
 questions raised by this editorial have
 not been fully considered.  In addition,.
 the magnitude of the commitment to
 Vietnam is a new element that must be
 weighed into any discussion of legisla-
 tion which will increase expenditures.
 Before Congress is asked to expand or
 create new legislation in these areas it
 was recommended that the questions
 raised by this editorial be given utmost
 consideration.
 Under leave to extend my remarks, I
 submit the editorial for inclusion in the
 RECORD:
 GREAT SOCIETY BLUEPRINT NEEDED
 When President Johnson signed the $7.5
 billion housing.bill Tuesday, he promised
 still further steps to "lift off the conscience
 of our affluent Nation the shame of slums
 and squalor, and the blight of deterioration
 and decay."
 His remarks were directed to housing and
 urban renewal,  but  they  also reflect Mr.
 Johnson's broader determination that this
 year's harvest of Great Society legislation is
 only the first installment.
 Presidential task forces are already out
 scouting for ideas on what problems should
 become the next targets of concern by a
 benevolent Washington.
 When Mr. Johnson speaks of building a
 better America, one in which the poor and
 disadvantaged can increasingly share, he is
 stating goals to which all compassionate
 citizens can subscribe.
 Alleviation of America's great social prob-
 lems, however, is a matter of the -head as
 well as the heart.  And we can't help feel-
 ing like passengers on a bus whose driver
 Is vague on just where he's going, but is hell-
 bent to get there.
 After years of argument reaching back into
 the New Deal, medicare and Federal aid to
 education have been voted into law.  Enact-
 ment of rent subsidies, and creation of the
 Job Corps and related programs, mark an
 unprecedented enlargement of Federal re-
 sponsibilities.
 Now the President is promising more of
 the same, while searching out new programs
 to make America a more pleasant, as well as
 more universally prosperous, place to live.
 The Times has given qualified support to
 most components of President Johnson's war
 on poverty, and we applaud his efforts to lift
 up the quality of American life.
 However,  aside  from  the  question . of
 whether some of these activities are better
 left to the States and cities, we are bothered
 by the atmosphere of haste, and the lack of
 any clear idea of just what Mr. Johnson's
 Great Society will look like when it's com-
 pleted.
 Does the President intend for medicare
 coverage to be extended later to lower age
 groups?  (No one knows now what the pres-
 ent measure will cost.);
 What is the measure of inadequate hous-
 ing? Since there will always be some people
 who have poorer housing than others, at
 what point does the rent subsidy program
 stop?
 Politics being what it is, it is naive to ex-
 pect answers to these questions and others.
 But surely this is a time for consolidation
 rather than motion for motion's sake.

 for funds to a degree still to be determined.

 HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 16, 1965
 Mr. YOUNGER.  Mr. Speaker, it is
 most interesting to find that gradually
 the newspapers are beginning to criticize
 some of the actions of this administra-
 tion in order that their readers may have
 an opportunity to see both sides of these
 questions. Friday evening in the Wash-
 ington Star James J. Kilpatrick sets
 forth a situation concerning one of our
 Indian tribes and what the Secretary of
 the Interior has in mind in promoting
 public power to the disadvantage of the
 Indians.
 On July 29th the Portland Oregonian
 had an editorial entitled "Hazard of Ly-
 ing," which is most interesting.  These
 two articles follow:
 [From the Washington Star]
 IS UDALL SCALPING THE INDIANS?
 (By James J. Kilpatrick)
 Getting back to Stewart Udall:
 In June, the Secretary of the Interior dis-
 tinguished himself, if that is the right verb,
 by filing with the Federal Power Commission
 one of the most remarkable petitions for
 intervention ever filed with that body.  His
 object is to prevent the Duke Power Co. from
 investing its own money, to build its own
 dams, on its own property in South Carolina;
 his idea is to compel the company to rely
 instead upon a Federal power project on the
 Savannah River-a project that may never
 be authorized at all.  ?
 In July, the Secretary did it again.  This
 time his target is the Montana Power Co. and
 the circumstances here are more outrageous
 still.  Udall's object in Montana, unless he
 has     changed  his   mind  in  the  last  8
 months, is to prevent the construction of two
 dams on the Flathead River in the Flathead
 Indian Reservation, in order to keep alive
 his    ambition to see the   Knowles  project
 built with Federal funds.
 The  controversy in    Montana,     stemming
 from development of the 'Columbia River
 Basin, is of ancient vintage.
 Briefly, the facts are that the Army Engi-
 neers want to build for the Bureau of Rec-
 lamation  a.  high-level                                                                          storage      'dam  at
 Knowles, in the northwestern corner of the
 State.  The structure is a power project;
 virtually no benefits are claimed for flood
 control or recreation.   While only 256,000
 kilowatts would be generated at the site,
 the dam's  usefulness  in regulating water
 flow would firm- up the capacities of other
 structures downstream.   In testimony  be-
 fore a House committee in June of 1963,
 Udall strongly endorsed the project.   The
 Senate, under the urging of MIKE MANSFIELD,
 went along with him; but the House repudi-
 ated the venture overwhelmingly in Decem-
 ber 1963.
 Opponents of the Knowles project made a
 solid case.  The dam would cost somewhere
 between $273 million and $325 million, with-
 out counting payments that would have to
 be made to th
 ff
 A4551
 tax rolls, flood 9,000 acres of irrigated farm-
 land, inundate a part of the famed National
 Bison Range, displace 1,300 persons, and re-
 quire the relocation of 35 miles of railroad
 and 115 miles of highway.  By the most con-
 servative  estimates,  the                                                                                                                                   project's  annual
 costs would be $11 million, its annual reve-
 nues only $2.3 million.  Conceivably, the an-
 nual losses could run much higher-in the
 neighborhood of $12 to $14 million a year, or
 $1.24 billion over the. Army Engineers' 100-
 year estimated life.
 Fifteen months passed.  In Marclr of this
 year, the Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the
 Flathead Reservation, in conjunction with
 Montana Power Co., flied an unprecedented
 application with the FPC. They themselves
 proposed to build the two alternate dams
 on the Flathead River, on sites that would
 be flooded if Knowles were ever built.  These
 two run-of-the-river dams would cost only
 $42  million;  they would generate    240,000
 kilowatts; guaranteed revenue from sale of
 the power to the Montana Power Co. would
 pay off the indebtedness and produce an in-
 come to the tribe of at least $250,000 a year.
 Only a handful of persons would be dis-
 placed.  Jobs would be created during con-
 struction for 300 men.  And annual taxes
 would be created of $2,772,000.
 On July 28 Udall intervened, with  the
 evident purpose  of stopping the Indians'
 venture in private capital and self-help.
 One final note: These Indians are Udall's
 wards.  He has the fiduciary responsibility
 for protecting their rights under a treaty
 dating from 1855.  But wearing his other
 hat, as boss of the Bureau of Reclamation,
 he proposed to compel them to give up a
 large part of their reservation, to accept un-
 stated compensation for the flooding that
 would be caused by Knowles, and to sacrifice
 the substantial income that would result
 from  the  Montana  Power  Co.  contract.
 This is power madness.  It is a cruel scalping
 of the Indians-and of the taxpayers, too.

 As this newspaper said at the time, no one
 believed that Averell Harriman, the durable
 troubleshooter for American Presidents, had
 gone to Moscow for a vacation, as he and the

 What purpose was served by this fiction
 we are unable to discern.  The State Depart-
 ment now has admitted that it paid the
 expenses of its Ambassador at large, not only
 on his visit to Moscow but on his trips to
 other European capitals.   As well it should,
 inasmuch as Mr. Harriman was sent to these
 capitals to discuss Vietnam and-related prob-
 lems with Soviet and other national leaders.
 It is irritating, frustrating and harmful to
 public confidence that official Washington-

 to  evasions,  distortions  and  outright lies
 when no national security purpose is served
 thereby.  Americans may ask, if the admin-

 something really   j;al?

 uation are the subject of editorial com-
 ment in the July 29 issue of the Honolulu
 Advertiser, one of the leading newspa-
 pers in Hawaii.
 Pointing out that there are no "good"
 alternatives, the editor of the Honolulu
 daily expresses the belief that the course
 the President has decided upon is keep?-
 ing hope alive for successful peace talks.
 I commend for thoughtful reading by
 all the.. Honolulu Advertiser's editorial,
 which follows:
 VIETNAM: THE DECISION
 It's been said many times there are no
 good alternatives in Vietnam.  And once
 again President Johnson has chosen the best
 of them.
 His decision is, in effect, to pursue more
 of the same.  This involves holding the line
 with more troops to prevent a disastrous
 defeat  while pursuing  peace  talks  even
 harder.
 There are many important fine points in-
 volved in the Vietnam situation.  But es-
 sentially the other alternatives to the Presi-
 dent's decision were:
 also lead to some private actions not dis-  which were showered on former Vice Presi-
 cussed at the press conference.)                                                                                               dent Richard Nixon when he visited  the
 week, In which he argues for a defensive
 strategy as announced by the President yes-
 terday.  He says :
 "We must  not  fool  ourselves,  however,
 about the probable consequences of a deci-
 sion to adopt a defensive strategy.
 "It would be a signal to the South Viet-
 namese that the time has come for them
 to move toward peace negotiations with their
 fellow Vietnamese.
 "They would be on notice that we shall re-
 main to defend them from personal disaster,
 but that they must not count upon us to win
 for them the war they have not been able,
 with immense assistance from us, to win for
 themselves."
 On the basis of experience to date, it is
 hard to be optimistic about a successful out-
 come in Vietnam soon.  It may be a very long
 effort-and the way is still cp'gn for it to lead
 to a major war.
 But the President's decision has also kept
 hope alive.
 A decision to withdraw that would leave
 non-Communist  Vietnamese  without  any
 bargaining power or,support -in the face of
 a victorious Vietcong, or the launching of a
 major effort that might seem to us a holy
 war against Communist expansion but would
 be viewed by many as an American on-
 slaught on Asians.
 The President's decision has something for
 both doves and hawks.  Yet is unlikely to
 satisfy those at the extremes of both posi-
 tions.
 And it must be admitted that the action
 he outlined-taken after a week of intensive
 conferences,--continues a policy that has not
 worked well so far.
 Despite all efforts to date, the Communists
 have continued both to win the war and
 reject  what  the  President  says  are  "13
 peace offensives" he has launched.
 But, if present policy is continuing, it is
 hoped the intensified efforts will produce
 results.
 On the military front, the basic job is still
 to prevent further Vietcong gains, and to
 spore up the South Vietnamese military.
 The President called  a new buildup to
 125,000 combat troops a "carefully measured".
 response.   However, most reports  Indicate
 this figure will have to go higher if any kind
 of line is to be held.
 The negotiations front is equally uncertain,
 and it too may require additional moves be-
 fore there are any results.
 The President said he was launching a drive
 for peace talks that would seek help in the
 United Nations and from any tither source.
 To date the Communists have shown noth-
 ing but quick rejection or silent disdain for
 any third-party efforts.
 Their minimum conditions seem to be a
 halt to the bombings in North Vietnam and
 insistence that we deal with the Vietcong di-
 rectly, instead of the Hanoi regime as we
 have demanded.
 The President did not say anything yester-
 day about a halt to the bombings of the
 north.   But, contrary to what some may
 think, halting the bombings is not a magic
 formula that will produce peace talks.  Pre-
 sumably, it is something we would be glad
 to do, if there was any sign other conditions
 were favorable.
 There was clearly some "give" in the Pre's-
 ident's press conference statement on deal-
 ing with the Vietcong.  He said, in effect, this
 matter should present no problem.
 The next few days or weeks should tell
 whether the chances for peace talks have
 been increased by both the President's public
 statements and any private actions being

 HON. BOB WILSON
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 16, 1965
 Mr. BOB WILSON.  Mr.  Speaker,
 under leave to extend my remarks in
 the RECORD, I include the following
 article from the San Diego Union of
 July 22, 1965:
 POLES ARE KEPT UNAWARE or U.S. AID GIVEN
 THEM
 (By Herbert G. Klein)
 weeks by a tour of Warsaw by former Soviet
 Premier Nikita Khrushchev.  For the, latter
 visit, Poles were ordered out on the street
 and instructe* to throw flowers purchased
 by the Government.
 The American visit was not announced by
 the Polish Government, but it was broad-
 cast by Radio Free Europe.  Almost half a
 million Poles  turned out voluntarily and
 threw flowers until the Nixon car was literally
 full.
 Poles stood on the street cheering and cry-
 ing.  They defied police lines to touch those
 in the American party.
 The demonstration came as a shock to the
 Communist Government.
 In April, the new Soviet leaders, Leonid
 Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin visited Warsaw
 to mark 20 years of Polish-Soviet friendship
 and sign a new treaty.  Again the Soviets re-
 ceived a cold welcome from the Polish people.
 There seems good reason to believe that
 an American visit would have again pro-
 voked great warmth.
 The friendship of the Polish people for the
 United States is not based on foreign aid or
 government negotiation.  Basically, it reflects
 the fact that one out of every four Polish
 families has American relatives.   And the
 hatred of both Russia and Germany still is
 strong in Poland.
 In June, Waladyslaw Gomulka, the veteran
 Communist Party boss, was reelected by a
 99.3 percent vote on a single-slate ballot.
 But he is a tough realist who knows this is
 not a popular mandate.  And in the past
 year he has tightened up government con-
 trol and added restrictjons against the Cath-
 olic Church which he once tolerated.
 It is interesting that, even at this time,
 Gomulka fears a demonstration for an Amer-
 can official.
 In view of this, there is no reason for more
 funds to support a Communist government.
 But there would appear to be an opportunity
 to use the hospital as a propaganda theme
 of hope for the Polish people.
 Our broadcasts should hail the hospital
 as a sign that this nation still hopes the
 Poles eventually will be free of oppression.
 They  should  stress  the refusal  to  allow
 Americans to visit Poland officially.  They
 should offer hope.
 Where there is little else, hope can be a
 big thing.
 In Poland, they tell the story that the
 best way to see Warsaw is to go to the top of
 the Palace of Culture, and then look out at
 the city.
 The Palace of Culture has a Warsaw ver-
 sion of a strip tease in a restaurant in its
 basement and it dominates the area around
 it with its multi-stories.
 It was built by the Soviet Union as a
 so-called friendship gesture in the fifties.
 But most of the Poles look upon its crude
 Russian architecture as a monstrosity.  The
 point of their joke is that only from the top
 of the building can you avoid looking at it.
 Work is just being completed on another
 building which will dominate the landscape
 in the Polish city of Krakow.  But it seems
 likely that there will be no such stories
 about the structure.  It is an $11 million
 ultramodern children's hospital constructed
 with American foreign aid money.
 Although the building was financed en-
 tirely by the United States, the Poles for the
 second time recently vetoed a request by
 Vice President  HUBERT  HUMPHREY  to visit
 their country and dedicate the hospital.
 ThIs'seems like more than a routine veto.
 The United States has given more than
 $1.5 billion in foreign aid to Poland, but over
 the years the Communist government has
 sought to keep this fact hidden from the
 Polish people.
 The Polish excuse for postponing an in-
 vitation to the Vice President was that they
 could not guarantee his safety because of
 resentment over U.S. actions in Vietnam.
 It seems more likely that the Polish Com-
 taken.   (It is important to realize that al-                                         munist government wants to avoid any re-

 The last is a relatively new area for Presi-
 dential leadership. 'But it emerged as a
 crucial area with the development of full-
 scale modern industrialism and came to
 crisis with the great depression-which the
 American people are determined never to
 let happen again.
 Economics has persisted as an area of
 Presidential concern in a society in which
 some critical problems can better be solved
 by  high-level  decisionmakers,  in  Govern-
 ment and business, rather than being left
 to the "marketplace"-or to accident or fate.
 Wherever possible, however, it makes good
 sense to let competition in the marketplace
 and consumers' choices determine economic
 activity.
 How tension helps: One of the great ad-
 vantages of a free society Is that, though
 one respects one's political chief, one must
 not necessarily do what he says.  Business-
 men have a different perspective from gov-
 ernment, and society's ends-"the public
 interest"-may often be best promoted by a
 tension between business and government.
 Tensions and conflicts may be as construc-
 tive for the broad society as within any
 single organization.
 But they may sometimes become destruc-
 tive. The endless problem, within an organi-
 sation or society as a whole, is to find a
 balance-to permit tensions, but set limits
 un +conflict lest it become ruinous.
 Role for business: The problems of avoid-
 ing excessive power for the business corpora-
 tion are as worthy of concern as Is limiting
 the power of government.  There are inher-

 tution today. Labor unions in many respects
 provide a useful check on the power of both

 groups,    universities,  foundations, profes-
 atonal  organizations,               racial      and religious
 .groups, even family.
 The corporation may unavoidably be in-
 volved In moral issues, but it cannot presume
 to replace the churches, or the conscience of
 the, individual. Nor can the corporation be
 mother and father to its employees.  A free
 society is a pluralistic society-one in which
 no one institution (or one political party)
 can be all-powerful and controlling.
 Yet businessmen today are increasingly
 coming to understand that they do have con-
 siderable power and that they can play-as
 heads of huge organizations-a major role
 in shaping the fortunes of a free society.

 man               of  International  Business  Machines

 "Government  controls  have slowly en-

 U.S. Industry is less fettered than any other

 that is what 'social responsibility' means-
 it is a way of avoiding direct Government

 South Vietnam.  We seek an end to ag-
 gression, and the achievement of an hon-
 orable.peace. It is our country's respon-
 sibility and duty to' be in Vietnam, and
 this is what President Johnson made
 plain to the Nation.
 The article follows:
 L.B.J. MAKES POLICY PLAIN ON VIETNAM
 (By William S. White)
 WASHINGTON.-As the fog of war thickens
 over Vietnam, other fogs of quite different
 ilk are lifting here at home.  The national
 atmosphere is burned free of a great deal of
 vaporous nonsense.
 No longer can it be denied by any respon-
 sible public official or private man that the
 most vital American interests are involved In
 this struggle against Asian Communist ag-
 gression.  If 125,000 American troops In Viet-
 nam are not enough to give somber refuta-
 tion to this sort of pettifogging, there is in
 addition the solemn declaration of the Pres-
 ident of the United States: "This is really
 war."
 No longer can it be suggested by any re-
 sponsible American that this country is
 somehow unreasonably refusing to negotiate
 with a Communist invader who a score of
 times has scorned any honorable discus-
 sion-and still does.
 No longer can it be suggested by any re-
 sponsible American that the purposes and
 motives of the United States in Asia are
 somehow hidden and tricky and that the
 people of the United States, are terribly,
 terribly confused.
 The position of the Government of the
 United States has, in President Johnson's
 address to the Nation by way of his press
 conference, again and for the umpteenth
 time been made plain as the noonday sun.
 We are determined to honor the pledges of
 three American Presidents to the people of
 South Vietnam.  We seek no melodramatic
 total victory.  We seek only an end to ag-
 gression and invasion and a decent peace
 decently guaranteed. But these aims we not
 merely pursue but also demand; and these
 aims we shall achieve, come what might.
 Of all the moonshine sq long spread by
 avowedly liberal splinters in the Senate and
 House,  none has been more  persistently
 spread than the claim that American aims
 are somehow tricky and that the American
 public is somehow in the dark.  If Ameri-
 can aims in fact suffer for credibility, It is
 from their simplicity and-yes-their hon-
 esty and altruism in a world where pseirdo-
 sophisticates are forever on the lookout for
 the gimmick and the clever phrase to mask
 candid Intentions.
 As to the American public, there has not
 been the smallest objective evidence of con-
 fusion as to what this Nation is about in
 Asia.  Every national poll has clearly shown
 that the people know quite well what we are
 about and that while, of course, they are not
 madly gay about it, they fully recognize its
 necessities.
 To this, this columnist can add a personal
 note.  In a 2 weeks' absence from Wash-
 ington "but in the country" it seemed plain
 that tIle only people really confused are that
 minority of breat beaters in Congress who
 profess confusion to avoid facing up to the
 truth that we are in Vietnam simply because
 it is our duty to be there as the leader and
 guardian of the free world,
 There is a time for the fullest debate and
 for the longest and most pompous teach-ins.
 And these, heaven knows, we have had in full
 measure.  Then there is a time for a halt to
 logic-chopping and  emotionalized appeals
 for a "peace" that would mean surrender
 and betrayal of our responsibilities on this
 earth.  This time has now arrived.  For now
 the United States of America is at war.
 Public Works and Economic Development
 Act of 1965
 SPEECH
 HON. JOSEPH G. MINISH
 OF NEW JERSEY
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 11, 1965
 The House in Committee of the Whole
 House on the State. of the Union had under
 consideration the bill (S. 1648) to provide
 grants for public works- and development
 facilities, gther financial assistance and the
 planning and coordination needed to allevi-
 ate conditions of substantial and persistent
 unemployment  and  underemployment  in
 economically distressed areas and regions.
 Mr. MINISH. Mr. Chairman, I should
 like to express my support of the Public
 Works and Economic Development Act
 of 1965 and urge its passage.
 This act provides needed sources of
 financial aid for helping certain local
 areas in their efforts to attract and stim-
 ulate private industries.
 This legislation will help to achieve
 the goals set forth in the President's
 state of the Union message:
 Our basic task is threefold: to keep our
 economy growing; to open for all Americans
 the opportunity that is now enjoyed by most
 Americans; and to improve the quality of
 life for all.
 The programs provided by this act
 represent an investment in a better,
 stronger America.  These are not pro-
 grams for giveaways-these are pro-
 grams for hope.
 The Area Redevelopment and Accel-
 erated Public Works programs, the fore-
 runners of this legislation now before
 us, demonstrated the effectiveness of a
 broad scale attack on t>ge problems of
 areas of economic stress. I know from
 personal experience how valuable the
 Area Redevelopment Act program has
 been to Newark, N.J., in its determined

 ertyrights of their owner stockholders. Not
 today.
 "The property rights in question today are
 those of the active property of the separate
 corporate persons, not the passive stocks of
 the owners.  Pope John XXIII, in his his-
 toric Encyclical Letter Mater et Magistra,
 clearly establishes the role of this right of
 property: '* * *  in the right of private
 property there is rooted a social responsi-
 bility * * ^ the overall supply of goods is
 assigned first of all that all men may lead
 a decent life.'
 "Thus we return to the doctrine of mu.
 tual consent that freedom is a compact be-
 tween men to restrain from so behaving as
 to destroy each other's freedom.  4pplied
 within the corporation, we see that all the
 forces necessary for the continuation of the
 corporation's function, labor, capital, and
 management, are in a compact of mutual
 consent to so act as to respect each other's
 minimum freedoms.
 "The corporation is also in a compact with
 the society which created it.  The society,
 which recognizes the corporation's right to
 private property, will tolerate the private
 ownership of the means of production as
 ].ong as the corporation produces the mini-
 mmum socially and economically needed good.
 "For too long we have hidden the * * *
 dynamic power of our free enterprise system
 to create good, social and economic good,
 under * * * our obsolete theories of busi-
 ness. For too long we have fed ammunition
 to our enemies, the prophets of class war-
 fare, by insisting on the selfish motivations
 of antagonistic classical capitalism, rather
 than preaching the proven success of our
 mutual consent, cooperative free enterprise
 system."
 VIZ. A NEW STRUCTURE-AND NEW LEADERSHIP
 In the American society today, no longer
 is there a simple division between power
 (meaning political authority) and property
 (meaning business interests).  The concept
 of property itself has been drastically modi-
 fied by the rise of the great corporation and
 the wide diffusion of ownership and control
 of the means of production, both through
 financial institutions and through the po-
 litical process.
 Many institutions-labor unions, racial
 and religious groups? the press, scientists and
 intellectuals, as well, as political parties and
 their leaders-have some degree of power
 to influence the course of American life. The
 business corporation clearly does not be-
 stride U.S. society like a top-hatted Wall
 Street banker in a cartoon in Pravda or
 Izvestia.  Yet few would deny it has a cru-
 cial role to play.
 .The ancient cold war between business
 and government is breaking up-on both
 sides.  The new partnership is still in. process
 of evolution.  There is always the possi-
 bility-some  would  say 'probability-that
 it will collapse under fresh political, eco-
 nomic, or social pressures.  Certainly, the
 U.S. business community, which is far from
 unified, does not feel itself committed to any
 one party's, or any one man's, concept of the
 Great Society.
 Yet there are reasons for thinking that
 the kind of restructuring of busine-govern-
 ment power relations that is going on in
 the  United  States  represents  a  genuine
 change in the workings of the system.
 Worldwide: For one thing, what is going
 on in the United States is only a manifesta-
 tion of changes at work in all modern indus-
 trial                  societies throughout   the  world.  As
 Duke University's Calvin B. Hoover puts it:
 "The  experience  of  all  modern    indus-
 trialized societies demonstrates that some
 sort of new 'mix' of the responsibilties and
 functions of ths'state, of economic organiza-
 tions, and of individuals essentially dif-
 ferent from that of capitalism of the past
 is inevitable."
 Every Western democracy is striving to
 discover for itself the means of achieving a
 better  balance between private and public
 responsibilities  in  solving  key  problems.
 There are parallels between the President's
 Council of Economic Advisers and his Ad-
 visory Committee on Labor-Management Re-
 lations, and the new Department of Eco-
 nomic Affairs and the National Economic
 Development Council in Britain, or the Eco-
 nomic- and Social Council in France.
 The U.S. way: No two nations are tackling
 these problems in quite same way.  The
 U.S. Government still plays a less controlling
 role in industy than do governments in other
 countries.  U.S. industry, says Thomas J.
 Watson, Jr.-whose IBM Corp. operates, in
 many countries-is still "less fettered than in
 any other country, by a long, long shot."
 This, he thinks, is a major reason why U.S.,
 industry is so strong and innovative.  U.S.
 industrial success, as he sees it, Is closely
 related to "the speed of the decision process.".
 The willingness of private business volun-
 tarily to work with Government is, in Wat-
 son's view and that of a growing. number of
 other business leaders, a way to retain their
 present degree of freedom and to avoid what
 they fear will be inefficient or wrongheaded
 Government controls.
 Formidable: The technical and operating
 problems facing businessmen who would
 measure up to the needs of the time are
 formidable.  They may range from fiscal and
 monetary policy to urban renewal to race
 relations to problems of national defense and
 the uses of outer space-and, of course, a
 knowledge of how to run their own busi-
 nesses successfully in' a period of explosive
 technological change.
 The education of tomorrow's business lead-
 ers will have to offer better preparation for
 such a wide range of problems than the edu-
 cation-and experiences-afforded the pres-
 ent generation of business leaders.
 Models:  Some business leaders of today,
 however, do provide models of how to serve
 the interests of private business and the
 broad society.  One such man Is Robert A.
 Lovett-banker, World War I Navy hero,
 World War II public official, Secretary of De-
 fense under President Truman, and a lead-
 ing candidate for inclusion in the mythical
 "U.S. establishment."
 Says Lovett: "The corporation should not
 seek to replace public authority.  Yet the
 corporation is endowed with the public in-
 terest--a bit.  It is created by the state, and
 it must be responsible * *  *.
 Democracy, Lovett adds, requires that free-
 dom be coupled with restraint.  There is no
 simple formula for this, he concedes, but
 says: "I can't believe that there is not enough
 wisdom or wit in this country so that we
 can handle our problems within a context of
 freedom."
 There is growing support within the U.S.
 business community for such views.
 VIII. THE HARD CHOICE THAT FACES BUSINESS
 It is becoming clear that what U.S. busi-
 ness faces today is a set of choices on the
 role it is to play in relation to the broad
 society.  Business cannot avoid the necessity
 of choice, because the modern corporation
 has become the towering institution of to-
 day's society-and the problems of society
 have become its problems as well.
 The society is demanding the achievement
 of'a great many national objectives-national
 security (which inescapably involves the cor-
 poration),  maximum  employment,  racial
 equality, rising living standards (especially
 for groups left behind in the growth race),
 improved education, better medical care, a
 healthier urban environment, the safeguard-
 ing of natural resources.
 Two roads: In attempting to achieve those
 ends, which involve overlapping business and
 Government functions and responsibilities,
 there are two basic choices:
 To increase the role of Government and,
 where business is concerned, to make greater
 A4565
 use of coercion or fiat to bring about the kind
 of business behavior desired.
 To seek to develop more fruitful, voluntary
 cooperation between business and Govern-
 ment.
 Either approach has obvious dangers.
 The first may involve excessive centraliza-
 tion of power in the Government, posing gen-
 uine threats to the freedom and efficiency of
 business, and to society itself.
 The second may be too loose and uncer-
 tain, and can. scarcely avoid the problem of
 sanctions against "chiselers," or simply hard-
 pressed businesses that are not able to meas-
 ure up to the standards of social responsi-
 bility  assumed  by  large  and  prosperous
 corporations.
 No "either-or": But the choice is not a
 simple either-or decision.
 Indeed, the success or failure of the volun-
 tary approach in particular areas will largely
 determine whether the coercive role of Gov-
 ernment is to be closely limited or greatly
 expanded.
 And how far government intervenes in the
 economy or in social relations will depend
 heavily on its ability to create conditions
 making for a healthy and growing over-all
 economy.
 There are two reasons to hope that, thanks
 to progress in the understanding and use of
 fiscal and monetary policy by government,
 the detailed decisions on production, dis-
 tribution, employment, location of industry,
 and such matters can on the whole be
 handled by business on its own.   .
 Yet specific problems have emerged-and
 others will continue to develop-that require
 business and government cooperation, or leg-
 islative solution.
 Today, some of these issues involve col-
 lective bargaining and strike threats in key
 industries, the Nation's balance of payments,
 race relations, unemployment, poverty, urban
 decay.  What specifically the critical issues
 of the future will be no one can know for
 sure.
 Cautions: Just as they do today, view-
 points in the future are bound to differ on
 the gravity or nature of particular problems
 and on how to deal with them.  These view-
 points will be colored in part by the inter-
 ests of the parties that are involved and
 by their ideologies-including Interests and
 ideologies of government officials and their
 academic or other allies, as well as those of
 business.
 That means it will be vitally important to
 guard, on the one hand, against the notion
 that "the public Interest" is always best de-
 fined and understood by public officials. The
 power of the state, as Calvin B. Hoover warns,
 "cannot  automatically  be  assumed  to  be
 wielded in the public interest."
 On a host of matters, businessmen must be
 free to make their own decisions, or society
 will suffer.  They should not-as one of them
 recently told the President--be treated "like
 children."
 At the sahhie time, some businessmen point
 out, it cannot automatically be assumed that
 whatever  the President, or other govern-
 ment policyrnakers, propose is damaging to
 business  interests.  Frederick  R.  Kappel,
 chairman of American Telephone & Tele-
 graph Co., in thinking back. over the forces
 that prompted the growth of his own giant
 corporation, has stressed that one of the
 most essential factors-besides technical in-
 novation  and  entrepreneurial  drive-was
 "the public consensus, the political deci-
 sion."
 Leadership and economics: The U.S. sys-
 tem puts heavy responsibility on the Federal
 Government, and the President in particular;
 and the American people have come to ex-
 pect Presidents to exert leadership whenever
 and wherever national problems are serious-
 whether in matters of national defense, for-
 eign  affairs,  race relations,  or  economic
 affairs.

 of the Chicago Tribune, has

 written an excellent article in today's
 edition of the Tribune which outlines
 In considerable detail the return of ma-
 jor airline operations to Chicago's Mid-
 way Airport.
 This should be good news to millions
 of Americans who have, during the past
 few months, suffered considerable delays
 In both arriving and departing from
 Chicago's- O'Hare Field, now `operating
 at peak capacity.
 I am sure this will also be welcome
 news to the Members of Congress who
 use Chicago as a transfer point on their
 trips to and from their respective dis-
 tricts.  The resumption of major air-
 line operations at Midway, which has
 been almost deserted since 1962 when
 the airlines moved most of their opera-
 tions to O'Hare, is a major victory for
 Mayor Richard Daley.
 It has been the mayor's persistent and
 untiring negotiations with the major air-
 lines which today brings within sight of
 reality the reopening of Midway to ma-
 jor airline traffic.  Mayor Daley long ago
 realized that Chicago had to have two
 major airports to serve the airlines of
 America if Chicago was to continue as
 the transportation center of the world.
 With the development of O'Hare, most
 of the major airlines shifted. their op-
 erations from Midway in the late-1950's
 and early 1960's.  Midway, once the
 world's busiest airport, had to yield that
 title to O'Hare during the past 3 years.
 O'Hare Field today handles in excess of
 1,400  flight  operations  daily.  Mr.
 Thomis' excellent article discusses in
 considerable detail the plans that the
 major airlines have to restore major ac-
 tivities at Midway.  Mr. Thomis points
 out that one of the factors in speeding
 resumption of major operations at Mid-
 way is the anticipation that short-run-
 way jets will be permitted by the Federal
 Aviation Agency to operate into and out
 of Washington's National Airport in the
 near future.
 Mr. Speaker, I find particular satis-
 faction in this development, for many
 of my colleagues will recall I had been
 These will include short-range flights to
 the   Southeast,   Florida,   the   Southwest
 through St. Louis and Dallas, the Northwest,
 and the  west coast through  Omaha        and
 Denver.  Both piston-engined and jet air-
 liners will be rescheduled to operate through
 Midway, deserted since 1962.
 GRADUAL SHIFT OF FLIGHTS
 Among the major carriers which are ex-
 pected to provide these services are United
 Air Lines, American Airlines, Trans World
 Airlines, and Northwest Airlines,  Inc.   As
 soon as these large carriers are operating
 from Midway, there will be a gradual shift-
 ing of other flights from the dangerously
 overcrowded ramps and loading gateways at
 O'Hare International Airport, the major jet
 terminal, according to reliable information.
 It is understood that - Mayor Daley soon
 will announce the "return to Midway" to the
 city council.  This is expected to coincide
 with release of schedules by United Air Lines
 for 18 to 25 daily flights from Midway, about
 5 percent of their total operations at O'Hare
 Field.
 Next in line is expected to be Northwest
 Orient Airlines, which has been parking its
 707, 720, and 727 jets two deep at its O'Hare
 gates in peak traffic periods.  A return to
 Midway with some of Northwest's 727 and
 Electra flights will reduce the pressures at
 O'Hare and broaden the company's Chicago
 market.
 TWA TELLS PLANS
 Trans World Airlines has written the city
 administration  that  it  intends  to  return
 service to Midway Airport, but there are no
 details.  TWA has 727 jets-fully approved
 for Midway and in twice daily service there
 by United Air Lines for more than a year-
 and can offer New York, Kansas City, Phila-
 delphia, and west coast trips from Midway.
 American  Airlines  management,  which
 spearheaded the air carrier opposition to
 earlier city efforts to restore services to Mid-
 way, "has softened" toward Midway, theTrib-
 une learned.
 Both American,  with British  111   small
 twinjet planes due for delivery late this year;
 and TWA, with Douglas DC-9 twinjets also
 to be delivered this fall and early in 1966,
 will have equipment ideally suited to 5,000-
 feet  runway  airports.  Midway's                                                                               diagonal
 landing strips are both in the 6,000-feet-
 class.
 FAA STUDY IN WASHINGTON
 Part of the airlines' willingness to return
 to Midway can be traced to the Federal
 Aviation Agency's study of restoring reg-
 ular airline jet services to Washington Na-
 tional  Airport.  Washington  National  is-
 nearer the city, while the newer Dulles field
 and Baltimore's Friendship Airport are far-
 ther away.
 As soon as jet service is restored to Na-
 tional-in September or October, depending
 on results of the study-United will schedule
 727 jets from Chicago, probably from Mid-
 way, Into National airport.
 American Airlines, which has kept Electra
 flights from O'Hare into National, will have
 to met United's service with jets of its own.
 With National open, United is expected
 to exploit Midway, La Guardia in New York,
 Washington's National to the utmost.
 At city hall, officials were told by United
 that the company "never expected to make a
 profit at Midway airport" with the two trips
 to New York and two to Washington it has
 operated for 14 months.

 Mr. GOODELL.                                          Mr. Speaker, I think
 all of the Members will be interested in
 the following interesting column by the
 distinguished Lyle C. Wilson, which ap-
 peared in the Washington Daily News,
 August 12, 1965:
 GOT IT IN THE NECK
 (By Lyle C. Wilson)
 We, the people, got it in the neck last week
 in a lost cause effort to remind President
 Johnson and his Great Society Senators that
 the United States was set up to be a govern-
 ment of the people, for the people, and by
 the people.
 We  got  it  when  these  Senators  voted
 against this American  system.  The  vote
 came on a proposal by Senator EvERETT Mc-
 KINLEY DIRKSEN to submit to a continuing
 vote of the people of each State the question
 whether both houses of its legislature should
 or should not be apportioned according to
 the Supreme Court's remarkable rule that
 population must be the sole determining
 factor.
 The Court ruled last year against appor-
 tionment  of  one  house  on  the  basis  of
 geography or other characteristics not di-
 rectly related to population. In his dissent
 from this rule by Chief Justice Earl Warren
 and the Court majority, Associate Justice
 Felix Frankfurter warned of danger ahead.
 Justice Frankfurter said that if the Federal
 judiciary involved itself in this essentially
 political problem of determining the rela-
 tionship between population and representa-
 tion, it would generate friction and tension
 in Federal-State relations.  That tension and
 friction are now present.
 Senator DIRKSEN'S proposal for a continu-
 ing plebiscite on representation  in each
 State was the American way.   He merely
 sought to appeal the question to the court
 of last resort-the people.  His amendment
 would have' provided:
 That an apportionment plan based on any
 factor other than population would have had
 to be approved by the voters of the State.
 That any monpopulation plan submitted
 to the voters would be accompanied by an
 alternative  plan  substantially  based  on
 equality of population to assure the. voters
 a choice.                                -

 The Ming Quong Children's Center
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. CHARLES S. GUBSER
 OF CAL11PORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 16, 1965
 Mr. GUBSER.      Mr. Speaker, I am
 proud to say that the Ming Quong Chil-
 dren's Center, one of the finest organiza-
 tions dedicated to the assistance of
 mankind and little children in particu-
 lar, is located in the heart of my con-
 gressional district.            -
 The Ming Quong Children's Center In
 Los Gatos, Calif., is cerebrating its 50th
 anniversary  this  year.  Its  purpose
 throughout these years has been to help
 troubled children of California. The old
 Chinese "gate which marks the entrance
 to the center is a symbol of a half -cen-
 tury of this open door policy.
 The Ming Quong Center goes deeply
 into California history.  It grew out of
 a rescue mission home In San Francisco
 for Chinese slave girls who had been
 brought to this country at the turn of the
 century.  The story of the dedicated
 women of the Occidental Board, who
 founded the mission, and Miss Donaldina
 Cameron and her assistants, who ac-
 counted for the rescue of over 1,000 slave
 girls, is one of the West's most exciting
 tales.
 It began in 1915, under its present
 name, as a custodial home for Chinese
 orphans-little girls who had been aban-
 doned with no parents to care for them
 or who were being used as domestic
 drudges.  This was not unusual in the
 old Chinese culture.  Girls had no value
 even for the families which had migrated
 to the United States..
 Ming      Quong-translated  "radiant
 light' -came into being when it was de-
 cided that it was unw;se to house the
 Email girls with the older ones who had
 been former slave girls.  Capt. Robert
 Dollar, of the Dollar Steamship Lines,
 gave them property-which is now part
 of the Mills College campus in Oakland,
 Calif.-for a home for 60. younger girls.
 In 1935 the need was felt to remove the
 girls to warm, sunny Los Gatos as many
 of the children had been exposed to
 tuberculosis and were undernourished.
 The work with both boys and girls con-
 tinued as a mission station of the board
 of national missions of the United Pres-
 byterian Church.
 Today, Ming Quong performs as great
 a service in meeting modern day needs
 as it did 50 years ago. Now it is a resi-
 dential treatment agency for emotion-
 ally disturbed boys and girls of all races
 and creeds. The children live in cottages
 each with its own houseparents.  A
 highly-trained staff of therapist-social
 workers, psychologists and a consulting
 psychiatrist work as a team to solve the
 problems of these unfortunate children
 who are innocent victims of circum-
 stances beyond their control. They also
 work with the parents whenever possible
 to try to solve family problems.
 Ming Quong is now reaching into the
 community to develop all types of com-
 munity support and interest. Churches
 of all faiths Instead of one, now - assume
 their responsibility;  individuals  and
 community groups contribute time and
 talent; volunteer auxiliary   lubs have
 been formed to lend effort &Ad financial
 support.
 Plans for a day treatment center for
 children who do not need residential
 care are under way with the public
 school system working closely with the
 center in organizing special teaching
 programs.
 Ming Quong's first 50 years has been
 dedicated to meeting the needs of the
 times and plans for the years ahead
 promise this same foresighted approach.
 The great old Chinese gate will always
 be open to receive the troubled children
 of California.

 HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 16, 1965
 Mr. MULTER.                                    Mr. Speaker, I com-
 mend to the attention of our colleagues
 the following article by Warren Rogers
 from the August 5, 1965, edition of the
 New York Journal-American.
 United States policy in Vietnam has
 received support from an unexpected
 source.  The Manila Times, generally
 critical of U.S. foreign policy in south-
 east Asia, came up with a strong defense
 of American actions in Vietnam in a re-
 cent article by A. L. Valencia.  Mr.
 Valencia writes in reference to those
 Asians who would have the United States
 withdraw from Vietnam:
 But should not these critics-if they are
 honest men-also concede that their very
 liberty to dissent has depended directly on
 American protection?
 Although some  Asians resent the
 American presence, most Asians know
 that that presence is all that enables
 them to remain free.
 It is encouraging that the people of
 Asia have an understanding of our
 actions in Vietnam, and appreciate the
 objectives for which we are fighting.
 That the people closest to the conflict
 strongly  support  our  policy  should
 strengthen our resolve to stand firm in
 Vietnam.
 The article follows:
 UNrIED  STATES GETS BOUQVET ON VIETNAM
 POLICY
 (By Warren Rogers)
 WASHINGTON.-Prom time to time, It is a
 good idea to take a look at ourselves from the
 outside, to we ourselves as others - see us.
 Sometimes, amid all the brickbats at home
 and abroad, we get thrown a bouquet from
 unexpected sources.
 The Manila Times, which loves to lambaste
 U.S. foreign policy in southeast Asia, has
 done just that.  In a recent article by A. L.
 Valencia,  writing  from  Washington,  the
 Times comes up with a defense of American
 actions In Vietnam which is remarkable for
 its candor and its logic.
 "Among the angry young men of southeast
 Asia," Mr. Valencia writes, "it has become
 fashionable to attack America's actions and
 motives at every turn, and to applaud every
 American misfortune.  To be able to talk
 back to the greatest power on earth is re-
 garded as a badge of courage and patriotism.
 "But should not these critics-if they are
 honest men-also concede that their very
 liberty to dissent has depended directly on
 American protection?
 "If, as a result of shrill demands for
 'Yankee go home,' American power were to
 draw back in the Pacific, the Philippines-
 let's face it-would be virtually defenseless"
 Mr. Valencia then explores the catch phrase
 demanding "Asian solutions to Asian prob-
 lems."  He puts it this way:
 "The world is shrinking so rapidly that
 anybody's problem is everybody's problem.
 If we insist on Asian solution, it will be
 Asian all right, but it is most likely to be
 labeled `Made in Peiping.' "
 Mr. Valencia then notes that India, for all
 its dedication to Asian solutions, was quick
 to accept help from the West when attacked
 by Red China.  Thailand, Laos, Nationalist
 China, Malaysia, Japan, and even Cambodia
 are not less patriotic for depending upon
 American friendship and power to maintain
 their national independence, he argues.
 "To make these statements         is not to
 demean national prides," Mr. Valencia adds,
 "It is merely to stress a decent respect for
 reality."
 And the reality, as he sees it, is that most
 Filipinos and most Asians not under Com-
 munist domination--even though millions
 resent the American presence:-"know that
 that presence is all that enables them to re-
 main free."
 It is good to have such reminders that
 there is some understanding in southeast
 Asia of what the United States is trying to
 do.  Granted that America's efforts are not
 entirely altruistic-is there any American
 who doubts that, if we don't fight there, we'll
 have to fight here?--& great measure of my-
 brother's-keeper philosophy is involved.
 National Drum Corps Week
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. WILLIAM L. ST. ONCE
 OF CONNECTICUT
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, August 16, 1965
 Mr. ST. ONGE. Mr. Speaker, the week
 of August 15 to 22 has been designated
 as National Drum Corps Week in honor
 of the 1 million teenagers in the United
 States who are associated with this
 colorful and wholesome activity.
 On this occasion, I am very happy to
 join with my colleagues in Congress to
 pay tribute to these young people and to
 extend my best wishes to them for their
 participation in this purposeful activity.
 The marching and maneuvering, the
 bugling, and the drumming have right-
 fully been described as "an expression of
 order, color, symmetry, and beauty."
 Certainly this is a clean., interesting
 and inspiring activity for our youth in a
 confused world where youth is struggling
 to find a place for itself and an outlet for
 its zest and energy.  Unfortunately,
 many of our young people fail to find
 worthwhile activities and end up as crim-
 inals and juvenile delinquents.  -

 more bombastic statement than that.
 Unfortunately, this particular arm-chair
 militarist has the title of chairman of a
 powerful committee.
 The President, who is Comander in
 Chief of our Armed Forces, has repeat-
 edly announced his desire and hope that
 representatives of the Vietcong  and
 North Vietnam and other nations meet
 with us at a conference table, that we
 are glad to talk settlement and seek a
 ceasefire.
 He has said time and time again-and
 that is our position at the present time,
 despite the bombast from the gentleman
 from the other body-that we should
 seek negotiations unconditionally, with-
 out any conditions whatsoever.
 Our situation is bad in South Viet-
 nam.  It is far worse than it was a year
 ago or when President Eisenhower first
 committed our Armed Forces in South
 Vietnam.  It is too late now for us to say
 a mistake was. made, because we were
 committed in 1954 and we have been in-
 volved there since that time, and appar-
 ently things have gone from bad to
 worse.
 Despite these statements that should
 never have been made-he said:
 I will insist on victory in Vietnam.  Any-
 thing short of that would be treasonable.
 We Americans seek and hope for a
 negotiated settlement involving major
 concessions by both sides which will of-
 fer the Communists and Vietcong a rea-

 military victory.

 UNTHINKABLE THAT THIS NATION
 WOULD DESTROY  COMMUNIST
 CHINA'S   NUCLEAR INSTALLA-
 7IONS
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President, I
 rise to comment on the statement made
 by the chairman of the Armed Services
 Committee of the House of Representa-
 s In a speech he delivered recently in
 Connecticut.  He  asked a rhetorical
 question
 Should we use our atomic power to wipe
 out Red China's atomic capability?
 Then he added:
 We must get ready to do this very thing
 Owe want to stop Red China. I will insist on
 No. 150--13
 victory In Vietnam.. Anything short of that
 would be treasonable.
 In this same speech the gentleman also
 stated:
 And even if we win the war in South
 Vietnam, I cannot help but think that we
 are merely postponing the final victory of
 Red China unless the Nation Is prepared to
 risk the possible consequences of destroying
 her nuclear capability.  And unless we make
 that decision, it is possible that all of our
 fighting in South Vietnam will have been in
 vain.
 In other words this Member of the
 other body really outdid some hard-
 nosed militarists in our Armed Forces
 who in the past have been advocating
 preemptive war against the Soviet Union
 and in recent months have raised their
 voices advocating a sneak attack or pre-
 emptive war on Red China to destroy the
 crude nuclear installations of the Red
 Chinese. The very suggestion of this is
 so un-American as to be abhorrent.
 Yet, here is a Member of the other body
 occupying the position as chairman of
 one of the most powerful committees in
 that body advocating this procedure.
 Mr. President, the facts are that I am
 a fervent believer in the seniority system.
 It is one of the advantages of our Con-
 gress that under that system, men who
 have served long years in the Senate and
 in the House of Representatives attain
 promotions within the committees of
 which they are members, and finally
 some of them with long years of con-
 gressional service become chairmen of
 committees. By and large, chairmen of
 all the committees of the Senate and
 House of Representatives of the United
 States are eminently respected, are most
 knowledgeable, and deserve the promo-
 tion to chairmen by reason of the expe-
 rience that they have acquired over the
 years.
 Nevertheless, it is somewhat shattering
 to my faith in this seniority system to
 read of the chairman of the Committee
 on Armed Services of the House of Rep-
 resentatives advocating a suicidal policy
 on our part, and I feel obligated to speak
 out against this without delay lest in this
 country and overseas such a rhetorical
 question would be taken seriously.
 That the person making this state-
 ment is chairman of the Committee on
 Armed Services of the other body causes
 me to fear that in Europe and Asia,
 among the heads of states, It might be
 regarded as authoritative and that his
 views are respected and might be fol-
 lowed.  Were we as a nation to under-
 take any such course, we could gain
 nothing except, at most, a very tempo-
 rary advantage and at a great price-
 loss of respect and degradation.
 Now let us consider the facts.  No
 matter what single location or several
 locations we might bomb and utterly de-
 stroy into ashes within the mainland of
 China, that nation-Communist China-
 with its great population, its far-flung
 geographic area, and its scientists and
 scholars would retain the capability of
 very soon again producing even more
 nuclear weapons and far better and more
 powerful than the first crude warheads
 produced there, We should realize that
 19781,
 In this nuclear age of change and chal-
 lenge even a small group of scientists
 are just as valuable or more valuable
 to any nation, to China and to this Na-
 tion, than any existing nuclear installa-
 tions.
 Assuming  that  we  could  destroy
 China's capability for producing nuclear
 weapons for a short time and that we
 did destroy all the existing nuclear in-
 stallations, how could we possible bar or
 prevent the access of the Chinese to the
 raw materials necessary for the produc-
 tion of fissionable nuclear charges? As-
 sume we did hurl our air power over the
 Chinese mainland, as this gentleman
 suggests.  Would we have our Air Force
 attempt to lay waste all of the factories
 that they beheld below them where they
 might suspect that some use was being
 made of raw materials to manufacture
 nuclear bombs?  How could we do that
 anyway when it is readily possible for
 men of intelligence to disperse such in-
 stallations and even locate them in cities
 in the midst of massive centers of popu-
 lation or underground in other sections
 of the country in such manner that our
 bombs could not destroy them?
 Then, above everything else, it would
 riot be possible for us with our missile
 power, air power, and land forces to kill
 all of those individuals who comprehend
 how atomic weapons are made. In other
 words, even now in a preemptive war
 in a day of infamy followed by other
 days of infamy, were we to destroy the
 lives of million of Chinese men, women,
 and children, we could not possibly kill
 off all the scientists.
 I am mentioning this to state how fool-
 hardy the gentleman's proposal is.  Let
 us realize that China is a huge nation
 that has great diversity and a great
 quantity of natural resources; that there
 are 700 million men, women and children
 living within the borders of China; that
 China is a nation with a great history
 and its people have a tradition of being
 industrious.  The Chinese are people of
 high intellectual attainments and busi-
 ness and scientific achievements.  They
 have a great cultural background. It is
 obvious to all that China is now a great
 power and within 10 or 20 years it will
 be one of the three greatest powers on
 the earth.
 We are proud of the American citizens
 we have in our midst, in Hawaii and else-
 where, men, women and children of Chi-
 nese descent.  We have inthis body as a
 U.S. Senator from the sovereign State
 Of Hawaii HIRAM FONG, one of the ablest
 and most respected Members of this
 body, whose father and mother and all
 his ancestors were Chinese and lived in
 China.
 I advert to that fact to indicate an-
 other facet and to indicate how fool-
 hardy that suggestion or rhetorical ques-
 ton was.
 Furthermore, there is nothing Repre-
 sentative RIVERS or anyone else can do to
 stop China's advance.  Even the grossly
 inhumane use of atomic and bacteriolog-
 ical weapons could not do that.  Let us
 hear no more about this rhetorical ques-
 tion.  A proposal to do anything of this
 sort, would be foreign to the American

 people of the United States, whose his-
 tory bears testimony to those moral prin-
 ciples.
 It is not responsive to say, as some do,
 that there is no military solution to the
 problems of South Vietnam.  Everyone
 knows this,  What must be recognized,
 however, is that because of thG intran-
 sigence of the leaders in Hanoi, military
 victory is essential to lay the foundation
 for the political, economic, and psycho-
 logical solutions to these problems.
 Again in his address at Johns Hopkins
 University, the President firmly declared:
 We will not withdraw, either openly or
 under the cloak of a meaningless agreement.
 And what are the essentials of a mean-
 ingful agreement?
 Quite obviously these are the minimal
 objectives which the President has many
 times clearly stated and to which I have
 previously referred. Indeed, in the very
 same speech he said:
 Such peace demands an independent South
 Vietnam, securely guaranteed and able to
 shape its own relationships to all others,
 free from outside interference, tied to no
 alliance, a military base for no other coun-
 try.  These are the essentials of any final
 settlement.
 The interpretation of "unconditional
 negotiations" can be accurately made
 only in light of these statements by the
 President.  The President could hardly
 clearly and succinctly state our minimal
 objectives and disdain a "meaningless
 'agreement" in one part of his address
 . and then impliedly repudiate his posi-
 tion by agreeing to negotiations which
 could lead to a "meaningless agreement."
 For all their faults, the leaders in
 ,Hanoi were quick to understand this.
 What is so remarkable is that many lead-
 ers of other nations, political analysts,
 and  news  commentators  apparently
 failed to understand it. Possibly in their
 zeal to end the hostilities in Vietnam,
 they have taken the phrase "uncondi-
 tional negotiations" at its face value,
 standing by itself, without realizing that
 to do so would lift the words out of con-
 text of the full text of the Johns Hopkins
 address and attach a meaning which
 would undercut the integrity of the Pres-
 ident's clearly stated objectives.
 What the leaders in Hanoi understand
 and what others should understand is
 that any negotiations which lead to
 something less than the achievement of
 the minimal objectives stated by the
 President would be meaningless, and
 that only with respect to matters beyond
 these objectives can the negotiations be
 uncofditional.  There are many possi-
 bilities here. For example, the degree to
 which the leaders in Hanoi and the
 leaders of the Vietcong will be brought to
 trial and punished for war crimes, in-
 cluding the slaughter of South Vietna-
 mese civilians and the murder of prison-
 ers of war would bg subject to negotia-
 tions, as would be the subject of repara-
 tions for damages to South Vietnam.
 The degree to which economic asisstance
 would be extended to North Vietnam
 would be subject to negotiations.  But
 our minimal objectives for South Viet-
 nam cannot be subject to negotiation any
 more than, as the late President Ken-
 nedy said on July 25,1961:
 The freedom of that city [Berlin] is not ne-
 gotiable.
 There is another way of considering
 the meaning of the phrase "uncondi-
 tional' negotiations" and that is in light
 of the minimal demands by Hanoi, name-
 ly: First, American withdrawal from
 South Vietnam; second, temporary neu-
 tralization;  third,  communization of
 South Vietnam by the so-called Vietnam
 National Liberation Front; and fourth,
 reunification of North and South Viet-
 nam.  Obviously to the extent that these
 points undercut our minimal objectives,
 they cannot be the subject of negotiation.
 Bitter history has taught us that neu-
 tralization to the Communists does not
 carry the same meaning as it does to us.
 A neutralist government containing mil-
 itant Communists sooner or later ends
 up being subverted by the Communists
 who consider such a status as merely an
 opportunity for the communization of
 the government and the people.  Ac-
 cordingly, it is difficult to see how any
 of these points could be the subject of
 negotiations.  Of course, withdrawal of
 American forces would follow upon
 achievement of our minimal objectives
 for South Vietnam, and to this extent
 such withdrawal would be readily agreed
 to and would not even have to be nego-
 tiated.
 Theoretically, perhaps, reunification of
 North and South Vietnam might be the
 subject of negotiations. I say "theoret-
 ically" because of the difficulties in as-
 suring elections that are truly free which
 would be the only possible basis for such
 reunification.  Here, again, is where the
 Communists interpret the phrase "free
 elections" differently than we do. Their
 interpretation would permit the use of
 terrorist and coercive activities as a
 means of persuading the people to vote
 "freely" for a Communist government.
 The world has witnessed for a long time
 the distorted meaning of "free elections"
 as practiced in the Soviet Union.
 It is for this reason that overemphasis
 has been placed on the words of Presi-
 dent Johnson in his news conference of
 July 28, when he said:
 We do not seek the destruction of any gov-
 ernment, nor do we covet a foot of any terri-
 tory, but we Insist and we will always insist
 that the people of South Vietnam shall have
 the right of choice, the right to shape their
 own destiny in free elections in the South,
 or throughout all Vietnam under interna-
 tional supervision, and they shall not have
 any government imposed upon them by force
 and terror so long as we can prevent it.
 The President would, of course, like to
 see truly free elections, and I am sure,
 he would like to see some kind of inter-
 national machinery which would guar-
 antee such free elections.  But he is just
 as familiar with the distorted concept of
 free elections held by the Communists as
 anyone else, and he is equally aware of
 the impossibility of establishing the in-
 ternational machinery needed to guaran-
 tee truly free elections throughout North
 and South Vietnam In the foreseeable fu-
 ture.  That is why I believe there has
 been an overemphasis in some quarters
 on his words "or throughout all Vietnam
 under international supervision", as con-
 trasted with his words in the Johns Hop-
 kins speech:
 ' Such peace demands an independent South
 Vietnam.
 Obviously such an independent South
 Vietnam would have to precede free elec-
 tions throughout all Vietnam in the short
 range period of attainability.
 Perhaps it would have been well for
 the President to have made this point
 clear instead of leaving it for logical in-
 ference from his earlier statements.
 William R. Frye, writing in the Des
 Moines Register of August 3, said the
 United States has significantly modified
 its Vietnam peace terms in what he
 called "a major effort to negotiate its
 way out of the war."  He went on to
 say:
 The change in the American position con-
 sists essentially of three parts:
 1. Washington now is prepared to envisage
 reunification of Vietnam by internationally
 supervised  elections, as called for in the
 Geneva accords of 1954, even though, as many
 diplomats believe, this could lead to a Com-
 munist takeover.
 Reunification has long been North Viet-
 nam's objective.                                                                                                                                  The United States has held
 out for partition, with guaranteed security
 and independence for South Vietnam.
 2. The United States now is willing to re-
 gard Hanoi's oft-cited four points, which
 include an American withdrawal from Viet-
 nam, as part of the agenda for negotiation-
 though not the exclusive agenda nor as a
 precondition for a parley.
 This Is regarded as a major concession.
 Previously, although President Johnson had
 offered to take part in "unconditional dis-
 cussion," the four points had been consid-
 ered an unnegotiable demand for surrender.
 Third. The United States Is willing to find
 some face-saving formula for including the
 Vietcong-National Liberation Front-at a
 peace  table.   Previously  Washington  had
 been unwilling to negotiate with the Viet-
 cong, except as part of the. North Vietnamese
 delegation.
 And Mr. Frye concludes that the
 American peace drive has two facets:
 Private overtures, through U Thant and
 other intermediaries, offering to scale down
 the American asking price for peace; and
 public gestures, primarily to the U.N., in-
 viting action by Thant and the U.N. Security
 Council.
 These are provocative words by a percep-
 tive writer.  They lend credence to the re-
 port in the Des Moines Register of August
 8 that the Johnson administration last fall
 rejected a proposal for peace talks which
 had been accepted without conditions by
 North Vietnam.
 Let me quote from that report:
 The proposal * ? * did not set any con-
 ditions, but the Johnson administration re-
 jected it, it is said, for two reasons:
 1_ Mr. Johnson was engaged in the elec-
 tion battle with former Senator Barry Gold-
 water, who was advocating stronger U.S.
 military action in the Vietnam war.  If word
 of peace talks had leaked out, Goldwater
 might have capitalized on it as a sign of
 weakness  and  damaged  the  Democratic
 campaign.
 2. The South Vietnamese Government was
 in turmoil.  Opposition to the military re-
 gime of Premier Nyguyen Khanh was grow-
 ing and Washington believed that negotia-
 tion with the Communists might cause the
 government to fall.
 It is for this reason that I.,hope the
 President will not leave to conjecture

 any interpretation of the policy objec-
 tives which he has heretofore so firmly
 set forth. His every word is being scru-
 tinized most carefully by writers, coluln-
 nists, commentators, those who have
 been critical of his policies, those who
 have, as I have, been supporting his pol-
 icy in Vietnam, and, most particularly,
 the Communist leaders in Hanoi, 'Pei-
 ping, and Moscow. The slightest devia-
 tion from our minimal objectives will be
 seized upon as a sign of weakness by the
 Communist World.
 In evaluating any agreement to enter
 into negotiations, I believe it would be
 prudent to take note of a memorandum
 from Red China's Mao Tse-tung to the
 Soviet Union in'Marchof 1953.  It ap-
 pears on pages 5'7017-5708 of the CoN-
 GRESSIONAL  RECORD  of  April  29,  1954,
 volume 100, part 5, 83d Congress, 2d ses-
 sion. This memorandum should be read
 and studied by everyone and particularly
 by our policernakers in the State Depart-
 Inent and by those who would, in effect,
 have us bargain away the peace and
 freedom of South Vietnam and southeast
 Asia.
 The memorandum is a blueprint of
 conquest of Asia by the Communists.
 It outlines a program which has suc-
 ceeded all too well, even though parts
 of the timetable have been thrown off
 to some degree. Through Mao's timing
 has been off--because the United States
 unexpectedly intervened and because of
 the Red China-Soviet Union " dispute
 over how best to further Communist im-
 perialism-the memorandum serves as a
 'Mein Kam.pf of Communist conquest and
 domination.
 It should be emphasized that Mao
 anticipated that most of the gains are
 to be made through armistices and nego-
 . tiations.
 First of all, Mao declared:
 It appears that time has come that we
 have to look upon Asia as our immediate
 goal.  In Asia--
 He said-
 tap-ties of internal revolution, infiltration or
 intimidation into Inaction or submission will
 yield an abundant harvest.
 Pointing to the weakness within the
 Communist World, Mao wrote:
 Consequently, we have to, until we are
 certain of - victory, take a course which will
 not lead to war.
 One course-
 He continued-
 is to isolate the United States by all possible
 means.
 Then Britain must be placated by being
 convinced that there is a possibility of set-
 tling the major issues between the East and
 the West and that the Communists and the
 capitalist countries can live in peace.  Op-
 portunities for trade will have a great in-
 fiuence on the British mind.
 Listen to what Mao had to say about
 France:
 In the case of France, her war weariness
 and fear of Germany must be thoroughly
 exploited.  She must be made to feel a sense
 of greater security in cooperating with us
 than with the Western countries.
 And on Japan:
 Japan must be convinced that rearmament
 .endangers instead of guaranteeing her na-
 tional security and that, in case of war, the
 American forces distributed all over the
 world cannot spare sufficient strength for the the capitalist bloc, while, in China there was
 defense of Japan. Rearmament is, therefore,  nothing so direct and vigorous. . The experi-
 an expression of hostility toward her poten-                                                                       ences in Korea tell us that so long as there is
 tial friends.  Her desire to trade will offer foreign Intervention and so long as we have
 great possibilities for steering Japan away  no naval support, military operations alone
 from the United States.                      cannot achieve the objective of liberation.
 Before I turn to specific areas of con-
 quest set out in the blueprint, let me
 quote the section on military prepared-
 ness:
 As a final goal, there should be in east and
 southeast Asia (after these areas are liber-
 ated) 26 million well-trained men who can
 be immediately mobilized.  These men are to
 be held in readiness for emergency.  They
 will achieve two purposes. On the one hand
 they will force the capitalist countries to
 keep on increasing defense expenses until
 economic collapse overtakes them.  On the
 other hand, a mere show of force, when time
 is ripe, will bring about the capitulation of
 the ruling cliques of the countries to be
 liberated.
 Note the emphasis of liberation. The
 idea of a "war of liberation" is the chief
 propaganda weapon in the'hands of the
 aggressors in Vietnam today.
 Mao also had some comments on the
 Korean war, which was raging at the
 time his memorandum was written.
 He said:
 The important reason that ,we cannot win
 decisive victory in Korea Is our lack of naval
 strength. Without naval support, we have to
 confine  our  operations to frontal  attacks
 along a line limited by sea.  Such actions
 always entail great losses and are seldom ca-
 pable of destroying the enemy.                                                                           In March
 1961, I suggested to Comrade Stalin to make
 use of the Soviet submarines in Asia under
 some arrangement that the Soviet Union
 would not be apparently involved In the war.
 Comrade Stalin preferred to be cautious lest
 it might give the capitalist imperialism the
 pretext of expanding the war to the conti-
 nent. I agreed with his point of view.
 Until we are better equipped for victory, it
 is to our advantage to accept agreeable terms
 for an armistice.
 Here is what Mao had to say about
 Formosa:
 Formosa must be incorporated into the
 People's Republic of China because of the
 government's commitment to the people.  If
 seizure by force toto be avoided for the time
 being, the entry of the Chinese People's Gov-
 ernment Into the United Nations may help
 solve this problem.  If there should be se-
 rious. obstacles to the immediate transfer of
 Formosa to the control of the People's Gov-
 ernment, a United Nations trusteeship over
 Formosa as an intermediary step could be
 The  military  operations  in  Indochina
 should be carried out to such an extent as to
 make the war extremely unpopular among
 the French people and to make the French
 and Americans-extremely hateful among the
 Indochinese people.  The object is to force
 the French to back out of Indochina prefer-
 ably through the face-saving means of an
 armistice.  Once foreign intervention is out
 of the picture, vigorous propaganda, infiltra-
 tion, forming united fronts with the progres-
 sive elements in and outside the reactionary
 regimes will accelerate the process of libera-
 tion.                                                                                                 A final stroke of force will accomplish
 the task.  Two years may be needed for this
 work.
 Two years later :France was out of
 Indochina.
 But Mao's blueprint for complete dom-
 ination of what was formerly Indochina
 was stalled when the 'United States de-
 cided that freedom for the people and
 the peace of southeast Asia required our
 assistance.
 To those who maintain that South
 Vietnam is of little importance to us
 strategically, that we have no business
 there, that the Communists would settle
 for "that one little piece of ground."
 Mao's own words supply the answer:
 After the liberation of Indochina, Burma
 will fall in line as good foundation has al-
 ready been laid there. The then reactionary
 ruling clique in Thailand will capitulate and
 the country will be in the hands of the peo-
 ple.  The liberation of Indonesia, which will
 fall to the Communist camp as a ripe fruit,
 will complete the circle around the Malay
 Peninsula.
 The British will realize, under these cir-
 cumstances, the hopelessness of putting up
 a fight and will withdraw as quickly as they
 can.
 If war can be averted, the success of our
 plan of peaceful penetration for the other
 parts of Asia is almost assured.
 Even then Mao considered Indonesia
 ripe picking. And who can say he was in
 error when one considers the actions of
 Indonesia's Sukarno, who continues to
 castigate the United States and act like
 a puppet of Red China? That is why our
 continuation of aid to Indonesia makes
 so little sense.  And it makes even less
 sense that the United States has paid

 ago from the one who was then and who
 now is the leader of Red China. He was
 not writing for literary effect. He meant
 what he said.
 With so much talk about negotiations
 today, I view with misgivings that our
 Ambassador W. Averell Harriman and
 Gen. Maxwell Taylor, as reported in the
 Washington Post on August 9, suggested
 that Hanoi is not a likely target of Amer-
 ican air attacks against North Vietnam.
 According to the report, General Tay-
 lor argued against bombing the North
 Vietnamese capital. because "we need the
 leadership in Hanoi to be intact to make
 those essential decisions we hope they
 will make at some time."
 This seems to contradict Secretary of
 State Rusk's statement that there will
 be no privileged sanctuary for supporters
 of the Vietcong insurgency.
 And it recalls that there were no privi-
 leged sanctuaries for Adolf Hitler and
 his leaders during World War If. Never-
 theless, the Nazi leaders were sufficiently
 "intact" to make the essential decisions
 to end the war.
 It is not helpful to our cause to give
 comfort to those who promote aggres-
 sion. If our leaders intend to pursue a
 policy of firmness, they should avoid any
 statements which might be construed
 as a sign of deviation from that policy.
 I am concerned over suggestions, which
 seemingly appear as trial balloons, that
 we may settle for less than what the
 President has stated to be our minimal
 objectives.  I am concerned also that the
 President's critics-some from within his
 own party-appear to look only at Viet-
 nam without considering the whole pic-
 ture so carefully considered by Mao Tse-
 tung.  They ignore the Communist ob-
 jectives in Thailand, in Laos, in Cam-
 bodia, in Burma, in Japan, in the Phil-
 lippines, in India, and even in Australia.
 That is why it is time for all to under-
 stand the true meaning of the phrase
 "unconditional negotiations."
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the -memorandum to which I
 referred in my speech, and which ap-
 pears at page 5708 of the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD, be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the mem-
 orandum was ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:
 AN OUTLINE OF MAO TSE-TUNG'S MEMORANDUM
 ON NEW PROGRAM FOR WORLD REVOLUTION
 (Carried to Moscow by Chou En-lai in March
 1953)
 1. ASIA TO BE THE IMMEDIATE GOAL
 Due to the profound leadership of Com-
 rade  Stalin,  amazing  achievements  have
 been made in the great task of world revolu-
 tion.  The success that has been attained
 both in Europe and in Asia after World War
 II  is entirely  attributable  to Comrade
 Stalin's able and correct guidance and direc-
 tion.  May his wisdom still guide us.
 . It appears that time has come that we
 have to look upon Asia as our immediate
 goal. Under the present circumstances, any
 vigorous action In Europe such as internal
 revolution, effective infiltration, or intimida-
 tion into inaction, of submission is now im-
 possible (Communist terminology is differ-
 ent, this represents what it really means)
 more forcible measures may bring about a
 war.  In Asia, on the contrary, such tactics
 will yield an abundant harvest.
 2. WORLD WAR TO BE TEMPORAii5LIT AVOIDED
 There is no assurance of victory because of
 the higher rate of industrial production and
 larger stockpile of atomic weapons on the
 part of the capitalist countries, incompletion
 of  antiatomic  defenses  of  the  industrial
 areas  and  oil installations in  the  Soviet
 Union,  and   Immaturity of  China's    agri-
 cultural and industrial developments.                                                                                Con-
 sequently, we have to, until we are certain
 of victory, take a course which will not lead
 to war.
 3. DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE
 The United States must be isolated by all
 possible means.
 Britain must be placated by being con-
 vinced that there is possibility of settling
 the major issues between the East and the
 West and that the Communists and the cap-
 italist countries can live in peace.  Oppor-
 tunities for trade will have a great influence
 on the British mind.
 In the case of France, her war weariness
 and fear of Germany must be thoroughly
 exploited.  She must be made to feel a sense
 of greater security in cooperating with us
 than with the Western countries.
 Japan must be convinced that rearmament
 endangers instead of guaranteeing her na-
 tional security and that, in case of war, the
 American  forces  distributed  all  over  the
 world cannot spare sufficient strength for
 the  defense  of  Japan.  Rearmament      is,
 therefore, an expression of hostility toward
 her potential friends.  Her desire to trade
 will offer great  possibilities for  steering
 Japan away from the United States.
 4. MILITARY PREPAREDNESS
 As a final goal, there should be in east
 and southeast Asia (after these areas are
 liberated) 25 million well-trained men who
 can be immediately mobilized.  These men
 are to be held in readiness for emergency.
 They will achieve two purposes. On the one
 hand they will force the capitalist coun-
 tries to keep on increasing defense expenses
 until economic collapse overtakes them.  On
 the other hand, a mere show of force, when
 time is ripe, will bring about the capitula-
 tion of the ruling cliques of the countries
 to be liberated.
 5. THE KOREAN WAR
 The important reason that we cannot win
 decisive victory in Korea is our lack of naval
 strength.                   Without naval support, we have
 to confine our operations to frontal attacks
 along a line limited by sea.  Such actions
 always entail great losses and are seldom
 capable of destroying the enemy.  In March
 1951 I suggested to Comrade Stalin to make
 use of the Soviet submarines in Asia under
 some arrangement that the Soviet Union
 would not be apparently involved in the
 war.  Comrade Stalin preferred to be cau-
 tious lest it might give the capitalist im-
 perialism the pretext of expanding the war
 to the Continent.  I agreed with his point
 of view.
 Until we are better equipped for victory,
 it is to our advantage to accept agreeable
 terms for an armistice.
 e. FORMOSA
 Formosa must be incorporated into the
 People's Republic of China because of the
 Government's commitment to the people.  If
 seizure by force is to be avoided for the
 time being, the entry of the Chinese People's
 Government into the United Nations may
 help solve  this problem.  If there should
 be serious obstacles to the immediate trans-
 fer of Formosa to the control of the People's
 Government, a United Nations trusteeship
 over Formosa as an intermediary step could
 be taken into consideration.
 7. INDOCHINA
 We shall give the maximum assistance to
 our comrades and friends in Indochina.  The
 experiences we have had in Korea should
 enrich their knowledge in fighting for lib-
 eration.  The case of Indochina cannot be
 compared with that of China.  In Indo-
 china, ? as in Korea, there is serious Inter-
 vention of the capitalist bloc, while in China
 there was nothing so direct and vigorous.
 The experiences In Korea tell us that so
 long as there is foreign intervention and
 so long as we have no naval support, military
 operations alone cannot achieve the objec-
 tive of liberation.
 The  military  operations  in  Indochina
 should be carried out to such an extent as to
 make the war extremely unpopular among
 the French people and to make the French
 and Americans extremely hateful among the
 Indochinese people.  The object is to force
 the French to back out of Indochina pref-
 erably through  the face-saving means  of
 an armistice. Once foreign intervention is
 out of the picture, vigorous propaganda, in-
 filtration, forming united fronts with the
 progressive elements in and outside the re-
 actionary regimes will accelerate the process
 of liberation.  A final stroke of force will
 accomplish    the  task.  Two  years  may  be
 needed for this work.
 8.  BURMA,  THAILAND,  INDONESIA,  AND  MALAY
 PENINSULA
 After the liberation of Indochina, Burma
 will fall in line as good foundation has al-
 ready been laid there.                                                                                                                              The then reactionary
 ruling clique in Thailand will capitulate and
 the country will be in the hands of the
 people.  The liberation of Indochina, which
 will fall to Communist camp as a ripe fruit,
 will complete the circle around the Malay
 Peninsula.
 The British will realize, under these cir-
 cumstances, the hopelessness of putting up
 a fight and will withdraw as quickly as they
 can.  We expect that the whole process will
 be completed in or before 1960.
 9. JAPAN AND INDIA
 By    1960 China's military, economic and
 industrial power will be so developed that
 with a mere show of force by the Soviet
 Union and China, the ruling clique of Japan
 will capitulate and a peaceful revolution will
 take place.  We must be on guard against
 the possibility that the United States will
 choose to have war at this moment.  She
 may even want the war earlier.  The defen-
 sive and offensive preparations of the Soviet
 Union and China must, therefore, be com-
 pleted before 1960.  Whether we can prevent
 the United  States from starting the war
 depends upon how much success we have
 in isolating her and how effective is our
 peace offensive. If the war can be averted,
 the success of our plan of peaceful pene-
 tration for the other parts of Asia is almost
 assured.
 In the case Of India, only peaceful means
 should  be  adopted.   Any  employment of
 force will alienate ourselves from the Arabic
 countries and Africa, because India is con-
 sidered to be our friend.
 10. ARABIC COUNTRIES AND AFRICA
 After India has been won over, the prob-
 lems of the Philippines and the Arabic coun-
 tries can be easily solved by economic co-
 operation, alliances, united fronts, and coali-
 tions.  This task may be completed in 1965.
 Then a wave of revolution will sweep over
 the whole continent of Africa and the im-
 perialists and the colonizationists will be
 quickly driven into the sea.  In fact this
 powerful movement may have been under-
 way much earlier.
 With Asia and Africa disconnected with
 the capitalist countries in Europe, there Will
 be a total economic collapse in Western
 Europe.  There capitulation will be a matter
 of course.
 11. THE UNITED STATES
 Crushing economic collapse and industrial'
 breakdown will follow the European crisis.

 Canada and South America will find them-

 condition.  Twenty years from now, world
 revolution will be an accomplished fact.  If

 THEBIG IF
 (By Joseph Alsop)
 The history of the American role in the
 War in Vietnam has thus far been stamped
 all over, in large letters, "Too Little and Too
 Late."
 A good illustration is President Kennedy's
 1961 decision to make an Important increase
 in the American contribution.
 The people who were trying for Brownie
 points by carrying on a personal vendetta
 against the late President Ngo Dinh Diem
 elaborately pooh-poohed the results of this
 decision  by President Kennedy.  General
 Harkins and Secretary of Defense Robert S.
 McNamara were bitterly denounced for over-
 timistic estimates of the war situation in
 lea.
 By now, however, prisoner interrogations
 and other undoubted intelligence have re-
 roealed that the Vietcong came fairly close
 to defeat at that time.  The modern weap-
 ons that the United States supplied to the
 South Vietnamese Army, and the major step-
 up in South Vietnamese fighting power,
 knocked the Communists temporarily but
 rather completely off balance.
 Instead of being criticized for overopti-
 mism, in fact, Secretary McNamara should
 have been attacked on another point--the
 failure to act on one of the 1961 recommen-
 dations, to backup the South Vietnamese
 army with American tactical airpower.
 Very few people are aware of it, but the
 fact is that the most Important part of
 President Johnson's  Pleilcu  decision  last
 winter was not the order to bomb North Viet-
 namese targets.  As the decision was imple-
 Inted, . the bombing sorties against the
 north were more for show than effect for
 many months on end.  But President John-
 son's simultaneous removal of all wraps
 from the use of American tactical airgower
 In South Vietnam had a profound effect.
 Without this other, much less publicized
 step, the war might well have been lost by
 now.  And if this same step had been taken
 when the American contribution was in-
 creased in 1961, the war     t well have been
 Won in the period whenthe Vietcong were
 so badly knocked off balance.
 Thg   facts are, relevant at the moment,
 because the increase in U.S. troop strength
 in Vietnam, which President Johnson an-
 nounced last week, is currently being de-
 nounced as "too little and too late."  For
 once in a way, however, this appears not to
 be true.
 In brief, the U.S. field commander, General
 Westmoreland,  was  given  quite literally
 everything he asked for.  The armed serv-
 ices were not, however, given all that they
 asked for as soon as General Westmoreland's
 requests were in.  Thus the callup of Re-
 serves-was deferred, for instance.
 In these circumstances, the really disquiet-
 ing aspect of the President's news conference
 was the interminable and effusive discussion
 of negotiations with the North Vietnamese.
 This has left the impression, in the country
 and throughout the world, that the United
 States is prepared to stop fighting the next
 morning after being asked to begin talking.
 The big "if," of course, Is whether enough
 progress can be made in Vietnam to force
 the Communists to ask for negotiations.  If
 that happens, one may be quite certain the
 circumstances will broadly resemble those in
 Korea in June-July 1951, when the Chinese
 Communists asked for negotiations.
 The reason for the Chinese request was
 simple. The United States and South Korean
 armies had made a superb recovery In the
 months since the disaster on the Yalu.  In
 June-July 1951, a powerful offensive threat-
 ened the whole Chinese and North Korean
 front.  That was why the Chinese were ready
 to begin talking.
 Unhappily, the offensive was stopped dead
 in its tracks when talks were requested. The
 Chinese got a respite.  Two more bitter years
 of fighting followed before the signature of
 the unsatisfactory peace.  The war in Viet-
 nam is a direct sequel and result.
 It to a serious matter, therefore, if the
 impression is conveyed that the United States
 Is again ready to commit the same silly folly
 that was committed in Korea in the summer
 of 1951.
 In reality, this impression that President
 Johnson conveyed is almost certainly, mis-
 leading.  He talks of unconditional negotia-
 tions because the intention is to keep the
 pressure on the enemy until an acceptable
 settlement is agreed upon.  But the Presi-
 dent will still be wise to remove the false
 impression, for there are plenty of people
 who have .forgotten the Korean folly and will
 howl like banshees for a repetition of it,
 unless the President clears the air in ad-
 vance:
 MAJOR U.S. MonirrcATION or VIET PEACE
 TERMS
 (By William R. Frye)
 NEW Yoas, N.4'.-The United States has
 significantly  modified  its  Vietnam peace
 terms in a major effort to negotiate its way
 out of, the war, it has been learned here.
 Chief U.B. Delegate Arthur J. Goldberg
 informed U.N. Secretary General U Thant of
 the new stand on Wednesday.  Thant, who
 thereupon publicly vowed to redouble his
 peace efforts, is expected to relay the propos-
 als to Hanoi and Peiping promptly.
 The change in the American position con-
 sists essentially of three parts:
 1. Washington now Is prepared to envisage
 reunification of Vietnam by internationally
 supervised elections, as called for in the Ge-
 neva accords of 1954, even though, as many
 diplomats believe, this could lead to a Com-
 munist takeover.
 Reunification has long been North Viet-
 nam's objective. The United States has held
 out for prrtition, with guaranteed security
 and independence for South Vietnam.
 2. The United States now is willing to re-
 gard I anoi's oft-cited "four points," which
 include an American withdrawal from Viet-
 nam, as part of the agenda for negotiation-
 though not the exclusive agenda nor as a
 precondition for a parley.
 This is regarded as a major concession.
 Previously, although President Johnson had
 offered to take part in. "unconditional dis-
 euesions," the four points had been consid-
 ered an unnegotiable demand for surrender.
 The points involve  (a)  American  with-
 drawal; (b) temporary neutralization;                                                                                                                                           (c)
 communization of South Vietnam; (d) then
 reunification.
 3. The United States is willing to find
 some face-saving formula for including the
 Vietcong  (National Liberation Front) at a
 peace table.  Previously, Washington had
 been unwilling to negotiate with the Viet-
 cong except as part of the North Vietnamese
 delegation.
 This large-scale United States "peace of-
 fensive" has placed Hanoi and Peiping under
 significant new pressure to negotiate an end
 to the Vietnam war, U.N. diplomats believe.
 PRIVATE AND PUBLIC MOVES
 The American peace drive has two facets:
 Private                              overtures,  through  U  Thant  and
 other intermediaries, offering to scale down
 the American asking price for peace; and
 public gestures, primarily to the U.N.. in-
 viting action by Thant and the U.N. Security
 Council.
 U.N. diplomats and observers are more Im-
 pressed by the private moves than by the
 public gestures, though they believe both
 contribute to useful pressure on the Com-
 munists.
 In offering to negotiate the reunification
 of Vietnam under internationally supervised
 elections the United States has offered, in
 effect, to reverse its 10-year effort at parti-
 tion, provided only that the elections are
 :genuinely free, and certified as such by an
 international authority.
 SOMETHING TO WORK WITH
 It was never clear in the 1950's that the
 Communists would let the elections be free,
 even though many observers believed they
 could win them.  They wanted victory to be
 not merely probable, but certain.  This point
 could easily prove once again to be a major
 stumbling block. But if so, the United States
 will be in a strong moral and propaganda
 position. U.N. people believe.
 The Secretary General is represented as
 feeling he now has something negotiable to
 work on.  But whether the Vietcong having
 believed themselves on the verge of military
 victory, will agree to negotiate on any basis
 for any purpose is considered problematical.
 Strenuous efforts will be made to persuade
 them to do so.
 It is presumed here, without firm knowl-
 edge, that Presidential roving Ambassador
 W. Averell Harriman went to Moscow hop-
 ing to Induce Moscow to join in this pressure
 on Hanoi.
 DOESN'T WANT U.N. DEBATE
 If  after  a  reasonable  period-the  word
 "reasonable". has not been made precise-
 the Communists still refuse to negotiate, even
 on a basis which includes their own pro-
 posals,                                                                                                                                      the  United  States  is  expected         to
 plunge into the war on a major scale.
 The public phase of the American "peace
 offensive" is regarded here as useful but less
 meaningful.
 The  U.N. does not believe the      United
 States really expects, or even wants, a public
 debate on Vietnam  in  the U.N.     Security
 Council at this stage, despite an invitation
 to Council members Friday by Delegate Gold-
 berg to "somehow find the means to respond
 effectively" to the southeast Asia "challenge."
 A public debate would virtually oblige the
 Soviet Union to take a violent public pos-
 ture critical of the United States, it is pointed
 out, :at a time when efforts are being made
 to cushion the damaging impact of Vietnam
 on Soviet-American relations and avoid a
 future confrontation.

 Moscow, too, is said to be opposed to a
 Vietnam debate in the U.N.   Neither the
 United States nor any other country has
 formally moved for one.
 Repeated statements by Washington that
 the United States is willing are taken as
 gestures to American domestic critics, who
 want the U.N. to help make peace, perhaps
 without fully realizing what U.N. interven-
 tion would mean at this stage.
 JOHNSON THROWS SUPPORT TO THANT
 (By Max Freedman)
 The effect on the United Nations of Presi-
 dent Johnson's new initiatives on Vietnam
 can be summarized in two sentences.  Up to
 now Secretary General U Thant has been fol-
 lowing his own instincts, working often at
 haphazard, and always barren of results. Now
 he is supported by the full authority of the
 United States, the whole world knows it,
 and he can act with new confidence  and
 assurance.  In a situation filled with uncer-
 tainty and danger his new bargaining power
 is at least one small hope for peace.
 In the past there has been rather savage
 criticism of the Secretary  General  in the
 American press.   He has been accused of
 being so impartial that he has seen no dif-
 ference between Communist subversion and
 the resistance offered by the United States.
 This press criticism has received no sup-
 port from the Johnson administration.  As
 a matter of deliberate and far-sighted policy,
 Ambassador Adlai Stevenson and Secretary
 of State Dean Rusk and the President all
 wanted to preserve the Secretary General's
 undamaged authority.  They knew the time
 might  come  when  the  Secretary  General
 could be very useful in bringing the prob-
 lems of Vietnam to the conference table.
 Perhaps that time has not yet arrived but at
 least he has begun to move in that direction.
 It has often been said that the Secretary
 General has no mandate to do anything in
 this dispute since neither North Vietnam nor
 China belongs to the United Nations.  That
 is not correct,  Under the charter he has a
 general mandate to bring to the attention
 of the United Nations any problem disturb-
 ing the peace. He is now able to use the pow-
 ers of his office not only as they were defined
 in the charter but as they were interpreted
 and expanded by the late Secretary General
 Dag Hammarskjold.
 Beyond all question any hope of a nego-
 tiated settlement rests on the Secretary Gen-
 eral,           Any effort made by an individual gov-
 ernment to promote a settlement will be co-
 ordinated with the work of the Secretariat
 even if nothing is said of this cooperation
 in public.  Thus, the United Nations always
 will be in the background and its authority
 can be used at the right moment.
 When he was asked if the United States
 would support an immediate cease-fire, Am-
 bassador Arthur Goldberg replied that a
 cease-fire is without meaning unless it leads
 to a negotiated settlement of the dispute.
 There is another answer that is equally im-
 portant.  The United States must be very
 skeptical of any arrangement that seems to
 give the Vietcong the title to the land that
 they are holding at the time of the cease-fire.
 Any such formula would weaken and dis-
 member South Vietnam and make its sur-
 vival as an independent political entity com-
 pletely impossible.
 This explains why  the rulers of  South
 Vietnam are being so cautious about the role
 of the United Nations. They want to know
 what the United Nations can do to guarantee
 that South Vietnam will in fact have a free
 choice in a supervised election to chart its
 own political course.  The United States is
 pledged to respect the freedom of south
 Vietnam while being willing to accept the
 unity of all Vietnam.  This is a pleasant and
 ingenious formula, so long as it does not
 have to be tested, but it enshrines a contra.
 F,q46R000300130013-1
 diction and may fall apart under the pull
 of events.
 By every token,  the  Secretary General
 knows better than officials in Washington
 how fragile and contradictory this. principle
 really is.  He has asked for urgent studies
 to be made on the problems of supervised
 elections so that South Vietnam's freedom
 of choice will be a reality rather than an
 illusion.   He also has made it clear that the
 conference room must be a place for gen-
 uine negotiations instead of being a place
 where the military gains of the Communist
 forces are ratified and accepted.
 These two principles, deeply held at the
 United Nations, should reassure South Viet-
 nam that no one is contemplating a diplo-
 matic sellout in the abused name of peace.
 In these early stages it is impossible to
 know what the Soviet Union will do.  If she
 is ready to minimize the risks of war, she
 will not use her veto or organize resistance
 to the United Nations effort.  It all depends
 on how far the Soviet Union wishes to go in
 widening her quarrel with Communist China
 and in reducing her influence in North Viet-
 nam.  The Secretary General is now trying
 to find the answer to these questions by
 delicate personal diplomacy.
 Even China may hesitate before she re-
 bukes and defies the United Nations.  Yet
 the Secretary General, even if his present ef-
 forts should fail, would have provided an-
 other and conclusive proof of the desire of
 the United States to find an honorable end
 to the war in Vietnam.
 REPORT UNITED  STATES REJECTED PEACE  BID
 LAST FALL
 (By Darius S. Jhabvala)
 UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.-The Johnson ad-
 ministration last fall rejected a proposal for
 Vietnam peace talks that had been accepted
 without conditions by Communist North
 Vietnam, it was learned Saturday.
 This information, from reliable sources, is
 in direct conflict with President Johnson's
 statement at his July 28 press conference
 that "we are ready now, as we have always
 been, to move from the battlefield to the
 conference table."
 The opportunity for a private and unpub-
 licized discussion with representatives of the
 Hanoi regime occurred early last fall, at the
 height of the U.S. presidential election cam-
 paign.
 NO CONDITIONS
 The proposal, made by a non-Communist
 Asian diplomat, was accepted by Hanoi, which
 did not set forth any conditions.
 But the Johnson administration rejected
 it, is is said, for two reasons:
 Mr. Johnson was engaged in the election
 battle with former Senator Barry Goldwater,
 who was advocating stronger U.S. military
 action in the Vietnam war.  If word of peace
 talks had leaked out, Goldwater might have
 capitalized on it as a sign of weakness and
 damaged the Democratic campaign.
 The South Vietnamese Government was in
 turmoil.  Opposition to the military regime
 of Premier Nguyen Kanh was growing, and
 Washington believed that negotiations with
 the Communists might cause the government
 to fall (it did fall later).
 Saturday, an informed State Department
 source, asked about the story, replied, "The
 President was never involved in that one."
 He said it was one of many contacts over a
 long period of time.  "There were contacts
 going on almost every other week."
 ABOUT PROCEDURE
 But, he said, this particular contact con-
 cerned only the procedure for a meeting and
 there was no hint that anything would come
 from it.
 He said "the election did not have anything
 to do with it."
 The effort to initiate direct talks was made
 shortly after the August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin
 crisis, in which the United States conducted
 its first two air strikes against North Viet-
 nam in retaliation for PT boat attacks on
 American warships in the gulf.
 That was 6 months before the present U.S.
 air offensive against North Vietnam began
 last February 7.
 Not long before it accepted the proposal
 for direct talks, Hanoi had rejected an in-
 vitation  by  the  United  Nations  Security
 Council to participate in a debate on the
 Gulf of Tonkin crisis with the comment that
 only the signers of the 1954 Geneva accords
 were competent to study "the war acts com-
 mitted by the United States."  The United
 States was not a signatory.
 AT RANGOON
 The proposal, suggesting Rangoon, Burma,
 as a meeting place, was discussed at the U.N.
 and then relayed to Hanoi by an emissary of
 the  Soviet  foreign  ministry.  There  were
 hints of such a proposal at that time, but
 its fate was never made public.
 Later proposals for peace talks were turned
 down by Hanoi, and the sources said Satur-
 day they believed the U.S, rejection of the
 Rangoon talks caused Hanoi to stiffen its
 resistance to negotiations and to intensify
 its support of the Vietcong guerrilla war
 against South Vietnam.
 U.S. officials have said several times that
 on no occasion has Hanoi shown a willing-
 ness to talk.
 The sources pointed out Saturday that
 last fall's U.S. rejection and Hanoi accept-
 ance of a negotiation proposal is now a foot-
 note in history.  They maintained, however,
 that had a meeting taken place, a road to
 peace in Vietnam might have been mapped
 out.
 HANOI SEEN AS UNLIKELY AIR TARGET-HAR-
 RIMAN, TAYLOR HINT STRONGLY THAT CITY
 WON'T BE HIT
 (By Frank C. Porter)
 W. Averell Harriman and Gen. Maxwell D.
 Taylor both suggested yesterday that Hanoi
 is not a likely target in American air attacks
 against North Vietnam.
 "Although there has been no assurance
 that we won't bomb Hanoi," Harriman said,
 "we are a long ways from it at the present
 time."
 Taylor argued against bombing the North
 Vietnamese capital on grounds that "we need
 the leadership in Hanoi to be intact to make
 those essential decisions we hope they will
 make at some time."  He would not say cate-
 gorically, however, that the city is ruled out
 as a future target.
 RUSK'S WARNING
 Although the Johnson administration has
 repeatedly said it has no present plans to
 strike Hanoi, Secretary of State Dean Rusk
 has warned there will be no privileged sanctu-
 ary for supporters of the Vietcong insurgency.
 But  Harriman  and  Taylor  appeared  to
 throw out strong hints that Hanoi may be
 indefinitely exempted.
 And Harriman, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large
 who recently returned from talks with Rus-
 sian Premier Alexei N. Kosygin and four other
 chiefs of state, went out of his way to calm
 American fears of further escalation of the
 Vietnamese conflict.
 Asked about a serious military confronta-
 tion with Communist China, Harriman said,
 "I see no reason we should stir up the public
 to believing that is the danger.  I do not
 believe it is a danger."
 But  should  such  a  confrontation  with
 China occur, Harriman told a panel on "Face
 the Nation" (CBS, WTOP), "we would have
 to count upon Moscow standing with Com-
 munist allies."
 At the same time, Harriman said he came
 back from Moscow "with a very strong feel-
 ing that Mr. Kosygin and his colleagues are
 as anxious as we are to prevent escalation."

 MOSCOW'S STAND STATED
 He stressed that the Soviet Union cannot
 play an overt role as peacemaker because
 of its competition with Peiping for leadership
 of world communsim. "They may be able to
 do things privately they are not able to do
 publicly," he added.
 And  although  Moscow  supports  North
 Vietnam and liberation movements generally
 as the trend of the future, Harriman said
 Kosygin told him the Russians "believe in
 the 17th parallel (the dividing line between
 North and South Vietnam), indicating that
 there shoilld be recognition of the rights of
 the South Vietnamese people."
 In the same vein, Harriman said President
 Tito of Yugoslavia made it plain to him that
 South Vietnam should be allowed to have its
 Independence and that Tito regards China
 as an aggressor nation and a dangerous one.
 "And r wouldn't be surprised if that was
 not only his view but also.the Soviet view,"
 Harriman added.
 Taylor, former U.S. Ambassador to Saigon,
 was interviewed on Meet the Press (NBC-TV-
 WRC).
 He said he would expect additional Amer-
 lean forces to follow the buildup to 125,000
 men  announced  by  the  administration.
 Asked if he thought a commitment of 300,000
 to 400,000 might be needed later, Taylor said
 he did not think such a large force will be
 required.
 He also was asked how long it might take
 to end the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
 "I wouldn't expect anything less than l to
 2 years," Taylor said.
 General Taylor was reminded that in 1962
 he and Defense Secretary Robert S. Mc-
 Namara had said the United States might be
 able to wind up its involvement by Christ-
 mas of that year.
 "At that time we had not had the political
 turbulence," Taylor said, referring to the
 subsequent overthrow of the Diem govern-
 ment and the long series of paigon coups that
 followed.
 The lack of governmental stability and of
 sufficient  trained, military, manpower are
 the two most pressing problems in South
 Vietnam today, said Taylor.
 But "the new and broe,de i.ed U.S. commit-
 ment" to fill that manpower gap has given an
 "enormous lift" to South Vietnamese . and
 Americana alike, he explained.
 American air attacks north of the 17th
 parallel, Taylor said at another point, have
 had "a very clear depressant effect" on in-
 filtration ,from the north.
 UNrrsn STATES GAVE $350,000 FOR INDONESIA
 .REACTOR
 (By Richard Halloran)
 The United States has paid Indonesia
 $350,000 to assist the southeast Asian nation
 to operate a small atomic research reactor.
 A State Department spokesman said yes-
 terday that the sum was paid to fulfill an
 atoms-for-peace agreement made in 1980.
 The reactor, situated at the Technical In-
 stitute of Bandung, was , purchased from
 General Dynamics and went into operation
 last spring with uranium fuel leased from
 the United States.
 Under terms of the agreement, the United
 States granted the $350,000 after Indonesia
 got the facility running.  The funds were
 given to Indonesia last month.
 The United States must now decide wheth-
 er to renew the 5-year agreement, which ex-
 pires September 20.  In light of Indonesian
 President Sukarno's pointed anti-American
 stance recently, the decision has strong poli-
 tical overtones.
 No negotiations for renewing the agree-
 ment have been started with the Indonesian
 Government.  The decision to, go ahead or
 not will be made by Secretary of State Dean
 Rusk and may go to President Johnson for
 approval.
 If the United States decides not to renew
 the agreement, a problem in getting Indo-
 nesia to return the fuel may arise. Indonesia
 so far has observed the inspection and safety
 aspects of the agreement. But Sukarno's re-
 action to an adverse decision is unpredictable.
 A second consideration is Sukarno's recent
 claims that Indonesia will soon have an
 atomic bomb. Informed sources say that the
 atoms-for-peace reactor cannot technically
 be used to build a military weapon.
 The Bandung reactor is the only one known
 to be operating in Indonesia.  A Russian-
 built subcritical reactor stopped running in
 1963 when the Russians did not replenish the
 fuel.
 Another Soviet reactor is under construc-
 tion but not operating.
 American assistance to Indonesia's atomic
 program has been criticized at home and
 abroad.
 In ituala Lumpur Thursday, Reuters re-
 ported  Malaysian  Prime  Minister  Tunku
 Abdul Rahman said:
 "Although America says the reactor is only
 meant for peaceful purposes, what guarantee
 is there that Sukarno will not use it for de-
 struction purposes?"
 Sukarno has vowed that Indonesia will
 "crush" Malaysia, which he considers a neo-
 colonial federation.
 Earlier this week, Representative Wu x.rssa
 S. BROOMFIELD, Republican, of Michigan, was
 critical of American assistance to Indonesian
 atomic research.
 THROWING AWAY _MAR.KETS-AND
 FARMERS
 Mr. McGOVERN.  Mr. President, Al
 Capp, who is famed for his Lil Abner
 comic strip, recently conjured up little
 beings he designated as "Kigmies."
 "Kigmies"  in  the  cartoon  world,
 ushered in an era of improved human re-
 lations because they enjoyed nothing
 more than a well-planted foot in the pos-
 terior. Angry and frustrated human be-
 ings could get relief from their frustra-
 tions and anger by kicking a Kigmie.
 I mention this because of efforts to
 make real life Kigmies out of the wheat
 producers of the United States.
 American wheat producers have just
 lost a share in the sale of 6.9 million tons
 of wheat to Russia and Eastern. Europe
 within the past 2 weeks because of an
 unbelievably foolish policy, demanded by
 maritime unions, and -maintained by our
 Government. of requiring 50 percent of
 any wheat sold for dollars to Soviet bloc
 countries to be carried in American ships
 at nearly twice what it would cost to
 move the wheat in foreign vessels.
 The news last week told of Canadian
 sales to a Russian trade delegation of 27.7
 million bushels of wheat for shipment
 from western Canada, and another 187
 million bushels for shipment from east-
 ern Canada, including wheat equivalent
 of 400,000 tons of flour. A sale of 7 mil-
 lion bushels to Czechoslovakia was ar-
 ranged during the week, and an inde-
 pendent purchase of 1.1 million tons was
 made from Argentina.
 The delivered cost of this wheat will
 be about $500 million.  The Canadian
 wheat producers will receive in excess of
 $300 million.
 Russia is going to need even more
 wheat.
 Dr. Richard Goodman of the Great
 Plains Wheat Council advises me that the
 'best available informationindicates the
 Russian crop this year will be 40 to 41
 million tons.
 Between 1959 and 1963, the Russian
 crop has averaged 60 million tons.
 Russia's requirements are 55 million
 tons for domestic consumption and3 mil-
 lion toys for export to satellites.
 Assuming a 41-million-ton crop and 7
 million tons of purchases to date, Rus-
 sia is still 7 million tons short of a nor-
 mal supply for domestic use and 10 mil-
 lion tons of wheat short if her exports
 are calculated.  Russia still needs wheat
 which we might sell ;if our unwise ship-
 ping rules were rescinded.
 According to press reports, Izvestia has
 started indicating to the Russian people
 that corn is a fine cereal.
 There are indications that Mr. Kosygin
 is conditioning his people for the news
 that they must tighten their belts on
 wheat consumption in the year ahead.
 She has booked just about all the wheat
 Canada can spare until she is certain of
 yields from the bumper crop that ap-
 pears sure to be harvested in the western
 provinces.  Argentina, and Australia are
 out of the market at least until they
 know the size of then 1966 crop.  And
 Russia has made one thing clear in the
 past: she will not pay more for Amer-
 ican products than other purchasers from
 the United States have to pay, which is
 one effect of our 50 percent U.S. ship-
 ping requirement.
 We are denying American wheat farm-
 ers access to a profitable commercial
 market by our self-defeating shipping
 requirement.  We are asking Soviet pur-
 chasers to pay 11 to 1.2 cents per bushel
 more for wheat than other countries are
 asked to pay-because of the requirement
 that 50 percent must be shipped in U.S.
 ships.  As a consequence, we are not
 selling a single bushel of wheat to the
 Russians of Eastern Europeans and there
 is every indication that they will con-
 tinue to buy from our competitors or
 substitute corn as a cereal, before they
 will patronize us at extra cost, even as
 a residual demand supplier.
 The shipping regulation, designed to
 placate two or three maritime unions, is
 helping no one at all.  It is giving them
 50 percent of nothing.  It is depriving
 the United States of an opportunity to
 improve its balance of payments position
 by hundreds of millions of dollars.
 While Canadian farmers are expe-
 riencing an economic boom and going
 into all out production, our wheat farm-
 ers are suffering from inadequate markets
 and from drastically curtailed produc-
 tion. While we develop a farm program
 paying people not to product, the Ca-
 nadians are forging ahead, increasing
 wheat acreage.
 Mr. President, there is absolutely no
 reasonable justification for this self-de-
 feating shipping restriction. It helps no
 one.  It hurts virtually everybody.  If
 anyone draws any satisfaction from the
 false hope that this silly shipping re-
 striction is hurting the Russians and the
 East Europeans he should simply take
 a look at the Russian purchase mis-
 sions which are securing grain from our
 competitors all over the world.  All we
 are doing is sticking our heads in the
 sand at a cost of several hundred mil-
