 U,S. - SOVIET  R ELATIONS
 MOSCOW SEES KISSINGER VISIT CONFIRMING DETENTE COURSE
 Secretary Kissinger's visit to Hoscow from 23 to 27 October
 has been presented in the Soviet media as a "useful" but not
 particularly dramatic event, the main significance of which
 lies in the testimony it gives that U.S.-Soviet relations are
 still moving in the "right direction."  This positive assessment
 has been conveyed less by what Moscow has said about the talks
 themselves--on which little information has been made public--
 than by surrounding comment on the general subject of U.S.-Soviet
 relations and by reports of the ceremonial speeches.   Both the
 comment and the speeches have stressed the continuity of the
 present course in U.S.-Soviet relations, pointing up the linkage
 of the present meeting with past ones, as well as with the forth-
 coming meeting between Brezhnev and the President in Vladivostok.
 The image of the United States and of the attitude of the U.S.
 Administration presented in this material has been uniformly
 favorable.   On the eve of the talks, IZVRSTIYA carried a dispatch
 from New York by correspondent V. Kobysh which said that "detente"
 had become a commonly accepted word in the American idiom,
 reflecting bread acceptance of the concept by U.S. public opinion.
 At the conclusion of the visit, a Moscow Radio observers roundtable
 on 27 October stressed the linkage of the Kissinger visit with the
 visit of Secreta-y Simon the week before, as well as with other
 recent contacts  )etween U.S. and Soviet officials.   "All this is
 testimony," said commentator Natveyev, that U.S.-Soviet agreements
 are not just "paper pacts" but are being successfully implemented.
 The commitment of the Ford Administration to continue the policies
 of its predecessor has been singled out for particular notice.
 Gromyko drew attention to it in his speech at the luncheon he
 gave for Secretary Kissinger on the first day of the talks.   He
 noted that Brezhnev at the opening session had "expressed satis-
 faction" with President Ford's statements indicating his intention
 to continue "the course that has been adopted."  A number of
 commentaries, including the Moscow Radio observers roundtable,
 also drew attention to the point.
 The commitment of the Soviet leadership to the detente course
 has also been stressed, with no less emphasis on the personal nature
 of the commitment.' The most striking expression of the commitment

 came in Gromyko's speech at the luncheon which Secretary
 Kissinger hosted at the U.S. Embassy on 26 October.   Referring
 to the readiness of the Soviet Union to continue the search
 for solutions with the United States, Gromyko said that the
 genuineness of commitment was attested by Brezhnev's personal
 participation in the talks with Secretary Kissinger.  This
 is a fact which speaks for itself, he said,  "and quite
 eloquently at that."  He went on to assert that "our party's
 Central Committee, the Soviet Go^?ernment, and L. I. Brezhnev
 personally" are fully resolved to pursue the course of improving
 U.S.-Soviet relations.
 PEKING SEES INTENSIFIED ARMS RACE BEHIND MOSCOW TALKS
 Peking reacted with unusual speed to Secretary Kissinger's Moscow visit
 and talks with Brezhnev, with separate NCNA reports on 25 and 27 October
 presenting the two sides' professions of detente as a cover for their
 intensified arms rivalry.   Peking had portrayed Kissinger's last
 visit to  "'IDSCOW  last March at the head of a U.S. delegation in
 the same light, but on that occasion it had waited until the Secretary
 returned home before offering its assessment.
 Consistent with its recent propaganda stress on the "reality" of a
 superpower arms race lurking behind the "smokescreen" of detente,
 Peking linked the sessions in ifoscow with recent reported advances
 in U.S.-Soviet arms programs, offering its most comprehensive assess-
 ment in'recent months of U.S.-Soviet arms development.   Thus, the
 25 October report cited Western press observations that recent Soviet
 "launchings of rocket carriers" in the Western Pacific were timed
 to coincide with Kissinger's airival In order to "strengthen its
 posture for the forthcoming talks."  It went on to note reports that
 Moscow had recently tested "improved" MIRV's, its "latest longrange
 rockets," had developed a "mobile launching system" for ICBMs, and
 had built "151 new silos for emplaced ICBPI's"--developments which
 NCNA said "raises diplomatic and military problems for the United
 States" and could have "far-reaching effects on the nuclear balance"
 between the superpowers.   NCNA on the 27th added the claim that
 Moscow had also recently developed "a new mobile antiballistic
 guided missiles system," which "many U.S. officials" regarded as an
 open violation of the 1972 agreement on ABM's.
 Peking has portrayed the United States as equally determined to sustain
 its position against Soviet advances, with the NCNA report on the 27th
 giving special attention to the 25 October Pentagon announcement of a

 successful laun:~aing from an aircraft of a Minuteman ICBM.   Ci'iing the
 Western press, NCN,, said that "Kissinger and the Department of Defense
 have cons-lstently pushed this (airborne ICBM) test program in order to
 give the Soviet Union a deep impression that the United States is
 fully prepared to match them in developing mobile ICBM's," and that
 "U.S. leaders regard the new weapons system" "^s an important bargaining
 chip in the strategic arms limitation talks."

 ARAB - ISRAELI                         I SSUE
 MOSCOW WELCOMES ARAB SUMMIT DECISION ON PALESTINE QUESTION
 Moscow typically has paid the usual lip service in welcoming the
 results of the seventh Arab summit conference, held in Rabat 26-29
 October, as a demonstration of "anti-imperialist" Arab unity.
 While it has hailed the summit decision on the Palestine question,
 it has alsn typically failed to come to grips with the effect
 this decision will haiie on future Arab-Israeli negotiations for
 a Mideast settlement.   The resolution on Palestine, adopted on
 the 28th, confirmed the c,.aims of the Palestine Liberation
 Organizati.on (PLO) as sole legitimate representative of all
 Palestinian Arabs and endorsed the PLO's right to establish an
 independent national authority on liberated Palestinian territory.
 Tale resolution raises questions about Jordan'.an and PLO representa-
 tion in any negotiations and even about the fate of future talks
 given Israel's refusal to negotiate with the PLO.  Moscow has
 depicted the Israeli reaction of one of anger and disappointment,
 citing Tel Aviv's refusal to sit at the niegotiating table with
 the PLO, but drawing no conclusions  as  to how this might affect.
 efforts for a sLi:tlement.
 Nor has Moscow addresser'. itself to the question of possible
 establishment cf a Pa.lesrinian goverment in p::ile now that
 the summit supported the establishment: of an "independent
 Palestirti: n authority."  Moscow reported,  almost in passing,
 that Egyptian President as-So''at sairi a Palestinian government
 in exile would b- fo-_:med soon, but has taken no tote of
 speculation in Arab media on this subject.  And scarcely a month
 before the summit conference, an article in the October issue
 of INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS had reiterated previous Soviet criticism
 of Palestinian disarray and again advised the Palestinians to
 draw up a "sober, democratic program" aimed at a just Mideast
 settlement.
 GENEVA TALKS      Soviet comment pegged to the summit has blandly
 continued to call for resumption of the Geneva
 talks, appearing to brush off the practical implications of the
 Palestine resolution for the course of future negotiations.   TASS
 on the 28th put the PLO-Jordanian dispute in the context of the
 Geneva conference, remarking that the Palestinian question had
 become the focal point of the summit due to opposing PLO and
 Jordanian views on "representation" of the Palestinians,
 particularly those in the West Bank.  The issue at stake, TASS

 said, was "most closely connected with the representation of
 both sides" at Geneva.   Subsequent treatment of the Geneva
 representation issue suggests that Moscow may share the general
 uncertainty over conflicting reports of possible Jordanian
 and/or PLO representation at the conference.                 Thus a Moscow
 radio commentary broadcast in English to Africa on the 29th
 asserted that the summit had agreed that "the PLO will send
 its representatives to the next session of the Geneva conference
 on the Middle East as members of the Jordanian delegation."
 But TASS on the 30th, reporting Moroccan King I-Iassan's press
 conference that day, cited him as saying that the decision on
 "Arab countries' participation" in the Geneva talks rested
 with the "states immediately confronting the Israeli aggression."
 While TASS accounts of President Ford's 29 October press con.-
 ference made no mention of his remark about the need for movement
 toward settlement of Israeli-Egyptian problems,  Israeli-Syrian
 problems, and problems "between Israel and Jordan or the PLO,"
 Moscow broadcasts in Arabic on the 30th misrepresented his comment.
 Thus a Timoshkin commentary, in the course of extolling the
 "very great success" of the Rabat conference, cited the President
 as "calling on Israel not to obstruct the participation of the
 legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people"  in the
 work of the Geneva conference.  And a brief news item claimed
 that the President had stated that the "Israeli Government should
 change its stand toward the PLO and not hinder the participation
 of its representatives in the Geneva peace conference."
 Moscow has occasionally linked its comment on Arab political
 unity with warnings against: following the negotiating approach
 advocated by the United States.  IZVESTIYA political observer
 V. Matveyev, for instance, speaking on the Moscow radio observers'
 roundtable on 27 October,,  praised the results of united Arab
 action in the past but warned that Arab states "have not always
 managed to achieve this unity," due in large part to Western
 attempts to foster Arab differences.  Matveyev charged that these
 attempts presently included convincing certain Arab governments
 they should arrange for "separate agreements of a limited
 character--thus by-passing the Geneva conference."  A 31 October
 PRAVDA article by B.  Kotov,  reported by TASS, interpreted the
 Rabat conference as a rejection by the Arab states of "plans for
 'partial,'  'stage-by-stage,' or 'separate' solutions in the Middle
 East."  At the same time,  Kotov noted that the United State._ and  the
 USSR, as guarantors of the UN Security Council resolutions, would
 have to be consulted by those Arab governments that reaffirmed their
 readiness at Rabat to participate in the Geneva conference, "after-
 they coordinate their views with the PLO as well as with the two
 great powers."

 MOSCOW'S DEADLINE FOR CSCE IMPLIED AT WARSAW CP CONCLAVE
 Moscow has seemingly indicated a desire to bring the Conference
 on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) to a conclusion
 before mid-1975.   The final communique of the 16-18 October
 Warsaw "consultative" meeting of 28 European communist parties
 stated that the participants decided to prepare to hold a
 conference of European communist parties in East Berlin "no
 later than mid-1375."*  In speeches at the Warsaw meeting, CPSU
 Politburo member and secretary Ponomarev and many of the East
 European spokesmen declared that the East Berlin mid-year
 conference should follow the successful c nclusion of the CSCE.
 Moscow would appear to be signaling its  ope for a conclusion
 to CSCE at the latest by next spring, possibly with the idea
 of marking the 30th anniversary of the end of World War II by
 holding the CP conference in East Berlin.
 Ponomarev, according to the 18 October PRAVDA account of his
 speech,  told the Warsaw meeting on the 16th "it is to be assumed"
 the CSCE would end with positive results which can be viewed as
 a great success.   "Our delegation," he added, "proceeds from the
 assumption that the communist conference would be held after the
 end of the all-European conference of states."  Polish CP
 Politburo member Babiuch was slightly more specific in his speech
 on the 17th, saying "we hope" that the CSCE will be "concluded
 early next year."
 The call for a CSCE conclusion this year has all but discnpeared
 from even routine Soviet comment on CSCE; more authoritative
 comment and official statements continue to call for an end of the
 conference "as soon as possible," "in the nearest future," "soon,"
 or use similar vague formulations.   For example, Brezhnev, in his
 speech at the 28 October Kremlin dinner for visiting FRG Chancellor
 Schmidt, called for "speediest conclusion" of the conference while
 again arguing in effect that CSCE negotiators should only attempt
 to resolve those questions now ripe for solution and not those which
 lie "beyond the limits of reality."

 ELEMENTS OF OPTIMISM APPEAR IN COMMENT ON 1ST MBFR ANNIVERSARY
 Scattered elements of new optimism have appeared in Soviet and
 East European comment on the Vienna negotiations on force reductions
 since they resumed on 24 September and with the passing of the first
 anniversary of there negotiations on 30 October.   The thrust of
 much comment continues to stress the differences and incompatability
 of the two sides' draft proposals, although previous appeals for a
 first "symbolic" step to get the talks moving and to increase mutual
 trust have reappeared with some frequency of late.   At least  two
 East European press articles have offered one new element, implying
 that there is a certain commonality in the approach of the two sides,
 while the idea that compromise is needed on both sides also has been
 introduced.   Moscow has again apparently resorted to a press  leak
 in Vienna to convey the impression the MBFR talks are not totally
 stalemated, in order to counter pessimism voiced in the Western
 mess.
 A call for compromises and mutual concessions came in a signed
 article in the 24 September. Polish daily GLOS PRACY, which argued
 that now it is necessary "to search for compromise solutions" and
 that it is not unusual that "final success" at international
 conferences "depends on mutual concessions."  The notion of common
 elements in the two sides' proposals appeared in an article in the
 Polish weekly POLITYKA of 28 September by Warsaw's main commentator
 on MBFR, A. Rayzacher.   He pointed out that despite all the
 substantial differences, "propositions from both sides have a
 common methodological point"--there is talk about the first step
 in reduction which could be used both for building confidence and
 to accumulate empirical experience for making further reductions.
 A similar assertion was made in a Sandor Pirityi article in the
 Budapest weekly MAGYARORSZAG of 6 October.
 RAYZACHER ARTICLE      Rayzacher in his article sounded a note of
 optimism in recalling that both Pact and
 NATO spokesmen had previously made statements to the effect that
 "the first understandings can be expected at the turn of 1974 and
 1975, and the implementation of the first step in the coming year."
 Rayzacher wau optimistic with regard to progress at Vienna.
 Alluding to Brezhnev's "tasting of the wine" speech in May 1971,
 in which he called on NATO to start negotiations on force reductions
 to see what the Pact had to offer, Rayzacher asked rhetorically
 whether the "Viennese bottle" was half full or half empty.  Noting
 statements by spokesmen for the two sides, he concluded that  "the
 optimists are therefore surely right."

 In a rare departure for an East European or Soviet commentator,
 Rayzacher also indirectly broached one of the fundamen'.al issues
 dividing the two sides in Vienna--the Warsaw Pact demand that any
 negotiated ceiling on force levels must apply to the national
 armed forces of the individual states instead of alliance-wide
 force levels.   In a nonpolemical tone, Rayzacher sought to
 counter West European arguments that the Pact sought international
 control and limitations on the entire structure of the West
 European armed forces and the sovereignty of the West European
 states to manage their defenses  )n their own national territory, or
 to prevent the political integration of West Europe and its
 military autonomy within NATO.   While noting Pact disapproval of
 such moves toward West European integration, Rayzacher seemed to
 hint there was room for compromise on this issue, observing that
 the East Europeans "also recognize the objective character- of the
 processes of integration in the capitalist part of Europe."
 GLOS PRACY's call for mutual concessions and Rayzacher's restrained
 approach to a sensitive issue have not been echoed in Soviet
 comment, but they are of more than routine interest since East
 European cominencators in the past have seldom ventured far beyond
 the positions of their Soviet counterparts on MBFR.
 SOVIET STATEMENTS      Moscow's recent authoritative comment has
 included a mixture of positive statements on
 the MBFR talks and critical assessments of the NATO bargaining
 position.   The PRAVDA editorial article on 13 October--marking
 the 10th anniversary of Khrushchev's ouster----included an almost
 verbatim reiteration of one of Brezhnev's most optimistic statements
 on MBFR, first made in his 14 June Supreme Soviet election    yerch
 in Moscow.  PRAVDA observed:   "The USSR is ready initially   P_c  agree
 even to partial measures.   The Soviet side sees a possibility in the
 near future of achieving specific results at the talks on the
 reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe if, of
 course, good will is displayed by all participants."  Brezhnev's
 more recent remarks--at a 28 October Kremlin dinner for FRG Chancel'-or
 Schmidt--were in the critical tone more common to Soviet leadership
 statements on this issue:  He pointed out that "considerable differences
 in the principles of the sides .  .  . are manifested at the talks" and
 charged that "some participants in the talks manifest the. striving to
 obtain unilateral advantages."   (Soviet comment routinely implies that
 the NATO powers do not have a joint proposal at the Vienna MBFR talks.)
 Brezhnev concluded by lecturing his West German visitors:   "If there
 is a wish to reach an agreement, it would be better to give up such
 strivings.   It can hardly be regarded as realistic to seek to build
 one's security to the detriment of the security of otlie.i5."

 PRESS LEAK ON      The most recent Vienna press leak on MBFR
 PACT PROPOSAL      developments, obviously based on Warsaw Pact
 sources, came in an Austrian Press Agency (APA)
 report published in the Viennese press on the 25th and picked
 up by TASS five days later.*  The APA report cited "informed
 quarters in Vienna that the Warsaw Pact states have submitted
 a new compromise proposal."  The report noted that the new
 proposal would make it possible for force reductions "to begin
 before the end of 1975" and added that the Pact was "convinced
 that this new initiative  opens a genuine opportunity for concrete
 progress."   The timing of the rumor,  coinciding with Secretary
 Kissinger's visit to Moscow, seemed designed to suggest that
 Washington and Moscow might be able to move the talks off dead
 center--a tactic Moscow has used before at times of high-level
 U.S.-Soviet talks.   The announcement on Kissinger's 23-27 October
 visit to Moscow said that  the two sides "also feel that progress
 is possible" in the Vienna talks.
 Moscow acknowledged the rumor of a compromise proposal in an
 unsigned TASS dispatch from Vienna on 30 October which took note
 of Western press articles "about a 'breakthrough' in the talks."
 Without mentioning the source of the reports, TASS went on to say
 that the Vienna press articles reported  that the "initiative comes
 from 'the Warsaw treaty countries. "'   TASS also cited the press
 articles' discussion of the possibility of "concrete progress
 already during 1975" in the context of the Pact's proposals to
 implement "initial cutbacks in 1975 which would mark a practical
 step towards reaching the general goal of the talks."

 PRAVDA ARTICLE HAILS RESULTS OF WARSAW CONSULTATIVE MEETING
 Moscow waited 12 days after the windup of the 16-18 October Warsaw
 "consultative" meeting of European communist parties before issuing
 its first authoritative comment--a 30 October PRAVDA editoria"
 ai-tlele which praised the gathering nFt a contribution to European
 security and communist unity and predicted that the European CP
 conference plani.-d next year would be "a major international event."
 Like the communique issued at the close of the Warsaw meeting, the
 PRAVDA editorial article did not mention a world communist confer-
 ence, thus apparently confirming the Soviet bloc's inclination to
 put that project aside for the time being while concentrating on
 the sizable task of preparing the European conference.  Moscow's
 orthodox East European allies have likewise avoided the subject
 of a world conference both at Warsaw and in followup comment,
 whereas earlier the East Europeans had clearly linked a European
 party meeting to a subsequent world party conference.  Moscow
 itself has not called for a new world party conference since
 the idea was broached in November 1973.
 The PRAVDA article generally follows the main lines of Soviet
 delegate Ponomarev's speech to the Warsaw meeting, a speech
 ;;eyed to the theme of unity in diversity.   Like Ponomarev, the
 article asserts that the planned European CP conference must
 hammer out a "common" line based on a free exchange of views.
 The conference documents must, PRAVDA said, express "the coordi-
 nated opinion of all the parties- attending" as well as "the right
 of each party to take the floor at the conference and raise any
 problems that it may deem necessary."
 While this approach seems calculated to reassure the more inde-
 pendent members of the movement--Romania, Yugoslavia, and the
 Italian CP--that their views will be heard at the conference, it
 also clearly provides a formula that would leave an opening for
 raising the controversial China issue at the conference.   However,
 the three independents have consistently served notice, both
 before and at the Warsaw meeting, that their participation in
 the 1975 European CP conference and its preparations was contin-
 gent on scrupulous avoidance of any criticism of "absent" parties
 during the proceedings.   There was apparently no direct mention
 of the China issue in speeches during the Warsaw meeting.

 While the PRAVDA editorial article did not mention the Chinese
 directly, other Soviet comment in the wake of the Warsaw meeting
 was less restrained.   Thus, a Sibiryakov commentary broadcast
 by Moscow radio on the 24th charged that "imperialist propaganda"
 prior to the Warsaw gathering had "tried to persuade everybody
 that the meeting was intended to keep out China," adding that
 "all kinds of renegades, opportunists, and Maoists" had adopted
 the same viewpoint.  The absence of any mention of the Warsaw
 meeting by Peking media was denounced in a Ifulin commentary
 broadcast in Ifandarin on the 28th:   Tiie talk voiced a Lelief that
 "the Chinese communists would have been interested in the Warsaw
 meeting had they known about its aim" of promoting detente, but
 "the Maoist leaders would not even let them know" about the
 gathering.
 NEPSZABADZAG      In contrast to the conciliatory tone of the
 COMMENT           PRAVDA editorial, the Hungarian party daily
 NEPSZABADZAG on 20 October issued a stern
 prediction that next year's European CP conference would reflect
 the views of Moscow and its orthodox allies, whether the
 independent participants like it or not.   Thus, the article, by
 Berecz, head of the MSZMP Central Committee's foreign department,
 noted that "one party or another sometimes overemphasized the
 significance of the principle of unanimity"--a principle which
 the article said was desirable but should not be made into "a
 dogma."  The principle of unanimity or consensus, it declared,
 must not "hamper the voluntarily assumed joint action .  .  . of
 the decisive majority of the sister parties."  The outspoken
 Hungarians reiterated this point in a Vajda article in MAGYAR
 HIRLAP on the 23d, which similarly stressed that the communist
 parties "rule out considering the principle of unanimity as
 absolute."  The article also raised the prospect of a conference
 final document not wholly acceptable to the independents, in
 noting that the participating parties can "decide for themselves
 whether they accept the jointly elaborated proposals and documents."

 DRV PARTY JOURNAL ATTACKS          If HOSTILE.  ELEMENTS OPPOSING REGIME
 A highly unusual editorial in the September issue of the Vietnam
 Workers Party (VWP) theoretical journal 11OC TAP presents a
 striking picture of political and social disruption in North
 Vietnam and suggests strong party contention over policies.
 The editorial's content and tone go far beyond any earlier
 propaganda on postwar problems, even warning of the existence
 of "hostile tendencies and thoughts" opposed to basic party
 policies, including opposition to such aims as completing the
 revolution in South Vietnam.
 HOC TAP editorials are (often used to explain and reinforce new
 party lines, but the fact that thus far there has been no endorse-
 ment of the current editorial in other media suggests that it
 reflects the viewpoint of a discontented, militant faction within
 the leadership.   The very appearance of an editorial in the party
 journal which departs so sharply from the usual propaganda line
 suggests that there may be a serious confrontation within the
 North Vietnamese party, with significant forces pressing for
 policy changes.   The editorial's militant position on the war in
 South Vietnam and its criticism of "opportunist" elements in the
 North could be r-ad, not only as an indictment of laxity, indifference,
 and softness among the Vietnamese population in general, but also
 as an attack on prusent party policies and their sponsors.
 POLICIES TOWARD      The editorial's discuss.Lon cf the "party line"
 SOUTH VIETNAM        on South Vietnam is more militant than the
 usual Hanoi statements, suggesting that its
 author may not merely be defending an agreed position but, in fact,
 be advocating more aggressive action.   Seeming to attack elements
 which would be reticent to endorse military action to take over
 South Vietnam, the editorial caustically assails opportunists who
 prefer a "selfish, individualistic life" to "national independence
 and freedom."  And, in an argument at odds with propaganda in the
 wake of the January 1973 Paris agreement calling for a political
 solution in the South, it decries those who would deny the
 "necessity to resort to revolutionary violence and revolutionary
 warfare to liberate the nation."  Although the editorial begins by
 surveying the situation in the past year and a half, it makes no
 mention of the peace agreement itself.

 The editorial goes beyond the usual North Vietnamese line both
 in  he precedence it gives to the struggle in the South, as
 opposed to construction in the North, and in its evaluation of
 the military balance of forces.   In describing, the nation's two
 "strategic tasks," the editorial first lists the "national
 democratic revolution 1_n the South" and then the task of building
 socialism in the North--a reversal of the order of priorities
 established at the VWP's 3d party congress in September 1960
 and reaff iimed in the description if tasks contained in the party
 Central Committee's 22d plenum resolution early this year.   The
 editorial's appraisal of the balance of forces in Vietnam is less
 cautious than the usual communist claim--voiced, for example by
 Premier Pham Van Dong in his national day speech published in tae
 same issue of HOC TAP--that the balance of forces is moving "more
 and more" in favor of the revolution.   By contrast,  the editorial
 claims a decisive edge, with "our people's revolutionary forces
 throughout the country... certainly stronger than the forces of the
 counterrevolutionary henchmen of the U.S. imperialists."
 The editorial's claim of military superiority is unusual, but it
 has been made in the past by some representatives of the DRV
 military.   Thus, DRV Defense Minister Vo Nguyen Giap similarly
 claimed in a 7 May speech that the forces of the revolution were
 "much stronger" than Saigon's "as far as the entire country is
 concerned."   The military commentator "Chien Thang"  (Victor)
 strongly advocated this view in articles in August 1973 which may
 have been intended to supply justification for increased communist
 attacks in the following months.   The usual DRV appraisal of the
 balance of forces states that it is moving in favor of the communists,
 without claiming they have achieved superiority.
 SOCIALIST REFORM      In the area of domestic policies, the HOC TAP
 IN NORTH VIETNAM       editorial comes down hard on those who allegedly
 oppose socialist reform and "compulsory and
 dictatorial" measures to protect socialist property,  stop illegal
 transactions, and maintain public order and security.  Concern
 with the prevalence of such "negative phenomena" in North Vietnam
 is nothing new; however, the editorial goes beyond other Hanoi
 propaganda in portraying a sinister opposition to measures of
 reform.
 Similar problems were addressed, for example, by Vice Premier
 Tran Huu Duc in an article in the March HOC TAP which complained
 at length about illegal activities, even involving state employees,

 and demanded "very firm ana urgent measures" to check them.
 Due also anticipated the curr-int editorial's concern that some
 cadres did not show proper ze0_ in combatting such manifestations,
 However, Due merely accused these cadres of misunderstanding the
 content of the struggle and misjudging the "serious impact" of
 illegal economic activities, while the editorial, by contrast,
 appears to be attacking wi3.lfu_. opponents of reform policies.
 It repeatedly scores unnamed persons who allegedly have used
 the "pretext of respecting 'democracy' and 'freedom' in order
 to oppose the state's close control and managerial measures
 against those wh, have stolen socialist property and transacted
 illegal business,  , and against speculators and conspirators...."
 The harsh tone of the editorial strikes a markedly different chord
 than the seemingly pragmatic line that has prevailed in North
 Vietnam in recent years.   In particular,  it seems at odds with
 the views of VWP First Secretary Le Duan expounded in his major
 February 1970 article and touched upon again in a March 1973
 article on cadre problems.   Li Duan stressed that the "essential
 nature" of the proletarian dictatorship was not "violence
 or oppression" but rather construction and organization, and
 he warned against preoccupation with the suppression of
 opponents of the proletariat.   In his 1973 article he also
 maintained that with a correct political line there is only
 a minor risk of cadre deviations and "bad tendenci,is" can be
 "easily eliminated."
 The HOC TAP editorial states that "a number" of cadres and party
 members a-  among those "entertaining an incorrect outlook" ant
 that these views have been publicly disseminated.   Thus, it warns
 that thei_ incorrect outlook has encouraged hostile tendencies
 to develop into a "'current of evil thoughts"' which i,s being
 "conveyed from mouth to mouth" and has "appeared even in the
 press and in the literature and arts."  Elsewhere it specifies
 that those who are "ideologically opposed" to the ragime "have
 publicly propagated their hostile thoughts for sinister purposes."
 Hanoi media during the war occasionally complained of decadent,
 counterrevolutionary views being clandestinely disseminated,
 particularly among urban youths; however,  the current editorial
 seems to be deploring a more serious situation in which
 authoritative organs have b,:~en used to propagandize an "evil"
 or "poisonous" line.

 The editorial calls for a "mass movement to struggle against
 negative phenomena" to be carried out  along with the emulation
 mover,?ent for labor productivity which has been the key campaign
 in all areas of North Vietnamese society during the past year.
 It recommends that those who have erroneous points of view
 should be educated, but harshly demands punishment for elements
 "who are really opposed to our regime."
 ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF       In another example of unusual candor, the
 "FAMINE" IN NORTH       editorial, listing DRV achievements, claims
 that North Vietnam was successful in
 "overcoming the famine which occured in the preharvest period
 early this year as the result of natural calamities."  At no time
 in recent years have Hanoi media been known to acknowledge the
 existence of "famine."  Propaganda earlier this year did, however,
 take note of the delay in harvesting the fifth-month and spring
 rice crops.   And a 19 June NIHAN DAN editorial, for example, discussed
 the problems of state distribution of grain "in times of difficulty"
 and assistance to the peasants "in the recent period between the
 two crops."
 DRV-PRC AGREEMENT ON ECONOMIC, MILITARY AID SIGNED IN PEKING
 An agreement on Chinese economic and military aid to North Vietnam
 in 1975 was signed in Peking on 26 October by PRC Vice Premier
 Li Hsien-nien and DRV Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi, capping negoti-
 ations that apparently began more than  two months ago.   Chinese
 aid for 1975 had been discussed, according to Hanoi media, during
 a Nghi visit to Peking in the first week of August.   The usual
 DRV aid negotiator, Vice Foreign Trade Minister Ly Ban, has
 apparently been in Peking since that time.*  In addition to the
 annual aid agreement, DRV and PRC foreign trade and military
 officials on the 26th signed a trade agreement and protocols
 on the supply of military equipment and materials and civilian
 goods.   The last annual PRC-DRV aid agreement was signed in
 June 1973, during a visit to Peking by Vietnam Workers Party
 First Secretary Le Duan and Premier Pham Van Dong, and comparable
 protocols and a trade agreement were concluded in October 1973.
 *  Ly Ban is not known to have returned  to North Vietnam following
 Le Thanh Nghi's 1-8 August visit to China, and he appeared at
 celebrations in Peking marking the 2 September DRV National Day
 anniversary.   The DRV delegation's August visit is discussed in
 the TRENDS of 14 August 1974, pages 18-19.   Last year's aid agree-

 Hanoi media, as usual, specified that the annual agreement provided
 for "nonrefundable" aid and reported that Li Hsien-nien, at his
 banquet for the delegation, also referred to nonrefundable aid
 for 1975.   Peking media had similarly characterizedtthe aid agree-
 ments for the past two years, but this year returned to the previous
 PRC practice of omitting any description of the annual aid agreement
 even ignoring Li Hsien-nien's reported remark    Peking did report,
 however, that the military protocols provided for "Lratuitous"
 supply of material.
 Although a cryptic statement by Le Thanh Nghi at the 26 October
 banquet suggested that Chinese aid may have increased, Peking reports
 on the banquet appeared to reflect a deliberate Chinese policy of
 avoiding attention to Chinese assistance for Vietnam.  The NCNA
 account of the banquet speeches by Li Hsien-nien and Le Thanh Nghi
 left out several references to Chinese backing for Vietnam which
 were included in Hanoi reports.  Thus, NCNA's summary of Li Hsien-nien`s
 speech, in addition to dropping his mention of the agreement on
 "nonrefundable economic and military aid," omitted his references
 to the two nations' talks on economic cooperation proceeding "on
 the basis of proletarian internationalism" and to their longstand-
 ing mutual "support and aid."   NCNA retained no specific reference
 to assistance, only quoting Li as promising continuing "support"
 for Vietnam's "just struggle and socialist construction."  The
 NCNA account also predictably omitted the statement by Nghi suggest-
 ing that Chinese aid had been stepped up:   According to Hanoi
 radio, Nghi cited the current situation in Vietnam and the "schemes"
 of the United States and Thieu and asserted that in the face of
 such a situation, "an increase" in Chinese "support and assistance"
 is of "great significance and-ffect."  In addition, NCNA left
 out a lengthy passage praising Sino-Vietnamese friendship, "on
 the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism,"
 and Nghi's assertion that the Chinese people consider "support and
 assistance" to Vietnam to be an "international obligation."
 NCNA did report that Li Hsien-nien had recalled the PRG and DRV
 government statements of 8 and 11 October, respectively, and
 offered the "resolute support" of the "Chinese people" for them.
 Li's cautious endorsement, failing to menti:un the two statements'
 criticism of the United States and demand for Thieu's ouster,
 was not included in Hanoi's account of his remarks.   Chinese backing
 for the statements had been offered earlier in a 15 October PEOPLE'S
 DAILY  Commentator article.*

 During Le Thanh Nghi's 25-28 stay in Peking, in addition to holding
 talks with Li Hsien-nien, he met with Chou En-lai in the hospital
 for a "cordial and friendly conversation" and had separate meetings
 with Prince Sihanouk and RGNU Prime Minister Penn Nouth.  Le Thanh
 Nghi returned to Hanoi on the 28th, and there has been no indication
 whether he will visit other countries to sign annual aid agreements,
 as he has in past years.   Other aid agreements for 1975 that are
 known to have been concluded by Hanoi are a pact with Albania, signed
 in the DRV with an Albenian delegation on 7 October, and an agreement
 with Bulgaria, signed in Sofia on 14 September by the head of the
 DRV delegation to Bulgarian National Day celebrations.*

 KOREA
 PEKING MARKS CPV ANNIVERSARY, STRESSES U1S, TROOP REMOVAL
 Chinese comment pegged to the 24th anniversary of the entry of
 Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) into the Korean War reflects
 both increasing Chinese attention to continued U.S. military
 involvement in South Korea as well as Peking's efforts to
 deemphasize its past military ties with Pyongyang.   The anniversary
 was marked by the usual banquets in the two capitals and by
 traditional wreathlaying ceremonies in 11orth Korea in honor of
 CPV dead, including one at the grave of Mao Tse-tung's son.   As
 in previous years,  the anniversary failed to trigger any editorial
 comment in the Chinese press, but drew the customary NODONG
 SINMUN editorial.
 Chinese banquet speeches this year were harsher than those at last
 year's anniversary functions on the issue of withdrawal of U.S.
 troops from South Korea, containing the firmest language. thus far
 in Peking's gradually hardening line on the presence of U.S.
 troops in Korea.*   Politburo member Chen Hsi-lien, speaking at the
 Peking banquet,argued that there was still no solution on Korean
 reunification because South Korea was "still under ':he occupation
 of U.S. troops flaunting the UN flag."   It was and-_r i;he "aegis"
 of the United States, Chen asserted,  that the Pak government was
 disrupting the North-South          and suppressing the South
 Korean people.   Chen demanded that the United States "immediately"
 stop interfering in Korea's internal affairs and specifically
 called for "U.S.  troops flying the UN flag"  to "pull out of South
 Korea without delay."

 safeguarded China's security.

 BHUTTO VISIT  TO  MOSCOW
 'OVIET PROPAGANDA WELCOMES CHANGES IN PAKISTANI POLICIES
 Soviet propaganda accompanying Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar
 1.1i Bhuttr s 24-26 October visit to Moscow refl.ected the improve-
 aeat  in Soviet-Pakistani relations since Bhutto's last official
 visit to Moscow in March 1972.* Prior to Bh;    ;'s arrival, TASS
 and Moscow  radio broadcasts to South Asia carried a 23 October
 PRAVDA article favorably reviewing the "internal democratisation"
 in Pakistan since Bhutto's accession to power, and linked internal
 Pakistani developments to the "positive realistic tendencies" in
 'ihutto's foreign policy.   The article particularly cited Pakistan's
 withdrawal  from SEATO, establishment of diplomatic relations with
 the GDR, DR'J, and. DPRK, and "constructive contribution" to the
 "normalization" of the situation on the South Asian subcontinent.
 Soviet comment prior to Bhutto's 1972 trip had focused on the
 "serious crisis inherited by the country" from the recently deposed
 Yahya Khan  regime, and the need for Bhutto to implement his
 announced program of socioeconomic reforms.
 The agenda  of Bhutto's visit and Soviet media characterization of
 the tone of Soviet-Pakistani consultations closely r=_sembled those
 in 1972.  Kosygin and Bhutto held two days of talks marked by an
 "identity or similarity of views," and party Secretary Brezhnev
 a,id Bhutto held a "friendly" meeting on 25 October in which
 "tops -al problems" were discussed.   Kosygin's remarks at a 24 October
 dinner, reported in full in the 25 October PRAVDA, were general
 and optimistic in nature, expressing the hope that South Asia
 would  be turned into an "area of durable peace," a seeming
 reference to Moscow's proposal for an Asian collective security
 system that  Pakistan has consistently refused to endorse.   Bhutto's
 remark,, at the dinner, excerpted in PRAVDA, countered with a
 refer ?=-ce to Pakistan's proposal that South Asia he declared a
 "nuclear-free zone."  A ".Ioscow radio commentary, broadcast to
 South Asia on the 24th, went further than Kosygin when it explicitly
 stressed the need for an Asian collective security system and
 quoted  Brezhnev's Kishinev speech on Soviet determination to work
 for peace in Asia .
 Soviet  reports of the 25 October Bhutto-Brezhnev meeting said
 nothing about the Asian collective security issue, but TASS quoted
 Brezhnev as  reiterating Kosygin's earlier formulation that South

 Asia should be turned into an "area of durable peace."   The
 joint communique issued prior to Bhutto's departure on the
 26th utilized the same formulation as in the 1972 communique,
 with both sides agreeing that "world peace and security in
 Asia" were dependent on scrupulous observation of the
 "principles of the UN charter."
 On other issues the communique noted ~Mt an "identity or
 proximity" of posi`ions was reached between tl.-A two sides,
 and Moscow agreed to begin negotiating a new trade agreement
 with the Pakistanis.     (Accccding to Karachi Domestic Service,
 the agreement will involve an additional 228 million ruble
 credit for the accelerated completion of the Soviet-built
 Karachi steel mill.)   Bhutto "renewed" his invitation to
 Brezhnev, Podgornyy, and Kosygin to visit Pakistan, an offer
 which first appeared in the 1972 communique.

 USSR
 A conservative has now been appointed as chief editor of the
 prestigious literary journal NOVY MIR, long  the rallying point
 for Soviet liberals and the target of relentless attacks by the
 ideological hardliners.  TASS on 29 October revealed that
 55-year old Sergey Narovchatov, chief of the Moscow branch of
 the writers union, has been named to the post most recently held
 by 64-year old liberal Valeriy Kosolapov.   Kosolapov had become
 chief editor in early 1970, when outspoken liberal Aleksandr
 Tvardovskiy was forced out.  Although Kosolapov ran the journal
 much more cautiously than his predecessor, he appears to have
 fallen into disfavor late this summer; in September he was
 demoted from chief editor to ordinary member  of the editorial
 board.
 Rumors of Narovchatov's impending appointment were reported in
 the 15 October FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, and the 29 October TASS
 account referred to him as the "newly appointed" chief editor.
 The September issue of NOVY MIR, which was signed to press on
 11 September, listed the deputy chief editor and responsible
 secretary but no chief editor, carrying Kosolapov's name only as
 a member of the board.   The August issue,  signed to press
 5 August, had identified Kosolapov as chief editor.   No other
 board members were affected as of September.
 Although there has been no recent public criticism of NOVY TIR
 which would account for the change, the FRANKFURTER ALLGEIIEINE
 account claimed that the July issue of the journal had originally
 been slated to carry a war novel on the Crimean Tartars, whom
 Stalin had ce.ported during the war and whose fate has remained
 a sensitive issue for the regime since.  A similar lapse in
 political caution had apparently caused Kosolapov's earlier
 ouster from the LITERARY GAZETTE chief editorship in the December
 1962 crackdown.   Reports at the time indicated that he was being
 punished for having published Yevtushenko's controversial poem
 "Babiy Yar" and for refusing to print an article attacking
 abstract art.
 Whereas Kosoi.apov's replacement of Tvardovskiy in 1970 represented
 no basic shift in the liberal orientation of PTOVY MIR, the present
 change replaces a. liberal with a writers union apparatchik who is
 known as an assailant of dissenters.   Narovcha tov has risen quickly

 in the conservativ(s writers union hierarchy,  having been elected
 a secretary of the Moscow branch in January 1965, of the RSFSR
 union in March 1970 and of the USSR union in November 1970, and
 having succeeded literary hatchetman Sergey Mikhalkov as 'oscow
 first secretary in May 1970.  Although not as strident as Mikhalkov,
 Narovchatov has repeatedly criticized dissenting and erring writers.
 Most recently, at a 27 February 1974 Moscow writers plenum reported
 in the 8 March LITERARY RUSSIA, he assailed poet Yevgeniy Yevtushenko
 for defending Solzhenitsyn and called on him to finally grow up and
 act his age.   Narovchatov, himself a poet, has long shown a special
 animus against Yevtushenko.  Among other indications, he bitterly
 assailed him at the March 1965 RSFSR Writers Union congress.
 FURTSEVA DEATH AMIDST SCANDALS CLOSES STORMY CAREER
 Radio Moscow on 25 October announced the death of Culture Minister
 Yekaterina Furtseva, of a heart attack at age 63.   Furtseva's
 death came at a low pint in her career, in which scandals affecting
 both her personal reputation and the performance of her ministry
 had raised the question of her removal; her death conveniently
 solves this question for the leaaership.  Her recent troubles
 recall an earlier phase in her st',r,.?y career when, after the
 22d CPSU Congress, she was dropped from the Presidium and
 disappeared for several weeks amidst rumors of severe illness and
 attempted suicide.
 Furtseva's recent troubles began last spring, when it was revealed
 that she had misused her position to build herself an expensive
 dacha.   In May stories reached Western reporters that she had
 been rebuked and would not be reelected to the Supreme Soviet
 because of the scandal.   The New York TIDIES followed up this
 initial 25 May account with a 13 June report that she had not been
 assigned a Supreme Soviet election district when registration
 closed on 12 May, but that she had appealed to Brezhnev, who had
 promised to help.   The TIMES al.so quoted a government source close
 to the Supreme Soviet Presidium as telling foreigners that she
 had subsequently been assigned a district and the paper added that
 at a 31 May news conference she had hinted to reporters that
 she would be a candidate after all.   Yet when the newly elected
 deputies were listed on 19 June, she we  not included, a fact which
 gave rise to speculation that she would not be reappointed culture
 minister when the new government was announced in July.

 However, if such was the intention, the leadership vacillated,
 perhaps not wanting to aggravate the scandal by removing her
 in the midst of the publicity over the dacha+..       Moreover, in
 an apparent effort to dispel Western speculation, she played
 a prominent public role during Nixon's late June visit, attend-
 ing the opera with Nixon, Brezhnev, Podgornyy, Kosygin, Gromyko
 and Ambassador Dobrynin on 28 June and being present at the
 29 June signing of an economic-technica' cooperation agreement.
 Stories of her impending disgrace were further put in doubt by
 her reappointment as minister at the 26 July Supreme Soviet
 session..
 Her posi,-ion may have further deteriorated in September, however.
 when the authorities brutally broke up an unauthorized abstract
 art show in a Moscow suburban district, an act resulting in such
 bad publicity abroad that the leadership fired the local district
 party leader and permitted the restaging of the show.*  While
 there was no public evidence that Furtseva was personally involved
 in either the original suppression of the 15 September art show or
 in the subsequent backdown, her ministry must'have taken a st;:nd
 in the dispute over handling the show.
 This issue has still not died down, as evidenced by an attack on
 the second art show in the 23 October issue of the 'Zoscow city
 paper VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA.   The article contended that the show
 proved the artistic poverty of the painters and justified the
 contention of Moscow officials at the 28 September press confer-
 ence that the whole affair was being exaggerated.
 Furtseva'u past reported attempt at suicide had occurred during
 her biggest political setback, when she lost her position in the
 top leadership in late 1961.  At the close of the 22d CPSU Congress,
 when she w4s dropped from the Central Committee Presidium, she
 disappeared for several weeks amidst rumors of bitter clashes,
 serious illness and attempted suicide.   Since that drastic fall,
 she has managed to retain only the relatively powerless position
 of culture minister, a post she seemed on the verge of losing
 when her death occurred.

 PRC-INDIA:   Peking has not yet explicitly aci,nowledged Secretary
 Kissinger's 27-30 October visit to New Delhi, but it offered an
 unusually harsh indictment of Indian expansionist policies and
 Soviet support for New Delhi in a lengthy NCNA commentary issued
 on the very day Kissinger arrived in India.   The commentary
 warned against Indian designs, "emboldened by Soviet social
 imperialist backing," for military, political and economic
 dominance in South Asia and denounced a series of recent Indian
 moves against every one of its neighbors except Burma and
 Ceylon.   Calling special attention to New Delhi's expanded
 military budget and nuclear development program,  the commentary
 asserted that India sought to use its new power to intimidate and
 gradually bring its smaller neighbors under direct New Delhi
 control.   Pointing to the behind-the-scenes role played by the
 USSR, it warned that Moscow has its own motives for supporting
 Indian expansion, claiming that it desires to enhance Soviet
 leverage in South Asia at the expense of "the other superpower."
 PRC-USSR-MIDEAST:  Peking has responded for the first time to the
 "change" in Soviet Middle East policy concerning the Palestinian
 question with a lengthy 27 October NCNA commentary.   NCNA's argument
 that the Soviet "shift" was prompted by the recent change in the
 superpower balance of forces in the Middle East was pegged to an
 11 October speech in Kishinev in which Brezhnev had expressed support
 for a Palestinian national home as well as for Palestinian participa-
 tion at the Geneva peace conference.   NCNA pointedly noted that
 previously Moscow had criticized the Palestinian liberation struggle
 and had even treated their plight as a "refugee issue."  Pointing to
 Secretary Kissinger's successful diplomatic efforts in the Middle
 East since early this year, NCNA asserted that the United States
 "has gone over to the offensive" while "the Soviet revisionists have
 been forced on the defensive and their influence has decreased."
 Peking claimed that Brezhnev's recent endorsement merely signals a
 new Soviet effort "to stage a comeback in the Middle East" by
 exploiting enhanced support fur the Palestinians and especially for
 the latter's participation at the Geneva talks "as a counter in
 their bargaining with U.S.  imperialism."  Peking has thus far
 totally ignored the 14-18 October Moscow visit by Egyptian Foreign
 Minister Fahmi during which the endorsement of a Palestinian national
 home was reiterated.  Peking has similarly remained silent on
 Brezhnev's planned January visit to Egypt.

 MOSCOW, PEKING ON U.S.-JAPAN TIES:   Contrasting Moscow and Peking
 exploitation of the current controversy in Japan over the presence
 of U.S. nuclear weapons reflects their varying approaches to the
 question of U.S.-Japan security ties and the U.S.  military
 presence in Japan.  While Peking reported developments briefly
 and selectively with its usual circumspection toward the United
 States, Moscow not only reported the controversy but also
 originated comment pointing up the alleged dangers of Japan's
 security ties with the United States.   A 9 October signed
 IZV:LSTIYA article, for exai,iple, argued that Japanese observers
 were questioning the reliability of Washington's promise of
 prior consultations before bringing nuclear weapons into Japan.
 The article also asserted that the "so-called Japanese-American
 security treaty" was now under serious review in Japan.  While
 Moscow media have portrayed the United States as the main villain
 in the current controversy, a 22 October PRAVDA article chided
 Japanese Government representatives for attempting  to "protect
 the Pentagon" and "whitewash" U.S.-Japanese military cooperation.
 In contrast to Moscow, Peking's treatment has been very low key,
 limited thus far to a pair of NCNA pickups of Japanese news agency
 reports.   A 22 October replay of a TOHO news agency report on the
 21 October Anti-war Day demonstrations in Japan did, however, include
 a rare call for abrogation of the U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty,
 a theme not seen in PRC media since last April.   NCNA reportage on
 rally speeches excluded denunciations of President Ford's planned
 November visit to Japan; in fact, monitored Chinese media have not
 yet been heard to acknowledge the announced visit.
 CHINESE EDUCATION:   Shanghai, a model province whose example is often
 followed throughout China,  appears engaged in a drive to improve the
 level of instruction in local primary and secondary schools.
 Shanghai's WEN HUI PAO on 23 October frontpaged a letter from local
 teachers and students entitled "Let Students Learn More Skills in
 School" w1iich came down unusually hard on the "expert" side of the
 "red and expert" formulation.   The letter complained frankly that
 recent middle school graduates "still show weaknesses in certain
 fields."  Placing responsibility for the poor quality of vocational
 education on the shoulders of 1c.al educational authorities, a
 separate WEN HUI PAO editor's note asked "our comrades on the
 educational front" why students could not "learn more skills in
 school."  Shanghai's efforts to improve the quality of education
 had been reflected in an 8 October Shanghai broadcast which hinted
 that sorr.e college applicants may now be admitted primarily on the
 basis of their academic considerations.   The report noted that special

 attention was paid to enrolling "some of those who had truly
 performed well," and it revealed that Shanghai enrollment officials
 were careful to "insure the  Iuality of the admitted students."
 Shanghai's lead in raising educational standards apparently has
 been followed in Kiangsu.   A 20 October Nanking broadcast on local
 student enrollment work also noted that rpecial attention was paid
 to enrolling those applicants who "had truly performed well."
 CHINESE RETAIL OUTLETS:  Peking's current push to increase light
 industrial output significantly in the fourth quarter of 1974
 appears linked to an innovative Anhwei campaign to expand urban
 markets by setting up a series of "marketing agent stores"
 supplementing the network of state commercial centers.   Judging
 by a 26 October ANHWEI DAILY editorial, a number of safeguards
 govern the new--and apparently controversial--retail organs in
 order to prevent any resurgence of small-scale capitalism.
 Existing state stores provide all operating funds and commodities
 for the new outlets and will set all prices.   Accumulated funds
 must be turned over to state commerce departments, and all business
 activities of the new stores are to be developed according to party
 and state economic plans.   Nevertheless,  the very existence of such
 stores, providing a buffer between the shopper and the state,
 represents a step back from the purer forms of communism.   The
 editorial frankly admitted that the new stores were being set up
 over the objections of some "dubious" commercial leaders who faared
 that the new outlets would prove "difficult to control or manage."
 Control responsibilities for the retail outlets rest with local
 party leaders, who were instructed to take the necessary steps to
 support the growth of this "new thing."
 ALBANIAN DEFENSE MINISTER:  Premier Shehu announced on 29 October
 that he would assume the position of defense minister,  thus confirming
 rumors that Begir Balluku, minister since 1953, had been ousted.
 Shehu's announcement came in a speech to the People's Assembly in
 which he also named a new deputy premier (a post which Balluku had
 held concurrently) as well as new finance and communications ministers.
 Judging from a lengthy summary of the speech broadcast by Tirana radio,
 Shehu did not mention Balluku, whose activities had not been reported
 since last June.   However, Shehu's remark that "the government will
 take all necessary measures to insure that our army will always remain
 ideologically pure, loyal to the party line .  .  . ," seemed to give
 substance to :peculation that Balluku was being dismissed for
 advocating a less hostile position toward Moscow.  The premier's
 speech reiterated the main lines of Hoxha's remarks on foreign

 SUPPLEMLNTARY  ARTICLE
 NEW FIRST DEPUTY EDITOR STRENGTHENS HARDLINE TREND AT PRAVDA
 The appointment of hardliner R.I. Kosolapov as PRAVDA's new
 first deputy chief editor gives the CPSU organ its most
 conservative leadership since the 1950's.  Kosolapov, formerly
 Agitprop deputy head, replaced V.G. Afanasyev, who simultaneously
 was named new chief editor of KOMMUNIST.   The two appointments--
 announced in the October issue of the journal ZHURNALIST, signed
 to press 17 September--suggest a trade-off, the promotion of the
 anti-intellectual hardliner Kosolapov, balanced by that of the
 more moderate Afanasyev.   Whether or not such a trade-off was
 actually made, the Kosolapov appointment clearly strengthens the
 reactionary wing,  since he becomes chief PRAVDA spokesman for
 theory and ideology at a time when the conservative Zimyanin is
 chief editor.
 Kosolapov was last publicly identified as deputy head of Agitprop
 in the 16 July MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA.  Afanasyev was listed as
 KOMMUNIST chief editor in its issue signed to press 5 September
 but not in the previous issue signed to press 13 August.   Other
 ideological decisions--such as the adoption of the Central
 Committee decree on Belorussian ideological work--also appear to
 have occurred in this same period.*
 BACKGROUND         Kosolapov, a 44-year old philosopher, has been
 ON KOSOLAPOV       identified as a lecturer or consultant in the
 Central Committee's propaganda section since the
 mid-1960's, but he was promoted to deputy head of the section
 only relatively recently, first being identified in this post in
 the 2 February 1974 PRAVDA.   His articles in the 25 May 1968
 PRAVDA and Mny 1971 CUESTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY--attacking the idea
 of regarding intellectuals as some sort of "elite" or "technocratic"
 class and insisting on their subordination Lo the proletariat--
 identify him as one of the more conservative figures in the
 ideological field, an impression reinforced by his 1974 articles
 on international affairs and detente.   In a long 21 January 1974 PRAVDA
 article he stressed that peaceful coexistence "in no way means
 an end to the class struggle between socialism and capitalism
 in all its forms" but simply the "rejection of direct military
 confrontation and use of force and threats of force," a result
 which the West had been forced to accept by the strengthening

 of world socialism.   In a May 1974 QUESTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY
 article Kosolapov tackled the problem of squaring peaceful
 coexistence and cooperation with capitalist governments with
 the need to aid revolutionary forces in overthrowing these
 governments.   He stressed the "sharp, implacably hostile"
 ideological war and the dangers of "ideological penetration"
 and warned against "slipping into positions of right opportunism
 and unprincipled compromises with class enemies."  He condemned
 a long list of errors, including "pseudorevolutionary adventurism,
 preaching export of revolution,  inciting useless conflicts which
 can. bring only losses, and playing with fire."   in his new job at
 PRAVDA he will take over Afanasyev's role as enunciator of theory
 and presumably will supervise PRAVDA's department for propaganda
 of Marxist-Leninist theory.
 PRAVDA TREND TOWARDS      Kosolapov's appointment clearly strengthens
 CONSERVATIVISM            the conservative faction in PRAVDA and
 highlights how far PRAVDA has regressed
 in the last ten years from its liberal orientation under chief
 editor A.M. Rumyantsev and deputy chief editor N.N. Inozemtsev in
 1965.   Most of the liberal influence that developed under Khrushchev
 and in the immediate aftermath of Khrushchev's fall was eliminated
 during tha late 1965-66 purge of PRAVDA.   Liberal chief editor
 Rumyantsev was removed in September 1965, followed by responsible
 secretary S.B. Sutotskiy around the turn of the year, and liberal
 deputy chief editor Inozemtsev in May 1966.   Rumyantsev became
 academic secretary of the Academy of Sciences' economics division,
 Sutotskiy went on pension, and Inozemtsev became director of the
 Institute o` World Economics and International Relations.
 During this period most of the top pos.-.s at PRAVDA were taken over
 by persons brought in from the outside.   Conservative Deputy Foreign
 Minister M.V. Zimyanin became chief editor; SOVIET RUSSIA chief
 editor K.I. Zarodov became first deputy chief editor; RSFSR
 Publishing Committee Chairman B.I. Stukalin became deputy chief
 editor; KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA chief editor Yu. P. Voronov became
 responsible secretary of the editorial board; SOVIET RUSSIA
 responsible secretary S.V. Tsukasov became first deputy responsible
 secretary; deputy head of the Central Committee's culture section
 G.I. Kunitsyn became editor of the literature and art department;
 and the head of the party life department of the journal PROBLEMS

 Kunitsyn's late 1966 appointment was especially revealing, since
 he had joined in the att?icks on Rumyarr;`sev at the time of the
 latter's ouster in late 1965.   Kunitsyn, author of a book on
 "party spirit" in literature, in a November 1965 KOMMUNIST article
 had attacked the liberal interpretation of Lenin's attitude
 toward art propounded by NOVY MIR and Rumyantsev and reasserted
 the right to expel writers from the writers union for ideological
 deviations.*  With Kunitsyn's arrival at PRAVDA., literature and
 art editor N.A. Abalkin was demoted to an observer in that
 department, and Rumyantsev's line on culture was reversed.  As.
 new literature and art editor; Kunitsyn helped prepare the 1968
 ideological crackdown.   This was done in a 16 February 1968
 LITERARY RUSSIA article which argued that Lenin was willing to
 tolerate artistically deficient literature as long as it was
 politically useful, and a 29 February 1968 PRAVDA article which
 attacked the  "legend" that Lenin had been tolerant toward hostile
 trends in art--a view promoted by Rumyantsev in his 9 September 1965
 PRAVDA article.
 New theory editor Kovalev also played a key role in this conservative
 trend, authoring a notorious 26 September 1968 PRAVDA article
 introducing the "Brezhnev doctrine" of the right to intervene in
 other socialist countries.  By no means all of the 1965-1966
 additions were as conservative as Zimyanin, Kunitsyn and Kovalev,
 however.  Voronov, icr example, had   bravely--even recklessly--
 crus-ded against Lysenko both before such attacks were officially
 sanctioned and after they had ceased elsewhere, and his transfer
 from KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA was presumably intended to end the
 unwanted criticisms in this regard.
 Moreover, some out-and-out liberals remained among the survivors
 at PRAVDA.   Political observer F.M. Burlatskiy and collegium
 member L.V. Karpinskiy, clearly rank in this category.   They
 created a furor by publishing an article in the 30 June 1967
 KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA attacking censorship.   KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA
 was forced to run an editorial on 8 July attacking the article as
 a "gross ideological error," and Burlatskiy and Karpinskiy left
 PRAVDA's staff.   Earlier, Burlatskiy had apparently stepped out
 of line by interpreting Kosygin's remarks at a London press conference
 on 9 February 1967, as implying a more favorable Soviet attitude
 toward the idea of limiting ABM's than the facts apparently warranted.
 Reports leaked to Western newsmen after the event indicated the
 article was in error.

 FBIS TRENDS
 31 OCTOBER 1974
 Another shakeup hit PRAVDA in the late summer and fall of 1968,
 in connection with the Czech events and the ideological turmoil
 of that year.   First deputy editor Zarodov was packed off to
 Prague as chief editor of PROBLEMS OF PEACE AND SOCIALISM  about
 the time of the invasion and Voronov was replaced as responsible
 secretary.   Deputy chief editor Stukalin was promoted to first
 deputy chief editor, Afanasyev came from the Academy of Social
 Sciences to become deputy chief editor for ques::iorrs of theory,
 PRAVDA's editor for the socialist countries department A.I. Lukovets
 advanced to deputy chief editor, and first deputy responsible
 secretary Tsukasov moved up to responsible secretary.
 Kunitsyn left PRAVDA in early 1969 and Kovalev in late 1971, but
 other conservatives have come to PRAVDA, including such radical
 types as anti-Semitic propagandist V.V. Bolshakov, who became deputy
 responsible secretary in charge of PRAVDA's international departments
 in 1970.   Bolshakov wrote articles going beyond official anti-Israeli
 policy and even implicitly criticizing official positions as too
 soft on Israel and the Jews.*  His personal crusade against the Jews
 appears to have ended only recently.   The September 1974 ZHURNALIST
 announced that Bolshakov had been transferred abroad as a PRAVDA
 correspondent, stationed in far off Australia, New Zealand and
 Oceania.
