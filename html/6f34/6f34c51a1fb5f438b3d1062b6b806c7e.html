 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 August 195?
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 SOVIET MISSILE ANNOUNCEMENT AND DISARMAMENT TACTICS
 The Soviet press agency
 TASS on 26 August announced
 that an intercontinental bal-
 listic missile (ICBM) had been
 successfully tested to "a huge
 distance" in the USSR "in recent
 days.'`  It had been estimated
 that the USSR would be capable,,
 in the relatively near future,
 of launching an ICBM?  TASS also
 called attention to a recent
 series of nuclear and thermonu-
 clear explosions in the USSR.
 The most recent Soviet nuclear
 test--the first since last April
 --took place on 22 August.  There
 is no evidence that this explo-
 sion was associated with the
 firing of an IGBM.
 The TASS announcement, to-
 getheir with Valerian Zorin's
 subsequent speeches in the
 United Nations Disarmament Sub-
 committee in London, seems to
 foreshadow a major effort. by
 the USSR in the forthcoming UN
 General Assembly session to win
 support for its proposed,suspen--
 sion of nuclear weapons tests
 and agreement not to use nuclear
 weapons or missiles with nu-
 clear warheads.
 The TASS announcement in-
 cluded the standard charge of
 Western obstruction of a dis-
 armament agreement, particularly
 with respect to cessation of nu-
 clear tests.  The Soviet pro-
 posals of 30 April and ? June
 for a partial disarmament agree-
 ment called for renunciation
 of the use-for military purposes
 of both nuclear weapons and
 missiles of any-range carrying
 nuclear warheads.  Moscow prob-
 PART  I   OF
 ably believes that its announce-
 ment will increase world-wide
 support for its proposed bans
 on testing and use, placing the
 Western powers in an increasing-
 ly untenable position.
 Far these purposes the
 Soviet Union appears eager to
 tz?ansfer  the discussions from
 the subcommittee to ..the General
 Assembly, where it is also like-
 ly to repeat its proposals of
 last year for an expansion of
 the Disarmament Commission and
 Subcommittee to include coun-
 tries such as India which are
 sympathetic to its viewpoint.
 Zorin's speech of 2? August
 included a strong attack on the
 subcommittee, because it was
 responsive to the demands of
 NATO but ignored the views of
 other countries.  He called for
 the inclusion of more states,
 representing other geographical
 areas and social systems, in
 the disarmament talks.  Zarin
 criticized the secrecy under
 which the subcommittee operates
 as a Western device to keep
 public opinion in ignorance and
 to create the false impression
 of progress toward agreement.
 His remarks recalled Khrushchev's
 criticism of the "NATO subcom-
 mittee" in July.
 Zarin also delivered a
 strong attack on the principle
 of aerial inspection, which he
 said could not prevent a sur-
 prise attack, and the specific
 zones proposed by the West.  He
 charged that the plan for in-
 spection of the United States,

 Canada, and the USSR was an
 intelligence-collection scheme
 to plan for aggressive war
 while the Arctic inspection
 plan was useless.  He ignored
 entirely the Western plan for
 inspection in Europe although
 the USSR has put same emphasis
 on inspection in that area
 Soviet statements on aerial in-
 spection in the past have alter-
 nated betweeh counterproposals
 to Western plans and denuncia-
 tions of the whole idea.
 The American delegate in
 London  considered  Zorin's
 speech an indication that the
 -USSR was preparing further con-
 cessions to meet the West in
 a first-step  agreement and
 believed the harsh-tone  of-the
 speech was  intended to off-
 set any impression that these
 concessions  might be a sign
 of  weakness.  He considered
 it possible, however,. that
 Moseow may be developing a
 propaganda     position ~:y:to be
 used in the event of~a  fail-
 ure to             reement at

 KHRUSHCHEV RESUMES ATTACK ON
 Publication in the USSR
 this week of new and more seri-
 ous charges against Malenkov
 after a period of  relative  quiet
 in the campaign against  the
 "antiparty" group seems to be
 an attempt to create a new gen-
 eral-wave of popular indigna-
 tion.  Reports from Moscow in-
 dicate that the current mood
 of manq Soviet citizens is one
 of depression, cynicism, and
 distrust of present party lead-
 ers.
 By linking Malenkov with
 Beria, Khrushchev prob~.bly hopes
 to transfer to Malenkov some of
 the revulsion Soviet citizens
 still feel toward the executed
 police chief.  The new charges
 day the groundwork for possible
 further punitive action against
 Malenkov and will serve as an
 additional warning to any who
 might be less than enthusiastic
 for Khrushchev's policies.
 Malenkov is characterized
 as  Beria's ''shadow and tool,,"
 who 'ivery skillfully"  took- ad-
 vantage of Stalin's weaknesses
 and habits in the last year's
 of  his  life.    He  is charged
 with having incited Stalin to
 take action which was deserving
 of "stern condemnation."  This
 is only a short step from ac-
 cusing him of responsibility
 for the worst excesses of the
 latter part of the .Stalin era.
 The new attack on Malenkov
 was contained in an article
 published in the most recent
 issue of the ,party journal,
 Kommunist.  The article is based
 on ~ ree unpublished speeches
 Khrushchev is reported to have
 made between Hay and July of
 this year.  The speech in which
 the charges against Malenkov
 were made was probably either
 one he gave to the Moseow city
 party organization on 2 July
 or one he gave to the Moscow
 Oblast party organization on 3
 July.  At these meetings the
 "antiparty" activities of the
 ousted leaders were explained,
 Malenkov was probably
 singled out far .attack because
 he was Khrushchev's leading
 rival and must dangerous oppo-
 nent.  In the propaganda barrage
 following the June plenum he
 was treated as the most degen-
 erate member of the "antiparty
 group," being the only member

 of the. opposition, for instance,
 charged with being a chief or-
 ganizer of the notorious "Len-
 ingrad affair" far which Abakumov
 was blamed and executed in 1954.
 The diversity of treatment
 thus far accorded the members
 of the ''antiparty group" sug-
 gests that eaoh cake is being
 considered separately and that
 the fate of the other opponents
 is not necessarily wrapped up
 with that of Malenkov.  But
 while the other members of the
 group have not`been publicly
 accused of misdeeds as serious
 as those charged to Malenkov,
 further action may vet be taken
 a:gains t them.
 SYRIAN DEVELOPMENTS
 Further dismissals of
 Syrian civilian government of-
 f icials, especially the key
 secretaries general of the
 various ministries, appear im-
 minent,  Akram Iiawrani, Baathist
 leader, has voiced the opinion
 that the government departments
 are "infiltrated"  with  the
 "lackeys of imperialism" who
 must be rooted out.        It is re-
 ported that the Foreign Ministry
 will be  the first affected.
 Concurrent with the beginnings
 of the purge, testimony impli-
 cating dismissed senior army
 officers in a conspiracy against
 the state may be released and
 a series of "treason" trials
 can be expected soon.
 While the power relation-
 ships in Syria remain unclear,
 preliminary indications are that
 the recent purge of the neutral
 and pro-Western officers hasi
 resulted in a sweeping victory
 for the leftist, nationalist
 officer group known as the "Lit-
 tle Revolutionary Command Coun-
 cil (RCC)."  These officers,
 who as military caddis witnessed
 the defeat of the Syrian army
 by the Israeli  ~in 1948, have
 as their professed goal the res-
 torationof the army's honor.
 A necessary requisite far at-
 tai#~ment of  this objective was
 the elimination from the army
 of discredited older leaders
 who the  "Little RCC" felt stood     25X1
 in the way of  effective army
 reform.
 The "Little RCC,?'  because
 of its phobia regarding Israel,
 is basically pro-USSR and anti-
 Western.  It views the USSR as
 a source of armaments and as an
 ally in its struggle against
 Western "imperialism" and Zi~n-
 ism.  Rather than being pro~-
 Communist domestically the group
 regards the Communists in much
 the same light as other Syrian
 political groups.  All such
 political activities are under
 army surveillance, and a prema-
 ture bid for power by the local
 Communists might be opposed by
 the RCC group..  Whether the
 "Little RCC" will be able to
 cope with Communist infiltration
 and imperialism will depend on

 the extent and manner of the

 tive that would suggest Soviet

 States attempted a coup d'~etat.
 It is supporting Syria's claims
 that the Syrian-Soviet economic

 meets on the increasingly close
 economic relationship to Syrian
 spokesmen.
 Neighboring Countries' Reaction
 Reaction in neighboring
 countries toward events in Syria
 remains varied; Lebanon and
 Jordan, the two countries most
 susceptible to Syrian subver-
 sion, continue to await further
 developments apprehensively.
 Lebanon has tightened border
 controls and entries from Syria.
 With Jordan's internal situa-
 tion precarious, beputy Prime
 Minister Samir Rifai has stated
 that he believes a federation
 of Jordan and Iraq may be the
 only political move left by
 which pro-Western Arabs can re-
 sist the pressure emanating
 from the consolidation of a
 leftist regime in Syria.  Rifai
 believes that King Saud's bless-
 ing would be necessary before
 such a move could be made.
 Iraq's palace spokesman,
 Crown Prince Abd al-Ilah, re-
 turned to Ba~,ghdad on 26 August
 from ?Istanbul~ where he had been
 consulting with Turkish offi-
 cials.  The .Baghdad government's
 public  reaction  to  Syrian
 developments has been relative-
 ly weak, however.  Up to the
 present King Saud has remained
 publicly silent
 e  s coat nuing to
 carry out common military plan-
 ning with Nasr on the Gulf of
 Aqaba problem.  The Turks,
 while concerned over the pos-
 sibili~ty of  having a Communist
 neighbor to the south, have
 maintained a discreet silence
 but have been carrying on dis-
 cussions with the ,Iraqis and
 with King Hussain when he passed
 tkarough Istanbul on his way to
 Europe.
 Although Nasr may well be
 concerned over the apparent
 leftward shift within Syria and
 may be expected to do his utmost
 to maintain Egyptian influence
 in Syria, the Syrian situation
 has not affected the overt Egyp-
 tian attitude toward the United
 States.  Cairo radio continues
 to elaborate on charges of Amer-
 ican intervention in Syria of -

 CURRENT INTELLIGENGE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 August 195?
 SOVIET-SYRIAN EGONO~IIG RELATIONS
 A three-man mission led
 by the chairman of Syria's eco-
 nomic development board is in
 Moscow to negotiate details- of
 the preliminary Soviet-Syrian
 economic aid agreement reached
 in early August.  In the earlier
 Moscow discussions, the Soviet
 Union made its first firm offer
 to undertake a long-term eco-
 nomic development program in a
 Middle Eastern country.
 Carrying out of the aid
 agreement would permit the-USSR
 to exert substantial influence
 over the Syrian economy, not
 only by determining the direc-
 tion and pace of economic de-
 velopment through the provision
 of machinery and Soviet special-
 ists, but also by requiring
 Syria to commit a significant
 share of its exports for along
 period.
 In the preliminary aid
 agreement, Moscow indicated
 willingness to supply equip-
 ment and technical assistance
 for the extension of Latakia
 harbor, construction of a
 Euphrates River dam for power
 acrd irrigation, and of  roads and
 railways, and a build-up of
 Syrian industries .as soon as
 preliminary surveys are made.
 The aid, reportedly amount-
 ing to well over $100,000,000,
 is to be repaid over a 12-year
 period at 2.5-percent interest.
 To increase the attractiveness
 of the deal, the USSR has of -
 fered to purchase 200,000 tons
 of wheat (worth about $15,000,
 000) or other Syrian commodities.
 Half of the returns from these
 sales is to be applied as pay-
 ment under the economic aid
 agreement and half is to be
 made in foreign currency.
 'phis offer suggests that
 the USSR, a net exporter of
 grain, is willing to purchase
 any Syrian export item, prob-
 ably on a long-term basis, to
 convince Syria it can earn suffi-
 cient credits to meet its pay-
 ments obligations arising fram
 the economic aid and earlier
 arms deals.  Without such an
 agreement Syria would find it
 financially difficult to com-
 mit itself to Soviet aid far
 its economic development plan.
 An intensified shift away
 fram Western partners in Syria's
 trade pattern may have been an
 additional aim of the Soviet
 offer.      Nearly 50 percent of
 Syria's mayor export crop, cot-
 ton, was sold to the bloc dur-
 ing the last marketing year.
 During this same period, however,
 Soviet purchases from Syria were
 small and accounted for only
 3 percent of Syrian cotton ex-
 ports.
 The USSR apparently intends
 to use the Syrian agreement as
 a basis for promoting further
 Soviet-sponsored economic de-
 velopment programs in the Mid-
 dle East.  Moscow has offered
 within the past week to provide
 the Sudan with large-scale eco-
 nomic assistance and to pro-
 vide Iran with "unlimited cred-
 it at 2 percent" for heavy in-
 dustrial development.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 KADAR REGIME UNEASY OVER UN DEBATE
 On the eve of the United.
 Nations General Assembly ses-~
 sion, the  Kadar  regime  is ~aki.ng
 .renewed efforts to establish
 firm control in Hungary and dis-
 pel rumors of a more liberal
 political line, because con-
 cessions might encourage dissi-
 dent domestic elements. Kadar
 fears Hungarian popular re-
 action to possible General
 Assembly condemnation, and the
 Kremlin is concerned over the
 effects of such condemnation on
 its own international prestige.
 In recent weeks the regime
 has attempted to reinforce in -
 ternal stability by mass ar-
 rests of potential opposition
 leaders among youths, workers,
 and the population at large,
 and has simultaneously conduc~G-
 ed a  widespread purge of work-
 ers';  organizations--including
 the trade union council--to
 eliminate elements identified
 with the suspect workers' coun-
 cils.  Although the arrest
 wave ended last week, the re-
 gime has not yet released any
 significant number of those
 arrested and is continuing to
 mete-out heavy sentences--often
 death--to persons labeled
 "counterrevolutionaries,"  Pre-
 mier-Kadar himself on 20 Aug-
 ust  defiantly ,justified  the
 arrests with the declaration
 that some people thought not
 enough ''enemies" had been
 arrested.
 It  is  likely that Kra:dar?
 will eventually resign as pre-
 mier, but will .continue to
 maintain top authority as par-
 ty first secretary, thereby
 conforming to current bloc
 practice.  In this event, his
 most probable successor would
 be First Deputy Premier Ferenc
 Muennich, with Minister of
 State Gyo~gq Marosan another
 passibility.  Neither would be
 an improvement over Kadar.
 Muennich, once considered a
 distinguished Communist with
 some reputation for moderation,
 is associated in his role as
 minister of armed and security
 forces with the merciless re-
 pression of insurgent elements
 following the uprising.  Mar-
 osan, a former social demo-
 crat with pronounced demagogic
 gifts, has shown himself will-
 ing to defend any cause on be-
 half  of  the  Kremlin.
 There appears to be little
 possibility that Imre Nagy will
 be rehabilitated as Hungarian
 premier, despite recent rumors
 to that effect.  He remains a
 symbol of national resistance
 to Kremlin domination and his
 rehabilitation might encour-
 age-.dangerous anti-Soviet pas-
 sions among-the populace.
 The Hungarian regime will
 use every tactic, possibly in-
 cluding show trials, to coun-
 ter the US speCial.eommittee
 report on Hungary and to sup-
 port its own contention that
 -the November uprising was en-
 gineered by the United States
 and Britain.  This might in-
 clude a trial of Colonel Pal
 Maleter,  minister  of  defense
 during the uprising, who re-
 portedly has been subjected
 to interrogation since his
 arrest by Soviet officials on
 3 November.  A recent uncon-
 firmed press report states
 that Maleter had broken under
 torture and signed a confes-
 sion .that he.was'.in.~:coritact
 with American and British offi-
 cials during the revolution and
 specifically that he passed
 information to the British
 military attach.

 BTJLC~ARIA SEEKS  RAPPROCHEMENT WITH NEST
 Recent statements by Bul-
 garian Premier Anton Yugov and
 specific actions by his govern-
 ment indicate that the drive
 for better relations with the
 West--initiated in the spring
 of 1956 but suspended six
 months later--has been resumed.
 Probably prompted by the re-
 emphasis on peaceful coexist-
 ence in Soviet foreign policy,
 these renewed overtures may
 indicate greater willingness
 than in any previous period
 to compromise on specific is-
 sues. that. have.heretaf?re iso-
 lated Bulgaria from tt~e -free
 world.
 Yugov told a  leftist  Greek
 parla.amentary deputy on 20
 August that Bulgaria has ap-
 pointed a commission to ne-
 gotiate a "fina:l solution" of
 the remaining difficulties ~'
 with Greece.  As evidence of
 improving relations between
 the two countries, he painted
 nut the sharp increase in trade
 --from $974,000 in 1955 to
 about $4,000,000 in 1956--and
 the opening of hn exchange
 point an the Greek-Bulgarian
 frontier, all communications
 and trade having previously
 gone through Turkey,  The major
 obstacle to improved relations
 has been the $45,000,000 World
 War II reparations debt owed
 Greece.  Although the Bul-
 garians acknowledge this debt,
 in previous negotiations they
 have offered only $2,000,000
 as an initial payment against
 a Greek demand fvr $6,000,000.
 In a move to improve re-
 lations with I~+rael, the Bul-
 garian government has offered
 to day 5I6,4~0 lava ($8,235) to
 the family of each person
 killed when Bulgat?ian antiair-

 would be divided into semi-
 autonomous terx?itories9 in two

 would be numerous enough to
 dominate and could be expected
 to block the emergence of a

 military matters, and finances,
 and would decide disputes be-

 Ahtigovernment agitation

 complaint is that the govern-

 of their traditional position
 of authority.  Controversial
 government bills to establish
 regional commissioners--who
 would be powerful agents of  the

 of paramount chiefs in southern
 Ghapa, a group which has gener-

 against actions of the four-
 manth-old Communist ministry

 Two issues primarily have
 stimulated opposition protests:

 tend their governmental control
 over Kerala's private schools
 and their apparent condoning of
 "lawless" activities by labor
 groups,
 The education bill now
 under debate in the state
 assembly is the most controver-

 give the administration wide
 powers of  supervision ove~~ staite-
 aided private schools in Kerala,
 control over the appointment
 and payment of teachers, and
 the right to take over the
 administration of any school it
 decides is mismanaged.  The
 bill has been widely attacked
 as a Communist scheme to dis-
 place the traditional educational
 system with Marxist indoctrina-
 tion.  The bill is bitterly op-
 posed by the powerful Catholic
 elements in Kerala, which own
 approximately two thirds of the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 August 1957
 The Communist rega~me has
 also come under considerable
 attack both within Kerala and
 elsewhere in-India for its poli-
 cy of limiting law enforcement
 in  labor disputes.   Wides~laread
 reports  of  "terroristic" activi-
 ties by Communist..-dominated
 labor groups, particularly
 directed  toward foreign managers
 of the state's many large plan-
 tations, have followed the
 governments order restricting
 the state police from inter-
 vening in disputes between
 labor and management.
 The much-publicized pro-
 test march on the state capital
 staged by Congress party and
 CatholYc leaders on 26 August
 T
 m         pp ren   y result-
 ed in only minor incidents which
 the government forces were able
 to control without great diffi-
 culty..
 The size and strength of
 this popular opposition in
 Kerala has not been reliably
 reported.  The Communist
 position does not appear to be
 threatened seriously as yet,
 although the ministry seems to
 have been sufficiently impressed
 with the extent of the protest
 25X1
 sentiment to make some minor
 modifications of the education
 bill prior to the 26 August
 demonstration.  While Communist
 leaders are unlikely to alter
 their basic ob,~ectives in
 Kerala, continuing public op-
 position may force  them to plaice
 even further emphasis on con-
 ciliatory tactics rather ..than ~n
 policies openly designed to ex-
 tend Communist  ontr
 state .                                      25X1
 President Siles is appar-

 program.  Both in congress and
 in the powerful national labor
 confederation, Siles has de-
 feated  the  forces of  Juan  Ledad.n,
 long Bolivia's most powerful  ?
 lobar leader.
 Lechin's attacks on the
 program last spring apparently
 impelled Siles to drive for
 dominance.  At a 17 May meeting
 of  the government party's nation-
 al political committee, Siles,
 reportedly by threatening to
 resign, gained party authori-
 zation to reorganize his cabs-

 of the Bolivian Lobar Central
 (COB), dominated by Lechin.
 Silas then instituted an in-
 tensive program of taking the
 economic stabilization issue
 directly to the people.
 Silas' opposition to the
 COB call far a general strike
 on 1 July not only prevented
 the strike and saved the eco-
 nomic program but also split
 the lobar central into pro-
 Siles and pro-Lechin factions.
 Consequently, when the nation-
 al congress opened in early
 August, new labor adherents of
 Silas combined with his moder-
 ate supporters to accept a
 resignation which leftist Vice
 President Nuflo Chavez--a Lech-
 in adherent--had offered in
 pique and had sought to re-
 call.   The pro-Silas  c~ongres-~
 siona'l m~josi.~y had previously
 ousted Lechin as president of
 the Senate, in which office he
 was legally next in line of
 succession to the presidency.
 They elected moderate Federico
 Alvarez Plata to the post.
 Opposition activity in Cuba
 has subsided since the failure
 of a general strike attempt
 early this month, and President
 Batista has moved to tighten
 his hold over the island.  The
 tenuous ,nat~~are=of his position
 is underscored, however, by?
 continuing political tension
 and rumors of increasing subver-
 sion within the armed farces;"  "
 Sabotage activities a+re
 likely to increase with the
 anticipated restoration of con-
 stitutional guarantees an or be-
 fore 15 September.
 In the COB itself, where
 a Lechin slate had won virtually
 every post in elections last
 June, the pro-Silas opposition
 gained sufficient strength by
 23 August to force the resig-
 nation of all officials except
 Lechin,  The recent record of
 the successful group suggests
 that a reconstituted COB will
 provide Silas with effective
 cooperation, at least 'tempo-
 ra~'11y:.
 Silas, however, has de-
 pended to a considerable ex-
 tent for each of these major
 victories an Juan Sanjines,
 formerly known as a Communist
 and now as a Communist sympa-
 thizer.  Sanjines, as leader of
 the key railway federation, was

 SOVIET LAWS TO COMBAT
 The RSFSR, the_largest:ot;
 the'.Soviet`..republics,. has.pub-
 lished for discussion a draft
 law against "antisocial and
 parasitical elements,"  First
 proposed this spring in the
 Baltic republics, the decree
 has since been suggested with
 only minor variations in all
 the other republics except the
 Ukraine, 73el.ar.us~saY.a ,  and Mol-
 davia.  Uzbekistan and Turk-
 menistan have already put such
 a  law into effect.
 The law empowers general
 meetings of citizens of oil-~
 loges or city blocks to sentence
 to a term of  exile of  two to
 five-years "-able-bodied adults
 who lead an antisocial, para-
 sitical life, who maliciously
 evade socially useful works or
 who live on unearned income."
 The draft  legislation specifies
 that a simple majority vote is
 required to adopt a sentence of
 exile.  The decision must then
 be submitted for confirmation
 to the executive committee of
 the district or city soviet of
 working people's deputies.  The
 punishment specified is defined
 as "obligatory engagement in
 work at a place of exile," with
 unauthorized departure punish-
 able under the existing crim-~
 inal codes.
 appear to be preparing to boy-
 cott the elections, but so far
 have failed to .agree on a com-
 mon course of action.
 Some basis for political
 stability is provided by Cuba's
 record-breaking economic pros-
 perity, by Batista's strong
 hold over the powerful labor
 movement, and by the continued
 lovalty e~  tnr~  mi l i +ary figures.
 "PARASITICAL ELEMENTS"
 The use of citizens' as-
 semblies to pass sentences is
 apparently an attempt to en-
 courage public condemnation of
 persons who-avoid productive
 work or who support themselves
 through shady dealings such as
 speculation.  One of the great
 stumbling blocks in combating
 .such problems in the past has
 been public apathy.
 Many Soviet citizens-have
 apparently been struck by the
 decree's complete disregard of
 the judicial process.  In public
 discussion, the law has met with
 an unusual amount of criticism
 and suggestions for changes.
 One of .the most often reiterated
 suggestions is that the citizens'
 assemblies should be empowered
 merely to ferret out and discuss
 cases of parasitical behavior
 in their midst and that their
 findings should then be turned
 over to the courts for handling.
 It has also been pointed out
 that the law is too vague, does
 not provide for appeal, and con-
 f licts with existing criminal
 codes.  One person dismissed it
 summarily as being completely
 unconstitutional.  In the two
 republics where it has been
 passed, however, no change has
 been made from the original
 draft version.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 29 August  195?
 While it is probable that
 the decree is viewed primarily
 as a deterrent and a means to
 stir up public censure, its
 potential for causing the per-
 secution of a great nt~m~er of
 individuals seems greats  One
 Soviet citizen commented in a
 published letter that the law
 could be usefully applied a?
 gainst school graduates who
 wait for over three months to
 get a 3 ob.
 Only a few cases of  the
 law's application have been
 reported thus far.  In one in-
 stance a collective farmer was
 exiled for five years because
 he had "avoided communal labor
 for a lang time."  Another
 farmer "who had not earned a
 single workday in a year and
 a half" requested a light sen-
 tence on the grounds that he
 was willing to reform, so the
 collective gave him a one-year
 trial period.  The latter case
 appears to be an illustration
 of what the regime hopes  the
 plish.
 FURTHER EXPANSION OF NEW LANDS IN THE USSR PROPOSED
 Soviet party secretary and
 presidium member Belyayev in
 a full-page Pravda article on
 24 August at a~`cke3 Malenkov's
 views on the grain program and
 --obviously speaking on behalf
 of Khrushchev--suggested the
 possibility of reclaiming an
 additional 30,000,000 to 37,-
 000,000-acres of new land in
 the-RSFSR in the next. two years.
 This expansion would double the
 new lands area in the RSFSR,
 which contains about 40 percent
 of the 89,000,000 acres re-
 claimed thus far in the new
 lands program.
 With the grain crap this
 year in danger of falling 10-
 15 percent below last year's,
 Khrushchev apparently considers
 a good offensive his best de-
 fense against possible charges
 that his agricultural policies
 have failed.  He apparently is
 willing to take the risks in-
 volved in a further expansion
 of grain production into virgin
 lands to bolster prospects for
 realizing his goals of catching
 up with the United States in per
 capita production of meat,  but-
 ter, and milk.  An expansion of
 the magnitude suggested would
 contribute toward these goals
 but would fall short of enabling
 the livestock goals to be met.
 Nevertheless, this proposal is
 the first which could contrib-
 ute~ significantly toward
 achieving these goals.
 Belyayev suggested that
 the yearly grain production
 from the new areas would amount
 to about 10,000,000 to 15,000,-
 000 tons, which would be roughly
 10 percent higher than the long-
 run average to be expected from
 the present grain area.  The

 USSR EXPECTS TO BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT IN INDUSTRIAL DIAMONDS
 Nerov diamond discoveries in
 the Yakutsk ASSR allegedly make
 it "quite feasible" for the
 USSR to become self-sufficient
 in industrial diamonds possibly
 during the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
 According to an article in the
 June issue of Voprosy Ekonomiki,
 Soviet annual  iamon  require-
 ments will reach six million
 carats in 1960,. with the rest
 of the "socialist camp"_requir-
 ing an additional one to three
 million carats, all of which
 will presumably be available in
 the USSR.  Production sufficient
 to meet such requirements would
 be equal to about half the 1956
 world output.
 The wide publicity in 1956
 accorded the extensive diamond
 discoveries in the Yakutsk ASSR
 indicated that the USSR hoped
 eventually to be able to dis-
 pense with imports of African
 diamonds obtained in circumven-
 tion of Western strategic trade
 controls.  The 1956 publicity,
 however, indicated that

 tion that the other
 reported. kimberlite

 prove to contain suf-
 ficient quantities of
 bort, gemstone, or
 industrial diamonds
 to warrant serious

 In addition to
 problems of location
 and climate in exploit-
 ing the Yakutsk diamond
 fields, the deposits
 are so far removed from
 civilization as to re-
 quire the establishment
 of settlements before
 extensive prospecting
 can be undertaken.
 SEc~~~~`,
 development of these diamond
 fields was not scheduled to
 begin until late in the Sixth
 Five-Yeat Plan in view of dif-
 ficulties of climate and ter-
 rain.  Apparently not foresee-
 ing the possibilities for de-
 velopment of the Yakutsk dia-
 mond industry, the USSR had in
 1955 subsidized the Indian
 Parana diamond mines,. from which
 it evidently-expected to obtain
 up to 25 percent of its require-
 ments.
 Soviet diamond output at
 present is based largely on
 placer deposits in Nyurba Raion
 and on the "Mir" kimberlite
 diamond deposit.  Although five
 other deposits are known to
 exist, only the "Mir" is known
 to be under de~relopment, and
 is believed to be the only one
 which has been sufficiently
 prospected to permit a reason-
 ably accurate estimate of the
 industrial diamond content.

 PEIPING TIGHTENS SQUEEZE ON CONSUMER
 Peiping's decision on 16
 August to reduce the cotton
 textile ration for the next
 ration year (September 1957 to
 August 1958) by more than one
 third is the most severe of
 several recent steps designed
 to impose increased austerity
 on the Chinese consumer.  In
 addition to the ration cut, the
 authorities have launched an
 intensive effort to convince
 both the rural and-urban popu-
 lace of  the necessity- for further
 reductions in food consumption
 and have sharply narrowed the
 permissible scope of the "free
 markets,"
 These measures indicate
 that Peiping is prepared to de-
 press consumer welfare below
 current low levels in order to
 fulfill plans which call for a
 slight increase in investment
 in 1958.  The authorities are
 apparently convinced that they
 can-keep. any resultant discon-
 tent within manageable limits.
 In the ration year begin-
 ning 1 September, the Chinese
 consumer will receive only
 19-21 feet of cotton cloth, the
 most important textile in China.
 This is only slightly over half
 the amount available to the
 Indian consumer.  When the pre-
 vious ration year began last
 September, the Chinese consumer
 wa.s promised an average of 29
 feet, but a disappointing cot-
 ton crop in 1956 forced the
 regime to cut back the ration
 for the second part of the ra-
 tion year by 50 percent.  The
 result was that an average of
 only 24 feet was actually issued
 during-the -year.

 systems have also been reduced

 officers, however, retain their
 favored position.
 Peiping bases its new ra-
 tion on the hope that an "av-
 erage" cotton crop between 1,-
 350,000 and 1,500,-000 tans will
 be harvested this-year.  How-
 ever,-the total acreage planted
 to cotton this year is some one
 million acres less than in 1956,
 and a half million more acres
 have reportedly been abandoned
 because of "excessive rainfall
 and floods."  Thus, the out-
 look for a crop equal to last
 'year's is bleak, and the ra-
 tion may have to be cut even
 further,  Actually, the cotton
 textile outlook over the next
 few years is almost as bleak,
 and Peiping now says that it
 will place new emphasis on the
 creation of a synthetic-fiber
 industry beginning in 1958.
 Meanwhile, the Ministry of
 Food has said that the food
 rationing system must be tight-
 ened further, and the official
 People's Daily has flatly de-
 c a-T r~~ha~'rgrain sales can
 be reduced."  This drive to
 scale down the amount of food
 consumed while insisting on in-
 creased deliveries of food by
 the peasants is an attempt to
 build up reserves which were
 badly run down last year and
 to improve the regime's shaky
 financial position.
 Moreover, the scope of
 "free markets," instituted less.,
 than a pear ago with a view to
 simplifying the market by mak-
 ing it easier for producers of
 selected commodities to reach
 their consumers, has been severe-
 ly curtailed.  A State Council
 directive of 17 August pro-
 hibits a wide range of products
 defined as coming under the
 state's centralized purchasing
 program from entering the "free
 markets" until all the state's
 demands have been met.  Only
 minor products such as poultry,
 fresh eggs, spices, a few marine
 products, and some relatively
 unimportant native medicines
 can henceforth be handled, un-
 der strict state supervision,
 in the remaining "free markets,"
 and any of these products may
 ortages develop.

 REPORTS ON MAO TSE-TUNG'S POSSIBLE RETIREMENT
 There have been unconfirmed
 reports in recent weeks that
 some Chinese Communist leaders
 are in disagreement with poli-
 cies imposed by Mao Tse-tong,
 and a rumor that Mao himself
 wishes to retire to a-scholarly
 life..    However,  most of  Mao~s
 lieutenants would probably op-
 pose his withdrawal during the
 present "time of troubles:''
 Mao is vulnerable to the
 charge of having acted impetu-
 ously in the socialization of
 agriculture in 1955-56, in the
 "liberalization" campaign of
 1956-57, and possibly in eco-
 nomic planning for  1956.     He
 personally reversed the party's
 cautious course on socializa-
 tion, was clearly the sponsor
 of  the "hundred flowers" policy,
 and may have insisted on more
 ambitious economic planning
 than his more conservative econ-
 omists advised.  These decisions
 contributed heavily to the seri-
 ous eCOriom1C and political prob-
 lem now confronting the regime.
 The Chinese Communist press
 has recently been quoting un-
 favorable remarks about Mao by

 "rightist" figures.  One non-
 communist is said to have de-
 scribed Mao as "impetuous" and
 "not thoughtful."  A long-time
 .Communist  party member  is
 quoted as advising Mao not to
 "assume-the air of a benevolent
 god," and as declaring that he
 had "begun to doubt that Chair-
 man Mao had made no mistakes."
 Although the aim in publishing
 such remarks-was presumably to
 emphasize .the. depratrity of tie
 rightists, many party members
 may regard these views as hav-
 ing some merit.  Moreover, these
 views may reflect some comments
 made at ar near the top of the
 party.
 There is a rumor current
 that Mao has expressed a wish
 to resign in the near future in
 order to work aut a design for
 the development of China over
 the next century,  Regarding
 himself as a philosopher and
 -poet, Mao, who will be 64 in
 December, may indeed desire a
 less demanding role in public
 life.      If  he actually has ex-
 pressed a wish to retire, party
 'leaders who want him to with-
 draw may encourage him to do so,
 an action-they would otherwise
 probably not. dare to take.  The
 party constitution adopted last
 fall-authorizes the party cenw
 tral committee to appoint "one
 honorary chairman"--clearly a.
 provision for Mao.
 However, the gravity of
 the regime's current problems
 makes it seem improbable that
 Mao will step down at this
 time.  Most of his lieutenants
 would probably calculate that
 his resignation during a ".time
 of  troubles''' would considerably
 increase those troubles.  The
 party membership and the popu-
 lace in general have long been
 encouraged to believe that only
 Mao's leadership could have
 brought the party through its
 problems to its triumphs of
 the past decade.  A declining
 emphasis on the need for Mao's
 personal leadership would be
 expected to precede his retire-
 ment.

 PATTERNS .AND PERSPECTIVES
 The Soviet stand at the
 London  disarmament talks this
 year has been characterized, as
 Secretary Dulles has said, by
 ''somewhat more realism and less
 bombast" than in the past.  The
 USSR has made a number of im-
 portant concessions in the talks,
 but the tactics of the Soviet
 negotiators and a number of
 statements by Khrushchev suggest
 that Moscow does not expect any
 disarmament agreement to be con-
 cluded in the near future and
 that many of its proposals and
 statements are designed mainly
 for immediate propaganda ad-
 vantage.
 During the Stalin era the
 Soviet leadership did not seem
 to appreciate the full implica-
 tions of the atomic age, but did
 recognize that as long as the
 -USSR lacked atomic weapons it
 was in an unequal bargaining
 position with the West, and it
 studiously avoided serious nego-
 tiations on disarmament.  The
 Soviet stand from 1945 until
 1954 was shrewdly conceived as
 propaganda to prevent the United
 States from using its atomic
 bombs as an instrument of the
 cold war.  Moscow consistently
 demanded the immddiate prohibi-
 tion and destruction of atomic
 weapons, offered only vague sug-
 gestions for control measures
 to enforce this,-and proposed
 a flat one-third cut in all
 armed forces without revealing
 the size of its own.
 Since 1954 the Soviet Un-
 ion apparently has felt close
 enough to atomic equality to
 enter the disarmament negotia-
 tions with proposals increasing-
 ly.-realistic and flexible.  The
 Soviet leaders also seem to
 realize the unprecedented devas-
 tation that would follow a nu-
 clear war,- and this has height-
 ened their interest, if not in
 a general disarmament agreement,
 then at least in measures to
 prevent the use of nuclear weap-
 ons in warfare.  Furthermore,
 the enormous and increasing cost
 of nuclear weapons and missiles
 has provided the USSR as well as
 the West with an incentive to
 put some- limits on the arms race.
 About one seventh of the
 Soviet economy's total output,
 measured in rubles, is devoted
 to military purposes.  While
 defense costs will continue to
 rise, the total economy probably.
 will grow at about the same rate,
 so these expenditures need not
 become an increasingly heavy
 burden.  Nevertheless, Khrut
 shchev's new commitments to
 higher living standards and his
 continued obsession with over-
 taking the United States in per
 capita production, plus the dif-
 faculties encountered in main-
 taining the growth of raw mate-
 rials industries in 1956-57,
 must impress on ..the Soviet lead-
 ers the desirability, although
 not-the necessity, of shifting
 resources from defense to other
 purposes.
 The increasing need for
 civilian labor can be met in
 part by reductions in military
 manpower; .cuts in this field do
 not greatly weaken the USSR's
 military position relative to
 the West and therefore can be
 undertaken unilaterally.  Uni-
 lateral reductions in military
 production,:, however, if they
 were big enough to help solve
 economic problems, could weaken
 the Soviet position.  Diversions
 of  pr?duction from defense  to
 the civilian economy, therefore,
 depend on an agreement with the
 West.
 The technical complexities
 of the nuclear age are a serious
 obstacle to a disarmament ac-

 The Soviet. leaders appear
 to believe that some of these
 goals can be achieved either
 without a disarmament agreement
 or with a limited agreement
 tailored to a considerable ex-

 views.  Which method Moscow uses

 The Soviet leaders probably

 be the  surest way to  gain a

 The Soviet Union is trying
 to strengthen its security and
 increase its influence outside
 the orbit by seeking the removal
 of American power and influence
 - from Europe, the liquidation of
 foreign bases from the Soviet
 periphery, and the inhibition
 of the American nuclear deterrent.
 Achievement of the last-named
 goal would lessen the danger
 that small wars and revolutions,
 possibly resulting from Soviet
 maneuvers, might expand into
 major nuclear wars.

 timed to increase support for
 -the Soviet nuclear test  ban
 proposal at the forthcoming UN
 General Assembly session.
 Aspects of Disarmament
 The disarmament negotia-
 tions in the UN subcommittee
 this year have involved five
 separate categories of issues--
 control of nuclear weapons,
 prevention of surprise attack,
 cutting; .conventional forces,
 eliminating troops and bases on
 foreign soil, and establishing
 political preconditions--each
 of which needs to be examined
 separately to show the reasons
 for the Soviet position and the
 changes in that position during
 the London talks.
 In sum,-the Soviet Union
 has been trying to impose polit-
 ical and moral limitations on
 ~Yestern use of nuclear weapons
 as a deterrent and-to eliminate
 or reduce Western  military..
 forces and bases in Europe and
 elsewhere on the Soviet periph-
 ery.  The- primary Western ob-
 jective of removing the dangers
 of surprise attack has been an-
 swered with reluctant conces-
 lions and a deep-seated disc
 trust of the control and inspec-
 tion measures which the West
 considers essential both for
 preventing surprise attack and
 for ending nuclear tests and
 future production of nuclear
 weapons..
 Nuclear Weapons:  The So-
 viet  n crest  n   sarmament is
 centered primarily on the ques-
 tion of nuclear weapons because
 they constitute the main deter-
 rent on which the United States
 relies.  Moscow's foreign policy
 is considerably inhibited'be,-
 cause of danger that through'
 miscalculation, small conf licts
 might be expanded into a nuclear
 Armageddon.  Through the years
 the Russians have proposed pro-
 hibitions on atomic weapons,
 and the West has suggested
 systems of inspection and con-
 trol.  Moscow has also shown
 some concern over the possibil-
 ity that other nations may de-
 velop atomic weapons, particular-
 ly a nation such as West Ger-
 many, thereby increasing the
 explosive risks of small wars.
 For many years Soviet dis-
 armament proposals centered on
 a demand for the prohibition and
 elimination of atomic weapons.
 Soviet responses to Western de-
 mands for control mechanisms
 were vague and feeble.  Grad-
 ually  both sides came to real-
 ize that it was impossible to
 detect secret stockpiles of nu-
 clear materials and weapons
 which had been accumulating in
 the United States, the United
 Kingdom, and the USSR; the USSR
 frankly admitted this in its
 proposals of 10 May 1955.  Al-
 though Moscow continues to de-
 scribe its long-range goal as
 the complete prohibition of nu-
 clear and thermonuclear .? weapons,
 with a cessation of their produc-
 tion and the destruction of
 stockpiles, its recent proposals
 for a partial agreement call
 only for a statement that the
 parties will seek to achieve
 this  in the _fL`t.ture.       Zorin has
 said privately that he realized
 the elimination of all nuclear
 weapons was impossible in a
 limited agreement.  This change
 in line ref lects a new realism
 in Soviet negotiations, a real-
 ization that it is counterpro-
 ductiveto demand an agreement
 that cannot be enforced.  It
 also ref lects the continuing
 fundamental Soviet hostility to
 those control and inspection
 measures which might be practical.
 One step the USSR has long
 proposed  as a means; of deal-
 ing with this problem is the
 signing of an unconditional
 pledge not to use atomic weap-
 ons.  Soviet officials have
 made it clear they have no illu-
 sions that such a pledge would
 prevent their use in an all-out
 war between the United States
 and the USSR, but. they believe

 it would be effective in pre-
 venting use of nuclear weapons
 in a limited war.  The USSR also
 expects it would destroy the
 confidence of  the  free world  in
 the military strength of the
 Western alliance systems.  In
 the current disarmament session,
 Moscow has been insisting on
 this pledge as one element in
 a partial agreement and has re-
 jected the Western counterpro-
 posal that such a ban exempt
 situations of individual or
 collective self-defense.
 Since February 1956 the
 USSR has emphasized the immedi-
 ate suspension of nuclear and
 thermonuclear tests independent
 of other aspects of the disarma-
 ment  question.  Moscow now
 proposes that it precede even
 a ,partial agreement in line with
 Khrushchev's assertion that it
 is the one question that can be
 solved even before mutual trust
 is established-among the great
 powers.
 The Soviet Union modified
 its earlier proposals for a com-
 plete ban with its 14 June 1957
 plan fora two- or three-year
 suspension of tests,. to be
 checked by control hosts in the
 .Soviet Union, Britain, '.the
 United States, and the Pacific.
 Ocean area.  The .USSR has ob-
 jected to linking a suspension
 with other issues, such as the
 ban on production of f issionable
 material for weapons purposes
 proposed by the West.  The
 Russians appear to be trying tv
 make the test issue the central
 one in the current negotiations
 in order to confront the West
 with a simple, clear-cut, popu-
 lar offer which it believes will
 be rejected, with a resulting
 world-wide. propaganda gain for
 Moscow.
 The l4 June Soviet proposal
 .was not put forward until~So-
 viet negotiators had ascertained
 the likelihood of Western re-
 jection.  The advantages to the
 USSR of concluding an agreement
 on   test  suspensi;on,  the
 prevention  of ..nuclear  weap-
 ons  development  by .,-other_
 nations, and the official recogni-
 tion of a distinction between
 nuclear and conventional weap-
 ons are offset by the present
 technical lag of the Soviet.
 Union behind the United States
 in nuclear weapons development.
 Therefore, while the Soviet Un-
 ion may eventually desire a ba.n
 on tests, its primary purpose
 in emphasizing this in the cur-
 rent negotiations is probably
 to gain propaganda advantage.
 The West has proposed, as
 part of a partial agreement and
 prerequisite to 'a test suspen-
 sion, an agreement:~for the
 cessation of nuclear weapons
 production and_.an inspection
 system to ensure that future
 production of fissionable ma-
 terials would go exclusively
 for nonweapons purposes.  It has
 also proposed'that subsequently
 agreed and roughly equal amounts
 of fissionable materials be
 transferred by the United States
 and the USSR (and smaller amounts
 by Britain) from existing weap-
 ons to an internationally super -
 vised.stockple for nonweapons
 purposes.  The Soviet Union
 has apposed these plans, with  .
 Zorin stating privately that a
 ban on production must be tied
 to an unconditional pledge to
 ban use and to seek complete
 prohibition-and elimination.
 The Soviet coolness to
 that form of  control which the
 West believes is possible to
 enforce--the ban ~on future pro-
 duction of nuclear materials
 for weapons--is a symptom of
 the long-standing Soviet hostil-
 ity?  to control. recently ~ex-
 pressed by Khrushchev,  Speaking
 on 13 June in Finland, he said
 that controls will not prevent
 a state from preparing for ag-
 gression.  "To advocate control
 is one thing, but to admit
 foreign controllers to one's
 factories and plants and air-
 fields and arsenals is another."

 29 August 1957
 inspection procedures to check
 on existing atomic-weapon stock-
 piles has led the West to put
 increasing emphasis on measures
 to prevent surprise attack.
 The Western theory is that sur-
 prise is essential for the suc-
 cess of aggression today, that
 effective inspection procedures
 can largely remove the surprise-
 element,  ~,nd that  if  this were
 done both sides could take the
 risks of major reductions in~
 their defense establish menu.
 'The West is mare concerned
 than the USSR about the danger
 of a surprise attack and the
 West has a greater interest in
 sending inspectors into the
 large forbidden areas of the
 USSR.  The West has taken most
 of the initiative for adopting
 measures against surprise at-
 tack, and the Soviet counter-
 proposals have been offered to
 demonstrate Moscow's willing-
 ness to negotiate., There re-
 mains considerable doubt that
 the U5SR would be willing to
 make the radical changes in its
 closed society that its own
 inspection proposals would re-
 quire.  It has put a, greater-
 emphasis on ground inspection,.
 .while the West has stressed
 aerial inspection.
 The USSR::took the lead in
 its 10 May 1955 plan in pro-
 posing the establishment of
 control posts at large ports
 rail junctions, major highways,
 and airf fields to prevent sur-
 prise attack by reporting on
 military concentrations.  On
 its latest pr4~osal for :a par-
 tial agreement., the establish-.
 went of control posts at airs
 fields is postponed until the
 later stages.
 The inspection area would
 include Europe, .the eastern
 border of the United States,
 and the western fringe of the
 USSR, and could include areas
 covered by aerial inspection.
 The principal difference in
 Western-ground inspection plans
 is the inclusion of airf fields
 in the early stagesiand the
 additional use of mobile in-
 spection teams.
 The more controversial is-
 sue is the aerial inspection
 proposed by President'Eisen-
 howe.r at the summit conference
 in July;, 1955 and emphasized by
 the Western powers since then.
 The Soviet leaders immediately
 reacted coldly to the proposal
 publicly and privately, making
 it clear ?that  they felt it was
 designed for espionage purposes
 and would contribute nothing
 to a disarmament solution.
 '    When the USSR offered its
 first  specific  plan for aerial
 inspection in November 1956, it
 emphasized that it still con-
 sidered the step unnecessary..
 but was offering a plan to meet
 Western insistence.  Khrushchev
 said on 13 June of this year,
 "We have stated from the very
 beginning that those 'open skies'
 offer nothing, and that this
 proposal (President Eisenhower's)
 can only increase the suspicions
 felt by one power toward another."
 This attitude lends an air of
 unreality and insincerity to
 the specific aerial. inspection
 schemes offered by the USSR..
 The USSR seems primarily
 interested in a European zone,
 while the West, concerned about
 the political problems in Europe,
 wants to make a zone there con-
 ditional on acceptance of one
 of its other two proposed zones.
 One of these encompasses all of
 the USSR, the United States,
 .Canada, and Alaska; the other is
 limited to the Arctic, Alaska,
 and Kamchatka.  Outside of
 Europe the Soviet Union has pro-
 posed a zone including the
 eastern part of the USSR and
 the western United States, areas
 of roughly equal size but un-
 equal in industrial and strate-
 gic importance,

 (a monopoly.. of    the West  with
 plans for reductions in man,
 power (in which the USSR was
 .predominant), starting with: the
 provision of accurate informa-
 tion about the size of all
 forces .  The USSR ?red unreal-
 istic and. unverifiable ,proposals
 for an all-round one-third cut
 in forces.  In May 1955, the USSR
 accepted a British-French pro-
 posal to set the maximum force
 level of the United States, the
 USSR, and China at 1,500,.000
 each and of  Bri'tfi.in and France
 at 650,?00 eacb, with the reduc-
 tions to be accomplished by
 stages phased into steps toward
 nuclear disarmament.
 In the present circum-
 stances  the .Soviet Union believes
 that such extensive cuts would
 greatly weaken the overseas
 commitments of the Western pow-
 ers, particularly the United
 States,  The USSR has already
 announced cuts of 1,840.,000 in
 its: military forces since Au-
 gust 1955, and has carried out
 at least some of them, and it
 may contemplate further cuts in
 the future as newer weapons
 create budgetary problems.
 Thereforer the So~tiet Uhian
 would like the Western powers
 to sign an agreement committing
 them to make equivalent cuts.
 In the current negotiations
 the USSR has accepted a Western
 compromise 1'or a reduction of
 forces to  2, 500.,000 each for  tlae
 United States and.-the USSR and
 750,000 each for Britain and
 France in the first stage, with
 cuts of the great powers to 2,-
 180,000 and 1,fiOO,OOO and pro-
 portionate British and French
 cuts in the second and third
 stages.  However, the West has
 made  these- further cuts cond3,-
 tional on progress in the imple-
 mentation of  he wholedisarma-
 ment agreement and on progress
 in-the settlement of political
 issues.  Zori~i only recently
 emphasized that the partial
 agreement must  includ"e firm az~d
 unconditional grovisions for
 these further cuts.
 Tl~e  tJS-3R had proposed .that
 these manpower reductions be
 accompanied by a 15-percent cut
 in arma~ents and budgets, while
 the West graposed 10 percent.
 During the current negotiations
 the USSR has stated that it has
 no objection in principle to an
 alternative Western plan far an
 exchange of lists of the arma-
 ments to be reduced. and their
 deposit in an internationally
 supervised stockpile, but the
 details of-such a scheme have
 still not been worked out.
 Troops and-Bases on Foreign
 'Soil:  A ma or aim o~ oviet
 policy is to gain the removal
 o American forces from Europe
 and other areas peripheral to
 the USSR.  As part of  the  disarma-
 ment: negotiations,the USSR has
 .sought to achieve this by pro-
 posing not only sharp reduc-
 tiions in total troop;: strength
 but also a cut in forces in
 Germany and all of Europe and
 an elimination of foreign bases.
 The West has never accepted the
 European force cuts and base
 liquidation as a legitimate par t
 of a disarmament agreement..
 The USSR has made a number
 of these proposals in the past,
 each with several variations,
 designed as part of a European
 security plan, a disarmament
 package., or as steps that could
 be taken independently "to
 lessen international tension."
 Khrushchev has several times
 talked vaguely about the with-
 drawal of all foreign troops
 and bases, .particularly from
 Europe.  This area illustrates
 very well the Soviet technique
 of seeking the same objectives
 :both within and outsf de the
 disarmament negotiations.

 the total military forces of the
 four powers stationed on the
 territories of member states of
 NATO and the Warsaw pact be re-

 atomic weapons on foreign soil,
 and particularly in Germany, be

 it clear that the USSR still in-

 included in a partial agreement.
 Political Preconditions:
 The West has emphas ze  t at
 no comprehensive disarmament
 agreement is possible without
 political settlements, and as-
 serted in the Berlin declara-
 tion of 29 July that this must
 include German unification.
 In the current negotiations on
 a partial agreement it has in-
 sisted on progress toward polit-
 ical settlements before the
 second and third stages of mili-
 tary force reductions.
 Although Zorin said private-
 ly in April that a partial agree-
 ment including the reduction of
 troops and bases abroad would
 ease international tension and
 be followed by negotiations on
 political issues,  he has re-

 and perhaps political, upheaval

 standard of the Iraqi .peasant

 displaced Arabs themselves, for
 -the most part, are adamant in
 refusing to consider any solu-
 tion to the problem other than
 repatriation.  They consider
 "resettlement" virtually a for-
 bidden word.  As a result, the
 $200,000,000 resettlement fund
 of the UN Relief and Works
 Agency (UNRWA) remains largely
 unspent, although UNRWA's man-
 date expires in 1960 with scant
 possibility of renewal.  This
 fact may in time prove the most
 effective stimulus to new plans,
 since the alternative is for
 the refugees to become charges
 of the host governments.

 in use.. The vast majority of
 the 'refugees do not benefit
 from UNRWA facilities but live
 in squalor outside the camps.
 Some still dwell in caves in
 the hills of Palestine.
 UNRWA provides food, educa-
 tion, and medical care to ap-
 proximately 845,000.  Various
 voluntary agencies, both reli-
 gious and secular, contribute
 additional services, mostly
 supplementing those provided
 by the UN agency.  Assistance
 toward self-support is also
 part  of  the UN relief  program.
 However, work opportunities
 are especially scarce in Jordan
 and the Gaza. strip, where most
 of the refugees live, and most
 of the available opportunities
 are skilled fobs for which the
 majority are unsuited.
 Although unemployed and
 living in generally deplorable
 conditions, the average refugee
 is provided with-care and serv-
 ices which In some cases are
 better than those available to
 .many nonrefugee Arabs,  In spite
 of this, refugees consider the
 relief services insufficientt
 They regard the UN as largely
 responsible for their plight
 and the relief measures as a
 debt owed them by the world at
 large.
 Politics and Leadership
 From the refugee point of
 view, the problem demands a
 political rather than an econom-
 ic solution.  Hence,-the refu-
 gees have rejected all measures
 for resettlement :~aad ~~~have
 exerted constant pros-sure on
 .the host governments toward
 achieving the-goal of'repatria-
 tion.
 On an East-West scale the
 refugees,  far from being neu-
 tralist, are almost completely
 -anti-Western.  Their antipathy
 stems from a belief  t;~at  the
 West "created" the  archenemy
 Israel which now occupies their
 former homelands.  Such senti-
 ment  in .Jordan,  where refugees
 constitute over one-third of
 the electorate, kept. that state
 from ,joining the Baghdad pact
 in 1955.     Before King .Hussain
 consolidated control last spring,
 refugee influence was  the mayor
 factor intimidating pro-Western
 voices and encouraging Jordan's
 politicians to follow the Egyp-
 tian and Syrian lead toward
 closer relations with the Soviet
 bloc .
 The frustration of  the dis-
 placed Arabs makes them highly
 susceptible to exploitation by
 extremist politicians both in-
 side and outside their ranks.
 Indeed, an extremist position
 has almost been a requirement
 for achieving leadership among
 the group.  There are known to
 be some moderates, possibly even
 a considerable number, but
 their views, if expressed at
 all, have so far had little
 chance of  being heard.
 With leadership in the
 hands  of  extremists,  no  offec-
 tive organization has developed
 and no individual leader appears
 to be o~ more than local si,gnif-
 iCanc~:  Some refugee land-
 owners have organized, and other
 groups of limited scope exist.
 The dispersion of refugees among
 58 camps.in four countries vir-
 tually precludes a centralized
 refugee organization.  Even
 within the states, refugee
 opinion apparently is exerted
 most effectively beyond the
 confines  of  the camps  through
 nonrefugee politicians.
 Both Egyptian and Communist
 influence on the refugees is
 strong.  Many  of Egypt's
 fedayeen commandos have been
 recruited from the camps in
 Gaza and Jordan, where Nasr is
 a hero. .Jordanian elections in
 October 1956 revealed a definite
 pro-Egyptian bias on the part of
 educated Palestinian Arabs.

 These in turn are leaders of
 the workers and peasant farmers,
 the f ellahin.
 Communism has made most
 headway among the young.  Raised
 in a  camp atmosphex^e  free from
 effective parental control and
 the inhibitions of a stable
 village social structure, the
 young people are ready prey
 for leftist indoctrination.  A
 group of Communist teachers has
 operated within- the-camp school
 system in Jordan .  Student
 strikes there are believed to
 have been Communist inspired.
 Mohammedanism reportedly
 has assumed a radical colora-
 tion among refugees.  pne ob-
 server believes that-Islam is
 returning progressively to the
 fanaticism which characterized
 it in medieval times.
 Present Government Attitudes
 "Justice"  for  the refugees
 remains a potent  shibboleth
 around which to rally Arab
 unity.      In  the face of  recent
 Egyptian charges that the Jor-
 danian and Iraqi governments
 were "betraging" the refugees
 by allegedly negotiating with
 Isr~.el, the accused governments
 found it necessary to reaffirm
 their opposition to anything
 but repatriation for the dis-
 placed Arabs.- Yet,--while of -
 ficial Arab attitudes toward
 the problem are. publicly uni-
 form, deviations occasionally
 have been indicated,- Iraq
 considered a suitable area for
 refugee absorption, at times
 has seemed inhibited only by
 Arab League injunctions against
 refugee emigration.  Privately,
 the Iraqi attitude-has been
 one of willingness to accept
 those refugees who might come
 to Iraq but to resist any
 forced or imposed resettlement.
 In Lebanon, any possible
 integration of refugees is com-
 plicated by the delicate bal-
 ante between Moslems and Arab
 Christians there.  In 1955,
 the Lebanese foreign minister
 indicated a readiness, within
 the framework of a peace settle-
 ment, to accept all of the
 16,500 Christian refugees in
 Lebanon and a proportionately
 smaller number of Moslems,  No
 Lebanese politician would be
 willing to espouse this view
 openly under present conditions.
 On 19 July, a Syrian of -
 ficial, summarizing his country's
 attitude toward the general
 problem of Palestine, told an
 American representative that
 settlement of the Arab refugee
 problem is dependent on adoption
 and enforcement  of  a policy of
 preventing further Jewish im-
 migration into Israel.  If
 such immigration is halted, he
 asserted, Israel will not need
 to expand to take care of the
 large future population on
 which it counts.- The question
 of the Arab then allegedly
 could be settled by the Near
 Eastern countries themselves.
 These remarks are noteworthy
 .because of .the acknowledgment
 of  a solution short of  total
 repatriation.
 Israel itself has revealed
 an altered attitude toward the
 refugees.  The Israeli minister
 to 'Washington advised the US
 State Department on 25 May that
 Israel's policy was changing in
 two significant respects: -the
 Israelis no longer feel it is
 .essential to bring about a set-
 tlement through the UN, and they
 no longer insist that the refu-
 gee problem has to be resolved
 as part of an over-all.-peace
 settlement.  However, Israel
 still does not show any willing-
 ness to undert~.ke serious com-
 mitments in resolving the prob-.
 lem, and there is some question
 as to how far any Israeli cabi-
 net could go in  the  event
 serious   ro osals   ld
 arise.
