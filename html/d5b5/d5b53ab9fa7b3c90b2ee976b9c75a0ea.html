PREFACE 
This study is based on official records of the 
Department of State. Most of these records remain classified 
at this time. Published memoirs and selected personal 
interviews provided supplementary information. Information 
from Presidential records was not available at the time of 
preparation of this study and is not reflected in it. 
The participants listed for each summit meeting include 
all U.S. and Soviet delegation members named in the final 
meeting communique together with additional selected names 
of delegation staff members derived from official records. 
A previous study by this Office deals with U.S.-Soviet 
summit meetings between 1955 and 1967. 
The study was prepared by official Department historians 
Nina J. Noring, David W. Mabon, Ronald D. Landa, Harriet D. 
Schwar, Nina D. Howland, James E. Miller, and David S. 
Patterson. It was reviewed by Ms. Noring under the overall 
direction of Paul Claussen, Chief of the Policy Studies 
Division.

UNITED STATES-SOVIET SUMMITS, 1972-1979: 
AN OVERVIEW 
Between 1972 and 1979, United States and Soviet leaders 
held six summit meetings. President Nixon's three summits with 
Soviet General Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev (Moscow, May 22-30, 
1972; Washington, June 18-25, 1973; and Moscow, June 28-July 3, 
1974) were of longer duration than the others and included 
extensive side trips, photo opportunities, and ceremonial 
aspects. A programmed informality characterized these 
meetings, with occasions for the two leaders to socialize in a 
relaxed setting. 
President Ford's two summits with Brezhnev (Vladivostok, 
November 23-24, 1974; and Helsinki, July 30 and August 2, 1975) 
were arranged in response to specific circumstances--Ford's 
assumption of the presidency and the signing of the Helsinki 
Accords. Hence, they were shorter, less ceremonial, involved 
less socializing, and dealt with fewer issues than the previous 
three summits. 
President Carter's summit with Brezhnev (Vienna, June 
15-18, 1979) was more formal in tone than the other summits. 
There were opportunities for informal conversation between the 
two leaders at the introductory session, short luncheons and 
dinners, and an evening at the opera, but none in a casual 
setting. Most business was conducted in plenary session; 
Carter and Brezhnev met privately only once. The discussions 
were substantively wide-ranging, but Brezhnev's failing health 
limited the length of the sessions. 
In all cases, U.S. officials anticipated constructive but 
limited achievements from the summits. Conscious efforts were 
made to insure there would be positive results from the 
meetings that would enhance the President's image as a world 
leader and build support for his policies. Extensive 
U.S.-Soviet negotiations preceded all six meetings, not only to 
set the agenda and negotiate a joint communique, but also to 
narrow and reconcile differences on substantive issues so that 
specific agreements could be announced at the summit. 
Arms control was the dominant issue discussed at all the 
summits. Summit consideration supplemented and crystallized 
rather than replaced ongoing negotiations on this issue. Two 
SALT treaties and several other agreements and joint statements 
relating to arms control were completed at the meetings. A 
limited number of negotiating deadlocks on arms control were

resolved at the summits. At the 1972 meeting, differences were 
resolved on several subsidiary issues; in June 1974 a threshold 
test ban treaty was concluded; and in November 1974 important 
Soviet concessions were obtained regarding SALT. 
Geopolitical issues, particularly the Middle East, were 
also a central concern at the summits. Discussions served 
mainly to restate existing positions rather than break new 
ground. The Soviet Union raised the subject of the People's 
Republic of China at all of the meetings. This reflected 
Soviet concern over China's nuclear capability and over the 
resumption of Sino-American relations. 
Summit discussions also focused on trade, cultural and 
scientific exchange, and other bilateral interests. Numerous 
agreements on these subjects were signed at the three summits 
held during the Nixon administration. Certain bilateral 
questions were raised at the Ford and Carter administration 
summits, but less emphasis was placed on them and no agreements 
were signed. 
NIXON AND BREZHNEV AT MOSCOW, MAY 22-30, 1972 
In 1970 the United States took initiatives which after 
substantial negotiations eventuated two years later in the 
first Moscow Summit of May 1972. Both countries had high 
expectations for this summit and these were largely fulfilled, 
at least in the short run. 
The two principal achievements of the summit were the 
establishment of a personal relationship between President 
Richard Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev 
and the signature of the ABM Treaty and the Interim Agreement 
on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (SALT I). Some 
last-minute negotiation on these agreements took place at the 
summit. Also signed in Moscow were prenegotiated agreements on 
the Basic Principles of U.S.-Soviet Relations, Prevention of 
Incidents at Sea, Cooperation in Space, Medical Science and 
Public Health, Environmental Protection, and Science and 
Technology. Of these, the Agreement on Basic Principles was of 
great importance to the Soviets, who saw it as a U.S. 
recognition of their full equality as a superpower. 
Discussions at the summit also affected significant 
developments in Europe and the Middle East, trade expansion, 
and a lend-lease settlement. In subsequent years some of the 
roughnesses in the negotiating process before, during, and

after this summit, particularly as they affected the SALT I 
agreements and the international grain trade, provided an 
opening for opponents of detente to criticize its viability. 
NIXON AND BREZHNEV AT WASHINGTON, 
CAMP DAVID, AND SAN CLEMENTE, 
JUNE 18-25, 1973 
The Brezhnev visit to the United States (June 18-25), 
undertaken more at Soviet initiative than American, took place 
amidst much fanfare but under the cloud of the Watergate 
hearings. Preparations were conducted primarily by a special 
interagency committee under the National Security Council's 
Senior Review Group, although some details were smoothed out by 
National Security Adviser Henry A. Kissinger during a May visit 
to the Soviet Union. Like Khrushchev's visit in 1959, 
Brezhnev's was marked by public demonstrations, mainly by 
Jewish groups critical of restrictive Soviet emigration 
policies. During the visit ten agreements were signed, the 
most important of which was an understanding on the prevention 
of nuclear war. In several private talks with Nixon at Camp 
David and San Clemente, Brezhnev also emphasized his anxiety 
over improving U.S.-Chinese ties, and he tried unsuccessfully 
to draw Nixon and Kissinger into an implied alliance against 
the Chinese. In their final meeting at San Clemente, Brezhnev 
also tried to bully Nixon into a secret deal to end the Middle 
Eastern conflict. 
FORD AND BREZHNEV AT VLADIVOSTOK, NOVEMBER 23-24, 1974 
The Vladivostok meeting between President Gerald R. Ford 
and Soviet leader Brezhnev took place only five months after 
the Moscow summit, primarily because Brezhnev was eager to 
establish contact with the new U.S. President. The summit was 
more ad hoc than the three previous ones and focused almost 
entiii-ri-OT the strategic arms limitations talks (SALT). The 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), 
Cyprus, and the Middle East were dealt with briefly but nothing 
of substance was achieved on any of these issues. Mutual and 
balanced force reduction (MBFR) was mentioned only in the 
prenegotiated joint communiqu?In part because of the 
groundwork laid by Secretary of State Kissinger during his 
October trip to Moscow and to Soviet hopes of establishing a 
constructive relationship with the new U.S. President, a 
breakthrough on SALT did take place at Vladivostok. The two

sides reached agreement in principle and the resulting SALT 
accord provided the basis for the SALT It treaty later signed 
by Preeident Jimmy Carter and Brezhnev in Vienna in June 1979. 
It met the demands of the U.S. Congress and the Defense 
Department for equal aggregates and involved significant Soviet 
concessions, including abandonment of their previous demand 
that Forward Based Systems (FBS), such as U.S. weapons based in 
Western Europe, had to be included in the U.S. total. Ford and 
Kissinger returned home feeling triumphant and claiming that 
they had put a cap on the arms race. Their hopes were dashed, 
however, by the subsequent inability of the two sides to agree 
upon whether such weapons as the Soviet Backfire bomber and 
U.S. cruise missiles were to be included in the totals agreed 
upon at Vladivostok. 
' FORD AND BREZHNEV AT HELSINKI, JULY 30-AUGUST 2, 1975 
The 1975 Helsinki summit between President Ford and Soviet 
General Secretary Brezhnev took place on July 30 and August 2, 
1975, immediately prior to and following the ceremonies closing 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
The United States gave top priority to two issues: 
-- Strengthening cooperation between the great powers 
-- Concluding a SALT II agreement 
The results of the Ford-Brezhnev meeting were 
unsatisfactory. No substantive progress was made on SALT 
although the atmosphere which surrounded meetings of the two 
leaders was frank and cooperative. Public reaction to the 
meeting was strongly negative and contributed to the subsequent 
deterioration in U.S.-Soviet relations during the remainder of 
the Ford administration and weakened the President's political 
position. 
CARTER AND BREZHNEV AT VIENNA, JUNE 15-18, 1979 
The only U.S.-Soviet summit conference held during the 
Carter administration opened in Vienna on June 15, 1979, and 
continued through June 18, with five plenary meetings as well 
as a private meeting between President Carter and Soviet 
General Secretary Brezhnev. Discussions focused on the 
following subjects:

3.. International issues 
4. Bilateral and trade issues. 
The major achievement at Vienna was the signing of the SALT 
II Treaty on strategic arms. Other issues were discussed and 
positions clarified, but little movement toward specific 
agreements resulted. Subsequently, the Soviet Union reacted 
negatively to the NATO two-track decision in mid-December 1979 
to deploy intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Western 
Europe while simultaneously pursuing arms control talks with 
the Soviet Union. The invasion of Afghanistan by Soviet armed 
forces later that month removed all hopes for progress toward a 
rapprochement in U.S.-Soviet relations. President Carter asked 
the Senate to delay further consideration of the SALT II Treaty 
from further Senate consideration; it has still not been 
ratified.

NIXON AND BREZHNEV AT MOSCOW, MAY 22-30, 1972 
In 1970 the United States took initiatives which after 
substantial negotiations eventuated two years later in the first 
Moscow Summit of May 1972. Both countries had high expectations 
for the summit and these were largely fulfilled, at least for the 
short run. 
The two principal achievements of the summit were the 
establishment of a personal relationship between President Richard 
Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev and the 
signature of the ABM Treaty and the Interim Agreement on the 
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (SALT I). Some last-minute 
negotiation on these agreements took place at the summit. Also 
signed in Moscow were prenegotiated agreements on the Basic 
Principles of U.S.-Soviet Relations, Prevention of Incidents at 
Sea, Cooperation in Space, Medical Science and Public Health, 
Environmental Protection, and Science and Technology. Of these, 
the Agreement on Basic Principles was of great importance to the 
Soviets, who saw it as a U.S. recognition of their full equality 
as a superpower. 
Discussions at the summit also affected significant 
developments in Europe and the Middle East, trade expansion, and a 
lend-lease settlement. In subsequent years some of the 
roughnesses in the negotiating process before, during, and after 
this summit, particularly as they affected the SALT I agreements 
and the international grain trade, gave an opening for opponents 
of detente to criticize its viability. 
Initiative: U.S. Pressure in a Context of Linkage and Increasing  
Soviet Receptivity  
President Richard Nixon's approach to summit meetings was a 
blend of two strategies which were in partial conflict. On the 
one hand he wanted summits to be substantive meetings which would 
be held only after careful advance preparation and would mark the 
conclusion of significant agreements of major benefit to the 
United States; for this reason he resisited both Soviet and 
domestic suggestions that he open, his presidency with a summit. 
On the other hand, he felt the need to manipulate the prestige and 
results of summit meetings to his domestic political advantage, a 
consideration which influenced the timing of his summit 
initiatives.

At President Nixon's first meeting with Soviet Ambassador 
Anatoly Dobrynin on February 17, 1969, the Ambassador hinted at 
the possibility of a summit meeting. The President replied by 
stressing that a summit should be linked to progress on such 
issues as the Middle East, Vietnam, and arms talks. Nixon thus 
put forth at the outset the first of his strategies. The procedure 
which he enunciated to Dobrynin was followed faithfully during the 
first year of his presidency. A summit would take place only when 
enough substantive ground had been broken, and enough concrete 
progress had been made so that the meeting when held would be 
assured of success in advance. There was little progress toward 
detente during 1969, and so when Dobrynin mentioned a summit to 
Kissinger in January 1970, the latter by his own account "threw 
cold water on the idea."1 
In April 1970, Nixon introduced for the first time the 
second consideration in his approach to summits. The invasion of 
Cambodia by U.S. and South Vietnamese forces which Nixon ordered 
that month brought about a sharp drop in his domestic popularity 
and in his prestige worldwide. According to Kissinger, Nixon was 
"tormented by antiwar agitators" and "thought he could paralyze 
them by a dramatic peace move."2 
By this time Nixon had already established the practice of 
placing discussion of the most important issues between the United 
States and the Soviet Union in the Kissinger-Dobrynin "special 
channel," bypassing the entire Department of State. Accordingly, 
it was Kissinger, not Secretary of State William P. Rogers, who 
probed Dobrynin about Soviet willingness to go to the summit. 
Over the spring and summer of 1970 Dobrynin stalled, raising 
various issues--the Middle East, SALT, Southeast Asia, and a 
conference on European security--progress on which Kissinger 
regarded as Soviet "prices" for a summit. Kissinger later wrote 
that "they were playing our game of 1969" and that "only the 
eternal Soviet eagerness to squeeze one-sided gains from a 
negotiation saved us" from the "serious difficulties" which he 
believed would have resulted from a premature summit. The Soviets 
set such high "prices" that Nixon was not tempted. In June 1970, 
the Soviets informally proposed, via the SALT delegation then in 
Vienna, an agreement ostensibly aimed at preventing accidental 
wars which would in actuality have been directed against China. 
Nixon promptly rejected this overture.3 
From 1970 on, Nixon's interest in an eventual summit did not 
waver, but rather intensified as the election year of 1972 
approached. During 1971 a breakthrough in the SALT negotiations 
and Nixon's opening to China cleared the way for an agreement 
reached in August to hold a summit in Moscow in late May of 1972.

In January 1971, Kissinger proposed to Nixon that 
substantive talks on two important issues should be put into the 
Kissinger-Dobrynin channel. One was the question of a new 
agreement on Western access rights to West Berlin, on which formal 
Four-Power negotiations had been underway for some time. The 
other was SALT, for which formal bilateral talks alternated 
between Helsinki and Vienna. Both negotiations would now, 
therefore, be in dual channels. Kissinger wrote later: "And I 
proposed linking the Berlin negotiations to.progress in SALT; 
SALT, in turn, we would make depend on Soviet willingness to 
freeze its offensive buildup. Nixon approved."4 
The back-channel SALT negotiation lasted for 4 months. The 
pace of the talks quickened after Dobrynin returned in April from 
the'24th Congess of the Soviet Communist Party, at which Brezhnev 
launched an active policy of seeking detente. On May 20, the two 
countries announced an understanding that an Anti-Ballistic 
Missile (ABM) Treaty and an agreement on the limitation of 
offensive strategic missiles would be concluded simultaneously. 
Hitherto the Soviets had wished an ABM Treaty to be concluded 
first. The Administration, reflecting the views of the Department 
of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), considered the new 
arrangement to represent considerable Soviet concession, although 
the chief SALT negotiator, Gerard C. Smith, believed prior 
negotiation of an ABM Treaty would confer certain advantages. For 
reasons which are unclear, Kissinger chose not to stress in the 
talks leading up to the understanding the inclusion of 
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in the contemplated 
arrangement on offensive weapons, an omission which later 
necessitated considerable additional negotiation.5 
After conclusion of the May 20 agreement, Kissinger pressed 
Dobrynin harder on a summit, telling him on June 8 that "we had 
now been talking about a Summit for 14 months." He demanded an 
answer by the end of the month. Dobrynin tried, as he had 
previously that spring, to link the summit to progress on Berlin, 
but agreed to get instructions.6 Kissinger was not as desperate 
as he had intentionally sounded. Unknown to the Soviets, he was 
already planning to leave July 1 on a trip which would include a 
secret visit to China to plan a summit which had been agreed upon 
in May. 
Regardless of the Soviet answer to Kissinger's plea, there 
could be no more discussions in the channel until his return. 
While in Peking, however, the Chinese agreed the summit would be 
held in February 1972. This sequence of developments enabled 
Nixon and Kissinger to maintain correctly that they had been 
negotiating in good faith toward a Soviet summit, and not 
rejecting Moscow while wooing Peking. They could still hold 
summits in the order they preferred: Peking first, Moscow second.

Nixon publicly revealed Kissinger's trip in San Clemente, 
where the two consulted before Kissinger's return to Washington. 
With more cards in his hand, Kissinger told Dobrynin that "we 
believe we have made an unending series of overtures. The Soviet 
response has been grudging and petty, especially on the Summit 
Meeting....Dobrynin in reply was almost beside himself with 
protestations of goodwill."' 
Kissinger obviously believed his trip had had the desired 
effect. He urged Nixon to open personal communication with 
Brezhnev, but not mention a summit; Nixon followed this plan in a 
letter to Brezhnev of August 6. Brezhnev's reply invited Nixon to 
Moscow in the spring of 1972. Later in August Kissinger and 
Dobrynin set the arrival for May 22. The public announcement was 
released on October 12, during a visit of Soviet Foreign Minister 
Andrei Gromyko. Since Rogers was not apprised of the secret, 
Nixon and Kissinger pretended to him that the invitation had been 
formally extended by Gromyko during his October visit.8 
Kissinger was well satisfied with the result, writing later 
that it would have been unfortunate if the Soviets had agreed to 
an earlier date as the United States would not have been 
well-prepared.9 
Arkady N. Shevchenko, a high-level Soviet defector who 
worked on the Soviet Foreign Office team set up to prepare for the 
summit, has written that by 1971-1972 the Soviet Union wanted the 
summit at least as much as the United States, partly because of 
the U.S. opening to China but also because a new generation of 
Soviet military leaders understood that SALT treaties could reduce 
the level of expenditure for strategic armaments and give the 
Soviet Union a "breathing space" in which it would work to narrow 
the technological gap. Helmut Sonnenfeldt, who participated in 
the summit as an NSC staffer, notes that Soviet arms expenditures 
never leveled off, but agrees with Shevchenko (and Kissinger) that 
the China initiative was of supreme importance in hastening the 
summit. 10 
Preparations: Dual-Channel Negotiations, a Secret Visit, and the  
Mining of Haiphong Harbor. 
Both the United States and the Soviet Union spent many 
months in preparation for the summit, and many agreements on major 
and minor matters alike were worked out in advance. Nonetheless, 
the North Vietnamese offensive of March 1972, and the nature of 
the U.S. response, made the outcome doubtful until days before the 
summit took place.

In January Brezhnev, in a letter to Nixon, outlined items 
for discussion at the summit. They included the proposed 
Conference on European Security and Cooperation (CSCE), the 
situations in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the SALT 
negotiations. Brezhnev called for "positive decisions" on 
bilateral trade and economic relations at the summit and proposed 
prenegotiation of several minor agreements for signature during 
the meeting. In presenting the letter to Kissinger on January 21, 
Dobrynin added that the Kremlin was "eager" for trade and SALT 
agreements to be signed at the summit. Kissinger ducked on the 
specific question of a trade agreement, but said "we would do our 
best" to meet the target on SALT.11 
Secretary of State Rogers tried to take personal charge of 
summit preparations but Nixon ruled otherwise on March 17 when he 
pointedly told Dobrynin that Kissinger was in complete charge of 
the summit and would parcel out assignments on the lesser items to 
individuals within the bureaucracy. The Agreement on the 
Prevention of Incidents at Sea was worked out almost exclusively 
by U.S. and Soviet naval officials; the other minor agreements 
were negotiated on the U.S. side by the appropriate agencies, but 
with Department of State participation. State also prepared 
extensive briefing materials on all topics. Yet, as Nixon had 
already explained in a letter to Brezhnev, big issues such as the 
Middle East, Vietnam, SALT, and the drafting of the communique 
would remain in the Kissinger-Dobrynin channe1.12 
Of all these issues, SALT was the centerpiece so far as the 
summit was concerned. While front channel SALT negotiations 
continued in Vienna and Helsinki, Kissinger and Dobrynin, unknown 
to at least the U.S. SALT delegation, discussed three issues in 
the winter and spring of 1972: the number and type of ABM sites 
each side should have, the duration of the freeze on offensive 
weapons, and the potential inclusion of SLBMs in the freeze. 
Their talks on the first item were inconclusive. On the second, 
the United States wanted a duration of 5 years. Kissinger 
succeeded by late March in getting the Soviets to move from 
18 months to 3 years. With regard to SLBMs, he started with a 
suggestion that each side be allowed 41 missile submarines, that 
being the current U.S. total, which was within the estimated range 
of Soviet boats. New boats could replace old ones.13 (The U.S. 
total was not scheduled to rise anyway, since the Navy was 
advocating a program of qualititative, not quantitative, 
improvements in SLBMs.) 
In February Kissinger agreed to "gear the conversations [on 
SALT] to an agreement at the summit." Dobrynin, according to 
Kissinger's memorandum of the meeting, wanted to know why a 
submarine missile freeze "would not simply be a device for 
stopping an ongoing Soviet program while giving the United States

the opportunity to tool up for a new [Trident] submarine 
progriim....He thought our program was neatly timed to start right 
after the expiration date." Shortly thereafter Kissinger started 
to show flexibility, and in mid-March he raised the possibility of 
allowing the Soviets more boats if they traded in old land 
missiles (ICBMs) for SLBMs. Under these circumstances, he 
offered, "it might go as high as the middle 50s as against our 
41." At that point, according to Kissinger: 
"Dobrynin said he could not understand our 
eagerness to get an agreement which was so 
unequal. How would we justify a Soviet 
preponderance in this to our public? I said we 
would have to explain it on the ground that the 
Soviets could keep a smaller number deployed at 
any given number of submarines. Dobrynin said, 
'There must be some angle. What is it?' I said 
there was no angle 4 but there was serious concern 
about submarines."14 
The Department of Defense knew about the idea of land for 
sea missiles, for Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird had endorsed 
it. There is no evidence, however, that the proposal of unequal 
numbers was shared this early with any of the Departments any more 
than it was with the SALT delegation. 
From the end of March, the North Vietnamese offensive in 
South Vietnam crowded the summit preparations out of the talks in 
the special channel. For months the Soviets had been urging, in 
the interest of symmetry and great-power equality, that Kissinger 
make a "secret" pre-summit visit to Moscow to balance the "secret" 
pre-summit visit to Peking. In April Nixon finally agreed to this 
trip, with Vietnam talks primarily in mind. Kissinger was in 
Moscow from April 20 to 24. Although his written instructions 
called for discussion in Moscow of both Vietnam and summit 
preparations, Kissinger received several messages from Nixon while 
en route and in Moscow not to discuss other issues if the Vietnam 
talks proved unsatisfactory, which they did.-5 
Kissinger chose to disregard the followup instructions and 
to discuss SALT and other summit business. Brezhnev met the U.S. 
desire for a 5-year duration of the missile freeze. He proposed a 
ceiling of 950 launchers (and 62 submarines) on the Soviet SLBM 
program with the U.S. numbers to be substantially smaller at 656 
and 41. The "baseline" above which old missiles would have to be 
traded in for the Soviets to reach their ceiling was discussed, 
but no figure was agreed on. On ABMs Brezhnev repeated a formula 
then under discussion at Helsinki, which would give each country 
the right to have two sites--one to protect a missile field and 
the other to protect its national command authority (NCA).

Kissinger also reviewed with Brezhnev and Gromyko drafts of the 
agreement on "Basic Principles of U.S.-Soviet Relations", a 
document of great importance to the Soviets, which implied that 
the two countries were of equal weight in world affairs and 
emphasized the need for restraint and calm in the approach to 
world crises." 
Upon Kissinger's return Nixon, despite his anger at 
Kissinger's behavior, accepted the results of the visit. 
Kissinger believed the Soviet acceptance of an SLBM freeze was a 
significant concession, even with unequal numbers, because the 
Soviets, by his estimates, would have on duty at any one time a 
far smaller proportion of their total number of boats. Nixon 
supported this conclusion, and so, after the Navy's request for an 
accelerated Trident program was met, did Admiral Thomas Moorer, 
Chairman of the JCS. The ABM formula was also acceptable, as the 
administration had been moving toward it for some time.17 
Secretary Rogers and Gerard Smith were less satisfied with 
the SLBM formula. Rogers felt the acceptance of inequality would 
have a bad psychological effect, given the fact that the United 
States would be adding its acceptance of inequality of numbers in 
an area where it was roughly equal to its acceptance of de facto 
inequality in the freeze on ICBM launchers. Smith thougWE?CEWE?
"we should try to improve the Soviet offer and only if we did not 
succeed consider whether or not to refuse it." Otherwise, he 
believed, the United States "might be better off without an SLBM 
freeze." Both men were well aware of the U.S. lead in other 
strategic nuclear capabilities areas not covered by the freeze. 
Their concern was not that the SLBM proposal was a bad deal, but 
that it would look bad.18 
Smith strove for the inclusion of procedural language in the 
reply to Brezhnev's SLBM proposal which would leave room for 
maneuver in later negotiation. According to Smith, "the President 
said 'Bullshit.'" Nixon felt a change in procedural language was 
irrelevant. The final reply stated that the United States "could 
agree in principle to the general approach" in Brezhnev's 
proposals and raised no objections to the suggested SLBM 
ceilings 19 
The summit itself, however, appeared to be in jeopardy. 
Kissinger and Nixon agreed in early May on the need for decisive 
action to blunt North Vietnam's spring offensive. Kissinger 
believed intensification of the bombing of North Vietnam would 
cause a Soviet cancellation of the summit, and proposed that the 
United States cancel, using the excuse that the Soviets were 
supplying materiel to North Vietnam, in order to avoid the 
humiliation of having the Russians cancel it first. Nixon at 
first inclined to this view, but Secretary of the Treasury John 
Connally convinced both Nixon and Kissinger not to cancel on the

ground that if the United States initiated cancellation, it would 
bear the domestic as well as the international onus for it.2? 
On May 8, Nixon announced resumption of the bombing of 
Hanoi-Haiphong and the mining of Haiphong harbor. Suspense did 
not last long. On May 11, Nixon met with the Soviet Minister of 
Foreign Trade, whose response when Nixon mentioned the summit 
indicated the meeting was still on. According to Shevchenko, the 
Soviet leaders were so committed by this time to a summit that 
they never seriously considered cancellation.21 
By the time Air Force One left for Europe on May 20 it was 
clear that at least five minor bilateral agreements (all described 
under "Results") had been fully negotiated and were ready for 
signature. The ABM Treaty needed minor, and the Interim 
Agreement, major, additional negotiation. The agenda prepared by 
the Department of State called for detailed discussion of numerous 
economic issues: lend-lease settlement, expanded bilateral trade, 
the possible U.S. grant of MFN (most-favored-nation) treatment to 
the Soviet Union, U.S. grain sales to the Soviet Union, and 
possible U.S. aid in the development of Siberian natural gas. 
Kissinger had discouraged conclusive negotiation in all these 
areas because of his predilection for putting economic agreements 
last in the linkage chain. As he saw it at this time, most 
economic dealings were pure favors to the Soviets. 
Pre-summit talks on Vietnam had, of course, been fruitless, 
and those on the Middle East inconclusive. Both sides nonetheless 
expected to discuss these issues in Moscow. 
Discussions: Catch As Catch Can  
The Course of the Summit. The Presidential party left 
Washington on May 20 and, after stops in Austria and Poland, 
arrived in Moscow on the afternoon of May 22. All negotiations 
were conducted in the capital, but Nixon made side trips to 
Leningrad (May 27), where he visited a cemetary for war victims, 
and Kiev (May 29-30). On Sunday the 28th he attended services at 
a Baptist church and delivered, from the Kremlin, a television 
address to the Soviet people. Thoughout his visit he received 
maximum exposure from the Soviet media. The communique was issued 
on the 29th and on May 30 the White House delgation left Kiev for 
Teheran, where the Shah received Nixon for a state visit. 
The Moscow Milieu. Nixon, Kissinger, Chief of Staff 
H.R. ("Bob") Haldeman, and a number of other White House aides 
were Brezhnev's guests in the Kremlin. The Secretary of State, 
his staff, and specialists from other agencies were quartered in 
the then-new Rossiya Hotel, a 5-minute walk away. Accommodations

thus reflected the subordinate role which the Department had 
played in the preparations and continued to play during the summit 
itself. The White House and Department of State teams maintained 
separate communications centers in their respective quarters. The 
U.S. Embassy was busy as a communications center during the talks, 
but the "Moscow White House," as it became known, did not avail 
itself of the expertise of Ambassador Jacob Beam or invite him to 
sit in at any but plenary sessions, despite the fact he had been 
chosen for the post by Nixon personally. Beam's only opportunity 
to talk with the President was at a wreath-laying ceremony. 22 
The format of the talks was subject to considerable change 
from day to day. This was partly because the remote relationship 
between Nixon and Rogers, and Nixon's desire to keep the most 
important items out of Roger's hands, prevented the U.S. 
formulation of proposals for a formal agenda, as opposed to an 
understanding of the topics to be discussed. Rogers sat with 
Nixon only at the formal plenary sessions, of which there were 
four, signing ceremonies, and banquets. The Soviets for their 
part made numerous unpredictable changes of schedule. At one 
point Kissinger cabled Gerard Smith in Helsinki: "You should 
understand that we are operating in a situation where we never 
know from hour to hour with whom we are meeting or what the topic 
will be." While Kissinger believed that the Soviets intended to 
throw the U.S. delegation off balance, some of his aides believe 
that the ragged schedule was caused by Brezhnev's need to consult 
the Politburo and by the fact that the Soviet elite's work 
schedule is normally irregular.23 
Smith's very presence in Helsinki was another complicating 
factor. Nixon didn't want Smith and the SALT delegation in Moscow 
because he was determined, by Kissinger's account, that Smith not 
receive much credit for the SALT treaties. Kissinger wrote in his 
memoirs: 
"In retrospect it would have been better to have 
brought both delegations to Moscow and let them continue 
their work there in synchronization with the summit. Given 
Nixon's feelings about who should get credit, I doubt that 
he would have agreed if I had proposed it. We shall never 
know because I did not put forward the idea, not 
uninfluenced by vanity and the desire to control the final 
negotiation. "24 
Since the final negotiations on SALT were largely in Nixon's and 
Kissinger's hands in Moscow, all decisions had to be relayed to 
Helsinki for transformation into treaty language, with attendant 
confusion. Nixon had achieved the curious feat of turning the 
summit into a back channel negotiation.

Several problems occurred in the preparation of the 
Conference record. Rogers had strongly advised Nixon to 
have a U.S. translator at all sessions. Nixon refused, for 
this would have allowed the Department to receive copies of 
all talks. There were, however, no translators attached to 
the White House. Various substitutes were tried, all more 
or less unsatisfactory. At Nixon's first meeting with 
Brezhnev, the record was prepared by the only other person 
present, a Soviet interpreter. The record of at least one 
SALT discussion between Nixon and Brezhnev suffered when the 
Russian-speaking NSC rapporteur was drawn into the substance 
of the discussion.25 
Varieties of Discussion. The summit talks fell into several 
different categories. There were only four plenary meetings, 
interesting for atmospherics, but at which little business was 
transacted. Nixon was dealing with a triumvirate in which one 
member, General Secretary Brezhnev, was clearly dominant to the 
other two, Alexei Kosygin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, 
and Nikolai Podgorny, President of the Supreme Soviet. Nixon had 
one meeting alone with Brezhnev, and several at which Kissinger 
and Gromyko were in attendance. The main subject of Nixon's 
smaller meetings was SALT. Details of SALT were hammered out in 
sessions between Kissinger, his staff, Gromyko, and Soviet 
technical expert Dmitri Smirnov. Kosygin handled most of the 
economic talks on the Soviet side and met several times with 
Rogers and Peter Flanigan of the White House Staff. Because the 
summit was characterized by small group meetings with a variety of 
principals, the description below is presented topically, not 
chronologically, except for the opening and closing sessions. 
Nixon's First Talk With Brezhnev (May 22). In this 
afternoon talk Brezhnev told Nixon that it had not been easy for 
him to continue with the summit despite U.S. action in Vietnam. 
This remark was to be repeated many times by Soviet leaders in the 
following week, but this ritual does not seem to have interfered 
with substantive business. The two men then talked about the need 
for building a personal relationship. They exchanged jokes about 
the slowness and technical preoccupations of their bureaucracies. 
"They would simply bury us in paper," said Brezhnev. Nixon 
avoided the subject of Vietnam, but agreed to discuss the Middle 
East during the summit. He agreed in principle to the holding of 
a CSCE. Toward the close of the session Brezhnev mentioned that 
he would have to bring Kosygin and Podgorny to many meetings. 
Nixon reciprocated in spirit when he revealed to Brezhnev that he 
had not yet told Rogers about the "Basic Principles" agreement; 
Brezhnev sympathetically arranged to have the draft surfaced in a 
way which would not embarrass Nixon.26

The First Plenary Session (May 23). At this morning meeting 
Nixon and Brezhnev agreed to let Kissinger and Gromyko plan each 
day's agenda, and arranged to sign an agreement each day in order 
to maximize publicity. 
The memorandum of this meeting indicates the tone Nixon 
wished to set at the summit: 
"The President said that he has a strong belief in 
our system but at the same time he ,respects those 
who believe just as strongly in their system. 
There must be room in this world for two great 
nations with different systems to live together 
and work together. We cannot do this however, by 
mushy sentimentality or glossing over differences 
which exist. We can do it only by working out 
real problems in a concrete fashion, determined to 
place our common interests above our differences." 
Brezhnev in his rejoinder talked of the need for far-reaching 
decisions worthy of the stature of the two nations. 
Nixon referred to his reputation as a cold warrior and 
pleasantries were exchanged. Later, when Nixon brought up 
improvement of trade and commercial relations, he linked them to 
SALT by saying that his reputation would help him get 
congressional support "for mutually beneficial matters, assuming 
there is progress in other areas." 
Regarding the SALT negotiations, Nixon said they were only a 
beginning. Nixon and Kosygin agreed that it was best to limit 
nuclear arms now when no other power was a serious nuclear 
threat. Nixon observed that "potential great powers" could make 
advances that would threaten "both the U.S. and the Soviet 
Union...particularly China and Japan." 
Nixon expressed preference for discussing SALT in a small 
forum, and then "asked" for which day signature of the SALT 
agreements had been scheduled, implying both that he intended to 
sign no matter what and that he had either little control over, or 
little knowledge of, the scheduling. 
Nixon again endorsed a CSCE, but said it would have to be 
held after the U.S. elections and that it should be related to 
Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction (MBFR) talks. The topic was 
referred to Rogers and Gromyko.27

Final SALT Negotiations. It seemed clear at the plenary 
session that both siaes had made up their minds to resolve 
remaining SALT matters in time for signature at the summit. 
Failure of SALT would have meant failure at the summit. 
Nonetheless, there was considerable bargaining on several issues. 
They were of secondary strategic, but great psychological and 
political importance and were highly technical. 
There was only one remaining issue on the ABM Treaty. The 
United States wanted each side's two sites to be as far apart as 
possible so that they could not be used for a de facto area 
defense. At his evening session with Nixon and Kissinger on the 
23d, Brezhnev accepted the American proposal of 1,500 kilometers 
distance, unaware that the two delegations at Helsinki had already 
compromised on 1,300 kilometers. The 1,300 figure stood.28 
Completion of the Interim Agreement presented more 
challenging problems. First there was the U.S. desire to have 
limits on the size of land-based missile replacements. Already 
negotiated was a clause saying that the parties undertook not to 
convert launchers (in this case silos) for "light" ICBMs into 
launchers for "heavy" ICBMs. The number of "heavy" ICBMs, as well 
as the total number of silos, would, therefore, be frozen. There 
was no precise definition of a "heavy" ICBM. At Helsinki and at 
previous rounds the Soviet delegation had resisted such a 
definition. Could one be worked out now? 
Related, but not identical, was the issue of silo 
dimensions. The United States had originally wanted the freeze to 
prohibit such increases. The SALT delegations had reached a 
compromise prohibiting a "significant" increase in missile size. 
Could "significant" be further defined? 
At the first small meeting on the afternoon of the 23d, 
Brezhnev astonished Kissinger by implying that he would accept a 
freeze on Ea increase in either silo dimension or missile size. 
During a recess, Kissinger advised Nixon not to accept, despite 
the fact Brezhnev appeared to have accepted an American 
negotiating position of some months ago, because not increasing 
missile volume might prevent the MIRVing of U.S. Minuteman 
missiles. Instead, Nixon and Kissinger proposed in the following 
session that the "no significant increase" formula be applied to 
missiles as well as silos, and that "significant" be defined as 
over 15 percent. "Brezhnev seemed to go along with that as well," 
Kissinger later commented. When this news reached Gerard Smith in 
Helsinki, he consulted his military adviser, who "immediately 
pointed out that under the proposed formula the United States 
would have to halt its Minuteman III program...the Moscow

negotiators were about to stumble into a partial MIRV ban." Smith 
got word to Kissinger that the proposal, to be acceptable, would 
need to refer to a 15 percent increase in volume "beyond that of 
the largest light ICBM currently displayed by either side." The 
Soviet SS-11 was the largest such missile, and the formula left 
ample margin for MIRVing Minuteman.29 
Kissinger believed that Brezhnev and Nixon were both too 
unaware of the technical side of SALT (as the U.S. SALT delegation 
in turn, believed Kissinger to be) to negotiate successfully. 
Later he wrote: "The meeting demonstrated that heads of 
government should not negotiate complex subjects."3? He got his 
chance to conclude the negotiation when Nixon and Brezhnev agreed, 
after their second session on the 23d, to leave further 
exploration to Kissinger and Gromyko. This got under way at 1:15 
a.mt on the 24th. Gromyko distributed papers which in effect 
withdrew all the concessions Brezhnev had made--a Politburo 
meeting had intervened--and returned to the position the 
delegations had reached at Helsinki: There was no Soviet offer on 
missile volume, but silo dimensions could not be "significantly" 
increased--no percentage was mentioned. Over the next 24 hours 
Kissinger does not appear to have made any attempt to pursue the 
definition of a "heavy" missile, perhaps reasoning that this would 
be fruitless. His memoirs are silent on this point. He was 
aware, however, that the Soviets were planning a new missile, the 
SS-19, which would not have met the 15 percent increase in volume 
limitation, but which would fit in a silo only 15 percent larger. 
(Since silos have both length and width, the actual volume 
increase under the "15 percent" formula proved to be 32 percent, a 
consideration Kissinger was not aware of at the time.)31 
Kissinger continued to hold out for the limitation to 
15 percent of increases in silo volume. 
The most important SALT issue discussed at the conference 
was the replacement formula for SLBMs. The Soviet Union wanted 30 
missiles on H-class (older nuclear) and 60 on G-class (diesel) 
submarines not to count toward replacement, but to be in addition  
to the 950 missile limit Brezhnev had proposed in April. In his 
discussions with Dobrynin in the special channel just before the 
summit, Kissinger had argued that the missiles on H and G-class 
boats should count. While the summit was in progress, Smith 
cabled from Helsinki that he continued to believe that it was 
better to exclude SLBMs from the Interim Agreement altogether 
rather than make a poor deal. Kissinger fought hard for the 
inclusion of H and G-class boats but felt two considerations were 
paramount. One was that it was more important to bring about the 
removal of old land-based missiles under an SLBM replacement 
formula than to worry too much about missiles on boats which had

not been deployed within range of the United States for several 
years. The other was that with no SLBM agreement, the Soviets 
would be capable of building up to 80 submarines by the end of the 
freeze rather than the 62 Brezhnev had proposed. (Many analysts 
have subsequently believed this projection to be too high.)34 
Matters were further complicated when a news leak on May 
24th revealed the basic numbers under consideration for the SLBM 
Protocol. Kissinger's deputy, Alexander Haig, cabled that 
Senators Goldwater and Jackson were expressing alarm and that the 
Joint Chiefs were threatening to stray from the reservation. 
Kissinger took the news to Nixon, who later described his decision: 
"'The hell with the political consequences,' I 
said. 'We are going to make an agreement on our 
terms regardless of the political consequences if 
the Pentagon won't go along.' I determined not to 
allow either the Pentagon on the right or the 
Soviets on the left to drive me away from the 
position I believed was in the best interests of 
the country."33 
After prolonged haggling during at least three meetings held 
from early on the 24th to early on the 25th, Kissinger won Soviet 
consent to include the H-class boats in the replacement formula, 
and then offered to exclude G-class vessels unless the Soviets 
chose to refit them with more modern missiles. Nixon and 
Kissinger also agreed not to trade in missiles to build up to the 
U.S. cap of 710 tubes for the duration of the 5-year freeze.34 
One last SLBM issue was negotiated--the number of boats and 
tubes each side would be allowed as a "base line" above which it 
would have to retire older missiles if it was to build up to its 
SLBM limit. Kissinger succeeded in getting Smirnov to reduce the 
Soviet base line from 768 to 740; the United States base line was 
656. 
In the early morning of the 26th, Kissinger, Gromyko, and 
Smirnov adjourned. Only the silo dimension and G-class 
modernization issues prevented full agreement. Kissinger stated 
there would be no further concessions on the U.S. side. The 
signing ceremony had been tentatively postponed to Sunday, should 
agreement be reached. 
The next morning, the Soviets accepted the U.S. position on 
silo dimension and the status of the G-class tubes, but insisted 
that a signing take place that very evening. Enormous confusion 
ensued as the SALT delegations worked out a final draft on the way 
to Moscow. The SALT Agreements were signed right on schedule, but 
the texts contained errors. Nixon and Brezhnev signed corrected 
revisions in private the next day.35

European Questions. At the plenary meeting the morning of 
May 24, Brezhnev made much of Soviet willingness to include the 
United States "in all matters relating to the European 
continent...even though the U.S. was not a European nation." This 
attitude was proof "that the Soviet Union was willing to let the 
United States defend its own interests in Europe." He then made a 
lengthy presentation on the desirability of convening the CSCE 
early. 
Nixon emphasized that not only the United States, but 
several European countries would be preoccupied with elections in 
1972. Fencing ensued as to whether CSCE matters could be dealt 
with apart from or in advance of MBFR, Nixon being determined not 
to let CSCE overshadow or replace MBFR. The matter was referred 
to Rogers and Gromyko. 
The meeting ended on a jovial note, with Nixon joking that 
he did not want to irritate such Soviet friends as the Albanians, 
and Brezhnev protesting that "the USSR heeded the voice of 
Luxembourg as well."38 
Rogers, Gromyko, and their aides, including Dobrynin, met in 
the afternoon of the 25th. Gromyko probed to see whether there 
was any give in the U.S. position on the convening of the CSCE. 
Rogers allowed that bilateral consultations might take place 
during 1972, but vetoed convening even a preliminary conference 
until after the November elections. Of the Soviet-suggested 
agenda topics, which included territorial integrity, inviolability 
of borders, and nonapplication of force, Rogers was lukewarm on 
"the inviolability of borders," stating that one must ask "which 
borders." Gromyko assured him they were thinking of a principle, 
"not with specific application to border disputes." 
Rogers presented a number of possible scenarios for 
coordinating MBFR with the CSCE. All had as a common denominator 
the linkage of results in MBFR with progress on the Soviet CSCE 
agenda. The Secretary did agree with Gromyko that while MBFR 
might be discussed at the CSCE, it was not itself the forum at 
which the MBFR should be negotiated.37 
There European matters apparently rested. The communiqu?
mentioned the CSCE but set no date, saying it should be convened 
"without undue delay." Kissinger states in his memoirs, "Our 
strategy was to tie the European Security Conference to talks on 
troop reductions and both of them to an end of the Vietnam 
War. "38

The Middle East. At a meeting with Gromyko on the afternoon 
of the 25th, the Foreign Minister told Rogers that unless the 
United States had new proposals, "a discussion of the Middle East 
probably would not be necessary." On Friday, the 25th, Kissinger 
succeeded in getting "the blandest possible" language on the 
Middle East put in the communique. The two sides "reaffirmed 
their support for a peaceful settlement" in accordance with UN 
Resolution 242, endorsed the mission of UN Special Representative 
Gunnar Jarring, and called for "a military relaxation in the 
area." It was Kissinger's belief that the blander the communique, 
the more the radical Arab States would become disenchanted with 
Moscow. This section of the communiqu?lso comported with 
Rogers' objectives, for the Secretary did not believe "that any 
terms we might be able to agree on with Moscow would be acceptable 
to Israel." On Sunday, the 27th, contrary to what he had told 
Rogers, Gromyko spent 4 hours with Kissinger, reaching what 
Kissinger later described as "tentative agreement" on "general 
working principles" for the Middle East which were to be fleshed 
out later between himself and Dobrynin, but never were. "Their 
practical consequence was to confirm the deadlock," Kissinger 
wrote later. Also germane to the Middle East was the statement 
of "Basic Principles," signed and published on May 29, which spoke 
of "presenting situations capable of causing a dangerous 
exacerbation of their relations" and avoiding conflicts or 
situations" which would "increase international tensions."39 
Vietnam. The only notable discussion of Vietnam was staged 
to appear impromptu. After Nixon's two meetings on SALT with 
Brezhnev on the 24th, Brezhnev propelled Nixon out of the room and 
into his limousine. After a high-speed ride to Brezhnev's country 
dacha, with U.S. Secret Service men and Henry Kissinger bringing 
up the rear, the General Secretary treated the President to a boat 
ride. 
At a pre-dinner meeting, joviality ended when Nixon remarked 
that the collateral issue of Vietnam should not mar detente. The 
three Soviet leaders then took turns lambasting him. Brezhnev, in 
a bullying tone, spoke of the cruelty of the bombing of the North, 
and charged that the opening to China was meant to induce the 
Soviets to intervene with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. 
Kosygin, described by Kissinger as more correct but also more 
aggressive, predicted U.S. failure, complained about damage to 
Soviet ships in Haiphong harbor, and described Nguyen Van Thieu as 
a "mercenary President so-called." When Nixon asked who chose Ho 
Chi Minh, Kosygin replied: "The entire people." 
Podgorny was polite, but "just as tough," Nixon later 
wrote. When he had finished, it was almost 11 p.m. (dinner had 
been scheduled for 8 p.m.). Kissinger believed, "We were 
participants in a charade." The meeting was to make "a transcript 
to send to Hanoi."

Nixon, in reply, said that although Moscow had helped 
reconvene the Paris talks, they had gotten nowhere; that Hanoi, 
not Washington, had rejected Brezhnev's cease-fire offer; and that 
30,000 South Vietnamese civilians had been killed by Soviet 
equipment in that spring's offensive. He offered to take up 
Vietnam later in the week. Shortly thereafter the meeting broke 
up 40 
In his last private meeting with Nixon on Monday the 29th, 
Brezhnev offered to send Podgorny to Hanoi if it would be 
helpful. Nixon assented and undertook not to bomb Hanoi and 
Haiphong during the visit--as long as Podgorny didn't stay too 
long. Kissinger commented later that he and Nixon knew in advance 
the trip would be more of a report to Hanoi on the summit than a 
sincere mediating attempt, but that there had been no way to 
refuse the offer.41 
Overall, Vietnam was a very subsidiary issue at the summit. 
Kissinger rejected, during sessions held May 27 and 28, Gromyko's 
attempts to get the United States to endorse a coalition 
government and to agree to joint language in the communique. The 
final communiqu?ontained separate statements by each side which 
rehashed long-held positions on Indochina.42 
Economic Talks. No economic agreements were reached at the 
summit, but several items were discussed on which agreement was 
reached a few months later. 
In a conversation with Trade Minister N. S. Patolichev on 
May 23 following the initial plenary meeting, Rogers continued the 
linkage theme when he remarked that "if we could get rid of some 
of the main political problems then we could move to some large 
deals." Patolichev outlined Soviet terms for a grain deal--$750 
million in purchases over 3 years ($200 million the first year) 
with a credit line of $500 million. The credit terms the Soviets 
wanted were too liberal for the Department. When Patolichev asked 
for "more agreeable proposals," Rogers replied: "Our suitcases 
are empty." Patolichev then claimed the Soviet harvest wasn't as 
bad as advertised. 
The conferees agreed to draft language setting up a Joint 
Trade Commission, to be included in the communique.43 
There was some mention of outstanding Soviet lend-lease 
debts to the United States, a subject to which Kosygin and Rogers 
returned on May 25. Rogers stated the U.S. position: $750 
million in principal plus $250 million in interest. Kosygin 
retorted that the figure was "not realistic" and emphasized that 
the Soviet loss of MFN treatment (for restoration of which a 
lend-lease settlement was the American price) had damaged the

Soviet Union: "U.S. should pay those damages." The Soviet offer 
was $200 million. Kosygin said it shouldbe discussed with 
Nixon.44 
Later that day at a plenary meeting Nixon and Kosygin set 
the principal at $500 million.45 Meeting again with Rogers on 
the 26th, Kosygin objected to interest of more than 2 percent and 
held out for a 50-year payment schedule, to match that given the 
British many years previously. Rogers pointed out that Congress 
would not accept such terms. Kosygin held out grain sales as a 
bait, but Rogers would not respond. Toward the end of the talk, 
Kosygin accused Rogers of undercutting the Preiident. Rogers 
commented that it wasn't necessary to settle during the summit 
because there was "no rush." Kosygin wanted to go back to Nixon, 
but this apparently was not done. In a final go-round on 
lend-lease on the 28th, Kosygin agreed that Rogers could tell the 
Congress progress had been made, that the lend-lease talks were 
not deadlocked, and that there would be further discussions. In a 
contradictory vein, however, Kosygin reserved the right to reopen 
the question of the principal amount." 
Another topic of discussion was U.S. private development of 
Siberian natural gas. In a talk on the 26th, Kosygin hinted his 
desire for U.S. Government underwriting. Rogers did not respond, 
perhaps aware that this idea was far down on Kissinger's linkage 
list.47 
The communiqu?eflected the discussions, saying the 
countries were working for a trade agreement which would be 
negotiated concurrently with a lend-lease settlement.48 
Final Meetings. At the final private meeting mentioned in 
the section on Vietnam, the atmosphere was relaxed. Brezhnev also 
brought up the idea of an agreement by the United States and the 
Soviet Union on the non-use of atomic weapons against each other. 
Nixon sidestepped by saying discussion should continue in the 
special channel; he and Kissinger thought the proposal was bound 
to bring trouble with NATO and with China. Kissinger wrote: 
"Brezhnev then delicately introduced what may well 
have been the Kremlin's deepest interest in detente. 
He hinted that both countries might usefully keep an 
eye on the nuclear aspirations of Peking. Nixon gave 
him no encouragement." 
At the end

The last plenary session, held at midday on May 29, was 
devoted to generalities about the progress made on all fronts and 
to a good deal of good-humored banter. Nixon and Brezhnev 
re-enacted the invitation and acceptance for a return summit in 
Washington which had already been written into the communique (the 
date was not yet set). The summit then ended with a touch of 
hyperbole when Nixon suggested that the leaders set as a goal for 
their next meeting the establishment of peace everywhere in the 
world. "50 
Results: Substantial Achievement Marred by Considerable Confusion  
General Considerations. The 1972 summit presents many 
contradictions. It benefited from substantial advance planning 
but suffered from last-minute, helter-skelter decisions. Nixon 
and the Soviet leaders established a personal relationship but 
some meetings were acrimonious. Several of the supposed successes 
of the summit were actually-negotiated in advance. The 
achievements which culminated in the summit gave considerable 
impetus to d?nte, but their flaws and the manner of their 
achievement generated controversy which would later help undermine 
detente. 
One problem faced in evaluating the summit is to disentangle 
the results of the summit per se from those of the peculiar 
foreign policy apparatus of the early Nixon administration. If, 
for instance, there were deficiencies in the SALT treaties, should 
they be attributed to summit pressures or to the frequent use of 
the back channel in resolving difficulties for over a year prior 
to the summit? Conversely, if the back channel had not been in 
operation, would there have been any SALT agreement at all? 
A related question is whether the very expectation of a 
summit distorted the negotiating process. Gerard Smith commented 
that once a summit is agreed on, a major negotiation connected 
with it is unlikely to be concluded before the summit takes 
place. At the same time, he also noted, it also imposes pressure 
to reach some kind of agreement, in this case "more pressure on 
the visitor than on the host, especially as the visitor would face 
a presidential election 6 months later." Kissinger on the other 
hand was proud of his role in the conclusion of SALT, pointing out 
that the time from the initiation of the negotiation to its 
conclusion was only 2 1/2 years, compared with the 4 years needed 
for the nonproliferation treaty. The implication was that a 
deadline could be useful.51

The Highfloint of Detente. Certainly the single most 
important meaning of this summit meeting was that it marked a 
period of increased U.S.-Soviet contacts and generally improved 
relations. Moscow's decision to go ahead with the summit despite 
the U.S. bombing and minings in North Vietnam was a signal that 
the Soviet Union would at least temporarily put great power 
relationships ahead of "wars of liberation." The U.S. opening to 
China no doubt reinforced this Soviet tendency. Nixon and 
Brezhnev established considerable personal rapport. Shevchenko 
states that although the Soviet leaders "never really felt at ease 
with Nixon" and distrusted him, they did "find, in his behavior 
definite similarities to their own," such as his "natural 
inclination towards secret arrangements," and "concluded that it 
might be possible to deal with him in the world of 
realpolitik. "52 
Nixon and Brezhnev met two times more before Nixon 
resigned. Brezhnev and President Gerald Ford met twice in the 
latter's brief administration, so that five meetings were held in 
4 years, compared with five in the preceeding 27 years. 
The SALT Agreements. In analyzing the impact of the SALT 
negotiations at the summit, as distinct from the viability of the 
SALT agreements as a whole, it is clear that: 
1) There had been no anticipation before the summit that 
the Soviets would agree to define a "heavy" missile. Therefore, 
when the prospect of such a definition initially held out by 
Brezhnev was withdrawn, there was no net loss. 
2) On silo dimensions, Kissinger obtained what he thought 
was a favorable concession at the time. Any flaw in the expected 
result was not a result of the summit bargaining process, but of 
his knowledge of the subject. 
3) Concerning the distance between ABM sites, the withdrawal 
of Brezhnev's "concession" merely put the result back to what had 
been achieved at Helsinki. 
4) SLBM ceilings had been agreed to before the summit. The 
baseline and the replacement formula had not. The combination of 
the high Soviet ceiling and the replacement formula concluded at 
the summit occasioned much criticism from Senator Jackson and 
other congressional defense specialists. The Soviets were said to 
be getting a "free ride" because they probably didn't have as many 
missile submarines as the SLBM launcher baseline assumed and 
because they could retain the 60 G-class missiles. Kissinger's 
retort to such criticisms was that the agreement kept the Soviets 
from building more submarines than they would have otherwise

during the 5-year freeze period, and that the United States had no 
plans to deploy new submarines during the same period (the Ohio 
class would not be ready until 1978). 
5) Other greatly criticized aspects of the 1972 SALT 
agreements were, from the left, that they did not address the MIKV 
problem, and from the right, that they did not reduce the Soviet 
advantages in throw weight or total number of launchers. These 
supposed flaws, however, were in no way related to the summit, 
growing instead out of the nature of the U.S. defense posture, the 
Nixon administration's overall approach to arms control, and the 
negotiating techniques of the two SALT delegations. 
Thus, despite the extreme confusion--"the fog of 
negotiation," as Smith put it--of the Moscow talks, the summit did 
not fundamentally alter the already emergent nuclear agreements. 
The ABM Treaty required ratification, and the Interim 
Agreement, under the Arms Control Act, needed the approval of both 
Houses of Congress. The Interim Agreement was accompanied by an 
amendment introduced by Senator Jackson and co-sponsored by 42 
other Senators, which requested "the President to seek a future 
treaty that...would not limit the United States to levels of 
intercontinental strategic forces inferior to the limits provided 
for the Soviet Union."5i The Jackson amendment was inspired by 
the fact that the Interim Agreement froze the existing inequality 
in ICBM launches and allowed the Soviets to obtain a numerical 
superiority in SLBM launchers. Yet, even Jackson, after exacting 
his price, voted for both instruments. Another part of his price 
became apparent in the months that followed: Most of the leading 
figures in ACDA and the SALT delegation resigned or were 
transferred to other duties. Smith wrote that "somebody had to 
hold the bag for criticism of the agreements, and there were only 
two candidates--the White House or ACDA."54 
More than 2 years after the summit, two documents connected 
with it became public in a way which injured the credibility of 
the arms control process. In June 1972, Dobrynin gave Kissinger 
an interpretation of the SLBM replacement provisions which would 
have included G-class boats in the base line. Apparently the 
Soviets, having second thoughts, had decided they would rather 
forego the extra SLBMs represented by the G-class tubes than 
dismantle 60 ICBMs. Nixon and Kissinger held them to the original 
agreement (also a second-thought turnabout) and an 
"Interpretation" to this effect was signed by Kissinger and 
Dobrynin on July 21. Because of the way the interpretation was 
drafted, however, it would through an oversight have allowed the 
Soviet Union to retrofit the G-class boats, if it had so chosen 
(it did not) with an entirely new type of missile without 
including them in the cap of 935: The "Interpretation" was not 
made public and was not made known to the SALT delegation.

The other document was Nixon's letter to Brezhnev of May 28, 
in which the President stated he had no plans to trade in Titans 
for new SLBM tubes during the freeze. In effect this meant the 
United States was frozen at 41 SLBM submarines rather than the 44 
specified in the protocol. (The United States had no plans to 
build three more Poseidon submarines anyway.) This document too 
was closely held. The fact that Kissinger stated at a 
congressional hearing on June 15, 1972, that there had been "no 
secret understandings" made at Moscow on arms control helped to 
maximize the impact of the Nixon letter when it became public.55 
When the existence of these two documents was revealed in a 
newspaper account in June 1974, Senator Jackson argued that at the 
summit Kissinger had "secretly" given the Soviets a 124 missile 
advantage--the 54 unbuilt U.S. SLBMs plus the 60 to 70 Soviet  
G-class tubes. Kissinger was able in subsequent testimony to 
satisfy most critics,50 but the legend of a summit sell-out 
persisted in a way that added momentum to the arguments of 
skeptics of the arms control process. The manner, more than the 
matter, of the summit and post-summit back channel SALT 
negotiations damaged arms control. 
The Basic Principles of Relations Between the United States  
of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In 
addition to the provisions cited previously, the "Basic 
Principles" explicitly endorsed "peaceful coexistence" and 
committed each party not "to obtain unilateral advantage at the 
cpense of the other," "to widen the juridical basis of their 
mutual relations," to continue "efforts to limit armaments," 
especially "strategic armaments," to expand commercial ties, and 
to "recognize the sovereign equality of all states." It 
concluded: "The development of U.S.-Soviet relations is not 
directed against third countries and their interests." 
The principal practical impact of this document was on 
Soviet-Egyptian relations. Kissinger and Middle East specialists 
believe that the "Basic Principles" and the communiqu? language 
on the Middle East were of great importance in President Anwar 
Sadat's decision in the summer of 1972 to expel Soviet advisers 
from Egypt, a conclusion confirmed by Sadat's own memoirs. The 
Soviet presence there became a casualty of detente.57 The 
"Basic Principles" also caused a brief flurry in the NATO 
capitals, where some government officials worried that the use of 
the term "peaceful coexistence" in a formal understanding might 
weaken the U.S. resolve to defend Western Europe, however much 
they might regard peaceful coexistence as something to be striven 
for.

Podgorny's Visit to Vietnam. Podgorny arrived in Hanoi in 
mid-June and during his stay the United States did not bomb Hanoi 
or Haiphong. In a letter to Nixon dated June 21, Brezhnev stated 
that North Vietnamese leaders were "attentive" to the information 
Podgorny gave them about the American position as stated during 
the summit and "spoke of their readiness" to resume the Paris 
talks. Brezhnev proposed that Nixon suggest a date; according to 
Kissinger, he had already done so on June 12. Talks resumed on 
July 13. Podgorny's trip does not appear to have played much of a 
role in the resumption. 
The Agreement on Prevention of Incidents at Sea. Of the 
"minor" agreements negotiated in preparation for the summit, this 
one has proven the longest lasting and most useful. It 
established procedures for the avoidance of incidents involving 
U.S. and Soviet vessels which might occur in the course of their 
close surveillance of each other, and for the exchange of 
information on incidents which did occur. A joint commission 
established later under the agreement meets once a year to monitor 
its operation. The navies of both nations have found this 
agreement to be of great practical value. 
Other Minor Agreements. The Agreement on Cooperation in 
Space provided for the docking of a U.S. and a Soviet spacecraft 
which took place several years later. The Agreements on Medical 
Science and Public Health, Environmental Protection, and Science 
and Technology each provided for exchange of specialists and 
information, and the planning of joint programs, in their 
respective fields. 
CSCE. The North Atlantic Council held a Ministerial Session 
in Bonn immediately following the Moscow summit on May 30-31, 
1972. In their communiqu?the Ministers noted the imminent 
signing of the Final Protocol to the Quadripartite Agreement on 
Berlin (June 3) to which they linked their agreement to initiate 
"the necessary arrangements for beginning the multilateral 
preparatory talks."50 Also in the communiqu?as language 
warning against unilateral force reductions which "would 
jeopardize the prospects for mutual and balanced force 
reductions." Parallel MBFR and CSCE talks eventually got under 
way in Helsinki in late October 1973. 
Economic Measures. Soon after the summit, officials from 
the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Commerce signed in 
Washington with a Soviet official an agreement providing the 
Soviet Union with $750 million in credits over 3 years, the same 
figure which had been on the table in Moscow. Simultaneously, 
however, the Soviets were buying up at low prices over $1 billion 
in grain from different U.S. grain companies, soaking up most of

the American surplus and driving up domestic prices. Even 
Kissinger admitted that in this matter the "Soviet Union played a 
cool hand and outwitted us at the summit." He claimed that the 
administration had no knowledge of the "catastrophic" nature of 
the Soviet crop failure. Indications to the contrary have been 
widely publicized. It is probably the case that the 
administration had considerable knowledge of the Soviet grain 
problem but not of its full extent or of the extent to which the 
Soviets would be dependent on American supplies rather than those 
of other exporters. 
Nixon and Kissinger were determined not to let Soviet sharp 
practice on the grain deal stand in the way of expanded trade 
relationships now that the Berlin Agreements had been finalized. 
The United States had gained at Soviet expense in the Middle East, 
the SALT process was continuing, and the Soviet Union had 
indicated the limits of its involvement with Hanoi. A lend-lease 
settlement which Kissinger reached with Brezhnev during a visit to 
Moscow in September 1972 (for a total of $722 million including 
interest--even Kissinger noted that "it was not a famous victory") 
cleared the way for a trade agreement which would grant MFN status 
to the Soviet Union. In August, however, the Soviets placed an 
exit tax on Jewish emigrants, and the implementation of the 
U.S.-Soviet Trade Agreement signed in Washington on October 18, 
1972 became tied, via a series of Congressional maneuvers in which 
Senator Jackson took the lead, to the removal of the tax and the 
expansion of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union. The MFN 
provisions of the agreement have never gone into effect."

NIXON AND BREZHNEV AT WASHINGTON, 
CAMP DAVID, AND SAN CLEMENTE, 
JUNE 18-25, 1973 
The Brezhnev visit to the United States (June 18-25), 
undertaken more at Soviet initiative than American, took place 
amidst much fanfare but under the cloud of the Watergate 
hearings. Preparations were conducted primarily by a special 
interagency committee under the National Security Council's 
Senior Review Group, although some details were smoothed out by 
National Security Adviser Henry A. Kissinger during a May visit 
to the Soviet Union. Like Khrushchev's visit in 1959, 
Brezhnev's was marked by public demonstrations, mainly by 
Jewish groups critical of restrictive Soviet emigration 
policies. During the visit ten agreements were signed, the 
most important of which was an understanding on the prevention 
of nuclear war. In several private talks with Nixon at Camp 
David and San Clemente, Brezhnev also emphasized his anxiety 
over improving U.S.-Chinese ties and tried unsuccessfully to 
draw Nixon and Kissinger into an implied alliance against the 
Chinese. In their final meeting at San Clemente, Brezhnev also 
tried to bully Nixon into a secret deal to end the Middle 
Eastern conflict. 
Initiative: Uncertain Aftermath of the 1972 Summit  
The final communique of the May 1972 Moscow summit referred 
to another summit meeting to be held in Washington, but the 
date was not stipulated. In the fall of 1972 the Soviets 
evinced little interest in another summit, indicating that in 
the absence of a nuclear agreement the Soviet Union preferred 
November 1973 as a date. The United States wanted to postpone 
the meeting for different reasons: to finish the Year of Europe 
and further to improve relations with China.1 
In February 1973, the Soviet Union showed new interest in a 
meeting. Brezhnev wrote to Nixon using the ploy of rejecting 
May as the date for a summit (a date never proposed) and 
offering to push the meeting back to June. In the letter 
Brezhnev suggested goals for the summit: progress on SALT, the 
signing of the agreement on nonuse of nuclear weapons, and the 
signing of accords on trade, science and technology, health, 
and peaceful uses of atomic energy. The Soviet leader also 
expressed interest in discussing the Middle East and various 
European issues.2

Prospects for the summit were complicated by two domestic 
developments in the United States. The first was the 
introduction in April 1973 of the Jackson amendment to the 
Trade Reform Act, by which the grant of most-favored-nation 
(MFN) status to the Soviet Union would be linked to Jewish 
emigration. Soviet suspension of the exit tax on emigrants, 
which the White House belatedly communicated to Senate leaders 
and Brezhnev's personal assurances in Moscow to a group of 
visiting Senators, failed to stop introduction of the 
amendment. The second event was the beginning of the Senate 
Watergate hearings in May. White House aide John Dean was 
scheduled to testify on June 18, the day Brezhnev was to arrive 
in the United States. Under pressure from the Senate 
leadership, Committee Chairman Sam Ervin postponed Dean's 
testimony a week, until after Brezhnev's departure.3 
The summit agenda, and a draft text of the agreement on the 
prevention of nuclear war, -were ironed out during the visit of 
National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger to the Soviet Union 
May 6-9. As part of the sounding out of each side's position 
on the various issues, Kissinger also discussed the issue of 
Jewish emigration. He gave Brezhnev a list compiled by 
American Jewish leaders of 1,000 Jews who wanted to leave the 
Soviet Union and were considered "hardship' cases. Not only 
did Brezhnev promise to look into these cases, but he indicated 
that the Soviet Union would try to maintain the annual level of 
Jewish emigration at about 40,000. The Soviet leader made 
clear to Kissinger that new U.S. SALT proposals for freezing 
testing and deployment of MIRV'd missiles, which the Soviet 
Union had not yet even begun testing but which the United 
States had been deploying for three years, were unacceptable. 
On the other hand, the United States opposed the Soviet 
proposal advanced in the spring of 1973 for a ban on testing 
and deployment of all new strategic systems. As one writer has 
observed, "SALT thus remained at a stalemate" and there was 
little room for maneuver at the summit on the issue of arms 
control .4 
The agreement on the prevention of nuclear war had been 
discussed inconclusively at the Moscow 1972 summit and had been 
raised again by the Soviets in the fall of that year in the 
Kissinger-Dobrynin channel and during Gromyko's visit to 
Washington in October. Nixon and Kissinger, who were never 
that enthusiastic about the agreement because of the appearence 
of a Soviet-American "condominium", used it to "keep Brezhnev 
on the hook" so as to win concessions for the United States in 
.other areas. Responsibility for drafting the agreement was 
left entirely to Kissinger. Not even the Secretary of State or

Secretary of Defense knew of the agreement. Kissinger, 
however, consulted extensively with the British expert on 
Soviet affairs, Sir Thomas Brimelow, who eventually helped 
draft the text that was agreed to by Kissinger and Brezhnev in 
May. For the United States, the advantage of Brimelow's draft 
was that it removed from the Soviet text implications of the 
preeminence of Soviet-American relations over U.S. relations 
with its allies and focused more on the threat of force with 
any kind of weapon as contrasted to the Soviet emphasis on 
nuclear weapons.5 
Preparations: NSC Oversight  
In the spring of 1973, the United States and the Soviet 
Union were in the process of negotiating bilateral agreements 
in several areas: transportation, oceanography, contacts and 
exchanges, taxation, peaceful uses of atomic energy, 
agriculture, and civil aviation. By late May agreed texts for 
all but the last two had been achieved and it was considered 
possible that agreement would be reached on those two during 
the visit.6 
The President directed the NSC's Senior Review Group headed 
by Kissinger to oversee preparations for the visit. Within the 
Senior Review Group framework, an ad hoc interagency committee 
chaired by Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs 
Walter J. Stoessel was established to assist with preparations 
and coordination. Various working groups were also set up to 
deal with substantive preparations, administrative and protocol 
arrangements, press arrangements, security, and 
communications.7 
The substantive briefing papers on various issues were 
condensed into a "basic memorandum" from Kissinger to the 
President, which reviewed the major issues likely to be 
discussed and provided the President with talking points on 
each. In the memorandum Kissinger indicated that Brezhnev had 
invested much personal prestige in the success of detente and 
therefore wanted the visit to provide tangible signs of 
economic benefits to the U.S.S.R. and improvement in 
U.S.-Soviet relations. He was also concerned about the public 
imagery associated with the visit and, in contrast to how 
Khrushchev had appeared during his 1959 visit, did not want to 
be the object of public demonstrations or to play the part of 
the tourist. Kissinger felt that Brezhnev would be "more 
confident and self-assured" than he had been at the 1972 summit 
when he was uncertain about meeting the President and had just 
gone through a major confrontation in the Politburo over his 
policies and position. His health was slipping a little and he

was expected to rely more on Gromyko for details than he had 
the previous year. Brezhnev was also expected to be "vague or 
rhetorical" on all issues except the military-related 
ones--SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks), Mutual Balanced 
Force Reductions (MBFR), and the nuclear agreement. 
China was Brezhnev's great frustration and he had spoken 
ominously to Kissinger during his visit in May about the 
Chinese, claiming that the United States would make a mistake 
in trusting them. He obviously wanted to wean the United 
States away from the Chinese, but didn't know' how to do it. 
There was little doubt, according to Kissinger, that the Soviet 
Union had "contemplated military action against the Chinese, 
but this was an agonizing decision without knowledge of the 
U.S. course of action." Kissinger foresaw that one of the 
major post-summit problems would be how to manage the 
U.S.-Soviet-Chinese triangle, because the Soviet Union would 
try to convince China and other countries that a 
Soviet-American condominium was being establshed. 
Kissinger did not believe Brezhnev would try to take 
advantage of Nixon's Watergate troubles: 
If Brezhnev believes that the present situation in the US 
provides him with unusual opportunities for unilateral 
gains -- because of our alleged need for a foreign policy 
'success' -- this has not been evident in the summit 
preparations. In all the negotiations on the various 
agreements to be signed the Soviets have, if anything, 
yielded on more points than we have.8 
The Meetings: Fanfare and Modest Expectations  
Brezhnev and his party arrived in the United States on June 
16. Because of the General Secretary's concern about the 
effects of jet lag and for reasons of prestige, he rested for 
two days at Camp Davie before a formal arrival ceremony was 
held at the White House on the morning of June 18. The Soviet 
party also included Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, Minister 
of Foreign Trade Nikolai S. Patolichev, and Minister of Civil 
Aviation Boris P. Bugayev, among others. During the visit the 
President and Brezhnev spent 47 hours together--more than 9 
hours in private meetings, another 9 hours in formal sessions, 
and nearly 29 hours at informal gatherings, social functions, 
and signing ceremonies.10 Meetings were held in Washington, 
Camp David, and at San Clemente.

? 
In addition to formal dinners at the White House and at the 
Soviet Embassy, Brezhnev met on June 19 with members of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to whom he made a spirited 
defense of Soviet emigration policy, and on June 22 with 
American business leaders. These included Secretary of the 
Treasury George P. Shultz, Secretary of Commerce Frederick 
Dent, officers of various business organizations, and 
representatives of more than 40 banks and companies that were 
already doing business with the Soviet Union or planned to do 
so. Later that evening he met at the Soviet Embassy with 
officials of the Communist Party of the United States.11 
U. Alexis Johnson, chief U.S. negotiator on SALT who 
returned to Washington during the summit, found the deference 
shown to Brezhnev "quite repellent". No friendly chief of 
state, in his view, had ever received such lavish hospitality. 
He felt that such extravagant treatment would neither moderate 
Brezhnev's behavior nor reassure Allied leaders, many of whom 
Johnson felt were treated cavalierly during their visits to 
Washington 12 
The Soviets proposed that the agreements all be signed on 
June 19, the second day of the visit, but the Department of 
State objected since it would create the impression the 
agreements were not the result of the summit but were "part of 
a public presentation prepared and canned in advance." 
Moreover, spreading the signing ceremonies over several days 
would maximize press attention to the agreements.13 As a 
result the signing of the nine agreements was spread out over a 
five-day period from June 19-23. 
The first substantive meeting took place on June 18 at the 
White House immediately after the arrival ceremony on the South 
Lawn, during which Brezhnev broke ranks with the official party 
and rushed over to the front row of onlookers "to shake hands 
like an American politician on the campaign trail." Although 
the first meeting was supposed to include the two leaders and 
several of their aides, Nixon and Brezhnev posed alone for 
photographs and then met privately for an hour with only Soviet 
translator Victor Sukhodrev present. In later conversations 
with Dobrynin, Kissinger got the impression that the 
conversation was general and no agreements were reached, but 
Sukhodrev never gave Kissinger the record of the conversation 
as he had promised.14 Nixon recalled in his memoirs that he 
and Brezhnev reviewed their general schedule and the agenda for 
the meetings. Brezhnev, who became very animated during the 
meeting and several times grabbed Nixon's arm to emphasize a

point, spoke about the special responsibilities the United 
States' and the Soviet Union had: 
We know that as far as power and influence are concerned, 
the only two nations in the world that really matter are 
the Soviet Union and the United States. Anything that we 
decide between us, other nations in the world will have to 
follow our lead, even though they may disagree with it. 
Nixon reminded Brezhnev that both countries had allies, all of 
whom were proud nations and "we must never act in such a way 
that appears to ignore their interests."15 
The first formal gathering, which lasted nearly 3 hours 
during the early afternoon on June 18, was also attended by 
Secretary of State William Rogers, Kissinger, NSC staff member 
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, Gromyko, Ambassador Anatoli Dobrynin, and 
Sukhodrev. Brezhnev spent much of the meeting summarizing the 
history of Soviet-American relations. Nixon was not prepared 
for a long meeting. The briefing paper supplied by Kissinger's 
staff suggested that he agree on an agenda for the remaining 
meetings and disabuse Brezhnev of any idea that the United 
States would accept a condominium arrangement in world 
affairs 16 
The second day's talks, on June 19, lasted from the early 
afternoon until evening and were concluded on board the 
Presidential yacht Secluoia.. On June 20 and 21, the talks were 
continued at Camp David. According to Nixon, during these 
initial talks in Washington Brezhnev expressed disappointment 
at the withholding of Most-Favored-Nation status, but he was 
careful to blame Congress and not the President for the 
decision. Although Brezhnev opposed limiting the number of 
Soviet MIRVed missiles, he did reluctantly agree to set the end 
of 1974 instead of 1975 as a deadline for reaching a permanent 
SALT accord. At Camp David there were long sessions on SALT, 
European security, and MBFR. Perhaps the high point of the 
summit was Nixon's and Brezhnev's signing on June 22, in a 
formal ceremony at the White House, of the Agreement for the 
Prevention of Nuclear War, which provided for consultation in 
situations that posed the threat of nuclear weapons. Both 
nations renounced the use or threat of force against each other 
and against the other's allies. According to one of 
Kissinger's aides, the President and his National Security 
Adviser felt they had "defanged" the agreement of its 
potentially harmful language.17 
The most significant meetings, in Kissinger's view, took 
place at San Clemente on June 23 and were unscheduled. At

7 
around noon that day, Nixon and Kissinger met with Brezhnev, 
with the Soviet translator the only other person present. 
Brezhnev launched into a tirade about the Chinese, chastising 
their perfidy and moral degeneracy and implying that Mao Zedong 
was insane. He then proposed a secret exchange of views on 
China. Brezhnev said that he did not object to the state of 
U.S.-Chinese relations, but a Sino-American military 
understanding would only confuse world public opinion. Nixon 
was noncommittal on the Chinese, but offered to stay in touch 
through the Kissinger-Dobrynin channel on any subject Brezhnev 
might wish to raise. Nixon turned the conversation to 
Cambodia, arguing that renewed North Vietnamese activity there 
was a threat to world peace. The President chided Brezhnev by 
pointing out that many Americans would believe Soviet arms made 
this threat possible. Brezhnev heatedly denied that any new 
Soviet military equipment had been shipped to the North 
Vietnamese and that the Soviet Government, which desired a 
quick end to the war in Laos and Cambodia, would convey this 
view to Hanoi. The General Secretary suggested that the 
Chinese were responsible for circulating falsehoods about who 
was arming the North Vietnamese and that it was probably the 
Chinese themselves who were supplying the weapons.18 
A few hours later, Gromyko took Kissinger aside and 
expressed concern that Brezhnev had not been explicit enough. 
Gromyko said he wanted to reaffirm unambiguously that any 
military agreement between the United States and China would 
lead to war. Kissinger said that he understood what the 
Foreign Minister was saying, although Kissinger was 
non-committal as to contemplated U.S. actions.18 
The final meeting of the summit occurred at San Clemente 
late in the evening of June 23 at Brezhnev's insistence. At 10 
p.m. the Soviets got Nixon out of bed to meet on an unspecified 
subject in what Kissinger regarded as "a transparent ploy to 
catch Nixon off guard and with luck to separate him from his 
advisers." At the meeting, also attended by Kissinger, 
Dobrynin, Gromyko, and Sukhodrev, Brezhnev proposed that the 
United States and the Soviet Union immediately agree to a 
Middle East settlement based on total Israeli withdrawal to the 
1967 borders in exchange for non-belligerency. A final peace 
treaty would then be worked out between Israel and the 
Palestinians and would be guaranteed by the Soviet Union and 
the United States. According to Kissinger, this was nothing 
more than the standard Arab position, which the United States 
had consistently rejected in the past. Brezhnev said the 
agreement would be secret and confined only to the people in 
the room. He proceeded to threaten the President with a Middle 
Eastern war if Nixon did not accept the Soviet proposal.

Kissinger felt it was an obvious attempt to exploit Nixon's 
Watergate difficulties. After an hour and a half of Brezhnev's 
diatribe, Nixon ended the meeting by stating that the matter 
was not that simple and that the U.S. Government would submit a 
counterdraft to the principles put forward by the Soviet Union 
that spring for resolving the Middle Eastern crisis. The 
following morning, when Brezhnev bade Nixon farewell, he showed 
no signs of the bluster of the previous night. His thanks were 
profuse and he invited the President for another visit to the 
Soviet Union the following year.2? 
A negative result of the summit was the irritation felt by 
some U.S. allies when they learned of the agreement on the 
prevention of nuclear war. Kissinger had kept the British, 
French, and West German Governments informed, but only at the 
very highest level. NATO representatives in Brussels, and 
ambassadors in Washington of Japan, Israel, Egypt, and other 
countries were not notified of the agreement until just before 
it was signed. There ensued a stormy discussion in the NATO 
Council. Even a special meeting between Kissinger and NATO 
representatives at San Clemente at the end of June failed to 
dispel altogether the irritation.21 
Results: Consolidating or Weakening the Relationship  
No one expected the summit to produce "breakthroughs" like 
the arms limitations agreements concluded in Moscow the 
previous year. In a press briefing, Kissinger said the United 
States considered the summit as another step along the road 
toward a "new and more peaceful system" and suggested that 
regular meetings would be a positive development: "as these 
meetings become a regular feature of international life, and as 
we come to take them more and more for granted, the results 
will follow paths that will come to seem more and more natural, 
and we would consider that one of the best signs that a 
peaceful world is coming into being." Nixon felt that the 
various bilateral accords continued the process begun in 1972 
of "building an interlocking web of relationships to increase 
the Soviets' stake in stability and cooperation." The 
President also felt he got to know Brezhnev better. He found 
the General Secretary "more interesting and impressive" than he 
had during the 1972 summit and also felt that Brezhnev had 
gained a far better understanding of the United States and 
American life than he could have from any briefing books.22 
There were doubts, however, about the summit's utility. In 
his memoirs, Kissinger showed little enthusiasm for the 
centerpiece--the agreement on the prevention of nuclear 
war--which he said was "marginally useful." He was not sure

whether it had been worth the effort: "the result was too 
subtle; the negotiation too secret; the effort too protracted; 
the necessary explanation to allies and China too complex to 
have the desired impact." U. Alexis Johnson later wrote that 
"nothing of substance" emerged from the summit. On SALT, the 
only progress was that Brezhnev told Kissinger that he would 
deal with SALT personally and would make a counter-proposal 
through Dobrynin to Kissinger. Perhaps the most that can be 
said is that the second Nixon-Brezhnev summit represented "the 
consolidation of a new phase in the building of a continuing 
relationship of detente between the two "powers."23 
On the other hand, the domestic atmosphere in which the 
summit was held may have weakened detente. In his memoirs, 
Kissinger bemoaned the effect of Watergate on the summit and on 
,the Soviet-American relationship. As a result of the "internal 
disarray" dramatically demonstrated by Watergate, Soviet 
leaders began to conclude that Nixon's problems were 
"terminal". Although this perception probably did not 
encourage Soviet adventurism, it did make Soviet leaders more 
willing to ignore adventures by friendly nations. In this 
sense, the effect of Watergate on the 1973 summit, in 
Kissinger' R view, led directly to the Middle East war later 
that year.44

TOP SECRET/NODIS  
NIXON AND BREZHNEV AT MOSCOW, JUNE 27-JULY 3, 1974 
President Richard Nixon and General Secretary Leonid 
Brezhnev met in Moscow in June 1974 only a few weeks before 
Nixon's resignation, amid growing pressure for his departure 
from office. Because of his lame-duck status, both sides had 
low expectations. The atmosphere was generally harmonious, but 
the substantive achievements were modest. 
The agreements signed at the summit included a protocol to 
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty reducing the 
number of ABM sites allowed each country from two to one and a 
treaty banning underground nuclear testing above a certain size 
or threshold. Most of the agreements had been negotiated in 
advance, but the final details of the threshold test ban, which 
was never ratified by the United States, were negotiated at the 
summit. The two sides were unable to reach an agreement on 
offensive strategic weapons, but Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko agreed 
to explore the possibility of a 10-year time frame for a SALT 
agreement, opening the way for the Vladivostok accord a few 
months later. 
Initiative: Hope of Bolstering Detente  
Brezhnev extended the invitation for Nixon's return visit 
to Moscow during his 1973 visit to the United States, in 
accordance with their earlier agreement that such meetings 
should be held on a regular basis.1 The third summit in 26 
months, it was intended to be part of an ongoing series. The 
Nixon administration expected the annual summit meetings to 
contribute to the detente process by encouraging both sides to 
reach agreements on arms control and bilateral cooperation and 
by providing an opportunity for an exchange of views. They 
offered personal benefits to Nixon and Brezhnev by dramatizing 
detente, with which both were closely associated, as well as by 
enhancing their images as world leaders. 
Detente was increasingly coming under political attack from 
both left and right in the United States. Congressional 
criticism led by Senator Henry Jackson focused on the 1972 
Interim Agreement, which had imposed a 5-year freeze on U.S. 
and Soviet strategic offensive forces, and on repressive Soviet 
domestic policies. A bill to enable the president to extend 
most-favored-nation (MFN) status to the Soviet Union, as 
provided in the U.S.-Soviet trade agreement of 1972, had been

stalled by House amendments barring the extension of MFN status 
or government-guaranteed export credits to any Communist 
country limiting freedom of emigration. These restrictions, 
known collectively as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, threatened 
the economic benefits which the Soviets had anticipated from 
detente. The desire to eliminate these restrictions, which the 
Nixon administration shared with the Soviets, was an important 
consideration on both sides as they planned for the summit. 
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko confirmed 
Brezhnev's invitation during a meeting with'Nixon in Washington 
in February 1974, stating that June would be the most 
convenient time for Nixon's visit. He urged active 
preparations to guarantee results no less positive than those 
of the previous two summits, but neither side insisted that 
plans for the visit should be contingent on the successful 
conclusion of any prior negotiations. In March, the visit was 
scheduled for the last week in June, but it was later postponed 
by 3 days when Nixon decided on a June trip to the Middle 
East. Plans for the summit were announced on May 31.2 
By that time, Nixon's political position was becoming 
increasingly precarious. His release on April 30 of selected 
White House transcripts increased rather than diminished 
pressure for his departure from office, and on May 9, the House 
Judiciary Committee began closed-session impeachment hearings. 
Nevertheless, the Soviets, who were apparently convinced that 
the attacks on Nixon were to some extent veiled attacks on 
detente, made no attempt to put off the visit. They evidently 
hoped to bolster detente and derail the Jackson-Vanik 
amendment. They seem to have anticipated that Nixon would 
survive, although by the time of the summit, even Moscow could 
see that impeachment was possible. If they thought Nixon would 
make one-sided concessions on strategic arms limitations (SALT) 
at the summit in order to reach an agreement, they were 
mistaken; his political weakness left him little room for 
maneuver. 
Preparations: No Agreement on SALT 
Since both Washington and Moscow wanted a successful 
summit, both sides endeavored to work out agreements on arms 
control and other subjects in advance. In his meeting with 
Nixon in February, Gromyko proposed a list of ten topics for 
discussion, including several possible subjects for 
agreements: general U.S.-Soviet relations, SALT, the Middle 
East, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE), mutual and balanced force reductions (MBFR) in Central 
Europe, Indochina, U.S.-Soviet trade relations, a ban on

underground nuclear testing, prohibition of measures hostile to 
the environment, climate, and human health, and new 
arrangements for scientific and technical cooperation. Nixon 
added the subject of cooperation on energy, a western 
preoccupation after the 1973 oil embargo, to the list.3 
The central issue in U.S.-Soviet bilateral relations was, 
of course, SALT. Washington and Moscow had agreed earlier to 
conclude a comprehensive SALT agreement in 1974 to replace the 
Interim Agreement. In the SALT II negotiations in Geneva, the 
Soviets had proposed a continuation of the freeze on strategic 
offensive forces, which would have perpetuated their 40 percent 
advantage in number of missile launchers, while the United 
States had proposed equal numbers of missile launchers, or 
equal aggregates. The two sides had quickly reached an 
impasse, making it evident that a comprehensive agreement could 
not be concluded before the summit. Both sides recognized, 
however, that even a limited SALT accord would bolster detente 
and provide a centerpiece for the summit. The effort to reach 
such an agreement was the major issue in the high-level 
U.S.-Soviet talks in preparation for the summit. 
The administration was divided as to the proper U.S. 
objective in the SALT negotiations. The Pentagon, supported by 
Senator Jackson, wanted an agreement providing for equal 
aggregates and was especially interested in limits on Soviet 
throw weight, in which Moscow had the advantage. Kissinger 
advocated efforts to restrain Soviet use of MIRV technology, in 
which the United States had the lead. To achieve this, he was 
prepared to extend the Interim Agreement, thus balancing the 
Soviet advantage in number of launchers with the U.S. lead in 
MIRVing its missiles. At a March NSC meeting, when Kissinger 
reported an indication that Moscow might accept restrictions on 
MIRVs, Nixon decided to try to obtain such an arrangement at 
the summit but that the U.S. delegation at Geneva should 
continue to work toward a comprehensive agreement. The effort 
to negotiate a summit agreement was thus left in Kissinger's 
hands.4 
Kissinger and Brezhnev laid the groundwork for the summit 
when Kissinger made a 3-day visit to Moscow at the end of 
March. In almost 20 hours of discussions, they covered the 
full range of issues contemplated for the summit, including 
SALT. Brezhnev agreed in principle to a U.S. proposal for a 
three-year extension of the Interim Agreement with limitations 
on MIRVed ICBMs and additional limitations on MIRVed heavy 
ICBMs, but the two sides remained far apart on numbers. 
Kissinger proposed a 5-3 ratio of MIRVed missiles in favor of 
the United States. Brezhnev initially proposed equal numbers 
but after a meeting of the Politburo, he offered 1,100 for the

United States to 1,000 for the Soviets. Although Kissinger 
told him this was unacceptable, the Soviet willingness to 
accept an inferior number of MIRVed missiles suggested that it 
might be possible to reach an agreement.5 
Kissinger was receptive to a Brezhnev proposal to reduce 
the number of ABM sites allowed each country under the 1972 ABM 
Treaty from two to one. While the Interim Agreement had been 
controversial in the United States, the ABM Treaty had won 
almost unanimous Senate approval. The United States had one 
ABM system, protecting the ICBM field at Grand Forks, North 
Dakota, and Congress had rejected an administration request for 
funds to constuct a second system.8 
Although Kissinger turned down a Brezhnev proposal for a 
total ban on underground nuclear testing, which the United 
States had previously rejected because of the difficulty of 
verification, he was interested when Brezhnev suggested a ban 
on testing nuclear devices above a certain size, or threshold. 
Kissinger agreed to explore this possibility but stressed that 
arrangements for verification and for dealing with peaceful 
nuclear explosions (PNEs) would be necessary. He opposed 
including any proviso in such an agreement for other countries 
to adhere to it, thus putting pressure on them to do so, noting 
that it would irritate the French and the Chinese. 7 
Although the discussions were generally friendly and 
businesslike, there were a few exceptions. Brezhnev resorted 
to browbeating tactics during a lengthy session on the Middle 
East. During a discussion of SALT, he raised the subject of 
Nixon's domestic political problems, referring to "all these 
attacks on him." Kissinger reacted promptly to this, declaring 
that his rejection of the Soviet SALT proposal was based on its 
intrinsic nature and not on domestic political difficulties. 
At another point Brezhnev tried to use the summit as leverage 
to press for an early CSCE agreement, but Kissinger replied 
that the visit was in the mutual interest of both countries and 
could not be conditional. Brezhnev did not repeat this ploy, 
and Kissinger concluded from his private exchanges and from the 
treatment of his visit in the Soviet press that Brezhnev's 
interest in a Nixon visit was undiminished.8 
In the next few weeks, U.S.-Soviet negotiations directed at 
possible summit agreements on a variety of subjects got 
underway. Technical talks on artificial heart research, urban 
cooperation and housing technology, and energy were initiated 
by the relevant U.S. agencies and their Soviet counterparts, 
while the Embassy in Moscow discussed a Soviet proposal for a 
new exchange of consulates with the Soviet Foreign Ministry. 
Meanwhile, an interagency working group in Washington examined

TOP SECRET/NODIS  
the possibility of an agreement limiting MIRVs, an ABM 
agreement, and another Brezhnev proposal for denuclearization 
of the Mediterranean.9 
Since Kissinger had moved to the State Department along 
with some of his close associates, the Department's involvement 
in the summit preparations was greater than in 1972 and 1973. 
The key negotiations for a SALT agreement were carried on by 
Kissinger, however; although he was now wearing two hats he 
played much the same role as he had in preparing for the two 
previous summits. He continued to meet regularly with Soviet 
Ambassador Anatoliy F. Dobrynin and intermittently with 
Gromyko. The "channel" had moved to Foggy Bottom. 
In 2 days of talks in Geneva at the end of April, Kissinger 
and Gromyko discussed a U.S. counterproposal on SALT which had 
been sent to Moscow earlier through Dobrynin. It provided for 
an extension of the Interim Agreement until 1980 or 1983, with 
differing MIRV limits for-the United States and for the 
Soviets, the precise figures depending on whether the agreement 
was extended for 6 or 9 years. It also called for an increase 
in the Interim Agreement's limit on U.S. submarine-launched 
ballistic missiles (SLBMs); this was to provide for the 
deployment of the Trident, which would be underway by 1983. 
Gromyko dismissed this as one-sided and argued vigorously 
against the proposed increase in the U.S. limit on SLBMs. 
Kissinger replied that the United States was making a 
considerable concession on MIRVs. Gromyko commented that they 
understood each other very well; the difficulty was not one of 
misunderstanding but of differing approaches.lu 
Kissinger and Gromyko made better progress in discussing 
the proposed ABM and threshold test ban (TTB) agreements. 
Gromyko gave Kissinger a draft ABM agreement limiting both 
sides to one ABM site, but Kissinger told him that since the 
United States would be making a commitment not to defend its 
capital, it would want either a limit on the agreement's 
duration or provision for altering the defended site. He and 
Gromyko agreed to initiate technical discussions on a TTB with 
a view to reaching a summit agreement in principle. Gromyko 
thought this would be acceptable although the Soviets still 
hoped to have a full summit agreement.11 
The possibility of impeachment proceedings was already 
casting a shadow over the Moscow visit. At Geneva, Gromyko 
asked Kissinger about the President's "situation" and raised 
the subject of impeachment. On May 28, Dobrynin delivered a 
personal oral message from Brezhnev to Nixon expressing the 
expectation that their meeting would be an impressive one, with 
agreements on ABM, TTB, and other subjects, and hinting, with

characteristic lack of subtlety, that Nixon might gain domestic 
support through a successful summit. Nixon said Dobrynin 
should tell Brezhnev that domestic politics would not affect 
his trip or U.S.-Soviet relations in any way and not to worry 
about him or his health.12 
Another U.S. proposal on SALT, designed for discussion at 
the summit, was given to Dobrynin on June 7. It called for an 
extension of the Interim Agreement until 1979, with a limit of 
1,150 MIRVed missiles for the United States and 750 for the 
Soviets and a ban on MIRVing heavy ICBMs. The proposal was 
designed to accommodate U.S. programs through 1979 and to hold 
Soviet programs to a minimum, especially to prevent the MIRVing 
of Soviet SS-18 missiles and thus reduce Soviets' throwweight 
advantage. Although the 3-2 ratio was even more favorable to 
the United States than Kissinger's earlier proposals, it was 
veiled by a cosmetic formula designed to make it more palatable 
to Moscow. The Kissinger aides who had developed the proposal 
.hoped it would provide a basis for negotiation at Moscow.13 
As the date of the summit approached, however, the extent 
of disagreement on SALT within the administration came to the 
surface. Nixon's political decline removed inhibitions on the 
Pentagon's opposition to extension of the Interim Agreement and 
aroused fears that he might make a rash SALT agreement at 
Moscow in a last-ditch attempt to ward off impeachment. These 
fears rested in part on the distrust which he and Kissinger had 
engendered over the past few years by holding the SALT 
negotiations so closely in their own hands. Chief of Naval 
Operations Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., wrote later that he 
thought at the time the objective should be "getting the talks 
deadlocked or postponed or adjourned until the U.S. Government 
was in a condition to talk rationally. $114 
Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger wrote to Senator 
Jackson on June 3 backing Jackson's position on SALT, thus, in 
effect, publicly disassociating himself from the 
administration's negotiating position. At an NSC meeting on 
the eve of the summit, he put forward an entirely new proposal 
for an agreement which would have been even more favorable to 
the United States than those Moscow had already rejected. 
Meanwhile, Jackson was holding executive session hearings on 
arms control issues, and Paul Nitze had resigned from the SALT 
Delegation in Geneva with a blast at Nixon. In Kissinger's 
words, Nitze's resignation made it clear that "Nixon had no 
domestic base for any significant agreement in Moscow 
regardless of its content."15 
Technical talks on a possible threshold test ban, which had 
been going on in Moscow for a month, had not produced

agreement. The Soviets were pressing for an annual quota on 
nuclear explosions between an upper and lower threshold, with 
an upper threshold as high as 750 kilotons. The U.S. side 
opposed the idea of a quota and thought such a high limit would 
make an agreement meaningless. Other unresolved issues 
included the problem of closing the PNE loophole and the 
technical data which would be exchanged to assist 
verification. It seemed evident that an agreement in principle 
was the most that could be accomplished at the summit.I6 
A number of agreements were ready for signature, however, 
notably the ABM protocol. The Soviets had accepted the U.S. 
position that each side should have one Opportunity to change 
its choice of ABM site. Agreement on the opening of new 
consulates had been reached when Moscow accepted the U.S. 
preference for Kiev rather than Odessa. Bilateral agreements 
on long-term economic cooperation and for cooperation in the 
fields of energy, housing, and artificial heart research had 
also been reached. Two protocols on procedures for 
implementation of the 1972 SALT agreements, which had been 
negotiated in the U.S.-Soviet Standing Consultative Commission, 
had also been designated for signature at the summit, although 
they were highly technical and would not be made public.17 
While advance preparations for the summit had focused 
primarily on SALT and other areas of possible agreement, the 
Moscow discussions would of course cover a wide range of 
bilateral and international issues. The Trade Reform Bill was 
still before the Senate, and the Jackson-Vanik amendment 
remained an obstacle to passage of the bill in a form which 
would be acceptable to Moscow and to the Nixon administration. 
Kissinger was trying to work out a compromise by obtaining 
Soviet assurances of willingness to permit Jewish emigration 
Which might alleviate congressional concern; he had discussed 
this with Gromyko at Geneva. The status of MFN and credits was 
expected to be high on the Soviet list of items for 
discussion. 18 
Discussion of the Middle East was expected to be a major 
source of contention. Since the October 1973 war, the United 
States had negotiated a series of limited disengagement 
agreements between Egypt and Israel and between Syria and 
Israel. In high-level U.S.-Soviet meetings, the Soviets had 
complained regularly at their exclusion from these negotiations 
and had urged the reconvening of the Geneva Conference. Nixon 
and Kissinger had argued that a step-by-step approach was most 
productive for the time being, but in the hope of preventing 
Soviet obstruction of the peace process, they had indicated 
their willingness to reconvene the Geneva Conference at a later 
date and had reiterated their intention to keep Moscow informed

of developments. Similar discussion was expected at the 
summit.19 
By mid-June, a draft communiqu?overing a full range of 
issues had been negotiated by Department of State Counselor 
Helmut Sonnenfeldt and Soviet Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov. The 
language on offensive arms limitation was left for 
determination at the summit, as were a number of points on 
which the two sides disagreed, including the nuclear test ban, 
Soviet texts on environmental or weather Modification and 
chemical warfare, CSCE, MBFR, the Middle East, and 
Indochina.20 
Surveying the Moscow scene 3 weeks before Nixon's visit, 
Ambassador Walter J. Stoessel concluded that the Soviet 
leadership remained committed to detente and viewed the 
upcoming summit as an important step toward solidifying 
U.S.-Soviet relations. All indications were that the 
atmosphere would be significantly warmer than in Nixon's 1972 
visit. The agreements already reached provided at least a 
minimal base of achievement to show at the summit, and Soviet 
negotiating tactics in achieving them had seemed to reflect a 
desire to signal forthrightness and good will. Nonetheless, 
although the Soviets still seemed interested in making a 
breakthrough in SALT or a test ban, Stoessel thought they would 
pursue those negotiations on their own merit and that they were 
realistic about the concrete steps which might be possible. If 
necessary, he thought, they would settle for a summit dominated 
by atmospherics. They wanted the symbolism of the summit to 
show an upward progression of U.S.-Soviet relations and to show 
continuity regardless of circumstances.21 
Ambassador Dobrynin might have made similar comments about 
U.S. objectives and expectations as the summit approached. The 
Nixon administration had invested considerable effort to 
achieve agreements for signature at the summit but was in no 
position to make significant concessions on SALT. Under the 
circumstances, both sides were prepared to settle for symbolism 
and atmospherics. 
Discussions: Harmony for Its Own Sake  
Nixon arrived in Moscow on June 27 following a 2-day 
meeting with NATO leaders in Brussels. He was suffering from 
phlebitis, but it apparently did not inhibit his activities 
during the visit. After 2 days in Moscow, the Presidential 
party flew to the Crimea to spend 2 days at Brezhnev's villa in 
Oreanda, a suburb of Yalta. The White House had been reluctant 
to accept the Yalta site because of its associations but had

finally acceded to Brezhnev's desire to entertain Nixon at his 
"Casa Pacifica". On July 1, Nixon and Mrs. Nixon flew to Minsk 
for a ceremonial visit, while Kissinger held further talks with 
Gromyko in Moscow. Back in Moscow the next day, Nixon attended 
the final plenary meetings, made a radio and television address 
to the Soviet people, and hosted a farewell dinner at Spaso 
House. He left Moscow on July 3.22 
During Nixon's week in the Soviet Union, he and Brezhnev 
spent between 8 to 10 hours in plenary sessions and met 
privately on several occasions. The plenary discussions 
covered a wide range of issues but reached few conclusions. 
Those attending included Soviet President Nikolai V. Podgorny, 
Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin, Gromyko, Dobrynin, Kissinger, 
Stoessel, and several aides on both sides. Brezhnev took the 
lead on the Soviet side, but Kosygin and Podgorny participated 
occasionally in the discussion. Brezhnev's interpreter Viktor 
M. Sukhodrev interpreted. Detailed negotiations on SALT, the 
test ban treaty, and the communique took place in separate 
sessions between Kissinger and Gromyko. 
The Soviets evidently had decided, as Stoessel had 
predicted, to scale down their expectations and settle for a 
summit dominated by atmospherics. The mood was generally 
congenial. There was no recurrance of the meetings at odd 
hours and attempted browbeating that had characterized the 
first two Nixon-Brezhnev summits. Since it was apparent that 
no major breakthrough was possible, Kissinger later observed, 
"the appearance of harmony became its own objective."23 
The opening plenary session on June 28 dealt in 
generalities. Both Nixon and Brezhnev made ritual statements 
praising detente, stating their determination to make it 
irreversible, and declaring the value of regular summit 
meetings in contributing to detente. Brezhnev welcomed Nixon's 
invitation to visit the United States in 1975 but suggested 
that they might have separate, briefer meetings, dealing with 
only one or two issues. While Nixon stressed the importance of 
his personal relationship with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader was 
probably thinking of meeting Nixon's successor.24 
At the afternoon session, Nixon and Brezhnev focused on the 
question of a nuclear test ban. The discussion took an 
unexpected turn when Brezhnev and Kosygin revived the old 
Soviet proposal for a comprehensive test ban, which had not 
been discussed since Brezhnev's March proposal of a threshold 
test ban. Nixon, revealing his own preoccupations, related the 
issue to domestic attacks on detente and portrayed himself as 
uniquely able to win the American public's support for

Kissinger and Gromyko, who met the following morning and agreed 
to draft a protocol agreeing in principle to negotiate a ban on 
underground testing above a specified threshold. This was what 
the American side had anticipated.25 
At the plenary session the next morning, Nixon and Brezhnev 
agreed to a threshold test ban with a threshold of 150 
kilotons. Brezhnev made one more effort at a comprehensive 
test ban, urging that they should set a time limit for reaching 
such an agreement, but Nixon rejected this also. Brezhnev then 
suggested that they could resolve the problem of PNEs by 
inviting observers to witness peaceful explosions. When 
Kissinger expressed interest in this unprecedented offer, 
Brezhnev declared that after all it would be possible to reach 
an agreement. Kissinger questioned whether it would be 
possible to work out all the details in time to sign an 
agreement at the summit; from the U.S. perspective, the 
technical details on verification were of critical importance. 
At this point, Kosygin appealed blatantly to Nixon's political 
needs, declaring that an agreement would give him "a very 
strong position in public-opinion." Nixon agreed that the 
technical experts should make another effort to resolve the 
outstanding issues.26 
After receiving Brezhnev's blessing, the Soviet technical 
experts became more forthcoming, and when Kissinger and Gromyko 
returned from the Crimea, they resolved the remaining issues 
and completed a draft treaty. Kissinger rejected a Soviet 
proposal for an accession clause, which would have put implicit 
pressure on China, and Gromyko did not press the point. The 
major problem was to eliminate the PNE loophole. In spite of 
Brezhnev's offer of on-site inspection, a detailed agreement of 
this nature could not be reached at the summit. Kissinger 
pressed for a moratorium on PNEs above the threshold level 
until the two sides concluded a PNE agreement on PNEs. When 
Gromyko resisted including this in the treaty, Kissinger agreed 
to leave it out but told Gromyko the United States would not 
ratify the treaty until the two sides concluded a PNE 
agreement.27 
Nixon and Brezhnev did not discuss the key issue of SALT 
until 3 days into the summit, reflecting the recognition on 
both sides that there was little chance of reaching agreement. 
When they raised the issue at a plenary meeting on June 30 at 
Oreanda, Kissinger presented the proposal given to Dobrynin on 
June 7 for an extension of the Interim Agreement until 1979, 
with limits of 1,150 MIRVed missiles for the United States and 
750 for the Soviet Union and a ban on MIRVing heavy ICBMs. 
Rejecting this, Brezhnev repeated his March counterproposal for 
limits of 1,100 MIRVed missiles for the United States and 1,000 
for the Soviets.28

Brezhnev reiterated the standard Soviet argument against 
U.S. forward-based systems (FBS) and argued that the United 
States had the advantage in number of warheads. Assisted by 
two Soviet generals, he made a detailed presentation (which he 
had made with Kissinger in March) purporting to show a U.S. 
first-strike potential of 16,000 warheads, 4,000 more than the 
Soviets had. The figure was based on "unrealistic 
assumptions," Kissinger told Brezhnev the next day.29 It was 
"exaggerated but not totally absurd," he told British Foreign 
Secretary James Callaghan when he briefed him on the summit a 
few days later, a "worst-case analysis" from the perspective of 
the Soviet military. Kissinger told Callaghan he thought 
Brezhnev was under pressure from the Soviet military, as shown 
by the assertiveness of the two generals who "jumped up all the 
time" to point things out to him.30 
" Nixon and Brezhnev later agreed that Kissinger and Gromyko 
should make another attempt at reaching agreement while Nixon 
made his ceremonial visit to Minsk. Brezhnev and Dmitri F. 
Ustinov, a Politburo member with responsibility for defense 
industries, met briefly with Kissinger on their return to 
Moscow. Kissinger made it plain that there was no flexibility 
in the U.S. negotiating position. Even an agreement with the 
figures Nixon had offered would "produce an explosion" in the 
U.S., he told Brezhnev.31 At a Politburo meeting that 
afternoon, the Soviets apparently decided to abandon any 
attempt to reach an agreement. When Kissinger and Gromyko met 
in a small, restricted session that evening, they quickly 
reached an impasse. Gromyko told Kissinger that Moscow could 
not accept an agreement which was not based on the principle of 
equality; the U.S. figures were "so unrealistic", he said, and 
the proposed ban on heavy missiles was "not for serious 
discussion. "32 
Since the appearance of a successful summit was important 
to both Washington and Moscow, however, both sides wanted the 
communique to indicate progress on SALT. Kissinger suggested 
they might be able to find a different basis for agreement if 
the arrangement covered a longer period of time, and Gromyko 
seized upon this concept, suggesting a 10-year agreement. The 
idea was apparently discussed and approved at a Politburo 
meeting the next morning. Gromyko and Kissinger subsequently 
drafted language for the communique stating that the Interim 
Agreement should be followed by a new agreement covering the 
period until 1985 and that it should include both quantitative 
and qualitative limitations, i.e., that it should include 
restrictions on MIRVs.33 
The plenary discussions of CSCE and the Middle East were 
predictable but without acrimony. Brezhnev complained about

European demands in the CSCE and urged U.S.-Soviet cooperation 
to achieve an early agreement to be signed at the summit 
level. Nixon agreed that U.S. and Soviet experts could get 
together and discuss some of the problems, but he pointed out 
that Washington could not dictate to its European allies and 
that it was necessary to consider their sensitivities. 
Discussion of the Middle East was desultory. Brezhnev stressed 
the Soviet interest in reconvening the Geneva Conference and 
desire for consultations but made no effort to pressure Nixon 
as he had done with Kissinger in March and with Nixon at San 
Clemente a year earlier.34 
Other subjects received little attention in the formal 
sessions. Nixon renewed his earlier commitment to obtain 
congressional approval of MFN and credits, but Brezhnev touched 
only indirectly on Soviet concern with the issue. He renewed a 
proposal he had made to Kissinger in March for a joint ban on 
nuclear weapons in the Mediterranean, but when Nixon 
predictably rejected it, he did not try to press the issue. 
Nixon urged that both sides exercise restraint in supplying 
arms to their allies in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. He 
touched on U.S. concern for progress in the MBFR talks but 
neither he nor Brezhnev pursued this subject.35 
Nixon and Brezhnev had two private meetings in Moscow and a 
lengthy private conversation at Brezhnevis cabana overlooking 
the Black Sea at Oreanda. Sukhodrev was the only other person 
present during these discussions. In addition, they had 
informal conversations on the plane to the Crimea, in the car 
during the 64-mile drive between Oreanda and the airport, and 
during a 2-hour cruise in Brezhnev's yacht on the Black Sea. 
According to Nixon's memoirs, his private talks with Brezhnev 
were warmer and more cordial than the formal sessions. They 
touched on a variety of issues but generally eschewed 
substantive negotiations. Nixon raised the problem of Soviet 
restrictions on Jewish emigration, a sensitive subject for 
Moscow, in a private conversation rather than in a formal 
meeting, urging Brezhnev to make a gesture, if only to pull the 
rug out from Jackson.36 
During Nixon's and Brezhnevis private meeting in Oreanda, 
the Soviet leader made a proposal which was similar to but went 
even further than his 1972 proposal for a U.S.-Soviet agreement 
abjuring the use of nuclear weapons. No record of the Oreanda 
conversation is available except sketchy accounts in the Nixon 
and Kissinger memoirs, but Brezhnev repeated the proposal to 
Kissinger a few months later, describing it as a personal idea 
which he had not discussed with anyone else. He proposed a 
U.S.-Soviet agreement that in the event of a nuclear attack on 
either of them or on their allies, they would come to each

other's assistance. Such an agreement would have been 
obviously directed at China. Discussing it with Kissinger in 
October, Brezhnev commented, "So far the only nuclear powers 
are you us, your allies, and China, and who knows whose ally 
it is?"37 
Brezhnev's purpose in making the proposal may have been to 
probe the U.S. reaction to the possibility of a Sino-Soviet 
conflict or perhaps a Soviet preemptive strike on China. 
Although China was not discussed at the formal meetings in 
Moscow, and Brezhnev affected unconcern during his conversation 
with Nixon at Oreanda, Gromyko and Defense Minister Andrey A. 
Grechko both warned against China in social Conversations 
during the summit. Beijing was following a firmly anti-Soviet 
policy, having rejected Soviet overtures for a non-aggression 
pact and a compromise on border issues the previous year, while 
Sino-American relations continued to improve. Although the 
Chinese political scene was exceptionally murky in 1974, 
neither of the two contending factions showed any interest in 
improving relations with Moscow.38 
Nixon apparently responded to Brezhnev's proposition with 
delaying tactics. Brezhnev told Kissinger that Nixon had 
indicated he considered the proposal a very interesting idea 
and would give Brezhnev a reply in a couple of months. In his 
memoirs, Kissinger says Nixon described the proposal to him in 
Sukhodrev's hearing and instructed him to pursue the idea for 
inclusion on the agenda at a possible mini-summit later in the 
year. Although Kissinger writes that he entertained suspicions 
of Nixon's purposes at the time, Nixon could hardly have agreed 
to such an arrangement and probably thought he and Kissinger 
could transform it during subsequent negotiations as they had 
done with the 1972 proposal. Nonetheless, Brezhnev was 
apparently sufficiently encouraged to renew the proposal after 
Nixon had resigned and Gerald Ford had assumed the 
Presidency.38 
Results: Keeping Detente Alive  
Although both Nixon and Brezhnev acknowledged 
disappointment that the summit had produced no agreement 
limiting offensive arms, they put the best face on it, 
declaring it a success and an important contribution to 
U.S.-Soviet relations. Nixon declared that the growing network 
of agreements was "creating new habits of cooperation" and that 
it gave the Soviets "a positive stake in peace." Moscow 
endorsed the summit unequivocally as a "major milestone" in 
U.S.-Soviet relations, suggesting that Brezhnev remained 
personally committed to detente and still hoped to give the 
process new momentum.40

The more skeptical treatment of the summit in the U.S. 
press reflected widespread cynicism about Nixon's motives as 
well as recognition of the limited nature of the summit 
agreements. Soviet detention of Jewish activists on the eve of 
Nixon's visit and censorship of American television news 
reports on Soviet dissidents during the visit contributed to a 
sour U.S. view of the proceedings. The Gallup Poll found that 
Nixon's public standing had declined after the Moscow trip, in 
contrast with the usual rise in a President's standing after 
foreign trave1.41 
Nixon's resignation and Ford's assumption of the Presidency 
on August 9 made the Nixon-Brezhnev discussions at Moscow seem 
irrelevant. Nevertheless, the tone set at the summit made it 
clear that both sides were anxious to pursue detente and made 
the transition from Nixon to Ford an easy one. The Moscow 
discussions on SALT bore fruit a few months later at 
Vladivostok when Ford and Brezhnev had the brief summit meeting 
that Nixon and Brezhnev had discussed tentatively at Moscow. 
The idea of a 10-year time frame which Kissinger and Gromyko 
had settled on provided a basis for more productive 
negotiations, leading to the Vladivostok accord and, 
eventually, to the SALT II agreement. 
The TTB treaty has not been ratified, although the PNE 
loophole was closed by a U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in May 1976, 
which banned PNEs over 150 kilotons and provided for on-site 
inspection. Neither treaty has received Senate approval, in 
part because of doubts about the verification procedures in the 
TTB treaty and in part because Ford's successor Jimmy Carter 
gave priority to the pursuit of a comprehensive test ban.42

FORD AND BREZHNEV AT VLADIVOSTOK, NOVEMBER 23-24, 1974 
The Vladivostok meeting between President Gerald R. Ford 
and Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev took place only 5 months 
after the Moscow summit, primarily because Brezhnev was eager 
to establish contact with the new U.S. President. The summit 
was more ad hoc than the three previous ones and focused almost 
entirely on FEW strategic arms limitations talks (SALT). The 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in-Europe (CSCE), 
Cyprus, and the Middle East were dealt with briefly but nothing 
of substance on any of these issues was achieved. Mutual and 
balanced force reduction (MBFR) was mentioned only in the 
prenegotiated joint communiqu?Due in part to the groundwork 
laid by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger during his 
October trip to Moscow and to Soviet hopes of establishing a 
constructive relationship with the new U.S. President, a 
breakthrough on SALT did take place at Vladivostok. The two 
sides reached agreement in principle and the resulting SALT 
accord provided the basis for the SALT II treaty signed by 
President Jimmy Carter and Brezhnev in Vienna in June 1979. It 
met the demands of the U.S. Congress and the Defense Department 
for equal aggregates and involved significant Soviet 
concessions, including abandonment of their previous demand 
that Forward Based Systems (FBS), such as U.S. weapons based in 
Western Europe, had to be included in the U.S. total. Ford and 
Kissinger returned home feeling triumphant and claiming that 
they had put a cap on the arms race. Their hopes were dashed, 
however, by the subsequent inability of the two sides to agree 
upon whether such weapons as the Soviet Backfire bomber and 
U.S. cruise missiles were to be included in the totals agreed 
upon at Vladivostok. 
Initiative: Sizing Up a New President  
In early August, following President Richard Nixon's 
resignation, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the new 
U.S. President, Gerald Ford, immediately sent letters to their 
Soviet counterparts pledging that U.S. policy toward the Soviet 
Union would continue unchanged under the new administration. 
Ford also assured Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev that the 
channels of communication established under Nixon remained open 
and reaffirmed the former President's invitation to the General 
Secretary to visit the United States the following year.

Kissinger, for his part, urged that there be no loss of 
momentum in the negotiations on SALT, CSCE, and MBFR and 
indicated his intention to return to Moscow for further 
negotiations that fal1.1 
Brezhnev's reply suggested that "a working meeting" between 
the two heads of state before the end of the year, perhaps on 
neutral ground, would help detente, adding that experience had 
shown how useful and valuable such personal contacts were. 
During their June discussions in Moscow, Brezhnev and Nixon had 
talked about holding an interim summit before the Soviet 
leader's scheduled visit to the United States in 1975. 
Moreover, as Kissinger subsequently pointed out to the 
President, Brezhnev's emphasis on the continuation of personal 
contact also reflected the Soviet leader's own personal stake 
in, detente.2 
In advice to Ford at this time, and before the President 
met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko in 
mid-September, Kissinger indicated his support for an interim 
"working" summit if there was concrete business for the two 
leaders to negotiate. Kissinger wished to use the Soviet 
desire for a summit as a lever to gain Soviet concessions on 
several outstanding issues.3 
Ford's agreement to attend a summit meeting at Vladivostok 
in November, however, was conveyed to the Soviet Union without 
prior Soviet concessions or assurances that the meeting would 
produce concrete results. On September 20, Ford and Kissinger 
discussed the Vladivostok meeting with Gromyko. The three 
agreed on the importance of making progress on SALT during 
Kissinger's visit to Moscow in October, so that Ford and 
Brezhnev could announce "agreement in principle" at Vladivostok 
and conclude a SALT agreement when Brezhnev visited the United 
States the following June.4 
The forthcoming summit meeting at Vladivostok was announced 
publicly on October 26, Kissinger's last day in Moscow. The 
British, French, and West German Foreign Offices, notified 6 
hours before the public announcement, were told that Washington 
did not expect any major announcement to result from the 
summit, which was for the purpose of getting acquainted.5 
Preparations: Coming Closer Together on SALT  
U.S. preparations for the Vladivostok summit between 
September 20 and November 23 focused primarily on SALT. In 
? briefing the new President following Nixon's resignation, 
Kissinger warned Ford that a breakdown in SALT would jeopardize 
detente and the entire range of U.S.-Soviet relations. He also

argued that it was misleading to talk about strategic 
superiority, pointing out that, according to U.S. intelligence 
projections, at the end of an unrestricted arms race with the 
Soviet Union both sides would still be essentially in strategic 
equilibrium. Such an arms race, according to Kissinger, would 
also mean greatly increased U.S. defense expenditures. The 
Secretary projected that the Soviets would be more inclined to 
make concessions now than the previous June, when they were 
focusing on Nixon's precarious political position. Kissinger, 
who knew how deep divisions within the U.S. Government had 
hindered previous SALT negotiations, advised that a new SALT 
proposal should be sent directly to Brezhnev'to circumvent the 
Soviet bureaucracy.8 
During the September meeting with Gromyko, Ford warned the 
Soviet Foreign Minister that lack of progress on SALT would 
affect the military budget request he would submit in December 
and noted the desirability of concluding an agreement before 
the 1976 election. Gromyko responded that his government 
wanted to find a solution and was prepared to discuss all of 
this in detail when Kissinger came to Moscow.7 
On October 9, Kissinger gave Soviet Ambassador to the 
United States Anatoliy F. Dobrynin the new U.S. SALT proposal 
for discussion during the Secretary's visit to Moscow. This 
proposal was based on equal aggregates, equality in the total 
number of strategic missile launchers possessed by each side, 
as the Defense Department and Congress insisted. It called for 
a phased reduction in the total number of strategic launchers 
-- ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles), SLBMs 
(submarine launched ballistic missiles), and heavy bombers. 
The numerical limits of the 1972 SALT agreement would remain in 
effect until October 1977. Beginning in October 1977, each 
side would agree to reduce its total number of launchers to no 
more than 2,350 by 1982 and to 2,200 by the end of 1983. 
Before 1982, the total number of such launchers could not 
exceed 2,500 with a sublimit of 300 for modern large ICBMs; by 
the end of 1983, the sublimit would be 250 for heavy systems 
including both heavy missiles and heavy bombers. There would 
also be a limit of 1,320 ICBMs and SLBMs with MIRVs (multiple 
independently targetable reentry vehicles). The total 
deployment of new strategic launchers, including replacement or 
modernization, would be limited to 175 in any 1 year. Finally, 
as in the 1972 SALT agreement, building new ICBM silos would be 
prohibited .8 
On October 24, Kissinger arrived in Moscow for 3 days of 
pre-Vladivostok negotiations with Brezhnev which were the most 
important preparations made for the summit. The first day was 
devoted primarily to Soviet complaints about U.S. trade

restrictions and U.S. policy towards CSCE and the Middle East. 
No solutions were reached but, while defending U.S. policy, 
Kissinger's tone was reassuring throughout.9 
The next 2 days of discussions were devoted almost 
exclusively to SALT. During these meetings, Kissinger painted 
a bleak picture of a period of unrestrained U.S.-Soviet 
competition in strategic arms, arguing that at the end of such 
a race neither side would be decisively ahead. He pointed out 
that the design of Soviet strategic forces was such that, 
whatever Soviet intentions, they represented a very grave 
threat to U.S. land-based forces and that the United States was 
prepared to do whatever was necessary for its own defense. 
After discussing the U.S. proposal of October 9, Brezhnev 
offered a Soviet counterproposal that the upper limit on 
strategic launchers be 2,000 for the United States and 2,400 
for the Soviet Union. In addition, Gromyko insisted that the 
Soviet Union had to be compensated in these totals for Forward 
Based Systems (FBS) and for British and French nuclear 
weapons. Kissinger responded that it would be quite impossible 
for the United States to agree to such an inequality in total 
numbers with no inequality in its favor in other areas such as 
MIRVs. He suggested that the United States might be willing to 
agree not to go above 2,200, although it had to have the right 
to do so. Kissinger also reminded Brezhnev that the United 
States would have twice as many warheads on one Trident 
submarine as the combined total of British and French 
warheads. He warned that the United States would not make a 
more forthcoming proposal and added that there would be serious 
consequences in the United States if the U.S. press saw this 
trip as a failure.10 
The next day, Brezhnev proposed a total of 2,200 strategic 
launchers for the United States and 2,400 for the Soviet Union 
by the end of 1985. Kissinger was able to extract agreement 
that the 2,200 figure would include only U.S. launchers and not 
those of its Allies. Brezhnev also proposed that the United 
States be limited to 10 Trident submarines between 1977 and 
1985, with the Soviet Union limited to 10 of the Typhoon 
class. Brezhnev accepted the U.S. proposal that the 
prohibition on building new silos continue, although both sides 
would be free to modernize and improve existing ones. He also 
accepted the proposed limit of 1,320 MIRVs. Brezhnev insisted, 
however, that the missiles carried by the proposed U.S. 8-1 
bomber should have a range of no more than 3,000 kilometers and 
that each missile be included in the U.S. total. Kissinger 
told Brezhnev that this counterproposal provided a serious 
basis for discussion but that it would receive a most 
unfavorable reception if given to the U.S. bureaucracy in its

current form. He suggested that points be clarified in private 
meetings between himself and Dobrynin and that discussions be 
kept entirely in this channel until after Vladivostok. 
Brezhnev agreed, on the condition that there would be no 
fundamentally new proposals, adding that he did not want his 
first meeting with the President to begin with a dispute. 
Kissinger promised that there would be no surprises at 
Vladivostok and that he would do his utmost to make the summit 
meeting a success.11 
On his last day in Moscow, Kissinger met .privately with 
Brezhnev, with only State Department Counselor Helmut 
Sonnenfeldt, Gromyko, and an interpreter present. Brezhnev 
restated a proposal, made secretly to Nixon in June, that each 
side pledge that in the event of a nuclear attack on either or 
on the allies of either by any third power it would use 
military power in support of the other. Brezhnev added that 
they could even name the third power -- an obvious reference to 
China. Kissinger's response was noncommittal. He promised to 
discuss this with Ford, but also pointed out that such a 
proposal did not make sense if the arms race continued.12 
On November 13, Kissinger advised Ford that the Soviet 
counterproposal, received in written form on November 8, 
provided a basis for constructive negotiations at Vladivostok. 
He urged Ford to insist upon equal aggregates for political 
reasons, even though the United States would not even be able 
to reach the 2,200 level without retaining obsolete systems. 
He also argued that they should accept no limit on 
bomber-launched missiles without a corresponding Soviet 
concession. Kissinger suggested a U.S. counterproposal with a 
limit of 2,400 on total launchers and 1,320 on MIRVed missiles 
for the last 2 years of the agreement (1984-1985), with the 
United States agreeing to stay 200 below the launcher limit 
(2,200) through 1983 and the Soviets agreeing to stay 200 below 
the MIRV limit (1,120) during this same period. He also 
proposed a sublimit of 250 new strategic bombers, 312 new SLBMs 
on Trident-type submarines (13 ships), and 180 new heavy 
ICBMs. This would simplify the proposal by eliminating all 
reference to heavy MIRVs or bomber armaments. Kissinger warned 
Ford that time would be short at Vladivostok and advised that 
he not get bogged down in details but concentrate on getting 
agreement on basic numbers. Ford approved the proposal and 
Kissinger presented it to Dobrynin the same day. li 
The following day Kissinger sent Ford, who was due to leave 
for the Far East on November 17, a briefing book for 
Vladivostok containing comprehensive background material on 
major U.S.-Soviet issues which might be raised during the 
summit. He also forwarded a 25-page memorandum which briefed

the President on Brezhnev's personality and policies and then 
laid out the major U.S. objectives for the summit. Kissinger 
pointed out that, since the Soviet leader had sought this 
meeting, much of the burden for its success would be on him. 
The Secretary added, however, that Soviet internal political 
considerations might limit Brezhnev's ability to bargain and he 
might not be able to pay too high a price for a SALT agreement. 
Kissinger emphasized that the main objective at Vladivostok, 
besides establishing a personal relationship with Brezhnev, was 
to obtain a SALT agreement, publicly signed by the two leaders, 
which would settle the question of limits on .strategic 
launchers and MIRVs and, if possible, set sublimits on new 
SLBMs on Trident-type submarines, new bombers, and new heavy 
ICBMs. 
, After noting that there was no set agenda for the 
Vladivostok talks, Kissinger's memorandum summarized the other 
major issues which might arise during the summit. On the 
Middle East, he advised that the President appear willing to 
consult more frequently with the Soviets and to reconvene the 
Geneva Conference, without making any actual commitment. The 
memorandum then reviewed some of the CSCE disputes and proposed 
that the President promise to work for conclusion of the 
Conference by the spring of 1975. The memorandum cautioned 
Ford not to offer or agree to any specific MBFR proposals at 
Vladivostok because the United States had not worked out such 
proposals with its Allies. The paper also discussed several 
other issues, including Peaceful Nuclear Explosions, 
Environmental and Chemical Warfare, and various bilateral 
economic issues. On the latter, it was suggested that the 
President tell Brezhnev of his hope that passage of the Trade 
Bill would lead to increased U.S.-Soviet trade. Ford was also 
to point out that the administration had been forced to accept 
the Jackson-Vanik amendment to attain most-favored-nation 
?status for the Soviet Union.14 
In the meantime, the State Department and the Soviet 
Embassy negotiated the wording of the joint communique to be 
issued on the last day of the summit. Kissinger's briefing 
memorandum had explained that the Vladivostok communique would 
be more general than those for previous summits, unless there 
was agreement on SALT. The draft communique, agreed to prior 
to the summit, reflected the limited anticipations of the two 
sides. It anticipated no new development on any issue, with 
the exception of SALT, which was not covered in the presummit 
draft. Only the Soviet wording on the Cyprus question, which 
called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the 
island, caused any controversy and this phrase was omitted from 
the final communique.15

Discussions: A Significant Breakthrough  
On November 23, Ford and Kissinger flew from South Korea 
via Tokyo to Vozdvizhenka airport near Vladivostok, where they 
met Brezhnev and Gromyko who had come more than 4,000 miles 
from Moscow by train. In contrast to the previous 
Nixon-Brezhnev summits, there was little pomp or ceremony at 
Vladivostok -- partly because of the brevity of the summit and 
partly because of its location. During the 2-day summit, Ford 
and Brezhnev spent almost 12 hours in face-to-face 
discussions. During the evening discussions 'at the Okeanskaya 
sanatorium on the first day, the two delegations were 
relatively large. Ford and Kissinger were accompanied by U.S. 
Ambassador to the Soviet Union Walter J. Stoessel and 
Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft, Deputy Assistant to the 
President for National Security Affairs, as well as three State 
Department aides. The Soviet Delegation was somewhat larger 
(11 in all) and included not only Gromyko, Dobrynin, and the 
Soviet interpreter Viktor Sukhodrev but also representatives 
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the General Staff, and 
the Central Committee of the Communist Party. On the morning 
of the second day, Ford, Kissinger, and a Russian-speaking 
State Department aide, Alexander Akalovsky, met alone with 
Brezhnev, Gromyko, Dobrynin, and the Soviet interpreter. They 
were joined by other members of the U.S. Delegation during the 
afternoon session. 
The initial conversations took place during the 1 1/2 hour 
train ride from the airport to the Okeanskaya Sanatorium, a 
health resort on the outskirts of Vladivostok. After initial 
friendly banter, the two sides agreed on the order of 
discussions: first SALT and then the Middle East. Ford 
emphasized the importance of reaching agreement on SALT during 
1975 so that it would not become an issue in the 1976 election 
and warned that if another candidate were elected the policy of 
detente might be undercut.16 
The first session at the Okeanskaya Sanatorium began at 
6:15 that evening and lasted until 12:30 a.m. During this 
session, which was so productive that the dinner originally 
scheduled was cancelled, Brezhnev and Gromyko complained that 
the U.S. position, as reflected in its latest proposal, had 
stiffened since Kissinger had been in Moscow. Ford replied 
that Congress and the American people would not accept an 
agreement with unequal numbers and noted that he had deferred 
his decision on the defense budget until after the summit. 
Kissinger pointed out that without an agreement, the United 
States could continue to MIRV its missiles indefintely. After 
some haggling over Trident submarines, Brezhnev and Ford agreed 
that no new silos should be built and that only new ICBMs which 
fit into existing silos would be permitted.

After a break, Brezhnev repeated his Moscow proposal that 
each side be allowed to build 2,400 strategic launchers by 
1985, but that the President give the Soviets a letter 
promising that the United States would actually only build 
2,200 during that period. Ford and Kissinger repeated that the 
American people would not accept less than numerical 
equivalence and argued that their proposal, which offered 
offsetting inequalities through 1983 and then equivalence in 
both launchers and MIRVs by 1985, was one the U.S. Congress and 
American people would accept. Kissinger also pointed out that 
the United States would only be able to reach this figure by 
keeping some obsolete systems and reminded Brezhnev that a 
Presidential letter would not be binding on Ford's successors. 
When Brezhnev and Gromyko complained about U.S. FBS, Ford 
stated that it was his understanding that they had agreed at 
Moscow not to include FBS in a SALT agreement. Nevertheless, 
he offered to give up the U.S. nuclear submarine base in Rota, 
Spain in 1984. 
After leaving the room to consult his colleagues in Moscow, 
Brezhenv returned and suggested to Ford that they agree in 
principle upon 2,400 launchers and 1,320 MIRVs for each side 
and that these ceilings could be reached at any time before 
1985, thus dropping the interim (1977-1983) period. He pointed 
out that this meant that the President could tell the American 
people he had reached an agreement on the basis of full 
equality for both sides. Kissinger then reminded Brezhnev that 
the United States had also proposed limiting strategic bombers 
such as the B-1, Trident-type submarines, and MIRVed heavy 
missiles. After some further haggling, the two sides agreed to 
resume discussion of sublimits in the morning.17 
The second day of negotiations began at Okeanskaya 
Sanatorium at 10:10 a.m. and lasted nearly 6 hours. Ford began 
the discussion of sublimits by offering to count any 
aircraft-carried ballistic missile with a range over 700 
kilometers as part of the 2,400 aggregate, i.e., as one 
launcher. Brezhnev countered that each bomber carrying 
missiles with a range of up to 600 kilometers should be counted 
as one launcher, that those carrying missiles with a range from 
600 to 3,000 kilometers should be counted according to the 
number of missiles they carried and that all bomber-carried 
missiles with a range of over 3,000 kilometers should be 
banned. Ford expressed serious objections to the last 
restriction but suggested that, if it were accepted, the Soviet 
Union should accept a limit of 200 on its MIRVed heavy missiles. 
After leaving the room for consultations, Brezhnev returned 
and proposed that bomber-carried missiles with a range 
exceeding 600 kilometers count as individual launchers, but

that there be no limit on their maximum range nor any 
restrictions on heavy MIRVed missiles. Ford and Kissinger 
consented to this and the Vladivostok "agreement in principle" 
on SALT was complete. It was agreed that the U.S. and Soviet 
SALT Delegations, which had been negotiating in Geneva, should 
work out the details and that Kissinger would iron out any 
further difficulties when he returned to the Soviet Union in 
the spring. The final SALT II Treaty could then be signed when 
Brezhnev came to the United States in the summer of 1975. The 
two sides decided to issue a separate statement on SALT in 
addition to the joint communiqu?explaining that equivalence 
had been reached but without revealing the figures until the 
President had a chance to brief congressional leaders. 
While Brezhnev and Ford left the room, Kissinger and 
Gromyko, agreeing that the two leaders would not have time to 
discuss Cyprus, settled the dispute over the wording on this 
item in the previously negotiated joint communiqu?After 
their return, Brezhnev and Ford held a secret meeting, attended 
only by Kissinger and Scowcroft on the U.S. side and Gromyko, 
Dobrynin, and A.M. Aleksandrov, Brezhnev's Special Assistant, 
on the Soviet side. No record of this meeting has been found. 
When the full conference reconvened, discussions turned to 
the Middle East. Brezhnev talked about the need for 
U.S.-Soviet cooperation and argued that a solution could be 
found at a reconvened Geneva Conference, adding that the 
fundamental issue was Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories. Ford responded that he agreed that there should 
be U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the Middle East but that the 
groundwork had to be laid before the Geneva Conference met. He 
suggested, and Brezhnev agreed, that Kissinger and Dobrynin 
should exchange ideas as to how to prevent another Middle East 
war. 
The final portion of the summit dealt with CSCE and, very 
briefly, the Trade Bill. On CSCE, Ford agreed upon March or 
April as a tentative date for the final stage of the Conference 
and promised to urge the French and Germans to move on some of 
the disputed issues. Ford then pointed out that his 
administration had strongly supported the Trade Bill and 
declared that he had never authorized the mention of any 
required number of applications for emigration from the Soviet 
Union, much less the 60,000 that Senator Jackson had recently 
proclaimed. Brezhnev responded that no one who wanted to leave 
was being harassed but also claimed that the total number of 
applications was far below 60,000. After exchanging 
mutualcompliments and agreeing that their meeting had been

Before leaving Vladivostok, Kissinger briefed waiting 
reporters on the results of the summit and gave them copies of 
the previously negotiated joint communiqu?nd the newly drawn 
up joint statement on SALT which contained the basic details of 
the Ford-Brezhnev agreement without the figures. He announced 
that this marked the breakthrough they had been seeking since 
1972 and that it offered a very strong possibility of a signed 
agreement in 1975. The Secretary declared that they hoped to 
look back on Vladivostok as a turning point which put a cap on 
the arms race -- a cap substantially below the capabilities of 
both sides -- and as the first step in further arms 
reduction.19 Kissinger then returned to Tokyo (briefly) that 
same day and went on to Peking, while Ford flew back to 
Washington. 
Results: Disappointing Aftermath  
Back in Washington, in speaking to the press and before the 
National Security Council, Ford and Kissinger defended the 
Vladivostok accord as a "cap on the arms race". In support of 
this contention, they pointed out that the overall total agreed 
to was below what the Soviet Union already possessed. They 
emphasized privately that the very lowest U.S. intelligence 
estimates as to what the Soviets would build in the future 
without a SALT agreement were considerably above the 
Vladivostok figures for both MIRVs and strategic launchers. 
They also maintained that the Soviet Union had made major 
concessions at Vladivostok and that the United States had 
gotten a far better agreement than had seemed possible before 
the summit. Kissinger suggested that this was because Brezhnev 
had been trying to strengthen detente by getting off in the 
right direction with a new President who might be in power for 
the next six years. He argued that such an accord could only 
have been reached at the summit, noting that the Soviet 
Delegation at Geneva could never have agreed to equal 
aggregates with no compensation for FBS. The Secretary also 
claimed that the United States had a "largely fool-proof" 
method of verification of the new accord and that such 
verification was not dependent upon the good faith of either 
side. 20 
Public and congressional reaction to Vladivostok was 
mixed. The New York Times criticized the accord for allowing 
both sides to go ahead Trah their planned arms build-ups, 
although it admitted that if the administration's claim that 
this was the best that could be obtained from the Soviets was 
true the world might have to make the best of "a bad 
agreement". Harris polls in December 1974 showed that although 
77 percent of those polled favored substantially limiting the

number of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles, the public was 
divided 35 to 34 percent on whether or not the Vladivostok 
accord was a breakthrough. The polls did show, however, that 
Vladivostok had improved public opinion of Ford's foreign 
policy. 21 
Senator Henry Jackson criticized the administration for not 
getting a more substantial reduction to aggregates of 1,700 for 
both sides and Senator Barry Goldwater complained that the new 
accord was "just another ploy by the Russians to try to fool 
some of our detente-happy people."22 On the other hand, 
Senator Edward Kennedy (acting for himself and Senators Charles 
Mathias and Walter Mondale) introduced a Senate resolution 
which supported the new SALT accord but also urged the 
President to negotiate further arms limitations and reductions, 
including lower aggregate and MIRV ceilings than agreed to at 
Vladivostok.23 
The administration's hopes for continued progress in 
U.S.-Soviet relations received their first setback on December 
20, when Congress passed the Trade Bill with the Jackson-Vanik 
Amendment and limitations on credits to the Soviet Union. 
Brezhnev subsequently notified Ford that Moscow refused to 
accept a trading relationship with the United States based upon 
these discriminatory restrictions.24 Nevertheless, 
subsequent Ford-Brezhnev exchanges indicated that neither 
leader had wavered in his determination to follow through on 
Vladivostok and to transform their understanding there into a 
concrete, signed SALT agreement.25 
It was not disputes over trade discrimination but rather 
over some of the "gray" areas of strategic arms limitations not 
decided at the summit that caused the prospects of a signed 
SALT agreement in 1975 to dim and finally to disappear 
altogether. On January 29, 1975, the National Security Council 
met to discuss instructions to the U.S. SALT Delegation for 
talks scheduled to begin in Geneva on January 31. Ambassador 
U. Alexis Johnson was advised that his primary objective was to 
achieve an understanding before Brezhnev's arrival in June. 
Nevertheless, the NSC, which anticipated potential disputes 
with the Soviets over verification, cruise missiles, and the 
Backfire bomber, also told Johnson to be "hard-nosed" on 
including the Backfire in the Soviet aggregate and warned that 
cruise missiles might have to be the subject of a separate 
agreement 26

Primarily over these two issues, the Geneva negotiations 
were to bog down. No agreement on SALT II was reached during 
1975, despite high hopes in both Washington and Moscow. 
Brezhnev's long-planned visit to Washington in June for another 
summit had to be postponed, although he and Ford did agree to 
meet in Helsinki for the final session of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in late July.

FORD AND BREZHNEV AT HELSINKI, JULY 30-AUGUST 2, 1975 
The 1975 Helsinki summit between President Ford and Soviet 
Party Chairman Brezhnev took place on July 30 and August 2, 
1975, immediately prior to and following the ceremonies closing 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
The United States gave top priority to two issues: 
-- Strengthening cooperation between the'great powers 
-- Concluding a SALT II agreement 
The results of the Ford-Brezhnev meeting were 
unsatisfactory. No substantive progress was made on SALT 
although the atmosphere which surrounded meetings of the two 
leaders was frank and cooperative. Public reaction to the 
meeting was strongly negative and contributed to the subsequent 
deterioration in U.S.-Soviet relations during the remainder of 
the Ford administration and weakened the President's political 
position. 
Initiative: Resuscitating Detente  
President Ford's decision to attend the Helsinki heads of 
government meeting and sign the Final Act of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe was an effort to revitalize 
the policy of cooperation with the Soviet Union he had 
inherited from the Nixon administration and carried forward at 
the Vladivostok summit. This policy was under mounting attack 
in the United States, particularly from within the Republican 
Party, and appeared to be losing some of its attraction to the 
Soviet leadership. In December 1974, shortly after the 
conclusion of the Vladivostok summit, Congress amended the bill 
granting most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status to the Soviet 
Union by tying freer emigration from the U.S.S.R. to improved 
trade relations (the Jackson-Vanik amendment). Soviet General 
Secretary Leonid Brezhnev heatedly protested this 
"interference" in Soviet internal affairs in a letter to the 
White House.1 In February 1975 Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko met in 
Geneva to smooth over differences between the two states over 
trade, arms control, and the Middle East. The meeting was 
satisfactory and President Ford subsequently wrote Brezhnev 
that the United States would look favorably on the Soviet 
Government's request for a summit meeting which would coincide 
with the CSCE heads of government gathering.2

Ford's decision to attend the Helsinki meeting was 
calculated to please both the Soviet Union and U.S. European 
Allies. The Soviets had been pressing for a conference on 
European security since 1954 and hoped to utilize such a 
process to secure Western recognition of the permanence of the 
boundries the U.S.S.R. had created in Eastern and Central 
Europe at the end of World War II. By 1974 they were pressing 
for a summit meeting to crown the CSCE process. The NATO 
Allies had agreed to the conference only after securing Soviet 
concessions on the Berlin question and other German issues. 
The NATO Allies utilized the CSCE to win public Soviet 
commitments to respect the right to self-determination of other 
European states and to conform with Western practices on human 
rights issues. While the Helsinki accords were not treaty 
commitments, they constituted a useful psychological tool to 
force better Soviet behavior in Europe. In exchange, the West 
reaffirmed its de facto recognition of Eastern Europe's 
existing borders while inserting a clause in the Helsinki 
document which stressed that border modification could only be 
the result of peaceful change.3 
President Ford's decision to attend the Helsinki Conference 
and meet with Brezhnev was confirmed with the Soviet Union in 
May and the dates for both the CSCE heads of government meeting 
and the summit conference were finalized at a July 10 meeting 
between Kissinger and Gromyko. The decision was publicly 
announced on July 20, 1975. The President and his policy of 
detente had in the meantime been embroiled in a series of 
damaging controversies which climaxed when the White House 
declined to receive exiled Soviet writer Aleksander 
Solzhenitsyn on the publicly-stated grounds that such a meeting 
might damage U.S.-Soviet relations. Announcement of Ford's 
decision to meet with Brezhnev at Helsinki ignited a new wave 
of attacks on the policy of detente. Traditional opponents of 
closer cooperation with the Soviet Union were joined by usual 
supporters such as The New York Times, which argued that a 
Presidential appearance at Helsinki would appear to give 
Western approval to Soviet claims that the Eastern European 
borders established during and after World War II were 
sacrosanct .4 
The Ford administration sought to counter domestic 
criticism of both the summit and CSCE by pointing out that the 
United States was participating with 34 other nations in the 
Helsinki meeting and that the CSCE Final Act was not legally 
binding. In a meeting with leaders of U.S. ethnic groups of 
East European origin, Ford reiterated U. S. refusal to grant de 
jure recognition to the political solution imposed by Soviet

arms on Eastern Europe between 1940 and 1945. The President 
stressed that the United States and its NATO Allies had won a 
useful tool in efforts to improve the lot of the peoples of 
Eastern Europe by extracting Soviet pledges to respect basic 
human and political rights. 
Preparations: SALT and the Future of Detente  
Arms control, particularly the Strategic Arms Limitations 
Treaty (SALT) Talks, dominated both East-West relations and 
U.S. preparations for the Helsinki summit. Other issues of 
importance were: Soviet cooperation with ongoing U.S. efforts 
to secure withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai Peninsula 
as the first step toward a comprehensive settlement of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East; the related issues of 
trade and freedom of emigration from the Soviet Union; limiting 
Soviet involvement in Portugal's internal affairs following the 
April 1974 revolution; implementation of the CSCE Final Act; 
and revitalization of the stalled Mutual and Balanced Force 
Reductions (MBFR) Talks.6 
The Ford administration hoped to sign a SALT II agreement 
with the Soviet Union in the fall of 1975 during a previously 
agreed-upon Brezhnev visit to the United States. Gromyko, at a 
May 10 meeting with Kissinger at Geneva, outlined new Soviet 
proposals which raised U.S. hopes for a swift solution to 
outstanding difficulties. On the critical issue of 
verification of the number of missiles and warheads each side 
possessed, the Soviets suggested that all missiles that had 
been tested with multiple independently targetable reentry 
vehicles (MIRV) should be counted as MIRVed and included in the 
ceiling of 1320 missiles established by SALT I. The Soviets 
also proposed that each side should have the right to replace 
existing MIRV systems at a later date with new MIRV systems on 
a one-to-one basis and single warhead missiles with new single 
warhead missiles. The Soviet proposal was close to previous 
U.S. projects for verification. Linked to the verification 
proposal, however, was a second Soviet plan which called for 
limiting cruise missile deployment. The Soviet plan would have 
limited deployment of mobile cruise missiles with a range of 
more than 600 kilometers to bomber aircraft. It banned ship, 
submarine, or mobile transporter launched cruise missiles with 
a range greater than 600 kilometers together with all 
intercontinental range land-based cruise missiles. The Soviets 
rejected U.S. efforts to define their recently developed 
"Backfire" bomber as a strategic weapon, and thus to include it 
in the strategic arms talks.7

Kissinger advised President Ford that the Soviet proposals 
represented a significant step toward an agreement on SALT II 
and that a meeting between the President and Soviet General 
Secretary might accelerate progress toward an agreement.8 A 
note containing the U.S. response to the Soviet proposals of 
May 1975 was presented at the end of July. The United States 
indicated substantial agreement with Soviet proposals on 
verification. It favored a ban on ballistic missiles in space, 
in seabeds, and on ocean floors, as well as those with a range 
of over 600 kilometers deployed on surface ships. The United 
States further suggested that these areas of basic agreement 
together with a number of other technical matters be referred 
to the two nations' negotiating teams at Geneva for final 
resolution. The U.S. note also stated it was willing to accept 
"substantial parts of the Soviet position on cruise missiles," 
including a ban on the deployment of cruise missiles with a 
range greater than 600 kilometers which were "carried on 
aircraft other than heavy bombers," and a ban on the 
development of intercontinental cruise missiles. The United 
States sought modifications in Soviet proposals on submarine 
and surface launched cruise missiles. Finally, the U.S. note 
reiterated the position that the Backfire bomber must be 
considered in the strategic arms talks.9 
In the guidance memorandum Secretary Kissinger forwarded to 
President Ford on July 29, 1975, two objectives dominated U.S. 
strategy for the Helsinki summit: 1) progress in SALT 
negotiations and 2) reaffirmation of the commitment of both 
sides to improve U.S.-Soviet relations as a matter of basic 
policy. Kissinger advised the President that he should 
underline his government's insistence that U.S.-Soviet 
cooperation was a "two-way street." Movement toward solution 
of such key issues as SALT, the MBFR talks, and the 
implementation of the CSCE Final Act was the best means to calm 
U.S. public suspicions that the Soviet Union was exploiting 
detente, thereby preserving the basis for U.S.-Soviet 
cooperation.10 
While no formal agenda was prepared for the Ford-Brezhnev 
talks, the State Department prepared briefing material On the 
following substantive issues: 
--CSCE implementation 
--MBFR talks 
--The Middle East peace process 
--The strategic balance in the Indian Ocean 
--The Portugese situation 
--U.S.-Soviet trade 
--Emigration from the Soviet Union

The briefing material provided President Ford outlined U.S. 
policy in the following manner. The United States viewed the 
CSCE Final Act as a set of guidelines for the future conduct of 
East-West relations; it established standards of behavior that 
could be translated into practice. The President should press 
Brezhnev to break the deadlock over MBFR. If the Soviet Union 
raised the Middle East question, the United States would seek 
to reassure Soviet leaders that it was not seeking to expel 
their influence from the area. Soviet cooperation, preferably 
by nonintervention in U.S. peacemaking efforts, was welcome. 
The President was also prepared to discuss the strategic 
balance in the Indian Ocean area, and to note that the United 
States had no desire to start a regional arms race, but would 
counter continued development of Soviet bases in the region 
through construction of a facility at Diego Garcia island. 
Similarly, the United States would urge Soviet restraint and 
nonintervention in Portugese internal affairs which had taken 
an increasingly radical course since the April 1974 revolution, 
thereby offering the Portugese Communist Party an enticement to 
attempt to seize power. In addition to SALT, other arms 
control issues were being discussed by the great powers, and 
the President was prepared to state that the United States was 
ready to sign the just completed treaty limiting peaceful 
nuclear explosions to a 150 kiloton threshold and, with only a 
few details remaining before completion of an environmental 
warfare agreement, the United States was ready to work out a 
common strategy for its presentation and ultimate signature. 
Finally, on the troubled and intertwined issues of trade and 
emigration, the President was to promise that he would seek 
revision of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to permit the Soviet 
Union to enjoy most favored nation trading status. However, 
Ford was to explain candidly that prospects for disentangling 
the two issues were limited and that progress toward full trade 
status was likely to be slow.11 
Discussions: Progress on Detente and Deadlock on SALT  
President Ford arrived at Helsinki on the afternoon of July 
29, 1975 after state visits to the Federal Republic of Germany 
and Poland. The Presidential party included Secretary of State 
Kissinger, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Walter Stoessel, 
Deputy Assistant for National Security Affairs Brent Scowcroft, 
and State Department Counselor Helmut Sonnenfeldt. The 
President's schedule was arranged to provide time for two 
lengthy morning meetings with the aging and recently ill 
Brezhnev, immediately before and after the CSCE ceremonies, 
which were scheduled for the afternoon of July 30 through 
August 1. The Brezhnev party included Foreign Minister Andrei 
Gromyko and his senior foreign affairs advisers.

The first negotiating session between President Ford and 
Secretary Brezhnev took place at the residence of the U.S. 
Ambassador to Finland on the morning of July 30, 1975 and 
lasted approximately 3 hours.12 At the request of the Soviet 
Union, the participants deferred discussion of SALT until the 
second meeting. President Ford then made a statement in which 
he stressed the United States commitment to detente and 
indicated his expectation to remain in office for a second term 
to see the process of cooperation continued. Noting that 
detente had serious critics in the United States, Ford stated 
that further progress on SALT and the successful implementation 
of the CSCE agreements would silence them. The President also 
pointed out that a projected Brezhnev visit to the United 
States in the fall of 1975 would depend on progress on a SALT 
agreement. 
Brezhnev responded by underlining his desire to reach an 
accord on SALT and stated that the Soviet Union would be fully 
prepared to devote itself to the issue at the second session of 
the summit after a more detailed study of the latest U.S. 
proposals. Brezhnev also introduced the idea of extending the 
CSCE process to other areas of the globe, noting that Ford had 
stated that detente was not only for Europe but for the rest of 
the world as well. 
The Soviet General Secretary raised the issue of the Middle 
East. He indicated that the United Nations was not a suitable 
forum for settling the Arab-Israeli problem. Brezhnev stressed 
that the Soviet Union wanted to know more about U.S. plans for 
a Middle East solution and added that without U.S.-Soviet 
accord on a solution the suspended Geneva Conference on the 
Middle East would collapse. In response to a Ford request for 
Soviet suggestions and recommendations, Brezhnev replied that 
his government's position was that Israel must surrender 
territory occupied since June 1967, and that the Palestinian 
rights and Israel's "free and secure" existence must be 
guaranteed. Prodded by Gromyko, Brezhnev then noted Soviet 
concern that the step-by-step method of returning occupied 
lands was in danger of becoming divorced from the larger issue 
of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. 
President Ford agreed that the United Nations was not a 
suitable forum for settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
The President added that the United States wanted to avoid a 
clash between the great powers and to find a means of bringing 
together the parties to the dispute. According to the 
memorandum of conversation, Ford then complimented the Soviet 
Union for its "very helpful actions." Ford stressed that the 
"step-by-step" approach which the United States was employing

had reached a stage "where either it will achieve another 
success, or else there is a possibility of a comprehensive 
proposal . . . that would encompass all of the issues that have 
festered there for years." Kissinger added the United States 
believed that "after the next step we will have reached the 
point where a comprehensive approach will be required." After 
further comments on the complexity of the Middle East problem, 
Kissinger reiterated the need for a U.S.-Soviet accord on 
common policy for the region and warned against the danger of 
being drawn into a confrontation by "volatile" peoples who had 
no loyalty to either of the great powers. 
Brezhnev insisted that an agreed-upon forum existed in the 
proposed Geneva Conference and the time had come for the United 
States to give up its step-by-step diplomacy, which was not 
producing a comprehensive solution, in favor of a conference of 
all the parties which could settle the entire matter. 
The talks also dealt with the intertwined issues of Soviet 
emigration policy and most-favored-nation trading status. 
President Ford praised Brezhnev for his frank discussions with 
a U.S. Senatorial delegation on matters relating to trade and 
economics. Ford stressed the close connection between a 
satisfactory settlement of the issue of Jewish emigration and 
his Administration's efforts to secure a favorable trade bill 
from the Congress. Brezhnev introduced statistics on Jewish 
emigration from the Soviet Union to show that the number of 
Jews wishing to leave had declined precipitously from a high 
point of 33,000 in 1973, because those who wished to leave had 
now departed. He claimed that the Soviet Union had met 98.4 
percent of all requests for emigration submitted since 1945 and 
that those cases which had been denied permission to emigrate 
involved security matters. Fewer Soviet Jews wished to 
emigrate to Israel and the Soviet Union could not forceably 
expel Jewish citizens who wished to remain in the Soviet Union 
to meet the demands of the U.S. Congress. 
President Ford did not challenge the Soviet presentation 
but instead stressed the need for creating a favorable 
perception of the Soviet Union and the detente process by 
further progress on the basic issues of SALT and CSCE and by 
making it clear that the possibility for emigration from the 
Soviet Union existed. 
Brezhnev concluded the meeting by noting statements by U.S. 
Defense Secretary James Schlesinger which implied that the 
United States might launch a preventive nuclear strike against 
the Soviet Union. President Ford assured the Soviet leader 
that he made U.S. policy and that the policy was detente.

Both Ford and Brezhnev participated in the largely 
ceremonial concluding sessions of the CSCE between July 30 and 
August 1 and signed the Final Act. In their speeches to the 
conference prior to the August 1 signing ceremony, the U.S. 
President and the Soviet General Secretary underlined their 
commitment to detente and the implementation of the CSCE 
accords. Thus, their second 3-hour meeting on the morning of 
August 2 on the key issue of SALT negotiations began in a 
favorable atmosphere. This second meeting, however, was less 
productive. Brezhnev, who had recently recovered from an 
illness, appeared fatigued to U.S. officials and apparently 
ill-prepared to discuss the substance of SALT. President 
Ford's memoirs indicate that the Soviets refused to back away 
from the position that the Backfire bomber was not a strategic 
weapon. A heated exchange ensued between Ford and Brezhnev 
over the truthfulness of Soviet claims that Backfire was not a 
strategic weapon. A "theatrically outraged" Brezhnev insisted 
that the United States could not doubt the word of the 
Secretary General of the Soviet Communist Party. The Soviets 
also insisted on linking concessions on verification to an 
agreement on cruise missiles which would severely limit both 
their range and their deployment. No progress was made toward 
resolving the impasse over the issue of arms limitations. In 
an intriguing aside, Brezhnev appeared to offer a deal in which 
the Soviets would sell oil to the United States at below world 
market prices in exchange for a favorable grain sales 
arrangement. U.S. officials were very interested in an offer 
which might undercut the OPEC cartel and later dispatched 
Assistant Secretary of State Charles Robinson to Moscow for 
talks on the possible trade. The deal was never consumated.13 
Results: A Domestic Setback for the President and Detente  
U.S. leaders were pleased with the outcome of the first 
summit session. Kissinger's briefing paper for an August 6, 
1975 cabinet meeting noted that Brezhnev had made a "rather 
strong and sometimes emotional" commitment to detente and that 
the Soviet position on the Middle East was generally 
conciliatory and they would await the outcome of U.S. efforts 
at step-by-step diplomacy before pressing for the convening of 
a Geneva meeting. The second meeting on SALT indicated that 
substantial disagreements existed between the two sides which 
could only be resolved through hard negotiations.14 
The Helsinki summit did little to rebuild U.S. public 
support for the policy of detente. Although President Ford 
claimed "progress" in the SALT negotiations at a postsummit 
meeting with the press, he admitted that failure to reach an 
accord on this issue was "disturbing." Moreover, the summit at

Helsinki was part of what Ford later termed a "Soviet 
propaganda victory" at the CSCE. Ford repeatedly defended the 
U.S. decision to sign the Final Act and participate in the 
Helsinki meetings, but he admitted that U.S. public opinion 
had concluded that the Soviets had gained an advantage over the 
United States, securing Western recognition of existing 
European frontiers, recognition of the legitimacy of Eastern 
European Communist governments, and the Soviet Union's forced 
incorporation of the three pre-World War II Baltic republics of 
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the U.S.S.R. Ford faced a 
torrent of domestic criticism including charges that the United 
States had "sold out" the peoples of Eastern Europe at Helsinki 
which helped to lay the groundwork for a major challenge to his 
renomination. Kissinger was called to testify before hostile 
congressional committees. He told his staff he believed that 
Defense Secretary Schlesinger, who opposed substantive 
concessions on cruise missiles to the Soviet Union, was leaking 
information designed to undercut administration policy.15 
The policy of detente yielded at least one benefit for 
diplomacy. Shortly after the summit, Kissinger secured a 
second pullback of Israeli forces in the Sinai. The Soviet 
Union did not interfere with the final round of intense 
diplomacy and did not attack the agreements in official 
statements. 
Overall relations between the United States and the Soviet 
Union, however, deteriorated during the remainder of the Ford 
administration. Soviet assistance to one of the factions in 
Angola's civil war provoked public criticism from Kissinger and 
seemed to strengthen the case of critics who claimed that 
detente was a one-way policy. One of the leading critics of 
the policy, former California Governor Ronald Reagan challenged 
President Ford for the Republican nomination, claiming that by 
pursuing detente U.S. foreign policy was becoming subservient 
to the Soviet Union. 
Negotiations on a SALT II Treaty continued into 1976. The 
two sides were unable to overcome their differences on either 
cruise missiles or the Backfire bomber. A Kissinger visit to 
Moscow in January 1976 failed to break the arms control logjam 
or produce any give over Angola. The onset of the U.S. 
Presidential election campaign led to a suspension of the 
talks, and following President Ford's defeat the conclusion of 
a SALT II agreement was left to the incoming Carter 
administration. 
In spite of its initial propaganda triumph at CSCE, the 
' Soviet Union soon found the "Helsinki process" was an 
encumberment to both its foreign and domestic policies. The

Western states pressed for full compliance with the CSCE 
agreements and utilized subsequent CSCE review meetings to 
highlight repeated Soviet violations in a number of areas, 
including human rights. Meanwhile, Eastern European and Soviet 
dissidents, aided by the Western press, spotlighted Soviet 
repressive practices. This coverage undercut Soviet hopes of 
attaining an unencumbered most-favored-nation trading status 
with the United States.16

TOP SECRET/NODIS  
CARTER AND BREZHNEV AT VIENNA, JUNE 15-18, 1979 
The only U.S.-Soviet summit conference held during the 
Carter administration opened in Vienna on June 15, 1979, and 
continued through June 18, with five plenary meetings as well 
as a private meeting between President Jimmy Carter and Soviet 
General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. The convening of the summit 
was linked to the completion of complex and difficult 
negotiations on the strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT II), 
which began in the Nixon and Ford administrations and was 
pursued to completion by the Carter administration. The State 
Department prepared briefing papers on a wide range of issues 
that might be discussed at the Vienna conference, and 
Department and White House working groups coordinated the 
planning. Discussions at the summit focused on the following 
subjects: 
1. SALT II 
2. SALT III and other-arms control issues 
3. International issues 
4. Bilateral and trade issues. 
The major achievement at Vienna was the signing of the SALT 
II Treaty on strategic arms. Many other issues were discussed 
and positions clarified, but little movement toward specific 
agreements resulted. Subsequently, the Soviet Union reacted 
negatively to the NATO two-track decision in mid-December 1979 
to deploy intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Western 
Europe while simultaneously pursuing arms control talks with 
the Soviet Union. The invasion of Afghanistan by Soviet armed 
forces later that month removed all hopes for progress toward a 
rapprochement in U.S.-Soviet relations. President Carter asked 
the Senate to delay further consideration of the SALT II 
Treaty; the agreement still has not been ratified. 
Initiative: Linkage with SALT II  
The Carter administration inherited a legacy of five 
U.S.-Soviet summits from the Nixon and Ford administrations. 
In his inaugural address President Carter expressed hope for 
"the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this earth,"1 
and his administration attempted from the outset to negotiate a 
SALT II Treaty with the Soviet Union to supersede the limited

1972 SALT I agreement on offensive nuclear arms, due to expire 
in October 1977. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance visited Moscow 
in late March 1977 to initiate an arms control dialogue with 
the Soviet leadership. Believing arms control agreements 
should not merely codify or limit the arms race but should 
result in substantial arms reductions, President Carter 
instructed Secretary Vance to propose drastic cuts in the 
number of each country's nuclear delivery vehicles. The Soviet 
leadership rejected this U.S. initiative as a radical departure 
from the understandings reached with President Ford at 
Vladivostok in November 1974 and as very one-sided in favor of 
the United States.2 
Despite the failure of the Vance mission, the Carter 
administration resumed the SALT talks with the Soviet Union in 
Geneva in May 1977. These protracted negotiations included 
regular sessions in Geneva between Paul Warnke, Chairman of the 
U.S. SALT Delegation, and his Soviet counterpart, Vladimir 
Semenov, as well as several meetings between Secretary Vance 
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in Washington, 
Geneva, and Moscow and occasional meetings in Washington 
between President Carter and Gromyko and Soviet Ambassador 
Anatoliy Dobrynin. These talks gradually resolved many of the 
outstanding substantive and technical issues between the two 
sides.3 Each side stated in September 1977, shortly before 
the expiration of the SALT I interim agreement, that it would 
adhere to the provisions of that treaty during SALT II talks if 
the other exercised similar restraint.4 
During the negotiations the Soviet Union accepted a basic 
framework of 2,250 total missile launchers for each side 
beginning in 1981, 1,320 of which could contain multiple 
(MIRVed) warheads. Each side agreed to sublimits of 1,200 for 
MIRVed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and 
submarine-launched ballistic missiles and 820 for land-based 
ICBMs. The Soviets also dropped their previous insistence on a 
range limit for the testing and deployment of air-launched 
cruise missiles and later dropped the limit on testing of 
ground- and sea-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs and SLCMs). 
The United States reciprocated by accepting a prohibition on 
the flight testing and deployment of air-launched cruise 
missiles and a strict definition of a 600-kilometer limit on 
GLCMs and SLCMs in the protocol of the treaty, which would be 
in force through December 1981. The two sides also resolved 
the modernization question. Each could test and deploy one new 
ICBM, with defined characteristics, if the aggregate number of 
ICBMs was limited to 1,200.5 
Throughout these negotiations Brezhnev let it be known on 
several occasions that he favored a "well prepared" summit

meeting with President Carter to confirm and sign a SALT II 
agreement. Progress in resolving the major arms control 
questions in SALT by early fall of 1978 raised President 
Carter's hopes that a summit meeting could take place in late 
1978 or early 1979.6 
Difficulties in U.S.-Soviet relations nonetheless delayed 
agreement on a summit meeting until the spring of 1979. 
Differences arose during 1978 over the issue of encryption of 
telemetry in missile tests. Warnke and Semenov had reached an 
understanding at Geneva in which the Soviet Union agreed to ban 
the encoding of electronic signals from its missile tests that 
impeded U.S. ability to verify Soviet compliance with the SALT 
II accord. Vance supported this understanding. But other U.S. 
officials, especially Director of Central Intelligence 
Stansfield Turner, advocated an outright ban on all telemetry 
encryption. Gromyko informed U.S. officials that the SALT I 
agreement allowing for national technical means of verification 
was also adequate for the SALT II agreement, and the United 
States was raising an "artificial" issue with its insistence on 
a prohibition of encryption.7 
Secretary Vance believed that although both nations were 
groping toward the same end, the Soviets emphasized the 
permissibility of encryption unless it impeded verification 
while the United States was trying to stress its restriction. 
New compromise language for an agreement was worked out between 
Gromyko and Vance in Geneva in late December 1978, but during 
these meetings new instructions from Washington required the 
Secretary to reserve the U.S. right to challenge telemetry 
encryption under the treaty. The loss of U.S. monitoring 
capabilities in Iran in early 1979 following the revolution in 
that country made U.S. concerns on the verification issue more 
urgent. President Carter sent letters to President Brezhnev 
stating his administration's opposition to the encryption of 
telemetry and suggesting possible solutions to the impasse.8 
The Soviet Backfire bomber issue also remained unresolved. 
The Soviets insisted that the Backfire bomber had only 
medium-range capability and therefore was not a strategic 
weapon, but seemed willing to meet U.S. concerns on its range 
and payload capabilities by making a separate statement outside 
the treaty framework that it would not significantly increase 
the annual production rate and the range/payload of this 
aircraft. The details of this arrangement were not confirmed 
in writing during these discussions, however, and the issue 
would resurface as the subject of considerable discussion at 
the summit meeting.

Other U.S. concerns were Soviet activities in Southern 
Africa (Namibia, Angola, and Rhodesia) and growing Soviet 
military presence in Ethiopia, South Yemen, Vietnam, and Cuba. 
Regarding the latter, the Carter administration in the fall of 
1978 sought clear assurances from the Soviets that the Mig-23s, 
which U.S. intelligence had learned were being delivered to 
Cuba, did not have a nuclear capability and that only a limited 
number of a nonnuclear-capable ground attack version would be 
sent to Cuba. 
After considerable negotiations, the Soviet Union said that 
it would not object to the Carter administration issuing of a 
public statement that indicated the non-nuclear capabilities of 
the Mig-23s in Cuba, provided the statement did not imply that 
the Soviet Union had agreed not to increase the number of these 
airplanes in Cuba. Though not entirely satisfied, the 
President stated on November 30 and December 7 that he had 
received Soviet assurances that it had not violated the 1962 
U.S.-Soviet understanding that the Soviet Union would not 
deploy nuclear weapons or nuclear delivery systems in Cuba. 
Carter also affirmed that his administration would continue to 
monitor Soviet actions there very carefully. 10 
Throughout his discussions with Soviet officials, Vance 
emphasized that the Soviet Union's focus on selective detente 
limited to strategic arms was inadequate. U.S. leaders warned 
that Soviet restraint and cooperation on regional questions 
were required to persuade Senators that overall detente was 
working so that they would give their consent to a SALT II 
agreement .11 
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union reacted negatively to the 
growing rapprochement between the United States and the 
People's Republic of China. The joint U.S.-China announcement 
on December 15, 1978, of full diplomatic relations commencing 
on January 1, 1979, followed by Chinese Vice Premier Deng 
Xiaoping's visit to the United States, presaged the possibility 
of U.S. arms sales to China. National Security Adviser 
Zbigniew Brzezinski in particular believed the Soviet 
leadership faced a serious dilemma--whether to try to foster 
detente with the United States or move in other directions--and 
he felt that the exploitation of the China relationship would 
elicit a Soviet response one way or the other. Though Brezhnev 
had written President Carter immediately after the joint 
announcement that he hoped the U.S. relationship with China 
would not preclude an early SALT agreement, he soon reversed 
these private assurances through the Soviet news media. 
President Carter's subsequent statements that the United States 
would not sell arms to China failed to convince Soviet leaders 
who continued to express publicly their displeasure at the

prospct of increasingly friendly relations between their two 
major rivals.12 
Though some State Department officials believed that the 
U.S. decision to establish normal diplomatic relations with 
China seriously complicated U.S.-Soviet relations and delayed 
the summit meeting, Brzezinski believed that too many SALT 
issues (telemetry ecryption and the Backfire, for example) 
remained unresolved to conclude a SALT II treaty at a summit. 
It took in fact almost weekly meetings, about 25 in all, 
between Vance and Dobrynin from January to' June 1979 as well as 
ongoing negotiations between the SALT delegations in Geneva to 
resolve the outstanding SALT questions. The continuing 
progress on SALT II gradually convinced both sides that the 
major issues on strategic arms had been resolved and that a 
summit meeting of the heads of government was desirable in the 
near future)"' 
A last detail in these discussions was agreement on the 
site for the summit. Because the last meeting between the 
heads of the two governments held in either nation had taken 
place at Vladivostok, protocol required that this summit be 
held in the United States. Soviet officials apparently 
claimed, however, that Brezhnev's poor health precluded a long 
journey to the United States, and the two sides agreed instead 
on Vienna. A more neutral meeting place like Vienna had 
certain advantages for constructive discussions. As Brzezinski 
later observed, the Vienna site permitted the summit to take 
place with less fanfare and fraternization than would have been 
the case if it had been held in the United States.14 
Finally, on May 11 the two governments announced that a 
summit meeting would be held June 15-18, 1979, in Vienna to 
"confirm and sign the treaty on the limitation of strategic 
offensive arms" and "discuss other issues of mutual 
interest. '.15 
Preparations: Many Issues, Few Prospects for Agreements  
Several months before the formal announcement of the Vienna 
meeting, Carter administration officials began to prepare 
briefing papers on a wide range of issues that might be 
discussed at a summit conference. Department of State and 
National Security Council (NSC) officials organized an 
interdepartmental working group to coordinate the planning for 
a summit meeting. In March 1979, the Department also organized 
its own working group. Robert Barry, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State for European Affairs (EUR), served as 
chairman of the Department's working group of 16-20 officials,

most of whom were Soviet specialists, arms control experts from 
the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs and the Arms Control 
and Disarmament Agency (ACD), and public affairs officials 
from the Bureau of Public Affairs, EUR, Voice of America, and 
the International Communications Agency. (The public affairs 
input declined when it was decided to hold the summit outside 
the United States.) This working group handled overall 
planning, including the preparation of briefing, "issues," and 
talking points papers. Barry, who also served on the NSC 
working group, acted as liaison with the White House on the 
preparations. Marshall Shulman, Special Adviser to the 
Secretary on Soviet Affairs, worked closely .with Barry and the 
Department's working group and met frequently with Vance and 
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher in discussing the 
agenda and planning for the summit. Department principals also 
consulted regularly with the American Embassy in Moscow 
concerning these preparations.18 
The Department of State and NSC working groups agreed on an 
agenda comprising four main subject areas: 
1) The overall relationship, including the possibility of 
annual summit meetings and regular meetings at the Foreign 
Minister-Secretary of State level, and a dialogue between the 
two Defense Ministers or their Chiefs of Staff; 
2) SALT II and other arms control issues, including SALT 
III, mutual balanced and force reduction (MBFR) talks, 
anti-satellite weapons (ASAT), comprehensive test ban (CTB), 
chemical and radiological weapons, Indian Ocean, and nuclear 
non-proliferation; 
3) International and regional issues, including the Middle 
East peace process, Iran, Southern Africa, Horn of Africa, 
Southeast Asia, Afghanistan, Persian Gulf, Cuba, and global 
development issues; and 
4) Bilateral and trade issues, including 
most-favored-nation (MFN) status, agreement on a new U.S. 
consulate in Tashkent, reciprocity in media and commercial 
representation, human rights, cultural exchange agreement, and 
parliamentary exchanges.17 
Subsequent meetings between Vance and Dobrynin or their 
deputies resulted in agreement on an agenda for the summit. 
Dobrynin objected only to the inclusion of human rights and 
reciprocity in media and commercial representation. Regarding 
other arms control issues, such as gray areas, ASAT, CTB, and 
MBFR, he noted that "so far we are not encouraged by the 
position of the U.S. side at the negotiations and in the course 
of bilateral exchanges on these issues."18 His comment 
foreshadowed the inconclusive result of the discussions on 
these issues at the Vienna summit.

the two sides also agreed to negotiate in advance the 
communique to be issued at the conclusion of the summit. 
Following Soviet presentation of its draft communique on May 
25, EUR prepared a counterdraft, with contributions from the 
Office of the Legal Advisor, Bureau of Politico-Military 
Affairs, Policy Planning Staff, and regional bureaus. This 
counterdraft incorporated some of the Soviet language but, "in 
contrast to the rather bland Soviet text," set forth the U.S. 
"maximum realistic positions on key issues." The draft was 
given to the Soviets on June 1.19 On the' following day 
representatives from the Soviet Embassy met with Barry and 
David Aaron and Reginald Bartholomew from the NSC to devise an 
agreed text. 
, Discussions on the communique revealed that the Soviet 
Union sought a general declaration of principles expressing in 
rather abstract terms the two nations' commitment to peaceful 
coexistence as they had done at the Moscow summit in 1972, 
while the United States preferred to emphasize the specific and 
concrete. The Soviets complained about the U.S. draft 
communique dropping references to "peaceful coexistence," 
"non-intervention in each other's internal affairs," strategic 
parity, and "complete equality" as the principles guiding SALT, 
and to abjuring efforts "to achieve military supremacy." 
Similarly, the Soviets objected to U.S. language on a U.N. role 
in the Middle East peace process and to the "commitment to 
freedom of movement" in the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) context. They also rejected the 
selective references to South Asia on nonproliferation matters, 
and to specific references to Indochina, Iran, and 
Afghanistan. When willing to engage in specifics, the Soviets 
wanted to spell out U.S.-Soviet differences on the Middle East 
and South Africa. This contradicted the U.S. desire for more 
positive language in the communique.20 The disagreements on 
the communique foreshadowed the differences on the same issues 
that Carter and Brezhnev would express to each other at the 
summit. 
Carter administration officials' desire for a constructive 
summit meeting prompted them to recede from their initial 
maximum positions and to meet the Soviets more than halfway on 
the communique. The agreed items in the communique worked out 
in time for the opening of the summit were clearly more general 
than specific. The communique included the Soviet emphasis on 
the principles guiding the SALT process and mentioned other 
arms control issues mainly in terms of agreement to continue 
talks on them. It also referred only to the importance of 
increasing cooperation on international and regional issues and 
did not cite any third country by name as a special concern.

Likewise, on bilateral issues it mentioned only positive 
developments on a range of cultural, academic, scientific, and 
technical exchange programs and the importance of working 
toward the elimination of obstacles to mutually beneficial 
trade relations. Other U.S. concerns, such as annual summit 
meetings and biannual meetings at the Secretary of 
State-Foreign Minister level, which Vance had vigorously 
promoted within the Department and at the White House, and 
advance notification of all strategic missile tests were 
deferred for subsequent discussion at the summit.21 
In early June, Brzezinski and Vance sent papers to 
President Carter on U.S. objectives at the Vienna meeting. 
Brzezinski's memorandum, which was not submitted to the State 
Department in advance, divided the objectives into 
agreements/understandings and positions. Brzezinski had little 
hope for specific outcomes beyond the signing of the SALT II 
Treaty, agreement in principle to reduce missile launchers to 
1,800 in SALT III, a possible preliminary agreement on ASAT, 
agreement on a framework for a Phase I agreement on MBFR and 
other arms control issues, and Soviet agreement in the 
communique to freer flow of information and to greater equality 
and reciprocity in media and commercial representation. He 
perceived the summit mainly as an opportunity "to convey our 
perspectives and positions clearly and firmly to the Soviets so 
they know where we (and they) stand. This may, at a minimum, 
heighten their sensitivity to our concerns and possible actions 
and reduce the chances of miscalculation." Here Carter noted 
in the margin, "Too Timid. We should have clear goals and 
strive for them." He wrote similar comments elsewhere on 
Brzezinski's memorandum.22 
There had been too many ups and downs in Soviet-American 
relations since his inauguration more than 2 years earlier for 
the President to be overly sanguine about major breakthroughs 
at the summit. Nevertheless, he thought that his face-to-face 
meetings with Brezhnev would enable them to clear the air and 
begin to search, on a human level, for common ground in 
confronting the major problems affecting their peoples.23 
Secretary Vance's memorandum, like Brzezinski's, also 
forecast only modest specific accomplishments. Vance, however, 
described much more fully the political psychology of the 
Soviet leadership, including Brezhnev. Because the Secretary 
believed that the Soviet leaders "attach great weight to the 
personal element of political relationships," he impressed upon 
Carter that "Brezhnev and his entourage will be heavily 
influenced by your personal style and their perception of your 
motivations." Despite their competitive tactics on many 
issues, Vance was convinced that Brezhnev and other Soviet

leaders were deeply committed to the stability and 
respectablility that went with a smooth U.S.-Soviet 
relationship. Thus, he urged that "a major objective of this 
Summit should be to reinforce the incentives for the Soviet 
leaders to adhere to the general course they have taken away 
from the Cold War, while at the same time nudging them towards 
a more realistic understanding of what modifications in their 
behavior are essential if this course is to prosper." More 
specifically, he emphasized, "the primary focus of your 
exchanges with Brezhnev should be to reaffirm the basic 
framework of US-Soviet relations, which is based on substantial 
common interest in strategic stability, mutual acceptance of 
the status quo in the developed world, and avoidance of 
confrontation in dealing with the Third World." 
The Secretary singled out bilateral trade as an issue where 
Brezhnev might be most tractable. Brezhnev, he noted, had his 
own domestic constituency. His promises to segments of the 
Soviet elite to gain access to American technology and even 
consumer goods gave the United States potential leverage at the 
summit. Vance believed that trade with the Soviet Union had 
been constricted by linking it narrowly to Jewish emigration 
under the Jackson-Vanik amendment (section 402) of the Trade 
Act of 1974. According to Vance, the Soviet Government had 
recently begun to allow many more people to emigrate. If 
President Carter received positive assurances from Brezhnev of 
further Soviet improvement of the emigration process, then 
Carter would be willing to grant MFN status to the Soviet 
Union. Congress, Vance predicted, would not disapprove his 
action.24 
Vance and Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal probed 
Dobrynin on this proposal in May and early June. The Soviet 
Ambassador had expressed Soviet objections to any linkage 
between trade and emigration, but held open the prospect of 
major progress on this issue in Vienna.2 "If we can resolve 
the impasse over MFN," Vance argued optimistically in his 
memorandum, "we will have restored the economic option to our 
tools for dealing with Moscow, and we will have strengthened 
the hand of those in the USSR Who favor detente as a path to 
modernizing the economic and social system."26 
Expectations of a trade agreement resulted in a State 
Department plan that Blumenthal and Juanita Kreps, Secretary of 
Commerce, be present at the summit. Brzezinski, however, knew 
that Vance did not believe in linkage and was probably not 
serious about linking MFN to other issues. In any event, 
Brzezinski feared that the raising of the trade issue at the 
summit would deflect attention from what he considered to be 
more fundamental geopolitical questions. He wanted the

discussions with Brezhnev limited to "two simple themes--arms 
cuts and regional restraint," and prevailed upon Carter to 
leave Blumenthal and Kreps at home.27 
Vance also stressed Brezhnev's frail health as a limiting 
factor at the summit. At his worst the Soviet leader "would 
show the symptoms of growing senility." Even if at his best, 
Brezhnev could only endure two short negotiating sessions each 
day. In consequence, "actual negotiation on central issues is 
unlikely." Finally, Vance proffered advice on what the 
President should advance at each negotiating session in order 
to convey most effectively U.S. positions and concerns.28 
Discussions: Verbal Stalemate  
Carter and Brezhnev had morning and afternoon plenary 
sessions on June 16 and 17 and a brief private meeting on June 
18 immediately followed by a final plenary meeting on bilateral 
matters. They held the first two plenary sessions at the U.S. 
Embassy and the second two at the Soviet Embassy. The two 
leaders had their private meeting at the U.S. Embassy and then 
moved to the Soviet Embassy for the final plenary meeting. 
Vance, Brzezinski, one of Brzezinski's aides (Aaron or 
Bartholomew), Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, JCS Chairman 
Gen. David Jones, George Seignious, who had replaced Warnke as 
ACDA Director in early 1979, Ralph Earle, head of the SALT 
Delegation, Ambassador to the Soviet Union Malcolm Toon, and 
personal advisers Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell accompanied 
President Carter at the plenary meetings; while Gromyko, 
Dobrynin, Brezhnev's assistant A.M. Aleksandrov-Agentov, 
Defense Minister D.F. Ustinov, K.U. Chernenko, G.M. Korniyenko, 
W.V. Ogarkov, L.M. Zamyatin, and the head of the SALT 
delegation, V.P. Karpov, sat in with Brezhnev. Each leader 
also had his own interpreter. Except for Gromyko, who 
regularly participated in the discussions, Carter and Brezhnev 
did almost all the talking at these plenary sessions; but 
because each session was only 11/2 to 2 hours in length, 
presumably out of deference to Brezhnev's uncertain health, the 
two leaders had only about 10 hours of direct talks. The 
requirement for translation of each leader's remarks further 
constricted the time available for full exploration of the 
issues. Prospects for substantive achievements beyond SALT II 
were unlikely in this short period. Even their introductory 
meetings on June 15 and short luncheons and dinners together 
following the sessions on June 16 and 17 did not allow for more 
than pleasant, informal conversation and toasts.29 
Shortly after the delegations arrived in Vienna, Vance and 
Gromyko sat down on the afternoon of June 15 to discuss

unrescaved items for possible inclusion in the communique, but 
they made very little progress. Vance pressed for inclusion of 
annual summit meetings and frequent meetings at other levels, 
including between their military and defense leaders, a 
statement on "no victor in a nuclear war," advance notification 
of military exercises, prohibition on destruction of objects in 
outer space, the convening of a Second U.N. Special Session on 
Disarmament, and a U.N. role in the Middle East. Gromyko 
acceded, however, only to mention of more regular meetings and 
a continuation of the ASAT talks, a statement that "nuclear war 
would be a disaster for all mankind," and the holding of a 
Second Special Session to be followed by a world disarmament 
conference, which the Soviets had earlier proposed.3? 
Carter and Brezhnev first met that evening when they paid 
their respects to Austrian President Kirchschlaeger. Following 
the formal greetings the leaders of the two superpowers had a 
brief, private conversation during which they agreed that 
success at the summit was necessary for themselves and for the 
rest of the world. "If we-do not succeed," Brezhnev said, 
placing his hand on Carter's shoulder, "God will punish us." 
They talked again briefly that night at the opera.31 
The subject of the first plenary meeting on the following 
morning was the general state of U.S.-Soviet relations. Though 
President Carter was the host, selected in advance by a flip of 
the coin, and was supposed to speak first, Brezhnev interjected 
that he would speak first and proceeded to read a prepared 
statement.32 
Brezhnev conceded that there were problems in U.S.-Soviet 
relations but the two nations had been Allies during World War 
II. The two leaders needed to engage in frank and constructive 
discussions in trying to resolve their disagreements. "If we 
have good relations and mutual understanding between our 
countries," he stressed, "there will be peace, there will be no 
nuclear war, and jointly we will always be able to prevent 
that. And that we must do, I want to repeat and emphasize--we 
must." He said that his thinking on U.S.-Soviet relations had 
always proceeded from the principle of peaceful coexistence 
between nations with different social and economic systems. It 
was not necessary to exacerbate their differences and risk a 
nuclear war that neither would win.33 Pointing across the 
table at Vance, Brezhnev remarked, "He is the only one who does 
not want that." (Brezhnev's comment was probably intended for 
Brzezinski, not Vance, but he had confused the two.)34 
The Soviet leader also focused on the complete equality 
between the two nations underlying their better relations, and 
emphasized that the Soviet Union had no hostile intentions

toward the United States. He thought President Carter felt the 
same way, but he could not understand why the United States 
persistently built up its military forces which triggered an 
arms race. 
Carter responded that it was his highest goal to 
restructure U.S.-Soviet relations on a stable basis. He quoted 
Brezhnev's remark the previous day that God would not forgive 
them if they failed. He felt that often differences arose 
because of lack of understanding and of regular consultations. 
When he added that he sometimes had the impression that the two 
Foreign Ministers did not share the same objectives as their 
leaders, Gromyko protested: "That is a very bold statement." 
Carter conceded that competition would remain, but they needed 
a full discussion of the potentially destabilizing aspects of 
this competition. Neither side could dominate the other, and 
the arms race resulted in much waste of human and natural 
resources and the development of unnecessary capabilities. 
Brezhnev, who frequently interrupted to indicate his 
agreement with Carter, at this point interjected that Carter 
had already approved a greatly increased military budget for 
the coming year, so he did not know whether he should believe 
Carter's statement. Carter replied that he understood that the 
Soviet Union had steadily increased its expenditures for 
weapons of all kinds during the past 15 years and at a faster 
rate than that of the United States. Both nations, he urged, 
should exercise greater restraint. 
After a few further frank but amicable exchanges, during 
which Carter stressed the importance not only of SALT II but 
preparation for SALT III and further progress on MBFR, CTB, and 
other arms control issues, Brezhnev stood up abruptly and 
announced that it was time for lunch. Though the session was 
not scheduled to end for another half hour, Brezhnev's action 
resulted in early adjournment.35 
The focus of the second plenary meeting that afternoon was 
SALT II. In his opening statement Brezhnev emphasized the 
difficulties and compromises required in negotiating the SALT 
II agreement. He did not like everything in the treaty but 
felt it met the interests of both sides. After mentioning the 
requirement of unilateral statements by both sides, he handed 
over the Soviet statement on the Backfire bomber. He pointed 
out that the statement was a gesture in good will because the 
Backfire did not relate to arms covered in the treaty. If he 
United States in the same spirit should state that the 
production rate was 30 per year, he added, no rebuttal would be 
made by the Soviets. He then remarked that it should be clear 
that until the agreement entered into force, it could not be

binding on either side. He was confident the Supreme Soviet 
would xatify the treaty, but he expressed concern about its 
opponents in the United States. 
General Secretary Brezhnev further declared that Soviet 
military doctrine was defensive only and did not envisage first 
use of nuclear or any other weapons, and he invited a similar 
statement from President Carter. Such a public statement, he 
predicted, would be a rebuff to opponents of the treaty and 
those demanding amendments to it. He made clear that only the 
treaty as signed could go into force. 
He then raised the question of the MX. The Carter 
administration had announced its decision to produce and deploy 
this new missile only a week before the opening of the summit. 
Brzezinski especially worked assiduously to win the President's 
endorsement of the MX and for Soviet acceptance of one new 
missile system for each side in the SALT II treaty. He firmly 
believed that the administration's commitment to the MX was 
required to help to neutralize hard-line opposition to the 
treaty and in any case was necessary to counter the Soviets' 
growing superiority in land-based missiles.36 Frankly, 
Brezhnev stated, he did not see how the MX decision promoted 
the arms control objectives of the treaty. He added that the 
multiple protective shelters basing mode for deployment of the 
MX could not be verified and would preclude reaching agreement 
on SALT III. 
Brezhnev continued that SALT III would have to take into 
account additional concerns, especially long-range SLCMs and 
GLCMs limited only until the end of 1980 in the protocol of 
SALT II, U.S. forward-based systems in Europe, and the nuclear 
missile potential of NATO and China. How, he asked, were these 
countries to be associated with the process of limiting 
strategic arms? He thought that frequent references in the 
West to gray areas were very vague. He asserted that Soviet 
medium-range missiles and aircraft could not reach the United 
States, while U.S. weapons could strike Soviet territory. 
These were not simple questions, but SALT III would have to 
resolve which systems were gray and black. 
President Carter first responded by congratulating Brezhnev 
on his success in negotiating the SALT II agreement over many 
years with three U.S. Presidents. Because he believed the 
Soviet side had prevailed in these lengthy negotiations, he 
suggested that it was time for Brezhnev to be more generous to 
the Americans. Brezhnev responded, "I am ready." 
The United States, Carter continued, had no intention of 
deploying more than 20 cruise missiles during the term of the

treaty. Regarding Minuteman launchers, the President handed 
Brezhnev a copy of the agreed statement. He also stated that 
despite U.S. problems with the Backfire bomber, the United 
States had agreed to exclude it from the treaty. He understood 
that the Soviet side would not exceed the production rate of 30 
per year. Soviet agreement on this matter was the basis on 
which he agreed to sign the treaty. He also stated that the 
United States had the right to produce comparable aircraft. 
Carter then raised the issue of encryption of telemetry in 
missile tests. Gromyko said that the two sides had gone over 
this question hundreds of times and that the Soviets had agreed 
that there would be no encryption of information related to the 
parameters envisaged by the treaty. Any questions on the 
matter would be taken up by the Standing Consultative 
Commission. Brezhnev read a statement affirming Gromyko's 
interpretation. Following a brief exchange of the 
interpreter's choice of words, Carter remarked that he 
understood that encryption of information regarding the 
parameters envisaged by the treaty must not impede national 
technical means. He added that his administration had proposed 
discussion of these parameters, but the Soviets had refused. 
The President went on say that he was prepared to act as if 
the treaty was in force in accordance with international law 
pending ratification, if the Soviets would do the same. Both 
Brezhnev and Gromyko replied, however, that this was not 
general practice in Soviet treaties, and they would not agree 
to accede to the provisions of SALT II until it entered into 
force. Carter repeated that he would like to treat the 
agreement as well as the Threshold Test Ban Treaty as binding 
until ratification, and regardless of the Soviet decision he 
intended to take no action not consistent with the SALT 
Treaty. Brezhnev responded that their disagreement was clear, 
and they should go on to the next issue. 
Carter stated that they could agree to a joint agreement on 
non-first use of nuclear weapons, and Brezhnev confirmed that 
they could work on it. Carter argued that the MX was not 
nearly as formidable as the Soviet SS-18 or SS-19 missiles, and 
he recalled that he had already informed Brezhnev in a personal 
message that the MX would not be excluded from verification by 
national technical means. Finally, the extension of the 
protocol was a matter for negotiation, not presumption, at this 
time. Its terms were not to be assumed to set a precedent. He 
suggested they defer other issues, such as intermediate-range 
and forward-based systems and China, to the next meeting on 
SALT III and other arms control issues.37

In his opening remarks the following morning Carter argued 
that SALT II did not go far enough in limiting the arms race, 
and he outlined steps the two might explore together in 
curtailing it in their approach to SALT III. Because he 
thought improved verification increased mutual trust, he hoped 
they might agree to the elimination of all encryption of 
telemetry, notification of all missile flight tests and massive 
bomber exercises, the improvement of monitoring stations, and 
on-site inspection in certain circumstances. He also indicated 
the United States was prepared to agree to large reductions in 
the number of missile launchers and warheads and in 
throw-weight, and to explore the prospect of an immediate 
moratorium on the construction of new missile launchers and 
warheads. Prior to SALT III, they might look into the 
possibility of five percent reductions each year provided the 
reductions were balanced. 
Carter explained that he wanted agreements not only to 
reduce the number of nuclear weapons but to make the remaining 
ones less vulnerable. Ustinov interrupted to ask if it was not 
inconsistent to try to reduce the number of weapons while 
improving the quality of the remaining ones. Carter replied 
that making missiles less vulnerable to attack was an 
improvement only in a defensive sense, and he cited as a 
possibility an agreement making nuclear submarines immune from 
antisubmarine activities in certain ocean waters. 
He thought the two leaders could explore the possibility of 
further constraints on the modernization of weapons systems, a 
process started with the SALT II Treaty, and a prohibition on 
the testing of missiles in a depressed trajectory because they 
reduced the warning time of attacking missiles. He also wanted 
to proceed with a comprehensive test ban agreement, if 
necessary even without the participation of Great Britain, 
which objected to verification provisions. The United States 
would do everything possible to induce other nations, 
especially France, Britain, and China, to join in substantial 
reductions of nuclear weapons deployed. He argued that the 
absence of cooperation from other nations should not be allowed 
to interfere with their bilateral arms control efforts. 
The two nations, Carter continued, should also agree to 
sell nuclear fuel or technology only to nations that had signed 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and had agreed to 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. He 
indicated his readiness to sign a partial agreement with the 
Soviet Union on antisatellite (ASAT) systems that would 
prohibit the damage to or destruction of the other's 
satellites, and to announce publicly that neither side planned

to test antisatellite missiles or systems. Finally, he 
suggested that Defense Secretaries Brown and Ustinov could meet 
separately on MBFR to see if they could break the impasse on a 
definition of what constituted a soldier and other data that 
obstructed progress on these talks at Vienna. 
Brezhnev's presentation recited well-known Soviet positions 
on the reduction of nuclear weapons stockpiles and the 
comprehensive test ban. Regarding the latter, he hoped the 
United States could persuade the British to change their 
inflexible position. He also reminded Carter that on 
non-proliferation he had already written him -about U.S. plans 
to supply nuclear reactors to China but had not received a 
satisfactory reply. He blamed Pakistan for working on nuclear 
weapons and claimed that its argument of defense against India 
was a pretext. He believed Indian leaders' arguments, however, 
that they were reluctant to sign the NPT when Western nations 
were providing military support to China, which had territorial 
claims against India. 
After Brezhnev reviewed Soviet initiatives on MBFR, Gromyko 
added that the Western nations cited force levels in Europe for 
the Soviet Union and its allies more than 150,000 men (Ustinov 
said it was 180,000) higher than the actual situation. Carter 
reiterated that separate talks between Brown and Ustinov might 
be able to resolve this question at least for their two 
nations.38 (The two met that afternoon but made no progress 
on MBFR. During that meeting Ustinov also deferred for later 
discussion Brown's invitation for him to visit the United 
States as well as for exchanges of military personnel.)39 
Gromyko also expanded Brezhnev's remarks on the prohibition 
of new types of weapons of mass destruction. He thought 
prospects for an agreement on radiological weapons were 
encouraging. Negotiations on chemical weapons, however, were 
going badly. He thought they had to resolve the question of 
verification. Moreover, for such an agreement to be effective, 
all the major powers had to accede to it. He further 
complained that agreements on ASAT, conventional arms 
transfers, and Indian Ocean arms control were impossible on the 
basis of the current U.S. positions, though the Soviets were 
prepared to continue the discussions. 
Following Carter's short elaboration of the U.S. position 
on these regional issues, Brezhnev suggested that the two sides 
explore naval affairs, such as an agreement prohibiting their 
ships from cruising thousands of miles from their own 
territory. He mentioned that the United States had not 
responded to a Soviet proposal requiring the withdrawal of U.S. 
and Soviet ships carrying nuclear weapons from the

Mediterranean. He also said that he was willing to discuss 
advaRce notifications of strategic exercises of their military 
forces. He concluded by reading a paper which reiterated what 
he had stated on the Backfire bomber the previous day and added 
that the Soviet Union could not be bound by any U.S. unilateral 
interpretation of that statement. 
Carter replied that it had been agreed before Vienna that 
the production rate of the Backfire would not exceed 30 a year, 
but he had still not received that confirmation. When he 
directly asked for that confirmation, Gromyko argued that it 
had been agreed before the summit that Carter would state that 
it was his understanding that the Soviet Union would not 
produce more than 30 a year, and the Soviets would not rebut 
that statement. Vance also engaged in the argument, making it 
clear that the United States required an affirmative, not 
merely a nonnegative, statement from Brezhnev on the production 
rate. The General Secretary finally interrupted to state 
explicitly that the Soviet Union would not produce more than 30 
Backfires each year. Carter then confirmed that Brezhnev's 
statement resolved the issue. 
Carter pointed out in conclusion that Brezhnev had not 
responded to his several specific suggestions for SALT III, but 
he saw areas of agreement in Soviet willingness to halt 
production of nuclear weapons and reduce stockpiles, to adhere 
to nonproliferation and IAEA safeguards, and to move forward on 
CTB and MBFR.40 
The fourth plenary meeting on international issues convened 
late the same afternoon. The exchanges were wide-ranging, 
covering all contentious geographical areas. Brzezinski has 
written that in terms of substance this was the best 
session.41 Carter reviewed at some length U.S. vital 
interests in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula, and his 
concerns on Cuban activity in Africa sponsored and supported by 
the Soviet Union. He expressed his deep concern over Vietnam's 
incursions into Kampuchea and the Soviet Union's use of 
Vietnamese ports and facilities. He hoped, moreover, that the 
two sides would cooperate in supporting efforts of the peoples 
of Namibia and Zimbabwe-Rhodesia to select governments of their 
own choice. 
Carter also reviewed U.S. efforts to resolve differences in 
the Middle East, beginning with the U.S.-Soviet call to bring 
together all parties at Geneva. That initiative had failed 
because of opposition from Syria and other parties, but Sadat's 
dramatic trip to Jerusalem had resulted in progress between 
Israel and Egypt. He hoped that Security Council members,

including the Soviet Union, would approve a U.N. force to 
supervise Israel's proposed withdrawal from the Sinai. 
Carter also expressed U.S. support for the independence of 
Iran and Afghanistan and and his concerns about possible Soviet 
interventions in these nations. He also tried to assure 
Brezhnev that U.S. recognition of the People's Republic of 
China was not directed at the Soviet Union. He concluded, "I 
hope you agree with everything I said." 
Before responding on international issues, Brezhnev 
referred briefly to SALT III. That agreement, he stressed, 
should include not only the nuclear systems of the two 
superpowers but their allies as well, and all the factors 
determining the strategic situation needed to be taken into 
account in the follow-on negotiations. 
Regarding international issues he argued that the Soviet 
Union had no intentions to expand into Africa and Asia, and he 
complained at the loose talk in the United States of its vital 
interests on the other side of the globe. He conceded that the 
political situation in Europe had improved considerably under 
detente, although he complained that the United States should 
adhere to all the provisions of the Helsinki agreement and not 
just selectively to those that provided a pretext for 
interfering in the internal affairs of other states. 
Brezhnev proposed that the members of the CSCE should sign 
a treaty on no-first-use of nuclear or conventional arms. 
President Carter no longer responded to this issue, perhaps 
because several of his advisers agreed that "it would be a 
serious mistake to write a new non-first use pledge into the 
communique without first discussing it with our allies."42 
President Carter, Brezhnev continued, had already received 
his letters containing his opinions on the Middle East. He 
insisted that the U.S. policy was anti-Arab, and the 
Egypt-Israel treaty had actually increased the dangers of 
conflict in the Middle East. He argued that Israel, protected 
by Egypt, was waging a war in Lebanon that at any time could 
turn into a serious conflict. He was also resolutely opposed 
to the use of U.N. forces in the Sinai. A firm Middle East 
peace, he maintained, could only come about with the full 
liberation of Arab lands and creation of an independent 
Palestinian state. 
Not surprisingly, Brezhnev condemned Chinese "aggression" 
in Vietnam and praised the Vietnamese people's "heroic" rebuff 
to the invaders. He asserted that the Soviet Union was merely 
fulfilling its treaty obligations to Vietnam and denied the

known.fact that the Union had military bases in Vietnam. He 
added that he was pleased with events in Kampuchea whose people 
had "revolted and finally freed themselves from a regime of 
rapists and killers imposed by Peking." 
Brezhnev stated that the Soviet Union supported national 
independence movements in Africa but sought no economic or 
strategic advantages there. He also asserted that the social 
revolution in Afghanistan was entirely internal, even claiming 
that the Soviet leadership first heard about the revolution 
from foreign broadcasts and the wire services. Regarding Cuba, 
he reemphasized that the Soviet Union complied strictly with 
the 1962 understandings and denied that the Soviets were using 
Cubans to interfere in other areas. Cuba was an independent 
nation and provided assistance to other legitimate governments 
threatened by aggression. "Perhaps those in the U.S. who were 
so vociferous concerning the Cuban actions," he remarked, "have 
forgotten that during the American War of Independence the 
ranks of General Washington's army contained foreign units." 
Because their time was exhausted, Carter merely noted their 
differences on international issues and handed the Soviet 
leader a memorandum, which he had written following the plenary 
meeting on SALT III, containing a list of items that he wanted 
included in the follow-on arms control negotiations.43 
Only Brezhnev and Carter and their interpreters attended 
the private meeting the following morning. Brezhnev made a 
short statement complaining about the Carter administration's 
human rights policies, which the Soviet Union regarded as its 
internal matter, but spent almost all his time at this meeting 
talking about the U.S.-China relationship. Obviously 
preoccupied with this question, he emphasized that he did not 
object to normal diplomatic relations between the United States 
and China but would view anything more than that "with grave 
concern." He also objected to any linkage between human rights 
and trade. 
Carter in turn again raised the question of encoding of 
missile data. He emphasized that the United States had to 
monitor Soviet tests and might want to conduct overflights of 
Turkey for this purpose. Though he did not elaborate on the 
prospect of such overflights, Turkey had indicated to the 
Carter administration that it was willing to permit such 
overflights only if the Soviet Union agreed to them. In his 
response Brezhnev equated overflights of Turkey with Soviet 
flights over Cuba. He thought that the encryption issue should 
be discussed at the SALT III talks, though he said he would 
investigate the matter further.

Carter also raised human rights directly. He urged the 
Soviet leader to continue a more liberal emigration policy, and 
he asked for the release of Anatoly Shcharansky and other 
dissidents. Brezhnev reminded Carter of his previous statement 
on human rights but added that Shcharansky had been convicted 
in a Soviet court of espionage, and he was bound to support the 
laws of his nation.44 
The final plenary session lasted only 1/2 hour because 
both leaders had agreed that they did not want to delay the 
signing ceremony for the SALT II agreement.. After Carter had 
expressed his gratitude for the summit meeting and his hope for 
further progress on issues in the future, Brezhnev quickly 
reviewed the bilateral contacts in cultural, political, 
scientific, and other areas. Despite some difficulties he 
believed that they brought the two nations closer together and 
were mutually beneficial. 
Brezhnev singled out trade as a special area of concern and 
repeated his objections to any linkage between emigration 
policy, a purely internal affair, and trade. After noting the 
progress on the trade question at the 1972, 1973, and 1974 
summits, he complained about subsequent U.S. discriminatory 
legislation. While the U.S. Government had recently begun to 
examine the possibilities of normalizing trade with the Soviet 
Union, he emphasized that this was entirely an internal matter 
of the United States. He pointed out, however, that his 
nation's long-term agreements with several European nations 
could serve as a model for U.S.-Soviet economic cooperation. 
The Soviet Union, he noted, had an enormous market that would 
interest U.S. firms. 
He also claimed that the United States had raised 
"artificial obstacles" on air travel and maritime shipping. 
Carter noted that their time was up, but he promised to look 
into these problems and would respond through Secretary 
Vance .45 
The signing ceremony was impressive and dignified. 
Following the signing, Carter and Brezhnev shook hands and 
embraced. Carter was convinced that their personal feelings 
for each other were genuinely warm, and he was determined to 
continue his search for peace and understanding .46 
Results: The Unraveling of Detente

of June 18 and addressed a joint session of Congress that same 
evening. His speech, which emphasized the advantages of SALT

II for enhancing U.S. national security and international 
stability, opened what proved to be a lengthy debate over the 
merits of detente with the Soviet Union in general and the SALT 
II accord in particular.47 
Carter, Vance, and Brzezinski were well aware that the 
struggle for obtaining Senate advice and consent to the treaty 
would be long and difficult. Indeed, in his June 18 speech to 
Congress, Carter conceded, "SALT II will undoubtedly become the 
most exhaustively discussed and debated treaty of our time, 
perhaps of all time."48 Many Republican Senators, including 
possible Presidential hopefuls for the 1980 election, had 
already indicated that they would oppose the treaty, and it was 
likely that the Republican Party would make the treaty a 
partisan issue. Several Democratic Senators also had strong 
reservations about the treaty, particularly its verification 
provisions. 
Carter administration officials were sensitive to these 
domestic political concerns but believed that the treaty was 
fundamentally sound, would withstand the many criticisms from 
the political right, and finally be consented to by the 
Senate.49 They had already taken several actions which they 
thought would enhance prospects for the treaty. Carter, for 
instance, had regularly consulted with the Joint Chiefs and 
received their endorsement of the agreement. Their Senate 
testimony, he felt, might be persuasive. Moreover, when 
Warnke, whom some in the administration had regarded as too 
dovish, resigned as ACDA Director, the President, disregarding 
Vance's strong reservations, appointed Seignious, a retired 
Army general, as his replacement. The decision on the MX just 
before the summit, administration principals believed, would 
neutralize some of the opposition which was concerned about the 
Soviet Union's growing superiority in land-based missiles.50 
Their preoccupation with encryption of telemetry before and 
at the summit was in part a response to the critical importance 
Americans attached to verification. For the same reason Carter 
had raised with Brezhnev at Vienna the prospect of overflights 
of Turkey to monitor Soviet missile tests. Domestic concerns 
about the Soviet Backfire bomber also probably helped to steel 
Carter administration officials at the summit to insist upon an 
affirmative statement from Brezhnev on its production rate. 
Despite these measures the treaty debate intensified in the 
summer and fall. The revelation in late August of the 
existence of a Soviet combat brigade in Cuba, even though it 
had been there many years, was politically harmful to the 
Carter administration. As Vance later wrote, "in the political 
climate of late 1979, a rational separation of the brigade

TOP SECRET/NODIS  
22 
issue and SALT was not possible." Although the administration 
took several steps to defuse the issue, it lingered as a 
problem during the ratification debate.51 
The treaty, already in trouble, was dealt a decisive blow 
with the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan in late 
December 1979. This Soviet action confirmed the worst U.S. 
fears regarding Soviet behavior, and Carter asked the Senate to 
delay consideration of the treaty until his administration 
could assess the Soviet actions and intentions.52 (The 
Senate to date has not voted on the SALT II accord.) 
Analysts have advanced various explanations for the Soviet 
Union's invasion of Afghanistan. From the Soviets' perspective 
strong opposition to the SALT II treaty in the United States, 
the Carter administration's promotion of the MX, and the NATO 
announcement only a few weeks before the Soviet intervention of 
its decision to deploy Pershing and cruise missiles in Western 
Europe made even arms control with the United States very 
uncertain.53 Growing Soviet leaders' concerns that detente 
was already dying and that they therefore had little to lose 
from the West if they acted decisively in Afghanistan may have 
influenced their decision for intervention. It is likely, 
however, that the Soviet leaders decided to intervene primarily 
because of their perception of the deteriorating situation in 
Afghanistan and their security interests in that country. 
Whatever the specific reasons, the Soviets almost certainly 
underestimated the damaging consequences that ensued, such as 
the grain embargo, Carter Doctrine, and strongly negative Third 
World reactions.54 
With the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan and 
the United States response, including the grain embargo, the 
fragile fabric of "detente," which was already in danger of 
coming apart at the time of Vienna summit, began to unravel 
rapidly in the final year of the Carter administration.

(interpreter), June 26, 1979, on Vance-Gromyko Discussion 
of'Joint Communique, June 15, 1979, Shulman Files, Lot 81 D 
109 (S/Nodis); Carter; Keeping Faith, pp. 242-243. Cf. the 
Joint U.S. - U.S.S.R. Communique issued at the end of the 
summit, June 18, 1979, printed in Public Papers: Carter,  
1979, pp. 1081-1087. 
31Carter apparently quoted Brezhnev's remark, "...God will 
punish us" (Bog nas nakazhet), incorrectly as "...God will 
not forgive us," at the first plenary meeting the following 
morning. Note from Jack [Perry] to Peter [rarnoff], 
undated, Shulman Files, Lot 81 D 109 (U).' Carter repeated 
this incorrect version in his memoirs, Keeping Faith, pp. 
245-246. 
32Ibid. p. 246, says: "Because I was acting as host, I 
requested that Brezhnev make the opening statement;" but the 
memorandum of conversation by Krimer, June 16, 1979, of First 
Plenary Meeting, June 16, 1979, Shulman Files, Lot 81 D 109 
(S/Nodis) indicates that Carter said he would speak first, 
and Brezhnev nonetheless announced that he would speak first 
and proceeded to read his prepared statement. 
33Ibid.

Also, author's memorandum of conversation with Brzezinski, 
September 24, 1985. Brezhnev earlier conveyed his concerns 
on the MX in his letter to Carter, April 15, 1979, and Carter 
attempted to allay these concerns in his reply to Brezhnev, 
April 30, 1979, both in the Shulman Files, Lot 81 D 109.

Both Krimer and Brzezinski believed in retrospect that there 
was.a chance for a breakthrough on MBFR, but neither could 
recall the details of how this might have occurred. Krimer 
remembered Carter responding enthusiastically to Brezhnev's 
presentation but thought Carter's advisers, especially Harold 
Brown, persuaded Carter at the lunch just before the 
afternoon defense talks not to moderate the U.S. position. 
Brzezinski regretted that he had not taken more interest in 
this question. Author's memoranda of conversation with 
Krimer, September 18, 1985, PA/HO Files, and with Brzezinski,
