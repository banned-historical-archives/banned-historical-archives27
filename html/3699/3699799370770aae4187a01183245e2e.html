 27 MAY 1970
 INDOCHINA
 Mao Tse-tung's 20 May statement expressing support for Sihanouk's
 Cambodian government and the "revolution" gets voluminous publicity
 in PRC media, with accounts of a 21 May rally in Peking where
 Lin Piao read the statement and Sihanouk spoke as well, as reports of
 provincial rallies throughout the country.  DRV and Front riedia
 have carried the text of Mao's statement, accompanied by approving
 comment which notes Chinese support and assistance.  Soviet
 propaganda on Mao's statement says that "deeds" not "words" are
 what is needed and repeats the standard charge that the PRC
 has refused "Joint action" on Indochina.
 Moscow's failure so far to recognize Sihanouk's new government is
 pointed up on the 25th when TASS carries a statement made "on
 behalf of the Soviet Government to the Phnom Penh authorities"
 by Ambassador Kudryavtsev in Cambodia.  Warning that Cambodia
 will be p,.unged into a "long fratricidal ciVi] war" if measures are
 not taken to withdraw U.S. and Saigon troops, the statement says
 "those who connive" with the intervention "will bear responsibility
 for this."  It goes on to say that the USSR "will make conclusions
 for its policy" on the basis of developments--whether Cambodia
 "returns to the road of peace and neutrality" or "turns to unity
 with the forces o  aggression and war."
 Hanoi's first word of Sihanouk's visit to the DRV came early on the
 25th--the day he arrived-.-when VNA quoted a DRV Foreign Ministry
 communique of the 23d as saying he would visit the DRV "in the
 near future" at the invitation of President Ton Duc Thang.  DRV
 press articles and editorials on thc. 25th and 26th hailing the
 visit call the Prince the "great friend" of the Vietnamese people
 and reaffirm Vietnamese friendship and solidarity wi?'',b the Khmer
 and Lao peoples, as manifested during the April Indochinese summit
 meeting.
 Current Vietnamese communist propaganda reviews the two-month-old
 "Cambodian people's patriotic struggle," claiming that "over 40
 district capitals and military subsectors and hundreds of hamlets
 have been liberated" and more than one million people in those areas
 "freed."  Current Hanoi propaganda. also reviews U.S. "aggressive"
 policy on Indochina since World War II.
 VICTORIES CLAIMED IN CAMBODIA DURING PAST TWO MONTHS
 The second month's anniversary of Sihanouk's 23 Aarch call to arms
 to overthrow the Lon Nol government prompts a flurry of Vietnamese
 communist propaganda on 22 May reviewing the "Cambodian people's
 patriotic struggle."  A VNA review of activity is typical in claiming

 that "over 40 district capitals and military subsectors and hundreds
 of hamlets hav. been liberated" by the Cambodian liberation forces
 in Svay Rieng, Prey Veng, Kandal, Kompong Speu, Kompong Chhnang,
 Takeo, Kampot, Mondulkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng, Battambang, and
 Siem Reap provinces.  NHAN DAN's 22 May editorial says that the areas
 liberated "embrace over one million people" and t%iat "people's
 power" has be.n set up in many provinces and districts and hundreds
 of hamlets.  The editorial also claims that more than 24,000 enemy
 troops, nearly 2,000 of them American, "have been put out of action
 or disbanded."
 The NHAN DAN editorial says the allies did not accomplish their aim
 of reversing the situation by a "surprise attack" and by dispatching
 to Cambodia "nearly 100,000 U.S. and Saigon puppet troops."
 Persisting in the fiction that Vietnamese communist troops are not
 among the protagcnists. NhAN DAN claims that the Cambodian patriotic
 forces have developed rapidly and that "many units of the national
 liberation army have been formed along with hundreds of guerrilla
 arigades."  A measure of the effort to maintain the fiction is
 evident in a 25 May Hai.ni 'broadcast in Vietnamese to South Vietnam
 which cites foreign r us dispatchrs on the allied aim of clearing
 out "communist" sanctuaries in Cambodia.  The broadcast not only
 obscures the fact that the sanctuaries are Vietnamese in quoting
 AFP as saying "the communists have proven they have the combat
 initiative by launching a series of violent attacks in the Kompong
 Cham area," it goes so far as to insert an editorial note to the
 effect that "communists" means "the Cambodian patriotic armed forces."
 A Liberation Radio commentary on th~, 26th is even more blatant:
 discussing the operations in Cambodia since 30 April, it says the
 Americans have grossly exaggerated the quantity of weapons
 captured and their alleged annihilation of et,e.,.iy troops--"that is,
 troops of the Khmer Patriotic Armed Forces."
 On the 25th VNA reviews a NHAN DAN commentary which repeats the
 statistics in the NHAN DAN editorial on allied losses and goes on
 to discuss the "political isolation" of the United States which has
 resulted from the intervention in Cambodia.  The commentary says
 that "for the time being, the Nixon clique is unwilling to withdraw
 from the new morass in Cambodia" and that Defense Secretary Laird
 "has stated that after 30 June the United States would continue its
 air strikes and Saigon puppet troops would continue their operations
 on Cambodian soil."  The commentary sets out to "expose" U.S.
 actions against Cambodia over the past 15 years.  Other, similar
 comment includes a NHAN DAN commentary on the 23d which reviews
 U.S. policy on Indochina as far back as the 1943 Casablanca conference

 and concludes that President Nixon's "sophistries and lies show
 that Nixon is the most stubborn, brutal, and stupid among the U.S.
 warmongers in Indochina."
 There is little propaganda attention to specific, current operations.
 But Liberation Radio on the 26th carries a brief report on the 23 May
 allied air strikes against facilities of the French-managed rubber
 plantation in Chup, Kompong Cham Province.   Citing an undated
 AGENCE KHMER DE PRESSE dispatch, Liberation Radio says that a
 large number of the personnel were killed and that the plantation
 is completely inoperative.
 ACTIVITIES OF "PATRIOTIC" FORCES IN CAMBODIA REPORTED
 Liberation Radio on 22 May recounted a 7-8 May meeting held in a
 Cambodian "liberated area" by an organization affiliated with the
 United National Front of Kampuchea (FUNK).   Citing the FUNK's
 Information Bureau as its source, the broadcast said that delegates
 of the "Cambodian People's Movement of Militant Solidarity,"
 affiliated with the FUNK, met for the purpose of endorsing the
 3-4 May conference held in Peking in connection with the formation
 of Sihanouk's "Royal Government of National Union," the FUNK's
 Political Bureau, and its political progress.
 The three individuals who reportedly are in Cambodia as representatives
 of the FUNK and as government ministers were mentioned as being
 present:  Khieu Samphan, identified as movement representative in
 eastern CamLcdia and PLAF representative; Hou Youn as representative
 in northwestern Cambodia; and Hu Nim as representative of south-
 western Cambodia.  Other individuals were named as representatives
 of the People's Group (Pracheachon), as well as of such typical
 "front" bodies as the Kampuchea peasants association, the trade
 unions association, the democratic youth association, and the
 ethnic minorities association.
 On the 24th Liberation Radio carried the text of an appeal issued
 in the name of Khieu Samphan in his role as Minister of National
 Defense in Sihanouk's government.  Dated the 15th, the appeal calls
 on the Cambodian people and combatants to rally behind the FUNK.
 and its armed forces and resist the "U.S. aggressors and their
 henchmen."  Khieu Samphan also ridicules the notion that the Viet
 Cong headquarters is in Cambodia and that Viet Cong forces in
 Cambodia are threatening U.S. troops in South Vietnam.  The appeal
 says these allegations "have proven . . . false and deceitful"
 and aimed at concealing the collusion among the United States,
 Saigon, and Phnom Penh.

 DELEGATES AT PARIS SESSION AGAIN SCORE U.S. "ESCALATION"
 The VNA account of the 67th session of the Paris talks on 21 May
 notes that the PRG and DRV delegates "vehemently condemned" U.S.
 intensification of the war in South Vietnam and expansion of the
 war in Cambodia and Laos.  Both delegates also scored alleged
 U.S. provocations against the DRV.*  VNA reports that PRG deputy
 delegation head Dinh Ba Thi, speaking first, pointed out that the
 actual number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam has increased over
 the past month "by 5,000 men or so," notwithstanding President
 Nixon's 20 April announcement that 150,000 troops will be withdrawn
 by next spring.  Thi also complained that sweep operations continued
 along with B-52 strikes "even in provinces next door to Saigon."
 VNA glosses over most of Thi's statements on Cambodia, but it does
 report him as saying that the dispatch of U.S. troops there
 "cannot save the Saigon and Phnom Penh puppet regimes."
 LIBERATION PRESS AGENCY,** but not VNA, reports that Thi,
 citing "concrete evidence," refuted the Nixon Administration's
 "claims" that "it is pulling American and Saigon troops out of
 Cambodia and that it has recorded a big victory."  But VNA does
 report that Vy said the Nixon Administration is trying to pave the
 way both for a "prolonged military occupation" of Cambodia by
 U.S. forces, in disregard of its own 30 June deadline for an
 American pullout from Cambodia, and for the indefinite stationing of
 U.S. or Saigon "puppet" troops on Cambodian territory.
 Neither VNA nor LPA notes Thi's remarks on an anticommunist
 alliance of the Phnom Penh, Saigon, Vientiane, and Bangkok regimes.
 But VNA says DRV delegate Nguyen Minh Vy "exposed" U.S. maneuvers
 in setting up an alliance between those four "stooge" administrations.
 The VNA account also says Vy "exposed" the recent Djakarta conference
 on Cambodia, but it does not go on to note that he quoted at length
 from the 17 May statement of Sihanouk's "Royal Government of National
 Union" denouncing the Djakarta meeting.  In reporting the give-and-take
 Hanoi reported on the 25th that the DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman
 "energetically protested" U.S. "strafing" of Vinh Quang village, Vinh
 Li.nh area, on the 24th and the dispatch of aircraft to intensify
 encroachments on the DRV air space "during the past few days."
 **  Liberation Radio in the past has usually broadcast the full text
 of the PRG delegate's prepared statement, but no  account of the

 portion of the session, VNA says typically that the DRV and PRG
 delegates "laid bare the hypocritical allegations of the U.S. and
 Saigon delegates and denounced the so-called 'Asian conference on
 Cambodia' as essentially intended to serve the U.S. scheme of
 aggression."
 VNA says that Vy "denounced" the Nixon Administration for "its
 obstinate neocolonialist position at the Paris conference, thus
 blocking it after 16 months of negotiations," but the account
 fails to acknowledge that in this context Vy quoted former Defense
 Secretary Clark Clifford as saying in his current LIFE article
 that President Nixon "still seeks to gain the military victory
 that cannot be won."  The only available reference to Clifford's
 article in regular DRV media* is in a Hanoi radio domestic service
 news item on 18 May which quotes the article as saying that the
 United States cannot achieve a military victory in Vietnam and
 that a political solution is the only practical way to peace.
 The item also notes that Clifford appealed for a withdrawal of
 U.S. troops by the end of 1971 and "urged the U.S. people to
 pressure Nixon into changing U.S. policy in Vietnam."
 VNA does not acknowledge that Vy cited, and ridiculed, Ambassador
 Habib's reference at the 14 May session to President Nixon's
 30 April remark that the time came long ago to end the Vietnam
 war through peaceful negotiations.  And VNA's account of the
 allied delegates' remarks at the session simply says they "rehashed
 their allegations aimed at covering up the U.S. war of expansion
 in Indochina and the traitorous nature of the Thieu-Ky-Khiern stooge
 administration."
 LAOS     VNA's account states that at one point GVN delegate Lam
 "had to admit the fact that Saigon puppet troops had
 frequently intruded into Laos."  (VNA does not indicate the context
 in which Lam made this remark, which is not in his prepared statement.)
 DRV delegate Vy said in his prepared statement, as reported by VNA,
 that  in addition to the 12,000 U.S. military personnel in Laos
 "the United States has ordered many American units as well as units
 of Saigon mercenaries commanded by U.S. advisers to cross the
 border and attack Laos."  Vy did not refer specifically in this
 connection to the remarks on ARVN ground incursions by GVN Foreign
 Minister Tran Van Lam in a Djakarta press conference.  But Lam's

 disclosure and subsequent remarks by Secretary Laird, prompted
 statements by spokesmen of the NLHX Central Committee and the
 DRV Foreign Ministry on 21 May and of the PRG Foreign Ministry on
 the 22d.
 Peking and Moscow have both reported the Vietnamese and Laotian state-
 ments, and TASS also carries brief reports of the comments by Lam and
 Laird.  TASS acknowledges that Laird said the U.S. operations were
 "short-term" and "defensive," but an IZVESTIYA article charges that
 they are part of U.S. plans to escalate the war in Indochina.
 XUAN THUY     Hanoi radio on the 21st carried a report on the
 IN HANOI      activities of Xuan Thuy, head of the DRV delegation
 at the Paris talks, since his return to the DRV on
 17 May.  The account says Xuan Thuy reported to the party's Politburo
 and Secretariat and the DRV Council of Ministers on the status of
 the Paris talks.  It indicates that he defended the "fair and
 reasonable" stand of the DRV and PRG and "sternly" condemned the
 "obdurate, warlike, and perfidious" Nixon Administration.  It
 also notes that the Council of Ministers "unanimously endorsed''
 Xuan Thuy's findings and held that the DRV delegation at the talks
 during the past two years had "acted in accordance with the policy
 lines mapped out by the party an(  government."
 On his previous trip to the DRV in mid-1969 Xuan Thuy had also
 appraised the status of the negotiations in reports during June to
 Ho Chi Minh, the Politburo, the National Assembly Standing Committee,
 and the Council of Ministers.
 RALLIES THROUGHOUT CHINA SUPPORT MAO STATEMENT
 Mao Tse-tung's 20 May statement on Cambodia and Indochinese
 developments is supported by a massive Peking propaganda campaign
 which includes publicity for a 21 May Peking rally and provincial
 rallies throughout the country.*  At the Peking rally Lin Piao
 read Mao's statement, which had been released by NCNA some 12 hours
 earlier, and other speakers vowed "firm support" and "powerful
 backing" for the Indochinese people's struggle.  Sihanouk thanked
 the Chinese for their "invaluable support and many-sided and decisive
 assistance" and pointed to the determination of the three Indochinese

 peoples to continue the fight against the invaders in a "unified
 struggle."  He also stressed that the Khmer people are "prepared
 to persevere in a protracted people's war."
 The PRC provincial reaction to Mao's statement has been "unprecedented
 in scale," according to NCNA, which reports a major rally in every
 province and independent municipality.  Most of the rallies were
 attended by large numbers of provincial leaders.  The accounts of
 the rallies reflect the rhetoric of the national media, expressing
 confidence that the United States, beset with its own revolution,
 will soon be thrown out of Cambodia by the Cambodians.  Few of
 the speakers are quoted as going beyond Mao's expression of "firm
 support" for the Indochinese people by means of "concrete actions"
 (defined merely as increased production at home), although some
 do call U.S. aggression in Indochina "a serious provocation to the
 people of China."*
 MOSCOW RADIO COMMENTARIES ATTACK MAO STATEMENT
 Moscow condemns Mao's statement in some routine-level radio comment
 which repeats standard charges that the Chinese follow a splittist
 line and that Mac's words on support for the Indochinese people do
 not accord with Peking's actions.  Recalling the 4 May Soviet
 Government statement's call for strengthened unity, a 23 May
 Mandarin-language commentary  says Mao's statement shows up his
 stand as that of "a false revolutionary who vociferously clamors
 for opposing imperialism but who in reality is giving up such a
 struggle."  Struggling against imperialism with concrete action
 means giving "all-round aid" to the revolutionary fighters of the
 world and strengthening the solidarity of the socialist community,
 the commentary says, and it notes that Mao did not mention the
 international socialist movement or the "big socialist community
 of friendship."  The broadcast concludes with the charge that Peking
 "synchronizes" its activities with the imperialists, asserting
 that the United States invaded Cambodia soon after the publication
 of the 22 April Peking joint editorial which opposed the Soviet
 Union and other socialist countries.
 *  The 4 May PRC Government statement assailing U.S. actions in
 Cambodia and the "resumed bombing" of the DRV termed the U.S.
 moves a provocation against China, and the 28 April ?RC Government
 statement supporting the Indochinese people's summit conference
 renewed the charge that the Americans were trying to turn
 Indochina into a "base for aggression against China and other
 Asian countries."

 27 MAY 1970
 Another commentary broadcast in Mandarin on 22 May charges that Mao's
 statement is aimed at deceiving world opinion, exploiting world
 protests against U.S. aggression, and projecting an image of the
 Peking leaders .as "uncompromising fighters" in the struggle against
 U.S. imperialism.  The commentary denounces Mao's "pseuderevolutionary
 nature" and says his statement points up his splittist activities and
 his "hypocritical appeal for unity of the peoples of the world."  It
 notes that Mao has rejected suggestions made by the socialist countries
 for united action, and it recalls that at the international communist
 conference in Moscow last June Gomulna had said Peking's anti-Soviet
 policy made the Chinese anti-imperialist declarations "meaningless."
 Other Moscow comment, not pegged to the Mao statement, also continues
 to score Peking's policies in Indochina.  A domestic service commentary
 by Kapitsa on 23 May, charging that the United States takes advantage
 of Peking's splittism in various parts of the world, recalls that
 Peking refused a CPSU-VWP suggestion that the USSR, the DRV, and the
 PRC "iss.ue a joint warning against American aggression" (ICapitsa offers
 no further elaboration), as well as other proposals by socialist
 states for united action in Vietnam.,   Kapitsa repeats the charge that
 Peking's anti-Sovietism created the circumstances for the coup that
 overthrew Sihanouk in Cambodia.
 Moscow also castigates Peking for its absence from the international
 conference to support the Laotian people's struggle, held in Cairo
 19-21 May under the sponsorship of the Afro-Asian Solidarity
 Organization.  A 24 May Radio Peace and Progress commentary in
 Mandarin notes that 160 delegates from 70 national and regional
 organizations attended and that "in view of the Maoist propaganda
 machinery's publications containing many statements supporting
 the world people's struggle," China should have sent a delegation.
 Criticizing the Chinese leaders for the "inconsistency" of their
 words and deeds;, the commentary repeats the allegation that Mao
 has "flatly rejected" the proposal for a "united front of the
 anti-imperialist forces" to aid Vietnam.  It adds that Mao is
 intensifying the "anti-Soviet, anti-socialist frenzy in China
 in an attempt to alienate the people of the Indochinese countries
 from their loyal friends, the Soviet Union and other socialist
 countries."
 *  Gomulka also charged at the conference that Peking had "broken
 the solidarity" of the world communist movement and said that the
 USSR now formed the "main barrier" to imperialist aggression.  He
 concluded with a call for unity of the world communist movement as
 the vanguard of the world anti-imperialist front.

 USSR CAUTIONS "PHNOM PENH AUTHORITIES" ON WAR POLICIES
 Moscow's cautious attitude toward the Lon Nol regime and its
 failure to recognize the new Sihanouk government are pointed up by
 the "statement on behalf of the Soviet Government" made on
 24 May by the USSR Ambassador in Cambodia to the "Phnom Penh
 authorities."  TASS, in releasing the statement on the 25th,
 says it was published in IZVESTIYA that day; the TASS press
 review on the 26th reports that it was published in the Moscow
 "papers."
 Expressing concern that "Cambodia is being increasingly drawn
 into the military conflict in Indoch:"na," the statement warns
 that "unless measures are taken to withdraw the U.S. and Saigon
 troops, Cambodia will be plunged into a long fratricidal civil
 war."  The statement says that "those who connive with the U.S.
 and Saigon intervention will bear responsibility for this," but
 it fails to name the Lon Nol government.  Similarly, without
 mentioning Sihanouk by name, the statement praises the "peaceful
 neutralist policy that was earlier conducted by Cambodia."  It
 concludes by warning that the Soviet Union "closely follows the
 development of the situation" in Cambodia and Indochina and
 will "make conclusions for its policy from the direction in which
 this situation develops--toward Cambodia's return to the road of
 peace and neutrality or toward its unity with the forces of
 aggression and war and the turning of Cambodia into a base of
 war against the neighboring peoples."
 This seeming veiled threat that the USSR might recognize the
 Sihanouk government if the Lon Nol regime does not follow policies
 acceptable to the Soviet Union is reminiscent of a remark by
 Kosygin at his 4 May Moscow press conference.  Asked which
 Cambodian government the USSR recognizes, he answered evasively:
 "We recognize the neutralist government of Cambodia.  We recognize
 as the government of Cambodia the one which pursues a policy of
 peace and not a policy of war."
 SIHANOUK LISTS REGIMES THAT RECOGNIZED NEW GOVERNMENT
 In his speech at the Peking rally on the 21st, Sihanouk stressed
 the legitimacy of his Royal Government of National Union, noting
 among other things that Mao's statement said the government had
 been recognized by "nearly 20 countries."  Sihanouk named 19--
 including Guinea, which was not previously known to have announced
 recognition--and also listed "the Laotian people represented by
 the NLHX."  The others named by Sihanouk had previously announced

 recognition:  the PRC, DPRK, Cuba, Albania, PRG, DRV, Romania, Syria,
 Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Algeria, South Yemen, Congo (B),
 Mauritania, and the UAR.
 In a remark that could be interpreted as critical of the USSR,
 Sihanouk expressed hope that in the days to come "the governments
 of other socialist, progressive, anti-imperialist, and antifascist
 countries" will give the Khmers "effective support," but he did
 not explicitly ask for recognition.  Sihanouk is not known to have
 mentioned his reported response to Kosygin's message greeting the
 formation of the united front of Cambodia; AFP's Moscow correspondent
 reported in a 12 May dispatch that Sihanouk "immediately" thanked
 Kosygin for his telegram but formally requested official Soviet
 recognition of his new government.
 DIPLOMATS' RETURN      The "triumphant" return to Peking of the Chinese
 TO CHINESE CAPITAL     and North Korean diplomatic personnel formerly
 in Phnom Penh, who had "overcome many obstacles"
 placed in their way by the U.S. imperialists and the "Lon Nol-Sirik
 Matak clique," was reported by NCNA on 25 May.  On the 27th NCNA
 reported a banquet for the diplomats hosted by Vice Premier Li
 Hsien-nien, at which Li stressed. the "unity" of the people of China,
 Korea, and the three Indochinese countries in their "common struggle"
 against U.S. imperialism.  He noted that all these countries are
 "fraternal neighbors linked by mountains and rivers" and that the
 current struggle against U.S. aggression "forges a closer link
 between us."  He reiterated that the 700 million Chinese people are
 the "reliable friend and powerful backing" and that the land of
 China is the "dependable rear" of the peoples of the Indochinese
 countries and of Korea.
 On the 26th the Phnom Penh domestic service reported the return
 home of the Cambodian diplomats formerly in China and North Korea.
 On 9 May Peking and Pyongyang had scored the Phnom Penh authorities
 for holding their diplomatic personnel as "hostages" until the
 return home of the Cambodian diplomats  representing the Lon Nol
 government in China and North Korea.
 VIETNAMESE COMMUNISTS THANK MAO FOR HIS STATEMENT
 ic,~ording to NCNA on the 25th, DRV President Ton Due Thang and
 First Secretary Le Duan sent a telegram to Mao expressing
 'heartfelt thanks" for his "firm support" to the Vietnamese people's
 war of resistance.  The telegram also says that the Vietnamese
 people, along with the Laotian and Cambodian peoples, regard
 Mao's statement as a document of "tremendous political significance"
 and are forever grateful for the PRG's "tremendous and valuable
 support and assistance."

 On the 27th NCNA reported that NFLSV Chairman Nguyen IIuu Tho and
 PRG President IIuynh Tan Phat also sent a message expressing their
 "deep heartfelt thank" to Mao for "the new and most valuable
 support and assistance he has extended" in his 20 May statement.
 At this writing, Vietnamese communist media have not acknowledged
 either message.
 A Hanoi domestic service commentary on 21 May and a NHAN DAN
 editorial carried by VNA on the 22d also praise the Mao statement.
 The editorial warmly thanks the Chinese for their support and
 assistance but also stresses the importance of support and
 assistance given by "the fraternal socialist countries and the
 people the world over."  Similarly, an LPA editorial on 22 May
 concludes that the Indochinese peoples will be victorious with
 the support and assistance   of "the people of China, the Soviet
 Union, the other socialist countries, the nationalist countries,
 and the progressive people the world over, including the American
 people."
 PRC-DRV SUPPLEMENTAL AID AGREEMENT SIGNED IN PEKING
 Hanoi and Peking media reported on 26 May that a new protocol on
 "China's supplementary nonrefundable economic and military aid to
 VietnFun for 1970" was signed in Peking the preceding day by DRV
 Vice Foreign Trade Minister Ly Ban and PRC Vice Foreign Trade
 Minister Li Chiang.  The last regular annual PRC-DRV aid agreement
 was signed by DRV Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi last September.
 This is the first known special PRC-DRV agreement.*  In line
 with customary practice, the September 1969 agreement did not
 include trade, and a separate trade agreement was signed in Peking
 by Ly Ban in November.
 The current agreement represents the first instance in which Peking
 media are known to have specified military aid, although in 1968 and
 1969 Hanoi had described the agreements with Peking as providing for
 military as well as economic assistance.  In the past Peking
 acknowledged only that the agreements provided economic and technical
 assistance.
 *  Le Thanh Nghi made a special trip to the USSR in November 1968
 to sign an extra aid agreement in addition to the ones signed during
 his usual tours.

 VNA says  the Ly Ban delegation arrived in Peking "recently," but
 NCNA specifies that Ly Bari arrived in Peking on 2 May.*  Both
 VNA and NCNAi?eport that he left Peking on 26 May, having been
 received by Chou En-lai during his visit.
 SIHANOUK DELEGATION VISITS HANOI
 On 25 May Hanoi media released a DRV Foreign Ministry communique--
 dated the 23d--announcing that  Sihanouk would visit the DRV "in
 the near future" at the inviation of President Ton Due Thang.
 Sihanouk and his 18-member entourage arrived at 11:15 am local
 time on the 25th, according to VNA and Hanoi reports the next day.
 Soviet and PRC media have also announced his arrival.
 VNA says Sihanouk arrived at Hanoi's Gia Lam airport "on a special
 plane," but it does no,,t specify that lie had come from Peking.
 He was met by an official delegation including Premier Phan Van
 Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Nguyen Duy Trinh, and a group of
 Young Pioneers presented flowers to "Uncle Sihanouk."  Later, a
 welcoming reception at the Municipal Theater was hosted by
 President Thang and attended by Le Duan, Truong Chinh, and other
 leaders.
 In his welcoming address Thang praised the Prince and extolled the
 "great significance" of his visit to the DRV, adding that the
 visit is a good opportunity for the Vietnamese people to express
 their "deep feelings and sincere gratitude" toward the Cambodian
 people and Sihanouk for their "powerful support" of the Vietnamese
 struggle against the United States.  In response Sihanouk recalled
 his visit to the DRV for Ho Chi Minh's funeral last September
 and thanked his hosts for their current warm welcome--a "brilliant
 symbol of the total support" which the DRV and the Vietnamese
 people have "always accorded to the brother Khmer people and their
 legitimate government."  The Prince went on to assert that the
 three Indochinese peoples did not want this "second Indochina war,"
 but "it has been imposed on them by Nixon."  He added that
 acceptance of the U.S. challenge and unity-in-struggle among the
 Indochinese peoples constitute the "only way" left to achieve a
 total American withdrawal and U.S. respect for the three peoples'
 right to self-determination.
 *  The negotiations were presumably going on during Le Duan's
 10-12 May official visit to China after his attendance at the Lenin
 centenary celebrations in Moscow and his "rest" in Poland.  The
 first known mention that Ly Ban was in Peking was an 8 May NCNA
 report that he was among those who attended a performance the
 previous evening of a visiting DRV amateur art ensemble.

 A flurry of propaganda ti?elcoming Sihanouk includes articles and
 editorials in NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NIIAN DAN on the 25th and 26th
 and Liberation Radio commentaries which stress Indochinese solidarity
 and recall the April summit meeting.
 CONTINUED CRITICISM OF DJAKARTA CONFERENCE
 Communist propaganda continues to score the communique issued by
 the 11-nation Djakarta conference on Cambodia held 16-17 May,
 but only the DRV has issued an official statement.  A 25 May DRV
 Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement echoes the foreign ministry
 statement of the 14th in saying that the conference had not
 competence to deal with the issues.  Like a NHAN DAN article of
 the 24th, it acknowledges that the conference communique called
 for reactivation of the ICC as well as the reconvening of the
 Geneva conference and a UN role in Cambodia.  Initial Hanoi comment
 after the meeting had ignored the communique's reference to the ICC.
 Sihanouk denounced the Djakarta conference in his 21 May speech at
 the Peking rally, describing it routinely as a gathering of U.S.
 lackeys and satellites.  He also Axplicitly rejected the call for
 reactivation of the ICC and convocation of a Geneva--type conference,
 saying that the ICC and the advocates of a conference should
 simply compel President Nixon to respect the Geneva agreements
 and withdraw his troops from Cambodia and the rest of Indochina.
 The conference had been scored earlier in a 17 May statement of the
 Royal Government of National Union.
 Initial Moscow comment on the conference had termed the call for a
 Geneva conference "untimely" but did not mention the ICC.  The
 reference to the ICC is noted in a PRAVDA article, -ummarized by
 TASS on the 20th, which says cryptically that "one can raise the
 question of the revival of the ICC" but "one should not forget
 that many of the present participants" in the meeting are "active
 allies" of the United States and are "directly responsible for the
 frustration of the Geneva agreements."
 A 21 May Moscow commentary in English to South Asia reacts negatively
 to the notion of a conference on Cambodia without mentioning the
 Djakarta meeting.  It cites a Malaysian paper as seeking to "blame
 the Soviet Union for the aggression carried out by the ruling
 quarters of the United States," claiming that "if the Soviet Union
 had heeded the proposal of a number of countries to call another
 conference in order to insure Cambodia's neutrality" the United
 States might not have interfered in Cambodia.  The commentator
 remarks only that the paper has "naive" ideas about U.S. imperialism
 and that it is the United States which has failed to live up to the
 Geneva agreements.

 PEKING NOTES KUZNETSOV PRESENCE AT RALLY ON MAO STATEMENT
 Peking has again signalled its interest in sustaining the Sino-Soviet
 talks despite the recent bitter and authoritative polemical exchange.
 NCNA's report on the 21 May Peking rally in support of Mao's statement
 on Cambodia and worldwide anti-U.S. struggle singled out the presence
 of Soviet chief negotiator Kuznetsov and his deputy at the talks,
 General Gankovskiy.  Earlier, NCNA had similarly taken note of the
 presence of Gankovskiy at Peking's May Day celebrations, at a time
 when Kuznetsov was back in Moscow.  NCNA's 21 May mention of
 Kuznetsov is the first report on his whereabouts to appear in either
 side's media since before his visit to Moscow.  There have been no
 announcements on the border talks themselves.
 While drawing on the authority of Mao's name to pose as champions of
 people's war in Indochina and revolutionary struggle throughout the
 world--a posture that is evoking defensive sniping from the Soviet
 side--the Chinese have largely refrained from joining battle with
 Moscow since their attacks on the Soviets on May Day.  Propaganda
 pegged to the Mao statement, including nationwide rallies, has
 lacked any anti-Soviet dimension, as has recent Chinese comment on
 Indochina and the revolutionary movement generally.  A CCP message
 on the Indonesian CF's anniversary, transmitted by NCNA on 22 May,
 did raise one point in the ideological dispute by attributing the
 Indonesian communists' 1965 debacle to the line of peaceful
 transition "advocated by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique."
 This point was echoed in a statement on the anniversary by the
 Indonesian communist delegation in Peking, released by NCNA on
 the 23d, which also picked up Maoist cudgels to attack "Soviet
 revisionist social imperialism" as the "arch renegade to Leninism."
 Peking's efforts to break out of its isolation, which have been
 especially in evidence since Chou En-lai's visit to the DPRK in
 early April, are reflected in recent references -to ambassadors from
 Romania and Yugoslavia, two countries which followed the PRC's lead
 in supporting Sihanouk's government-in-exile.  NCNA's report on the
 21 May rally listed the Romanian ambassador among a group of favored
 guests, including envoys from such countries as Albania, the DRV,
 and North Korea.  On 23 May NCNA announced the arrival of a Yugoslav
 ambassador to the PRC, the first representation on this level since
 1958.

 PRAVDA's authoritative indictment of the Maoist leadership in the
 18 May editorial article sparked a flurry of attacks on Chinese
 policies in Soviet central media and renewed emphasis on the theme
 of Chinese war preparations and anti-Sovi'~- hysteria, muted in
 recent weeks.  Articles critical of the Chinese appeared in
 LITERARY GAZETTE on 20 and 27 May s.nd in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and
 TRUD on the 21st, and a succession of commentaries in Radio Moscow's
 domestic service beginning on the 20th presented a sustained assault
 on Peking's domestic and foreign policies for Soviet audiences.
 A report to a Komsomol congress by Komsomol leader Tyazhelnikov on
 the 26th declares that Soviet youth cannot remain indifferent to the
 fate of the younger generation in China and expresses regret at the
 rupture of contacts between Soviet and Chinese youth which occurred
 "not through the Komsomol's fault."  The report endorses Soviet
 efforts to normalize Sino-Soviet relations but does not mention the
 Peking talks.*
 Press comment portrays China as suffering under military repression
 and economic chaos and accuses Peking of fostering a myth of an
 imminent armed invasion to put the screws to the Chinese people.
 Without directly mentioning the Chinese space satellite, the papers
 take note of Peking's emphasis on rapid development of the war
 industry and branches of the economy connected with it;  KOMSOMOLSKAYA
 PRAVDA and TRUD both say resources are being used to develop a
 "nuclear missile potential" at the expense of consumer goods
 production.  The thrust of the criticism has been directed at the
 burdens being placed on the Chinese people rather than at depicting
 a threat to China's neighbors.
 Soviet sensitivity over Japanese bridgebuilding propensities toward
 the PRC is reflected in the LITERARY GAZETTE article on the 27th,
 which takes note of the role played by leaders of the ruling Liberal-
 Democratic Party in promoting Sino-Japanese trade relations.  Addressing
 what must be a particularly worrisome prospect for the Soviets, the
 article points out that American and Japanese leaders hope Japan may
 play a special role in building bridges between Pekiiag and Washington.
 *  Brezhnev also addressed the congress, but his brief remarks on
 international affairs did not single out any specific area other than
 to mention the youth movement in the capitalist -countries.

 Commentaries carried by the domestic radio criticize Chinese polici,:s
 along the lines of the PRAVDA editorial article, including charges
 that Peking substitutes ultrarevolutionary rhetoric for united act.; on
 and favors war as a means of advancing its interests.   A commentazy
 on 21 May sounded a note of alarm in taking Mao to task for
 irresponsible views on the role of war.   In the light of these
 views the process of militarization now taking place in China
 assumes an "especially ominous significance," according to the
 commentator, who went on to cite Chinese appeals to prepare for war
 against the Soviet Union, expenditures channeled into creating a
 nuclear-missile potential, and the use of threats and provocations
 against the "socialist and developing states."  A warning that
 domestic difficulties "may push Peking into new foreign policy
 adventures" was followed by the comment that "no one can guess
 the limits of these adventures."
 Characteristically, Moscow has limited publicity for Mao's 20 May
 statement by confining its comment to broadcasts beamed to China
 (discussed in the Indochina section of this TRENDS).

 MALAYSIA
 MALAYAN COMMUNIST PARTY PRESSES MAOIST CASE FOR ARMED STRUGGLE
 A thoroughly Maoist analysis of the revolutionary situation in
 Malaysia is advanced by the "Communist Party of Malaya" (MCP) in a
 Central Committee statement dated 25 April, broadcast in installments
 at both regular and dictation speeds by the China-based clandestine
 "Voice of the Malayan Revolution" (VMR) beginning on the 26th.
 Commemorating the 40th anniversary of the party's founding on 30 April.
 1930, the statement recasts the party's history in terms of the MCP's
 current, solidly pro-Poking orientation, presenting past periods of
 Soviet influence as aberrations and tracing the emergence of the
 present strategy of encircling the cities from the countryside
 and seizing political power by armed force.  The necessity to wage
 violent revolution has been a dominant theme of the "Voice" since
 it began broadcasting in November 1969.  Two companion themes of
 these broadcasts--the class basis of the antiregime struggle in
 Malaysia* and the need for a united front of members of the Chinese,
 Malay, and Indian communities under MCP leadership--are also
 elaborated in the statement.
 ARMED STRUGGLE     The statement's detailed review of the party's
 40-year history highlights two "serious errors,"
 both involving "giving up armed struggle."  The first, in the
 1945-48 period, is traced to the "right capitulationist line" of a
 "hidden traitor" in party ranks.  The second, in the late 1950's,
 is dubbed a consequence of collusion between "the renegade cliques
 of Khrushchev and Liu Shao-chi."  Overcoming both deviations, the
 statement declares, the party has affirmed that "only through violent
 revolution can the people of our country win complete liberation."
 It has exposed "the fallacy of the so-called 'peaceful transition,"'
 and it has reemphasized the need to pursue the road of surrounding
 the cities from the countryside in an armed struggle for political
 power.
 Consistent with Peking's refusal to recognize the formation of
 Malaysia, the VMR refers to the country as Malaya.  In a rare use
 of the term Malaysia, the statement refers to "our country" as
 currently consisting of two "so-called independent countries--the
 Federation of Malaysia and the Republic of Singapore."

 CLASS VERSUS       The statement depicts a long period of controversy
 NATIONALITIES      over tactics toward the various ethnic groups in
 Malaysia, stating that the MCP was unable "for a
 long time" to definitively settle the question of whether class or
 nationality is the motive force.  The Central Committee reasserts
 the conclusion, applied consistently in VMR broadcasts, that "in
 reality, the question of nationali.ties.'.is in the final analysis one
 of classes" and that "the class viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism-Mao
 Tsetung Thought is applicable without exception to the analysis and
 resolution of the race problem of our country."  Accordingly, the
 statement calls for a struggle by "the people of all nationalities"
 and characterizes the 13 May 1969 race-riots in Malaysia--as Peking
 media did at the time--as "a massacre of the nationalities" rather
 than picturing them as specifically anti.-Chinese.  Neither Peking
 nor monitored VMR broadcasts have taken notice of the first anniversary
 of the riots.
 Within the framework of the class analysis of the revolutionary
 situation, the statement elaborates,on the need for an MCP-led
 "national united democratic front" representing the interests of
 the people of all nationalities who make up the working class,
 farmers, petty and national bourgeoisie, and the "anti-imperialist
 patriotic" element.  Together with the MCP-led National Liberation
 Army, this united front is ranged against the landlord and bureaucratic-
 capitalist classes represented by "the Rahman-Razak and Lee.Xuan Yew
 cliques," the "faithful lackeys" of the United States and Britain
 and "Soviet revisionist social imperialism."
 BACKGROUND     The Voice of the Malayan Revolution began broadcasting
 on 15 November 1969 with reports and commentary in
 Malay  and Mandarin, adding programs.5.in Tamil on 1 February.  It is
 currently on the air six hours a day, with broadcast time divided
 about equally among the three languages.  In keeping with the class
 approach that cuts across ethnic groupings, VMR does not tailor its
 broadcasts in the respective languages for the-specific ethnic
 audiences.  A daily monitored sample indicates that programming is
 identical in Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil.
 As a principal propaganda outlet for the MCP, the "Voice" gives full
 publicity to party statements.  It regularly protests the allegedly
 repressive policies of the "chauvinist" Rahman-Razak "clique"
 against "the people of all nationalities."  And it reports--with a
 time-lag of a few days to more than six weeks after the alleged
 event--successful actions by the party's "liberation army" against
 regime forces, crediting Mao's thought as the inspiravicn behind the
 movement.

 Peking, in turn, bases about three fourths of its propaganda output
 on Malaysian developments on VMR broadcasts, citing VMR as the source.
 While Peking media have not so far been heard to carry the lengthy
 MCP 1-0th anniversary statement, they have carried other items on the
 anniversary, credited to the "Voice," and a Chinese Central Committee
 message to the MCP Central Committee on the anniversary--dated 19 April
 and carried by NCNA on the 29th--illust rates the identity of the
 Chinese and Malayan Communist lines.  The CCP message, pledging the
 Chinese party and people's "resolute support of the Malayan people's
 revolutionary struggle," expresses the conviction that the MCP will
 persist in "the correct road of using the villages to surround the
 cities and seizing political power by armed force" and will continue
 to "frustrate the reactionaries' effort to sow national discord" and to
 rally "the people of various nationalities."  It also hails the MCP
 for upholding revolutionary principles and struggling against "modern
 revisionism with the Soviet revisionist renegade clique as its center."
 In hailing the party's historical struggles against British imperialism
 and the "liberation army's" more recent struggles against "Joint attacks
 by the Malayan and Thai reactionaries," the Chinese message reflects
 another recurrent theme of VMR broadcasts, which seek to discredit
 the Malaysian Government by linking it with the U.S., British, Japanese,
 and other "imperialist" powers and with such "reactionary puppets" as
 the leaders of Indonesia and Thailand.
 VMR's comment on international events follows Peking down the line.
 Thus the "Voice" plays up successes of armed revolutionary movements
 in India, Indonesia, Burma, the Middle East, and Latin America as well
 as in South Vietnam and Cambodia, concurrently assailing such policies
 as the parliamentary road to socialism, associated with Soviet tutelage.
 An 11 May MCP Central Committee statement on Indochina, carried by both
 the "Voice" and Peking's NCNA, calls the U.S. move into Cambodia "a
 frenzied provocation against the people in Southeast Asia" which
 revealed the United States as a "paper tiger" and showed the "complete
 bankruptcy" of the U.S. "frauds" regarding peace talks and troop
 withdrawal.  Charging U..S. collusion with "Soviet revisionist social
 imperialism," the MCP statement hails the summit conference of the
 Indochinese peoples  and the formation of Sihanouk's government-in-
 exile and forecasts the final victory of the three Indochinese peoples.

 MIDDLE  EAST
 KOSYGIN AFFIRMS CONTINUED "EXTENSIVE" ASSISTANCE TO ARABS
 Moscow has widely publicized Kosygin's 20 May reply to the joint
 message sent to him and to President Nixon on the 7th by the heads
 of state of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan following the annual summit
 meeting of the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) in Izmir,
 Turkey, on 6-7 May.  TASS carried the message on the 20th--without
 mentioning that it was also sent to President Nixon--along with
 Kosygin's reply.
 ISSUE OF        Kosygin regrets, in his reply, that there are "still
 WITHDRAWAL      serious obstacles  to relaxation of tension and the
 establishment of a lasting peace in the Middle East,
 adding that the Israeli Government "frustrates all efforts aimed at
 a political settlement" of the crisis and is "supported and
 encouraged by certain circles in the West."  Contrary to the
 22 November 1967 Security Council resolution, Kosygin says, the
 Israeli Government "still avoids making a clearcut statement on
 withdrawal of its troops" and on its agreement to comply with other
 provisions of the resolution.
 While elsewhere in his reply Kosygin agrees with the three heads of
 state that "it is necessary to.have undelayed withdrawal" of the
 Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories, his phraseology
 on Israeli avoidance of a "clearcut statement on withdrawal" is
 atypical and could conceivably signal some degree of modification
 of Soviet insistence on actual withdrawal as the key element in
 a settlement.  At a luncheon for a visiting UAR delegation in
 December Kosygin had called withdrawal an "imperative condition,"
 and in the 1 May PRAVDA Belyayev had reiterated the more explicit,
 recurrent Soviet line that "fulfillment" of withdrawal is the
 "cornerstone" of a peaceful settlement.  Kosygin's "clearcut
 statement" formula has not been repeated in routine-level Moscow
 comment and may have represented no more than an effort to exploit
 and fuel the recent debate in Israel over the government's
 refusal to commit itself to a withdrawal policy.  Subsequent
 to the release of Kosygin's statement, Podgornyy was quoted by TASS
 on 25 May as repeating the standard Soviet position in remarks to the
 new Syrian ambassador:  "We believe withdrawal of Israeli troops
 from all occupied Arab areas is absolutely essential for a settlement."
 There is no indication of any flexibility on the withdrawal question
 in TASS accounts of the Security Council debate on Israel's 12-13 May
 incursion into Lebanon.  On the 20th TASS cited Soviet UN delegate
 Malik as stating that withdrawal "to the positions held before
 5 June 1967"--one of the rather infrequent recent Soviet stipulations

 of the 5 June lines--is a "key matter for a peaceful political settle-
 ment."  Malik complained that "unwillingness to begin solving this
 central, main question" is the principal obstacle holding back an
 agreement of the big four in the consultative meetings.  He charged
 the U.S. representative in the Council with "steering clear of the
 question of complete withdrawal," which means, he said, that the
 United States is opposed to such a withdrawal.  TASS commentator
 Orlov msde the same point in observing on the 20th that the
 withdrawal question stands "at the center" of the Middle East crisis.
 Washington adopts a double-handed policy, Orlov said, professing
 readiness to agree in principle on withdrawal while "hastening to
 make stipulations demanding 'changes' or 'corrections' of the
 borders," in effect blocking the possibility of achieving a settle-
 ment.
 AID TO ARABS      Kosygin's reply to the three heads of state  goes
 beyond the u;iual vag'?.e Soviet propaganda pledges of
 "necessary" aid to the Arabs t,, strengthen their "defense potential";
 he had said in his speech last I-ecember that the USSR would combine
 a struggle for a political settlement "with the adoption of active
 measures to strengthen the defense potential" of the UAR and other
 Arab states.  He now declares that the Soviet Union is rendering the
 Arab states "extensive" assistance "so that they can successfully
 defend their legitimate national rights," and "we intend to continue
 exerting our efforts in this direction" with the aim of a settlement
 in compliance with all provisions of the November resolution.
 There have been propaganda references recently to growing Arab
 resistance to Israeli "aggressive acts" and to the increasing "defense
 potential" of the UAR and other Arab states.  Belyayev commented in
 the 17 May domestic service roundtable that things "are not going as
 smoothly and brilliantly as before" for the Israeli military on the
 Egyptian front, with "every provocation" meeting with a "firmer
 rebuff."  In reporting Nasir's May Day speech TASS had noted his
 assertion that the initiative now rested with the UAR; and a
 foreign-language commentary by Tsoppi on the 13th observed that
 Israel "has obviously began to lose the initiative in the conflict."
 Moscow failed to give further publicity to Kosygin's acknowledgment,
 in his I May press conference, that Soviet "military advisors" are
 attached to the UAR troops.  But another such acknowledgment appears
 in a TASS English report on the 20th of a press conference statement
 in Cairo by the UAR official spokesman.  TASS quotes the spokesman
 as saying, with regard to the Middle East situation and Soviet
 military assistance to the UAR, that "we have never denied the
 presence of Soviet military experts.  But at the same time we should
 like to point out that both the Soviet and UAR military efforts
 are defensive in nature."

 Soviet media apparently took no cognizance of recent statements by
 Soviet military attaches in the Arab countries, reported by Arab
 sources.  The MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY on 6 May reported the Soviet
 attache in Baghdad as declaring at a press conference that the
 Soviet Union provides the Arab armies "with the same arms that the
 Soviet armed forces use."  The next day Baghdad radio reported
 the attache as stating that the Soviet Government is embarked on
 "major action" to promote the Arab armies' military capabilities.
 He claimed, according to Baghdad, that the increased military
 strength of the Arab armies had so alarmed the "Zionist aggressors"
 as to "induce them to make false allegations about Soviet pilots
 participating in the defense of Arab territories."  The Soviet
 military attache in Amman was reported by Baghdad radio on the
 8th as stating at a press conference that the Arab countries are
 now strong enough to reply to any offensive and that the USSR
 "is prepared to extend any aid" to these countries' struggle
 against "Zionist aggression."
 EBAN U.S. VISIT SEEN AS STEP CONDUCIVE TO NEW ESCALATION
 Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban's 20-24 May visit to the United
 States--to seek deliveries of more Phantom jets, a big loan,
 and "wider military-political support," according to TASS commentator
 Tyssovskiy on the 20th--is viewed by PRAVDA's Belyayev on 24 May
 as "a step leading to a new escalation of the war in the Middle
 East."  This time, Belyayev adds, "Israel is likely to get the
 fighter planes it asks for, even though the White House declared
 that it has not yet passed a decision to this effect."
 A panelist in the domestic service roundtable on the 24th commented
 that President Nixon had declined "for tactical reasons" to
 give Prime Minister Meir a definite answer to her request for
 Phantoms last September, which Eban had come to renew.  Another
 panelist remarked that although nothing was stated officially about
 the outcome of E'ban's talks with the President and Secretary Rogers,
 "there can be no doubt that Israel was given an actual agreement on
 the delivery of new weapons.  Moreover, regardless of what is or is
 not stated officially in Washington, the Israeli aggressors receive
 everything they need from the United States."  In a 25 May foreign-
 language commentary, Soltan says Eban left Washington in a "good
 mood" and cites among contributory factors the scale of promised
 U.S. aid and Washington's "intention" to "force" its NATO allies
 at the 26-27 Rome meeting to grant Israel military aid.
 Various Soviet commentators have played up the report by Jack
 Anderson in the 19 May Washington POST on "secret deliveries of
 American bombs to the Israeli air force."  TASS commentator

 Tyssovokiy on the 20th, for example, said. Anderson's article lmpl!ed
 that Israel gets other armaments bcsicia., bombs, and a 23 May foreign-
 language talk claimed that "many observers" believe other arms are
 being supplied.
 On the matter of a political settlement, Moscow comment on the Eban
 visit notes that the foreign minister emphasized Israel's intention
 to defend and hold its positions along  the cease-fire line.
 Soltan's commentary on the 25th says Eban indicated thaL Israeli
 withdrawal from the cease-fire line "would be lunacy" and calls this
 typical. of "the arguments of the Tel Aviv extremists,"
 MOSCOW DECRIES NEW ISRAELI "PROVOCATIONS" AGAINST LEBANON
 True to form, Moscow has not reported the 22 May attack on an Israeli
 school bus by Arab guerrillas operating out of Lebanon.  TASS did
 report on the 22d, however, the Israeli artillery barrage on towns
 in southern Lebanon which took place less than an hour after the
 Arab attack.  The Israelis' "barbaric action," TASS said, was the
 second "provocation" against Lebanon in 10 days.  A Moscow broadcast
 to North America on the 23d remarked that this "new crime" occurred
 before the ink had dried on the Security Council resolution
 condemning the 12-13 May incursion--a "repetition of aggression"
 which can only be viewed as an Israeli retaliation against the
 Security Council resolution and as "a challenge to the United Nations
 and world public opinion."  Apparently, the broadcast added, "Israel
 intends to make such crimes a daily practice so as to cut off all
 roads to a peaceful political settlement of the conflict."  On 25 May,
 TASS cited the Lebanese military command for a report that Israeli
 armored units, supported by aircraft and artillery, had intruded
 into Lebanon on the 25th and that fighting was continuing.
 While Moscow remained silent on the guerrilla attack on the 22d, a
 panelist in the 24 May roundtable show commented that "at present
 tension is again being created on the Israeli-Lebanese border" and
 "we may expect a flareup of serious conflicts on this sector of
 the front."  The commentator said "there will certainly be a new
 provocation by Israel against its Arab neighbors."  A domestic
 service commentary on 26 May says the Israeli press is developing
 a "pretext for the next armed provocation," using "the hackneyed
 theme about actions of Palestinian partisans."

 NATO
 USSR SEES ATTEMPTS TO "TORPEDO" EUROPEAN SECURITY CONFERENCE
 A spate of Moscow comment on the 26-2'( May NATO foreign ministers'
 meeting in Rome features routine charges that Wawhingtorr in using
 the gathering to "dustily" the "nggreusion" In Cambodia.  Co-mncnta-
 tors also assail alleged U.S. efforts to involve the alliance further
 in the Middle East and the Mediterranean and deplore what is described
 as a negative NATO posture on the key question of European security.
 A lengthy TASS report on the 25th said that the gathering would discuss,
 "besides the question of spreading the military efforts of NATO," the
 Warsaw Pact proposal for the convening of an all-European conference on
 security.  Citing the U.S. and West European press, TASS added that
 alliance leaders would prefer not to discuss this question at all, or
 at least not to give priority to it, but have been forced to show a
 regard for European public opinion, which gives "increasing support"
 to the conference proposal.   To make the convening of a conference
 more difficult, '.PASS said, its opponents are resorting to various
 "ruses"--among others, suggesting balanced force and armament reduc-
 tions by the two alliances and proposing the creation of a permanent
 commission at the ambassadorial level for talks between NATO and
 Warsaw Pact countries.
 The following day, a Kozyakov commentary for North America touched
 on both pending proposals in the course of an attack on Washington
 for trying to "torpedo" the conference idea.  Kozyakov said that
 the first propcaal was already under consideration at the now-recessed
 Geneva disarmament talks and that the second "can hardly substitute"
 for a European security conference.  Like TASS, the commentary suggest-
 ed that both proposals are inter-bloc in nature and that a conference
 must include neutral states in Europe as well as members of NATO and
 the Warsaw Pact.
 The 25 May TASS dispatch was critical of those NATO circles who have
 suggested that a conference not be convened until the results of the
 FRG's bilateral talks with the USSR, the GDR, and Poland are clear.
 The "absurdity" of this attitude is obvious, the dispatch concluded,
 since the lumping together of these problems could mean an
 indefinite delay of the European security conference.  Earlier, a
 22 May PRAVDA article by Beglov on NATO's attitude toward a confer-
 ence had said that such a European meeting "will in no way hinder
 the parallel course of bilateral talks between individual states
 and also talks on disarmament through various channels."

 Several Soviet commentaries have pointed up alleged efforts to involve
 NATO further in the Middle East, Kozyakov charging that the Rome
 meeting "is working to knock together a new bloc in the Mediterranean."
 Kozyakov said Washington is showing interest in the Mediterranean for
 the same reason that it supports Israel--"to clamp down on the
 liberation movement in the area."  A commentary broadcast to Italian
 listeners on the 26th says an attempt is being made to restrict the
 session to a discussion of "artificial and even provocative questions,
 such as . . . the Soviet presence in the Mediterranean."  Asserting
 that the situation in the Mediterranean in recent years has worsened
 because of the "gross interference" of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, the
 commentary says the call for a unified NATO naval force is linked
 with Israeli "aggression" against the Arab countries and serves to
 prepare public opinion "for more active NATO Interference in the
 Middle East."  In defense of the Soviet presence, the commentary
 repeats the familiar arguments that the Mediterranean lies "close
 to the frontiers of the Soviet Union" and that Soviet forces there
 are hailed by Fall the Arab peoples."

 GDR LEAVES DOOR OPEN FOR MORE TALKS AFTER KASSEL SUMMIT
 The relatively mild tone of the 25 May statement by the GDR Council
 of Ministers on the 21 May Kassel summit meeting between Premier
 Stoph and FRG Chancellor Brandt suggests a twofold purpose: to leave
 the door open for future talks should the FRG become "realistic" and
 to regain a more reasonable posture for the GDR in the wake of its
 highly negative, sharply polemical attacks before, at, and immediately
 after Kassel.  Stoph. introduced no new proposals at Kassel, devoting
 his three formal statements almost entirely to bitter attacks on
 the FRG.  GDR media have made extensive use of several incidents--
 arising from disruptive crowds, the tearing down of a GDR flag, and
 alleged threats to murder Stoph--to depict the FRG as an unreliable
 negotiating partner brimming with revanchism.
 Soviet media, while accurately reporting the substance of Stoph's
 attacks, omitted many of the stronger expletives and gave some
 balance to the picture by providing brief summaries of Brandt's
 press conference evaluations of the Kassel meeting.  GDR media
 carried no such reports of Brandt's appraisal.  Available comment
 from East European media concludes, as Moscow does, that despite
 the "more heated" polemics at Kassel as compared with Erfurt, the
 dialog will continue at some future date and Kassel should not be
 termed a failure.
 GDR STATEMENT     The GDR Council of Ministers concludes on 25 May,
 on the basis of Stoph's report on Kassel, that
 the FRG's "unrealistic attitude" as revealed, in the summit talks
 proves that the FRG needs more time to "reflect on its attitude
 and to arrive at a realistic viewpoint."  The statement asserts GDR
 readiness to continue "conversations by the heads of governments"
 (but by implication not by lower-level negotiators as Brandt
 proposed) "as soon as" the FRG Government "indicates a realistic
 attitude" on the basic question---the establishment of relations of
 equality under international law.
 The statement lays new, urgent stress on "equal membership" of the
 GDR and the FRG in the United Nations "forthwith."  This point is
 given new prominence in Stoph's final formal statement at Kassel,
 so far available only in a summary released by his press representative
 and broadcast by East Berlin's Deutschlandsender on the 21st.
 STOPH AT      An unscheduled statement by St oph, prior to Brandt's
 KASSEL        formal opening statement of his 20 points, expressed
 "astonishment" that FRG security forces had not stopped
 "fascist machinations" and "direct campaigns inciting to murder"

 against Stoph on his way to the summit meeting.  Stoph added,
 according to ADN, that such machinations would "necessarily
 encumber our meeting today."
 Stoph's major statement at the talks, carried textually by ADN,
 restates the stock demand for recognition by the FRG and reiterates
 willingness to sign the GDR's draft treaty "immediately."  Virtually
 the entire statement, however, is devoted to cataloging complaints
 and charges against the FRG, including accusations that Brandt
 remains "evasive," that his government has "revanchist aims,"
 that his words and deeds are "grossly contradictory," and that he
 has alined FRG policy with U.S. global strategy.  Stoph again
 denounces Brandt's proposals for "special intra-German relations"
 as "absolutely unacceptable" and rejects Brandt's concept of a
 continuing "unity of the German nation" as "fictional."  He says
 Brandt has shown nothing to indicate a "real change" or "genuine
 basic renovation" in FRG policy either in his speeches or in the
 actions of his administration.
 Stops rejects out of hand Brandt's proposals to set up lower-level
 negotiating commissions, arguing that "things being what they are,
 it would hardly be meaningful and would ignore the essence of the
 matter" to establish such working groups on matters of "second- or
 third-rate importance" before GDR recognition has been agreed upon.
 BRANDT'S         Stoph's first comment on Brandt's 20-point proposal
 "20 POINTS"      appears in his third formal statement, summed up by
 GDR spokesman Lorf at a press conference late on the
 21st.  Stoph says Brandt's statement of principles for a settlement
 shows that the FRG's "destructive attitude" will continue and
 "can only be regarded as a veiled but definite no" to the establish-
 ment of relations of equality under international law.  Stoph accuses
 Brandt of again evading this decisive point.  The conclusion of Stoph's
 third statement foreshadowed the Council of Ministers statement,
 suggesting that if the FRG Government "used the time ahead to
 ponder and reflect" on the establishment of normal relations with the
 GDR, "ways and means would be found to continue to exchange views."
 Stoph reiterated this view in his first interview after the summit
 late on 21 May, carried by the East Berlin radio, in which he
 claimed that "the most important point "--international recognition
 of the GDR--was missing from Brandt's points.  Stoph reiterated the
 GDR's readiness to continue the talks when the .?RG "gives evidence
 of a realistic attitude" on relations, but he d?d not spell out
 what such evidence might be.
 There has been little GDR comment on Brandt's 20 points, which were
 published as part of the text of Brandt's main statement at Kassel
 in the 22 May NEUES DEUTSCHLAND, according to the Hamburg DPA.  East

 Berlin commentator Leuschner on tie 21st termed the 20 points an
 "evasive maneuver" and "a collection of various minor issues"
 intended "to avoid international law, torpedo the draft treaty
 submitted by the GDR, and leave the basic question open."
 Moscow commentators have adopted a similar view of Brandt's proposal.
 Glazunov on the 23d told German listeners that the attitude expressed
 by the 20 points is full of contradictions and actually amounts to
 a rejection of the GDR's basic demand for recognition.  Panelists
 in the 24+ May Moscow domestic service roundtable spoke of the "total
 inconsistency" of Bonn's policy, adding that the attitude expressed
 at Kassel by Brandt revealed "still large vestiges of the past" and
 "a continuing strong dependence on-the policy of revanchism"
 inherited from his predecessors.  Brandt's concept of special
 relations between the two German states, one panelist said, represents
 an ultimatum-like stand intended to coerce the GDR and prevent its
 recognition in international organizations.
 EVALUATION OF      GDR and Soviet media take issue with numerous
 KASSEL RESULTS     West German commentators who called the Kassel
 summit a failure, arguing that its positive
 results included another meeting "as equals" of the heads of the
 two German states, another opportunity for Stoph to present the GDR
 viewpoint for West German and world public consideration, and
 finally the fact that the Kassel talks perhaps compelled Brandt
 and his advisers to realize the validity and firmness of the GDR
 stand.  Radio Moscow commentator Zakharov, addressing German listeners
 on the 25th, denied that the GDR has a "hard line" on recognition,
 as claimed by West German papers, and suggested that perhaps now
 Bonn will reconsider whether its own nonrecognition line is the
 real impediment to progress.
 Available East European comment on Kassel includes some expreosions
 of disappointment at the "meager results" but optimism that the
 talks will be resumed later, although no definite date was set for
 a third meeting.  A 22 May Prague CTK dispatch says the talks  have
 "only been interrupted for a time" and have not ended fruitlessly,
 but Czechoslovak commentaries find little evidence yet that Bonn
 has "recognized realities."  Warsaw's PAP commentator Guz criticizes
 Brandt's 20 points for omitting the "one most important point,"
 GDR recognition, calling them a "blurred formulation" with the
 "distinct features of a bargaining element."  Other Polish press
 comment on the 22d, reported by PAP, sees "no visible effects"
 from the talks at Kassel, which appeared to be a "tougher" East-West
 German confrontation than the one at Erfurt and to have produced
 "weaker" prospects for an understanding.

 MOSCOW REPORTS END OF GROMYKO-BAHR TALKS. AVOIDS COMMENT
 TASS reports the conclusion of the May round of talks between Foreign
 Minister Gromyko and FRG State Secretary Bahr on 22 May but continues
 to avoid commenting on their progress.  The 22 May announcement simply
 noted the "exchange of views" on questions connected with the
 "intention" of the two countries to conclude an agreement on
 renunciation of the use of force--the identical language used in
 TASS' 22 March announcement on the windup of the earlier round.
 There has been no Moscow pickup of widespread West German press
 and DPA reports of "optimistic" opinions by Bahr about the future
 success of the talks, Bahr's "favorable" assessment of progress,
 or speculation that Foreign Minister Scheel may soon go to Moscow
 to continue the negotiations.

 POLYANSKIY URGES MORE FOR AGRICULTURE IN NEW FIVE-YEAR PLAN
 First Deputy Premier Polyanskiy, agriculture's leading spokesman in
 the Soviet leadership, has appealed for increased stress on agriculture
 in the five-year plan now being drafted.  The new plan "must be a five-
 year plan for considerable upsurge in agriculture," he declares.
 Polyanskiy's present appeal is reminiscent of his repeated public
 demands for reallocations in favor of agriculture during a long
 Politburo debate over resources in 1967.
 Writing in the April SOVIETS OF WORKERS DEPUTIES (signed to press
 20 March), Polyanskiy affirms that the Central Committee and the
 Soviet Government are "now considering the preliminary materials
 connected with working out the new five-year plan." Kirilenko also
 mentioned the upcoming debate on the plan in a 14+ April speech in
 Yerevan:  "The Central Committee and Council of Ministers are already
 considering the direction" of the new plan, he said, and Gosplan and
 other organs are now completing the draft, "which will soon be debated"
 by the Politburo and government.
 Although Polyanskiy states that "the party and government are now
 doing the maximum possible" for improving agriculture and rural
 living standards in the new plan, he simultaneously argues that
 previous policy was less than fair to agriculture and should be.
 altered.  He says "it would be incorrect to attribute the dispropor-
 tions and disparities between the development of industry and
 agriculture and the lagging of the light, food, meat and dairy
 industries behind growing needs only to objective factors" such as
 "complicated international circumstances; . . . one must also
 distinctly see the shortcomings of a subjective character and
 eliminate them in good time."  The "tasks of creating an abundance
 of agricultural products" and "bringing the level of life of city
 and village closer together" require an alteration of priorities,
 he adds, and must find "a clearer expression" in the new five-year
 plan "than in the past."

 PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP TURNOUTS INDICATE SOME CHANGES
 Accounts of provincial rallies held to commemorate Mao's 20 May
 statement on Cambodia, the first event to produce a widespread
 turnout of provincial leaders since National Day on 1 October,
 indicate that a number of military leaders may have been shifted
 from their previous duties.  The rallies also brought forth some
 civilian leaders absent from public view in recent months--notably
 Li Hsueh-feng, Hopei chief and alternate member of the Politburo.
 In Inner Mongolia, which recently lost half of its territory to its
 neighbors, there was a further indication that the former military
 region is now a district under the Peking region.  The chief speaker
 and some of the other leaders present were identified by NCNA on
 23 May as "leading members of the Peking units of the PLA."  Inner
 Mongolia chairman Teng Hai-ching, who has not appeared in the region
 since October, remained absent.
 In Shansi, where almost the entire leadershipstructure seems to have
 been altered as a result of factional struggles since the days when
 it was a model revolutionary province, Hsieh Chen-hua was identified
 as the new PLA commander in an NCNA account on the 22d.  The long
 absence of Chairman Liu Ko-ping continued.
 Only in Heilungkiang and Shanghai, among the first half-dozen
 provinces and special municipalities to form revolutionary
 committees in the spring of 1967, did ?h^ old leaders appear.  In
 addition to Liu Ko-ping of Shansi, Peking chief Hsieh Fu-chih,
 Shantung chairman Wang Hsiao-yu, and Kweichow chairman Li Tsai-han
 failed to appear.  The only other provincial-level chief who did
 not appear, Li Yuan of Hunan, is a military commander and may have
 been transferred to other duties--as may also be the case with
 Inner Mongolia's chairman.
 One possible explanation for the absence of some provincial chiefs is
 that they are temporarily working in the countryside in line with
 recent exhortations in the national media.  On 25 May, however, NCNA
 took pains to note that Kwangsi chairman Wei Kuo-ching, "who is now
 working in selected basic units to get experience to guide overall
 work," attended a rally in Liuchou. And on the 24th NCNA reported
 that Sinkiang chairman Lung Shu-chin is "carrying out investigations"
 in Akosu district, where he attended a rally.

 EDITORIAL STRESSES PARTY LEADERSHIP OVER CREATIVE ARTS
 A joint RED FLAG/PEOPLE'S DAILY/LIBERATION ARMY DAILY editorial,
 released by NCNA on 22 May, highlighted this year's unusual
 celebration of the 28th anniversary of Mao's "Talks at the Yenan
 Forum on Literature and Art."  Except on the 25th anniversary in
 1967, observances of the occasion in recent years have been low-
 keyed affairs; in 1969 the anniversary drew no comment in central
 media, and in 1968 there was only one NCNA report.  This year's
 anniversary, by contrast, is receiving extensive national and
 provincial publicity.  RED FLAG No. 5 marked the 'nniversary by
 publishing a revised libretto for the opera "Red. Lantern" as well
 as a new piano concerto entitled "Yellow River."  The journal
 lauded Chiang Ching for her role in reforming literature and art.
 The joint editorial, on the other hand, neither mentions Chiang
 Ching nor dwells on revolutionary art and literature, but uses
 the occasion to push for greater party control over intellectuals
 while also attempting to revitalize the ideological rebuilding of
 the party.  Stressing a general need to remold one's world outlook
 through proletarian literature and art, the editorial refers
 specifically to sections from Mao's 1942 article which relate to
 current efforts to rebuild the party and overcome factionalism.
 The editorial condemns those cadres who joined the party organiza-
 tionally but "who have not yet joined the party ideologically"
 and hold to a "me first" attitude, form factions, seek personal
 advancement, and feel "contempt for physical labor."  To overcome
 these shortcomings, all party members as.well as revolutionaries
 who desire to join the party must remold their ideology "through
 a long and even painful process" of more class struggle and
 integration with workers, peasants, and soldiers, the editorial
 says.
 Reports on provincial rallies marking the anniversary spell out
 the intention to strengthen party control over intellectuals and
 to use the Yenan "Talks" as a guide for future party-building
 activity.  NCNA on 23 May, reporting on nationwide celebrations
 of the anniversary, noted that party members throughout the country
 expressed their determination "to solve the question of joining the
 party ideologically" by study of ti-is "important editorial."  NCNA
 pointed specifically to a Hunan provincial conference on party
 building--not previously mentioned in Hunan's pro-incial media--
 which after study of the joint editorial concluded that priority
 must be given to ideological rectification in the process of party
 building and that study of the "Talks" was "the fundamental way" to

 acquire the correct ideological outlook necessary for party membership.
 On 24 May Shenyang radio reported on a local rally at which the
 chairman of the Shenyang Municipal Revolutionary Committee stated
 that the article "is by no means limited to literary and art problems"
 and can be used in strengthening "the party leadership over cultural
 and educational work."
