 Clearly, the job vacancy program is no sub-
 stitute far effective private employment agen-
 cies and a strengthened.pubiic employment
 service; and it is no substitute for more long-
 range projections  of  manpower  Iieeda.  In
 general, the vacancy program wou18 comple-
 ment other manpower programs.  Perhaps it
 would displace the present area skill surveys
 which attempt to guide area planning and
 .manpower retraining programs.          ;
 Witnesses indicated that job listings at the
 Eanployment  Service  and  the  NICB  Index
 were not adequate substitutes for the survey
 and tabulation of job vacancy statistics.  Jab
 listings accounted for akrout 30 percent of all
 vacancies;  however,  the  extent  of  listing
 varied substantially from area to area.  The
 Index of ~ielp Wanted Advertising" does not
 have full~;GOVerage of occupations and areas,
 and there' is some overlapping of advertise-
 ments -tor the same position  in  numerous
 newspapers.  These indicators of  Job. open-
 ings do not perform the task envisioned Por
 the vacancy statistics.
 V.  RECOMMENDATIONS
 The subcommittee is gratified by the prog-
 ress  made  in  developing the concepts and
 procedures for the regular collection of job
 vacancy data.  It is an ewample of research
 responding to a practical need. `In addition
 to  the  extensive  work connected .with  the
 pilot  studies,  specialists from  government,
 the universities, private research institutions,
 and organized labor have contributed by way
 of  a conference  on The Measurement  and
 Interpretation of Jppb Vacancies 1 held by the
 National Bureau of &conomic Research, with
 support from the office of Manpower, Auto-
 mation, and Training.  Additional research
 on Measuring Job Vacancies has been com-
 pleted by the National Industrial Conference
 Board? on a grant from the Ford Founda-
 tion.
 After careful rev~ew and consideration, the
 subcommittee reca~Ilmends that the program
 of regular collection of vacancy data proceed
 as rapidly as possible, and particularly that
 it be expanded to the SO~major labor areas as
 recommended ?by ,the  Labor  Department.
 Significant progress has been made on the
 difficult problems  of  definition  and proce-
 dure,  although  there -will  undflubtedly  be
 continuing clariflce.tion and improvement as
 experience is gained.  It is time to expand
 the program further.
 It is difficult to conceive of a more obvious
 way to improve the amount of useful infor-
 mation available to, workers and employers in
 the labor market. ~ Such information would
 promote  efficiency  and  greater  equality  of
 economic opportunity.  In addition, it would
 feed the needs of tl~.e Nation's new and. grow-
 ing manpower development programs.

 this Douglas address that they wrote an
 editorial quoting from that speech as the

 I ask unanimous consent that the edi-

 point.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the R>;coen,
 as follows:
 WHAT ,SENATOR PAUL DOUGLAS LEARNED
 The 1966 commencement season finds the
 usual number of distinguished, middle-aged
 orators  seeking  contact  with  the  young-
 no doubt mostly in vain.  But among all the
 forgettable remarks there are some serious
 attempts to convey a modicum  of  wisdom
 from one generation to another.  And if any
 American is entitled to make that basic, old-
 fashioned kind of commencement address, it
 is Senator PAVL  DOUGLAa  of Illinois.  At 74,
 he can look back on a long career as a public
 servant,  as a distinguished  economist  and
 teacher, and as a soldier.  He was 50 when
 he  joined  the  Marines  as  a  private;  he
 emerged,  badly wounded at Okinawa,  as a
 lieutenant colonel.  "What do you think life
 and history have really taught you?" asked
 DOVGLAa of himself before the Amherst class,
 some 20 of whose members later walked out
 on Secretary McNamara  (see  p. 40).      "Are
 there any hints which you can offer us on the
 conduct of life2"  The lessons oP Paul Doug-
 las' lice are these:
 "That what is most needed in the world
 is 'love--ar  energized  good  will-which,  if
 given a chance and practiced with devotion;
 can in most cases melt antagonisms within
 a democratic society and reconcile opposites.
 "That truth has at once a compulsive and
 healing power.  We should not be afraid of
 truth, far if recognized and acted upon it is
 .the rock upon which we can base our Sndivid-
 ual  and collective lives.
 "That in its larger aspects  truth  is  not
 simple but subtle.  Frequently, it requires a
 long process of discovery both by the prab-
 ings of research and the sifting induced by
 dialogue.
 "That in dealing with the winds of doc-
 trine, in the words of Jefferson, `We should
 not  be  afraid  td tolerate  error  as  long  as
 reason be left free to combat it.'
 "That when aggression stalks either a com-
 munity or the world, resistance to it is both
 necessary and noble, lest it become all-per-
 vasive.   And  it  is  well  that  it  should  be
 checked in its early days before it can ac-
 quire the cumulative momentum of success.
 "That  human  courage  in  defense  of  an
 ideal is an ultimate virtue which we should
 not  permit the pressures  of  conformity to
 diminish.    The  nation  which  minimizes
 courage is on the road to destruction.
 "That  the  Athenians  did  well  to  make
 the owl and the alive tree their symbols to
 denote  wisdom  and  peace.        But  freedom
 tempered with lave is the only atmosphere
 in which true wisdom and peace can flourish.
 And to preserve and maintain all these vir-
 tues, astrong admixture oP Spartan courage
 is needed.  Thermopylae was necessary that
 AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO
 DISARMAMENT.   AGREEMENTS,
 SAY RUSSIANS
 Mr. CLARK.  Mr. President,lt is grati-
 fying to learn that despite the strong
 words used by Ambassador Roshchin at
 12551
 Geneva yesterday, the Soviet Union does
 not view the involvement of the United
 States in Vietnam as an insuperable ob-
 stacle to the successful negotiation  of
 arms  control and disarmament agree-
 ments.
 An  erroneous report carried, on  the
 wires yesterday indicated that Ambassa-
 dor Roshchin had said that there can be
 no treaty to stop the spread of nuclear
 weapons as long as the United States
 continues its military operations in Viet-
 nam.  As I observed yesterday in com-
 menting on this report, when I was at
 Geneva a month ago Russia made it quite
 clear that it did not consider Vietnam an
 insuperable obstacle to a nuclear dis-
 armament understanding.  If in fast the
 Russians had adopted the line attributed
 to them in the report, it would have been
 a most unfortunate change of mind.
 It now appears an the basis of infor-
 mation supplied by the U.S. Arms Con-
 trol and Disarmament Agency, support-
 ed by reports printed in this morning's
 New York Times and Washington Post,
 that despite their stronger language the
 .Russians have not in fact altered their
 position, and are not insisting upon the
 removal of U.S. troops from Vietnam as
 a precondition to a treaty.  The princi-
 pal obstacle to a treaty to halt the spread
 of nuclear weapons continues to.be what
 it  has  been  ali  along-this  country's
 shortsighted insistence on keeping open
 the option of cutting West Germany in
 on some nuclear sharing. arrangement.
 If the State Department will permit our
 negotiators in Geneva to agree with the
 Russians to keep the West German finger
 off the nuclear trigger, I am convinced
 that a treaty to stop the spread of nuclear
 weapons remains a live possibility, ,and
 an immediate one, too.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD the
 wire service story dated June 14, 19fi6,
 which was published in the Philadelphia
 Inquirer this morning under the head-
 line, "Accord on Arms Barred by Soviet
 Over Vietnam."  This is the erroneous
 report which I was given yesterday.  The
 correct version is reported in a story in
 this morning's Washington Post under
 the  headline,  "Russian  Blasts  United
 States, at Reopened Talks on Disarma-
 ment," and in this morning's New York
 Times under the headline, "Arms Parley
 Resumes in Geneva."  I also ask unani-
 mous  consent  that  these  articles  be
 printed in the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 RUSSIAN  BLASTa  UNITED  STATES  AT  REOPENED
 TALKS  ON  DISARMAMENT
 Soviet delegate Alexei A. Roshchin made a
 virulent attack on U.S. policy in Vietnam at
 the reopening of the 17-nation disarmament
 conference in  Geneva yesterday.
 U.S.  officials  in  Geneva  and  Washington
 denied that Roshchin made a U.S. troop wit11-
 drawal  from  Vietnam  a condition ,for any
 progress on disarmament.  United Press In-
 ternational and Associated Press interpreted
 Roshchin's remarks as making a U.S. with-

 West Germang?  He urged that the issue not
 be confused by becoming "obsessed with any
 one country:'
 The alternative to a treaty "is not a world
 with one or two new- nuclear-weapon states
 in, say, Svc years, but rather a world with
 perhaps ten new nuclear-weapon states in
 10 to 20 years," the United States official said.
 But Mr. Roshchin asserted that the United
 States desired to draft a treaty that would
 leave open the possibility of satisfying West
 German ambitions through an allied nuclear-
 sharing  arrangement.       He said  that  desire
 was blocking in accord.
 The Soviet delegate, who followed Mr. Fos-
 ter, began his speech by accusing the United
 States  of  having  increased  world  tension
 during the conference's recess by building
 up its forces in South Vietnam.
 "Continuous provocations" against Cuba by
 Washington  "also  arouse serious  concern,"
 Y.ie said.
 Mr. Foster replied by rebuking the Soviet
 delegate  for  beginning  the  new  round  of
 talks with a "propaganda blast:'  The Soviet
 Union, he said, would make a more x>seful
 Contribution to negotiate.
 Today's chairman, Antonia Gomez Robledo
 of  Mexico,  warned  that  ii  the  conference
 had no progress to report to the United Na-
 tions General Assembly session opening in
 September  another  forum  for  negotiating
 arms-control questions might be sought.

 ACCORD ON ARMS BARRED HY SOVIET OVFR
 VIETNAM
 GENEVA,     June    14.-A    virulent    Soviet
 attack of U.S. policy in Vietnam marked the
 resumption  of  the  17=nation  disarmament
 talks here Tuesday.  The tirade broke a tacit
 xxnderstaxxding that Vietnam should not be
 allowed to disturb the Geneva negotiations.
 Soviet chief delegate Alexei A. Roschin said
 at the meeting there can be no treaty to stop
 ca spread of nuclear weapons as long as the
 TJnited States continues its m[litaxy opera-
 tions in Vietnam.  Such a treaty is the main
 issue before the conference.
 PROPAGANDA BLAST
 Roschin's speech---one of the most bitter
 yet delivered 1n the 4-year-old conference-
 was  immediately  denounced  by  U.S.  chief
 negotiator William C. Faster as a deeply re-
 grettable propaganda blast.
 Roschin accused the United States of du-
 plicity in sending more troops to Vietnam
 for  what  he  called  a  merciless  campaign
 against peace in Geneva,  He said Washing-
 ton thus increased the arms race and is re-
 sponsible  for  prospects  of  no  progress  in
 Geneva.
 Roschin's predecessor? Semgon K. Tsarap-
 kin, had assured the conference earlier this
 year that the Vietnam conflict, though re-
 grettable  from  his  government's  point  of
 view, should not be allowed to disturb the
 negotiations       in   Geneva.  Tsarapkln      has
 since  been  appointed  ~?Imbassador to  West
 Germany.
 The disarmament talks are held in closed
 session.  Newsmen are. given only summaries
 of the speeches.
 Roshchin's  speech  was  immediately  de-
 nounced by U.S. delegate William C. Foster
 as  a  deeply  regrettable  propaganda  blast.
 Some observers were pessimistic about the
 chances o:f progress on disarmament when
 the Soviets took such a strong line at the
 Srst session alter asix-week recess.
 Roshchin blamed lack of progress in the
 Geneva talks  on the U.S. "aggressive  war"
 in Veetnam, "continuous provocations against
 Cuba,"'the project of sharing nuclear wea-
 pons with West Germany, and other actions.
 He  accused  Washington  of  fomenting  the
 arms race and trying to sabotage an agree-
 ment  to  stop  underground  nuclear  explo-
 sions.
 Before  Roshchin  spoke,  Foster  said  the
 time had come for East and West to recon-
 cile their differences and rivalries and work
 together for nuclear disarmament.  He added
 that preoccupation with short-term objec-
 tives only impeded agreement of a non-pro-
 liferation treaty.
 He warned that if the spread of nuclear
 weapons was not halted there would be per-
 haps 30 new nuclear powers in the world in
 30 to 20 years.
 Foster said the United States regarded as
 positive remarks by Roshchin, when the con-
 ference adjourned last month, that its work
 had not been completely useless.
 The United States also shared hopes ex-
 pressed  then  by Roshchin that new  steps
 could  he taken  to  break the deadlock in
 negotiations  an  a  nonproliferation  treaty,
 Foster added.
 Negotiations on a nonproliferation treaty
 are deadlocked over NATO nuclear sharing.
 The Russians refuse to accept a U.S. draft
 treaty because they say it leaves the door
 open for NATO to give West Germeny access
 to nuclear weapons.
 The West denies this and says it cannot
 subscribe to rival Soviet proposals that would
 Weaken or undermine NATO defensive col-
 laboration.
 [From the New York Times, June ib, 1966]
 ARMa PARLEY RESUMEa IN GENEVA
 GENEVA,  June 14.-The United States and
 the Soviet Union agreed on the immediate
 goals when the disarmament conference re-
 sumed today after a five-week recess.  How-
 ever, the two powers were in complete dis-
 agreement on how to reach them.  The re-
 sumption was marred by asharply-worded
 Soviet  attack  on  Washington's  policies  in
 Vietnam and on West Germany's alleged de-
 sire  for  nuclear  weapons.  It  brought  an
 equally sharp retort from the United States.
 William C. Foster of the United States and
 Aleksel A. Roshchin of the Soviet Union both
 gave priority to extending the present ban
 on nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in space
 and under water to underground explosions.
 They alsa called for a treaty soon to prevent
 the spread of nuclear weapons.  Mr. Foster,
 head of the United States Arms Control and
 Disarmament Agency, said at the 17-nation
 conference, which began In March, 1982, that
 Washington remained "strongly committed"
 to a ban on underground nuclear explosions.
 The United States delegate acknowledged
 that science had made "substantial progress"
 in developing ways to detect such explosions
 from a distance.  He added, however, that
 "hard evidence still points to the need for
 on-site inspection to verify a comprehensive
 test ban,"
 This was disputed by Mr. Roshchin.  He
 asserted ,that  the .United  States  advanced
 "groundless demands" for international in-
 spection in order, by preventing an accord,
 "to have a free hand for carrying on dan-
 gerous experiments with nuclear weapons:'
 When calling for a treaty to prevent the
 spread of nuclear weapons, Mr. Foster alluded
 to  the  Soviet  Union's  preoccupation  with
 "IINF'OATUNATE CHANGE"
 Roschin's statement led Senator JOSEPH S.
 CLARK,  Democrat, of Pennsylvania, who re-
 cently  returned  from  Geneva,  to  say  in
 Washington: "I think this Russian position
 represents  a  most  unfortunate  change  of
 mind.  When I was at Geneva a month ago,
 Russia made it quite clear that it did not
 consider  Vietnam  an  insuperable  obstacle
 to a nuclear disarmament understanding."
 When  Roschfn  took  over  more .than  2
 months ago critical remarks about the U.S.
 role in  Vietnam began cropging up in his
 statements and those of the delegates Pram
 Bulgaria,  Czechoslovakia,  Poland  and  Ru-
 mania here.
 But these asides, though sometimes stlxxg-
 ing, were. short and mild ~COmpared to the
 Soviet delegate's long and bitter statement
 Tuesday.  Western delegatian officials said it
 sounded like a concentrated recapitulation
 of every main criticism the Soviet Union has
 vodced against Washington during the past
 B months.
 SABOTAGE CHARGED
 Roschin  attacked  the  United  States over
 Vietnam,  the  project  of  Atlantic  nuclear
 weapons sharing with  West Gerrmanp,  ac-
 cused  Washington  of  fomenting  the  arms

 He  also  denounced  what  he  called  the
 "continuous  military  provocations  against

 international labor conference here.
 OUR AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN,
 EDWIN O. REISCHAUER
 Mr. AIKEN.  Mr. President, as every-
 one knows, the United States has .over
 100 Ambassadors working in the various
 capitals of the world.  It is not sui~xris-
 ing that no two of these Ambassadors
 are exactly alike, either in qualifications
 or in the manner in which they operate.
 Some are excellent.  Some are very good.
 Some are good.  Some are fair.  dcca-
 sionaily, one gets us into a lot of trouble.
 Mr. President, I am not going to at-
 tempt to classify U.S. Ambassadors in
 other countries, but I do wish to point
 out that one of the highest grade Am-
 bassadors we have in any country is our
 Ambassador to Japan, Edwin O.  Rei-
 schauer.
 Ambassador Reischauer has done a re-
 markable job fn Japan.  He has upheld
 the position of the United States ably
 and satisfactorily.  He commands  the
 respect of the Japanese people as well
 as the Japanese Government, and he has
 the respect of all Americans who know
 him.
 I have been disturbed lately to hear
 rumors that Mr. Reischauer might be
 replaced.
 Some of these rumors state that he
 wants to come home.  I do not know
 whether  that  is true.  Other  rumors
 state that someone wants him to come
 home and get out of Japan so that his
 place can be taken by someone else.
 I want to say that I most earnestly
 hope that Ambassador Reischauer does
 not want to come home and that no one
 is going to insist that he does come home,
 because if he should give up that. post
 for any reason whatsoever, it would be
 an almost irreparable loss to the U1lited
 States at this time.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD  an
 article which was published in the Bos-
 ton Sunday Globe of June 12, 1966, en-
 titled "Our Man in Tokyo-Reischauer
 Doing Superb Job."  It is an excellent
 article and I agree with the expressions
 which it carries.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 While the situation in  Vietnam re-
 mains unchanged, there is a very impor-
 tant hopeful sign regarding the larger
 Asian  picture.   A  conference  of  nine
 Asian  and Pacific  States  is  presently
 meeting near Seoul, Korea.  The partic-
 ipants  at this conference  are:  South
 Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia,
 Nationalist China, South Vietnam, Aus-
 tralia, New Zealand, Thailand, and Laos
 as an observer.  Both white and Asian,
 the participants comprise a group with
 many common interests in maintaining   _
 peace in Asia.
 I am particularly happy to see that the
 emphasis at this conference is more on
 the Positive and peaceful side than it is
 military and ideological.  This is an im-
 portant first step for the countries in
 that area of the world-a step in the di-
 rection of regional responsibility.
 I ask unanimous consent to have in-
 serted in the RECORD two articles concern-
 ing these matters which appeared in the
 New York Times of Wednesday, June 15.
 There being no objection, the articles
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

 reliable sources said today that the 20-man
 governing National Leadership Council had
 voted  to  limit  the  powers  of  the  coming
 legislative  assembly to writing  a constitu-
 tion.
 The  Leadership  Council,  which  was  re-
 cently enlarged by the addition oP 10 civili-
 ians, decided that the assembly, to be elected
 in September, would be dissolved as soon as
 it wrote the constitution.  That document is
 to be the  basis  of parliamentary elections
 next year.
 It had been reoprted earlier that the com-
 mittee drafting the laws for the September
 election suggested that the assembly be given
 limiEed legislative powers.
 KEY  ISSUE IN  THE  4LSPUTE
 The Buddhists have been demanding the
 legislative assembly act as a lawmaking body
 and  take  over  from  the  military  regime
 headed by Premier Nguyen Cao Ky.
 The issue lies at the -core of the Buddhist-
 Government dispute.    The  junta's decision
 was sure to bring violent protests Prom the
 Buddhists, observers said.
 They said the action apparently reflected
 the generals' confidence that they would be
 able to overcome the Buddhists.  Thus far
 they have.
 However,  Buddhist  demonstrations  con-
 tinued in the capital and Thich Phap Minh,
 a militant leader, told thousands oP cheering
 Buddhists that if Washington continued to
 support  the  Ky  Government,  "we  can  no
 longer accept the American presence."
 "If the Americans want to impose colonial-
 ism on our heads, we will fight it," he said.
 He asserted that the United States Ambas-
 sador, Henry Cabot bodge, and other Ameri-
 can  officials  "speak  with  the  mouth  of
 Buddha but from a snake's heart."

 ' '          CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                ~  June 1,~5, 1966
 We  are  net  turning  our  back  an  the
 Chinese Natianallst government on Taiwan
 which as a state and as a member ai the
 UN  must  be  assured  that  its  national
 integrity fs being fully respected.
 We  are  not  in  any  way  lessening  our

 m,ents by force, subversion and aggression,

 our military commitments to resist subver-

 We are  not in any way retxeating  cram
 our purpose or our determination in  Viet-
 nam-that its people should be in an atmos-
 phere of peace freely decide their own gov-
 ernmental future.
 We are not ~Seekin.g the approval ar agree-
 ment of Caminunist China, nor are we in
 fear of  Communist Chinese  rejection.         We
 are  continuing  our  peace  offensive  on  a
 breeder  and    more  inclusive  scale, facing
 realistically  the  real  problem-Communist
 China-and  conflctent  that  other  nations
 will realize that it is never embarrassing to
 face reality,  especially when  speaking and
 acting from  a situation of strength.
 I have no illusions about Peking's reaction
 to stitch a proposal  ar to any  other peace
 overtures-at this time.  Mao Tse-tung and
 the other old revolutionaries, liked as they
 are in the prison os their own dogma, will
 (respond  with _ hate  and  invective  in  the
 negative.  On March 3, Jenmin Jih Pao, a
 Communist  party  newspaper,  commented
 that the U.S. Senate debate on Vietnam was
 a "oilmouflage to hoodwink the people," and
 that both the "hawks" and the "doves" are
 "fools."   On  March  14,    Vice  President
 HurvieFIREY was treated with the same sort of
 disdain by the Communist Chinese leaders.
 The day  after he hinted that Washington
 tnay be prepared to adopt a policy of con-
 tainment  without  isolation,  the  Chinese
 E3ommuniat  leaders  called  his .suggestion
 the "kiss of Judas".
 As of now, the Red leaders are completely
 preoccupied with maintaining their doctri-
 nal purity. .They shun any formal contact
 with the "American imperialists."  They be-
 lievo  that  their  appeal  in  the  developing
 nations rests on an uncompromising ideology
 and  on  implacable  hostility  to  the  West.
 They are dead wrong in this belies.  Recent
 events in Cuba, where Castro has turned his
 lengthy diatribes against Peking, in Africa
 where the overthrow of governments which
 had. become ,too much under Chinese com-
 munist influence was greeted with immense
 Afrioan  approval, sand  in  Indonesia  where
 the  overwhelming  number  oP  IndAnesiahs
 have  risen  up  in  support  of  the  Army's
 efforts to prevent a communist takeover-
 all these events are testimony to the blind-
 ness of Peking's doctrine.
 Our  problerh is  to  bring  Peking to  the
 realization that not only has its dogmatism
 failed, but that its refusal to recognize this
 failure will be dangerous-to everyone oon-
 cerned.   Aa long as the Peking leaders re-
 main  entrapped by their own  propaganda,
 every conflict runs the risk oP escalation.  As
 long as then ideology provides no room far
 peaceful  coexistence,  every  small  dispute
 China has with another nation can become
 a full-blown confrontation.  This is not only
 true of Peking's relations with the West, but
 within the Communist world as well.
 How can we bring Communist China into
 the international .community of nations for
 the  purpose  of  making  peace  in  Vietnam
 without selling-out other peoples or our own
 ideals and commitments?
 The answer to this question must revolve
 around  a  general  policy  of  strength  and
 sensibility,  containment  but  not  isolation
 of the Chinese people.
 We  can  have peace  In  Vietnam  only  if
 the priorities of Pekixig are reordered.  To
 do this. we must maintain our strength while
 showing  our  willingness  to  negotiate  un-
 conditionally  whir  Communist  China,  as
 well as with North Vietnam and the National
 Liberation Front.
 COMMIINIST CHINA AND NUCLEAR. DISARMAMENT
 (Excerpts of the remarks of Senator JACOB K.
 JAVITa prepared for delivery at the Sixth
 Annual  Banquet  of  the  Iona  College
 Alumni  Association,  Comlmgdore  Hotel,
 New York City, 7:30 p.m., Thursday June 9,
 1966)
 Will Communist China join the commu-
 nity of nations?
 This,  in  the  1980's,  is  the  most  crucial
 question in respect of the future peace and
 suability of the world.
 The United States, the most powerful na-
 tion oa the face of the earth, must play a
 leading role in assuring that the answer to
 that question is, a positive one.  in mq opin-
 ion, we can help to bring about a positive
 answer by  our strength-moral  as  well  as
 physical-net our weakness by our patience,
 not our haste;  axrd by our reasonableness,
 not our inflexibility, and not by unilateral
 concessions.
 It will take tinge;  there will be frustra-
 tions, set-backs and even dangers, but the
 process  of  building bridges  between  Com-
 munist China and the world community must
 be pursued.
 Until now, however, I feel we have been
 mesmerized by the dream of some magical
 event-some mystical  world conference-in
 which all major disputes between China and
 the remainder of  the world may be elimi-
 nated at one stroke.  But the history of in-
 ternational relations demonstrates that the
 process of accommodation in relative peace-
 time between hostile nations is a piecemeal
 One.  It rarely happens at one stroke.  Pack-
 age deals  are  illusory,  and  complex diplo-
 matic problems must be treated separately
 and an their individual merits.  With respect
 to  U.S.  relations  with  the  Peking  regime,
 this means that both nations must learn to
 negotiate what is negotiable and we must
 learn to talk in some  areas while we may
 dispute in others.
 I have hoped-and continue to hope-that
 a breakthrough might come in Vietnam.  To
 this end, I have repeatedly proposed that the
 United Staten state its willingness to engage
 in  "unconditional  discussions"  with  Com-
 munist China with respect to Vietnam.  Un-
 happily, the Peking leaders, as well as those
 in Hanoi, show no signs of compromise.  The
 only hopeful signs in Vietnam come not from
 Peking os Hanoi, but from the prospect of
 genuinely free elections in South Vietnam.
 If these free elections are held as scheduled
 and if the South Vietnamese are able to sub-
 merge  their differences  enough  to  form  a
 reasonablq representative civilian and con-
 stitutional government, the cause of peace
 and freedom will be greatly strengthened.
 But the Tact that the aggressors in  Viet-
 nam are not willing to come to their senses
 does not require that the rest of our diplo-
 matic machinery come  to a halt.  Indeed,
 our government is quite frequently engaged
 in talks with Communist China at the Am-
 bassadorial level in Warsaw.  This contact is
 a vital one, but it is only one link.  In the
 nuclear age neither the Chinese nor the rest
 of the world should allow it to be the only
 link.
 I therefore,, propose another link.  I pro-
 pose that Communist China be invited to the
 Eighteen Nation Disarmament Conference in
 Geneva, if it will sign the Partial Nuclear
 Test Ban Treaty.
 Over 110 nations have already signed the
 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and it seems
 to me that Communist China should first
 assume these same treaty obligations, as so
 many others have, before discussions can be
 fruitful.
 The  Geneva  Disarmament  Conference  is
 making important but slow progress in sev-
 eral  areas.  The fssues  in  dispute between
 the U.S. and the Soviet Union in regard to
 the  nuclear  non-proliferation  problem  are
 now clearly focused.  The major obstacle to
 the  completion  of  this  vital  treaty  is  the
 question of  nuclear sharing within r1AT0.
 We want to find some way to satisfy tyre in-
 terests of our allies, and the .Soviet 77nion
 wants  to  guard  against  a  West  German
 finger on the nuclear trigger.  If NATO can
 agree to some internal arrangement based on
 the  principle  of  consultation  on  nuclear
 matters rather than  joint  ownership, there
 rs a good chance that the non-proliferation
 treaty could become a reality, probably when
 the acute Vietnam trials is behind us.  On
 the problem of extending the partial test ban
 provisions to cover underground tests, there
 are also some positive signs.  Signiflcarit ad-
 vances have been made in the technology of
 detecting  underground  nuclear  explosions.
 The key stumbling block, however, remains
 Moscow's refusal to accept the necessity for
 any inspections whatever of "suepiciouis ex-
 plosions," that is, explosions that are diffi-
 cult to distinguish from earthquakes.
 Communist China should hot be alllowed
 to make a propaganda circus of the Geneva
 discussion ii it joins them.  The best way to
 guard  against  this  is  to  give  the  Peking
 leaders some stake In the success of the talks.
 Signing the Partial Test Ban Treaty would
 be a step in that direction.  Permitting Com-
 munist China to introduce other issuers for
 discussion,  such  as  their  own  procls~imed
 interest in a "no first strike" nuclear agree-
 ment, would be another step.  Our own gov-
 ernxnent,  in  fact,  has  already  indicai;ed  a
 willingness to discuss this "no strike" issue
 if the Chinese would agree to step its atomic
 testing In the atmosphere.
 Inviting Communist China to the Geneva
 Conference as a way of adding to its links
 with- the  world  would  also  have  they  ad-
 vantage of not prejudicing the recognition
 problem.  The disarmament meetings ixr Ge-
 neva are independent of the United Nai;iona.
 Communist China's membership would not
 commit our own government in any way to
 recognizing this regime or to giving it mem-
 bership ixr the U.N.  Moreover, it woulci not
 be  difficult to  extend the invitation.   The
 U.S. and the Soviet Union, as co-chairmen
 of the conference, could make the offer.  Of
 course,  some provision must also be :made
 at that time to keep the proper balance at
 the conference between Warsaw Pact, NATO,
 and neutralist powers.
 I have no illusions about the likelihood of
 Communist China's response to the 1n.vita-
 tion.  It will probably say "No" to the of-
 fer,  and will  continue  to instigate  its so-
 called  "ware  of  national  liberation,"   But
 I also have no doubt that the U.$. skrould
 attempt to bring the People's Republic of
 China into a genuine dialogue an disarma-
 ment  and  other security matters.    Peking
 has recently exploded its third nuclear de-
 vice,  and the radioactive fallout from this
 explosion was  dangerously high.     Whether
 we like it or not, Communist China ia, fast
 becoming a nuclear power.
 On April 16, Secretary of State Ruak: laid
 down the principle of our policy toward ~Dom-
 munist China.  He said: "We must take: care
 to do nothing which encourages Pekirl~;-or
 anyone else-to believe that it can reap gains
 from its aggressive actions and designs.  But,
 at the same time, we must continue to make
 it plain that, ii Peking abandons its belief
 that force is the beat way to resolve disputes
 and gives up its violent strategy of world
 revolution, we would welcome an era of good
 relations."   I  subscribe  to  this  principle,

 represents my thinking on the situation
 iri Vietnam.
 In this address, I deal with the two
 mast .pressing  problems  in  Vietnam:
 First, elections; and second, escalation,
 Fair,  open,  and  free  elections  and  a
 speedy conversion to a caretaker civilian
 government are needed to give the gov-
 ernmerit _,of ~otlth Vietnam the legiti-
 macy the government needs and the pco-
 pie of South Vietnam want.  In regard
 to briflgin~ peace to Vietnam, positive
 and  constructive  proposals  should  be
 made to bring the conflict to the con-
 ference table.  My address contains pro-
 posals for a military freeze.
 I ask unanimous consent to Have my
 remarks printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE NEED TO,PREVENT ESCALATION IN SOIITH
 VIETNAM
 In such a setting as this, it Ss appropriate
 that we think of  our life purpose, bath as
 individuals and as Americans.  As individ-
 uals I am sure this purpose is on every mind
 and heart and I would contribute only little
 within  this  context  to  your  individual
 thoughts.
 But an. our purpose as a nation I can per-
 haps be helpful.. Because of our productive
 power, traditiar}s and geographic location, we
 are a natioxl that has. .fallen heir to world
 responsibility.,  Our  people  have  accepted
 slid carried out this role as being vital to
 our security and to our ideals-but we still
 feel uncomfortable with this responsibility.
 Yet, we are probably the first of the world
 powers in history that can sincerely demon-
 strate that we want nothing but peace and
 freedom  for  all  and the 'broadest ,possible
 .opportunity for all people.
 By now it is also quite true that we have
 no_doctrinaire, preconceptiolis  about social
 -arid economic systems and are perfectly will-
 ing to live in peaceful co-existence even with
 Communist  states,  provided  they  do  not
 practice  aggression  or  subversion  upon
 others,
 Within this context, it is proper to ask why
 Vietnam has become such an overriding issue
 Yn  our:  country.  'We  have  faced  military
 challenges `before, as for example, in the Ber-
 lin Blockade, the Korean War, and the Cuban
 missile crisis=but these seemed easier to ex-
 plain.               - .
 in Berlin, we had the full support of the
 Western world, and we were"defending un-
 equivocal rights of  access to this city.  In
 Korea, 'the North Korean attack across the
 17th  parallel was a clear case of aggression,
 end we acted as the major part of a United
 ' Nations Police I~'orce to repel the aggression.
 The Cuban missile crisis waa close to home,
 it was a clear attempt by the Soviet Union
 to alter the balance of power, and our allies
 came to our support immediately.
 Vienam is more difficult to explain.  As the
 threat  becomes  more  subtle  and the  area
 more distant from our traditional concerns,
 it' is harder to understand-but it is no less
 a  threat.  We  have  allies  in  Vietnam-in
 fact, those nations in the area, among others,
 which also. feel their security is at stake-
 but their number and capacity are limited.
 The point that troubles so many Ameri-
 cans is the unusual amount of disapproval
 11i. thg free world for the. position we have
 j;aken and the way we are carrying it on.
 All the moie_reason why our policy ixi Viet-
 ~nam' nee~is:to be spelled out and be clearly
 1xn;derstood by every American if possible-
 so grave is the issue, so critical are its im-
 plications.
 In reflecting on the first catastrophic year
 of World  War I,  Winston  Churchill wrote
 that "events passed very" largelg outside the
 scope  of  conscious  choice.  Governments       2. 'That the United States agree to cease
 and individuals conformed to the rhythm of      bombing in North Vietnam in return far a
 the tragedy, and swayed and staggered for-      North Vietnam and NLF pledge. to came to
 ward in helpless violence, slaughtering and     the conference table and negotiate for peace.
 squandering on ever-increasing scales .
 Reflecting  on  war  in  general,  Karl  von
 Clausewitz, the dean of military historians,
 warned that all  military conflicts  tend to
 outstrip  political  objectives and develop a
 logic of their own.
 Vietnam must not become a case in paint.
 My  own thinking  on  Vietnam has been
 governed always by four principles:
 First, that our cause of helping the South
 Vietnamese people to defend themselves is a
 lust one, and that our objective of allowing
 the  people  freely  to determine  their  own
 future should be pursued by limited mill- _
 tart' means.  The objective would make little
 sense if it led to the devastation of South
 Vietnam and a wider Asian land war.
 Second, that the conflict should end in
 somq kind of negotiated settelment, and that
 we must do all we can to bring all relevant
 parties, including Communist China, North
 Vietnam, and the National Liberation Front,
 to the baragining table.  This requires that
 our objectives be reasonable and our means
 measured; it does not mean unilateral con-
 cessions by the U.S.
 Third, that we should focus our energies
 on means to develop a freely elected, repre-
 sentative,   and  workable  government  in
 Saigon.  Only  such  a  civilian  government
 can  gain  legitimacy  and  acceptance  from
 the Vietnamese.
 Fourth,  that  if  there is to be no stable
 Saigon Government because the leaders of
 the various factions will not submerge their
 personal power drives for the common effort
 against a communist takeover, the U.S., not-
 withstanding its determination to  see  the
 struggle through, cannot remain in Vietnam.
 I feel the American people are flatly opposed
 to  U.S.  forces  fighting  alone-or  to  a U.S.
 takeover of South Vietnam.
 As I see the situation, then, we must pur-
 sue peace through strength and reasonable-
 ness in order to prevent the further escala-
 tion of the conflict, and we must help to
 stabilize and legitimize the Saigon Govern-
 ment in order to achieve our purpose-the
 social and economic reconstruction of Viet-
 nam under self-determination.
 PIIRSIIING THE  PEACE
 In order to prevent the- fighting from de-
 veloping alogic of its own and in order to
 avoid a condition where muitary  decisions
 determine  political  choices,  the  escalation
 of the  conflict must be ended.
 There .must be  a  military  freeze  before
 there can be hope for peace discussion to
 begin.
 I think it is important to distinguish be-
 - tween a military freeze and a cease fire.  A
 freeze simply means to fix a ceiling on the
 present  magnitude  of  battle,  particularly
 in respect to the introduction of new troops.
 At this stage of the Vietnam conflict, there
 is probably little hope for  a  prolonged ar
 extended cease fire.  More likely, as in the
 Korean War, fighting will occur during the
 negotiations themselves.  The establishment
 of a cease fire agreement and the details of
 policing it will also be the business of the
 eventual peace conference.
 To the end of bringing about discussions
 through  a  military  freeze,  I  would  make
 the following proposals:
 1. That, subject to international verifica-
 tion, the United States agree to stop send-
 ing  additional  troops  into  South  Vietnam
 in return for a North Vietnamese pledge to
 halt  the  infiltration of  their  soldiers  into
 South Vietnam.
 North Vietnamese infiltration is now ex-
 ceeding 6,000 per month.  U.S, troop- intro-
 ductions during the next twelve month pe-
 riod are likely to average 10,000 per month.
 At this rate, the already high casualties will
 double in a year's time.
 The  cessation of  bombing  1n  the  North
 should provide Hanoi with some face-saving
 reason for agreeing to talk.  It could also
 create a calmer atmosphere for the talks.
 3, That  the  Geneva  Conference  of  1954
 be reconvened in order to conduct the ne-
 gotiations, and that the NLF be allowed to
 sit  at  the  conference  as  an  "independent
 party ?
 I suggest the  Geneva Conference rather
 than  the  United  Nations  because  of  the
 fact that neither North Vietnam nor Com-
 munist China are members of the U.N. and
 would,  therefore,  object  to  a  U.N.  frame-
 work.  Moreover, the Geneva Conference, un-
 like  other possible  international  bodies,  is
 composed of nations that have a direct and
 intilnate stake in  Southeast  Asian  Affairs.
 That ie not the time to go looking for a new
 international  body-only  to  argue  about
 Composition and procedure all over again.
 These are my proposals, yet even as I make
 them, I am not sanguine about the possi-
 bilities of negotiations at this time.  Peking,
 Hanoi, and the NLF show no signs of willing-
 ness to end the struggle.    Their precondi-
 tions for negotiations are "immediate, com-
 plete,  unconditional  withdrawal  of  U.S.
 troops; ' and "the recognition of the NLF as
 the only legitimate voice" of South Vietnam.
 These are not negotiating points, they are
 ultimatums.          The  main  responsibility -for
 preventing a peace conference lies squarely
 on the communists' shoulders.
 The  U.S. has repeatedly sbated its readi-
 ness to discuss "anything with anyone", and
 no preconditions have been attached.  If the
 communists do not believe the sincerity of
 this offer, they have but to test us to find out.
 But the fact that we have made this open
 offer to talk does not mean that we are re-
 lieved of further responsibility.  The Presi-
 dent has an obligation to continually restate
 and  clarify our  objectives,  and  to  explain
 these 1n positive and realistic terms to the
 American people and the world.  In recent
 weeks, the U.S. people's "consensus" behind
 the President's  policy  in  Vietnam  has  di-
 minLshed.  I believe this is, in large measure,
 due to a sense of drift regarding the Presi-
 dent's conduct of the conflict and due to the
 frustration  generated  by  the  internecine
 quarrels among the South Vietnamese lead-
 ers.
 American people feel that the President has
 not been forceful enough in presenting U.S.
 interests in the current  South  Vietnamese
 power struggle.  I believe that the American
 people are losing patience with intramural
 power plays  in  Vietnam by local  military,
 political and religious groups, and that they
 .want the President to make this perfectly
 clear to the -South Vietnamese. . I  am not
 implying that our own people want the Presi-
 dent to dictate a solution  or  support  any
 particular faction or man in South Vietnam.
 What I am saying is that I believe the Ameri-
 can people want the President to state that
 unless these internal differences are settled,
 we cannot remain in South Vietnam.
 I  also believe that  the  American people
 are unhappy about the fact that the Presi-
 dent has apparently accomplished-little in
 .bringing the negotiating position of the Sai-
 gon Government on peace in Vietnam into
 line with our own.  Premier Ky has often
 stated that he will not discuss any matter
 with the NLF under any circumstances.  We
 cannot become tied to such an .unbending
 position.
 The thrust of what I am saying is that
 neither we  nor  the  Vietnamese  can afford
 the  luxury  of  taking  positions .that  con-
 tribute only to the escalation of .the conflict
 . and not to peace.

 ' '          CONGRESSIONAL .RECORD -SENATE                  June 1 ~ 1966
 -  ELECTIONa  AND  LEGITIMACY
 Free elections are the single most impor-
 tant elements in the future stability of South
 Vietnam.    If  the ;communist  leaders  con-
 tinue to- Yareclose the possibility of negatia-
 tlons, tree elections may be the only way for
 the  Saigon  Government  to  establish  the
 legitimacy it needs and the people of South
 Vietnam. ought to have.
 If  every  step  of  this  electoral  process,
 from campaigning to the installation of  a
 new government, is not conducted with the
 openness and fairness it deserves, hope Yod?
 bringing  peace  to  Vietnam  will .seriously
 recede. .
 T.he  various,  South  Vietnamese  factions
 seem to be  fighting primarily over power,
 and not over purposes.  The over-whelming
 majority of these same people do not want
 to be ruled by a communist dictatorship any
 more than a mllitary one.
 The South Vietnamese leaders moat learn
 that their quarrels only defeat their ends.
 I was pleased to learn last week that there
 are some hopeful signs in this regard.
 The Electoral Commission of South Viet-
 nam  has  properly  recommended  that  the
 Constituent  Assembly  to  be  elected  next
 September  should  "also  have  legislative
 power" and could transform itself into afull-
 fleged  parliamentary body if  the proposed
 constitution so provides.  It would be very
 unwise  for  the  military  junta  to  prolong
 unduly their own military farm of govern-
 ment; the transition to a caretaker civilian
 government should  be made as quickly as
 passible.
 Tlx6  Electoral  Commission .also  recom-
 mended that the Saigon Government request
 U.N,  observation of  the  elections.     This  is
 an important sign of good faith, and I hope
 that the U.N., notwithstanding the oppoe>r-
 tion of  the Soviet Union and Frasxce, will
 assume  this  responsibility.  Some  outside
 international supervision of the elections is
 mast desirable.
 It would  be appropriate,  in addition,  to
 call  for  a  cease 8re  during  the  period  of
 the  elections.         If  need  be,  this  cease  fire
 should be urxilaterlly declared.  All bombing
 should  stop,  and  U.S.  and  ARVN  troops
 should be ordered to fire only in -self-defense.
 While I am pleased that the Electoral Com-
 mission has asked the Saigon ,Government
 for a speedy transition to pivllian rule acid
 for international supervision of the elections,
 i am concerned by another of the Commis-
 sion's proposals.
 The Commission proposed that "those wlio
 directly  or  indirectly  are  involved  in  any
 activity favoring communism and neutral-
 .`   rsm , , ,should not be permitted. to stand
 as candidates."
 It is a dangerous practice to allow local
 officials to  determine  who. are included  ixr
 an abstract definition of  "communtsts anal
 neutralists."
 Also, tho election must be open to all--
 univorsal suffrage by secret ballot should be
 the basis of participation in the September
 elections, otherwise the results of the elec-
 tion  might not be truly representative of ail
 the South Vietnamese people.
 As a practical matter, however, we must
 realize that there are certain areas of South
 Vietnam in which it may be impossible to
 have Yrea elections.  Ail those who observe
 these elections-the U.S., the U.N., and other
 international bodies, and the whole world--
 will be able to judge whether areas so ex-
 cluded by the Saigon Government invalidate
 the essential fairness of the election.  The
 i3algon Government must, theroiore, be care-
 Ytll not to exclude areas in an arbitrary man-
 n~i'-and I hope our Government wlll make
 this clear, too.
 8houlfl the people of South Vietnam de-
 cide in these elections that they no longer
 desire II.$, assistance, we should withdraw.
 It is my belief, however, that the people of
 South, Vietnam ,will freely choose to retain
 our help in the  joint effort to bring about
 peace and freedom  and the social and eco-
 nomic construction of  South  Vietnam for
 which its people have sacrificed so much.
 Peace  is  an  elusive condition  in human
 affairs.  The history of man is dotted end-
 lessly by needless conflicts.
 Abraham Lincoln, in his Secorxd Inaugural
 Address, has given us the criterion; we have
 but to follow it: "Let us strive to finish the
 work  we  are  in;  to  bind  up  the  nation's
 wounds; to care for him who shall have borne
 the battle, and for his widow, and his ar-
 phan-to  do  all  which  may  achieve  and
 cherish a just and lasting peace among our-
 selves, and with all. nations."
 .THE  50TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE
 CHARTERING  OF  THE  BOY
 SCOUTS OF AMERICA
 Mr. HILL. ? Mr. President, -this is a
 memorable  date  for  the  38  million
 .Americans who have been or are now as-
 sociated with one of the greatest youth
 organizations in world history, the Boy
 Scouts of America.  It is likewise a date
 of great significance to our beloved Pres-
 ident pro  tempore,  the  Senator Prom
 Arizona CMr. HaYDEM,
 It was 50 years ago, on June 15, 1916,
 that President Woodrow Wilson signed
 into law the bill authorizing a congres-
 sional  charter for  the Boy  Scouts  of
 America.  Today is the golden anniver-
 sary of that event.
 CARL  HAYDEN  iS  the  One  Member of
 the 89th Congress who was also a Mem-
 ber of the 64th Congress, which approved
 .this bill 50 years ago.  He voted for it
 as a Member of the House, representing
 the State of Arizona.
 His vote on that occasion was but one
 of innumerable instances of CARL HAY-
 DEN'S  lifelong  concern  fOr  American
 youth.
 The bill chartering the Boy Scouts was
 introduced in the House as H.R. 755, and
 passed that body an March 6, 1916.  On
 May 31 of that year, it was approved by
 the Senate.  The bill was duly signed by
 the then Speaker of the House, the Hon-
 orable Champ Clark, of Missouri, and
 the Honorable Jolzn H. Bankhead, Sr., of
 Alabama,  then  Acting  President  pro
 tempore of the Senate.  The key section
 of that act read as follows:
 The purpose of t]ais corporation shall be to
 promote through organization, and coopera-
 tion,with other agencies, the ability oY boys
 to do things for tlYemaelves and others, to
 train them in Scoutrraft, and to teach them
 patrlotisnx,  courage,  self-reliance,  and  kin-
 dred virtues, using the methods which are
 now in common usee by the Boy Scouts.
 Congress has every reason to be proud
 of the action it took in 1916 in providing
 a Federal charter for the Boy Scouts of
 America.  AS Senator HAYDEN  himself
 has written:
 Judged  by  fts  outstanding  accomplish-
 ments, no organization has proved to be more
 worthy oP a Federal charter.
 By 1955, on the 45th anniversary of
 the  founding  of  the  American  Scout
 movement,  there  remained  only  four
 Members in Congress who had served in
 the 64th Congress, and who had voted
 irx 1916  to charter the Boy Scouts of
 America.  These four men, all of whom
 had made historic contributions to our
 Nation's progress, together issued a proc-
 lamation on February 8, 1955, celebrat-
 ing the 45th birthday of the Boy Scouts
 of America, and reminding the Scouts
 that the purpose for which their charter
 was created by the Congress "continues
 as your vital service to our beloved Amer-
 ica.."  The four signers of that proclama-
 tion wer Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the
 House of Representatives, Carl Vinson,
 chairman of  the House Commx'ttee  on
 Armed  Services,  Alben  W.  Bax?kley,
 former  Vice  President  of  the  United
 States and Senator from Kentucky, and
 our dear colleague, CARL HAYDEN.
 In  commendation  Of  CARL  HAYDEN'S
 leadership in the Scout movement, the
 National Council of the Boy Scouts of
 America, on June 14, 1962, awarded him
 Scouting's highest award, the Silver Buf-
 falo, for "distinguished service to boy-
 hood.,,
 On January 14 of this year, Seriator
 HAYDEN offered a resolution, Senate Con-
 current Resolution 68, which I had the
 honor to cosponsor, expressing the .sense
 of Congress on the 50th anniversary of
 the  chartering  of  the  Boy Scouts  of
 America.   The resolution  was ordered
 reported to the Senate from the Commit-
 tee on Labor and Public Welfare on Jan-
 10, and was approved by the House on
 February 21.  May I remind the Senate
 .that in adopting that resolution we: re-
 solved
 That the Congress hereby pays tribute to
 the Boy Scouts of America on the occuxaion
 aP the fiftieth anniversary of  the granting.
 by Act oP Congress of the Charter of the: Boy
 Scouts of America; and expresses its recog-
 nition  of  anal  appreciation  for  the  public
 service  performed       by  this   organization
 through its contributions to the lives of the
 nation's  youth.
 Mr. President, it is indeed deserving
 and fitting that the Boy Scouts of Amer-
 ica be so recognized on this auspicious.
 occasion for them, for the Congress, and
 for the Nation.  I am proud to have had
 apart in the resolution making this oc-
 casion possible and to have this op]POr-
 tunfty to add my words of personal ap-
 preciation  and  gratitude  to  the  Boy
 Scouts for all they have done thre~ugh
 the years for our Nation's youth. I salute
 our Boy Scouts of America on the :i0th
 anniversary of their chartering by C`an-
 gress and say to them as emphatically as
 I can, "Continue with the same energy
 and vigor that in the past you have so
 magnificently displayed to instill in the
 hearts and the minds of  our Nation's
 youth, at a time when it is so vitally
 necessary, the noble and lofty ideals of
 patriotism,  courage,  self-reliance,  and
 kindred  virtues  on  which  you  Nrere
 founded."

 .THE REAL REASONS FOR OUR PRES-

 Mr. MCGEE.  Mr. President, .the real
 res~sons for America's presence in South
 Vietnam are set forth quite realistically,
 I think, in a column Howard K. Smith
 wrote for. the Evening Star.  Smith asks
 if the United States is pleading its case
 fn Vietnam on the wrong grounds by
 emphasizing legal a moral reasons for
 our presence:  And  a prefers, as I do,
 to argue the case for our presence in
 Vietnam on the basis of political reali-
 ties.
 The "real and relevant" explanation
 for our presence in Vietnam, he says, "is
 that this is a power struggle the Loss of
 which would bring consequences awful
 to contemplate."  Mr. Smith states the
 consequences in this column, Mr. Presi-
 dent, and they are indeed awful to con-
 template.  I ask unanimous consent that
 the article be printed in the RECOen.

 Ia  UNTTED  STATES  PLEADING  VIET  CASE  ON
 WRONG GROUNDSP.
 ~            (By Howard g. Smith)
 Every successive opinion poll shows that
 our  appetite  for  resisting  in  Viet  Nam  is
 declining, and that President Johnson's stock
 with the voters is going the same way.
 One cannot help thinking that  the  ad-
 ministration is not putting Its case- to the
 American, people in proper terms:  OE sev-
 eral faults, one is outstanding:  The Preai-
 ient and Secretary of State Dean Rusk and
 their  colleagues  almost  always  justify  our
 effort fix Southeast Asia on legal or moral
 groixnda.  The fact is that the struggle there
 Ls essentially  and overwhelmingly  a power
 struggle which we would probably have to
 uYidertake regardless of law or'morality.
 This is Iaot to agree with the host of guilt-
 ridden oritics who believe our moral case is
 bad. ' Compared  witfx  our  foe's  case,  it is
 downright  good.          Ho  Chi  b11nh has  never
 f
 dared submit his regime to a free election
 such as we are pressing for uxxder U.N. in-
 spection in the south.
 His instrument of power has been terror-
 ism.  His "reforms" left the average North
 Vietnamese  peasant  considerably  worse  off
 that the average South Vietnamese peasant--
 until Ho made life in the south impassible
 by the murder of nearly all local officials and
 the systematic intimidation of the rest.  It
 is an eloquent fact that though war-weary
 South  Vietnamese dissent or riot or desert
 the forces, none go over to the Viet Cong.
 But the real and relevant explanation of
 why we are fighting is that this is a power
 struggle the loss of which would bring con-
 sequences  awful  to  contemplate:
 To make the point, consider what would
 happen, first if they, then if we, prevail.
 A Communist success, following an Ameri-
 can withdrawal, would be an "open-ended"
 result.  It would sharpen their appetite and
 despex?ately weaken the resistance of  neigh-
 bors  waiting  to  be  consumed.       It  would
 justify the basic motivation of their ideology
 which is blind faith in a world interpreta-
 tion  that  promises  universal  dominion  at
 the end of the road.
 The "domino" theory is much discredited in
 conversation.  But the facts of life are these:
 Laos and Cambodia are shot through with
 guerrilla forces trained where those naw in
 South  Viet  Nam  were  trained.        Our  AID
 officials in  Thailand  are watching a  guer-
 rilla minority, trained in the same place be-
 ginning to accumulate power by methods of
 pure  terror  in  northeast Thailand.
 China has made public the intention of
 adding Thailand to her bloc, and her actions
 over  many  years  make  clear  her  ultimate
 design of forcing the disintegration of India,
 the  only  possible  counter-force  to  China
 south of Japan.
 In short, a Communist success would be a
 destabilizing  event;  it would be bound to
 lead to further and worse conflicts.
 A success for our side, on the other hand,
 would  be  a stabilizing  result.    As  in  Eu-
 rope, we seek no .territorial gain.  Our aim
 is to find a line and establish the principle
 that we will not cross it to their detriment
 if they will not cross it either.
 In the age of nuclear weapons it is a para-
 mount  mission  to  establish  this  principle
 that borders may not be changed by force in
 Asia-just  as we  established  it in Europe.
 With  China  rapidly  becoming  a  nuclear
 power, we dare not relinquish the effort now
 by curtailing our force or withdrawing it.
 In his recent history of our times, Prof.
 Carroll Quigley makes the point that Germa-
 ny, Italy and Japan gained immensely more
 by losing to us in World War II than they
 could have possibly have gained by winning.
 Had they won, their governments, filled with
 the seeds of their own degeneration, would
 have been stimulated to infinite acquisition,
 with  consequent  national  impoverishment
 and  eventual  annihilation  by  the  United
 States.  As  it  is,  they have stabilized,  be-
 come , .progressive,  democratic  and  pros-
 perous societies.
 Very much  the  same  can  be  said about
 the Communist nations of Asia.  If they win
 in Viet Nam, they will move on indefinitely
 to  extend  their sway.  At some  point the
 United States would be forced to intervene
 again,  this  time  with  the  support  of  the
 opinion polls of a frightened public that at
 last would see the real nature of the struggle.
 A much bloodier war would result.

 KANSAS DETERMINED TO,~R~'SUILD
 AFTER KILLER TORNADOES
 Mr. PEARSON.   Mr.  President,  last
 Wednesday, June  8,  a  series  of  killer
 tornadoes  struck  Kansas.     Approxi-
 12575
 mately  15 tornadoes were sighted and
 several of them touched down and left
 paths  of  violent  destruction.   A  good
 number of communities and farm sites
 were affected.  All together 17 persons
 were killed.  Over 500 were injured with
 almost 100 of these requiring hospitaliza-
 tion.  Preliminary surveys supplied to me
 by the Red Cross show that 818 homes
 were destroyed, 938 with major damage,
 and 1,116 with minor damage.  In addi-
 tion almost 100 house trailers were de-
 stroyed or received major damage.  All
 together a total of approximately -3,300
 families suffered losses.
 Iri  the  city  of  Manhattan  approxi-
 mately 75 homes in a newly developed
 section of  Manhattan were either de-
 stroyed  or  received  extensive  damage.
 At Kansas State University all but two
 of the married Student housing  apart-
 ment buildings received such major dam-
 age that they have had to be evacuated.
 The  greatest  destruction,  however,
 was concentrated in Topeka, the State's
 capital.  Here 16 persons were killed and
 approximately 2,000 homes destroyed or
 damaged.  Several apartment buildings
 were also hit, leaving a total of  3,000
 families homeless.  Approximately  200
 business firms were destroyed or received
 major damage.  One automobile dealer
 lost 275 automobiles through the storm.
 The city's Washburn University was
 especially hard hit.  President John W.
 Henderson states that the losses to the
 university  are  probably  "the  largest
 damage ever to any institution of higher
 learning."
 Preliminary estimates placed the loss
 for Topeka at $150 million.  However,
 several building experts believe that final
 estimates may well show damages of at
 least $300 million.
 Mr. President, an article in this morn-
 ing's, June 15, Wall Street Journal de-
 scribes the death and destruction which
 was visited on Topeka a week ago.  It
 also reports on the tough determination
 of Topekans to rebuild their devastated
 city.  While I visited Topeka last Friday,
 I was impressed by the manner in which
 all the city's citizens were working to-
 gether to clean up the debris and to make
 their city operational and livable as soon
 as possible.  Topeka Mayor Charles W.
 Wright,  and  Topeka  Water  Commis-
 sioner C. Frank Mannspeaker, are today
 here in Washington seeking assistance
 in planning and funding rehabilitation
 of the city, which suffered what some be-
 lieve is the worst damage ever sustained
 by a metropolitan area from a tornado.
 Housing,  mass  transit,  education-all
 suffered heavily from the twister.  The
 Wail Street Journal article describes this
 mood of determination and cooperation
 very effectively and I ask unanimous con-

 TORNADO AFTERMATH:  TOPEKA DEMONSTRATES
 HOW ti'ITY CAN i~EBOUND IN WAKE O}~' A ~IS-
 ASTER-DEVASTATED AUTO DEALERSHIP RENTS
 FAIRGROUND  FACIDITY;  COLLEGE  VaES  HIGH
 SCHOOL-THE, ENORMrrY  OF  REBUILDING
 (By James C. Tanner)
 '   TOPEKA, KANS.-Parts of the roof and walls
 are missing from Cyrus Guthrie's corner- gro-
 cery store.  Canned goods and packages of
 detergents are strewn in front.  Electricity is
 still off.  Homes of most of the store's cus-
 tomers are heaps of debris.  But groceryman
 Guthrie  is  open  for  business-almost  as
 usual.
 The Guthrie store, a concrete building in
 aortheast Topeka, was wrecked by a tornado
 that killed 17 persons and left a ~ib0 million
 ?scar acrasa this state capital city of 130,000
 last Wednesday evening.  When the warning
 sirens sounded,. Mr. Guthrie closed his store
 slid headed for cover.  Later he returned to
 the-area to help haul out theYnjttred and to
 spend  a weary night at his battered store
 giving  away  flashlights  from  his  stock  to
 dazed and homeless neighbors.
 8y dawn the next day, Mr. Guthrie was
 out rounding up carpenters and scrambling
 tar materials to patch up  the stare.  3ike
 most Topekans with property in the path oP
 the storm, he had insurance, but not nearly
 enough,  Mr. Guthrie had coverage of only
 X9,000,  and he says  he  "threw away that
 much" in .ruined vegetables and other per-
 ishables.
 "It  knocked  me  down,  but  I'm  coming
 back," he vows.
 Mr, C=uthrie's determination demonstrates
 the resiliency a city struck by disaster can
 display.  Although still digging out of the
 debris, most Topekans already are bouncing
 back from the most destructive act of nature
 in the state's history:  Mobilizing  quickly,
 the city began the "process of getting back on
 its feet almost. as soon. as the fullnei lifted.
 FEDERAL AGENCDy'S ACTIVE
 "Open for business" signs on boarded-up
 storefronts and propped-up walla are evident
 throughout  the  tornado's, path:  Cleanup
 crews working round the crock are rapidly
 clearing away tons  of debris.  Many busi-
 nessmen. and  homeowners  are  already  re-
 building.  Hundreds of volunteers are pitch-
 ing  in  to  aid  the  tornado's  victims,  and
 Uncle Sam 1s lending a hand, too.  President
 Johnson has declared Topeka a disaster area
 eligible for Federal aid, and Federal agencies
 are opening makeshift offices all over town.
 It's very likely that some areas of 'Ibpeka-
 particularly  in  the  blighted  lower-income
 aortheast. section of  the city-will emerge
 from the devastation of the tornado in better
 physical  shape  than  they  were  in  before.
 New housing and shopping areas are already
 being planned.
 Moreover, the whirling winds of the storm
 had hardly died before city fathers were dust-
 ing off plans, dormant for a decade, to build
 an expressway from southwest to northeast
 Topeka.  The  route,-  as  initially  planned,
 ironically parallels the path of the tornado.
 Previously, the light-of-way was too expen-
 save.  "But that's  all  unimproved property
 Ilaw," says one city official.  City emissaries
 -arc in Washington-right now laying their pro-
 posals before Federal authorities.
 PREPARING FOR DISASTER
 Topeka   probably  has  fared  better  than
 many  other comparable-sized  communities
 would if they were hit with a disaster of this
 magnitude.  Living. as they do in the heart
 of mid-America's "tornado alley," Topekans
 are  no  strangers  to  violent  weather,  even
 though until last week the city had never
 been hit by the full force of a tornado.  Hail
 storms are common here.  Alga, Topeka out-
 shines many a Iarger city in its  elaborate
 preparations  for  dLsasters.  Local  officials
 take pride in a, civil defense center located
 in the subbasement of a reec_ntly built court-
 house.  There, strategy had been mapped to
 cope with disasters ranging 1n size up to nu-
 clear  attacks  on  nearby  Forbes  Air  Force
 Base.  Moreover,          Topeka's   storm-warning
 system is second to none.  "Weather watch-
 ers," mostly volunteers, are posted around
 the  city  in  radio-equipped  cars  whenever
 tornado conditions exist,. and special warn-
 ing sirens sound Sn every section of the city
 whenever a twister is sighted visually or on
 radar.
 But there are some lessons to be learned
 here.  Many new homes built in Togeka in
 recent years had neither storm cellars nor
 basements,. as evidenced byall the concrete
 slab foundations exposed to view today where
 houses crambled when the tornado struck.
 Although the loss of life was relatively small
 because of the repeated visual sightings of
 the tornado and other warnings, injuries are
 estimated as high as b00.  These casualties
 could have been sharply reduced if everyone
 had taken proper precautions, it's generally
 agreed.  It's  even being suggested that all
 hew homes be required by city ordinance to
 have a basement.
 Many Topekans concede they were slaw to
 act when the sirens sounded last week be-
 cause the warning blasts had already come
 several times this spring a?nd nothing much
 had happened.  Darold D. Main, chairman
 of the Board of the Shawnee County Com-
 missioners,  admits  he  was  nonchalantly
 .Working at his desk on the second floor of
 the county courthouse while the sirens were
 wailing last week.  He paid little attention
 until debris flying past his window sent him
 scurrying to the civil defense shelter three
 floors below.
 Many Topekans also appear to have put
 more stock in an old Indian legend than in
 sirens.  The legend had it that Topeka was
 immune to tornadoes because of a feature
 of Its topograghy, specifically a hill south-
 west of town named Burn.ett's Mound after
 the Indian chief said to be 'buried there.  The
 reasoning was that since tornadoes usually
 move in a northeasterly direction, the hill sat
 directly in the path that would normally be
 taken by a twister headed toward Topeka.
 The storms would break up at the mound,
 never touching Topeka-or so the story went
 until last week.
 Just  before  sundown  last  Wednesday,
 weather watchers stationed  atop Burnett's
 Mound sighted a funnel moving toward the
 city.  It didn't stop at Burnett's Mound.  It
 danced across the hill, smashed into Twi-
 light Street on the southwest side of Topeka
 and then swept northeastward with what one
 witness says was  "the  roar  of  100  trains"
 through the city's most heavily populated
 sectors.   The bailing black cloud ripped a
 half-mile-wide swath for 10 miles, whipping
 hard by the Weather Bureau building at the
 airport on its way out of town and sending
 the meteorologists who had earlier ordered
 the  sirens  sounded  diving  for  cover  amid
 flying glass.
 For many Topekans the situation has never
 been  so  grim.        Many  lost  relatives  and
 friends;  hundreds- last  their  life's savings.
 The  storm  left  3,000  families  Nameless,
 destroyed 200 businessa firms, leveled most of
 the stately old structures on the Washburn
 University  campus,  destroyed  other  bu11d-
 1ngs, and nicked thb State capitol.  It also
 overturned  buses. and boxcars and sucked
 windows  from  buildings  and  autos  three
 blocks away from the tornado's trail.  Some
 Topeka debris later turned up 75 miles away.
 -   A BIG JUNKYARD
 Until  the  bulldozers  got busy,  much  of
 Topeka resembled a giant automobile ,~unk-
 yard, with  8,000 to  10,000 cars in  tangled
 heaps.  "This is the most terrible thing that
 ever happened," says William Alexander,  a
 retired  businessman.          Disaster  experts  are
 just now totaling up the damages.  At city-
 owned Washburn University, losses that are
 described by President John W. Henderson as
 "the largest damage ever to any institution
 of higher learning" are expected to approach
 $10 million.
 Wrecked business structures in Topeka a:re
 swarming  with  some  150  insurance  es~ti-
 matora.  The Santa Fe Railway has figured
 damage to its facilities here at $2 million.
 Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. estimates
 its losses at more than ffi1.3 million;  18,000
 .phones were out right after the storm.  Local
 Dodge  dealer  Claude  Shortrlian,  who  lost
 27s automobiles  (175 of them new)  and a
 dozen trucks, says his damages will surpass
 !&1 million.  All told, some building experts
 believe,  the  ultimate  loss  tally  could  nIn
 double the early estimate of $150 million.
 In one low-income area hit by the tornado,
 insurance won't cover more than 20 M, of t:he
 overall loss, according to city auditor Charles
 Holt.  Henry A. Bubb, president of Capii;ol
 Federal Savings & Loan Association, which
 holds about 90%  of the mortgages in two
 fashionable residential sections in southwest
 Topeka  that  were  hard  hit,  estimates  re-
 placement casts in those neighborhoods will
 exceed insured value by at least 10~ .
 HELP FROM  WASHINGTON
 Also, it's generally agreed that replacement
 of demolished properties will take consider-
 able time, both because of a scarcity of labor
 and  todaq's  tight  money  situation.     "We
 ought to be able to rebuild Topeka within
 a year," says contractor Clyde SeIt11e.     But
 businessmen  like  Dodge  dealer  Shortman
 sear that financing probably may  slow re-
 building.
 The Small Business Administration has e~l-
 ready set up offices here-it had more than
 50 inquiries the first day-to make disaster
 loans to both homeowners and businessmen.
 Topeka banker R. C. Clevenger expects to be
 swamped with pleas for financing.. He sayer a
 bookbinder telephoned him before the bank
 opened the morning after the tornado to ask
 for help in lining up a building in which he
 could relocate his devastated business.
 Officials like Robert Jones, Shawnee County
 civil defense director, worry that Topekans
 don't realize the enormity of the rebuilding
 task ahead.  Some fret, too, that the initial
 enthusiasm to clean up and restore the tor-
 nado-damaged areas may wane.  "The real
 test will be where Topeka is at this time next
 year," says Capt. James F. Barker, who di-
 rects Salvation Army aid units that are gath-
 ered here from 24 Midwestern communities.
 Efforts to clean up and achieve a semblance
 ai normality did indeed move at a feveriish
 pace in the days immediately after the tor-
 nado.  A five-mile long caravan of trucA:s,
 many  hauling  heavy  tractors,  was  rushed
 here by the Kansas City, Mo., parks depart-
 ment.  Equipment from as far away as :it.
 Louis and Houston was also sent, and offers
 of help arrived from around the country.
 A  Phoenix,  Ariz.,  mobile  home  dealer
 pledged  temporary  housing  for  displaced
 Topekans.  Kansas, Oklahoma and Nebraslka
 Mennonites, carrying axes and other tools for
 cleaning debris, were on hand within eight
 hours after the storm: they are part of the
 Mennonite Disaster Service, an organization
 within the Mennonite Church.
 VOLUNTEERS  FLOCK  TO  HOSPTIAL
 State  Rep.  Robert  Harder,  who  directs
 Topeka antipoverty programs and whose dis-
 trict makes up 40?!? of the damaged zone, is
 supervising up to 3,000 local volunteers  In

 Of course many individuals and nu-
 merous groups in this country have also
 lodged protests with Soviet authorities
 it Moscow, and have appealed- urgently
 on behalf of these. two writers.  Some
 berievulent -and kind individuals  have
 even expressed the wish to aid these two
 victims  of  Soviet "justice" by, offering
 to h~.ve them brought to this country and
 live here at their expense, without hav-
 ing them become public charges.
 Recently I received a letter from one
 of  my _ constituents,  a  highly  public-
 spirited  friend  whose  humanitarian
 feelings  were  aroused  by  the  fate  of
 Sinyavsky  and  Daniel.     He  wrote  me
 stating  that  if  the  Soviet  authorities
 want to be rid of Sinyavsky and Daniel
 and  axe willing to  release them fror}'i.
 prison and allow them to leave the So-
 viet Union,  he "would  underwrite  the
 support of them and their families in
 this country for a couple of years."  He
 expressed  confidence  that  dozens  of
 American writers would join him.
 I wanted to explore ways by which the
 wish of my friend could be fulfilled, .and
 so on April 27 I wrote to the Department
 of State, asking information on the pos-
 sibility of obtaining the release of these
 two victims  from  their Soviet  prison-
 Iabor camp, and on the chances of their
 coming to this country.
 But the reply which I received from
 the Assistant Secretary of State for Con-
 gressional Relations, Mr. Douglas Mac-
 Arthur II, was not encouraging.  In his
 considerate reply to me, Mr. MacArthur
 makes it abundantly clear that appeals
 to the Soviet Government could oiler no
 hope of securing the release in Sinyavsky
 and Daniel, since that Government has
 already refused to consider favorably all
 appeals  made  by  innumerable  other
 groups and individuals, including appeals
 made by some  eminent Soviet writers
 and Communist intellectuals from East-
 ern and Western Europe.  He also stress-
 es  the  State  Department's  view  that
 "concerned Americans -and citizens of
 other countries should not hesitate to ex-
 press their views in public about the fate
 of Sinyavsky and Daniel: '
 Under the circumstances that prob-
 ably is the most and the very least we
 can do now.  While it may not be pos-
 sible to secure the release of Sinyavsky
 and Daniel from the Soviet prison-labor
 camp, I would like to voice my protest in
 this House against the conviction of these
 two gifted and innocent victims of Soviet
 "justice."  It is my hope that such pro-
 tests, from all quarters of the globe, may
 in some way help to deter the Soviet au-
 thorities from this type of repression in
 the future.
 The case of Sinyavsky and Daniel is a
 particularly significant one for me and
 for the people of the First Congressional
 District of  Massachusetts. whom I am
 privileged to represent in this body.  As
 a further example of the Soviet brand of
 "justice," it is a grim reminder of the
 . tragic and bitterly frustrating  case oP
 young Newcomb Mott of Sheffield, Mass.
 It was less than a year ago that 27-
 .year-old Newcomb innocently wandered
 across the Soviet. border from Norway,
 seeking information on how he might
 legally enter Russia for a brief visit.  He
 -yeas promptly arrested on charges of il-
 legally entering the Soviet Union.  His
 trial was a mockery of anything close to
 due process as we know it, and his con-
 viction-l8 months at hard .labor in a
 Siberian penal colony-was  considered
 severe even by Russian standards.
 The world, of course, knows the out-
 come of the Mott case.  Newcomb never
 reached Siberia.  He died on the prison
 train, allegedly taking his own life, al-
 though the detailed circumstances of his
 death have never been clearly explained
 by the Soviets, and it is unlikely that
 they ever will.
 It is to be hoped that Sinyavsky and
 Daniel will fare better on the sacrificial
 altar of Russian "justice" than did New-
 comb Mott.
 And  certainly  it  should  be  crystal
 clear, even to the most euphemistic swal-
 lowers , of  Russian  hogwash,  that  the
 Soviet Government cannot be trusted to
 react in either a plausible or predictable
 In Town Hall last month I participated in
 a read-in of  American  writers against our
 government's war in Viet Nam, which to me
 appears a crime and to others a duty, and
 there listened to such invective against our
 political leaders that even my ears burned.
 Surely our  names  without  exception  went
 into the FBA's files,. but each of us spoke his
 fragment of the truth, in a faith as old as
 this country ,that out of many ouch frag-
 ments comes a wholer truth.     Uninteriered
 with, I came home thanking my lucky stars,
 from the first thirteen on, that I had read
 my pages from a platform in New York and
 not in Moscow.
 True, the traditions of your country and
 mine are so contrary that we cannot use the
 same language of humanity without ending
 in confusion, and it is a waste of breath to
 lecture each other.  I know only that, like
 Sinyavsky and  Daniel,  I am a  writer who
 abhors the lies which grease the machinery
 of every state; and while I come and go as
 I please on my road here, they are laboring
 in a prison camp;  and I cannot honor my

 dishonors men like me.
 and justice.  There is but one rule-expe-
 dience for the good of the state.  All elsdl
 is subordinate, and I repeat my earnest
 advice to any American foolish enough
 to consider placing his own welfare at
 the mercy of  the Russian  authorities.
 -Steer well clear of any jurisdiction con-
 trolled or influenced by the Soviets.  Ig-
 nore  the  rather  surprising  appeal  of
 Russian advertising to visit the Soviet
 Union.  The lessons are hard and clear.
 The risk is not worth the taking.
 Mr. Speaker, the constituent of whom
 I spoke earlier and who has expressed in-
 terest in bringing Sinyavsky and Daniel
 out of Russia to this country, is the dis-
 tinguished playwright,  William  Gibson
 of Stockbridge, Mass.
 Mr. Gibson has made this case some-
 thing of a personal crusade, since he him-
 self has a more or less personal interest
 in it.  Mr. Gibson is, of course, one of our
 more noted dissenters in this country.
 He makes no secret of his convictions on
 some of the issues confronting the Nation
 today-but makes equally clear his patri-
 otic devotion to the only country in the
 world, perhaps, that would allow him to
 speak his convictions without-fear of the
 kind of reprisals which the Soviets have
 taken against Sinyavsky and Daniel .
 I would like to include at this point in
 my remarks the text of a letter written by
 Mr. Gibson to Soviet Ambassador Ana-
 toly Dobrynin.  The letter, I feel, is in the
 clear tradition of the utterance by Vol-
 taire, who said:  "I disapprove of what
 you say, but I will defend with my life
 your right to say it."
 The letter follows:
 AmbasaadOT  ANATOLY  DOSRYNIN,
 The  Soviet  Ambassador,
 'Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  AMBASSADOR  DOBRYNIN.  Last year I
 was Snvited by the Inatitute of Soviet-Amer-
 ican Relations to visit Moscow, where two of
 my plays are being performed;  I accepted,
 hoping to come when time permitted.  Now
 I wish to state why I will not.
 The sentencing to hard labor of the au-
 thors Daniel and Sinyavsky for publishing
 their dissent from state dogma, which to the
 Soviet government appears a crime and to
 me appears a duty, is not only a bitterness
 to all who hope for understanding between
 our  countries;  it  should  be  felt  by  every
 writer in the world as a kick in the groin.
 MBODIAN AID TO THE VIETCONG
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from Michigan CMr. CHAMBERLAIN]
 is recognized for 15 minutes.
 (Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend his
 remarks and to include extraneous mate-
 rial.)
 Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.  Mr. Speaker, in
 recent weeks, since my return from serv-
 ing on a special Armed Services Commit-
 tee assignment to South Vietnam during
 the Easter recess, I have made a number
 of speeches in this Chamber on the sub-
 ject of the aid the Vietcong derives from
 Cambodia.
 Today I -wish to inform my colleagues
 of a cable I received from the Prime Min-
 ister of Cambodia in which he, in strong
 and  unusual  language,  protests  the
 statements I had made.  I wish to take
 this means to respond to this extraor-
 dinary  communication  because  I  be-
 lieve it does more to lend credence to
 the charges than it does to deny them.
 The Prime- Minister,  Norodom Kantol,
 specifically attacks me for advocating an
 aggressive policy against his country, for
 making public "faked" information, and
 far the failure to be concerned about the
 truth of the situation along the Cam-
 bodian-Vietnamese border.
 Let me first simply refer my colleagues
 to information which I have previously
 inserted_ in the RECORD  on May 4, May
 17, and May 23.  At this time I would
 only reiterate that while ixi South Viet-
 nam Iwas specifically told by a special
 forces officer of the existence of three
 airstrips on Cambodian soil which re-
 ~ceived  daily  flights  with  supplies  for
 Vietcong and of the existence o~f a train-
 ing area as well.  Furthermore, I have
 yet to speak to a military officer of high
 or low rank knowledgeable of that part
 of the world who had the, slightest doubt
 that the Vietcong were using Cambodia.
 Consequently, if it is a matter of believ-
 ing the Cambodian Government or be-
 lieving what our troops in the field tell
 me I shall believe the latter.

 of the Capitol, did not ask far funds to con-
 struct an extensibn an the West Front, there
 is no reason to think the project has been
 postponed.  Mr. Stewart has never favored
 asking for  separate  appropriations  for  his
 building schemes.  At this stage in a session
 Congressmen are tempted to ask questions
 and demand explanations before  approving
 expenditures.  Mr. Stewart prefers to stick
 his requests among the supplemental appro-
 priations items that come in the last hectic
 days  before  adjournment.          He .funded  the
 East Front extension  in this manner.     He
 funded the Rayburn House Office Building
 in this manner.
 The statements that the extension of
 the east front and the Rayburn Building
 were funded through supplemental ap-
 propriations are essentially false.
 A review of the retards, which could
 be made with great ease by anyone in-
 terested, shows the following:
 Extension of the east front: $24 million
 was appropriated for this project and
 associated items.  Of this amoumt, $19,-
 700,000 was obtained through the reg-
 ular  annual  appropriation  acts  and
 $4,300,000 through supplemental appro-
 priations.  It is significant that the first
 two appropriations made for this project,
 totaling $17 million, were carried in the
 regular acts  This was more than enough
 to cover the fatal cost$12 million-of
 the -extension of the east front itself.
 Additional House office building proj-
 ect: $134,500,000 was appropriated under
 this heading, which includes the con-
 struction of the Rayburn Building at a
 cast of approximately $89 million.  Of
 the total of  $134,500,000  appropriated,
 $124,500,000  came  by  the  regular  an-
 nual appropriations acts and $10 million
 by supplementals.  Of the $10 million
 from supplementals, $5 million was ear-
 marked for purchase of land east of the
 Gannon House Office Building which the
 Congress has now decided will be used
 for  the  Madison  Memorial-Library  of
 Congress Building.  So, in fact, only $5
 million  from  supplemental  appropria-
 tions went toward payment for the Ray-
 burn Building, remodeling of the other
 buildings, construction of  garages and
 subways,  and  other items  carried  on
 under this project.

 EDITORIAL  IN  THE  WASHINGTON
 POST, JUNE 14, 1966
 (Mr. STEED asked and was given per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD  slid t0 include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. STEED.  Mr. Speaker, in the in-
 terest of keeping the record straight, I
 call attention the following.  Under the
 heading "Stewart's Ploy,"  ar; editorial
 in the Washington Post states as follows:
 12697->
 downtrodden and the underdog.. Such
 has been our behavior ixi human affairs
 touching human rights, particularly in
 instances where the fate of certain in-
 dividuals was involved, and where,  in
 the courts of law, justice was flouted for
 political  consideration  and  baser mo-
 tives.
 The case of two Soviet writers who
 were recently tried in Moscow, convicted
 and then sentenced to  long terms  of
 penal servitude in prison-labor camps, is
 an instance in point.
 Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel are
 two  well-known  men  of  letters.  Sin-
 yavsky has long been known as a novelist
 and literary critic and also as an ardent
 admirer  of  the  famous  Soviet  writer,.
 Boris Pasternak.  Daniel has been best
 known as a gifted and versatile poet.
 They have often written in praise of the
 Soviet Union's authorities.  For a while,
 when  Khrushchev  was  all .powerful,
 their critical views, expressed in subtle
 literary farms, were tolerated and the
 writers were unmolested.
 For years they retained their status
 in the Gorki Institute of World Litera-
 ture in Moscow, and they continued to
 hold their own, even after Khrushchev's
 demise.  Then last September they were
 arrested  by  Soviet  authorities  and
 charged with disseminating anti-Soviet
 propaganda in their writings abroad un-
 der assumed names.  On this allegedly
 serious and principal charge they were
 tried in Moscow in a courtroom which
 was open to Soviet newspapermen: but
 deliberately barred to foreign press rep-
 resentatives.  After  a  4-day  trial  in
 early February, they were found guilty,
 convicted and then sentenced to serve
 at penal prison-labor camps, Sinyavsky
 far 7 years and Daniel for 5 years.
 At the trial the prosecution charged
 that Sinyavsky, under the name Abram
 Tertz, and Danie] as Nikolai Arzak, had
 written very critically of Soviet litera-
 ture,. and particularly about life in the
 Soviet Union; that they had successi`ully.
 smuggled their anti-Soviet writings out
 of the Soviet Union by devious and illegal
 methods;   and  had  them  published
 abroad.
 Both Sinyavsky and Daniel readily ad-
 mitted to writing under assumed names
 and to having smuggled their writings
 out of the Soviet Union for publication
 abroad,  but  they  stoutly  denied  the
 charge that their writings contained or
 constituted   anti-Soviet   propaganda.
 Nonetheless both men were convicted.
 No sooner was the trial over early in
 February and the verdict known abroad,
 than the .case of these two Soviet, waters
 became something of an international
 issue.  Men of letters in all parts of the
 free world  held  protest  meetings  and
 sent appeals to Soviet authorities, ask-
 ing  for  leniency  and  Clemency.   The
 storm of protests from groups of writers
 in the west was also directed to the So-
 viet writers union in lf2oscow.
 Unfortunately, these protests and ap-
 peals have not brought about any change
 in the fate of Sinyavsky and Daniel; and,
 so far as  is  known,  they are  already
 doing penal servitude in a prison labor
 camp.

 I am impressed that by sending me this
 personal  cable  the  Cambodian  Prime
 Minister is admitting that a very sensi-
 tive nerve has been hit.  His cable is not
 so much a r buttal of the charges as it
 is a countercharge that the whole ques-
 tion is a fabrication'of the U.S. Govern-
 ment  to prepare  the American people
 far a war against Cambodia. A genuinely
 neutral Cambodia has nothing to .fear
 from the United States.  But just how
 does  Cambodia.. understand  the  word,
 "neutrality"?  For one example, let me
 quote from a letter by the Cambodian
 delegate to the United Nations to the New
 York Tiines on May 27, 1966, in which he
 states:
 Because of her policy of strict neutrality,
 Cambodia  refuses  to  be  subjected  to  im-
 perialist domination and to approve this war
 of  aggression.       It  contlllues  to  support
 morally end politically the struggle of the
 brave Vietnam people against American ag-
 gression.  We have never concealed the Pact
 that in token oP our solidarity with the Viet-
 nam people we have offered medical supplies
 and  dated  fish  to  the  National  Liberation
 Front.
 This, it seems to me, is a very peculiar
 definition of neutrality.  It's clear from
 its hostile tone toward the United States
 that we must be, extremely wary of the
 Cambodian Government's public assur-
 ances  about  its  alleged  neutrality.
 Therefore, while I think it is well that
 the invitation. by Cambodia fora con-
 gressional delegation to check into the
 border  situation has  been accepted,  I
 would strongly recommend that any such
 delegation  should  also  inspect  these
 areas with our awn military people as
 well,  preferably  before  journeying  to
 Pnompenh.
 The nature and extent of the aid to
 the Vietcong receive from Cambodia is
 admittedly difficult to measure.  This is,
 of course, in part due to the very char-
 acter  of  guerrilla  warfare.  No  one
 doubts the existence of the Ho Chi Minh
 Trail~compiex but perhaps on any given
 day it is practically. impossible to find it.
 Certainly we must be sure that such a
 delegation  is  not  given  a  whitewash
 treatment.
 Mr. Speaker, no one wants the war to
 be enlarged whether into Cambodia or
 elsewhere.  Neither does anyone want the
 war kept going by condoning the enemy's
 use of Cambodian soil as a sanctuary
 and as a logistical base of support.  The
 Cambodian interpretation of neutralism,
 whatever its intentions, clearly is being
 exploited, by the enemies of South Viet-
 nam.  This cannot be tolerated and I be-
 lieve  that  efforts  to  bring  economic
 pressure  should  be  undertaken  un~il
 Cambodia takes more effective action to
 eliminate the use of its territory by the
 enemies of its eastern neighbor.
 I note also from the Prime Minister's
 cable that while he invites an inspection
 of the border and protests my recom-
 mendation that the Mekong River be
 closed, he makes no offer of inspection of
 Cambodian part facilities.  I have urged
 that  Cambodian-bound  ocean  traffic
 using the Mekong River be stopped to
 eliminate the possibility of contraband
 reaching, the Vietcong and as a weapon
 of economic pressure to bring Cambodia
 to adopt a genuine policy of neutrality.
 The international treaty covering the use
 of this river specifically was predicated
 on  the  existence  of  friendly  relations
 between the countries.  It also stipulates
 that countries may make such regula-
 tions as are necessary fox the mainte-
 nance of their own security.  Mr. Speak-
 er, no one should need reminding that
 South Vietnam is fighting for its very
 existence.
 Before  the  Cambodian  Government
 can establish beyond reasonable doubt
 its neutrality, it will have to show not
 only  that  its  borders  are  not  being
 violated but also that goods entering the
 country by ship are not being diverted
 with or without the government's knowl-
 edge to the Vietcong.  I would strongly
 recommend,  therefore,  that  any  con-
 gressional delegation accepting the Cam-
 bodian invitation to inspect its borders
 should also make a thorough inquiry re-
 garding the possibility of supplies enter-
 ing especially the capital port city of
 Phnom Penh by means of the Mekong
 River.
 If I thought it would really do any
 good, I would: also challenge the Cam-
 bodian Government to permit the full
 inspection of  all .Mekong River traffic
 unloading at Pnompenh by representa-
 tives of both interested and disinterested
 governments.  By inspection, I mean not
 simply the examination of ships' docu-
 ments but the surveillance of the actual
 goods in each ship.  However, even if
 this were done, the result would still be
 less than adequate.  Goods bound for the
 Vietcong could still come through the
 saltwater port of Sihanoukville on the
 Gulf of  Thailand.  In fact,  there  are
 already reports to this effect.  Conse-
 quently, Ibelieve that the only way to
 bring  substantial pressure  to  bear  on
 Cambodia would be to close the Mekong
 River since this would place a premium
 on all space for cargo entering the coun-
 try which, hopefully, would help insure
 that it would be used only for domestic
 and peaceful purposes.
 Mr. Speaker, in conclusion I can only
 say that this cable makes it clear to me
 that the Cambodian Government will let
 no opportunity pass to attack the United
 States as a device to-shift attention from
 its own failure to control its territory.
 The Prime Minister, to borrow a phrase
 from  Shakespeare,  "doth  protest  too
 much, methinks."
 The  translation  of  Prime  Minister
 Kantoi's cable, a translation of a letter
 I  have  received  from  the  Cambodian

 C. L. Sulzberger in the New York Times

 follows:
 Mr.  CHARLES  CHAMBERLAIN,
 House of Representatives,
 Washington, D.C.,  U.S.A.:
 We have Just learned of your astonishing
 statements about Cambodia from the CON-
 GRESSIONAL  RECORD  Oi May 23,  1968.  They
 show us that a representative of the Ameri-
 can people is free to advocate an aggressive
 policy against a peaceful and neutral coun-
 try on the, basis of reports that he knows
 very well are false.  We really cannot imagine
 tizat you do not know of the reports about
 ou; border areas published b~  major news-
 papers under the signature of Seymour Top-
 ping,  Stanley Karnow, and Stanley Shein-
 baum.  This is, for us, therefore, a new pic-
 ture of so-called American democracy.    We
 invited a Delegation of American Senators
 and Representatives to make an on-the-spot
 study of the actual situatlon in our couxi-
 try.   They  refused,  for,  according  to  the
 example set by you, the search for truth is
 irreconcilable  with  the  implementation  of
 a policy of force and domination.    We re-
 cently requested increased inspection of our
 borders by the International Control Com-
 mission in order to prove our good faith and
 the  actual  fact  of  our  neutrality,     Your
 Pentagon and Department of State hastened
 to deny the accusations made against Cam-
 bodia.  You have deemed fit to ask Presi-
 dent Johnson to bring pressure to bear on
 Cambodia  by  closing  the  Mekong.     Such
 a measure  would  be  a  violation. of  inter-
 national' law, and this would  be  added to
 the innumerable violations of  treaties and
 agreements,  as  well  as  the United  Nations
 Charter;  of  which  your  country  is  guilty.
 However, you may rest assured that Cam-
 bodia would be able to cope with that situa-
 tion Just as it is coping with the constant
 ,acts of aggression perpetrated by your forces
 and your mercenaries. 'And above all do not
 imagine  that  such . a measure can  destroy
 our independence.

 [Translation (French)
 (Rep.  CHAMBERLAIN,)
 (Permanent mission of  Cambodia to the
 United Nations Organization, No. 2397.)
 Mr. CONGRESSMAN: It is with great surprise
 and regret that bread in the CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD of May 23, 1986, the remarks extended
 by you in the House of Representatives rela-
 tive to my country.
 By  taking  up  the  slanderous  (and  un-
 founded)  accusations  of  the  Psychological
 (Warfare) Services of the U.S. Armed Forces
 in South Vietnam, taken up by some Ameri-
 can and "free world" newspapers for the puI?-
 pose of justifying and creating a pretext for
 an American aggression on my country, you
 have, to my great regret, been a party to this
 campaign of poisoning American public opin-
 ion.
 You saw fit to stress that "press reports in-
 dicate  there is  no  (reason to)  doubt that
 Cambodia is a sanctuary, a training ground,
 and a source of supply for the Viet Cong."
 Mr.  Congressman,  do you know that re-
 cently, perhaps during your visit to South
 Vietnam, the Royal Government of Cambodia,
 invited the representatives of the American
 press, Mr. Seymour Topping of The New York
 Times,  Mr. Stanley     Karnow of The  Wash-
 ington Post, and Mr. Stanley Sheinbaum of
 the periodical Ramparts, to conduct investi-
 gations in the border areas suspected, accord-
 ing to the Psychological Services of the U.S.
 Armey~ Forces in South Vietnam, of harbor-
 ing i/ne forces oP North Vietnam and of the
 Viet  Cong?     The  results  of  their  inquiries
 were published in the newspapers in question.
 All confirmed that Cambodia has never been
 and in no way is being used as a base, as a
 sanctuary,  or as  a training ground for the
 Viet Cong.  In addition to the affirmations of
 these  American  newspaper  correspondents,
 there are also those of the members of the
 International  Control  Commission,  of  the
 Military Attaches of the countries (including
 those of the Western countries) accredited to
 my country who acknowledged that no base,
 no  sanctuary  of  the  Viet. Cong  existed  in
 Cambodia.
 If you are so sure that Cambodia is harbor-
 ing the Viet Cong, how does it happen that

 deceptive practices that cost the con-
 sumer millions of dollars, truth-in-pack-
 aging bills have been introduced in the
 Congress.  I am pleased that unions-such
 as the  Seafarers  International  Union,
 among others, is supporting the AFL-
 CIO demand for passage of  truth-in-
 packaging legislation.
 These  bills  will  bring  intelligible,
 standardized packaging and labeling to
 the market place.  It would bring order
 out of chaos and make it possible foi? the
 consumer  to  get  his  money's  worth.
 This seems to be a modest enough ohjec-

 should object.
 More important, the Food and Drug
 Administration would be authorized to
 enforce the law for food, drugs and cos-
 metics, while the Federal Trade Com-

 QUESTIONNAIRE  REPORT,  FIFTH
 CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT  OF
 THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT
 (Mr.  MONAGAN  (at the .request of
 Mr. WHITE of Texas) was granted per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECOeo and to include ex-
 traneousmatter.)
 Mr.  MONAGAN.  Mr.  Speaker,  the
 tabulation of returns on my 1966. annual
 questionnaire has  just been completed
 and I wish at this time to xeport to. my
 colleagues, and to my constituents, on
 this cross section of opinion on impor-
 tant issues which currently are before
 the Congress and the administration.
 My  1966  congressional questionnaire
 was mailed early in May to constituents
 whose names are on my regular mailing
 list as a result of earlier correspondence
 ar expressions of interest in legislative
 matters.  This list was supplemented by
 requests for cards resulting from news-
 paper, radio, and television announce-
 ment of the suiwey.  Once again, I can
 report that the people of the Fifth Con-
 gressional District of Connecticut, whom
 I  have .the  honor  to  represent,  have
 shown a gratifying inte>est in the af-
 fairs of our Nation.
 I include with this report the complete
 chart  showing  total  and  percentage
 "yes," "no," and "undecided" opinions on
 each of the 12 issues included in the sur-
 vey.  Most important tome, and I think
 to the people of the Nation, is the return
 on the questions concerning the conduct
 of the war in Vietnam.  I presented the
 Vietnam  question. in six categories.  I
 did not include the alternative of nego-
 tiation because in my opinion this is not
 a controversial question.  It is my feel-
 ing that all  of us would welcolrle the
 termination  of  the  Vietnam  conflict
 through proper negotiation.
 I want to call particular attention to
 some of ..the highlights of the question-
 naire returns: 56.04 percent of those re-
 sponding expressed themselves in favor
 of Continuing our present U.S. policy in
 Vietnam; 52.98 percent recommended es-
 calation  of  our  military  efforts;  43.99
 percent would bomb Hanoi, and 63.31
 ing  expenses of college. students, 74.87
 percent; legislation to control interstate
 shipment of firearms, 7G.20 percent; and
 stricter regulation  of  the handling of
 animals  used  in  laboratory  research,
 62.55 percent.
 Other scores: 58.61 percent in favor of
 a 4-year term for Members of the House
 of Representatives; 58.80 percent for es-
 tablishment of a Cabinet-level Depart-
 ment of Transportation; 52.94 percent in
 support of adoption of the metric system
 of weights and measures; 51.76 percent
 fora demonstl?ation .cities program to
 rebuild entire slum areas; 48.85 percent
 in favor of increasing the Federal mini-
 mum wage level to $1.60; and 48.81 per-
 cerrt for a constitutional. amendment to
 permit-a State to apportion one house of
 its legislature on a basis other than pop-
 ulation.
 As I have previously stated, a question
 which limits the answer to "yes" or "no"
 leaves much to be desired, but this form
 is made. necessary by space limitations.
 Even with this restriction, however,  I
 have found the response to tYle 1966 ques-
 tionnaire most heartening and informa-
 tive.  I have also been favored by many
 letters from constituents who have given
 me the benefit of their views with de-
 tailed comments.  I welcome and appre-
 ciate these. comments and I am grateful
 to all those who took the time to com-
 plete the questionnaire and return it to
 me.
 I do not look upon these returns as an
 official mandate, nor do I endeavor to
 identify this program as a professional
 sampling, but the returns al?e a helpful
 guidance in their indication of public
 opinion trends.  As in the past, I shall
 continue to exercise my own judgment
 and. to vote on issues as I see them and
 their influence on the people of my dis-
 trict and of the Nation, but most as-
 suredly the returns will help me to form
 this judgment.
 I also want to emphasize the point that
 this questionnaire was not printed at
 Government expense, and the cards were
 returned to me by constituents who were
 willing to pay the post</div></div></div>  </div>
