Kissinger 
CM Group 
Didn't Meet 
By George Lardner.Jr. 
Washington Post Stet! Writer 
Nearly 40 covert Central 
-.Intelligence . Agency 
. operations were approved 
between 1972 and 1974 without 
a Single meeting of the Special 
While House group that was 
-ostensibly in charge of them, 
it was disclosed yesterday. 
Testifying before the House 
intelligence committee, a 
' recently retired State. 
Department intelligence 
' expert said the National 
Security Council's so-called 
Forty Committee did not have 
a single formal session bet?;. 
? ween April. of 1972 and 
December of 1974. 
The witness, James R. 
Gardner, who served for nine 
years as the State Depart-
ment's liaison officer with the 
Forty Committee, said the 
- committee's chairman, Henry 
A. Kissinger, apparently 
? preferred to approve or at 
times _reject the secret 
:operations after "telephone 
votes,'" without face-to-face 
:'meetings at which their 
?-merits could be debated and 
: discussed. 
?: "Sometimes he felt he just 
didn't have the time for it and 
anyway, he knew what he 
wanted to be done," Gardner 
added later to reporters. He 
likened the Forty Committee 
under Kissinger to "Lincoln's 
Cabinet" ? with Kissinger's 
'vote being the only one that 
s counts. 
' Covert operations, which 
_Gardner said used to be far 
.more numerous than their re-
cent 20-per-year average,have 
ranged all, the way from the 
1961 Bay of Pigs invasion to 
paying off politicians in Chile 
and raising a sunken Soviet 
submarine from the Pacific 
Ocean floor. 
The Forty Committee, 
which has existed under ? 
various names since the mid-
' 50s, has also been in charge of 
certain secret intelligence-
gathering activities such as U-
2 spy flights. Kissinger is 
chairman by virtue of his post 
as special assistant to the 
President for national 
security affairs, a job he 
;retained after his appointment 
in i973 as Secretary of State. ?'

These are hard times for 
the intelligence community. 
To judge from the expres-
sions of horror and shock 
from our liberal legislators, 
we are back in the era of 
an intelligence-gathering 
which held that "gentlemen 
don't read other people's 
mail." 
Of course,-it's perfectly 
O.K. for private citizens to 
steal secret government 
documents and deliver 
them by the crateful to 
sympathetic newspapers. 
But let the government be 
accused of reading the mail 
or listening to the phone 
calls of a few people sus-
pected of being security 
risks or involved in the 
international drug traffic, 
and the foundations of our 
fundamental civil liberties 
are held to be in deadly peril. 
It is very fashionable 
these days to be against any 
intelligence-gathering ac-
tivity. It is even fashionable 
to be against national se-
curity. Everything of this 
sort is automatically relat-
ed to the excesses of the 
Nixon administration in,the 
Watergate affair. 
? We are well on the way to 
a kind of reverse McCarthy-
ism in which the most ele-
mentary activities of the 
various security agencies 
are denounced as deep-dyed 
plots against individual 
freedom. 
Political Affairs Joseph J. 
Sisco. 
Gardner, an officer of the 
State Department's Bureau of 
Intelligence and Research 
who became liaison officer for 
secret CIA operations in 1966. 
said that the approximately 40 
covert operations authorized 
between 1972 and 1974 were all 
subject to "telephone votes" 
by Forty Committee mem-
bers, but that except for 
KiSsinger, committee 
members were often not given 
detailed explanations ? of why 
the programs had been ap-
proved 
The official records of the 
Forty Committee, Gardner 
added, also became far less 
In this I suspect there is a 
large element of hypocrisy 
and political miscalcUla-
tion. Americans may de-
plore the need for govern-
ment snooping on the 
activities of their fellow-
citizens. But most would 
also recognize the legitima-
cy of mail interception and 
phone taps in cases involv-
ing national security, kid-
naping or organized crime. 
It is hard to contend ? as 
some liberals do ? that se-
curity of communications is 
a constitutional-right guar-
anteed to all citizens. 
From its inception, the 
telephone has been the most 
insecure means of private 
communication., Almost 
everyone over the age of 30 
has lived in a community of 
party lines where every 
conversation was assumed 
to be monitored and in 
which the telephone opera-
tor was always the best-in-
formed gal in town. In 
every foreign country, the 
tapping of resident foreign-
ers is automatically expect-
ed. 
A few years ago, I 
remember calling Lyndon 
Johnson's presidential as-
sistant McGeorge Bundy at 
the White House with an 
indiscreet question, "Sure-
ly," said Bundy, "You can't 
expect an answer to that ? 
especially over the tele-
phone." 
Much the same goes for 
Although each department 
and agency represented on the 
Forty Committee submits 
the sanctity of the mails as 
an inviolable constitutional 
right of every American 
citizen. Many of those now 
leading the protest against 
the intelligence services 
spent plenty of disagreeable 
hours, as officers in the 
American Army in World 
War II, reading the letters 
of their own enlisted men ? 
a duty made the more dis-
tasteful by the presumption 
that officers' mail was 
uncensored. 
True, we are not in a 
state of war today. But the 
principle that the privacy of 
communication is subordi-
nate to the requirements of 
national security ? and 
presumably also the war 
against organized crime in 
this country ? would not be 
seriously disputed by a 
great majority of American 
citizens. 
The conflict between the 
rigIrts of the individual and 
the rights of society, repre-
sented by a democratically 
elected government, is not 
exactly new. What is essen-
tial today is that these dif-
fering ? and not always 
easily compatible ? rights 
be redefined in a way which 
will protect honest citizens 
(by legal rather than politi-
cal definition) without com-
promising the right of the 
state to defend itself: 
It is one of the more ur-
gent tasks ' of the post-
Watergate period.

operation, Gardner said he 
had no way of telling how 
Carefully those views have 
been considered in recent 
years. By the time he retired, 
he said, the official minutes of 
the Forty Committee were 
"merely the statement of a 
decision" and plainly 
"inadequate."

U. S. Intelligence System: How Well Does it Do 
Ey JOHN M. CREWDSON 
SottO al to The New Ytfrit Times 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17?As 
the House Select Committee on 
Irtelligence closes its doors to 
prepare the next phase of its 
investigation, it leaves behind 
what many see as a troubling 
answer to the 
question of how 
News well American in-
Analysis telligence performs 
its principal task?
predicting events 
of international significance in 
time to allow the makers 
of foreign policy to prepare 
or react. 
The conclusion that seems to 
emerge from public hearings 
over the last month is that the 
half-dozen or so Federal agen-
des charged with gathering 
and evaluating foreign intelli-
gence do not provide a reliable 
early-warning system where 
such things as wars, invasions 
and political upheavals are con-
cerned. 
Representative Otis G. Pike, 
the Suffolk County Democrat 
who heads the 13-member se-
lect committee, found the evi-
dence so disturbing that he 
recently went so far as to ques-
tion this country's ability to 
detect in advance a threat to its 
own shores. 
? Form Crisea. Studied 
"If an attack were to be 
launched on America in the 
very near future," Mr. Pike 
declared, "it is my belief that 
America would not imow that 
the attack were about to be 
launched." 
The Central Intelligence 
Agency disputed that assertion, 
but so far no one has seriously 
challenged Mr. Pike's assess-
ment that, in return for an in-
telligence budget that approach-
es $7-billion, the country does 
not seem to be getting its 
money's worth. 
In the public hearings, the 
committee chose to concentrate 
on four international crises in 
which the United States had a 
military or diplomatic interest, 
and by which it was to some 
extent caught off guard?the 
1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam, 
the 1973 war in the Middle, 
East, the military coup in Por-
tugal and the invasion of 
Cyprus by Turkey. 
Despite delays in obtaining 
documentary evidence, occa-
sioned by dispute with Presi-
dent Ford r the committee's 
!handling of secret materials, 
the panel was able to estab-
lish that in each of the four 
.instances warnings of what 
:was to happen failed to reach 
:the top. 
Deliberate Effort Seen 
The committeehis also under-
stood to have received docu-
ments showing failures of intel-
ligence in advance of other 
events, including the 1968 in-
vasion of Czechoslovakia by the 
Soviet Union and its allies and] 
the detonation of a nuclear de-
vice by India, but those mate-1 
rials are still secret. 
The reasons for the intelli-
gence failures are varied and 
complex. In some instances, 
raw intelligence collected was 
incomplete or simply in error. 
In others, good intelligence was 
misinterpreted by analysts. 
In the case of the 1968 Tet 
offensive; the committee heard 
assertions that American lead-
ers, in deference to precon-
ceived policies and for fear of: 
inflaming antiwar sentiment at 
home, had ignored 'indications 
that the Communists' forces 
might be twice as large as the 
official estimates. 
Samuel A. Adams, a former 
C.I.A. analyst who specialized 
in studying the Vietcong, re-
counted his contention that this 
? country's "astonishment" at the 
scope of the Tet offensive had 
resulted from a deliberate ef-
fort within the intelligence 
community "to portray the 
Vietcong as weaker than they 
actually were." 
Mr. Adams quoted from pre-
viously secret cablegrams be-
tween Saigon and Washington 
that resulted in the unan-
nounced dropping of two cate-
gories of Vietcong forces from 
le official strength estimate 
to keep it at its previous level 
of 299,000. 
Mr. Adams's charges of 
corruption were not repeated 
by witnesses who testified on 
NEW YORK TIMES 
17 October 1975 
Human Experimentation 
A pending Senate bill to broaden the responsibilities 
of the National Commission for the Protection of Human 
Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research offers 
a. simple but promising approach to a difficult and-Often 
painful problem. ? 
? The commission was established by Congress last 
? year to take a two-year look at the practices, ethics and1 
values involved in using human beings as research 
- subjects. Formed after exposure of the infamous 
Iabama. syphilis experiments, the commission was em-
powered to propose regulations for such experimen-
tation to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. 
Under the law, the Secretary is required, if he chooses 
-not to promulgate the proposed regulation, to give his 
reasons in writing. 
e The new bill would enlarge the commission's' juris-
diction to include experimentation ' conducted by the 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08: 
Cyprus, Portugal and the Mid-
dle East. But their accounts of 
failure to clearly see or cor-
rectly interpret key signala 
were equally dismaying to 
most of the committee mem-
bers. 
One subsequent assessment 
obtained by the committee said 
"there was an intelligence 
failure in the weeks preceding 
the outbreak of war in the Mid-
dle East" in October, 1973. 
? Analysts Are Blamed 
The fault, it said, lay not 
with the collectors of intelli-
gence, who passed on "plenti-
ful, ominous and often accu-
rate" indications that the 
threat of war was serious, but 
rather with the analysts who 
were assuring officials that 
"neither side appears to be bent 
on initiating hostilities." 
Some of the best intelligence, 
the committee was told, was 
picked up by the National 
Security Agency, which moni-
tors the military communica-
tions of other countries. 
But some of this intelligence 
could not be passed on to the 
Watch Committee, set up to 
keep an eye out for trouble 
spots, because its members 
were not clear to receive such 
sensitive material. 
Ray Cline, the State Depart-
ment's director of research and 
intelligence at the time of the' 
1973 war, testified that he had 
concluded hours before the 
fighting began that hostilities 
probably were imminent and he 
had asked that the message be 
passed to Secretary of State 
Kissinger. Mr. Cline said he 
learned later that Mr. Kissin-
ger never got the message be-
cause his secretariat "did not 
want to trouble him at that 
late hour." 
Three intelligence officials told 
the committee that their agen-
cies?the C.I.A, the State De-
partment and the Defense In-
telligence Agency?had been 
surprised by last year's over-
throw of the Portuguese Gov-
ernment by leftist military 
leaders. 
According to William G. Hy-
land, the current State Depart-
ment intelligence chief, no 
specific warning was provided 
Its lob 
by intelligence agencies despite 
indications in the months be-
fore. 
Another witness, Keith Clark, 
an intelligence officer for West-
ern Europe, said the intelligence 
community had failed to com-
pile information about the dis-
sident military officers who led 
the coup in Portugal. 
According to evidence and 
testimony assembled by the 
House committee, C.I.A. anal-
ysts studying the Cyprus situ:-
ation in July, 1974, tempered 
their previous warnings that 
the Government of Archbishop 
Makarios, the President of Cy-
prus, was endangered by the 
military regime in Greece. 
That reversal, according to 
a second post-mortem report 
made available to the commit-
tee, occurred a few days before 
President Makarios was un-
seated and was founded on a 
single C.I.A. report from Athens 
suggesting that the Government 
there "had now decided not to 
move against Makarios, at least 
for the time being." 
Ability to Foresee 
The Cyprus post-mortem re-
Port comments on an "inabil-
ity to foresee critical events in 
the face of mounting evidence 
to the contrary." 
"Ultimately," the report con-
tinues, "intelligence will be 
judged in the context of its 
.ability to provide the consumer 
with premonitory assessments. 
The ability of the community 
to provide its consumers with 
the news after a crisis has 
erupted is widely recognized." 
The House committee drew; 
no conclusions about what fac-
tors might account for the in-
telligence failures, but the C.I.A. 
officers who wrote the Cyprus 
post-mortem report offered one, 
possible explanation. 
Among analysts, they said, 
there exists "the perhaps sub-
conscious conviction and hope 
that ultimately reason and ra-
tionality will prevail, 'that ap-
parently irrational moves will 
not be made by essentially

A close and friendly relationship 
*with the CIA has become virtually "a 
prerequisite for promotion" to top 
posts in the State Department, a 
middle-level Foreign Service officer 
has told the House Intelligence Com-
mittee staff. 
"You aren't going to have an 
ambassador anywhere in the world 
unless he has a record of working 
closely with the CIA," the officer 
said in a telephone interview after an 
hour-long unannounced talk with a 
committee lawyer. 
The olicer, who declined to be 
identified by name, said the exten-
sive use of embassy posts to provide 
"official cover" for overseas CIA 
operatives produces a cooperative 
? relationship between the agency and 
State Department management both 
in Washington and 'abroad. 
? STATE DEPARTMENT personnel 
officers must be aware of undercover 
:CIA agents assigned to embassies, 
he said. 
And Foreign Service officers who 
buck the CIA just don't get pro-
moted, he said. 
The officer said he had urged the 
Committee to continue its efforts to 
question junior and middle-level 
State Department officials as part of 
its investigation of the effectiveness 
of the nation's intelligence efforts. 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kiss-
inger has refused to permit employes 
below the assistant secretary level to 
answer the committee's questions on 
matters of policy. 
THE PANEL VOTED yesterday to 
avoid an immediate showdown with 
Kissinger on the issue. The secretary 
was summoned to appear either Oct. 
30 or Oct. 31 to defend his policy in 
:person at a public hearing. 
BALTIMORE SUN 
22 Oct. 1975 
CIA probes linked 
to aide's execution 
Boston (AP1?An official of 
an unspecified Middle Eastern 
country was executed for 
supplying information to the 
Central Intelligence Agency 
after the official's identify was 
determined through testimony 
in congressional probes of the 
CIA, the Boston Globe said yes-
terday. 
The newspaper quoted a 
congressional source as saying 
the execution took place recent-
ly. 
The Globe said its report 
was based on at least a score of 
interviews with intelligence 
sources inside and outside the 
CIA. 
The committee decided to 
call Kissinger as a witness 
after rejecting, 8-5, a 
proposal to launch con-
tempt of Congress proceed-
ings against him. 
The- middle-level officer 
who was interviewed by the 
committee staff said the 
lawmakers should insist on 
talking to working-level 
officers because they would 
be more willing than their 
superiors to discuss CIA 
"penetration and manipu-
lation" of the State Depart-
ment. 
THE CIA'S PENCHANT 
for secrecy makes it dif-
ficult to trace the agency's 
influence. In many cases, 
he said, records do not 
exist. 
For instance, he said, as 
an acting counsel in South 
Africa in the 1950s, he was 
told to show a potential in-
formant a fake letter plant-
ed in the consulate's safe. 
After the informant left, he 
said, he was told to destroy 
the document. 
"There are no records of 
much of what they do," he 
said. "They burn the 
records " 
OTIS PIKE, D-N.Y., 
chairman of the House 
Intelligence Committee, 
and four other Democrats 
wanted to start action 
against Kissinger for refus-
ing to comply with the com-
mittee's subpoena for a 
rs 
memo that criticizes U.S. 
handling of last year's 
Cyprus crisis. But an im-
promptu coalition of four 
Democrats and four Repub-
licans decided to make one 
nitre try at a compromise. 
"It was my opinion that 
we should proceed against 
Dr. Kissinger as we would 
against an ordinary mor-
tal," Pike said sardonical-
ly. 
It was understood that 
State Department officials 
were working on possible 
compromise proposals to 
assuage the committee 
without violating Kissing-
er's rule barring junior and 
middle-level employes 
from discussing policy 
matters. 
Pike objects to the order, 
which he said prohibits the 
committee from finding out 
the full details of the effec-
tiveness of the CIA and 
other intelligence agencies. 
But he may be willing to 
compromise after he has a 
chance to confront Kissing-
er face-to-face. 
THE COMMITTEE has 
subpoenaed a memo writ-
ten by Thomas Boyatt, who 
was the department's top 
Cyprus expert at the time of 
the coup that ousted Arch-
bishop IVIakarios from the 
presidency of the island na-
tion. Boyatt has confirmed 
that -the memo was sharply 
criticial of U.S. policy? but

? A CIA Pretense 
1. At a press briefing ?in' St. Louis birector 
William E. Colby of the'Central Intelligence 
Agency indicated that by such appearances he 
is trying to repair the damage to his agency 
done by adverSe"publicitY stemming from 
congressional investigations. If success de-
pended only on a cool and urbane manner, Mr. 
Colby accomplished his purpose here. 
But the press has an obligation to look 
behind the friendly smile and the smooth 
answer. At one point Mr. Colby was asked to 
comment on testimony before the House 
intelligence committee by Samuel A. Adams, 
former principal CIA analyst of Viet Cong 
troop strength, to the effect that the agency; 
yielding to military and political pressure, had 
underrated the adversary's strength just be-
fore the 1963 Tet offensive. Mr. Colby replied 
that-there had simply been a disagreement 
between Mr. Adams and others in the agency 
over categories of Viet Cone; forces and that 
there was no deception or chaoging of figures.

the specifics. 
Kissinger has refused to 
give the committee the 
memo because it was sent 
through a special "dissent 
channel" intended to per-
mit middle-level officials to 
object to policy without 
being publicly identified 
with their suggestions. 
The secretary contends 
his objective is to protect 
Foreign Service officers 
from the sort of public con-
demnation they received 
during the era of the late 
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy. 
But Pike argued that 
Congress is so weak "com-
pared with the executive 
branch" that it can cause 
little trouble. He said gov-
ernment employes have far 
more to fear from their own 
departments than from 
Congress.

C.I.A. 'MAIL COVER' 
NIT Al 2.7 MILLION 
215,820 of Letters Opened 
?During a 20-Year Program, 
Senate Panel Is Told 
By NICHOLAS M. HORROCK 
? . Special to The New York Times 
? WASHINGTON, Oct. 21?The 
Central Intelligence Agency 
opened more than 215,000 
pieces of mail in a New York 
operation that many senior 
agency officials knew to be 
illegal, it was disclosed today 
at a Senate committee hearing. 
? Testimony and documents in 
traduced before the Senate Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence 
sketched a program of intru-
sion ' upon the United States! 
mails fa rmore extensive than 
was inaicated in the Rockefel-
ler Commission report on the 
intelligence community last 
June or in previous Congres-
sional testimony. 
1. Figures made available to 
the committee by 'the C.I.A. 
!showed that it photographed. 
;the exterior of 2,705,726 pieces 
:of mail to and from the Soviet 
Union in its New York pro-
-gram between 1953 and 1973: 
This, testimony established, 
%vas' one in every 13 pieces of 
mail to and from the ? Soviet 
Union. The agency opened 
215,820 individual letters. 
Similar operations were 
conducted' on the West Coast, 
in Hawaii and in New Orleans, 
but all were of shorter dura-
tion. No figures were given 
for these operations. 
Two C.I.A. internal investiga-
tions of the New York mail, 
project, one in 1960 and the 
other in 1969, found the opera-
tion of little intelligence value,: 
,the men who conducted the: 
reviews testified. 
? Gordon Stewart, Inspector 
General of the C.I.A. in 1969,1 
said that his office was "quite, 
surprised to find such an en-
deavor going on" and that, 
'after an internal investigation, 
:he recommended that the 
,project be turned over to the 
Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, which was receiving a 
large portion of the intelligence 
information. 
Mr. Stewart and John Glen-
non, and Thomas Abernathy, 
-former staff members in the 
Inspector General's Office, said 
they believed the project was 
illegal. Moreover, Mr. Glennon 
testified, "obviously everyone 
involved in it at the C.I.A] 
realized it was illegal." 
gi As early as 1962, the C.I.A. 
!became concerned that the mail 
opening might inadvertently be 
gnade public and it devised cov-
er stories for those involved, 
according to agency documents.

Hthns Says Search 
Of Mail Was Illega 
"As an example of additional 
safeguards to the project," one 
memorandum said, "high-level 
police contacts with the New 
York City Police Department 
are enjoyed, which would pre-
!elude any uncontrolled inquiry 
in the event police action was 
;indicated." 
A committee source said 
,there was no evidence that 
the New York police knew 
'about the illegal mail opening. 
The 20-year project appeared 
:to pick up speed in the late 
'nineteen-fifties and again in 
.the early nineteen-seventies. 
?During these periods, figures 
indicated, the C.I.A. was exam-
,ining peak numbers of mail 
items, and between 1970 and 
1972 averaged about 2 million 
a year. 
According to C.I.A. memo-
'randums, the project was origi-
nally proposed to postal offi-
cials as one in which the C.I.A. 
would'only photograph the out-
side of envelopes?in effect, 
a "mail cover." New York was 
selected because that was 
where mail to the Soviet Union 
was funneled. 
Subsequently, by the mid-
nineteen-fifties, large numbers 
of letters were being opened, 
but it was unclear whether 
postal officials or Attorneys 
General were fully informed. 
According to testimony, 
members of the C.I.A.'s Office. 
of Security chose mail at ran-
dom from the traffic between 
the United States and the So-
viet Union, as well as looking 
for letters of certain persons. 
More than 25 million letters 
'were, routed to the Soviet 
Union during the period. 
There was no direct testimo-
ny on how the mail was 
opened, but intelligence sources 
said that the C.I.A. at first 
used a steam system, but later 
developed an oven, that 
"baked" the letters open. After 
the mail was opened, the con-
tents were photographed and 
the letters were resealed and 
sent on their way. 
It was unclear whether the 
C.I.A. obtained approval over 
the years from Postmasters Ge-
neral or Attorneys General. 
One memorandum made pub-
lic today indicated that Richard 
M. Helms, former Director of 
Central ? Intelligence, had 
briefed Edward Day, Postmast-
er General in 1961, and that 
Mr. Day permitted the project 
to continue but "he did not 
want to be informed in any 
greater detail on the handling." 
According to the Rockefeller 
Commission report. Mr. Helms 
briefed Attorney General John 
N. Mitchell and Postmaster 
General Winton Blount in 1971, 
and they fully "concurred." 
In its report, the Rockefeller 
Commission said at one point 
that "some 8,700 items were 
opened and the contents ana-
lyzed"; at another point, it said 
the project had "expanded by 
1959 to include the opening 
of over 13,000 letters a year." 
But at no point did the commis-
sion make public the total num-
bers of letters involved.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 ? 
'Richard Helms, Director of 
Central Intelligence from 1966 
to 1973; testified today that he 
!knew then that the agency's 
mail-opening program was il-
legal. But he said he assumed 
that Allen W. Dulles, the intel-
ligence agency's director who 
started the operation in 1953, 
had "made his legal peace with 
it." 
Mr. Helms, the only witness 
this afternoon before the Senate 
Select Committe on Intelli-
gence, also conceded that , a 
1970 report to President Nixon 
that he and others had signed, 
and that stated that the mail-
opening - operation . had been 
discontinued? was untrue. 
But he added that there had 
been "no intention to mislead" 
the . President., He explained 
that he- had believed- that the 
statement had referred ?toy a 
similar operation of the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, 
which had. been discontinued. 
It was disclosed during testi-
mony yesterday that the agen-
cy had opened more than 215,-

Suspension of Intercepts 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UPI) 
? The State Dertment ap-
parently asked the C.I.A. to 
suspend interception of mail 
to and from China in connec-
tion with President Nixon's vi-
sit in 1972, a-Senate investiga-
tor indicated today. 
Questioning C.I.A. witnesses 
during a hearing of the Senate 
intelligence committee, Senator 
Walter Huddleston, Democrat 
of Kentucky, asked whether 
the witnesses knew about a 
stop order on aalL ihtercerts 
involving "an Asiatic country" 
in connection with the visit 
"of an eiecutive of this country 
to that country." 
THe witnesses said they were 
unaware of it, but it was clear 
from previous diclosures that 
Senator Huddleston referred to 
a C.I.A. operation in San Fran-
cisco that sporadically inter-
cepted amil to and from Com-
munist nations in the Far East 
between 1969 and 1973. 
Senator Huddelston, glancing 
at documents, said the suspen-
sion request was made by the 
Secretary of State?who, in 
1972, was Willeam P. Rogers., 
Secretary of State Kissingere

Difference in Testimony 
Replying to questions about 
whether the agency had obtain-
ed approval of its program 
from Postmaster-General, Mr. 
Helms was occasionally at vani-I 
ame.with two of the three wit-I 
nesses this morning; all former 
Postmasters General. 
They were J. Edward Day, 
Postmaster General trom 1961 
to 1963, and Winton M. 
Blount, who held that position 
from 1969 ?to 1971. 
The third was John A. 
Gronouski, who headed the 
Post Office Department from 
1963 to 1965; he said flatly 
and angrily that he knew noth-
ing- of the program and would 
have opposed it if he had. This 
was confirmed both by Mr., 
Helms and -by an internal 
C.I.A. memorandum. 
Mr. Day, however, said that 
shortly after he took office in 
1961, Mr. Helms, Mr.: Dulles 
(who died in 1969) and Kermit 
Roosevelt, then a C.I.A. offi-
cial, visited him, saying they 
wanted to tell -him "something 
very secret." Mr. pay recalled 
that his reply was: "Do I have 
to know about it?" And was 
told he did not. He added that 
he was "sure that I wasn't told 
anything about opening mail." 
Told of Secret 'Project' 
Mr. Blount said be was told 
about a secret "project" in 
which the Post Office Depart-
ment was cooperating .with the 
C.I.A., but not specifically the 
opening of mail. He asked if 
he should seek legal advice 
from the general counsel, he 
said, and was told that the mat-
ter of legality had been dis-
cussed- with the then Attorney 
General, John W. Mitchell. 
He did know, he said, that 
the mail of "avowed enemies 
of this country" was being "in-
terrupted"?that is, taken out 
of the "main stream." and the 
front and back of the enevel, 
apes photocopied. 
The committee issued a 
subpoena today for Mr. Mitch-
ell's appearance Friday, but his 
attorney, William G. Hundley, 
is expected to argue tomorrow 
to have the subpoena with-
drawn on the ground that Mr. 
Mtichell's appearance might 
prejudice a pending appeal of 
his conviction in the Watergate 
cover-up case. 
Mr. Helms, in his testimony, 
said he believed that "we told 
him f.Mr. Day] the truth about' 
the project," but that he' could 
not be sure. A. C.I.A.. memo-
randum referring to, the brief-
ing with Day says merely that 
the .officials "withheld no rele-
vant details." 
As for Mr. Blount. Mr. Helms 
said that he recollected taking 
with him to the Blount briefing 
"a couple of pieces of what 
we got out of the program"?
typewritten . copies of material 
't'hat would indicate that we 
had been reading the corre-
spondence between certain in-
dividuals in the United States 
and the Soviet Union." 
He appeared anxious to avoid 
contradicting Mr. Blount's testi-
mony, and said that perhaps 
he had not been "specific 
enough" about the program. 
Mr. Helms said that Arthur

been told only that the agency

recall if Mr. Dulles had told

Mr. Dulles's brother, Secretary 
of State John Foster Dulles, 
about the program, nor whether 
President Kennedy had been in-
formed. He said that he might 
have. told President Johnson 
during a discussion of C.I.A. 
matters in 1967, adding: "I -have

he said. '"The President can't

tort :of. activity]. But, some-
boars got to take the heat. So. 
let old Helms take it, and I'm 
taking it. You can't ask' the 
President to sign off on illegal 
activity." 
As for his assumption ?that 
'Mr.. Dulles bad resolved the 
legal question about the mail-
opening, Mr. Helms said in his 
testimony that the former Di-
rector of Central Intelligence 
was "a much respected figure" 
and "it would not have oc-

Three former postmasters general 
today told a Senate committee they 
never knew the CIA was opening 
mail. Two of them conceded they 
really did not want to know anyway 
and the third said he couldn't find 
out. 
J. Edward Day, who headed the.' 
Post Office from the beginning of the 
Kennedy administration in January 
1960 'until Aug. 9. 1963, said he was 
told the CIA was engaged in a secret 
project involving the mails but he 
said he shut off the conversation be-
cause he did not want to know about 
it. 
Winton M. Blount, head of the de-
partment during the first two years 
of the Nixon administration, said he 
was told that mail was being re-
moved from the Post Office, given to 
the CIA and returned the next day. 
But he said, "I don't know what 
was being done with it." He said he 
never asked if it was being opened. 
In contrast, John A. Gronouski, 
,Day's successor, said he was never 
told the CIA was opening mail al-
though he tried repeatedly to find out 
about any cases in which mail was 
delayed or diverted. 
"I THINK IT is incredible that a 
person at a top position in govern-
ment could have something like this 
going on in his organization and not 
know about it," Gronouski said. "It 
wasn't that I didn't try to know about 
it." 
' A CIA memo dated April 23, 1965, 
indicated Gronouski was not told 
about the project because a Senate 
subcommittee was investigating 
privacy at that time and CIA officials 
decided that the postmaster general 
should not be put in a position where 
he could reveal the project to the 
committee. 
The CIA has confirmed that for 
about 20 years, from 1953 through 
1973, it opened mail between the 
United States and Communist coun-
tries. Of the seven postmasters 
general who served during that peri-
od, the CIA has said that three were 
informed and four were not. Day and 
Blount are the only two still living 
whom the CIA has said were briefed 
on the project. 
FORMER CIA DIRECTOR Rich-
ard Helms has testified that he per-
sonally was involved in briefing both 
Day and Blount. He has said under 
oath that he told both of them mail 
was being opened. 
A CIA memo placed in the com-
mittee record said Helms personally 
showed "a few selected examples" of 
the product of the mail opening 
operation to Blount.

item relating to Eldridge Cleaver 
which attracted the PMG's special 
interest." 
Blount testified that althoubh 
Cleaver's name was mentioned dur-
ing the meeting' he can recall no evi-
dence to show that the mail of the 
black revolutionary was being 
opened. 
Both Blount and Day told the com-
mittee that they believed the CIA 
was protecting the national interest 
and should not be impeded. 
"I THOUGHT THEN and I think 
now that the CIA has certain powers 
that put them in a different class 
from other people . .The CIA is 
something different and very spe-
cial," Day said. 
Sen. Walter F", Mondale. D-Minn., 
responded, "We are both lawyers. I 
don't recall seeing that in the Consti-
tution." 
Blount said he supported any CIA 
project as long as it was legal. He 
said he assumed the mail opening 
was legal because Helms told him 
that then Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell 
had been informed. 
The..CIA has since conceded the 
operation was illegal. 
"My understanding was that mail 
would be removed to the mail stream 
and given to the CIA and returned to 
the mail stream the next day," 
Blount said. 
"After being read?" Mondale 
asked. 
"I didn't know what was being 
done with it," Blount said. 
"Didn't you ask?" Mondale said. 
"I don't recall," Blount answered. 
The CIA memo said Helms briefed 
Mitchell the day before he saw 
Blount and that Mitchell "fully con-
curred in the value of the operation 
and had no 'hangups' concerning it." 
Helms is scheduled to testify and is 
sure to be asked why he had person-
ally supported the operation ? code-
named HTLINGUAL ? even though 
other officials of the CIA had long 
felt it was clearly illegal and of dubi-
ous value as a source of intelligence. 
Between 1953 and 1973, when the 
operation was stopped, the commit-
tee was told, a CIA office in New 
York filmed the envelopes of 2,705,-
726 letters and opened 215,820 of 
them. The largest single recipient of 
information from the intercepted 
mail ? 57,846 items ? was the FBI. 
Howard Osborn, former director of 
security for the agency, told the' 
committee his office was responsible 
for running the New York operation, 
but he said he did it for another CIA 
division. 
"it was their Cadillac. They built it, 
they drove it. My job was to maintain 
it, to change the oil," he explained, 
and then added, a few minutes later:-

Mail Spies 
Stopped 
By Fear 
By Norman Kempster 
Washington Star Staff Writer 
William Cotter, the for-
mer chief postal inspector 
cast by the Rockefeller 
Commission in the role of 
hero for stopping the CIA's 
mail opening program, 
says he acted only out of. 
fear that the cover had al-
ready blown off the opera-
tion. 
Cotter told the Senate 
Intelligence Committee he 
became concerned that the 
project had been discovered 
after he received a letter 
from the Federation of 
American Scientists asking 
if the Post Office permits 
other agencies of govern-
ment to open first-class 
mail. 
The question fit perfectly 
the 20-year operation in 
which postal employes 
turned their heads while the 
CIA rifled mail sacks look-
ing for suspicious letters. 
"It appeared to me that 
the project was known," 
Cotter said. He noted that 
the federation's member-
ship included one former 
CIA official and a number 
of scientists with high se-
curity clearances. 
? THE AUTHOR of the let-
ter that worried Cotter, 
Jeremy J. Stone, director of 
the federation, said in a 
telephone interview that his 
question was just a shot in 
the dark. He said he was 
asking a number of agen-
cies questions about priva-
cy. ' 
Cotter ultimatly wrote a 
flat denial of any mail 
opening in a letter to Stone. 
He admitted to the sena-
tors: "I knew it was false." 
But motivated by the let-
ter from Stone, Cotter said 
he urged CIA Director 
Richard Helms to termi-
nate the project. CIA docu-
ments indicate that Helms 
briefed Atty. Gen. John N. 
Mitchell and Postmaster 
General Winton Blount on 
the project and decided to 
continue it when the two 
Nixon Cabinet members 
expressed no objections. 
After Mitchell and Blount 
left the government, Cotter 
said he renewed his request 
that the project be termi-
nated. CIA Director Wil-
liam E. Colby scrapped the 
operation shortly after he 
_succeeded Helms in 1973. . 
SATURDA:Y, OCTOBER 
25, 1975 
Mitchell Denies He Knew of Mail Opening 
By NICHOLAS M. HORROCK 
Special to The New York ThateS 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24-7, 
Former Attorney General John 
N. Mitchell told a Senate com-
mittee under oath today that 
officials of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency and Federal 
Bureau of Investigation had 
never told him that the agen-
cies were secretly opening mail. 
His testimony before the Sen-
ate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence appeared to conflict 
with a statement made Wednes-
day by Richard Helms, former 
director of the C.I.A., who 
COTTER, WHO became 
chief postal inspector in 
1969, knew about the mail 
opening because of an 18-
year career with the CIA. 
The CIA said earlier this 
week that 215,000 pieces of 
mail were opened in New 
York, the largest of four 
mail interceptions. Only 
mail between the United 
States and Communist 
countries was intercepted. 
The committee likened 
to testimony for about five 
hours yesterday in an effort 
to determine who knew 
about the mail opening ef-
fort and who authorized it. 
The results were often con-
tradictory. 
Helms, making his 19th 
trip to Washington since he 
was named ambassador to 
Iran in 1973, testified that 
he briefed both Mitchell and 
Blount on the mail opening 
program, showing them 
samples of material obtain-
ed from reading the letters. 
Blount testified earlier in 
the day that, although 
Helms had discussed a se-
cret CIA project that in-
volved diverting mail, he 
was never told the letters 
were being opened. 
MITCHELL, whom the 
committee hopes to ques-
tion in a public sesssion 
tomorrow, has told the 
.panel in executive sesssion 
that he remembers the 
Helms briefing, but he 
thought it referred to 
examination of the outside 
of envelopes without open-
ing them. Examining the 
outside of envelopes is 
legal; opening them is a 
violation of the law. 
- Helms said he showed 
Blount typewritten copies of ' 
intercepted letters. He said 
he can't remember if he 
told Blount that letters were 
being opened, but he said 
he assumed that Blount 
would know there was no 
other way to copy the con-
tents. 
"Perhaps I wasn't specif-
ic enough." Helms- said. 
testified that he advised Mr. 
Mitchell of the mail-opening 
project in June, 1970. 
Mr. Helms said he had told 
the Attorney General about a 
"mail cover" and acknowledged 
that "in those times I'm not 
sure the Attorney General 
knew the difference" between 
"mail cover" and actual mail 
opening. 
A mail cover, Mr. Mitchell 
testified, meant to him that 
security agencies photographed 
the exteriors of the envelopes 
to obtain the names of the ad-
dressors and addressees. Mr. 
Helms, however, said on Wed-
nesday that he presumed from 
the context of the conversation 
that Mr. Mitchell knew the 
C.I.A. was opening mail. 
The committee chairman, 
Frank Church, Democrat of 
Idaho, told reporters that while' 
there was an obvious conflicti 
in Mr. Mitchell's and Mr.' 
Helms's testimony, he was not 
prepared to accuse either man 
of lying. 
? "there is no basis on which 
I could make such a charge 
in view of the possibility they 
might just have misunderstood 
each other," Mr. Church said. 
The committee also made 
public today documents that 
indicated that Nicholas de B. 
Katzenbach, Attorney General 
under President Johnson, may 
have known that the F.B.I. 
was opening mail. Committee 
sources said that Mr. Katzen-
bach would be asked to testify 
publicly on the matter. 
In a memorandum written 
on ,,March 2, 1965, ?J. Edgar 
Hoover, then director of the 
F.B.I., said that Mr. Katzenbach 
had talked to Senator Edward 
V. Long, Democrat of Missouri, 
about keeping information on. 
mail openings out of hearings' 
Mr: Long was then conducting 
in the Senate. 
The Attorney General, ac-
cording to the memo. said that 
Bernard Fensterwald, thea, 
counsel of Mr. Long's commit-
tee, "had some possible wit-
nesses who are former bureau 
agents and if they were asked 
if mail was opened, they would 
take the Fifth Amendment." 
"The Attorney General stated 
that before they are called, he 
would like to know .Nho they 
are and whether they were ever 
involved in any program touch-
ing on national security and, if 
not, it is their own business. 
but if they were, he would want 
to know," Mr. Hoover's memo-
randum said. 
. In a telephone interview late 
today, Mr. Katzenbach said he 
had "never heard" that either 
the C.I.A or the F.B.I. was open-
ing the mail and he suspected 
he had not been told because 
the "process is illegal." He said 
he had believed the intrusion 
upon the mail system was only 
to conduct a "mail cover,' 
which he said was legal in both 
criminal and national security 
cases. 
Mr. Katzenbach said that had 
he known mail was being 
opened he would have ordered 
it halted. He said that he had 
already told the Senate com-
mittee, under oath, in executive 
session that he did not know 
about F.B.I. mail openings. 
The committee in its hearings 
has established that both the 
C.I.A. and the F.B.I. conducted 
illegal mail-opening projects 
over long periods of time. 
Testimony by C.I.A. officials 
and C.I.A. documents have indi-
and C.I.A. documents have 
indicated ? that agency officials 
throughout the years knew the 
process was illegal. Moreover, 
one C.I.A. document showed, 
they had serious doubt that in 
peacetime even the President 
had the power to authorize the 
activity. 
F.B.I. officials testified today 
that the bureau tended over a 
26-year period to ignore the 
question of whether the open-
ings were illegal. The question 
was discussed only once, in 
1951, three former officials said. 
The F.B.I. conducted mail-
'opening projects in eight cities 
apparently without the approval 
of any Attorney General and 
without a warrant from a court. 
The F.B.I. legally opens mail 
in certain criminal cases after 
obtaining a court order. 
No figures for the amount of 
mail the F.B.I. opened were 
given. 
F.B.I. officials testified today 
that J. Edgar Hoover, while 
director of the bureau, halted 
the mail-opening project in 
1966. W. Raymond Wannall, 
now chief of intelligence at 
the bureau, speculated that Mr. 
Hoover may have discontinued 
the top secret project because 
he had "a regard, for the cli-
mate of the times." He implied 
that Mr. Hoover might have 
come to the conclusion that the 
political climate would not 
justify the illegal operation. 
Project Lasted Till '73 
The C.I.A. did .not stop its 
mail opening until 1973. Mr. 
Helms testified on Wednesday 
that the only Attorney General 
he ever briefed about mail open-
ings was Mr. Mitchell, in the 
session that Mr. Mitchell now 
disputes. 
Mr. Mitchell said that in 
June, 1970. he did have a 22. 
minute meeting with Mr. Helms 
on a subject he declined to re-
veal for national security rea-
sons. He has told the committee 
about it in executive session. 
Congressional sources indicated 
that Mr. Helms had been brief-
ing Mr. Mitchell on aspects of 
electronic eavesdropping used 
by the National Security Agen-
cy in tracking antiwar radicals. 
During this session, Mr. 
Mitchell said, Mr. Helms re-
ferred to mail cover as an aside 
to the main purpose of the 
meeting. 
Mr. Helms said Wednesday 
that after he talked to Mr. 
Mitchell he had met with 
Winton M. Blount, then Post-
master General, and told him;

that Mr. Mitchell had "no

said he showed Mr. Blount 
some "samples" of what the 
C.I.A. was gleaning from open-
ing mail. - 
Mr. Mitchell had sought to

his appeal of his Watergate

NEW YORK TIMES 
30 Oct. 1975 
RSA. CHIEF TELLS 
OF BROAD SCOPE 
OF SURVEILLANCE 
By NICHOLAS M. HORROCK 
Spedal to The New York Times 
- WASHINGTON, Oct. 29?The 
National Security Agency 
secretly scanned international 
telephone and cable traffic to 
"intercept the messages of 1,680 
'American citizens and groups 
and of 5,925 foreign nationals 
or organizations, its director 
testified today. ? 
The director, Lieut. Gen. Lew 
Allen 'Jr., told the Senate Se-
lect. Committee on Intelligence 
that the seven-year program in 
behalf of six government agen-
- ties, was halted in 1973. He 
said that N.S.A. had not ,ob-
tained court orders to authorize 
the eleCtronic surveillance and 
had not received the specific 
approval of either Presidents 
Johnson or Nixon or of any 
Attorney General. 
? This was the ?first time a 
director of the security agency 
had described one of. its opera-
tions in public session. Under 
questioning, General Alien 
agreed that his public testi-
niony might be in technical vi-
;OlatiOn of laws against ? dis-
closure of communications in-
telligence data. 
His description disclosed that 
the surveillance was far more , 
vast than hinted at in press 
accounts or in the report of the 
Rockefeller commission on the 
C.I.A. 
General Allen ?said the Na-
tional Security Agency had sup-
plied intelligence on Americans t 
to the Federal Bureau of In-1 
vestigation, Central Intelligencel 
Agency, the old Bureau of Nar-
cotics and Dangerous Drugs, 
the Secret Service and two De-. 
fense Department components,: 
Department of the Army and, 
Defense Intelligence Agency. 
Senator Frank Church, chair-
man of the committee, de-
scribed the so-called "Watch-i litical information along with 
list" operation as one of tAP 
ri3tmilikflorfileketts6a2001i08/08 
-  
itspectS' of N.S.A,' s Activities1 
that he regarded as "unlawful" 
and apparent violations of con-
stitutional provriptions against 
invasion of privacy. 
The Idaho Democrat urged 
that the committee make pub-
lic a report on the other aspect, 
described as "Operation Sham-
rock," which Congressional 
sources later said was N.S.A.'s 
Arrangement with cable com-
panies to obtain international 
traffic. ?. 
i Senator John G. Tower, A 
!Texas Republican and commit-
tee vice chairman, opposed dis-
closure of Operation Shamrock, 
:as he had opposed the public 
hearings held today. 
"I do believe the 'people's 
right to know should be sub-
ordinated to the people's right 
do be secure," he said. 
, Senator Tower and Senator 
Barry Goldwater, Republican of 
Arizona, argued strongly that 
such disclosure would "adverse-
ly affect Mir intelligence-gather-
ing capability," as Senator! 
Tower put it. 
At a closed midafternoon 
meeting, the committee agreed, 
apparently without a vote, to 
submit the report on Operation 
Shamrock to General Allen for 
his comment on whether it en-
dangered sources and methods 
of intelligence, before voting 
on whether to make it public. 
Even without the details of 
Shamrock, the scope of Gener-
al Allen's testimony was un-
expected. He said that as early 
as the first years of the nine-
teen-sixties, N.S.A. had occa-
sionally looked at communica-
tions of Americans traveling to. 
Cuba. 
N.S.A. is part of the Defense 
'Department and is charged with 
coordinating electronic intelli-
gence gathering and with de-
oielOping and break,ing codes. 
On Oct. 21, 1967, testimony 
and documents disclosed, the 
ADepartment of the Army form-
',ally asked N.S.A. to help in 
,determining whether foreign 
;governments were supporting 
.domestic disturbances. 
The following June, after 
'Senator Robert F. Kennedy's 
.assassination, the Secret Ser-
:vice submitted a list of persons 
,,and groups that its officials be-
lieved posed a threat to persons 
it was protecting. It also, Gen-
leral Allen testified, submitted 
; the names of the persons being 
'protected. 
In the view of informed 
.Congressional staff members, 
Ist.his apparently permitted the 
- service to receive the over-
'seas communications of candi-
'dates for President, which it 
protects, as well as the corn-
'munications of the President 
himself, moreover. the N.S.A.'s 
computerized system, in addi-
tion to selecting Shreating 
material, presumably would 
have selected innocuous over-
seas messages about campaign 
activity. 
A spokesman for the Secret 
'Service declined to comment 
on whether it had received po-
sinatitin attempts. 
In 1969, theN.S.A. formalized 
its surveillance on domestic se-
curity threats under an "Oper-
ation Minaret." Internal docu-
ments 7eleased today warned 
'officials of the agency riot to 
disclose to other agencies that 
it was even collecting the in-
formation. General Allen said 
he believed this concern was 
to Insure that the information 
was not used in criminal prose-
cutions where its source would 
have to be made public to the 
courts. 
The data accumulated ? re-
ports averaged two a day at 
one point, he said?were hand-
carried to the agencies and 
marked "!): ckground use only." 
At the licietit of the various 
programs, Ile said, N.S.A. was 
scanning for information on, 
some 800 Americans at any one 
time. 
This included monitoring to 
discover narcotics traffickers, 
conducted from 1970 until 1973, 
as well as the programs aimed 
at political dissidents. 
In 1971eVice Adm. Noel Gay-
ler, General Allen's predecessor 
at N.S.A.,. - briefed John N.-
Mitche'l, then the An erney, 
General, and his deputy, Rich-{ 
ard G. Kleindienst, on the pro-
gram. General Allen said that 
the group had agreed upon 
"procedures" and that this had 
implied some consent by the 
group. He said the agency, how-
ever, had found no written au-
thorization from Attorneys 
General for the activity. 
General Allen also said that 
the members of the United 
States Intelligence Board, made 
up of the intelligence agencies, 
knew of the intrusions because 
of the fact that the agencies 
individually submitted names 
for the "watchlist." 
He said the National Security 
Agency had not conducted sur-
veillances on domestic United 
'States communications and that 
all its intrusions had involved 
communications in which at 
least one "terminal" was in a 
foreign country. 
Benson Buffham, deputy di-
rector of N.S.A., testified that 
no consideration had been giv-
en to the legality of the pro-
gram at any point. After a se-
ries of questions on legal as-
pects, Senator Walter F. Mon-
dale, Democrat of Minnesota, 
said "what worries me" is that 
:N.S.A. officials still view the 
'activity as legal.' 
- Mr. i'vto...:dale said that among 
the merrsage3 :hT:-.; A.. had inter-
cepted waa a ieque3t tc a 
"peace-LI" antiwar activist to a 
foreign singer to participate in 
a concert to fund the antiwar 
movement or to make per-
sonal contribution. The mes-
sage was so innocuous, Mr. 
Mondale said, it "raises the 
very 'serious question about 
how to contain snooping." 
He said the effect of the 
snooping "discourages political 
dissent in this-country." 
General Allen said that the 
security agency had rejected 
some names for the watchlist, 
mainly from the F.B.I. and De-
partment of Justice, as inap-
propriate to its intelligence-
gathering function mainly he-
cause they appeared to be tar-
gets of law enforcement. 
General Allen testified that 
N.S.A.'s, intelligence had helped 
the F.B.I. avert a major terror-
ist plot in one city and had con-
tributed to halting the smug-
gling of several major ship-
ments of narcotics. He declined 
to specify the inci2ents. In-
formed law enforcement sources 
said that the terrorist plot was 
presumably one involving Pal-
estinian terrorists in a plan 
aime dat American Jews. 
Concern about the legality of 
the operations emerged in 1273, 
at the height of criticism of 
Watergate matters, and shortly 
after General Allen became 
head of N.S.A. First he, testi-
fied, the C.I.A. pulled out of the 
narcotics surveillance project 
on the ground that it appeared 
to violate the C.I.A.'s charter 
forbidding a domestic police 
role. Though N.S.A. has no such. 
charter, General Gaylor said, it 
followed suit. 
On Oct. 1, 1973, he said, then 
Attorney General Elliot L. Rich-
ardson ordered N.S.A. sto. sup-
plying the' F.B.I. and the Secret 
Service with material. 
"Until I am able more care-
fully to assess the effect of 
Supreme Court decisions con-
cerning electronic surveillance 
upon your current practice of 
disseminating to the F.B.I. and 
Secret Service information ae-
quired by yo through electronic 
devices pursuant to requests 
from the F.B.I. and Secret Serv-
ice," Mr. Richardson wrote, "it 
is requested that you immedi-
ately curtail- the furn.er dis-
semination of .such information 
to these agencies."

White House Pushes Effort to Keep Intelligence, 
By NICHOLAS M. HORROCK 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28?The 
Ford Administration is increas-
ing pressure to keep the hear-
ings of the Senate Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence behind 
closed doors, the . committee's 
chairman said today. 
The chairman, Senator Frank 
Church, Democrat- of Idaho, 
said "pressures are mouHting 
on a broadening front" that 
indicated the intelligence com-
munity and the Ford Adminis-
tration were "more and more 
opposed to public hearings on 
anything!" The senator made 
his comments after a two-hour 
closed briefing on covert activi-
ty by the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
Intelligence community offi-
cials have said on several occa-
sions that they are against dis-
closure of details of present 
and past covert operations. 
"Just how do you have a 
public hearing on a covert oper-
ation without endangering indi-
viduals?" one official asked. 
THE WASHINGTON POST 
4It 
. . 
The dispute now centers on; 
the issue of whether the com-
mittee can hol a public session 
on the C.I.A.'s operations 1n1 
Chile. Mr. Church and other) 
members of his committee havel 
said they believe a portion ofi 
th discussions can be held MI 
public without compromising; 
national security. Moreover,i 
they point out, much of the; 
activity has already been re-i 
ported in the press. 
Leaks Are Charged 
Senator Gary Hart, Democrat' 
of Colorado, charged in a; 
speech today that the Ford; 
Administration and the intel-i 
ligence community "were de-
liberately leaking secret infor-I 
mad= about abuses under in-
vestigation by the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence." 
He cited a ?dozen news ar-
ticles that had the effect, he 
said, of pre-empting the com-
mittee hearings and putting Ad-
!ministration explanations in a 
:favorable light. ? He said the 
cmmittee had made a major 
effort to remain "leak proof.", ,

plans to publish a com-

months-long assassination 
inquiry. 
The Idaho Democrat said he 
saw no reason to keep the 
Chile inquirysecret either, but 
the committee will first at-
tempt to find out "how 
strongly the administration is 
prepared to resist" a public 
airing. 
Colby and William Nelson, 
the CIA's deputy director of 
covert operations, testified in 
closed session yesterday 
about the spy agency's work in 
Chile from 1964, when it spent 
some $3 million to oppose the. 
presidential candidacy of 
Marxist Salvador Allende, 
until 1973 when Allende was 
overthrown in a military coup. 
Two former ambassadors to 
Chile, Ralph Dungan, who 
served from 1964 to 1967, and 
Nathaniel Davis, from 1971 to 
1973, appeared before the 
committee yesterday af-?

called "containment policy," 
also testified about the value 
of covert operations 
generally,. 
The Senate intelligence 
committee has been running 
into mounting pressures front, 
the administration to suppress 
the results of its in-
vestigations, Chairman Frank 
Church (D-Idaho) charged 
yesterday. ? 
? Central Intelligence Agency 
Director William E. Colby 
urged the committee at a 
*closed meeting yesterday 
morning not to hold any public 
hearings on covert CIA 
operations in Chile. 
Church also told reporters 
at a mid-day briefing that the 
administration still opposes 
open hearings on improper 
activities of the National 
Security,Agency and that the 
White House recently objected 
to release of even a printed 
report on the CIA's in-
volvement in foreign 
'assassination plots. 
"The pressures are 
. mounting on a broadening 
front," Church said. 
But in spite of the com-
plaints, he added, the com-
mittee will go ahead today 
with a public .hearing. on the 
supersecret NSA. Church said 
the Senate panel also has no 
intention of abandoning its

with leaks, but William E. Col-
by, Director of Central Intel-
ligence, has said that disclo-
sures concommitant with the 
entire Congressional investiga-
tion the intelligence community! 
had undermined the agencies': 
effectiveness. 
Senator Church said that af-
ter today's meeting Mr. Colby! 
would seek guidance from the 
White House on whether he 
would be permitted to testify' 
before a public session. Mr.-
Church also made public a let,, 
ter from Philip W. Buchen, 
counsel to President Ford, it 
was the "general view of thei 
executive branch" that if the; 
committee issued an "Official", 
report on plots to assassinate 
; foreign leaders, it might da-
mage United States foreign re-
lations. . 
Senator John G. Tower, Re-
:publican of Texas, 'who is vice 
[chairman of, the committee, 
I said he was also opposed to 
!public hearings on covert acti-
ivities. . 
. Church said he felt 
disclosure "of the whole story 
fon Chile) is in the best in-
terests of everyone" since it 
would give the CIA a chance to 
explain itself publicly. He said 
the episodes were all past 
'history and would "not entail 
any threat to national 
'security." . 
But he said no decision was 
reached because "it was not 
Clear if Mr, Colby and others 
" would be prohibited from 
testifying" in public. ? 
Turning to the committee's. 
nearly complete assassination-
report, Church recalled how 
President Ford himself had 
encouraged a congressional 
investigation of CIA-
sponsored plots after the 
Rockefeller commission had 
been unable to complete its 
own inquiry. 
"I can't imagine how now it 
could even be suggested that 
this report not be made, 
public:: Church said. 
He said the objection had 
been voiced in a letter to the 
committee from White House 
counsel Philip Buchen. 
The Oct. 9 note, made public 
later in the day, appeared to' 
? be largely a complaint for the 
record. In it, Buchen said the 
"general view of the executive 
branch is that any report on 
political assassination 
allegations issued by the 
select committee as an official 
government document may 
seriously prejudice our 
national security through' 
damage to the foreign 
relations of the U.S. and to the 
position of the U.S. in the. 
world community."

Inquiry Secret 
Meanwhile, antiwar and reli-
gious organizations filed a 
8500,000 suit against the C.I.A., 
.the National Security Agency 
and four major cable communi-
cation 'companies. The suit, 
filed in Washington's District 
Court, charged that the Govern-
ment agencies had deprived 
some 8,200 persons of their 
constitutional rights. 
The plaintiffs sought $50,000 
in damages for each of the 
8,200 perso as. well as $100 
for each hour they were sub-1 
iected to illegal electronic cave-
- sdropping. The suit is based 
on disclosures in a Rockefeller1 
commission report of a domes-
tic surveillance operation in 
'which files were prepared on 
antiwar a radical leaders and 
in which th::: N.S.A. conducted 
cable and overseas telephone 
'monitoring on some 1,000 per-

The suit was filed by the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
as a class action in behalf 
of those affected by the pro-

vote appeared to assure that 
whatever action it recommends 
,will reach the full House for

Committee members said the 
panel could recommend that 
'no disciplinary action be taken 
against Mr. Harringtcn, a Mas-
sachusetts Democrat, or that 
be be censured or even expelled 
from the House. ? 
The last disciplinary action 
by the House against one of 
its members was the exclusion

A lawsuit was filed in. 
federal court here yesterday 
charging the National 
Security Agency and the 
Central Intelligence Agency 
with conducting a massive, 
illegal spying campaign on 
antiwar activists in the late 
1960s and early 1970s and 
seeking $500 million in 
damages. 
The suit was filed by the 
,The
Civil Liberties 
Union on behalf of 8,200 in-
dividuals and groups on whom 
the CIA and NSA reporttedly 
maintained files, opened mail 
and intercepted messages and 
telephone calls.

Mr. Karrington told reporters 
eterday that he was disappointed 
Lat not surprised by the Ethics 
Committee's action to investi-
gate Mr. Beard's complaint. 
He said he hoped that the 
rearings would focus not on 
the narrow of whether Kouse 
rules may have been violated 
but on the broader question 
of what he described as "the 
use of the C.I.A. and govern-
ment secrecy in general to 
short - circuit the democratic 
process and cover up illegal 
activity." 
He said his actions had 
been "responsible and proper 
under the circumstances," and 
added: 
"The implication of the Beard 
comrlaint and those behind it 
is that the rules of the House

itself can prevent the rtporting

the existence of a program 
known as "Operation Chaos." 
The groups and individuals 
listed as plaintiffs in 
yesterday's suit reportedly 
were watched as a part of that 
program. 
Named as defendants are 
past directors and other top-
ranking officials of both 
government spying agencies, 
as well as four international 
communications networks 
which supposedly aided in the 
illegal interception of 
messages being sent overseas 
by the plaintiffs. 
The suit claims the plaintiffs 
became the topics of "watch 
files" ce ''subject files" in the 
CIA because of their op-
position to the war in 
Indochina in the late 1960s. 
The CIA then supplied a 
`.`watch list" to the NSA so the 
NSA could intercept in-
ternational messages and 
telephone calls placed by 
persons on the list, the suit 
continued. 
t According to the 
Rockefeller commission 
report, the CIA began 
if Operation Chaos" to gather 
frlormation 'on* the "foreign 
contacts" of American 
eitizens here who were 
protesting the Vietearn war. 
As a part of that program, 
More than 40 undercover 
agents reportedly infiltrated 
plomestic antiwar - 
organizations.

illegal opening of first-class 
mail with the contents copied 
and placed in Chaos files, the

The Mail Cover Story 
When, Richard Helms became di-
rector,. of the Central Intelligence 
Agency, in 1966, he knew that the 
agency's mail cover program was 
.would be unless, as Mr. 
Helms now says he assumed to be 
the case,, some form of legality had 
been :arranged by Allen Dulles, the 
director when the program was 
started in 1953. 
That may. have been a logical 
assumption, but the trouble was that 
Mr. Helms, did not bother to check 
its validity with Mr. Dulles?"it would 
not have occurred to me to fault him 
on a matter of law." Nor, apparently, 
did Mr. Helms check his assumption 
with _anyone else who might have 
knov4n he just let the mail cover pro-
gram' go forward. 
That testimony and the rest of what 
the Senate Intelligence Committee has 
been, hearing about C.I.A. mail covers 
provide a sort of catalogue of the evils 
that allowed the agency to go its own 
way " fOr so long, to violate the law 
and its own charter with impunity, to 
become a sort of government within 
the Government.' . 
Mr. .Helms' "assumption," for ex-
ample,, not only emphasizes the fact 
that .the C.I.A. was scarcely account-
able ,to anyone, and that its power to 
operate in secrecy was, in fact, the 
power to do virtually anything it 
wanted to do. It also suggests the 
arrogant, expansive and dangerous 
habits of mind officials can develop 
when they can act in secret and with-
out accounting for such acts. 
Mr. 'Helms further testified that 
when he signed a statement in 1970 
informing Richard Nixon that the mail 
cover program had been ended, he 
had no intent to mislead Mr. Nixon?
although the C.I.A. mail cover pro-
gram -was continued until 1973. The 
1970 report, he said, ?had referred to 
an F.B.J; mail cover program. 
Of 'all the devices of high-handed 
government, none is more insidious 
than this?the statement that is bound 
to mislead although it was "not in-
tended" to mislead, that does not tell 
the truth although it does not tech-

nically tell a lie, that distorts or con-
ceals or obscures facts while appearing 
to be a straightforward response. The 
C.I.A. may not have originated the 
technique, but its officials became 
master practitioners. 
The Helms testimony left the im-
pression that at whatever political 
level?if any?the mail cover program 
might have been authorized in 1953 
or afterward, it was not by a Presi-
dent. He thought he recalled mention-
ing the program to President Johnson, 
more than a decade after its incep-
tion, although he could not\ be sure. 
But he could not remember if Presi-

dents Eisenhower or Kennedy had been 
told about it by his predecessors, and 
he did not remember telling Mr. Nixon 
himself. 
"You've got to protect the President 
from the dirty stuff," Mr. Helms told 
reporters after testifying. It could as 
easily be said that a man-in his posi-
tion, or Allen Dulles before him, had 
to keep the President from finding 
out what was going on, so that the 
illegal "dirty, stuff" .could, proceed.

NEW YORK TIMES, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 
18, 1975 
American Intelligence: 
'A Page of Shame' 
To the Editor: 
Samuel A. Adams' effort to throw 
some light on corruption in the intelli-
gence process before and after the 
1968 Tet offensive reflects a personal 
integrity which, unfortunately, has 
been increasingly under fire within the 
C.I.A. and other precincts of the in-
telligence community in recent years. 
As a C.I.A. analyst working on the 
Vietcong in Saigon and in the Pentagon 
from 1965 to 1970, I can confirm the 
entire thrust of Sam's charges. My 
only regret is that I did not have Sam's 
courage and foresight in saving 
relevant documents to prove the case. 
Some of Sam's critics attempt to 
represent him as an egomaniac on a 
crusade. Others portray the questions 
he raises as "arcane side issues" 
(R. W. Komer's Sept. 29 letter). These 
,positions reflect either an appalling 
ignorance of the nature of a people's 
war or a self-serving but transparent 
effort at self-defense by the time-
worn tactic of "plausible denial." 
The truth is that working-level 
analysts in the C.I.A. continually were 
diverted from following out leads on 
Vietcong strength; that ,they were as-
signed to other areas of work when 
they attempted to do so; that they 
were ignored or suppressed, as Sam 
was, when they persisted, and that 
these efforts at distortion and sup-
pression of the facts were common 
knowledge and were openly discussed 
at the working level. There was room 
for only one convenient "truth" in 
official estimates, as Sam has proved 
beyond any dispute. The choice was 
to compromise one's integrity or to 
resign, and too many chose the former. 
If the issues were fully studied, if 
special task .forces were appointed to 
study them and if the results were 
circulated in the intelligence corn-
10 
tect" Presidents, why should ,they be 
protected? The highest duty of any 
President is to take care that the laws 
be faithfully executed, and no Presi-
dent has a right to be insulated from 
the knowledge that his own sub-
ordinates are deliberately breaking the 
law. To whom should they justify do-
ing so, if they can, except to the 
President? 
Mr. Helms said he never discussed 
the mail cover program with any of 
the Congressional oversight commit-
tees to whom he supposedly reported. 
That can only mean that they didn't 
ask him anything, and he volunteered 
nothing, about such important inva-
sions of the privacy and constitutional 
? rights of Americans, and such viola-
tions of the laws of the very Govern-
ment the C.I.A. theoretically protects. 
So much for the supposed efficacy of 
Congressional oversight, and the will-
ingness of the agency to cooperate 
with the overseers. 
' Arthur Summerfield, Postmaster-
General in the early years of the pro-
gram was misled as to its extent, 
according to the Helms testimony, and 
his immediate successors were not 
informed of it at all?an early example 
of C.I.A. deception of its own Gov-
ernment and subversion of official in-
stitutions and processes. 
? That neither Mr. Helms nor a later 
Postmaster-General, Winton M. Blount, 
could agree on exactly what the latter 
was told about mail covers suggests 
how ad hoc and inadequate were the 
sketchy procedures later followed to. 
inform the postal department of the 
perversions of law being practiced in 
its own house. 
And when Mr. Helms and other 
C.I.A. officials tried to tell Postmaster-
General J. Edward bay "something 
very secret" (about the mail covers) 
in 1961, Mr. Day protested that he did 
not want to know, so that he could 
not be blamed for any possible leaks. 
Thus, he exemplified that' abdication 
of personal responsibility by Govern-
ment officials that did so much to 
permit the vast growth of secret, un-
lawful and imperial power in America.. 
munity as they became available, let 
the C.I.A.'s offices of Current Intelli-
gence and National Estimates produce 
the published results for Congress. Let 
the Director of Central Intelligence 
release to Congress the detailed rec-
ords and documents of the National 
Security Council's Watch Committee 
to prove that the matter was pursued 
vigorously and professionally. The 
facts will speak for themselves. 
The record is clear. It Speaks of 
misfeasance, nonfeasance and mal-
feasance, of outright dishonesty and 
professional cowardice. It reflects an 
intelligence community captured by an 
aginc, bureaucricy which too often 
placed institutional self-interest or per-
sonal advancement before the national 
interest. 
It is a page of shame in the history 
of American intelligence, and it de-
serves to be aired as fully as possible

WASHINGTON Within recent

providing such data. 
During the same period, a num-

have provided cover abroad for 
Central Intelligence Agency opera-

also have become reluctant to cocas-

very' much to mount a

widespread criticism over 
a similar effort in Chile no 
action was taken ? until 
very late in the game. 
What finally was done 
was not only very late, but 
very little. Contrary to 
published reports *pecu-
lating about tens of mil-
lions of dollars. of covert 
aid, the total effort to 
date, according to unim-
peachable sources, has 
been just over $1 million. 
These two incidents are 
in one sense closely re-

ways the United States is

For, whatever reforms 
may eventually be decided 
upon to restore confidence 
.in American intelligence, 
the United States cannot 
call "time" to minister to a 
key injured player. 
The US-British intelli-
gence connection has been 
very close since the days of 
World War II when the 
OSS (Office of Strategic 
Services), the predecessor 
of CIA, was established in 
part . because of Britain's 
desire to ? have a single 
agency with which it 
cciuld share information 
and coordinate clandestine 
operations to mutual ad-
vantage... . 
? 
The relationship ? flow-

tionship has not been fully

In the case of Portugal, 
-officiala say that Secretary 
of State Henry A. Kissin-
ger was particularly wor-
ried that unless Lisbon's 
drift toward including 
Communists in top gov-
ernment posts could be re-
versed, it might well give 
an aura of respectability to 
coalition governments 
with reeente?-zt members 
that might be repeated in 
Italy and elections in 
Western Europe. 
? If euch a trend devel-
oped, he felt, the very ex-
istence of the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization 
would be jeopardized. For 
NATO, ? art alliance de-
signed to stand against So-
viet political and military 
pressure, could not tune-
tion without exchanging 
great quantities of .classi-
fied facts and plans. And 
with Communists sitting 
in its inner councils, such 
information ? could not be 
kept from Moscow, in his 
view. 
Knowledgeable sources 
say William E. Colby, CIA 
director, in spring and 
early summer stoutly re-
sisted pressures to mount 
a covert.- political-action 
program in. Portugal, ar-
guing that word would get 
out and Congress and the 
Press would have a fit 
over interference in the 
internal affairs of another 
nation, similar to the reac-
tion to revelations of CIA 
activities in. Chile. 
As late as July, a num-
ber of other officials were 
backing Colby in the ar-
gument that American 
handsewere tied in Portu-
gal be... the hostile atmo-
sphere in Congress. In-
stead, they insisted the 
United States would have 
to sit back and depend on 
a number of West Euro-
pean Socialist parties, led 
by those in West Germany 
and Sweden, to help their 
counterparts in Portugal. 
Meanwhile, while no 
one knew the hard num-
cracy that . the Soviet 
Union was spending. about 
$50 mirion in Portugal. 
In early. August, Presi-
dent Ford complained in 
an interview with U.S. 
News et: World Report of 
the vitual ittmos.sibilttes of 
CIA involvement in Por-

tive climate on Capitol 
Hill. But a month later, itzt 
an interview with the. Chi-
cago Sue-tiltnes, the Pres-
ident :stinted of some in-
volvement when he de-
clared: "I dOn't think the 
situation" (in Portugal) re-
quired us to have a major 
CIA involvement, which 
we have not had." 
.Sources say that be-
tween those two state-
ments by Ford, the Ad-
ministration discussed the 
danger ef trendain Portu-
gal with some key con-
gressional., committees arid. 
a small-Scale CIA effort 
was approved and 
launched. 
Observers in and out of 
the intelligence conarnuni-
ty believe the CIA has 
been given a bum rap over 
covert action in places like 
Chile and Laos. Aa in the 
case of Portugal, they 
point out, the decision to 
go in and the nature steel 
scope of the effort, were 
decided upon by the Presi-

"advisers.

its pas ticipation in mili-
tary activity in Laos. In 
the? case of the United 
States, he says; it might 
have been forced by the 
Laotian government to 
pull out if it admitted its 
role Publicly, thereby in-
creasing the ? jeopardy to 
-American and Vietnamese 
'troops in South Vietnam. 
"It grew to a $20 million , 
to $30 million a year .ope'r-
ation, funded out of: the 
Defense Department's 
budget," the congressional 
source said. "But it was 
not an assignment the CIA. 
particularly relished, and 
it certainly cannot be 
blamed in that instance 
for running amok." 
In the case of Chile, 
Cline says, "Kissinger 
pushed .the CIA in, pre-
sumably on ? behalf. of 
Nixon." The operation, he 
said, was run from. the 
White House. 
? But he and others do 
blame the CIA for knuck-
ling under to pressures 
from Presidents Johnson 
and Nixon to infiltraye and 
report on the activities of 
antiwar groups lit the 
Uriited,States. 
Clina makes this dis-
tinction: if CIA had pene-
trated domestic groups in 
order to provide a cover to 
send agents abroad on 
clandestine missions, that 
'would have been permissi-
ble,. in his view. But CIA 
provided extensive reports 
to the White House- and 
.the..F14 on the. plans and 
activitieseof such domestic 
groups, and that clearly 
was improper. 
"I can - only . blame 
Helms for not digging in 
his heels harder," Cline 
says, referring to Richard 
Zitelms, who at the time 
'ambassador- to Iran. Many 
voters voiced. the same 
sentiment, saying that

A number of specialists. 
believe recent revelations 
may be useful in opening 
the way to needed reform 
of the intelligence commu-
nity, but they argue that 
the focus on covert opera-
intelligence activity, is. 
missing the forest for the 
trees. 
, 
? In their -tier; the two 
most import2.M. 
are: I) a paucity of consir,-
tently well thought-outs, 
well articulated and time-
ly intelligence analysis, 
and 2) .a penchant for 
oversecrecy over the last 
six years which Withholds 
from top intelligence ana-
lysts information, for in-
stance, on negotiations 
with the Soviet Union and 
the People's Republic- of 
China. Such information 
would enable the analysts 
to hatter know what to 
look for in studying the 
roams cf data culled from 
recennaissance satellites, 
agent reports and transla-
tions cf Soviet and Chi-
nese broadcasts and news-
papers. . 
Says one Official of the 
poor .qeality, overall, of 
analysis from CIA and 
DIA (Defense Intelligence 
Agency): "They know the 
single stones of the mo-
saic. They know- the color 
and shape and' size of 
many of them. But they 
can't put the mosaic to-
gether consistently." 
To improve the quality 
of analysis requires the 
recruitment of better ana-
lysts, provision of well 
thought-out programs of 
specialized advanced edu-
catiOn ? and training, and 
incentives to got out on -a

i4itelliL7enci capability. 
By William Beecher 
.Globe Diplomatic Correspondent 
V Anlilen_in. N ? The senior 
intelligence official official was trying to 
sum up his frustration and concern 
over sensation-packed Congressional 
hearings and newspaper exposes on 
the excesses of the intelligence com-
munity. 
. . 
"The whole thing reminds me of 
the last scene of Oedipus Rex," he 
said. "The king, having seen some 
wickedness and learned some bitter 
truths', walked to center stage and 
tore his own eyes out. 
"If the current process continues; 
we're in danger of ending up with a 
blind government, trying to cope 
with foreign affairs and military 
policy in a very cruel, tough world." 
This sort of arpprehension, 
though not. so dramatically ,over-
stated, was voiced in a series of in-
?terviews by a number of men, par-
ticillariy those who currently lead 
the iritelligenee establishment. 
But they and others . generally 
agreed that out of the present trau-
ma should come a 'Thoroughgoing 
analysis of what America wants and 
needs in. the way of an intelligence 
system, and reforms alined at 
achieving a better balance between 
ends and means. 
While experts in and out of gov-
ernment have a variety of views on 
.what is needed, there are some com-
mon strands in many of their pro-
posed solutions. 
The common elements 
? include: 
1) A new look at intelli-
gence priorities, with 
greater emphasis on de-
veloping sophisticated eco-
nomic intelligence and 
somewhat less on military 
fntelligence, especially if 
funds,are cut back, as ex-
pected. 
2)- A fundamental 
change in the present ar-

rangemertt in which the 
director of the intelligence 
community also heads one 
of -its components, the 
CIA. Most would separate 
the two functions and. up-
grade the former. 
3) Creation 'of a new 
loint Congressional over-
tight committee, patterned 
on the Joint Committee on 
Atomic _Energy, to scruti-
nize operations and con-
sult with the Executive 
Department on long range 
policies and on proposed 
covert activities. 
4) Some would take 
covert missions away from 
the CIA and establish a 
separate small agency, 
more closely, . supervised, 
for such activity. Others 
ivould leave the function at 
the CIA, but cut way back 
on such operations, per-
mitting political interfer-
ence in other countries 
only When a compelling 
case of American national 
interest could be made. 
Clark Clifford, Wash-
ington lawyer, adviser to a 
succession of presidents, 
and former Secretary of 
Defense, has been in-
volved in shaping Ameri-
can intelligence since he 
helped draft the 1947 law 
which established the CIA... 
He was White House Coun-
sel at the time. 
President Truman, he re-
President Truman, he re-
calls, wanted such an or-
ganization because of his 
conviction . that the bu-
reaucracy failed to fore-
cast Pearl Harbor not be-
cause there weren't solid 
signs and reports pointing 
in that direction, but be-
cause no one central office 
was collating and evaluat-
ing them. 
Following the Bay of 
Pigs fiasco in 1961, Clif-
ford says, he was asked by 
President Kennedy to be-
come a member of a new 
group, the Foreign Intelli-
gence Advisory Board, to 
leaks ?that they don't even 
confide in the heads of 
State and Defense Depart-
ment intelligence, this se-
verely constrains the abili-
ty of the intelligence corn-
muhity to serve the policy 
mkirg precesr egeetively, 
improve US performance 
in this field._ 
"I made a tragic mis-
take," Kennedy told him 
at the time; "The reason 
did was because my advice 
was wrong. My advice was 
wrong because it .was 
baSed- oh erroneous facts. 
And. the 'erroneous. facts 
were due to faulty intelli-
gence. If we improve sub-
stantially our intelligence, 
then my adVice will, be 
better and I will, hopeful-
ly, not make another mis-
take of this magnitude." . 
. Clifford served for 
seven years on The ?board, 
first as a-. member and 
later as. chairman. :From-
this background, he has a-
number of suggestions to 
improve the current Intel, 
ligence set up. 
He urges a new law 
'which would take from 
the e National Security 
Council the primary re-
sponsibility for making 
policy for the intelligence_ 
Community and vest it, in-

White House.. Any pro-
posed covort actions, for 
example, would have to be 
cleared by him. 
He would consult, regu-
larly and closely, with a 
new ? special oversight 
committee with a small 
number of senior members 
from, both houses of Con-
gress. 
"This man would keep 
the President fully in-
formed of all important 
developments in intelli-
gence; if he needed a 
Presidential decision, he 
would get ? it, quickly," 
Clifford says. - 
He feels true oversight 
has not been performed in 
Congress for years. And 
he believes that the secre-
taries of State and Defense 
are much too busy running 
their departments to give 
more than cursory atten-
tion to overseeing the in-
telligence community. 
Clifford says that at the 
Present time the director 
of Central Intelligence 
will come before the Na-
tional Security Council, 
sketch out a problem and 
make a recommendation 
for perhaps a covert action 
/program. 
? 
? "The pushed, harried 
men at that meeting will 
say: 'It sounds O.K., pi 
tahead.' CIA will thus have 
a charter to go from point 
A to point B. But in the 
field it will appear to the 
operators the events ? are 
pushing' them to Point C, 
then to D and E. And then 
the roof falls in. In point 
of fact, they were only au-
? thorized a limited opera-
tion from A to B." 
Clifford feels that with 
a small, new agency set up 
to handle only covert pro-
grams, it would have to 
clear each and every stop 
directly with the new in-
telligence czar. And he, in 
turn, would consult, as 
necessary, with the Presi-
dent and the special Con-
gressional group. 
He feels that very few 
covert programs would be 
authorized under this ap-
proach, and that the effort 
in Chile would not have 
passed the test as being 
vital to US national inter-
ests.

ical question as to what

Under the CIA Cloak 
M.1:1Z1390, 411110NaliSONIMErtlffir  
Ac-cording to Walter Mondale, the Demo-
cratic Senator from Minnesota, the present 
proceedings of the Senate Select Committee 
on Intelligence Activities are 'more import-
ant than the Watergate hearings - possibly 
the most important hearings in the history 
of our country'. There have certainly been 
enough sensational revelations about illegal 
techniques and vicious hardware (dart-guns 
and shellfish poison) to disturb the glazed 
approval with which the American public 
traditionally regards the CIA and the FBI. 
The Committee itself is aiming somewhat 
deeper: at how the intelligence agencies are 
and can be made accountable to the Presi-
dent and to Congress. Such a scrutiny is cer-
tainly overdue, since congressional super-
vision has long been weakly complaisant, 
and presidents have been more interested in 
hearing about results than methods. In addi-
tion, presidential attitudes to the FBI were 
long conditioned by the secret files which 
J. Edgar Hoover built up on important 
public figures. Kennedy, asked why he re-
appointed Hoover, replied: 'You don't fire 
God'; while Johnson, a rich source of 
coarse wit, commented: 'It's better to have 
him inside the 'tent pissing out than out-
side the tent pissing in.' 
The Senate Committee is not a very 
wieldy institution, either for intensive cross-
examination (each of the ten Senators has 
ten minutes with a witness), or for a serious 
exchange of ideas (three of the ten minutes 
are usually taken up with a harangue, 
sometimes patriotic, sometimes moral, 
sometimes folksy, sometimes, hideously, all 
three). Moreover, there are side-issues which 
often take over from the investigation. With 
election year coming up, and gavel-to-gavel 
television coverage available, the Senators 
are on good form: the younger DemOcrats 
are in feisty mood, throw moral fits towards 
the camera, and call for Nixon to be sub-
poenaed; the Republicans soft-pedal the 
past, and take it out on the bureaucrat serv-
ed up -as the day's victim. The chairman, 
Frank Church, neat and broad-jawed in the 
Kennedy mould, with a matching electric-
guitar voice, is bucking discreetly for the 
Democratic nomination; and his recitation 
of the Presidential Oath (without notes), 
ostensibly to emphasise Richard Nixon's 
dereliction of duty, has an added resonance 
to it. Despite all this calculated theatricality, 
however, the plot-line remains vividly clear. 
The present hearings, part of the con-
tinuing backwash from Watergate, develop-
ed from the discovery of what was known 
as the 'Huston plan'. Named after a Nixon 
White House aide, this was a strategy de-
signed in 1970 to counteract campus 
violence and the anti-war protest move-
ment; it involved black-bag jobs (as break-
ins are called in the sanitised vocabulary of 
intelligence work), mail-opening pro-
grammes, and the vigorous harassment of 
. political activists. It also proposed domestic 
spying by the CIA, in direct violation of 
the agency's charter. President Islisoa gave 
official approval to the Huston plan on 23 
July 1970; but five days later, after pres-
sure from Hoover and Attorney-General 
John Mitchell, he revoked his approval. 
Both decisions were completely hollow: the 
first, since most of the illegal techniques 
suggested in the Huston plan had already 
been in use by the FBI and CIA for 
decades; the second, since both agencies 
went ahead and behaved as if the plan had 
been approved. 
It was a classic example of executive im-
potence. The CIA, for example, immedi-
ately began to expand the mail-opening 
programme which it had run on suspected 
dissidents since 1952 (its varied victims had 
included Senator Edward Kennedy, John 
Steinbeck, Martin Luther King, Richard 
Nixon himself, and, ironically, Frank 
Church). Meanwhile the FBI, which had 
had great difficulty in infiltrating student 
movements, had sought, and been refused, 
permission to recruit agents under the age 
of 21; it nevertheless went straight ahead 
with the proposal, and its teenaged inform-
ants enabled thciusands of extra files to be 
opened on suspected dissidents. These files, 
illegally compiled, are presumably still held. 
Truly, as Frank Church put it, the intelli-
gence agencies had begun to operate as 
'independent fiefdoms', keeping the Presi-
dent ignorant of everything which, in their 
judgment, he did not need to know. 
The reasons for acting unconstitutionally 
and illegally are easily explained: such 
methods are less trouble, they bring results, 
and anyway the other side is already using 
them. One of the few witnesses to approach 
candour on the subject was James Angleton, 
the former chief of CIA counter-intelli-
gence. A gaunt, rather stylised patrician 
who cultivates orchids in his spare time, 
Angleton was reputedly the man who put 
the finger on Philby, and was forced into 
retirement last year because of his opposi-
tion to d?nte. In an unguarded piece of 
testimony which he subsequently described 
as 'imprudent' but did not withdraw, he 
pronounced it 'inconceivable that a secret 
intelligence arm of the government has to 
comply with all the overt orders of the 
government'. It was a belief which followed 
ill on the assurance voiced earlier by ex-
CIA Director. Richard Helms: 'The nation 
must to a degree take it on faith that we, 
too, are honourable men devoted to her 
service.' 
When Angleton was asked to evaluate 
the usefulness of the CIA's illegal activi-
ties, he cited the case of Kathy Boudin, a 
member of a group of Weathermen who 
blew up the Manhattan house in which 
they were making bombs in 1970. The FBI's 
investigations produced virtually nothing on 
her; but the CIA's mail coverage pro-
gramme turned up some 50 letters which 
related to her activities. 
Almost by arrangement it seemed, the 
next witness, Charles Brennan, a former 
assistant director of the FBI, emphasised 
the frustrations and failures of sticking to 
the law. A? chubby, nervous apparatchik, 
suspiciously eager to please, Brennan out-
lined an FBI plan devised when informa-
tion on foreign spies working in the United 
States was at a low ebb. This was a scheme 
of `trash coverage', and involved the bureau 
systematically sifting through the dustbins 
of suspected communist agents. The revela-
16 
tamed nothing but garbage drew the loudest 
laughter of the hearings; but even this 
seemed to underline the stance which the 
intelligence services were taking before the 
committee. Either we stick to the letter of 
the law, they appeared to imply, in which 
case we remain empty-handed and ridicul-
ous; or we use dubious methods, and get 
results. 
It is, of course, an illusory dilemma, since 
there are two more possibilities: legal com-
petence, and illegal incompetence. Indeed, 
the latter may well turn out to characterise 
the recent activities of the CIA, since a 
concurrent House investigation under Con-
gressman Otis Pike into the agency's actual 
efficiency has already revealed startling 
failures over the ret offensive and the Yom 
Kippur war. Even with an efficient intelli-
gence service, however, the Executive must 
be able to control it. The Senate Committee 
returns restlessly to this question, with little 
enough help, not surprisingly, from its 
witnesses. Asked how he thought the 
agencies could be made to act within the 
law, Angleton brazenly suggested that the 
law should be adapted to the needs of the 
agencies; indeed, he even claimed (and in 
this was supported by Brennan) that if the 
agencies had gone astray it was partly 
through lack of guidelines from Congress. 
Disingenuous as this argument is, it con-
tains some truth. Tougher congressional 
supervision is part of the answer (at the 
moment, for example, oversight of the CIA 
is split between ?four congressional units); 
choosing a president (and, through him, an 
attorney-general) of firm moral character 
is clearly another part. As far as the 
agencies themselves are concerned, it does 
appear that they are now less eager to en-
gage in illegal activities: the FBI's black-
bag jobs (of which, for example, there were 
238 against 14 specific 'domestic subversive 
targets' between 1942 and 1968) were dis-
continued on Hoover's orders in 1968; and 
the CIA ended its mail coverage in 1973 
Of course this still leaves activities like the 
tapping of international phone calls (about 
which Senator Church has promised revela? 
tions), and the use of the Revenue Service 
to harass dissidents. 
But however much the structure of ac 
countability is tightened up, and howeve 
much agency operatives appear to change 
their spots, it remains extremely difficul 
if not impossible, to ensure the account 
ability of intelligence agencies whose pa 
terns of thought and modes of operatin., 
demand stealth, concealment and deceit 
Perhaps the most bizarre and disturbing dis 
covery made by the Church committee s 
far, and the one which is most indicativ 
of the thought processes of those under in 
vestigation, has been that of the existenc 
of the FBI's `Do Not File' file. This was 
system whereby the black-bag jobs which 
were done were recorded separately, an 
kept out of the regular bureau files. FE 
officials were thus able to submit affidavits 
and to swear in court, that their files con 
tamed no reference whatever to the break-i 
that was being investigated. 'It's really th 
perfect cover-up,' declared Senator Richa 
Schweiker. 'It would be technically telli 
the truth, yet it would be a total deception. 
Or, as Senator Howard H. Baker fro 
Mississippi, in his folksier way, put it: 
frightening.'

.Quiet steps are being taken to reshape  the  Central Intelligence Agency.. 
One objective: To free the agency from "excessive" Pentagon pressures. 
Another, to lessen the influence the State Department wields over the CIA. 
And, at'the same time, a drive is on to find more spies who are willing to do 
the tedious undercover work that a successful intelligence operation requies. 
Little of this story has been told. Here is a bachgrounder for you: 
The Pentagon comes in for some severe criticism by CIA's civilian  brass. 
In particular, scare-tactic lobbying by the military to boost CIA's budget --
the old routine of whispering to Congress that "Soviet subs are off the coast" 
at times when Congress just happens-to be considering appropriations requests 
from the Defense Department and the CIA. The growing view: No need for that. 
. Moreover, some CIA professionals resent what they regard as interference 
by the State Department -- "tailoring" CIA information to foreign-policy goals. 
(The charge that CIA figures on Viet Gong troop strength in the Tet offensive 
were doctored to match an Administration line is offered as an illustration.) 
? . To correct the alleged abuses, the agency is doing some intense lobbying, 
asking Congress to amend the 1947 law which set up the CIA in the first place. 
Specifically, CIA seeks exclusion of military men from its two top posts. 
It's also asking Congress to block any Secretary of State from serving as head 
of the National Security Council, a position that Henry Kissinger holds today. 
CIA morale? Low. Investigations and adverse publicity haven't helped. 
Nor has this: The agency has became infected with. Washington bureaucracy-itis. 
Too many empire-builders, some offices overstaffed, some methods cry for change. 
Vietnam proved, for example, that the British Government could gather as many 
facts with 12 undercover agents as we could with 700 people in the same area. 
Then there's the problem of spies who don't want to stay out in the. cold. 
The CIA can hireplenty of people who like to work in the open, bat we're told 
there's a shortage of men and women willing to go overseas and underground 
to pose- as merchants, taxicab drivers and such while serving as CIA operatives. ? 
-These Missions can mean danger, hardship, facelessness sometimes for years.

The Company Minds Its Manners 
The CIA is quietly launching a public-relations campaign 
to convince the establishment that its existence is worth 
preserving. So, the Harvard Business Club of Washington 
was recently invited over to CIA headquarters in Langley, 
Virginia, for cocktails and a little hard sell from Director 
William Colby. Equipped with charts and slides, Colby 
! 
detailed the structure of the organization, discoursed on the necessity for some secret operations, and discussed the 
CIA's involvement in the six-day Arab-Israeli war. One of 
the agery's Middle East problems, said Colby, was that 
intelligence agents in the area had not anticipated an Arab 
attack. A more fundamental flaw in their operations, Colby 
explained, was that the agency had not "programed enough 
irrationality" into the Arab- Israeli situation. He promised 
that every effort wouAlifirol9dtltParRilea's re120.04406108 
Meanwhile, over on Capitol Hill, the word is that Colby's 
courtship of the establishment may be a little "irrational" 
itself. A number of congressmen are saying that both the 
Church and Pike committees investigating U.S. intelligence 
activities have mishandled their hearings, and as a result, 
the CIA may get off the hook entirely. One embittered lib-
eral congressman explained it this way: "Frank Church's

it's caused a lot of dissension within the committee." The

IT SEEMS likely, when the Senate's.

us, that new and stronger barriers 
to Agency involvement in domestic

much less likely that any substan-

ability to carry out its "basic mis-

Congress any real change in CIA's 
mandate for clandestine in-

This is a pity, for there is need

we not, while retaining within the 
agency's sphere of operations all of 
its present open intelligence-
collection activities, put an end to 
its present excessive preoccupation 
with the collection of information 
by the traditional methods of es- ,

still tisten to (and if we are clever 
enough, even read) other people's

as in the past, to learn what we 
could from knowledgeable defec-
tors and other walk-in document 
deliverers, such as Oleg Pen-
kovsky. We would still take normal 
counter-intelligence precautions. 
Moreover, we would still have in

of intelligence analysts making

As for agency officers at CIA 
stations in embassies and ,consu-
lates through the world, we could 
keep them on the. job, going to 
cocktail parties and-circulating as 
conventional diplorriats do. The 
unconventional but sophisticated 
political reporting talents of agency. 
personnel 'abroad already largely 
focused on and concerned with 
open available information, are an. 
asset that would not be diminished 
by depriving them of their authori-
zation to act.,.fcr a feW-hours each 
week, like -"characters in a spy 
novel. All in all, then, an abrupt 
end to the shabby expedients now 
indulged in by our collectors of (or 
rather, lookers for) clandestine 
political intelligence would be a 
-long way indeed from total in-
telligence disarmament. 
Certainly the record does not 
suggest that Russia's immense 
vestment of men and money in 
clandestine intelligence collection 
has been all that useful. The, 
Soviets have been taken by sur-
prise quite as often as. perhaps of-
tener than their Western rivals. 
They did not expect that Nkrumah 
would be overthrown in Ghana or 
that Sukarno would fall in In-
donesia. They did not foresee that 
the United States would take pic-
tures of the missiles in Cuba. or 
react to them as it did. They have 
been as often surprised by startling 
developments in East Europe as 
the rest. of us. Yet in all of these 
Ce'ri*rifries the Soviets have long 
possessed large clandestine intel-
ligence-collection programs, and in 
some of them they have even con-
trolled the local intelligence ap-
paratuses. 
Is it, then, worth?'vhile for us as a 
nation to have on the .payroll at 
Langley a set of specialized civil 
servants to collect information for 
us by burglary, bribery and 
blackmail? For this is what we are 
really talking abOut in our sanitized 
language about the Agency's 
"basic mission" to collect clandes-
tine intelligence.. 
My own experience, as an in-
formation collector and intelligence 
processor of sorts in the Foreign 
Service and the State Department, 
18 
is that we could get along nicely 
without blackmail, bribery and 
burglary. No one who has not gone 
abroad on a diplomatic assignment 
.can appreciate how much our rep?i 
resentatives overseas are handi-
capped by the reasonable suspicion 
that they have been sent to bribe or 
blackmail their way into possession 
of the classified internal trivia of 
another country's bureaucratic 
machinery of government. Cer-
tainly, in my own tours of duty in 
Eastern Europe I have appreciated 
the legitimate anxiety of casual 
foreign acquaintances as .to 
whether I was other than I seemed 
to be. Was I. under diplomatic 
cover, Someone whose organiza-
tional imperatives made it routine 
for him to be ready to ruin the lives 
of his foreign contacts?in the 
presumed "national interest" of 
the United States, but in practice 
mostly to win points for himself in 
his home organization? 
have firsthand knowledge of 
one such Agency effort. The victim 
was a young member of the 
Ciec'noslovak Mission in West 
Berlin who had the misfortune to 
meet, and subsequently to be prop-
ositioned by, a free-lance An-ill-l-
ean journalist whose acquaintance 
he made at a dinner in my home in 
West Berlin. 
My role in the matter seemed 
harmless. . I inferred correctly 
enough that the journalist whom I 
was asked (by an agency employee 
in the US Mission) to invite to my 
house was not, in fact, a legitimate 
American correspondent. I had 
never heard of the news agency 
listed on his &ailing card. Though I 
knew,' thei'efoie,' that I was being 
used by the Agendy to help bring 
these two men together (this is why 
I took up the agency man on his 
offer to pick up the tab on the cost 
of the dinner)--I rather simple-
mindedly supposed that this was an 
inconsequential favor on my part. 
The Czech would be too wily to 
bite, I assumed, and if I 'didn't 
make the meeting possible some-
one else would. 
Several years later in Washing-
ton, a professor friend from MIT 
just back from a trip to Prague, told

me he had met somebody 1 knew. 
My ,young Czech diplomat had 
been assigned to escort him about 
Prague. Why was he no longer in 
the diplomatic service?, the profes-
sor had asked. The young Czech 
had candidly replied that he had 
accepted an invitation to dinner at 
an American diplomat's house in 
West Berlin and there he met an 
American correspondent- who 
made him an offer to work for the 
American. intelligence service. He 
turned down the offer and informed 
his superiors. But they, in the way 
of intelligence organizations?and 
maybe this was what the agency 
had had in mind all along?called 
him home and cashiered him. After 
all, if the Americans could have 
had reason to suppose he might be 
a weak link in Czechoslovak secur-
ity, then better to play it safe and 
put him on the shelf in Prague. 
An unimportant enough affair in 
the end, no doubt. Diplomats have 
to live with such hazards. But now 
it is no longer just the diplomats 
who come under a cloud from this 
sort of thing. Whole professions 
have been tainted by reasonable 
doubts as to:their bona fides. Can

The Senate inveMigators should

having this unWorthy and ulti-
mately useless activity continue-to 
he tarried on by tare& civil ser-
vants of the United States govern-

yond a limited effort to satisfy 
themselves that the clandestine 
arm of the agency henceforth oper-
ates more clearly within the agen-
cy's charter. They must redraw the 
agency's "basic mission" to ex-
clude the kind of reliance on 
blackmail, bribery and burglary 
that has become such a characteris-
tic feature ? of clandestine in-
telligence collection. No amount of 
fussing with the agency's operating 
instructions?no new ordinances 
specifying, -? say, what kinds of 
newspapermen may or may not be 
used in what kind of operations?
nothing of this kind will set things 
right. 
The Senators have, anyway, a 
unique opportunity to seek An an-
swer to the question of whether our 
own record over the last 25 years 
shows clearly land decisively that 
slavish imitation - of the Soviet 
KGB has promoted our real na-
tional interests in any significant 
way. 
Image Making. 
Eugene N. Mitchell, M.D. 
It would seem that in what is commonly considered 
the post Watergate era that Americans are in for an 
onslaught of redefinitions and new image making. 
Currently the media in most cities are about 
investigating government and its agencies. In a way, 
this is good in that many have needed a close perusal 
for sometime now. . , 
Abuses by physicians and other professionals are also 
popular topics, and most agree that certain types of 
exposes, while necessary, if not watched carefully can 
cause more harm 'than. good. Witness the ever 
increasing malpractice costs which, many- feel will 
seriously damage the practice of medicine in this 
ountry. 
Right now, alleged CIA and FBI abuses are the 
popular fodder for newspaper's powerful 
cannon, and sensational headlines concerning these 
co-called threats to our democracy are as common as 
raindrop's. ? 
That mistakes have been made is all to obvious, but 
if we're not careful the effectiveness of these badly 
They might try to balance the: 
Agency's inflated and thus far tm- I 
documented claims to occasional) 
modest successes against its all too t 
painful failures.. The committee 
should satisfy itself, for example, 
as to whether .the Agency has 
needed its license to practice 
blackmail, bribery and burglary 
beyond our borders in its much 
vaunted performance in gaining 
possession of the text of 
Khrushchev's secret speech of 
1956 on the crimes of Stalin. In 
fact, several copies of the speech 
were simply passed to US officials 
abroad by foreign Communists 
who were anxious to get it into 
general circulation quickly and who 
were indifferent to the fact that a 
decision would be taken in Wash-
ington to treat the windfall as a 
coup of CIA's clandestine in-
telligence collectors. 
At any rate, my own exposure?
in a Foreign Service career of 25 . 
years?to a representative cross- : 
section of the Top Secret output of 
the collectors of clandestine politi-
cal intelligence convinced me that 
the game of authorized blackmail, 
bribery:, and burglary has been 
as .little abroad as at home. 
Thei'Sehators will conclude as 
much, 1 suspect, if they try to see 
for themselves- 
needed agencies will also be ,seriously hampered.. 
-This is not to say that the CIA, FBI, doctors, lawyers 
and politicians should not have checks and balances, 
but to totally tarnish their images or ignore their 
individual and collectiite good would be a horrendous 
mistake. 
All nations have a spy service and as CIA Director 
Colby pointed out recently in a St. Louis visit, this very 
delicate balance of power must be maintained to 
preserve peace. It would be nice if nations did not have 
to spy on other nations but it's naive to suspect this will 
ever be. 
Certain types of abuses simply can't be accepted 
especially if they infringe upon our individual rights. 
Would we, however prefer to allow groups like the 
SLA, the Weathermen: or Ku Klux Klan run rampant 
and unchecked? 
Remember the violence prior to J. Edgar Hoover's 
getting tough on the Klan. And don't forget that groups 
that advocate overthrotVing our form of government are 
also a threat. 
. It's obvious when all facts are considered, that the 
difference between totalitarianism and the effective 
safeguarding of American freedom is a thin line. 
The one area of concern that is -intolerable is the 
allowing of politics to influence, our powerful national 
agencies thrust. This, obviously, is_difficult to control, 
and in the end, after all the investigations are over, the 
main control will probably still be the integrity of the 
people involved. 
Laws, can be legislated, but honesty, and integrity 
can't. _ , _

It was part of the new "openness"

The story one gets fir Washington 
Is that President Ford was responsible 
for .lopping off the assassination ma-

foreign "nations' to learn that their 
heads of 'government had been assas-

know everything it was better for them 
to learn it from Congressional hearings

misleading remarks-about news coverage.of the CIA._ 
Warning that U.S1 security is thrfeatened by a build-up 
of Soviet .naval forces and their existing intelligence 
system, Rockefeller said, "The Soviets-have, developed 
the most 'comprehensive intelligence complex the world 
'has ever known,- while we run the risk of destroying our 
Own intelligence system with headlines.'.',

Their weaknesses are that Congress-

constituencies, or. else they wouldn't be 
what they are. Curiously, none, of the 
Ervin committee :members who were 
touted for the presidency at the time 
have come through as real candidat. 
How about the question of legisla-
tion? The best bet would he to strength-

within the CIA by giving the inspector' 
general stronger powers- to roam-
through the 'agency. As for the Na-
tional .Security Agency, its scanning of-
global communications should get spe-
cific assent from the Attorney General. 
The Congressional controls of the 
whole intelligenee setup should be in 
,the hands of' a joint Congressional 
. committee of both houses, as is troe 
of the Joint Committee on Atomic En-

from the highest levels, and include the

Administration sources said 
they fully expected, and many 
approved of, stronger Congres-

sources agreed that President

would still have the final de-

? The board would be given an 
'increased staff to permit it to

agency proposals more fully. 
New appointments would also 
be made to give the board what 
one official called, "more Ford 
character." All current mem-
bers of the board were ap-
pointed before Mr. Ford took 
office and seven of the 10 
members were appointed by

The board was created to be

said. 
The move within the Admin-

on intelligence matters seemed 
to coincide with a sense of 
growing fatigue and irritation 
with the Congressional com-

on intelligence. "People are

? . By GEORGE VOLSKY 
Special to The New York TImes 
MIAMI, Oct. 19?The confir-
mation of a Cuban-American' 
appointed last August as direc-
tor of the Cuban Refugee Pro-
gram faces a new delay follow-
ing lengthy background investi-
gations by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation and other 
agencies. 
A spokesman for F. David 
Mathews, the Secretary of 
Health, Education and Welfare, 
who is responsible for the Cu-
ban program, said Friday that 
an-F.B.I. report en the appoin-
tee?Ricardo Nunez, would be 
sent to the Civil Service Com-
mission this week. 
"It's out of our hands," the 
spokesman said, adding that 
a 'decision might not be made: 
until December. Other Federal 
officials said they could not 
recall a "super-grade" appoint-
ment for which confirmation 
by the commission had taken 
sO long. 
Mr. Nunez, a wealthy Miami 
builder, was a top executive 
'of Gramco, a bankrupt invest-
ment fund based in the Baha-
mas that was owned by Robert 
Vesco, the financier who 
fled to the Caribbean after he 
was indicted on Federal char-
ges of fraud and conspiracy. 
Between 1959 and 1968. when 
he joined Gramco, Mr. Nunez 
Was an employe of the Voice 
of America. During most of 
that time, he has said, he was 
also an undercover operative 
of the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
His new $36,000 jab, although' 
subject to the confirmation by 
the Civil Service Commission, 
is a political appointment. It 
also requires a top security 
clearance.

inspector general's office and 
the inspector general is to be 
given new lines of command 
that will make it possible for. 
him to report to the advisory 
board, they said. 
Several officials were anx-
ious about the concept that a 
director of the C.I.A. could 
complain to Congress, about 
Presidential orders or that 
Congress would be "ombuds-
man" over the agencies. 
"I'm a little worried that

plied that making Congress a

written to resident Ford urg-
ing that Mr. Nunez be asked 
to resign to "spare the Admi-
nistration an embarrassment." 
In Miami, Rafael Villaverde, 
Republican who heads a so-
ilaP agency for the aged. 
termed the process through 
which Mr. Nunez was appoint-
ad'."our new Atergate." 
Supporters of Mr. Nuzez have 
isted, however, that his 
aide-ranging business and civic 
aetivities have qualified him 
4r the job. 
In late .August, after The 
.tl'eW York Times learned that 
Nuzez was a defendant 
a dozen of civil lawsuits 
.ere, the F.B.I. reopened its 
inquiry into his 'background. 
According to court records 
in Dade and Broward Counties, 
about 30.companies:and indivi-
odutis and several law firms 
are suing Mr. Nunez and N. 
B. S. Development Company, 
his land and contracting con-
cern, alleging nonpayment of 
,more than $300,000 in bills 
two other cases, the builder 
and his company ave been 
ordered to pay a number of 
plaintiffs. 
While not legally bankrupt, 
N. B. S. has no known assets. 
Mr. Nunez, who lives in Coral 
Gables, in a lavish home report-
ed to be worth $500,000, was 
a modest wage earner in, 1968, 
when he left Miami to iive 
in Nassau. Four years later, 
following the bankruptcy of 
Gramco. he returned here a 
multimillionaire, according to 
former associates. 
One associate said that part 
of Mr. Nunez's job at Gramco 
had been to coordinate sales 
in Latin America. He added: 
"We all knew that it was 
illegal in every Latin country 
to sell Gramco bonds. At one 
time, our entire team of 10 
salesmen in Peru was arrested, 
and it cost us a huge bribe 
to get them out of jail. After 
that our Latin operation went 
completely underground, with 
fictitious names, coded messa-
ges and all that C.I.A. stuff.", 
When Gramco collapsed, 
thousands of Latin investors 
were reported to have lost 
more than $50-million. Some, 
of them are said to have ex-
380g?st to American diplomats 
'dismay over Mr. Nunez's

The Central Intelligence 
Agency built up such an un-
dercover bureaucracy 
overseas that for a time it had 
almost as many employees 
abroad as the State Depart-, 
ment's Foreign Service, ac-
cording to informed sources. 
Shortly after the advent of 
the Kennedy administration, 
sources said, the CIA had 3,700 
employees operating under 
diplomatic or other official 
U.S. titles overseas while the 
State Department had 3,900 
bona fide employees working 
abroad.. 
The CIA officials were 
known in U.S. "government 
circles as "CAS"?Controlled 
American Sources. Their 
proportions in U.S. embassies? 
abroad were sometimes 
startling. 
Some 15 years ago. One 
source said, for example. 16 
out of 20 people in the political 
section of the embassy in 
Vienna really belonged to the 
CIA. 
En recent years, another 
source said, the CIA con-
tingent abroad- has been. 
drastically reduced, partly 
because of the 1961 Bay of Pigs

Em ssies In 
fiasco, but also because of the 
growing clout of the multi-
billion-dollar National 
Security Agency, whose 
technological eyes and ears' 
are considered more reliable. 
-You'd be surprised at how 
few people the CIA has 
; overseas these days," - this 
source said. Although the 
figure can sometimes jump 
dramatically with the in-
ception of new covert 
operations, this source said 
the current total was "less 
than half" of the 3.700 officials: 
reported on the CIA's secret 
roster in mid-1961. 
Shortly alter the CIA was 
established in 1947, a special 
study group headed by then 
deputy CIA director Allen 
Dulles warned in a still secret 
report against using State 
Department cover as an 
answer to all its problems. 
The report, sources said., 
indicated that the CIA even 
then had been making what 
the State Department con-
sidered excessive demands 
for official slots. The study 
group reportedly recom-
mended that the C IA develop, 
more "outside cover" for its, 
personnel overseas, ,such as 
that which cquld be provided 
by private business. 
The CIA, however, steadily 
increased its requisitioning of 
official government positions, 
sources said, because it was 
easier, quicker, provided 
more security and offered 
more perquisites for its 
personnel. 
By 1961 as a consequence, 
according to sources, the spy 
agency had some 1,500 people 
abroad under State Depart-
ment cover and another 2.200 
under other official U.S. 
covers, such as Defense 
Department civilian per-
sonnel. 
In some U.S. missions so-
called "CAS" personnel 
outnumbered the regular 
State Department com-
plements. At the embassy in 
Chile, for instance, 11 of 13 
officials in the political section 
in 1961 were from the CIA. 
Almost half of the political 
officers in American em-
bassies throughout the world 
were under cover for the CIA. 
The result, sources said, 
was often a seriousen-
croachment on State 
Department policymaking. In 
some countries; CIA station 
chiefs were able to command 
more influence than the 
ambassadors and at times 
22 
pursued different policies. At 
the Paris embassy, where the 
CIA occupied the top floor and 
in 1961 had more than 125 
people, the spy agency even 
took over much of the overt 
political reporting on French 
politics normally done by the 
"State Department. 
Although there are repor-. 
tedly far fewer CIA officials 
operating abroad today, there 
are indications that the 
agency still relies heavily on 
official U.S. cover for the 
overseas personnel that it 
does have. 
At the CIA's inception 28 
years ago, according to one 
knowledgeable source, the use 
of State Department cover 
was supposed to be "strictly 
limited and temporary." 
But in an affidavit this 
month that was prompted by a 
freedom-of-information 
lawsuit in U.S. District Court 
here, officials of the National 
Security Council claimed that 
disclosure of initial 1948 plans 
for coordinating secret' 
operations with other U.S., 
agencies could, even today, 
"prompt attacks on our 
diplomatic personnel overseas 
as. being spies and covert' 
operators." 1

ewers to a host of questions, although the 
coMmittees will soon have to halt their 
inquiries and put together their reports; 
bath face deadlines of early next year. 
President Ford has indicated that he 
will-be instituting reorganization proce-
dutese-presumably to check past abus-
esebutealso to head off too much Con-
gressional intervention later next year, 
when legislative changes arising out of 
the two investigative reports will be 
ready for passage. Meanwhile, the intel-
likence agencies themselves can be ex-
pected to do a certain amount of inter-
nal?house-cleaning. 
- Thus, by spring various reorganiza-
tion plans are likely to be in the works. 
And with an election campaign under-
way, the country can expect?and de-
serves?more debate than normal about 
the power and quality of its intelligence 
services. 
.. There will be charges and counter-
charges, and bitter disagreements over 
who is protecting the nation more effec-
tively: defenders of a relatively unfet-
tered intelligence agencies, or critics of 
allegedly too powerful intelligence serv-
ices. Then, no matter who wins the pres-
idency?but particularly if a Democrat 
wins, and brings with him a wholesale 
change in executive branch appoint-
ments?some further reAreanization is 
likely in early 1977. rprovea i-or 
23 
But what happens after that? Will the 
dust settle once again? What form will 
reorganization take? 
The answers to these questions would 
seem to depend, in the end, on the intel-
ligence agencies themselves. A strength-
ened system of oversight, though it is 
now the most obvious and most likely re-
sult of the current congressional investi-
gations, is not enough. 
The intelligence gathering process, if 
it is to work, must operate under condi-
tions of greater secrecy than any other 
part of a democratic government. Un-
like grand juries, or regulatory agencies 
and other quasi-judicial bodies that op-
erate with a certain amount of secrecy, 
intelligence agencies collect much of 
their information without the knowledge 
of the people who first produce that in-
formation. 
Any sharing of how this is done, even 
within an agency, is considered a risk 
perhaps greater than the original risk of 
seeking the information. The risk is evert 
greater when an intelligence agency en-
gages in so-called "covert action," 
meaning an attempt not simply to col-
lect information, but to change the 
courseOf events in a way that masks the 
cause of the change. 
Any oversight process, particularly' 
'one that might involve public disclosure, 
increases the risk to intelligence opera-
tions. Correspondingly, any requirement 
-for a secret oversight process weakens 
the independence of the oversight body. 
In extreme situations, something has to 
give?either the effectiveness of the in-
telligence operations, or the ef fective-? 
ness of oversight. With mutual trust, 
there would be room for give-and-take; 
the. agencies could give up some of their 
secrecy, and the monitoring bodies could 
give up some of their need to know, tak-
ing the rest on faith. I.? 
But that very trust is the missing in-
gredient at the moment_ The succession 
of super-discreet ?congreesionai etibeoin-
mittees that took care of intelligence 
oversight up till?now tilted heavily in the 
direction of intelligence activities. In 
practice, there was less oversight than 
this year's revelations would seem to 
have warranted. 
Now the atmosphere is different. Be-
ginning with the Watergate revelations 
of 1973, and continuing into this year 
with the two congressional investiga-
tions and one by an executive branch 
commission headed by Vice President 
Rockefeller, public perceptions of the in-
telligence agencies have changed consi-
derably. As a group, they stand accused 
of two severe failings: 
First, in their efforts to collect infor-
mation, the agencies admittedly broke 
.; 
Agency aimed at letters to and from 
Communist nations, and an electronic 
eavesdropping program run by the Na-
tional Security Agency on all interna-
tional teiephone, telegraph, and telex 
traffic. Also, the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation has admitted that it conduct-
ed illegal burglaries against U.S. citi-
zens. 
In addition, the agencies often failed 
?again, by their own admission?to 
meet standards of quality they them-
selves had set for gathering accurate in-
formation; standards they had told the 
rest of us to expect. Key examples here 
are the estimates by both the CIA and 
the Defense Intelligence Agency of the 
likelihood for unlikelihood) of a Middle 
East war in the fall of 1%7. As late as 
one hour after the Egyptiam;Syrian at-' 
tack had begun, these estimates were 
-still telling the President that no general 
offensive was in the works. 
Thus, judging by revelations so far, 
the major tasks ahead are: 
1. On the input side, to curb abuses of 
the law. 
2. On the output side, to force the sys-
tem to produce higher quality, intelli-
gence. 
? Some would go still further and say 
that U.S.. intelligence agencies should 
not engage in "covert action." _ 
Any new congressional oversight 
body that might emerge from this year's 
investigations is bound to. have these 
matters very much in mind, and to shift 
away somewhat from the old system of, 
giving the intelligence agencies the ben-
efit of the doubt' 
Just how far the balance will shift re-
mains to be seen, however. A Democrat-
ic administration could probably count , 
on greater latitude from a congressional 
committeehdominated by Democrats 
man the present Republican administra-
tion could. - 
Furthermore, any new Congressional 
panel?say one patterned after the rela-
tively successful Joint Committee on At-
omic Energy?Would eventually en-
counter the same obstacles that haunted 
its subcommittee predecessors. This 
conflict between secrecy and oversight 
would -also apply to any new White 
House monitoring group that Mr_ Ford 
might establish._ ' 
9
7" "77 ;: 
?- ' 
The. burden of change, then, is likely' 
to fall mainly on the agencies them-. 
selves. Each has a separate history, and 
a separate set of problems. But they. 
alone possess the necessary information 
to accomplish the two key tasks. 
Within the CIA, for example, there is 
a definite feeling of satisfaction about 
changes the agency introduced on its 
.. 
various laws and violated constitutional own in the period just before the con-
rights of privacy. The primary examples gressional investigations begareeTheee

But again, if past precedent is any

the CIA was founded in large measure 
by these same people (and their like-
minded, already-retired eiders), the 
agency has never really had a transfer 
of power from one generation to anoth-
er. 
This-is why the nature of any reorg-
anization that takes place over the next.: 
18 months is so important. If all the dis-
closures of the past two years lead only

DRIVE FOR BLACKS I 
PRESSED BY RI,A, 
College Placement Officers 
Impressed by Parley on 
Minority Employment 
Ey JOSEPH LELYVELD 
Speclat to The New Yorks Tants 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25?
There were cocktails and an 
ample buffet, featuring South-
ern fried chicken, in the execu-
tive dining room of the Central 
Intelligence Agency list night 
fo a group of college place-
ment officers As it happened, 
most of the guests were blacks. 
They had been invited into 
the sanctum on the seventh 
floor of the agency's McClean, 
Va., headquarters at the end 
of a two-day conference on 
"minority employment" de-
signed to drive home the idea 
that the C.I.A. is an equal op-
portunity employer. 
William E. Colby, the agen-
cy's director, whose offices 
open on to the dining room 
through doors that have one-
way locks, was on hand with 
other top officials for this rare 
display of C.I.A. hospitality. 
The guests were clearly im-
pressed. 
Dr. Joseph M. Wright, direce 
tor of student affairs at the 
University of Michigan in Dear-
born, said the very idea of 
coming to the conference had 
made him uneasy. Before this 
week the only C.I.A. man he 
had ever met was James W. 
McCord Jr., the convicted 
Watergate burglar, who had 
spoken on his campus. 
He would have been unlikely 
to mention the C.I.A. to a stu-
dent job seeker, Dr. Wright 
said, because of his own doubts 
about its activities and anxiety 
about "how he might react 
to my suggestion." Now, he 
said, he is not only convinced 
that the agency is a "necessary 
evil" but that it ought to have 
more blacks. 
Drive on for Two Years . 
Long stereotyped as a bastion 
of the WASP Eastern establish-
ment, the C.I.A. has been ac-
tively recruiting black profes-
sionals for two years now. It 
obviously did not have many 
blacks when the effort began, 
for only 1.5 per cent of its 
professional staff idc now black. 
(Of its total staff, including 
clerical workers, 6.4 er cent 
is black.) ? 
? The agency divulge k only 
percentages, not absolute num-
bers. According to the book 
by Victor Marchetti and John 
D. Marks, "The C.I.A. and the 
Cult of Intelligence," a 1967 
-survey turned up fewer than 
20 blacks on a nonclerical staff ' 
of 12,000. That works out to 
.0016 per cent. 
Yesterday, in one of the con- I 
ference's final sessions, the 
placement officers pressed 
F.W.M. Janney, the agency's 
personnel director, to say how 
many blacks were interviewed 
in recent years and how many 
were employed. When Mr. Jan-
ney would not give the num-
bers, suspicions were voice 
by the guests that the agency 
was more interested in image-
building than black recruit-
ment. 
These were answered by Mr. 
Colby, who followed Mr. Jan-
ney to the rostrum. But, at 
the last session of the after-
noon, Helen Kimball of the 
University of Kansas wanted 
to know "how much aware-
ness" the C.I.A. had of the 
economic and social barriers 
the average black had to cross 
to become a college graduate. 
Her question raised the ques-
tion of preferential hiring. 
It was answered by Dr. Ed-
ward Proctor, deputy director 
of for intelligence, who said 
the agency would consider the 
obstacles an individual had to 
overcome but would not estab-
lish special standards for 
blacks as a group."I'm looking 
for performance," he said. 
Orening Not Essential 
The one exception the C.I.A. 
would make, he said, was that 
it would hire a black who was 
"really first-rate in virtually 
any academic field that is per-
tinent to our work" even if 
it had no immediate openfng 
for him. 
Moments later, Merritt Nor-
veil, an assistant dean at the 
University of Wisconsin, said 
that blacks were not looking 
for preference. "The Russians 
don't care if I'm blue, yellow, 
or red," he said to a burst 
of arplause. 
According to C.I.A. personnel 
officials, the agency recruits 
about 1,100 new employes a 
year. Of these, only 2 to 3 
per cent are taken into the 
elite career trainee program 
t at prepares future intelligence 
oeratives. In all, there are 
about 400 professional open-
ings a year, mostly for econom-
ists, linguists, scientists and 
others with special sLills. 
The recruiting is done from 
10 regional offices across the 
country, which are said to be 
in contact with 400 campuses. 
Until the antiwar protests of 
the late nineteen-sixties, the 
-recruiters went on to the cam-
puses to condnct their inter-
views, the way corporate talent 
scouts do. 
Later they retreated to well-
secured Federal buildings, bnt 
now, gradually, it is said, the 
climate is easing and the C.I.A. 
is cautiously starting to send 
its recruiters back to the cam-
puses. 
In the last year, offcials 
say, the recruitment prospects 
for the agency have improved 
markedly, despite the revela-
tions of the C.I.A.'s illegal 
domestic spying activities and 
the well-publicized investiga-
tions these engendered. In fact, 
it is said, the publicity has 
helped, not hart. 
BALTIMORE SUN

Garry Wills 
FtI Motto 
Is to Save 
Its Face 
The revelation that the 
FBI destroyed a letter from 
Lee Harvey Oswald does not 
tell us anything new about the 
FBI?its highest imperative 
has always been "Don't em-
barrass the bureau." 
What is more important, 
the letter tells us nothing new 
about Osivald's assassination 
of President John F. Kennedy. 
We are often told that new 
revelations make it desirable 
to reopen the Kennedy investi-
gation. Most of these new rev-
elations are repetitions of old 
stuff, like the fact that Jack 
Ruby was a mob groupie. 
But the letter of Oswald 
was a new bit of information, 
and it just tends to confirm 
the Warren report. Oswald 
wrote the letter because he 
was mad at an FBI agent for 
checking up on his wife, Mari-
na, a routine the bureau fol-
lows with immigrants from 
the Soviet Union. 
If Oswald had been work-
ing for the FBI, as many con-
spiratorialists have argued, he 
would not write the agent a 
letter telling him to stay away 
?he would have talked to his 
"contact." In fact, he would 
probably have expected, and 
not resented, the agent's call 
on Marina. 
Then why did the FBI de-
stroy the letter? Because it 
regularly tells lies to make it-
self look like its TV image. 
Even without knowledge of 
the letter, some people find 
that the FBI had been remiss 
in not watching Oswald more 
closely. With the letter, things 
might have looked worse. So 
the FBI denied such prior 
knowledge of Oswald in his 
threatening mood. 
The letter gives us a 
glimpse of the reality that ex-
ists behind conspiratorial 
theorizing. The theorists be-
lieve that all people in power 
make up a clique of bad guys, 
whose interests are similar 
when not the same. They do 
not recognize that the bad 
guys spend a lot of their time 
fighting each other. 
The FBI swept much of the 
evidence in the Kennedy and 
Oswald killings off to its 
vaunted laboratories in Wash- -t 
ington. When the state prose-
cutors needed rot';. of the ev-
idence for the Ruby trial, they 
almost had to Lackrnail toe 
FBI to get it. 
The conspiratorial scena-
rios depend very largely on 
meet-meshings between local 
police, the FBI, the Central 
Intelligence Agency and the 
Justice Department. But local 
police often resent the FBI 
?especially Texas police, 
who still think of themselves 
as Rangers. The CIA and FBI 
have a long history of mutual 
distrust and bureaucratic non-
co-operation. That is one rea-
son J. Edgar Hoover shot 
down the Huston plan?he did 
not like to work with others, 
and especially with the CIA. 
In World War II, Hoover 
quickly expanded his anti-
crime work to the hunt for do-
mestic spies and saboteurs, 
and then expanded that hunt 
to foreign cities where he had 
FBI offices. So thoroughly did 
he take over the busy anti-es-
pionage activities throughout 
South America that William 
Donovan, when he founded the 
Office of Strategic Services,-
could not move in on Hoover's 
territory. 
Gen. Douglas MacArthur 
kept Donovan's boys out of the 
South Pacific, too; so the OSS 
had to settle for Europe and 
Africa. 
After the war, Hoover 
tried to supplant the OSS in 
Europe while retaining his 
sovereignty over South Amer-
ica. But with the founding of 
the CIA, he had to relinquish 
even South America to' the 
President's new army of 
spies. He did this with a nota-
ble lack of grace, and the bit-
terness engendered then was 
kept alive, like most of Hoo-
ver's resentments, through the 
rest of his career. As recently 
as 1971 he was again expand-
ing overseas FBI offices, 
against the active resistance 
of the CIA. 
So those people who imag-
ined Hoover's one-man band 
co-operating in a conspiracy 
to kill the President are mis-
judging the actors in the plot. 
The FBI has always tended to 
be timorous with any people 
but the very helpless?fright-
ened of embarrassing the bu-
reau, and better at destroying 
letters than at pulling off co-
operative ventures of high 
risk.

Jack Anderson 
'An Attack on America 
The Central Intelligence Agency's 
harassed director, William Colby, has 
written us a letter that deserves attention. 
"The successful conduct of both in-
telligence and journalism," he contends, 
"depends upon the ability to protect sour-
ces. We are deprived of intelligence today, 
which tve might have had but for sen-
sational exposures of our activities, not our 
abuses. 
"The solution to the dilemma of how to 
conduct intelligence activities in our free 
society is to give our intelligence 
organizations clear guidelines and effec-
tive supervision ? but through represen-
tatives of our people, not through the 
powerful spotlight of total exposure." 
We agree that total exposure, like total 
secrecy, could be hazardous to our national 
health. But the greater danger, we believe, 
Is too much secrecy. 
For-too long, the CIA has operated in a. 
subterranean world of half light, a world of 
grotesque shadows and shapes. In this 
murky environment, the CIA plotted mur-
ders, conducted burglaries and buggings, 
blackmailed diplomats, tailed _newsmen, 
'spied on dissidents and engaged in dirty 
trickery. Often, the victims *ere not 
enemy agents but loyal Amerianans. 
We believe the press let the sunshine into 
this shadowy world just in time. Otherwise, 
a subterranean creature might have 
developed, which would have become a 
menace to the freedoms it was created to 
protect. 
The language of the Constitution ? 
'justice, tranquility, welfare, liberty?was 
intended to protect the people from the 
government. The language of the CIA ? 
secrecy: surveillance, covert operation ? 
would protect the government from the 
people. 
Colby acknowledges "that the CIA must 
allow more light on its activities to regain 
the trust of the people. I believe we have 
been doing exactly that," he contends, 
"over the past two years 
Certainly, Colby has been more open and 
candid than any of his predecessors. But he 
has also a sought. to create it cozy 
. relationship between the CIA structure and 
the press apparatus. What he really wants 
are reporters who will act as explainers 
and apologists for the CIA. They would 
become lap dogs rather than watchaogs. 
The need for the press to occupy an ad-
versary role was clear to America's 
founding fathers. That is why they made 
freedom of the press the first guarantee of 
the Bill of Rights. Without press freedom, 
they knew, the other freedoms would fall. 
Colby claims we misrepresented. his 
views on Senate Bill No. 1, a 750-page 
monstrosity disguised as a codification of 
existing law, which would strangle in the 
crib the system of free inquiry we have 
today. 
"You say that 1-want 'to make it a crime 
for newsmen to publish classified infor-
mation.' This is not so. The legislation I 
have recommended," Colby claims, 
"would apply only to those who gain 
authorized access to classified intelligence 
information." 
He also states that his proposal "would 
require that any prosecution for un-
authorized disclosure be subject to prior 
judicial review to ensure that classifica-
tion of the information is not arbitrary or 
capricious." 
Behind almost every important revela-
tion of government wrongdoing in our time 
has been three ingredients: (1) the honest 
public employee who reveals the hidden 
truth; (2) the newsman who verifies the 
story, fits it together with other informa-
tion and publishes it; and (3) the official in-
vestigation that is thereby forced into 
being. 
As we understand Senate One, it would 
nullify or impair each step in this process. 
First, it makes it a crime for public 
employees to reveal classifed information. 
Second, the bill in its present form would 
make it a crime for a reporter to receive or 
publish "national defense information." 
The government would have the power, 
with some limitation, to define national 
defense information. Thus, the govern-
ment could attach this classification to 
OMAHA WORLD HERALD 
5 OCTOBER 1975. 
  erties' 
almost anything it didn:t want the people to 
? 
know. 
Third, the bill provides a loophole for of-
ficials who break the law in line of duty if 
they believe they were acting lawfully, 
thereby weakening the incentives for of-
ficial probes. 
Our professional estimate is that this 
package would shut down the investigative 
press quite effectively. Remember how 
President Nixon tried to invoke the CIA and 
"natidnal security" to cover up the 
Watergate scandal? Under Senate One, he 
would have gotten away with it. 
The're are legitimate defense secrets, as 
Colby suggests, which the government 
ought to be able to protect. Codes, nuclear 
secrets,: plans for military operations, the 
identity of undercover agents, crucial data 
on weapons systems ? all have a just claim 
to secrecy if they are not already known to 
the enemy. I. 
But instead of defining narrowly the 
types of information that must not be 
revealed, instead of writing into Senate? 
One the standards set by the Supreme Court 
for justifying news suppression ? that the 
disclosure must pose "direct, immediate 
and irreparable arm to the security of the 
United States" ? the bill relies on a long-
discredited classification system. . 
The decision as to which parts of the 
people's business could not be divulged 
would be left to the caprice of innumerable 
bureaucrats, such as a gentleman of our ac- ' 
quaintance who used to spend his days 
clipping articles out of newspapers and 
pasting them on stiff paper which he would 
Alien stamp with a secret classification. 
Millions of documents have been 
classifed, some legitimately, some willy 
nilly, some under criteria designed More 
for hiding mistakes than for protecting 
valid secrets. 
Senate One does not discriminate suf-
ficiently between the yellowed newspaper 
clippings and the latest weapons designs. 
And so, instead of being a safeguard for 
national defense, it is an assault on 
American liberties.

IF THE CIA had been able to impose 
its will on, and enforce its employ-

Agee, these books would not have 
been published. The Agency obvi-
ously believes that parts of these 
books are injurious to intelligence

After a complex Federal Court

some censorship, and so "The

Agee's "Inside the Company" is

seems authentic, but who on the

that.as a covert operator "you get

OVER the past couple 
? Of - months, we have 
:Written considerably on 
the chronic shortages of 
essential commodities. 
We hope we are not 
boring our regulzir 
-.readers if we make 
:6ine"_ fresh . revelations 
? on this -same topic. 
\krhiler: these snortages? 
have, not. brought a great 
deal. of joy in this country 
and . have been -a cause of 
severe inconveniences to the 
sort of life We were trying 
to get used to, they ha?ve 
brought a great deal of 
happineas to many parts of 
the world, particularly those 
near our borders where 
photos of our women queue-
ing for essentials and fighting 
over them, have become a 
regular feature on the front 
pages of their national 
newspapers. 
Armchair economists are 
writing haughtly about 
what we should have done 
and where we went wrong. 
Zambia has suddenly be-
come a household word in 
most parts of the world not 
because of our commendable 
efforts to sort out the mess 
In southern Africa, but be-
cause of our failure to pro. 
vide the basic essentials to 
the common man. 
A couple of nights ago, I 
Was having i few t1uickoneg 
with my mentor tuld good 
friend Cortiracie Bonzo. I 
think it was during our 
second refills when Bonzo 
caught sight of the collars 
of my shirt and expressed 
,grave indignation. He wori. 
.dered loudly if I had prob-
lems in my household. 
. I assured him that all was 
well and that the lady of the 
house was given ample 
-
housekeeping allowance bui 
there was just no soap 
powder to be had for love 
or money. I then complairo 
-ect t Bonzo and wondered 
if this country! was serious-
ly tackling the supply dilU 
-distribution problem or 
essential commodities. 
in ciesperation anti mil u. 
emotion, charged ants 
blamed our shortages on 
congestion at ports and ex-
pressed the hope that it they 
'operated .. more efticientiy, 
we would get most of tne 
essential raw materials h. 
'good time; 
"Nonsense," said Bonzo. 
"You have been reading too 
much of the 'Daily Noise' 
which is deluding the people 
about what is actually hap 
pentng to the economy of 
this - country.". 
? -"But it's a fact, comrade," 
-1 exclaimed, . 'that .most of 
the essential raw materials 
have been -stuak at the ports 
tor years." 
"But it's a fact, comrade," 
Bora?. "that any Importer 
anc manufacturer who' has 
essential commodities stuck 
at the port of entry can get 
these moved in no time at 
all by approaching the right 
authority. What do you 
think is the reason for the 
establishment of the Direc-
torate or Contingency Plan-
ning?" 
"Then would you blame it 
on low productivity of the 
Zambian workers?" 
"That's another rubbish 
propagated by the 'Daily 
Noise'," retorted BortZo. 
"The Zambian worker works 
just as hard as any other 
worker anywheie where they 
have no shortages. In face 
we have had these shortages 
with us for the past thiee 
years only. You can't Con-
vince me that the Zambian 
worker has suddenly become 
lazy and less productive. 
That's nonsenee, if anything, 
he has become a better anti 
etticient worker." 
"Would you blame the 
Ministry of Commerce then 
for not granting import 
licences tor essentials or 
that there le an absence or 
an effective supply, tied dis-
tribution policy oz essential 
commodities?" 
"That again is not true. 
The Ministry of Commerce 
is very generous in its issue 
of import licences for essen-
tial commodities and there 
I s in this country institu-
tionalised machinery for the 
importation, supply and dis-
tribution Of all essentials." 
Failed 
"Then, tell me comrade, 
what is the cause,, where 
have we failed, where have 
We gona wro'ng?".1;erlt

Bonzte as- 'he ? reached. for

"Of course I ain,

anarchy, and coups to 
the Third World. The 
problems we are going 
through over supplies of es-

of bur own making, that is

it under control."

THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY; OCTOBER 22;1975  
Andrei rnalrik, on '-D?nte 
The writer of the following article,   
a 37-year-old historian and dissident, 
is best known in the West for his book 
"Will the U.S.S.R. Survive Until 
.1984?" in which he postulates that 
hostility among various ethnic groups 
an4 an eventual war with China could 
tear the Soviet Union apart. Last May, 
? he returned to Moscow after five 
years' imprisonment and internal exile 
on charges arisieg from his writings. 
Barred from residence in Moscow last 
month, he now Lives in a nearby town 
and is permitted to visit the city two 
and three days at a time. This was 
translated from the Russian by The 
New York Times. ? 
MOSCOW?Assessing the advan-
iages of d?nte over the cold war, 
We don't have the right, it seems, to 
'say that detente is the alternative to 
ewer. The cold war, being a form of 
. 
sublimation of hot war, was not less 
effective than "d?nte" in averting 
a real war, because peace depended, 
and still depends, on the balance of 
-nuclear power. Therefore, _even a 
mutual 'reduction of weapons, should 
'it' ever be achieved, would not reduce 
'an'd. would not increase the risks of 
- ' The rise in armaments is ' a con-
sequence of confrontation, not its 
cause, and to a certain degree is a 
.  
consequence of scientific-technical 
'progress. Inasmuch as an accord about 
reductions in these or those areas will 
not end either confrontation or prog-
ress, the arms race if suppressed in 
'one area will merely emerge in 
another. A reduction in arms may be 
,a result of d?nte but it is not its 
esole nor basic content. Therefore, it is 
'better:to look upon d?nte as an in-
strument not for the safeguarding of 
peace but rather for the improvement 
of the world. Otherwise, there would 
be no sense in, detente. 
- An impression is growing, however, 
that, the objective of the U.S. in 
detente is precisely the safeguarding 
of the existing situation. It seems to 
be striving to entangle the U.S.S.R. in 
a web of treaties and mutual coin-
..mitments, and thereby deprive it of 
.the ability to disrupt world stability 
without concern that these ties might 
be severed. . 
'Soviet Union's Aims- 
:For the U.S.S.R. the side still on 
':the offensive, the-objectives of d?nte 
are much broader. The U.S.S.R. is 
-Striving to emerge-from isolation for 
rat- -least three reasons.: first, to use 
detente with the West to manipulate 
:the Western countries one by one 
rather than in a group, and this is 
.already happening to a certain extent; 
:second, to assure itself of a secure 
rear. in view of the hostile relations 
,with China; third, to overcome the 
economic backwardness deriving from 
the isolation. 
? 
needs technological and organiza-
tional .modernization, and this is im-
possible without assistance from the 
West. In addition, the backward state 
of agriculture compels the U.S.S.R. to 
buy grain regularly in the West. Two ' 
.bad harvests in succession without 
such purchases could shake the Soviet 
economy and even provoke mass 
upheavals. 
Further, d?nte is explained, as I 
see it, by two not fully clear but real 
circumstances: first, by the fact that 
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. regard each 
other as the only equal partners; 
second, that they along with other 
developed countries are beginning to 
consider themselves not only rivals 
,but also to a certain degree as allies 
._?somewhat like a group of well-fed 
in a crowd of hungry. 
I speak of these tendencies recog-
nizing that opposing tendencies are 
at work and that the U.S.S.R remains 
In the eyes of the U.S., as before, a 
destructive force. Whether or not the 
American leaders recognize it, a fun-? 
damental change in the foreign policy 
of the U.S.S.R. is impossible without 
a change in its internal situation. 
It is difficult to imagine- a state 
combining constant, suppression and 
violence internally with peaceful be-
havior and accommodation externally. 
Such "peaceful behavior" could' only. 
'be the consequence of military weak-
ness or of deceptive camouflage. 
Therefore, any relaxation in .the in-
ternal policies of the U.S.S.R. should 
be desirable to the Americans not 
only out of humanitarian considera-
tions. It is also vitally important to 
them for reasons of their own secu-
rity, and therefore can be regarded as 
one of the objectives of U.S. policy. 
Since the U.S., in working out its 
political strategy, chose cooperation 
with the U.S.S.R rather than its isola-
tion, two tactical variations were 
possible: 
1. To move toward rapprochement 
expecting that the cooperation of the 
U.S. and the West in general would 
gradually "soften" the U.S.S.R. 
2. To tie every step toward the 
U.S.S.R. to a demand for a particular 
change in both internal and external 
policies, understanding their inter-
dependency. 
An impression has been created 
that Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. 
Kissinger chose the first path as the 
one seemingly requiring less effort 
and giving visible results promptly. 
Mr. Kissinger sought to resolve in 
-barely two years the challenge of rap-
prochement with the U.S.S.R., a task 
-requiring, let us say, two. decades. 
Such haste possibly reflects not only 
the mentality of Mr. Kissinger him-
self but also the features of American 
mentality in general-e-the mentality 
of businessmen who want to see at 
once the tangible results of their 
Despite important military-indust- efforts. 
to the hasty signing of a series of-
agreements only for the purpose of 
presenting them to the citizens. on 
television and saying: "Look! We have 
done this and this and this!" But the 
U.S. is dealing with a partner with 
which it is dangerous to make haste. 
Even if the Soviet leaders no not 
possess the many brilliant qualities 
of Mr. Kissinger, they are able to a 
superlative degree to set themselves 
distant goals and also to wait 
patiently. 
American policy differs from Soviet 
policy in two other features. Foreign 
policy in a way is a pupil of internal 
policy. The mentality of government 
officials rising to foreign policy leader-
ship has been shaped for years by 
dealing with internal political prob-
lems, and all the methods they have 
mastered inside the country are ap-
plied abroad. 
American domestic policies are 
based on a play of free farces, settled 
by compromise, while Soviet domestic 
policies are based- on a ncecompro-
mise implementation of instructions. 
And while the U.S. may sit down at 
the negotiating table consciously or 
subconsciously thinking of compro-
mise, the U.S.S:R. sits down with the. 
intention of achieving its objectives 
in full, agreeing only' to fictitious 
concessions. 
The other strange feature of Ameri-
can policy, as with the policy of the 
West in general, is the treatment of 
the U.S.S.R. like a .small child who 
must be allowed everything and not 
be irritated because he might start 
screaming?all because, they say, 
when it grows up it will understand 
everything. 
.?Dr. Spook' Methods 
This prolonged "upbringing" Of the 
U.S.S.R. by the methods of Dr. Spock 
is reflected not only in an endless 
number of minor concessions by the 
U.S. but also in actions that are 
simply humiliating for its prestige as 
a big power:- This was most clearly 
illustrated by the reluctance of Presi-
dent Ford to invite Aleksandr I. Solz-
henitsyn to the White House because 
Mr. Kissinger feared this ? would in-
furiate Leonid. I. Brezhnev. 
-Such behavior in general is very 
typical for representatives of the 
American Government. Thus, an 
American diplomat with whom I have 
been acquainted for more than 10 
years and who recently returned' to 
Moscow declined for the same reasons 
to meet with me, although he did send 
expressions of his sympathy via an 
intermediary. 
Knowing the character of those 
whom the Americans are trying to 
play up to by such behavior, I believe 
that even though it wins approval . 
from their side it also arouses a 
degree of contempt. 
As I get older, it becomes

world finds its expression in simple 
human relationships: the love of a 
husband for his wife and parents for 
their children, the comradeship Of 
men, compassion, patience and simple 
decency; while any ideology and doe-. 
trine, if not used with care as a work--
? Ing hypothesis, may lead to the chop-
ping off of heads or, in the best of 
cases, to the stuffing of money bags. 
The fact that two persons who were 
able to meet more than 10 years ago ? 
without any interference and now, in 
. the period of "d?nte," are unable 
to meet does not speak in favor of 
d?nte's humanitarian aspects. ! 
It does not seem to me correct, in 
light of the long-range problems of 
, the U.S. rather than the immediate 
ones, that there is a desire "not to'' 
overload" d?nte, as Mr. Kissinger 
has said, with humanitarian problems,'? 
and to yield on humanitarian issues 
as politically unimportant and annoy-
ing to the U.S.S.R, all in order to pro-
mote the sale of Pepsi-Cola. 
The Basis of Stability - - - 
If the U.S. sets itself the objective 
of establishing truly friendly relations 
with the U.S.S.R and wants to be as-
sured of their durability, then it must, 
? strive for the transformation of the 
closed Soviet system to an open one.' 
The awakening of the Soviet people-. 
, to human rights is a force working in 
this direction. ? 
Inasmuch as the movement? for 
'human rights has no troops, the poli-
tician-policemen and the politician-
businessmen are inclined to slight it. 
But it seems to me that it is pre-
cisely the world movement for human 
rights that will become a world-trans-
forming force that will overcome both 
Inhumanity based on violence and in-
humanity ?based on indifference. ? . 
Genuine stability comes only in a 
process of movement, only. in the ex-
pansion of influence. The U.S. must 
strive for a transformation of the 
world if it wants it to be more stable. 
A .system that does not set expan? 
sionist goals for itself contracts and 
dies away. The world has experienced 
many forms of expansion?military, 
economic and cultural. If the U.S. can 
become the center of a .new expan-
sion, a humanitarian expansion based 
on human rights throughout the 
world, its future 'would be assured 
for a long time. . 
. It is interesting that this idealistic 
element has already, to -a, lesser or 
greater degree, been felt in. American 
politics during the entire history of 
the U.S. The old-fashioned European 
political mentality?without an under-
standing of historical perspective and 
without interest in higher. goals?is 
not., likely to long dominate the 
foreign policy of the U.S. No ?matter 
how much more Mr. Kissinger wants 
to cast aside humanitarian problems 
they come to the surface by one 
means or another. This is particularly 
evident in the differences between the 
Administration and the Congress over 
the question of trade and of emigre- . 
tion from the U.S.S.R. 
These differences, although' restrict-
ing the Administration, also do give it 
certain benefits. The triangle of Mr. 
Kissinger, Mr. Brezhnev and Henry 
M. Jackson reminds me somewhat of 
the situation when a criminal is being 
induced to confess by two interroga-
tors, one of whom?Senator Jackson 
? ?shouts and beats his fist on the 
table, and the other?Secretary of 
State Kissinger?who smiles and 
gently promises leniency. So the heart 
of the criminal, faced with such con-
trasts, opens up to the kind smile. 
The U.S. Govermitent evidently is 
feeling the pressure of business cir-
cles. headed by makers of soft drinks, 
interested in cooperation with the 
U.S.S.R. because they consider it a 
gigantic potential market for their' 
products and a source of raw, 
materials and cheap labor. One can 
.only welcome economic cooperation 
if it is one of the elements of the 
policy of d?nte, but not a 'force 
shaping this policy. ? ? 
Without doubt, businessmen have 
made an enormous contribution to the ? 
creation of modern America, but 
when they became the, leading poli-
tical force they led the U.S. to the, 
brink of disaster?to the Great De-
pression of the 1930's. 
Americans are a people easily car-
ried away. When they were carried 
away by the cold war, I don't know, 
whether there were sober voices pro-
posing some kind of alternative. Now 
the Americans are carried away by 
"cleterfte," and it is good that warn-
ing voices are being heard. The warn-, 
ing is that detente requires restraint 
and determination?not merely a will-
ingness to compromise?and that 
meek concessions will only lead to 
demands for more concessions. Per-
haps the voices will be heeded. " ? 
? The alternative to d?nte, which its 
supporters have, demanded to hear 
from its critics, is detente carried out 
differently, d?nte in which long-
range goals are not sacrificed to short-
term goals; and- one must learn to 
wait for what is desired. 
Foreign policy does not exist by it-
'self'. It is an integral part of a coun-
try's internal condition, which in turn 
. depends. upon external conditions. If 
,one accepts the premise that without 
rpprochement with the U.S.S.R. the 
U.S. cannot exert influence on it, then 
one must say that if this influence is 
not in a constructive direction the 
rapprochement will be even danger-
ous for the U.S. When the U.S.S.R. 
must pay for every bushel of grain 
and for every technological secret not 
so much with gold as with a step to-
-ward democratization of its society, 
-,only then -will its foreign policy cease 
to ,present a. threat to the West. 
However, this exchange, this 
"gentle pressure" should not have the 
character of wounding the self-respect 
of theJU.S.S.R. tet it proceed under 
the banner of demanding fulfillment 
from the U.S.S.R. of the international 
declarations it has signed. And every 
concession should be looked upon not 
as a "victory for the West" but rather 
30 
' as a step toward' common good. 
In the' emerging triangle of powers, 
the relationship of the U.S. toward 
, the U.S.S.R. , and China, amid some 
similarities, is very different. China ? 
has not developed yet to the level of 
true partnership with the U.S. eco-
nomically, socially or politically; and 
militarily it presents much less of a . 
danger, , to the. U.S. than does the 
U.S.S.R. Further, the mainspring of 
- revolution still has not unwound in 
China. Any attempt to put pressure 
on China for the purpose of internal 
change most probably will yield no 
results. China is still so far from the 
West that everything that happens 
there is regarded almost like &time- ? 
-thing on the moon. China is still too 
' "alien" for public opinion in the West 
to reach out a hand to those who are 
subjected to persecution. 
. Pressure From the West ? 
It is a different matter with the 
. 
'From the circumstances' of 
its tragic. Eurasian "geographic situa-
tion, _Russia has. always been both 
more sensitive to the West and more 
dangerous to the West than has China. 
The mainspring of the Russian Revolu-
tion has completely unwound. And 
moving now only by the force of 
inertia, the U.S.S.R, will be highly. 
responsive to pressure from the West, 
all the more so because of a hostile.. 
? China at its back. And it is fully clear 
that the more the relations of the: 
U.S.S.R.. with the West expand, the 
more it becomes "familiar" to the 
West, the more public opinion in the 
West will keep an alert watch on 
events in the U.S.S.R. 
If , the rivalry, of the U.S.S.R. and, 
China becomes ever sharper, and I 
, believe -that. it will. then the ties of ' 
the U.S. to the U.S.S.R. and China 
"will become like two sets of reins in 
the hands of ?the American leaders, 
, which they can use to ,guide the 
' course of world history. 
But the question is, will they? 
Let us assume that a state or a 
group of states, working out long-
range policies, should define the goals, 
strategy and tactics. As viewed from 
here in Russia, one might say that 
the political strategy of the U.S. is 
correct, but that its tactics in effect 
Pare ? undermining that strategy. But' 
what is more important, the policies - 
of the U.S.?and even more so of the 
We.st in general?reveal very dim ob-
. 
jectives or even the absence of ob-
jeatives; the preservation of the status 
quo and, economic growth are not 
really objectives. 
Perhaps the dissent and lack of

Apparently, Mr. Schlesinger feels that im-

silos overrides the substantially increased 
chance that millions of Americans will be 
incinerated in an accidental nuclear strike. 
Actually, the Secretary was providing telling

cannot risk the acquisition of a more effec-

Soviet Union-toward a "launch on warning"

trigger alert is even more risky fcr us than for 
them. 
To make matters worse, Mr. Schlesinger 
has threatened to launch strategic nuclear 
weapons in a "selective" strike at military 
targets in the Soviet Union in response to 
aggression with conventional weapons in 
Europe. If the Russians follow Schlesinger's 
advice and "launch on warning," the selective 
strike will hit only empty silos while Soviet 
warheads may be killing millions of Amer-

that it country could launch a 
massive surprise attack 
?against another country and.; 
use the .pretext of a big, 
military exercise to disguise 
the - massing of troops in 
border areas. 
Thus, the agreement, in 
rather vague language, 
requires that countries give 
notice three weeks in advance 
of military maneuvers in 
Europe involving more than 
25.000 troops. 
However, a key provision is . 
that "in the case of a par-
ticipating state whose 
territory extends beyond 
Europe, prior notification 
need be given only of 
maneuvers which take place 
in an area within 250 
kilometers (153 miles) from 
its frontier facing or shared 
with any other European 
participating state." 
.Since the Soviet Union's

Personal Diplomacy 
BY James Reston 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23?Personal 
diplomacy is very fashionable these 
days. We have pictures of Henry Kis-
singer shaking hands with Chairman 
Mao Tse-tung in Peking, of the Em-
peror of Japan and President Ford on 
the White House lawn, and next week 
, it will be President Sadat of Egypt 
and his "dear friend" Henry dominat-
ing the social and diplomatic news. 
Sometimes these personal contacts 
are vital to the relations between na-
tions, and they have always fascinated 
Mr. Kissinger, who spent years at Har-
vard studying and writing about the 
perscinal diplomacy of nineteenth-cen-
tury Europe. But his own years in 
Washington illustrate the fragility of 
human life and power. 
He established a remarkable degree 
of respect with Chou En-lai, which 
helped to end the long break in Sine-
American relations, but when he got 
to Peking this time, Chou En-lai was 
too ill to see him and it is doubtful 
that they will ever meet again. 
Likewise, it was thought here that 
negotiations with Spain for the use 
of military and naval facilities in that 
country ought to keep in mind the 
pride, and prejudices, of Generalissimo 
Francisco Franco; but before negotia-
tions could be completed, Franco was 
stricken and the judgment here is that, 
his long domination of Spain is over. 
Mr. Kissinger counted on the philo-
sophic and economic influence of King 
Faisal of Saudi Arabia to help mod-
erate the demands of the Middle East-
ern oil states, but Faisal was murdered 
in March of this year. The Secretary 
had hoped to get help in the Cyprus 
crisis from Bulent Ecevit, who had 
once been a Kissinger student at 
Harvard. but Mr. Ecevit was thrown 
out of office on Nov. 17, 1974. 
This is not to say that personal 
diplomacy does not have its uses or 
that Mr. Kissinger's own personality,

whenever the defense budget 
reaches the Appropriations 
Committee action stage. 
"During a debate over a U.S.. 
ABM we begin hearing about a 
Soviet MIRV or a Chinese 
ICBM," the senator observed. 
Proxmire asked Graham 
whether he agreed that the 
United States "leads the 
Russians in almost every high 
technology base in terms of 
bombers, submarines, 
computers, missiles and other 
categories." 
Graham answered: "I think ? 
that in almost all military 
technologies we lead them.' 
He added, without 
elaboration, "I am worried 
about several that are rather 
important, such as (deleted) 
the application of lasers." - 
Proxmire concluded that it 
would improve public un-
derstanding of defense 
spending controversies if 
? reports on Soviet military 
outlays were made at regular 
intervals by the "civilian 
side" of the intelligence 
community. 
"It would also help avoid 
confusion if Pentagon officials 
would refrain from using the 
estimates of the intelligence 
agencies prematurely, 
selectively, or out of context," 
he said. 
character and wide-ranging mind have 
not made great contributions to some 
of the more positive events of recent 
world history. It is doubtful, for ex-
ample, that Egypt would have taken 
even its limited step toward an ac-
commodation with Israel unless Mr. 
Kissinger had won the confidence of 
Mr. Sadat. 
In contrast, Mr. Kissinger also felt 
that he had established mutual trust 
with Le Duc Tho, the principal Hanoi 
negotiator at the Vietnamese peace 
talks, but the agreements arranged be-
tween them fell apart when they no 
longer supported the interests of the 
parties concerned. 
Aside from the accidents of politics, 
the accidents and mortality of life 
make personal diplomacy a risky busi-
ness. Since Mr. Kissinger came to 
Washington as the principal security 
adviser in the White House in January 
of 1969, President Nixon and Vice 
President Agnew have been forced out 
of office,, and his principal ally- in

Mao Tse-tung is 81, Chou En-Iai is 
, 77, both in poor health, as is Leonid 
Brezhnev, the Communist party chief 
in Moscow. Also, President Ford's 
term of office is assured only until 
the end of next year, and Mr. Kis-
singer will be leaving then, in any 
event, so that enduring agreements 
between nations must rest on national 
interests and not on personalities?a

in principle but defy in practice. 
Harold Nicolson, still perhaps the 
best student of diplomacy of this can-
means that if SALT 
negotiations are inconclusive 
in the, next four months, they 
would go over to 1977. 
With this limitation on 
negotiations, administration 
sources concede, the 
prospects diminish for any 
SALT accord in 1976 without 
major Soviet or American 
concessions soon. 
As a political reality; the' 
pressures will grow inside the 
administration even during 
this period to resist com-
promises that could expose 
President Ford to new attacks 
from the Republican right on 
his detente policy,- U.S. 
planners anticipate. 
Defense Department par-
tisans initiated 'a flurry of 
attacks across the Potomac 
two weeks ago against 
Kissinger's SALT diplomacy, 
although Defense Secretary 
James R. Schlesinger last 
week strongly disavowed any 
attempt to frustrate 
Kissinger's strategy.' 
Schlesinger personally 
shares some of Kissinger's 
concern about the need to 
"bind Brezhnev's successors" 
to agreed nuclear-force, 
ceilings. But Kissinger and 
Schlesinger* long have 
disagreed about the terms the 
United States should settle for 
in the projected 10-year SALT 
agreement. 
A failure to reach a SALT 
agreement in 1976, many 
Defense ? Department 
strategists and other 
specialists contend, still would 
leave in force the five-year 
limit on American and Soviet 
strategic weapons that runs to 
October, 1977. 
This would allow adequate 
time, these sources say, for 
resuming SALT negotiations 
after the presidential 
inauguration in January, 1977. 
Kissinger's associates label 
this an invitation for "panic 
negotiations," in contrast to 
chbeiRetteaset00114/08108 
critics charge Kissinger with 
tury, went even further and argued 
, in "Peacemaking" that even when 
the great men are well and secure in 
office, the habit of personal diplomacy 
' is dubious and maybe even dangerous. 
"Diplomacy," he said, "is the art of 
negotiating documents in a ratifiable 
and therefore dependable form. It is 
by no means the art of conversation. 
. . . Nothing could be more fatal than 
the habit of personal contact between 
statesmen of the world. It is argued 
in defense of this pastime that the 
foreign secretaries of nations `get to 
? know each other.' 
"This is an extremely dangerous 
cognizance. Personal contact breeds, 
inevitably, personal acquaintance and 
,that, in its turn, leads in many cases 
to friendliness. There is nothing more 
damaging to precision in international 
relations than friendliness between 
contracting parties. . . . Diplomacy, if 
. it is ever to be effective, should be a 
disagreeable business. And one 
. recorded in hard print." 
conducting. Beyond that 
hazard, such a delay runs the 
risk of a "totally uncontrolled 
nuclear arms race," 
Kissinger associates caution.. 
By 1977, these sources say 
there is almost certain to be a 
new leader in the Kremlin, 
even if President Ford 
remains in the White House. A 
change in either leadership, it 
is argued, could provide 
justification for cancelling the 
Ford-Brezhnev agreement 
made at Vladivostok last 
November, which is the basis 
for the present SALT 
negotiations. 
Kissinger, therefore, is 
described as being deter-
mined to continue his drive for 
a SALT accord until the last 
possible moment, in the hope 
of inducing the Soviet Union to 
reach even a partial nuclear 
compromise. 
Time will run out, U.S. 
specialists now estimate, 
before the convening 'of the 
Soviet Communist Party's 
25th congress, scheduled to 
open in Moscow Feb. 24. 
This is where Brezhnev 
planned on displaying a 
completed SALT agreement, 
capped at a Washington 
summit conference, as the 
climax of his detente 
strategy?and, it was 
speculated, perhaps his 
political career. 
The ailing Brezhnev, 
however, now may lack the 
power to produce any new 
concessions on SALT. In 
addition, the administration's 
political timetable for cutting 
off SALT negotiations may be 
construed as a deliberate 
pressure tactic, although U.S. 
officials have tried to 
eliminate that suspicion.

One is the latest Soviet

the Backfire B; the ether is 
the. American-initiated long-
range cruise missile, yet to be 
test-fired, but already 
regarded as a major. 
technological breakthrough to 
a new class of weapon!. 
Of the two, weapons 
American cruise missile is, 
overwhelmingly the most 
significant. 
The Defense Department is' 
pressing the Soviet Union to 
count Backfire bombers in its 
force level of 2,400 strategic , 
land, sea or air missiles or 
long-range bombers. The 
Soviet Union insists the plane 
is not an intercontinental 
bomber, but a medium-range 
bomber. 
The Soviet Union, in turn, 
demands that the United 
States count long-range cruise 
missiles in its total of 2.400' 
strategic weapons. The United 
States refuses on grounds that 
the cruise missile is the 
equivalent of a low-flying 
pilotless plane, not a ballistic 
missile. 
In the latest American 
counterproposal, submitted 
Sept. 21, which is now the 
critical offer in the 
negotiations, the United States 
proposed a trade-off formula 
for counting the Backfire and 
cruise missile in equal 
numbers. above the force 
levels set at Vladivostok. 
There is little, if any, ex-

this offer will be accepted as it

-open in Paris on Monday, is a 
icharacteristic tour de force of that 
great illusionist President Giscard 
d'Estaing. . 
His ambitious .project started in 
fact last April but promptly col-
lapsed following the demand of 
the Third World's representatives 
to include the question of raw 
anaterials on the agenda?a thinly i 
veiled way of claiming that any- I 
thing OPEC could do with oil, 
they could do better with their 
own !commodities. For once, the 
advanced industrial Powers de-
cided to draw the line there and 
Oen but, having made their 
gesture, they are now back at the 
bargaining table after receiving a 
prolonged kiss of life from the 
' Elysee. This is no mean tribute 
even to a man with the President's 
, 
celebrated talents. - 
Since April, the plight of the 
poorer developing countries has 
grown more desperate, the budgets 
of the " older " consuming coun-
tries have become even more un-
balanced and OPEC has resent-
fully settled for a " mere " 10 per 
cent.- increase in oil prices. 
? Against this sombre background, 
the basic aim of the oil-consuming 
countries is to eliminate or limit 
attempts to wreck their economies 
by the ruthless manipulation of 
fuel supplies and to ensure that 
normal market mechanisms func-
tion ? free from cartel . pressures. 
These objectives are common to 
both the developed and undeve-
loped consumer nations, but can 
- they be attained by rational argu-
ment, diplomatic skill or appeals 
to the 0 P E C's , enlightened self-
interest? There are many reasons 
for doubt. - 
- Firstly, the oil-consuming coun-
tries do not pursue a common 
policy. The Ford Administration 
is divided. An influential section 
, of its economic establishment 
? favours high prices which benefit 
America's own oil producers and 
stimulate the massive investments 
in alternative sources of energy. 
Not so long ago, at the time when 
Dr Kissinger uttered pious hopes 
; that oil prices would come down 
, a little, the Assistant Secretary in 
charge of energy problems, 
Thomas Enders, argued publicly in 
favour of a high floor price for oil. 
This conflict is not merely one of 
emphasis?it is similar to the 
,current divergences between the 
Secretary of State and the Pen-, 
tagon on supplying Israel with 
Pershing missiles and undermines

America's credibility and standing 
in international negotiations. 
When we turn to Britain's posi-
tion, we note that her will to resist 
the crippling effects of high oil 
prices has been paralysed by -three 
trends.' 
There is in the air a general 
feeling that financial expediency is 
all that matters. OPEC in gen-
eral and its Arab members in 
particular must not be upset if we 
want to have their business and 
keep their sterling balances. 
' Beyond this' crude 'and short-
sighted opportunism, there- are 
other forces at work. The rot has 
spread into the Conservative party, 
whose experts on energy can now 
only think of how best to recycle 
the excess oil profits of OPEC 
without even considering ways and 
means of reducing them. Given 
this sort of defeatism, who can 
blame the coal miners doing their 
own "recycling "? After all, they, 
too, could argue that any increases 
in wages paid to them are put 
back into our economy. 
Even the ,Economist (Sept. 20) 
discerned something humiliating 
but " healthy" in seeing "the West 
so busy today appealing to OPEC, 
please not to put prices up too 
much" and shows sympathy for 
OPEC's use of oil power for dent-
ing "the arrogance of the West." 
With such friendly support, who 
needs enemies? 
Of course, there -remains the 
question of our vested interest in 
high oil prices for the sake of our 
North Sea bonanza. The most 
obvious criticism of this point of 
view is that this country's invest-
ment in the new oil fields should 
net have to depend on artificially. 
high OPEC prices that, for a 
variety of reasons, could be 
brought down as arbitrarily as 
they were put up.. 
Pulling out 
As to whether all our efforts 
-to placate OPEC are useful, the 
answer is not reassuring. In 1974 
OPEC invested ?3,700 million in 
Britain. In the first six months 
of 1975, . these investments 
dropped to ?370 million. Having

balance, OPEC is now letting us 
down because our economy no 
longer inspires confidence ! 
Is France faring differently? 
After all, with her well-established 
tradition of renversement des alli-
ances, she has been leading 
- -Europe in cultivating 0.P E C's 
benevolence to the extent of turn-
ing some of her leading statesmen 
into commercial travellers. On the 
face of it, charm and servility 
have paid. In the first six months , 
of this year French exports to the 
Middle East have increased by 76 
per cent. But, for all this, France 
still pays for her oil as much as 
anybody else and her export re-
cords are a shade less gratifying 
when it is remembered that ,to a 
large extent they are paid for by- , 
her own money. To put-it differ-
ently,- the amount of oil that 
France could purchase in 1973 by 
exporting one tank to Libya could 
be bought a year later only by 
exporting five tanks. The price 
of French tanks and other exports 
Were- duly marked 11D, but not by

gap still hurts: thus in her current 
Budget there are provisions for a

Germany is clamping down on 
Common Market agricultural sub-
sidies. 
Even when France's hell-bent 
export drive achieved records, its 
very success created new prob-
lems, as in the case of Algeria 
where?after a French trading 
surplus of $650 million in the first 
six months of this year?a budding 
"special relationship" turned into 
acrimonious controversy culminat-
ing with the Algerian regime buy-
ing space in the French Press to 
berate the economic policy of 
Paris. 
The weaknesses underlying all 
these strains and stresses among 
and inside the leading industrial 
countries do not escape ? 0 P E C's 
leaders, and inevitably they con-
clude that the consumer's goose 
can be made to lay many more 
golden eggs before the game is 
over. 
The case of Patricia Hearst has 
prompted some general discussion 
on whether a kidnapping victim

can really make common cause 
with his tormentors. If one con-
templates great Powers doing pre-
cisely that, why wonder when a 
helpless individual succumbs 
under pressure? 
The true meaning of 0 P E C's 
frenzied overdevelopment is still 
only dimly perceived. It is a pro-
cess generating its own uncontrol-
lable momentum to such an extent 
that, against its better judgment, 
OPEC may be forced to press 
on and on for higher prices, even 
if this means growing inter-depen-
dence with the West, stimulating 
the West's reserve stocks and its 
drive for alternative sources of 
- energy, crushing the poorer 
nations and going against the 
weight of market forma. 
It is this last factor that worries 
the oil producers. To counter it, 
they encourage the notion of inter-
national economic egalitarianism 
which offers the richer countries 
of the world an opportunity to 
expiate the sins of past im-
perialism and present affluence. 
The modus operandi of this new 
ideology is the transfer of wealth 
to the underprivileged countries of 
the Third World by paying the 
earth for their produce and raw 
materials.

concept is an adaptation of the old

? With Fertilizer Shortage Past, 
Poor Countries Are S till Hungry 
BY ANN C 
The worldwide fertilizer 
shortage of last year is now 
past. But left in the wake is a 
dectine in fertilizer usage?and 
therefoT in potential.food pro-
duction?in the world's poorest 
countries. Furthermore, fertil-
izer manufacturers, who in-
creased prices during the short-. 
age far above production costs, 
are expecting huge profits. 
. These price increases ? as 
much as 1,000 per cent be-

fertilizer aid, the United States, 
reduced its aid from 631,000 
tons in 1973-74 to 487,000 tons 
in 1974-75, and had to spend 
more than' twice as much for 
the lower amount.

U.S. Arms-Sale Rise 
Stirs Capital Concern 
.Greater Control Is Sought by Congress 
As Nation Takes Lead in Munitions Sal 
By. RICHARD D. LYONS 
? . Special to The New York Time' 
VVASHINGTON, Oct: 18?The' two areas, which account for 
emergence of the United States more than half of American 
as munitions king of the world arms sales overseas, there have 
'and almost daily reports of 
new arms deals with foreign 
Governments are generating a 
fresh sense of uneasiness among 
policy makers and Congress-
men over the impact of the 
weapons on global affairs. 
Sales of American-made 
weapons have risen from about 
$2-billion a year in 1967 to 
about $11-billion in the last 
fiscal year, abetted by Federal 
policies of liberal credit, a be-
nign attitude toward the ship-
ping of arms overseas, the pre-
eminent state of American 
military technology, the rapid 
obsolescence of weapons and 
an almost limitless world-wide 
demand for more guns. 
Congress has become in-
creasingly embroiled in the 
specifics of such arms deals 
as tanks for Turkey, missiles 
for Jordan, rockets for Israel 
and jet fighters for Egypt; at 
the same time Congress is con-
sidering the general idea that 
the Senate and the House of 
Representatives should have 
greater control over interna-
tional shipments. of munitions 
made in this country. 
During the last decade there 
has been a complete reversal 
of United States arms policy 
from one of giving the weapons 
away to one of selling them, 
either for spot cash or on lib-
eral credit supplied by the Fed-
eral Government. 
The demand for American 
Weapons has been spurred by 
arms races in the Middle East 
and the Persian Gulf because 
of the quadrupling of the price 
of oil and the desire of the 
petroleum producing nations 
to defend their enormouslyi 
amplified wealth with steel. 
_In recent months, in these 
been reports of Pershing mis-' 
siles to Israel, radars to Egypt, 
fighters to Saudi Arabia, Hawk 
missiles to Jordan, destroyers 
to Iran, antitank missiles to 
Oman, bombers to Kuwait and 
tanks to Yemen. 
While orders for American-
made arms appeared to have 
peaked last year, the probable 
effect of Congressional ap-
proval of the Sinai accords, 
which would provide arms to 
both Egypt and Israel, would 
be to push still higher the sales 
of American arms, spare parts 
and training services. 
Increasingly vocal critics of 
American arms policy, which 
some complain is a lack of 
policy, note that this country 
seems only too willing to sell 
to all sides.

Should the United States seek 
a treaty with the Soviet Union 
limiting the supply of conven-

tions increase munitions sales 
if the United States chose to 
curtail shipments? What would 
be the impact on the American. 
economy if the United States 
drastically reduced foreign 
arms sales? _...

"Merchant of Death" . 
In discussing such issues be-
fore a Congressional commit-
tee, Thomas Stern, deputy di-
rector of the State Depart-
ment's Bureau of Politico--Mili-
tary Affairs, said: "These are 
valid questions for Americans, 
who are troubled at seeing 
their country in the arms sup-
ply business. The image of, 
'Merchant of Death' dies hard.") 
Arms experts here are also. 
expressing doubt that it would 
even be politically possible to 
curtail the production of 
weapons for sales overseas be-
cause of the increasing strength: 
of the loosely allied arms lobbyt 
in the United States. 
"The economy now is sad-
dled with a self-perpetuating 
munitions industry that is bad 
for long-term economic policy," 
said one knowledgeable Senate 
staff aide. 
In addition to the increase in 
sheer volume of arms being 
produced for other countries, 
the United States in recent 
years has radically changed its 
policy on the method of trans-
fer. Until a decade ago most 
of the arms were given away.' 
Now they are sold for cash, 
generating fat profits. " 
Financing Methods 
Most arms transfers are' fi-1

Senator Percy said that the

from the agency "confirms the 
virtual severing of the 'French

of confiscated' heroin that was 
analyzed between January. and 
June came from Europe or the 
Middle East, compared with

The film "French Connection"

the movement of heroin from

"In many ways the current 
situation is more difficult to 
control than in the days of 
the now-dormant 'French Con-
nection,'" Senator Percy wrote 
in letters to Secretary of State 
Kissinger and Attorney General 
Edward H. Levi. The Senator 
urged them to take immediate 
diplomatic action "to dam u 
this international stream pollut-

brown heroin." 
Among the 13 cities in which 
illegal heroin was analyzed by 
narcotics agents, nine had a 
greater percentage that came 
from Mexico in the first six 
months of this year. three had 
slightly less and in Chicago 
all the heroin during both pe-

In Boston, 100 per cent of

83 per cent of the samples 
were Mexican-processed and 10

The British Government in 
1973 paid Mauritius $1.4-mil-

report acknowledged that thus

funds had not been spent by 
the Mauritius Government.

two Senators said the report 
made clear that Defense De-

earlier this year that Diego 
Garcia was an unpopulated is-

Sunday, October 26, 197S THE V/ASPILNGTON POST 
nc Exec S fry Says 
nit lotted Murders 
By Bernard Kaplan 
seed& to The Washington Post 
PARIS, Oct. ?During the 
1960s the French government 
eperated a high-level 
"assassination" committee 
whose task was to pinpoint 
enemies of the regime for 
termination, according_ to a 
newly published book by a 
former senior French secret 
agent.. 
In ? his book "The Com-
mittee," ex-agent Philippe 
Thiraud De Vosjoii also 
claims that the De Gaulle 
government systematically 
opened foreign embassies' 
diplomatic mail, including 
that of the United States. On 
one occasion during an in-
ternational conference in 
Cannes in 1961, according to 
De Vosjoli, a French agent 
entered the hotel room of U.S. 
Under Secretary of State 
George Ball in the middle of 
the night and rifled it for 
secret documents. 
Although De Vosjoli's book 
contains many alleged 
revelations about the inner 
workings of France's in-
telligence U services, it is 
principally a defense of a 
former colleague, Marcel 
Leroy-Finville, who was 
cashiered and imprisoned for 
his supposed involvement in 
the kidnap-slaying here of a 
leftist Moroccan politician, 
-Mehdi Ben Barka, in 1965. The 
Ben Barka affair erupted into 
.a major scandal of the De 
Gaulle regime and led to a 
diplomatic crisis between 
France and Morocco. ' 
THE ECONOMIST OCTOBER 11, 1975 
De Vosjoli insists that 
Leroy-Finville. considered 
one of the top agents of the 
French intelligence agency' 
was actually framed by his 
own government. ? The real 
reason for his official 
disgrace, he says, was his 
refusal to obey or-
ders?emanating from the 
"Committee" ?to kill a 
number of French Algerian 
-dissidents living in exile in 
Portugal and Spain just after 
the Algerian war. 
Leroy-Finville, now in 
retirement in southern 
France, backed up De 
Vosjoli's allegations in a 
telephone conversation. 
"Nothing has escaped him," 
Leroy-Finville said. "He 
followed my personal tragedy 
closely." 
According to the book, the 
committee consisted of senior 
intelligence officials and civil 
servants and was sometimes 
presided over by the then-
prime minister, Georges 
Pompidou. De Vosjoli im-
plicates Pompidou, later 
president of France, in the 
Leroy-Finville case, claiming 
that the orders to kill the 
French Algerian exiles came 
from a senior official in the 
prime minister's office. ? 
The Committee kept no 
notes or records, De Vosjoli 
says. It had a "permanent" 
list of assassination "os 
jectives," among them 
Presidents Sekou Toure of 
Guinea and Habib Bourguiba 
of Tunisia, both at the time 
considered antagonists of 
Charles De Gaulle. 
Spanish guide rouge 
FROM OUR SPAIN CORRESPONDENT 
Reading his censored newspaper and 
watching his government-operated box 
the average Spaniard is left with the 
impression that Spain's terrorist foes are a 
hydra-headed lot. In reality only two 
-serious terrorist groups?Eta and Fran?
are now active in Spain. and more than 
half of their active militants are either in 
prison or on the safe side of the French or 
Portuguese frontier. 
Eta is the Basque separatist organisa-
tion which assassinated Admiral Carrero 
Blanco, General Franco's first prime 
minister, a little under two years ago. Its 
name is an acronym standing for Basque 
Country and Freedom. It began life in 
1959 as a mainly C ataqiipmeemp:14 Olt 
If *De Vosjoli Is to be 
believed, one successful 
target of the committee was 
the Italian state oil tycoon 
Enrico Mattei. French agents 
were responsible for 
sabotaging Mattel's airplane 
in 1963 because, according to 
him, France believed he was 
seeking to oust French oil 
interests in Algeria. 
The book offers an ex-
,planation of why Leroy-
Finville was abruptly released 
from prison after four months 
and never tried. According to 
De Vosjoli's account, a group 
of the accused man's former 
associates, including himself, 
sent a warning to De Gaulle 
and .PomPidou that unless 
he was freed, they would 
reveal the existence of the 
special committee. He was 
released less than a, week 
later. 
Ironically, in view of the 
recent allegations of CIA 
involvement in foreign 
assassination plots, De Vosjoli 
in the mid-1950s was the 
French intelligence service's 
liaison man with the 
American agency. He was 
fired by De Gaulle for 
becoming too closely iden-
tified with the CIA. Some time 
afterward, he asserted that 
the French leader's entourage 
had been infiltrated by a 
Soviet agent?an allegation 
that served as the basis for the 
plot of the bestselling novel 
"Topaz" by Leon Uris. While 
De Gaulle was in power, the 
novel was banned in France. 
In the more relaxed at-
mosphere under President 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a 
rejected the moderation of the traditional 
"bourgeois" Basque nationalist move-
ment. In the 1960s Eta drifted to the left, 
though since its fifth assembly in 
December, 1968, its doctrinaire marxists 
have flaked away, in successive schisms, 
to join ? non-activist trotskyite groups 
such as the Revolutionary Communist 
League. Today its most able leaders are 
dead or in prison, and fewer than 100 
experienced militants are still at liberty. 
The - Revolutionary Anti-Fascist 
Patriotic Front, or Frap, was founded in 
the spring of 1973. It is a mainly maoist 
group, though it is aot thought to be 
backed by the Chinese embassy in Madrid, 
whose officials have been at pains to

French edition of "The 
Committee" is expected to he 
published here shortly. 
Meanwhile, a French-
language version has ap-
peared in Montreal. 
De Vosjoli says that the 
diplomatic pouches of vir-
tually all foreign embassies in 
Paris were regularly opened 
by French agents in the 
Gaullist era. Agents operated 
from a specially equipped van 
at Orly Airport, where the 
incoming and outgoing 
diplomatic mail was in-
tercepted. They even had the 
chemistry equipment to 
reconstitute the fibers of 
paper that might be inad-
vertently torn in the process. 
American diplomatic mail 
could not be intercepted in this 
way because it was invariably 
carried by State Department 
couriers. But, says De Vosjoli, 
French intelligence 
discovered that copies of most 
U.S. documents usually were 
sent to the American em-
bassies in neighboring 
countries under less stringent 
security. So, according to De 
Vosjoli, Leroy-Finville set up 
an organization in Morocco to 
open U.S. dipliomatic mail 
there. 
The burglarizing of Ball's 
hotel room was ordered after 
a bugging device failed to pick 
up enough information, ac-
cording to De Vosjoli. That 
'operation was, also conducted 
under Leroy-Finville. He 
stood poised as at the hotel's 
fuse box,. ready to plunge it 
into darkness in case the agent 
was discovered. He was not, 
De Vosjoli says, but was able 
to photograph the contents of

authorities. Frap may, like Eta, have 
received a little Cuban advice and 
assistance. It operates mainly in Madrid. 
Its honorary president was the former 
Republican foreign minister, Sr Alvarez 
del Vayo, who died in Geneva last May 
aged 84. Most of its militants, like Eta's, 
are students and semi-skilled workers. In 
July a secret meeting of representatives of 
Eta, two anarchist groups and some IRA 
Provisional visitors criticised Frap's "half-
hearted attitude to direct action". This 
may have goaded it into the operations 
that have recently enabled the police to 
capture some of its leading militants. 
Frap has safe houses in Portugal that 
correspond to Eta's bases in France; but

harder than the Basque group to re-
organise and resume co-ordinated opera-
tions. But even scattered groups of 
determined terrorists can find sufficient 
targets to maintain political tension. 
Other potential activist groups exist 
but, by comparison with Eta and Frap, 
their immediate significance is slight. 
Some belong more to folklore than to 
politics. In General Franco's native 
Galicia, whose language is similar to 
Portuguese, Eta has found an occasional 
ally in Upga, the small but growing pro-
Portuguese and pro-marxist Union of the 
' Gallego People. In Catalonia, whose 
nationalism is at the moment more cul-
tural than political, Eta has some admirers 
but few imitators: the Front for the 
Liberation of Catalonia is alleged to have 
carried out a few dozen guerrilla-style 
actions, including the murder of a civil 
guard, in the early 1970s, but it now 
contents itself with issuing leaflets. 
Spanish anarchists occasionally sur-
face violently in groups such as Mil 
(Iberian Libertarian Movement), Gari 
(International Revolutionary Action 
Groups) and 011a (Organisation for the 
NW YORK TIMES 
28 Oct. 1975 
Armed Struggle). Some of them have 
links with the big Spanish libertarian 
community in and around Toulouse?
although, as anarchists dislike organisa-
tion, there is little serious co-ordination 
between them. One unpublicised attempt 
on General Franco's life, by means of 
radio-detonated explosives, was prepared 
and carefully rehearsed by an anarchist 
cell near Toulouse. Gari, said to consist 
of five "commando groups", was alleged 
last year to have tried to kidnap Don 
Juan de Borbon. the liberal father of 
General Franco's named successor, Prince 
Juan Carlos, but has not been heard of 
lately. Ten Catalans alleged to be 
members of 011a will soon go on trial 
in Barcelona: the prosecutor is asking for 
prison sentences totalling 500 years. The 
only guerrilla-minded trotskyite group 
appears to be the ineffective Revolu-
tionary Communist party. 
Most of these groups, and others, are 
well known to the police. The Spanish 
security police are the most experienced

Clandestine Group Warns of

CMI War if Fascism 
.Survives 'Franco 
4 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 
Soerial to The NfVt York Times 
.a MADRID, Oct. 25?A clan-
destine association of Spanish 
Military officers believes that 
givil war could follow the Fran-
co era "if it becomes apparent 
that the only alternative is 40 
More years of fascism." 
This view was expressed in 
:a. meeting arranged outside 
Madrid by two repesentatives 
of the underground group 
known as the Democratic Mill-
lary Union. The interview, in 
Spanish, was understood to be 
the first the group had ever 
permitted in Spain proper with 
/a representative of any foreign 
.news organization. Extreme 
precautions were observed in 
:its arrangements. 
The two representatives, 
whose identity was not dis-
'clbsed are both captains in 
active command of troops. 
rhey said that the DemoCratic 
,Military Union had 900 mem-
ber's or supporters in the armed 
ibrces and was counting on 
at ?least the sympathy of thou-
sands of others.

bet of colonels who will be 
of the captains 
Active Commands Involved 
? ' Although in numbers the 
group constitutes a small mi-
nority of the armed forces, the 
?fact .that many of its members 
are understood to hold active 
commands?some of them re-
portedly sensitive?lends, it im-
portance.. 
"We are all moderates in 
our goal," one captain said. 
"Our group does not believe 
the army should initiate politi-
cal change in Spain, or in any, 
way influence the future demo-
cratic political life of the coun-
try. Furthermore, we believe 
in peaceful change and seek 
;no confrontations with anyone. 
? "But if, after Franco is gone, 
some new fascist seizes power, 
someone like Angel Campana, 
whom Franco appointed as 
? 
commander of the civil guard 
a few weeks ago, then it would 
be different. . 
"In that case, armed confron-
tation between various army 
factions would be likely, if it 
becomes apparent that the only 
alternative is 40 more years 
of fascism." 
He said that most of Spain's 
generals would probably op-
pose liberal change, adding that 
"they all owe their careers?in 
corruptsome cases very  
careers?to the . present sys-
tem." 
, But younger officers are rap-
idly spreading the doctrine 
of change in their contacts with; 
fellow officers, he added. 
Both of the officers spokei 
contemptuously of Generalissi-
mo Francisco Franco and as-
serted that "our People will

Elections a Goal 
The two captains interviewed 
said they were acting as 
spokesmen for the Democratic 
Military Union with the knowl-
edge of the group's leaders. 
They said the constitutional 
succession of Juan Carlos as 
Chief of State would be suc-
cessful only if he quickly 
brought democracy to the coun-
try with the assistance of quali-
fied civilian political figures. 
The dissident group calls for 
the convocation of a constit-
uent assembly to write a new 
national constitution, which 
would guarantee a referendumF 
to determine the future form' 
of government and subsequent 
free elections. 
The group's manifesto has' 
also demanded immediate re-
lease of all political prisoners, 
"redistribution of wealth," the 
right of workers to organize' 
and strike, and other social 
changes. 
"We are in contact with 
every political party in Spain," 
one of the officers said, "in-
cluding the Communist party. 
But I can tell you that we 
are not Communists, and we 
neither advocate nor imagine 
possible the kind of situation 
that has developed In Portugal. 
We also insist that in the fu-1 
ture, the army be controlled 
completely by a democratically 
elected civilian government." 
He added: "Every possible 
political tendency from conserv-
ative to far left is represented 
among us, but we ail agree, 
on the basic aims." 
The two army career men, 
40 
said that in recent years young-
er men, "mainly from the new 
Spanish industrial bourgeoisie 
like ourselves, were coning out 
of the military academies, 400 
of them a year." 
"Most of us," he said. "fit 
into the age bracket of 30 
to 45 years old. Instead of 
wasting all our spare time we 
have been studying, studying 
everything, not only military 
subjects. 
"The effect was to open our 
doors to new ideas, and those 
ideas are antifascist in es-
sence." 
Arrests Last Year ? 
The first of the dissident 
officers got into trouble and 
were arrested in September last 
year, they said. Since, others 
have been arrested, and many 
reecived such "nonjudicial" pun-
ishment as pay reductions. 
One of the dissidents sharply 
criticized the United States for 
its friendly relations with the 
Franco regime. 
He said the officers realized 
that Washington had a vested 
interest in Spain because of 
its need for military bases. 
"But there were thousands 
of ways Washington could have 
brought pressure on Franco to 
liberalize the government, with-
out actually breaking with 
him," he said. "Washington 
never seemed willing to capital-
ize on the fact that Franco 
needed American aid and 
friendship at least is much as 
Washington needed those 
bases." 
"We hOpe America will 
change its policy in the critical 
time ahead, and choose the? 
right side in Spain while there 
is still a choice open to Wash-
ington."

Egypt's Top Editor Attacks Sinai Pact 
And Says a War Is 'Highly Probable' 
By BERNARD GWERTZMAN ' 
Special to pie New yorii: Times 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23?
Egypt's best-known journalist 
has come to Washington to 
make clear his view that 
? President Anwar el-Sadat's 
agrement with Israel were "a 
tragic mistake" and that a 
new Middle East war was ? 
highly probably. 
Mohammed Hassanein Hey-
kal, sitting in his room at 
the Madison Hotel this morn.-
mg, was his usual provoca-
tive, garrulous self, seemingly 
unconcerned about the effect 
his jabs at Mr. Sadat's policies 
might have only three days 
before the Egyptian President 
arrives for a 10-day visit. ? 
Once regarded as , the 
spokesman for the Egyptian 
Government, Mr. Haykal in 
the last two years has be-
come a sharp critic of Mr. 
Sadat's policies, although he 
.has been permitted to travel 
widely and publish his views 
outside Egypt. Mr. Haykal 
. has been in this country for 
10 days. He said his visit was 
not connected with Mr. 
Sadat's trip. ? 
Discusing the Sinai agree-
ments, Mr. Heykal said they 
were "nothing, worse than 
nothing." He said they 
"divided the Arab world, 
which is a horrible thing" 
and made the Soviet Union' 
more mischievous. 
New Class Emerging - 
Even mere damaging to 
Mr. Sadat's image on the 
eve of his visit here was Mr. 
Heykal'S description of Egyp-
tian society today. He said: 
"You have seen how many 
new cars there are in Cairo; 
a new class is emerging." 
"Some people from the 
West and from here think 
this is a healthy sign," he 
said, gesturing with his ex-
pensive Corona. "This is not 
a middle class emerging, un-
fortunately. This is a pare-
site class emerging." 
These, he said. are "para-
sitical elements, who are liv-
ing on parasitic activities, 
black-marketeering, illegal 
trade, commissions, bribery 
sometimes, and it is creating 
a very high . pattern of con-
sumption, vulgar consump-
tion, and a very difficult 
strain economically and so-
cially." 
"Where is the ordinary 
man?" he asked. "What is he 
getting in all this he asked, 
"in the form of services, pro-
duction, wages?" The implied 
answer was very little. 
Confident of Nasser 
The 52-year-old' Mr. Heykal 
has been Egypt's best-known 
journalist for two decades. 
He was a close political con-
fidant of the late Gamal Ab-
del Nasser, who made him 
head' of Al Abram, Cairo's 
leading morning paper and 
publishing house. 
He wrote a weekly column, 
"Speaking Frankly." that was 
widely read throughout the 
Arab world and in foreign 
capitals as an authoritative 
insight into Mr. Nasser's 
thinking. Mr, Nasser also ap-
pointed him as Minister for 
National Guidance, in effect 
the official Government 
spokesman. 
After Mr. Nasser's death 
on Sept. 28, 1970, Mr. Heykal 
remained at his journalistic 
posts under Mr. Sadat. But 
his criticism of Mr. Sadat's 
interim accord with Israel .ii 
January, 1974, led to his de-
parture from Al Abram, al-
though he continued to draw 
his $500-a-month salary until 
last week when, in another 
rift with Mr. Sadat, he was 
dismissed altogether. 
Explaining the reasons for 
his break with Mr. Sadat in 
1974. Mr. Heykal said this 
morning that he thought in 
the aftermath of the October, 
1973, war, that "we had the 
historical moment for a real 
agreement." 
'A Moment in History' 
"Why?" he asked himself 
aloud. "For one simple pys-
choloaical ' reason. After 
October. T thought there is 
a moment in history when 
the psychology of all parties 
was reedy. I thought simply 
that the Arabs to a certain 
extent were cured, not corn-
pletely cured, cured from 
their inferiority complex and 
the Israelis were more or 
less cured from their super-
iority complex and the 
American element was there. 
The Agreement of the super-. 
powers was there for the 
first time and there was a 
certain sort of Arab unity. 
These elements are very 
necessary for an agreement." 
But, he said, by going for 
a limited Israeli-Egyptian 
. accord, "I think we destroyed 
most of the 'chances; instead 
e of pushing to a real settle-
ment. we left all the real is-
sues aside." 
"I expressed these views 
strongly and the President 
thought they were embar-
rassing to him," Mr. Heykal 
said. . 
As a result, he was forced 
to give up his editorship and - 
column in Al Ahram. 
Mr: Sadat, he said, "asked 
me to be his press adviser, 
. and I apologized; he asked 
'me to be his political adviser, 
. and I apologized; and lately, 
he asked me to, be deputy , 
prime minister for informa-
tion and then director of his. 
office for political affairs. 
And I said 'No.' :This is not 
my job." 
"I told the President I want 
to be a friend and help as 
much as I can but I don't 
Want to accept a governmen-
-tal post and I prefer to keep 
my freedom as a writer," 
Mr. Heykal said. 
Mr. Heykal said that Mr. 
? 
Sadat was coming here in 
part to seek a vast amount 
of arms from the United 
States, but he said he doubted 
that,the United States would 
give- the President anything 
substantial. 
When asked for, an alter-
native to the current step-
by-Step diplomatic approach ' 
on the Middle East, Mr. Hey-! 
kal had no easy solution. At 
one point he said that such 
accords were a mistake, but 
then he said the Syrians and 
Palestinians had 'to get 
"something." 
"We are moving, but sub-
stituting motion for pro-
gress," he said. 
Asked whether this didn't 
mean the prospects were 
very grim, he said he saw 
"no other probability" but 
war. Noteonly was the chance 
of war great, he said, but the 
Arab world, including Egypt, 
was liable to a social, class 
explosion similar to what he ? 
Lebanon. The conflict there, 
he said, the result of differ-
ences between Christians and 
Moslems bet but between the 
rich and the poor. 
At. the moment Mr. Haykal 
writes a column from Cairo 
thas is syndicated in Beirut, 
But most of the money that 
allows him to wear expen-
sive suits and smoke expen-
sive cigaes ecenes from royal-
ties from his books and. art-
icles published in the West. 
On the coffee table was 
his latest book, "Road to 
Ramadan," about the October 
war, being published in this 
country by Quadrangle Books. 
Mr. Heykal said he had 
been invited to adress the. 
- annual meeting of Arab grad-
uates of American universi-
ties last 'week, in Chicago 
and was just passing through 
Wahington. but while here - 
he was seeing many impor-
tant people.

U.S. Turns 
Cheek and 
? Checkbook 
To Zaire 
By COLIN LEGUM 
United States policy is once again focusing more 
sharply on Zaire, the former Belgian Congo, which 
became synonymous with chaos after its ill-prepared 
independence irt 1960. Secretary of State Kissinger 
is urging on a reluctant Congress the importance of 
voting $60-million of emergency aid to the regime 
of President Sese Seko Mobutu, who was helped to 
power by United States policy but who nevertheless 
expelled the United States Ambassador last June 
after alleging that the Central Intelligence Agency 
was behind an attempted military coup. 
General Mobutu would appear to be an unthankful 
and unpredictable ally; why is Mr. Kissinger, who 
has shown so little interest in African affairs, trying 
to persuade Congress to enlarge the United States 
role in Zaire? 
The answer is that more than 15 years after the 
United States- first began to assert a major role in 
the Congo region of Equatorial Africa, Washington's 
evaluation of its interests in' Africa has not changed 
very much. 
In the late fifties and early sixties, Washington 
decided that the precipitate withdrawal of Belgian / 
colonial rule from the Congo threatened to open the 
immensely rich heart of Africa to the Communist 
powers. The United States saw the first Prime Min-
ister of the Congo, Patrice Lumumba, as a possible 
vehicle for the Russians. Washington intervened to 
help the President, Joseph Kasavubu, and, later, the 
young army leader, Colonel Mobutu, to oust Mr. 
Lumumba. 
Recently, a former top scientist for the Central 
Intelligence Agency, -Sidney Gottlieb, told a Senate 
committee that a dose of lethal poison was shipped 
'to the Congo intended for the assassination of Mr. . 
Lumumba, who was killed by his enemies before the 
agency's agents could put their plan into effect. 
Mr. Mobutu's control over his army was finally 
established through the joint support of the Ameri-
cans, the Belgians and the Israelis. Through his 
dynamic, and authoritarian, rule he brought the 
country back from economic ruin and anarchy. The 
country's enormous wealth, which had previously ? 
been monopolized by the Belgians, was thrown open 
to other foreign investors as well. By the end of 
' 1973 United States private investment had reached 
$100-million, with a further $100-million in the pipe-
? line. Bilateral aid totaled $500-million between 1960 
and 1973, second only to Belgian official aid. 
However, as his power increased, Mr. Mobutu 
began to chafe at his reputation of being so closely tied 
to Washington. His natural xenophobic tendencies. 
assumed strong nationalistic overtones at home. In 
? his foreign relations he decided to repair his broken-
bridges with Moscow and, especialy, with .Peking. 
This realignment demanded that he should also , 
1 
1. 
i? 
V. 
adopt a more critical attitude toward United States 
policies in Africa. When Mr. Kissinger earlier this 
year replaced Donald Easum as Assistant Secretary 
of State in the Africa Bureau with the former Chilean 
Ambassador, Nathaniel Davies, President Mobutu 
took the lead in criticizing the change. 
Mr. Davies recently resigned the Africa post, 
largely because Mr. Mobutu refused to admit him 
into Zaire. ? 
These developments occurred at a time when the 
emergence to independence of Zaire's neighbor, the. 
Portuguese colony of Angola, again threatens the 
peace. Washington decision-makers see in Angola a 
close. parallel to.`the earlier situation in the Congo 
at the end of Belgian rule. 
. In Angola, too; three rival movements were vying 
for power. One of the groups, the Movement for 
Popular Liberation of Angola, led by Agostinho Neto, 
has many similarities to the Lumumba movement.. 
As was true of the Congo, Angola is a desirable and 
wealthy trading ally; and, strategically, its govern-
ment can expect to wield considerable influence 
in the area. ? 
? The interests of the United States and Mr. Mobutu 
appear once again to coincide, since the Zaire leader 
is also bitterly opposed to the Neto organization, and 
to a possible Russian-influenced neighbor. 
; Mr. ?Mobutu has backed the rival Front for the 
National Liberation of Angola and, to a lesser de-
gree, the Union for the Total National Independence 
of Angola. Zaire also hopes to get control over the 
!oil-rich enclave of Cabinda, whose fields Are worked 
plainly by United States multinationals. 
The Threat of Civil War 
However, the Neto movement has successfully en-
trenched itself in the capital of Luanda and the rival. 
movements have promised to fight back. The pros-
pects are that when independence comes on Nov. 11 
there will be a civil war. 
Zaire needs United States military aid to back up 
the national front, and the United States needs 
Zaire as a channel for its sub rosa support for the 
anti-Soviet movement. 
'?? 'However, the fall in the price' of copper' has 
plunged Mr. Mobutu's economy into deep trouble. To 
survive politically he needs Washington's help: thus 
Mr. Kissinger's request to Congress for emergency *id. 
The American identification with , Mr. Mobutu 
means the United States can expect to find itself in 
conflict with the Organization for African Unity 
and with many influential African leaders who back 
the pro-Soviet movement: 
There are at least two lessons in this history of 
U.S.-Zaire relations: 
. ? So long as Washington believes it has an interest 
in blocking what it sees as Russian-backed govern-
ments from coming to power in strategic areas like 
Aifgola or Zaire, the United States is bound to be-
come a party to escalating foreign entanglements. 
? While leaders of developing countries welcome 
the aid of the major foreign powers while such 
leaders are engaged in a struggle for power, they 
always end up deeply resentful of a too-heavy de-
pendence on their supporters once the leaders have 
power. 
A key, and unanswerable, question is whether 
the big powers serve their own best interests by 
deep involvement in such struggles. As long as any 
one of the super-powers elects to play a leading role 
in such situations, the others, under present condi-
tions, are almost certain to react.

Tribesmen 
Still Fight 
Pathet ao 
By Lewis M. Simons 
Washington Post Foreign Service 
VIENTIANE, Oct:-
19?Thousands of Laotian 
tribal guerrillas, many of 
whom fought for years as U.S. 
Central Intelligence Agency 
mercenaries, are staging an 
intensive armed struggle 
against the Communist Pathet 
Lao. 
Confirmed by a ranking: 
Pathet Lao government of-, 
ficial here, the fighting is-
going on northeast of 
Vien-
tiane in the Long Tieng Valley, 
until just six months ago the 
stronghold of Brig. Gen. Vang' 
Pao, the CIA-backed Mei), 
leader. 
The struggle, described as a 
"sizable insurrection" by 
Western military sources and 
"scattered fighting" by a 
Foreign Ministry official, is 
the only known serious 
resistance to the gentle Pathet 
Lao revolution that has swept 
the Communists into power 
since last spring. 
The guerrillas are members 
of the Meo _tribe, a fiercely 
independent people spread 
? across the mountainous 
regions of Laos, North Viet-
nam, -Thailand and southern, 
China. ` 
'Growers and heavy users of 
opium, the Meo are most 
easily 'recognized by the 
distinctive, colorfully em-
broidered black dresses and 
pendulous silver jewelry of 
their women. The name 
"Meo," applied to them by the 
'Chinese centuries ago, is 
despised by the tribesmen, 
who refer to themselves as 
Sunday, October 19, 1975 
Hmong. There are some 
200,000 Meo among Laos' 
three million people. 
Armed by the CIA, the Meo 
reportedly have salted away 
huge stocks of arms and 
ammunition. According, to one 
informed Western source, 
"They've got enough to let 
them carry on the fight at this 
rate for a least a few years." - 
There have been no claims 
by the Pathet Lao that the CIA 
is continuing to support the, 
Meo. However, Meo sources 
hint that ,they are receiving 
food and medical supplies 
from neighboring Thailand. 
These sources suggest that 
Thai air force pilots, possibly 
acting on their own without 
the knowledge of their com-
manders in Bangkok, are 
making air drops to them. 
Asked about this, a senior 
Pathet ,Lao government of-
ficial said he knew nothing of 
such supply drops. If the Meo 
claims were substantiated, 
they could seriously 
aggravate the already 
strained relations between the 
new Pathet Lao leadership 
and the government of Thai 
Prime Minister Kukrit 
Pramoj. 
Kukrit, whose multi-faceted 
coalition government is none 
too steady, is striving to im-
prove relations with his 
Communist neighbors in Laos, 
Cambodia and Vietnam. He 
admitted recently that he was 
limiting Meo refugees in 
Thailand to meager rations in 
an effort to drive them back to 
Laos. 
The Meo, -some 35,000 of 
whom have taken refuge in 
Thailand, openly express their 
hopes that Kukrit will be 
overthrown by a military 
coup. A Thai military 
-government, the tribesmen 
believe, would come to their 
assistance against the Pathet 
Lao. 
With travel by journalists 
and non-communist 
TheWashiiigton Star 
-diplomatie observers sharply 
restricted, there is little first-
hand information available on 
the extent of the Meo in-
surrection. 
According to a top Pathet 
Lao official, the fighting is 
"small-scale." The official, 
respected by Western 
diplomats as one of the most 
powerful Pathet Lao figures in 
Vientiane, said a number of 
former followers of yang Pao 
were "attempting to subvert" 
the Pathet Lao revolution by 
"stealing from villages" in 
scattered areas of the 
territory known as Military 
Region II. 
"Villagers and soldiers of 
.the Lao People's Liberation 
Army are collaborating to 
smash these small, scattered 
:groups," the official said. 
Western military -sources 
claim that the insurrection is 
far more widespread and 
serious. "Not a night goes by 
without a major firefight 
between the Meo and the 
Pathet Lao," said one source, 
who based his information on 
reports from Meo tribesmen 
who recently traveled from 
Long Tieng to Vientiane. 
This source claimed that 
some 5,000 Meo are engaged in 
the struggle. They are said to 
be armed with CIA-supplied 
M-16 rifles and M-79 grenade 
launchers as well as Chinese-
and Soviet-built AK-47 assault 
rifles captured over the years 
from Pathet Lao and North 
Vietnamese troops. 
The Meo are reportedly 
operating in small raiding 
parties, striking at Pathet Lao 
units only at night, and 
claiming heavy casualties 
among the Communist troops. 
A number of Western 
sources claim that the Pethet 
Lao are receiving armed 
support from elements of 
North Vietnamese army units 
that have remained in Laos 
since the end of the fighting in 
Indochina. 
Pathet Lao officials deny 
the specific claim of North 
Vietnamese assistance 
against the Meo as well as the 
widely held general allegation 
that some 40,000 North-
Vietnamese army regulars 
are spread throughout Laos. 
According to Western 
sources who had been in the 
Long Tieng Valley area when 
the Pathet Lao took control of 
the country away from the 
right-wing elements of the 
Laotian coalition government, 
the Pathet Lao are unable to 
guarantee security in the 
region. 
The insurrection flared up - 
soon after the Pathet Lao 
revolution took root 
throughout the country, these 
sources said: 
According to one Westerner 
who lived among the Meo for' 
several years, the trouble is 
directly traceable to yang 
Pao. This source noted that 
the Meo have been split into 
pro- and anti-Communist 
elements since the French 
Indochina war in the 1940s and 
1950s. 
Following the Vientiane 
peace agreement of 1973, 
mixed teams of Pathet Lao 
and rightist government 
census takers began a survey 
of displaced persons 
throughout Laos. In most 
parts of the country, the 
census had the side effect of 
showing villagers that Pathet 
Lao and rightists could work 
together in peace. 
"But Vang ,Pao sealed off 
the second military region 
from the census," the source 
said, "and the effect was that 
the rightist Meo continued to 
live in fear of the Pathet Lao 
and the pro-Communist Meo. 
Those who didn't follow yang 
Pao to Thailand felt they had 
no choice but to fight for their 
lives."

to believe Communist assurances 
that a truce would be arranged last 
April, rather than its own intelli-
gence reports that the North Viet-
namese intended to capture the city, 
according to official sources. 
This acceptance of what appears to 
have been a deliberate Communist 
deception was a major element in the 
embassy's failure to make adequate 
preparations for the evacuation. 
Thousands of Vietnamese who had 
been promised that they would be 
taken out, as well as dozens of Ameri-
cans, were left behind.

United States would be' 'giVen a 
chance for an orderly withdrawal 
from Vietnam during a halt in fight-
ing. 
THE MESSAGE came through the 
Hungarian and Polish delegations, to 
the International Commission of Con-
trol and Supervision (ICCS), which 
'._was created by the ineffective 1973 
Vietnam cease-fire agreement. At-
tempts to confirm it through the Sovi-
et Union yielded ambiguous answers 
that were taken by many officials as 
confirmation. 
Officials in Washington made final 
preparations for a helicopter evacua-
tion of Saigon on the basis of the 
intelligence reports. But they also 
gave some credence to the assur-
ances, if not so much as Ambassador 
Graham A. Martin in Saigon did. 
. Secretary of State Henry A. Kiss-
- inger said when the evacuation ended 
that until 24 hours before it started, 
"We thought there was some consid-
erable hope that the North 
Vietnamese would not seek a solution 
by purely military means . . .We 
thought a negotiated solution in the 
next few days was highly probable." 
But then, "The North Vietnamese 
..'obviously changed signals," Kissing-
er said. 
Intelligence reports showed, how-
ever,*that there was no change of sig-
nals. The Communists never intended 
to make any kind of deal. Those re-
ports were substantiated by 
independent means more than a week 
before the final attack on Saigon and 
have since been verified by Commu-
nist statements. 
THE PICTURE which emerges 
from a lengthy investigation of the 
last days of an American presence in 
-South Vietnam is one of confusion 
compounded by wishful thinking. 
Martin in Saigon as well as officials 
in Washington wanted to believe that 
the assurances of a dignified, arrang-
ed ending were true. 
Martin was so convinced that right 
up to the final air raid and rocket at-
- tacks on Saigon, he was operating as 
if the war was about to halt. 
. Even after the 4-am. bombard-
ment of Tan Son Nhut air base on the 
outskirts of Saigon which triggered 
the evacuation order from Washing-
ton, Martin told members of his staff 
that he could not understand what 
went wrong. 
?" But all along, reports from intelli-
gence agents of proven veracity had 
. said the Communist high command 
intended to smash Saigon militarily. 
It planned to destroy any vestige of 
the Nguyen Van Thieu regime, rather 
. than making any sort of deal with it 
or with the Americans whom the 
? Communists linked with Thieu in 
undifferentiated hatred. 
The confusion which surrounded 
the last American days was the kind 
of failure of intelligence evaluation ? 
not collection, because the 
.raw material was there ? 
which had occurred many 
.times earlier in the Vietnam 
and Cambodian wars. This 
time it had the excuse of the 
Communist deception about 
intentions.

THE ROLE of the Hun-
garians and Poles is un-
clear. It is impossible to 
learn whether they were de-
ceived themselves by the 
Vietnamese Communists 
into thinking a deal might 
be arranged, or were in-
formed parties to a plan to 
throw U. S. officials off bal-
ance by putting out a false 
story. 
Some Americans who 
were involved in the high-
level exchanges during the 
last few weeks of April be-
lieve the- two Communist 
delegations were in on the 
plan. They also believe that 
the Soviet Union was a 
Party to deceit, although 
several senior officials re-
fuse to accept this. 
? Despite the initial furor 
in this country after the Sai-
gon evacuation left many 
persons behind, there has 
been little public discussion 
of what happened. This 
suits the Ford administra-
tion. There. has been a 
strong official desire just to 
forget about the whole 
mess. . 
President Ford set the 
tone at a news conference 
May 6, a week after the 
evacuation of Saigon ended. 
He was asked if he would 
welcome "a congressional 
inquiry into how we got in 
and how we got out of Viet-
nam." 
"It would be unfortunate 
for us to rehash" what hap-
pened, Ford replied. "I 
think a congressional in-
quiry at this time would 
only be divisive and not 
helpful . . .The lessons of 
the past in Vietnam have al-
ready been learned.., and 
we should have our focus on 
the future." 
- THERE HAVE BEEN 
half-hearted congressional 
attempts to probe the last 
days. Up to now they have 
been fended off by the una-
vailability of Martin, who 
has been ill, but now he has 
recovered and is on leave 
while the administration 
tries to figure out what to 
do with him. 
Other officials who were 
in Saigon at the end have 
been dispersed to other 
jobs. The State Department 
and the Agency for Interna-
tional Development say 
they wanted to get them set-
tled in new jobs, but there is 
a strong suspicion among 
many officials that Kissing-
er wanted to separate them 
in order to prevent too 
much comparing of recol-
lections and mutterings 
about the way things were 
handled. 
The sequence of events 
which led to the American 
retreat from Saigon has no 
clear starting point. The 
1968 Tet offensive might be 
one point, since it caused 
the halt of continuing U.S. 
escalation of the war. But 
the final phase started last 
?January in Phuoc Long 
Province along the Cambo-
dian border north of Saigon. 
What the Communists 
called "the People's Libera-
tion Armed Forces" 
(PLAF), and were in fact 
North Vietnamese Army 
(NVA) units with some sup-
port from troops raised in-
side South Vietnam, launch-
ed an offensive in Phuoc 
Long about New Year's 
Day. They encountered lit-
tle resistance. 
Martin had been arguing 
that the reduction of U. S. 
military aid for South Viet-
nam had so weakened the 
southern army that it was 
unable to hold outlying 
areas. Ford asked Congress 
in January for a $300 mil-
lion supplement to the $700 
million already appropriat-
ed for military aid in the fis-
cal year ending last June 
30. 
WHATEVER THE rea-
son for the loss of Phuoc 
Long ? and some observers 
have argued that it was cor-
ruption and a lack of will, 
rather than a shortage of 
American aid, which caus-
ed the Vietnamese army to 
fight poorly ? the Commu-
nists drew important con-
clusions. 
They stepped up the flow 
of troops and supplies 
southward, adding to a 
fighting strength and logis-
tical base that had been 
built up as part of both 
sides' violations of the 1973 
Paris Agreement. Hanoi de-
cided that it would strike at 
other provinces on the bor-
der of Cambodia, where 
adjacent regions were 
being used as NVA staging 
areas. 
An offensive began 
March 5 in the Central 
Highlands, which run along 
the western side of central 
South Vietnam. Ban Me 
Thuot fell five days later. In 
a panicky decision made 
without considering all its 
ramifications or 'consulting 
the United States, President 
Thieu decided to shorten his 
logistical lines and reduce 
his battlefront by withdraw-
ing troops from the high-
lands. 
Inadequately prepared 
and incompletely executed, 
that withdrawal touched off 
a general collapse in the 
northern and central re-
gions. On March 26 the 
psychologically important 
old imperial capital of Hue 
fell to the NVA almost with-
out a fight, and on March 29 
Communists took over 
South Vietnam's second-
largest city, Danang. 
The Communists then de-
cided to finish the war by 
capturing Saigon, not by ne-
gotiating from their new , 
position of strength. 
fense minister, Vo Nguyen 
Giap, and its army chief of 
staff, Van Tien Dung, pub- . 
lished an article jointly in 
the four main Hanoi publi-
cations on June 30 recount-
ing how the final victory 
was achieved. They made it 
clear that the Communists 
had never had any intention 
of making a deal. 
After the collapse in the 
highlands and the Hue-Da 
nang area, they wrote, "the 
time was ripe for our armed 
forces and people.. .striking 
directly at the enemy's last 
lair in Saigon, completely 
annihilating the puppet 
army, totally overthrowing 
the puppet administration 
and achie,-iag complete 
victory 
"By late March, when the 
Huabattle was going to end 
in victory, we had already 
officially taken the decision 
to launch a historic cam-
paign of decisive 
significance . . .bearing 
the name of the great Presi-
dent Ho Chi Minh." 
This article in effect con-
firmed that the leadership 
in Hanoi had always consid-
ered Vietnam as one entity, 
despite the 1954 division of 
the country, and was in 
command of both parts 
while using the PLAF as a 
fiction to obscure its con-
trol. Western analysts have 
generally felt that the Viet 
Cong's National' Liberation 
Front (NLF) had a signifi-
cant southern appeal but 
was ultimately a creation of 
the unified leadership of 
northerners and southern-
ers in Hanoi. 
The Far Eastern Eco-
nomic Review, a weekly 
news magazine published in 
Hong Kong, carried on Aug. 
8 an interview with the 
chairman of the NLF's cen-
tral committee presidium, 
Nguyen Huu Tho. Although 
he was a figurehead whose 
insignificance has been 
emphasized by his invisibil-
ity since the fall of Saigon, 
Tho's account added de-
tails. 
"BY ABOUT THE begin-
ning of the last week of 
March, the determination to 
launch the historic 
campaign . . .was official-
ly laid down," Tho said. He 
did not mention who laid it 
down, since that would have 
exposed Hanoi's control. 
"At that time, we defi-
nitely reaffirmed that the 
total collapse of the puppet 
army and administration 
was unavoidable: the 
United States was com-
pletely incapable of rescu-
ing their agents in Saigon," 
Tho said. 
American analysts noted 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R0001'00380005-1 
that in early -April the 
NLF's Liberation Radio 
stopped referring to the 
Paris Agreement's provi-
sion for the establishment 
of a three-part National 
Council of National Recon-
ciliation and Concord of 
Thieu representatives, 
Communists and so-called 
neutralists as a transition 
away from the Thieu re-
gime. The radio had been 
using Thieu's reluctance to 
agree to this as a propagan-
da weapon, but the signifi-
cance of its being dropped 
was not appreciated at the 
time. 
In fact, the Communists 
had decided to abandon a 
negotiated settlement as an 
unnecessary encumbrance 
now that total victory was 
in sight. The Paris Agree-: 
ment, which was nibbled to 
death by both Hanoi and 
Saigon, had been ignored on 
one more section. 
Within two weeks'of the 
Communist decision, word 
on it had filtered through to 
the Central Intelligence Ag-
ency's offices on the sixth 
floor of the U. S. Embassy 
in Saigon. 
? THE INFORMATION 
came from what Americans 
called the Communists' 
-Central Office for South 
-Vietnam, or COSVN. This 
was the elusively mobile 
military and political head-
quarters for the war in the 
southern part of South Viet-
nam which U S. troops had 
tried unsuccessfully to cap-
ture in the May 1970 
invasion of Cambodia. 
COSVN was directed by 
Pham Hung, a member of 
the politburo of the Lao 
Dong Party the Commu-
nist organization based in 
Hanoi that rules Vietnam?
who outranked even Gen. 
Giap. Since the fall of Sai-
gon, Pham Hung has 
emerged as the man in 
charge of South Vietnam, 
taking precedence in offi-
cial lists over Tho and lead-
ers of the apparently 
powerless Provisional 
Revolutionary Government 
' (PRG). 
- Contrary to recent con-
gressional testimony about 
a lack of American intelli-
gence agents inside the Viet 
Cong apparatus, the CIA re-
ceived occasional reports 
from within COSVN. Over 
the years, these reports had 
repeatedly been proven 
accurate. 
The first report on the 
ate-March decision to 
smash over Saigon was 
brief. Coming at a time of 
rapid developments and 
numerous intelligence re-
ports of varying degrees of 
reliability, it seems not to 
have gotten much attention 
in either the Saigo*PPTAY-ed 
sy or in Washington. 
? 
A FACTOR contributing 
to this neglect was the mes-
sage which the Hungarians 
and Poles were beginning to 
whisper in American ears. 
When the ICCS was set up 
in 1973 supposedly to insure 
respect for the ceasefire 
agreement, it was generally 
assumed by Westerners 
that delegates from the two 
East European countries 
would be sympathetic to the 
Vietnamese Communists 
while the other two ele-
ments, Canadians and In-
donesians, would be more 
neutral or even sympathetic 
to Saigon's problems. Cana-
da quit the commission 
when it became impossible 
to overcome Communist ob-
struction and do a meaning-
ful supervision job, being 
replaced by Iran. 
With the ICCS moribund, 
the Hungarians and Poles 
took on a new role of inter-
mediaries, passing mes-
sages between the Commu-
nists and Americans. The 
Hungarians in particular 
came to be briefed regular-
ly on April's rapid develop-
ments by the CIA station 
chief, Thomas Polgar, who 
is of Hungarian origin. 
This relationship seemed 
to have developed because 
of Washington's desire to 
get word through to the 
Vietnamese Communists 
that would avoid any misun-
derstanding of U. S. inten-
tions. The Far Eastern Eco-
nomic Review quoted an 
official in Hanoi in another 
Aug. 8 article as saying, 
"The question we had to 
deal with was whether the 
United States could dis-
patch troops for the second 
time." . 
WHATEVER THE rea-
son, the Hungarians "were 
being told far more than 
they (U. S. officials in Sai-
gon) were telling anyone 
else at that point," accord-
ing to one source. 
The message -which the 
Hungarian and Polish ICCS 
delegations gave Polgar 
was that it would be possi-
ble to arrange a truce for 
the purpose of an orderly 
evacuation of Americans 
and some South Viet-
namese. A safe corridor 
from Saigon to the South 
China Sea for the overland 
movement of refugees to 
Vung Tau or some other 
seaport was mentioned 
The message also con-
tained or implied ? it is not 
clear which one ? that the 
Communists would negoti-
ate an end of the war with 
some acceptable adminis-
tration in Saigon. That 
meant somone other than 
Thieu with the _preference 
Eptrt e4V MigafPaga 
Minh, the general known 
'-'from his large stature for a 
Vietnamese as "Big Minh." 
He had been a weak and 
ineffectual South Viet-
namese chief of state for 14 
months after President Ngo 
Dinh Diem was overthrown 
and murdered in November 
1963. 
The French embassy in 
Saigon was active behind 
the scenes at the same time. 
Ambassador Jean-Marie 
Merillon was told by his 
contacts that the Commu-
nists were willing to com-
promise an end to the war 
with Minh, once Thieu was 
removed from power. This 
information supported the 
Hungarian and Polish mes-
sage and seemed to confirm 
it. 
The military situation 
was looking desperate as 
NVA troops closed in on the 
Saigon area. On April 10, 
Ford asked Congress for an 
emergency allocation of 
$722 million in arms aid to 
Saigon, plus $250 million as 
an "initial" amount of eco-
nomic and humanitarian 
aid. This was presented as 
a possibility of saving South 
Vietnam, although Kissing-
er conceded later a lesser 
goal which he had only 
implied at the time. 
THE COURSE then being 
pursued, Kissinger said 
April 29, "was designed to 
save the Americans still in 
Vietnam and the maximum 
number of Vietnamese 
lives, should the worst come 
to pass." The prospects for 
salvaging the military 
situation even with massive 
new aid were "somewhat 
less than 50-50," he added. 
But there were hopes of 
negotiating an orderly end-
ing. 
Then on April 17 the CIA 
received a more detailed 
account of the late-March 
decision. A source in 
COSVN reported that there 
definitely would not be any 
truce or negotiations with 
any governmental entity in 
Saigon, whether headed by 
Minh or anyone else. 
Instead, the report said, 
plans were being made to 
attack Saigon as soon as 
preparations were com-
pleted and to capture it. de-
stroying any semblance of 
organized opposition to 
Communist rule. One detail 
offered to substantiate this 
was that radar units were 
being put on Black Virgin 
Mountain to direct captured 
American-made planes for 
an attack on Tan Son Nhut. 
Black Virgin Mountain is 
a volcanic cone that rises 
3,235 feet above the Mekong 
River plain 55 miles north-
northwest of Saigon. A site 
for American cornmunica-
CM*8307-srainttoctitloo 
war, it ha een capture 
)45 ? 
657 NVA troops on Jan. 9. . 
Within two days after the 
COSVN report was re-
ceived, photc reconnais-
sance had confirmed that 
radar was being emplaced 
on the mountain. But de-
spite this and the very high ? 
rating given the report's 
probable reliability, it got a 
mixed reception in Saigon 
and Washington. 
THE MILITARY reaction 
was quick. 
The U. S. Navy and civil-
ian American vessels had 
been on alert in the South 
China Sea since Ford mobi-
lized ships for the evacua-
tion of Danang and other 
coastal towns at the end of 
March. A higher stage of 
alert for an emergency 
evacuation of Americans 
from Saigon by helicopter 
was put into effect April 18 
as a result of the new intel-
ligence. 
The U. S. aircraft carrier 
Enterprise sailed into Mani-
la harbor April 18 for an an-
nounced five-day visit. It 
abruptly left a few hours 
later. The carrier Hancock, 
which had arrived at Singa-
pore April 16 for a sched-
uled seven-day visit, also 
sailed April 18. All over 
East Asian waters, Navy 
ships were marshalled for 
impending collapse in Sai-
gon, with most of them 
arriving off the South Viet-
namese coast between April 
19 and 21. 
The State Department 
sent a cable to Ambassador 
Martin which seems to have, 
been triggered by the intel-
ligence, although this con-
nection cannot be confirm-
ed. It asked him about 
evacuation plans. 
EVERY U. S. embassy in 
a hazardous situation is 
?supposed to have an up-to-
date plan to evacuate 
embassy personnel and 
other Americans. But the' 
Saigon plan was out of date 
and inadequate to the situa-
tion in mid-April. Martin 
had always taken the atti-
tude that Thieu's regime 
would last indefinitely, and 
therefore his subordinates 
? most of them hand-pick-
ed for loyalty rather than 
competence.? had not been 
pressed to follow State De-
partment regulations on 
this. 
Some administrative divi-
sions of the huge embassy 
had been asked to turn in 
lists not only of Americans 
but also of Vietnamese 
whose lives might be in dan-
ger if the Communists took 
over and therefore should 
be evacuated. These were 
tossed into a box and when 
01944ion finally fell 
r`f They could not be

found in the panicky chaos 
of embasssy administra-
tion. 
Martin's answer to the 
State Department's query ' 
was that he had no plan to 
evacuate local Vietnamese 
employes because there 
were too many of them and 
besides an evacuation 
would induce panic in Sai-
gon, possibly causing Thieu 
to fall. At the same time, 
Martin's deputy, Wolfgang 
J. Lehmann, was telling 
embasssy division heads at 
staff meetings that plans 
were being made to take 
care of their high-risk em-
ployes, for whom many of 
the other diplomats felt 
great personal responsibil-
ity. 
One officer in the embas-
sy says flatly that Martin 
lied to some embassy per-
sonnel about evacuation 
? plans, but others report 
only evasions. 
U. S. Air Force planes 
were evacuating some per-
sons from Saigon at the 
? time. They were mostly em-
ployes of the U. S. Army, 
while others were waiting 
for further word from the 
embassy. 
KISSINGER CABLED 
back after getting Martin's 
answer, saying it was 
inadequate. Under pressure 
from the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee and 
other congressional units, 
the secretary of state asked 
Martin to speed up the 
reduction of airplane evacu-
ations so the number of per-
sons who might need to be 
lifted out by helicopter 
would be manageable. 
But Martin felt no great 
urgency. On the basis of the 
Hungarian and Polish mes-
sage, he did not think a heli-
copter lift would be neces-
sary. 
The evaluation in 
Washington was complex. 
Every morning a number of 
groups met around town to 
review the latest develop-
ments, and late every after-
noon a meeting was con-
vened at the State 
Department. Chaired by 
Philip C. Habib, assistant 
secretary of state for East 
Asian and Pacific Affairs, it 
was attended Most of the 
time by Kissinger's No. 2 
man, Deputy Secretary 
Robert S. Ingersoll. 
Representatives of State, 
the National Security Coun-
cil, the Pentagon, the CIA 
and other branches of gov-
ernment met with Habib to 
try to make plans. But they 
were almost overwhelmed 
by the mass of sometimes 
conflicting and often confu-
sion reports, according to 
one participant in the meet-
ings. 
Commenting on the April 
17 report from COSVN, this 
source said that the CIA 
usually failed to indicate 
clearly which reports out of 
a mass of intelligence de-
served more credence than 
others. A desire to protect 
? 
CIA agents obscured the 
fact that this particular re-
port came directly from 
COSVN, the source added. 
APPARENTLY reflect-
ing the intelligence, Ford 
said in an interview April 21 
that he had the impression 
in the previous few days 
that Hanoi was seeking a

ri Last Iays of Saigon? 
By Henry S. Bradsher 
Washington Star Staff Writer 
With the North Vietnamese Army 
(NVA) massing troops around Sai-
gon late last April, the United States 
did not know whether to expect the 
? city to be overrun militarily ? forc-
ing an emergency helicopter evacua-
tion of remaining Americans ? or an 
imposed but peaceful ending that 
I would establish Communist predomi-
. twice while permitting an orderly 
. U.S. withdrawal. 
The situation was confused, the 
evidence conflicting. 
On April 21, Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger said that the 
Ford administration was seeking 
a "controlled situation" which 
permit a negotiated end to the long 
war and an orderly transition from 
the regime of President Nguyen Van 
Thieu, who resigned that day, to 
Communist control. ? 
"Various negotiating efforts are 
going on," Kissinger added, "but it 
would be inappropriate for me to dis-
? cuss them at this moment." 
ONE CHANNEL was through the 
French ambassador in Saigon, Jean-
Marie Merillon. Heplayed a key role 
in convincing Thieu to resign be-
cause of Merillon's understanding 
from Communist contacts that with 
Thieu removed it might or would be 
possible to reach a compromise. 
peace arrangement. 
But more important was 
the word from Hungarian 
rand Polish delegates on the 
International Commission 
,of Control and Supervision 
(Second of two articles). 
(ICCS), established by the 
moribund Paris cease-fire 
agreement of January 1973. 
They were telling the U.S. 
Embassy in Saigon that a 
deal was possible. It would 
include a truce and a corn--
dor to the sea for the evacu-
ation of Americans and 
.some Vietnamese. 
On the other hand, the 
Saigon station of the CIA 
had received reports from 
agents of proven reliability 
,in the Communists' Central 
Office for South Vietnam, 
or COSVN, which were con-
'tradictory. A report of April 
17 in particular said that in 
late March the Communists 
?,,had decided not to compro-
mise ? that, instead, they 
would overrun Saigon and 
,smash any semblance of 
organized resistance. 
A detail of that report 
added that radar was being 
put on Black Virgin Moun-
tain 55 miles north-north-
west of Saigon to guide 
warplanes for an air raid as 
part of the attack on the 
city. U.S. aerial reconnais-
sance confirmed the radar 
installation. 
This report triggered the 
abrupt diversion of U.S. 
Navy ships to evacuation 
duty off the South Viet-
namese coast. But it did not 
convince Ambassador 
quick military takeover, but 
there was "no way to tell 
what the North Vietnamese 
will do." He noted that a 
lull in fighting had set in 
around Saigon earlier that 
day. 
This turned out to be a 
five-day lull, beginning as 
Martin, Polgar and the 
French ambasssador, 
Merillon, finally convinced 
Thieu that he should resign 
for the good of South Viet-
nam. The lull seemed to 
substantiate the Hungarian 
and Polish message of an 
evacuation truce, but 
evacuation went ahead only 
fairly slowly while high-risk 
Vietnamese remained in 
their jobs. 
Officials here decided 
that, because of the conflict 
between intelligence and 
diplomatic reports, the 
possibility of an arranged 
end needed to be checked 
with North Vietnam. The 
Soviet Union was asked to 
inquire in Hanoi.

Hungarian-Polish hope of 
an orderly end were false. 
THE NEGOTIATING 
-possibility was closely held 
in Washington by President 
Ford and. a handful of offi-
cials around Kissinger. The 
secretary of state was, as

looking situation. 
He decided to ask the 
Soviet Union ? in the spirit 
of detente ? to see if it 
could learn from Hanoi 
what Vietnamese Commu-
nist intentions were. This 
might resolve the conflict in 
available information. 
According to several sen-
ior officials, the Soviet 
,reply was ambiguous. 
Asked if it were true that 
a truce and orderly evacua-
tion were possible, Moscow 
came back ? ostensibly 
after contacting Hanoi ? 
with a reply to the effect 
that the United States could 
proceed on that assump-
tion. One official called it 
"ambiguous," and another 
said it was "vague and 
uncertain." 
Kissinger said in an 
46 
Approved-t- or Release AlCf1705708 :-CIA:RDP7T-D11432RUII010p380-095--.1 ? 
interview. May '5,* "The 
.:Soviet Union played, in the 
-last two weeks, a moder-
ately constructive role in 
enabling us to understand 
? the possibilities there were 
for evacuation, both of 
Americans and South Viet-
namese, and for the possi-
bilities that might exist for 
a political evolution." 
SOME LOWER officials 
feel that Moscow was a 
:party to the deceit of get-
ting the United States to be-
lieve it could get out of 
Vietnam smoothly and re-
spectably. But other offi-
cials refuse to accept this, 
suggesting that the Soviets 
were kept in the dark by the 
Vietnamese Communist 
Jeadership arid put off with 
-a deliberately uninform-
ative answer when they 
tried to aat as intermedi-
-aries for Washington. 
Apparently referring to-
the Soviet channel and 
messages coming from the 
Hungarian and Polish ICCS 
delegations in Saigon, and 
maybe the French as well, 
Kissinger said April 29 as 
the evacuation ended that 
"we did deal with Hanoi 
and with the PRG (Provi-
sional Revolutionary Gov-
ernment) through different 
intermediaries and we were 
in a position to put our

The secretary of state 
...added that until ISunday 
'night, April 27, Washington 
time, which was Monday 
morning, April 28, in Sai-
gon, "we thought there was 
some considerable hope 
that the North Vietnamese 
would not seek a solution by 
purely military 
means. . . ." Duong Van 
Minh had then become 
president, and "we thdught 
a negotiated solution in the 
. next few days was highly 
probable. 
"Sometime Sunday night 
the North Vietnamese obvi-
? ously changed signals. Why 
? that is, we do not yet 
know . . . What produced 
This sudden shift to a mili-
tary option or what would 
seem to us to be a sudden 
? shift to a military option, I 
have not had sufficient 
- opportunity to analyze." 
Until Sunday, Kissinger 
said, "the battlefield situa-
tion suggested that there 
was a standdown of signifi-
cant military activity and 
the public pronouncements 
were substantially in the 
direction that a negotiation 
would start with General 
Minh. There were also 
other reasons which led us 
to believe that the possibil-
ity of a negotiation remain-
ed open." 
SOME INFORMED oh-
servers think the five-day 
lull or standdown was 
mainly a preparatory peri-
od for the NVA, although it 
began when Thieu resigned 
April 21. But it fit with the 
whisperings of a truce and 
orderly American with-
- drawal, and also with the 
analysts of U.S. Hanoi-
watchers in Saigon. 
Ignoring the absence of 
further references in 
Communist propaganda to 
carrying out the Paris 
agreement's provisions,' 
which had significantly 
'disappeared by early April, 
these analysts felt that it 
was in North Vietnam's 
interests to bring the war to 
a negotiated end. 
The. analysts reasoned 
? that by making a deal with 
Minh which left some sem-
blance of a continuing Sai-
.gon administration, al-
though it would be 
subordinated in 'a 
Communist-controlled 
superstructure, the 
Communists would be able 
to claim the legitimacy of 
the, agreement which had 
been endorsed by world 
powers. They also would 
have some claim to Ameri-
can aid for reconstruction. 
There were other ele.-
? A piess report from Mos-
cow April 18 said Soviets in 
contact with North Viet-
namese and the Viet Cong 
did not expect them to try 
to achieve all-out victory 
by conquest. And on April 
19 the PRG's representative 
stationed at Tan Son Nhut 
air base on the outskirts of 
Saigon under Paris agree-
ment arrangements, Col. 
Vo Dong Giang, hinted at a 
peaceful arrangement 
rather than an attack. 
ALL OF THESE rein-
forced the Hungarian-Pol-
ish message, creating a 
conviction by Martin and 
some others in the Saigon 
embasssy that a deal was 
being struck. Apparently 
after some further detail 
from the ICCS Communists, 
and with receipt of a Soviet 
reply, the word went 
around in top embassy; cir-
cles that "the fix is in." 
On Thursday, April 24, 
Martin's deputy ambassa-
dor, Wolfgang J. Lehmann, 
telephoned his wife Odette 
in Bangkok, where she had 
been evacuated with other 
embassy dependents. Leh-
mann told her to come back 
and bring a long list of per-
sonal supplies, because a 
deal had been made and 
they would be in Saigon for 
some time to come. . 
This was at a time when, 
the White House said, Ford 
had ordered American per-
sonnel reduced "to levels 
that could be quickly 
evacuated during an emer-
gency." Martin's embassy 
was operating on its own 
interpretations, with what 
looked in retrospect like 
wishful thinking strongly 
affecting analysis of the 
situation.

American perceptions. 
The Giap-Dung article 
said that the final offensive 
began at 5 p.m. Saturday, 
April 26 -- early Saturday 
morning in Washington. By 
early the next morning in 
Vietnam, rockets were 
being dropped into Saigon 
and attacks had started on 
QLI5, the road from Saigon 
to Vung Tau. The hope of an 
agreed evacuation had in-
cluded the Communists' 
leaving open that Corridor 
to the sea. 
The big American-built 
military logistical complex 
at Bien Hoa, 15 miles north-
east of Saigon, was also 
under attack. On Sunday a 
team led by Erich F. von 
Marbod, a principal deputy 
assistant secretary of de-
fense in charge of military 
aid to Indochina, recovered 
some valuable aid equip-
ment from Bien Hoa while 
under artillery fire. 
Von Marbod had gone se-
? cretly to Vietnam to try to 
get back as much U.S. aid 
supplies as possible before 
?the Communists captured 
it., The Pentagon was 
worried about congression-
al criticism of losing more 
than the approximately $800 
million worth of military 
equipment which had al-
ready been abandoned in 
northern South Vietnam. 
After being shot out of 
Bien Hoa on Sunday, Von 
Marbod went to see Martin 
on Monday morning. Mar-
tin. advised him that it was 
unnecessary to take 
chances because there 
would shortly be a halt in 
fighting during which sup-
plies as well as personnel 
could be evacuated by ar-
rangement with the 
Communists. 
VON ,MARBOD WENT 
back to Bien Hoa anyway. 
Again under fire, he 
"supervised activities for

causing surprise and a ris-
ing sense of panic. 
Panic peaked at 4 a.m. 
Tuesday when a rocket and 
artillery barrage hit the air ; 
base. It was the beginning 
of the final Communist 
offensive. But Martin found 
.that hard to believe. 
AFTER DAWN HE went. 
out to see for himself where 
the shells had landed, kill-
ing two U.S. Marine guards 
and others. Back at his 
embassy, Martin told staff-
ers that he could not under-
stand it. He still refused to 
believe that the Commu-
nists would persist in a 
military takeover, but in-
stead thought there could or 
would be a political settle-
ment. 
Washington never seem-
ed to understand, much less 
accept, the degree of cer-
tainty which had gripped 
Martin and some others in 
his embassy. The barrage 
at Tan Son Nhut led ,to 
Ford's ordering the final 
helicopter evacuation. Mar-
tin strung it out as long as 
possible, getting the maxi-
mum possible number of 
Vietnamese removed at the 
last minute after having 
failed to provide for them 
earlier. 
Martin had been a con-
troversial figure in Saigon 
since Nixon sent him there 
in 1973. He 'had sought to 
distort reports to Congress 
and in the press so as to put 
the best possible face on the 
situation. In. the final 
month, he seemed unre-
sponsive to the realities as 
viewed from Washington. 
It was not just Congress 
which was exasperated 
with him during the delay 
in reducing the embassy 
staff, to easily evacuated 
limits. Persons who attend-
ed the crisis meetings 
chaired by Habib reported 
very critical comments 
about Martin by Habib and 
others, at least in part re-
flecting the distress of 
embassy personnel in Sai-
gon about the lag in ar-
? ranging for the safety of 
Vietnamese for whom they 
felt responsible. 
But the degree to which 
Martin was being led as-
tray by the Hungarians and 
Poles as well as his own 
wishful thinking was never 
properly appreciated here. 
While Kissinger and others 
allowed theft- hopes for a 
peaceful settlement to rise 
about April 21, officials 
here kept in sight the need 
for a final col-

lapse Martin apparently 
' did not. 
THE ULTIMATE result 
of the Communist decision 
in late March to smash all 
resistance came on 
\ Wednesday, April 30, in 
Saigon ? late Tuesday 
here. After the last Ameri-
can helicopter had gone, 
leaving behind panicky 
thousands who felt aban-
doned, NVA troops march-
ed into the capital with little 
resistance. The Giap-Dung 
article said that "at exactly 
11:30 on 30 April our army 
planted the flag of the 
F'RGRSV (PRG Republic of 
South Vietnam) atop the 
puppet presidential palace 
and the Ho Chi Minh cam-
paign achieved complete 
victory." 
At 10:24 a.m., Minh had 
broadcast an order for 
WAS} NGTON STAR

OPTIGIAlfaMolthIgrAle... 
southern soldiers to stop 
fighting. He said he was 
waiting at the palace to 
meet PRG representatives 
"to discuss the ceremony to 
hand over power. . . ." 
But that meant Minh 
claimed to head a still. 
functioning regime which 
could deal with the 
Communists. They would 
have none of that. His offer 
was ignored. 
At 3:22 p.m., some hours 
after he had been captured, 
Minh came on the air 
again. "The president of 
the Saigon administration 
calls on the Army of the 
Republic of (South) Viet-
nam to lay down their arms 
and to surrender uncondi-
tionally to the South Viet-
nam Liberation Army," 
Minh said. "I declare that 
the Saigon administration 
from the central to the local 
echelons must be complete-
ly dissolved and turned 
over to the PRGRSV." 
? A Communist voice then 
came on and said the 
unconditional surrender 
was accepted. Nothing was 
left of the Thieu regime's 
structure or the Paris 
agreement concept of a 
three-part shared transi-
tional arrangement. 
TWO CONGRESSIONAL 
subcommittees have sub-
mitted letters to the State 
Department asking that 
Martin testify about those 
last days. They are the 
legislation and national se-
curity subcommittee of the 
House Government Opera-
tions Committee arid the 
House International Rela-
tions Committee's special 
subcommittee on investiga-
tions. 
Martin had been in the 
United States for medical 
treatment late last winter 
and has been sick again 
since he was taken by heli-
copter off his embassy's 
roof. The subcommittees 
have been told orally that 
he could not appear be-
cause of illness. 
He was discharged from 
a hospital almost two weeks 
ago and now, while on 
leave, is haunting the State 
Department asking when 
he will be given a new 
ambassadorial posting. 
The White House has not 
decided what to do with 
him. Senior officials want to 
avoid any reopening of the 
Saigon' sore and therefore 
doubt that Martin's name 
will ever be put before the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee for another ap-
pointment to ambpssador.

The Ford administration 
will slow down on treaty ne-
gotiations with Panama and 
the movement toward re-
sumption of normal rela-
tions with Cuba until after 
the 1976 U.S. elections. 
The "freeze" on progress 
toward eventual restoration 
of political and commercial 
relations with Cuba is gear-
ed to the March 9 primaries 
in Florida, where there are 
many Cuban-American 
voters, as well as the No-
vember elections. The nego-
tiations with Panama for a 
new treaty on the canal and 
the Canal Zone will drag 
until after Americans vote 
next year. 
Officials say the Panama 
decision must be regarded 
as practical as well as po-
litical. The administration 
and Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger are firm 
in their desire for a new 
treaty with Panama that 
will result in eventual relin-
quishment of control of the 
strategic waterway and the 
10-mile-wide Canal Zone to 
the Republic of Panama. 
WHAT THEY have in 
mind is a treaty that would 
leave the United States in 
control of the canal until the 
early 21st century but with 
gradual sharing of func-
tions with Panama and an 
end to the Canal Zone as an

The Christian Science Monitor 
The United States and Cuba are, in a sense, 
shadow boxing as they inch toward rapproche-
ment. 
Both have in recent days set up conditions 
that on the surface might seem to preclude an 
early movement toward some sort of new 
U.S.-Cuba relationship. 
But these conditions are, in the view of long-
time observers, merely bargaining points. 
Cuba last week reiterated its demand that 
Puerto Rico be granted independence and 
warned Washington that it would not give up 
its position for the sake of rapprochement. 
Earlier State Department officials had said 
that the Cuban position on Puerto Rico was a 
stumbling block in the path of normalizing 
relations. 
American enclave from the 
outset. 
But the administration 
realizes that any attempt to 
obtain congressional ap-
proval for a new treaty 
poses risks in an election-
year atmosphere. If the 
Senate rejects the treaty, or 
if the House exercises its 
prerogative to bar transfer 
of any property acquired 
with government funds, the 
forecasts of experts are that 
there will be violence on a 
heavy scale by the Pana-
manians against the zone 
and the canal. 
Administration analysts 
do not wish to thrust a 
treaty on Congress in a na-
tional election year when 
senators and representa-
tives are most susceptible 
to both lobbying and voter 
reaction. There are con-
gressmen who might vote 
for the treaty in 1977 who 
would not in 1976. And 
rejection of the-treaty in ei-
ther House will be enough 
to thrust the United States 
into a potential emergency 
that might require military 
intervention. 
Since the last thing Wash-
ington wants is any repeat 
of the 1964 riots, in which 
the U.S. Army faced Pana-
manian mobs in pitched 
battle, Ambassador Ells

'here believe that Panama's 
strongman, Brig. Gen. 
Omar Torrijos, well under-
stands the U.S. domestic 
problem. While Torrijos has 
? tight control in Panama 
through his well-trained 
Guardia Nacional force of 
more than 7,000 military 
and police units, even he 
could not restrain a violent 
surge of nationalistic reac-
tion should the treaty reach 
Capitol Hill and be defeated 
there. 
Torrijos cannot afford to 
publicly acknowledge 
acquiescence with a slow-
down in treaty negotiations, 
since he has made far too, 
many flaming speeches on 
the subject of the Canal 
Zone and Panamanian 
sovereignty there. But 
pri-
vately, it is believed Torri-
jos and his foreign minister, 
Juan Tack, will go along 
In general, the United 
States has acknowledged 
that the 1903 treaty needs 
revision so that Panama's 
sovereignty and control of 
the zone is realized; that 
many U.S. functions in the 
zone must be transferred to 
Panama; that Panama 
should share in control, 
operation and defense of the 
isthmian waterway for a 
period of years and then 
obtain full control. 
The main differences re-
maining to be settled lie in 
the time span for the hand-
ing over of the zone and the 
canal to Panama. 
BUNKER WILL continue 
to travel periodically to 
Panama for negotiating ses-
sions, but the administra-
tion no longer contemplates 
completion of the treaty or 
signing of the document by 
President Ford for at least 
13 months 
The Cuban issue poses 
problems for any candidate 
in the Florida primaries 
where many anti-Castro 
Cubans are now American 
citizens and registered 
voters. The administration 
has made clear that it is 
prepared for a return to 
normal relations with Cuba 
if Premier Fidel Castro 
wishes this. But it also 
recognizes the explosive-
ness, of the Cuban issue in 
Florida. 
Cuba actually made it 
easy for the State Depart-
ment to reduce the pace of 
restoration of ties. When 
the Cubans made a big 
show at the United Nations 
General Assembly recently 
of attacking U.S. "coloni-
alism"in Puerto Rico and 
supporting independence 
for the island common-
wealth, the United States 
was handed an excuse. 
Only a minority of Puerto 
Ricans favor independence. 
The major issue in Puerto 
rico is whether the island 
should opt for statehood or 
continue as a common-
wealth.

Cu .a inch towar 
impediment to lifting the embargo on Cuba 
and smoothing the way to relations was the 
estimated $1.6 billion in claims against the 
Cuban government by U.S. citizens and 
companies whose interests were expropriated 
in the early 1960s. Cuba has rejected these 
claims. 
As far as Puerto Rico is concerned, Cuba 
knows that the majority of the Puerto Rican 
people have rejected independence, although 
many would like some changes in the present 
commonwealth status. Cuba will continue its 
support for independence, however, in spite of 
Washington's objections. 
And as far as the claims of U.S. citizens and 
companies are concerned, Washington is 
aware that there is little likelihood of any 
compensation being paid, although some 
token payments might well be forthcoming in 
a few cases. Yet the U.S. will continue to

achieve its goal on these points and its position 
therefore is not implacable. 
Meanwhile, Washington has acknowledged 
that the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba has 
become less and less effective. The Commerce 
Department in a report last week said that 
higher sugar prices have given Cuba more 
money to spend. 
"Unilateral continuation of the Cuba em-
bargo becomes a bit more costly to the United 
States, though that economic cost is still 
relatively small," the report said. 
The U.S. in August eased the embargo by 
allowing foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of 
U.S. companies to do business with Cuba. The 
value of this business is relatively small, but it 
is seen as a sign of the time. 
There are other signs: Cuba recently 
returned $2 million to Southern Airways from 
a 1972 skyjacking and it granted a permit for 
the parents of Boston Red Sox pitcher Luis 
Tiant to visit their son during the conclusion of
