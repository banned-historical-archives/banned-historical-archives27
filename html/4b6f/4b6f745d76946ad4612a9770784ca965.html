 LEBANON: TURN FOR THE WORSE
 The occupation by renegade Muslim soldiers
 of several Lebanese army bases this week has led
 to another political crisis in Beirut and to fears
 that the six-week-old cease-fire may collapse.
 Christian and leftist leaders have reverted to
 tougher positions in the negotiations on forming
 an expanded cabinet, and Prime Minister Karami
 has again threatened to resign. The deteriorating
 security situation has led to an increase in the
 number of violent incidents in northern Lebanon
 and in the capital, and to an increase in tension on
 Lebanon's southern border, where the Israelis are
 carefully watching for any buildup of Syrian-con-
 trolled Palestinian forces.
 Karami's threat to resign was included in a
 March 11 statement expressing his frustration
 with the obstinate stands adopted by politicians
 on both sides of the Lebanese dispute. He almost
 certainly hopes that neither President Franjiyah
 nor the Syrians will allow him to follow through
 with his threat. Karami presumably wants Fran-
 jiyah to accept and marshal Christian support for
 Karami's preferred strategy of offering a general
 amnesty to all army deserters. He wants` the
 Syrians either to force Lieutenant Ahmad Khatib,
 leader of the rebels, to accept an amnesty or to
 use Syrian-controlled Palestinian troops to take
 military action against Khatib's forces.
 On March 10, the commander of Lebanon's
 army did offer amnesty to "those who are now
 outside the army," but it was not clear whether
 his offer would include the leaders of the dissi-
 dent Muslim forces. The rebel leaders have
 replied only that they will await evidence that the
 army command will make good on its promises.
 The dissidents are apprehensive that those who
 accept amnesty will in fact be imprisoned and are
 doubtful that the army will follow through on its
 implied commitment to adopt a more aggressive
 stand toward Israel. In the hope of placating the
 rebels, the army commander said in his March 10
 statement that the "army of the future will defend
 Lebanon's borders."
 Israeli leaders are closely monitoring events
 in southern Lebanon, where the dissidents have
 seized several military bases, but so far the Israelis
 have refrained from any comment or move that
 would inflame the situation. They fear that the
 spread of the mutiny to the border region will
 draw additional Palestinian forces into the area.
 Previously, Israeli leaders had indicated that they
 would consider the presence of major non-
 Lebanese forces in southern Lebanon a direct
 threat to Israel's security.
 The Syrians, who are aware of Israel's ap-
 prehensions and desirous of avoiding confronta-
 tion with Israeli forces, still appear determined to
 contain or ultimately put down the Muslim army
 revolt with Palestinian troops. Both independent
 and Syrian-controlled Palestinian forces have the
 military capability to end the army revolt. They
 have been reluctant to do so, however, because
 Khatib is a hero to many Muslims. Moreover, the
 revolt serves as a reminder to the Christians that
 they are dependent on the Syrians and
 Palestinians to maintain order in most parts of
 Lebanon, and must cooperate in implementing a
 political settlement to secure a permanent peace.
 Now that the revolt has reached the point
 that it complicates rather than facilitates
 negotiations,  however, the Syrians and
 Palestinians probably will follow through with
 more forceful action to stop it. The Syrians are still
 committed to enforcing the cease-fire and have a
 long-term interest in seeing the Lebanese army
 strengthened  rather  than  destroyed.

 RHODESIA:    J '  /  9
 Pressure Increasing
 Mozambique's closure of its borders with
 Rhodesia last week has stepped up the economic
 and military pressures on Prime Minister Ian
 Smith's white minority regime. The Rhodesian
 settlers are now more dependent than ever on
 the support of the South African government.
 Mozambican President Machel has cut all the
 substantial ties with Rhodesia that his country in-
 herited. from the Portuguese when it became in-
 dependent last year. Machel has not only blocked
 the Rhodesian transit traffic through ports in
 Mozambique, but also stopped all local trade and
 communications between the two countries and
 prohibited Mozambicans from going to Rhodesia
 for work.
 Such a total boycott will be very costly for
 both countries. Roughly half of Rhodesia's
 overseas trade had been funneled through
 Salisbury

 Mozambique's ports. Machel's already serious
 financial problems will be worsened by the loss of
 foreign currency hitherto derived from handling
 Rhodesian traffic and from the remittances of
 some 200,000 Mozambicans who have been work-
 ing on Rhodesian plantations. Sharp increases in
 unemployment and likely food shortages
 resulting from the boycott will intensify existing
 social tensions.
 The South African transportation network is
 physically capable of handling a significant por-
 tion of the Rhodesian traffic that had been going
 through Mozambique, giving Vorster a new op-
 portunity to bring pressure on Smith to cooperate
 with his efforts to resolve the Rhodesian conflict.
 Vorster has been quietly pushing Smith to com-
 promise with the black nationalists since late 1974,
 and he no doubt is more anxious now than ever
 to bring about a settlement that might head off
 an escalating insurgency that might eventually be
 supported by Cuban troops.
 Vorster's reinforced leverage over Smith,
 however, must be used discreetly. The Mozam-
 bican boycott is an application of the UN sanc-
 tions against Smith that are anathema to white

 South Africans, and Vorster must avoid any move
 that would appear to be going along with UN
 sanctions.  On the other hand, an emergency
 rerouting of Rhodesian trade would involve some
 costly disruptions in South Africa's normal traffic
 patterns-a politically acceptable explanation for
 rationing aid to Smith.
 Machel's action has locked him into further
 support for the Rhodesian nationalists, who are
 determined to overthrow Smith unless he agrees
 to an early transfer of power to the black majority.
 Machel is already heavily involved with other
 southern African leaders in joint military
 preparations for backing the Rhodesian in-
 surgents based in Mozambique, who are starting
 to expand their guerrilla operations inside
 Rhodesia.
 Soviets Wary
 ;LI3
 Moscow is being cautious in both its public
 and private statements on the volatile situation in
 southern Africa. This may reflect the Kremlin's
 sensitivity to African desires-particularly on the
 part of Mozambique's Samora Machel and Tan-
 zania's Nyerere-that the liberation effort against
 the "White Redoubt" remain firmly in African
 hands.
 General Secretary Brezhnev strongly reaf-
 firmed Soviet support for national liberation
 struggles in his keynote address to the party con-
 gress, but said nothing about liberating "racist
 Africa." Moreover, delegates to the congress
 responded unenthusiastically to speeches by of-
 ficials from a number of pro-Soviet African leftist
 regimes and insurgent organizations.
 Not surprisingly, the second-echelon
 representatives from the Popular Movement in
 Angola, the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, the South
 African Communist Party, and the South-West
 Africa People's Organization expounded on the
 need to support national liberation movements
 and to oppose white minority regimes in southern
 Africa. The subdued audience reaction to their
 ideas suggests the Soviets were less interested in
 hearing about local conditions in Africa than in
 listening to the speakers' praise of past and future
 Soviet influence on the continent. Nevertheless,
 there was greater African representation at this
 congress than in 1971, including-for the first
 time-black nationalist delegations from
 Rhodesia and Namibia.
 Soviet media, also, have been taking a
 cautious approach toward developments in
 southern Africa. They did not, for example, replay
 those portions of the recent saber-rattling speech
 by Popular Movement leader Neto in which he
 pledged all-out support for liberation groups
 targeted against Rhodesia and Namibia. Instead,
 the Soviet press hailed the normalization of
 relations between Angola and Zaire and
 emphasized Neto's willingness to cooperate with
 his African neighbors.
 Soviet diplomats abroad have been putting
 out a similarly bland line on Southern Africa. On
 several recent occasions, Soviet personnel assign-
 ed to the UN told US officials that they anticipated
 no Soviet-Cuban role in Rhodesia. They observed
 that one potential problem for Moscow and
 Havana in supporting guerrilla operations against
 the Smith regime was the absence of a
 well-organized local liberation movement. The
 Soviet and Romanian ambassadors to Tanzania
 have seconded this view. Both recently told the
 US ambassador in Dar es Salaam that they saw no
 likelihood that the present Soviet and Cuban
 presence in Angola would be shifted to either
 Rhodesia or Namibia.
 Such expressions of Soviet diffidence cannot
 be accepted at face value, particularly in light of
 unconfirmed reports that some Cuban troops and
 surplus Soviet military equipment may have
 recently been transferred from Angola to support
 Rhodesian guerrillas based in Mozambique.
 Nevertheless, they do suggest that Moscow has
 not yet geared up its machinery to justify an asser-
 tive policy toward Rhodesia, Namibia, and South

 MOROCCO-ALGERIA: DIPLOMATIC BREAK
 Morocco and Mauritania severed diplomatic
 ties with Algeria this week as the dispute between
 the three countries over Western Sahara con-
 tinued. The move does not seem to presage any
 military escalation by either Morocco or Algeria.
 Rabat's communique announcing the break
 explained that it was prompted by Algeria's for-
 mal recognition on March 6 of the Saharan
 Democratic Arab Republic, which was proclaim-
 ed on February 27 by the Algerian-backed
 Polisario Front. Algeria's recognition followed the
 Front's announcement last week that it had form-
 ed a "government" headed by a native Saharan,
 Mohamed Lamine Ould Ahmed.
 IRabat's
 action was designed primarily to warn other states
 not to recognize the Polisario entity if they value
 their relations with Morocco. Morocco and
 Mauritania have partitioned the former Spanish
 dependency, and each considers its portion to be
 now part of its sovereign territory.
 Thus far, only Burundi, Madagascar, and
 Benin, in addition to Algeria, have recognized the
 Polisario "state." An East European diplomat in
 Rabat claims that the USSR and other East Euro-
 pean countries are not planning to extend
 recognition under present circumstances.
 Mauritanian President Ould Daddah
 probably followed Morocco's lead reluctantly.
 Although some of his ministers have been urging
 him to break relations for the past month, Ould
 Daddah apparently hoped to work out a face-
 saving accommodation with Algiers on the con-
 tentious Saharan self-determination issue. He
 recently stated that he was not opposed to a free
 and honest referendum, expressing confidence
 that the people of Western Sahara would opt for
 Mauritanian citizenship if given their choice.
 The statement seemed to move him some
 distance toward Algiers' insistence on a UN-
 supervised popular vote in the territory. Ould
 Daddah's commitment to retaining Mauritania's
 sovereignty over the southern Sahara and his
 heavy military dependence on Morocco,
 however, left him with little choice but to show
 diplomatic solidarity with Rabat.
 Although the formal break will complicate
 future efforts to mediate the Moroccan-Algerian
 dispute, there are other public and private
 channels for direct communications between
 Rabat and Algiers. Moreover, the two countries
 probably will maintain official representation at
 the consular level or an interests sections in a
 third country embassy because there are still
 some 25,000 Algerians in Morocco and more than
 250,000 Moroccans in Algeria.

 ISRAEL: NEW PARTY FORUM
 Top Labor Party leaders moved last week to
 curb the growing dissatisfaction with Prime
 Minister Rabin's party leadership by creating a
 high level consultative forum that includes former
 prime minister Golda Meir. The new forum is in
 part intended to strengthen Rabin's standing
 within the party and to help him prepare for the
 party's national convention, now scheduled for
 October. In the short run, Rabin's active par-
 ticipation in the forum is likely to silence many of
 those who have been sniping at his "autocratic"
 style, but the new body could also prove a liability
 for him if he fails to secure Meir's full support.
 Rabin has come under heavy fire recently
 from party leaders who claim that he has failed to
 consult and coordinate with them adequately on
 broad questions of policy. By bringing the party's
 important power centers together, the new forum
 is intended to dampen this criticism. In addition
 to the party's three principal factions and Meir-a
 power in her own right-the new body includes
 the secretary general of the party and the Labor
 leaders who head the general labor federation
 and the World Zionist Organization. Foreign
 Minister Allon's status has not yet been clarified,
 but it seems probable that, as a leading member
 of the government and a prominent spokesman
 for party moderates, he will participate.
 The new forum has already achieved a
 measure of success in generating greater cohe-
 sion within the party. In response to the group's
 formation,  Meir  Zarmi,  the  party's
 secretary-general, withdrew his recent resigna-
 tion, stating that Rabin had satisfied his main de-
 mand that the party resume its traditional role as a
 partner in the policy-making process.
 For the future, much will depend upon the
 role played by Meir. As still one of the party's
 most respected leaders, she has the stature to
 help re-establish party unity. If she cooperates ac-
 tively with Rabin, the Prime Minister's position as
 party leader will be strengthened, and he could
 hope to secure stronger support for the platform
 he will present at the party's convention.
 Prime Minister Rabin   p
 On the other hand, if Meir is unwilling to
 lend her prestige to Rabin and instead seeks to
 push through her own policies, the Prime
 Minister's position will be further weakened and
 could eventually become untenable. Already,
 some Labor Knesset members have expressed
 their opposition to Meir's inclusion in the new
 forum, protesting that it will only further confuse
 the party leadership problem. They also fear that
 her presence will give the impression that Rabin
 himself has admitted his inability to establish firm
 leadership over the party.
 As presently envisioned, the new forum will
 serve as the party's senior policy-coordinating
 body. It will not have a formal power of decision,
 but will instead submit its recommendations to
 the party's larger leadership bureau. One of the
 group's first tasks reportedly will be to arrange for
 internal party elections to prepare for the party's
 national convention. It is also expected to try to
 hammer out an agreed party position toward the
 illegal settlement attempt near Sebastia on the
 West Bank.

 The elections and the convention represent
 matters of vital importance for Rabin, because
 they will be the first occasions for him to put his
 stamp on the party platform. The convention will
 decide on the party's positions for future peace
 negotiations and various domestic issues in
 preparation for the 1977 national elections.
 The formation of the new group will not
 satisfy all of Rabin's party critics. The party's youth
 faction as well as the backers of ex-ministers Eban
 and Dayan are unrepresented in the new body.
 They will resent their exclusion and will probably
 continue to criticize Rabin. Moreover, Labor
 moderates fear that the participation of such a
 well-known hard liner as Meir will strengthen
 party conservatives opposed to further territorial
 withdrawals, especially in the West Bank, during
 future peace negotiations with the Arabs.
 IRAN: ANTI-CORRUPTION DRIVE
 The Shah's current anti-corruption campaign
 appears to be a serious effort to alter traditional
 business practices. Politically, the campaign is part
 of the Shah's continuing effort to identify the
 palace with reform and with action to ensure a
 more equitable distribution of Iran's wealth.
 The Shah's periodic denunciations of Iranian
 social ills took a more serious turn last fall when
 he launched an anti-profiteering drive that
 resulted in the arrest and fining of hundreds of
 businessmen, including some prominent persons.
 The drive against price-gougers was subsequently
 enshrined as a principle of the "Shah-People
 Revolution," putting  Iran's political and
 economic elite on notice that this was not to be
 the usual perfunctory attack on corruption.
 Late last year, Iran's semi-official press reveal-
 ed that nearly 50 military and civilian officials
 were in custody following investigations into the
 awarding of trade and defense-related contracts.
 Those convicted so far include the chief of Iran's
 navy and 23 other military officers; prison terms
 ranging up to five years have been meted out. Ad-
 ditional important regime figures may yet be im-
 plicated.
 Private Iranian and foreign business firms
 have also been targets. Some have been formally
 charged with defrauding the government and
 black-listed from doing further business in Iran,
 according to reports in Iranian newspapers. Early
 this month, Prime Minister Hoveyda bluntly
 denounced foreign business practices in Iran to a
 visiting group of US business leaders.
 As the campaign continues, the initial focus
 on bribe-taking is gradually giving way to a more
 general theme of misconduct throughout govern-
 ment. The definition of corruption is being infor-
 mally broadened by those implementing the cam-
 paign to include negligence and inertia in the
 bureaucracy.  Investigative  commissions  have
 been set up in government offices in Tehran and
 the provinces. Iran's single political party is also
 involved in the investigations. Much of the activi-
 ty, of course, is posturing by underlings to impress
 the Shah with their vigor in executing his orders.
 Regime critics, ranging from the terrorists to
 the intellectual community, have charged that
 Iran's elite is siphoning off the bulk of the coun-
 try's wealth for personal use, and the Shah is
 wasting it on needless military purchases. The
 Shah's campaign is designed to neutralize the
 issue as much as possible. His tactics closely
 resemble those used in 1963 when he launched
 his program of land and social reform in an effort
 to undermine his critics. At the same time, the
 campaign enables the Shah to reassert his authori-
 ty over an increasingly powerful and in-
 dependent-minded business community and to
 play to the economic interests of the middle and
 lower classes, probably in the hope of forestalling
 increased demands from those quarters for

 SPAIN: GOVERNMENT UNDER PRESSURE
 The violence that flared up in the Basque
 provinces last week appears to have died down,
 and the new Spanish government has weathered
 its most serious challenge to date without altering
 its measured pace of political reform. The
 regional turbulence and labor strife, however,
 will strengthen the hand of ultra rightists who op-
 pose liberalization.
 The trouble was touched off on March 3
 when rioting broke out in the Basque provincial
 capital of Vitoria during a "day of struggle
 organized by clandestine labor organizations to
 dramatize local strikes. The rioting was the most
 serious breakdown of public order since the new
 government took over last December and
 suggests that leftist agitators are improving their
 tactics. The strike that initiated the violence
 reflected a high degree of coordination by
 clandestine  labor  organizations;  the
 demonstrations rapidly escalated into systematic
 violence even though tension was not believed to
 be unduly high. Small extremist groups have
 reportedly infiltrated some local labor groups in
 the Basque area and were probably the main in-
 stigators of the violence.
 Police finally restored order in Vitoria, but
 the confrontation spawned protest demonstra-
 tion and strikes throughout the Basque region.
 The most effective and widespread general strike
 since the Civil War brought economic activity in
 the heavily industrialized Basque provinces to a
 virtual standstill on March 8, when an estimated
 300,000 workers protested the deaths of four
 demonstrators in Vitoria. Economic activity in the
 Basque region is returning to normal, but the
 success of the general strike there will encourage
 leftists who are reportedly planning a national
 general strike for later this month.
 There are already signs that the far right will
 use the breakdown of public order to attack the
 government's cautious reform program.
 Ultra-rightists will particularly seek to blame
 Interior Minister Fraga-the chief architect of the
 program and the man responsible for domestic
 security-in an effort to weaken his position in
 the government. Four of Fraga's' closest
 collaborators told the US embassy in Madrid that
 Fraga would have to pay some kind of "political
 price" for Vitoria.
 In addition to pressure from labor,
 regionalists, and far rightists, the government this
 week faced the first public airing of dissension
 within the military. The controversial court-mar-
 tial of ten military officers accused of belonging to
 the illegal Military Democratic Union lasted only
 two days and ended with most of the defendants
 receiving harsh sentences ranging from two to
 eight years imprisonment and dismissal from the
 service.
 The sentences are likely to provoke dis-
 satisfaction in the armed forces. The Military
 Democratic Union, which is reported to have
 between 300 and 400 members and some 1,000
 sympathizers, advocates political reforms and
 thus represents a threat to the Spanish military's
 long-standing determination to stay out of
 politics. Hard-line military leaders were intent on
 making an example of the ten in order to dis-
 courage any dabbling in politics by younger of-
 ficers who, like the rest of Spanish society, are
 becoming more politically aware. Other senior
 generals argued that harsh measures would only
 serve further to politicize younger officers who
 already resent the die-hard conservatism per-
 vading the upper echelons.
 These problems did not deter the govern-
 ment from taking its first concrete steps toward
 political liberalization in submitting to parliament
 two major pieces of legislation designed to
 legalize political activity by organized groups. The
 first bill would codify the government's more per-
 missive attitude toward political assembly, while
 the second would clear the way for freer forma-
 tion of political associations- arties in all but
 name.                                      25X1

 ITALY: SOCIALISTS SET TERMS
 3
 If the Socialist Party has its way, the party con-
 gress that concluded this week will mark the for-
 mal end of a political era in Italy. In their final
 congress document, the Socialists declared
 "finished and buried" the center-left coalition
 formula-Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social
 Democrats, and Republicans-that has provided
 the basis for most Italian governments put
 together during the last 12 years. Although the
 Socialists did not rule out another coalition with
 the Christian Democratic Party, they made clear
 their determination to insist on terms that would
 end Christian Democratic dominance of the
 alliance.
 The Socialists' strategy is aimed at protecting
 the party's pivotal position in Italian politics and
 ensuring that the Socialists are not relegated to a
 marginal role by the Christian Democrats and
 Communists. In spelling out their strategy, the
 Socialists thus sought to distinguish themselves
 from both the Christian Democrats and the Communists.
 The Socialists drew a distinction between
 their long term objectives and their short term
 tactics. They emphasized, for example, that the
 party's long range goal is a grouping of leftist
 forces, including the Communists, that would
 replace the Christian Democrats as the major
 political force. This is posed as a leftist alternative
 to Communist chief Berlinguer's proposal for an
 eventual governing alliance between the Com-
 munists and the Christian Democrats-the so--
 called "historic compromise."

 Italian Socialist Party congress
 The idea of making a deal with the Christian
 Democrats still troubles more militant lef-
 tists-including some Communists-and Socialist
 leader De Martino probably hopes that his
 strategy will make more sense to them. De Mar-
 tino emphasized, however, that the leftist alter-
 native would not be politically feasible until the
 Socialists have increased their electoral strength
 with respect to the Communists and until the
 latter have severed their remaining ties to
 Moscow.
 For the near term, the Socialists said they
 would be prepared to join another coalition with
 the Christian Democrats, but not before the next
 parliamentary election, now scheduled for May
 1977. They made it clear that they want more in-
 fluence in any new government and they stood by
 their demand for closer relations between the
 government and the Communist opposition.
 De Martino did, however, back away from his
 earlier insistence on a formalized consultative
 relationship between the government and the
 Communists, saying only that the Socialists will
 refuse to join any government "prejudicially
 closed to or conceived as an antithesis to" the
 Communists. While that formulation offers more
 room for compromise with the Christian Demo-
 crats, its effect may be diminished by the ten-
 dency at the Socialist congress to portray a
 new Christian Democratic - Socialist govern-
 ment as a mere stop along the way to a leftist
 coalition.

 Regardless of how the Socialists phrase the
 demand, they are determined to force the Chris-
 tian Democrats to abandon the practice of seek-
 ing behind-the-scenes support from the Com-
 munists in parliament, while professing opposi-
 tion to them publicly. In the Socialist view, this in-
 formal coordination process allows the Com-
 munists to put their stamp on government
 programs while retaining their freedom to
 criticize from the opposition.
 The Socialists believe their own long record
 of participation in Christian Democratic-led
 governments is largely responsible for the fact
 that the Communists' are benefitting more than
 the Socialists from the shift to the left that appears
 to be taking place in the Italian electorate. The
 Socialists see in this the potential for their own
 decline and for the consummation of the alliance
 that Communist leader Berlinguer wants with the
 Christian Democrats.
 The line taken by the Socialists complicates
 the task the Christian Democrats face in trying to
 formulate a strategy at their congress, which
 opens on March 19. The Christian Democrats will
 be troubled in particular by the Socialist decision
 not to enter another government before the next
 election. As a result, the Christian Democrats will
 go into the election bearing the major respon-
 sibility for governing the country and subject to
 criticism from all sides. This may lead many Chris-
 tian Democrats to favor an early election, on the
 assumption that their party would fare better in
 an election held this summer or fall than in one
 held after more than a year at the head of another
 weak and ineffective government.
 The Christian Democrats, moreover, are still
 far from agreement on how to respond to the
 Socialist demand for more open relations with the
 Communists. The Christian Democratic position
 will be influenced heavily by the outcome of a
 leadership struggle now under way between the
 supporters of Christian Democratic chief Zac-
 cagnini, who favors an open "dialogue" with the
 Communist opposition, and the party's center-
 right leaders, who are convinced that such a
 policy would add to the Communists' increasing
 respectability and lead inevitably to broader
 ICELAND: MEDIATION CONTINUES
 Norwegian Foreign Minister Frydenlund is
 continuing behind-the-scenes proposals for a
 compromise settlement in the dispute between
 Iceland and the UK. The Icelandic government
 has not responded to the proposals so far,
 however, and incidents at sea continue between
 Icelandic patrol boats and British naval vessels.
 Frydenlund contacted British and Icelandic
 leaders, including Prime Minister Hallgrimsson,
 last weekend. Hallgrimsson agreed to present to
 his coalition cabinet a proposal that would permit
 20 British trawlers to fish in the disputed area dur-
 ing negotiations. London wants the figure raised
 to 25 and also insists that Iceland "guarantee" not
 to harass the trawlers.
 Hallgrimsson returned to Iceland on Sunday
 from a Nordic Council meeting in Copenhagen,
 but has not formally presented the proposal to his
 cabinet. He may hope the delay will cause the
 British to back down on the number of trawlers.
 Meanwhile, the cabinet has discussed seek-
 ing additional patrol boats from the US. A com-
 mittee to arrange for the purchase of patrol
 vessels has already been turned down by Norway,
 and if the US balks, the committee has threatened
 to go to the Soviet Union for patrol boats that can
 match the speed of the British frigates. An indica-
 tion that Moscow might be cool to such a request
 was provided when the Soviet news agency in
 Reykjavik asked why Iceland approached
 governments for boats, rather than simply
 purchasing them through private channels.
 Foreign Minister Agustsson told journalists
 last week that Iceland would consider withdraw-
 ing from NATO and closing the US-manned base

 at Keflavik if the UK does not withdraw its
 warships. Probably hoping to pressure the US to
 intercede with the British, he said he thought that
 "whatever the outcome of the fishing conflict, the
 agreement on the base will be canceled within a
 certain amount of time." Although Agustsson
 decribed this as his personal view, it contrasts with
 a televised statement last month in which he
 declared the need to keep separate the fishing
 dispute and Iceland's role in NATO.
 In what is seen as a move to embarrass the
 government, the Communist-dominated People's
 Alliance-the major opposition party-in-
 troduced a bill this week that would levy a 25-per-
 cent duty on all British imports. The additional
 revenue would be used to finance the expansion
 of the Icelandic coast guard. The bill is likely to be
 pigeonholed since Iceland would suffer more
 than the UK through such a tariff.
 Meanwhile, the British trawlers continue to
 fish in Iceland's unilaterally declared conservation
 zones, and London reportedly has added a fifth
 frigate to its force in the area. Further incidents,
 such as the one recently in which an Icelandic
 patrol boat forced an emergency breakaway dur-
 ing a refueling operation between British naval
 ships, will probably occur and may eventually
 cause a serious accident that would be almost cer-
 tain to preclude the resumption of negotiations.

 MBFR: WEST WEIGHS SOVIET RESPONSE
 At the force-reduction talks in Vienna, the
 NATO allies have reacted for the most, part
 negatively to the Soviet answer last month to the
 West's nuclear proposal. The Soviet counter-
 proposal contains some new elements but no
 basic departure from past Soviet positions.
 The most prominent new element of the
 Soviet proposal is its apparent acceptance of the
 Western view that force reductions take place in
 stages, with the US and the Soviets reducing first.
 The Soviets have emphasized this feature as a
 response to the West's offer of a one-time
 withdrawal of some US nuclear elements.
 The West has in fact decided that the new
 Soviet "concession" does not amount to much.
 Most importantly, it does not appear to change
 the Soviet desire for sub-ceilings on national
 forces. This feature, when combined with a
 proposa: that the forces not being reduced be
 frozen at their existing levels, preserves what the
 West sees as the two basic Soviet goals in the
 negotiations: to obtain formal Western ac-
 quiescence in Soviet force superiority in Europe,
 and to deny individual West European coun-
 tries-the West Germans in particular-the ability
 to improve their forces.
 Perhaps the most intriguing feature of the
 Soviet offer has been the shift to an equal percen-
 tage formula for determining the size of
 first-stage reductions of US and Soviet manpower.
 The new stress on a percentage formula un-
 derscores the need to agree on a common data
 base for the existing forces in the reduction area.
 The West can now press more aggressively for a
 data exchange, which it feels will demonstrate the
 existing force disparities and help document its
 case for greater reductions on the Eastern side. A
 Soviet decision to exchange data could thus
 signify a serious desire for progress in the
 negotiations.
 The allies have still not taken a definitive
 position on the Eastern proposal as a whole, in
 part because many aspects of the proposal still re-
 main unclear. The deeper problem, however, is
 that there is still little sign of movement by the
 Soviets toward the basic Western demand for
 parity in ground forces. For this reason, some
 allies have suggested that the proposal is intended
 primarily as a tactic designed to counter the
 public effect of the allied proposal and give the

 EC: POSITION ON LAW OF THE SEA
 SECRET
 EC members are showing increasing interest
 in developing a Community position as they
 prepare for the next round of negotiations at the
 UN Law of the Sea Conference that opens in New
 York on March 15.
 Denmark and the UK have been pushing
 hardest for a common policy, arguing that this
 would considerably enhance the Nine's bargain-
 ing power. Other EC members are supporting a
 drive for the EC to sign the treaty as an indepen-
 dent entity, on the grounds that the Community
 could more effectively represent the member
 states in bilateral negotiations, primarily on
 fishery issues, that would follow a Law of the Sea
 treaty.
 The Nine will probably try, at an early stage of
 the talks, to insert a clause in the general articles
 to establish the Community's status in the
 negotiations. Community competence in such
 areas as fishing, pollution, and marine research
 would thus be acknowledged.
 EC members appear to be moving toward a
 common position on the issue of mining the deep
 seabed. The Nine-none of which currently has
 the technology to mine the valuable seabed
 nodules-are united in their desire to prohibit
 unrestricted access to seabed sites by the US, but
 they want to avoid measures that would restrict
 their own access.
 The British had previously pushed the idea of
 quotas to limit the number of seabed sites any
 single country could mine, but they may now be
 modifying this stand. The French continue to
 press for a quota system.
 Fisheries Policy
 Although the Community has made good
 progress toward revising its fisheries policy in an-
 ticipation of a conference agreement to establish
 a 200-mile economic zone, several problems re-
 main.
 The EC Commission presented proposals on
 the fisheries question to the Council earlier this
 week that would:
 ?  Extend the exclusive national fishing
 zones to 12 miles.
 ?  Give the EC competence to
 negotiate member-state fishing rights with
 third countries.
 ?  Create a community system to
 manage fishing within the EC's 200-mile
 zone through the use of catch quotas.
 Quota System
 Catch quotas are needed to prevent EC fish
 stocks from being depleted as community
 fishermen, increasingly shut out of third-country
 waters, are forced to fish the home grounds more
 intensively.
 National quotas would be calculated on the
 basis of past catch figures, losses suffered follow-
 ing the establishment of the economic zones by
 third countries, and gains to Community
 fishermen from the reduction of third-country
 fishing from the "community pond."
 Dublin objects strongly to this formula on the
 grounds that it would hamper efforts to develop
 Ireland's fishing industry. The Danes support the
 Irish, arguing that an EC policy must take the
 members' traditional fishing areas more into con-
 sideration.
 The UK and Ireland are insisting on 25- or
 50-mile national zones rather than 12, and on
 other preferential riparian rights. Other EC states,
 however, have resisted even the proposed 12-
 mile limit, since the Community is already com-
 mitted to equal access for all EC fishermen in
 Community waters. The French, among others,
 want the principle of equal access extended to in-
 clude the 200-mile zone, should this be adopted.

 EC: AGRICULTURAL POLICY
 The EC Council of Agriculture Ministers last
 week worked its way through a long, tough agen-
 da, concluding with the perennially difficult task
 of setting annual support prices for agricultural
 products. The outcome again made clear that
 political considerations dictate the maintenance
 of a high support level and prevent any extensive
 reform to correct the notorious shortcomings of
 the Common Agricultural Policy.
 Although Bonn, as at last year's session, back-
 ed away from a showdown over the horrendous
 costs of the Common Agricultural Policy, parts of
 the agreement-especially the rise in food
 prices-have come under fierce attack by con-
 sumer and other private organizations in Ger-
 many. Paris, for its part, seems generally pleased
 with the outcome, particularly because solutions
 were found to the explosive problems of wine
 and dairy products.
 The council adopted the EC Commission-
 recommended average price increase of 7.5 per-
 cent for the 1976-77 marketing season, as against
 the 10.6 percent called for by the powerful farm
 lobby. Adjustments in the EC's system of units of
 account used for farm prices, however, vary from
 country to country. Italy will have the highest, and
 Germany the lowest, price increases in terms of
 national currencies. The farm support package
 will, as usual, require a large supplementary
 budget, but the costs involved have not yet been
 tallied.
 Seeking to settle the year-old "wine war"
 between France and Italy, which had sparked
 violent demonstrations in France last week and
 resulted in numerous casualties, the Council
 agreed on a hefty increase in price supports for
 Italian wine, a discontinuation of Paris' illegal
 border tax on wine imports from Italy, and a com-
 munity-subsidized storage and distillation
 scheme. While these steps-together with EC
 measures aimed at structural reforms of
 viticulture-have bought time for France to cope
 with the volatile situation, the basic problems of
 the winegrowers have not been solved.
 Despite a strong US demarche and a warning
 that Washington would take the matter to GATT,
 the Council approved a plan to reduce a non-fat
 dry milk stockpile of well over a million tons
 through the compulsory purchase by consumers
 of 400,000 metric tons for use in animal feed. US
 producers expect that this will sharply reduce the
 EC's soybean imports. Skim milk powder allotted
 the food aid program was increased from 55,000
 to 200,000 tons. Commission President Ortoli had
 earlier told the US ambassador to the EC that the
 Commission believes its proposals are consistent
 with GATT rules and that the impact on trade will
 be negligible.
 The Council tasked the Commission to come
 up with a proposal, before fall, for a systemunder
 which producers would assume some financial
 responsibility for structural surpluses. The com-
 mon price system of the Common Agricultural
 Policy was originally envisaged as, a way to
 enhance competition and-through farm moder-
 nization and job retraining-bring about a func-
 tional reorganization of agriculture. Price sup-
 ports have instead led to overproduction and
 massive stockpiling of many agricultural products
 including dairy items-which currently account
 for over 40 percent of the farm fund budget.
 Sporadic attempts to deal with the farm surplus
 and other problems have failed in the face
 of member state protectionism.
 Ireland, for example, will deplore the adverse
 effects of the new grain prices on freer trade in
 farm commodities but bowed to pressure from its
 own farmers. Rome accepts such higher prices in
 order to secure high support levels for its olive oil,
 citrus, and wine. Common Agricultural Policy ad-
 vocates argue that the policy guarantees a sub-
 stantial degree of food self-sufficiency at stable
 prices. The argument sounded more convincing
 when world farm prices were generally above EC
 levels in 1973-74 than now when world market
 vices have di  ed below those in the EC.

 STABILITY REIGNS IN MOSCOW
 Soviet leaders shunned change both within
 their own ranks and in the Central Committee as
 they closed the party congress last week. General
 Secretary Brezhnev's public stature reached a
 new high at the congress, but he will evidently
 continue a consensus type of leadership in con-
 junction with the old guard of senior leaders. The
 congress offered no sign that preparations were
 being made for the succession when Brezhnev
 leaves office. Rejuvenation was not attempted in
 either the Central Committee or the Politburo;
 the average age of its full members is still 66.
 Two candidate members of the Politburo
 were promoted to full membership. The elevation
 of party secretary Ustinov, in charge of the
 defense industry and space, completes the
 representation on the Politburo of officials
 responsible for foreign policy and defense. He
 joins there Foreign Minister Gromyko, Defense
 Minister Grechko, and KGB chairman Andropov.
 The other new full member, Leningrad party chief
 Romanov, represents the country's second largest
 city and is a spokesman for innovation in
 economic organization. Azerbaydzhan party
 chief Aliyev became a candidate member. The
 Caucasus republics had lacked representation
 since Georgian party boss Mzhavanadze was
 dropped in 1972. Agricultural Minister Polyansky,
 who was a full member, was dropped completely,
 a scapegoat for the harvest failures.
 Two new faces were added to the party
 secretariat. Pravda chief editor Zimyanin will
 presumably oversee cultural affairs and the in-
 telligentsia, a post vacant since Petr Demichev was
 demoted to minister of culture in 1974. The other
 new secretary is Konstantin Chernenko, a long-
 time confidant of Brezhnev. As chief of the Cen-
 tral Committee's general department, he has
 been executive secretary to the Politburo.
 The survival rate of Central Committee
 members was over 80 percent-higher than at any
 congress since the 1930s and perhaps the highest
 in the party's history. The number of full members
 was raised to 287, an increase of 46 over the
 number elected at the last congress in 1971. Many
 party officials were promoted from candidate to
 full membership on the Central Committee,
 strengthening the party in relation to the govern-
 ment apparatus and presumably also strengthen-
 ing Brezhnev.
 Most of the full-time party functionaries as
 well as some additional government officials who
 were added to the Central Committee come from
 the Russian Republic. The RSFSR's share of Cen-
 tral Committee members thus increased
 significantly in comparison with that of the other
 republics.
 Several USSR ministers responsible for con-
 sumer-oriented industries moved up to full Cen-
 tral Committee membership despite criticism of
 the consumer sector at the congress. The rising
 importance of oil to the economy is reflected in
 the promotion to full membership of three
 ministers connected with the petroleum industry.
 YUGOSLAVIA: TITO TAKES A TRIP
 During his ten-day visit to three Latin
 American countries, President Tito will be trying
 to enhance Yugoslav influence in the Western
 Hemisphere's nonaligned countries. In Mexico,
 Panama, and Venezuela, he will lobby hard for
 support of Belgrade's efforts to restrain the more

 summer.
 The 83-year-old Yugoslav leader began a
 four-day visit to Mexico on March 10. In a pre-trip
 interview with the Mexican press, Tito lauded
 President Echeverria and stressed the need for in-
 creased nonaligned activity by the Latin American
 countries.
 Tito's talks in Panama, from March 14 to 17,
 will probably be the most delicate of his trip. He is

 CHINA: A CAMPAIGN PRONOUNCEMENT
 Peking's most authoritative statement to date
 on the campaign to criticize Teng Hsiao-ping,
 while linking Mao Tse-tung directly to the effort,
 still reflects differences within the party over how
 far to pursue the current campaign. A People's
 Daily editorial of March 10 quotes Mao on the
 need to "narrow the target" of the attack, imply-
 ing that Teng alone should be criticized, but it
 leaves the door open for criticism of other of-
 ficials who are associated with Teng and who, like
 him, were returned to public office after being
 ousted a decade ago. While the editorial stops
 short of calling for Teng to be overthrown, he is
 separated from other officials who, the editorial
 notes, should be "helped" to correct their past
 mistakes.
 The party's left wing will undoubtedly use
 one of the statements in the editorial, which is
 linked directly to Mao, to broaden the attack to
 include many of the rehabilitees who once again
 hold  important positions. The editorial
 nevertheless calls for people to remain
 "coolheaded" and strictly prohibits the kind of
 disruptive political activity that characterized the
 Cultural Revolution.
 These prohibitions, which are at the heart of
 the editorial, strongly suggest that more
 moderate-leaning members of the leadership still
 retain a major voice in defining the scope of the
 campaign. These leaders almost certainly prefer
 also push Yugoslavia's view that OPEC countries,
 like Venezuela, have an obligation to help im-
 prove economic conditions in the less developed
 countries.

 to limit the attacks to Teng himself and to keep
 the campaign from gaining enough momentum
 to encompass large numbers of rehabilitated of-
 ficials and to undercut major domestic and
 foreign policies. The restrictions may be par-
 ticularly important in view of the greater iden-
 tification of Mao with the leftist cause in general
 and with the attacks on Teng in particular. The
 editorial introduces two new "quotations" from
 the Chairman which tie him closer to the cam-
 paign. But even this new invocation of the Chair-
 man's authority is somewhat ambiguous. The
 editorial states the campaign is being conducted
 under the direction of the "central committee
 headed" by Mao-a power-sharing formulation
 that was conspicuously absent throughout the
 Cultural Revolution and only regularly rein-
 troduced after the Lin Piao incident, when the
 central authorities were unsure of army loyalty
 and Mao was somewhat tarnished by his previous
 relationship with the disgraced defense minister.
 The central authorities also seem to be mak-
 ing other efforts to define the scope of the cam-
 paign. In a briefing for foreign diplomats in Pek-
 ing on March 6, a university official stated that
 Teng is the only target of the current attack and
 implied that he could remain in power if he
 agreed to admit his mistakes. He added, however,
 that Teng had not yet done so. The official refused
 to be drawn out on what Teng's ultimate fate
 would be or on his current status, but the general

 low-key tenor of his comments suggests that Pek-
 ing is making a concerted effort to play down the
 campaign for foreign audiences-and that impor-
 tant elements in the leadership are concerned
 about the possible impact abroad of indications of
 political instability. This briefing is unprecedented
 and represents a major departure from practice
 during previous political campaigns.
 A senior communist official in Hong Kong
 also gave a relaxed explanation of the campaign
 to an American diplomat and suggested that
 those leaders in Peking who oppose the current
 campaign will eventually be heard from. One
 possible indication of this is the recent report that
 wall posters appeared in Canton attacking Chiang
 Ching, Mao's leftist wife.
 Posters  in Shanghai and  in  Kwangtung
 Province are calling for Teng's ouster. One report
 claims central authority for a call to "strike down"
 not only Teng but other, unspecified "reha-
 bilities." Moreover, some reports of the attacks
 on Teng carry the implication that the late Chou
 En-lai is also to blame for his role in returning
 Teng to power. If this line is pursued there is
 likely to be a strong anti-leftist backlash from
 Chou's many former supporters and adherents.
 Equally important, there are signs that civilian
 leftists are courting the military as allies in the
 current campaign. The military was conspicuously
 absent during the campaign's initial stages, but
 some units are now beginning to participate in
 the criticism of Teng. In what seems to be a direct
 appeal to China's powerful regional military com-
 manders in the provinces, wall posters reportedly
 have accused Teng of seeking to undercut the
 authority of these regional commanders by con-
 centrating military power in Peking and more par-
 ticularly in his own hands.
 Military support would give a boost to those
 who are most actively pursuing the current cam-
 paign because at present they do not appear to
 have the muscle to enforce their demands. In the
 Cultural Revolution, support from Lin Piao and
 other central military authorities was crucial to
 the development of the campaign. The support of
 the military is equally as important to those who
 would like to keep the current campaign from
 getting out of hand. It is reasonable to assume
 that civilians on both sides of the issue are trying
 to line up military support, but the military thus
 far has not decisively tilted toward either side.

 JAPAN: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IN CRISIS
 With the Lockheed affair having developed
 crisis proportions in Japan over the past six weeks,
 Prime Minister Miki is now coming under in-
 creasing pressure as Washington prepares to
 transmit pertinent data to Tokyo.
 Immediately at issue is how the government
 handles the evidence. In an effort to dispell any
 notion that a coverup was under way, Miki had
 previously promised full disclosure. Other
 members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
 argued that releasing names in Japan's
 superheated atmosphere without first thoroughly
 investigating the evidence would be tantamount
 to character assassination. Miki subsequently
 modified his stand, and late last week US officials
 proposed that the evidence be disclosed only in
 the context of prosecuting specific individuals.
 As a result, Miki is now under fire from
 members of his own party for having promised
 too much and from the opposition parties and the
 press for failing to fulfill that promise. The opposi-
 tion has used this issue to stall Diet proceedings
 while continuing to press for full disclosure and
 criticizing US restrictions on use of the evidence.
 As a result of the legislative impasse, one
 leading conservative recently suggested that Miki
 might have to dissolve the Diet and hold an early
 election. The opposition will resist an early elec-
 tion because it wants to exploit the Lockheed af-
 fair and believefthat an election this spring would
 tend to end the issue prematurely. For their part,
 conservatives would almost certainly prefer to
 avoid an election in the current atmosphere,
 although an election must be held sometime this
 year.
 Uncertainty about what revelations are in
 store has generated considerable anxiety and fac-
 tional maneuvering in the party. Miki, widely
 considered to be innocent of any wrongdoing,
 views the affair as an opportunity to strengthen
 his own position by cleaning up the party, but he
 operates on a narrow base of personal support,
 faces stronger contenders for his job, and is saddl-
 ed with the responsibility of conducting a convin-
 cing investigation. At times, Deputy Prime
 Minister Fukuda has tended to support Miki since
 a purge would most likely damage his longtime
 rival, former prime minister Tanaka. Asa potential
 prime minister, however, Fukuda may also be
 looking for an opportunity to ease Miki out of of-
 fice. The net result has been an uneasy consensus
 to pursue a "damage-limiting" strategy pending a
 decision in Washington to transfer the available
 evidence.
 The eventual outcome of the current crisis
 hinges largely on the evidence received from the
 US and the manner in which Tokyo handles it.
 Possible developments range from virtually no
 disclosures at all to the implication of a powerful
 faction leader such as Tanaka. In either of these
 cases, the Miki cabinet would be jeopardized. An
 optimum outcome from the government's point
 of view would probably involve the indictment of

 a few relatively minor officials. Alternately, the

 JAPAN-AUSTRALIA: MENDING FENCES
 Japanese-Australian relations seem likely to
 improve, following a relatively abrasive period
 caused by the economic recession and the
 policies of the former Whitlam government.
 Although Tokyo is still cautious, the recent visit by
 Australian Deputy Prime Minister Anthony has
 given Japanese leaders a clear impression that the
 new Fraser government is considerably more
 eager than its predecessor to encourage a
 Japanese economic role in Australia, particularly
 in the development of natural resources. Trade
 problems will remain, but should diminish in in-
 tensity.
 Anthony's trip, the first overseas visit by any
 senior minister in Prime Minister Fraser's cabinet,
 seemed designed to underscore the importance
 the new Australian government attaches to
 relations with Japan-Australia's largest trading
 partner. The Japanese responded with a top-level
 reception. Anthony met with most of Japan's top
 cabinet ministers, including Prime Minister Miki.
 During the Whitlam administration, trade
 and the development of Australian resources
 were contentious issues in relations with Japan.
 Some of the difficulties stemmed from Japan's
 desire for guaranteed access to Australian raw
 materials, and at the same time, a relatively un-
 hindered market for Japanese manufactured
 goods. These objectives have run headlong into
 Australia's traditionally protectionist policies on
 manufactured products and, more recently, have
 conflicted with growing nationalistic sentiment
 against foreign "exploitation" of Australia's
 natural wealth.
 Both sides engaged in discriminatory trade
 practices, partly in an effort to counter
 recessionary pressures. Tokyo caused an uproar in
 1974 by banning imports of Australian beef, clos-
 ing off a major market for Australian producers.
 Last year, some imports were resumed, but not
 nearly enough to satisfy Canberra. Japanese com-
 panies caused additional irritation by asking
 Australian mineral producers to cut back agreed-
 upon shipments because of the downturn in the
 Japanese economy.
 The Japanese, for their part, have been un-
 happy over Canberra's efforts to influence prices
 in contract negotiations between private Japanese
 and Australian companies. Tokyo is also vexed
 over import restrictions imposed by Canberra on
 a wide range of products, particularly
 automobiles. The trade balance is heavily in
 Canberra's favor, which adds to Japanese dis-
 satisfaction.
 Much to the pleasure of Japanese leaders,
 Anthony indicated that the Fraser government is
 committed to private development of
 resources-including uranium, which was off
 limits to foreign participation under Whitlam.
 Anthony also expressed his government's inten-
 tion to try to improve trade relations.
 One Australian embassy official admitted that
 Anthony's  description of Australian-Japanese
 economic interdependence as a source of
 strength, rather than vulnerability, constituted a
 significant evolution  in Canberra's thinking.
 Japanese officials for their part seem generally op-
 timistic about the Fraser government's "pro-
 business" attitude as well as Anthony's frequent
 references to "market prices and forces" in his
 conversations with Japanese leaders. Another
 source of encouragement to Tokyo is Canberra's
 renewed desire to conclude a basic relations trea-
 ty. Talks on a treaty have foundered for several
 years because of differences over economic
 issues.
 There is some concern in Tokyo that the
 Japanese business community will overreact to
 the conservative victory in Australia and fail to
 give due regard to the basic nationalistic under-
 current still running strong in Australia. Insen-
 sitive behavior by Japanese firms in the difficult
 negotiations coming up on raw materials prices,
 for example, could diminish the good will of the
 new Australian government.

 PHILIPPINES: REBELLION IN THE SOUTH
 The Muslim rebellion in the southern Philip-
 pines has intensified after a lull of several months.
 The commander of the Philippine armed forces in
 the southwest, who had been publicly saying that
 the Muslim threat had tapered off, now has his
 troops on full alert.
 The government is capable of keeping this
 resurgence of activity from getting out of hand,
 but is not able to quell completely the Muslims.
 There is no end in sight to the rebellion. The
 Muslim-Christian conflict in the south has existed
 for centuries, and most Filipinos regard bloodsh-
 ed as the normal state of affairs in Mindanao-Sulu.
 The Muslims, who are concentrated on the
 island of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago,
 believe that the Christian majority and govern-
 ment will eventually obliterate Islamic culture and
 society. The continuing encroachment by Chris-
 tian immigrants into traditional Muslim lands,
 Manila's discrimination in providing government
 services, and the Muslims' underrepresentation in
 the armed forces and elsewhere in government
 provide considerable justification for Muslim ap-
 prehensions.
 Although the Moro National Liberation Front
 ostensibly represents all Muslim rebels, the
 Muslims are divided and leaders rarely agree on
 goals or tactics. The Front probably has from 300
 to 500 cadre and 3,000 to 5,000 full-time soldiers or
 support personnel backed by thousands more
 who may from time to time fight government
 forces if ammunition is available.
 The Muslim provinces on western Mindanao
 are plagued by grenade attacks, hijackings, am-
 bushes, kidnapings, incidents between Muslim
 and Christian civilians, as well as some attacks on
 Philippine armed forces units. Most of this
 violence is the result of banditry and quarrels
 between the large local Christian and Muslim
 communities, aggravated by intense clan rivalries.

 *ftol
 The government has stationed four fifths of
 its combat battalions in Muslim areas. The most
 serious combat in recent months has come from
 search and destroy operations, particularly on
 Jolo Island. It is estimated that the Philippine arm-
 ed forces suffered an average of 100 killed in ac-
 tion and 300 wounded each month during 1975.
 Despite this substantial commitment, the troops
 in the south are not strong enough to stamp out
 the Muslim rebellion. The armed forces,
 moreover, are poorly trained, ill equipped, and
 lack discipline.
 President Marcos is aware that major offen-
 sive operations in the past resulted in adverse
 press commentary in Muslim countries.  Too
 much of this kind of publicity could endanger the
 Philippines' supply of Middle Eastern oil.
 With one eye on the international audience,
 Manila has for years been engaged in a well
 publicized on and off again campaign to en-
 courage defections from the badly factionalized
 Muslim movement. Claims that some 10,000
 rebels have surrendered and that the Muslim
 organization has become unraveled appear vastly
 exaggerated. The government has also given sub-
 stantial publicity to its impressive array of
 programs designed to benefit the Muslims.
 Implementation of these programs has been slow,
 and in reality the government has done little to
 deal with Muslim grievances.
 Marcos seems to have no intention of engag-
 ing in any serious negotiations to discuss demands
 for autonomy with Muslim dissident leaders.
 Government representatives, however, from time
 to time engage in "peace talks" in another effort
 to give the impression of movement and
 reasonableness. Marcos, like all other Philippine
 presidents before him, is committed to the con-
 cept of a unitary state and is unwilling to accede
 to Muslim demands for even limited autonomy.
 The Muslim rebels for years have received
 weapons and funds from Libya and elsewhere,
 funneled through the Malaysian state of Sabah. A
 lull in the fighting during the second half of last
 year and the forced resignation of Sabah's chief
 minister Tun Mustapha, who has been the prin-
 cipal foreign backer of the Philippine Muslims,
 raised some hopes in Manila that external support
 was dwindling. Tun Mustapha, however, remains
 a political power in Sabah and is probably still in-
 volved in arranging arms shipments to the
 SOUTH KOREA: PAK'S FOES
 The Pak government has reacted sharply to
 the latest opposition protests in Seoul, but the
 controversy appears unlikely to lead to a serious
 challenge to the authority of President Pak.
 The strongly worded statement critical of the
 Pak regime issued last week by a group of leading
 anti-government  figures-including  Kim
 Tae-chung, Pak's respected opponent in the 1971
 presidential election-was intended to fan
 criticism of the government in the US and Japan
 and spark a renewal of activism among Korean
 students, Christians, and intellectuals. The state-
 ment was timed to coincide with the return of
 students to the campuses for the spring session,
 often a time of political unrest in South Korea.
 So far, the effort is falling well short of this
 goal. Over the past several years, and especially
 since the fall of Indochina last spring, the system
 of legal and extralegal controls established by the
 Pak regime has undermined and enervated its op-
 ponents. The government has moved quickly to
 detain most of those responsible for last week's
 statement, including Kim Tae-chung, and they
 will be prosecuted for plotting the "overthrow of
 the government."
 Although an overreaction by the regime-for
 example a harsh sentence for Kim-is possible,
 Pak's top aides at least seem aware that this could
 prove counterproductive and provide the
 regime's critics the kind of emotional issue they

 VENEZUELA: WORRIED ABOUT GUYANA
 Cuba's intervention in African affairs has
 stirred concern in Caracas over Havana's growing
 influence in Guyana. In recent weeks, the Caracas
 press has given heavy play to allegations that
 Guyana, with Cuban assistance, is engaged in a
 military buildup along its disputed border with
 Venezuela. The reports, which first appeared in
 the influential conservative weekly Resumen,
 claim that upwards of 200 Cubans were serving as
 advisers to Guyanese paramilitary forces
 operating from camps recently established in the
 interior and in the area in dispute.
 The Guyanese ambassador in Caracas public-
 ly denied these reports, and Prime Minister
 Forbes Burnham in a major speech on February 23
 dismissed them as fabrications by "foreign
 hawks" bent on discrediting his country. There is
 no evidence to confirm a Cuban military presence
 in Guyana, but the issue refuses to go away. As a
 result, many influential people in Venezuela, in-
 cluding some leaders of President Perez' gover-
 ning Democratic Action Party, believe the reports
 to be true and are pressuring the government to
 take a hard line with Cuba and Guyana.
 The issue also gave conservative nationalists
 in Venezuela a basis for questioning the wisdom
 of Perez' highly publicized policy of rapproche-
 ment with Cuba and Guyana. These people are
 attempting to revive the clamor for a return of
 Venezuela's "lost territory." They are also seeking
 to discredit domestic leftists. For his part, Perez
 has reacted in low key, in sharp contrast to the
 emotional excesses of some of the local press.
 Nevertheless, he has made quite clear to Havana
 and  Georgetown  his displeasure over
 developments in Angola and Guyana.
 Perez is troubled by Cuba's demonstrated
 capacity and will to mount and support a
 large-scale military force several thousand miles
 from home. Such power could just as easily be
 manifested in the politically unstable Caribbean,
 where Venezuela has major political and
 economic interests. Guyana's willingness to
 provide Cuba with refueling and transit rights for
 its Angola airlift has further accentuated Perez'
 concern that the Cuban presence in Guyana
 could eventually become a major Cuban toehold
 on the continent. Such a development would
 jeopardize the stability of the region, provide a
 source of regional political discord-which Perez'
 policy of Latin American solidarity seeks at all
 costs to avoid-and complicate the handling of
 the delicate border problem with Guyana.
 While the Perez government tries to con-
 vince both Cuba and Guyana of the seriousness
 with which it views recent developments, it is also
 busy improving its military ca abilit
 border area.
 On March 2, in a significant gesture aimed at
 cooling the situation, Guyana's minister of infor-
 mation instructed the government-controlled
 media to play down its heavy coverage of
 Guyana's ties with Cuba, the USSR, and China in
 order to avoid further aggravating relations with
 Venezuela and Brazil. In another move to
 demonstrate that Guyana has nothing to hide, the
 Burnham government has permitted at least one
 US press representative to visit the interior, in-
 cluding the paramilitary national service camps.
 Although the current efforts may take some
 of the steam out of the press campaign being
 waged against Guyana in both Venezuela and
 Brazil, the episode will feed Burnham's obsession
 that his country faces a military threat from its
 neighbors and could drive him to closer relations
 ARGENTINA: ECONOMIC PLAN OPPOSED
 Although top labor leaders have apparently

 walked off the job in Cordoba and Santa Fe, as
 well as in Buenos Aires. Maverick Peronist labor
 boss and Buenos Aires governor Calabro broke
 his recent silence to label the new plan a "fraud"
 that penalizes workers.
 Strong opposition was also voiced by key
 congressmen, including members of Peron's own
 party, and by the nation's most influential
 businessmen's group. Some of the critics claim
 that the reforms were forced on Argentina by ex-
 ternal pressures, emanating principally from the
 International Monetary Fund.
 As a result of worker pressure, the ad-
 ministration agreed at midweek to augment its
 original wage increase significantly. Even the
 20-percent increase subsequently granted,
 however, is not likely to satisfy workers whose
 salaries are ravaged by soaring inflation and who
 are unaccustomed to sacrifice. The prospect is for
 still more pressure from below on the top un-
 ionists and for further striking.
 The administration is hardly in a position to
 stand up to massive strikes. In the final analysis,
 Peron will probably be obliged to grant a further
 wage increase in order to keep the workers in the
 factories. Another failure by the government to
 deliver economic reform could convince the
 militar  still poised to intervene, of the need to
 move.

 BOLIVIA: RENEWED UNREST
 A year of relative political calm has given way
 to a resurgence of anti-government strikes and
 demonstrations by students and miners. President
 Banzer has already begun to retaliate and is likely
 to profit from government allegations of a
 widespread subversive plot.
 The trouble started almost a month ago when
 students in La Paz began to agitate for
 democratization in the university system and to
 demand the release of students detained for
 suspected  subversive  activities.  Street
 demonstrations quickly became pitched battles
 with police, and violence spread to the university
 in the country's second largest city of Cochabam-
 ba. The government responded by closing the un-
 iversities, an action that provoked the powerful
 miners federation, which  represents 30,000
 workers throughout the country, to stage a
 24-hour sympathy strike.
 Earlier, workers at the two largest mines had
 elected Marxist union leaders in open defiance of
 a government ban. Officials of the state mining
 monopoly have asked the government to take im-
 mediate and decisive action to quell disruptive
 forces. Citing work slowdowns and mineral thefts
 as signs of growing rebellion, the officials also
 point out that several radio stations are aiding the
 dissidents  by broadcasting speeches and
 resolutions urging workers to maintain a united
 front against management.
 The interior minister has assured mining of-
 ficials that "severe measures will be taken." Presi-
 dent Banzer has already jailed hundreds of
 protesters and has forced into exile several
 middle-grade officers who have been involved in
 previous conspiracies against him.
 The government now claims to have proof
 that leftist extremists, supported by groups out-
 side the country, are fanning the discontent.
 There are also allegations that foreign
 governments are fostering the current agitation in
 i_  J*.-,---.:- r.4f?rte to
 obtain an access to the sea.
 It makes little difference whether these
 reports are true. Banzer often has manufactured
 evidence in the past to suit his own political ends
 and generally attributes domestic political tur-
 bulence to international conspiracies. He will
 almost certainly use the "evidence" to solidify
 military support behind him and to justify an even
 firmer crackdown on protesters. He can also now
 argue that foreign countries have obstructed his
 attempts to obtain a corridor to the sea and use

 OPEC: IMPORT PRICES DROP
 The prices of OPEC imports, which oil
 producers have used to justify price hikes, have
 declined at an 8-percent annual rate since March
 1975, reversing the trend of the past two years.
 This should make it easier for Saudi Arabia and
 like-minded OPEC countries if they choose to
 resist or restrain a midyear oil price hike when the
 oil ministers meet in Jakarta in late May.
 The dollar prices OPEC countries paid for
 their imports averaged only about 6 percent
 above the previous year-a far cry from the 27
 percent jump in 1974. Whereas OPEC import
 prices had climbed steadily throughout 1974, we
 estimate that they actually declined at an 8-per-
 cent annual rate in April-December 1975. Our es-
 timates are based on export prices of the seven
 major developed countries, which supply more
 than 70 percent of OPEC's merchandise imports.
 Three factors seem to have contributed to the
 downward trend:
 ?  sluggish domestic demand and sub-
 stantial unused capacity apparently induced
 industrial suppliers to cut prices to foreign
 markets;
 ?  wholesale price inflation fell to
 about half the 1974 rate in most industrial
 countries; and
 ?  the dollar appreciated in 1975, mak-
 ing imports from non-US suppliers less ex-
 pensive in dollar terms.
 The total value of OPEC merchandise imports
 increased about 60 percent, to $56 billion, in 1975.
 Most of the growth occurred in the first two
 quarters; the value of these imports declined in
 July-September and just barely recovered to the
 second-quarter level in October-December.
 Prices of OPEC imports supplied by the seven
 major OECD countries at the end of 1975 stood
 about 24 percent above the level that prevailed in
 the third quarter of 1973-just prior to the oil
 price hikes.

 The volume of OPEC imports rose 54 percent
 in 1975, compared with 47 percent in 1974. Most
 of the increase took place in the first six months of
 the year. In the third and fourth quarters of 1975
 the import volume increased at only a 12- to
 13-percent annual rate as administrative and
 transportation, bottlenecks and smaller current
 account surpluses constrained OPEC's spending
 spree. Each of the seven largest importers in
 OPEC approached limits of one type or another
 on foreign purchases during 1975; port capacity
 and sluggish customs procedures impeded im-
 ports in Iran, Nigeria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia;
 Algeria ran a current account deficit; and the sur-
 pluses of Venezuela and Indonesia declined at a
 precipitous rate.

 TRENDS IN THE NATURAL GAS MARKET
 The natural gas market in the major
 developed countries has been shaken by
 wide-ranging changes in the use and production
 of gas. During the past two years, gas export
 prices have climbed rapidly in pursuit of parity
 with oil prices. Nine of the major energy-con-

 suming countries-Canada, Japan, Belgium,.Lux-
 embourg, France, Italy, Netherlands, the UK, and
 West Germany-have increased their use of
 natural gas in the past two years, primarily as a
 substitute for oil, and now account for one fourth
 of non-communist gas consumption. By contrast,
 gas consumption in the US has shown a sharp
 reduction. The US nonetheless still accounts for
 two thirds of non-communist gas production and
 consumption and is the largest single importer,
 being supplied mainly by Canada.
 Trade in natural gas remains small. Only 10
 percent of the gas consumed by non-communist
 countries is imported. Imports for these countries
 in 1975 amounted to about 4 trillion cubic feet or
 the equivalent of 2 million barrels per day of oil.
 The bulk of non-communist international gas
 sales is concentrated in producing regions near
 big markets-that is, shipments from the
 Netherlands to other European countries and
 from Canada to the US.
 The decline in natural gas output in the major
 developed countries accelerated last year, with
 production falling to 27.8 trillion cubic feet, the
 US accounting for most of the decline. Natural gas
 consumption in these countries fell 4 percent to
 27.4 trillion cubic feet, following a slight gain in
 1974. The seven West European countries in-
 creased their gas use despite a slump in total
 energy consumption. Over the past two years,
 Western Europe has replaced the equivalent of
 250,000 barrels per day of oil with gas.
 Natural gas export prices have risen sharply
 but are still substantially lower than for oil. The
 Netherlands and Canada are the largest suppliers,
 providing roughly 50 percent and 25 percent,
 respectively, of total non-communist exports.
 Both countries are planning price increases this
 year to augment earnings, space out production
 from existing fields, and encourage exploration.
 The Netherlands raised its prices 30 percent in
 1974 and 40 percent in 1975. Canadian prices lagg-
 ed until last year when they were raised several
 times. Canadian prices averaged only 54 cents in
 1974, but reached $1.60 per thousand cubic feet
 by the end of 1975. Even at this price, gas sells for
 one fifth less than oil of equivalent energy value.
 In 1976, we expect US output and use of
 natural gas to decline still further, while in
 Western Europe its use will continue to rise
 because it is cleaner burning than oil, supplies are
 ample, and prices are relatively low; the gradual
 economic recovery will add impetus to the rise.
 The expected 10-percent rise in Dutch output
 alone this year will supplant about 150,000 barrels
 per day in oil demand. The expected completion
 of the pipeline in midyear from Ekofisk in the
 Norwegian sector of the North Sea to Emden will
 provide an additional 1 billion cubic feet of gas
 per day to the West German market. In addition,
 West European natural gas imports from North
 Africa and the USSR are expected to continue
 growing, while Japanese liquefied natural gas im-
 ports will probably increase with the completion
 of the Das Island project in Abu Dhabi later this
 year.
 Canadian gas prospects have improved
 because of expanding gas field development
 resulting from higher prices. Large increases in
 supplies are not expected from the Arctic until
 pipelines are completed in the early 1980s. In the
 meantime, additional supplies are likely from an
 increase in drilling of shallow gas deposits in
 Alberta and British Columbia. Canadian output
 and consumption nevertheless are expected to
 rise only slightly this year while the decline in ex-
 ports to the US will continue.
 Natural gas export prices will continue rising
 toward parity with oil. An additional 50-percent
 hike in the Dutch price is likely in 1976. Canadian
 natural gas export prices may rise again later this
 year, perhaps by about 15 cents-to $1.75 per
 thousand cubic feet or $9.84 per barrel of oil
 equivalent, roughly 90 percent of current heavy
 fuel oil prices in the US spot market.
