 China:

 Key Judgments  China's peasant responsibility system, the cornerstone of Deng Xiaoping's

 peasant income directly to production and gives peasants more voice in
 production and marketing decisions. Under the most liberal and popular
 type of responsibility system, the land is divided into what amounts to
 small family farms, with the state receiving part of the production in
 payment for the right to use the land.
 The responsibility system has been the most successful of the leadership's
 reforms-agricultural productivity has increased and so has rural support
 for Deng and his policies. The Chinese press gives the system, most of the
 credit for the bumper harvests of the past five years. We believe, however,
 that a combination of good weather, increased use of fertilizer and
 equipment, and other related reforms, such as a more rational state pricing
 system, probably account for at least as much of the increase.
 Despite strong support among the top leadership, the rural reform program
 has many critics within the bureaucracy. Some have attacked the responsi-
 bility system on ideological grounds, claiming it promotes capitalism and
 weakens collectivism. Others have pointed to more practical problems:
 ? The state's increasing difficulty in maintaining order in rural areas.
 ? The unresolved role of cadre in the new system.
 ? Rising birth rates and lower school enrollment and military recruitment
 as peasants demand more labor for family operations.
 ? The government's inability to plan and control production of certain
 commodities.
 ? Increasing rural inflation and greater income disparities among peasant
 families.
 Despite these problem areas, we believe the responsibility system will
 continue for the near future, albeit with periodic modifications. We believe
 there is consensus within the leadership that rural reforms, whatever their
 ideological faults and practical shortcomings, have played a major role in
 alleviating China's food problem and strengthening peasant support for the
 party. Party leaders probably fear that any sharp shift away from the
 responsibility system risks widespread peasant disaffection and damage to
 critical farmland. Indeed, Beijing has been at pains to reassure peasants
 that their worries about the durability of rural reforms are unfounded.

 Over the long term, we believe that the responsibility system could help
 Beijing further increase agricultural production, but much of the one-time
 gain obtainable from institutional changes has already occurred. Future
 increases in output and productivity will depend upon Beijing's ability to
 encourage private investment, control inflation, and promote the adoption
 of new agricultural technologies.

 China:
 Reforming Agriculture With
 the Responsibility System F
 The Responsibility System
 In late 1978 China's leadership introduced a series of
 pragmatic economic policies that are gradually trans-
 forming the country's entire economy. Agriculture
 has been the testing ground for the most important of
 the reformist policies-linking income to decision-
 making responsibility and labor productivity, known
 generically as the production responsibility system
 (see box).
 Several factors probably led to the new, more prag-
 matic policies. In the mid-1970s food production was
 barely keeping pace with increases in population, and
 leaders acknowledged that 100 million Chinese suf-
 fered from malnutrition. Nearly all the effort in
 agriculture was centered on grain production to the
 detriment of other crops. Production costs had risen,
 and, in the absence of price increases, farm incomes
 had stagnated.
 Reformers recognized that the collective work struc-
 ture failed to reward more diligent labor. The basic
 accounting unit-the production team-consisted of
 20 to 30 families, or more than 100 people, and each
 laborer was awarded workpoints depending on the
 type of work done; the laborer's sex, age, and fitness;
 the number of days worked; and sometimes political
 reliability. At the end of the year, team income was
 distributed according to workpoints earned. This
 meant that a peasant's income was only indirectly
 linked with the actual amount of work done or
 commodities produced. Peasants also had little or no
 voice in the collective's production and marketing
 decisions
 The main thrust of the responsibility system is to
 make peasants more responsible for their own produc-
 tion by increasing their role in decisionmaking and
 linking remuneration to output. It also is intended to
 input levels and marketing incentives., rather than by
 relying on ideological haranguing. The ideologists are
 struggling to reconcile material incentives to Mao's
 brand of socialism. China's 800 million peasants, after
 decades of collective, politically motivated production,
 are having to learn to deal with the new freedom to
 make decisions on investment, cost, and profit. The
 transition is not always easy, as ignorance and skepti-
 cism abound in the countryside.
 Laying the Base
 The new strategy for economic development became
 official in December 1978 during the party's Third
 Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. The
 meeting studied the experiences of teams that had
 transferred production responsibility to smaller ac-
 counting units and individuals, including experiments
 conducted in Sichuan under the direction of Zhao
 Ziyang and in Anhui under Wan Li. The experiments
 resembled the short-lived policies of the early 1960s
 supported by Liu Shaoqi and Chen Yun after the
 Great Leap Forward.
 reduce bureaucratic impediments.
 This simple shift in philosophy has produced profound
 effects. Beijing's economists now approach the basic
 question of how to increase production by considering
 Shortly after the plenum, some rural :reforms were
 implemented. Procurement prices were adjusted up-
 ward for the 1979 harvests, and larger price increases
 were made for above-quota sales, increasing the eco-
 nomic incentive to raise production. Price increases
 were also announced for industrial crops such as
 oilseeds and cotton. These adjustments represented an
 initial attempt to control production with market
 forces, rather than with state-imposed. acreage and
 production quotas. The increase in industrial crop
 prices also reversed Mao's overemphasis on grain
 production and his directives that each area should be
 self-sufficient in grain. Areas were to begin specializ-
 ing in the crops most suited to that particular region,
 the eventual goal being the establishment of stable,
 productive "base areas" for key commodities. F_

 The Chinese generally classify the responsibility sys-
 tem into six forms, although actual contract work-
 ings vary within each category. Of the six forms, the
 most popular are the two based on the household-
 one contracting for land and the other for output. F
 Contracting With Households for Land. This is the
 most popular and widely publicized form. At the
 beginning of 1983 it had been adopted by more than
 70 percent of China's households. Also called house-
 holds assuming full responsibility for task comple-
 tion (baogan daohu), this form divides the collective's
 land, livestock, and farm implements among the
 peasant families. The state retains ownership of the
 land, which is allocated on the basis of the size of the
 household and/or its labor force. The contracting
 parties are the peasant household and the production
 team.
 The land contract to households stipulates the
 amount of product that must be returned to meet the
 production team's state procurement quota and to
 cover any team collective expenses. In addition, the
 households must perform a stipulated amount of
 compulsory labor, usually for capital construction or
 maintenance of irrigation works within the collective.
 The team may still manage irrigation works, large
 tractors, and other expensive inputs. Peasants are
 charged for shortfalls in the products or labor agreed
 upon in the contract, but quotas are lowered in cases
 of natural disasters.
 The most significant feature of this form is that,
 except for land and labor quotas, the peasant makes
 nearly all production and marketing decisions. More-
 over, the collective plays no role in distributing the
 team member's income. A peasant can purchase any
 additional inputs that are available, such as fertilizer
 or a walking tractor. Except for cotton and tobacco,
 he also can dispose of any surplus as he chooses
 including sales through the expanded free market
 system.
 Contracting With Households for Output. This form
 (baochan daohu) varies widely in the degree of collec-
 tive involvement. As under the land contracting
 system, the land is divided among the peasant house-
 holds, but the collective accounting and workpoint
 systems are retained. The work team still makes all
 leadership, planning, and accounting decisions with
 households working independently on assigned plots.
 The households must return a fixed amount of their
 production to meet the team's state procurement
 quota and collective costs. The team retains control
 of any above-quota production and rewards members
 according to workpoints earned.
 Many communes also assign small fields and quotas
 to cadre, barefoot doctors, teachers, and other tradi-
 tionally nonagricultural members of the commune.
 These members must then either farm part-time, hire
 laborers, or pay a penalty for failure to meet the
 assigned quota.
 collective system.
 Under this form, the collective can delegate responsi-
 bility for planting decisions, fertilization, draft
 animals, tractors, irrigation, and other tasks to indi-
 vidual households. Thus, contracting by output be-
 comes similar to contracting land. If the team
 chooses not to delegate, this form resembles the old
 Specialized Contracting. This is a form designed for
 highly collectivized areas wherein a group or individ-
 ual contracts for a specific job such as harvesting or
 driving a tractor, or for specialized subsidiary under-
 takings, such as livestock or poultry raising. Special-
 ized contracting tends to embody highly centralized

 planning, management, and accounting with provision
 for a fixed production quota as well as rewards and
 penalties for production above and below target.
 Short-Term Contracting. Many small or seasonal jobs
 are contracted to laborers, usually for completion within a
 relatively short period of time with remuneration received
 in workpoints. The contract is generally not linked to
 output but stipulates a specific task to be done, such as
 weeding a certain area or cleaning a portion of the
 collective's irrigation canal.
 Contracting With Groups for Output. The team di-
 vides farmland and duties among smaller work
 groups. It also assigns individuals to each group and
 makes most management decisions. The group then
 allocates its workpoints among its members by their
 individual production. If the group exceeds or falls
 short of production quotas, the team will assess
 rewards or penalties to the group as a whole.
 Contracting With Individuals for Output. As in
 contracting output to groups, the team remains the
 basic accounting unit and makes unified management
 decisions. But in this form, the team contracts to
 individual peasants the amount of land, labor, pro-
 duction, workpoints, and inputs. Rewards and penal-
 ties are given to individuals based on their actual
 production.
 These contracts closely resemble contracting with
 households for output. But contracting with individ-
 uals for output specifies a fixed period of labor,
 whereas peasants determine their own level of efforts
 under the household system. The household system
 may also give peasants discretion for planting, using
 draft animals and machinery, and distributing in-
 come, all of which remain under collective control in
 contracting with individuals for output.
 In 1979 Beijing began encouraging collectives to
 adopt the "responsibility system," especially in the
 poorer areas. At about the same time, free markets
 and private plots were expanded. The free markets
 allowed peasants to earn money directly by selling
 either their above-quota production from collective
 land or produce from their private plots. Private plots,
 where peasants could plant and manage what they
 wanted, were to be expanded from roughly 7 to 15
 percent of the commune's cultivated land.
 Responsibility systems initially met fierce resistance
 from officials at all levels. Practical as well as ideolog-
 ical objections were raised by those who saw their
 livelihoods threatened, including local cadre and peas-
 ants who had limited labor, skill, initiative, or capital.
 Beijing countered with a steady stream of directives,
 inspection tours, and press reports citing increased
 production and peasant incomes from the new system.
 By the end of 1979 over 85 percent of the accounting
 units reported they had adopted some form of respon-
 sibility system.
 How the System Works
 Each form of responsibility system is designed to
 increase productivity by increasing the peasant's role
 in production and marketing and by linking his
 income directly to production. Since 1979 when the
 systems were first adopted, Beijing has stressed that
 each area should adopt the form best suited to its
 particular needs and desires. In fact, peasants were
 encouraged to experiment with various forms or to
 invent new ones to meet their needs. Some peasants
 have signed different types of contracts for the pro-
 duction of different commodities.
 As a result, a multiplicity of forms of the responsibil-
 ity system have sprung up, creating confusion both
 among peasants and local cadre. This, coupled with
 the desire of cadre to report the changes that higher
 officials are calling for, casts some suspicion on the

 accuracy of the reports Beijing published on the
 progress of adopting responsibility systems, summa-
 rized in figure 3.
 Despite the questionable accuracy of the reports, it
 appears the system was adopted more rapidly than
 Beijing envisioned. Although the early contracts be-
 tween peasants and the collective retained the work-
 point system and did not link income directly to
 output, peasants demanded the more "liberal" forms
 as news about them spread. Contracts gradually
 included responsibility for planting, fertilizing, and all
 other tasks. They also spread from cropland to include
 sideline industry, forestry, and fishery production. By
 February 1983 Beijing had deflated earlier estimates
 and reported that 92 percent of the nearly 6 million
 production teams had adopted some form of responsi-
 bility system. Contracts with individual farm house-
 holds were being signed within 78 percent of the
 nation's teams
 The System's Performance
 By most measures the responsibility system in agricul-
 ture has been the greatest success of the current
 leadership's reform program. The most obvious meas-
 urable goal was to increase agricultural production.
 Beijing realized that agriculture held the key, not only
 to feeding China's huge population, but also to provid-
 ing the base for the rest of China's economy.
 As table 1 illustrates, China's production of agricul-
 tural commodities has soared under the responsibility
 system. Since 1978 per capita grain output has been
 at the highest level in the country's history. Grain
 production has increased despite the reduction in
 grain acreage caused by more cultivation of industrial
 crops (see table 2). The diversification from grain has
 led to successive record harvests of nearly every major
 industrial crop.
 Although the Chinese press has attributed the unprec-
 edented growth in production to .the increased
 incentives from responsibility systems, other factors
 probably have contributed collectively just as much to
 that growth:
 ? Weather. With few exceptions, weather has been
 unusually favorable over agricultural areas since
 1979, when the reforms were first put into effect.
 ? Price Subsidies. Raising procurement prices before
 the 1979 harvest increased peasant enthusiasm and
 helped diversify production by making industrial
 crops more profitable.
 ? Regionalization. Peasants have been encouraged to
 grow the crops most suited to their area, resulting in
 higher average yields nationwide.
 ? Inputs. Table 3 illustrates that Chinese peasants
 recently have been allocated more inputs to help
 boost production. Although domestic production of
 fertilizer has stagnated in recent years, the world
 glut of fertilizer has allowed increased imports to
 raise fertilizer consumption.

 ? Opening to the West. China's agroscience base has
 been improved by scientific, technical, and educa-
 tional exchanges with the West. Increased foreign
 trade is bringing China machinery, seeds, manage-
 ment techniques, and a host of other benefits that
 increase production.
 Aside from its obvious economic benefits, agricultural
 reform has also paid noteworthy political returns.
 Both Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang have cited the
 "improved situation in the countryside" as among the
 most important of the party's accomplishments in the
 past two years. Both have used the success of the rural
 reforms to stimulate reforms in other areas of the
 economy, government, and even the military.

 Problems Arise
 The adoption of the responsibility system in the
 countryside is still highly controversial. Its contribu-
 tion to better harvests has not prevented it from being
 heavily criticized for both ideological and practical
 reasons.
 Ideological Objections. The obvious success of the
 reforms has muted criticism, but the strength of the
 ideological opposition is evident in the frequency of
 articles and editorials in the party press defending
 responsibility systems. For officials steeped in Maoist
 egalitarianism, the responsibility system bears a great
 resemblance to traditional private farming, or worse,
 to "capitalism in the countryside." Early propaganda
 for the reforms, which encouraged peasants to "be-
 come rich," probably created considerable misunder-
 standing.
 Many lower-level officials still have vague ideological
 reservations about the system and are reluctant to
 implement it. Some leftists owe their career advance-
 ment to past criticism of the very principles now being
 promoted. Other, more cautious cadre remember the
 changing political winds of the past and have been
 unwilling to support a policy line which they believe
 may be short lived.
 Loosening Authority. The most persistent political
 objections, and the greatest long-term threat to the
 system, stem from the general loosening of state
 authority that has come with rural reforms. Peasant
 life under the collective system was highly regiment-
 ed, with the state cadre making many of the daily
 other areas.
 work decisions. But as peasants have been given
 responsibility for production and marketing decisions,
 they have also taken responsibility from the state in
 Beijing has encouraged communes and brigades to
 adopt the new systems to their own unique needs, but
 some have adopted programs that run counter to the
 state constitution. In some cases peasants have under-
 stated production or simply refused to deliver their
 output quotas or pay taxes.
 increases in crime, corruption, and more
 cased peasants going to the black market to obtain
 materials.                           last year
 Fujian Province began establishing police stations at
 many communes and towns because peasants refused
 to obey local cadre. Press reports of a recurrence of
 traditional religious rituals, gambling, and clan activi-
 ties are also growing more numerous
 The weakening of cadre authority may become partic-
 ularly important during natural disasters when peas-
 ants must be organized to provide labor and relief
 supplies. We believe that crop losses from poor weath-
 er may be less severe under the responsibility system
 than under the old collective structure because of the
 extra attention given to fields. But, if problems devel-
 op in providing emergency relief, many early critics of
 the system, who had been forced into silence by its
 success, will renew their attacks.
 Cadre. As production teams are divided into house-
 holds, cadre lose their power to assign work and
 penalties, making it difficult to enforce their orders.
 Local cadre have come to be viewed by the peasants
 as an unproductive drag on their economic activities.
 The prestige and security of the cadre were further
 reduced when Beijing announced campaigns against
 official corruption, incompetence, and ideological im-
 purity-campaigns all directed at lower-level cadre.
 The party press has admitted that morale among rural
 cadre has plummeted. Some cadre have tried to slow
 the implementation of reforms by refusing to distrib-
 ute central documents or by simply ordering that the

 system not be adopted. Others have tried to under-
 mine the system by allowing peasants to divide collec-
 tive resources for their own use, then reporting them
 to higher authorities. Some cadre have manipulated
 the new system to bring maximum benefits to their
 own families and friends
 Beijing's attitude remains ambivalent. On the one
 hand, it has tried to reassure cadre that they are still
 needed under the new system to guide production and
 ideological education and to make sure central plans
 are implemented. On the other hand, it is also clear
 that the party hopes to weed out many of the older,
 less experienced, and left-leaning cadre through the
 current party rectification campaign.
 Birth Rates, Education, and Recruitment. The divi-
 sion of land among households, particularly on the      25X1
 basis of family size (or available labor force), encour-
 ages peasants to have more children. This has caused
 an increase in rural birth rates at a time when Beijing

 is trying to reduce the population growth rate from
 2.1 to 0.95 percent and to keep the population below
 1.2 billion by the year 2000. The responsibility sys-
 tem, with greater rewards for increased production,
 has reinforced the traditional Chinese peasant belief
 that large families are desirable)
 To counter the lack of voluntary family planning,
 Beijing has adopted a mix of incentives and punish-
 ments, some stipulated in contracts with couples of
 childbearing age-called, not surprisingly, the
 planned parenthood responsibility system. Incentives
 for single-child families include cash bonuses and
 improved land allotments. Penalties vary from
 involuntary abortions and sterilization to economic
 sanctions. Although these measures have not been
 successful in lowering rural birth rates, there are
 reports they have increased tensions between peasants
 and cadre. Beijing is augmenting its efforts with
 education campaigns, free contraceptives, and con-
 struction of communal care centers for the elderly
 A related problem has been a growing incidence of
 female infanticide. This past year, selected statistical
 reports in the party press show the percentage of
 (surviving) female children dropping in rural areas, in
 one case to as low as 10 percent of reported births.
 Responding to government policies, some peasants
 have evidently decided that, if they are to have only
 one child, a boy is preferable to assist with the
 farmwork and to provide for the parents during old
 age.
 The increased demand for labor in family fields,
 livestock herds, and sideline industries has also affect-
 ed education and military recruitment. Local press
 reports suggest that many peasant children are being
 pulled out of school permanently to help with family
 farming, some before they graduate from primary
 school. According to Western press accounts, the
 Army, once considered a prestigious career and a
 coveted method of leaving the countryside, has had
 trouble meeting recruitment quotas in some rural
 areas because peasant youth want to stay and help
 with family operations. In 1981 the party had to
 mount an extensive propaganda campaign in the
 military to overcome misunderstandings and dissatis-
 faction over responsibility systems.
 Economic Planning and Control. It has been difficult
 to blend material incentives and peasant initiative
 with the administrative habits of a command econo-
 my. As illustrated by the box outlining problems with

 China's Tobacco Industry: The Best Laid Plans Go
 Up in Smoke
 The 1978 readjustment of procurement prices made
 tobacco production relatively less profitable, and
 peasants consequently reduced the acreage sown to
 tobacco in both 1979 and 1980. The resultant short-
 age of supplies for state-owned cigarette plants was
 further aggravated in 1980 when localities estab-
 lished small-scale cigarette factories and processed
 their own tobacco rather than turning it over to state
 plants. Expensive imports were required to satisfy the
 state plants.
 Tobacco procurement prices were raised in 1981 to
 correct the problem, but this time the prices were set
 too high. Peasants responded by increasing tobacco
 acreage nearly 50 percent and selling roughly 80
 percent more to the state. One press report indicated
 that China may have produced as much as 250,000
 tons more tobacco than needed.
 In early 1982 the State Council, understandably
 wary about adjusting procurement prices again, chose
 to limit cigarette production by ordering all local
 cigarette plants closed in favor of operating the
 larger, more efficient state plants. All cigarette pro-
 duction, procurement of tobacco leaf, and allocation
 of both tobacco and cigarettes were to be carried out
 within the state plan. Although this move reduced the
 demand for tobacco leaf, it did not affect the profit-
 ability of growing tobacco for peasants, who were still
 paid the high state procurement prices. Production in
 1982 rose to 2.2 million tons, surpassing the 1985
 goal of 1.3 million tons.
 Finally in late 1983 the State Council once again
 reasserted total control over the industry by declaring
 a state tobacco monopoly system. Peasants can no
 longer plant or market tobacco without permits and
 licenses showing that their activities are within the
 state plan
 tobacco production, not all of Beijing's efforts have
 been successful, and planners have in some cases
 returned to the more familiar command style of
 managing agricultural resources. In many cases the
 Table 4

 L~.)A I
 policies adopted since late 1978 to increase the pro-
 duction of industrial crops have worked all too well. In
 their enthusiasm for more profitable industrial crops,
 peasants have reduced the acreage sown to grain.
 Some Chinese planners have written that there may
 not be enough grain if bad weather hits. The state has
 maintained strict control over cotton production and      25X1
 marketing and closely monitors grain production.
 Still, peasants often foil collective acreage and pro-
 curement plans by planting their most profitable crops
 on their best land and by giving the lowest quality
 produce to the state while saving the best to market
 themselves.
 Rising inflation in rural areas has been dealt with
 even less effectively. Peasant incomes have risen
 dramatically while acute shortages of consumer goods
 and agricultural inputs exist in rural areas (see
 table 4).
 Readjusting procurement prices (prices the state pays     25X1
 for agricultural products), either to stem inflation or
 to help control the product mix, is not a popular
 alternative. Lowering procurement prices would be
 unpopular with the peasants and would damage
 Beijing's attempts to portray the reform policies as
 longstanding. Raising selected procurement prices to
 control the product mix would draw opposition from     25X1
 leaders who believe that state subsidies for agriculture
 are already a strain on the state budget, accounting
 for roughly one-third of total budget expenditures by
 1981.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/01/20: CIA-RDP84S00928R000200040004-4
 A potentially serious problem arising from the agri-
 cultural responsibility system has been the widening
 gap between rich peasants and the poor peasants and
 cadre. While some communes have always been
 wealthier than others because of their access to
 markets, transportation, or better farmland, reform
 has accentuated income differences within communes
 as well. Although national media have encouraged
 peasants to "become rich" through their own initia-
 tive, local reaction has often been negative or even
 hostile. The press has carried stories of poor peasants
 demanding food and money from wealthier peasants
 or of cadre attempting to destroy moneymaking
 schemes or extort goods or cash from the wealthier
 families. Deng Xiaoping has recently criticized the
 disparity of income in rural areas, according to Em-
 bassy reporting.
 Where the System Has Not Worked. There are some
 areas where responsibility systems, at least in the
 form of household production, provide fewer benefits
 to the peasants than the old collective system. Many
 wealthier communes near large urban centers, for
 example, have large industrial enterprises and few
 members involved in farming. Most of these com-
 munes have found it more profitable not to divide up
 the land, but to continue paying a few peasants to
 manage the farmland.
 On the opposite end of the spectrum, some poor
 isolated communes with limited natural resources
 have little chance to prosper under any system of
 management. These peasants would rather have the
 security of the collective and of ready state relief
 supplies in case of disasters.
 In the wheat-growing areas of the northeast where
 agriculture is heavily mechanized, fields are larger,
 and communes have less labor, peasants and cadre do
 not favor dividing the land into family plots, although
 the majority of teams have adopted some form of
 responsibility system in 1983. Some of the contracts
 cover operation and maintenance of the large imple-
 ments.
 Large-scale agricultural support activities have not
 been done well under responsibility systems. Some
 irrigation projects, for example, fell into disrepair, and
 others were diverted to private use. Beijing responded
 by encouraging individual contracts for the construc-
 tion and maintenance of irrigation and drainage
 facilities. Some contracts are for seasonal work or
 specific tasks as they come up, while other peasants
 and officials sign personal responsibility contracts to
 work full-time managing the facilities. The overall
 problem persists, however, as peasants are unwilling
 to devote time or resources to collective improvement
 projects.
 Land Ownership
 Although the state maintains ownership of the land,
 the changing rights to use land are having a great
 effect on China's agriculture. In the early production
 contracts, peasants were not allowed to buy, sell, rent,
 transfer, or leave uncultivated the land assigned to
 them. To ensure equal distribution of their farmland,
 communes usually divided their collective lands into
 three quality grades, assigning each individual a
 separate plot of each grade. Wasteland, forests, sur-
 face water, and grazing lands could also be divided
 among individuals.
 Land-use rights are becoming controversial as many
 peasants desire to give up cultivation of their land.
 The formation of corporations, agricultural-industri-
 al-commercial cooperatives, and the specialization in
 profitable sideline enterprises are making an increas-
 ing number of peasants contract their land to others,
 hire laborers to work it for them, or simply leave it
 idle. For many cadre, this raises concerns of a reoc-
 currence of pre-1949 abuses, such as absentee land-
 lords and labor exploitation. This summer Beijing
 issued a statement guardedly approving the "rational-
 ization" of land holdings, the right of peasants to
 develop specialization off the land, and the consolida-
 tion of land into more cultivable plots. The idling of
 productive land, however, is still harshly criticized. F
 It remains unclear how far Beijing will let land
 transfer progress. The policy was justified by arguing
 that the practice is already widespread and that the
 system remains socialist because the land ownership is
 not being transferred. But an August 1983 report in
 China Peasant News indicated that the policy could

 Secret
 be carried too far when cadre members in Shanxi
 Province were charged with acting as middlemen for
 such transfers.
 One of the most serious problems relating to land use
 under the responsibility system is its abuse by peas-
 ants who doubt the staying power of reform policies.
 Believing they would have to turn the land back in a
 short time, peasants initially cut forests, used farm-
 land for burial plots and houses, and made little effort
 to maintain or improve farmland. Also, recent indica-
 tions in the Chinese press that individual land allot-
 ments may be redistributed to be more "rational"
 discourage peasant investment. According to the Chi-
 nese press, peasants in some areas of north China
 reduced agricultural inputs and capital improvements
 this year because of rumors that their initial three- or
 four-year contracts would not be renewed. Officials
 there have tried to allay these fears by signing new
 five-year contracts. Some officials in these areas are
 even considering contracts running as long as 10 to 20
 years.
 Policy Prospects
 We expect another record grain harvest this year,
 which augurs well for the continuation, and even
 expansion, of agricultural responsibility systems. We
 believe there is consensus within the leadership that,
 whatever their ideological faults and practical short-
 comings, rural responsibility systems have played a
 major role in alleviating China's food problem and
 expanding peasant support for the party. In our view,
 party leaders also realize that any sharp shift away
 from the new system risks widespread peasant disaf-
 fection and damage to critical farmland.
 In fact, Beijing has already drawn up plans for
 expanding and adjusting the rural responsibility sys-
 tems. A central directive circulated in early 1983
 details the next steps in agricultural reform, some of
 which are already being implemented:
 ? Industry and commerce are to move into rural areas
 in order to diversify rural production, so peasants
 will not have to move to the cities.
 ? Peasants are to expand their capacity for processing
 agricultural produce and earning more private
 income.
 ? The number of families engaging in specialized
 production for marketing should be increased to
 contribute to the development of the market          25X1
 economy.
 ? Communes will continue to be dismantled, area by
 area, and may cease to be a unit for both political
 and economic administration.
 ? Personal employment of hired laborers is to be
 permitted. However, it is not to be encouraged
 officially or publicized.
 ? Peasants are permitted to purchase vehicles for
 transportation, including large tractors and
 automobiles.
 ? Procurement channels other than state agencies
 should be created, and steps are outliined to ensure
 an increased flow of commodities through free
 markets.
 Hindrances to Further Reform. It is not clear, howev-
 er, just how much further the current leadership
 intends to push responsibility systems. Conservative
 party stalwarts are vigorously attacking reforms in       25X1
 other sectors of the economy, in education, and in
 culture on the grounds that party control and prestige
 are diminished. Thus far, the backlash has not hit
 agricultural policy, but we believe it could. Both Deng
 and Hu seem to be carefully distancing themselves
 from negative aspects of rural reform: Deng by
 criticizing resultant income disparities, Hu by prais-
 ing "voluntary" recollectivization in appropriate ar-
 eas.
 In our view, ideological considerations will continue to
 act as a brake on rural reform. Chinese leaders have
 doubtless been upset by Western reporters and busi-
 nessmen claiming that "capitalism" is flourishing in
 the countryside. We believe that the "spiritual pollu-
 tion" campaign-now directed at eradicating certain
 Western influences in China-reflects a heightened
 sensitivity to ideological questions. In such an environ-
 ment, no Chinese leader-not even Deng-can afford
 to be accused of promoting capitalism. Until this
 campaign is concluded, we expect further develop-
 ment of rural reform to be slow.

 Criticism of responsibility systems will remain muted
 as long as production continues to increase. The
 system could help boost agricultural growth above the
 historical average, but several economic problems
 must be solved first. The biggest factor determining
 future production levels is investment in agriculture;
 many of the one-time gains from labor reorganization
 probably already have occurred. Chinese leaders have
 said publicly that they intend to concentrate state
 expenditures for agriculture on large-scale projects,
 such as irrigation canals, rather than on small-scale
 inputs such as tractors and fertilizer. Peasant invest-
 ment is increasing, but the state will have to increase
 the fertilizer and equipment available for purchase,
 stabilize land allotments, and promote the stability of
 the new policies. In our view, further retreats toward a
 planned economy, such as occurred in the tobacco
 industry, will erode peasant confidence.
 Rural inflation remains a serious problem, but Beijing
 has apparently not designed an effective strategy to
 address it. For example, two major conferences this
 fall came up with different solutions. A forum of
 Agricultural Bank managers agreed to lower the
 amount of money in circulation by reducing loans to
 farmers. The other conference on rural commercial
 credit decided to make more funds available so peas-
 ants would produce more foodstuffs and increase the
 flow of raw materials to urban industries
 The dissemination of science and technology to the
 countryside must also be improved for agriculture to
 continue to progress. Responsibility contracts for sci-
 ence and technology have been proposed in an attempt
 to disseminate information more widely, but we be-
 lieve they will prove unsuccessful on a nationwide
 basis. Chinese officials are studying the US federal
 and state extension system, but, if copied, it will take
 time and great expense for Chinese scientists to gain
 the necessary credibility with most peasants.
