WEST GERMANY: TAX CUTS TO LIFT ECONOMY 
Pursuant to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's commitment at the Bonn Summit, the 
West German Cabinet on 28 July approved a $5.6 billion stimulation package for 1979 
(the equivalent of slightly less than 1 percent of GNP) and an additional stimulus of 
$1.6 billion for 1980. Hammered out during a three-day marathon Cabinet session, the 
package represents an uneasy compromise within the governing coalition ?between 
(a) Social Democratic Party (SPD) demands for tax cuts and increased family 
allowances benefiting primarily low and lower-middle income groups and (b) Free 
Democratic Party (FDP) preferences for tax relief and investment incentives for 
business. Gross tax reductions and expenditure increases exceed the amounts stated 
above, but the government intends to offset some of the budget impact through 
a 1 percentage point increase in the value-added tax (VAT) effective 1 July 1979. A 
simulation using our West German econometric model suggests that Schmidt's 
program could raise next year's GNP growth rate by nearly 1.5 percentage points, to as 
much as 4.5 percent. 
Details of the Program 
The heart of the 1979 package is a $5.5 billion cut in personal income taxes?part 
of a basic reform of the income tax structure supported in principle by all political 
parties. The major reform element is substitution of gradually progressive rates for a 
system that has combined a flat 22-percent rate on the first $8,000 of taxable income 
for single persons ($16,000 for married couples) with steeply progressive rates, starting 
at 30.8 percent, on higher earnings. In addition, the reform raises the basic tax 
exemption from $1,650 to $1,845 for single persons and from $3,300 to $3,690 for 
married couples. Depending on their respective tax brackets, annual tax savings for 
individuals and married couples would range from $45 and $90 to $450 and $900. 
Other measures in the 1979 package include: 
? $1 billion for family allowances, primarily increased maternity benefits 
and higher child support payments for families with three or more children. 
? $450 million for investment incentives and research in advanced technol-
ogy industries.

For 1980 the government proposes: 
? A further $1.6 billion reduction in income taxes through an increase in 
deductions for self-employed persons. 
? A $1.4 billion reduction in business taxes through abolition of a much 
criticized tax on wage bills and an increase in exemption from the levy on 
enterprise capital. 
? $850 million in additional outlays to increase support payments for a 
second child and finance a reduction in the voluntary retirement age of 
disabled persons. 
The 1 percentage point increase in the VAT on 1 July 1979 is expected to offset 
revenue losses by $1.25 billion in 1979 and an additional $2.25 billion in 1980. 
Expected Impact 
For both economic and political reasons, Schmidt opted for a tax cut package 
even though it normally carries a smaller short-run stimulative impact than an 
equivalent public spending program; the respective multipliers for West Germany are 
1.4 and 1.8. A reform of the tax structure was long overdue and is widely supported, if 
for divergent reasons, by all political parties and interest groups. Schmidt obviously 
hopes tax cuts will generate political gains for his government in upcoming state and 
parliamentary elections. The benefits from public works spending, though normally 
larger than gains from equal tax cuts, are less obvious to most voters. Moreover, the 
government probably could not implement a like-sized public works program under 
present circumstances. Spending on public works initially affects the construction 
sector, the one sector of the German economy that is currently bumping against 
capacity. 
To measure the likely impact of the proposed stimulation package, we ran a 
simulation on our quarterly econometric model of the West German economy. The 
program has its strongest and most immediate effect on private consumption and 
residential housing, because nearly all of the measures effective 1 January 1979 are 
specifically designed to increase disposable household incomes. The impact on 
consumption nevertheless is not as large as would be expected in the United States 
because of (a) significant leakages abroad as shown in the sizable response of imports 
of goods and services; and (b) a much higher marginal savings rate.

Increased consumer spending triggers a rise in business investment by mid-1979; 
the higher investment level is maintained through mid-1980, helped by the reduction 
in business taxes scheduled for the beginning of that year. The program's effect wears 
off during 1980 under the influence of the VAT increase and an acceleration of 
inflation reflecting capacity contraints and shortages of skilled labor. 
Our model simulation indicates that this stimulation package raises real GNP 
growth in 1979 to as high as 4.5 percent, compared with little more than 3 percent in 
the absence of government action. The speedup in growth reduces unemployment to 
4.3 percent of wage and salary workers (from 4.5 percent in 1978), or roughly 3.5 
percent of the labor force (3.7 percent in 1978). The inflation rate is only slightly 
higher in 1979 than it otherwise would be but accelerates by an additional 0.5 
percentage point in 1980. Although the feedback from increased imports induces a rise 
in exports, the current account surplus in the simulation is $2.4 billion less in 1979 and 
$4.4 billion less in 1980 than in the base case. No allowance has been made, however, 
for further shifts in deutsche mark parities.

Package Likely To Be Changed 
Although approved by the Cabinet, Schmidt's stimulation package will encounter 
tough sledding both in the Bundestag (the lower house, where the governing coalition 
holds a thin majority) and in the Bundesrat (the upper house, which is controlled by 
the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union opposition). The opposition 
parties, while supporting tax reform, seek a better break for middle and upper income 
groups and especially more tax relief for business, a view shared by many in the FDP, 
the junior coalition party. FDP agreement to the package in the Cabinet presumably 
was motivated in part by a desire to avoid intracoalition squabbles, especially prior to 
the crucial October state elections in Hesse. FDP leaders can expect the CDU/CSU to 
insist on changes in the stimulation package more in line with their own preferences as 
the price for Bundesrat consent. Such changes, in turn, would arouse the bitter 
opposition of SPD left-wingers, whose support for even the present proposals is shaky. 
While the ultimate shape of the stimulation package is uncertain, experience with last 
year's program suggests that some combination of tax cuts arid spending increases will 
be enacted and that parliamentary logrolling will more likely increase than reduce its 
25X1 size. 
SPAIN AND THE EC: EXTENDING EUROPE PAST THE PYRENEES 
Spain, having moved nimbly in the post-Franco era to fulfill the political 
conditions for membership in the European Community, now must address the task of 
opening its highly protected economy to European competition. Long-run gains from 
increased trade, free movement of resources, and more intense competition will 
outweigh the losses suffered by less efficient Spanish producers. Madrid's application 
for EC membership enjoys widespread popular support within Spain. On the 
Community side, admission of Spain is considered a political necessity. Nevertheless, 
the economic issues complicating EC enlargement?especially questions concerning 
agriculture and labor mobility?will lead to protracted negotiations, and integration of 
the Spanish economy into the Community will require a lengthy transition period. 
State of Play 
Spain applied for EC membership on 28 July 1977?two years after Greece and 
four months after Portugal. Madrid recently turned in lengthy questionnaires required 
by the Community and expects a ruling or opinion on membership from the EC 
Commisssion by the end of the year. After a favorable ruling is obtained, formal

SECRET 
negotiations will take about two years. Ratification will require another one to two 
years, making membership possible by 1982 or 1983. EC leaders favor a further five-
to 10-year transition or adjustment period for integrating the Spanish economy into 
the Community. Madrid is agreeable to a long economic transition provided Spain is 
accorded full political rights from the start. 
Under a 1970 trade agreement, Spanish exports of most agricultural products and 
many industrial items already enjoy preferential access to the European Community. 
Negotiations for a renewal of this agreement began in February and are proving 
difficult. Madrid wants greater concessions, including preferences at least as favorable 
as those granted Mediterranean Arab countries and Israel for citrus fruit and other 
food exports. The Community seeks a substantial reduction of Spanish industrial 
tariffs. These negotiations are important as a harbinger of the likely course of accession 
negotiations. 
Spain has had close economic ties with the EC since the Community was 
established. Currently, the Nine provide more than one-third of Spanish imports?pri-
marily machinery, basic manufactures, and chemicals. EC countries take nearly one-
half of Spanish exports, notably citrus fruits and vegetables, steel and other basic 
manufactures, and transport equipment. Spain's main trade partners in the Communi-
ty are France, West Germany, and the United Kingdom. Spain-EC trade turnover was 
almost $11 billion last year, a large amount for Spain but only 1 to 2 percent of the EC 
total. Spain chronically runs a deficit in trade with the Community?$1.4 billion in 
1977. 
Hurdles To Be Cleared 
Spain, along with Greece and Portugal, faces serious obstacles to EC acceptance, 
but the Community has committed itself to take in all three countries provided they 
maintain representative forms of government. While Spain's greater size appears to 
make obstacles to its membership more difficult than those confronting the other 
applicants, the three cases are closely linked. The Community can hardly deny a 
concession to Spain that it has granted one of the smaller countries. 
Agriculture presents the most difficult hurdle for Spanish accession. The problem 
is that 75 percent of Spain's agricultural production is Mediterranean?wine, fruits 
and vegetables, olive oil, and tobacco. These same crops are the major agricultural 
products of the poor regions of southern France and Italy and are already in surplus in 
the Community. In addition, Spanish prices are as much as 60 percent below present 
EC levels.

Spain argues that membership will boost its imports from the Community of 
cereals, butter, and sugar, but this is little consolation for the farmers of southern 
France and still less for the Italians. Wine is particularly troublesome. France and 
Italy already have engaged in one wine war. Spanish wine prices are even lower than 
Italian, and Spain has more acreage devoted to vineyards than either Italy or France. 
France is insisting on special aids for its Mediterranean farmers to protect them from 
losses due to enlargement. Italy opposes many of these special aids for France because 
they could jeopardize Italian food exports to France. Negotiators have not yet come to 
grips with this thorny issue. The solution undoubtedly will entail a special system of 
levies and subsidies to compensate for differences in farm prices; this system would be 
phased out gradually as were the systems adopted after the Community was expanded 
to include the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Ireland. Spanish farmers ultimately 
would gain from membership through expanded exports and higher prices. 
Free movement of labor, a central principle of the European Community, poses 
another serious obstacle to EC expansion. West Germany, France, and the Benelux 
countries fear an influx of Greeks, Portuguese, and Spaniards that would swamp labor 
markets and social insurance systems. About 500,000 Spaniards already work in the 
Community and are accompanied by as many dependents. One-half of Spain's 
emigrant workers are in France. At present, Spaniards make up about 7 percent of 
foreign workers in the EC countries; Greeks, Portuguese, and Spaniards together 
account for about 20 percent. The accession problem is complicated by an outstanding 
EC commitment to allow free entry of Turkish labor by 1986. West Germany in 
particular probably will insist that restrictions be continued on workers from the 
acceding countries for some time. Spain will resist because the return of workers from 
the north since the 1974-75 recession and the slowdown in emigration have added an 
estimated 5 percent to a Spanish labor force already suffering from high 
unemployment. 
The Industrial Dilemma 
Spanish industrialists are apprehensive about their ability to compete in the 
European Community even though Spain, unlike Portugal and Greece, is something of 
an industrial power. For years, Spanish industry has been protected by high tariffs, 
quotas on many imports, cheap credit, and government subsidies and tax rebates. This 
protection has nurtured structural distortions such as an excessive number of small-
scale firms, inadequate research and development programs, and an inefficient 
distribution system. The increased competition and larger market should promote 
expansion and efficiency. Firms that fail to become more efficient of course will be 
hurt or eliminated by EC competition. Household appliance manufacturers and the 
paper products industry look particularly vulnerable.

The elimination of industrial trade barriers will be a boon for some Spanish firms 
that already are competitive with EC producers. Industries with good prospects for 
expansion include manufacturers of machine tools, typewriters, batteries, and auto-
mobiles. The Ford Motor Company subsidiary recently became Spain's largest single 
exporter. 
On the other hand, a number of competitive industries?iron and steel, textiles, 
footwear, and shipbuilding?are unlikely to see sales to the EC Nine mushroom 
because markets for their products are glutted. In steel, demand is slumping 
worldwide, leaving both Spain and the Nine with excess capacity. The Community has 
imposed severe restrictions on steel imports. Spain has reluctantly agreed to accept a 
quota of 900,000 tons per year, 9 percent below its 1976 sales to the Community. 
Restraints have been imposed on intra-Community steel trade, and EC producers are 
supposed to reduce capacity over the next few years. 
One of Spain's major competitive advantages vis-a-vis EC producers is lower 
wages?about 50 percent lower than French or West German pay. The opening to the 
EC market to Spanish industrial products should attract firms hoping to take 
advantage of the wage differential to produce in Spain for sale in the Nine. Inflation 
and wage increases in Spain, however, have far exceeded the EC average over the past 
three years and will continue to erode Spain's competitive advantage for at least the 
next few years. The legalization of trade unions in 1977 is not having a dramatic effect 
on Spanish wage rates. Wage increases, though still rapid, are limited by an austerity 
pact agreed to by the unions last year. 
Other Considerations 
The 1977 extension of EC territorial waters to 200 miles in the Atlantic was a 
severe blow to Spanish fishing. Spain retaliated in 1978 to protect this important 
industry by extending its own territorial waters to 200 miles. Madrid is especially 
concerned because the fishing fleets are based in areas already suffering from the 
slump in shipbuilding. The Community has granted fishing licenses to Spain pending 
negotiation of a fishing agreement, but these licenses are adequate to keep only about 
20 percent of Spain's northern fishing fleet active. Some Spanish vessels have been 
seized by France and Britain for fishing without licenses. No progress on a new 
arrangement is expected until EC members can agree among themselves on a common 
fishing policy.

Once it becomes a member, Spain will receive more money than it pays into EC 
coffers for many years?around $300 million the first year. While more funds can 
only help, they will not amount to much in the $100 billion Spanish economy. EC 
lenders like the Regional Fund, the European Social Fund, and the Agricultural 
Guidance Fund are too small at present to have much impact on Spain. 
The so-called gap between the rich EC Nine and the less affluent applicants is a 
nonissue in the Spanish case. Per capita income exceeds Ireland's and falls only slightly 
below Italy's. Moreover, Greece and Portugal, which are indeed quite poor, probably 
will be EC members by the time Spain can join. Spain ranks eighth in the 24-member 
OECD in GNP, ninth in steel production, and twelfth in energy production. 
Bullish Outlook 
Spain stands to reap substantial long-term economic gains through accession to 
the European Community. Spanish leaders are optimistic about membership but 
aware of the threat of near-term economic dislocations. Madrid will have to modify its 
legislation on competition, state monopolies, labor, patents, trademarks, and insurance. 
Bills already in parliament are designed to bring the Spanish tax system more in line 
with the Community norm. Reform of banking and investment policy, formerly 
characterized by highly monopolistic practices and pervasive government interven-
tion, is well along. Madrid will need to find ways to smooth the transfer of labor and 
capital from firms and farms that cannot stand the blast of EC competition to 
enterprises than can thrive in the expanded market. The tough issues centering on 
labor and agriculture will riot block Spanish entry but will require protracted 
negotiation and lengthy periods of adjustment. In the accession process, EC agricultur-
al policy, already baroque, will be broadened and made still more complex.

PAKISTAN: ENCOURAGING BUT UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC REBOUND 
In the 12 months since the ouster of Prime Minister Bhutto and the establishment 
of martial law, the military government of General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq has 
benefited from a bumper cotton crop and a big jump in remittances from overseas 
Pakistanis. Real GNP in the fiscal year ending 30 June 1978 was up an estimated 6 
percent. Preoccupied with restoring domestic political stability, Islamabad has for the 
most part avoided major economic initiatives. Specifically, the government has not 
faced up to the basic problems of dealing with Pakistan's sizable foreign debt or of 
weeding out overambitious capital-intensive development projects. 
A Perspective on the Bhutto Years 
Pakistan's economy performed poorly under the Bhutto regime (December 1971-
July 1977) when real growth averaged 3.6 percent annually, only slightly higher than 
the 3.1-percent population growth rate. Apart from external shocks to the economy 
over which the regime had no control, economic development was hampered by 
improvident government policies. Bhutto's development strategy focused on invest-
ment in a small number of high-cost, slow maturing projects, which in toto greatly 
exceeded available domestic resources. Thus, the government relied heavily on foreign 
borrowing both to cover chronic trade deficits and to support development programs. 
When the July 1977 coup occurred, external public debt had reached $6.6 billion. 
saddling the government with a debt service ratio of 18 percent. 
Political disturbances during the four months preceding the coup helped bring on 
a sharp deterioration in the economy. Labor disturbances periodically shut down large 
segments of industry; transportation links between the port of Karachi and the rest of 
the country were intermittently disrupted, thus slowing the movement of both exports 
and imports. Shortages of key commodities and production losses, together with 
excessive pay raises given to civil servants, undercut efforts to reduce inflation from 
the 20-percent-plus level in 1975 and 1976. 
The Postcoup Environment 
Caution in economic matters has been the byword of the Zia government, largely 
reflecting the role economic issues played in Bhutto's overthrow. General Zia and his 
military colleagues have retained the civilian economic bureaucracy inherited from 
the Bhutto era and the top leaders of key economic organs?the Planning and Foreign 
Economic Affairs Division of the Prime Minister's Secretariat, the Ministeries of 
Finance and Planning, and the State Bank of Pakistan. All are well-trained and

competent economic managers. Although little information is available on the 
relationship between Zia and these economic chiefs, we believe that Zia is relying on 
them for policy guidance. 
So far the new government has confined its actions largely to repairing the 
damage done under Bhutto. To stimulate agricultural production, it has denational-
ized agricultural industries?flour and rice milling and cotton ginning?and has raised 
procurement prices for rice. Denationalization has also raised hopes that cotton and 
rice exports, now in government hands, will be returned to private operation with a 
consequent increase in exports. The signing of joint oil exploration agreements 
between the government and several foreign oil companies also suggests a new 
willingness to enlarge the sphere of operation for both foreign and domestic business 
firms. 
As for long-term planning, the government has prepared a new five-year plan 
that focuses on development of infrastructure, improvement of agricultural productiv-
ity, and greater involvement of the private sector. Although details of the plan remain

sketchy, Islamabad apparently intends to go ahead with several of the major projects 
inherited from the Bhutto regime. Some Pakistani planners and the World Bank?
which plays a leading role in the consortium of Western aid donors to Pakistan?favor 
postponement or cancellation of these large capital-intensive projects and a concentra-
tion of resources on agricultural development. 
Among the prime examples of these economically questionable projects are the 
nuclear reprocessing plant and a $1.5 billion steel mill. Similarly, the $650 million 
Chashma nuclear power plant, still in the planning stages, will eventually produce 
electricty at a higher cost per unit than would hydroelectric or gas-fueled power 
plants. 
Current Trends 
At present the government is not under great pressure to move rapidly in 
economic matters. It ended its first year in power with inflation and balance-of-
payments problems fairly well under control, although both are still matters of 
concern. Aided by a rebound in overall agricultural production and the restoration of 
normal supply and distribution channels for consumer goods, inflation in FY 1978 was 
held to about 10 percent. On the minus side, a 10-percent decline in wheat production 
is forcing the government to import about 1.5 million tons in FY 1979. The shortfall 
largely reflects the government's failure to raise wheat procurement prices, which 
encouraged farmers to shift acreage into other crops. Although industrial production 
recovered moderately in FY 1978, it is still running only slightly above the level of FY 
1974. 
Balance-of-payments problems have been eased by the sharp rise in remittances 
from about 1 million Pakistanis working overseas, mainly in the Persian Gulf states. 
The inflow, an estimated $1 billion in FY 1978, helped slash the current account 
deficit by one-third and allow ed a $230 million drop in financing requirements; with 
the remaining requirements more than covered by official project and nonproject aid, 
foreign exchange reserves increased by $240 million, to $660 million at the end of 
June. 
Immediate Prospects 
Despite this encouraging comeback, economic recovery remains fragile. An 
uncertain investment climate persists as private businessmen wait to see Zia's plans to 
return the government to civilian rule. Over the past 12 months, he has on several

occasions announced plans to hold national elections but has failed to come through. 
The private sector is also waiting for more precise government statements on its future 
role in the economy. 
In this environment, economic performance in FY 1979 will depend primarily on 
the agricultural sector and specifically on weather conditions. Another bumper cotton 
crop would provide a stimulus to the textile industry and to cotton exports. Although 
Islamabad is trying to arrange for necessary wheat imports on concessionary terms, a 
$55 million hike in the wheat import bill is in prospect at the moment. 
The massive external debt should remain manageable. A four-year debt resched-
uling agreement expired on 30 June 1978, and the government now faces a $235 
million increase in debt servicing in the new fiscal year. Islamabad has argued that it 
cannot meet this added burden and has requested the World Bank, which chairs the 
group of major creditors, for a new rescheduling agreement. Led by the United States, 
which holds about 35 percent of Pakistan's total debt, the major creditors have 
deferred a decision until December 1978. They take the view that the need for 
rescheduling cannot be assessed until the government reveals more details of its new 
long-term development program and outlines the direction of the economy. 
In any case, a balance-of-payments crisis and a default in external debt payments 
do not appear in the offing. Some further rise in workers remittances?though 
nowhere near last year's extraordinary 85-percent increase?plus the buildup of 
foreign exchange reserves and the anticipated inflows of official project and nonproj-
ect assistance should allow the government sufficient manueverability in handling its 
25X1 external accounts.

CHINA: INTEGRATION OF CIVILIAN AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES * 
Chairman Hua Kuo-feng appears to have instituted a policy requiring Chinese 
defense industries to contribute more to the civilian economy. Conceivably, this would 
involve greater sharing of China's scarcest resources?scientists and technicians, 
precision machinery and instruments, and imported high-quality materials?with the 
producers of basic industrial equipment. 
Hua, in his report to the Fifth National People's Congress last February, called 
for greater integration of military and civilian enterprises. The speech itself, however, 
did not provide any specifics on how this integration was to be accomplished. Hua did 
indicate that such coordination of production would reduce the need for investment 
capital, an urgent measure in view of the ambitious construction goals set forth in the 
current 10-year (1976-85) plan. 
Promoting the Policy 
Two PRC press accounts published since Hua's speech provide some additional 
insight into the new policy. The first report, published one month after the Congress, 
described the efforts of an institute in the Second Ministry of Machine Building to 
promote the civilian uses of nuclear energy. It is a straightforward account of how the 
institute, for the last several years, has encouraged greater use of nuclear energy 
technology in the civilian economy. No reference, however, is made in the account to 
Hua's speech or the integration policy which he proposed. 
The second article, published a month after the first, discusses the support given 
in recent years to civilian R&D projects by a defense research institute engaged in the 
development of electronic circuits for the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building?the 
ministry responsible for missile development. The article refers directly to the 
integration policy and is more informative than the first regarding the relationship 
between defense and civilian enterprises. 
As part of its cooperative efforts, the institute reportedly participates in the 
selection of civilian R&D projects to be undertaken and consequently is able to 
influence the focus and the progress of civilian R&D in areas vital to military research. 
It is by this means, according to the article, that the institute uses civilian industry to 
promote military industry. The article also states that civilian use of the products

developed in those projects shortens the development period for military products. 
The institute first puts prototype electronic products to use in civilian applications and 
then improves them over time to meet the generally more stringent military 
specifications. 
The emphasis on benefits accruing to the defense institute because of its 
cooperative relationship with the civilian sector is possibly designed to persuade 
reluctant elements in the defense establishment to comply with the new policy. 
Shakeup in the Defense Industries 
Since last fall all but one of the seven heads of the defense-related machine 
building ministries have been replaced. Four of the new appointees are civilian 
replacements for men associated primarily with the People's Liberation Army. The 
only career military officer retaining his position is Wang Cheng, head of the ministry 
controlling electronics production. While the reshuffle fits with the erosion of military 
influence in government affairs that has been occurring since the end of the Cultural 
Revolution, other factors may also be at work. Some of the ministers who lost their 
portfolios may have had ties with the disgraced -Gang of Four," or they may have 
been critical of the subordination of some military ventures to the newly emphasized 
goal of rapid economic modernization, of which the proposed integration is a part.

Implications 
The defense sector has long had a priority claim on scientists and technicians, 
precision machinery and instruments, and imported high-quality materials. Hua 
seems to be calling for greater sharing of these resources with producers of basic 
industrial equipment than at any time in the past. A large-scale diversion of resources 
probably would be resisted by sectors of China's military bureaucracy. 
These developments do not necessarily imply a reduction in defense spending. It 
seems likely, however, that attempts will be made to eliminate redundancies between 
civilian and military efforts and, within the defense industry, to concentrate resources 
on projects of most immediate importance. The shakeup seems intended to bring 
military production into line with economic priorities and to permit more efficient use 
of existing plants and equipment. 
At this juncture, the most significant aspect of these developments may be that 
Peking has found it necessary to take steps to strengthen its control over a military 
bureaucracy accustomed to priority treatment in matters of resource allocation. This 
effort, in turn, underscores the current tightness in the availability of resources for 
new investment as well as the need to maximize output from existing industrial 
facilities. 
Notes 
French Trade and Payments Outlook Improves Markedly 
France's current account deficit should be brought under $1 billion in 1978 if, as 
we expect, present favorable trends in merchandise trade continue. Previous forecasts 
of a $1.8 billion current account deficit have to be revised in light of slower-than-
expected growth in aggregate demand and a first-half surge in exports. The trade 
balance has improved steadily since January, registering a first-half surplus of $147 
Million on an f.o.b./c.o.b. basis. Exports were up 13 percent in franc value in January-
June compared with a year earlier, led by food and manufactured consumer goods. 
Continued slow economic growth?real GNP is rising at a rate of about 3 percent?
held the rise in imports (in terms of francs) to only 6.7 percent. The trade turnaround 
will enhance the prestige of Prime Minister Raymond Barre, who has made 
elimination of the trade deficit and strengthening of the franc major economic policy 
goals.

Egypt Disappointed at Level of Arab Aid 
The Gulf Organization for the Development of Egypt (GODE) has agreed to 
provide Egypt with $250 million in debt relief for 1978-79, as well as substantial debt 
writeoffs in subsequent years. Cairo had been hoping for new commitments of $600 
million to $1 billion in quickly disbursable grants or long-term loans. Unless larger 
amounts of new Arab aid are forthcoming before yearend, Egypt could find itself 
pushing against the short-term borrowing limits contained in its recently approved 
Extended Fund Facility agreement with the IMF. 
The GODE donors?Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and 
Qatar?complained  that cash 
flow problems, declining petroleum revenues, and the falling value of the dollar limit 
their ability to provide economic assistance. While these problems are important, the 
conservative Arab Gulf states may also want to retain their economic leverage in an 
attempt to insure that Sadat is responsive to their interests in the peace negotiations 
with Israel. Although GODE donors remain concerned about Egyptian financial 
management, Cairo's recent agreement with the IMF to make further economic 
reforms temporarily removes this longstanding Arab excuse for delaying new aid 
commitments. 
During 1976 and 1977, the GODE committed $1.75 billion in loans and provided 
loan guarantees worth another $250 million. All but $100 million of this money has 
been used to (a) pay off foreign debt arrears which reached $1 billion early in 1977 
and (b) help Cairo cover the rest of its foreign financial gap in 1977 and the first half 
of 1978. 
All of the new aid promised on 27 July is being provided through debt relief?
$50 million on 1977 debt, $50 million in 1978, and $150 million on 1979 debt. At this 
recent meeting, GODE also agreed in principle to write off the large debt repayments 
falling due beyond 1979.

Canadian Measures Aim at Reviving Confidence 
In a surprise 1 August speech, Prime Minister Trudeau announced a series of 
economic initiatives to infuse new life into Canada's listless economy by building 
business and consumer confidence. While billed as a major shift in economic priorities, 
the program provides no net fiscal stimulus. A key objective is to shore up Trudeau's 
image for parliamentary elections that must he called by next spring. The major 
proposals included: 
? A $2 billion cut in government spending together with a large (but 
unspecified) reduction in taxes. 
? Reaffirmation of Ottawa's intention to reduce government interference in 
private business affairs. 
? A promise to continue government efforts to hold the line on public sector 
wage gains. 
In addition, Trudeau reiterated his goal of holding federal employment stable this 
year and reducing it in 1979. He also announced that the postal service would be 
converted from a government department to a crown corporation, a concession to the 
powerful postal workers' union and an effort to give Canadians some hope for 
improved postal service. The tax cut reportedly will approximate the expenditure 
cutbacks. Consequently, the program's impact on national income and employment 
will depend on whatever boost it gives to public confidence. 
Nigeria Facing Foreign Exchange Stringency 
Nigerian foreign exchange reserves fell to $2.2 billion in July, a drop of $2.0 
billion since the beginning of the year and the lowest level in four years. Reserves are 
now equivalent to only about two months worth of imported goods and services. The 
foreign business community in Nigeria, which is experiencing longer delays in 
receiving payments from the Federal Military Government, believes that Lagos will 
devalue the naira as the next step in relieving the foreign exchange crunch. 
The rapid drawdown of reserves reflects the decline ol oil revenues?which 
account for more than 90 percent of export earnings?coupled with the rise in imports 
of capital goods and services essential to the economic development effort. In March

1978, oil exports reached their lowest level in more than six years, at 1.5 million b/d. 
Demand for Nigerian crude has fallen off as cheaper supplies from the North Sea and 
Alaska have become available. Furthermore, rigid Nigerian oil pricing policies have 
hampered efforts to keep up with traditional competitors, particularly Libya and 
Algeria. 
Already this year the goVernment has taken a number of initiatives in an attempt 
to boost export earnings and ward off serious balance-of-payments problems. Among 
these measures are: 
? Oil price cuts in the first and second quarters and a recently announced 
additional discount to third-party customers who sign long-term contracts for 
specified crudes and to producing companies that raise liftings beyond last 
quarter's average. 
? Implementation in April of an austerity budget restricting consumer

stretch out the payments periods. 
? Arrangement of a $1 billion Eurodollar loan, which has been completely

NOTE: Data are seasonally adjusted. Unemployment rates for France are estimated. The rates shown for Japan and Canada are 
roughly comparable to US rates. For 1975-78, the rates for France and the United Kingdom should be increased by 5 percent and 
15 percent respectively, and those for West Germany decreased by 20 percent to be roughly comparable with US rates. Beginning in 
1977, Italian rates should be decreased by 50 percent to be roughly comparable to US rates.
