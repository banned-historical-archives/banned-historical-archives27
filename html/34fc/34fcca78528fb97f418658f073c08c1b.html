 The widening campaign against waste, corruption and bureaucracy remains as the
 major preoccupation of the regional transmitters.  The goals of the campaign are
 closely related to the need for a thorough ideological remolding in which
 teachers, literary and religious groups are the special groups said to be in need
 of reform.  There are the usual reports of the punis'nments meted out to counter-
 revolutionary elements, although the recent high Lume of such reports has some-
 what abated.  Greater stress is being given to the training of the People's
 Militia, and preferential treatment for dependents of servicemen still is
 important.  The campaign to resist.America  and aid Korea is being closed, but
 new methods for raising money are introduced.  Land reform is still highlighted,
 with reports of resistance, especially in Southwest China, still frequent.  In-
 fractions of the marriage law are still a primary source of concern.  More
 attention is being paid to the national minorities, with special emphasis on the
 increasing number of cadres recruited from among the minorities, and on the
 benevolent and constructive policy of the Central Government in its relations

 Development of Drive:  The drive for incre sed production and austerity has
 continued to be the main theme of internalfibroadcasts, but there has been a notice-
 able change in stress.              The problem of increasing production has been given relatively
 little attention, -while the emphasis has been on the austerity angle under a new
 slogan:  the elimination of waste, corruption, and bureaucracy.
 Reports of meetings to map the anti-waste program and plan the drive came from all
 districts.  Wuhsi (18 Dec.) reported a cadre meeting 14 December, called by the
 southern Kiangsu Communist Party, with 1,14)O attending.  Canton (24 Dec.) announced
 that 2,000 cadres attended a similar meeting for South China 17 December.  Sian
 (25 Dec.) said that the Northwest Bureau of the Communist Party called a meeting
 19 December to organize a committee and make plans for the campaign against graft
 and corruption.  Cadres were ordered to make investigations and report cases of
 malpractice.  Wuhan (14 Dec.) reported a cadre rally in that city, and added that
 the Wuhan Labor Federation is now engaged in a check-up of all industries.  The
 same station (23 Dec.) told of another meeting of administration cadres with Party
 members and Army delegates to study methods to educate the cadres and arouse the
 people to an interest in the drive.  In yet another broadcast from Wuhan (23 Dec.)
 it was reported that the Production and Austerity Committee of Hupeh Province had
 warned cadres that the drive had reached the "democratic inspection" stage, and
 that the masses had taken no interest because the cadres had been critical of the
 public but not of themselves.  Some cadres even had utilized the campaign to commit
 irregularities.
 Chungking (23 Dec.) reported inspections under way in the Southwest to see how well
 the cadres were carrying out their duties.) A meeting of all circles called by the
 Southwest Military Commission was announced for 2 pm  25 December, with a broadcast
 of the proceedings.  All individuals and groups were urged to listen.  Shanghai
 .(22 Dec.) broadcast an appeal for more zerl.ous efforts from the Nanking Discipline
 Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.  Mukden (23 Dec.) said that the North-
 east Federation of Labor had designated mid-December to mid-January as a check-up
 period.  A Peking transmission told of a Maritime Customs Commission meeting 1-15
 December of all personnel engaged in "examining and appraising cargo and collecting
 revenue," with the following accomplishment:
 As a result of the practice of austerity, the expenses incurred in the
 course of the meeting were about one-third less than in previous
 special trade meetings.  (Peking, numeral code, 17 Dec.)
 Insofar as production itself was concerned, numerous reports of minor successes in
 individual factories, stores and localities were broadcast throughout China.  The
 only new theme noted was in a broadcast from Chinchow (17 Dec.), which told of a
 directive from the Liaosi Provincial People's Government calling on all subsidiary
 offices to inaugurate a program of "supplementary production" as part of the
 austerity program.
 A Sian broadcast (26 Dec.) claimed that the drive against waste, corruption and
 bureaucracy had made great progress in its learly stages in the Northwest.    For
 example, students in the Northwest Revolutionary University made public accusations
 of waste in government offices, while the ESING TUNG JIH PAO sponsored an
 exhibition on waste and bureaucracy.
 Novel Methods:  Peking announced in numeral code (18 Dec.) that the 29th Volume of
 the Current Events Handbook would soon be published, with its contents centering
 on the production and austerity drive.  Peking's Home Service (18 Dec.) broadcast
 an article by Ai Chi-cheng, Ministry of Light Industries, urging the Chinese to
 develop the pigskin industry as a way to increase production.  Peking in a numeral
 code transmission (19 Dec.) claimed that the gasoline that can be made from
 bituminous coal by native methods was of alsuperior quality.  "In comparison with
 petroleum sold on the market, its efficiency in starting internal combustion motors
 is greater, and its price is much lower." (Another numeral code transmission (18 Dec.)

 announced that the Engineering Bureau of the Northwest Railway Network would complete
 the Tienshui-Lanchow Railway by the end of 1952, six months ahead of schedule.  As a
 result of "on-the-spot examinations and revision of plans for key projects,"
 expenses for repair and reconstruction are to be cut by 50 percent.
 Mukden (22 Dec.) reported that cadres in various organs of the MIA den Government have
 "learned the difference between bourgeois and proletarian thought, and have realized
 the shamefulness of indulging in corrupt and extravagant practices."  As a result
 work plans are carried out with greater dispatch, and "some units even have saved
 50 percent of their gasoline consumption."  Another Mukden broadcast (14 Dec.) said
 that introduction of the piece-work system in the Fifth Cement "corks and the non-
 ferrous mines of the Northeast at first displeased the workers because of the high
 quotas and the interruptions in the flow of raw materials, but eventually these
 were corrected, and now the workers demand that two be allowed to do work that formerly
 required three men.  Tsinan (15 Dec.) said that building contractors in that city
 had signed a pact "promising not to exploit workers and not to cheat on materials."
 Peking in numeral code (16 Dec.) reported that the Office of Commerce of the Shantung
 People's Government had saved 50 million yuan during the first 20 days of November
 by "correcting its extravagant spending on entertainment, the printing of souvenir
 pamphlets and the making of souvenir emblems."
 Hankow (13 Dec.) reported that Hankow city workers had pledged to save half a billion
 yuan by changing their work techniques, reducing the use of materials, and "improving
 their working efficiency."  Yangchow (18 Dec.) announced that Hsueh Hsu-ko, a
 packer in the Chitung Yarn and Textile Mill, had saved 54 million yuan by repairing
 2,700 gunny sacks, and by introducing the method of hand-breaking ties instead of
 cutting them, thus saving much damage to the bags.  Hangchow (19 Dec.) described the
 Liang Lo-jen method now used in loading the 180 grain cars in the city.  A cloth
 carpet is spread from the car to the warehouse, saving three catties of grain in the
 loading of each car for a total saving of 32,400 catties a year.
 Shanghai (13 Dec.) reported that the South Anhwei Labor Federation had issued a
 directive to all subordinate offices to "keep within their budgets, economize on
 stationery, printing and long-distance calls, and to stop personal extravagances
 and illegal practices."  Shanghai (13 Dec.) also reported that Ku  Tso-chen, No. 1
 Shangshu Lane, Nanking, received a statement of praise from Mayor Ko because he
 wrote a letter to the Nanking PEOPLE'S DAILY charging the staff of the No. 2
 Nanking Tax Office with improper conduct.
 Canton (20 Dec.) announced that the Kwangtung office of the China Food Company had
 adopted innovations in handling gunny sacks reducing damage from 20 percent to a
 mere one percent and saving 150 million yuan.  Peking in numeral code (25 Dec.)
 credited the Materials Bureau of the',Kwangtung Finance Office with collection of
 30 billion yuan worth of scrap metal and machinery.  Canton (23 Dec.) reported that
 the Communications Department of the Kwangtung Provincial Government had issued an
 order making all automobile transportation in the province subject to the management
 of the Kwangtung Automobile Transportation Company.  As a result, the broadcast
 claimed, "13 units can be canceled, 554 employees removed, and 4.6 billion yuan
 saved in a year."
 Chungking (13 Dec.) announced that prisoners in (Chingehuan) Hsien were organized
 into work competition teams last August, and at the same time were given
 indoctrination so they could "realize the errors of their thinking."  As a result
 they now produce 500 pairs of sandals a day instead of the former 400.  Chungking
 also. said (15 Dec.) that "following intensive political indoctrination," village
 cadres and the masses have decided to eliminate "wasteful superstitious customs"
 at New Year's by refraining from burning altar candles and incense.  One hsiang
 alone, Huachia, will save 32.75 million yuan.
 Weaknesses and Failures:  Failures in the increased production and austerity program
 have been frequent, as radio reports from all parts of China show.  Some of these
 failures would appear to be trivial, but many are more serious, and have called
 for reprimands in addition to the bad publicity.

 Shanghai (16 Dec.) said that because of bureaucratic control of Government warehouses
 in that city, large quantities of goods had spoiled.  Local Government offices
 organized a joint inspection team to make further check-ups.  Tsinan (14 Dec.)
 reported that wasteful cadres in the Yenfeng Textile Mills had lost 10 to 20 skeins
 of yarn a day by throwing materials on the floor.  The same broadcast said that a
 check among cadres of the Shantung Committee of the Chinese Communist Party showed
 that their use of electricity had exceeded estimates by 2.99 million Yuan, while
 they had used enough coal and water to run costs 5 million and 2 million yuan,
 respectively, above the estimates.  Tsinan (14 Dec.) also said that Wang Pi-wu,
 director of the Shantung Department of Construction, had refused to check his
 department properly or consider economy proposals of his workers.  Following a mass
 meeting he agreed to make public all of his accounts.
 The Peking Home Service (26 Dec.) announced that the Quartermaster's Transportation
 Department of the Northwest Military District had uncovered 9.9 billion yuan worth
 of usable goods while clearing away waste.  Wuhan (22 Dec.) reported 30 billion yuan
 lost in Kwangsi Province during the year because of inadequate storage and distribution
 of grain and extravagant practices.  Wuhan (14 Dec.) announced that Communist Party,
 Youth Corps and Labor Union cadres checked on the inventories of the Hengyang
 section of the Canton-Hankow Railway and found 126 items worth 126 million yuan not
 on the inventory and overstocks on 225 items worth 210 million yuan.
 Hangchow (17 Dec.) announced that the Hangchow Railway subbureau of the Shanghai
 Railway Administration, according to a preliminary check, had tied up and wasted
 30 million yuan.  The Chientang River Bridge Engineering Section allowed 130 units
 of timber to rot at a cost of 300 million yuan, and spent 101.6 million on entertain-
 ment in 10 months.  Hangchow (18 Dec.) said that the Chekiang Province branch bank
 wasted 20 million yuan on printing costs by using quality paper when pulp would have
 served the purpose, and by printing enough forms to last six years, many of which
 will be out of date before they are used.  Hangchow (15 Dec.) reported that because
 pest control operations were stopped last year, 10.2 percent of the rice crop was
 lost because of insect damage in nine hsien of the Linan Special District, Chekiang
 Province. The loss, 2.34 percent higher than last year, amounted to 56.53 million
 catties.  Yangchow (13 Dec.) reported that the Lilin Iron Works, northern Kiangsu
 Province, squandered 10 million yuan during the year on the purchase of unusable
 equipment.  The same radio (19 Dec.) said that cadres constructing waterworks in
 Yencheng, northern Kiangsu, estimated the job at 140 million yuan but spent 260
 million.  After construction was finished another 4 million yuan was needed to alter
 the plant, and 400,000 to replace an unsatisfactory pump.  Building contractors
 "cheated on labor and materials," and the cadres were guilty of gross incompetence.
 As usual, the most extreme examples of failures came from the Southwest and were
 reported by the Chungking radio.  One broadcast (19 Dec.) said that the Cultural
 Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee wasted 5.8
 million yuan merely in repairing its offices.  At a Southwest Ccmmunist Party
 meeting Ho Lung made a summary report in which he charged that "corruption and
 extravagance, under the cover of errors, have been prevalent among the various
 organizations directly under control of the military district."  Another Chungking
 report (23 Dec.) took the joint business shops to task for their wasteful and
 corrupt methods.  Joint business shops in Lu Hsien, Szechwan, speculated and
 hoarded to such an extent that the soap manufacturers were allowed to make 23.8
 million yuan simply by adjusting prices.  The joint business shops in the Third
 Chu, Kusung Hsien, exploited the farmers by cutting prices on their goods and
 raising prices on what the farmers bought.  In Jenshou Hsien cotton prices were cut
 at marketing time.
 In southern Szechwan the Luchow Joint Trade Umbrella Center accepted an 800,000-
 yuan order from Military District authorities, but one-fifth  of the umbrellas
 could not he used because of poor workmanship.  The photographic trade in Luchow
 and I-pin raised prices, lowered quality, delayed delivery dates, and in general
 hampered efficient business.  The Native Products Joint Trade firm of Luchow city

 evaded taxes of 10 million yuan a month, and at the same time concealed 78.5 percent
 of its original capital.  According to a Chungking (14 Dec.) report, Loh Cheng-yu
 has been removed from his position as acting branch manager of the Chungking unit
 of the China Foodstuffs Company and has been turned over to a special committee for
 investigation because of his "waste, mismanagement and errors in thinking."  Early
 in the year he assured Chungking there would be no food shortage, but this fall 3,613
 tons of food had to be shipped in at a cost of 560 million yuan.  Chungking (18 Dec.)
 reported that in Nanchuan Hsien, Szechwan, extravagances in weddings and celebrations
 are rampant among the farmers.  Formerly 20 hogs fulfilled the needs of Chenchiatsun
 village.  Now 50 are killed.  Tung Kung-wu spent 1.8 million yuan on his  mother's
 birthday, while Shang Lung spent a family fortune, one million Yuan, on his wedding
 Troubles also are reported from Sikang Province.  Chungking (24 Dec.) reported only
 19.57 percent of grain quotas delivered in all Sikang, including 34 percent in
 Kangting, 35.3 percent in the greater Yaan area and 76.6 in Yaan city.  The reason
 given for the late deliveries is that the season is late and the weather has been
 bad, "but local cadres also should be held responsible for not helping to overcome
 surmountable difficulties."  The Sikang Provincial Government has set the end of
 December as a delivery deadline, and cadre meetings have been called.
 Corruption and Squeeze:  Cases of tax evasion, graft and fraud by individual business-
 men and public workers have been reported considerably more often by the Chinese
 radio during the period 13-26 December.  This could mean that such instances are
 growing more numerous, but more probably is a  result of the stepped-up drive to get
 rid of corrupt practices and punish offenders.
 The Hangchow radio takes the lead in reporting cases of fraud.  A broadcast (13 Dec.)
 stated that for the first 11 months of 1951 provisional business tax evasions alone
 amounted to nearly 3 billion yuan in the city, while evasions of the revenue stamp
 tax reached 221 million.  Cadres in the area have organized farmers and shop clerks
 to report tax evasions, with 3,818 persons enlisted.  Such groups have been
 organized in Wenchow, Shaohsing, Yungkang, and Lanchi, all in Chekiang Province.
 In Shangchang Chu, Hang Hsien, Chekiang, business-tax evasions were estimated at
 680,000 yuan, and commodity tax evasions at 29 million.  In Wenchow, Yung Yao-f u,
 proprietor of the Yung Yuan Oil Shop, and Loh Chia-chi, proprietor of the Pushing
 Wine Shop, were fined for tax evasions.
 Hangehow (15 Dec.) announced that corruption charges had been filed against
 Chang Lan-tien, Chen Shao-ting and Chang Hsiu-feng, lumber mill employees of the
 Chekiang Construction Company.  The Chuchi office of this same construction company,

 On 5 December, Hangchow reported (21 Dec.), the Yuchang People's Court called a
 rally to pronounce sentences on eight merchants for evading taxes and breaking the

 fraud.  Chungking said (14 Dec.) that corruption and waste had permeated cadres in
 charge of cooperatives in nothern Szechwan, where they had deposited expense mone;;
 amounting to 6 million yuan, and wasted 100,000 in Nanchian Hsien alone on drinking

 Chungking (15 Dec.) reported that Chen Ko-pei, Tax Bureau deputy director in the
 I-pin Special Administrative District, southern Szechwan;, and three of the 10 hsien
 finance officers in the district, had robbed the Government of money collected as
 taxes.  Embezzlements by tax collectors in Southwest China for the first half of 1950
 were said to total 1,125,000,000 yuan, 29,000 silver dollars, 5 ounces of gold and a
 large quantity of goods.  Most of the corrupt officials were "carryovers from the
 Kuomintang regime."  Another Chungking report (19 Dec.) told of a mass meeting of
 600 persons in Kuayang Hsien, Szechwan, to charge Chu Chi=yang with corruption while
 in charge of the Finance Bureau.
 In Kweichow Province, according to Chungking (19 Dec.), Ko Chi-hsing, Cheng Sheh-kao
 and Fu Yung-king organized the Yumirig Oil Company and handled 40,600 catties of
 vegetable oil in black-market dealings.  Lu Wen-chung and Chang Chang-fa similarly

 charges.  However, reports of corruption were not confined to the Hangchow and
 Chungking transmitters.  Canton (24 Dec.) reported that 1,000 cadres met 15 December
 in the Peichiang Special District and turned over Tsai Yuan-tse, Lin Pao and Chen
 Yu-hsing to the People's Court on charges of graft.   Tsai was called a Kuomintang
 reactionary.  Dairen (19 Dec.) announced that Kiang Chung-wen, proprietor of the

 Tobacco Company evaded taxes totaling 220 million yuan.
 Hankow (13 Dec.) said that cadres of the Hupeh Construction Company held a struggle
 rally 9 December to indict Wang Yung-chun, "a feudalistic carryover from the old
 regime," for defrauding the company of 17.84 million yuan and causing businessmen
 to lose 457 million on their contracts through his manipulation of bids.  Hankow
 also reported (19 Dec.) that charges of corruption had been filed against Chin Ying-
 chun, chief of the Business Department, and Lu Chi-changl,'I of the Wholesale Depart-
 ment of the Wuhan General Merchandise Company.  Wuhan (22 Dec.) broadcast a statement

 IDEOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENTS
 Propaganda Personnel:  A Peking Home Service broadcast (19pec.)  indicates that in
 the immediate future less attention may be focused on schools, propaganda media,
 and the development of thought reform among the masses of1peasants and workers.
 Instead, more attention may be devoted to developi--ig efficient personnel for
 subsequent use of these propaganda media and work amongitkie masses.  The Peking
 broadcast quoted the PEOPLE'S DAILY in disclosing that 1.55 million trained
 propagandists now are engaged in promoting the anti-American movement, counter-
 revolutionary suppression, and the increased production axid austerity program.
 It is urged that the authorities continue to develop more propaganda personnel,
 with a goal of 4 - 5 million by the end of 1952.
 Following the line laid down by the PEOPLE'S DAILY, youlhand student groups in East
 China, Shanghai reported (19 Dec.), have issued a directive instructing cadres in
 the Youth Corps to expand the organization's membership, and to stress thought
 reform among all youth groups.  Wuhsi (25 Dec.) explains further that Youth Corps
 cadres are to support Communist Party cadres "in the organization of a propaganda
 network," and that by 7 October, 243 Youth Corps members ia East China, or 42.8
 percent, had become members of the Communist Party.
 In the Northwest, Sian reported (17 Dec.), the Higher Production and Austerity
 Committee of Class A Government organs held its first confel'^ence, with Chairman
 Ma Wen-lieh stressing that "it is necessary to start w.'.'    full-scale remolding
 movement."  Sian (18 Dec.) reported a meeting of 6,000 cadres called by the Kansu
 Province Communist Party 15 December, with Party Secretar.Eihang Te-fen calling on
 the cadres to "eliminate their ideological difficulties."~`. angchow (15 Dec.)
 announced that a Northeast recruiting team was in that city taking applications
 for administrative positions in the Northeast from among 661lege and high school
 graduates.  Applicants had to have police identification cards and a "clear record
 for the past two years."
 Chungking (16 Dec.) asserted that the cadres, as well as the masses, in Wushan
 Hsien, eastern Szechwan, had "changed their attitude aftezia period of intensive
 indoctrination" in 81 study groups.  The same radio (171Dec.) reported that the
 Cultural and Educational Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative
 Committee had screened 65 sons and daughters of farmerslanej laborers in the district
 and qualified them for entry into the preparatory classlofraChungking University.
 I
 Schools and Teachers:  The Chinese radio has not entirely aybandoned the theme that
 teachers must carry out thought reform.  Peking, in a numl ral code transmission
 (18 Dec, ),said that the thought-reform movement among college teachers in Peking
 and Tientsin had "attained results and experience," andlw614ld be carried out in
 colleges throughout China.  In addition, 10,400 Peking hig2~ and elementary school
 teachers have been enrolled in thought-reform study ;lasses since November.  Wuhsi
 (19 Dec.) reported that in the Changchow school system the (teachers "now realize the
 importance of political consciousness in their work."  Teachers of Changchow
 Normal School formerly thought they were "responsible only to their principal."
 Now they realize they are responsible only to the people.  Junior high school
 teachers in the Chungnan, Chunghsing and City schools are'studying new democratic
 thought enthusiastically."  Yangchow (20 Dec.) said that high school teachers
 now know they must reform their thought to become modelliteachers, so they have

 Shanghai (17 Dec.) reported that the Education Department of the East China
 Military and Administrative Committee called a meeting of education officials from
 provinces, chu and cities 10-15 December to "review the training plan for 1952," and
 stressed that a "judicious guidance of political thought" must be carried out among
 teachers and students.  Canton (19 Dec.) announced that the Propaganda Department;oi
 the Central and South China Military and Administrative Committee called two meetings,
 7 and 14 October, "to discuss measures to correct confusion in school education."
 Another meeting was called 26 October "to review the people's reaction toward
 measures adopted by the two previous symposia."  No attempt was made to describe
 or analyze the people's reaction, indicating that perhaps it had not been entirely
 satisfactory.
 Science Worker : Dairen (18 Dec.) told of the meeting of 1,uO0 delegates in a prel
 paratory conference of the Dairen-Port Arthur branch of the Chinese Natural Science
 Association.   Chu Chi-yang, Mayor of Dairen, called on the scientists to "study --le
 thinking of Mao Tse-tung and take the proletarian rather than the bourgeois approach
 to science."   Mukden (19 Dec.), reporting on the same meeting, said that represent-
 atives from 20 research institutes were at the conference.  Several speakers, in-
 cluding a doctor, stressed the necessity of studying the thoughts of Mao Tse-tung
 and of complying with the thought-reform movement for intellectuals.  A numeral code
 transmission from Peking (26 Dec.) quoted from Volume 6, No. 1, of the "China
 Botany."  Chang Chin-yueh, Dean of Peking University, in that publication criticized
 scientists of China for refusing to give up the imperialistic science of the
 capitalistic nations for the people's science of the USSR.  He said:
 We have refused to accept Soviet science.  Ostensibly, it is because
 scientists should not easily accept ideas.  Actually, this is only a
 subterfuge.  If so, then why do we accept European and American
 science so readily and without question.  The slowness of Chinese scientists
 to accept the great Soviet scientists, Michurin and Lysenko, is an
 example of this attitude.  In the past I had been one of those who had
 refused to accept Soviet science.  But now, after I have studied thought
 reform and intellectual criticism, I have realized the error of any ways.
 Now I know that science must serve the people.  (Peking, numeral code,
 26 Dec.)
 Radio and Publications:  The Peking Home Service (18 Dec.) announced that "great
 achievements" had been reported as a result of broadcasting and monitoring activities
 in factories and coal mines of Taiyuan during the past 10 months.  Wuhan (18 Dec.)
 reported that in Central and South China many factories employing more than 100
 persons have installed radio-listening equipment, with 150 wire broadcasting
 stations having been set up in the larger concerns.  In Canton, for example, morel
 than 20,000 industrial workers have received propaganda education regularly through
 listenening to broadcasts.  "In fact, broadcasting stations have become a powerful
 propaganda weapon for promotion of the patriotic emulation campaign."  One concern
 in Canton even claimed to have increased its production by 30 percent as a result
 of the broadcasts.
 Peking in numeral code (22 Dec.) told of the 116th Administrative Meeting of the
 Government Administrative Council 21 December, when reports were read by Hu Yu-chi,
 Director of the Publications Administration, and Wang Kun-lun, an official concerned
 with the examination of documents, or censorship.  The trend toward stronger
 control and regulation of publications is clearly seen in the resolutions adopted
 as a result of these reports:  "Rules Governing Import of Overseas Printed Matter";
 "Directive Concerning Unified Employment of Productive Power of Lead-type Printing
 Presses"; "Establishment of a Nation-wide Newspaper, Book, and Periodical
 Distributing Network"; "Provisional Rules Governing Control of Publishers and
 Distributors of Books and Periodicals"; and "Provisional Rules Governing Registration
 of Periodicals."  The nature of publications that will be approved in the future
 can be forecast from a Yangehow broadcast (16 Dec.) which said that a people's
 magazine in northern Kiangsu had an a:cicle in 36 issues on the ideologies of Engels,

 Peking announced in numeral code (25 Dec.) that the Publicity Bureau of the Chinese
 Communist Party had awarded prizes to two Ciiiinese~ comics.  Hankow (18 Dec,) reported
 that the Central and South China News, Publication Administration had cooperated
 with the HankowM1unicipal Cultural and Educational Bureau in launching a campaign to
 reform comics. The first step in the campaign will be a study of the contents of
 comics.  Then chu by chu meetings of handlers of comics will be called "to carry
 out education and political thought," and to make the handlers understand "that to
 publish more new comics is a patriotic act, and that they shall unite to develop
 the business in common." When the handlers are properly educated an organization
 will be formed and patriotic pacts will be drawn up.  Then review meetings will be
 scheduled.  When the entire businesa is properly organized, public loans will be
 granted to the businessmen.  The broadcast added that in Wuhan city a comics
 reform committee alreac y had been set up.
 Religious Countermeasures:   During the period 13-26 December anti-religious reports
 intercepted were limited to moves against the Catholics in Narking and in the
 Northeastern city of Changchun.  Peking in numeral code (24 Dec.) announced that
 meetings were held in Nanking 15 and 16 December and the Nanking Catholic
 Promotion Committee of Religious Reform set up.  Mukden (21 Dec.) reported that
 9 December the Catholics of Changchun called a mass meeting to accuse French
 priest (Kao Te-hui) of being "an imperialist disguised as a religious worker," and to
 demand his expulsion.  The priest was accused of working with the Manchukuo
 Japanese regime, and of cooperating after the liberation with Chiang secret agent
 Liu Tse- ei, and with a "spy for the American Navy," Yin Shih-kan.  The Mukden radio
 (22 Dec.) explained more fully that by 14 December 3,500 patriotic Catholics in
 Changchun had signed the "three-self's reform movement to sever all relations with
 imperialist elements."  Yu Ching-san was quoted as saying that the Catholic priest
 connived with the American-Chiang gang, and plotted "to destroy the better and
 happier days we gained following the liberation."  Mukden (26 Dec.) announced that
 the Changchun Security Office had issued an order 21 December expelling (Kao Te-hui)
 and three other Catholic priests from China.
 Winter Schools:  Little was said during the period under review about the winter
 schools except to report their openings in various areas.  Yangchow (13 Dec.) said
 599 schools opened 3 December in I-cheng Hsien, Kiangsu, with an enrollment of
 30,000.  The goal for the winter has been set at 40,000.   Hangchow (26 Dec.)
 reported more than 50 percent of the farmers in Kangchiao Hsiang, Hang Hsien,
 Chekiang, enrolled.  The station said in another broadcast (17 Dec.) that about
 20 percent of the people were enrolled in Ningpo, with teachers being trained from
 among better-educated farmers, "unemployed intellectuals, and unemployed workers."
 Kai#eng (14 Dec.) reported more than 3 million enrolled in Honan's winter schools.
 Chungking (16 Dec.) claimed there would be a school in every villa e in Tzuchung
 Hsien, Szechwan, with an estimated enrollment of 200,000.  Mukden (25 Dec.) reported
 that the enrollment of 39,730 in Chaotung Hsien, Heilungkiang, exceeded expectations.
 Apparently, according to another Mukden broadcast (17 Dec.), the avowed primary
 purpose of the winter schools, "to develop political consciousness," was not
 stressed in the appeals for enrollment.  A circular issued 15 December by the
 Education Department for the Northeast was quoted as commenting on the failure "to
 activate the broad masses" in rural areas, and urged peasants to enroll in the
 winter schools "to learn technical skills for agricultural production."
 Reports of Activities:   A relatively small number of actions by counterrevolutionaries
 was reported by the Chinese radio in the two weeks 13-26 December, and those reported
 were not centered in any particular area.  Hangchow (16 Dec.) reported that the
 Chekiang Frontier Defense Corps clashed with pirates, with 166 of the latter being
 killed and a large quantity of arms captured.  Wuhsi (15 Dec.) told of special
 guards being placed near factories and railways of Tanyang, Changahu, Chinchiang,
 Wu and Chiangning  Hsien of Kiangsu, Ningkuo of Anhwei and Wuhsing Hsien, Chekiang
 Province, and of women's teams being stationed in the towns during the day to
 watch for "questionable characters," but called these moves part of the normal
 winter defense measures of the People's Militia.

 campaign" the Militia in the Paoteng Special District, Szechwan, captured 993 "bandits,
 reactionary landlords and Chiang agents," as well as 385 rifle., four machine guns
 and other equipment.  The Militia will train additional men for border defense work.
 Chungking (19 Dec.) also reported discovery of oil-soaked materials in the
 Chuanchiangi Shipyards, where fires broke out 16 November and 7, 8, 9 and 10 December.
 Punishment:  Insight into the extent of counterrevolutionary activity is gained from
 reports of 1arrests and punishment of agents.  Mukden (18 Dec.) aruAo.nced that
 Han Tso-chow, Meng Hung-ping and Yang Ching-ho had been arrested in Changmin Chu,
 in the Mukden suburbs, 14 November.  They had been officials of the People's

 laborers.  the same broadcast reported that in Liuchung Chu, Haining Hsien, Antung
 Government padres read off a list of wanted counterrevolutionaries at a mass
 meeting of x.,300.  A committee of 190 was organized into seven teams to go out after
 the men.  Chinchow (13 Dec.) said that people in Chiukou village, Suichung, had
 recovered from their fear of reprisals following talks by Government cadres, and
 had turned over to the authorities Chao Yuan-fah, Yu Tse-yang and Kao Hsiao-wu.
 The same br adcast reported a public trial attended by 300 in the Sixth Chu of

 during the Japanese occupation.  Wuhan (19 Dec.)  reported that Ma Te-chieh, owner
 of the Yuel-Xeng Coal Mine, and his employee, Sze Yao-ching, were found to be
 counterrevolutionaries after they cheated the Honan branch of the China Mining
 Machinery Company out of 23 million yuan on a coal contract.

 and the Sixth Chu  .f I-pin Hsien.
 A Hangchow broadcast (19 Dec.) reveals a new approach.  The Tientsin People's
 Caurt. proposed in the recent sentencing of Chino }.ling-chu and Li Tung-ko that 10
 million yuan be taken from their confiscated assets to reward persons who gave
 information leading to their apprehension.
 Labor Reform:  Forced labor seems to be recognized as the best cure for counter-
 revolutionary activities, next to the firing squad.                      Canton (19 Dec.) reported that
 counterrevolutionary prisoners have made progress during the past five months while
 repairing houses avid dormitories, making brick, breaking stone, planting 9,000
 fruit trees and Haring for 6,800 head of hogs and poultry.  "Compulsory labor and
 political education have been coordinated to cope with slowdown strikes, pretended
 illness, sabotage, or attempts to escape or commit suicide."  Peking in numeral
 code announced that 65 percent of the counterrevolutionaries are "undergoing labor
 reform."  In Omei Hsien, Szechwan, they operate a brick factory, a tile factory
 and a lime kiln.   In Chichiang Hsien, Szechwan, 200 work in a coal mine, while
 the entire group in this hsien earn enough to pay for their keep plus 13 million

 Training of Militia:  Peking in a Home Service broadcast  (16 Dec.) announced that
 registration of Militiamen for training had started in North China, where 110,000
 peasants from 5,321 villages are to be trained.  Peking in numeral code (16 Dec.)
 said that winter training had been suspended this year in the Chahar Province famine
 area, but in Hopei eight officers' training centers have turned out 61,000 Army
 instructors.  Conferences on People's Militia affairs will be called this winter and
 spring in Shantung, Fukien, Chekiang, Kiangsu and Anhwei, along with conferences
 of Militia representatives in the various hsien of the areas to discuss training
 problems and the organization of mobile training units.
 Chungking (13 Dec.) announced that Militia cadres and civilian workers in Paoshan,
 Yunnan Province, have been given training so that they may be integrated with the
 regular border defense units.  Tsinan (13 Dec.) reported that with the arrival of
 two model Militiamen, the 24-man Militia of Toulan village, Eighth Chu, Chuyeh
 Hsien, Shantung, had been reorganized, trained in handling arms, and given political
 indoctrination.  Now 20 more villagers want to join the Militia.  In Paihu village,
 Sixth Chu, Wenshang Hsien, Shantung, two Militiamen returned after an indoctrination
 course at the county seat.  Now Chang Yin-kuan has entirely lost his former in-
 different attitude, and all  the Militiamen have a fuller realization of their
 patriotic duties.
 Preferential Treatment;  The plan introduced several weeks ago to give preferential
 treatment to wounded servicemen and their families, and to the families of those
 fighting in K.:rea still gets considerable attention, though the drive seems to have
 slackened somewhat.  Peking in a Home Service broadcast (24 Dec.) anncunced that four
 organizations had issued a directive making the comforting of Army dependents a
 special project of youth and children during the spring festival.  Peking announced

 Government had issued a directive 12 December calling for preferential treatment

 Canton (19 Dec.) reported that the expansion of preferential treatment was one of
 the accomplishments of the Third People's Representative Conference of All Circles in
 that city inDecember..  Wuhan (22 Dec.) said that Wuhan city has designate' January
 as a special' preferential treatment month.      All organizations must set up committees
 to carry out the work.  The same radio said (2) Dec.) that 10,600 forms had been
 sent to merchants to obtain information for checking on the extent of preferential
 treatment.   Mukden (22 Dec.) reported that the Sangkiang Provincial Government had
 issuud a directive calling on people to pay courtesy calls to servicemen and their
 dependents.  Of the 4,145 servicemen's farms given help under the preferential
 treatment program in Liaosi Province, '70 percent had bumper crops.  in Liaosi gunny
 bag or''quiltfactories have been organized in 16 hsien to give ]employment to
 dependents.  Among persons elected chu delegates are 212 relatives of servicemen,
 and 1,800 children of servicemen have been given free schoolini.
 Dairen (18 Dec.) quoted Sun Chung-shah, chairman of the Dairen Ricksha, Pedicab and
 Horsecart Workers Committee of the China Transport Union, as saying at a 10 December
 meeting that his organization had contributed 1,117,500 yuan to dependents,' had
 iven free or reduced-rate rides, and planned to give New Year's gifts.  Dairen
 (13 Dec'.) said that people of the Sixth Chu, Port Arthur, assisted 10 families 54
 times with all their farm work, and 38 families 208 times with part of their farm
 work.
 Resist-America. Aid-Korea Donations:  The donation drive to supply planes, guns and
 other equipment to the Chinese fighting in Korea is being allowed to die quietly,
 with ori3rs from local branches and no centralized action.  Wuhan (25 Dec.)' reported
 that the Hunan branch of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Committee issued a directive
 15 December calling upon all cadres to cease the drive and devote their attentions
 to increased production and austerity.  Chungking (26 Dec.)  anounced that the drive
 had ended in'Yunnan 18 December with 26 hsien exceeding their quotas and a few
 backward hsien ordered to complete the drive at once.
 III
 Despite' the closing of the donation drive, the resist America, aid-Korea committees
 have been maintained, and it seems that only the direct donation drive, not' the
 program, to raise money for purchase of military equipment  has lbeen abandoned.  New
 and less direct methods will be adopted.  Hankow (19 Dec.), for instance, reported
 that the Wuhan Department of Education and Culture called a meeting 17 December to
 map plans for the showing of a resist-America, aid-Korea film that will "give people
 a better understanding of the Chinese Volunteer Forces, the American atrocities,
 and the' struggle for world peace."  Director. Feng of the Central and South lChina
 branch of the China Film Company wac quoted as saying his office plans to spend
 320, 000,yuan'on publicity for the picture, and the public will be urged to see it.
 Canton (24 Dec.) announced that the movie would be shown in 40 large cities',
 starting 28 December.  in Canton it will be shown in 19 theaters simultaneously,
 indicating that no other films will be allowed to offer competition.  The entire
 income from the showing of the movie will go to the resist-America, aid-Korea
 donation fund, and cultural and educational units in Kwangtung,~ including the Sino-
 Soviet Friendship Association, have organized to promote the picture in the various
 localities, and to "map out concrete methods to mobilize the broad mass of the
 people to see this film."
 Another', new development in connection with the Korea fighting was announced' by the
 Peking Home Service transmitter (24 Dec.).  A volunteer group of radio technicians
 recruited in Peking, Tientsin and A4ukden left early in December for the Korean front,
 carrying 1,000 radio receivers and much other radio equipmen?t.l They will set up a
 radio :;-c.d^.ast reception center for the Chinese Volunteers, and training  lasses
 for monitors will be started among the soldi-rs.

 RURAL REFORLS
 Land Reform:   Continued pressure to enforce land reform, as well as continued resist-
 ance, has been reflected in Chinese broadcasts, especially in the Southwest.  The
 Peking Home Service (19 Dec.)lannounced that 5,600 students and teachers of
 universities in Canton had left for the various rural regions of Kwangtung to
 carry out land reform.  Kaifeing (14 Dec.) reported that "following intensive
 indoctrination," cadres had been selected for a land reform reinspec-tion group.
 The extent of the indoctrination is seen from a quoted statement of Jen Min-chu, a
 Youth Corps member of the group, who "expressed his enthusiasm for.rei.nspection
 by saying that the implementation of land reform is everyone's patriotic duty."
 Wuhan (18 Dec.) announced that nine work teams had launched lane: reform work in the
 Central and South China region, along with 'scrutiny of land reform implementation,"
 which seems to be as important as the actual redistribution.   "In all localities many
 ur.lawful landlords were uncovered before and after the land reform work and its
 reinvestigation policies....  The broad masses of farmers actively heightened their
 vigilance against the destructive intrigues of 'nlawful landlords and disclosed
 their hidden properties."  A further insight    into the pressure put on farmers to
 betray the landlords and disclose their secrets is gained from another broadcast:
 After lane: reform was in full swing cadres carried out large-
 scale publicity on policy by which the shameless subversive plots
 of the landlord class were exposed....   The cadres lived with the
 poor and rich peasants, with whom they ate and worked.   Since
 they have had the cadres to depend on, they have become very
 active in the reform.   (Hankow, Hankow Regional, 18 Dec.)
 Active participation by women in the land reform program is reported by Wuhan
 (16 Dec.).  At Nanling village, Chungshan Hsien, Kwangtung, half the women of the
 village took part in the struggle against reactionary landlords, the broadcast said.
 At Liling, Hunan, 140 women are engaged in land reform work; 40 participated at
 Enshih Hsien, Hupeh; at Lichia village, Honan, Li Hsing-jen helped convince her
 husband that he should support land reform.
 Chungking (24 Dec.) announced that "because of effective propaganda in awakening
 farmers to the evils of hiding goods for landlords," many farmer._ Save exposed these
 hiding places.  For instance,! it was disclosed that Kao Chang-ching hid 128 pounds
 of wax worth 5 million yuan in his house for a landlord in Luchun village,
 Kingtsun Hsiang, Hochuan Hsien, Szechwan.  Another Szechwan farmer of Yaoho village,
 Tungking Hsiang, Omei Hsien,~Chang HSi-wu, bid 400 packages of silver and wax in
 his house.   In Tatung Hsiang, Nanchuan Esien, Szechwan, two rifles, two pistols
 and 500 rounds of ammunition were found hidden in a farmer's house, while similar
 finds were reported from Szechwan hsien of Changning and Hsingwen.  In spite of
 these disclosures, Chungking said (17 Dec.) that in Szechwan areas where land
 reform has been completed some landlords have taken over farmers' houses and  "even
 forced the latter to pay rent."  Some landlords have been found destroying forests.
 They also have disseminated rumors, and "even bribed the farmers with money and
 women."  A Chungking broadcast (16 Dec.) complained that landlords in villages
 along the Yangtze River have refused to "do public service by hiring others to work
 for them," and still continue to waste money on feasting.
 Chungking (19 Dec.) also reported difficulties in Yunnan Province.  in Mengtzu,
 Chuching, Chengchiang and Kunyang Hsien, and in 23 other hsien, "land reform work
 has been carried out very slowly because of the shortage of leadership of cadres
 and imperfect reform plans."  Only a few areas have made any progress.  Some land
 reform committees in Yunnan '!treated reform as a sort of experiment," and did not
 carry it out fully.   Plans call for reform in 355 hsiang in April of next year.
 Yet in the best season, January to March, only 129 hsiang were reformed last year.
 Not all difficulties have been in the Southwest, however.  Hangcbow (18 Dec.)
 charged chu cadres in Yuhang Hsien, Chekiang, with laxity, and revealed that in
 Jenan Chu only seven percentlof the reformed land was under cultivation, while in
 Jenmin Chu only half of it could be worked because only 2,2u0 oxen were available
 for 200,000 mou of land.

 A Pek1ig Home Service program (24 Der;.) carrying a report from Taiyuan revealed that
 in Shansi Province, state farms harvested better crops than did peasants on their
 individual holdings, and asserted that farmers were "impressed by the new farming
 implements and scientific cultivation."  This might be an indication that land
 reform as it has been practiced will soon give way in some areas to a system of
 collective farming.
 Marriage Law:  Considerable attention is still being given to the marriage law,
 with reports of punishment for violations, broadcast illustrations of the evils
 of the old marriage customs, and the issuance of general informational publicity.
 It appears that more attention is being given to a systematic training, especially
 of cadres, and less attention to the pi-.iishment of offenders.
 Shanghai (14 Dec.) declared that cadres and the masses have a better understanding
 of the law since a series of six talks was presented over the Hangchow radio.  Round-
 table discussions also helped, and 50,000 letters, messages and phone calls were
 received by the sponsors of the talks.  Chu Kung-lien of Hsiengshan Hsien, Chekiang,
 as a result of her new information on the marriage law, has preferred charges against
 local cadres for laxity in enforcement.  Wuhsi (15 Dec.) reported that the Women's
 Democratic League of Soochow examined cadres of knowledge of the law, and dis-
 covered that the average grade was only 76, while several failed the test entirely.
 Tsinan (15 Dec.) reported that in Kaoyiian Hsien, Shantung, cadres now are given?
 regular examinations on the marriage law.  Canton (21 Dec.) announced that speakers
 on the marriage law would appear on 21-25 December at seven places in Canton and
 its suburbs.   Chinchow (20 Dec.) reported a conference of Liaosi rural cadres to
 study the marriage law.   Dairen (16 Dec.) announced that 28 new-type marriages
 recently took place in one village. Wuhsi (19 Dec.) told of a mass marriage in
 Soochow, with 21 couples wedded.  "Instead of wasting money on weddings, these
 young people saved their money to buy fertilizer and farm equipment."
 Examples of the evils of the old law were contained in a Hangchow broadcast (23 Dec.)
 concerning an "anti-feudalistic marriage rally" 20 December by women workers of the
 Fuhua No. 1 Silk Mill.  Chiang I-ling testified that she became a concubine at 14,
 was resold twice in one year, tried to commit suicide three times, and was forced to
 commit infanticide three times.  Yu King-feng testified that she was forced to
 marry a tubercular and contracted the disease.  Her husband died, but she was not
 permitted to remarry. Chinchow (13 Dec.) broadcast the story of Yu Feng-ying, Sanking
 village, Fifth Chu, Shuangliao lisien, Liaosi, who was forced by her father to marry
 Chen Chien-Chung, who sold her to Wang Feng-shan as a concubine.  After the
 liberation she was granted a divorce and became a member of the counterrevolutionary
 suppression committee. Hangchow (20 Dec.) told the story of Wu Chang-tse, Penta
 village, Wuting Hsiang, Changsze Chu, Twu Hsien, Chekiang, who was forced by her
 parents to marry at 16.  After four years she petitioned for a divorce, but the
 cadres refused to discuss her case,  and attacked her reputation instead.  Finally
 she committed suicide.
 Wuhsi (17  Dec.) announced that Chang  Chi-ping had been sentenced to prison for
 five years by the Changshu People's Court for mistreating his wife, Hsu Hsi.
 Yangchow (13 Dec.) reported that Chen Fu-Chang, Kangshan Chu, Tai Hsien, Kiangsu,
 was sentenced to death for the murder of his wife, Chu Feng-ying, who-was betrothed
 to him at the age of five.  His accomplices, Chen Wang-chi and Chu Y1.1-chu, were
 given prison terms.  Tsinan (15 Dec.) reported that King Pao-yu was sentenced to
 death at a public trial attended by 30,000 persons, and executed iumnediately.  He
 was accused of beating his wife, King Wen-sze, for burning too much firewood and
 for not working bard enough after childbirth.  As her feudalistic parents would not
 take her in when she returned home,  she drowned herself in the canal.  Hangchow
 (21 Dec.) reported the sentencing to death of Chien Wei-hsiang 30 N.vember for
 murdering his wife, Wang Ai-lien of Tashan Hsiang, Tashan Chu, Iwu Hsien, Chekiang,
 when she carelessly killed a chicken.  She had been sold by her parents for two
 suits of old clothes when she was 17.  Her husband sold her to another farmer for
 4.5 million yuan, who later traded her to Chien for five tan of rice.
