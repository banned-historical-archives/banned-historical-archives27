TEN YEARS OF CHINESE COMMUNIST FOREIGN POLICY 
Section II ? South and Southeast Asia 
Introduction 
Revolutionary and national interests always have 
been present in Mao Tse-tung's foreign policy as conflict-
ing elements. His revolutionary compulsion (as well as 
his craving for adula.,:ion) has been detrimental to national 
interests, but he will not (or cannot) abandon this course. 
On occasion, however, he has partially suppressed it, the 
most important nstance having been the period from 1954-
65 in relations with countries in the Far East. 
As early as December 1936, Mao believed that his 
revolution should "exert a far-reaching influence on the 
revolution in the East as well as in the whole world" 
(Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War). This 
personal desire was later made national policy, and Liu 
Shao-chi insisted on 16 November 1949 that Mao's "road" 
of guerrilla war should be the model for all Communist-
led revolutions in "colonial and semi-colonial" countries, 
his apparent immediate concern having been the insurgencies 
in Southeast Asia. (Speech to the Trade Union Conference 
of Asian and Australasian Countries in Peking) But side 
by side with this policy of openly encouraging revolu-
tion was to be Mao's dawning recognition of the fact that 
Communist-led insurrections, so far from spreading like 
a prairie fire throughout the area, were making no rapid 
progress beyond Vietnam. More importantly, he began to 
recognize that an explicitly revolutionary policy could 
result in the establishment of a new American presence, 
beyond Korea and near Chinese borders in Indo-China. The 
advent of a less doctrinaire Soviet leadership after 
Stalin's death (March 1953), the end of the Korean war

(July 1953), the desire to rehabilitate the economy of 
his regime, and Washington's clearly expressed determina-
tion to prevent by containment any new Communist aggres-
sion in Asia helped to erode the prospects for a revolu-
tionary advance and to convince him of the need to shift 
to a more moderate tand internationally more acceptable) 
policy. A new nonrevolutionary strategy was formulated 
in order to attract rather than repel the non-Communist 
leaders of states on the mainland's periphery, and by 
1954 Mao's revolutionary compulsion had been partially 
suppressed, displaced by his desire to ensure national 
security and attain "great power" status for his regime. 
After the spring of 1954, Mao permitted Chou En-
lai to advance a policy of assurance-against-subversion 
toward governments which, he believed, might otherwise 
have permitted American forces to establish bases near 
the mainland's borders. A key principle of Chou 's five 
principles of peaceful coexistence (which he set forth 
with Nehru in April 1954) was used to try to assure near-
by governments that Peking's policy was one of "non-
interference" in their internal affairs.* "China has no 
*In his speech of 1 October 1949, Mao had not given 
such an assurance and discussed only the principles of 
"equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for terri-
torial integrity and sovereignty" in relations among na-
tions. Chou's five principles were 
(1) mutual respect for each other's territorial 
integrity and sovereignty. 
(2) mutual non-aggression. 
(3) mutual non interference in each other's  
internal affairs, 
(4) equality and mutual benefit, and 
(5) peaceful coexistence. 
Principle (3) was to be cited in 1967 as the one the Chi-
nese leaders had violated 'n trying to impose W,ao's "thought" 
on Cambodians. Sihanouk publicly complained on 11 Septem-
ber 1967 that a message from Peking to the Cambodian-Chi-
nese Friendship Association was "an extraordinary inter-
ference in the affairs of a sovereign state," and on 12

intention whatsoever to subvert the government of its 
neighboring countr;es." (Chou 's speech at the Afro-Asian 
Conference at Bandung on 19 April 1955) This new strategy 
was designed to encourage neutralism, and neutral countries 
were, in turn, to become parts of a continuous territorial 
buffer preventing "encirclement" of the mainland. The 
antidote to the American policy of containment--depicted 
at various times as an effort to "encircle and blockade" 
(Marshal Yeh Chien ying's phrase of 6 October 1950) or 
to "encircle and isolate" the mainland (Mao's phrase re 
ported on 23 February 1961)--was to be Mao's implicit 
admission that diplomacy could be more useful than revolu-
tion. Mao began to reduce Peking's support for Communist 
revolutionaries in these countries in the second half of 
1951. Further, he permitted Chou to assure non-Communist 
leaders that local Overseas Chinese in their countries 
would not be organized and exploited as a subversive wea-
pon against their national regimes and internal (or for-
eign)policies. In short, he permitted Chou to adopt 
tactics of considerateness (that is, diplomatically "cor-
rect" tactics) in observing the nationalistic sensitivi-
ties of these leaders. 
I, Two Types of Neutral Neighbors 
Mao and his aides did not view these governments 
as one homogenous or undifferentiated group of neutrals, 
and they clearly indicated their preference for the poli-
cies of those countries which were involved in Mao's anti-
(footnote continued from page 2) 
September, he stated that Peking's action "is contrary 
to the peaceful coexistence principles which you set forth. 
in 1955. You claimed that peaceful coexistence means 
mutual respect without intervening in the affairs of 
others..." On 1 November 1967, Sihanouk announced that 
Chou had reassured him (in a message) on precisely the 
non-intervention principle.

Americanism--viz.. Cambodia and Indones'a. Those which 
were not involved--viz., Burma, Nepal, Afghanistan, and 
Ceylon--were nevertheless treated as if they were part 
of an anti-American front, or were on the way to becoming 
part of such a common bloc. They viewed Pakistan as a 
special case--that is, as a quasi-ally which was useful 
in opposing India, the latter having been transformed in 
1959 into a major enemy. They treated with va:ying degrees 
of contempt their old enemies--viz., Thailand, Malaya, and 
the Philippines--but were reluctant to call for the over-
throw of these gcvernments until the 1966-67 period. 
Chou was convincing when he repeatedly insisted that, 
even toward counilries aligned with the U, S. or otherwise 
hostile to Peking, the Chinese Communist leaders had no 
interest in the political character of the internal regime 
but only in the foreign relations between nearby countries 
and the mainland government. 
Mao's idea of a "genuinely" neutral country was 
one that would not oppose his policies and would not per-
mit LloS bases on its territory. Even after some tensions 
had developed in relations with several leaders of nearby 
countries, his criteria for considering them as acceptable 
neutilAs was sustained. Chen Y made the definitive state-
ment on the mat tee to Japanese newsmen in an interview 
of 29 May 1962' 
The eountries that truly adopt a policy of 
peace and neutrality, maintain peaceful con-
tactE with all countries, maintain friendly 
ties with China, and call for peaceful co-
existence with countries which have different 
ideologies and social systems, namely, Nepal, 
Afghanistan, Cambodia, Burma, and Indonesia, 
are not being occupied by the U.S But the 
countries that call for opposition to Commun-
ist China are receiving U.S. imperialism, 
offering military bases to the U.S., and 
consequently are receiving the wolf into 
their homes....The genuine peaceful and 
neutral countries mentioned above do not 
need U.S. 'protection' or occupation be-

a 
peaceful coexistence and because their 
internal order is in good shape. 
However, the record of his relations with these countries 
indicates that he has made a distinction between differ-
ent kinds of neutrals, prefering those wh'ch are involved 
with his anti-Americanism and which are assertive in op-
posing Washingtn's policies. 
A. Asian Countries Involved with Mao's Anti-Americanism 
1. Cambodia 
Mao was pleased with Sihanouk for staying out of 
SEATO and for opposing a SEATO member, Thailand, and an 
old enemy, South Vietnam. He was to become even more 
pleased with Cambodia's chief of state for actions to 
eliminate the U.S presence in Phnom Penh.* Although 
Chou En-lai had been tactful, since his February 1956 
discussions, in moving Sihanouk away from the West and 
toward neutralism and although he had attained recogni-
tion for the Peking regime (in July 1958, when Sihanouk 
was rebuked in Bangkok and felt threatened by Thailand 
and South Vietnam), he had warned the Cambodian leader 
that Peking would not make problems for him "unless Cam-
bodia permitted the entry of U,S, troops." Sihanouk. in 
*Mao is reported to have expressed admiration, 
on 31 March 
1964, over the way in which Sihanouk had put an end to 
U,S, aid and was ready to face the "reactions of the im-
perialists in all their forms." On 10 September 1964, 
Mao described Cambodia  as a good 
example of a "truly" neutral state, and in late September 
1965, Mao made Sihanouk an honorary Communist by saying 
he was "very, very red" and "my comrade" because "like 
me, you are struggling against the imperialists." (Cited 
in Sihanouk speech of 17 October 1965)

his Tokyo press conference in late October 1961, had at-
tributed this remark of Chou's to some unspecified time 
"in the past"--apparently a remark made by Chou either 
in Cambodia in early May 1960 or in Peking in December 
1960, when Sihanouk signed a nonaggress on treaty. In 
1960, Sihanouk sent his three sons to study on the main-
land--another sign to the Chinese leaders that he wanted 
them to act as his defenders. By that time, it was clear 
to the Chinese that Sihanouk looked to Peking rather than 
Washington for military support, and Sino-Cambodian rela-
tions centered on the basic matter of whether Sihanouk 
was to be given a clear statement of commitment to defend 
Cambodia from Thai and Vietnamese incursions. Chou's 
task was to string him along with statements which implied 
such a commitment, but never explicitly declared it. When, 
on 5 November 1962, Sihanouk complained in Phnom Penh that 
"some American circles even here" talk of a much harder 
US, policy toward Cambodia, he publicly insisted that 
this wculd not work because the Chinese Communist ambas-
sador "this morning" had assured him that Cambodia "in 
no case would be abandoned" (as Khrushchev had abandoned 
Cuba). Actually, Sihanou was aware that the PLA would 
not be used to help him. His practice had been to imply, 
or even directly claim, that the Chinese would intervene 
militarily to defend his regime. But he has also publicly 
admitted that on at least one occasion--namely, his diplo-
matic break with Thailand in October 1961--"I made believe 
there was someone behind me to support me. Actually, there 
was no one at that moment." (Sihanouk speech of late 
November 1961)

  Chou /Joined 
Mao in waYning Sihanouk of a plot to overthrow him, estab-
lishing a status of credibility with the Cambodian leader? 
"Mr, Mao Tse-tung himself asked me to do my best to avoid 
being overthrown. Mr. Chou En-lai. ..asked me to be careful 
because 'something is being prepared against you. 
(Sihanouk speech of 28 February 1963) Sihanouk was sur-
prised and delighted that Mao and Chou would alert him 
to a maneuver to Wtich the prestige of the small crypto-
Communist Pracheachon (People's Party) and other left-
ists were committed. But maintenance of an apologist 
for Peking, as Sihanouk had then become, was more important 
to Mao and Chou than the prospects in Cambodia of leftist 
comrades. Liu Shao-chi tried to sustain Peking's influ-
ence, and he visited Cambodia within one month (in May 
1963) after Sihanouk had concluded a miljtary aid agree-
ment?his first with a bloc country?wit the USSR. 
By the fall of 1963, the Chinese leaders had at-
tained a good understanding of Sihanouk's personality, 
appraising him as a leader highly susceptible to flattery 
but also emotionally unstable and anxious to involve them 
in fighting his battles, political and military. When, 
therefore, on 5 November 1963, Sihanouk declared his in-
tention to replace U.S, ass:stance with aid from Peking, 
they took their time and calculated the risks they might 
incur if they moved too rapidly to defend him during his 
political rampage against the U.S. By 21 November, they 
apparently believed that a response would not entail 
military risks; they belatedly and cautiously pledged 
"all-out support" (not direct PLA involvement) in the 
event Cambodia were to be invaded* and concluded the first 
military aid agreement between the two countries (Peking's

if the Kingdom of Cambodia which has persevered in its

ment was concluded with Phnom Penh in mid-1956) in December 
1963. Further, the long-pending Sino Cambodian civil air 
agreement was signed on 25 November. Lavish flattery of 
Sihanouk and successive military aid agreements--in October 
1964 and November 1965--were used by the Chinese leaders 
to try to obscure the ambiguity on the precise nature of 
their commitment to Cambodia. Sihanouk was useful to 
them partly because of his temperamental outbursts against 
the U.S. (and later against the USSR), but for this same 
reason they were careful to retain some leeway so that 
their actions would not be conditioned upon his unstable 
temperament 
As Sihanouk became aware of this sustained ambi-
guity, they had to work hard to "explain" their unwilling-
ness to use the PLA to defend Cambodian territory. When, 
on 10 April, Sihanouk complained about Chou's apparent 
reluctance to impell Souvanna Phouma to recognize Cam-
bodia's territorial integrity in the Sino-Laotian communi-
que of 8 April, (Sihanouk having said that now "we cannot

of 21 November 1963) Sihanouk later tried to make Peking's 
commitment appear total and unconditionaL "In its Novem-
ber 1963 statement...China...promised that it is ready 
to brin7, all necessary assistance to Cambodia...and this 
assistance will be unconditional." (Sihanouk speech 15 
March 1964) Nevertheless, major Chinese spokesmen held 
closely to the vague formulation, as witness Lo Jui-ching's 
faithful reiteration of it in his speech of greeting to 
the Cambodian military delegation in Peking on 13 March 
1964. At the same time, Peking Radio did not report 
Sihanouk's 11 March statement that in the event of at-
tack, the PRC "will help us in accordance with her written 
promise." At a later date, the Chinese remained silent 
about another Sihanoukian exaggeration, namely, his state-
ment on 4 January 1966 that if war is forced upon Cambodia, 
Peking "has promised that it will come to Cambodia's aid, 
not only w4th arms but with volunteer troops as they 
did during the Korean war."

Yi in mid-April tried to get the Cambodian delegate to 
the Afro-Asian conference in Djakarta to believe that he 
(Chen) had warned Souvanna in Peking that the PRC would 
not allow anyone to trouble Cambodia. 
Mr. Chen Yi also warned? 'Take care not to 
invade Khmer territory, as People's China will 
not permit such an act. I warn you that if 
you dare trouble Cambodia, People's China will 
surely come to Cambodia's aid.' Then, Prince 
Souvanna Phouma asked Mr. Chen Yi what road 
China would take to help Cambodia, which is 
so far from China. Mr. Chen Yi replied that 
he wr,uld send aid to Cambodia through North 
Vietnam and that by crossing part of Laotian 
territory, the Chinese would be able to reach 
Cambodia. On hearing this answer, Prince 
Souvanna Phouma found out that things would 
not go well for him and that there would be 
no hope for him.* 
When our military delegation...was visiting 
People's China, Mr, Mao Tse-tung, father of 
China, clearly stated (on 31 March 1964) that 
if someone dared attack Cambodia. People's 
China surely w.uld side with the Khmer to 
check the enemy. (Sihanouk's speech of 19

Actually, even Chou's alleged promise of 4 October 
did not provide Sihanouk with a significantly greater 
degree of protection from Cambodia's traditional enemies, 
and the Chinese eaders did not bind themselves (despite 
Sihanouk's efforts) to do anything more than they desired 
for him. They apparently believed that Saigon vould not 
take the risk of launching an all-out attack against Cam-
bod'a and that Sihanouk could be convinced that small 
patrol clashes could be handled by his own forces without 
PLA intervention. When, therefore, Sihanouk on 26 October

1964) side-stepped Sihanouk's more extreme pronounce-
ments on acts of war and went only the same distance they 
had gone before in promising ncthing more than "all-out 
support" for the struggle" of the Cambodian people."* 
At no great cost--i.e., political support for Cam-
bodia's border policy and the provision of military equip-
ment--the Chinese gained from Sihanouk political assist-
ance. At the Colombo Conference in December 1962, he 
adopted Peking's position on the border dispute with 
India; in May 1963, he sign-3d a "friendship" treaty (but 
Mao would not give him a military defense treaty), in 
July 1963, he refused to sign and disparaged the nuclear 
test-ban agreement, in August and September 1964, he sup-
ported Peking's position on the Gulf of Tonkin incidents, 
in October 1964, hr praised the explosion of Peking's 
first nuclear device, and in May 1965, he pleased Mao by 
breaking diplomatic relations w'th Washington. 
More than any other Chinese leader, Chou En-lai 
had the job of feeding his ego and retaining his goodwill. 
*Even the ebullient Chen Yi chose h's words carefully 
in Phnom Penh on 13 November 1964 when he specified pub-
licly that Peking would provide "all-out support" if "the 
imperialist aggressors dare to invade Cambodia on a mas-
sive scale," the implication being that anything less 
than a "massive scale" invasion, such as an isolated air 
strike or patrol clash, would leave the Chinese free to 
decide the form and scale of their "supnort." 
Later, when the Chinese felt impelled to give the 
impression that they were strengthening their vague com-
mitment to Cambodia, responding to Washington's refer-
ence to "hot pursuit" of the Viet Cong over the Cambodian 
border, they first cited a strong statement by Sihanouk 
(with apparent approval) and then merely repeated their 
own position which did not refer to Chinese fighting Ameri-
cans. (People's Daily editorial of 24 December 1965) 
Adopting the phrase, "rear shield," used in deterrent 
statements on Vietnam in February 1965, they made it 
clear to the ILS, that they would not intervene.

Chou, described by Sihanouk as the "great genius" (speech 
of 27 December 1964), handled the details of Peking's 
military aid program to Phnom Penh.* He provided him 
with advice on uniquely Cambodian problems. For example, 
Chou caut oned Sihanouk to be "careful" in deciding whether 
to sign an agreement with Hanoi and the Liberation Front 
regarding their recognition of Cambodia's frontiers, the 
assumed danger for Phnom Penh being the prospective Ameri-
can reaction. Chou referred to the importance of neutrality 
for Cambodia which, unlike Algeria and Indonesia, had to 
contend with "the Americans and their lackeys in Saigon 
nearby." (Sihanouk speech of 27 December 1964) Chou had 
to act against his desires in March 1965, expressing 
Peking's refusal to support an international conference 
on Cambodia (as a venue for possible Hanoi-Washington 
talks), but on 20 May 1965, after Sihanouk had severed 
diplomatic relations with the US , Chou effusively praised 
him, pointing to those parts of Sihanouk's "righteous 
and stirring speech" of 17 May w!tich, in fact, complied 
with Peking's position on a wide range of issues, 'nclud-
ing an attack on the UN. Chou was joined by other lead 
ers during Sihanouk's last visit to the mainland in October 
1965, the effort having been to sustain his anti-American-
ism and deter him from looking for aid from Moscow. 
Chen Yi met him on the way out in Kunming and in-
sisted that he stand clear of the U.S. Referring to Chen 's 
"advice," Sihanouk later stated that 
China told us frankly that if we change our 
attitude toward the Americans, China will 
change its attitude toward us. This is normal. 
because the Chinese like us less than they 
do their own interests. (Sihanouk speech of

Publicly, Chen Yi praised the Cambodian chief of state's 
hostile attitude toward the US,* The Chinese leaders 
were delighted that, as a result of Sihanouk's adoption 
of several CCP positions in the dispute with the CPSU, 
he was rebuked by the Soviet leaders (the Soviet ambas-
sador treated him with designed contempt in Pyongyang 
during a side-trip there in early October 1965), and Liu 
Shao-chi and Chen Yi professed to him their view that this 
behavior reflected the long-term process whereby the 
Soviets were "becoming Americans." Mao and Liu warned 
him against accepting aid either from the Russians or the 
Amerlcans, insisting that "It is not a good solution to 
rely on foreign aid and loans for building a country... 
we hope that your country...will only have commercial  
relations with foreign countries..." (Sihanouk speech 
of 17 October 1965, (emphasis supplied). Sihanouk had 
seemed to them at the time to accept their advice.** 
*"I greatly admire the statement made by Prince Sihanouk 
when he was in Peking- that if there were some 15 coun-
tries in the world that followed the line of non-coopera-
tion toward U.S, imperialism, refused to provide it with 
military bases, and forbade its aircraft and ships to use 
their airfields and ports, this would be enough to force 
U.S. imperialism to .etreat. This is a correct appraisal " 
(Kunming speech of 13 October 1965 at end of Sihanouk's 
visit) Unintentionally, Chen had admitted that the num-
ber of countries which the Chinese leaders could induce 
to join Mao's anti-American "united front" was smaller 
than 15, and probably far smaller. 
**After citing Liu Shao-chi's advice to "Try to advance, 
but slowly by relying on your own means," Sihanouk pro-
nounced the Chinese leader to be "correct...1 think we 
must surmount the difficulties by ourselves instead of 
relying on the aid of the big powers. This is clearly 
proven by our relations wj.th the Americans and the Rus-
sians." (Sihanouk speech of 25 October 1965) Mao and 
his aides were clearly aware that Mosc^w and Washington 
easily could defeat him in a direct competition to provide 
enonomic aid to Sihanouk's government and other under-
developed countries, and for several years they had been

Within six months, however, he discarded it, and 
on 18 March 1966, his aides signed in Moscow a Soviet-
initiated protocol for $2.3 million worth of military 
materiel. Sihanouk paraded the Soviet aid agreement--"the 
world is amazed, but we did it -and he claimed that 
Peking had accepted Cambodia's "renewal of friendship' 
with the Soviet Union without any comment or interfer-
ence, (Statements Sihanouk made to Singapore's Prime 
Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 11 April 1966) While not making 
immediate demands on Sihanouk or revealing his contempt 
for the independent action of the leader who had acted 
as Peking's political toady, Mao apparently began to view 
him as a duplicitous and opportunistic trafficker with 
the "revisionists." Sihanouk's action had made Mao's 
judgment look bad, as Mao had been more effusive in praise 
of the Cambodian chief of state than any other Chinese 
Communist leader and was suddenly impelled to reconsider 
that praise. 
The decision of Mao ad his aides following the 
signing of the Soviet-Cambodian aid protocol seems to have 
been to avoid priming the temperamental leader with special 
deference, but to try to pull him back from increased con-
tacts with the Soviets and the Western powers. They ap-
parently were aware that he was beginning to examine the 
feasibility of returning to a basic policy of a rapproche-
ment with the West. But tensions began to develop and 
when, on 26 April 1966, Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien arrived 
(footnote continued from page 14) 
trying to persuade leaders in these countries to rely on 
their own resources. Even after Chou En-lai expounded 
his eight principles of foreign aid (January 1964), the 
Chinese continued to suggest that their capability to pro-
vide aid was limited. "Of course, our country's economic 
strength is not yet great and our country's foreign aid 
is on a limited scale because it was not very long ago 
that our country started its own construction." (Nan 
Han-chen statement of 20 June 1964 to Asian Economic 
Seminar in Pyongyang)

in Phnom Penh to conclude an economic and cultilral coopera-
tion agreement (initialed on 29 April and designating 
factory equipment for Cambodia), he implied that frictions 
were present and insisted that Sino-Cambodian friendship 
"can stand all tests." 
At some point between June and August 1966, Sihanouk 
apparently decided that it would be safer than it ever 
had been for him to criticize Peking openly and directly.* 
He began to complain that in September-October 1965 during 
his mainland trip the Chinese leaders had used their pe-
culiar logic on him to keep Cambodia poor, and he stated 
sarcastically in August 1966 that "the Chinese policy of 
'Let us be as poor as possible as long as possible,' is 
not for Cambodia." He ranged over other issues. Speak-
ing publicly, he insisted that "Since even China [at 
Warsaw] does not refuse talks, we will not refuse talks 
with Harriman"--later, he refused--and he complained that 
'China will not intervene physically in our favor' in the 
event of outside attack. (Statements of 8 August 1966)** 
*He had begun to criticize Peking indirectly in mid-
Ma; 1966 when he quietly published the text of one of his 
talks with Mao (October 1965), his apparent intention 
being to demonstrate that Mao had made it clear that Pek-
ing would not provide Phnom Penh with significant addi-
tional aid. 
**For this boldness, he was rewarded with a demand from 
Peking that he refuse to meet with Harriman/ 
He was 
also antagonized by the heavy adivce of the Chinese lead-
ers when they attacked his proposal for strengthening the 
IQC--an action which, Sihanouk believed, wuuld reduce the 
likelihood of US, and South Vietnamese punitive military 
operations across his borders and would limit the size 
of Vietnamese Communist forces on Cambodian territory. 
In mid. August, the government press in Phnom Penh reflected 
Sihanouk's contempt for Peking's position by publishing 
his proposal side-by-side with the Chinese depiction of 
it as "an American imperialist plot."

Mao's purge on the mainland had induced in Sihanouk an 
attitude of olitspokeness, inasmuch as he believed that 
mainland developments were holding the attention oi the 
Chinese dictator on internal rather than external policy 
to an unprecedented degree. He was even emboldened to 
take what he considered to be a form of retaliatory  
action.  
Although increasingly outspoken, Sihanouk was still 
aware that the Chinese leaders could provide the only 
counterweight to the American presence in the area, that 
their political goodwill was still important even in a 
reduced amount, and that they would st411 respond favor-
ably to his anti-Americanism. In October 1966, Sihanouk 
reacted to press reports that he was "swinging back" toward 
the West, and he sustained public attacks on the U.S. 
defending Communist positions on a whole range of issues 
including that of the Vietnam war.* When, therefore, in 
the fall of 1966, the Mao-Sihanouk relationship became 
increasingly cool, appearances of friendship were sus-
tained by both sides. Sihanouk's son, studying in Peking, 
was given preferential treatment when, in September 1966, 
he was assigned special teachers after most foreign students 
had been told to leave the mainland. Mutual adulation 
was intended to show that relations had not deteriorated. 
On 8 November 1966, Sihanouk's son appraised Mao's purge 
as "good" at the reception where Chen Yi described his

father as the leader who "dares to sever diplomatic rela-
tions with the U,S_, dares to reject U.S. aid, dares to 
build the country in the spirit of self-reliance, and is 
not dependent on foreign aid that has political conditions." 
Chen was implicitly advising Sihanouk that he could count 
on Peking's good will only so long as his opposition to 
Washington was sustained. In line with this policy, 
Madame Chen Yi projected an appearance of good will during 
her visit to Cambodia in early November. For his part, 
Sihanouk returned the flattery of Peking, praising Mao's 
purge in mid-February 1967 in Paris and receiving re-
ciprocal flattery from NCNA on 25 February 1967. And when, 
in early April 1967, he acted to crush Khmer dissidents 
and assured Peking that he would remain "neutral" in his 
foreign policy, Peking reported with approval his anti-
American letter to an American newspaper. (NCNA dispatch 
of 9 May 1967) 
on 9 May, Sihanouk complained publicly about 
Communist subversion and insisted that several newspapers 
had been supplied with funds from unspecified foreign Com-
munists. On 15 May, he came closer to a charge of sub-
version from the outside (i.e. from Peking). In a radio 
speech, he disclosed that certain Chinese in Cambod'a 
were guilty of various abuses, particularly concerning

currency exchange, contraband, and subversion. He said 
that Prime Minister Son Sann had just revealed to him the 
names of two Chinese residents guilty of these crimes. 
One of these had left for the mainland, and he had asked 
that he should not return to Cambodia. The second was 
involved in the currency black market and was the head 
of the contraband movement, and he had decided to expel 
him from the country. Sihanouk went on to say that sub-
version by Chinese Communist elements in Cambodia, carried 
out from the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association and 
other academic establishments was a well-known fact. He 
said that Minister for National Security Dy Bellong had 
provided him with details about this and that he was con-
ducting further investigations. He ended by saying that 
there was no proof at all that any Chinese official or 
the Chinese embassy was responsible for this subversion, 
but the implication of his entire presentation was that 
he was not far from acquiring such proof. 
Sihanouk's 15 May speech sparked a series of arti-
cles in the Cambodian press critical of Peking and un-
preced(nted in explicitly accusing Chinese Communists of 
a whole range of subversive activities in Cambodia. The 
revolutionized officials in the Chinese embassy struck 
back by publishing two letters (on 22 and 28 May respec-
tively, the latter having been an "open letter" to the 
Cambodian press), attacking the anti-Peking articles and 
provoking counter-articles. On 30 May, the revolutionized 
Chinese embassy was implicated by the Cambodians for shield-
ing pro-Communists and was again publicly accused of 
subversion by one publication. Peking did not refer to 
this escalating dispute or to the letters of its embassy 
in Phnom Penh. However, it began to disseminate tributes 
to Mao which were to become offensive to Cambodian nation-
alistic sensibilities. On 31 May. NCNA claimed in a 
dispatch that the "Cambodian working class" considered 
Mao to be the supreme commander of the world's peoples.

North Vietnam complied--on 31 May and on 6 and 8 June, 
in that order. (Sihanouk established diplomatic relations 
with Ho's regime on 15 June.) Mao was confronted with 
the choice of (1) rewarding Sihanouk, who was impeding 
dissemination of his "thought" among Cambodians and traf-
ficking with the "revisionists" or (2) punishing Sihanouk 
by refusing to comply. His apparent decision was not to 
comply. Mao apparently found it particularly difficult 
to accept independent (and, on occasion, anti-Chinese) 
actions from a man who had been a complete toady for many 
years in relations with Peking.* Further, Mao was engaged 
in the process of "revolutionizing" his Foreign Miziistry, 
having turned Red Guards loose in it, and submission tp 
the request of a "feudal" prince (Sihanouk) would have 
appeared, at that time, to be a nonrevolutionary act. For 
these reasons, Mao apparently rejected the more rational 
consideration that he could not for long avoid complying. 
His ally, Ho, had complied; his opponents, the Soviet 
leaders, also had complied. But he refused despite the 
isolated position in which the refusal placed him. Becoming 
*Mao's increasing annoyance with Sihanouk's independent 
actions against his policies (and against Chinese embassy 
activities in Cambodia) was reflected in items printed 
in May and July 1967 in a  news bul- 25X1

ing Sihanouk's letter of gratitude to Gromyko in early 
June on Moscow's decision to "recognize" Cambodian front-
iers, suppression of the revolt in Battambang province, 
measures to restrict spread of the Mao-cult in Overseas 
Chinese private schools, Sihanouk's criticism of the sub-
versive activities of certain foreign-aid technicians, 
and Phnom Penh's concern over excessive influence of the 
Chinese embas3y in the Overseas Chinese community. This 
material almost certainly would have been used against 
Sihanouk if Chou had not convinced Mao in September 19S7 
that the prince was still very anti-American.

increasingly bold and deLreasingly a toady, Sihanouk 
used the opportunity of Soviet recognition to criticize 
Mao's stand against recognition? he publicly ridiculed 
Peking's private explanation for "hesitating"--namely, 
because of fear of the Thai and the Vietnamese. (Sihanouk 
speech of 7 June 1967) As an additional factor contribut-
ing to Mao's footdragging, he probably had been angered 
by Hanoi's independent act of recognition, as it suggested 
that Sihanouk had used Ho against him. Moreover, Ho, in 
Mao's apparent view, had cooperated with Aloscow and Phnom 
Penh, but not with Peking. (For his part, Ho probably 
was irritated because Mao was creating political problems 
with Cambodia at a time when it was necessary to sustain 
Sihanouk's acquiescence in the use of Cambodia's border 
areas as military sanctuaries and the country as a logistic 
base.) 
It should have been clear to Mao--it almost cer-
tainly was clear to Chou En lai--that he could not con-
tinue indefinitely to refuse to take an action which Hanoi 
and Moscow had taken and which Sinanouk was using to ri-
dicule his regime. On 13 June, Mao made a small but slip-
pery concession? Peking's Foreign Ministry statement on 
that day "reaffirmed" that the PRC "fully respects the 
territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia in her 
present borders." This was no more than saying that Mao 
"respects" the frontier in physical terms (just as he 
"respects" the Sino-Soviet border and will not step over 
it) but does not recognize its validity as an interna-
tionally accepted frontier at all points. He was still 
punishing Sihanouk and he was refusing to permit the 
leader of such a small country to out-maneuver the leader 
of such a big one. Mao sustained this attitude until 31 
July 1967, when the charge of the Chinese embassy in Phnom 
Penh finally was directed to inform the Cambodians that 
Peking "recognizes" the present territorial frontiers of 
Cambodia. Chou may have been the moving force in this 
action, and he may have guided Mao back to rationality by 
reminding him that Cambodia was a source of supplies for 
the Viet Congg-and a sanctuary for them.* He almost

certainly alerted Mao to the need to dissociate Peking 
from the 10 July U.S. statement of "respect" for Khmer 
territorial integrity (as well as from Peking's earlier 
position). He almost certainly reported to Mao that 
Sihanouk was still anti-American, and it was Cambodia's 
struggle against the U.S. which Cnen Yi praised when he 
said he was "adhering to Chairman Mao's teachings" in 
supporting Phnom Penh. (Chen Yi speech of 18 August 1967)* 
The effort of Chou and Chen to retain Sihanouk's 
good will was made within the new guidelines of a fanatical 
policy derived basically from Mao's insatiable craving 
for adulation, In this case, it was a matter of interna-
tional adulation and not only domestic cultist praise for 
his "thought," There apparently was a dispute among the 
Chinese leaders during Mao's purge regarding disseminat-
ing the Mao-cut and its applicability to revolutionary 
movements outside the mainland. Chen Yi seems to have 
been irascibly outspoken in opposing Mao's apparent desire

"Recognition," however, has not provided Sihanouk with 
a border treaty which delineates the precise alignment 
of the frontier. Hanoi is not willing to provide him 
with such a firm acceptance of his territorial claims. 
*Chen Yi referred explicitly to the common cause in 
opposing the U,S, but avoided mentioning the discarded 
principle of mutual non-interference in the internal af-
fairs of each country. Actually, he had joined Chou and 
Vice Foreign Minister Han Nien-lung in their effort to 
induce the visiting Cambodian foreign minister to gain 
Sihanouk's acquiescence in the Chinese embassy's right 
to disseminate the symbols of Mao's cult. That is, he 
was engaged with Chou in asking for the right to interfere  
in Cambodia's internal affairs.

partments in and connected with the Foreign Ministry.

thought is a completely Chinese thing. We do not want 
to tae it abroad, If we do, people will say that this 
is not our thing and we do not want it. In that case, 
what can we do?'" "Even as late as 1967" Chen Yi said 
that "I do not agree with reading Mao quotations abroad 
and presentAng Mao badges." (Items in Red Guard Newspaper  
of 15 September 1967) However, shortly after he had been

policies among Cambodians. When, on 1 September, Sihanouk 
dissolved the Cambodia-Chinese Friendship Association 
for "subversive acti.vities," the Chinese leaders further  
angered the Cambodian chief of state by sending a message 
to the Association on 4 September referring to "reaction-

the PRC's "first attack.,.an official attack" on Cambodia

a sovereign state." "It is possible for a state to cri-

Sihanouk's various statements in mid-September 1967 
suggest a sequence of events in which Chou had to imple-

continued dissemination in Cambodia of Mao's cult and 
support for continued Sino-Cambodian diplomatic relations.

"promise" (date unspecified, but probably in October 1965) 
to prevent an increase in Chinese Communist subversive 
activities among Cambodians, especially as engaged in by 
embassy officials in making local contacts. Sihanouk 
was angered by security information that "everybody"--that 
is, not only Chinese, but also Cambodians--who knocked 
at the embassy door (and even those Cambodians who djd 
not want to come to the embassy) were targets of indoc-
trination, (Sihanouk speech of 18 SeptembeI. 1967) He 
complained that "Chou En-lai does not seem to know" that 
embassy officials and pro-Peking local Chinese leaders 
were trying to indoctrinate not only Overseas Chinese, 
but also Cambodians. 
And it was at this point that the 0Thinese 
abused their rights because, when Chou En-
lai met me recently, he promised that these 
Chinese would stop exercising their influ-
ence on the Khmer. (Sihanouk speech of 12 
September 1967) t,emphasis supplied) 
Chou had not only failed to order the embassy to stop its 
Mao-cult dissemination work, but also had made a special 
request of Cambodia's foreign minister during his mid-
August 1967 visit to Peking. "Chou has asked Prince 
Phurissara to tell Sihanouk, the chief of state of Cam-
bodia, that China wanted a favor; that is, authorization 
for the Chinese to show their love for Mao Tse-tung and 
Communism on the grounds that they are Chinese not Khmer, 
a request that the Chinese in Cambodia have freedom." 
(Sihanouk speech of 12 September 1967) Sihanouk made 
it clear that he would not permit Chou the luxury of 
mongering Mao's doctrines from the Chinese embassy, on 
the one hand, and sustaining Sino-Cambodian diplomatic 
ties, on the other hand. He was spurred into action by 
Cambodian leftists Chau Seng and So Nem, who published 
the text of the insulting 4 September Peking message in 
the 9 September issue of La Nouvella Depeche,

from their governmen posts. In his speech of 13 Septem-

an eventual attack by the Chinese on the Cambodian embassy," 
that the wife of the ambassador had returned from Peking 
because she "did not know when the Chinese would come to 
attack us," and that "I want the personnel of our embassy 
to get out immediately...1 want to withdraw at once lest 
they come and attack."* This threat to pull out Cambodian 
embassy officials--"I will leave only one person, that 
is, an official of very low status to keep the house as 
a guardian"--appeared to be sufficiently genuine to Chou 
and it apparently provided him with the crsis situation 
with which to confront Mao and argue him into rationality. 
Chou moved quickly to assure the Cambodian ambassador in 
Peking (meeting of 14 September) that Sihanouk need not 
worry about injury to Cambodian embassy personnel because 
only certain embassies had been targeted "mass manifes-
tations against certain embassies had their reasons and 
were comprehensible acts because the Chinese people know 
*Although in his speech of 13 September, Sihanouk re-
ferred several times to his fear that the Cambodian embassy 
would be attacked, he apparently was encouraged by Chou's 
assurances of 14 September that such a development would 
not occur. Subsequently, he moved against the activities 
of the Chinese embassy which, he had been told, included 
the dissemination in Phnom Penh of clandestine tracts dis-
tributed in the Overseas Chinese sectors of the city from 
0400 onward and which informed local Chinese on how to 
react to the Cambodian government's decisions on various 
matters, On 16 September, the Cambodian Department of 
Information informed NCNA officials that they could no 
longer circulate the NCNA daily bulletin without first 
giving a copy of their cables to their Cambodian counter-
parts, officials of AKP. On 18 September, the government 
announced prohibitive restrictions on social contacts be-

extension of a restriction which had been selectively 
applied in the past only to some Western missions.

friendship and good relations between our two countries, 
the Chinese government and people have, to date, envisaged 
nothing against the Cambodian embassy." (Sihanouk quot-
ing Chou in speech of 18 September) (emphasis supplied) 
This assurance, and the fact that certain embassies were 
not put under siege, suggest that Chou almost certainly 
was able to persuade Mao to differentiate between "friendly" 
and "non-friendly" missions in considering struggles 
against the representatives of various countries. Sihanouk 
was mollified, and on 18 September he declared that he 
would not withdraw his diplomats from Peking, praising 
"my old friend Chou En-lai for having, once again, played 
a role in safeguarding this friendship. Regarding the 
gauche Pekis) message of 4 September, he did not absolve 
Chou of responsibility for it--"a very well-calculated 
and well-planned punch" to determine Sihanouk's domestic 
"weakness"--but he attributed the sending of it to a 
deeper motive. Chou and Chen fi, he said sympathetically, 
had had to "save their own skins first." (Sihanouk speech 
of 18 September 1967) 
Chou presided over the retreat from the confronta-
tion with Sihanouk. He almcst certainly had the major 
role in convincing Mao that it would be detrimental to 
their Cambodian policy to publish Sihanouk's anti-Peking 
speech of 11 September and he clearly was the most active 
figure in the subsequent effort to mollify the tempera-
mental prince, who threatened to discard Chinese aid. 
(Speech of 17 October 1967) Sihanouk's willingness to 
be mollified facilitated Chou's effort. Sihanouk stated 
on 1 November 1967 that he accepted Chou's most recent 
message of reassurance on the matter of Peking's professed 
desire to avoid intervention in Cambodia's domestic affairs.*

To keep Sihanouk in tow, the PRC Foreign Ministry was

and pledging that the Chinese people "stand on the side

Chou may not be able to keep Mao convinced that, 
so long as Sihanouk is demonstrably anti-American and sup-

be kept in tow. Cambodian officials are concerned about

in Sukarno's decreased anti-Chinese hostility, to reduce 
pressures on Djakarta. They seem to have appraised 
Sukarno as the man who could replace Nehru as their major 
ally and who could defend Peking's position in the Sino-
Indian dispute. Further, internal dislocations on the 
mainland had impelled a softening of foreign policy. In 
December 1960, Mao agreed to the implementation of the

against the PKI threat, particularly against appointing 
PKI members to government posts. Sukarno rejected this 
advice and cancelled the army's order calling for the 
arrest of Aidit and the suspension of the PKI newspaper 
as well as Communist activities in various regions. After

his diplomats appeal to Asian sentiment and his concept 
of "self-reliance" to reduce the degree of Soviet influ-
ence which military supplies and support for "confronta-

The Yugoslays had been moving at a leisurely pace toward 
a non-aligned conference, but the Chinese apparently 
urged Djakarta to suggest a Bandung Preparatory Meeting 
at an early date. This was welcomed by the Indonesians, 
who had become isolated over the Malaysia dispute and 
were trying desperately to recoup their prestige among 
Afro-Asian leaders, Mao was allowing some "leeway" and

Chou En-lai may have resented Liu 's intrusion into 
the arena of Chinese Communist foreign policy--a field 
which he and Chen Yi had monopolized in a series of swings 
through various countries in the past decade. But there 
seems to have been nothing in Liu 's actions in Indonesia 
in April 1963 to provide valid cause for disparaging him 
as the chief formulator of a moderate foreign policy. 
At the time when Liu took a moderate line--foc example, 
when he and his new wife woiked together on a major foreign 
policy assignment (in September 1962) to strengthen the 
Peking-Djakarta rapprochement by receiving cordially Mme. 
Sukarno--the entire line was moderate and other Chinese 
leaders were giving the Indonesians lavish treatment. 
Mme. Mao's first venture in public into a foreign policy 
matter was to aid her husband in receiving Mme. Sukarno 
on 29 September 1962, and it seems to have been a joint 
effort by the Maos and Lius.

Nevertheless, they were reluctant to openly support 
Djakarta's confrontation policy on Malaysia, delaying 
their statement backing Indonesia's position on the forma-
tion of Malaysia (established 16 September 1963) until 
27 September, and even then the Ta Kung Pao comment was 
relatively mild as were subsequent discussions of the 
British "colonialists" until 1964. 
Sukarno's assertive anti-Americ2nism was a key 
unifying factor and when, on 25 March 1964, the Indonesian 
leader made his "To hell with your aid speech," Peking 
picked it up and began to build anti-Americanism into its 
propaganda on Malaysia. Malaysia was a "neo-colonialist 
product of British imperialism with the blessing of U.S. 
imperialism...confrontation is just" and the North Kali-
mantan "struggle for national liberation is just." 
(People's Daily editorial of 27 March 1964) Mao, obsessed 
with his idea that the anti-U. S. revolutionary struggle 
must be extended wherever possible, apparently decided 
to encourage Sukarno with offers of support, but these 
fell far short of a commitment to fight the British and 
Americans in his behalf. 
Mao apparently was informed in mid-1964 that Sukarno 
had impelled the army to realign its military policy away 
from its anti-Peking focus, Sukarno's "L4ving Dangerously" 
speech of 17 August 1964--in which he shifted further to 
the left ,)f neutralism, denounced the U.S, in effect as 
his main enemy, and aligned Djakarta with all Asian Com-
munist regimes and the PKI's internal program--appar-
ently was viewed by Mao as a further indication that 
Sukarno 'S "confrontation" policy had useful anti-U.S, in-
gredients. The Chinese leaders, who earlier had been 
cautious on "confrontation,"* made their strongest statement

of support for this policy after his speech. They professed 
to see an anti-Chinese objective in establishing Malaysia 
(the first such claim, although Malays.7, had been attacked 
by Sukarno since its establishment in September 1963) and 
a 'common task" for Peking and Djakarta in struggling 
against it, (People's Daily editorial of 9 September 
1964) This line probably reflected Mao's decision, after 
two years of cautious non-involvement in the matter, to 
bolster Sukarno's determination to confront the British.  
But Mao likes small wars fought by others, and 
Peking's actual military commitment in Ihis case was, 
typically, vague. Like other formulations--e g., on 
Vietnam and Cambodia--the Chinese depicted their contri-
bution without reference to direct PLA ation. "The Chi-
nese people will not look on with folded arms in the 
fac of this sinister scheme of the imperialists. Should 
U.S. imperialism dare to launch aggression against Indo-
nesia, the Chinese people will back the Indonesian people 
with all their might." (People's Daily editorial of 9

British "aggression," was not cited in this context of

Economic aid was a safer way to help encourage Sukarno

offer was partly a bribe to keep Sukarno in tow and to

This Maoist move to buy more power for a Communist 
ally within a non Communist government exposed the hypo-
crisy of Chou En-lai's January 1964 eight principles of 
foreign aid, in which he had touted Peking's disavowal 
of any effort to attach strings to economic assistance. 
More importantly, it seems to have reflected the appraisal 
of Mao and his aides of the PKI's strategy of working 
within this "bourgeois-nationalist" government as well 
as outside it subversively to attain power for the Com-
munists. They probably encouraged Aidit in his sugges-
tion of 14 January 1965 to arm 10 million peasants and 
5 million workers to meet a prospective British attack, 
as this would have placed considerable military power in 
the hands of the PKI, who were at that time the only suc-
cessful organizers of the psants and workers.* At the 
very least, Aidit's suggestion was a psychological warfare 
deterrent against the British. But in terms of the in-
ternal maneuvering for power between the PKI and the army, 
the suggestion was intended to improve the Communists' 
domestic image. Sukarno continued to be alert to balanc-

By the summer of 1965, Sino-Indonesian relations 
were better than ever and cooperation against the American 
and the British position in the Far East was a key unify-
ing factor. Mao encouraged the relationship, receiving 
an Indonesian parliamentarian in early July 1965 and per-
mitting a Sino Indonesian shipping agreement to be con-
cluded on 24 July. On 21 August, Chen Yi in Djakarta was 
authorized to assure Subandrio that Peking would not  
recognize the new nation of Singapore./ 
 /Both 
sides exchanged a variety of delegations and the Chinese

 Ithat 
the Chinese would like to have a special agreement for 
economic cooperation among China, Indonesia, Cambodia, 
Pakistan, and North Korea and that "special technical 
cooperation" (i.e , on nuclear energy) between Peking 
and Djakarta would be decided upon with Sukarno sometime 
after the Afro-Asian conference.** These were concepts 
which the Chinese leaders recognized as being part of 
Sukarno's special regional program, and they were anxious 
to sustain his hopes by hinting at a regional "axis" and 
some degree of nuclear energy technical advice.

as the front behind which his aides could set up and 
dominate a pro-Chinese secretariat.

events which reduced Sino-Indonesian relations to a state

efforts to shield the PK1. On 19 October 1965, NCNA in-

NCNA also noted that Subandrio pledged to be firm not only

Throughout February and inte late March 1966, the 
Chinese waged a "blow-for-blow struggle" with the Indon-
esian army leadership, but they seem to have been unwill-
ing to break relations. They depicted the mutual with-
drawal of diplomatic personnel as "temporary" and tried 
to get Djakarta to call a halt. 'We want to say to the 
Indonesian government that you have gone far enough in 
this direction. If you continue to slide down this road 
of worsening relations between our two countries, then 
you must be held completely responsible for all the con-
sequences," (People's Daily editrrial of 30 March 1966)  
 2 Chou may have justified a 
policy of trying to hang on by persuading Mao of the need 
to avoid total defeat when Maoist policies elsewhere--in 
the Congo, Burundi, Ghana, Algeria, and the India-Pakistan 
clash--had already badly damaged Peking's prestige. Chou 
may also have been the man in charge of justifying to 
party and army officials as well as to the populace, the 
meaning of these defeats, namely, that they were not Mao's 
failure (inasmuch as the revolutionary tide in the world 
follows a natural "law" which no mortal can change) and 
that they must take heart because the night is darkest 
before the dawn.*

The dawn in Indonesia, however, was dark and begin-
ning on 4 April 1966, Mao seems to have conceded that 
Sukarno was a lost ally. On that day, NCNA carried an 
unusual analysis of the entire coup situation and, for 
the first time in Peking's media, depicted Sukarno as a 
mere figurehead retained by the army for display. The 
analysis referred back to the 12 March 1966 order of 
Suharto's banning the PKI and repeated a Japanese view 
that a statement of Sukarno's on 16 March 1966 was "his 
last act of resistance." The Chinese went on to indict 
the new Indonesian government in the strongest terms up 
to that time--"a group of petty thugs" (People's Daily  
editorial of 16 April 1966) -and while raising the issue 
of a diplomatic "rupture," they seem to have preferred 
that any such action must come first from Djakarta. In 
order to discredit the army leadership and to improve 
Peking's image among Overseas Chinese (who were being 
subjected to the worst persecution since Indonesia's in-
dependence), the Chinese widely publicized their protests 
to Djakarta and their actions to provide ships for those 
"patriots" who wanted to move to the mainland, the first 
ship arriving in Indonesia in late September 1966. 
It was at this time that a new revolutionary factor 
was introduced into the dispute, moving Peking's policy 
further to the left of normal diplomatic relations. Mao 
approved a suggestion to change the "bourgeois" style of 
Chinese diplomats abroad and called for "a revolutioniza-
tion" of "all foreign affairs offices abroad." (Mao's 
statement of 9 September 1966) Subsequently, Chinese 
(footnote continued from page 49) 
lies--of the condition of the "revolutionary tide" in 
the world than Peking has ever published. They do not 
carry the tone of genuine optimism which had marked the 
Chinese Communist statements on global strategy in late 
1957 and part of 1958. They were designed to rationalize 
a detrimental aspect of Mao's revolutionary foreign policy 
line, and at those points, where the future is discussed, 
the optimism is contrived.

Mao's plan to replace a former champion of Peking's

(Indonesia) had been ruined. At the same time, a major 
ally in hi.s d'spute with the Soviet leaders, namely, the 
PKI, had been destroyed as a national political force.

Mao and his aides launched a policy of gradually 
increasing harassment of the Indonesian embassy and its 
officials in Peking in response to anti-Chinese actions. 
On 12 April groups of Red Guards were encouraged to demon-
strate against the Indonesian embassy in a manner similar 
to the siege directed against the Soviet embassy in early 
February, in neither case were embassy grounds invaded. 
On 13 April, an NCNA report depicted Suharto as "a lapdog 
with human skin.' Chinese officials in Djakarta appar-
ently were directed to intensify their "revolutionary" 
actions against the government; as a result, Djakarta ac-
cused them of having shouted anti-government slogans during 
a funeral procession for a local Chinese on 20 April. 
A demonstration against the Chinese embassy was held on 
the 22nd and the Chinese charge and consul general were 
declared persona non grata on the 24th. The Chinese 
leaders, who apparently wanted to have things both ways 
--that is, open harassment of Indonesian diplomats and. 
sustained formal relations with Indonesia--were impelled 
to increase their retaliation, and on the 24th they ordered 
the Indonesian charge and counsellor to leave. They in-
tensified the siege, and on the 25th, Red Guards burned 
effigies of Suharto and Nasution in front of the embassy 
and openly praised the Indonesian Communists. Mao was 
willing to risk a break, on 26 April the PRC government 
statement--the highest level in Peking's arsenal of foreign 
policy pronouncements--encouraged Chinese in Indonesia 
to "struggle" against persecution, This was an official 
instruction to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs 
and an open violation of principle (3) of Chou's five 
principles of peaceful coexistence of April 1955. The 
statement attacked the "out-and-out fascist regime' and 
predicted that the "people will eventually overthrow the 
reactionary rule.' 
Mao apparently decided to permit cruder retaliatory 
actions, and after Hsieh Fu-cnih condemned Indonesian 
"atrocities" on 27 April, the two expelled Indonesian 
diplomats were subjected on the way out to various forms

In an effort to pry their officials in Peking loose 
from the hostage policy, Foreign Minister Malik declared 
the Chinese charge and second secretary persona non grata 
on 14 September, and a Foreign Ministry of told an 
American embassy officer at the time that the move was 
designed to impel the Chinese to reciprocate by allowing 
two Indonesians from the embassy staff to leave. On 25 
September, the Chinese complied, declaring two Indonesian 
diplomats persona non grata, and were willing to permit 
them to leave by the 29th. Chou apparently believed that 
this limited retreat from the hostage policy would enable 
him to retain a handful of Chinese in the Djakar7.a embassy 
and various consulates, thereby avoiding a complete break 
in diplomatic  relations However, his apparent plan to 
retain representatives in Indonesia was to encounter a 
decisive blow. 
On 1 October, about 200 students. mostly Moslem 
and most of whom had been celebrating the second anniver-
sary of the abortive Sukarno Aidit coup, attacked the Chi-
nese embassy in Djakarta, destroying communications equip-
ment and seriously injuring two embassy officers.* Chou 25X1

Chou had to praise the acts of resist,

them in place. On 7 October he cabled 'heartfelt con 
cern" on behalf of the central committee and the State 
Council for the embassy staff whose members were an "ex-
ample" for other Maoist diplomats. (Cable released by 
NCNA on 9 October) On the 9th, the Indonesians suggested 
a simultaneous withdrawal of embassy staffs, making it 
clear that they wanted all of the Chinese (rather than 
just the injured officers) to leave the country. Under 
considerable domestic political pressure, Malik on the 
10th announced that Djakarta was "suspending" relations.* 
On the 12th, the Chinese refused the suggestion 
for a mutual withdrawal of all embassy personnel ^n each 
side and repeated their demand for an end to restrictions 
which had been imposed on their diplomats. Pressure on 
Malik continued to force his hand on 23 October, Djakarta 
asked Peking  t pLC.1 out its 
embassy and consulates "in the shortest possible time," 
and it stated that the chancery of the Peking embassy 
would be c!osed. On the 27th, Chou reluctantly conceded

of all embassy and consular personnel, emphasis sup-

embassy personnel were flown tc Djakarta in a Chinese air-

In sum, although Chou apparently had convinced Mao 
that it was important for his new revolutionary policy 
toward Indonesia to keep diplomatic representatives in 
the country, Chou was constantly impelled t take harder 
positions and retaliatory action which further intensi-
fied Djakarta-Peking frictions ending in a complete break, 
That Chou tried to control the degree Di Peking's retalia-
tion is suggested by the fact that the. I October assault 
on the embassy in Djakarta was not answeled with a new 
attack on Indonesian embassy personnel oi lodgings in 
Peking 
Mao and Chou by late October were confronted with 
the detrimental results of roughly two years of disputation 
with the post-Sukarno Indonesian government, namely, the 
loss of strategic assets (the embassy in Djakarta and the 
consulates in Djakarta, Medan, Makassar, and Bandjarmasin) 
which had provided them with bases of operations to 
organize Overseas Chinese and PK1 members for various 
forms of "revolutionary" anti-government ativity. Mao's 
subversive program was to be impeded, but not stopped.

Prior to the "suspension' of relations, the revolu-

against the military government included tne use of Over-

they must recast the party along Maoist lines to conduct 
a revolutionary struggle. Following publication of the 
PKI "self-criticism" in September 1966, PKI leader Adjitorop 
told the Albanian party congress on 3 November that the 
"three urgent tasks" of the party are reconstruction of 
the PKI "on a Marxist-Leninist [i.e., pro-Peking] basis." 
preparation "to lead a long armed struggle" which will be 
integrated with peasant insurrection, and formation of 
a "united front" of all forces opposing the military gov-
ernment. Quoting former leader Aidit, he said that this 
was Mao's road--another sign of the open revival of the 
concept which Peking had downplayed since late 1951. A 
Red Flag editorial in the 9 July 1967 issue insisted that 
the Tin had to change from legal and peaceful struggle 
to illegal and armed struggle "there is no alternative 
for them but to master" armed struggle. It delcared that 
the 'CCP and the Chinese people...firmly support the PKI 
in leading the Indonesian people's struggle to overthrow 
the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime..." Peking's capabil-
ities in the islands is limited but the Chinese leaders 
have continued to encourage and support anti-government 
uerrilla warfare.  
  /in early September, army-controlled 
newspapers reported that the People's Guerrilla Force of 
Sarawak, operating with mainland-trained personnel, was 
active in the West Borneo border area. Peking has exag-
gerated the size and importance of the guerrilla elements 
in the field, and NCNA's report of 27 September 1967 was 
fatuous in its claim that "the prairie fire of revolu-
tionary armed struggle has flared up in the countryside 
in Java, Kalimantan. Sulawesi, and Sumatra." Despite the 
exaggerations, Mao and his aides seem to be determined 
to encourage a long-term revolutionary struggle and will 
continue to insist that it must be armed struggle.*

The basic shift to a revolutionary-insurrection-
ist policy toward Djakarta has impelled Mao and Chou to 
use the scapegoat procedure, depicting Liu Shao-chi as 
the man who desired a moderate and cooperative policy 
toward Sukarno ever since 1960. Liu ('China's Khrushchev) 
was accused of having (1) praised the 'leading representa-
tive of the Indonesian bourgeoisie"--the new designation 
for Sukarno--during his April 1963 visit to Indonesia, 
(2) misled the PKI by dilutjng its "revolutionary vigilance' 
with talk of peaceful coexistence, (3) enhanced his own 
prestige, and (4) failed to refer to Mao. (People's Daily 
article of 13 June 1967) But regarding (1), Liu had re-
jected several of Sukarno's specific requests during the 
April 1963 discussions, namely, that Peking should create 
a diversion in the Taiwan Strait or against Hong Kong by 
the summer. of 1963 and that it should provide Djakarta 
with more support on "confrontation,' Regarding '2, it 
was Chou rather than Liu who had spoken most frequently 
and extensively on peaceful coexistence when discussing 
Indonesian policy, It had been Chou (with Mao's apparent 
encouragement) who had advanced the policy of the "Bandung 
Spirit" in the mid-1950s and early 1960s and at various 
times thereafter). When that policy was gradually down-
graded in relations with some neutrals in 1964 and 1965 
(although retained with Indonesia until the 1 October 1965 
coup), Liu was the most prominent proponent of the new 
revolutionary "Bandung Spirit." Liu's version of the 
spirit was far more revolutionary than (hou's had been, 
as witness Liu 's references to the "militant spirit,..and

struggle" in eulogizing the 10th anniversary of the Bandung 
conference. kRed Flag on 30 April 1965 carried Liu's eulogy 
of 5 April) Regarding (3), Liu in fact had begun to create 
an image of himself as a figure of importance at least 
equal to Chou 's in foreign policy, and Chou in fact may  
hav*_deeply_resented Liu's new role as Peking's interna-
tional troubleshooter with non-Communist governments. 
Regarding k4), Liu probably believed that sycophantic 
references to Mao (or to his 'thought") during such a 
trip would be diplomatically stupid. Chou and Chen Yi 
apparently held the same view until the issue of eulogistic 
praise for Mao had become an important test of loyalty 
to the Chinese dictator in the spring of 1966 (and there-
after,. 
Additional charges against Liu's view of policy 
toward Indonesia appear to be primarily necessitated by 
the scapegoat procedure. For example, Liu has been ac-
cused of having told the PKI at some unspecified time) 
that it was a good thing "to have more party members in 
ministerial posts in the government." (Broadcast of 4 
December 1967 of a Liberation Army Daily article in a 
series) But Mao and Chou had not disparaged this policy 
when Aid it was advancing it, and they showed their sup-
port for his parliamentary road by welcoming him person-
ally (People's Daily of 4 September 1963) and by having 
his 4 September 1963 speech--in which he complained that 
Communists were not yet in "responsible government" posi-
tions and insisted that the next step was to include Com-
munists in the Indonesan cabinet--published in the Peo-
ple's Daily on 5 September 1963. 
In addition to his shift to a revolutionary-insur-
rectionist line, Mao may have decided to use the Overseas 
Chinese more actively as an important subversive asset in 
Indonesia. This is a radical change from the earlier 
policy which Chou had formulated in 1954 to demonstrate 
at the start of the Bandung era the sincerity of Peking's 
desire for a relaxation of tension between Asian countries 
and for a non-subversive paternalism toward Overseas Chi-
nese. "For our part, we are willing to urge Overseas Chi-
nese to respect the laws of the governments and the social 
customs of the countries in which they live." (Chou's

speech to the first NPC on 24 September 1954)* However, 
Chou has not been attacked for having formulated and im-
plemented this early policy of subordinating political 
mobilization of Overseas Chinese to the requirements of 
foreign policy. Men lower in the organizational hierarchy 
of the Chinese Communist leadership have been made the 
scapegoats for his earlier policy and it is a measure 
of Chou's authority that he is able to shunt the blame 
to other men. Chen Yi and Liao Cheng-chih have had to 
accept the blame for implementing the relatively softer 
line, and the formulation of this line was fatuously at-
tributed to Liu Shao-chi. 
*Section XI of the April 1955 Dual Nationality Treaty 
adds that Peking and Djakarta will encourage its citizens 
in the other country "not to take part in the political 
activities of that country." This new principle was an 
important departure in Peking's policy toward the Over-
seas Chinese, inasmuch as it reduced their potential to 
act as organized opponents of future anti-Peking policies 
implemented by Indonesia and other countries. That Chou 
was the major advocate of this policy in the Chinese lead-
ership and that he was permitted by Mao to try to extend 
it to areas other than Indonesia is indicated by his state-
ment that Chinese citizens living in Singapore should "re-
frain from taking part in political activities" in the 
city (statement to David Marshall, former Singapore Chief 
Minister made in October 1956), by his reported statement 
made in 1957 (precise date not given) that Chinese in Burma 
should "not interfere in Burmese politics," and by his 
statement that during his tour of Cambodia, India, Burma, 
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Ceylon "where there are 
a considerable number of Overseas Chinese in most of these 
countries...we..,urged upon them to respect the laws and 
customs of the country of their residence, work for a 
closer friendship with the people among whom they have 
come to live, and strive for still more cordial relations 
between China and the country in which they reside."

Chen was accused of having "hindered" Overseas 
Chinese in Indonesia from organizing and defending them-

 /He was also accused of having been so "fright-

ordered three of our consulates in Indonesia temporarily 
to stop work and their personnel to assemble in our embassy

bourgeoisie among the Overseas Chinese, to go ana report 
to the Indonesian reactionary authorities and to reason

he would urge them to use the method of bribery in an

because the authors of the criticism desire to conceal 
its recent origin and to imply that it had been Mao's 
view all  along. Liao was said to have suppressed mass 
movements of Overseas Chinese during the Korean war be-
cause he feared they would "irritate" local governments, 
dissolved Overseas Chinese "mass organizations to educate 
and organize the broad revolutionary masses" because he 
feared they might cause "suspicion," and ordered the dis-
solution of "groups studying Chairman Mao's works and re-
peatedly prevented Overseas Chinese organizations and 
schools from conduct ng political studies" because local 
governments might suspect "subversive activities" and this 
wculd "impair diplomatic relations." Later, presumably 
in the mid-1950s, Liao told Overseas Chinese "to mind their 
own business," "to stick to their own posts," and "not 
to criticize the internal affairs of the local govern. 
ments." He was said to have warned them to "obey the 
local laws and respect the local customs and habits" and 
to carry out all their work publicly and lawfully." Dur-
ing the persecution of rural Chinese tradesmen in Indo-
nesia in 1959 60, Liao was said to have failed to organize 
an Overseas Chinese counter-struggle and, "on the contrary, 
he suggested the plan of withdrawing 600,000 from Indonesia 
in one year." At the same time, he even suggested "'with-
drawal of 3 to 5 million Overseas Chinese from various 
parts of the world in 7 or 8 years to come.'" Following 
the coup in the fall of 1965, he is said to have objected 
to Overseas Chinese efforts to get organized, to have 
"screamed that 'it is better to oe Right than to be Left 
(footnote continued from page 62) 
18 June 1967) Liu had some influence on Overseas Chinese 
policy as Mao's deputy in the CCP party machine, in which 
he presided over Liao, who had been one of eight deputy 
directors of the Central Committee's United Front Work 
Department; part of the Department's work was with Over-
seas Chinese. However, Liao seems to have been most active 
in Overseas Chinese policy when he worked closely w'..th

they should not intefere because "Overseas Chinese can 
protect themselves." The authors of these charges de-
clared that Overseas Chinese "should aid the local people 
in their revolutionary cause," (Extracts from Criticize 
Liao Combat  Bulletin of 18 June 1967) 
The prospect seems to be for a revoluti-nary and 
subversive policy directed against the Indonesian govern-
ment and open encouragement of guerrilla warfare. Switch-
ing from the "parliamentary road" -the PKI had not taken 
Mao's road of armed struggle in the 1940s (the Communist 
uprising in 1948 was a debacle for them) or 1950s--to 
an insurrectionist policy in the rural areas of the is-
lands, however, the Chinese leaders are competing with 
the Soviets for PKI loyalties. They will be at a disad-
vantage, inasmuch as they have lost their embassy and con-
sulates as important channels for contacting PKI remnants. 
Further, they have declared open political warfare on the 
government and they will not be in a position to profess 
to the PKI insurgents with credibility that they have the 
power to intercede with Djakarta on their behalf. Never-
theless, because the nine-member politburo is pro-Peking 
and in late November 1967 decided to adopt a Maoist policy 
of guerrilla warfare (at such time in the future when it 
acquires capability), the Soviet diplomatic advantage 
may be of small importance in the Sino-Soviet competition 
for party loyalty. 
B. Asian Countries Not Involved with Mao's Anti-Americanism

Mao apparently believed that the joint statement 
he permitted Chou En-lai to issue with Prime Minister U 
Nu on 29 June 1954 declaring nonaggression and noninter 
ference in each other's affairs would help to sustain 
Burma's policy of keeping American forces from establish-

to recognize his regime was a sufficient reason for Mao 
to act as if he would comply with Burmese requests that 
Peking must not support the Communist insurgents or engage

Communist military alliance in Southeast Asia, Mao and 
Chou at various times calculated that psychological pres-
sures could be applied to the Burmese leaders without any 
great risk to their policy of keeping them in tow. In 
1956, they seem to have been trying to impel U Nu to con-
cede frontier territory which Peking claimed on its maps. 
They sent PLA ,,ILt.ols into the Kachin State in mid-1956, 
and in October 1956, they hinted to U Nu in Peking that 
this PLA 'mistake" was caused by the undemarcated nature 
of the border. Following protracted discussions with 
Chou for nearly a week, U Nu (temrorarily out of office) 
declared on 10 Novemh.?r 1956 that a provisional agree-
ment had been concluded in which Rangoon recognized three 
northern Kachin villages as Chinese territory and abrog-
ated Burma's perpetual lease of the strategic Namwan 
Assigned Tract in the southern Kachin State. Burmese 
troops were to withdraw from the three villages which 
commanded importnat border passes and the PLA was to pull 
back from territory west of the line in the north established 
by the British in 1941. However, Mao and Chou desired 
additional concessions and they stalled on implementing 
the provisional agreement until the Tibet revolt in 1959 
and the open border dispute with India impelled them to 
conclude the Sino-Burma border agreement tr "prove" that 
they were not the intransigents in the struggle with New 
Delhi. (Khrushchev and Nehru had been criticizing the 
Chinese leaders for being the intransigent party.) Chou 
was the key actician for tne Chinese, and after the Chi-
nese ambassador in Rangoon on 25 September 1959 assured 
the Burmese that the authorities in Peking accepted Burma's 
definition of the border, Chou personally induced Premier 
Ne Win to come to Peking to make final arrangements. 
Chou took a very conciliatory line, and on 28 January 
1960, Ne Win signed the border agreement--an agreement 
"in princi,:le" which Chou immediately used against Nehru's 
argument that a prior agreement "in principle regarding 
the Sino Indian border was meaningless. The agreement 
"returned' the three villages and an area in the Wa ter-
ritory to Peking for the Namwan Assigned Tract and led

to demarcation of the border, most of which complied with 
Burma's map claims.* The conciliatory line was sustained, 
and in November 1960, Mao and Chou used PLA units to as-
sist in Burma's campaign against Chinese Nationalist ir-
regulars operating in the border areas. Although they 
could easily have supplanted Burmese authority in many 
border villages, the units apparently were not given such 
a mission--a hypothetical mission which probably would 
have stimulated the Burmese leaders to seek aid from the 
West. 
25X1 
Mao and Chou at various critical times, particul. 
arly in connection with their dispute with India and their 
position regarding the Vietnam war, have probed Ne Win's 
determination to move from a neutral to a pro-Peking for-
eign policy. Immediately following the PLA punitive at-
tack on Indian positions in October 1962, Chou asked the 
Burmese ambassador in Peking what Rangoon would 
turn to for support if its neutrality were threatened. 
(New Delhi at the time had turned to the US, and the UK 
for sunport.) The Burmese were uncertain about the mean-
ing of Chou's question and conjectured that it may have 
been a hint that Peking might want to send PLA troops 
across Burmese territory to outflank Indian positions in 
the event of a renewal of the border war. However, the 
PLA was in fact outflanking Indian troops within Indian 
territory with no significant difficulty, and Chou's 
intention seems to have been a political probe regard- 25X1 
ing Rangoon's basic attitude toward the EJS, and the UK.  
*U Nu, who became premier aga'n in April 1960--Ne Win 
had been in office from September 1958 to April 1960--
signed the final agreement with Chou in Peking on 1 October 
1960 and the demarcation protocol in October 1961.

Follow ng Peking's apparent decision at the June 
1964 work conference ot the CCP central committee to in-
crease support for the Vietnamese Communists, and in the 
context of the Sino-Soviet dispute, Ne Win was subjected 
to greater pressure to adopt a more anti-U.S, and anti-
USSR position. Ne Win's sensitivities were disregarded 
as Chou En lai and Chen Yi descended on Rangoon, uninvited. 
in a series of visits reflecting a new stage in Mao's 
revolutionary diplomacy, which was to be marked by a 
new degree of crude behavior. 
Regarding the ant-U.S, part of their basic ef-
fort, Chou and Chen during their visit from 10 to 12 July 
1964 tried to commit Ne Win to the old principle that he 
would not join a military organization against Peking.* 
They induced h'm to republish such a pledge in the joint  
communique of 12 July.  
*The joint communique reaffirmed Article Three of the 
Sino-Burmese Friendship Treaty pledging each country not 
to commit aggression or enter into a military pact direct-
ed against the other. This was the major aspect of the 
anti-U.S, part of the Chou-Chen visit. They wanted to 
determine what Burma's policy would be if "the U.S. ex-
pands the war" in Indochina. (This line was publicized 
by the Hong Kong Communist paper Wen Wei Pao on 14 July 
1964.)

Ne Win's neutral position also made him a special 
target of New Delhi and Moscow, and as the competition 
for gaining his support increased, Mao and his aides 
decided to work even harder to move him closef to their

apparently viewed Ne Win as backyard property. Chou was 
given the important job of trying to impel Ne Win to 
recognize the unique status of Peking's representations 
and to impel him to drop his neutral stand and adopt a 
whole range of Maoist positions. 
The arm-twisting diplomacy (which was used on Ne 
Win within a month after the June 1964 work conference 
of the CCP central committee) was intensified in April 
1965. The Chinese leaders desired condemnation of the 
U0S, airstrikes against the North Vietnamese which were 
continuing into April. Chou invited himself to Rangoon 
three times in one month (visiting from 3 to 4 April, on 
16 April, and on 26 and 28 April, in and out of jaunts 
abroad) and although Ne Win tried to work out a full cere-
monial schedule which would leave little time for lectures 
from Chou on substantive matters, the clever Chinese 
premiEr always changed arrangements and managed several 
hours of discussion. Chou tried to brainwash Ne Win. 
This undiplomatic treatment further antagonized 
Ne Win, who was not only worried by White Flag activities 
but also by the dissemination of what he believed was a  
Chinese Communist anti-government pamphlet./

*Negotiations over the years had broken down on the 
issue of surrendering Communist personnel (and their wea-

an earlier period, Thakin Than Tun had offered to "come 25X1 
in" (28 March 1958), but U Nu rejected his bid because 
Than Tun refused to renounce the policy of armed struggle.  
 / Than Tun rejected U Nu's 31 July 
1958 amnesty decree for all insurgents who renounced their 
insurgency in advance, aid he wrote to Nu again in January 
1961 that he would not surrender and wanted talks without 
prior conditions. Agreement for talks was finally reached 
in October 1963 when Premier Ne Win was willing to guar-
antee the safety of White Flag negotiators, but the dis-
cussions were broken off by the Premier in November 1963.

Ne Win, convinced that the Chinese in this way (among 
various other ways) were trying to stir his anxiety to 
a point at which he would feel impelled to discard neutral 
politics, believed that he was on safe legal ground and 
that his friendship treaty with Peking did not give the 
PLA access to Burmese territory under Article Three. Mao 
had a "cordial and friendly conversation" with the General 
during his visit, but the substantive talks apparently 
were held with Liu and Chou, who discussed matters of 
"cooperation...and international questions of common in-
terest." (Sino-Burmese communique of 1 August 1965) Ne 
Win resisted their effort to induce him to endorse their 
position on Vietnam and conceded only the lesser points, 
such as support for Peking's "right" to UN membership. 
the Chinese leaders publicly praised his policy of  
non-alignment/

Chinese from the summer of 1965 to the spring of 1966

toward the few governments which were not openly disparag-

 /Although he attacked U.S. "aggres-
sion" in Vietnam in his 17 April speech, he apparently 
did not insist that Vietnam should be mentioned in the 
communique of 19 April. It was not mentioned, and Liu left 
the Burmese leaders with the impression that he was pri-
marily concerned with emphasizing "good relations" with 
Burma, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Cambodia at a time 
when Peking had suffered major foreign policy reverses 
in other countries. 
Encouraged by the obvious fact that Mao's attention 
was f-)cused on internal matters on the mainland, Ne Win . 
began to move faster and more vigorously to suppress anti-
government activity engaged in by the Chinese embassy 
which was in contact with Overseas Chinese in the country.*  
 __/In a speech on 14 November 
1966, Ne Win depicted certain Chinese as "rank opportun- 25X1 
ists" and warned that certain "foreign elements" were a 
potential danger to Burma's economy, Surfacing of the 
pledge of Peking-based Burmese Communists to bring down 
Ne Win's government reflected Mao's view of Ne Win as 
an opponent. This apparent view may have been decisively 
formed after Ne Win's trip to the U.S. in August 1966. 
*He had taken some steps at an earlier time, even be-
fore Mao became engrossed with the purge, to limit Chinese 
propaganda activities among Overseas Chinese in Burma. 
For example, he nationalized Chinese schools in the spring 
of 1965 and closed down the remaining (and pro-Communist) 
Chinese language newspaners in January 1966, apparently 
because these papers diu not mention Prime Minister 
Shastri's visit to Rangoon in December 1965--a silence 
which suggested Chinese embassy guidance. Peking did 
not retaliate at the time, but began to respond to his 
pressures on local Chinese after Mao's purge was under-
way (in early December 1966).

  Sy early February 
1967, he had decided to permit a government-owned news-
paper to publicize the actions of about 300 Chinese refugees 
who had crossed into Burma to escape Mao's purge and the 
abominations of the Red Guards. 
By the spring of 1967, when the new revolutionary 
line was implemented in Burma by revolutionized Chinese 
embassy personnel, Mac had dropped most aspects of the 
old policy of avoiding the appearance of indoctrinating 
Overseas Chinese. The Chinese embassy, working on young 
Chinese residents in Rangoon, began distributing Mao 
buttons, showing bi-weekly movies at the embassy, and 
organizing groups to perform "voluntary manual labor' 5X1 
on embassy premises. They also organized after-hours 
Chinese language schools, where Maoist doctrine was in-
cluded in the c.IrricuIum.) 
  /By mid-June, Ne Win began to act 
against Mao's program to create in Burma a network of young 
Maoist fanatics antagonistic to his government. On 14 
June 1967, when Chinese students in Bhamo who were told 
to remove the Mao buttons they were wearing refused to 
comply, 64 were expelled from the school. As a result 
of the incident, the Ministry of Education issued an 
order, which was publicized locally on 19 June, declaring 
that students were permitted to wear only badges recognized 
by the Burmese government. 
It was in reaction to this order that pro-Communist

wearing Mao badges, which they had received from the Chinese 
embassy. Ne Win apparently was informed that the embassy 
encouraged wearing of these badges by pro-Communist 
Burmese as well as Chinese students and he almost certainly 
was told that, by mid-June, the Chinese embassy was re-
quiring Chinese high-school students to write from memory 
15 verses from Mao's works before giving an individual 
his Mao button. The Burmese protested to the Chinese 
embassy about these activities, but embassy personnel did 
not desist. On 22 June 1967, during a demonstration 
against the order banning the wearing of Mao buttons which 
began at two state-run schools in Rangoon's Chinese sec-
tion, Chine E embassy personnel reportedly drove up in 
an embassy car, criticized the headmaster for trying to 
have the buttons removed, and then passed out more buttons 
and pamphlets to the students. With Ne Win's permission, 
the Rangoon press carried this story as well as the pic-
tures showing students mauling Burmese reporters. As a 
result, Burmese officials closed the schools. The element 
of Burmese-Chinese national hostility became a major factor 
in the school demonstrations, and on 26 June, when two 
Chinese embassy personnel drove past one of several Chi-
nese schools which students were demanding should be 
opened (and at which the students were shouting slogans 
praising Mao), the car was stoned by a crowd of angry 
Burmese. The subsequent events--viz., the smashing of 
Chinese property by Burmese on the eve of the 26th, the 
killing of more than 30 local Chinese on the eve of the 
27th, and the murder of a Chinese embassy technician on 
the eve of the 28th--impelled Mao to escalate his revolu-
tionary policy toward Ne Win into open government-to-gov-
ernment recriminations, 
Behind the scenes, since early June, complaints 
and counter-complaints were being exchanged between the 
Burmese government and the Chinese embassy regarding in-
terference in Burma's internal affairs, the embassy posi-
tion having been that it was justified in disseminating 
Maoism in the country as a "necessary step to improve 
fraternal relations between socalist countries." The 
PRC Foreign Ministry protested the 
incidents but left the Burmese some room for a gradual 
retreat. However, under pressure from non-professionals

and in the atmosphere of a "revolutionization" of the 
Foreign Ministry, officials in the Ministry may have been 
impelled to discard the small degree of restraint in the 
note. NCNA issued reports, several hours later on the 
28th and early on the 29th of June, attacking Rangoon as 
"reactionary and depicting Ne Win as Peking's enemy. 
The incidents seem to have stemmed from a combina-
tion of tae spontaneotu, reaction of the Chinese students 
and the arrogant ("revolutionary"y contempt which Chinese 
diplomats were impelled to display when opposed by a 
national leader who tried to prevent the dissemination 
of Maoist doctrine and Mao-cult symbols in his country. 
In perspective, it was the result of the new missionary 
activities which Mao required of recently .:'evolutionized 
diplomats. The American embassy in Rangoon reported in 
late June 1967 that some members of the Chinese embassy 
had recently returned from indoctrination courses in Peking, 
Others had returned earlier. Training in new, revoluion-
ary diplomacy was mandatory for all embassy officials. 
The two top men in the embassy--i.e., the ambassador and 
25X1 
the counsellor--left Rangoon for Peking on 9 January 1967. 
As of 23 January, 37 di  lomats and staff members had left  
for the mainland.  
 /By 
late January, Chinese aid technicians were threatening 
the Soviets in Rangoon with a revolutionary demonstration 
against their embassy. In mid-February, the Red Guard 
newspaper, Combat News, was distributed in Peking carrying 
an attack on Ne Win for being an associate of Liu Shao-
chi (Liu was indirectly named). In March d April 1967, 
Mao's "thought" and Mao-cult symbols were being dis-
seminated in Rangoon and northern Burma by Chinese embassy 
officials and couriers. 
Dissemination of the Mao-cult was the immediate 
cause of the open exchange of recriminations in June and 
July--an exchange which Peking's encouragement of subver-
sives (viz., training of insurgents and public support 
for the anti-government goal of the Communist Party of

Burma) had rot in itself produced.* It apparently was 
the smuggling of Maoist propaganda tracts and symbols of 
the Mao-cult through the Chinese embassy that most inten-
sively stirred resentment against the Chinese leaders. 
Even the Chinese Communist aid technicians working in the 
Meiktila textile m 11 they had built were primarily en-
gaged, in the spring of 1967, with proselyting Maoist doc-
trine in the mill and among Burmese laborers in earby  
villages/ 
Dissemination of the Mao-cult. reflecting Mao's 
contempt for Burmese nationalistic sensitivities, was sus-
tained and justified in early July. Speakers at the Peking 
rally of 5 July demanded that Rangoon permit Overseas Chi-
nese and "the Burmese people to study, propagate, and defend 
the great thought of Mao Tse-tung," and the People's Daily, 
while avoiding in its issue of 10 July the formulation 
about the "Burmese people," continued to insist that "The 
propagation of Mao Tse-tung's thought is the sacred and 
inviolable right of the ChiDese personnel working abroad. 
It is absolutely proper and justified for the patriotic 
Overseas Chinese to love the great leader Chairman Mao 
Tse-tung, study his wori;.s, and wear badges with his profile 
Mao's reaction to the events of June was to seek 
revenge. His punitive action against the Ne Win govern-
ment was tied directly to ransacking of "the economic 
counsellor's office of the Chinese embassy in charge of 
China's economic aid to Burma" on 27 June, the murder of

NCNA correspondent, ordering him to leave by 17 July, 
for an offense which had occurred on 28 June when he re-

Nevertheless, while desiring to retain their per-

recriminatory exchanges with Rangoon, repeating the revolu-
tionary and undiplomatic formulations that Ne Win's govern-

"blood debt."* The Chinese were refused permission to

included punishment of persons involved in raids on the

had no intention of complying; on 4 October, they had 
released the only man accused of entering the embassy and 
stabbing the aid expert. Ne Win acted to force the Chi-

U Ohn Khin summon the Chinese charge, Hsiao Ming, on 6 
October and, using as the immediate cause the Peking 
Radio broadcast of the 4th, asked that the aid experts 
be withdrawn. The Chinese did not comply--they may have 
been hoping that prior to the withdrawal deadline of 31 
October Ne Win would rescind his request. Finally, in 
their statement of 31 October 1967, they announced that

Mao's new revolutionary policy toward Ne Win had 
started, in July 1967, to incorporate an effort to sub-
vert tribal minority groups and to enlist them in a general 
Communist-led rural insurrection against Rangoon. The 
effort was to be aided from the mainland across the Yunnan 
border, thereby providing all insurgents with sanctuary 
when needed and with equipment and training. Mao's strategy 
since the late 1920s had placed a high value on the merits 
of operating in border areas, both in China from provinc5xl

friends to distant relatives. China's Khru-
shchev treated Ne Win as a relative but did 
not have a good thought for the Burmese Com-
munists. This is not accidental; there is a 
reason for it. Twenty years ago [1947] our 
party was loyal to Marxism-Leninism and the 
thought of Mao Tse-tung. For this reason 
it is natural that China's Khrushchev, who 
opposes Marxism-Leninism and the thought of 
Mao Tse-tung, should treat us badly. Although 
China's Khrushchev did not like us, we con-
tinued the struggle for more than 19 years 
in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching 
on self-reliance...China's Khrushchev... 
already has had his authority swept in the 
dust. (Speech given at the Peking memorial 
ceremony on 5 July 1967 and published in 
People's Daily on 6 Jul;?) 
But the record indicates that Chou En-lai and Chen Yl were 
far more directly involved in Mao's policy to encourage 
neutralism in Burma starting in 1952 than Liu had been. 
When Mao's policy required that Ne Win should be further 
mollified and that Burmese Communist interests should 
be further subordinated to Peking's foreign policy in-
terests, Liu merely complied with Mao's new line. But 
compliance has been twisted to mean blame for initiating 
a reduction of insurgency.* At a time when Mao and Chou 
*The beginning of the low ebb of the insurgency in 
Burma was "mid-1951" which resulted from "pressure exert-

Review in two parts, the second appearing in the issue 
of 1 September 1967) The article contains statements which 
suggest that disputes had arisen among the Burmese Com-

Peking's image as a reasonable and non-aggressive regime 
following the Sino-Indian border war of late 1962 and 
the Chinese rejection of the partial nuclear test ban 
treaty in mid-1963, the policy was to encourage the Bur-
mese to accept peace talks with Ne Win, and 20 White Flag 
leaders resident in Peking were sent to Burma in October 
1963 to participate in these negotiations. Liu apparently 
was among the Chinese leaders who talked with them (and 
with Burma-based Communists who had come to Peking for 
instructir.ns), but he would not have encouraged them if 
he had not gained Mao's concurrence (if, in fact, he were 
not acting on Mao's instruction). The post facto accusa-

of Liu's earlier prestige in the CCP as the man most 
closely associated from 1949-1951 with the expansion of 
armed struggles in Southeast Asia, the attack also seems 
to be intended as a way to deprive him of that prestige 
and to transfer it to Mao. 
Sino-Burmese relations are formally sustained by 
the continued presence of official representatives in the 
embassy of each country, but Mao's revived revolutionary

Liu Shao-chi has also been made the scapegoat for the 
previous cautious policy toward Overseas Chinese in Burma 
--a policy which Chou En-lai in fact had implemented in 
the period from 1954 to 1966. It was Liu's policy which 
Chen Yi was said to have implemented, and it was part of 
this policy to "capitulate" to Ne Win. "Chen Yi always

about a 'normalization' of relations between the two conn-

additional reason for Ne Win to sustain the close security 
surveillance of Chinese embassy officers and to refuse 
to accept any increase in personnel from the mainland. 
Armed struggle will become a real problem for the govern-
ment, and the prospect is for (1) increased Chinese material 
aid to the guerrillas and (2) strengthening of the contacts 
between White Flag and tribal (mainly) Kachin insurgents 
and formation of Maoist-type guerrilla base-areas. 
2. Nepal 
Nepal has been encouraged to remain neutral not 
only to prevent it from joining CENTO, but also to detach 
it from New Delhi's dominant influence. Mao and Chou moved 
cautiously in the mid-1950s, and when Peking was formally 
recognized by King Mahendra on 1 August 1955, they st'll 
deferred to Nehru's sensibilities, using the Chinese and 
Nepalese ambassadors to New Delhi to act concurrently in 
that capitol as representatives to each other and avoid-
ing the issue of sending an ambassador directly to Kath-
mandu. But following the Tibet revolt in March 1959 and 
intensified Sino-Indian border clashes thereafter, Mao 
and Chou apparently viewed closer relations with the Nepal-
ese as a means to help isolate Nehru internationally. They 
apparently decided to try to make their charges of Indian 
"expansionism" appear credible by treating Nepal as a com-
pletely independent country, intending this to be a con-
trast with New Delhi's depreciatory paternalism. 
At the same time, in tne fall of 1959 they continued 
to view the U.S. as the real threat in Asia, far greater 
than India, and they were worried about the establishment 
of military rule in Pakistan. They tried to operate on 
Mao's incongruous principle of "uniting with while strug-
gling against" Nehru, that is, to tali.: a hard line on their 
territorial claims along the border but to maneuver Nehru 
toward a border agreement which would in itself reduce 
Sino-Indian frictions. They were alert to the possibility 
that a military regime mignt be established in New Delhi

deflect complaints from Indian Communist Party leader 
Ajoy Ghosh that Nehru was being pushed by Peking's policy 
on the border dispute into the "Anglo-American camp." 
Mao and Liu told Ghosh that they were aware of this pos-
sible development, and Liu included India and Nepal among 
the countries which the U.S. intended "to capture...to 
encircle the socialist camp militarily." Mao made a dis-
tinction between Nehru and his "rightist" advisers, who 
wanted to exploit the border dispute to help Washington 
"isolate China." Mao professed to believe that Nehru 
might still be induced to negotiate a border agreement 
with Peking. Characteristically, Liu took a harder line. 
He stated that Nehru's attitude was that of "a reaction-
ary who is basically anti-Communist; he is not even like 
Sukarno, who has apprec5ated the Indonesian Communist 
Party." This was a harder position than Chou En-lai had 
taken regarding Nehru at the time.* Chou was used by Mao 
to try to advance the "unite-with-Nehru" half of his 
policy, and he was sent to New Delhi in April 1960 to 
*Teng Hsiao-ping also depicted Nehru as a reactionary 
and seems to have preferred the "struggle against Nehru" 
half of Mac.s's policy. Teng said that Nehru must be strug-
gled against as well as mollified, otherwise the bloc--he 
meant Khrushchev--would "inflate his reactionary arrog-
ance." (Speer.h of 14 November 1960 at the Moscow con-
ference of Communist parties) The image of Liu and Teng 
which emerges  on their view of Nehru is that 25X1 
they were more disparaging of him than Mao and Chou had 
been. 
Regarding possible differences between Chou's moder-
ate line and the apparent Liu. Teng hard line, Chou's 
prestige among CCP officials had been built partly on his 
ability to work productively vith Nehru, to keep him non-
aligned and a defender of Peking's "rights" in the UN, 
and Chou may have feared that any shift to a harder 
"struggle" line would be capitulating to the Liu-Teng 
pol:.cy of attacking Nehru as a reactionary. Firefights 
on the border and a direct rebuff from Nehru in New Delhi 
in April 1960 impelled Chou to comply with the harder 
line.

convince Nehru and his advisers that it was in their inter-
est to negotiate a border agreement. He was rebuffed, 
and although he tried, almost desperately, at the press 
conference immediately before his return to Peking to 
portray his mission as a new advance, Sino-Indian relations 
continued to worsen. Mao was impelled to use Chou in the 
"struggle-against-Nehru" half of his policy, which in-
cluded a major effort to depict India--in contrast to 
Nepal, Burma, Afghanistan, and Pakistan--as the intransigent 
party in the border dispute. Nepal was accorded even more 
deliberate treatment as a completely independent country 
than ever before. 
Chou En-lai had the major role in moving the Nepal-
ese away from New Delhi, and he was successful in gaining 
their agreement in March 1960 to demilitarize the border 
and to start the process of demarcation. He also had the 
job of try'ng to mollify Prime Minister Koirala in July 
1960 following a Sino-Nepalese firefight near Mustang 
(28 June), in the course of which maneuvering he took a 
soft line, admitting that the cause had been Chinese "care-
lessness," expressing regret, and accepting Nepalese demands 
for compensation--all this in an effort to prevent the 
Nepalese from extensively publicizing the Chinese military 
action and thereby providing New Delhi with an exploitable 
event. In August 1960, the Nepalese had been mollified 
and accepted closer ties as indicated by Peking's place-
ment of an ambassador in Kathmandu. The Chinese leaders 
later (on 4 October 1961) were able to underscore New 
Delhi's intransigence by signing a border agreement with 
the Nepalese (Burma already had been moved into Peking's 
camp with the agreement in 1960). The agreement, when 
finally settled on specific issues, used the "tracP.tional 
boundary" and split the difference on ownership of Mt. 
Everest by drawing the line through its summit. Chou, 
who was impelled to take increasinry hard positions 
regarding Nehru, had been the diplomatir.: commander in 
Lhis exercise. By the spring of 1962, the Chinese were 
exploiting New Delhi's depreciatory pateinalism toward 
Nepal openly, and they formally accused India of 'great-
nation chauvinism," claiming that in India's view "Nepal 
no longer exists, Sikkim no longer exists, and Bhutan no 
longer exists."

Deferential treatment of the Nepalese was used to 
increase the degree of their anti-Indian sentiment, and 
several Chinese leaders indicated their awareness of the 
power of flattery. They made political gains by convinc-
ing Nepalese officials that only fairminded leaders of a 
big country would respect the sensibilities of leaders of 
a small country. They also made gains by indirectly dis-
paraging the Indians. For example, implying a contrast 
with the courageous Nepalese fighters, Chen Yi in December 
1962 disparaged Indian soldiers in the course of a discus-
sion with Nepal's Special Ambassador R. Shaha. Reporting 
to Imerican officials about his December 1962 trip to 
Peking, Shaha also stated that Liu, Chou, and Chen had 
"impressed" him with their "Oriental politeness," citing 
as an example Liu's behavior in descending from his office 
to the street to hold the car door open for him; he did 
not say why he believed this was uniquely Oriental. Chou 
handled the important substantive matters with him and 
insisted that Shaha ask King Mahendra to agree in writing 
to stipulate in the Sino-Nepalese aid agreement that the 
Chinese have the permission to bring into Nepal "from 
the north" heavy equipment necessary to build the 65-mile 
Kodari-Kathmandu road. Chou stated that New Delhi would 
not permit this equipment to come to Nepal through India, 
and when, on 13 January 1963, a protocol was signed in 
Kathmandu concerning the "machinery" as well as the experts 
and goods to be provided for building the road, the impli-
cation was that Chou had won his point on moving equipment 
into Nepal "from the north." This was an important advance 
in the effort to increase Peking's influence and c7.oser 
contacts by cutting out New Delhi from Sino-Nepalese rela-
tions and operating from Tibet. 
Mao had moved a considerable distance in a common 
cause with a "feudal" .v'egime, leaving his doctrinal posi-
tion to be adjusted late:- in the course of the advance. 
Justification for working with "feudalists" was finally 
set forth in the important CCP letter to the CPSU on 14 
June 1963: among our allies we may include "certain kings, 
princes, and aristocrats, who are patriotic." Mao's aides 
sustained the advance with new offers of economic assist-
ance, and regarding a prestige project of the King's?the

aligned just north of the Indian-Nepalese border--the 
Chinese signed an agreement on 27 April 1964 to finance 
their part of this road with $20 million.* But the King 
was impelled by pressure from New Delhi to turn over the 
project to the Indian government. As a result, the Chi-
nese leaders in March 1965 were confronted with a rebuff 
to which they could have replied in high dudgeon, but Mao 
and Chou apparently decided to absorb the insult and of-
fer support for additional aid projects. They chose not 
to warm Indian hearts with the spectacle of a Sino-Nepal-
ese political dispute and they apparently did not protest 
the King's decision. However, they implicitly warned the 
Nepalese against New Delhi's dilatory tactics to prolong 
the presence of Indian aid experts in the country. On

to reassure a Nepalese delegation that they wanted to 
continue the aid policy, inasmuch as Nepal was pursuing 
an "independent" foreign policy. Mao was critical of aid 
projects from unspecified "other" countries which were 
dragged out to permit a continued foreign presence, and 
he stressed to Crown Prince Birendra the importance of 
sustaining a policy of self-reliance--an implicit warn-
ing against accepting more aid from New Delhi and Wash-
ington. During the visit, the Crown Prince and his dele-
gation attained agreement for an additional $20 million 
in aid (the final documents were signed on 21 December 
1966). Sino-Nepalese relations continued on a friendly 
basis until the spring and summer of 1967 when in the 
course of Mao's purge on the mainland his cult was exported 
to Nepal. When, on 25 May 1967, a Chinese economic dele-
gation signed an agreement to build a hydroelectric plant, 
a second long road and two short ones in the Kathmandu 
valley), and cooperated with the Nepalese to prepare for 
the celebration of the opening of the Kathmandu-Kodari 
road on the 26th, Mao's policy toward Nepal seemed to be 
unchanged by the purge on the mainland. 
However, "revolutionized" Chinese officials had 
returned to the embassy in late May following their in-
doctrination in Peking on the methods for and necessity 
of disseminating the Mao-cult abroad. In NCNA's account 
of the Kathmandu-Kodari road opening ceremony on 26 May, 
Nepalese sensitivities were irritated by the ludicrous 
claim that "many" Nepalese people shouted that "the great 
leader, Chairman Mao, is the red sun which shines most 
brightly in the hearts of the people all over the world." 
The Mao-cult was also being disseminated along the road 
between the capitol, Kathmandu, and the Nepalese village 
on the Tibet border, Kodari, according to a USAID employee 
who had taken a trip along the road and reported to the 
American embassy in mid-July that Nepalese workers, school 
boys, and even a beggar were wearing Mao badges at all 
points along the road. He also stated that the Chinese

  The export of the Mao-cult 
beginning in the spring of 1967 on a large scale and with 
increasing openness by the embassy in Kathmandu and Chinese 
aid experts along the raod--10 to 15 bags of mail a day 
came through the Nepalese postal system from Kodari con-
taining mostly printed material--alerted the Foreign Minis-
try to the probability of a showdown. The Nepalese press 
in Kathmandu began to complain about the cult and these 
complaints helped start a chain of events which turned 
Sino-Nepalese relations onto a rocky road. 
In March and April 1967, several papers commented 
on the implication of photos (published in Peking Review 
on 24 February 1967) that the Nepalese peasants aria-Vaili-
ers consider Mao to be their leader. The Foreign Ministry 
did not formally protest, but "discussed" the matter with 
officials at the Chinese embassy. On June 17, 24, and 
25, Chinese embassy officials conducted anti-India and 
anti-U?S demonstrations for Chinese diplomats transitting 
Kathmandu airport after their expulsion from New Delhi, 
and tto Nepalese leaders warned the Chinese against such 
actions, at first indirectly in a confidential circular 
to all embassies (on 22 June) and later directly following 
the demonstration on the 25th. Foreign Minister Bista 
and Foreign Ministry Secretary Singha apparently took a 
"firm line" with the Chinese ambassador and embassy of-
ficials, warning them to abide by Nepalese regulations 
if they wished to remain in the country. The Nepalese 
press was less restrained, and 
criticized the Chinese by 
name for trying to dissiminate the Mao-cult and for dis-
regarding diplomatic propriety.

Following the airport incidents, deep anti-Peking 
resentments were sustained among officials and students. 
On the evening of 1 July, anti-Chinese students demanded 
that the red star and the PRC flag should be removed from 
the Chinese exhibition at the fairgrounds during the an-
nual King's birthday fete. fhey complained that there 
was no tribute to the King at the Chinese stall and that, 
on the contrary, only Mao was being idolized. They burned 
Mao in effigy and attacked a Chinese photographer and an 
embassy car. A Nepalese official promised to comply with 
the students' demands (and was later criticized in the 
Chinese protest of 8 July for having done so). The anti-
Chinese students acted after a smaller group of pro-Chi-
nese had moved from the local college to the fairgrounds 
and raised pro-Chinese posters. According to another ac-
count, the anti-Chinese students had given the Nepalese 
authorities an ultimatum, expiring on 1 July, to remove 
Ma- 's portrait from the Chinese stall and warned that they 
would pull it down if the authorities failed to act. In 
any case, the resentment following the gauche demonstra-
tions of revolutionary Chinese embassy officials at the 
airport* had burst into anti.-Chinese group action, and 
one mob marched from the fairgrounds to the center of 
town, throwing books of quotations from Mao onto the 
street from a stall specializing in Chinese Communist 
publications and tearing down the sign over the Sino-
Nepalese Friendship Library. 
There is some evidence which suggests that the 
professionals--viz., the men in the Chinese embassy and 
in the Foreign Ministry--reacted with caution, but that 
"revolutionized" non-professionals later decided to take 
a hard line by accusing Kathmandu of complicity. Following 
*The airport demonstrations had started a government-
supported campaign to curtail dissemination of the Mao-
cult in Nepal and part of the effort had been encourage-
ment of the press to print articles critical of Chinese 
activities. In addition, local schools had been ordered 
to prohibit the waring of Mao buttons.

the 1 July incidents, Peking Radio did not comment im-
mediately, and the Chinese at first kept the dispute in 
private channels./ 
/ Peking's 
first comment, a broadcast of 5 July, was (for the Chinese 
Communists) relatively non-provocative, accusing only the 
U.S. and India of responsibility for the 1 July incidents. 
As late as 8 July, a Nepalese newspaper, known to have 
had contacts with Chinese embassy officials, announced 
that Peking had asked Nepalese students (who left in 1966) 
to return to the mainland to resume classes by 10 August. 
(Nepal's Foreign Secretary told U.S. officials that he 
had questioned the Chinese ambassador "recently" on the 
promised return of Nepalese students and the ambassador 
simply said he would query Peking.) As of 8 July, the 
Chinese embassy had not publicized the protest. Chou En-
lai may have been making the'decisions for Mao on handling 
the Nepalese situation, trying to dampen down the effects 
on Sino-Nepalese relations of the 1 July incidents while 
authorizing a protest as a warning to the King and his 
aides against further incidents. 
Non-professional fanatics in the Foreign Ministry 
may have intervened on 8 July to charge the Nepalese 
government for the first time with complicity. This may 
have been the reason for the change to a hard line on the 
8th, Their intervention suggests that they had (or believ-
ed they had) Mao's permission to take an abusive, undip-
lomatic line. In any case, a "revolutionary" decision 
was made, and on 8 July the 4 July protest was pub-
licized along with a claim that in the protest "the 
Chinese ambassador., on instruction of the Chinese 
government" pointed out that the incidents were "plan-
ned" by the U.S. and India and were "approved and 
supported by the Nepalese government." The 8 July NCNA 
report criticized "reactionary forces in Nepal" for pro-
hibiting the wearing of Mao buttons and carrying of Mao-
quotation books by Nepalese students. These and other

charges in the 8 July blast took many Nepalese officials 
by surprise, inasmuch as they believed that the Chinese 
leaders in Peking were acting as professionally and 
rationally as the ambassador in an effort to downplay the 
incidents. The Nepalese tried to prevent the situation 
from escalating into a major exchange of recriminations. 
Their Foreign Ministry denial of the 8 July NCNA accusa-
tions as "false and baseless" was carried in the govern-
ment press on 10 July without comment, and on 11 July, 
the Director of Publicity tried to convince all non-govern-
ment editors of the need to make no comment. Despite the 
effort, some editorials were published, attacking both 
prohibited subjects, namely, China and Mao, by name. More 
importantly, the Foreign Secretary reported that the Chi-
nese ambassador did not react vehemently in response to 
the Nepalese protest of 10 July--a protest which had been 
combined with assurances of Kathmandu's interest in good 
relations with China. The Chinese ambassador, in turn, 
stated that Peking did not rish to embarrass Nepal. 
In direct contrast to the moderate and rational 
behavior of the Chinese ambassador, an NCNA report of 21 
July thundered a series of demands to Kathmandu, dictating 
a hard line to the Chinese ambassador. It sarcastically 
referred to Nepalese professions to "the Chinese ambas-
sador" of a desire to maintain good relations and then 
demanded that Kathmandu "must promptly annul all measures 
discriminating against China and stop all anti-Chinese 
utterances and deeds on Nepalese territory." (emphasis 
supplied) In contrast to the non-vitriolic reaction of 
the Chinese ambassador to Nepal's 10 July protest of rCNA's 
8 July harangue, the NCNA blast of 21 July declared that 
the Nepalese government had refused "to admit" complicity 
in the anti-Chinese incidents: "The Chinese government 
catagorically rejected this unwarranted protest." (emphasis 
supplied) The Chinese ambassador, Yang Kung-su, was not 
mentioned by name (as he had been, favorably, in the NCNA 
blast of 8 July) and the new protest note was made in the 
name of the "Chinese embassy"--a more impersonal formula-
tion. He may have been in trouble over his failure to 
reject all the protests which Nepalese officials had made 
since the confidential circular of 22 June 196Y. The

ambassador apparently was recalled and replaced as acting 
chief of the embassy by Li Chung-ho, the charge. Fanatic 
non-professionals who, it is here conjectured, may have 
been permitted by Mao to make the hard-line decisions, 
apparently were trying to defend their irrational actions 
when they later insisted that it had been the Nepalese 
"and not the NCNA report" of 8 July which had damaged 
Kathmandu's reputation. (NCNA report of 21 July 1967) 
Chou En-lai apparently was not permitted to reas-
sert a rational and professional attitude in Sino-Nepalese 
relations until mid-August. According to Nepal's Foreign 
Secretary, the Chinese charge, who returned from Peking 
to the Chinese embassy on 14 August, hand-carried a letter 
to King Mahendra from Cllou in which Chou stated that in 
the interests of "friendship," the Chinese would take no 
retaliatory actions in Peking (presumably against Nepal-
ese officials and their embassy) for the recent anti-
Chinese actions in Nepal. This significant foreign policy 
move suggests that Chou continues to be the man responsible 
for the ingredients of sanity and relative restraint that 
appear, on occasion, to cut across Mao's compulsion to 
shift all aspects of Peking's foreign policy to the left. 
Although elements of rationality have reappeared 
and open hostility has subsided from the peak of July 
1967, Mao's Nepal policy has been shifted to the left.* 
*Peking and Kathmandu dropped recriminations in August 
1967 and both sides have reaffirmed traditional "friend-
ship," the Chinese charge in his speech at the dedication 
ceremony for a Chinese warehouse project in Xathmandu on 
27 September and King Mahendra in his message of 1 October 
to Mao. However, Peking's behavior in July has made the 
Nepalese more suspicious of the Chinese then they had been 
in recent years. The government has established a commit-
tee in the Foreign Ministry to investigate the activities 
and contacts of all Foreign Ministry officials and staff 
members to determine which of them are agents of Peking 
and Moscow. Another Foreign Ministry committee has been 
established to evaluate security reports on the activities 
of Chinese and Soviet officials.

requiring demonstrations of official contempt for any 
Nepalese contacts with the U.S. despite the major concern 
to mollify Kathmandu, on occasion, in order to prevent 
New Delhi from reasserting its influence more extensively 
in the country.* 
3. Afghanistan 
Afghanistan's unobtrusive neutralism and generally 
inactive role in major international developments have 
kept it on the periphery of Peking's foreign policy ef-
forts, and its top diplomats have been less active in 
Kabul than in any "friendly" country on mainland borders. 
Nevertheless, Mao permitted Chou to enlist its leaders 
in his cause to demonstrate extensive international reco-
gnition of the Peking regime as a major world power fol-
lowing the Korean war and the Geneva conference of 1954. 
Ambassadors were exchanged in July 1955 following Chou's 
diplomatic contacts at the Bandung conference, and on 19 
January 1957, Chou for the first time visited Kabul and 
*The Chinese ambassador's replacement continued to act 
as a "revolutionized" diplomat in September, but subsided 
finally in December. He stated on 27 September 1967 that 
"we will be able to implement the diplomacy and principles 
followed by Chairman Mao. We shall strongly support the 
national struggle for freedom in Asia, Africa, and Latin 
America, and we shall strongly oppose the imperialist 
policies of aggression and war, and we shall also oppose 
the policy of surrender of revisionism..." (emphasis sup-
plied) When, therefore, airport ceremonies were held at 
the departure on 20 October of the King and Queen for their 
State Visit to the U.S., the Chinese were the only embassy 
group unrepresented, and this incensed Nk..palese Foreign 
Ministry officials. However, the Chinese charge appeared 
at the airport ceremonies on 10 December to welcome the 
King and Queen on their return.

had "friendly talks" with Prime Minister Daud and other  
leaders.r 
With the development of the Sino-Indian and Sino-
Soviet disputes, Mao and Chou apparently hoped to add the 
Afghans to their camp, or at least deter them from adopt-
ing New Delhi's and Moscow's positions against Peking's 
on a whole range of issues. A friendship and nonaggres-
sion treaty was signed in 1960, a border agreement was 
signed in November 19631* and in March 1965.economic aid 
and cultural exchange agreements were concluded. But 
the Chinese have not come close to the level of Soviet 
economic aid, viz., $600 million, and they are arguing 
with the Afghans about details for implementing the Parwan 
Irrigation Project on the Panjshir River. More importantly, 
the Afghans have not been responsive to Chinese efforts 
to recruit them to attack U.S. policy on Vietnam. They 
rebuffed Liu Shao-chi and his delegation ol 8 April 1966 
when the Chinese tried to induce them to condemn that 
policy in the Sino-Afghan joint communique issued at the 
end of his 5-day visit. The communique implied a diverg-
ence of views on Vietnam and the U.S., as witness the use  
of the phrase, "res ective stands." 
*Peng Chen on 22 November 1963 made the signing cere-
mony the occasion for an indirect jibe at India's intran-
sigence, noting that four countries--Burma, Nepal, Pakistan, 
and Afghanistan--had adopted an attitude of "active coopera-
tion."

Thus far, however, ths. unobtrusive Afghans have 
not stirred any deep resentments and the Chinese have as-
sured Kabul that Mao's purge would not affect the two 
Afghan art students who are on the mainland and have been 
permitted to continue their studies there. 
4. Ceylon 
Mao and Chou established contacts with Ceylon's 
leaders in 1952 when a trade agreement on an exchange of 
Chinese rice for Ceylonese rubber was signed, but they 
remained at a low level. Prime Minister Kotelawala's non-
alignment policy had not prevented him from criticizing 
Communist colonialism and suggesting a "two Chinas" plan 
at the Bandung conference in April 1955. Later, however, 
Prime Minister Bandaranaike turned Ceylou's nonalignment 
policy into a warmer relationship with Peking and as a 
direct result of an important visit by Chou En-lai, diplo-
matic relations were established on 7 February 1957 after 
"fully satisfactory" discussions with Bandaranaike (Chou's 
foreign policy report of 5 March 1957). Relations became 
cooler following Ceylon's criticism of the PLA suppression 
of the Tibet revolt in 1959 and Peking's rejection of the 
Colombo Conference proposals of December 1962 as binding 
"preconditions" for starting talks on the Sino-Indian 
border dispute.*

a Maritime Transport Agreement (July 1963) providing

for vessels of the two countries to sail to and from the 
ports of either country and to undertake cargo and passenger 
services between them and with third countries. Mrs. 
Bandaranaike's opposition later distorted this agreement, 
alleging, during the March 1965 general election, that, 
as the former Prime Minister, she had entered into a 
secret agreement with Peking, providing the Chinese with 
naval base rights in Trincomalee and giving Chinese war-
ships access to Ceylon's ports. In mid-March, Mrs. Ban-
daranaike issued a communique asserting that the agree-
ment was "essentially a pact to regulate commercial ship-
ping," and the former Port Commissioner in Colombo reaf-
firmed this position to a U.S, embassy officer in November 
1966. 
Mao's purge and the "revolutionization" of his 
diplomacy and diplomats exacerbated Sino-Ceylonese rela-
tions to an unprecedented degree.* Prime Minister D. 
Senanayake apparently was angered by information provided 
him by security officials during a briefing on I March 
1967 regarding shipments into Ceylon of Maoist propaganda 
tracts and their sale on the local market or trans-ship-
ment to India. He was further angered by the defense of 
Mao's purge--a defense which was made publicly in late 
March by Ceylon's ambassador to Peking, Robert Gunawardena, 
during a two-week home leave visit.

interest in recruiting Gunawardena and supporting him as 
a leader of the pro-CCP group of the Ceylon Communists, 
politburo member N. Sanmagathasan was still the Chinese 
leaders' first choice. On 26 May 1967, NCNA carried an 
account of his speech to Red Guards in Peking in which 
he depicted Peking as the "center of world revolution" 
and Mao as "the greatest teacher, leader, and Marxist 
25X1 
25X1 
Leninist alive." 
The immediate cause of open Sino-Ceylonese recrimina-
tions, however, was the alleged theft of Chinese goods 
and the delay of a parcel of Mao buttons (addressed to 
the Chinese embassy) by Ceylon's customs officials. The 
Chinese embassy sent a protest note to the government on 
15 August compla:ning of "an open robbery of the export 
goods from China and the diplomatic articles of the Chi-
nese embassy" at the port of Colombo. The note was then 
released to the press, indicating that the Chinese embassy 
had been instructed not to downplay the incident and to 
move recriminations into public channels. Release of the 
note to the press forced Ceylonese officials, who had 
preferred to keep the exchange in private channels, to 
release their reply to the press. Their counter-protest 
of 19 August rejected as "fr'volous and absurd" the Chinese 
charge of government complicity in the theft of the Chinese 
goods. Regarding the delay of the parcel of 300 Mao but-
tons, the Ceylonese counter-protest note stated that the 
government was exercising legitimate authority in asking 
what reasonable use the Chinese embassy of 34 persons 
had for 300 buttons. It went on to say that wh le a rea-
sonable quantity of buttons for the embassy was acceptable,

the government could not agree to the importat.on of 300, 
"the bulk of which could be distributed to residents of 
Ceylon." The note in effect warned the Chinese (and 
local sympathizers) not to go too far in spreading the 
Mao-cult in Ceylon. The Chinese reply was to organize 
a demonstration in front of Ceylon's embassy in Peking 
on 20 August and Lo send a note to Colombo through the 
Chinese embassy there on the 22nd (publicized by NCNA on 
the 23rd). The note of 22 August opened a general attack 
on Colombo, ostensibly for inviting Chinese Nationalist 
girl-guides to participate in a Colombo conference on 12 
August, but actually for retributive motives.* Demonstra-
tions against the embassy in Peking were again staged in 
early September, but these were closely controlled, non-
violent, and were neither as sustained as the early Febru-
ary 1967 siege of the Soviet embassy or the entry and burn-
ing of offices in the Indonesian and British embassies 
on 5 and 22 August, respectively. 
The Chinese now seem to be reluctant to warm Indian 
hearts by protracting the dispute with Colombo. Aware 
that New Delhi had openly speculated about the possibility 
in September that Peking would not renew its rice-for-
rubber barter arrangement, as part of its trade-and-pay-
ments agreement with Colombo, the Chinese probably were 
further impelled to conclude a new five-year agreement 
on 6 November (with annual contracts to be negotiated and 
quantities and prices to be worked out each year). How-
ever, increased support for pro-Peking Communists may 
provoke Colombo into a new round of pr tests, to which 
the Chinese leaders, operating under a new and more revo-
lutionary policy, almost certainly would respond with open 
vituperation.

II, An Anti-Communist Quasi-Ally: Pakistan 
a Mao and Chou apparently viewed Pakistan as a counter-
weight to India in South Asia, and ever since the estab-
lishment of Sino-Pakistani relations in May 1951, they 
have avoided antagonizing Karachi on the important Kashmir 
issue. Unlike the Soviets, who supported Indian claims, 
they equivocated, which meant a refusal to recognize In-
dian sovereignty over the area. Chou took an equivocal 
public position on Kashmir when pressed on the matter 
during a news conference in Karachi on 24 December 1956, 
saying that he had not "studied" the matter and adroitly 
suggesting that India and Pakistan settle it by negotia-
tions. By contrast, Moscow had recognized the juridical 
accession of Kashmir to India; negotiat'ons were unaccept-
able. Mao and Chou were displeased with Pakistan's par-
ticipation in SEATO and CENTO--"As everybody knows, we 
differ on certain questions. Take the Manila Treaty 
and the Baghdad Pact for example." (Chou's 5 March 1957 
statement on his visit to Pakistan in late December 1956) 
Nevertheless, they chose to view this participation as 
directed against India and the USSR rather than against 
the Peking regime and they were alert to Karachi's policy 
of avoiding hostility toward them. 
From Karachi's viewpoint, in 1959 and 1960 Peking 
was becoming the enemy of India, and the U.S. was becom-
ing India's best friend. Karachi, therefore, tried to 
gain greater support against India by moving toward a 
closer relationship with Peking and when, in December 1960, 
the Chinese were trying to isolate India and suggested 
border negotiations with the Pakistanis, the latter com-
plied and agreed "in principle" rn the need to hammer out 
a definitive boundary, By December 1962, they had also 
agreed in principle on the "alignment" of their common 
border, and on 2 March 1963 the border agreement was con-
cluded. Chou was publicly defensive about Peking's move 
toward an anti-Communist military dictatorship, but cleverly 
put the onus of opportunism on the Pakistanis: he con-
ceded in an interview on 31 March 1963 in Peking that there 
is "a certain contradiction" between Pakistan's signing 
of a border agreement with the mainland regime and its 
membership in SEATO.

Pakistan's complaints about U.S. and Soviet aid 
to India provided the Chinese leaders with the opportunity 
to move President Ayub into a closer quasi-alliance with 
Peking. Mao and Chou were anxious to apply more pressure 
on India and embarrass the U.S. Closer relations with 
Pakistan could also be used to demonstrate that the foreign 
policy of Mao and Chou had not resulted in increased iso-
lation of Peking.* Pakistan's ties with the U.S. were 
discreetly handled; that is, they were not criticized. 
Puring his visit to Pakistan in February 1964, Chou took 
a "very reasonable" line on Sino-U.S. differences in try-
ing to impress Ayub with his open-mindedness on Sino-U.S. 
talks. Ayub said Chou emphasized that he was prepared 
to be very reasonable, accommodat:ng, and patient in im-
plementing an agreement once it was obtained "in principle," 
but the American ambassador had to expla n to the President 
that the agreement Chou mentioned was simply one f^r a 
U.S. surrender on the Taiwan issue. During his v!sit, 
Chou may have arranged to provide Pakistan with military 
aid in the form of PLA advisers and various kinds of 
equipment, but reports of a "mutual defense" agreement 
at the time may have reflected a vague promise of unspe-
cified Chinese action of a limited nature in the event 
of an India-Pakistan war. In any case, by February 1964, 
Ayub had become Mao's quasi-ally. 
As the Chinese and Pakistanis moved toward a closer 
relationship, Chen Yi indicated that Peking's effort was 
directed against three major enemies of Mao's regime,

Mao himself, avoiding any reference to Ayub's hard line 
on local Communists or to his ties with the U.S., declared 
that he "appreciated" Ayub's support on various questions 
of Peking's international relations. (Interview with Pakis-
tan's Commerce Minister on 16 July 1964) From Ayub's 
viewpoint, the increasing willingness of the Chinese lead-
ers to join with him in a common front--including some 
unspecified form of PLA help--against New Delhi encouraged 
him in his anti-India belligerency. 
Short of committing the PLA to defend Pakistan, 
Mao and Chou apparently were willing to supply increas-

were cautious on the subject of just how the PLA would  
help.r

becoming more isolated in the country, and they tried to 
purchase advertising space in the local press to pub-

Following two four-hour sessions with Bhutto on 
3 and 4 September, Chen Yi at a press conference on the 
4th spoke in the name of the "Chinese government and 
people" to warn that they would "firmly support" Pakistan's 
action to repel India's "armed provocations." On 5 Septem-
ber, a People's Daily Observer article "advised" New Delhi 
to stop "bullying" Pakistan,. In neither of the statements 
was Peking thus far committed to active participation in  
the fighting.  
On 7 September, however, Mao and his aides appar-
ently decided in the interests of helping Ayub, to hint 
for the first time at Chinese intervention by claiming 
Indian "intrusions and provocations" along the Sino-Indian 
border and by declaring that Peking is "strengthening its 
defenses and heightening its alertness along its borders." 
(PRC government statement of 7 September 1965) This in-
creased the political support of the Chinese but commit-
ted the PLA only to preparing for an Indian attack. Re-

personal involvement was used to warn New Delhi that 
Pakistan had a major ally. On 7 September, Peking in-
dicated higher-level support--that is, higher than Chen 
Yi's--by publicly and prominently referring to talks held 
between Pakistan's ambassador and Chou; on 8 September, 
reference was made, also publicly and prominently, to 
talks between the ambassador and Liu Shao-chi. 
On 8 September, the date of Liu's discussions with 
the ambassador, the Chinese leaders began to edge their 25X1 
way toward a military commitment to use the PLA as a 
maneuvering force on the border in support of the acticns  
of a non-Communist regime. / 
Developments suggest that Chou felt impelled ;-o 
take the strongest and most vigorous anti-Indian positions 
that he publicly has ever taken. Ever since 1959, when 
relations with India had begun to deteriorate, Chou seems 
to have been vulnerable to criticism from within the Chi-
nese leadership for having codd39d New Delhi with his five 
principles of peaceful coexistence and talk of Asian unity. 
In the mid-1950s, Mao had permitted Chou to play the major 
role in exploiting the concept of India's nonalignment, 
and in the mid-1960s, Mao apparently has permitted him 
to clear his (Chou's own) name from association with such 
a moderate policy. Speaking at the Korean embassy on 9 
September 1965 in the presence of men who may have cri-
ticized his India policy, namely, Liu Shao-chi, Teng 
Hsiao-ping, and P.ang Chen, Chou dissociated himself from 
his India policy of the 1950s in the most explicit terms 
he has ever used on the matter in public: 
India's armed aggression against Pa.istan 
thoroughly exposed the Indian reactionaries' 
vaunted nonsense about their policy of non-
alignment and peaceful coexistence. How can 
there be a peaceful and neutral country that

commits aggression at will against its neigh-
bors? How can there be a model of peace-
ful coexistence that interprets aggression as 
peace? The Chinese government holds that 
right and wrong must be distinguished in in-
ternational relations, and that such major 
issues of principle as that between aggres-
sion and anti-aggression must never be steeped 
in the dyeing pot of so-called nonalignment 
and peaceful coexistence. (emphasis supplied) 
This repetitious attack on "peaceful coexistence" in the 
context of India's image--an imnge which he, more than 
any other Chinese leader, had piayed the major role in 
creating--suggests that Chou was anxious to go beyond 
earlier positions to obliterate the record of his earlier 
unity policy toward New Delhi at a time when he was vulner-
able to other leaders' criticism of him for that earlier 
policy. Regarding the Pakistan-India war, Chou made a 
vague "stern warning" to New Delhi and hinted at hypothe-
tical PLA involvement by depicting the war as "unfolding 
beside China." Chou's abovementioned statement was also 
an implicit criticism of the Soviet effort to expos-, Peking's 
encouragement of the Pakistanis to fight, and the PRC 
statement of 10 September attacked Moscow for desiring 
a cease-fire and for failing to distinguish between India 
("the aggressor") and Pakistan "Its victim"). Soviet 
complaints that the Chinese leaders were anxious to fan 
the flames of the conflict reflected a good understand-
ing of what Mao was in fact trying to do. 
Mao apparently viewed his support of Ayub as a major 
political war by proxy against the Soviet leaders who were 
supporting Shastri. His opposition to the Soviet leaders' 
efforts toward a peaceful solution pr bably increased 
significantly by 13 September. On that day, TASS issued 
a statement which, in effect, warned Mao not to get the  
PLA involved in the conflict.?

against Moscow's advice for a compromise. For example, 
Moscow's advice for restraint in the polemic was rejected 
by him in October 1962 (during the Cuban missile crisis),  
in July 1964 (during an interview  ), 25X1 
and in February 1965 (during an interview with Kosygin). 
By September 1965, his contempt for Moscow's advice on 
moving toward peace in Vietnam and his desire to attack 
the concept of "peaceful settlements" of international 
disputes were among the motivating factors in his apparent 
decision to keep the Pakistan-India war inflamed. His 
reaction to the TASS warning of the 13th was to act dir-
ectly contrary to it. 
For the first time in the Sino-Indian border dis-
pute, Mao committed the PLA to some form of action within  
a specified time limit. Such a drastic and politically 
vulnerable commitment could not have been made by any 
Chinese leader other than Mao? it was too important, and 
it was an unprecedented involvement in a military situa-
tion in support of a non-Communist quasi-ally. The Indians 
received the full force of this major decision in a note 
delivered to their charge in Peking on 16 September 1965 
at 1 o'clock in the morning. Rejecting Soviet advice, 
it threatened the Indians with "grave consequences" aris-
ing from their failure to comply with this ultimatum to dis-
mantle structures on the Sikkim-Tibet border within three  
days. An official of the Indian embassy in Washington, 
Bannerjee, told a U.S. official on the evening of the 
16th that formerly he had been the Indian charge in Peking 
and had accepted 83 Chinese Communist protest notes, but 
he had never seen one like this. 
Mao had additional motives for making this unpre-
cedented commitment, the most immediate being his desires 
? (a) to humiliate the Indians and (b) to force them to 
ease pressure on Pakistani forces which were taking a 
beating after 11 September. Regarding the humiliation 
? aspect, Mao apparently was prepared to have PLA forces 
attack Indian troops if they did not pull down the struc-
tures on the Sikkim-Tibet border; the existence of these 
structures was privately conceded on 17 September by the

Indian Army Chief of Staff.* Mao and his aides were pre-
pared to disparage the Indians if they did comply with 
the ultimatum to dismantle them. Regarding the easing 
of pressure on Pakistani forces, the Chinese leaders ap-
parently believed that the implied threat of a PLA thrust 
down the Chumbi Valley within three days (i.e., on the 
19th, on expiration of the unprecedented ultimatum) might 
have the effect of drawing off Indian forces from the  
fighting or of tying them down./ 
 ** Regarding Mao's anti-Soviet motiva-
tion, it was expressed in the People's Daily editorial 
of 18 September which accused the "Soviet leaders" of 
working with the U.S. and implied that, despite private 
Soviet warnings about the dangers of PLA involvement, the 
Chinese leaders were justified in encouraging Ayub to keep 
fighting. Further, the Soviet charge regarding Peking's 
"incendiary" behavior was a betrayal of all true revolu-
tionaries. By depicting the Soviet leaders as being com-
pletely in the camp of Washington and New Delhi, the Chi-
nese went beyond positi.ons which the Pakistanis and the 
North Vietnamese had maintained regarding ties with Moscow. 
The question arises: In what sense was the ultima-
tum. implying some for of PLA action, a risk? Militarily,

in the western sector) was a small risk, in view of the 
Chinese capability to handle Indian forces on the border 
in previous skirmishes. Psychologically, the Indians had 
been given a bloody nose in 1962 and were reluctant to 
take another beating. 
Politically, however, Mao and his aides were taking 
a bigglr risk. They could not control the situation--that 
is, they could not prevent (as they were trying to prevent) 
Ayub from negotiating his way out of the war. They had 
committed the PLA to some form of action against Indian 
forces and they had touted their ultimatum publicly, so 
that not to act would be construed internationally as a 
backdown. When, on 18 September, Ayub and his aides de-
cided to save their remaining forces by ending the war, 
Mao's diplomats were out on a political limb. They had 
to explain that Peking had delayed its ultimatum by three 
days more in order to provide an opportunity for the fight-
ing to stop, as witness Chen Yi's "explanation" of 20 
September to an Afghan Foreign Office officia.* Chen 
was referring to the Chinese fallback note on the 19th 
which extended the deadline to the 22nd and which diluted 
the psychological advantage that Peking had had over New 
Delhi as master directing serf to comply with a command. 
As the new deadline of the 22nd approached, the Chinese 
tried to regain their psychological advantage by claim-
ing that the Indians had demolished their old positions 
on the Jelep La Pass surreptitiously and had abandoned 
other military structures on three other Sikkim passes. 
(Peking broadcast of 21 September 1965) It is difficult

of the 19th to meet on Soviet soil for talks with Shastri. 
He probably informed Mao that whatever he had intended 
? to do with PLA forces when the ultimatum expired on the 
'.9th, Mao had better not do it. Ayub told Ambassador 
Conaughy on the 20th that he had sent a message to Peking, 
"recently," telling the Chinese leaders "For God's sake 
do not come in. Do not aggravate the situation." This 
message apparently was sufficient cause for Mao to desist 
and to leave to his diplomats the task of backing down.

to separate out just what action the Indians had taken 
and it is only a conjecture that they may have in fact 
demolished the structures at the Jelep La Pass. As for 
the additional Chinese claim that they abandoned other 
structures, Peking may have distorted the matter by fail-
ing to mention that some of these structures had been 
abandoned since 1962. In any case, the Chinese claimed 
that the Indians had been forced to comply by destroying 
their "military works" on Chinese territory and allowed 
the deadline to pass without using the PLA. (People's  
Daily article of 22 September 1965) The cease-fire be-
tween India and Pakistan went into effect on the 22nd. 
Mao and his aides, having complied with Ayub's re-
quest to take no action on the border, emerged from the 
crisis at a political disadvantage in relation to New 
Delhi (which criticized Peking's interference and aggres. 
siveness) and Moscow (which defended the Indians in 
various ways, including extensive coverage of New Delhi's 
notes of protest regarding Chinese interference). Inter-
national opinion, which was extremely critical of Mao's 
war-like interference in the India-Pakistan fighting and 
favorable to Moscow, confronted Mao with a major foreign 
policy defeat.* Ayub's agreement to the cease-fire almost 
certainly was a development which Mao favored the least, 
and other Chinese leaders implied that Ayub had deserted

demonstrate war-like interference was reflected later in

troubled waters" by supporting Pakistan against Indian 
aggression and for Kashmir self-determination. Should

the Kashmiris.* Mao was also confronted with the need to 
have his diplomats explain that Peking's retreat from the 
ultimatum of 16 September had been the result of Indian 
compliance with Chinese demands, and Chen Yi on 29 Sept-
ember used part of his frenetic press conference to try 
to demonstrate that the PLA could handle not only the In-
dians but also the Americans, British, and Russians--all 
at the same time. 
The political risk which Mao had fastened upon Pek-
ing by issuing the unprecedented time-limit ultimatum of 
16 September was a new departure in Chinese Communist 
foreign policy. This deep commitment to the national 
policy interests of a non-Communist regime--that is, to 
Ayub's military venture--had tied Peking's policy too 
closely to that of a government whose actions could not 
be controlled by the Chinese. This move apparently re-
flected Mao's int;reasing reluctance, in recent years, to 
act on the basis of what his foreign policy experts (Chou, 
particularly) tell him about the probable dangerous con-
sequences of revolutionary moves. In any case, the Chi-
nese leaders tried to absorb the political defeat and 
retain Ayub as a useful counterweight to India, Peking's 
major enemy in South Asia, and on 4 October 1965, Po I-
po provided some rather strained reassurance to a visit-
ing Pakistani delegation by professing that Sino-Pakistani 
friendship "can stand all tests." 
*Po I-po on 29 September declared that Peking would 
not desert the Kashmiris: "the Chinese people will not 
cease for a single day their support to the people of 
Kashmir in their struggle for their right to self-de-
termination; this stand of China will never change." 
(emphasis supplied) Chou En-lai on the 30th expressed 
support for "the people of Kashmir in their struggle for 
the right to national self-determination." Chou in ef-
fect had declared the struggle for Kashmir a "national" 
liberation war--a reflection of Mao's apparent view that 
the Kashmiris should have developed a prrtracted guerrilla 
insurrection against the Indians.

Although the Chinese agreed to supply Ayub with 
large amounts of military aid, including aircraft and 
training, following the disastrous developments in Septem-
ber 1965, their suspicions increased. Ayub's statements 
to editors at his home on 27 October 1965 again confirmed 
to the Chinese (if his participation in the Tashkent dis-
cussions had not already confirmed to them) that he was 
not entirely in Peking's camp. 
I want you to remember that while we have 
good neighborly relations with China, the 
U.S. has been our friend and I intend that 
she remain so. Only the U.S. can help Pak-
istan, pressure India, and lead the UN to 
tackle Kashmir. 
 /Ayub's partial 
disillusionment with the U.S. and opposition to New Delhi 
continued to be the major Chinese consideration, and on 
2 December Chen Yi was permitted to pledge support for 
Pakistan against India. Chen's statement did not imply 
direct PLA involvement and he was careful to make a dis-
tinction between what would "inevitably" be the result 
of an attack on Pakistan--a vague formulation?and Chinese 
"support."* This was a retreat from the positions Peking 
had adopted in September 1965 and suggests that Mao prob-
ably will iht repeat his rash act of committing the PLA 
to help the Pakistanis in a new crisis. Ayub's discussion

the support of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism,

will inevitably meet with a still greater defeat. As

resolutely support Pakistan in her struggle against In-
dian aggression." (Interview with Dawn correspondent

with major enemies of Peking--for example, in Washington 
in December 1965 and in Tashkent in January 1966--impelled 
the Chinese to try to limit the extent of U.S. and Soviet 
influence on him. Liu Shao-chi and Chen Yi, in addition 
to trying to demonstrate that Peking still had a few 
important friends in the world, used their trip to east 
and west Pakistan to reaffirm Peking's desire to support 
him against New Delhi. Liu stressed Peking's military aid 
in tine of need and referred to a continuing policy "to 
stand on the side of" Pakistan to repel aggression and 
to "firmly support" Rawalpindi on the Kashmir issue. (Liu 
speech of 26 March 1966) Chinese Communist arms were 
paraded during the Liu-Chen visit; this indicated that 
some Pakistani leaders, including pro-Peking Bhutto, wanted 
to convince the populace that Peking, not Washington, 
was indeed Pakistan's true friend. Chen Yi on 29 March 
again declared "firm support" against any Indian aggres-
sion as the Chinese leaders tried to demonstrate the import-
ance of their assistance. Nevertheless, Ayub refused to 
comply with the apparent suggestions of Liu and Cheu to 
include attacks on the U.S. and to refer to Vietnam in the 
communique issued at the end of the visit. Chou's turn 
came on 29 June 1966, when he may have tried to convince 
Ayub   that Peking's good will 25X1 
would continue and would include large-scale military aid, 
MIG-19s, and tanks. 
The Pakistanis have been accorded special treat-
ment and have been exempted from the gaucherie resulting 
from Mao's "cultural revolution." In mid-August 1966, 
Chen Yi was permitted to placate the Pakistani ambassa-
dor about Red Guard abominations and the closing of the 
mosques tn Peking, and Mao probably tried to reassure 
Ayub of his personal favor for continuing a warm rela-
tionship by meeting with Foreign Minister Pirzada in late 
October 1966. In late March 1967, Chen Yi had to assure 
the Pakistanis that the purge had not changed Peking's 
overall foreign policy, but what he really meant was 
that it had not changed Peking's policy toward Karachi. 
Signs of deference to Ayub's diplomats included the use 
by the Chinese of the Pakistani commercial counsellor 
Malik in late July 1967 to tell David Oancia, the Canadian 
correspondent, that the Foreign Ministry warning to him

about his "behavior" was not really severe and that the 
Chinese could have beaten him more soundly. (Oancia and 
two other correspondents had only been punched, kicked, 
and beaten rith belt buckles by Red Guards.) In late 
September 1967 the Chinese diplomatic mission leaving 
Tunisia turned over Peking's interests there to the Pak-
istani embassy. 
The Chinese leaders continued to assure the Pak-
istanis of military aid and special deference in order 
to encourage them against the Indians. For example, a 
Pakistani official stated in Karachi in late April 1967 
that "recently" the Chinese had offered "safe" Chinese 
bases as staging areas if bases in West Pakistan were 
to be knocked out by an Indian armed forces attack. Al-
though the Chinese probably provided the Pakistanis with 
some kind of assurance that Chinese bases could be used 
for some kind of sanctuary, it is unlikely that, in the 
event of a disaster as conjectured, they would permit the 
Pakistanis to fly operational missions from mainland bases. 
Their effort was primarily intended to deter the Pakistani 
leaders from moving back into a closer relationship with 
the U.S. and from consulting the Soviets (if only to argue 
with them about Moscow's support for New Delhi). Their 
concern was to prevent a cooling off of relations, despite 
Sino-Pakistani frictions. In late May 1967, during the 
visit of PaListan's Foreign Affairs Secretary and Defense 
Minister, they declared that although the U.S. "and its 
followers" had tried to make Pakistan jettison its inde-
pendent foreign policy and join "imperialism, revisionism, 
and reaction..." against Peking, the Pakistanis "had re-
sisted this pressure." (Yeh Chien-ying speech of 26 May 
1967) They insisted that the Sino-Pakistani relation-
ship "is sincere and can weather tests; no force whatso-
ever can disrupt it." (Yeh Chien-ying speech of 29 May

of Moscow's unwillingness to drop its support of New

III. Non-Communist Enemies 
A. A New Enemy: India 
India had been a major friend, and after the estab-
lishment of diplomatic relations on 1 April 1950, Chou 
was given considerable leeway to try to keep it that way. 
He argued in the mid-1950s that two different roads to 
power--a euphemistic way of concealing the differences 
between the attainment of independence oy democratic men 
and the seizure of power by Communist totalitarians--could 
not prevent sustained good relations.* He also insisted 
that these relations were blessed with a personal man-to-
man friendship.** India's transformation in 1959 from a 
major friend to a major enemy was a development which Mao 
and Chou apparently accepted with considerable reluctance. 
Even after Sino-Indian recriminations had been exchanged 
following the Tibet revolt in March 1959, Peking professed 
*"The paths and methods through which China and India 
achieved their national independence were not entirely 
the same. The Chinese revolution was accomplished under 
the leadership of the CCP through long armed struggle. 
India took a different path. Some people attempt to use 
this dissimilarity to prove that friendship between China 
and India is devoid of a basis or that it will not last. 
But such an argument is untenable...." (Chou's speech to 
the Indian parliament of 29 November 1955) 
**"We, Prime Minister Nehru and I, have known each other 
for more than two years. We are old friends and there-
fore can talk on any questions." (Chou's statement at the 
New Delhi news conference on 1 December 1956) Chou had 
worked so well along this line that Nehru later found it 
difficult to accept him as an enemy--as hardboiled and 
not amenable to personal appeals or gentlemanly reason.

to see that Nehru still "in general advocates Sino-Indian 
friendship." (People's Daily, article of 5 May 1959) The 
Foreign Policy Review document published in January 1961 
laid it down that: 
During the first half of 1960, we pursued 
an all-out counterattack against the anti-
Chinese struggle in India. In the inter-
national context, however, our struggle 
against India should be subordinate to 
the struggle against imperialism. Our 
struggle against India should not go be-
yond this limit. 
This document's instruction to Chinese diplomats to view 
each national situation in the context of Peking's entire 
world strategy against the U.S. was attributed to Mao.* 
The document also attributed to Mao recognition of the 
importance of diplomatic flexibility.** Applied to India, 
these exhortations to be cautious meant that despite the 
need for recriminations ("struggle"), diplomatic relations 
must not be severed ("unity"): 
Our policy is: 'do not start it,' stick to 
the struggle,' leave some leeway,' insist 
on unity,' and 'oppose a split.' With India 
and other nationalist countries, we have had 
both struggle and unity. For instance, India 
started an anti-Chinese movement and this we 
opposed with determination. Then, after our 
opposition, the Premier went to New Delhi 
[in April 1960] to negotiate with Nehru. 
The two chiefs of state [sic] met. At the 
border, a clash was avoided. The relations 
between the two countries again temporarily 
*"Chairman Mao instructed us in the importance of taking 
cognizance of the whole...to be able to maneuver the parts." 
**"In 1960, Chairman Mao again instructed us repeatedly 
that in our struggles, some leeway must be provided."

calmed down. The struggle against India 
shows how we applied our principles and 
used the tactic of flexibility. 
For the year 1961, the document stated that "We will strive 
to have better relations with India and influence India 
into assuming a passive position on the border problem. 
This is important." Mao's dialectical policy of "strug-
gle and unity" toward India was cited in November 1960 
for indoctrination of border troops in the Tibet Military 
Region Command Headquarters, the main thrust of the policy 
being depicted as necessary even with "two-faced national 
states" because "to make a friend is to lose an enemy, 
and this is true in the international struggle." 
Because of India's importance, Chou in April 1960 
had been permitted to try to bring Nehru to negotiate 
the border dispute. Nehru found it domestically embar-
rassing to agree to negotiate, and as the Indians moved 
toward a policy of occupying positions near and even be-
hind Chinese positions (after the Chinese themselves in 
the western sector had moved into Indian territory earlier), 
the Sino-Indian border dispute escalated into a major clash. 
Shortly after their first punitive attack on Indian posi-
tions in October 1962, the Chinese published another ap-
preciation of Nehru, formalizing Mao's appraisal of htm 
as a man who has "put himself in the position of a lackey 
of the imperialists." (People's Daily article of 27 
October 1962) Although the real appraisal of the Chinese 
leaders apparently was that negotiations would continue 
to be rejected by New Delhi and that the border dispute 
would continue to be a basic source of tension, they pro-
fessed a willingness to reach an agreement. Their pro-
fessions were intended to make the Indian leaders appear 
to be the real recalcitrants. Chen Yi told a group of 
Japanese reporters that the border dispute is a "contra-
diction between China and a friendly neighboring country, 
and a peaceful settlement can be brought to this contra-
diction. We expect India's reconsideration." (Interview 
of 9 November 1962) At a later time, Mao himself in the 
fall of 1964 still professed a desire to settle the bor-
der dispute by negotiations "on the basis of" the December 
1962 Colombo proposals (rather than on acceptance of these

proposals as "preconditions"), "to wait more" for Indian 
concurrence with the idea of talks, and to keep the quar-
rel in secret channels--"In one of our notes, we told 
India that we were not ready to make our notes public." 
(Mao's interview with French delegation and Ambassador 
Paye on 11 September 1964) Despite Mao's effort to ap-
pear reasonable and, incidentally, to shift the entire 
blame for intransigence to the Indians, his policy to-
ward New Delhi was to discard more and more openly any 
desire to settle the border dispute by negotiations. 
Small-scale patrol clashes and an interminable ex-
change of insults in government notes have marked Mao's 
post 1964 policy, which completely discarded the "unity" 
half of his former strategy and became a plan to wage 
all-out open political warfare against the Indian leaders. 
This included active border patrolling and occasional 
probes onto Indian-claimed territory. Particularly in 
Sikkim (but not exclusively there.), the Chinese have tried 
to test Indian reactions to their claims. On 29 November 
1965, Ambassador Bowles was handed an aide-memoire by the 
Foreign Secretary which accused the Chinese of incursions 
across the border "since the middle of September" in the 
Sikkim area and in the western sector, where the PLA has 
"practically remilitarized the 20-kilometer demilitarized 
zone, thereby v:olating the provisions of the Colombo 
Proposals as well as China's own unilateral declaration." 
/ Mao's purge on the mainland ap-
parently was an additional reason for sustaining the poli-
tical warfare and occasional patrol probes on the border.*

New Delhi's complaint concerning creeping aggression on 
the border had stated that this process had started in 
mid-September 1965--that is, prior to Mao's purge--and 
that this process in effect indicated that Peking had "dis-
honored" its three commitments (1) not to cross the "line 
of actual control," (2) to maintain a 20-kilometer de-
militarized zone in the western sector, and (3) not to 
send troops to the "disputed' areas in the eastern sector.* 
Following a significant intensifiecation of politi-
cal tensions between Peking and New Delhi in the summer 
of 1967 in the wake of Chinese support for Indian Commun-
ist insurrectionists and Red Guard beatings of Indian dip-
lomats, the practice of making shallow incursions was  
resumed in August

that Peking had the "sovereign right" to choose modes of 
addressing notes and that it had done so in keeping with 
the "cultural revolution."

 I By mid-October 1967, both the Chinese and 
Indians entered a new period of restraint, the former be-
cause Chou apparently informed Mao of the new charges 
of Chinese aggression being discussed throughout the world 
and the latter because of genuine concern over the pros-
pect of having to fight a new border war with the PLA which 
had whipped Indian troops decisively in 1962. 
Beyond the border skirmishes, Sino-Indian relations 
became intensely antagonistic on the matter of Chinese in-
terference in Indian domestic affairs (i.e., open support 
for Indian Communists against New Delhi) and on the matter 
of beating Indian diplomats in Peking. Both sides were 
to stop short of a complete break in diplomatic relations, 
but the idea of peaceful coexistence between them was dis-
carded as an anachronism. 
Regarding more and more open support for opponents 
of the government, the Chinese leaders' response to mass 
arrests of Indian Communists (started on 30 December 1964) 
was to encourage pro-Peking Communists to struggle for 
political supremacy, along a long road, without specifying 
tactics to be used. "History will prove that the genuine 
representatives of the interests of the Indian people and 
nation are those Indian Communists who uphold truth and 
justice and adhere to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian 
internationalism. The future of India certainly belongs 
to them, to the people of India." (People's Daily article 
of 17 January 1965) They had not at that time (1965) in-
dicated which group of Indian Commurists they would sup-
port, and as late as 24 March 1967, People's Daily was 
vague in suggesting that "revolutioe-iii-iEe only road 
for India. However, when Mao's purge began to influence 
the relatively rational and moderate aspects of Peking's 
foreign policy (spring and summer of 1967), the Chinese 
began gradually to make clear that they would reject even 
former pro-Peking Communists and would support only those 
Indian Communists who agreed totally, rather than parti-
ally, with Mao's road of armed struggle. Peking's line 
moved from indirect criticism to an open attack on Com-
munists taking the "parliamentary road" in the state

governments of Kerala and West Bengal; at the same time, 
Peking encouraged only the extremist elements of the CPI/L 
because they were adhering to Mao's theories of armed 
struggle, establishing a rural base area in the Darjeeling 
district of West Bengal. 
The Chinese leaders, at first, became less reticent 
about openly discussing the competing factions in the In-
dian Communist movement and then moved on to target indi-
viduals whom they would not support (because they would 
not accept the armed-struggle aspect of the Chinese revo-
lutionary model). Following an attack on Dange's speech 
of 24 April 1967, an NCNA report on 7 May 1967 went on to 
criticize a former pro-Peking group--"another small hand-
ful of revisionists" who agreed with Dange--for trying 
to use the February 1967 voting results, which put Com-
munists into the Kerala and West Bengal state governments, 
to sabotage the revolution in India, They were depicted 
as being like-minded revisionists for accepting Dange's 
appeal for viewing united front governments throughout 
India as the way (on the Kerala model) to oust the ruling 
Congress party. The report depicted the two state govern-
ments as still being "component parts" of India's big 
bourgeoisie, and it insisted that the entire old state 
apparatus must be smashed by violent means, The new line 
attacking Communists in the two state governments was 
sustained in subsequent articles, and tactics were more 
openly recommended. On 19 May, a People's Daily Commenta-
tor article declared "rebellion" by violence to be "the 
only way out" for the Indian people and praised the "armed 
struggle" of the Nagas and Mizos.* A Red Guard writer 
*The Chinese leaders had begun to encourage the Naga 
tribes even prior to the publication of the Commentator 
article, having insisted that the Nagas must "struggle" 
against the "reactionary" Indian government (Peking broad-
cast of 11 April 1967) and having claimed more generally 
that "Sparks of revolt are growing in different parts of 
India." (NCNA dispatch of 19 April 1967) New Delhi's 
claims that the Chinese, since early 1967, have been train-
ing and equipping small groups of Naga guerrillas, have  
been confirmed by several reports./

stated in his article in People's Daily on 2 June 1967 
that "the only way" is "rebellion" and "use of the gun 
to overthrow the reactionary ruling classes." The "re-
visionists" who had been depicted as being no better 
than Dange had not yet been named. 
The Chinese leaders significantly increased their 
publicity on both the peasant insurgency (which they 
praised) and the "non-Congress government" (which they 
attacked) in West Bengal on 27 June 1967, shortly after 
starting the Sino-Indian dispute over the expulsion of 
two Indian diplomats. They moved to make somewhat clearer 
the line of demarcation between Indian Communists who 
take the "parliamentary road" and those who would take 
Mao's road of peasant insurrection. An NCNA report on 
27 June 1967, praised the peasant insurgents in the 
Darjeeling district of West Bengal centered on Naxalbari 
as "the revolutionaries of the Indian Communist Party" 
who in 1965 prepared for armed struggle and in March 1967 
set up a "red district" there. The NCNA report insisted 
that Indians must proceed along "Mao's road" to over-
throw the government. An NCNA report on 29 June complained 
that the "reactionary central government of India" was 
preparing to crush the revolt. Indian authorities were 
aided by this outside encouragement of the rebels to 
argue more forcefully for the need to take strong action 
against them.* They also protested to the Chinese through 
their embassy in New Delhi on 5 July 1967, complaining 
that the two NCNA reports of late June, which had been 
broadcast by Peking Radio, were aimed at "instigating 
armed struggle" and at the "territorial dismemberment of 
India."

*Early in the morning of 12 July 1967, a strong police 
force moved into one of the "strongholds" of the rebels 
in the village of Naxalbari, arrested 70 persons, and 
seized huge quantities of "bows, arrows, and spears," ac-
cording to a Delhi domestic service broadcast of the 12th.

At the same time, the Chinese were moving further 
to make an open declaration of a policy they had discarded 
in 1952, namely, the policy of imposing the Chinese model 
"Mao's road"--on other revolutionary movements. 
The definitive statement on this policy for Indians was 
made in the People's Daily editorial of 5 July 1967: 
The Indian revolution must take the road of 
relying on the peasants, establishing base 
areas in the countryside, persisting in pro-
tracted armed struggle, and using the country-
side to encircle and finally capture the 
cities. This is Mao Tse-tung's  road, the 
road that has led the Chinese revolution to 
victory, and the only road to victory for 
revolution of all oppressed nations and people. 
(emphasis supplied) 
Mao has returned to the policy of 1948-1952 when he and 
his lieutenants, primarily Liu Shao-chi, touted his in-
surrectionist road to power.* But the current formulation 
is more inclusive than the earlier one, inasmuch as it in-
sists that this road applies not only to Asian but to "all" 
countries.** He is also insisting that insurrectionists 
*Peking adulates peasant uprisings more than any other 
kind, primarily because they can be construed as being 
roughly similar to Mao's road, as witness the publicity 
given to the peasant revolt "from 1946-51" in Telengana, 
Andhra State, in the Peking Review article of 11 August 1967. 
**The earlier formulation stated that "just as the Chi-
nese people have done, all or at least some of the colonial 
people of the East can hold big or small base arc:as and 
maintain revolutionary regimes for an extended period, 
carry on protracted revolutionary war to encircle the cities 
from the countryside, and proceed gradually to take over 
the cities and win nationwide victory in their respective 
countries." (emphasis supplied; (Footnote in the 1951 
version of Mao's essay, Why Can China's Red Political  
Power Continue to Exist? of October 1928)

must use his military strategy or, as the 5 July editorial 
puts it for India, "the flexible strategy and tactics of 
people's war personally worked out by Chairman Mao." 
Peking's support apparently had encouraged the 
Naxalbari rebels to reject CPI/L discipline and to create 
problems for pro-Chinese leaders in the militant part of  
the Indian Communist party.  
 / By 3 
August, a People's Daily article discussed the CPI left 
and right groups in historical perspective, attacking both 
Namboodiripad and Dange by name, and on 10 August, an arti-

taking the "parliamentary road," i.e., for taking posts 
in the state government. (Namboodiripad, as chief minister 
in the Kerala united front government was, in Mao's ap-

within a "bourgeois democratic government" rather than 
fighting openly against it along "Mao's road" of armed 
struggle.)* To sum up, spurred on by the intensified Sino-

Indian diplomat dispute in late June 1967, Mao and his 
aides decided to go beyond attacks on the CPI/R and Dange 
(for several years dismissed by Peking as an unregenerate 
"revisionist") to open criticism and dissection of members 
of the CPI/L, coming to rest finally on extremist elements 
of the CPI/L because they advocate "seizure of power by 
armed struggle" and are "taking the road of the Chinese 
people." (NCNA report of 2 August 1967) The Chinese 
leaders seemed thereafter to be edging toward approval 
of the formation of a distinctly Maoist, third Indian Com-
munist Party, using those men who had been expelled from 
the CPI/L and who, in mid-November 1967, reportedly de-
cided to form a new party to attain "a people's democratic 
revolution through building militant rural bases and ex-
tending them to encircle the cities" (Bombay PIT broad-
cast of 17 November 1967)* In the course of expressing 
malicious satisfaction over the fall of the West Bengal 
united front government, a People's Daily Observer article 
of 5 December 1967 stated that the extremists have found 
the correct road, which requires a "political party of 
the proletariat" to lead the peasant insurrection. 
Regarding the details of the Sino-lndian diplomatic 
dispute, it developed in mid-1967 at a time when Mao was 
permitting (if not encouraging) fanatics in the Foreign 
Ministry to defy the established international practice 
of diplomatic immunity. When, following warnings to foreign 
diplomats in Peking in late May 1967 against reading and 
taking notes from wall newspapers or from buying Red Guard 
newspapers, the second secretary of the Indian embassy 
(who had continued this practice) was seized by Red Guards 
(on 4 June), the stage was set to make the Indian offi-
cial a "negative example." He was released after the film 
*Peking, in quoting Indian journals which attacked Indian 
"revisionists." included the statement that the revision-
ist leadership should either be jettisoned or the extrem-

come together into a really revolutionary party." (NCNA

he took indicated that he had only photographed a temple 
and not a nearby military barracks. On the following 
day (5 June), his summons to the Foreign Ministry was 
cancelled without explanation.1 
The rational half of this plan was to warn foreign-
ers, including diplomats, against reporting on develop-
ments related to Mao's purge. The irrational half was to 
demonstrate a new, "revolutionary" style in handling diplo-
mats of enemy countries. The second secretary did not 
appear at his mass trial on 13 June, but he was found 
"guilty' of various charges and marked for deportation 
without diplomatic immunity. He and his colleague were 
beaten for 50 minutes by Red Guards at the Peking airport 
on 14 June, and they were later exposed to the poles, 
fists, and belt-buckles of other Red Guards at each stop 
en route from Peking to Hong Kong, the last stop, Canton, 
having been the most damaging to their persons. Report-
ing on the irrational half of the plan, the second secre-
tary described these beatings as "cruel and sadistic" 
(interview of 19 June 1967),* but it is likely that Mao 
was kept informed of the beatings and appraised them as 
very good.

to bow-the-head in Hangchow, and hit with "stones, spit,

not killed or dismembered.

the seige of the Indian embassy in Peking on the 17th 
further strained relations. Sporadic demonstrations 
against the Indian embassy occurred, but by 1 October 
following the border clash, they were limited in scope. 
The prospect seems to be for sporadic small-scale 
patrol clashes at various points on the border, for govern-
ment-to-government political abuse, and for sustained 
Chinese support for Naga guerrillas and the new extremists 
of the Indian Communist movement. They will insist on 
complete support from any Indian Communist who is willing 
to be pro-Peking. By their action in firefights during 
September 1967 on the Sikkim-Tibet border, the Chinese 
have discarded the earlier policy contained in the pledge 
they had made to "first of all inform all the Colombo 
conference countries" before taking military action 
against Indian forces. (People's Daily article of 13 
October 1963) 
B. Old Enemies 
1. Thailand 
Chou En-lai had invited Thailand's representatives 
at the Bandung conference in April 1955 to visit Peking, 
and in this way he initiated the effort to move Bangkok 
to loosen its ties with SEATO and Washington. (Chou's 
invitation is referred to in his foreign policy report 
of 30 July 1955) At the same conference, Chen Yi worked 
with him and tried to mollify Foreign Minister Prince 
Wan (Chen interview of 28 July 1958) As a result, some 
Thais visited Peking and some trade developed, until 
itwas restricted by Thai-imposed import controls in 
early 1959. Chou and Chen attained very little in all 
their efforts, the main difficulty for them having been 
the fact that Bangkok, with no experience of Western 
colonial domination to make its leaders anti-Western in 
attitude, preferred a strong assertive alignment with the 
U.S. and an assertive opposition to Communism in South-
east Asia. They openly rejected a policy of accommoda-
tion with Peking and Hanoi.

Failure to move the Thais away from their close 
relationship with the U.S. and toward a neutral foreign 
policy position and the increased presence of the U.S. 
in Thailand impelled the Chinese leaders to drop their 
restraint and to begin to denounce Bangkok for its atti-
tude of supporting anti-Communist efforts in the area. 
In mid-1962, Chen Yi referred to the authorities in Bang-
kok as "reactionary," and stated that the country was a 
"bridgehead for invading Laos" (speech of 12 July 1962). 
Regarding the war in Vietnam, they viewed Thai support 
of the South Vietnamese and American effort as sufficiently 
important to require warnings to Bangkok to cease this 
support or accept the consequences, namely, a subversive 
movement of insurgents in the Thai countryside. At some 
time between the central committee work conference of 
June 1964 and the U.S. airstrikes against North Vietnam 
in August 1964, the Chinese leaders apparently decided tt. 
create trouble for Bangkok by organizing all anti-govern-
ment Thais, including prominent non-Communists, into a 
united front of political and military opponents. This 
action probably reflected a decision to discard the 1954-
1964 policy of non-support, or low-key support, for Bang-
kok's internal enemies.  
Nevertheless, the Chinese continued on their course; 
on 13 December 1984, NCNA rebroadcast a manifesto issued

by the Independence Movement of Thailand (said to have 
been founded on 1 November and originally reported in the 
clandestine radio broadcast of the Voice of the People 
of Thailand on 8 December), declaring as policy the ex-
pulsion of U.S. personnel from Thailand and the "over-
throw" of the Thanom government. The manifesto stated 
that the Independence group was willing "to cooperate" 
with "any" individuals or organization who were "patriotic" 
--i.e., anti-government--and in this usage it was similar 
to the greetings sent to the PRC on 1 October by the Com-
munist Party of Thailand (CPT). U.S. officials in Hong 
Kong noted this similarity and also commented that Thai 
was among the first three foreign languages to be studied 
in Peking's new (established on 5 September 1964) Foreign 
Language Institute. By January 1965, the Thai Patriotic 
Front was launched as the second anti-government organi-
zation which was "willing to cooperate with all compatriots. 
who love peace and democracy." (Voice of the People of 
Thailand broadcast of 23 January 1965 reporting the forma-
tion of the Front on 1 January) Both organizations were 
given wide and unprecedented coverage by Peking and Hanoi 
media, suggesting the primary role of these Communist 
capitols in organizing and supporting the subversives. 
Activation of the Thai insurgent and subversive 
movement was one of the ways the Chinese had decided to 
react to increased U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Chen Yi 
had stated  in January 1965 that 25X1 
guerrilla warfare might "spread" to Thailand in 1965, and 
Chen apparently was making a statement of intent. Prime 
Minister Thanom declared on 19 January that the Chinese 
had already sent agents into Thailand and were financing 
them partly through funds made available in Thai currency 
in Hong Kong banks. By March 1965, Communist insurgent 
activity in northeastern Thailand was reported to be well 
organized and in the same month, Communist-led Independent 
Movement personnel were circulatin ro a anda tracts in 
Ban kok.

  By mid-
1965, Communist-led insurgents and "patriotic" figures 
in Thailand were working actively along the lines of Mao's 
prescription for a revolutionary seizure of power, namely 
the building of an army in isolated territorial base 
areas and the organization of Communists and non-Commun-
ists in a broad uni.ted front in order to wage a protracted 
military and political war against the central government.*

warnings to Thailand that closer Thai-U.S. military coopera-
tion would lead to an intensification of the "patriotic 
struggle" in Thailand. (people's Daily article of 7 October 
1965 published one day after Mao met with Pridi)  
Liao Cheng-chih, who appeared with Mao during the 
Pridi interview, continued to shepherd Thai front lead-
ers in Peking, meeting with them on 1 November 1965 on the 
first anniversary of the founding of the Independence Move-
ment and probably implementing a new policy of higher level 
Chinese leaders to make the fronts a more compact fight-
ing unit by uniting them.* On 1 November 1965, the In-
dependence Movement announced that it had joined the 
United Patriotic Front. The first Communist insurgent 
attack against a government installation, indicating a 
switch to more aggressive tactics, was conducted by a 
12-man raiding group on 21 December 1965. Liao tied 
the subversive Thai political effort (he remained silent 
on insurgent activities) to peace "in Indochina" and the 
world and appealed for "bigger contributions" from various 
political groups "in 1966." (Liao speech of 2 January

means of people's war." This article also was unprece-
dented in official platy and government publications be-
cause it had dropped the equivocal euphemism, "Thai 
authorities," and had disparaged the Thanom government 
specifically and in highly derogatory terms. Peking in-
creased its public support. On 24 March 1966, Peking 
Radio rebroaaiT-a Voice of the People of Thailand 
report that the Thailand Patriotic Youth Organization 
was established on 15 February 1966; on 13 April, Liao 
referred publicly to the Thai "people's war" and the 
readiness of the Chinese people to help "at any moment;" 
and on 27 April, a People's Daily article praised the 
battles fought by "the patriBTTE?people's armed forces 
of Thailand."* 
The Chinese leaders were careful to indicate that 
increased Thai involvement in the Vietnam war would be 
handled by others, by a riposte to be delivered by Thai 
insurgents Inc-1-W the Vietnamese Communists and the Pathet 
Lao. For example, following the 6 January 1967 announce-
ment in Bangkok that 100 Thai troops would be sent to 
Vietnam, Peking (following Hanoi by an interval of five 
days) warned that "the peoples of Vietnam and other Indo-
chinese states will certainly deal you resolute counter-
blows and the Thai people, too, will certainly rebel against 
you extensively and in enhanced unity." (PRC Foreign Min-
istry statement of 19 January 1967) Peking's reaction 
to the announcement that B-52s would use Thai bases was

the PLA to any action, while hinting that the North Viet-
namese and the Pathet Lao might retaliate, was a reflec-
tion of caution and a source of embarrassment. But in 
subsequent comment, they still avoided saying what Peking 
would do in response to the enlargement of U.S. military 
bases in Thailand, committing the Vietnamese to "hit still 
harder." (People's Daily editorial of 2 April 1967) 
The prospect appears to be for greater Chinese en-
couragement of the Thai insurgents and Thai front groups. 
This almost certainly will include military training and 
covert financing. 
2. Malaysia 
Malay's leaders in the 1950s had refused to reco-
gnize Peking while Communist insurgent activity continued 
in the countryside. Prime Minister Rahman had stated this 
position on 23 August 1957, eight days prior to Malayan 
independence, and this was repeated by his successor on 
11 May 1959. Before they had granted the Malayans in-
dependence, the British refused to accept any Peking re-
presentatives in the country, as the CCP's guidance of 
the Communist Party of Malaya made Chinese Communist of-
ficials a direct security threat. However, the Malayans 
viewed the early establishment of trade relations as a 
secure form of contact with Peking, and by 1964, the Chi-
nese had exported $95 million to Malaya and had imported 
$210,000 in commodities. As noted earlier in the section 
of this paper discussing Indonesia, the Chinese Communist 
leaders were cautious after the establishment of Malaysia  
as an extended country on 16 September 1963, at first 
avoiding any direct commitment to support Sukarno's "con-
frontation" policy in the hope that a relatively non-
antagonistic attitude would sustain their trade relations 
with Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia's friends, the British. 
However, the Chinese leaders significantly increased 
their support of Sukarno in the fall of 1964 when the In-
donesian leader became more assertively anti-U, S. and after 
the U.S. airstrikes of August 1964 on North Vietnam. On 
15 April 1965, the CCP sent a message greeting the Commun-
ist Party of Malaya (CPM) on its 35th anniversary (released

by NCNA on 30 April 1965). The message made it clear that 
the Chinese leaders were intensifying their support of 
the small insurgent group operating from almost inacces-
sible bases in southern Thailand against Malaysian author-
ities.* Following the arrest of some leaders of the CPM 
front organization--the Malayan National Liberation League 
(MNLL)--in Indonesia after the unsuccessful coup of 1 
October 1965, the Chinese dusted off one of their own 
Malayan puppets in Peking and on 12 January 1966, pub-
licized the establishment of a mission "in China" of the 
MNLL with P. V. Sarma as its chief. Sarma joined other 
puppets (i.e., the Thai front leaders and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization mission members as well as secre-
taries of the formerly Djakarta-based Afro-Asian Journal-
ists Association and the Indonesian AAPSO group), and on 
12 January, he declared, in the presence of Liao Cheng-
chih, that his organization was the united front group 
of the Malayan people's movement fighting to u;'ush Malaysia 
and that they recognized that "people's revolvtionary 
war is the only answer to counter-revolutionary war." 
A Chinese Communist spokesman pledged Peking's "all-out 
support" for the Malayans fighting against the government 
authorities and stated that the "National Liberation Army 
of Malaya" was making progress against the "British colon-
ialists and their running dogs." 
The Chinese leaders were declaring in effect that 
their response to increased U.S. and Thai involvement in 
the Vietnam war would be reactivation of Communist insurgent 
movements in anti-Communist countries in Southeast Asia. 
They tied the small Malayan insurgency to Vietnam, using 
their Malayan puppet to warn that "the Malayan people would 
intensify their anti-Malaysia campaign to coalesce with 
the anti-imperialist struggle in Vietnam and Southeast 
*The message recounted the two "armed struggles" led 
by the CPM, first against the Japanese and second against 
"British imperialism and its running dog, the Rahman clique," 
and indicated that the second struggle was continuing. 
It concluded with a pledge of support and a declaration 
that both parties would "fight shoulder to shoulder."

(emphasis supplied)  
Study of Mao's doctrines almost certainly increased 
as Mao's purge expanded on the mainland, and by 1 February 
1967 Sarma was impelled to praise the Red Guards and to 
insist that the "Malayan people...were adhering to Chair-
man Mao's teaching by relying on armed struggle." (In 
response, a "representative of the revolutionary rebels" 
in Peking expressed the support of mainland Chinese for 
Malayans who are "completely sweeping away all the freaks 
and monsters who are lording it over the people of Malaysia." 
Liao Cheng-chih declared that the people of China and 
Malaya would always "fight together.") Sarma claimed 
that in the year 1966 
the Malayan National Liberation Army and 
people, led by the Communist Party, were in-
creasingly active in central and northern 
Malaya, and especially in the latter region 
bordering Thailand.

3. Singapore 
Singapore's secession from Malaysia on 9 August 
1965 provided the Chinese leaders with (1) an opponent 
of Rahman'- whose anti-Malayan position could be used 
to disparage Kuala Lumpur and (2) a poss'ble friend who 
would at least agree to trade with Peking. They report-
ed favorably on Lee Kuan Yew's press conferences of 9 and 
10 August 1965 and quote* him as saying that "we want to 
trade with the world, including the PRC." (NCNA dispatch 
of 10 August 1965) However, the desire of the Chinese 
leaders to recognize Singapore and establish their influ-
ence there, using assets among Singapore Chinese, was sub-
ordinated to the more important consideration of comply-
ing with Indonesian demands  that they avoid taking such  
an anti-Djakarta action./

distinct'on between Rahman and Lee, and is using them as 
an undifferentiated target. Following the Soviet action 
in signing a trade agreement with Kuala Lumpur and agree-
ing to exchange diplomatic missions (announced on 3 April 
1967), the Chinese leaders used their Malayan puppets to 
attack the joint target.* According to a Chinese offi-
cial's statement in Canton in late May 1967, Peking will 
depict the situation as requiring the "liberation" of 
Malaysia and Singapore by the CPM. 
4. The Philippines 
Despite the Philippines' participation in SEATO 
and recognition of Taipei, Filipino leaders were encouraged 
by Chou En-lai and Chen Yi at the Bandung conference in 
April 1955 and thereafter to establish relations with 
Peking.** The Chinese leaders hoped to detach the Filipinos 
*"All genuine Malayan patriots must therefore step up 
their struggle against modern revisionism with the lead-
ing group of the CPSU at its center, at the same time as 
stepping up their struggle against U.S.-backed British im-

in order to crush 'Malaysia' and the new-type colony of 
Singapore, and achieve the genuine independence of a uni-
fied Malaya." (Statement of the Central Committee of the 
MNLL carried by NCNA on 14 May 1967) (emphasis supplied) 
**"At the Bandung conference, we said to Mr. Romulo that 
there is no hatred between China and the Philippines, and 
that if the Philippines go by the spirit of the Bandung 
conference and the five principles of peaceful coexist-
ence, friendly relations of mutual assistance can be es-
tablished." (Chen Vi interview with Manila Vice Mayor 
and newsmen on 28 July 1958) "Since the Bandung confer-
ence, we have been constantly thinking about how to pro-
mote and develop relations between our two countries."

from their close alignment with the U.S., calculating that 
a gradual process of non-official contacts would erode 
Manila's commitment. In a revealing statement on this 
matter, M109_0_1964 indicated that the strategy of estab-
lishing contacts gradually was similar to Peking's view 
of contacts with Japan: 
I ...the Philippines is a member of SEATO.,. 
but changes, indeed great changes have taken 
' place in the situation and nature of the 
aligned countries...The relations between 
China and the Philippines can-and-shodld 
be improved... 
...the Philippines is maintaining diplomatic 
relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique An 
Taiwan. But we think that this, too, will 
not stand in the way of the establishment 
and development of relations between our 
two countries. [Japan also maintains rela-
tions with Taipei] but that has not prevented 
Japan from establishing and developing gen-
eral contacts with China,, ..friendly contacts 
on a popular level are becoming ever more 
frequent [although] U.S. troops are still 
being stationed in Japan, and a part of 
Japanese territory is still being occupied 
by the U.S. All this shows that the situa-
tion is complicated, but it does not  mean 
that nothing can be done about it. Such 
being the case with Japan, why should not 
the same apply to the Philippines? (Chou 
En-lai interview with Filipino newsmen on 
27 October 1964) (emphasis supplied) 
This expressed Chou's willingness to look for small open-
ings to establish contacts with U.S.-aligned countries 
rather than declare the task hopeless and adopt a revolu-
tionary attitude of complete and overt hostility, avoid-
ing all contacts with these countries, The latter attitude 
was clearly more revolutionary, but as late as the fall 
of 1965, Chou was still advancing a flexible policy, and 
probably had Mac's sanction for doing so.

He apparently also felt that he had Mao's concur-
rence to continue the poliLy of publicly dissociating 
Peking from support of Communist insurgents in the islands. 
Chou insisted that Peking would not use popular diplomacy 
as a means to gain access to Filipino Communists, and he 
referred to the "principle" involved: 
Revolution cannot be exported. We have con-
sistently persisted in this principle. 
Revolution can only be conducted by the 
people of the country concerned. (Chou in-
terview with Filipino newsmen on 27 October 
1964) 
At the time Chou was declaring this as a "principle" rela-
tive to Peking's attitude toward internal developments 
in the Filipino insurgent movement, the Chinese leaders 
had advanced a considerable distance in discarding it in 
Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America and were depict-
ing the CCP as the "leader" of insurgent Communists and 
Peking as the "center" of world revolution. Chou's moderate 
line with the Filipinos in October 1964 reflected the de-
sire of the Chinese leaders to enlist Manila in their camp 
against the Soviets on the issue of Moscow's participation 
in the second Bandung conference (Chou referred to the 
"very good contact" Chen Yi had had with Romulo at the 
preparatory meeting for the conference "not long ago"). 
It also reflected their decision to try to deter the 
Filipino leaders from direct involvement in the Vietnam 
war following the U.S. airstrikes against North Vietnam 
in August and September 1964. 
The Chinese leaders did not abandon their policy 
of trying to enlist the support of Filipino political 
figures to promote the policy of establishing contacts

 Peking began to revolutionize 
its policy toward Manila, a key element in the decision 
apparently having been the desire to warn government lead-
ers to avoid direct support of the U.S. effort in Vietnam. 
In mid-February 1966, Peking Radio's Philippine section 
sharply increased its Filipino program broadcasts to the 
islands, attacking President Marcos' Vietnam aid bill. 
During the mid-March 1966 visit to the mainland of Senator 
Katigbak, a Chinese spokesman pledged "support for the 
Philippine people in their just struggle against U.S. ef-
forts to induce or force the Philippines to send troops 
to South Vietnam." (NCNA report of 14 March 1966)

creasing its support for Saigon and Washington. By late 
1966, Peking began to depict, with considerable exaggera-
tion, the Philippines as an area of increasing "armed 
struggles," expanding its list beyond Thaiiand, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Laos, and South Vietnam. In thc spring of 1967, 
the Chinese leaders went beyond this to suggest that their 
opposition to Manila's policy would take an organizational 
form, i.e., support for some guerrilla fighters in the 
islands. In early May 1967, two representatives of the 
militant front--Movement for the Advancement of National-
ism--were in Peking, apparently consulting on the method 
of announcing what was claimed to be the PKP's new action 
program. On 21 May, NCNA claimed that the PKP had set 
forth its program on 1 May in which the party pledged it-
self to the "development of rural bases and armed strug-
gles," to a "life-and-death struggle" against the U.S. 
and its "local reactionary allies"--i.e, the central 
government--and to anti-CPSU positions in the Sino-Soviet 
dispute. On 29 May, NCNA claimed that the "Philippines 
People's Liberation Army" was in existence and tried to 
create the impression that it was "led by" the PKP. On 
30 May, a People's Daily article stated that this army 
had started new battles against the U.S. and "the Philip-
pine reactionaries? and that "the Philippine revolution-
ary people" will win final victory 
...after protracted arduous struggles if, 
armed with Mao Tse-tung's thought, they 
fight a people's war, establish revolu-
tionary base areas, and encircle the 
cities from the countryside. 
By the end of May 1967, the Chinese leaders had dropped 
the line Chou had been expressing in 1964 on non-support 
of insurgents in the Philippines, applied Mao's road to 
the islands in the most explicit language they had used 
since 1952, and in effect declared open support for sub-
versive guerrilla action against Manila by publishing the 
"PKI's" 1 May 1967 program. The degree of control which 
Pekiag-oriented members of the PKP maintain over the Huks

to impose control by "reorganizing the party in the en-

The prospect seems to be for continued overt declara-
tions of support for the insurgents allegedly "led by the

IV. Imperialist Colonies: Macao and Hong Kong 
Although Mao at an earlier time had complained 
about foreign control of Macao and Hong Kong, he had been 
unwilling to fight to seize the colonies with the PLA or 
to begin a political-subversive struggle to impose local 
Communist control on their governments.* Practical rea-
sons--namely, the prospect of losing Hong Kong's foreign 
earnings (economic) and of losing a major war with the 
UK and the U.S. (military)--have deterred him from moving 
against the British colony with the PLA, despite his view 
of himself as the leader of all world "liberation" strug-
gles.** Regarding Macao, it has not been worth much to 
*In the original version of his essay, The Chinese  
Revolution and the CCP (December 1939), Mao had complain/A 
that: -Tin defeating r: .a in war, the imperailistic 
powers had taken away many Chinese dependent states and 
a part of her territories. japan took Korea, Taiwan, the 
Ryukyu Islands, the Pescadores Islands, and Port Arthur; 
England seized Burma, Bhutan, Nepal, and Hong Kong; France 
occupied Annam; and even an insignificant country like 
Portugal took Macao." 
The 1951 version of this essay removed two embarras-
sments: the implication that China had been, and could 
again become, an imperialistic country dictating to "de-
pendent states;" the reference to Portugal as an "insigni-
ficant" country able to maintain a colony on the mainland. 
However, he retained his complaint about Hong Kong: 
"After defeating China in war, they not only occupied many 
neighboring countries formerly under her protection, but 
seized or 'leased' part of her territories. For instance, 
Japan occupied Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and 'leased' 
the port of Lushun, Britain seized Hong Kong, and France 
'leased' Kwangchowwan." 
**Hong Kong has been Peking's largest source of foreign 
exchange earnings, which totaled more than $550 million 
in 1966.

Peking economically and, if Mao had decided to use the 
PLA to seize it, the colony would have been an insigni-
ficant risk militarily; but a move against Macao alone 
would have glaringly revealed Mao's unwillingness to seize 
Hong Kong. The preferred course was to avoid extensive 
Publicity and to tolerate the status quo in both. 
The Chinese leaders were impelled to depict their 
acquisecence in this foreign presence on the mainland as 
a matter of Peking's tacit approval rather than of any 
fear of war or of loss of economic benefits. They portrayed 
the Hong Kong and Macao situations as minor matters low 
on theiv list of foreign policy problems. However, two 
developments moved the colonies higher on the list--viz., 
Khrushchev's public jibes in 1962 and the revolutionary 
fanaticism of Mao's purge in 1966-67. 
Khrushchev gave the colonies unprecedented inter-
national publicity in his speech of 12 December 1962 to 
the Supreme Soviet, and in defending himself against 
Peking's charge that he had appeased the U.S. in retreat-
ing during the Cuban missile crisis, he sarcastically 
praised the Chinese leaders for appeasing Lisbon and Lon-
don by avoiding "premature" actions for "good reasons."* 
Mao and his advisers apparently were uncertain on how to 
proceed to answer this jibe and apparently continued to 
believe that, if agitation were started, the British would 
*Implying that in taking Goa, even New Delhi was more 
revolutionary than Peking, Khrushchev sarcastically stated: 
"But does anyone accuse China because remnants of colonial-
ism remain untouched on her territory? It would be incor-
rect to prod China into taking actions that she regards 
as premature. If the government of the PRC endures Macao 
and Hong Kong, then there must obviously be good reasons 
for this. Therefore, it would be stupid to heap accusa-
tions on their heads that this supposedly represents con-
cessions to the British and Portuguese colonialists, that 
it is an act of appeasement on their part." (Speech of 
12 December 1962)

not hand them a political victory without a prolonged 
struggle in Hong Kong and that a victory in Macao alone 
would not detract from, and might even underscore, con-
tinuing British control of Hong Kong. They apparently 
decided to sustain the policy of avoiding a political 
struggle or a military seizure, absorb as well as they 
could the derisive implication that Mao--a revolutionary 
"liberator"--was deterred by practical reasons from act-
ing like one regarding the colonies, and continue to de-
pict the Portuguese and British presence as a matter of 
Peking's benevolent tolerance. 
To demonstrate that Hong Kong was continuing in 
its colonial status only because Peking preferr not to 
change it, the Chinese leaders harassed Hong K. govern-
ment authorities in a low-key and controlled way. In Jan-
uary 1963, they impelled the authorities to postpone a 
planned urban renewal project in the Kowloon walled city 
(actually located outside of Kowloon).* At the same time, 
they annoyed them with complaints about Chinese National-
ist operations in the colony, but publicly justified their 
unwillingness to take any forceful action to seize either

since March 1961, the Chinese leaders had not protested 
until demolition was about to start and, more importantly, 
until after Khrushchev's December 1962 taunt. On 17 Janu-
ary 1963, they were impelled to follow up an unpublicized 
and informal protest (of 1 January) with a publicized and 
formal protest to the Brtiish charge in Peking, reacting 
partly to the jibe appearing in the CPUSA organ Daily  
Worker on 13 January regarding their timidity in endur-

handled by the Chinese leaders; it was not made a major 
issue and it was not extensively publicized. More import-
antly, they had chosen an area in the colony?the Kowloon 
walled city--where there was the appearance (but only the 
appearance) of a legally valid claim and where they would 
not have to confront the British with an issue regarding 
thek.. jurisdiction over the entire colony.** In this way 
they maintained the policy of avoiding a direct confronta-
tion over British control. 
This policy seems to have been sanctioned by Mao 
himself. On 11 September 1964, Mao told Ambassador Paye 
and a French delegation that he had, at an earlier time, 
discussed the colonies with Khrushchev and that Khrushchev 
had asked him a question. 
Why, he said, does China not want to get 
back Hong Kong and Macao? I answered: We 
have more important problems than Hong Kong 
and Macao. 
This exchange, as reported by Mao, was put in the context 
of a discussion which took place before Chou's trip to 
*The justification appeared in a published response 
to the American Communists and it contained a reference 
to Kowloon (where Peking had gained a minor victory): 
"With regard to the outstanding issues, which are a legacy 
from the past, we have always held that, when conditions 
are ripe, they should be settled peacefully through nego-
tiations and that, pending a settlement, the status quo 
should be maintained. Within this category are the ques-
tions of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macao and the question 
of all those boundaries which have not been formally de-
limited in each case by the parties concerned." (People's  
Daily editorial of 8 March 1963) (emphasis supplied) 
This editorial raised the issue of disputed Sino-Soviet 
territorial claims as a further political counter to 
CPSU and C 'USA jibes.

Only after Mao intensified the purge of certain 
of his lieutenants in the spring of 1966 and only after 
he adopted an increasingly revolutionary attitude on 
various matters of foreign policy was he apparently will-
ing to reconsider his policy of non-revolutionary restraint 
toward the colonies. Partly to increase pressure on Hong 
Kong authorities regarding the visits of American naval 
ships and partly to establish a more revolutionary atti-
tude toward the colonies, Mao and his aides apparently 
permitted and encouraged Red Guards to express their fana-
tical views, which i. turn stimulated young leftists in 
Hong Kong and Macao. On 10 September 1966, Red Guards in 
Canton were reported circulating posters demanding a change 
in Hong Kong's name to "Bannish Imperialism City"--a demand 
similar to the one encouraged in late August among Red 
Guards in Peking who were demanding a change in the name 
of the street adjacent to the USSR embassy to "Anti-Revi-
sionism Street". On 15 September, Red Guards at a mass 
rally in Canton went even further, demanding that Hong 
Kong and Macao should be "returned" to the Peking regime 
and claiming thht the continued existence of the colonies 
would damage Peking's new revolutionary image.

Daily editorial or a formal protest. The Chinese leaders 
apparently were still apprehensive about making a more 
authoritative commitment because of uncertainty regarding 
the determination of the new governor to continue to re-
sist the demands. Having encouraged the local Communists 
and leftists--i.e , the Left--to organize demonstrations, 
they apparently preferred to sustain the impression of 
a spontaneous and completely local initiative, providing 
themselves with leeway to keep Peking's prestige disen-
gaged as much as possible. 
Their calculation seems to have been that a series 
of demonstrations and threats of a strike (and then a 
strike if necessary) would be a safe way to probe the 
governor's will to resist. They apparently did not plan 
violent demonstrations for the early stage of the strug-
gle. However, following some concessions made by the 
governor on 1 December, the Macao Left, in trying to 
wrest more concessions, staged small demonstrations in 
the city hall on the 2nd and 3rd. The police tried to 
disperse the group with fire hoses, but the participation 
of hooligans in the fray led to a riot on the 3rd. Eight 
Chinese were killed, apparently during the curfew period, 
and the local organizers, including Ho Yin, showed alarm, 
presumably because they were aware that Peking had pre-
ferred low-key and non-violent action in the early stage  
of the pressure campaign.( 
_j The governor reacted 
to the post-riot situation by capitulating, accepting the 
demands to dismiss the police chief and the district of-
ficer of Taipa Island, apologize, pay compensation, and 
promise not to permit another such incident as took place 
on the island. 
However, the Chinese leaders, recognizing his capitu-
lation as a sign of weakness and fear, apparently decided 
to wrest further, more degrading, and more significant 
concessions from him. Exploiting the incident of the 3rd, 
they demanded retribution, and for the first time came

that date that the Portuguese "must immediately and un-
conditionally" meet the new demands: "We will resolutely 
backup our compatriots in Macao." This rally was timed 
by the Chinese leaders for its psychological effect on the 
governor (who had capitulated to demands on the 1st and 
the 4th) and who was considering at the time new and addi-
tional demands. The rally on the 7th was also used to 
imply a military threat; Red Guard speakers were used to 
"warn" the Portuguese to accept the new demands "without 
reservations," 
because the Red Guards were the "strong 
reserves of

This rally reflected the apparent estimate of the 
Chinese leaders that they were on safe ground and that 
the political risk of such a direct commitment from the 
mainland was a small one. That is, they believed that 
the new governor was on the run and that he could be 
bullied into surrendering Portuguese control over certain 
aspects of the colony's life. 
The Chinese leaders, who do not have diplomatic 
relations with Lisbon, made the situation a place-to-
place rather than a government-to-government confronta-
tion. As of 7 December, Peking had not issued an offi-
cial protest or commented editorially. Although the Chinese 
communicated with Lisbon through a third country, France, 
this was not publicized. Publicly, they used the Canton 
authorities. On 9 December, the "Director of the Foreign 
Affairs Bureau of the Kwangtung Provincial People's Coun-

of seven Nationalist agents picked up in June 1963. The 
bullying aspect appeared in the form of positioning PLA 
troops at several points on the border (where they had 
not been before) and close-in patrolling of the harbor 
by Chinese Communist frigates. On 11 December, Ho Yin 
met with the governor and insisted on immediate surrender 
to all demands, and a People's Daily Commentator article 
on the same day, reflecting the Chinese leaders' apparent 
belief that they could not now detract from the image of 
a local initiative on the part of Macao lcktists, declared 
that the demands of the Kwangtung authorities were an ex-
pression of the "Chinese people's" position. The governor 
capitulated in separate statements on 12 and 13 December, 
turned over the seven Nationalist agents on the 20th, 
and was imeplled to conclude a Macao government protocol 
with the "Kwangtung Provincial People's Council" represen-
tative. The protocol in effect yielded Portuguese sover-
ignty to the Chinese Communists on several matters: in 
the banishing of specific Chinese Nationalist individuals 
and organizations in Macao and in complying with the demand 
to send back any refugee named by the Chinese Communists. 
The Macao success was the only advance which the 
Chinese Communist leaders could portray as a major foreign 
policy victory in contrast to a series of major defeats 
since the summer of 1965. It took some of the wind from 
Moscow's sails.*  
*But the Soviets were adaptable, ignored the abject 
Portuguese capitulation, and hammered away at the con-
tinued existence of the colony. Professing inability 
to understand why "Peking did not use this opportunity 
to put an end to Portuguese rule in Macao," they refer-
red to the protocol as "conciliation" with the Portuguese 
colonialists. (Izvestiya article of 23 December 1966)

it provided the Chinese leaders with a new confidence in

of the British authorities on the issue of visits to Hong

could not easily be cowed down, and they proceeded cautiously.

union was pressing charges and making "demands" (roughly 
similar to those made in Macao) in complaining about the 
master of a Dutch ship who had shot and wounded disorderly 
members of his crew. In the same month, some Hong Kong 
officials were wary of Macao developments as a prelude 
to similar pressures in their colony. A formal note of 
protest   on 
20 March, accusing London of permitting the U.S. to use 
Hong Kong as a "war base." When the colony authorities 
recognized that this note buttressed a campaign in the 
pro-Communist press in Hong Kong claiming that crewmen 
from the USS  Enterprise visiting the colony at the time 
had insuliI and attacked local Chinese, they triedlto 
avoid providing the Communists with a pretext to begin 
active demonstrations, asking the U.S. to cancel the pro-
posed visit of the USS Canberra. 
Moscow, which had been for some time publishing 
taunts about Peking's restraint regarding the colony, 
seized upon the 20 March protest note and derisively noted 
that, after all, the Indians "without wasting much time 
on anathematizing the imperialists" had taken over Goa, 
the situation of which had been very much the same as that 
of Hong Kong. (Moscow Radio comment of 29 March 1967) 
They tried to turn the protest note against Peking, declar-
ing that it officially confirmed that the U.S. "with the 
direct connivance of the Chinese government" is using 
Hong Kong in the war against Vietnam. (Literaturnaya  
Gazeta article of 29 March 1967) The effect of this 
Soviet campaign almost certainly was to increase the 
determination of Mac and his aides to seize on an issue 
to prove that Hong Kong existed only on their sufferance 
by making the British concede the point. 
The Hong Kong Left continued to receive indoctrina-
tion in Mao's "thought" and on developments ?related to his 
purge on the mainland. Their spirit of struggle was 
further st'mulated; their labor disputes were increasingly 
viewed as practical applications of Mao's "thought." Fol-

of the involved seamen's back wages--an NCNA displtch 
of 22 March claimed that the settlement was a victory for 
Mao's "thought." The spirit of struggle was applied by 
other unions in smaller labor disputes, but the Chinese 
leaders, who were not confronted with a major colony dis-
pute, continued to cooperate with the British on matters 
of food shipments and a telecommunications link between 
the Hong Kong and Canton airports. 
The attitude of Communist union leaders became 
more aggressive under the influence of initial strike 
successes (small versions, in their view of the Macao 
victory), mainland developments, and continued indoctrina-
tion in Mao's view of struggle. By early May 1967, the 
British authorities seemed to feel that they were living 
in a tinder box. When, on 6 May, riot police clashed with 
workers (who were wearing Mao buttons and shouting Mao-
ist slogans) outside a Kowloon plastic factory and arrested 
21 workers, the spark was struck which led to a major 
confrontation becween Peking and London. 
Evidence suggests that the decision to escrlate the 
6 May incident into a major confrontation with the Hong 
Kong authorities was made by the Chinese leaders and was 
passed on to come senior members of the local Communist 
apparatus While they were on the mainland. Thus while 
Peking had not yet become involved openly, organizers had 
arrived from the mainland with instructions as early as 
7 May. On the 12th, posters in Canton were noted declaring 
support for "Hong Kong compatriots" in their struggle 
against Chinese capitalists. By that time, Hong Kong Com-
munist newspapers hAp already bee noted making a black-
white distinction and polarizing the two sides, alleging 
that the"British authorities in Hong Kong" had started 
a showdown with the "Chinese nationals of Hong Kong." 
The Chinese leaders apparently had permitted officials 
of the Hong Kong NCNA office (who had returned to the 
colony from the mainland on 9 May) to indicate a degree 
of mainland involvement by meeting with Governor Trench 
on the 12th, but they were met by his aide, to whom they 
read three demands and several quotations from Mao's 
doctrines in unison. The British refused to comply with 
these demands or the demands of 13 May issued by local 
Communists.

The Chinese leaders apparently decided to inter-
vene more openly on the 15th, and their intervention was 
quicker, more direct, and more forceful than it had been 
in the Macao showdown. Deputy Foreign Minister Lo Kuei-
po handed charge Hopson a protest "statement" which de-
manded "immediate and unconditional" acceptance of five 
stipulations.* (This was part of a major coordinated 
pressure campaign, and on the same day, a People's Daily 
editorial attacked the Hong Kong authorities; by the after-
noon, Red Guards were used to sustain the new crisis 
atmosphere by pasting their posters to the walls of the 
British compound in Peking.) The protest "statement" in-
dicated the support of the "Chinese people" for the Hong 
Kong Left and probably reflected Mao's personal pique with 
the authorities for "attempting to exclude the great in-
fluence of China's great proletarian cultural revolution" 
and to "restrict the influence of Mao Tse-tung's thought." 
The policy of many years of restraint toward Hong Kong was 
abandoned. The Chinese leaders had escalated the situa-
tion from a place-to-place showdown (as in the Macao crisis) 
to a government-to-government confrontation between Peking 
and London. 
Although they were aware that the discipline and 
perseverance of the Hong Kong authorities were far greater 
than that displayed by the Macao authorities, the Chinese 
leaders seem to have overestimated the probable combined 
effect of their threats to British officials as well as 
the capability of the Hong Kong Left to mobilize local 
support. They quickly hit some of their targets in order 
to gain an immediate Hong Kong capitulation: on 16 May 
in Shanghai, the British consulate there was invaded for

sanguinary atrocities, offer apologies to the victims, 
and compensate for all their loses; guarantee against the

a short time; on 16 May in Peking, the British charge, 
Hopson, was besieged in his office in the embassy, and 
Reuters correspondent, Anthony Grey, who was trying to 
photograph Red Guards pasting anti-British slogans on 
his residence, was driven off from his terrace by a volly 
of stones; on 17 May in Peking, at an evening reception 
given by the Norwegian ambassador, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Lo Kuei-po refused to listen to Hopson's protest concern-
ing the invasion and sacking of the residence of the Shang-
hai consul, Peter Hewitt, by Red Guards on the 16th;* at 
the same reception, Chen Yi deliberately snubbed Hopson 
by avoiding a mutual toast and a proffered handshake; also 
on the evening of the 17th in Peking, Hopson had to abandon 
his car to push his way into the embassy past an effigy 
of Prime Minister Wilson and past loudspeakers at the gate 
which had been showering abuse on British "imperialism" 
since the 15th. To sustain pressure at a high government 
(official) level, Chou En-la i attended the anti-British 
rally on 18 May; Hsieh Fu-chih, the main speaker, implied 
that the leaders were out to get "great victories," and 
he placed considerable emphasis on the idea that the British 
were trying to exclude from the colony the "influence" of 
Mao's "cultural" revolution and his doctrines. Hsieh's 
emphasis suggested that Mao and his aides believed that 
a major victory (in Hong Kong) would help to demonstrate 
that export of his "thought" alone was a valuable revolu-
tionary contribution to Peking's anti-imperialistic foreign 
policy. 
However, the speech of Hsieh Fu-chih did not repeat 
the specific demands of the 15 May protest "statement,"

suggesting, for the first time, that the Chinese leaders 
believed the British could not be forced to comply with 
the five demands quickly.* Subsequent pressures on British 
officials on the mainland, in London, and in Hong Kong ap-
parently wer9 intended to get something less than total 
compliance with the demands, namely, a "speedy reply" 
It is not within the scope of this paper to relate 
all the details of the Chinese pressure campaign. The 
main lines seem to reflect a sequence of moves, with an 
initial surge (i.e., 15-17 May) followed by a marching 
in place and an apparent realization that British persever-
ance had been underestimated. The Chinese picked up the 
attack again on 24 May, and two British diplomats, who 
had been ordered to leave the Shanghai consulate on 22 
May, were turned over to the Red Guards to be subjected 
to various forms of Maoist abuse. New demonstrations were 
staged outside the embassy in Peking. 
This return to more pressure on the 24th may have 
reflected Mao's personal decision. The important People's  
Daily Commentator article of 25 May may have carried his 
own views (if not his own words) in certain sections. The 
article was used to thuneer at Foreign Secretary Brown 
(who had complained about the mistreatment of his diplomats 
and an abusive personal demarche from the Chinese 
: "Shut your mouth" and "admit your 
guilt" as we demanded in the 15 May protest issued by "our" 
Foreign Ministry. Whether Mao drafted these lines is 
conjectural, but they seem to reflect a basic decision 
to prepare for a protracted struggle and for an escalation

the Hong Kong authorities had "failed to apologize openly 
and immediately accept all the just demands put forward

Kong was followed by an appeal to "admit your responsi-
bility for these crimes", which were not detailed.

of the confrontation. Mao apparently refused to retreat 
down the hill he had climbed. The article contains a key 
quotation from Mao, which in effect became a directive 
to the Hong Kong Left: "The only course is to organize 
forces and struggle against them [i.e., the British]." 
A protracted struggle was necessary because oi 
(1) the British strategy to remain firm (but not provoca-
tive) and (2) the basic miscalculation (made by the Hong 
Kong Left and by the Chinese leack,rs in Peking) regarding 
the ability of the local Left to mobilize large groups 
for the showdown in the colony. As the realization that 
they had overestimated the Left's organizational capability 
deepened, the Chinese leaders apparently tried  to shift  
all of the blame onto the Hong Kong agitators./ 
This was typical of Mao: having failed to gain a quick, 25X1 
cheap, and what would have been important foreign policy 
victory, he blamed lesser officials for the miscalculation. 
It was also typical of Mao to persist in an image-
damaging course which a more reasonable and less stubborn 
leader (Chou, for example) would have discarded when con-
fronted with clear signs of failure. Rather than accept 
the clear and recalcitrant fact that the British could not 
be cowed down, Mao apparently took no nonsense from the 
fact, and insisted on a protracted struggle. In early 
June, when the Hong Kong authorities had restored order 
and the morale of the Left in the colony had been shaken--they 
seem to have had their fill of struggle--a People's Daily 
editorial of 3 June demanded that Hong Kong Chinese 
organize and prepare for more struggle--for the overthrow 
of British rule (at some unspecified future time). This 
editorial and the Commentator article of 2 June strongly 
recommitted Peking's prestige at a time when the situation 
was simmering down. The editorial reflected an apparent 
new obsession of Mao's, namely, that a large-scale struggle 
would force the British to surrender. Typically Maoist 
was the advice to the Hong Kong Left to (1) "do a big 
job of exposure" of alleged British atrocities, carrying

the campaign "to every household," (2) rely mainly on the 
working class as the "main revolutionary force" but to 
arouse "student masses" more fully and integrate their 
movement with that of the workers, and above all (3) 
"mobilize and organize still further and courageously" 
so as to form an unbreakable "revolutionary bastion." 
This was a program which probably reflected Mao's dis-
satisfaction with the performance of the Left thus far 
and, more importantly, his determination to project 
further into the future the timetable for final victory. 
In this new directive, Mao apparently made another 
major blunder by calculating that better organization and 
more time would surely be decisive against British disci-
pline. He was impelled to recognize that short-term pres-
sures on the British would not lead him from success to 
success, but rather from failure to dismal failure. Never-
theless, he persisted, demanding that the Left should 
unite and organize "more effectively." (People's Daily 
Commentator article of 13 June 1967) Having failed at 
a major attempt to gain a quick decision, he apparently 
insisted on trying to get a delayed decision by prolonged  
struggle. Local Communists had to shift their ground and 
explain to their supporters that "Quick battle and quick 
decision is an old magic weapon of imperjalism...Quick 
victory does not apply to the anti-persecution struggle 
of Hong Kong compatriots." (Editorial of 14 June 1967 
in the Communist-owned Hong Kong Ching Po) 
The Soviet leaders were provided with additional 
opportunities to taunt Mao for failing to seize control 
of Hong Kong. A 17 June 1967 Izvestiya article depicted 
the Chinese leaders as "cowards": instead of using the 
Hong Kong workers' protests as a means of "liquidating 
the remains of colonalism on their soil...the Peking 
leaders adopted a cowardly hypocritical position, saying 
one thing and doing another." The article added that the 
British had quickly seen through the "political clamour" 
of the Chinese leaders. "That is why they have begun to 
behave so brazenly in Hong Kong." That is, Moscow shifted 
its attack from a taunt about Peking's acquiescence in 
the status quo of Hong Kong to a taunt about an ineffective 
attempt, by proxy and "political clamour," to disgrace

the British. Chou En-lai moved to devise a position which 
did not commit Peking to intervene to the extent of trying 
to force the British out of the colony. He tried to make 
it clear that Peking's role of support did not require 
direct participation--actually, the Chinese leaders' role 
was somewhat more than mere support, as they were provid-
ing guidance on the main trends of the struggle--and he 
stated that the Hong Kong Chinese were "organizing a mighty 
army" while the mainland Chinese, by contrast, were helping 
only "in accordance with the needs of the situation." 
(Chou's speech of 24 June 1967) This position not only 
excluded the need for Peking's intervention, but also was 
intended to deflect the Hong Kong militants' grumbling 
over the failure of the Chinese leaders to weigh in with 
the full force of the PLA.* On the other hand, he had 
to convince international opinion that Peking's failure 
to humiliate the Hong Kong government authorities was 
not due to any unwillingness to support the local Com-
munists but rather a matter of long-term planning 
Chou's 24 June statement that Peking would help 
only "in accordance with the needs Of the situation" im-

the level of border security. That the PLA's role on 
this border was even more restricted than its role on 
the Indian border was made clear by developments during 
the July 1967 crisis. Mao and his aides could have used,

ing that if we had listened to everybody's advice along 
such lines, we would have been obliged to "take up weapons

place on 8 July at the border towa of Sha-kau-tok, involv-
ing local militia and the PLA, on the Chinese side, Ind 
police and Gurkhas, on the British side. However, al-
though additional PLA units were moved up quickly to the 
border, the Chinese leaders were careful to avoid using 
them to escalate the military incident. Nevertheless, 
there was a shift to more aggressive tactics beyond the 
use of the strike (in May and June) to seizures of border 
police stations and bomb attacks (in July and thereafter); 
the shift had been preceded by a warning from Peking that 
"the proper punishment" will fall on the head of anyone who 
has "killed our compatriots" in Hong Kong. (People's Daily 
editorial of 5 July 1967) Peking's protests over the 
border incident of 8 July at Sha-kau-tok and the use of 
troops to support police (for the first time on 12 July) 
were ineffectual, and the Hong Kong authorities continued 
to act vigorously against the rioters. Peking's Foreign 
Ministry note of protest of 11 July 1967 demanding the 
release of 3 NCNA men arrested in Hong Kong did not com-
pel the British to retreat. The Chinese leaders had to 
resort to political retaliation (by launching small demon-
strations in front of the British embassy and by placing 
under house arrest Reuters correspondent Anthony Grey on 
21 July) after one NCNA man was sentenced for his politi-
cal agitation to two years in prison on 19 July. By the 
end of July, the Hong Kong authorities had demoralized 
elements of the local Communist apparatus and had frustrated 
the desire of the Chinese leaders to attain a Macao-like 
capitulation of the British. The Chinese leaders were 
unwilling to use military methods to gain their capitul-
tioh, and PLA Acting Chief of Staff Yang Cheng-wu provided 
the Hong Kong Left with only routine cAipport by the end 
of July: "We give resolute support and aid to our patriotic 
countrymen in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their heroic strug-
gle against fascist atrocities perpetuated by the British 
authorities." (Speech of 31 July 1967 on the eve of the 
40th anniversary of the founding of the PLA) In the con-
text, "we" seemed to refer to the PLA, but the support 
implied seems to have been political.

small-scale border violations by fanatics on the Chinese 
side apparently exceeded the intention of the Chinese lead-
ers, and PLA troops at various times during the month had 
to intervene on the mainland-colony border to keep aroused 
young militants from expanding their border violations 
into full-scale military skirmishes. The determination 
of the Hong Kong authorities to combat vigorously the 
violent actions of the local Left, and the effectiveness 
of the police on the streets of the colony increased the 
demoralization of some elements of the Left and the frus-
trations of the Chinese leaders in Peking. They were to

After militant Chinese workers and some Red Guards 
crossed the border at Man-kam-to, seized the British 
sentries' weapons, and forced them to sign an agreement 
to remove barbed wire barriers and after the Hong Kong 
authorities repudiated this agreement and temporarily 
closed the border (except  at Lo-wu and Sha-kau-tok), the 
Chinese leaders protested 
They were rebuffed in the British rejection 
of the protest note. When, on 17 August the colony author-
ities suspended the publishing permits of three major 
pro-Communist newspapers and arrested important staff 
members, the Chinese leaders were confronted with new 
evidence that they had failed to cow down the "imperial-
ists." Mao perprnally may have been infuriated when the 
whip he was using to beat his British opponent (that is, 
the continuation of Communist pressure in Hong Kong and 
diplomatic pressure in Pkeing) began to break in his hand. 
On 19 August, Hong Kong government police searched the 
offices of the three papers under ban. Mao and his aides 
apparently decided to use a heavier instrument--the govern-
ment-to-government ultimatum. On 20 August, the British 
? charge Hopson was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and 
handed a protest note containing an ultimatum to London 
and the Hong Kong government demanding cancelling of the 
ban and dropping of the lawsuits "within 48 hours." The 
Chinese leaders tried to attain a quick British capitula-
tion by increasing the pressure within the deadline period, 
and on 21 August, they used "200 revolutionary journalists 
in Peking" to demonstrate in front of Hopson's office 
after having cut the telephone of the Reuters correspondent,

who was still under their orders to remain in his house. 
They then made the point clear that the British embassy 
was their target of first priority by reducing the size 
and the virulence of the demonstrations in front of the 
Ceylon, Mongolia, and Kenya embassies.* The British 
rejected the ultimatum note and began prosecuting the 
arrested staff members. Mao and his aides almost certainly 
had been prepared to take some form of act on beyond mere 
verbal threats and Red Guard demonstrations in front of 
the British embassy if the ultimatum was rejected. This 
is suggested by the very act of establishing a deadline. 
Not to have taken an abusive form of action, not to have 
engaged in some political retaliation would have confronted 
them with a defeat more specific, and therefore more ob-
vious, than the defeats they had had to face since May  
1967.  r 
The Chinese leaders acted to commit a diplomatic 
abomination and then acted to deny their own responsibility 
for it. The Red Guards broke into the mission compound, 
burned the charge's office, and then manhandled Hopson 
and certain other members of his staff. In the course 
of this outrage, they tried to force Hopson to accept the 
personal humiliation (and the humiliation that would have 
been reflected on the British government) of complying 
with their demands that he must bow his head in complete 
submission to them. It would have been a "revolutionary"

victory if Hopson had submitted; he courageously refused, 
performing more heroically than did the Indonesian charge, 
who admitted that on 5 August Red Guards had forced him 
and other embassy staff personnel to kneel on the ground 
at the foot of a "people's court." (Darwoto interview 
of 2 November 1967) Having administered other "serious 
consequences" to the mission and mission personnel, the 
Chinese leaders moved immediately to deter London from 
using the incident as sufficient reason to break diplomatic 
relations.* They began a major effort to deny that they 
had committed the outrage. Posters in Peking in early 
September 1967 claimed that "at the time of the burning 
of the British Office," Madame Mao and Chen Po-ta had is-
sued a directive by telephone that the action taken against 
the embassy should not "overstep international norms." 
But it was not clear when this alleged directive was is-
sued and precisely what international norms the Chinese 
leaders, who had been committing outrages against diplomatic 
immunity since the spring of 1967, would have been indicat-
ing. 
Chou En-lai, reported by the posters to have con-
demned the sacking of the office, issued a five-point dir-
ective on 1 September which included prohibitions against 
the manhandling of diplomats,' damaging of buildings, and 
*Fsar of a diplomatic break, threatened by Indonesia's 
Foreign Minister Malik on 14 August regarding treatment 
of diplomats in the Indonesian embassy, was clearly indi-
cated in their quick action on 15 August to lift the vir-
tual blockade from around the embassy in Peking, after which 
Indonesian d;plomats were allowed to enter and leave with-
out obstruction. That is, they were able to control the 
A situation around the Indonesian embassy in mid-August 
(following the 5 August demolition on one embassy build-
ing and the burning of all embassy cars) when the con-
sequences were clearly to be a break in Sino-lndonesian 
relations.

the "burning" of offices and cars.* The Chinese leaders 
used a Chinese servant of a member of the charge's staff 
to relay a story further absolving them of complicity: 
when Madame Mao, Chen Po-ta, and Hsieh Fu-chih arrived on 
the scene in a large car during the attack on the office, 
they had to intervene personally to prevent Red Guards 
from going on to burn the two British blocks of flats in 
the diplomatic compound. The major responsibility for 
the incident was placed on Yao Teng-shan, the fanatical 
former charge to Indonesia, who is said to have been 
encouraged by Wang Li, former member of the Cultural 
Revolutionary Group, to seize power in the Foreign Ministry 
after Wang's anti-Chou speech of 7 August 1967.** Although 
*Following the 1 September 1967 meeting of the enlarged 
Peking Municipal Revolutionary Committee, wall posters 
in Peking carried Chon's "five prohibitions," which were 
(1) do not beat diplomats, (2) do not stone embassies, 
(3) do not burn embassies, (4) do not enter diplomats' 
houses, and (5) do not violate the boundaries of the dip-
lomatic missions. Madame Mao, at the same time, claimed 
that "Last year when I was setting up the Red Guard Head-
quarters, I said that it was not permitted to make attacks 
at...foreign embassies. If you are going to oppose foreign-
ers, you have to do it on the street. What do you mean 
by entering foreign embassies?" (Speech of 1 September 
1967) 
**"The speech of Wang X caused an upheaval in the for-
eign affairs: department for 15 days.. .Inspired by the 
'August 7' speech, an insignificant man like Yao Teng-
shan, deputy head of the Foreign Ministry General Service 
Department, became 'foreign minister' for 14 days...." 
(Peking Red Guard Newspaper editorial of 18 October 1967) 
The major complaints against Yao were that he (1) "wrested 
power from the Foreign Ministry's Party Center" and (2) 
"sent cables to the embassies in foreign countries with-
out permission of Chairman Mao and Premier Chou..." He 
was also disparaged as "an embassy burner."

Peking claims that Chou re-captured this power on 23 
August--the day after the mission office was burned--it 
is not clear that Chou lost control of all aspects of 
foreign policy decision-making. On the contrary, he seems 
to have had his way during the Hong Kong confrontation 
in rejecting "advice" to send the PLA against the colony 
(Chou's speech of 1 September 1967) and in defending 
certain embassies, such as Cambodia's after anti-Chinese 
actions had been taken by Sihanouk. On balance, it may 
be conjectured that Chou and members of the Cultural 
Revolutionary Group (i.e., Chen Po-ta, Madame Mao, and 
Kang Sheng) were aware of the strategy to attack the 
embassy and sanctioned the attack but not the burning of 
the charge's office, which may have been the point at 
which Red Guard action exceeded the plan. 
The Chinese leaders were clearly aware that after 
the extreme "left" action of burning the charge's office 
they would have to create the impression among the British 
embassy staff and elsewhere that Red Guard outrages against 
embassy property and personnel were entirely the work of 
fanatics (which was apparently only part of the whole 
story). At a later date, they specifically claimed that 
the office burning was contrary to a direct order. In 
late December 1967, Chou told an Afro-Asian writers con-
ference in Peking that he, Chen Po-ta, Madame Mao, and 
Kang Sheng, learning in advance of Red Guard plans "to 
set fire" to the embassy office, "ordered" that it not 
be done, but one element of the Red Guards defied the 
order. In any case, the Chinese'l 'Eiders apparently have 
been careful to omit the crucial matter of the 48-hour 
ultimatum, in post facto explanations, as well as the 
"serious consequences" they had pledged in it.

The burning of the charge's office on 22 August 
marked the high-tide of wild and irrational actions 
against the British in Peking. Various aspects of the 
confrontation were sustained, such as restrictions on the 
travel of British personnel, detention of Anthony Grey, 
and bomb terrorism and border incidents in Hong Kong; 
these actions reflected the Chinese leaders' reluctance 
to de-escalate quickly. They were concerned about any 
appearance of igik-Rigi; as a result,  they continued to 
be nasty in  statements to the 
British. They had to cover a gradual retreat from the 
high point of the confrontation and they were particularly 
sensitive concerning the arrest of the NCNA officials 
(still being held by the colony authorities) as well as 
their image among the Left in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, 
they apparently directed local senior Communists in late 
September 1967 to explain and justify to their apparatus 
subordinates the new and less intense phase of the struggle.* 
The 
Foreign Ministry protest of 6 December regarding the clos-
ing of a local Chinese school, raids on other schools, 
and the arrest of one headmaster as well as two film dir-
ectors indicated that although the protracted politick.; 
*The new low-boil phase reduced the morale of the Hong 
Kong Communist apparatus, and in an effort to refurbish 
sagging spirits, the Chinese leaders established on 27 
Cctober 1967 the "Support Hong Kong Compatriots' Commit-
tee" in Canton. When, on 3 November )967 Chou En-lai 
warned militant Red Guards in Canton to keep hands off 
of Chen Yu because he was the head of the Committee, the 
Chinese premier was indirectly indicating that Chen and 
his Committee were directly subordinate to Peking.

struggle in Hong Kong will proceed at a lower boil, the 
Chinese leaders will continue to view the colony situa-
tion as "the nub of Sino-British relations which could 
not be improved or normalized until the Hong Kong problem 
was solved." (Foreign Ministry official's statement to 
Hopson on 6 December 1967) 
The prospect would seem to be for a protracted 
political struggle. British determination and the failure 
of the Hong Kong Communist apparatus to acquire widespread 
local support have made Peking's demands for capitulation 
merely matters for the record which eventually may be 
dropped. However, the Chinese leaders may well intensify 
the struggle to counter specific British actions against 
the colony's Left or to comply with any future intensifi-
cation of Mao's purge on the mainland.
